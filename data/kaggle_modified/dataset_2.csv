The Apostles Creed,Jedi Mind Tricks,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop']","[Apathy the Alien Tongue]
I sit upon a cloud of nuclear waste
And taste the orgasmic juice of a goddess with her lips spread on my face
As I speak in space touching a damaged piece of a satellite
Resembling wrecking remnants of a 2010 soliloquy
Entity, centuries from the time of man designed a plan
Of a time span of seconds to an immortal
Transport immortals in portals toward an Egyptian land
To then erect complex architect structures and pyramids
Melted parted rock with acidic chemical blood samples
From a reptilian females' period, I travel like the Iliad
But my ship sails amongst cosmic whales and intergalactic pirates
Telling tales of trails left by the gods
Through the center of the sun when they passed the spot
Jesus Christ was really an ancient astronaut
I attacked mastodons when I crashed upon Earth in the Ice Age
And twice laid mankeys with assistance of sound waves
And psycho-kinetics, you can't escape the wrath of Apathetic
The time has come for man to die, not project prophetic phonetics
Fugitive prosthetic limbs for hairy crippled or rejected
Exoskeleton extensions of cybernetic inventions
Moving swiftly like a Thundercat, my hunger tracks rats on the train tracks
And when I rap on tracks I attract tremendous energy sources
Changing forms through metamorphose
I travel darkened corridors with orbs of light and torches
We ride away on apocalyptic pale  horses
And disappear as shadows in the forest
And disappear as shadows in the forest
[Hook]
Non-conceptual, non-exceptional
Your whole aura is Plexiglas

[Yan the Phenomenon]
I take hold of truth eludes me like sands through the cracks in my hands
Retaliatory silhouettes in apocalyptic lands
Nomadic by the second, but I can't let this stress get the best of me
Though it test me on a daily basis
And traces the tracks of my tears down my cheeks and over my lips
Taste the freedom but it seems like gravity
Has me chained to this pathetic land like Satan's left burning lake of Chaos
But yet I continue on with no tendencies in my subconscious
So right there's a contradiction, because I'm aware of these tendencies
So they ain't in my subconscious anymore
More like forces that I conversate with, halves thirds and fourths
That I sliced my soul into a percentage
I know you wouldn't recommend it, so I wrote this letter and never sent it
Cause my pain, is my pain, I won't trouble you with my own
Now I swim through waves of asphalt with no place to call home
Yan on the lonely island and see a plastic smile speaking gibberish
At varying frequencies, burn out the radio and television transmissions
Or simply audible voices who wear the robes of righteousness
Equilibrium is fucked up from data overload
Enhanced by the fact that I walk on a narrow road
That's more like a tightrope between wisdom and insanity
Seems like clarity is the ever elusive goal
When insanity has the help of the omnipotent force of gravity

[Ikon the Verbal Hologram]
On the battleground you can go to war like Sudan
But I'm half-man and so you have to overstand
That the other half of me is made of liquid and steel
Ain't you sick and tired of people screaming ""keep it real""?
I'm powered by the ancients, spirit in the soul
It's war, and Ikon carries crossbows
But I toss foes through the center of the planet
When you battle me, you best be praying like a mantis
I will send you, through the depths of the Atlantic
To study transcripts of rhymes by the enchanted
Hologram, the verbal war paradigm
Traveling back in time to change the way y'all wack rappers rhyme
If I don't succeed you will bleed
The just punishment of the Apostle's Creed
This is hip-hop kid, shit is straight from the heart
You's an actor with a record deal trying to play the part

Like THAT, like that one time like that one time like that one time
Uh, my man Stoupe in the house like that one time like that one time
My man, Chico in the house like that one time like that one time
My man Yan the Phenomenon, in the house, like that one time one time
Ikon the Verbal Hologram, up in this muthafucka
Open up that third eye before I open it for you
Word is bond, Jedi Mind, '97, '98
Rappers, I decapitate like that
FUCK all y'all!"
I Who Have Nothing,Jedi Mind Tricks,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'alternative', 'pop', 'jazz', 'rock', 'blues']","I, I who have nothing

[Verse 1: Ikon]
Intersections in real time
The unbroken circle and dimensions of the mind
The tie that binds
The eternal tie that defines
The vanity of my insanity in due time
Will shine
Like the night seas under the moon
The haunted corners of familiar rooms
Yet I'm consumed
We're vanishing into thin air
The realization that this shit is my cross to bear
So where
Did I think I could run away to see
The people that decided to leave without asking me
But we
Decide to wait for happier tomorrows
And find someone so they can be distractions from our sorrow
But my distractions the books of paper that I scrawl in
I'm eloquent as summer breeze and leaves that have just fallen
I've crawled in a corner hoping all of this will end
With the knowledge that love is just another word for revenge
I who have nothing but the comfort of my sins
I who have nothing but the comfort of my friends
[Hook]
I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one
I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one

[Verse 2: Ikon]
As I decay, demons prey above me like a vulture
Ability to endure contradiction is a high sign of culture
Verbal sculptures, self defacing
It is not God or lunacy that I am facing
But the erasing of the purity and passion of my words
The herds of cattle babble on with talk of the absurd
But I preferred
To walk away from all the feuds
To find my life is more confusing than a rubic's cube
So I'm subdued
In all my words of verbal prods
To live alone one must be an animal or a God
But it's official
All of my pain is clear as crystal
The natural side of life has now been seeming artificial
But I can hit you
And rest assured that I'mma last words
I could give a fuck about ya secrets and ya past words
I can pass words and their ability to hurt you
Patience is a virtue and knowledge is of commercial
I who have nothing but the pain that I refer to
I who have nothing but the pain that I've refered to
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ikon]
Lost among the miracles, I stand alone
And I've grown into a being that's sitting on top a throne
I've known
For many years that I would turn to rust
I find a reason for another breath
Before my return to dust
I become one with science and mathematics and the rising of the sun
I'm numb
To all of those who blind and cannot see
The chastiser of the enemy
Perception requires duality
Inspect ya soul, the color of coal inside the body
I have hardly come across them who's holy
Send them to the cherubim to control thee
Burning of the sun and frigidness of the cold
The battlefield is new but the war is now old
You can never see the merest shadow of a halo
Above the head of evil djin who's deadly like tornado
The world has become an aquarium
Full of gaping fish with murderous smiles
I on the other hand stand on the outside looking in
Writing down murderous files
I who have nothing but the lack of variation
And I who have nothing but chains and suffocation

Marchin' niggas to the spot where the Earth's crack is
Hard to grasp like science and math is
The cavemen who don't practice and live backwards

Feel no love, no way you shield the slugs

The AR-15 beam leave you still as stone
I'm workin' twenty-four-seven while you chill at home
I'm on the block with my people where the killers roam
I'm in a killer zone, where police can trap me
I'm ready to go to war with them like we Iraqi
We in the last days, only Darkness passes
No more pure air, only bloody muddy ashes
Yeah, you need to recognize the God is sick
'Cause I was born inside of Egypt near the Gaza Strip
Don't make me cock the fifth and put the flame to em
And thug it out like the Israeli's and Iranian's
Remember when I put the pen to the pad
When I heard ""Style Wars"" by Lakim Shabazz
And in the lab, everything was constructed with Stoupe

And none of y'all would be around if I could bring Pun back

Along with the .44 militant gun rap
I break bread with the brothers I trust
Cause I know that if I'm ever in some trouble, they bust
Could never be us, we too raw for the rap now

I pull a twelve gauge shot at you, back down

Or you can see the type of lead that my Beretta spits
Or take you through the torture chamber and behead the bitch
Yeah, I'll put your body to the blades and choppers
And teach you about the disruptive symbol of chakras
If you believe what they tellin' you, the beast and them won
That's why I speak about survival and need for a gun
I stand for what them thugs is repping'
But they don't know the government is usin' drugs as weapons
And drug injections, was taught by the prophets before
About the cavalry of shadowy prophets of war
It's hard to grip, so I spit it at a different degrees
But the inner earth holds more water than seas

Mommy, I'm sorry if my first letter made you cry
To be honest with you, I don't think that I want to die
Sometimes I feel like that I'm cancerous in other's lives
That's probably why I drink at night and sleep 'til four or five
It's kind of hard walking through life with my distorted eyes
When I was younger, I was stupid and I thought I'd thrive
I thought a lot about everything I said in the letter
And questioned whether or not if I was dead, you'd be better
You think my shorty would be happy if I never met her?
It's too late now, mommy, I could never forget her
Could never forget how she taught me to love
Cause my father and my grandmother is always above
It's glory above, you know that daddy taught me to thug
And every time we was with nanny she'd bombard me with hugs
Damn, I miss her, mommy, and it's hard to believe
That I'm grown and I don't understand it, why did they leave?

Than linger on and dare to live

I got a niece, and my nephews, they need me around a while
I think they need me cause they hitting that age
And they ain't trying to speak to Lenny cause they spitting they rage
Yeah, and mommy, speaking to Lenny, I think my brother need me
And we Italian, so you know my mother love to feed me
And it's the little things you do for me that make it worth it
Like when I play a joint that we did and you say it's perfect
And when Jake got knocked, you knew that I was hurt
You told me put all of my heart in the song, and it worked
I promised him that I'd be there when he got out the bing
You ain't raise me to be a liar, ma, that's not my thing
I told him that I'd hold him down the whole time that he gone
They kept him locked inside a cage, but that's cool, cause he's strong
So mommy, keep that first letter I wrote you on the low
I think I wanna stay alive and see if I can grow

I never meant to hurt anyone, it's God's work
Cause wakin' up everyday for me is hard work
And tell June that she was the love of my life
And that I never stopped lovin' here even in spite
All the things that we went through together
Through the highs and lows and bad weather
Let Frank know he always made me smile
Tell him back in the days was crazy wild
Tell Stoupe that I always had his back, ma'
And we was meant to be together on a track, ma'
Tell Cheek I consider him a brother
When I die, the pain will spit into another
That's just how life goes ma, it's painful!

Look, I just want to make you better
I think I could save you
But I think I'm bipolar. I love you then I hate you
Grew with disdain though I hate whoever ain't you
Hate when I can't date you but I also need my space too
I made room for this love. How foolish of me
And every woman looking at you knew that you was lucky
So check the verse miss. I ain't say I'm perfect
But you was low on love, what I do; reimbursed it
And now it hurts to be around or converse with ya
And what’s worse is before this, I had worshiped you
Now war missiles hand guns and grenades
The walls I couldn't break em or take em apart with a tank
Now momma told me be careful who you love
G said just rap it up, these bitches actin up
And as for us, we was different though. Things have gotten difficult
Try to be Mr. perfect intercontinental, hold up
You spend your time with your friends all the time
And all that time with your friends put my momentum on decline
My minds gone evil. You changed with the season
You had a new clear heart. Guess I was Hiroshima
So now I need some Xanies, some Remy, and some reefer
So when this war is over I'm not PTSD'ing
And I don't wanna leave her. But you know what got me wonderin'
I'm scared to lose love but even more scared to love again

Why we gotta argue
Why we gotta fight
I just wanna love you, I wanna make it right
It's like we both forgot what we were fightin' for
So tell me why are we at war

[Seinfield Skit]

Yea, they do whatever they want, whenever they want
And nobody else can stop it
I'm catching myself depositing these feelings she withdraw from
And I ain't got the gall to tell my godzilla byebye
So I'm hurting. Me effort is apparent she not fertile

The anger I've adopted. The feelings been aborted
So now I press ignore if ever Cupid tried to call up
They call me better now. See when everything is stopped
And your loves in hindsight and you see everything its not
Notice everything it wasn't. Realizing why it shouldn't ever be again
Cause in the end its not about what you put in
Fuck kissing and hugging. They love pushing your buttons
New love is so beautiful. Time just makes it ugly
But fuck it I accept it. no longer will neglect it
If a period is late then I will mark it with a question
That mean I never trust em. And if you ever love them
Know that favorite girlfriends turn into crazy baby mommas
The war
Now why we gotta argue. Why we gotta fight
I just wanna love you. I wanna make it right
It's like we both forgot what we were fighting for
So tell me why are we at war?

Just another product of this matrix
This maze I'm in amazes me at times
I just wanted to be at peace with you
And if I gotta settle for a piece of you
Then I gotta say peace to you
With all due respect I do respect you enough to expect
Effort is all I ask
If we gonna last more, I gotta ask for more
And if that means that I'm askin for too much
I'm sure we'll end up as our last or...past
We bash
We blast
We shoot
We lose
We pass.....war"

Peeping, watching, streets
You boys are soft like bread
Uh-huh uh huh uh, live from Brooklyn
Uh-huh uh, the streets is watching
Check it, check, uh-huh uh, check

[Verse 1]
Look, if I shoot you, I'm brainless
But if you shoot me, then you're famous!
What's a nigga to do when the, streets is watching, blocks keep clocking
Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake?
Can't ignore it, that's the fastest way to get extorted
But my time is money, and twenty-five, I can't afford it
Beef assorted like Godiva chocolates
Niggas you bought it, I pull the slide back and cock it
Plan aborted, you and your mans get a pass
This rhyme, you're operating on bitch time
Y'all niggas ain't worth my shells, all y'all niggas tryna do
Is hurt my sales, and stop trips to John Meneilly
The type to start a beef then run to the cops
When I see you in the street got one in the drop
When I'd rather be on tour getting a hundred a pop
Taking pictures with some bitches in front of the drop
The streets is watching
[Chorus]
When the, streets is watching
Blocks keep clocking
Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake
Can't ignore it

[Verse 2]
Now it's hard not to kill niggas
It's like a full time job not to kill niggas, can't chill
The streets is watching you when you froze your arms
Niggas wanna test you when your gun goes warm
Can't get caught with your feet up, gotta keep your heat up
Sweet niggas running 'round swearing shit is sweeter
Once you're tagged lame, the game is follow the leader
Everybody want a piece of your scrilla, so you gotta keep it realer
Kidnap niggas wanna steal you
Broke niggas want no cash, they just wanna kill ya
For the name, niggas don't know the rules
Disrespecting the game, want you to blow your cool
Force your hand, of course that man's plotting
Smarten up, the streets is watching (it's on)

[Chorus]
When the, streets is watching, blocks keep clocking
Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake, can't ignore it
[Verse 3]
My street mentality: flip bricks forever, know me and money
We like armed co-defendants, nigga we stick together
Shit whatever for this cheddar ran my game into the ground
Hustle harder 'til secret indictment time came around
Now you can look up and down the streets and I can't be found
Put in 24 hour shifts but, that ain't me now
Got a face too easy to trace, niggas mouths got slow leaks
Had to hire a team of workers, couldn't play those streets
See out of space like Mercury, you jerking me? Hectic
Had to call upon my wolves to send niggas the message
It said this: ""Let's play fair and we can stay here;
I'm trying to transform you boys to men like daycare!
Hey, there's money to be made!"" and niggas got the picture
Stopped playing with my paper and, we got richer
Then hard times fell upon us, half of my staff had warrants
The other half, in the casket lay dormant
I felt like life was cheating me
For the first time in my life I was getting money but it was like my conscience was eating me
Was this a lesson God teaching me? Was he saying that
I was playing the game straight from Hell from which few came back?
Like bad coke, pimp or die, was my mind frame bad?
Was niggas thinking simplify was turning cocaine crack?
Ain't a whole lot of brain to that, just trying to maintain a stack
And not collide like two trains that's on the same track
But get my life together like the oils I bring back
In the bottom of the pot where no water gets hot
Got my transporter take it across the border then stop
To set up shop with a quarter of rock, here's the plan
For three straight weeks, niggas slaughtered the block
But you know the game is food, it fucked up me and my dudes
One drought can wipe a nigga out, faster than the cops
And this unstable way of living just had to stop
Half of my niggas got time, we done real things
By '94 became the subject of half of y'all niggas rhymes
Public apologies to the families of those caught up in my shit
But that's the life for us lost souls brought up in this shit
The life and times of a demonic mind, excited with crime
And the lavish luxuries that just excited my mind
I figured, ""Shit, why risk myself? I'll just write it in rhymes
And let you feel me; and if you don't like it, then fine!""
The mind state of a nigga who boosted the crime rate
So high in one city they send National Guards to get me
Shit, bitch, who's fucking with that? The streets"

Torn apart now
I cannot have this combination
And fusion of your elixir
Torn apart now
These are the choices we've made
Do I swallow or walk away?

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Most of my adult life I've been torn into two
If you love me, then I love you and this song is for you
It's tight hard when you know that you sick
And your shorty seeing you as an emotional wreck
The closer I get, it's like the farther I feel
And my heart has turned into this heavy armor and steel
It's hard to be real, hard to listen to the dumb shit
And I take a lot of pills cause it numbs shit
I wish I had another path to follow
Wish that I could be a man and learn to pass the bottle
A graphic novel, my future a box or an urn
Having dreams about death, but I'm not that concerned
And I'm diseased, through the seasons they turn
Watching leaves from the trees turn diseased and they burn
I'm eager to learn, but I'm holding my breath
And every day alive is just another closer to death
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, I've been alive longer than I expected to be
And took care of everything that's expected of me
Took care of my girl and my mother
I told her that I'm always here and I love her
I handle shit differently cause I'm grown now
And the truth is that I'd rather be alone now
I'd rather not have to deal with the day
And I hate when people ask me how I'm feeling today
My brother Rasul, we had a beef and grudge
But we grew up together, cousin, so it's peace and love
I wish y'all the best, I wish y'all the shine
I wish I didn't wanna off my thoughts with a nine
I'm thoughtful and kind, but I'm evil alas
But everything I love has turned to a tedious task
I feel that life a waiting game for people to pass
But nobody ever want you to see through the mask

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
I don't wanna be a burden to y'all
I just wanna know exactly what my purpose is for
I feel like nothing I do is ever right
And that I'm acting a fool another night
And I admit, I don't take care of myself
So I do a lot of thinking and preparing myself
'Cause the fact is my father died young and I might too
And it ain't any way to tell what I might do
I don't wanna leave my mother behind
I don't want for her to cry, because the struggle is mine
I don't want for her to grind no more
I don't want for her to work a 9-to-5 no more
I ain't have to work a fucking 9-to-5 before
So I'm trying to get this money to provide for y'all
And if the shit ain't work out and I'm suddenly gone
Just remember that the motherfucking love isn't gone

This is raw, all across the board, Liquid Sword Chamber
If it's coming from my jaw, then it's pure anger
Heavy metal rap, with a four four banger
We can settle that, let the mic cord hang ya
I play homage to the best of them, like Christopher Wallace
And bring drama to the rest of 'em, with biscuits from coppers
I'm with Allah justice, and we raw gritty
Picture hell, Illadel' to New York City
I brought a four with me, we can capture the ring
And now we more merciless than the Statue of Ming
And y'all more purposeless than a pacifist king
You gon' die, like a brawl with a gat in the Bing
It's a passionate thing, the way we make classics
Genuine brilliance or innate madness
Yeah, we all spin on the same axis
And this chrome thing here, leave your frame backless
The police always try'na aim flame at us
So I don't mind when the pig brain splatters
I don't mind, that we all gon' die soon
I return to the silence of God's tomb

Imagine a rhyme in it's prime, from off the baselines
Skyscraper verticals, support the hang time
Evidence that was left at the scene of the crime
Trace back to a few, from out a group of nine
Who performed well, regardless to the price of the tickets
Off or onstage, whatever, still kick it
With the footwork, of Freddie Adu, it's all new
Now the rap commissioners, they wanna clone my shoe
But the road's narrow, and it's difficult to climb
With the heat, the wind and the fallen rocks combined
It's hard to stay in line, the course is an obstacle
Within each chamber, the force is unstoppable
Lyrical swordsman, blades sharp, I cut out your heart
M.C.'s want no part, in any type of conflict
Because then I respond quick, it gets thick
The problem goes beyond sick

Pay me in advance and make sure that it’s exact
My ex girl’ll probably show up for the simple fact
That tomorrow she can tell all of her friends it was whack
But fuck that though, this about me
They say my whole fan base is missing ID
But the young trendsetting musician I be
Got critics giving up the recognition I de-serve
Never bring your Mrs by me
I’m it I’m it call me Mr. IT
If I get one wish I'ma wish to die free
They say gon head, ball like Ms. Arie and I do
The realest in my age group, no shit
SoHo, Cosmo, Balmain blow fish
Let's make a toast, tell your friends come closer
Drinks on me like a coaster

Look at what I done
Look at where I’m is

'Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please don’t be surprised when they announce that I won

I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit
That’s all I got to say, at the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away

[Verse 2]
Long awaited, hated
Fans see me out and they holla happy belated
It’s about time that you made it
I was bumping your songs when nobody else played it
When I was up in Hot Beats in Atlanta steady giving daps
Fetching niggas drinks but I never got to rap
If anybody asked though I prolly woulda snapped
But I can’t sign nothing 'til my lawyer get the facts and
No one decides who the definition of talent is
And Mrs. Murray look at what my talent did
And what your business is
It's been a couple years
Guess it’s not about who you know
It’s just how you balance it
It’s always awkward to dummy a nigga artist
And get on someone song when you know you coming the hardest
It's how you start actin' when nobody can reach you
My plan just hatched, happy easter

[Chorus]
We doing it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I’m is

Problem is they be telling everybody but me
But I always got a Starbucks verse
Being brewed too hot please please double cup me
They never gave me support like Chuck Ts
And I never trust a nigga saying trust me
Nick cannon and will never did it this ill
So you tell the house band don’t you dare interrupt me
Thanks to my mother for never giving up
You deserve the world, now gon' live it up
Thanks to Uncle Steve, my hero who always saved us
I could never give back everything you gave us

And to my dad even though we was apart
I couldn’t leave you out, you forever in my heart
Yeah, and in the name of Evelyn Sher
I’ll forever forgive anybody that never was there
For me, no other woman could ever compare
My angel, I hope heaven’s prepared for whenever you there

I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario coming through your stereo
Got a new chick, booty round like the merry go
Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go

And I'm takin' out all you bloodsuckers like Blade (aghh!)

Find a more tactical, practical position

While some lay it down I carry the sound with me

In order for this joint right here to sound gritty
We did pre-production in an underground city (yes!)
Wearing post apocalyptic underground gear
Cause we haven't seen natural sunlight in twelve years
I gotta sound astronauts can't wait to hear
So I speak loud enough to reach Space Station Mir
We can take it there in fact, I might order ya
The direction of rap has gotten cornier
It's time to replace the pain with euphoria
Make the crowd jump high like Masai Warriors

Catch wreck like James Bond in Moonraker
Whether flora, fauna, marsupial or mammalia
Test the Last Emp and end up a complete failure

I may not be the most muscular of men
But my songs are strong with the power to pretend
My job to defend against any man who enters
The stage that I call my urban command center
I made it consolidated in just four bars
Place your bets and get out your score cards
My mother always told me to reach for the stars
Now I got the first black-owned business on Mars

Stern firm and young with a laid-back tongue
The aim is to succeed and achieve at 21
Just like Ringling Brothers, I'll daze and astound
Captivate the mass, cause the prose was profound
Do it for the strong, we do it for the meek
Boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your Jeep
Or your Honda, or your Bimmer, or your Legend, or your Benz
The rave of the town to your foes and your friends
So push it, along, trails, we blaze
Don't deserve the gong, don't deserve the praise
The tranquility will make you unball your fist
For we put Hip Hop on a brand new twist
A brand new twist with a whole heap of mystic
So low-key that you probably missed it
And yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd
When the guy takes the beat, they bowed
So raise up squire, adjust your attire
We have no time to wallow in the mire
If you're on a foreign path, then let me do the lead
Join in the essence of the cool-out breed
Then cool out to the music cause it makes you feel serene
With the birds and the bees and all those groovy things
Like getting stomach aches when you gotta go to work
Or staring into space when you're feeling berserk

All through the years my mic has been my best friend
I know some brothers wonder, can Phife really kick it?
Some even wanna diss me, but why sweat it?
I'm all into my music cos it's how I make papes
Try to make hits, like Kid Capri makes tapes
Me sweat another? I do my own thing
Strictly hardcore tracks, not a new jack swing
I grew up as a Christian so to Jah I give thanks
Collect my banks, listen to Shabba Ranks
I sing, and chat, I do all of that
It's 1991 and I refuse to come wack
I take off my hat to other crews that tend to rock
But the Low End Theory's here, it's time to wreck shop
I got Tip and Shah (huh), so whom shall I fear? (Word)
Stop look and listen, but please don't stare (uh)
So jet to the store, and buy the LP (yeah)
On Jive/RCA, cassettes and CD's
Produced and arranged (huh?) by the four-man crew
And oh shit, Skeff Anselm, he gets props too (ha-ha)
Make sure you have a system with some fat house speakers (Yeah)
So the new shit can rock (uh), from Bronx to Massapequa (uh)

I would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and
Help me with my problem, it was never much
Just a trick, to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch
Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man, he was a thug
His name was Lee, he drove a Z
He'd pick her up from school promptly at 3 o' clock
I was on her jock, yes indeedy I wrote graffiti on the bus
First I'd write her name then carve a plus
With my name last, on the looking glass
I seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass

[Chorus]
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on pa--
[Verse 2: SlimKid 3]
When I dream of fairytales I think of me and Shelly
See she's my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me
That I should quit chasin' and look for something better
But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter
I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her
I just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture
I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger
She could be my broad and I could be her nigga
But, all I can do was stare
Back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare
Now she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated
Not at all overrated, I think I need a prayer
To get in her book and it looks rather dry
I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye
Although she's crazy stepping, I'll try and stop her stride
'Cause I won't have no more of this passing me by

[Verse 3: Imani]
Time for me to voice my opinion can't be pretending she didn't have me
Sprung like a chicken, chasing my tail like a doggie
She was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan
Damn, she looked good, downside: she had a man
He was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop
She told me soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop
She was a flake like corn and I was born not to understand
By letting her pass I had proved to be a better man
[Chorus]
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me

[Verse 4: Fatlip]
Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian
And now the world around me begins moving in slow motion when-
Ever she happens to walk by - why does the apple of my eye
Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try?
Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence
And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence
From a distance I desired her, secretly admired her
Wired her a letter to get her
And it went, ""My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me but I know you
Very well now let me tell you about the feelings I have for you
When I try or make some sort of attempt, I simp
Damn I wish I wasn't such a wimp
'Cause then I would let you know that I love you so and if I was your man then I would be true
The only lying I would do is in the bed with you""
Then I signed ""Sincerely, the one who loves you dearly, PS Love Me Tender""
The letter came back three days later: Return to Sender, damn
[Chorus]
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on pa--
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
Passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
(Nevertheless)
(Nevertheless)
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by

She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by

Street Dreams,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop']","[Produced by Tracksmasters]

[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 1]
My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware with one change of gear
Nothing on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
With the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
Dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent 'til proven guilty
I'ma try to get filthy, purchase a club and start up a realty
For real, G, I'ma fulfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my C.R.E.A.M
The first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates, got a crooked eye for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes
God's sake, what a nigga got to do to make a half a million
Without the FBI catching feelings?
[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 2]
From Fat Cat to Pappy, niggas see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holding gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Living with Moms, getting it on, flushing crack down the toilet
Two sips from being alcoholic
Nine-hundred-ninety-nine thou' from being rich
But now, I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel, Argentina coke with the nina
Up in the hotel, smoking on Sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass, yo, the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins
Bitches blow me while hopping in the drop-top BM'
Word is bond, son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this
[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 3]
Growing up project-struck, looking for luck, dreaming
Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing
Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'ing, heard about them old timers OD'ing
Young, early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshiping every word them rope-rocking niggas gave me
The street raised me up giving a fuck
I thought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody
Cut out of class just to smoke blunts and drink noddy
Ain't that funny? Getting put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase, I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel, stressing to pull out of the heat, no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spending, never holding out
[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

Moment of Truth,Gang Starr,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'jazz', 'pop', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","[Intro: Sharon]
No matter what we face
We must face the moment of truth, baby

[Hook 1]
They say it's lonely at the top in whatever you do
You always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
Nobody's invincible, no plan is foolproof
We all must meet our moment of truth

[Verse 1]
The same sheisty cats that you hang with and do your thang with Could set you up and wet you up nigga, peep the language
It's universal, you play with fire it may hurt you
Or burn you, lessons are blessings you should learn through
Let's face facts, although MC's lace tracks
It doesn't mean behind the scenes there ain't no dirt to trace back
That goes for all of us, there ain't nobody to trust
It's like sabotage, it's got me ready to bust
But I can't jeopardize what I have done up to this point
So I'ma get more guys to help me run the whole joint
Cultivate, multiply, motivate or else we'll die
You know I be the master of the who, what, where and why
See when you're shinin', some chumps'll wanna dull ya
Always selfish, jealous punks will wanna pull ya
Down, just like some shellfish in a bucket
'Cause they love it to see your ass squirm like a worm
But just as you'll receive what is comin' to you
Everybody else is gonna get theirs too
I ain't no saint, therefore I cannot dispute
That everyone must meet their moment of truth
[Hook 2]
Actions have reactions, don't be quick to judge
You may not know the hardships people don't speak of
It's best to step back, and observe with couth
For we all must meet our moment of truth

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you gotta dig deep when problems come near
Don't fear, things get severe for everybody everywhere
Why do bad things happen to good people?
Seems that life is just a constant war between good and evil
The situation that I'm facin' is mad amazin'
To think such problems can arise from minor confrontations
Now I'm contemplatin' in my bedroom pacin'
Dark clouds over my head, my heart's racin'
Suicide? Nah, I'm not a foolish guy
Don't even feel like drinkin' or even gettin' high
'Cause all that's gonna do really is accelerate
The anxieties that I wish I could alleviate
But wait, I've been through a whole lot of other shit before
So I oughta be able to withstand some more
But I'm sweatin' though, my eyes are turnin' red and yo
I'm ready to lose my mind, but instead I use my mind
I put down the knife and take the bullets out my 9
My only crime was that I'm too damn kind
And now some scandalous motherfuckers wanna take what's mine
But they can't take the respect that I've earned in my lifetime
And you know they'll never stop the furious force of my rhymes
So like they say, every dog has its day
And like they say, God works in a mysterious way
So I pray, rememberin' the days of my youth
As I prepare to meet my moment of truth
[Interlude]
You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free!

[Verse 3]
Yo, I got one lyric pointed at your head for start
Another one is pointed at your weak-ass heart
Now if I pull the trigger on these fully-loaded lines
You're gonna wish I would've pulled a black 9
I mack dimes, crack the spines of the fake gangsters
Yeah the bitin' triflin' niggas and the studio pranksters
Yo, lookin' at the situation plainly: will you remain, G?
Or will you be looked upon strangely?
I reign as the articulator with the greater data
Revolvin' on the TASCAM much doper than my last jam
While others struggle to juggle tricky metaphors
I explore more to expose the core
A lot of emcees act stupid to me
And we have yet to see if they can match our longevity
But anyway, it's just another day
Another fake jack I slay with my spectac' rap display
Style's smooth but rugged, you can't push or shove it
You dig it and you dug it 'cause like money you love it
The king of monotone, with my own throne
Righteously violent prone, my words bring winds like cyclones
Stormin' your hideout, blockin' out your sunlight
Your image and your business were truly not done right
Throw up your He Allah Now Divine Saviours
You got no hand skills, there's no security to save ya
No pager, no celly, no drop top Benz-y
I came to bring your phony hip-hop to an ending
My art of war will leave you sore from the abuse
'Cause you must meet your moment of truth
[Hook 3]
They say it's lonely at the top in whatever you do
You always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
No one is untouchable, no man is bulletproof
We all must meet our moment of truth"

I'm chillin' with my man Phesto, my man A-Plus
And my man Op', you know he's dope (Yo, yo, yeah)
But right now, y'know, we just maxin' in the studio
We hailin' from East Oakland, California
And, um, sometimes it gets a little hectic out there
(Haha, we just chillin')
But right now, yo, we gon' up you on how we just chill

[Verse 1: Opio]
Dial the seven digits, call up Bridgette
Her man's a midget, plus she got friends, yo, I can dig it
Here's a 40 — swig it, you know it's frigid
I got 'em chillin' in the cooler, break out the ruler
Damn! That's the fattest stoge I ever seen
The weather's keen in Cali
Gettin' weeded makes it feel like Maui
Now we feel the good vibrations
So many females, so much inspiration
[Verse 2: A-Plus]
I get inspired by the blunts too! (Too)
I'll front you (You), if you hang with a bunk crew (Chump)
I roam the strip for bones to pick
When I find one, I'm gon'
Take her home and quickly do this (Yep)
I need not explain this (Nah!)
A-Plus is famous, so get the anus

[Verse 3: Tajai]
Hey, Miss! Who's there? I'm through there
No time to do hair; the flick's at eight, so get straight
You look great, let's grub now
A rubdown sounds flavor, later there's the theatre
(Yeah, that sounds nice)
We in the cut, the cinema was mediocre
Take her to the crib so I can stroke her

Kids get broke for their skins when I'm in
Close range, I throws game at your dip like handball

I'm D to chill from '93 'til

Huh! My black Timbs do me well (Yeah)
When I see a fool and he says he heard me tell (What?)
Another person's busy-ness, I cause dizziness
Until you stop actin' like a silly bitch

[Verse 6: Phesto]
Yo, crews are jealous 'cause we get props
The cops wanna stop our fun, but the top
Is where we're dwellin', swell and fat, no sleep
I work fit, and jerks get their hoes sweeped
Under their noses, this bro's quick
To hit blunts and flip once I'm chillin' ‘cause my crew's close, kid

[Verse 7: Tajai]
I'm posted, most kids accept this as cool
I exit, ‘cause I'm an exception to the rule (Hell no, I'm out)
I'm steppin' to the cool spots where crews flock
To snare a dip, or see where the shit that's flam-bee
Plan B not as poppin'
So I got tons of indo and go to the Owen's basement
My ace been fattenin' up tracks
Time to get prolific with the whiz, kid

[Verse 8: Opio]
Greenbacks in stacks, don't even ask
Who got the fat sacks? We can max pumpin' fat tracks
Exchangin' facts about impacts, ‘cause in facts
My freestyle talent overpowers, brothers can't hack it
They lack wit, we got the mack shit

Rappin', so I take time off to never rhyme soft
I'm off on my own shit with my own clique
Roll many backroads with a fat stoge and blunts, foldin' runts
Holdin' stunts captive with my persona
Plus a bomber, zestin'

Restin' at the mall, attendance on 'noid (Get off!)
But I am shoppin' for my wish to exploit
Some few fits, some new kicks
I often do this, ‘cause it's the pits not bein' dipped

Flipped! The flyer attire females desire
Baby, you can step to this if you admire
The exxx-traordinary dapper rapper
Keep tabs on your main squeeze before I tap her

[Verse 12: A-Plus]
I mack her, attack her with the smoothness
I do this, peepin' what my crew gets, huh! (Shit)
Loot, props, respect, and blunts to pass
Crews talk shit, but in my face, they kiss my ass (Smack!)
They bite flows, but we make up new ones
If you're really dope, why ain't you signed yet?
But I get my loot from Jive/Zomba, I'ma bomb ya
You will see, from now 'til infinity

I'm so wild they call me Four Lokos
So loco, puede... do it for coco
Puff like cocoa, til I'm crisp like Coco
Bonobo, iced tea plus coco
Sunoco flow, no Pinocchio, no BP
Just beat me, meet me where I beat beats, drop street heat
I'm on the block like street meat
Call me Dwight Schrute the way that I eat beats
No beet farm, just pharm beats, smarmy
A motherfucker try to harm me, eh?
I scrap happily, smack a lil'-scrappy-type dude for free
Not for a fee, a Rockfort tee
Or maybe just a cup of tea, had enough of me?
I'm just beginning, finna be a minute 'fore the fat lady singin'
I'm swimmin', I'm crazy, I'm wavy pipeline
Rappers lack flow, now they're trying to bite mine
Need like three life lines,, three wives
Three lines of Vic or white, a night to get hype
Three types of Nikes, my four sides is spiked
My Florsheims is tight,, your punchlines is light
The days of our lives, plus the nights
Catch me on the corner drunk and puking
Crazy stupid, Sami and Lucas!

[Spoken: Heems]
That's a reference to the soap opera Days of Our Lives, even though I was a bigger General Hospital fan growing up

[Verse 2 - Kool AD]
Yeah, see, quit smilin' and shut your silly traps
""These zooted brown weirdos is wildin', but they can really rap!""
They saw the cover of the tape, figured it's pretty wack
Later on eventually admitted that it's pretty crack
Snatched the beer can out your hand like ""Gimme that!""
I'm all up in the freezer at your crib like, ""Where your Jim B at?""
Couple dubbies in the swisher, dougies, and spare me that
Titty fat, jimmy hat, gimme that Similac
Chug it, cut it, print it, I think it's finished but really black
Run it back, tell me if you're feeling that
Ahem, wait a minute like Ray-J
My work is my play-play, every day pay day
Meet me at the mall, it's going down: May Day
Get it? Joke's not the mall, the may say
The joke's not ""meses,"" vajayjays
Hey hey, they say they wanna have my kids like Bebe
No way way, no, bebe, that's eighteen years like 'Ye say
Too much to pay-pay, sweatin' me like Sheneneh

I ain't the 1, definitely not the 2 (nope)
1 in the chamber when we aiming at you (Blaou)
The young Bob Barker, the price is right
If you C.O.D. then you could get them tonight
Put the fish scale on the scale
The boy went postal, all he do is check mail (HA HA)
Low key, under the radar
Triple black 'Vet, yeah I call it the stealth
No currency machine, I could count it myself
Almost done, another quarter million in ones
Thunderstorm in the Body Tap, look what I've done
Chump change, I make it rain for fun (whassup)

I take it back to the block, back to the kitchen, back to the pots

I get them bars out of the back of my mind (that's how)
I reminisce like Mary J
Even in the drought, the boy kept that yay
100 percent certain, Snowman was workin'
You can blame my plug and my clientele (why)
I'm addicted to that new car smell
White cookies in a plastic bag
New shoes on the coupe with the paper tag
Whole life flash right before your eyes
See the state troopers and get butterflies
Got a thing for them Heckler and Koches
Mini 14s and rolex watches
Somewhere in the back of my sick and deranged brain
I get a rush when I talk that 'cane
Get money, nigga fuck them haters
All we fear is the discovery and indictment papers (whassup)

I'm a grown ass man, I stand on my own two
200,000 cash, yeah, I'm buying my own team
Right to your front door, operation so sweet
I like little dude who keeps his money so neat
But I still bury a nigga
Put the mask on, Jim Carrey a nigga (Blaou)
Suede ends in the Chevy, got me feelin awkward
Careful with the sweets, dont burn my seats
You could live your whole life and not come close
Guess thats why these rap niggas take notes
Recite my adlibs, borrow my quotes
Make me IHOP a nigga, serve them with the toast
Next, they be dressing like me
But back in '93, they wasn't stressing like me (whassup)

Im A Go Getta,Lil Wayne,"['hip hop', 'alternative']","[Intro]
Michael Phelps, this for you, baby!

[Verse 1]
I'm goin' for the gold, my heart is in control
My mind is on succeed and I am in the lead
Don't buy into the schemes, the science or strategy
Just giant N-U-Ts brings triumph and belief
I'm a lion or a dean, inspired by the green
Never tired or fatigued, never defiant to my team
Never lying on the thing until I'm lying on the thing
Hooked to wires and things; I'ma die as a king
If I don't do it now, I'ma try it again
And when I do accomplish it, I'ma try it again
I'm a riot, insane; I'm a lion, my mane
Hangs down to my strings and they're tied to the game
I stay dry when it rain, I'm tired of the fame
Got everything to gain and I'm proud of the pain
The pride and the plain, the wise and the strange
Denied by the sane; besides, we're the same
Who's guiding the train? Who's flyin' the plane?
Who's driving the lane? Who dies when it bang?
Who fires when it bang? Who lies in the aim?
Two lives in the drain; who cries when they sang?
You hide but you can't; you high but you ain't
I advise you to think; you'll find what you can't
Revive what you taint, survive what you paint
Super-size what you shrank: the fries and the drank
Admired as a saint, defined by my rank
Combined with my strength, my time and my length
I'ma iron out the kinks; yes, I'm on the brink
And in the eye of my wink, I'ma retire in the bank
[Chorus]
Yeah, and I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
And I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, I'm gon get it
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, yeah
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta

[Verse 2]
Victory consistantly
Train all year to be the enemy's misery
No stress visibly, neither does it enter me
I think positively; you can't harm me mentally
Not physically, not spiritually; you'll never get rid of me
I am the epitome of ""this is what you did to me""
Nothin's what you did for me, nothin's what you give to me
I take whatever I'm visualizing, now break all of the limiting
Now shake all of the gimicking, the fakery, the trickery
""Nurse, how sick is he?"" ""Worse, I am sickening!""
I'll be at the finish line first, ""how quick is he?""
I'ma make sure they mention me for the next century
I ain't with the bickering, I am full of dignity
I am full of energy, pull out the inner me
Or bull after dinner meat, I stood in the winter heat
It could be the end of me, but good be defending me
[Chorus]
Yeah, and I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
And I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, I'm gon get it
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, yeah
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta

[Verse 3]
I'm allergic to cheatin'
I hate failure and I'm in love with achievement
Above and beneath it, a hug when I greet it
My eyes on the prize and I love when I seek it
Done with the speakin', begun with the preachin'
Now pray, until I am one with the deacon
Now play, until I have won whatever we win
I play, until I have won, and then I re-win

[Chorus]
Yeah, and I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
And I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta

Burner in school, in my bookbag, hid
Talk stupid at lunch, and we having your ribs
If you are not home, then we having your kids
And if you can't come up with half, I'll send you half of your kid
Back to the balling, extravagant crib
I'm on the toilet watching Martin, just laughing and shit
Don't know why I get high, but I get high
I get high, like, every single day
You do shit that them other women can't
Mary Jane, what is it you done to me? Yeah

No doubt, no doubt son, I got this, I got this
Just watch my back, I got the front, yo
Check it out now
Word up, say it to them niggas, check this out it's a murder

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
I got you stuck off the realness, we be the infamous
You heard of us, official Queensbridge murderers
The Mobb comes equipped for warfare, beware
Of my crime family who got 'nough shots to share
For all of those who wanna profile and pose
Rock you in your face, stab your brain with your nose bone
You all alone in these streets, cousin
Every man for they self in this land we be gunnin'
And keep them shook crews runnin', like they supposed to
They come around, but they never come close to
I can see it inside your face, you're in the wrong place
Cowards like you just get they whole body laced up
With bullet holes and such
Speak the wrong words, man, and you will get touched
You can put your whole army against my team and
I guarantee you it'll be your very last time breathin'
Your simple words just don't move me
You're minor, we're major
You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player
Don't make me have to call your name out
Your crew is featherweight, my gunshots'll make you levitate
I'm only nineteen, but my mind is old
And when the things get for real, my warm heart turns cold
Another nigga deceased, another story gets told
It ain't nothin' really, ayo Dun, spark the Philly
So I can get my mind off these yellow-backed niggas
Why they still alive? I don't know, go figure
Meanwhile back in Queens the realness and foundation
If I die, I couldn't choose a better location
When the slugs penetrate, you feel a burnin' sensation
Gettin' closer to God in a tight situation now
Take these words home and think it through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you
[Chorus]
Son, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look
Livin' the life that of diamonds and guns
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
So some get shot, locked down, and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook, son, he's just a shook one

[Verse 2: Havoc]
For every rhyme I write it's twenty-five to life
Yo, it's a must, in gats we trust, safeguardin' my life
Ain't no time for hesitation, that only leads to incarceration
You don't know me, there's no relation
Queensbridge and we don't play
I don't got time for your petty-thinkin' mind
Son, I'm bigger than those
Claimin' that you pack heat, but you're scared to hold
And once the smoke clears, you'll be left with one in your dome
Thirteen years in the projects—my mentality is what, kid?
You talk a good one, but you don't want it
Sometimes I wonder, do I deserve to live?
Or am I gonna burn in Hell for all the things I did?
No time to dwell on that, 'cause my brain reacts
Front if you want, kid, lay on your back
I don't fake jax, kid, you know I bring it to you live
Stay in a child's place, kid, you out of line
Criminal minds thirsty for recognition
I'm sippin', E&J got my mind flippin'
I'm buggin', diggin' my ways out of holes by hustlin'
Get that loot, kid, you know my function
'Cause long as I'm alive, I'ma live illegal
And once I get on, I'ma put on all my peoples
React quick, spit lyrics like MACs, I hit your dome up
When I roll up, don't be caught sleepin', 'cause I'm creepin'

Son, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
(We live the life that of diamonds)
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Livin' the life that of diamonds and guns

See, I believe in money, power and respect
First you get the money, then you get the motherfuckin' power
After you get the fuckin' power, motherfuckers will respect you (What's the key to life?)

[Chorus: Lil Kim]
Money, power and respect what you need in life
Money, power and respect, you'll be eatin' right
Money, power and respect, you can sleep at night
You'll see the light, what's the key to life?

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch & Lil Kim]
Ayo, my whole clique 'bout it, 'bout it
We take yours while you pout about it
Truck, step out, the whores wanna crowd around it
You could see me on Optimum TV
Go in your bathroom turn the light out
Scream, ""Bloody Mary, 1, 2, 3""
Sheek ain't your usual friend
But I could set you up like Keyser and walk straight at the end
I'm done with ice and charms
I'm tryna ice my whole casket when I'm gone
Pull up with class on the don, once I meet 'em I greet 'em
Kiss his feet for freedom, tell em' thank you Lord
'Cause on Earth I was gettin' bored
Now resurrect me back to this cat called Sheek
So I can make this album and get back the cats that's weak
Two-thirty, six two
Me budge for you? That's like a cat vers' a pitbull
Gun, know clip full, keep hunger
And plan for the future, 'cause you figure you gon' be older
Way longer than you gon' be younger (What's the key to life?)

[Verse 2: Styles P & Lil Kim]
Only time could tell how the clock tick
I'm really loved here, but I'm still a hostage
Two personalities, check the posture
Smoke out the mouth clear out the nostrils
Think of death, then life seem scary
I'm passin' graveyards seein' people Hail Mary
I ain't chillin' 'til I'm out parachutin'
Race my man in mountain climbin' for about ten diamonds
Twenty five thousand a piece, fuck streets
Tryin' to own the island, forget about wildin'
Try ridin' in the car that be glidin'
If I showed you where I lived, you would think I was hidin'
Sling dick to chicks that don't speak English
Wake up in Trinidad like, ""Fuck it, I'm rich""
Come back, private jet, live on set
If you can shit gold, then I can spit baguettes (What's the key to life?)

Nothin' but the hotness whenever we drop this
Monotonous for y'all to keep hatin' 'cause y'all never gon' stop us
I keep my rocks spotless and my hoes topless
Take time, try to figure out who The Lox is
Fear no one, kick rhymes like shoguns
You scared to blow one, get robbed with your own gun
If I don't respect you I'ma check you
And if I don't kiss you I'ma peck you
Right before I wet you I sneeze on tracks and bless you
I'm special and if you like workin' out then I'm gon' stretch you
Hustlin' is dead, but we still get red
Turn the spots into bakeries to get back bread
And y'all said my money's spent, but it's in the Bent'
So when the Feds come, the dogs can't get a scent
And my story, self-explanatory
That I'm the hottest thing on the street
And y'all ain't got nothin' for me (What's the key to life?), yeah

This is a beat that I can freak to, just drop the reels
Bless a nigga with the ill, y'all niggas know my skills
X in their grills, hit 'em up, split 'em up
Wet 'em up and watch 'em come get 'em up
Set em' up, when you do dirt, you get dirt
Bitch, I'll make your shit hurt, step back like, ""I did work""
This ain't no fuckin' game, what, you think I'm playin'?
'Til you layin' somewhere in the junkyard decayin'
Moms at home prayin' that you comin' home, but you not
'Cause you sittin' up in the trunk, startin' to rot
And hell is hot, I know because I'm here now, baby
It's goin' down, baby, get the four pound, baby
And let off up in a nigga
Especially if he think he bigger than my motherfuckin' trigger
Dead eye, can I get mine? Is he gone?
DMX representin' one time, put us on (What's the key to life?)

I take a sack to the face whenever I can
Fuck a crutch; I be smoking that shit
Til the joint be burning my hand
Next time I roll it in a Tampa
To burn slow so the ashes won't be burning up my hand, brah
Hoes want to hit but they know they got to pitch in
Then, I roll a joint that's longer than your extension
Cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free
Fuck that, you better bring your own shit chief
Wassup, don't babysit that
You better pass the joint
Nigga stop hitting cause you know you got asthma
Crack a 40 open homie and guzzle it
Cause I know the weed in my system is getting lonely
I gotta take a piss test for my P.O
I know I failed cause I done smoked hella weed, bro
An every time we with Chris
That nigga rollin' up a fatty
But the Tanqueray straight had me
[Dru Down]
Lit to the fullest extreme
There was getting no higher
That shit had my chest on fire
Dru Down was swigging to the face straight
But I ain't fuckin with that
I think I'll stick to the crazy 8's
Bring me a bottle and I'm cool with that
I'mma a lounge with that
Nigga bring me a phat sack

Only the town, nigga
Eh man quit hogging up the joint, man you babysitting it
What you talking about?
Pass that shit over here
[Verse 3: Yukmouth]
Player, give me some brew and I might just chill
But I'm the type that likes to light another joint like Cypress Hill
I steal doobies, spit loogies when I puff on it
I got some bucks on it
But it ain't enough on it
Fuck with the S the T, I-D-E-S
Nevertheless I'm hella fresh
Rolling joints like a cigarette
So pass it cross the table like ping-pong
I'm gone, beating my chest like King Kong
It's on, wrap my lips around a 40
And when it comes to get another stogie
Niggas all kick in like Shinobi
Nummy ain't my homie to begin with
It's too many heads to be popping to let my friend hit shit
Unless you pull out the phat crispy
5 dollar bill on the real before its history
Cause niggas be having them vacuum lungs
An if you let em hit it for free
You hella dum-da-dum-dum!
I come to school with the Taylor on my earlobe
Avoiding all the dick-teasers
Skeezers and weirdos
That be fuckin' off the land like ""Where tha bomb at?""
Give me 2 bucks, you take a puff and pass my bomb back
Suck up the dank like a Slurpee
The serious bomb will make a nigga go delirious like Eddie Murphy
I got more Growing Pains than Maggie
Cause niggas nag me
To take the dank out of the baggie"

Haha, the remix - 5 on it!
We creepin' in too, baby
We got 5 on ery'thang mane!
We got Dru Down; we got the Luniz! Shock G, wassup?
Numskull and Yukmouth! Richie Rich, E-40, Spice 1

[Verse 1: Dru Down]
You say you got 5 on my tender, you can bend her over the table
But be sure that you bring my stallion back to my stable
Say, brah? No elementary school-ground playing
Not a 5-dollar bill, but 5-double-zero on the real, feel?
I'm on the level, staying mellow
No criticism from the fellows, hello
Being keyed during a high-speed but still don't tap the B.B.'s
I'm D.D., Dru Down, baby

[Verse 2: Numskull]
Like Nyquil, I drop fevers
So either put your 5 up, or you gots to ""Leave It"" like ""Beaver""
'Cause see, a nigga perpin' broke'll smoke your spliff all day
Go home and buy big drinky with his briddy then parlay
I got 5 on the Hennessy, Seagram's, or 40's
'Cause ""This is How We Do It"" like Montell Jordan
I'm from the Oakland City, Frank Nitti is a goner
Num' blowing it up like Oklahoma
[Verse 3: Richie Rich]
Put your feev' with my fin, best believe we'll bend
More corners than you thought 'til something right is bought
More z-zags? Believe that: tokin!
Where you from? Oakland! Smokin'
In attempts to crack the chestplate
The zips be so fluffy the whole town loves me
At every event I'm sacked up
So if you need me, scream ""Double R!"" when you see me

I got five on it (""got it good!"")
Grab your 4, let's get keyed
I got 5 on it
Messing with that indo weed!
I got 5 on it; it's got me stuck, and I’m tore back
I got 5 on it: partna let's go half on a sack!

[Verse 3: E-40]
""E-40, why you treat me so bad?"" 40 makes it happen
Fosgate slappin' and revenue grows
From just a little bit of lightweight flamboastin'
Potent fumes, lingering mighty clouds and Northern Lights
You disrespect Vic da Baron
And you'll be violating my civil rights
I'm starting to feel my scrilla
But perhaps today my scrilla ain't feeling me
For the simple fact that I'm off to the track with hella fools, B
Pockets empty, pitching 5, man I'm dusted
Took off my hat, passed it around, man sprinkle me
[Verse 4: Yukmouth]
Me and E-40 to the head, comin' fed plus, you let the lead bust
Ready to do a murda, mayn; perved off the Hurricane
Slurred again, witness what bein' off two-fifths equal
Me killin' people like Jason, facin' death every sequel
(Insane in the membrane!) ""Bring the Pain"" like Method
Neglected, smokin' kryptonite to the brain for breakfast
Guzzle the Hen-do, finsta do the evil that men do
Give me feev', I shall proceed to continue

Yeah, it's been a while since I've hollered from the town
Mess around and heard Yuk' and Num', said I gotta be down
'Cause new styles is going down—look around you
Tunes from the Lunz spreading round and round you

Verse 6: [Shock G as Humpty Hump]
Back to get my O on, they let me flow on
The thirty-five on it, yeah, I'm on it
Still bringing satin for them drawers
Velvet for the mic and got a pound for the cause
[Verse 6: Spice 1]
Rolling up cannabis sativa, hitting the Mary Jane
Smoking the 5 before it's 12 o'clock, sipping on Hurricane
Ready to smoke on the indo
Rolling up my window, finna to go to the land
With a handful of broccoli
When it comes to the sticky I'm the man
Crush nasty, I be hitting the J so hard I hurl
Fall on the floor fittin' to have a stroke
T-H-C ain't no joke
I got 5 on ery'thing, let's get loaded and smoke
S-P-I-C-E about to hit it and croak

Grab your 4, let's get keyed

Yeah, wassup baby?
It's me, your boy with the cape that's always tight
You a little short on some ends?
Don't worry, I'll take care of that, I got 5 on that

Drive Slow Remix Music Video Version,Kanye West,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie Mali used to stay, 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'll leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin', sixteen, he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then, if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin 'em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog
Fuck all that flirtin', I'm tryin' to get in some drawers
So, put me on with these hoes homie
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie
[Hook: Kanye West]
Drive slow homie
Drive slow
You never know homie, about these hoes homie
You need to pump ya brakes and drive slow homie

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
What it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk waving
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazing
Them elbows pokin' wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fours crawlin'? You see them screens fallin'?
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hard-hitter, all about the scrilla
Ridin' somethin' candy-coated, crawlin' like a caterpillar
I'm tipping on them fours, I'm jammin' on this Screw
I'm looking for them hoes baby, what it do? Drive slow homie

[Interlude: GLC & Kanye West]
Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes (drive slow homie)
If you're ridin' round the city with nowhere to go (drive slow homie)
Live today, cause tomorrow, man, you never know
You never know homie, might need some hoes homie
You need to pump ya brakes and drive slow homie
[Verse 3: GLC & Kanye West]
My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TV's in here than where I live
And that don't make no sense, but baby I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's something serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics, baby this evidence
You see a player flicking and how you ain't convinced
That you should gon kiss it, just a lil bit
I wear my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin' like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smokin' on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin' on Vogues
My cylinder quiet like tip-toes
I sold O's and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil homie drive slow

(Tony Williams harmony ad-libs)

[Verse 4: T.I.]
Looking at life through my rearview, all the problems I had
Could be seen a lot clearer after time had passed
Known for living so fast, they wonder how he don't crash
With 220 on the dash, and he constantly mashin'
""Why don't he slow down?"" they be constantly askin'
But me and the fast lane is like metal and magnets
Now I ain't trying to say that this the way of the masses
But it's so hard to change, I love this shit with a passion
Since me and C were cuttin' class, and showin' our ass
Shooting out in broad day in the middle of traffic
I remember sellin' crack faster than I could bag it
Just sharin' my past with you, shawty, I ain't e'en braggin'
Me and Cap got life, them other folk got blasted
Had a partner O.D. and after this all happened
Life the only thing that kept a pimp from crying and laughing
Then the Lord smiled on me at the end of the madness
I never thought that I'da made it this far rappin'
For introducing the youth to what we now call ""trappin'""
Considered now a classic, who'd've imagined?
Me in Milano getting models in next year's fashion
So nowadays, they can call me old-fashioned
But it's way too much cash to see blue lights flashin'
So I guess the moral of this here class is:
Life about who make it, not about who make it the fastest
Drive slow homie
[Outro: Kanye West (Chopped & Screwed)]
Yeah, bumpa bumpa bump bump
Drive slow homie
Drive slow homie
You never know homie, might need some hoes homie
You need to pump ya brakes and drive slow homie
Drive slow homie"

Whoaaa....yeah, it's your boy Jumpoff Beezy a.k.a. Regular Joe a.k.a. That Dude
Shout out to all the mixtape DJs and shit
Stack, what up nigga
Webb, turn my vocals up a little bit
See, what we gonna do is we gonna rhyme like the other niggas and shit
With the bullshit rhymes, putting a whole bunch of words together just because
And niggas is really listening to that shit like, ""Yo, he's hot""......NOT
I think niggas might have forgot what the word ""hot"" is
Fucking with all these metaphor niggas with the bullshit like
""I'm flat like plasma""
""I smoke like forest fires"" and all this dumb shit
""I'm cool like AC's""
""I bang like bangers""...ha...some dumb shit
SO.....we gonna have to teach niggas how to rap again
Niggas might have forgot -- go ahead and help them out
We recording?...... ARE WE RECORDING???
All right -- just making sure, man

Its, its, its that on top music!!!
[Verse 1]
Ok, moving on now -- we done with the no names
Now put the purple in the air like soul plane
Point blank when hammers is out
I'll have it right up on your skin -- it's like the plastic on your grandma couch
In the hood somebody's telling, cops cuff and arresting
So its somebody else besides Usher confessing
Spray y'all clip team
Y'all broke but the day y'all get cream is the day y'all meet the AR-15
Jason Bourne niggas sent right after a guy
The dudes that say word to they seed right after they lie
So when I spot 'em or see 'em
I'mma play the graveyard realtor in charge of every mausoleum
Buying 900 gallons of dip
In the crib the living room wall is 900 gallons of fish
The block is fucked up, my son's feeling is helpless
I see why everybody in slum village is selfish..nigga

[Verse 2]
Hard to imagine the game without me
Even mixtapes just ain't been the same without me
And anytime beef is on or the heat is on
I'm on some Nelly shit in New Jerz, getting my Eagle on
Niggas wanna rep, better watch your back
Even little niggas is jumping now they Robert Pack
And there's great artists out the struggling to get a joint across
While wack niggas need nine minutues to get a point across
When will you cowards learn, though?
I only fuck chicks looking like they off the Howard Stern Show
I love when black youths do they numbers and all
Make hits to make them little kids run to the store
But its like rappers ain't got no hunger at all
And niggas' albums don't leave you with a hunger for more
Say Joe, leave it alone -- accept it, they lost
But I'm a addict -- got a problem with beating a dead horse, nigga
[Outro]
Simple, man...see...two way ya boy next time you drop, man
No more mixtapes hit the street without the kid on them
Thats how we gonna do, y'all must've forgot like Roy Jones
That's one of then wack metaphors niggas be using, too
Yo, I'm hot like the sun
I am cooler than the other......oh yeah, nigga said that
YOU AIN'T COOLER THAN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PILLOW, NIGGA"

So, first of all, we gonna work on the stomach
Nobody wants a little tight ass

[Verse 1]
One, and two, and three, and four, and get them sit ups right, and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop, breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son, don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh, she's so excited
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick
(Ah!) What's scary to me is
Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came, I came, I came
[Chorus]
It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothing to talk about
Unless she's talking about freaking out
Then maybe we can work it out
Work it out, work it out
Work it out, work it out now
Maybe we can work it out

[Verse 2]
Ooh, girl, your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set, Twista said ""Get It Wet""
Ooh girl your breath is harsh!
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Off them tracks yea I bought them cars
Still, kill a nigga on 16 bars
We ain't sweating to the oldies, we juking to a cold beat
Maybe one day girl we can bone
So you can brag to all your homies now
But I still mess with a big girl, if you ain't fit, girl, I'll still hit, girl
One and, you brought two friends, ok, three more now hop in the Benz
Four door: do you know the difference between a five, six, seven, eight?
All the Mocha Lattes, you gotta do Pilates
You gotta pop this tape in before you start back dating
Hustlers, gangstas, all us ballas
[Chorus]
It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothing to talk about
Unless she's talking about freaking out
Then maybe we can work it out
Work it out, work it out
Work it out, work it out now
Maybe we can work it out

Seventeen a brick, yeah, run and tell 'em that
I got the wamp wamp, when I move it, it's still damp
Mildew-ish, I heat it, it turns bluish
It cools to a tight wad, the Pyrex is Jewish

I'ma tell y'all a lil' story man,you know I'm sayin'?
Yo this is a song about, somebody who did me wrong dawg
I thought you was my homie man.. I guess not
Fuck it

[Verse]
You was supposed to be my dawg
Homie, when I first met you, what was told to me was fraud
What a shocker, an imposter! I've been crossed, I lost ya
My best friend turned out to be an enemy that's endin' me
Hidden, no sympathy, no empathy either; homie, I never denied ya!
Nuttin' that you wanted: women? I never player-hated
I hooked you up, booked you up from the beginning
This enemy had love for you, shared blood for ya
When ya wanted to dig? I dug for ya, nigga
But you a double-crosser, nasty hand-tosser
I shoulda known you was evil
When you told me you was cool 'fore we'd be sex fools when we under the steeple
The retrieval: I'm tryna get my life back
No more stoppin' women from puttin' a knife at ya cap
Remember when we was kickin' it? Bitches was givin' it everyday
We did it in every way, but the respect went away
You got a mind of your own now; you're grown now
Can I ask you a question? Did you forget we kinfolks, nigga?
We the same complexion! I'm stressin'!
You was always in front of me so I listened
Everyday you wanted me on a mission
I even let you have sex with my lady like a G
Infatuated with you and not me
I sucked it up, I got back wit' her, you fucked it up
By lettin' her know I was creepin' around with every chick in the town, buster!
I shoulda known not to trust ya!
Listen, I'm losin' my life because of you!
I lost my life because of you! I'm losin' my wife because of you!
I even had sex and a baby with the crazy bitch you introduced me to!
Now I'm straight depressed, I hate your flesh
But fate was just belate to Tech, laid to rest
Every time you got drawers, you made my poor little life fall nigga, ya got balls
You ain't never had a partner like me
Real, I never ever sold ya pipe dreams
Personal? Yes, it might seem
Nigga when you was burnin', I went and got the Doxycycline
Looked out for ya health, and this is all the respect I get?
Hater, ya neck I'll slit, but I can't, 'cause I'm attached to ya
And I don't know why, sometimes I wish you would just die
It would eliminate all this hurt
Maybe I could get up outta all this dirt ya caused me
So strong, nothing could stop you, not even cerebral palsy
I can't believe it; my best homie turned on me
You musta forgot we grew up together
I'm through, life is over now, there's nothin' else to do
Point the finger and blame it on you
[Tech + (sung)]
(It's all because of you, you, you)
I lost my girl, my world, is upside down because I found you wasn't shit
(It's all because of you, you, you)
Broke us in two, you untrue, don't know what to do, I'm talkin' to you (who?)

Now I'ma need you to kill the hypocrisy, this is an aristocracy

What's up with who? That's old news
I'm in a speedboat, in my boat shoes
Huh? I swear my whole collection's so cruise
I might walk in Nobu with no shoes
""He just walked in Nobu like it was Whole Foods
That nigga crazy, I told you""
Immature adult, insecure asshole
If you fall on the concrete, that's your ass fault
If you pass on a Kan' beat, that's your last fault
Get what you ask for, I swear that your ass slow
She got a big booty but she couldn't drop it as low
'Til you take your last ho and rope up all the cashflow
When you gettin' money they be all up on your ass, yo
When you gettin' money cops don't let a nigga pass, go
Straight to jail yo, in a hellhole

Ask if I'ma be there soon and tell him I said ""Hell no""

End up at Marni, Giorgio, service from Sergio Tacchini

I know the flow just hit a hellified vertical
This the Christ year, last year was magic: 32
Lyrically, can’t none of y’all murder Ye
'Cause y’all raps ain’t got no vertebrae
I got style, ask June if she heard of me
I killed the fur last Paris, raised the murder rate
First of all, we all know the beats is
Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Every one of His Majesty’s swim parties is pageantries
Cannonball off the divin' board when I am bored
All my homies GDs, but I am Lord

And this life too crazy to think logically
Here’s somethin' that you could use as an analogy
My life is like a child’s illusions become reality

Keep frontin', you'll be duckin from these huntin' obese gunmen
Airing out these fuckin' MCs puffin', so breath some in
See each one of my words is just stunningly stern
And it's funny you learn through action, not example
That's exactly why I have to smack you
Learn that {smack, smack} Learn it again {smack} got it now?
Didn't ya know that Tonedeff can flow fast enough to mow Sonic down?
Well, I'm on it; shower your senses, power defenses up
If you don't wanna get offended, or else it's death and
A negative attendance in the census when I render you senseless
I'm the veteran that was sent with a vengeance
That's leaving you with a set of bent wrists
And a dented cleft chin, left with a horsejaw
Prolly gonna need a veterinarian or a dentist
Better get a move on; call U-Haul and troop on to Sioux Falls
With blue balls; you all really think you're ill?
Until we're just sharing the bill with you all and we're too raw
Who's stalling? Cause I done never held it back man
Step or take your last stand while we enact raps to packed jams
Idiot niggas, figure they're quicker 'til the maniac
Is leaving them with one shoulder missing like it's Flashdance
Can't stand these motherfuckers that can't rap
Tonedeff and Stan, instrumental like Sam Ash
Fuck a bitch until her pussy cat naps
Y'all niggas are pretty in pink
And you been chillin with the Brat Pack
Fact is, my stats kick your ass bitch
You're too average to consider surpassing
The task is tedious, really, this beat is just feeding me
You thought Gonzalez was Speedy!

Do you feel the need for speed?
Indeed ya do, we need ya to
Clear the way to speed ya through
Can you feel the velocity? Just hold tight
Bare witness to what future emcees will flow like

You're wacker than Ja Rule, we fast and furious like Vin Diesel
Ink penetrates the papyrus, my pen's lethal
Sookie, Sookie you rookie; goodie, goodie, we been evil
Fuck one-on-one! Tone and I take ten people
To even up the odds cause you and your friends feeble
Styles been played like movies with ten sequels
(Do you love hip-hop?) Does Eminem offend people?
Well, so do we, so absolutely nothing's what you're showing me
Vocally magnificent; what you want is insignificant
In the big picture, bitch nigga, you're so sensitive
Gonna squirt some, I hurt one or two persons before the verse done
Your mom be sucking the girth numb, beat it up and made her cum
E Famm making you nerds run; when I get the mic, it's curtains
If you don't like it when your earth's done blow me homey
Hold that mouth full of cock sauce and a bozack
UV and E til I got wack that's never homey know that

Say what you want, but don't ever claim that you want it
Stay in the closet or you'll sustain so much pain
That you'll vomit solid objects you never swallowed
Like hollow organs, you'll cough up dried esauphagus knots and notches
We're the marvelous two that are part of the crew
That came to astonish, The Plague is brolic
Scrape your face with abrasive cleanser, say that we're raining comet
Fame's a promise you'll never fulfill, I'll just set up the kill
Substantial lances in your neck, and then sets your head on a hill
Really, for the world to see, everybody wanna get busy
Until they really gotta twirl with me; I score with ease
And floor your team I'm sure you dream of fuckin'
If weren't for your ball disease, you'd prolly skeez a broad or three
But all of 'em see that you ain't nothing but a poor MC
So, if you're looking for your pride, and a reason to die
In the blink of an
Eye, then keep in mind that they all with me
Now, hold your screams in, you don't wanna play in the court
The kings in From Newport to Kingston
I'll give you more defeats in wars than Normandy
Complete with hordes of soldiers beefin'
Keep your orders straight, cause sweepin me is more than fate could even orchestrate
Erasin more pieces of you than your whore's abortion takes

[Verse 4 - Substantial]
(Substantial, why you rap so slow?) I got asthma
Give me a second... lets see if I can rap faster
I'm smarter, harder; spit quicker, stronger
Even my dick's bigger, longer
In fact it sucks to be you, but what can we do?
You're a weaker, sweeter, poster-boy wussie
Who needs a hug cause you're pussy
You stank pot, thou reek of skank twat
My speech is flame; hot E weak? I think not
We link and bang spots, we drink to slain cops
Who were crooked; the little props I got? I fucking took it
Then spat on my doubters and shattered these cowards' glass jaws
By ripping up rap tours, whether little or no audience
Killed it a capella, even killed it to accordions
Not a battle rapper, backpacker, bitch-smacker thug
Just someone who could whip your ass but would rather show you love
So any further sleeping on me is not recommended
We'll never be fam if you haven't already been befriended

An arsenic writer, author with arth-r-itis
Carpal tunnel, Marshall with Start-Shit-Itis
Hardheaded and hotheaded, bullheaded and pigheaded
Dick-headed, a prick, a big headache
I'm sick, quick-witted; for every lyric spitted
There are six critics who wait for me to slip with it
So, quick—this dynamite stick, bury the wick
It's gonna explode any minute
Some lunatic lit it
And it's not Nelly, do not tell me to stop yelling
When I stop selling, I'll quit, so stop dwelling!
I am not failing, you fuckers are not ready
‘Cause I got jelly, like Beyoncé's potbelly
This is destiny; yes, money, I'm off running
So get off of me, I'm not slowing or softening

[Hook]
No apologies! Nah, suckers, I'm not sorry
You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies! Y'all feeling the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
Nah, no apologies! Not even acknowledging you at all
'Til I get a call that God's coming
No apologies! Laugh, fuckers, it's all funny
I can spit in your face while you're standing across from me
No apologies!
[Verse 2]
My head hits the pillow, a weeping willow
I can't sleep, a pain so deep, it bellows
But these cellos help just to keep me mellow
Hands on my head, touch knees to elbows
I'm hunched over, emotion just flows over
These cold shoulders are both frozen, you don't know me
I keep saying it, I can't stress it enough
So keep playing it, and stand next to the subs
I choke mics like asphyxiation
When I'm strangling my own throat masturbating, haha!
Fuck, yeah, I'm a basket case
And I'll master this rap shit 'til my ass gets wasted
'Til my assassination
'Til I'm slain 'cause of some fag's infatuation
.44 mag's a fascination
A taste for disaster, and if that's the case, then—

[Hook]
No apologies! Nah, suckers, I'm not sorry
You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies! Y'all feeling the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
Nah, no apologies! Not even acknowledging you at all
'Til I get a call that God's coming
No apologies! Laugh, fuckers, it's all funny
I can spit in your face while you're standing across from me
No apologies!
[Verse 3]
This song isn't for you, it's for me
A true MC, it's what he'll do just to see
If he still has it and if his skills mastered
He's able to spill raps long after he's killed, that's a—
Real MC, got you feelin' me
Whether willing or unwillingly, you still agree
As long as there's still this hunger and will in me
Then expect a longer life expectancy
I'd be a savage beast If I ain't had this
Outlet to salvage me inside
I'd be exploding, soaked in self-loathing
And mourning, so I'm warning you: Don't coax me
It's silly, I’m really a sheep in wolf's clothing
Who only reacts when he gets pushed, don't be—
Fooled; the press blows up this whole thing
It's stupid, they don't know, ‘cause they don't see
That I'm wounded, all they did was ballooned it
I'm sick of talking 'bout these tattoos Cartoon did
That's why I tuned it out, I'm sick of duking
And they can suck my dick while I'm puking
And you, too, you can—

[Outro]
Expect no sympathy from me
I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my heart's frozen
It don't even beat, so expect no apologies
Expect no sympathy from me
I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my heart's frozen
It don't even beat, so expect no apologies"

I hit heavy in the trunk so I say I'm heavy hittin'
My car just got a Jheri curl the paint's still drippin'
My whip so clean I turn lovers into haters
Then I make 'em come around like curl activator
There are none greater; I'm the freshest on the scene
Rap gaming Jones I'm the freshest on the team
But really I'm a coach spitting game to the players
And I'm yellow with that purp like I came with the Lakers
I'm out to get that paper, the mule and the acres
I'm repping for the rich, red, monkey bathing apers
So catch a contact like you inhaled Luda vapors
Cause rappers get smoked like I rolled in some paper
Put 'em in a ash tray throw away the roaches
Move them out my pathway show them who's the dopest
I bring home the bacon and protect it with the toasters

Another 20 in the right
Got my wallet in the back

Credit cards don't need 'em
All the birds won't feed 'em
While I'm sitting at the table just me and family eatin'
E-class on the cell; discussing another mill'
Gucci Gucci bottle empty, daddy needs a refill
Up in frevay I'm standing on the bar
If it ain't a black truck it's a quarter million Maz'
I'm in love with kush and Kate Fox

Outta town for a month
Came home with a duffel that was one point something

Got the streets on fire like raw scalps with a perm
I'm big worm and that big body slayer
Rip it open and you keep playing with my money
Smoke it like I'm a joke
I go for broke on the boulevard
In the paint and have a bitch nigga sliced from his eyes to his tank
You think I came at 225 pounds of trouble
Can't find a triller nigga than me if you had the Hubble
I been repping the dirty and I ain't finna to slow down
So if you ain't with it get out the way it's about to go down
You can get your issue like your ass subscribed
And when we ride there's nowhere that your ass can hide

Have you running up north like a runaway slave
Played pussy your bluff even if it's your period

Opus of a ghetto boy who grew into a project man
Brewster Place, he used to stick his scissors in his sockets damn
Clear that Project Runway
Cause this is where my rocket lands
Ain’t got no problems, Houston
I A.K.A. then rocket land
Events recent that lit a fire under him like pots and pans
Rockets and I up in the sky like helicopter cams
And you down there in the traffic jam
From here I’ve seen a bunch of fake shit like avid wrestling fans
Came up from the bottom of the eye exam zoom
Now I’m like the biggest G up in the room
Still hard to see me like the truth on TV
Or the roof from the sidewalk
I don’t flow, I ceiling
My mama said they need me
Cause I’m made from the best stuff on earth
Like Snapple Tea Leaves
They glass is half full so I spit into them like Celie
No longer G, now you can see me
But your letter's still under my sea like seaweed
C and G but nothing bout me CG
It’s all real, none of this is green screen
Shut Up and Let Me Go just like The Ting Tings

Standing around a bunch of PCs
I’ve rocked it from the shottas to the soccer moms
Try to stop what’s going on

No we is up - cause its like two of me

Sing for the Moment,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'alternative', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Eminem]
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch!)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

[Chorus: Steven Tyler & Eminem]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely ‘cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)
[Chorus: Steven Tyler & Eminem]

Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 3: Eminem]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one ‘cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it ‘cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can—

Ooh, that was wrong!  Oh man.  You told me stuff, and we gots to find a song for them all.  It’s appreciation though.  Yo, Dee, to start, play the original so I can get in the mood to kick these verses.  Alright, oh, uh, yeah, yeah.  I see you, love.  I said, “All the time.”  Does it ever puzzle you?  Have you asked why?  Nah.  I know I do.  I do, it’s true.  I ain’t pretending, man.  Aight, aight.  Let’s get into it, for real, for real.  Aight?  One.  Drop it, drop it

[Bridge 1 (Overlapped with Intro): Sample from The Stylistics - “Stop, Look, Listen (To Your Heart)”]
You’re alone all the time
Does it ever puzzle you?
Have you asked why you seem
To fall in love?  Out again
Do you ever really love?
Or just pretend?
Why fool yourself?
Don’t be afraid
To help yourself
It’s never too late, too late to stop...

[Bridge 2: Sample from Rodney Cee on Double Trouble - “Stoop Rap” with Scratches by Da Beatminerz] (x7)
Here’s a little story that must be told

[Verse 1: Jean Grae]
She grew up
Believing in passion and love, whose folks divorced and remarried
Very naïve, seen life and commitments that
Should have been dead and buried, highly sentimental, sensitive
Gentle beyond the point she should be.  What might be obvious
To most, she says they’re too bitter, can’t see
The world the way she does, clean lungs, undamaged liver, sees
Thugs through her pink-tinted glasses.  Occasionally, weed
Does make her giggle, listen to some music closer, dudes
Approach her lightly, wanna be her lover, and she obliges
Likes to cuddle under the covers by candlelit fires
Oblivious to lying schemes to talk her out of clothes, says
She’s just in love with love, cuts her classes, spends too much time
Entrancing, romancing.  Things are changing quickly.  She’s asking
“Why aren’t you spending more time with me?”  Nigga’s eyes are getting
Shifty, coming over later smelling of pussy on his face
Jeans and sweaters—something’s fishy.  And it’s not what
He tells her, man, it’s what he don’t, and she don’t understand
And, for some years, she probably won’t.  Just wants an honest man
For goodness sake, they’re backstabbing and cutting her throat
Restraining orders follow, but she still optimistic about it
Like Annie, thinking “Tomorrow” maybe will be a better day
I let her pray on bended knees, ask him to send Prince Charming, please
She’s never cheated, treats her man well, cooks, cleans
Dresses sexy for him, halter tops and tight jeans, would break
The law for him, go through a couple of these relationships
Still stays strong, she’s too young and dumb to call it quits
Learns that she carrying twice, scared and afraid the first
Time.  The second, she don’t even cry.  He makes her wipe away
His tears and it hurts.  They always leave and turn crazy, so
She doesn’t flirt, spends time warning the babies
Goes through a couple of these relationships and still stays strong
Too young and dumb to call it quits.  It’s still a love song
[Verse 2: Jean Grae]
She’s got
A good man.  She’s nineteen, he’s twenty-one and sweet and honest
Promised to love her, talk of marriage.  She would never wanna
Be somebody’s baby’s mother, use rubbers occasionally
When she’s flowing, open off the affection and gifts and all
The good manners he’s showing.  He’s trying to build a life for himself
Studies late, computer shit, and she’s missing attention that
She’s not getting, sex dwindles.  Crawling in the sheets, he say
He tired, and she say she feel neglect and defeat, just doesn’t
See his ambition, she wanna be the universe and hold
His center position, starts hanging ‘round the best friend more
Crazy attraction, takes impulsive action, dropped the drawers
And falls in love, the world explodes when she confesses.  “Yeah, I did it
So?”  They’re so tight, it’s like he moves when she stretches.  Over
The couple years, too many stresses, girls who wanna fight her
Bitches writing letters, friendships disappearing, plus
He rhymes, so it’s competitive pressure, miscarriage.  They break up
Fifty times a week and make up just as much.  He fucking
And I know, but pretending I’m out of touch.  It’s getting
Strained and gets physical, she cries until the river dries
And leaves her dead and cold, packs up her things and leaves behind.  What I
Had thought was gold was only gold-plated.  Thinking of all
The other ones I could have just left and up and dated
Single after four years.  Starting over never easy, but it
Takes some time to realize your own worth, come into
Your own, play your mental rebirth.  She starts penning some
Better poems, straighten up her bank account, likes to take
Herself out.  I’m getting better at it.  I’ve had
A few relationships, but still too young and dumb enough to call
It quits.  It’s still a love song
[Bridge 3: Jean Grae]
Love
All I ever want is you
All I ever had
Needed in my life was you
All that ever was, all I ever had

[Verse 3: Jean Grae]
Maybe it’s
Easier to talk about this shit in third person, learning
Better, looking for nub in all the wrong places like I’m
Eddie Murphy, curse me to repeat the same cycle I’m breaking
No longer think relations make a better woman, just
For life I’m pursuing, growing but hopelessly romantic still
Tasted weather in the bitter climates, love the sunshine better
Dreaming of dream proposals, decent moral values placing
Higher on my chart, trying not to have a shallow heart
But battle scars are deep and reach into the depths of Hell and back
Try to give up the grudges.  Think it’s experience
And move from the clutches of sadness.  It’s difficult
Sometimes, I wish I wasn’t an adult.  Adolescent
Primetime sitcom star, I’ve been too far
And too much, too hard for too long.  It’s still a love song"

[Hook - R. Kelly]
I'm a gigolo, spending lot's a dough
You can tell the way wide-body, sitting on voguesAnd how I'm shining, wit the fresh, fresh clothes
Always surrounded, by so many (HO!)
I'm a gigolo, always on the go
Every time I turn around, I got another show
In the club, wit about three in a row
Drop in the Six, cause I love them (HO!)

[Verse 1 - Nick Cannon]
Shorty I, only got one night in town, tell me baby where you down
Bushes we won't beat around, bushes we just eat 'em now
Feeling yo Moschino  blouse, seven jean, Black and Lebanese
Head to her knees, please if you ever need a bastard remember me
Just rock to the melody, I got you in bed wit me
I thought you would never leave
You wanna name me, like Amerie
Know the chain freeze wrist, be the same degrees
Tryna get lil' mami, in that thang of reese
Only getting in for free, if you came wit me
Cause I'mma grown man, not B2K
If I need a Girlfriend, it won't be to-day
No, I'm NOT tryna be ya man, pimp bones in my body
Rock them body-hotty, rock them, like ladi-dadi

But like my favorite records, keep spinning new thangs
Let my hair grow, cause I was looking for a change
Shorty call me the Scare Crow, I'm looking for some brain
In ""The Wiz"", there it go, here it is, where the show
Cause through yo dress, I can see yo drawls
So shorty just shake it, make a round of applause
If you outta Hypnotic, 'nother round at the bar
And when we parking lot pimping, they surrounding the car

Mami, when we leave the club, leave wit us
You don't need ya car keys, we gon' fair in the bus
And the way you wear ya jeans, is means to cuss
So DAMN! how you get them on, DAMN! big secrets on her
Throwback chick, hotter than Ms. Vic Damone
This the type of ... I'm on, not picking up the phone
Unless you unblock ya joint, then put on ya coat
Know when to hit, when Nick get in the booth
Come through in something new, wit an invisible roof
Oh the sentence on my necklace seem invisible too
When we do what we do, we can't be visible boo
The last thing I need is lawsuits, all I did is call you
Initiated first move, shorty that was all you
I'm NOT tryna be ya man, pimp bones in my body
Rock them body-hotty, rock them, like ladi-dadi
Me and Kels on Ducatti's, wanna see you drop it shawty, oh weee!

Shades,Wale,['hip hop'],"[Verse 1: Wale]
Chip on my shoulder, big enough to feed Cambodia
See, I never fit into they quotas
Sneakers wasn’t fitting and my knees needed lotion
Long before I knew the significance of a comb
I roam like phone with no vocal reception
Immigrant parents had me feeling like a step-kid
And black Americans never did accept me
That’s why I grab so much when I'm respected
I never fit in with them light skins
I felt the lighter they was, the better that they life is
So I resented them and they resented me
Cheated on light skin Dominique when we was seventeen
I figure I'd hurt her, she evidently hurt me
And all women who had light features, see
I'd never let a light broad hurt me
That’s why I strike first and the verse cuts deep

[Chorus: Chrisette Michele]
From a light-skinned girl to a dark-skinned brother
Shade doesn’t matter, heart makes the lover
Boy you’re so beautiful, boy you're so beautiful
Shadee doesn’t matter, heart makes the lover
Honey brown, caramel, coffee brown, chocolate
Toffee, pecan, licorice, boy you're so beautiful
[Verse 2: Wale]
Just another knotty-haired nigga
Hoping Wes Snipes make my life a bit different
In middle school I had to write to be timid
I had beautiful words but girls never listened
Listen; blacker the berry, sweeter the powder
Well I'm fruit punch concentrate and they water
Walk into my room thinking how to make moves
Ain't thinking like a student but how Ice-T'd do it
Light dudes had the girls looking there all year
It’s not fair, the ones with the good hair
Couldn’t adapt to naps, I wear caps
They napped and slept on me, man, I hate black
Skin tone I wish I could take it back
Or rearrange my status maybe if I was khaki
Associating light skin with classy
The minstrel show showed a me that was not me

[Chorus: Chrisette Michele]
From a light-skinned girl to a dark-skinned brother
Shade doesn’t matter, heart makes the lover
Boy you’re so beautiful, boy you're so beautiful
Shadee doesn’t matter, heart makes the lover
Honey brown, caramel, coffee brown, chocolate
Toffee, pecan, licorice, boy you're so beautiful
[Verse 3: Wale]
They say ""black is beautiful,"" but ask them beautiful
Light girls if it's black they attract to usually
What if Barack's skin was all black, truthfully
Would he be a candidate or just a blackened community?
We as black dudes tend to lack unity
And them blacker girls ain't on the tube usually
Right now at 23 I ain't mad at them reds no more
But for long time I had gone cold
Blindfolded my own insecurity was holding me back
To reds, I ain't know how to act
They would get the cold shoulder and know it was an act
A defense mechanism, what I thought that I lacked
Confidence

[Chorus: Chrisette Michele]
From a light-skinned girl to a dark-skinned brother
Shade doesn’t matter, heart makes the lover
Boy you’re so beautiful, boy you're so beautiful
Shadee doesn’t matter, heart makes the lover
Honey brown, caramel, coffee brown, chocolate
Toffee, pecan, licorice, boy you're so beautiful"

Shut up! 50 years ago, they'd have you upside down with a fucking fork up your ass! You can talk, you can talk, you can talk, you're brave now, motherfucker! Throw his ass out. He's a nigga! He's a nigga! He's a nigga! A nigga, look, there's a nigga!

[Verse 1: Wale]
The color of my skin, content of my character
Dream of a King's been a nightmare for anyone
White with a badge or anyone
Slightly affected by the tide to this race that I'm running in
Pardon me, y'all, the racists I run against
The race war, when it's us against all of them
They subconsciously low talk us
And probably all think as Kramer did still but won't talk it
And first off, I ain't trying to be conscious
Speaking heart with a conscious, talking to you
This dark content for those of dark complexion
Who's x-ed off rip, who gon' listen to us?
Who gon' speak for us? Who gon' plead for us?
Who gon' be the Head N.I.C. for us?
Who gon' defend us from crooked police on us?
I'm just an insecure N.I.G. er
[Break: Wale]
Please listen to me, please listen to me
Please listen to me, N.I.G. er
Please listen to me, who gon' listen to me?
Who gon' listen to me, N.I.G. er
Listen to me, who gon' listen to me?
Who gon' listen to me, N.I.G. er
Who gon' listen to me, who gon' listen to me?
Who gon' listen to me, N.I.G

[Verse 2: Wale]
Hey, and P say that I should stop saying ""nigga""
But if I did, what would be the difference?
I'd still be a nigga, he'd still be a nigga in his feelings
I'd still be a nigga with no deal tryna get one
There'd still be niggas out killing
And still be white people still out to get us
And still be niggas saying whites tryna get us
And still be lazy and paranoid niggas
I'm paramount, nigga, I am, and you can't be mad
'Cause I choose the word ""nigga,"" lemme air it out, nigga
""Nigga"" ain't bad, see, niggas just had
A clever idea to take something they said
Into something we have, something we flipped
Into something with swag, nigga, don't be mad
Bitches ain't shit, but women ain't bitches
See, women are the queens, and bitches just bitches
And bitches say ""bitch"" like bitch is not offensive
When niggas say ""bitch,"" all of the sudden, they offended
A nigga say ""nigga"" to a nigga
A nigga write ""nigga"" in a lyric
Expect the white boy to omit it
The white boy spit it like he spit it
Recite it to his friends who, by the way, ain't niggas
And say ""Nigga, nigga, nigga, my favorite rapper did it""
And non-nigga friends got it with him
Incorporate this lyric to their everyday living
Until a Black friend kinda hear it, just a tidbit
He thinks ""Aw, forget it, it's so insignificant and little""
The white boy sees this as a clearance
Now it's, ""Nigga, nigga, nigga,"" every single day
And that little nigga-nigga, think it's okay
And he's the only nigga in this particular grade
And it begins to faze him more each day
The things they say went a little too far
He couldn't tell the difference between a ""-a"" or ""-er""
So they just keep going, saying ""nigga"" in his face
There's nothing he can do, he let it get away
It came to the point he couldn't look 'em in the face
The mirror made him hurl, his reflection disgraceful
Yeah, and make sure everything you say
Can't be held against you in any kind of way
And any connotation is viewed many ways
'Cause under every nigga, there's a little bit of Kramer
Self-hatred, I hate you
And myself
Niggas!
[Outro: Michael Richards]
Uh, I lost my temper onstage, I was at, uh, a comedy club trying to, um, do my act... And I got heckled and I, I, I took it badly and went into a... a rage... And uh, uh... said some pretty, uh... nasty things to some Afro-Americans, a lot of trash talk... For this to happen, for me to be in a comedy club and flip out and say this crap, you know, I'm...

Cocaine hustler, blowin' out the brains of busters
Be in my mansion, chillin', inhalin' the ganja smoke
Counting mad cream, weighin' tons of coke
Guarded by thugs and Rottweilers
I flood the streets with drugs and clock dollars
Niggas get plugged when my Glock hollers
Skunk smoker, Philly and Owl ripper
Cristal sipper, I've been a willy for a while, nigga
'Gruff got hoes, the man with all the nachos
Expensive hot clothes, drop top Rolls
East coast, West coast, fiends overdose
'Gruff get the cream with my team and I'm ghost

[Verse 2: Ma$e]
This money be temptin' me, to jump out the MPV
Empty three clips of hollow tips with no sympathy
Since fourteen, I sold morphine for more green
Kept dope in a Nautica coat under the drawstring
And watched out for cops, squad cars, and Beemers
And laundry ninas, flee the country to Argentina
Laid back in the beach, yeah, coastin' with commuters
Smokin' the buddahs on the cruise line boat to Aruba
For a while, yo; pump the vowel so I can pile dough
Then become a Harlem kingpin just like Alpo
Get paid so I can lay low in San Diego
With yayo and ship it out whenever I say so

Yo! Makin' this money is the American Dream

Whether it's Uptown, Downtown; you pick the scene
You gots to get your own scheme

Yo! I'ma run hysterically, 'til they bury me
Count numerically, hills of Beverly
More grands than Cherokee; president like Eric B. and Rakim
Drug game, I'm top ten; locked in, right now is not a option
And those who creep got the Mac and the heat
They got the five-inch screens in the back of the seat
And now they got this daddy braggin'
Last year had me saggin', wasn't ready
When Heavy was back and, tossed me in the paddywagon
But ain't nobody out here stoppin' love
'Cause we was twelve years old in the Cotton Club, poppin' bub'
So all the fame without the fortune; goddamn, you wrong
Killa kid Cam-e-ron surviving in the Amazon

Yo! I leave you dazed and froze with all kinds of amazing flows
Money surrounded, I counted while bathing with Asian hoes
Back home niggas is after me, I'm back to sea, sippin' daquiris
Coke factory, fiends baggin' up crack for me, from
Cutting up rocks to investing in stocks
Nautica yachts, and knots busting outta my socks
Now that Bloods play the chubby
All the ladies love me, they hate who made me hubby
Behind my back they say my baby's ugly
Each night I sleep,with freaks with Lamborghini Jeeps
Neighbours be sneaking peeks
At how my semen leaks between the sheets
Mess up my loot, I cut your collars, Juan
Cause these is modern times
And the only thing I see is dollar signs

I'm known to mack a hoochie
Do I got stacks of lucci? (Absolutely!)
Harlem kids is known for felonies and sellin' keys
Pushin 300Z's, GS3's, and puffin' trees
These G's breeze while DTs be yellin, ""Freeze!""
We stash cheese and keep a pocket full of centuries
Ayo, I'm set for the rest of my life
Some clown that laid the threat cause I had sex with his wife
I stuck my tool to his brain, said ""Act a fool and get slain”

Don't you know that I run this place
And I've begun this race, must I rerun this pace
I'm the reason it's become this way
And their love for it is the reason I have become this praised
(Let me put you on game)
They love my darkness, I make them heartless
And in return they have become my martyrs
I've been in the poem of many a poet
And I reside in the art of many a artist
(Let me put you on game)
Some of your smartest have tried to articulate
My whole part in this, but they're fruitless in their harvest
The dro grows from my footsteps
I'm the one that they follow, I am the one that they march with
(Let me put you on game)
Through the back alleys and the black markets
The Oval offices, crack-houses, and apartments
Through the mazes of the queens
The pages of the sages and the chambers of the kings
(Let me put you on game)
Through the veinses of the fiends
A paper chaser's pager, yo, I'm famous on the scene
One of the oldest, most ancientest things
Speak every single language on the planet, y'all mean?
(Let me put you on game)
I am the American dream
The rape of Africa, the undying machine
The overpriced medicine, the murderous regime
The tough guy's front and the one behind the scenes
(Let me put you on game)
I am the blood of this city, its gas, water, and electricity
I'm its gym, and its math, and its history
The gunshots in the class
And you can't pass if you're missin', G
I taught them better than that
I taught them aim for the head and hope they never come back
I'm glad your daddy's gone, baby, hope he never comes back
I hope he's with your mother with my hustlers high in my traps
(Let me put you on game)
I hope you die in his trash
I can't help it, all I hear when you're crying is laughs
I'm sure somebody find you tied up in this bag
Behind the hospital, little baby crack addicts had
(Let me put you on game)
Then maybe you can grow up to be a stripper
A welfare-receiving prostitute and gold digger
You can watch on TV how they should properly depict you
The rivers shall flow with liquor, quench your thirst on my elixirs
(Let me put you on game)
I am the safe haven for the rebel runaway and the resistor
The trusted misleader, the number one defender
And from a throne of their bones I rule
These fools are my fuel, so I make them cool
(Let me put you on game)
Baptize them in the water out of Scarface pool
And feed them from the table that held Corleone's food
If you die, tell them that you played my game
I hope your bullet holes become mouths that say my name

Yeah, yeah
The Cool
Turn me up, uh, yeah

[Verse 1]
He came back, in the same suit that he was buried in
Similar to the one his grandfather was married in
Yes, he was still fresh to death
Bling, two earrings, a chain layin' on his chest
He still had it cause they couldn't find it
And the bullets from his enemies sat like two inches behind it
Smelled the Hennessy from when his niggas got reminded
And poured out liquor in his memory, he didn't mind it
But, he couldn't sip it fast enough
So the liquor was just fillin' the casket up
Floatin' down by his feet was the letter from his sister
Second grade handwriting simply read, ""I miss ya""
Suit jacket pocket held his baby daughter's picture
Right next to it, one of his mans stuck a Swisher
He had a notion as he laid there soakin'
He saw that the latch was broken, he kicked his casket open
And he...

This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you lie
You born, you live then you die
Oh oh oh oh
If life goes passing you by
Don't cry
If you're breaking the rules, making your moves
Paying your dues, chasing the cool

[Verse 2]
Not at all nervous as he dug to the surface
Tarnished gold chain is what he loosened up the earth with
He used his mouth as a shovel to try and hollow it
And when he couldn't dirt-spit, he swallowed it
Working like a, hmm, reverse archaeologist
Except, his buried treasure was sunshine
So when some shined through a hole that he had drove
It reflected off the gold and almost made son blind
He grabbed onto some grass and climbed
Pulled himself up out of his own grave and looked at the time
On the watch that had stopped, six months after the shots
That'd got him in the box, wringing Henny out his socks
Figured it was hours because he wasn't older
Used some flowers to brush the dirt up off his shoulder
So, with a right hand that was all bones
And no reason to stay, he decided to walk home
So he...
[Hook]
This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you lie
You born, you live then you die
Oh oh oh oh
If life goes passing you by
Don't cry
If you're breaking the rules, making your moves
Paying your dues, chasing the cool

[Verse 3]
He begged for some change to get him on the train
""Damn, that nigga stank"" is what they complained
Tried to light the blunt but it burst into flames
Caught the reflection in the window of what he became
A long look, wasn't shook, wasn't ashamed
Matter of fact, only thing on his brain was brains
Yeah, and gettin' back in his lane
Doin' his thang, first he had to find something to slang
Next stop was his block, it had the same cops
Walked right past the same spot where he was shot
Shocked that some lil' niggas tried to sell him rocks
It just felt weird, being on the opposite
They figured that he wasn't from there so they pulled out
And robbed him with the same gun they shot him with
Put it to his head and said, ""You're scared, ain't ya?""
He said, ""Hustler for death, no heaven for a gangsta""
And...

This life goes passing you by

He was a heart breaker
And a law shaker
If it was about caking, he was a partaker
International, he would take trips
Bon voyage, that's how hard he was fishing for the chips
So greedy, never gave to the needy, that's what some say
The way he shunned all the bums hanging in the subways
He called 'em fruits and laughed at 'em
Delivery man, on the pick-up
Drive through and throw a bag at 'em
And it was hard to understand him sometimes
Making a killing, the way he had 'em standing in line

Lovers call him King, haters call him Clown
He would say ""Bite me, that's the way it's going down""
He was having thoughts that maybe he should retire
Went to Church on a Sunday and saw a deep Friar
Said he had beef and people want him dead
He loved the hungry ones, was only scared of the Feds
He lived the fast life, couldn't get his path right
The Friar just told him 'bout the Hooters that he had last night
""Turn yourself in to the paddy wagon"", said ""No""
Bacon wouldn't take him, had the Pigs on the payroll

The stars are aligned, and the planets colliding
The plan is arriving, and she's out there smiling
The fear is upon us, the skies tried to warn us
The parents are goners, no children to mourn us
It's driving me crazy, this war is my lady
We've lost all our babies, and God is amazing

The pimp and the riser
Your cross, there you'll find her
Hey, hey

Disease, the virus is spreading in all directions
No safe zone no cure and no protection
No symptoms define the signs of an infection
No vaccines, remedies, and no corrections
Quarantine the dreams and seal off the connections
Don't let them in, not a friend, not a reflection
Everybody's got it and want you to have it next and
Don't accept them if you want to stay as an exception
No pill can heal the ill of this
Sickness, some are still in doubt of its existence
Some call it forgiveness and some call it the vengeance
Some say it's an exit and some say it's an entrance
The poor say the rich have the cure
The rich say the poor are the source
Revolutionaries say it's psychological war
Invented by the press, just to have something to report
Some say the first case came from a maternity ward
Some say a morgue, some say the skies, some say the floors
Whores say the nuns, nuns say the whores
And everybody is sure
The scientist say it only affects the mind
The little boy said it only affects the girls
The preacher man said it's going to kill off the soul
A bum said it's gonna kill the whole wide world
[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
Death is on the tip of her tongue and
Danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue and
Danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
""Believe!"", so say the neon signs by the
Loudspeakers repeating that everything is fine;
A subtle solace to demolish the troubled conscience
Of a populace with no knowledge and every freedom denied
Every dream is designed and broadcasted
From the masters to the masses
From the antennas on the top of the shrines
Refine the receiver and plant it
During the panic and short it, it reports back
Everything in your mind, everything is lying
Everything is dying, everything is a rule
Everything is a crime, everything was here then
Everything rewind the new
Weather burned the feathers off everything flying
(And she likes it, and she loves it)
The sadness, the madness, the bad shit
The lavish, the fastest, the clashes, the ashes to ashes
Everything intertwined
My femme fatale my darling fraudulent angel
Once caught her changing the batteries in her halo
Receipt for her wings and everything that she paid for
And the address to the factory where they made those
Scientist said she's all inside my mind
The little boy said ""What happened to all the girls?""
The preacher man said ""She's going to kill off your soul.""
The dope boy said ""It's the whole wide world.""
[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
Death is on the tip of her tongue and
Danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue and
Danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight"
Three Sides to a Story,Joe Budden,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Joe Budden as Derrick]
My name's Derrick, I'm from Queens right there on Merrick
Raised of honesty, loyalty, good merits
Got a lil' sister and my pops just perished
And I just came home so my freedom I really cherish
Young when they bagged me, seven in the can is torture
And I just did that for manslaughter
Odds was against me, murder in the second degree
Made it less cuz I gave 'em a plea
That's the past, now a dude home tryna clean up his past
When all niggas know me for is the past
And my mind's always thinking how to pocket some cash
They know if something ever sparked it'll cock it and blast
Now I'm tryna live straight and get my act together
But my moms struggling, she putting scraps together
Long time ago, when I wasn't home she was cleaning my room
Cried when she found a gat in the dresser
Says no child of her's woulda had dat, never!
But with all the dirt I was doing
I felt like I had to protect her, I had to protect us
'Stead of me sellin' crack forever
She rather me in ShopRite, getting bags together
Past endeavors, won't allow me to get work
Forced me to get work
On apps they ask if you ever been to jail, like if I say yes you'll hire me
NIGGA DON'T LIE TO ME!
I gotta lil sister that's nine
Plus moms is chillin', wit some new dude I think she feeling
But he don't help with the bills and I'm back on the strip
So we don't go broke, I'm back to this hammer that I have to tote
Stash ya kno, I'm killin' em, only nigga on the Ave. with coke
Only man in the house, I gotta bring in cash
And those two checks a month that mom get don't last
Lil Sally's real young, she developing fast
Oh, you thinking the same thing, it's a hell of a task
Then it clicked me, plain clothes, cops came to get me
But knew that I had mine on threaten to hit me
And I moved swiftly, said they had a warrant
They knew about it all they said they had an informant
I'm back in this caged up cell
With the apes in jail, now I'm back in this eight by twelve
See I tried to live right
But society ain't made for niggas to live right
Mommy just write
Mommy make sure Sally keep her shit tight
And I'll be home real soon, don't cry, it's aiight
[Chorus: Joe Budden]
I know it might seem like it's all good
But this is what it's like in the hood
I rep my set like you should
But this is what it's like in the hood
I know it might seem like it's all good
But this is what it's like in the hood
I rep my set like you should
But this is what it's like in the hood

[Verse 2: Joe Budden as Sally]
My names Sally, and I'm from Queens I'm not happy
Dad passed away, moms remarried
I gotta big bro, but he's in jail
Moms said for some things that he used to sell
And I'm always with step-dad, his names Beau
And theres some things about him that my mom don't know
And he says if I tell that it won't be pretty
And I'm really scared of em, he's already hit me
He touches me places I don't like it
And I ain't talking bout a hug or goodbye kiss
I mean touch me places that's private
And he don't just touch he put summin inside it
He says the more he does that, I'll start to like it
Hand over my mouth so I'm quiet
Moms only wit 'em cuz our money is low
I'm sixteen but I'm shaped like a twenty year old
And my moms in love so she makes excuses
But she looks at me and sees scrapes and bruises
Why step daddy gotta take me thru this
Help, somebody, I'm getting raped I can't do this
Nobody understands I'm weary
Get goosebumps anytime a man come near me
Know how it feel to have a man use you for a cushion
All the while moaning and pushin
You try to push him, he's getting bothered
You yell and you scream but he starts going harder
Trust me, it's summin you don't wanna be apart of
Cuz even when it's over, your life, it'll scar ya
Visit my bro, he can tell I'm sad
Staring hard at my stomach he can tell I'm fat
He can tell I'm mad
But step daddy touched me, fucked me, you think that I can tell him that?
Beau called the cops on him, could I tell him that?
Yep, thought you'd agree so I keep it all to me
Baby on the way, and I'm not working
And I kno it's his cause I used to be a virgin
Derrick says he'll handle it, wipe my tears
He don't know, this is what it's like for years
And it falls on def ears
Damn mommy please come home, please mommy don't leave us alone
Some secrets are hard to keep
Some secrets make it hard to sleep
And sleep is the only time I feel safe
Still the act haunts me, and I know I'ma wake up with step daddy on me
[Chorus: Joe Budden]
I know it might seem like it's all good
But this is what it's like in the hood
I rep my set like you should
But this is what it's like in the hood
I know it might seem like it's all good
But this is what it's like in the hood
I rep my set like you should
But this is what it's like in the hood

[Verse 3: Joe Budden as Beau]
My names Beau, gotta chick named Pam that I live with
But she's always in church, real religious
I hadda son he was young he was gifted
Til a nigga killed him a week before Christmas
Three shots close range with a handgun
I knew before I met Pam that it was Pam's son
I knew when I pulled the Mill out harder
And went on a manhunt just to kill they father
Derrick and my boy hadda mutual friend
That put me on doing what I gotta do for revenge
Derricks coming home now, and he's gonna get it
And I kno he'll be lookin for me with a biscuit
Not hard to find, got them TECs in handy, and
I'm in his house having sex with him family
I got his mom on the bed and the canopy
And I'm with his sister molesting her candy
Now he know it all
His friend probably told em, and you can't hide nothing in a hood so small
[Verse 3 (Continued): Joe Budden as the Narrator]
But then it came Sunday, Beau ain't hafta work
Just humped on Sally, Pam's in church
Derrick bust in, Beau just froze
White shit on his nose, Sally getting her clothes
Screams, ""Get ready for your funeral Beau""
And then he reach to his hip and let a few of 'em go
Cause he's packin but Sally starts gaspin
Holdin her stomach, I guess she started having contractions
Beau grabbed his, now they both got heat
Just gunnin, both ignoring the seed that's coming
Now Sally's in the crossfire, screams out stop
Holes in the wall, now the scenes getting hot
Next 30 seconds on the scene is the cops
Yellow tape up, now the scenes getting blocked
Barricades up, yep, you already kno y'all
Ambulance there, streets full of patrol cars
Cops on the mega phone, ""come down now""
But it all calmed down somehow
Beau comes out, hands showing, carrying his arms
Derrick comes down, little Sally in his arms
Yep, nuttin to say, she was hit by a stray
Nope! Shots done ricochet, cops take him away
And now some niggas miss em
But it wasn't the guns that killed Sally, nah it was the dumb niggas wit em
When we gonna learn to treat our people sacred
There's some type of way kid, we're all related
When we gonna grow and get rid of the hatred
Cuz this shit happens on a regular basis, this shit happens on a regular basis
This type of shit happens everyday kid

[Chorus: Joe Budden]
I know it might seem like it's all good
But this is what it's like in the hood
I rep my set like you should
But this is what it's like in the hood
I know it might seem like it's all good
But this is what it's like in the hood
I rep my set like you should
But this is what it's like in the hood"

Should have avoided my temptation instead of my vows
Now I may suffer my forever shit wit Elin
Let's put this shit to bed before this message gets the L-O
And if she catch me slippin'
The media gon' trip, And I got shit to do on T.V
Keep me clean, don't do no snitchin
And I'mma hold you down forever and appreciate the effort
And ya pussy was amazing but it ain't worth a couple million
C'mon girl
Don't be wrong girl
I hope you not rattin' out to get on girl
See my whole life I been winnin'
So the right to have these women, I'm entitled to their interest
Yeah I'm at 'em
And this a vicious battle that I'm havin'
But an addict yes I am, butIshould act more like an adult
It knows me
It controls me
And I'm still hurtin over pops
It consoles me
Okay my stories ain't addin' up
But Elon don't got no proof
And hell if I'm gon tell him, now shut up and play it cool
I love what the ladies do
But I love my babies too
And I have forsaken my marriage, now she gon take me for loot
Look in the mirror
What do I really need
Is it the money or my marriage or media peace
Life's fuckin' wit me
Once the message released
She found out and tried to treat my head like a tee
BITCH!

Shit
Embarrassments an understatement
As I annihilate the very thing that once was sacred
See my desire for the lust, fucked up what was love
Street fighter ho, she had that Tiger upper cut
Now they comin out the woodworks snitchin' on me
Once Mr. Woods was all good, Now a nigga only
You see now that nigga lonely
And losin all his money
Still hear that laughin' under breath while the Orlando police
See that's insult to injury
Now I'm losin everything as they began the lynch in me
Turnin on ESPN you see they got it in for me
And they won't stop until they got my legacy in infamy
Infamy can't deal wit it
She gon get the mils for this
Don't root for me
They boo for me
And cheer for Phillip Nickleson
Vijay Singh and all of them
They gon stop acknowlegin'
Have they all forgot who made this golf shit hot again
Shit, How quickly they turn on a nigga
Yet, it is forever and a day to forgive and forget one
I'm forever a nigga
Guess when I knew the verdict
I thought of Bill Clinton
I looked at Roethlisberger
As the politics surface, I ain't hardly workin'
I'm gettin help for this addiction, now golf ain't important
But I'm sorry for the damage I have done
For all the pedicures I've given to their camel toes they bring
I know I'm wrong now
Can we get along now?
Would I stay with her, or separate or move along now
Okay you wrong now
We don't get along now
Three quarter bills later
Maybe guess you get it all now"

Let me tell you somethin real
Plenty niggas sittin in jail just to eat a decent meal
But see the rest they running on instinct
And the way they treat me today like they shit don't stank
Make me mad a fuck and fo' dat
A million niggas want to tear Alanta up
This that shit like to see
A gang of niggas working together
To put the devil straight to sleep
We sendin' his ass to the grave ain't no such thang
As a nineteen-ninety-five slave
You brought that shit on yo'self
But fo' me from the beginning a fucked-up hand was already dealt
I used to trust in my preacher
But now a days my mac-11 is my one and only teacher
Seems like youwould listen to reasons
I guess Atlanta nuts are too deep in season
I went to jail fo' the cause and to black police
Wouldn't give 'em the sweat off my fuckin' balls
Suckin' on the devil's dick already kissin his ass fo a ten dolla' raise

So I don't get too high when I had to trust ya
You betrayed the crew and I had to bust ya
Wanna come back and take you
Worried about the wrong thang this paper ain't' gon' set you far
They 'bout to start the revolution to let you knew where tey are
And where they stand they got the upper hand
Listen to the SWAT's, let me tell ya how it is man
You got close and you realize what it is
We fighting each other in the streets of each
And you live and learn day by day
It could get worse, picture me driving a hearse on the day after
Hit a joint from a kid that I saw that didn't notice me on the street

Guess Who?,Goodie Mob,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse1: Khujo]
You 'bout to make me slam yo' back clean out
But I luv her till death do us part
Though she divorced my pop the hard way
Back in nineteen ""yassey"" for the past sixteen years
I took on the responsibility of daddy...
Ma ol' burd... puttin a real buzz in my ear, makin sho' it marinate
And not go out the other ear
Guess who? stood beside me when y'all wouldn't force fed when I
Couldn't lift a spoon to my skull
God is good, God is kind mimmicin' her taught me how to say mine ...
Grace improvised wit bakin' soda when it wasn't no toothpaste
Now what that went with?? my ol' burd cried tears of joy
When she heard I wasn't gon' serve time for possession
Of the ""sawed off"" runnin' out of spurs
When I came home blowed and couldn't find the key hole, guess who
Unlocked the doors, my Ol' burd puttin' my hairs out
I better eat before you bug me to death
Shut-up you old ungrateful ass nigga, she trying to help yo' ass...
I wasn't ready to eat yet but I enjoyed the dinner she said, ""I'm glad""
Slid down my esophagus wit ease, even though she have this skin disease
That won't allow me to gain weight do my own eyes deceive me
Guess who tuck me in before I started drivin this Benz
Again & again, told me not to and when I did...
Guess who beat the dog shit outta me kid
My Moma didn't play, shiiit, I had to pick the switches...
You guess who!!!
[Verse 2: CeeLo Green]
My Moma, destination unknown, went out on her own
She was barely even grown and became my Moma
I never knew my dad, so even when the times got bad
I was glad cause I had my Moma
For so long she had to be strong
I know at certain times she was wrong
But she still my Moma, it still amazes me
The Lord had to help her raise me judging from the way I used to be
My Moma, the biggest player that I know I love her so
Hell everything I got I owe to my Moma
Thank you for caring, thank you for sharing yo' luv
I guess that was yo' way of preparing
Yo' son to be the one and not the two
To make you and my daddy's dream come true
But what a surprise a car wreck left you paralyzed
The sheet was pulled over yo' eyes when the doctor advised
The family that you might not ever talk again
But you talkin' so I know that you gon' walk again
But take yo time, guess who's the inspiration for the rhyme... My Moma

Who was tha first to hold you in some arms
Tha first to change your diaper when your stomach wasn't calm
Your Moma, wit that drama brought you into this world
From a world of down under
I wonder now she know when I was lying, when I was telling the truth
With the proof she would explain how I've been skipping school
With that boys putting wholes on my back with the same belt
Around my waist that held my panst up
Takin' back only got you closer to Southern Bell
Got your forehead swell
I swear she knew when it was real or when it was fake like Clampetts
With dreads and if I couldn't handle a situation then I fled
Behind closed doors I froze, in Garnett holes I rose
Who that hell got my bond
Standing in front of that two-inch glass
A woman ready to hand the cash over for her son...
My Mama!!
Sometimes we get it on, I know at times I'm wrong
Lookin' into my eyes just to let me know she tried is enough for me
I'm callin' a truce it seems we more like brother and sister
Even though she pay the bills wit the mister
Brought me home in '72 and gave me all she had
Cause I was left at birth she knew it could work
Since she gave me the first chance my song and dance
Pearl, my world, what would I do without her spark
Probably be on the street wit nothin' to eat but I got a happy home
Ever since my first day it's heaven sent now I know
What it's meant when I say
I appreciate what you've done and what you do your only son...
Guess who???

The only one that cares for real and really understands how I feel
Help me over come my fears and never left me through the years
So I dedicate this song for you, for all that you brought me through
I know there will never be another that will love me like my Mother"

Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder

I probably owe it to y'all, probably be locked by the force
Tryin' to hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin' my balls
Said the ladies, they love me, from the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin', they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin' off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers, they love it, just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom of the bottom, to the top of the pops
Nigga, London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back, get it? Man, I'm straight off the block
I can run it back, nigga, ‘cause I'm straight with the Roc

Now 52 bars come out, now you feel 'em
Now 52 cars roll out, remove ceilin'
In case 52 broads come out, now you chillin'
With a boss, bitch, of course, S.C. on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real

I drop that Black Album, then I back out it
As the best rapper alive, nigga, ask 'bout me
From bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammy's
From O's to opposite of Orphan Annie
You gotta pardon Jay, for sellin' out the Garden in a day

[Verse 1: Damian Marley & Nas]
As we enter
Come now, we take you on the biggest adventure
Must be dementia
That you ever thought you could touch our credentials
What's the initials?
Q.B., Jamrock—the lyrical official
Send out the order, laws and the rituals
Burn candles, say prayers, paint murals
It is truth, we big news, we hood heroes
Break past the anchor, we come to conquer
Man a badman, we no play Willy Wonka
And I got the guns, I got the ganja
And we could blaze it up on your block if you wanna
Or haze it up, stash-box in a Hummer
Or you could run up and get done up
Or get somethin' that you want none of
Unlimited amount you collect from us
Direct from us, street intellectuals
And I'm shrewd about decimals
And my man'll speak Patois, and I can speak rap star
Y'all feel me even if it's in Swahili
Habari Gani, Mzuri Sana
Switch up the language, I move through Ghana
Salute and honor, real revolution rhymers
Rhythm piranhas like two Obamas, unfold the drama
[Hook: Nas]
Word is out, hysteria you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong gonna turn it out
Body the verse until they scream ""murder"" out
The kings is back, time to return the crown
Who want it? Tuck your chain when dude comin'
Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds
Bet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it
Either move on or move on it

[Verse 2: Damian Marley & Nas]
Queens to Kingston
Gunshot we use and govern the kingdom
Rise of the Winston, I can see the fear up in your eyes
Realize you can die any instant
And I can hear the sound of your voice
When you must lose your life like mice in the kitchen
Snitchin', I can see him pissin' on hisself
And he's wettin' up his thighs and he tryin' to resist it
Switchin', I can smell him diggin' up shit like a fly
Come around and be persistent
That's how you end up in a hit list
In a badman business
No evidence, crime scene fingerprint-less
Flow effortless, casual like the weekends
No pressure when we're comfy and decent
We set this off beastin', huntin' season
And, frankly speakin'

Word is out, hysteria, you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong came to turn it out
Body the verse until they scream ""murder"" out

He said, ""Let's hit Japan, if we can make 'em jam
We can make a hundred grand, spend it in the south of France""
Nothing further; I jumped, grabbed my Goyard trunk
Got ready to walk it out like Unk in my John Lennon Chucks
That's when I heard murder
""You're killing me, you're filling me with sorrow
Sunrise, goodbyes, and missing you tomorrows""
I turn to see my dream, love supreme queen
Meanest thing on the scene cry
I drop my bags in a flash, that's faster
Than 180 on that dash, shirt to dry her tears
And wipe the rain from my dear like Dasher
You's the dame who's the username to all my passwords
The reason I get fly is Ibn Jasper
I even keep your picture in my passport
Love, love
[Chorus]
Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Then we can land in the motherland
Camel-back across the desert sand
And take a train, to Rome, or home
Brazil, for real
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes

[Verse 2]
So let's keep it real, all in together, ""Free Chill""
Tell the stewardess to throw a movie on the reel
Heat up my kosher meal, exchange my dollar bills
Lean back in my first class seat and sleep
Don't wake me 'til I land
Where they barely understand what I speak
But they nod to my beats
I tell my fans who I am and they stand
And they clap, they applaud, they love me, my God
Otsukaresama deshita, or maybe au revoir
A spree on Saint-Honoré, then back to Charles de Gaulle
So I can get home and tell her everywhere that I been, and
Everything that I done, and
Tell her that she's the one, and, umm
[Chorus]
Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Then we can land in the motherland
Camel-back across the desert sand
And take a train, to Rome, or home
Brazil, for real
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes

[Verse 3]
Guess who's back in the house
With a bunch of souvenirs and a smile for your mouth
I really missed you, each and every night I kissed you
In my dreams 'fore I went to sleep
To la-la land to count them sheep
I swear you're looking prettier than ever
It's got to be a prophecy for us to stay together, evermore
For better or, less or poor
Or worth our weight in buried treasure, X's on the shore
I know my world tour's like war to you
But Ian said, ""Aloha"", and Harley said, ""Cheers""
Julian said, ""Bonjour"", Big O was like, ""Yeah!""
Amanda and Le Messie want to know when we going there
Edison sends his love, so does the rest of the club
Of the international playboys and playgirls
But I revoke my membership, all for My Tenderness
She said, ""Pursue your interests 'cause even if I'm ticketless
I'll be there, by your side
In your heart, and on your mind""
So, as I taxi down another runway
I gotcha, who loves you bae
Now bring it back now
[Chorus]
Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Then we can land in the motherland
Camel-back across the desert sand
And take a train, to Rome, or home
Brazil, for real
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes"

Hey, I came up, I warmed up, the next up
Bitch I'm about to blow up

Huh, uh, now don’t it sound legendary?
Live enough to resurrect the dead and buried
This for niggas who ain't satisfied with secondary
This for my sisters who ain't satisfied with secretary
Uh, I’m blowing up, and bitch, I’m still me
But what's the cost to live your dream, do you feel me?
Everything glittering ain't what you think it will be
Funny how money, chains and whips make me feel free
I’m starring in this bitch, and yeah, I write the show
Fuck the haters, I’m headed to the place you like to go
They say, ""What you fighting for?"" The game is on life support
And Gary Coleman just passed, life is short

Bitch I’m about to blow up
Look I’m about to blow up
Yeah, got to the club early
Just to get in free and wait for hoes to show up

Mama say I should reconsider law school
That means I wear a suit and bend the truth and feel awful
Hell naw, got a degree, but what that cost you?
You make a good salary just to pay Sally Mae
That's real as ever, ducking bill collectors like Jehovah’s witness
When they showed up at your door at Christmas
Was broke as dishes, tryna let it go
Hit the club, she drop it low, lower than my credit score
Account overdraft, what I got this debit for?
So much debt, it got me drinking, thinking ""Bitch I better blow""
I better blow, these hoes ain't checking
For no nigga with no vehicle, you border like Mexico
Heh, hey baby girl, what it look like?
And where ya head at? And what ya cook like?
She said, ""Where your bread at? Or what your whip like?
You ain't got one or the other, well brother, good night""

Praise God, it’s hard to stay spiritual
How they got these niggas on the TV selling miracles?
You mean to tell me everything goin be fine
If I call your hotline and pay $29.99? (Shit)
Well damn, why ain't you say so?
Take this check and ask God to multiply all my pesos
And erase my number out the phones of these fake hoes
I saved her number just in case but now it’s case closed
To you niggas biting my flows and my subject matter
You’ll never be me partner so it don’t fuckin' matter
You try to be and your career will see funerals
And be you, that's when it sounds beautiful
Then maybe you can blow up
And maybe you can blow up
Shit, but you know what?
For now, bitch I’m about to blow up"
Bagpipes from Baghdad,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Oh, it's music to my ears, oh man
How can I describe the way I feel?
Fucking great, man
Okay, let me see
How could I begin?

[Verse 1]
Locked in Mariah's wine cellar, all I had for lunch
Was bread, wine, more bread, wine and Captain Crunch
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch
And to soak it up, an in-between snack, crackers to munch
Mariah, what's ever happened to us?
Why did we have to break up?
All I asked for was a glass of punch
You see, I never really asked for much
I can't imagine what's going through your mind after such
A nasty break-up with that Latin hunk
Luis Miguel, Nick Cannon, better back the fuck up
I'm not playin', I want her back, you punk
This is Hello Kitty bedspread, Satin Funk
Mixed with Egyptian, with a little rap and punk
Zapp and Eric Clapton, Shaft, Frank Zappa, crunk
And yeah baby, I want another crack at ya
You can beat me with any spatula that you want
I mean, I really want you bad, you cunt
Nick, you had your fun, I've come to kick you in your sack of junk
Man, I could use a fresh batch of blood
So prepare your vernacular for Dracula acupuncture

Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease?
For Pete's sakes, he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind
Half the time, when I rhyme, or blowing up like
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on
'Cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad—

[Verse 2]
You can be a permanent fixture in my lyrical mixture
I'm the Miracle Whip trickster
My signature sound, when a tube of lipstick's around
I'm bound to put it on in an instant, wow
Man, what an ensemble!
What an assortment of pharma–ceuticals
This beautiful pill dust in my palm, my
Cuticles get residue just from touchin' the bottle
Never knew I could remind me so much of my momma
I'll cut ya like Dahmer, pull a butcher knife on ya
The size of a sword, boy, I'm like the fuckin' Red Sonja
Get it stuck in your cornea, nice knowing ya, Norman
You're so fuckin' annoyin', drop the shovel, boy
You don't know what the fuck you're doin'
I ain't playin' no fuckin' more
Nick Cannon, you prick, I wish you luck with the fuckin' whore
Every minute there's a sucker born, snuck up on Malachai
Made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn
Shuck o', shuck o' corn, Chaka Khan
Hit Jason in the face with a hockey puck, and
Told him it's fuckin' on, man, what the fuck are ya doin'?
You're runnin' over the snowblower with the lawnmower
Blowin' your bagpipes from Baghdad

Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease?
For Pete's sakes, he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad

'Cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad

[Verse 3]
In the bed with two brain-dead lesbian vegetables
I bet you they become heterosexual
Nothing will stop me from molestin' you
Titty-fuckin' you 'til your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles
Is what I said to the two conjoined twins
How's it going, girlfriends? You needs a boyfriend?
You need some ointment? Just set up an appointment
Who's gonna see the doctor first? We'll do a coin flip
I just got my one-year sobriety coin chip
When the bad get going, how bad does the going get?
Baby, you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins with
Each other, especially when you're joined at the hip
I'm going to get the needle and thread from the sewing kit
And attempt to separate 'em and stitch 'em back at the loin, shit
Lure the little boy with the chocolate 'Chips Ahoy!' chip
Cookie, lookie, even took me a Polaroid pic

Yo, I wonder if Langston Hughes and Alex Haley
Got blazed before they told stories
I'ma get blazed before I tell y'all stories
I saw on TV today, this man lost his son, his son died
So he had him cremated
Took his ashes and then made it to a diamond ring
Now he watches his son shine everyday
I just thought about that
While I sit here ashing in this ashtray, yeah

[Verse 1]
The making of a mad band, intricate stories of DeVante Swing
Ava Gardner, the crashin' of James Dean
Bobby Brown influenced by Rick James and it goes
Prince wanted Alexander O'Neal to be Morris Day or Jerome
But Alex was putting coke in his nose, nigga whylin'
Could be a myth, but I swear that the source was close
Phyllis Hyman killed herself, it was crazy
Mommy was bad they say
Donny Hathaway free-fall from a balcony, he swayze

As the blunt ash falls into the ash tray
I could see my whole life fly past me
Did I? Did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?
And will the money and fame outlast me?
The blunts ash falls down in the ashtray
Well, I see my whole life fly past me
I'm asking, did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?
Did I? Anything else you wanna know, just ask me

Sam trusted Womack with his main lady
He tossing in the grave like, ""This is how you repay me?!""
A change gon' come, wish you didn't trust me so much
Marvin said ""No mountain's high enough,"" fly stuff
David Ruffin was punchin' Tammi Terrell
Gave her concussions
While the Funk Brothers was laying down the percussion
When Flo from the Surpremes died, Diana Ross cried
Many people said that she was laughin' inside

As the blunt ash falls into the ash tray
I could see my whole life fly past me
Did I? Did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?
And will the money and fame outlast me?
The blunts ash falls down in the ashtray
Well, I see my whole life fly past me
I'm asking, did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?
Did I? Anything else you wanna know, just ask me
[Verse 3]
John F. Kennedy's enemies dealt with treachery
It interests me. Judy Campbell in Gucci sandals
She's what a temptress be
The death of Ennis Cosby, what a mystery!
Or the Chicagoan Harold Washington
Someone is sabotaging 'em
Watch out for the traps
Larry Troutman killed his brother Roger Troutman
Then he killed himself, that's the end of Zapp
And I wouldn't change a thing, mistakes of the greats
This is what came from their pain
From their hurt we gain, an unfair exchange

As the blunt ash falls into the ash tray
I could see my whole life fly past me
Did I? Did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?
And will the money and fame outlast me?

I could smell old Bogey cigars
Lauren Bacall perfumes, smelling just as sweet
Me and my wife K, flying in a drop-top
Like Ruby and Ossie Davis, baby – know what I mean?
Yo, man, I get smoked out, and start thinking 'bout
Hattie McDaniel got a Oscar
For playing Mammy in ""Gone with the Wind""
And she didn't get allowed
Wasn't even allowed to go to the premier
Believe that? Couldn't go to premier to her joint

You know, you've got this fantasy in yo' head about
Gettin' outta the life and settin the corporate world on its ear
What the fuck you gonna do except hustle?
Besides pimpin', you really ain't got the stomach for that

[Verse: Jay-Z]
The game's fucked up
Nigga's beats is bangin', nigga, your hooks did it
Your lyrics didn't—your gangsta look did it
So I would write it if y'all could get it
Bein' intricate'll get you wood, critic
On the internet, they like ""You should spit it""
I'm like ""You should buy it, nigga that's good business""
Forget this rap shit, I need a new hustle
A little bit of everything, the new improved Russell
I say that reluctantly 'cause I do struggle
As you see I can't leave so I do love you
But I'm just a hustler disguised as a rapper
In fact you can't fit this hustle inside of a wrapper
Back when crack was
What these pills are, I was a real star
Complete with real cars, no video ones
You can come and set up a camera, let the video run
And my real life, complete with real ice
VVS boulders all invisibly set
Head and shoulders, my invisible neck
You see Hova wasn't digital yet
Befo' Steve Jobs made the iPod
Was getting head jobs, we call that interneck
Back when rappers wouldn't dare play lyrical roulette
With a automatic weapon I was rappin' with a TEC
Fresh like Mannie be, chain like anti-freeze
Shoebox full of cash, dealer man hand me keys
Pantries full of Arm & Hammer, don't take Nancy Drew to see
What it do, I'm a damn G
Just sent a million dollars through a hands free
That's big money talk, can you answer me?
Before the answer was a 3
I was down in Georgetown with a Hoya chick, lawyer chick
Sure he's rich now 'cause he saw the shit, all this shit
That's why they call him Hov, 'cause he came before all this shit
Bought a 6, quarter seven, skipped on them quarter eights
Bought a 9 for non-stop Glock work all the time
Woo! Guess who's back?
Since this is a New Era, got a fresh new hat
Ten year veteran, I've been set
I've been through with this bullshit game but I never can
I used to think rappin' at 38 was ill
But last year alone I grossed 38 mill'
I know I ain't quite 38 but still
The flow so Special got a .38 feel
The real is back, hehehehe"

Hate is temporary, love is necessary

You can buy the answers but you can’t afford to question me
First off I don’t need you second guessing me
Jail is like third base: I’m coming home eventually
Still got shooters like hot tubs
Man I'm anemic: still got bloods
I’m in my cell reading fan mail
Wish I was in Amsterdam sipping Amstel
Thinking bout all of that pussy I can’t smell
Man they did me wrong; I feel like Nelson Mandel’
I shine too hard my lamp fell
My name still ringing: Alexander Graham Bell
I know you met damn, cause you know damn well
That I still got you open, open like a clam shell
Yeah, still fly on my hawk shit
My conversation stinks cause I talk shit
Stay in your lane you’re on that double-park shit
We eating at the top, get a spoon and a forklift
I got rap wrapped up like a gift
I’d be sober if if was a fifth
I’m feeling like Elvis – jailhouse rock
I’m not 2Pac, I’m the New Pac
Behind bars but the bars don’t stop recording over the phone
I hope the call don’t drop
Drizzy got the ball and I know the ball won’t drop
And I pray none of my kids never wanna be cops

November 30th, 1999
No sunshine

[Verse 1]
The body rock stopped, probably got caught by the cops
Nearby, somebody got shot
But parties don't stop and the parties don't care
It's a stick-up, it's why we got our hands in the air
Still demanding a share, refrigerators bare
Cause they wanna see trade get free and not fair
But we are not blind, we are not there
We don't got time left to spare to not care
On the last day of November, swellin' in ranks
Went to chant down the mighty IMF and World Bank
A gathering of people in peaceful assembly
Onward to Westlake to disrupt the entry
Walk along steady, riot squad ready
To protect every last dignitary's ass
But this started when they herded us like cattle in a fence
Protesters gettin' restless without an exit
They threatened to arrest us, we pushed back and then
A hail of rubber bullets hit teens and old men
I admit, had to split when the first gas canisters hit
Felt it burn in my eyes, nose, and lips
They tried to blame it on the anarchists, garbage
I was there, I'll tell you right now the pigs started it
But they distort it in the news
Talkin' bout stompin' down Niketown wearing their shoes
[Bridge]
But the body rock stopped, probably got caught by the cops
Nearby, somebody got shot
But the parties don't stop and the parties don't care
It's a stick-up, it's why we got our hands in the air

[Chorus]
50,000 deep, and it sound like thunder when our feet pound streets
50,000 deep, and it sound like thunder when our feet pound streets
50,000 deep, and it sound like thunder when our feet pound streets
50,000 deep, 50,000 deep

[Bridge]
But the body rock stopped, probably got caught by the cops
Nearby, somebody got shot
But parties don't stop in the south
So take your shoes off when you come into my house

[Verse 2]
I had to duck out cause I knew I stuck out in the crowd
After many years growin' up brown in this town
Now this is what democracy looks like
Not what you all had in mind for tonight
Mr. Mayor, shell-shocked for 5 days straight
Press conference, lookin' constipated and pale
Tossed a homie in jail, wasn't even protesting
Wrong place, wrong time, learned a quick lesson
But this is not a question what we did to deserve this
Rich kids went and got arrested on purpose
But was it worth it? My first inclination
Globalization is the root of the pain
Made the reason that they left and the reason that we came
Catch my breath, blood pulsates my brain
And they called it a riot?
Huh, I call it an uprising
And they call this a riot?
But nah, I call it an uprising
And they call this a riot?
Nah man fuck that, I'ma call it a uprising
[Chorus]
50,000 deep, and it sound like thunder when our feet pound streets
50,000 deep, and it sound like thunder when our feet pound streets, c'mon y'all
50,000 deep, and it sound like thunder when our feet pound streets, yeah!

But, uh, sometimes you just gotta let it out

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, look, I'm the property of October
I ain't drive here, I got chauffeured
Bring me champagne flutes, rosé and some shots over
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke goodie, no glaucoma, I'm a stockholder
Private flights back home, no stop over
Still spittin' that shit that they shot Pac over
The shit my mother look shocked over
Yeah, but with a canvas I'm the Group of Seven
A migraine, take two Excedrin
I'm the one twice over, I'm the new eleven
And if I die I'ma do it reppin', I never do a second
I swear niggas be eyein' me all hard
And lyin' to they girls and drivin' the same cars
Sittin' there wishin' their problems became ours
‘Cause we have nothin' in common since I done became star
I done became bigger, swervin', writin' in my peers' lane
Same dudes that used to holler my engineer's name
One touch, I could make the drapes and the sheers change
And show me the city that I without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out, baby, word to Chuck Inglish
Count my own money, see the paper cut fingers
My song is your girlfriend's waking-up ringer
Heh, or alarm, or whatever
She be here at six in the morn' if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
'Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figure
How to get these label heads to offer him good figures
And me doin' the shows gettin' everyone nervous
'Cause them hipsters gon' have to get along with them hood niggas
It's all good, I'm goin' off like lights when the show's over
Make pasta, rent a movie, call hoes over
Rest in peace to Heath Ledger, but I'm no joker
I'll slow roast ya, got no holster
Wet glass on your table, nigga; no coaster
Burn bread everyday, boy; no toaster
G and Tez got a SIG, but I'm no smoker
They just handin' chips to me, nigga; no poker
I'm with it, Young Money, Cash Money soldier
My cup runneth over
The same niggas I ball with, I fall with
On some southern drawl shit
Rookie of the year, '06 Chris Paul shit

And I'd take probation
I don't want that T.I. and Vick vacation
Private plane, pick location
I'm goin' to the bank to make a big donation
Yeah, I don't stunt, I stunt hard
And if the food ain't on the stove I hunt for it
But in the meantime you can call me young Roy
Jones Jr. fightin' the drugs and gun charge
Shit, don't leave me unguarded
And I'm a cheesehead, word to Vince Lombardi
Word to Marky Mark, leave a snitch departed
All that blood like the Red Sea parted
My gun go crazy like it's retarded
Red light on it like it's recording
I ain't recordin', I'm just C-4in'
My currency foreign; we are in a league they aren't
Better dig in your pocket and pay homage
Better cover your eyes, your face fallin'
Watch the game from the side, I'm play callin'
No, I didn't say that I'm flawless
But I damn sure don't tarnish
My pistol got comments for your garments
I'm so high I can vomit on a comet

You know what they say 'bout when your palm itch
I'm gon' get money, money I'm gon' get

And get that toilet paper quick, like when Bones spit
That's right, bitch, I'm back on my grown shit

So fly I'ma take off when I leap
Bye! And you can suck my wings
Stand on my money, headbutt Yao Ming
Put your hand in the oven if you touch my things

A 12-pack of swill and when you're nappin' ooh-ooh
I'll set fire to your bed, let the flames shave your head
For the things to Caitlyn you said
I'd leave you for dead if I could get away with it
You even taped up the kitty door so no one could play with it
You did the same thing to Linden
To whom I served din-din
I wish you were going to the hell we've been in but it doesn't exist
And there's no god either
No real mortal leader
I need a breather!
I don't need to be subtle to leave you befuddled
Cause you're too lazy to write a rebuttal
Can't finish grad school think that's cool but it's sad
If I wanted to watch football I'd live with my dad
I make rap masterpieces
You can't complete your crap Masters thesis? (Loser)
Just count calories and manufacture allergies
You make 5 times our salaries but you're late with the rent
On time with the cable
You watch Friends while we are friends
All you're giving this house is crumbs on the table
From a Food Not Bombs bagel
Won't lend your books but there's dust on your Hegel
I nearly puked when you showed up to U.S. Maple
Think you're a Chapel Hill staple?
Think you're subletting through April?
We're getting you off the lease while you are gone cause
You're a bigger a-hole than I'm considered my my label

Look, when I'm being a pompous bastard
My friends love me enough to bring me back down to their planet
And so, this is a real stretch to say to you because I don't love you like, you know, they love me
But you're making sure that nobody loves you, you're alienating everybody!
So just beware, or you'll be alone

You're a bee-itch. I hate you. Meow"

1995

[Verse 1: Big Gipp]
Sometimes words are enough to kill over
Thanksgiving didn't give, so what should I hope for?
I keep on looking for job but job seems not to like me
What else? My door's kick off the hinges
Somebody just filled they Christmas list off me and the family
And damn, I just missed them
Felt like I've been raped, a finger's been through my drawers
Always read the clause in between the black
Spent my summers in the country, so I consider myself a Jack
Some left this world by putting bullets in they head
But little Johnnie across the street hung hisself from his bunk-bed
Had to go to court in the mornin'
Nothing hard about it
My little partner was just scared
How scared, Gipp? That scared
Sesame Street
[Verse 2: T-Mo]
When I was BG, used to think I couldn't be hit
None of my homies carried guns, all I had was a stick
Coming out hard was the way from day one
One of the smallest muthafuckers in the crew
But you knew and feel the type of niggas that kill
Be the ones that's out to prove something
To them older niggas 'cause they already know the outcome
What's going down at the party?
So many fine hoes nobody knows why we buck
I guess we up in a rut looking for butt at the same time
Up in the Flame supporting girls up in the game
Out to get a piece of what the system has designed black folks to struggle for
So I bust, so much to deal with
Can't feel what's real from fake
For my sake I stay close to home, so them crackers don't take
And never give back to my hood
In desperate need of change
To this way, so we arrange it to fit me
Growing up on Sesame Street

[Hook]
Can you feel, what I feel?
Can you hear, what I hear?
Can you see, what I see?
When my feet hit the streets
What chu know? (What chu know?)
What chu know? (What chu know?)
Can you feel, what I feel?
Can you hear, what I hear?
Can you see, what I see?
When my feet hit the streets
What chu know? (What chu know?)
What chu know? (What chu know?)
About Sesame Street?
[Verse 3: Khujo]
Georgia Power wants to put me in the dark
But one spark, I see Sammy streak to my spot
In the red Fred Sanford truck
Undercover but he geela folks for da class ""A"" sub-
Stance narcotic, South stopping at ""shock-a-locka""
I'm too mad to be scared
So for the price if you go it like that
To be the boss, you gladly pay it
An arm and a leg, I'd be lying if I said
I ain't need no help, can't do it by myself
Raining sesame, 'cause it's only so much time left
In this crazy world, mates in prison, guards life with a hammer
So, excuse my grammar
Behind the walls of Atlanta Federal Pen
The jail on Fred Stock, the cell blocks wit more C.O.'s
Equipped with radios
The system is fraud and the security cameras
Now have we an eyeball on it yet
The second stage is denied
I wonder if I get another trial

[Verse 4: Cee-Lo]
Remember me from way back in the days?
Lived right around the corner from Benjamin Mays
I'm amazed that we made it this far
A poor black family is all that we are
Wishing upon a star for a trace of happiness
My mama do her best but she ain't making no progress
Maybe it's a test that we all gotta pass
My situations making me grow too fast
13-and-a-half years old
Standing at the bus stop alone in the cold
On my way to be degraded for a fee
To help get my family off this street called Sesame
[Hook]
Can you feel, what I feel?
Can you hear, what I hear?
Can you see, what I see?
When my feet hit the streets
So what chu know? (What chu know?)
What chu know? (What chu know?)
Can you feel, what I feel?
Can you hear, what I hear?
Can you see, what I see?
When my feet hit the streets
Now what chu know? (What chu know?)

Have you ever popped champagne on a plane, while gettin' some brain?
Whipped it out, she said ""I never seen Snakes on a Plane""

Havin' money's not everything, not havin' it is
I was splurgin' on Tryst, but when I get my card back
Activated, I'm back to Vegas (Welcome the good life)

Befo' I had it, I closed my eyes and imagined the good life

Rock your vest, keep your whip tinted
So now we see him up in Bojangles strangling a forty ounce
With ten G's worth of gold bangles

Took thirty G's worth of jewels off that nigga, do him

Style Wars,Lakim Shabazz,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","[Verse 1: Lakim Shabazz]
See, what you gotta do is man your battle stations I'm gracin
Contest, start the process of elimination
Make a maneouvre, you move too fast to see
Who's next up? Let's see who's last decree
My strike is fatal, you feel the wrath, you're doomed
Today is gonna be dog day's afternoon
Rappers, I torture, teach em what naughty means
Pick 'em like coffee beans and show em what 'off me' means
They go against, they never win, they get dock-seated
Lyrics hit you so hard you think you had a shock treatment
Rappers, I pass flash by 'em like a thunderclap
My mic is a axe, so call me a rapping lumberjack
A terrorizin terror makin no errors
You're a duck, so I'ma pluck all of your feathers
My voice remounts, it's full like a fountain
MCs, I caught em, manslaughter em while I'm countin
They mullah, then I look in they crew's eye
Watch em take a deep breath, then step from the set
'Cause my killer instincts will show in deadly ways
Look around, can you count all the heads I laid?
Lak Shabazz, a menace, a real trouble maker
Let it be known that I'm hard, I love to take a
Weak wack rapper and make him look down to me
Because he looks like Bozo the Clown to me
Everything is serious, nothin to smile for
You gotta brace yourself for the style wars
[Hook]
(Ready to go to war - now)
(We are ready to go to war - now)
(We are ready to go to war - now)

[Verse 2: Lakim Shabazz]
Well, I'm back to attack, clash of a mic and a titan
I'm fully equipped to rip and totally enlighten
Lyrics are swift and smooth, hit you real, see
When you hear em, you forget all about the beat
Lak's the name, not a game like double dare
MC' get scared or beware because trouble's here
You wanna battle me? Hey look, go for it
Your lyrics are old school, prehistoric
Ancient, corroded and busted
Greasy and dirty and full of combustion
What a flop, what a pity, what a waste of time
You want def rhymes? Here's a taste of mine
Lyrics I write contain a hard, def style
Yours are soft and moist, made out of textile
( ? ), put em in the double x file
Of wack rappers, they gotta exiled
Call me an undertaker, I use my mic like a guillotine
Take 10 seconds to find out what killer mean
There's always a sucker in the crowd that'll spill the beans
So just bodybag him and ship him to the Philippines
Mission accomplished like I promised
You're on a wack staff, I got the last laugh
I'm cold serious, nothin to smile for
You gotta brace yourself for the style wars
[Hook]
Cause these are the style wars
DJ Cee Just
(We are ready to go to war - now)

Ah yeah, Flavor Unit in effect

Righteous Force Productions in effect
You know what I'm sayin
Cold rippin off necks

And I'm outta here
We in effect, y'all

[Intro]
Uh
Something new

[Chorus]
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll

[Verse 1]
Niggas wanna try, niggas wanna lie
Then niggas wonder why niggas wanna die
All I know is pain, all I feel is rain
How can I maintain with that shit on my brain?
I resort to violence, my niggas move in silence
Like you don't know what our style is, New York niggas the wildest
My niggas is with it, you want it? Come and get it
Took it then we split it, you fuckin' right we did it
What the fuck you gon' do when we run up on you?
Fuckin' with the wrong crew, don't know what we goin' through
I'ma have to show niggas how easily we blow niggas
Lemme find out there's some more niggas that's runnin' with your niggas
Nothin' we can't handle, break it up and dismantle
Light it up like a candle just 'cause I can't stand you
Put my shit on tapes like you bustin' grapes
Think you holdin' weight then you haven't met the apes
[Chorus]
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll

[Verse 2]
Is y'all niggas crazy? I'll bust you and be Swayze
Stop actin' like a baby, mind your business, lady
Nosy people get it too, when you see me spit at you
You know I'm tryin' to get rid of you, yeah I know, it's pitiful
That's how niggas get down, watch my niggas spit rounds
Make y'all niggas kiss ground just for talkin' shit, clown
Oh, you think it's funny? Then you don't know me, money
It's about to get ugly, fuck it, dawg, I'm hungry
I guess you know what that mean, come up off that green
Rob niggas on Ravine, don't make it a murder scene
Give a dog a bone, leave a dog alone
Let a dog roam and he'll find his way home
Home of the brave, my home is a cage
And, yo, I'm a slave 'til my home is the grave
I'ma pull capers, it's all about the papers
Bitches caught the vapors and now they wanna rape us

[Chorus]
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
[Verse 3]
Look what you done started, asked for it, you got it
Had it, shoulda shot it, now you're dearly departed
Get at me, dawg, did I rip shit? With this one here I flip shit
Niggas know when I kick shit it's gon' be some slick shit
What was that look for when I walked in the door?
Oh, you thought you was raw? Boom, not anymore
'Cause now you on the floor wishin' you never saw
Me walk through that door with that four-four
Now it's time for bed, two more to the head
Got the floor red, yeah, that nigga's dead
Another unsolved mystery, it's goin' down in history
Niggas ain't never did shit to me, bitch-ass niggas can't get to me
Gots to make a move, got a point to prove
Gotta make 'em groove, got 'em all like, ""Ooh""
So 'til the next time you hear this nigga rhyme
Try to keep your mind on gettin' pussy and crime

Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop

'Cause I ain't a crook, despite how I look

They judging us brothers like covers on books
Follow me into a flow

I'm hitting 'em out of the doors
So simple and slow, they step on the flow
I'm fucking the sluts and hoes
The bigger the butts, the tighter the clothes
They givin' ya jim many blows
Then what do you know? It's off with some clothes
Proud when the crowd says ""ho""
That let's me know they know I can flow
I love when they come to my shows
I get up and go with skins before
When I'm collecting my dough
I let 'em respect the way that I rep
The quicker the nigga can wreck
The bigger the check, now watch how they sweat
Now what kind of style is that?
The style of a mack and ready to jack
I ran through the piles of wack
The wacker the pack, the fatter the smack
They hate it when real niggas bust
They hate when I cuss, they threaten to bust
I had enough of the fuss
I bust what I bust and cuss when I must
They gave me a charge for sales
For selling the tales of young Black males

Same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When it's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl
And we all get involved in it
And we should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge of honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoever's holdin'
The most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs 'til it's over
But tonight, we ain't come in here to beef with nobody

No question I’m the answer which begets the motive
For why - Hénèle aX opponents
And I - He whose soul control lives
Outside of this dimension
Somebody better tell these muthaphukaz cause they musta got dementia
They must be talking to somebody else
And the fact is I don’t need nobody else
But, the extra small circle rather square I run with
The extra baggage I simply dump it
I think everybody on some dumb shit
Maybe me too – but you-don’t-run-this – settle down…

[HOOK]

[VERSE 2]
I need space – even though we in the Matrix
I want loose like a tooth in a face kick
Dark soul heavy heart like my bass kick
Mass graves is them holes in my basement
Counterbalanced by the holes in my heart
Each one get exposed by the throws given placement
Are you even listenin’
If not it’s a sin
And if this not discipline then
I did not pick up one seed I was given when
The fruit from the tree I feed from was giving me
I couldn’t be more down if I was given seats
We two parts one heart that got given beats
February demonstrate how you live in leaps
How dare you ever question how I live and eat
I beat you up and down any given SPEECH……

And my return (yeah!) is more like a re-up
I hold a whole like a tea-cup
World in one hand, while the other hand throw the peace up
My other hand throwing ""We"" without the e up (Westside)
I got like five more, man, I'm something like Shiva
In that Fall of Rome Number Four Deluxe
See, I've been around the world like the gnome
But I come from a zone where the homes are beat up
The folks, unknowns, and the stones all meet up
Police tap my phone, got my songs on speaker
Say he spat the poems, got their domes all geeked up
To get up on they thrones and become young leaders
Oprah put it on my culture, now, if that ain't wrong
Imus got it from the rhymers, now, if that ain't blown
They gave my man forty-four, now, if that ain't long
I put it all on my shoulders, now, if that ain't strong
I made it out alive from the streets of the west side C-H-I
Now, if that ain't home, you better tell 'em

Assalamu Alaikum to the maker of the ""Vivrant""
Them other niggas I don't vibe with
Now I was 'bout three when the eyes went
But I could see everything that you trying to be
You can't hide it
While you coming out your throat like a Heimlich
I came up out the belly like an Hype script
Only my circumstance revised it
Hijacked the role and went and shot the pilot
I'm trying to go public so I can get to private
Then send Busy to go and get the pirates
Then hit Africa and try to fix the virus
Go back to the hood, tell Huggy, ""Open the hydrants""

On such a timeless flight

On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

[Verse 2]
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinkin' to myself
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

[Chorus]
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here""
[Verse 3]
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes bends, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget

[Verse 4]
So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here
Since 1969""
And still those voices are callin'
From far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

[Chorus]
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis""
[Verse 4]
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice, and she said
""We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device""
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

[Verse 5]
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
""Relax,"" said the night man
""We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave""

Stairway to Heaven,Led Zeppelin,"['rock', 'blues', 'alternative', 'metal', 'pop']","[Intro]

[Verse 1]
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven
There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

[Chorus]
Ooh, it  makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder

[Verse 2]
There's a feeling I get when I look to the West
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking
[Chorus]
Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder

[Verse 3]
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woahhh

[Verse 4]
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

[Chorus]
And it makes me wonder
Ohh, woah

[Verse 5]
Your head is humming, and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow? And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?
[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one, and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll

And she's buying a stairway to Heaven"

Then write sixteens in between runnin' sixteen bid'nesses
All the while showin' these young punks what the bid'ness is

A cool breeze, got my lips chap, morning slap some
Soul in my breadbasket gap contain
X marks the spot, Twain, O.C., the cut laying

A buck thirty looking ugly, think but it ain't gonna stop no show
Ol' bird putting a buzz in you ear, ""It's gon' snow""

But yet still when niggas feel they can deal
I will split your ass up for real

And I can get on the mic with no time to waste
Get right up in your face, kick the flavor you taste

Didn't come for no beef cause I don't eat steak
I got a plate of soul food chicken, rice and gravy
Not covered in too much
Drinking a cup of punch, tropical
Every last Thursday of the month

[Verse 2: Big Gipp]
Daddy put tha hot grits on my chest in tha morning
When I was sick Mary had tha hot soup boiling
Didn't know why but it felt so good
Like some waffles in that morning
Headed back to tha woods

Got some soul on blast in tha cassette
Food for my brain
I haven't stopped learning yet
Hot wings from Mo-Joes
Got my forehead sweating
Celery and blue cheese on my menu next

Southern Fry won't allow my body to lie still
Tied face goons surround me like cancer drill
Me with second-hand obstables

Shut up clown don't talk to me

Get to see the sun rise

Another chance to get further away from where I've been
But I'll never forget

Because If I hada went and took the easy way
Wouldn't be the strong nigga that I am today
Everythang that I did
Different thangs I was told
Just ended up being food for my soul

Churches dropping chicken in yesterday's grease
Didn't go together with this quart of Mickey's
Last night hanging over from a good time
Yeah beef is cheaper but
It's pumped with ""red dye"" between two pieces of bread

Wish I could cut her up but, ma stomach come before sex
A house full of hoes now what's the ingredient
Spaghetti plus her monthly flow

Fuck Chris Darden, fuck Marcia Clark
Taking us when we're in the spotlight for a joke
Changing by the day I see it's getting bigga in my square
Looking at Lenox from the outside
With a stare no money to go inside
Tameka and Tiffany outside tripping
And skipping rope to the beats from my jeep
As I speak wuz up from the driver seat

[Verse 7: CeeLo Green]
A heaping helping of fried chicken
Macaroni and cheese and collard greens
Too big for my jeans
Smoke steams from under the lid that's on the pot
Ain't never had a lot, but thankful for
The little that I got
Why not be?
Fast food got me feeling sick
Them crackers think they slick
By trying to make this bullshit affordable
I thank the Lord that my voice was recordable

And Miss Lady acting like we in jail
Says she ain't got no extra hush puppies to sell

It was a line at Tha Beautiful
JJ'S Ribshack was packed too
Looking to be one of dem days
When Momma ain't cooking
Everybody's out hunting with tha family
Looking for a little soul food

[Hook]
Come and get yo' soul food, well well
Good old-fashioned soul food, all right
Everythang is for free
As good as it can be
Come and get some soul food"
Thought Process,Goodie Mob,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: T-Mo]
Let me get a chop at this lumber
Niggas from down Underground they hangin' around the A-Town
Lookin' for a come up, workin' from 9 to 5
Just to get some change so T-Mo can stay alive
Not greedy or livin' lavish yet, but you can bet
That when I do, nobody from my crew will I forget
And if I start to get large and come up on some change
I won't change, everybody know they down
It's not the same, everyday life can be different
These laws got me ready to brawl 'cause I fall a victim
So I still be slangin' them fat pillows to make 'em meet
Each and every day as I comb my city streets
Sometimes I wish I never had been a part of this mess
'Cause the system got us fucked up
It put us to the test, women and men, if you black, you in
Food for the soul, listen to what I tell you
It don't matter young or old, it's time we loc' up
And do like we suppose
We killin' each other over this bullshit and some clothes
We trapped off in this world's society with no place else to go
So how you feel?
[Verse 2: Khujo]
Frustrated, irritated
Sometimes I don't know myself, I be too numb
To feel something sometimes, so I dig deep
Get in the Cherokee
Let my mind fly free into the wilderness
So I can get this shit off my mind
That's why I be smokin' that dank sometimes
It keep me from snappin', keeps me calm
Keeps my mind open, keeps me fond
Of what I gots to do off in the studio
To get my old bird back on her feet
And my little bro in Statesboro
And my little cuz Mark Twain, all my folks that hang with me
When I was out in the trap or when I was goin'
Through one of our episodes, only God knows
What I go through, so I get down on my knees
Sometimes I come home too high to pray
But I get on my bed, lay on my back
And meditate, anyway, in the ceiling
The four walls, it's like cell therapy
Got nothing to do but write about my L-I-F-E
Put it down on paper...
Man, so what you feelin' like?

[Bridge: Cee-Lo & Khujo]
I live for today, motherfuck another hour, it might be sour
Never know my day so I'm prayin' in the shower
Look up and thank the Lord for forgiveness, a witness to bad
I'm lookin' for good in the Southwest, God bless my neighborhood
There's people killin' in the street to eat
Survivin’ the day is the only goal that I set
Just to make it home, I'm not alone
Someone's out to get me when I haven't done shit wrong
[Verse 3: Big Gipp]
My head felt swoll, messed up, couldn't see past my mouth
“What route did you take, man?” Got me by the loops of my pants
Got me on the curb lettin' the traffic pass me by
No questions, I said nothing
Lookin' for the mutant to be buckin' the law, naw man, Gipp
Showed him my shit, closed my mouth then I dip
See to me a G is a person who understands the plan
Can't make no moves when you in the hands of the man
They got some new suites down Peachtree
Left wing for the Feds, right wing for the hardheads
Makin' more deals than Buddy Fowlkes made with Hartsfield
Somebody don't want my face in this place for ‘96, shit's slick
Car be clean lookin' fresh, dog be scratchin' at my chest
Under the order of who? Guess who, ain't none iller
Than Miller, wanna 1-2 your ass
No more life what you gave is the past, cause ain't no future
Wanna “Miller camp” your case, disgrace your face
Make it seem to be safe, ain't no place to run

[Verse 4: Cee-Lo]
Sometimes I don't even know how I'm gon' eat
'Bout twenty dollars away from being on the street
Shit, you might see a nigga on TV
But hell, it's almost like I'm rappin' for free
That little money be gone
God dammit, I'm grown
Gotta help keep the heat and lights on
It would be nice to have more but I kinda like bein' poor
At least I know what my friends here for
I wanna lie to you sometimes, but I can't
I wanna tell you that it's all good, but it ain't
It's niggas hurtin' and uncertain about
If they gon' make it or not, that's why we got niggas killing
Feelin' like they comin' up off a little dope they sold
You can get some gold but we won't make it as a whole
'Cause without you, there'd be no me
And without no unity there will never be any happiness
You could smoke a pound of sess
And it still won't relieve your stress
God bless... my thought process
[Verse 5: André 3000]
The thought process... Now-
Now as an Outkast, I was born, wasn't warned of the harm
That would come to meet me like Met Life, but yet life
Done sent me through a lot of ups and downs like it ain't nothin'
Like elevators but I ain't the one that's pushin' the buttons
I got off at the 13th floor, when they told me that it wasn't one
They said it skipped from 12 to 14
Still smoking, still drinking
No, I'm sittin' on the Lincoln 4 AM thinking
That in reality the world is like a ball full of players
We trapped off in this maze with walls made of layers
And only prayer is the tightest game that you can have
The devil's takin' a swing, that might explain the broken glass
But my crystal ball see the pistol fall to the wayside
Nobody would die in cops and robbers when we used to play, right?
Huh, the only thing we feared was Williams, Wayne
Never thought about hittin' licks or slangin' 'caine
Did not think I'd be the one to give in to abortion
Label me ""murderer"" because my ass is scorchin'
Hot from the Glock that sits under my seat
Yeah, it's real fucked up that my folks come to get me
And it's like dat...yeah, uh-huh, yeah, and it's like dem!"
Premeditated Murder,J. Cole,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'jazz', 'pop', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","[Verse 1]
Am I changing right before your eyes?
Becoming someone you don't recognize
As if I was disguised, I'm on that shit as if I was the flies
I'm touching skies, no puffing lye
Man these songs that I made in my bedroom and shit
Goin' finally give a nigga leg room in the whip
From a Civic to a seven must've died and went to heaven
Like a passenger on 9/11, please go find a reverend
You see I promised that I'd never change
But that was way before I made the dough and met the game
Say hello to Miss Thang, I forgot yo name, she yellow
And even white women want a nigga, Othello
I'm balling with nuggets, like fuck it I'm Carmelo
Now the crib got much rooms, Portobello
She drop it low and then she bust moves for the fellow
I sit your ass down like you was playing a cello
See, you niggas hated and I levitated further
Knew I would kill the game, premeditated murder
So if it comes down, may the best man win
No sweat like a headband then, nigga
[Chorus]
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No, it can't get no better for me
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No, it can't get no better for me

[Verse 2]
I'ma kill the game and invite witnesses
No death penalty, I'm giving life sentences
Like keep grinding boy, your life can change in one year
And even when it's dark out, the sun is shining somewhere
Yeah, look here I paid dues
My own worst enemy so fuck it, either way I can't lose
808's so my south niggas feel me
Light-skinned it so the house niggas feel me
She catch me creeping out your house she'll kill me
Is it worth for what's under that blouse?
My heart'll turn pitch black and cold if I split with my girl
If I could gift-wrap the globe, I would give you the world
But, do you love me like you used to?
Even though I ain't that nigga that you're used to
Remember back when I was broke? You would fix me
Do you prefer the broke me or the rich me?
The broke me couldn't buy you meals, not even a value meal
And now I pay for everything, how you feel?
Mixed feelings 'cause now all the chicks feeling him
You gotta adapt though, I'm never going back
[Chorus]
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
Hey, you know it can't get no better for me
No, it can't get no better for me
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
Hey, you know it can't get no better for me
No, it can't get no better for me

[Outro]
I can't keep running away
I can't keep running away
I swear I'm coming back one day
Hey
What if I'm wrong
And I ain't got what it takes
Then all them people that was counting on me
Boy won't you climb down the mountain for me"
Whats Hardcore,K'naan,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","[Verse 1]
I put a pen to the paper
This time as visual as possible
Guns blast at the hospital
The walls are white washed with tin rooftops
To show love, you lick two shots
It's dangerous man
Journalists hire gunmen, there's violent women
Kids trust no one cause fire burnt them
Refugees die in boats, headed for peace
Is anyone scared of death here? Not in the least
I walk by the old lady selling coconuts under the tree
Life is cheap here, but wisdom is free
The beach boys hang on the side, leaning with pride
Scam artists and gangsters fiending to fight
I walk with three kids that can't wait to meet God
Lately, that's Bucktooth, Muhammad and Crybaby
What they do everyday just to eat, Lord have mercy
Strapped with an AK and they bloodthirsty

[Hook]
So what's hardcore?
Really, are you hardcore? Hmm
[Verse 2]
We begin our day by the way of the gun
Rocket propelled grenades blow you away if you front
We got no police ambulance or fire fighters
We start riots by burning car tires
They looting, and everybody start shooting
Bullshit politicians talking about solutions, but it's all talk
You can't go half a block without a road block
You don't pay at the road block you get your throat shot
And each road block is set up by these gangsters
And different gangsters go by different standards
For example, the evening is a no-go
Unless you wanna wear a bullet like a logo
In the day you should never take the alleyway
The only thing that validates you is the AK
They chew on Jad, it's sorta like coca leafs
And there ain't no police

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'mma spit these verses cause I feel annoyed
And I'm not gonna quit till I fill the void
If I rhyme about home and got descriptive
I'd make 50 Cent look like Limp Bizkit
It's true, and don't make me rhyme about you
I'm from where the kids is addicted to glue
Get ready, he got a good grip on the machete
Make rappers say they do it for love like R. Kelly
It's hard, harder than Harlem and Compton intertwined
Harder than harboring Bin Laden and rewind
(To that earlier part when I was kinda like)
We begin our day by the way of the gun
Rocket propelled grenades blow you away if you front
We got no police ambulances or fire fighters
We start riots by burning car tires
They looting, and everybody starts shooting

[Verse 1]
Ayo, I shatter dreams like Jordan, assault and batter your team
Your squadron'll be barred from rap
Like Adam and Eve from the garden
I'm carvin' my initials on your forehead
So every night before bed, you see the BP shine off the boardhead
Reverse that, I curse at the first wack nigga with the worst rap
'Cause he ain't worth jack
Hit him with a thousand pounds of pressure per slap
Make his whole body jerk back, watch the Earth crack
Hand him his purse back
I'm the first Latin rapper to baffle your skull
Master the flow, niggas be swearin' I'm blacker than coal
Like Nat King, I be rappin' in tongues
Packin' the ones; Magnums, cannons and Gatling guns
It's Big Pun, the one and only son of Tony Montana
You ain't promised mañana in the rotten manzana
Come on, pana, we need more rhymers
Feel the marijuana, snake bite, anaconda
A man of honor wouldn't wanna try to match my persona
Sometimes rhymin', I blow my own mind like Nirvana
Comma, and go the whole nine like Madonna
Go try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar
[Chorus]
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination

[Verse 2]
I'm pure adrenaline, uncut, straight to the gut, medicine
Raw cure for pain, I coat your brain like polyurethane
Simple and plain, I'll explain it in layman terms
If you came to learn how to make fire, I'mma make it burn
Higher and hotter than lava, the scholar adviser
As smart as MacGyver, could put honor inside the heart of a liar
Involved in a life of crime, fuck it, I like the shine
Up in the white and lime, clutched with the pipe design
Plushed out (No doubt), both pockets about to bust out
If you not in it for the spinach, GET THE FUCK OUT!
Take a hike, we can even battle to make it right
Go 'head, lace the mic, you finished? SAY GOODNIGHT!
Head-to-head in the street, I'll leave you dead in your feet
Settlin' beef, I'll even let you rhyme to the ""Benjamins"" beat
But it won't matter, your dreams still gon' shatter
It's a long ladder to climb, and mine is on the stagger
So get outta town, 'fore I hit you with the loudest sound
You ever heard; Desert Bird, player, you outta bounds
[Chorus]
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination

[Verse 3]
You know the Pun'll diss you if your whole steez is unofficial
I'll come and get you and let the Desert Eez tongue-kiss you
With one pistol and two clips, I'll make your crew do flips
Like acrobatics, I'm charismatic, my gat is magic
It makes rappers disappear, whisper in your ear, crystal clear
""Come here, let me kiss your tears!""
Everything you fear is here, you ain't gotta search further
The first murder's the worst, now I thirst further
For reverse birth, every verse hurts, every curse word's
Already more offendin' than Eddie Murph's worst
I thirst for blood like a vampire
Any man claimin' his game's tighter IS A GODDAMN LIAR!
I set 'em on fire, retire your train of thought
Drain a quart of blood out ya brain and leave ya insane in the dark
The King of New York, lays his crown in the Boogie Down
And sprays the town with the MAC, hoodied down
I'm no joke, I'll soak your face with a sweeper
Die, you a disgrace, or face your death through the speaker
[Chorus]
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken

Pimping ain't dead 'cause I be the lifeline

Go on, let that light shine, balling for a lifetime
Smoking on that nice pine, Weezy baby flight-flying
You can call him your husband, call me at nighttime
And even though women change, I will always like dimes
And yeah, I'm quite fine, but shawty much finer
And I just get behind her and smack it like E. Honda

Chilling with my posse, 'bout to call some ladies over (Uh-huh)
Tell them this is YME, so when you come, you can't leave sober (Right)

Put her on a tab, now she rolling like a baby stroller (Ah)
I’m the freshest niggas seen (Seen), weapon in my jeans (Jeans)
Shoot your lights out, I’m like Redick with the beam (Beam)
Life's a game of chess, and I'm heading for your queen (Uh-huh)
Not my stomach and my thighs, but her head is in between (Eww)
She wetter than a stream (Yeah), I drink medicine to lean (Sipping)
Keep a cup in my hand like I'm begging for some cheese (Haha)
I fall off in the party (Ugh), yeah, I'm kinda tardy (I know)

And famous bitches doing nose candy all around me
Welcome to the life, the life that's meant for me
My Bentley has a tint, and so you got to squint to see

Hiatus,Joe Budden,['hip hop'],"[Verse: Joe Budden]
Two years, waits up, still sleep, wake-up
Girl gone, break-up, mind right, cake up
Friends came, friends left
Bullshit is endless, been next
Hip-Hop, really not impressed
Maybe just my love died
Sober, still above high
Slugs fly, eyes sucked dry, still a thug cries
I cried 'till I can't cry no more
Believe my own nonsense, I can't lie no more
Soul dead, breathless; I can't sigh no more
Wheels already fell off, I can't ride no more
I guess I pack up all of my belongings and just troop it
You know it's beef when a smart nigga gets stupid
Cause then it's justified, rationale nullified
Steven shot 8 times, almost thought my brother died
See he was raised different, I know his mother tried
His arms tied, I'm trying to teach dude to touch the sky
But still shorty wild, turned on by 40 Cals
Was young, never saw me wild, clutch Robert Horry style
No wonder I picked-up triggers to beef
I only ever fist fought wit niggas bigger than me
I never been the one to try and grab shit in my reach
Incompliant, you have now witnessed the breach
I feel like life is all written, understand my math
Got on my knees, told God I had a plan, He laughed
I mean... hours passed, no sleep, cowards get a slow leak
Showered twice the whole week, powerless control freak
Thinkin' about suicide, won't though I'm scrutinized
Life nigga; do or die, hood want 'em crucified
Jewelry on, fresh dressed, model broads excess
Phone calls, death threats, tell me what's the next step
What's what, who's who, paranoid as usual
Grippin' on my deuce-deuce, either way a lose-lose
All I need is one mic, razor blades, gun fights
Room without no sunlight, understand son's plight
If done right, won't seek and fail
I don't follow the path, I'm creatin' my own to leave a trail
It's no rhyme or reason nor reason or rhyme
No more food for thought, shit deceasin' the mind
Now they doubtin' my desire, second guessin' my fashion
Like bringin' of weapons of mass in when you question my passion
I live for this, not the Baguettes and the fame
Got signed havin' an answer, then the question changed
Sayin' Jump Off don't sound right is blasphemous downright
I astound mics, music is just what feelings sound like
So even though when I do it it's flames
For a while felt like I was makin' music in vain
We don't do it same, I use it for change
Y'all do it for change, I use it for pain
But keep doin' ya thang' Soundscan skyrocket
Build all this hype 'bout it, prayin' people might cop it
This is just my logic, maybe it's psychotic
Though labels try to stop it this is my antibiotic
So lemme' start doin' what dudes like
A nigga in the booth feelin' fresher than some new Nikes
Dawg, and I cruise like cruise control
Fuck that! I can't do it, I might lose my soul
Even though it should help a nigga to his goal
Would defeat the whole purpose
Naw, that ain't what Jers is
Naw, that would be worthless
Bars soundin' nervous
A nigga much deeper than what you see on the surface
I'd rather resort back to snatchin' purses
Finally understanding what the gift and the curse is
If I was more concerned about a purchase
I would tell y'all it's about to go down like bird shit
It takes courage, me versus urges
A wordsmith that got caught-up in label merges
And what's worse is, I been deserted in the circus
Up-and-left the circuit, it's dead like hearses
Sicker than them pedophiles workin' in them churches
That ain't the type shit I deem fit for my verses
Dawg, so lemme' help niggas understand Mouse
Dawg, why try to fit in when you a stand-out?
It's no album, but the money never ran out
Aside from rap, I'm kinda' focused on land now. (You know?)
Cause I don't know whurr' the game is
I know we jus' been attacked by a Hurricane Chris
Some niggas can't fathom what money and fame is
Or some niggas get it by usin' they stainless
Or some niggas get it, but they can't sustain it
Me? I'm regular Joe, I don't let it change shit"

I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official

[Verse 1]
Y'all don't know about my Biggie wars
Who you thought Kick in the Door was for?
But that's my heart, y'all still trippin' off the Jigga shit
Real niggas listen up and I'ma tell you how the whole thing start
Off top I brung Queens up from hard times
Rockin' at the Fever, streets was all mine
It was my version of the blues, droppin' out schools
The crack epidemic had rap representin' new rules
So I got in them shoes, tried 'em, wore them
Wasn't a perfect fit so I couldn't sport 'em
Young murderers ride, I knew all them
Jungle got shot, Will died, we was warrin'
I wrote it in my album
I was 18 when Lake seen the Island, and Lord held me down and
My surroundings started changin', I had a baby
I was makin' my rounds with AZ
Niggas started noticin' my flow and was open when
The Golden Child closed 'em in
With more style than them older men
Puff tried to start a label, Prince Rakeem had formed Wu-Tang
Snoop and Dre had a new thing
So Puff drove his new Range through Queensbridge Projects
He let me drive it, before Ready to Die hit
Big and I hit blunts performin' at the Ark
Next thing you knew, Big blew and all the ballin' starts
He had Kim in his crew, I found Fox
Only niggas in New York with number one charts
Big was ahead of his time, him and Raekwon
My niggas, but dig it, they couldn't get along
That's when Ghostface said it on The Purple Tape
Bad Boy bitin' Nas album cover, wait
Big told me Rae was stealin' my slang
And Rae told me, out in Shaolin, Big would do the same thing
But I borrowed from both them niggas
Jigga started to flow like us, but hit with ""Ain't No Niggas""
Had much Versace swagger
Big admired the Brooklynite and took him in as Iceberg the rapper
Today, don't know nothin' about this boss shit
There's more shit than wantin' to be this King of New York shit
Uhh, uhh, uhh
[Chorus]
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu (uhh)
Look at the life that I've been through (yeah)
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official

[Verse 2]
Rap became a version of Malcolm and Martin
Rest in peace Will, Queensbridge live on
There's some ghetto secrets I can't rhyme in this song
There's some missing pieces I had to leave out
Had lost trust for Steve Stoute at some point 'til I got to know him
We old friends, but what's loyal?
Puff soaked Interscope offices with champagne bottles on Steve
And Steve thought the drama's on me
'Cause previously it would've been, against whoever
Friends forever
However, I learned, with some niggas it's all business
But I'm a street dude with morals
Then this nigga's with Jigga too much
He used to say Jay wanted my spot
I laughed, stayed home, never hung a lot
A quiet man who used to be alone plannin'
Baby moms thought I was too quiet, couldn't stand it
She hit the streets, later on she hittin' the sheets
With a rapper who wanted me on his songs, thinkin' he strong
I taught her how to watch for cars who might follow
Taught her street shit that I know
Her weakness was shine yo
But that's her, I ain't mad, baby, it made me stronger
Now I get my paper longer
Illmatic I was boss, It Was Written I flossed
One of the most creative LP's ever to hit stores
In The Firm I learned I Am NAStradamus
QB's Finest, Oochie Wally, faced more problems
I gave it all up so I can chill at home with Mama
She was gettin' old and sick so I stayed beside her
We had the best times, she asked would I make more songs
I told her not 'til I see her health get more strong
In the middle of that, Jay tried to sneak attack
Assassinate my character, degrade my hood
'Cause in order for him to be the Don, Nas had to go
The Gam-B-I-N-O rules I understood
What y'all want, see, I already had
The Gift and The Curse? Fuck that shit, the first you'll be last
I'm the man's man, a rapper's rapper
G-O-D, S-O-N – they'll be none after
I was Scarface, Jay was Manolo
It hurt me when I had to kill him and his whole squad for dolo...
Uhh, uhh, uhh
[Chorus]
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official"

[Verse]
Ayo, it’s Weezy Motherfucking, easy with the hating
Bitch, I’m in the building, you just decorating
I’m just detonating, then I get blatant
More dangerous than internet dating
Scoob got the cameras on, so I gotta show off
I'll put your sister on, I'll knock your bro off
Weezy spit snowballs, catch it in your face bitch
Good-Game Wayne, man, I deserve a Naismith
Cook 'caine game flow, dope in the vein flow
I only be smoking the purple out the rainbow
Stronger than Drano, your boyfriend a lame-o
And if you stay with him, then y’all in the same boat
Deep-Water Carter, fishing for a dollar
You can join the salad, I’m splitting your tom-a-ta
Ball 'cause I gotta, you’ll love me in the morning
I told her I'm a king, them other niggas Prince Charming
She love to rock my mic, she say there's nothing like performing
Man, I'm in love with her grill, George Foreman
Forewarning: Young Money’s armed
And we can shoot it out, I got the money drawn
Yeah! Take that to the bank with you
I rock my hat to the side like I paint pictures
Smoke weed, talk shit, like Lane Kiffin
Whole country in recession, but Wayne different
Huh, and I’m a Maybach rider
Haven’t drove it one time, I got a cool Black driver
Can't walk around with guns, I got a dude that got 'em
Don’t worry if I'm shootin' as long as you don't get shot (Arms)
And I'm a beast, I'm a pitbull
I get my ass kissed, I get my dick pulled
I—I'm a beast, I'm a big bull
I got my money right, I got my clip full, haha
Yeah, it’s like, seven in the morning, nigga
I’m up for whoever the opponent, nigga
Stop the track—let me relish in the moment, nigga
Now, bring that motherfucker back, 'cause I’m zoning, nigga
I go hard like Rafael Nadal
And if the bitches worth having, then I bet we have 'em all
And man, I'm so high, it's like an everlasting fall
And I’m charging these hoes like women basketball
Ugh! I bet that chopper get his mind right
Leave a hole in his chest like a lion bite
Superhero car, like I crime-fight
I see big cheese, you niggas blind mice
Ugh, T-Streets still roll with me
Still sticking to the script, like Nicole Kidman
Need the man hit? We are those hitmen
He stopped running; the bullet holes didn’t
Ugh, basically, I’m still a monster
'Til the fat lady sing—I come to kill a opera
Y'all too plain, I'm a helicopter
My words keep going, like a teleprompter
I’m a asshole—wipe me down, bitch
I get big checks—Niketown, bitch
Yeah, mean mug, Bobby Brown shit
And the flag red, like clown lips (Arms)
Ugh, T, I can't stop goin'
Drop my best shit, like the Cowboys dropped Owens
I’m the best to ever do it, motherfucker, I know it

Is this thing on?
Oh, I thought they silenced us, Ye
Power to the people

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
We livin' in that 31st century, futuristic fly shit
The penthouse is the projects and everybody flies private
New watches (You know what time it is), watch us (You see us)
They can't stop us, the prophets, biatches!

[Chorus: Kanye West, JAY-Z & Kobe]
No one man should have all that power (Yeah)
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours (Yeah)
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power
No one man should have all that power

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Rumble, young man, rumble
Life is a trip, so sometimes, you gon' stumble
You gotta go through pain in order to become you
But once the world numbs you, you'll feel like it's only one you
Man, you got the power to do anything you want to
Until you ask yourself, ""Is this what this all comes to?""
Looking at life through sunglasses and a sunroof
But do you have the power to get out from up under you?
Fuck all these labels, fuck what everybody wants from you
They tryna Axl Rose you, welcome to the jungle
To be continued, we on that Norman Mailer shit
In search of the truth even if it goes through Taylor Swift
Tell her this!
[Chorus: Kanye West, John Legend & Kobe]
No one man should have all that power

Clap, clap, clap
I seen people go crazy when the whole world in our lap
Clap, clap, clap
My socket was out the plug, now it’s time to get the power back
Clap, clap

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I seen people abuse power, use power
Misuse and then lose power
Power to the people at last, it’s a new hour
Now we all ain't gon' be American Idols
But you could 'least grab a camera, shoot a viral
Hanh! Take the power in your own hands
I’m a grown man, doing my grown dance
I don’t stop until I see the end, my vision clear, bitch
I’m on my Van Gogh, I don’t hear shit
[Chorus: Kanye West & John Legend]
No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power

Now everything I'm rhyming on cause a Ramadan
Been a don, praying for the families lost in the storm
Bring our troops back from Iraq, keep our troops out of Iran
So the next couple bars, I'ma drop 'em in Islam
They say ""As-salamu alaykum"", say ""Wa alaikum as-salaam""
That's no Oscar Mayer bacon, you should run and tell your mom

Keep Flex out of Korea, 'cause you know he drop bombs

Yeah, girl
Can you hear that? It's playing our song
Are you sleepy? Take a nap
You're not afraid of the dark, are you?

[Verse 1]
You hear the beat as it makes ya not want to go to sleep
I knock on Dakota's door; it's locked, so I go to creep
'Round the back with binoculars, not 'cause I wanna peep
But because I'm hungry, she smells like tacos, I wanna eat
Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows, all so sweet
With sugar plums; oh, look
Here comes Marshall, he's on your street
He's placing hot, smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on 'em; he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
Like a Thanksgiving turkey, a holiday ham
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite graham crackers with JonBenét Rams'
I guess a modern-day Jack the Ripper is all that I am

'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep

So won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?

And would you be my private little dancer?

[Verse 2]
I almost look comatose; who wants to be sober? Gross
I foam like a Doberman, mouth open, I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils in both my holes, then I plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged, I know
I put on my mother's makeup, get naked and run around
Wavin' the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred pounds
There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains, but the sun is out?
The devil's upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out
I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about?
Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do? It's locked
I pick it and open it, but it's stuffed full of human parts
I dig 'til I find it, I wind it up, and the tune just starts
It's playing a song, so beautiful, and the room is dark
The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park

I'm fixated on asphyxiatin' and breakin'
This little chick's neck like a Pixy Stick
The sick, Satan-worshippin' bitches get horse whippings
I'm in the back, through the back door slippin'
Through the crack, leavin' the corpse drippin'
The mortician of love, sent from above
Forced entry, the more wenchy the more stingy I become
Been doing this for more than a quarter-century, I'm just numb
Am I dreaming, is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns
The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder
I've had enough of the chatter
Climb up to the window, look at her
Then climb in slow to shatter her brain matter and batter her
With a bat; a matter of fact, that will splatter her
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her
Give her two compliments back to back, like ""Tabitha
I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya
So strong is your fight, but you're no match for Dracula""
Prolonging her plight as I go back to stabbin' her
Dismember her limbs, simple as that: cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back the camera
Stand back, 'cause here comes your man Jack, so Pamela
[Chorus]
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me

Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me

So once you call, I come, I will answer

I dream of you amid the flowers

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
As I spy from behind my giant robot's eyes
I keep him happy 'cause I might fall out if he cries
Scared of heights, so I might pass out if he flies
Keep him on autopilot 'cause I can't drive
Room enough for one, I tell my homies they can't ride
Unless they sitting on the shoulders, but that's way too high
Let's try not to step on the children
The news cameras filming this walking project building
Now there's hoes selling holes like right around the toes
And the crackheads beg at about the lower leg
There's crooked police that's stationed at the knees
And they do drive-bys like up and down the thighs
And there's a car chase going on at the waist
Keep a vest on my chest, I'm sitting in my room
As I'm looking out the face, something to write about
I still got some damage from fighting the White House

Now come on everybody, let's make cocaine cool
We need a few more half-naked women up in the pool
And hold this MAC-10 that's all covered in jewels
And can you please put your titties closer to the 22s?
And where's the champagne? We need champagne
Now look as hard as you can with this blunt in your hand
And now hold up your chain, slow-motion through the flames
Now cue the smoke machines and the simulated rain
But not too loud cause the baby's sleeping
I wonder if it knows what the world is keeping
Up both sleeves while he lay there dreaming
Me and my robot tip-toe 'round, creeping
I had to turn my back on what got you paid
I couldn't see, had the hood on me like Abu Ghraib
But I'd like to thank the streets that drove me crazy
And all the televisions out there that raised me

Soarin', is this allowed?
I sure bet my daddy proud
A little nigga with a Shaker smile
On top of the dreams is where I'm found
Some figured I was Satan bound
Until I came back with a style I found
Then all of a sudden they fixed their faces
'Cause of who I know and the trail of places
That I've stepped
How many niggas wanna hate 'cause I left?
How could you blame me and my plan of attack?
'Cause I'm risking my soul intact, now I'm heard all over the map
Only rule of thumb
It don't really matter just where you from
All that really matter is where you gon' go
Maybe upstate for some
But you can’t rule out these cats for gone
Second chances given out for some
All you gotta do is take advantage
Then maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage
Done pimpin', you can think about marriage, until then, get it
Then find yourself and let's begin
I'ma tell you how in a minute
I'ma show you how I be livin'
From a long time ago, a young nigga, he was timid
Now I'm zoned, see things so vivid
Hide my soul? Nah, homie, not even
I'ma zone out 'til I lose feeling, remember
I'ma be gone way past November
Even, stay up there, up there
Floatin', floatin', hopin'
I can find peace somewhere

Without feelin' like Shallow Hal
Diamonds on the Jesus piece for style
Back in Cleveland City we ride around
Greetin' my niggas with dap and pound
So if I fall, I won't hit the ground
These are the things that'll make me smile
Knowin' this blunt might burn a while
I keep myself so lifted
I am accustomed to new heights
I feel perfect though they think it's worthless
See without my flight, man
Everybody wanna be a critic
I have my life and I will live it
Shut your mouth before I fuck it
Ha, my jokes, they will love it
If I'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans
More than likely I am faded, man
You are not the shit if everywhere you go
Niggas ain't sitting, standing 'round hating, so
My vice is when the lights start flashin'
I'll be zonin', all alone then
And the place where my mind is goin'
Filled with songs that no one's knowin'
And the Devil in a hot pink dress
Tryna ask me for one dance
He think he slick
But my guardians protect me from his wrath
So, in my place no hate shall enter
Livin' high up there, up there
Copin', copin', floatin'
I will find peace somewhere

This Hip-Hop shit could fuck up your head man
I know a bunch of Crips that love Redman
Blood Walk in New York, man, things done change
Stop, the Chinks be all over the game
This ain't Bruce Lee, I watch too much TV
This is a game of death when I aim for your chest
Too much cess got me seein' slow motion
Eyes barely open with a roach roastin'
And your girl, she loves the Jin ocean  (Ah)
Rub it on her body like Body Shop lotion
What's the commotion, you never seen me

And pork fried rice and throw dice

Till the cowboys roll through like Clint Eastwood
I wish you would come to Chinatown
Get lost in town, end up in the lost and found
Eyewitnesses, you must be crazy
We don't speak English, we speak Chinese
And the only po-po we know is the pigs on the hood out in the window
Every time they harass me, I wanna explode
We should ride the train for free, we built the railroads

I ain't ya Jigga Man, I'm a chinaman

She looks surprised in the palm of my hands
You know what's next, safe sex
I'll be damned if I sleep in the flesh with the insect

I saw his name on the affidavit
It was written in Chinese and this is what he said:

Bring about some local hooligans and thugs so
Catch them at midnight when they close the shop up
Reading the Ten Commandments, cooking the crock up
Biggie Smalls posters are all over the walls
If they think you'd save me the bullet, it's so over ya'll

If you act otherwise, and try to demise me
Take me for granted, then try to surprise me

Because you're yellow, just like the yolk of an egg
He's DJ Diamond D, and I'm the Master Rob
MC's bitin' my rhymes like they were corn on the cob
Or should I say cake, from the bites you take
Know what I'm sayin'? I'm not playin'

Now you know bro, that I'm an MC pro
And like a Lamborghini, I'm geared to go
I was raised in Forrest, across from Morris
I got more hair on my chest than Chuck Norris
Smooth as suede, sharp as a blade
I'm not a knave, but rap is the trade
To get paid and laid, have it made in the shade
Here me ridin' in my car you'd think it was a parade
Sweet as lemonade; it's not a game of charades
Know what I'm sayin? I'm not playin'
Now.. why do people sweat me, they should just let me
Go my way, but they just can't forget me
Is it my rhyme, or my personality?
Could it be my values, or morality?
Whatever the case, people stay in my face
It's startin' to irk me, they tried to jerk me
But the tables are turned, it's them I'm jerkin'
I'm dead workin', and you're still lurkin'

People who never used to speak, now they scream my name
But I know that it's just a popularity game
Girls who thought they were fly, now they all say 'Hi'
But I guess they didn't get it - I'm not wid it
Cause I'm not souped, I started rappin' in a group
Problems arose, and they flew the coup
NMD, Charlie Rock, and Show and Tell
I'm the only one left, but hey that's swell
I'm not coppin' a plea, nor Diamond D
You comprehend what I'm sayin'? Dude, I'm not playin'

I'm not playin', or jokin', not from Hoboken
It's kinda hot in here that's why I'm soakin' wet
But don't fret it ain't nothin' but sweat
The name is Master Rob and I will never forget
When I was younger, and filled with hunger
Go to a jam and get told to get from under
The ropes it used to piss me off, but I was young
I'm tellin' you now, that my time has come!
And we're the pair that dares, we're not scared of stares
Do you know what I'm sayin'? I'm not playin'
.. I'm not playin'
.. know what I'm sayin'?
.. C'mon Diamond, we outta here, Strong City in effect, word up"
Tears of Joy,Rick Ross,"['hip hop', 'alternative', 'r&b', 'pop']","[Intro Skit: Bobby Seale]
Do you know what we are going to do? We are going to defend ourselves because Huey P. Newton says that, ""Power is the ability to define phenomena and make it act in a desired manner."" Power is the ability to define phenomena and make it act in a desired manner. Power: if we have the ability to define it, the only next thing to do is get organized. So when a pig walks up to you, or when a pig gets to jiving with the people you be so organized you be learning some tactics, you be learning some revolutionary principles, you be having some guns hid out somewhere, you have some proper tactics that when the pig gets to jiving with you, the pig is wrong, you whip your guns out on him, blow him away, and then you have made the ability, in fact, you have made that pig act in a desired manner

[Intro: Rick Ross]
Smokin' a fat spliff in a brand new Benz
No I.D. on the track, let the story begin, begin
Hah, yeah

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Lookin' in the mirror but I don't see much
Still runnin' the streets so I don't sleep much
Watchin' the snakes so they don't creep up
But the way I'm gettin' this money, niggas can't keep up
You niggas can't keep up
Niggas got beef but it can’t be much
I'm still walkin' through the crowds like I can't be touched
Top back all black, Gretzky puck
Ice skater lil' later might let me fuck
Damn, she might let me fuck
Last night I cried tears of joy
What did I do to deserve this?
Vacheron on my wrist a year ago
I didn't even know the bitches exist
Quarter milli for the mothafucka
No insurance on the mothafucka
Ain't life a bitch?
But you gotta keep her wet
Keys open doors so I gotta keep a set
Everybody know that I'm a lotta people's threat
Biggie Smalls in the flesh livin' life after my death
Yesterday I read my horoscope
Tell me Lord will I be poor and broke?
Tell me Lord will I be dealin' dope?
I wanna take my momma to the Poconos
But only Lord knows
[Hook: Cee-Lo Green]
Goodbye, to all the loved ones I leave behind
At least they can't see me cry
And I ask, when someone wants to be me, whyyyy
Thought havin' everything would ease my mind
If you could read my mind
My God, I'm scarred, I have tattoo tears of joy

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Last night I cried tears of joy
What did I do to deserve this?
Young rich motherfucker still uneducated
But dammit a nigga made it
Goddamn a nigga made it
Crib bigger than a church, Lord know I'm blessed
Five different lawyers, Lord know I’m stressed
A punch in the face get you 300K
Ask Vlad, now he back to makin' minimum wage
Another victim of my criminal ways
I wanna walk in the image of Christ
But that bitch Vivica nice
And I'm still swimmin' in ice
I'm just livin' my life
I'm just livin' my life
Lease a Lamborghini for your pussy rate
Life is just a pussy race
Snatch a bitch take her back to your place
Next morning I can tell you how the pussy taste
I got expensive taste

Goodbye, to all the loved ones I leave behind
At least they can't see me cry

My God, I'm scarred, I have tattoo tears of joy

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Last night I cried tears of joy
What did we do to deserve this?
Not to dwell on the the past but to keep it real
I gotta represent for Emmett Till
All the dead souls in the field
Lookin at my Rollie it's about that time
White man had a problem with mine
And we suppose to be shy?
The revolution's televised
Bobby still on the rise

I Left My Wallet in El Segundo,A Tribe Called Quest,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","[Intro]
Toqué ese guitarra!

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I got to get it, I got, got to get it
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I got to get it, I got, got to get it

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
My mother went away for a month-long trip
Her and some friends on an ocean liner ship
She made a big mistake by leaving me home
I had to roam so I picked up the phone
Dialed Ali up to see what was going down
Told him I pick him up so we could drive around
Took the Dodge Dart, a '74
My mother left a yard but I needed one more
Shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks
So we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks
Drove down the Belt, got on the Conduit
Came to a toll, and paid and went through it
Had no destination, we was on a quest
Ali laid in the back so he can get rest
Drove down the road for two-days-and-a-half
The sun had just risen on a dusty path
Just then a figure had caught my eye
A man with a sombrero who was 4 feet high
I pulled over to ask where we was at
His index finger he tipped up his hat
El segundo, he said, my name is Pedro
If you need directions, I'll tell you pronto
Need a civilization, some sort of reservation
He said a mile south there's a fast food station
Thanks, señor, as I started the motor
Ali said ""Damn, Tip, what did you drive so far for?""
[Skit]
Well, describe to me what the wallet looks like

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Anyway a gas station we passed
We got gas and went on to get grub
It was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere
Anywhere would have been better
I ordered enchiladas and I ate 'em
Ali had the fruit punch
When we finished we thought for ways to get back
I had a hunch
Ali said: pay for lunch, so I did it
Pulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked beautiful lady
She was a waitress there
Put the wallet down and stared and stared
To put me back into reality, here's Shaheed
""Yo Tip man, you got what you need?""
I checked for keys and started to step
And what do you know, my wallet I forget

[Skit]
It was a brown wallet, it had props numbers
It had my jimmy hats, I gotta get it man

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Lord, have mercy
The heat got hotter, Ali starts to curse me
I feel bad but he makes me feel badder
Chit-chit-chatter, car starts to scatter
Breaking on out, we was northeast bound
Jetting on down at the speed of sound
Three days coming and three more going
We get back and there was no slack
490 Madison, we're here, Sha
He said, ""all right, Tip, see you tomorrow
Thinking about the past week, the last week
Hands go in my pocket, I can't speak
Hopped in the car and torped' to the shack
Of Shaheed, we gotta go back
When he said ""Why?,"" I said ""We gotta go
'Cause I left my wallet in El Segundo""
[Chorus: Q-Tip]
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I got to get it, I got, got to get it
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
Come on, let's go

Come on, let's go

Roger That
Ra-Ra-Roger That
My team about green, Rondo roger that
I take the la to the head like a Dodger hat
I do it big baby, where they do it larger at
These niggas dead, where the hell they charger at
These bitches washed up, straight out of the laundromat
I'm so far ahead of my rivals
When I show up it kills em, dead on arrival
They said New York was dead but I led the revival
I guess I'm just built to last, bred for survival
Unstoppable, unbreakable
I keep one nine like breaker-breaker do
Shorty say what it do is what I make 'er do
Get her on the first shot, yea one take, boo
Now she need the black mamba badder then the Lakers do
I d-d-t the pussy, I'm Jake the Snake to you
I put em in the coffin, I'm the Undertaker too
She met the God now her man gonna meet his maker too
What's beef? That questions mistakeable
I mean I done had a well-done stake or two
But as far as rap niggas go, we slaughter cows
Apron on, tape a song, flow slaughter house
You niggas porterhouse, filet, t-bone
I'm Macaulay Culkin homes, leave me alone
I'm in the zone, who want some of this college D
You sorry ass niggas owe me an apology
I'm about a dolla-G, master in grindology
Groupie-ass niggas must have took Astrology
Cause all they do is follow stars
Pride won't di-gest we don't swallow ours
Swagger out this world, I get my style from Mars
You add that with the fact that Loso spittin asylum bars
You understand why competition is extinct
Them boys is gone, word to N'Sync
I'm the black Timberlake in black Timbalands
They all dead you could send back the ambulance

Fake chains all over the ground everywhere

It's West Philly Freck stunting on the breaker, break
I put them oils in the hood like Quaker State
OG Kush yes I do the wake and bake
I got them circles and them squares bitch take a shape
So holla at me if you niggas tryna find a key
I get that ass tuned up like Meineke
Mr. Bar for Bar rappers need to buy a line
I get you VIP passes to the flyathon
I be running through shutting down mad spots
Out in Short Hills Mall I'm the mascot
In Alaska, you couldn't find a colder nigga
I still push it in the hood like a stroller nigga
I still crack the block up like Meet the Browns
And if your money right I might let you meet the pounds
I pop rose like the shit is Miller Draft
I'm so cool that them young bitches feel a draft
Street Fam, bo y, yes we the casket flowas
West Philly Freck, I will get your casket lowered
I dare tomorrow, breaker breaker 1 9er
It's the mutha fucking king of all the one liners
A hundred thousand for the watch, yall chipped in
And I ain't ask them for a bargain I just chipped in
Down in Bar Harbor when I hit a shop or two
I got that amex that look like Shaka Zulu
On some real shit motherfucker credit score
Cause when you got the cake, what you need the credit for
I'm usually in the cut like nip/tuck
Or that tangerine coop getting lip-sucked
That's just how we go down when the woman kick it
They know I'm gettin money like the winning ticket
West Philly Freck, I be on that road strapped
When it' comes to being fly I'm the road map

Oh my God this beyond what you could have imagined
This is, this is this is worse then the Black Plague
I never seen anything of this kind of devastation
Um it's of catastrophic proportions

Dead bodys everywhere
Eww it reeks of dead rapper down here
I'm gonna need to get outta here

You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn’t around

But look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
Just look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
See that I’m everywhere, everywhere
Shining down on you

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Well, well, is that our little author?
Coming back, humming his hymns, a little altered
Your attention, put back on the flow like the department of water
Taking off with the dough, like Little Walter
Chess, yes, baby, I’m Jerry Lawler
Rebel with a cause, outlaw with the lawyer
Judge, jury, like a loop
Rap name Lupe, but my daddy named me warrior
This is his memorial, shoot

You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn’t around
That I left you alone

See that I’m everywhere, everywhere
Shining down on you

No, I ain’t that nigga trying to get a liquor line
When I be scripting lines, want this petition signed
It says I’m sick of dyin', sick of this prison time
I really love my people, I’m sick of pimping mine
Now if we Auto-Tune that shit
We can hear the songs from that opera groomed fat bitch
Telling us not to pursue it, just to shoe it like a blacksmith
We’re trapped, and moving round in circles like it’s Chapstick
And that’s the same encircled way of thinking that we chat with
We’ll wrap this around your head
Like the bandanas Fabolous used to wrap his hats with
Rather be in FEDS instead of National Geographics
Well, I’m not having it, nawwww

You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn’t around
That I left you alone
But look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)

See that I’m everywhere, everywhere
Shining down on you

So, I say hello and this is for the third time
To everybody out there who ain’t never heard mine
And if you have, then you know you ain’t never heard lying
Lu don’t moo, no, cow-ards, you only heard lines
Not a facade cherisher, I’d rather have the scars
I don’t idolize America, I’m dancing with the stars
Uh-huh, all of them? Yeah, they are, too
You look up and you see us shining down on you

You thought I was down
You thought I was gone

Uh! I bring you murder in the first
And even as we speak we getting further in this verse
With no further ado I do what I respect
Doom got me stripes like Hamburgler for my work
As Lupe the killa, killa, killa, killa
Mercy, he's a mess, so immersed in his murk
He's 2/3 submerged below the surface where they surf
This is where I lay it down like a bird giving birth
So call me ""Lu the Giant's Goose"" or just ""Faberge paint""
Til I'm called back to the shore by the watchers of the bay
I wait, til I come back like a tsunami
Never microwave like the watchers of the weight
I'm wrapped in aluminum foil, I do my dirt like Kwame
Until that same soil being pushed into my grave
But I'm so ahead of my time, the next day
Might strike oil where I been layed, homie I'm so crude
Texas tea, haters is so screwed
But I can't fill it like a flathead in a Philips
Don't get it twisted, nigga, I'm no tool
More cool than a pool in a blizzard
With ice cubes in it during Christmas
Meanin' there's no schoolin' the misfit
Like I'm throwin' a fit
Or I just can't fit it, tidbit too big
It's gotta hem it til it's fresh to death
Dressed to kill it, like uh!
[Verse 2]
Uh, 187 on my second, I reckon
This is an assault with a deadly session
A soft peace and blessings to the sentence that be reppin
All across in every direction, locality, and section
That know Lupe the killa, killa, killa, killa
Give it how I live it most niggas won't believe
Or achieve how I did it most niggas won't receive
'Til I leave and I bereave the secrets of my sickness
How I, flooded the streets like Venice
I've suffered, demanded, withstanded, pimp handed and hustlin'
I'm Colonel Mustard with the speech
They ain't catchin' me, no suspicions of stickin'
No convictions on my rap sheet
I'm so committing lay my murder game,that's sweet
Speakeasy like Prohibition, no admission
If you ain't knocking like me to the underground bar, burying a toast
Dodging the raid like roach, nigga please

[Verse 3]
Uh, I make it give up the ghost
On the trifecta, the third, I differ
Nigga, you ain't heard, my lecture like Lecter
Letchya in on a secret, but you can't leak it
Lupe's the killa, killa, killa, killa
Since my entrance, my niggas had packs
They moved em to a trap like Winston
Far from bustas, baby nah
All my homies henchmen
I was the rhymer, my talk went through the walls like Slimer
Or like, eating vagina
Or, a stray bullet, whichever ways I put it
Crooks was hooked like crooks through neighborhoods I pushed it
Little Caesar niggas pizzas was like ""book it""
Delivery mean like Leroy Green
They couldn't take it to the places I took it
Beware, you don't look it

I'm gonna memorize all of his lines

I spell ""word"" with a three, name's MC
Other rappers flow weak like window unit A/Cs
Latinas on my penis, Japanese on they knees
I love all the ladies as long as they 18
I got bling up the ying, a plethora of Porsches
I'll say anything cause my mouth is remorseless
Even the Source says my hip hop's a vortex
Leave horse heads on door steps, my mic checks cost Corvettes
The strobe light explodes white as I step on the floor
The bar keep knows the code so he throws me a Stroh's
Weak MCs decompose, cause they know I can flow
Like Wessel comma Zam through Coruscant corridors
Humidor filled with Stoges, filled with 'dro
Like 90210 it's filled with the word ""bro""
Fuck the lexicon of octagons, I'm all about go
These amateurs got catheters I'm all about prose by pros

I'm lit like a Branch Davidian
I'm what's left of the lithium in Cobain's cranium
I fill Wembley Stadium
I'm once-bitten, twice-shy call it pyromania
When I roll up in Kashyyyk, I roll three Jedis deep
The fleet of peeps that I creep all got vests underneath
There's no need to beleive in the heat that I keep
The squares that I (bleep), or the heiresses I freak
It's embarrassing to me, I'm like kerosene it seems
Or D-R-E-W-B with incendiary schemes
Blowing up making cream, I am just like Howard Dean
When I scream I get red, I get mean
Can't believe you be buyin' what I be shuckin' and jivin'
Fuck it if I am the next big thing with promotional tie-ins
I am just a cartoon-making rapper, you think that I'm lying
Everyone bust a move like it is a rave in Zion
My self-aggrandizing and deprecation keeps 'em guessing
Call me Venus Flytrap cause my DJ's Howard Hessman
Word 'em up yo, word 'em up yo

I go hard for that paper, homie, I just gotta get it
Got a money scheme, you plot it, you can count me in I'm with it
You cross me, you gon' make a cemetery visit
That's gangsta, you know me I talk 'cause I live it
Shell cases drop, when that chopper chop, way up the block
Get hit with copper tops, when the drama pop, the llama pop
And it won't stop, you can run call the cops
This ain't new, niggas know how I be on it
That shit you got, put my pistol to you, I want it
It's not a game, perfect aim
You feel the flame up against your brain
Man it's so hot, I'll make you wish it rained

[Chorus: 50 Cent (Eminem)]
I got a GatMan, if there's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around with a big-ass revolver

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Who came through with two Glocks to terrorize your borough? (Huh?)
Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl? (I did)
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes, and still screamed ""Fuck the world""
(I'm Slim Shady) So come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me 25 times in the same spot (Ow)
I think I got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot 'til they brains rot
Stop they blood flow 'til they veins clot
I need a pain shot and a shot of plain Scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
You gotta make 'em fear you 'fore you make 'em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'ma come and kill you

[Chorus]
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady
[Verse 2: Eminem]
I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful (Uh-huh)
I like birds, bees, I like people
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool
The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out just to see what it feels like
'Cause this is how I am in real life (Mhm)
I don't want to just die a normal death
I wanna be killed twice (Uh-huh)
I just wanna scare somebody with a gun threat
When they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet
So bring the money by tonight
'Cause your wife said this the biggest knife
She ever saw in her life (Help me, help me)
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school
(Stay in school)
Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a fuck-you letter

[Chorus]
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yo, I'll listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it
(Ahh, that shit is wack)
Six months later, you'll hear your lyrics on my shit
(That's my shit)
People don't buy shit no more, they just dub it
That's why I'm still broke and had the number-one club hit
(Yup, uh-huh)
But they love it when you make your business public
So fuck it, I've got herpes while we on the subject (Uh-huh)
And if I told you I had AIDS, y'all would play it
'Cause you stupid mothafuckas think I'm playin' when I say it
Well, I do take pills, don't do speed
Don't do crack, don't do coke, I do smoke weed (Uh-huh)
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms, do drink beer (Yup)
I just wanna make a few things clear
My baby mama's not dead, she's still alive and bitching
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin'
It's not syphilis, and as for being AIDS-infested
I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested

[Chorus]
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin

I told you I was Shady (Yup)

Thank you
Feels good waking up! Get back...
On my J-O...
*yaaaawn*
I'll be going...
Plus, I gotta go to work
It's cool!

[Verse 1]
I wipe the cool from my eye
Stationed in Antarctica; coldest nigga alive
Flow is Armageddon, might smite crows from the sky
Before you drive you have to wipe locusts off your rides
But I'm warming up, oceans is on the rise
I be Ocean with 11 associates on my side
Colder than Chris Martin guitaring
Would you look at all these spies
But they can’t see me, I took out their eyes
Replace with some he’s, so all they see is eh’s
But I will never run, not even if they cry
See I can never fall, not even down their cheek
But I will always bawl, let’s see who the first to blink
And I don't need no passwords cause I don't need to cheat
But you can say your last words, and you can rest in peace
I’m the hook after your last verse I’m also like the beat
But I will turn it down so you can go to sleep
[Chorus]
So you can go to sleep, yes you can go to sleep
Said you can go to sleep, said you can go to sleep
Good night, good night, good night, good night
Real niggas up again, phony niggas tucking in
Now you can go to sleep, yes you can got to sleep
Now you can got to sleep, now you can go to sleep
Good night, good night, good night, good night
Official niggas on they job and you know we gonna ball
Real niggas popping off, phony nigga nodding off

[Verse 2]
Insomniac since way back, see this is what I been like
Baking eggs and pancakes, eating that at midnight
Getting up and going hard, I don’t need no Enzyte
Come across as very calm: mental state is Zen-like
Always had a lot of heart, never been the tin type
Never will I drop a dime, never been the 10 type
My girlfriend is very fine, yes she is a ten right
Mink is draggin’ on the flo', fire in my windpipe
You should come and clean up after the riots that I incite
Things get off the handle, left behind a landfill
Traffic at a standstill, stadium is fan-filled
Fill this bitch up with fans you still won’t blow my candle out
My ""can do"" spirit's in the house
And is possessing your possessions, did you hear it by the couch?
Boogieman under your bed, not in your closet
Cause I'm not a homo, won't drill no door hole
I won’t make a peep, so you can go to sleep
[Chorus]
So you can go to sleep, yes you can go to sleep
Said you can go to sleep, said you can go to sleep
Good night, good night, good night, good night
Real niggas up again, phony niggas tucking in
Now you can go to sleep, yes you can got to sleep
Now you can got to sleep, now you can go to sleep
Good night, good night, good night, good night
Official niggas on they job and you know we gonna ball
Real niggas popping off, phony nigga nodding off

[Verse 3]
I wipe the cold from my eye
Then put it in my stove and hope that my dough rise
And then my clothes dry, but I am so high
I am sitting on the storm that I got soaked by
Now you can come closer, you can get warm but you get no pie
But you can sell it for em so here’s you bow tie
Now get ready to fall cause humans don’t fly
The boy in the balloon - see? I didn’t go hide
And I'm coming back to float again
Close down all the opium but I had to O-P-EN
They said they need a hero in it so I'm back to dope again
Pull up in that old-school Flintstone drop on rolling pins
Time is all behind me, this make me feel old again
Grandma's all around me, I can feel her soul within
Hope my daddy over him; woke the roosters, woke the hens
Everything's cashmere, count the sheep that you…
[Chorus]
So you can go to sleep, yes you can go to sleep
Said you can go to sleep, said you can go to sleep
Good night, good night, good night, good night
Real niggas up again, phony niggas tucking in
Now you can go to sleep, yes you can got to sleep
Now you can got to sleep, now you can go to sleep

Hello nowhere, hello oblivion
Hello goodbye...

Hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion
Hello goodbye
Hello darkness
You, you, you, you, you, you

All in together, the weather is better than ever
I hope it never ends, I hope it lasts forever
But when it does, we can all pretend that it's
Better than it's ever been
Lie to ourselves
Like the skies, we'll rebel
And it's well, and it's fine
And it's fine if they fell
And you can refine the storyline if you survive to retell
We all targets

Hello darkness, hello sunshine
Hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion

Said everything's gonna be o-o-okay, just don't breathe the air

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
He just sits, and waits for them to kick in the door
He once was a hero, they don't love him no more
There's a blast, every time a ten hit's the floor
His gift, for not fighting another man's war
And if they can get their hands on the mask
That he had wore on his face
They can put somebody else in his place, to restore
The state, the illusion that it's safe
The faith, that being a slave is so great
As gas fills the room
And rockets destroy everything around him
He stands to find himself surrounded
By thousands of soldiers that he once trained
To never miss their targets, heartless

Hello darkness, hello sunshine
Hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion
Hello goodbye...
Hello darkness

Pleased to make your acquaintance, salutations

Hello nowhere, hello oblivion

Philly, Atlanta, Virginia
They said it was coming back around man
Back to the lyrics man
Come back to people like me, I say...

[Verse 1]
It's mean, soldiers
Now let me put the streets down like steamrollers
With the CATS that push
40 oz. through the hood like King Cobras
See we sling soda
Cause the extra four in the split is mixed
It's really thirty-six
Used to buy toasters and clips
You can tighten your circle or boa constrict
While you was lighting your purple, I was over the scripts
See, I could walk the walk, couldn't really talk the talk
Had to get my talk to properly explain my walk
Cause this lack in talk had my walk looking off
Now I'm over the limp
Watch how they mugs drop when they see my Verbal's able
That's the Usual
When I was po' I was low
Now me and my Chaps cop Purple Label
It's Ralph Lauren on the rap laureate
Niggas brown nose, they are like Alf to him
Runners at Interscope are not as Stoute as him
Please don't Interscope
It's gonna be a whole lot of Iovine and respirating
If I lean out this window with Irene
Niggas as tall as Yao Ming
With L-U-P-Emperor
Is the foundation's, I-beams and the antennas
It's so serious every time I write my John Hancock like
Could damn near see Detroit, I see you
Niggas is scared of heights
This is Saran Wrap and aluminum foil
Some potpourri, a little machine oil
I stack my paper and throw off my scents
This is top floor, better look out below
Pennies from heaven is the same as a semi from the second
And I reign supreme
Turn your umbrellas upside down
Did you even catch the change in theme
This is gangsta man

Lupe to the F-to-the-I
To-the-A-to-the-S-to-the-C-to-the-O

And them niggas ain't Was nor from his regime
Gangsta lean
Hats on tilt like these Snickers ain't drop out the vending machine
You gotta put more money in
And I shake niggas up every time I drop a bar
(2 for 1)
It's horse in the Porsche and bricks in the box
Like mo' money them every time I cop a car
You see I'm a roller, right
So it might be a Rover, right
But every time I drop an 'r'
Get off the streets
It's ""over,"" 'ight
Bet I be in the head like overnight
Like rollers, right
She the chauffeur, right
So I keep her sober
She don't get Fed Ex like overnight
I am Dolemite
All that gas can't help you but solar might
Just call on sun
Drop a 's'
Pick up an 'o'
Uno, put it all on ""one""
Brace yourself like overbite
""For that quiet nigga that relocated down south
Coming back to floss""
Nigga get your molars right
Fix your grill
No plaque but a whole lot of cheese
This the drill
Mr. Chill gave me the green light like Yoda knife
So I'mma force my will
Like the Force I wield
Of course you will
Take my time
But weight behind only pertains
To that Porsche grill
It's snakes in the hood
Gotta watch for that Cobra bite
Let me see
There's snakes in the hood
A bird, a horse behind the grill
Something gator on the seat
And a fox behind the wheel
No it's not Noah's Ark, Ahk

(Are you ready?)
(Fuck that, Ice Cube coming back at you with another motherfucking bomb)

[Verse 1]
I was told, 'cause I didn't witness the whole act
In and out was the movement of the bozack
It was hot and sweaty and lots of pushin'
Then the nut came gushin'
And it was hell trying to bail to the ovary
With nothing but the Lord lookin over me
I was white with a tail
But when I reached the finish line, young black male!
One cell made two, and two cells made fo'
And so on, so now I'm a embryo
Then I got a hunch
That I'mma be on lockdown, for nine months
Chillin', with my mother to guide me
And nuttin' but a stomach to hide me
From all that worry and bullshit
Nine months later, I elbow pull and kick
'Cause my time is up and I don't care
With one big push, I'm outta there
June 15th, it's just my luck
In 1969, a nigga is the product
(Ghetto-ass nigga, you ain't shit
And you ain't gon' never be shit!)

[Verse 2]
I learned how to walk and talk and all that
They put me in school, but it don't matter
'Cause I'm sitting in history
Learning bout a sucker, who didn't give a fuck about me
They try to shape us
But I know Uncle Sam is a motherfucking rapist
So I stopped paying attention
Ice Cube, headed, straight to detention
Fuck that shit, I roam the hallways
I'm sent home and I don't got all A's
A high school dropout
My father had beef so I tried to knock pops out
But I got tossed, he's the boss
I'm out of there and mad 'cause I lost
Now being on my own is a factor
So I become, the neighborhood jacker
Gimme your car, run your jewels
Making a living robbing fools
And if I let my nine rang out
You know, it'll make your brains hang out
So what's your fate?
Am I the nigga you love, or the one you love to hate?
The wrong answer is said, the nigga fled
I pump lead, now he's in a puddle of red
And if you got a buck, you're shit out of luck
Stuck up by the motherfucking product
(Uh-uh motherfucker you gots to get a job
If you wanna stay in my motherfucking house)

(Many young men reject the traditional values
That are important to their parents
Church, school and family
Have been replaced by street, turf, and gang)

Twenty-one now, and paid in full
Feeling bad, from all the shit I pulled
On people back in the day
Plus, I got a little baby on the way
So I'm trying to go straight
I'm with my baby's momma, out on a date
Til the punk ass cops ran my plate
Now I'm on a bus upstate
""Oh, the young nigga done caught a case!""
(Eating in the mess hall, saying my grace)
Sent to a concrete ho-house
Where all the products go, no doubt
Yo momma, I gotta do eleven
Living in a five-by-seven
Dear baby, your man's getting worn out
Of seeing young boys getting they assholes torn out
And then he got shanked with a spoon
And he was supposed to get out soon
Is it my fault, he was caught in production
Where a young black life means nothin'
Just because, I didn't want to learn your grammar
You say I'm better off in the slammer
And it's driving me batty
'Cause my little boy, is missing daddy
I'm ashamed, but the fact is
I wish pops let me off on the mattress
Or should I just hang from the top bunk
But that's going out like a punk
My life is fucked
But it ain't my fault, 'cause I'm the motherfucking product

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
I ain't the one, the one to get played like a pooh butt
See I'm from the street, so I know what's up
On these silly games that's played by the women
I'm only happy when I'm goin up in 'em
But you know, I'm a menace to society
But girls in biker shorts are so fly to me
So I step to 'em, with aggression
Listen to the kid, and learn a lesson today
See, they think we narrow minded
'Cause they got a cute face, and big-behinded
So I walk over and say ""How ya doin'?""
See, I'm only down for screwin', but you know
Ya gotta play it off cool
'Cause if they catch you slipping, you'll get schooled
And they'll get you for your money, son
Next thing you know you're getting their hair and they nails done
Fool, and they'll let you show 'em off
But when it comes to sex, they got a bad cough
Or a headache, it's all give and no take
Run out of money, and watch your heart break
They'll drop you like a bad habit
'Cause a brother with money yo, they gotta have it
Messing with me though, they gets none
You can't juice Ice Cube, girl, 'cause I ain't the one
[Interlude #1: Woman #2 and Woman #1]
Girrrrrl, you got to get these brothers for all the money you can honey. 'Cause if they ain't got no money, they can't do nothin' for me but get out of my face
I know what you mean, girl; it ain't nothin' right jumpin' off unless he got dollars!

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Sometimes I used to wonder
How the hell an ugly dude get a fine girl's number
He's getting juiced for his ducats
I tell a girl in a minute yo, I drive a bucket
And won't think nuttin' of it
She can ride or walk, either leave it or love it
I show her that I'm not the O, the N-E, say
I'm a ruthless N-I double-G A
'Cause I'm gamin' on a female that's gamin' on me
You know I spell girl with a B
A brother like me is only out for one thing
I think with my ding-a-ling, but I won't bring no
Flowers to your doorstep, when we goin' out
'Cause you'll take it for granted, no doubt
And after the date, I'mma want to do the wild thing
You want lobster? Huh! I'm thinking Burger King
And when I take you, you get frustrated
You can't juice Ice Cube and you hate it
But you see, I don't go nuts
Over girls like you with the BIG ol butts
It start comin' out the pocket, to knock it
But when the damage is done
You can only lay me girl, you can't play me girl
For the simple fact that, I ain't the one
[Interlude #2: Woman #2 and Woman #1]
I don't care how they look; if they got money, we can hook up but they ain't gettin' none
Yeah, I just make em think they gonna get some, play with they mind a lil bit, and get that money. Oh Ice Cube, can I have some money pleeeease?

[Verse 3]
Give you money? Why bother?
'Cause you know I'm looking nothing like your father
Girl, I can't be played or ganked
Ganked means getting took for your bank
Or your gold or your money or something
Nine times outta ten, she's giving up nothing
They get mad when I put it in perspective
But let's see if my knowledge is effective
To the brothas man they robbing you blind
'Cause they fine with a big behind, but pay it no mind
Keep your money to yourself, homie
And if you got enough game
You'll get her name and her number
Without going under
You can't leave 'em and love and stay above 'em
I used to get no play; now she stay behind me
'Cause I said I had a Benz 190
But I lied and played the one
Just to get some; now she feels dumb
To my homies it's funny
But that's what you get trying to play me for my money
Now don't you feel used?
But I don't give a hoot, huh, because I knock boots
You shouldn't be, so damn material
And try to milk Ice Cube like cereal
Now how many times do I have to say it?
'Cause if I have to go get a gun
You girls will learn I don't burn
You think I'm a sucka, but I ain't the one
[Outro: Woman #1 and Ice Cube]
But you said you love me!
I don't see no rings on this finger
Why you doin' me like this? I love you!
Yeah, you love my money; I got what I wanted -- beat it!"

Yo, uh, man I need something man, I need a twenty, man
Whatchu got, man?

Man, this shit look like a gold on the roll shit (What the fuck is that?)
(It's a fuckin dud!)
It's real man
This shit ain't real
(That nigga sellin' that shit again, man?!)
Get the fuck outta here and come back with some money
C'mon man, be cool man
Y'all Mexicans always comin' with this shit
Yo Dre, kick in the bass!

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
It was once said by a man who couldn't quit
""Dopeman, please can I have another hit?""
The dope man said, ""Clucka, I don't give a shit
If your girl kneel down and sucked my dick""
It all happened and the guy tried to choke her
Nigga didn't care, she ain't nothing but a smoker
That's the way it goes, that's the name of the game
Young brother getting over by slanging 'caine
Gold around his neck in 14 k heaven
Bitches jocking on his dick 24-7
Plus he's making money keeping the base heads waiting
Rollin' six four with the fresh ass daytons
Living in Compton, California CA
His uzi up yo ass if he don't get paid
Nigga begging for credit, he's knocking out teeth
Clocking much dollars on the 1st and 15th
Big wad of money, nothing less than a twenty
Yo, you want a five-oh? The dope man's got plenty
To be a dope man, boy, you must qualify
Don't get high off your own supply
From a key to a g it's all about money
10 piece for 10 base, pipe comes free
And people out there are not hip to the fact
If you see somebody getting money for crack, he's the

Well, suck this bitch!

[Interlude: Dr. Dre]
Wait a minute -- who the fuck are you talking to?
Do you know who the fuck I am?
Man, I can't believe this shit -- this bitch is trying to gank me
I'll slap you up side your head with nine inches of limp dick!

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
You need a nigga with money so you get a dopeman
Juice that fool for as much as you can
She likes his car and he gets with her
Got a black eye cause the dopeman hit her
Let that slide and you pay it no mind
Find that he's slapping you all the time
But that's okay, cause he's so rich
And you ain't nothing but a dopeman's bitch!
Do what he say and you keep your mouth shut
Popping that trash might get you fucked up
You'll sit and cry if the dope man strikes you
He don't give a fuck - he got two just like you
There's a another girl in the dopeman's life
Not quite a bitch but far from a wife
Sh'es called the strawberry and everybody know
Strawberry, strawberry is the neighborhood ho
Do anything for a hit or two
Give tha bitch a rock, she'll fuck the whole damn crew
It might be your wife and it might make you sick
Come home and see her mouth on the dopeman's dick
Strawberry just look and you'll see her
But don't fuck around or she'll give you gonorrhea
And people out there are not hip to the fact

If you smoke 'caine, you're a stupid motherfucker
Known around the hood as the schoolyard clucker
Doing that crack with all the money you got
On your hands and knees searching for a piece of rock
Jonesing for a hit and you're looking for more
Done stole a Alpine of out Eazy's 6-4
You need your ass whooped cause it's out of this earth
Can't get a 10 piece need a dolla fifty's worth
Knucklehead nigga, yeah, you turned into a crook
But swear up and down, boy, that you ain't hooked
You beat your friend up and you whooped his ass long
Cause he hit the pipe till the rock was all gone
You're robbing and stealing, bugging and illing
While the dope man's dealing
What is killing your pain, cocaine, this shit's insane
Yo, E, she's a berry, let's run a train

Man, I wouldn't touch that bitch

Me neither; Ho, go home and wash out your beaver
And niggas out there messing up people's health
Yo, what the fuck yo gotta say for yourself?

Well, I'm the dopeman - yeah, boy, wear corduroy
Money up to here but unemployed
You keep smoking that rock and my pocket's getting bigger

There's a void that needs to be filled inside of this marketplace

My mom want me to blow up and house them
My father want me to bring product out without Slim
And prove them wrong, to pay my bills
I'm right on your heels, I'm for real, my shoes is long
To feed my son - I will leave you leakin' in the street
I will heat you to kingdom come, ugh
The king will come
Wait 'til you gone in place of an angel appear to take you home
The beard on the face is gone
These bullets is straight razors, blazin' you, case in point
Amaze the rap game, make 'em point
Walk inside of the house of the illest and case the joint

Just picture yourself lookin' in the mirror tryna change what is not there
When niggas stop speakin'
Them phone calls get slow, I'm feelin' like Nas before he dropped ""Ether""
I appear to be sober
I'mma really be runnin' over whoever said that my career was over
Whoever gave me the cold shoulder
And turn they backs on me, I'll be blazin' you from both coasts

Just because I ain't hangin' out at the same places I once vibed in
Everybody at my father's job askin' him rumors, shit
Stop 'cause my dad soon gon' quit
If I can, maybe thank him for raising me
To think like a baby gangsta, crazy temper
I paid my sentence - totalled out the prison
The game sent me, fame owes my name plus interest
But once you strapped in to the penmanship
And the track rumbles, you trapped in this rap jungle
When you can't come through, sales or numbers

Modern Mans Hustle,Atmosphere,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative']","[Verse 1]
The first time I met the devil was at a Motel 6
She left hell to spend a weekend on Earth just for kicks
Sexy little bitch, shorter than expected
About 5 foot 5, big and thick in the breast and thighs
Beautiful, dark eyes, a strong stare
Large lips, soft hands, and long hair
I said I'll make you smile for the simple fact I'm good at it
I'll make you smile just so I can sit and look at it

[Chorus]
I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you through simple and the struggle
But girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle
I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you through simple and the struggle
But girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle

[Verse 2]
Who cares what Jane says? She always spits the same spit
I'd rather kill the radio and listen to the rain hit
Little sister needs seclusion, some how she'll discover it through the pop music
Got used to the feeling of falling, but she'll never see her following
Bouncing back and forth between the healing and the hollering
Riding the outer ring of your own private saturn
Thoughts scattered all across the grey matter
Little baby doll she doesn't know what to say to ya'll
The patience is short and of course the pride is way too tall
Break it all smash the past like it was made of glass
Ain't no other way to make it last
It hurts to watch Lucy lucid dream
I've had the pleasure of seeing our hero kick and scream
And when she calms down I'll turn the sound down
And put my arms around the little lost and found and I'll tell her that

I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you through simple and the struggle
But girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle
I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you through simple and the struggle
But girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle

Hush little lady don't say a word
Or the rest of the village gonna know you're disturbed
And if you let them know that you're vulnerable
Then there ain't no stopping how far they open you slow (yo yo yo)
I'm a chapter in your textbook read me like a checkbook
Mistook love at first sight for a sex look
Enough of the blind man's bluff
I want the good stuff
Trying to hook up a full belly and a foot rub
The modern man's hustle I dig it, I shuffle
Feed me your troubles and need me to cuddle (come on)
Bundle up in my mitten and coat
As cold as it gets I keep your winter afloat
So let the snow fall (it's coming down)
She doesn't want to understand why I still come around
She looks at the mirror, she don't see what I see
She holds no history of how precious she be
Lay your head on my chest, speak of the stress
Kick your feet up and rest, before we clean up the nest
I hate to see you upset, it cramps the position
And if you didn't know, you better listen (you better listen 'cause)

I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you through simple and the struggle

Run a mile for the cause, I'm righteous, above the law

Why dick-eating niggas always rap with a mouth full?
But you know they don't play with me
The realest nigga alive -- what can these niggas say to me? Nothing

[Hook - Kanye West]
La la la la, wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la, then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, is you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing
[Verse 2 - Freeway]
I had a dream that Jay and Dame was back together
And in that second, everything was back the same
In reality, your boy went to Mecca, came back
And said that I would never rap again
But I'm back and that's the way the ball bounce
A verse is a ounce, a album's a brick -- now it's time for traffic game
Y'all lame, I am the product
Hotter than lava, they wonder how this Roc-a-fella package came
First you take a brick of Jay, a brick of 'Ye
Couple quarters of Freeway, an ounce of Beans
Then you kill 'em with the flow
We the realest; even Dontrelle Willis couldn't out the team
We speak the truth and they believe us
Tell FEMA even Hurricane Katrina couldn't out the flames
Roc-a-fella here to stay, we airing out y'all lames
Free At Last on the way, so clear 'em out my lane

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Kanye West]
Yeah homie, this the theme song
First I get my money right, then I get my team on
If I always prayed to have gleam on
Three hundred dollar jeans on, do that mean I dream wrong?
And I was high as a Lear jet
Fly as the insect even though we in debt
And it don't matter if I get her number cause
When I get my money right, she gon' come running
And I be good like God with a extra ""o""
God knows that my check needs some extra O's
And you know that you need to bring some extra
Not in jogging pants, either -- tell 'em wear some sexy clothes
Now my game so professional and my chain so fresh, they go
But after the fame, did you gain anything?
Damn, 'Ye, would you change anything?
Well, [Young Jeezy: If I had a billion dollars]
I'd cop more pink Polos and pop those collars
Misery love company, her nickname ""Sorrow""
My Benz need company, her nickname Tahoe
""Wait 'til I get my money"" everybody motto
So I'mma need a bravo for everything that I wrote
Yeah -- hey mama, they can't hate 'em
Cause after all of the drama, K slayed 'em
[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Uncle Murda]
Listen -- I ain't worried 'bout shit
It's a Roc-a-fella/GMG invasion, bitch
You hear them niggas talking 'bout me? Ain't that some shit
These niggas is like bitches -- they all on my dick
They don't want no real G to get in position
I opened up the door so all my real niggas could get in
Roc-a-fella, Def Jam, GMG it's on
Uncle Murda coming for the motherfucking throne
Listen, you could call me the king of New York
You can't front, I'm doing my thing
If it wasn't for the chronic and these bad-ass ho's
I'd be shooting motherfuckers everywhere I go, oh
But the head I be getting got me chilling
Got a nigga like, let me focus on these millions, man
It got me not thinking 'bout these lames
They don't really want no beef, they ain't life-threatening
I'm puffing purple haze with that sour diesel
Can't forget that kush -- I'm high as a eagle
And just cause I'm high off that marijuana
Don't mean I don't see them niggas creeping around the corner
They goners"
Adventures of Super Rhyme Rap,Jimmy Spicer,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","Rhymes faster than a speeding bullet
Has more rhymes than a train has tracks
Able to leap sucker MCs in a single rhyme
Look at the jam on the mic
“It's a bird! It's a plane!”
No—I'm Su-Su-Super Rhymes

It’s the new thing, makes you want to swing
While us MCs rap, doing our thing
It’s not singing, like it used to be
No, it’s rapping to the rhythm of the sure shot beat
It goes one for the money, two for the show
You got my beat, now here I go
You see, this DJ, he gets down
Mixing records while they go round
With the hid-dip, the hop, you just don’t stop
You rock to the beat ‘til it makes you drop

Yes, I’m one of a kind, I’m Super Rhymes
And I’d like to say hello
And since I’m on the mic and I’m ready to rock
This is how it goes
Yes, I rock so good, I rock so well
I ring-ding-dang-a-ding-ding-a-dang, baby
I'll ring your bell
Yes, I’m Super Rhymes, I’m twenty-two
I want to be a hundred before I’m through
Because no, I didn’t come from the planet Earth
Planet Rhyme-on is my place of birth
From the day I came out my mother’s womb
I found myself in the operating room
Then the doctor spanked me on my behind
I didn’t cry, the kid started to rhyme
My mother said, “Son, that’s the way it should be
Your name is Super Rhymes, you’ll be an MC”
So then my father put me on a meteorite
Sent me to Earth to rock the mic
I got to Earth and started laying it down
At the jam on the mic, I could be found
While I was at the jam this one time
Rocking to the beat, said I’m feeling fine
Just-a freaking out on the freak’s behind
I looked in the face of Frankenstein
I said, “Oh, no, she’s not mine”
Because my woman is fine as wine
And she goes by the name of Lois Line
But she didn’t come here with me this time
I’m feeling real sad, but not that bad
I’m-a have to run away from this crow-dad
I ran to the deejay to rock the mic
He said, “Super Rhymes, take it, do what you like”
So I rocked the party viciously
This guy I didn’t know walked up to me
But the closer he got, the more I could tell
It was the man they call Coward Hosell
The guy you’d see on KBC
While Joe Frazier boxed Muhammad Ali
He said, “Excuse me, sir, are you Super Rhymes?
The one with the fine woman Lois Line?”
I said, “I am—will I be on TV
Like the float-like-a-butterfly, stinging Ali?”
He said, “Yes, my man, if you show me you can
I was told you had the master plan”
So I rocked the mic for Howard Cosell
To show America how I rocked so well
And while I rocked the mic, this is what I said
About Dracula, the living dead
He didn't like blood, not this vampire
The disco beat was his desire
Transylvania’s where he made home
Until one day he decided to roam
And then out of the crypt he did crawl
Count Dracula is what he’s called
He said, “The sun's gone down, and now it’s night
I'm going to spread my wings and take a serious flight
I turned into a bat, I flew away
I said at the disco is where I got to stay
Because back home, there was nothing like this
In Transylvania this is what I’d miss
They just bite necks and suck blood all day
When I knew there had to be a better way
I packed my coffin, said, ‘Vampires, I am leaving’
So I turned into a bat and cut out that evening
The first disco I hit was 54
They didn't even want to let me in the door
I said, ‘Listen, my man, I am a real cool guy
I can turn into a bat, I can even fly’
He said, ‘Dracula, you can do all of that
Then come on in and catch a need-a freak attack’
So I went inside and I started to dance
And had all the ladies waiting for their chance
They said, ‘Isn’t he cool with his widow’s peak
And the strange way he does the Freak?’”
He said, “Where I come from it’s not called the Freak
Its the Transylvania Boogie, seven days a week”
I didn’t get to dance with them all that night
'Cause at the break of dawn I saw sunlight
I said, “I’m sorry to say I cannot stay
'Cause us vampires must be in before it turns day
But don’t forget, I'll be back
I like it when I catch a need-a freak attack
And since you heard my story, it’s time I be leaving
In Transylvania we say ‘good evening’”
Mr. Hosell said, “Damn, that’s good
You’ll be on TV in every neighborhood”
He said, “Super Rhymes, you’re a real MC
We must put you on KBC”
I said, I’ll dress to impress, won’t claim I’m best
I’ll come a little better than all the rest
Because I never come with any less
Than all the rhymes that will pass the test
Because I’m cool as ice, I’m twice as nice
I never had an off-day in my life
You see, I take all your money, bust out your wife
Make you dance to my beat all your life
'Cause when I get in my stuff and I start to rhyme
The sucker MCs hide every time
Because my voice is baritone
And I really don’t need no microphone
But I use one anyway
To make sure the ladies hear what I say
And from here to there they hear my voice
The ladies hear me, I am their choice
Because my hair’s more wavy than there’s ships in the Navy
And they use a boat to stay afloat
To put hickeys all over my throat
Because I am so cool…
Because I’m cool as snow, I’m like savoir-faire
I’m the man you can find anywhere
Because I’m cooler than cold, I’m hotter than heat
I rock to the rhythm of the funky beat
Because I got what it takes
To make everybody want to break
You see I got-a what it take
I take it, make you want to break
Breaker one (breaker one), breaker two (breaker two)
I said-uh, this is what I want to say to all of you
Go and telephone or tell a friend
The man known as Super Rhymes is back again
And all you fly guys, I’ll tell you this
I’ll take your fly girls with one kiss
Because I take the fly girls, put ‘em in check
I got my love potion all around they neck
They’ve heard my voice and they know my name
They know within me there burns a flame
That I’m MC man headed straight for fame
I got a Coupe DeVille, diamond rings
I even got fur coats and gold plate things
'Cause I’m the man of the hour, too sweet to be sour
The ladies know I’m the man with the power
And now that you know a little more about me
This is how I rocked KBC
You see, deep in the desert, the city Baghdad
Aladdin was the boy, a magic lamp he had
Aladdin was to rub it and soon find out
That the lamp had magic and a genie, no doubt
He rubbed the lamp, the genie appeared
But you really couldn’t see him ‘til the green smoke cleared
Well, the smoke was gone and there he stood
The tallest damn cat in the neighborhood
He said, “Where I come from I committed a crime
For every little thing you must serve time
But if my lamp was rubbed I’d be set free
But otherwise within the lamp I stay eternally
And Aladdin, I say thanks to you
You rubbed my lamp, now my sentence is through
And Aladdin, your wish is my command
I’m sorry, but you only get three, my man”
He said, “Genie, my first wish would be
To go to the year 1980”
”Hocus pocus,” said the genie, “I'll do that”
Aladdin looked around, saw where he was at
He said, “Damn, things aren’t the same
I wonder if Aladdin is still my name
But it’s nice to be in ‘80
And I got to say thanks to you, genie”
He said, “There’s nothing to it, I used to do it
Just about everyday
Until I went to court, I got put in the lamp
And the judge to take the spell away
But then you came along, made right my wrong
You rubbed my lamp and you set me free”
He said, “You used one wish, and you got two left
Aladdin, tell me what’s it going to be?”
He said, “Genie, in this society
You must have the green stuff called money”
So “hocus pocus” said the genie, “here’s a million bucks
To take it all with you here’s an armored truck”
“Thanks,” said Aladdin, “Genie, you’re a real champ
But for a little while get back in your lamp”
The genie said, “Aladdin, yes, I’ll do that
But you got another wish, now I’ll be back”
So with a puff of smoke the genie was gone
Aladdin said, “A new millionaire is born”
Well, with all that money he made more money
Aladdin was doing swell
You see, my man Aladdin, he got smart, you see
Invested money into an oil well
But then one day he said, “I'm tired
Of making the desert scene”
He said, “I got to get away, I got to go to the disco
Find the freak of my dream”
So he took control of his private jet
His magic lamp and money he could not forget
Yes, he got to the disco, danced and screamed
But still couldn’t find the freak of his dream
But then she came, through the door
The baddest freak Aladdin said he ever saw
He said, “Wow! I got to get that girl!
Her love is worth anything in the world”
She was a 38-24-35
Aladdin was attracted like a bee to a hive
Aladdin walked up, said, “Hello”
She looked him up and down and said, “You know where you can go”
He said, “Come on, baby, don’t play no game
I’m called Aladdin, tell me, what’s your name?”
Well, out of all the things Aladdin tried
She said, “Listen, sucker, take a carpet ride”
Aladdin said, “I know what to do
I call on my genie with a spell for you
So then he rubbed the lamp, the genie came back out
The genie said, “Aladdin, what you’re fussing about”
He said, “Genie, I rocked, I said I’d be her man
I tried to do it to her cause I thought I can
It was then that I met this girl
Who said she wouldn’t freak me for nothing in the world”
Out of all the things that Aladdin thought
She told him a body just couldn’t be bought
So Aladdin said, “At 4:50
I know you’re coming to this bank with me”
But the freak told him no
And my main man Aladdin, he told her so
He said, “I grab my partner do-si-do
I spank her to the beat, but don’t let go
Until I hear her holler ‘yo, yo’”
To the beat, beat, check it out
The genie said, “Aladdin, I agree
This freak has got a vicious body
But that wish will be your last one
After I do it, my job is done”
The genie said, “Your wish is my command
She’ll be your girl, you’ll be her man”
So he crossed his arms, said a magic word
A “hocus pocus” is what you heard
He said, “Aladdin, she belongs to you
Take her home and do what you want to do
But now it’s time that I leave
I pull my magic carpet down out my sleeve
I’m going to climb aboard, I’m going to fly away
Back to Baghdad, that’s where I’ll stay”
So Aladdin looked up, said goodbye
He watched the magic carpet and the genie fly
Now this is the end of this little tale
It’s time I keep rocking, the genie’s out of jail
So when I say “rock,” you say “roll”
When I say “ice,” then you say “cold”
Then when I say “disco,” you say “the beat”
I say “it’s like honey,” then you say “it’s sweet”
I say “rock”—“roll”
I say “ice”—“cold”
Say “disco”—“the beat”
“Like honey”—“it’s sweet”
Now you know my name, you know my game
Compared to me there’s none the same
Because I got a funky groove, I'm going to make your body move
Because I got what it take-a-take to make you want to break-a-break-a
Breaker one (breaker one), breaker two (breaker two)
I said you heard my jam, now catch the boogaloo flu
'Cause I'm Super Rhymes with disco
I rock from here to Frisco
I make you hate your video
While I rock your mind in stereo
So kick off your shoes, relax your feet
You're going to move to my beat that sound so sweet
Because it's all of you I do adore
And I got so much and more in store
Cause all through the day, through the night
I sit down and new rhymes I write
Because this DJ, he gets down
Mixing records while they go round
With the hid-dip, the hop, you just don't stop
You bop to the beat till it makes you drop
Because I rock so good, I rock so well
I ring-a-ding-a-dang-a-ding-ding-a-dang
Baby, I ring your bell
Because I rock and roll
In ster-e-er-e-o
I rock and roll
In ster-e-er-e-o
Like Fred Flintstone said yabadabado
You hear my jam, want to yell it too
Because I got more rhymes than a clock chimes
I got more rhymes than a monkey climbs
I got more rhymes than a lemon and limes
And I got more rhymes than a bank got dimes
So freak it to the east, freak it to the west
I freak it to the girl with the biggest chest
Freak it to the west, then you freak it to the east
But you never freak out with an ugly beast
So young ladies in the '80s
Come and ride in my Mercedes
'Cause the ladies see they all must stare
Because I got brown eyes and a wavy hair
I'm not so tall, but I'm not so short
And you young ladies are my favorite sport
So put your hand in the air and let me know you're out there
You put your hand in the air and let me know you're out there
Then scream oh yeah—“oh yeah!” Oh what?—“oh yeah!”
Y'all, I'm leaving now, but I'll be back
To make the young ladies catch a need-a-freak attack
Yes, the time has come for me to leave the mic
But I'll be back with more of what you like
So…take a chill"
Just Another Day,Too $hort,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'blues']","[Verse 1]
I woke up one day in Vacaville
Round the corner from the pen, phat house on the hill
All the homies in the pen straight locked down
But I gotta get dressed and hit the Oaktown
I called Randy Austin on the telephone
Early in the morning but he still ain't home
So I called Ant Banks to see what's up
He said meet me at the studio at two o'clock
I got dressed, smoking on some serious dank
Grabbed my keys off the table and a big old bank
I hit Interstate 80 and I'm rolling
Joint's still burning and I'm smoking
I was on my way to San Jose
To the stereo shop that make my music play
Cause one amp shut down and the bass ain't playing
Didn't take long, for Joel and Janks to have me slumping
So I called up Boo--""What's up nigga, what you bout to do?""
He said, ""just kicking back waiting on the fellas
Bout to go eat at Della's""
I said, ""it sure sounds good to me
I can't go though, gotta hit Myrtle Street""
Passed the Acorns on my way, bitch, it's just another day
[Interlude]
Every day in the motherfucking Oak-town, just another motherfucking day for Short Dog, you know what I'm saying? Roll up to the studio, lay down some funky beats
Drink some of that Old English, smoke some fat ones, fuck wit my partner

[Verse 2]
Big Banks came through and started mixing
Sitting in the studio kick back listening
To some funky ass shit from the Dangerous Crew
Debbie D came through, with FM Blue
Shorty B rolled up smoking fat ones
Pee-Wee had a crew in the back room
Goldie had the tramps giving head, breaking off
Rappin' Ron and Diddley-Dog
Twin One and Two is telling stories
Bout beating down niggas for the glory
Had to catch a plane that night and roll out of town
Everybody getting high, trying hard to clown
I had to go shop before its time to leave
I dipped to the mall, flipped me some jeans
Rolled on out like a playa
Hot ass day, bitches everywhere
I'm leaning hard to the left like a big shot
Checking out the hoes seeing who'll get knocked
Cause when you fuck with Short you get fucked quick
I run some drama on your ass and make ya suck dick
Ride through the OZ beaming it slow
Talking that shit how niggas on the four
Drive crazy, trying to tear up shit
It's just another day in Oakland, bitch
[Interlude]
Yeah them niggas from East Oakland be driving crazier than a mothafucker man
Niggas over there on 84 beamin niggas always talkin about uhh: ""This how we
Drive on the '4 mayne, y'know."" Doing donuts and shit, running all up on the curb
Breaking up news cars and shit nigga. Really though though, that's some Oakland shit bitch

[Verse 3]
It was me, Jaque, Beamin and Tilo
Boo-Kicky, Slow Motion and PO
Spud, Ju-Ju, Frog and Big-E
Getting high on Orral Street
Bug, Joe-A, Ce-Ce and Mark
Rolling four deep from Sobrante Park
Howard came through from the B-Town
Motherfuckas getting high, it's going down
It's the same everyday everyday it's the same
But that night we hit the hoop game
Who was playing: Seattle versus Golden State
Hollered at the home boy Gary Payton
After the game, we went to his house
NBA Jams, turned us out
Niggas talking bout slamming bones
Any kinda way to get your gamble on
Bet, all you kept hearing was bet
Dice game on the pool table? fuck that shit
I ain't going outta town broke
I gotta have a bank get some dank to smoke
Think I'm gambling, you must be insane
It started getting late I had to catch that plane
So I cut to the airport
Just another day for Too Short
[Interlude]
Yeah I do that kind of shit y'know, it ain't no thing but a chicken wing little bitch. Short Dog's in the motherfucking house, kicking it with QDIII on the LA scene, ain't no thing baby, cause uh, we coming up in the game that's how we do, we getting money, and we go here and there, and we clock the bank you know what I'm sayin?.............Bitch

[Verse 4]
I was high as fuck on the airplane
Thinking to myself 'bout street game
How a black man'll do you in a minute
Walk around the corner see some shit and get in it
How the police always trying to catch us
Fell asleep and woke up in Houston, Texas
Gangsta ass niggas from the fifth and the third
Take yo ass there nigga, fuck what ya heard
Next night we did a show, in New Orleans
Same gangstas same old scene
Yelling at seventh at ninth ward
I see my homies from the third and the fourth
It was me, Big Dog and the 8-Guard posse
Having fun and you just can't stop me
I did a show in Birmingham, Alabama
Then caught an airplane in Atlanta
I heard about the motherfucking freaknick
Popped that pussy ho, fuck that weak shit
You shoulda seen all the bitches on the street
Niggas from Detroit was deep
All my partners from the O flew up
And they was slanging that danky stuff
Getting high with some brothers from Miami and Cleveland
Kicking back, talking 'bout we ain't leaving, bitch

[Interlude]
We ain't going nowhere, we gonna stay here another day y'know, it's just another day, oh you know, guess I'll uhhhh, get through and roll back to the Oak-town
Ridin with the Cadillac Club or something, you know, F-R-O-G, old school, Too Clean in the house biatch, QDIII on the beat, I wanna say what's up to little Darrell, my partner D, what's up D baby, all my partners in the pen: North County, Santa Rita. My brother Wayne Loc, it's just another day....bitch"
Jus Lyke Compton,DJ Quik,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop']","[Verse 1: DJ Quik]
Finally out the muthafuckin' CPT
Off to other cities and shit
No longer just an underground hit
Movin thangs, a local nigga made good
I made a name off of making tapes for niggas in the hood
And now, let me tell a little story
About the places that I been to and the shit that I been through
Like fightin' and shootouts and bangin and shit
All because a nigga made a hit, check it
1991, it was double or nothing, not a nigga wit' hit
Then we broke out with the fonky shit
About bitches and niggas and gettin' drunk and off that bud
I was doing the shit they hadn't heard of
But foolish was I to think that it wasn't no other cities like this
And they didn't like this
That Compton was the home of a foot in yo' ass
Where you got blast, and now that's just a thing of the past
Let me tell ya why firsthand
We did a show up in Oak-land and niggas was kickin up sand
To them bangin' ain't nothin' new, and slangin' ain't nothin' new
And for every nigga we done shot, they done shot two
Straight doin' locs since the sixties, before I was born
Families of young niggas mourn
So I'm just letting you know
That if ya plan to take a trip to the Bay
Keep your hand on your clip
Because Oakland (ha ha ha, is just like Compton)
Yeah, I'm telling y'all Oakland (ha ha ha, is just like Compton, fool)

[Verse 2: DJ Quik]
Moving on to St. Louis, where they country as fuck
With gold teeth in they mouth but they still know what's up
Where it's hot as a muthafucka, hot enough to make ya cuss
That's why I kept my ass on the bus
But later on when it cooled off we came down and met a couple of friends
Who put us up on the St. Louis cap
The Smith Center, with Big Bob, Little Steve, Tojo, Biss and Rich
And a couple of bitches
Then they took us to a man named Gus in a store
He put us down with a herringbone and shoes galore
That's when I started thinking that this wasn't like home
But then they had to prove me wrong
'Cause later that night after we did the show
We went back to the afterset, and wouldn't ya know
Yeah, Bloods and Crips start scrappin' and shootin' -- in Missouri?
Damn, how could this happen?

Now St. Louis (ha ha ha, is just like Compton)
Yeah y'all, St. Louis (ha ha ha ha, is just like Compton, nigga)

[Verse 3: DJ Quik]
I don't think they know, they too crazy for their own good
They need to stop watchin' that Colors and Boyz n the Hood
Too busy claimin Sixties, tryin to be raw
And never ever seen the 'Shaw
But now, back to the story that I'm tellin'
We packed up the tour bus one more time and started bailin'
When we arrived I saw red and blue sweatsuits
When I'm thinkin' 'bout horse dookie, and cowboy boots
I guess Texas ain't no different from the rest
And San Antonio, was just waitin' to put us to the test
And before it was over the shit got deep
A nigga got shot in the face, and was dead in the street
Then they came in the club thinkin' of scrappin'
Little did they know that we was packin'
Yeah, we was puttin' 'em down and scaring the rest, shit
I even had to wear the bulletproof vest
Now San Antonio (ha ha ha ha, is just like Compton)
Yeah, San Antonio (ha ha ha ha, is just like Compton, bitch)

[Verse 4: DJ Quik]
After about a month on the road
We came home and I can safely say
That L.A. is a much better place to stay
How could a bunch of niggas in a town like this
Have such a big influence on niggas so far away?
But still my story ain't over 'cause I got one more to tell
And the people of Colorado, they know it well
It was all in the news and if you don't remember
I had this show I did in Denver
With a punk ass promoter in a bunk ass skating rink
Bitches was lovin it, but niggas was shovin and shit
To the front of the stage to throw their gang signs
But I'm getting paid so I didn't pay it no mind
Then I poured out my brew onto their face and chest
Then they start throwin' soda, and fuckin' up my Guess
When it was over two niggas needed stitches
Got cracked in they jaw for being punk ass bitches

Now Denver (ha ha ha, is just like Compton)
Yeah, y'all Denver (ha ha ha, they wanna be like Compton, bitch)
And you know that Oakland (ha ha ha, is just like Compton)
Yeah, y'all, St. Louis (ha ha ha ha, we made it just like Compton, fool)
Uh-huh, San Antonio (ha ha ha ha ha, is just like Compton)
Yeah, and Denver (ha ha ha, they wanna be like Compton, punk ass niggas)
I thought ya knew (ha ha ha, yeah)"

This nigga Terra is past butter, sharp like a glass cutter
Ass brother, I leave your rhyme trash gutter
I'm more rare, the MC in this warfare
Put you in a morgue where it's too late for that Lord prayer
Power struck, Terra drops the follow-up
Sour luck, niggas gotten props to swallow nuts

[Verse 3: Herb McGruff]
For those that don't know, yo, I'm Herb McGruff
I'm on some murder stuff and when I talk every verb is rough
Front on this and get beat bad
With big bats that bruise
Break bones, then wind up bloody in a bodybag
MC's are live, but I'm mad liver
Aiyo, my rhymes are more funky than a African cab driver
Step to this and get sliced with ease, ate up like rice and peas
(Herb, can you fight?) Yo, I'm nice with these
Ask the nigga in my last bout
He thought I just was on some gun shit, I had to knock his ass out
Microphones I gotta tear
Peace to Big L, straight from Hell, I'm the fuck up outta here
[Verse 4: Buddah Bless]
Aiyo, it's time to get drastic, but God bless the fantastic
Herb passed it, now I melt the mic like it's plastic
I rag crews 'cause I'm bad news
In a mad mood, I'm servin' brothers quicker than fast food
Step to this and get your body blown
'Cause I'm no maricón, for poems I slide the hotties home
Here's some advice, I'm mad nice
Aiyo, I'm quick to lick the mag twice and cold take a fag's life
My swellin' melon got niggas jealin'
Aiyo, fuck bribes, I'm takin' niggas lives like a felon

[Verse 5: Big Twan]
Yo, I'm bustin' chumps like a Glock 10
When I drops in, the top ten is rocked when it's locked in
I just abuse the flow, don't need a fuse to blow
Bruise the groove slow, when I rhyme I just kill your show
I got lines that's deeper than a jail bid
No frail, kids get nailed and read braille when they fail, dig
Yeah, and I'm nasty, too nasty to trash me, bash me
Aiyo, that's dead, so don't ask me
You'd get bumped off if beef ever jumped off
I never come soft, I gotta pump that's sawed-off
But when I let slugs out, you will get rubbed out
You dissin', you'll come up missin' like a cub scout
[Verse 6: Killa Kam - Cam'Ron]
Rappers be funny like Fletch
'Cause they sections say they slaughter, son
Talk about nines and TECs, and never shot a watergun
But Killa Kam, I get erratic when it comes to static
There you have it, a trigger fanatic with a automatic
Increase the peace that cease 'cause once I release
My crew from the East, we leavin' at least 20 police deceased
It's the beast on attack, so make tracks, I break backs
I jack with def gats and black MACs
On Lenox Ave., ain't no light looks, you fight crooks
Left and right hooks, if you front, get your life took

[Verse 7: Trooper J]
I'm havin' nail-sharp pains in my brain like a Hellraiser
I'm blazin' trails from jail cells, so a trailblazer
Who find crime and fill the nine with nothin' but lead
Boom-bye-bye, dem find another batty bwoy dead
In backyard alleys, but I call 'em crack-more valleys
And I pack more rallies than riots back in Cali
And people wanna know the reason why I blow my fuse
I'm in a daze and I'm so confused
From seein' heads shake so many times the lead make
And Mike Boogie's next up, and keep my head straight

[Verse 8: Mike Boogie]
I should never rhyme 'cause every time I step into a contest
Kids evacuate the premises like it's a bomb threat
'Cause they know when I start droppin' poems
That I be knockin' domes, poppin' bones
And sendin' niggas hoppin' home
Word to God, it's kinda hard for a fag to touch this
So if you're comin' to see me, nigga, bring a cast and crutches
And niggas, I don't need a gun for you, none of you
'Cause I can kill you dead with the lead from my Number 2
And it's death in every paragraph
And niggas learn when I burn their motherfuckin' ass to ash
No need to question am I nice 'cause it's a fact, friend
I shoot the gift like Santa Claus with a MAC-10
And niggas ain't half as nice, so they get sacrificed
And sent to the afterlife, they ain't no match for Mike
Now I'm 'bout to skate in a rush, just finished makin' it tough
Peace to Big L, aiyo, 8 is enough

[Outro: Big L]
True, true and before I get up outta here
I gotta say peace to D-Whiz and Short Man
Brothers that was there since the beginning
What's up to Rock-N-Will from the Hard Pack Crew
Peace to Mase Murder and the B.B.O. Crew
The Best Out Crew, the M&M Crew
And all the other crews that's representin' in Harlem
You know what I'm sayin?
And last but not least
I gotta say peace to the 139th Street NFL Crew

I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you

I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me

I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take y'all back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that, mommy, can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
'Cause a nigga cheatin', telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'ma love you 'til you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'ma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin' loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)

I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you

I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me

[Verse 2]
Forrest Gump mama said, ""Life is like a box of chocolates""
My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir, please
Give me a verse of ""You Are So Beautiful To Me""
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy
Come on Mommy just dance wit' me, let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey, y'all say, Mama, now everybody answer me (Hey Mama)

I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do

I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me

[Verse 3]
I guess it also depends though if my ends low
Second, they get up you gon' get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama)
Tell your job you gotta fake 'em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'ma get you a Jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday
For me to just call and say: (Hey Mama)

[Chorus]
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
You know I love you so
I never let you go
Wrote this song just so you know
No matter where you go our love is true

Your attention, please! Your attention, I need it
So I can sit you in a position from which I see it

Heavy-weighter, slim as the Machinist, so bulimic
Which means you somewhere in between it
I take it back for you like the Wyld Stallyns of San Dimas
I'm in the market for low-mile 360 Modenas
And a good organic cleaners
My car always a winner
Your car's always pitted, we should call it Stanley Steamers
Most of my friends in gangs
My new nickname is Genghis Khan
But without the 'Ye, but his last name's my side
I ride with the meanest, I'm armed to the teeth
You're Venus and you've never been to the dentist
School of Hard Knocks, I dean it
I done it, as well as a celebrated alumnus
I donate to the campus and my name's on the arenas
But you can't bring it to my court not even with subpoenas
Cause you can't play my sport but you can still cheerlead us
And you can't sit there, that section's for the seniors
And the sexy señoritas, so just move up to the bleachers
How you going to school me when I grew up with your teachers
I know that you can't hear me 'cause I blew up all the speakers
And the power line is hanging 'cause I threw up all the sneakers
I ate up the im-pastas and I chewed through all the pizzas
I blacked out with a black card and I maxed out all the Visas
Accreditation so prestigious, just walk across my stage
Your life will be completed
Don't need financial aid, 'cause this is just some free shit
You been properly prepared, throw your hats up in the air
I'm red hot, Chilly, I'm Anthony Kiedis
My spirit smells teenage, and Chi-Town's feeling excellent
We hit them with the President, see, we set the precedent
I don't feel I'm best, I just feel I'm better than...
[Chorus: Sample]
""Everyone
Everyone around here
Everyone is so near
It's holding on
It's holding on""

[Verse 2]
See I don't disagree, this is just a grievance
This ain't dissing, this is civil disobedience
How you going to make hip-hop without all the ingredients?
Lot of mouths to feed, plus a lot of greediness
And that greed, outshines the neediness
What niggas need is some question they authority
And tune out all the TV shit
And we be this
So I give them more, you see, I did it for...

Everyone
Everyone is so near
Everyone has got the fear
It's holding on
It's holding on

Yeah, I am back up on the airwaves
Feeling like a Soldier and I ain't talking where the Bears play
Flair, look how I Fred Astaire down the staircases
It's finna be a hair-raising tortoise versus hare race
So you should hang around here like some earrings
I know attention's all about how you pair things
So when I want them to hear me out
I just sit them next to some pictures of Rosa splitting with her titties out
And what's written on her titties is what it's really about
Then her vagina is some poor kids from China
Nipples, nuclear missiles
Ass is a daughter without a dad, back is like Afghanistan, Iraq
Health care hair, drive-by thighs, education lips, HIV eyes
Environment feet, justice get her so wet
Brains get you brains, you can fuck her if you protest
But before you bust in her face

So heavenly, waking niggas up like Reveille
We won't be going back to you regularly, so forget it
Shadow flow, colder than Punxsutawney Phillip
My mind's on dope, my brain's on skillets
Thoroughly trained to just bang off lyrics
Bang bang bang like Pops Wayans
Witherspoon or with a fork, was coming out my egg like Mork
Deserves his own head on Rushmore
Flood the game like a giant in a dwarf's shorts
So long niggas, career so short
It should be riding on a horse, mines is a horse
But mines is the size you could sneak inside a fort
Yours is a pony, it could sleep inside a Porsche

And they got the nerve to hunt down my ass
And treat me like a criminal

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Look, it is what it is because of what it was
I did what I did cause it does what it does
I don't put nothing above what I am, what I love
My family, my blood, my city and my hood
Hater for the greater good, I'm back from Hollywood
And I ain't changed a lick, though I know I probably should
But what I'm doing is not a good look
I never did it by the good book as a lifetime crook
All the petty crime took a toll on me
I look around at my homies that's getting old on me
But still something got a hold on me, maybe it's fate
If it's coming, yo, I'm willing to wait, I'm not running
I done ran through the muck, I done scrambled and such
I done robbed and odd jobbed and gambled enough
Until I'm put up in handcuffs and pissing in a cup

Get treated like a criminal if crime is all you know
Get greeted like a nigga if a nigga's all you show
A public enemy that's in the eye of the scope
My city like a island where you can't find a boat
Have you wishing for a raft and praying that hope floats
Some real ethnic cleansing going down, no soap
Who looking for a chair and some real strong rope
Just to end it all here, screaming, ""Fuck the mayor""
He see the faces at the bottom of the well clear
They act like I'm something to fear, trapped in urban warfare
Putting triggers 'head a college career
Can't ignore the call of the wild, that's drawing them near
Try to make fast money last long some years
Try to laugh it off, still couldn't lose the tears
To the rules, I will not adhere, break the law, yeah

Who want to challenge mine? I'm sick of St. Valentine
I did the violent crimes, that's why I got this style of rhyme
Seek repentance to spitting them sentences that's senseless
Experience is the difference, you can't convince this
In a crime sense, niggas is infants
I'm like a senior citizen, still living but getting benefits
Put emphasis on hitting my nemesis in high percentages
Crooked ass cops is the reason for my belligerence
And it gets deeper than that, 'member nights I used to sleep with a gat
With a package of crack under my sneaker strap
D's sneak attack, arraign me, it took a week for that
Beat the rap, but you're saying ""Look, he think he the mack""
Fuck y'all, niggas who thinking they might try us
Watch us insight riots, flip cars and light fires
We already been knocked, scrutinized
Plus cops rush to brutalize us, America is polluted by lust

If I ain't got love for you then fuck you

I'm coming down fast, but I'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on, tell me the answer
Well, you may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer

Now, Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Yeah
Woo

Oh, will you, won't you want me to make you?
I'm coming down fast, but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer

Look out
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Ooh
Look out
'Cause here she comes

When I get to the bottom, I go back to the top of the slide
And I stop, and I turn, and I go for a ride
And I get to the bottom, and I see you again
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, do you, don't you want me to make you?
I'm coming down fast, but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me your answer
You may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer

Look out

Well look out, helter skelter
She's coming down fast

Yes, she is
Coming down fast

Window Shopper,50 Cent,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Ohh!
The top feel so much better than the bottom
So much better

[Chorus]
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the dealership tryin' to get a test drive
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

[Verse 1]
Summertime, white Porsche Carrera is milky
I'm on the grind, let my paper stack but I'm filthy
It's funny how niggas get to screw-facin' at me
Anyhow they ain't got the heart to get at me
I'll get down, Southside's the hood that I come from
So I don't cruise through nobody hood without my gun
They know the kid ain't gon' fall for all that bullshit
Try and stick me, I'ma let off a full clip
It ain't my fault you done fucked up your re-up
At the dice game, who told you put a G up?
Everybody mad when they paper don't stack right
But when I come around y'all niggas better act right
When we got the tops down, you can hear the systems thump
Nigga, when we rollin', rollin', rollin'
Shut your block down, quick to put a hole in a chump
Nigga, when we rollin', rollin', rollin'
[Chorus]
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy

Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

[Verse 2]
Niggas love me in L.A. as soon as I pop in
They come to scoop me up at LAX and I hop in
Now when it comes to bad bitches you know I got them
Some from Long Beach, some from Watts and from Compton
You know a nigga wanna see how Cali girls freak off
After that five hour flight from New York
I start spittin' G at a bitch like a pimp, mane
Tell her, ""Meet me at the Mondrian so we can do our thang.""
She can bring the lingerie with her, I sup-pose
Then we can go from fully dressed to just havin' no clothes
Then she can run and tell her best friend 'bout my sex game
Then her best friend could potentially be next, mane
Listen mane, shit changed, I came up, I'm doin' my thang
Homie, I'm holdin', holdin', holdin'
Oh shit, mane, the store owner watchin' you
Before somethin' get stolen, stolen, stolen
[Chorus]
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy

Military Minds,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'alternative', 'r&b']","[Produced by Darryl Harper and E.D.I. (Remix)]

[Intro: 2Pac]
Stand in formation, my motherfuckin' real troopers
Let's do it like soldiers - all and together now!
Ready? Hell yeah, y'all niggas better get ready
No retreat, no surrender, death before dishonor motherfucker!
Do it to 'em, c'mon never die thuggish, uhh - YES YES YES
Say what? (Eastside, Westside ride) Where ya at, where ya at?
Where my real thugs, where ya at, where ya at?
Where my real thugs, where ya at, where ya at?
Where my real thugs, where ya at?!
Hehehe, send cases to the drug dealer
Real thugs, where ya at? You motherfuckin' home
Do it to 'em, do it to 'em
They love the way we do it to 'em, we do it to 'em

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Suppress the revolution a premeditated scheme
Introduce a drug called crack to us ghetto teens
Got a law for raw niggas, now, playa what it be like?
When will niggas see they got us bleedin' with three strikes?
Can't seem to focus hopeless, with violent thoughts I wrote this
Got these Devils petrified, hidin' from my hocus-pocus
And so I learned to earn my currency and over time
Affiliated, clearly click of military minds
May God forgive us though we dwell inside a paradox
Thugged out and drug dealin', from the womb to the block
My live mind got me survivin' five rounds (shots)
My forty-five got me fortified with live rounds
When shit's thick we plot hits, when my Glock spits
All hail, out on bail, wrath of the 2Pacalypse
Forever ghetto necessary picture food stamps
Outlaw Thug Niggas never left the Boot Camp
[Verse 2: Cocoa Brovaz]

[Tek]
They called us for assignment, one of the squad's finest
Skills in guerilla warfare and blessed with refinement
My rap sheet, contains sections of bomb sessions
Says I'm responsible for black Smif-N-Wessun
Puttin likkle yout's in a military state of mind
Dangerous like chronic and yard when combined
Cocoa Brovaz 'pon de borderline
Test de sound and ye dead same ti-ime

[Steele]
Man to man, I'm facin' the Devil with a plan
Judo stance, first glance, I'm makin' my advance
Animal instincts, intelligence of an assassin
Masked men, ninjas that surround me, ready to attack
I react swiftly, what father taught me sticks with me
Never forget the method, stick and move strictly
Shit be seemin' like it's closin' in
With no regrets I hold position
Cause I suppose I'm one of the chosen men

[Verse 3: Buckshot]
Picture being put in a position to move
And you can't move cause your move is blocked by the knight
At twelve o'clock, that's when the madness begins
So I start to focus in, my thoughts on the war
Cause the rule is the law, and the law that we live by
Is to stay true to self, in this case, BDI
Why try if ya body lie
By the block true soldier mentality, this is how we rock and roll
(This is how we ride)
[Boot Camp Clik]
Stick and move, time to show 'em how to make a move
Or get moved on, let's see who strong

[Verse 4: Cocoa Brovaz]
[Tek]
In the gaze of the strange, where nothin stays the same
Where new faces come through with similar game
Now who you thought was them, really ain't
They catchin' deja vu's of the game people play
It's a call for readjustment, fine tune yo' position
You slippin' and trippin' 'stead of bobbin and dippin'
But never let this world of stress get the best of me
Takin' breathin' techniques, slay you with Tai-Chi

[Steele]
What does it take, to get a break in the world of snakes
And dose who fake
Elimination I'm facin' destruction
Outlawed, so I duck and down, fo'-fo' is bustin', no one to trust in
Rushin' to the goal line
Catch a nigga beat him treat him like he stole mine
No swine I'm a soldier, soldier I control mine
Time to, take you, back into time - follow dis here

[Verse 5: Buckshot]
One way out, this black hole
For this black soul, shit is outta control
I'm fightin' for my position to be a fetus in this world I'm enterin'
And my face is sentencin' for repentance
Before my body was fully formed into a human
I was already consumin' weed
Cause my moms used to smoke back in the 70's
Maybe that's why in the 90's I drop G's when I drop degrees
When I ease across the block with 'Pac
Got all y'all niggas shocked
You didn't think Boot Camp Clik would link, with a Outlaw mind?
If you do you press rewind
And you can peep guerilla tactics in every line
[Outro: 2Pac]
Yeah, and this is how we do it!
Where my real thugs, where they at?
Let me, see my real thugs, now where ya at?
Won'tcha, see my real thugs, where ya at?
Let me, see my real thugs, where ya at now?
Where my real thugs, let me see, where ya at?
Tell me where my real thugs gots to see, where ya at?
Where's my soldiers - where ya at?
Where my, real soldiers - where ya at?
Where my soldiers at; where ya at, where ya at?
Get yo' strap my nigga; where ya at, where ya at?
Where my soldiers at; where ya at, what ya at?
Getcha, thug niggas where ya at, witcha strap?
Where my soldiers at, where my true thug niggas
No longer drug dealers cause we now, thug niggas
Where my soldiers at, no longer drug dealers
Cause we now, thug niggas, let me, where my
Where my soldiers at?, put your pistols in the air
Where my soldiers at?, put yo' guns up
Tell me where my soldiers at?, put yo' pistols in the air
Where my, SOLDIERS, my true thug ROLLERS
Yes, it just doesn't quit, YES!
This is that real hip-hop shit YES!
Fuck what you heard
From the ghetto to the 'burbs, know we meant, every word
Where my SOLDIERS?, where my soldiers at
Where my SOLDIERS?, where my soldiers at
Put yo' hand on the pistol, put yo' pistols in the air
Where my soldiers at?, where my soldiers at?

Where my soldiers at, GO VOTE!!"

Affirmative no further furnishing is needed
I believe we are completed, dig
We all in agreement on the wallpaper
Happy with the color scheme, welcome to the crib
A two family Habitat For Humanity
With a view of where the insanity live
My vida loca was built like Bob Vila via God
He architected, I arted what I harbored, Jimmy Carter
From Chicago's west side, finish my construction now
We hold the coming like contracepts
I'm conscious, 'cept the cons I kept
With conversations held with the Satan on my shoulder
Which lead to steps that kept me looking over the shoulder
Like chauffeurs, where my angels at
Painful yet Mary I ain't Jerry Garcia, ma
Here but I'm grateful, chuuch!

[Hook: Gemini]
We just might be OK, after all
Sun gone shine, on this day
[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
It's finna get heavy as heaven
I am Atlas at this manage to balance
Massive masses pull my back with out tilting my glasses
This was not pilfered from passages of OG's, this is so me
Ask us many mention little homie, little bony
But the rhymes is fat, in fact
Just like a Rochester customer
God bless the mothers and younger brothers of hustlers
Cause she don't wan' sob at his wake
But he want to follow in his steps
Bang his hat, learn his shakes
Master his swagger in the bathroom mirror
Cop a Chevy, steady mob in his place
Chyeah! it's just the problems we face
Look his moms in her face and promise he's straight

[Hook: Gemini]
We just might be OK, after all
Sun gone shine, on this day

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Then he leaves the house that love built that
HUD renovated that section 8 pays for
Well let's pray for em, let the beat play for em
Put his struggles on display for em
Cause he gotta go and face the drama
With a different face from the one that he use
To face his momma, if you look close you'll see
It consist of a smile that hurts, an ice grill, and a trace of trauma
Little bit of his father, another criterion
That's no different from a young Liberian
Who let the delirium weary him, living in the inner city
Out of his mind, liria reconcilia
I'm cool, I don't foretell best
I ain't nicest MC, I ain't Cornel West
I am Cornel Westside, Chi-town Guevara
Malcolm eXorcise the demons, gangsta leaning
He traded in his kufi for a New Era
Chose a 44 over a mortarboard
I ain't a credited institute graduate, I ain't from Nazareth
My conception wasn't immaculate, I ain't master no calculus
A good addition to the rap audience
I back flipped on the mattress they slept on me on
Whaddown Joe, knowing is half the battle
Fighting temptation, have an apple
Shakes the snakes, pimp the system
Let's get into it, tabernacle

Kick Push,Lupe Fiasco,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced By: Soundtrakk]

[Intro]
Ugh! (Woo!)
What up, y'all? Yeah
(Soundtrakk, what's poppin', baby?)
Woo! (Ugh)
If y'all ain't know
I go by the name of Lupe Fiasco
(Kick, push, coast)
Representing that First and Fifteenth, yeah, uh
And this one right here
I dedicate this one right here (Uproxx...)
To all my homies out there grinding
You know what I'm saying? Legally and illegally, haha
You know what I'm talking about? (Woo!)
So, check it out, uh

[Verse 1]
First got it when he was six, didn't know any tricks
Matter of fact, first time he got on it, he slipped
Landed on his hip and busted his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp, like thisss... (Ugh)
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit, it was something in the air (Ugh)
Yeah, he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling, something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it, couldn't understand it
Branded, since the first kickflip he landed, ugh (Woo)
Labeled a misfit, a bandit
Ka-kunk, ka-kunk, ka-kunk; his neighbors couldn't stand it
So, he was banished to the park
Started in the morning, wouldn't stop 'til after dark, yeah
When they said ""It's getting late in here
So I'm sorry, young man, there's no skating here""
[Hook]
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be

[Bridge]
So let's kick... (Ugh)
And push (Y-yeah, y-yeah-yeah)
And coast
Uh, uh, uh (Y-yeah, y-yeah-yeah)

[Verse 2]
My man got a little older, became a better roller
Yeah, no helmet, hell bent on killing himself
Is what his mama said, but he was feeling himself
Got a little more swagger in his style
Met his girlfriend, she was clapping in the crowd
Love is what-what was happening to him now, ugh!
He said ""I would marry you
But I'm engaged to these aerials and varials
And I don't think this board is strong enough to carry two""
She said ""Bow! I weigh a hundred and twenty pounds"" (Woo!)
""Now, let me make one thing clear
I don't need to ride yours, I got mine right here""
So she took him to a spot he didn't know about
Some odd-end apartment parking lot
She said ""I don't normally take dates in here""
Security came and said ""I'm sorry, there's no skating here""
[Hook]
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
And away they roll
Just lovers intertwined with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be

[Bridge]
So let's kick (Ugh, ugh)
And push, yeah, yeah (Woo, woo)
And coast... (Yeah, ugh!)
(Haha, swanky)
Yeah, yeah!

[Verse 3]
Before he knew, he had a crew that wasn't no punk
In they Spitfire shirts and SB dunks
They would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing, they said (They said...)
An escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy, they needed to break out
They'd head... to any place with stairs
Any good grinds, the world was theirs, ugh!
And their four wheels would take them there
Until the cops came and said, ""There's no skating here""
[Hook]
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
And away they rolled
Just rebels without a cause with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
So come roll with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be

[Bridge]
So let's kick (Ugh, ugh)
And push, yeah, yeah (Woo, woo)

Hahah, man (Uhh, uhh)
You know I have you (Right, right, right, right)
You know! Uhh (Right, right, right, right)

[Verse 1]
They call me Lupe, I'll be your new day
They wanna smell like me, they want my bouquet
But they can't, they accented like the UK
Turn that eau de Lupe to Pepe Le Pew spray
Flagrantly fragrant and they can't escape it
My perfume pursued them everywhere that they went
You don't want a loan, leave my cologne alone
It's a little too strong for you to be putting on
Trust me, I say this justly
I went from musty to musky and y'all can't mush me
I warn y'all cornballs, I hush puppies
The swans in the pond call my duck ugly
But now they hug me, because it's lovely
They love the aroma of a roamer of the world
Got the shakers and the skaters and the players and the girls
Keep the fakers and the flakers and the haters in a twirl
[Hook]
You want the flava ma? Hey I gotcha
You want the realness? Well I gotcha
I know you sick of them niggas big car and watch you
Either they pimps or they macks or they mobsters
You want the real shit? Well I gotcha
You see my niggas here, you know we proper
You know we do it right (Right) right (Right)
Right (Right) right (Right)
Right (Right) right (Right) right (Right) right (You know we do it)

[Verse 2]
And I'm from Chi-Town, that's where I flies round
Keep some Cartier frames over my eyes now
We used to gangbang, a lot of that done died down
Children of the hat tiltin' keepin' hope alive now
All with no high, I do it so fly
Banksy's attack helicopter with the bow tie
I love my city, really hope that God bless it
Have my mind moving faster than that hog in the hedges
Welcome all of y'all to my dark recesses
This is where I keep the bars like bathtub edges
My Ivories and my Doves, my Levers and my Zests
This takes half of your bubble bath to match the freshness
The belly of the beast, you know I'm from it
I wrap it in a towel, hit Gomer Pyle in the stomach
And I be on my green like Irish Spring and I coast
Fudge with it, get a mouth full of soap

You want the flava ma? Hey I gotcha
You want the realness? Well I gotcha
I know you sick of them niggas big car and watch you
Either they pimps or they macks or they mobsters
You want the real shit? Well I gotcha
You see my niggas here, you know we proper
You know we do it right (Right) right (Right)
Right (Right) right (Right)
Right (Right) right (Right) right (Right) right (You know we do it)

[Verse 3]
And so to sign off, this beat I rhyme off
Is from Thelonious P and Hugo Mind Boss
You feel it in the air, it's such a fine force
But you don't hear me though, just like a mime's talk
That's cause I'm in Europe, me in my French tour
I'm on my pimp, my temperature is tempura
I take it easy on my watch, I'm watching TV
In my cleanest Maharashi, see the hare is tryna beat me
I continue to do Lu's pace
They say him got two heads and four eyes just like screwface
But see my secret's safe, it's in my secret safe
That's in my secret room on my secret base
So from the runner of the FNF crew
Come in hip hop, we've come to resurrect you
You, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you

You want the flava ma? Hey I gotcha
You want the realness? Well I gotcha
I know you sick of them niggas big car and watch you

You want the real shit? Well I gotcha

It's all about the dollar, all about getting the cash
While other niggas playing, I hustle and get it fast
Ain't no time to be wasting, paper I'ma chase it
Mashing for my cash, with no pauses or hesitation
A lot of niggas claiming, they pimping well let me see
Get her husband checked cash that check, then bring that check to me
See I know she down for me, ready to clown for me
Got licks out of state, she driving out of town for me
Drive off and pick up's, she gon make my rounds for me
And when I pimp my pen, she check out how it sound for me
When her husband leave the house, I go and get my head blown
She know I'm connected, know how I get my bread on
But if she get upset, and try to turn the FED's on
Don't want a headstone, plus I got her head gone
The game in overtime, and Famous in a red zone
C.M.G. 'nuff said, straight pimping going on huh

[Hook - 2x]

[Verse 3]
I keep my mind occupied in zone, for paper and pimp shit
You can catch a track, but I prefer you jack a limp dick
By any means the young gon get it, you feel what I'm saying though
Want work scared to hustle, fuck getting your ass hoe
Rather be on the block, fucking for free and shit
Work spinning contagious niggas, I just don't fuck with
The game warrant got it on lock, from Oregon to Orlando
Take me out, is like Bush being escorted without gas hoe
My forty low as the can, to your trash bin
I have a achie and scratching your residence, for your ends
I teach frauds now perfect credit, I mean that
That's the feddy and a egg, call her February and gum tacks
Bitch you ready to ride on my side, your stress I must confess
Nigga better out a vest on your mouthpiece, cause mine's is at it's best
Low on enough said, Entertainment is my click
The game sold never told, nigga ain't buying this shit
[Hook - 4x]

Close your mind
Close your eyes, see with your heart
How do you forgive the murderer of your father?
The ink of a scholar is worth a thousand times more
Than the blood of a martyr (uhh)
Terrorist (yeah, uhh)

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
We came through the storm, nooses on our necks
And a smallpox blanket to keep us warm
On a 747 on the Pentagon lawn
Wake up, the alarm clock is connected to a bomb
Anthrax lab on a West Virginia farm
Shorty ain't learned to walk, already heavily armed
Civilians and little children is especially harmed
Camoflauged Torahs, Bibles and glorious Qurans
The books that take you to heaven and let you meet the Lord there
Have become misinterpretated reasons for warfare
Reread them with blind eyes, I guarantee you there's more there
Rich must be blind cause they ain't see the poor there
Need to open up a park
Just close ten schools, we don't need 'em
Can you please call the fire department?
They're down here marching for freedom
Burn down their teepees, turn their TVs on to teach 'em
And move
[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
The more money that they make
The more money that they make, the better and better they live
Whatever they wanna take
Whatever they wanna take, whatever, whatever it is
The more that you wanna learn
The more that you try to learn, the better and better it gets

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Now the poor Ku Klux man see that we all brothers
Not cause things the same but cause we lack the same color
And that's green, now that's mean
Can't burn his cross cause he can't afford the gasoline
Now if a Muslim woman strapped with a bomb on a bus
With the seconds running, give you the jitters
Just imagine an American-based Christian organization
Planning to poison water supplies to bring the second coming quicker
Nigga! They ain't living properly
Break 'em off a little democracy
Turn their whole culture to a mockery
Give 'em Coca-Cola for their property
Give 'em gum, give 'em guns, get 'em young, give 'em fun
But if they ain't givin' it up, then they ain't gettin' none
And don't give 'em all, naw man, just give 'em some
It's the paper, some of these cops must be Al-Qaeda, nigga, uh

Look at what we did
Came a long way from dirty ghetto kids
Yeah, look at what we did
We came a long way from dirty ghetto kids
You know what it is, haha

[Verse 1]
Well the cops didn't fine 'em for grindin', no
They kinda blew the vibe, figured it was time to go
Plus he had to be at home a long time ago
And he had made like ten dollars off the sign he wrote
It read:
""A lil hungry, and need a lil money
It's for my lil sister and her lil tummy""
Wasn't lying tho, he didn't go buy hydro
Went to the restaurant and bought two gyros
Cause he knew they wasn't cookin' where he live
The kunk-kakunk-kakunks now took him to the crib
A lil hurt from the rail he took into the ribs
Right pass the pushers who couldn't under dig
What's the use of pushin'? You ain't pushin' none of this
If I kick it with y'all I'm just pushin' for a bid
But what was on his mind, and pushed him to the lid
Their best customer wasn't cookin' for her kids
Gets up to pump, so he
[Hook 1] (X2)
Kick, push
Over his shoulders he swore he'd never look
Cause wasn't nothing back there, but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive
Yeah, uh, and so he

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you see his mom was a crack head
And his father couldn't be contacted
He lived with being different, was combated
Amongst the other things on his young, black head
And see his girl was a white girl
But just cause she was white, see her life wasn't light world
She too had the drama thick
Had a daddy and a mama, but her daddy used to mama hit
Daddy caught something chasin' fatties, made her mama sick
Couldn't afford the medicine, pimped her to the pharmacist
Had suicidal feelings, would ride
Switch over the transition help her conquer it
Pays for mama's pills with a sponsorship
Her cell phone bill and a Honda kit
Uh huh, and that's why she skates with he
Someone to feel the pain and a place to be
That's why, that's why, that's why, she
[Hook 2] (X2)
Kick, push
Over her shoulders she swore she'd never look
Cause wasn't nothing back there, but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive
Yeah, uh, that's why she

[Verse 3]
Yeah, a traveling band of misfits and outcasts
Nod they heads from Misfits to Outkast
A lot of scars, they did this without pads
A lot of hearts who did this without dads
One's father was filthy rich
Two was middle class, and one was homeless
Add in the paralyzed girl in the wheelchair
Who just liked to watch, and that was the whole clique
I think about 'em every time I see this old flick
That was taken in the park in front of this old bench
They wrote on the back, ""You thank for push, kick
Hope you make a video, the beat is so sick""
Well I did, I hope you seen it
It's on MTV, Soundtrakk's a genius
Love from Tony Hawk, beef from the Ice Creamaz
Before we put it out, had to pay the Filipinas
Just to show 'em how you

Kick, push

With a tiger on his shirt, alligator on his blues
With a nice young lady and some righteous kung-fu
I'm fighting without fighting, enlightening you young fools
Frankensteins of mine, I tighten you young screws
Send lighting to your mind and make you move
Car like cannonball, run!
I'm lighting my guns fuse, one:
That mean I'll lean and leave you, I mean this, Needlz

And they sing my singles I can't even see you

I'm next to my black berry Molasses
Hat very slanted rapping to the riders
Writer of the stances driver of the riders
Matter of fact Shur the chauffeur
Reverse the fifteen teen is so serve
The serve is so mean like I served in the marines
And it's full metal jacket
Upset the jokers every time I draft it
They trys to jack it change my will

Hold it now!
You just walk up to her and say hi
That's all you gotta do
Say hi

Say hi

[Verse 1]
Well I know I'm not the coolest
And this might sound kind of foolish
Cause I know I'm not the smoothest, told myself I shouldn't do this
Cause I'm not very well-suited, not the popular-est of students
We ain't in the same crowd, always see you with the hoopers
But we got the same lunch, you might see me with the cooler
That's cause I don't eat pork, you can never be sure of
Oh, you like Linkin Park? That's the hat from the tour
I got an autographed shirt, they wrote, ""much love 2 ya""
Man that's really funny how we like the same music
But I really love jazz, I was gonna play the tuba
I tried to join the band, they said I was really, really bad
Didn't really make me sad, I'm used to being the loser
But you, I think you're super, so much, I had to pursue ya
I don't believe the things they say or the football team's rumors
The quarterback can't spell, I'm his after-school tutor
I just took a cue from Cupid, but, now I think it's stupid
I'm-I'm sorry
And then I walked away
Thinkin' that she would never talk to me
Like what were you thinking bringing up the band
Would have got a better result
If would have just beat her up and ran
You shouldn't have worn your glasses
Take your shirt up out your pants
See now it's all over and you won't get another chance
Damn, I was so close to her, then I felt a hand on my shoulder
[Verse 2]
She said, ""I know you're not the coolest
But I swear you are the cutest
And I know you played the tuba, I seen you at the recital
It takes a lot to get up there and embarrass yourself
But you shouldn't put down, you should merit yourself
That just mean you not a punk, I like Thelonious Monk
He's the wallpaper on my computer
I love Final Fantasy, I hate first person shooters (me too)
""Meteora"" was nice but I bought ""Hybrid Theory"" twice
Half of the cheerleading squad is in a stupor
The only reason I do it is 'cause my mother took state
When she was a junior
And she want me to do the same, so I'm like, naww
I wanna be an oncologist and diagnose tumors
I got a a pet parrot, his name is 'Mr. Tuna'
My favorite food is fish, remember that for the future
My IM name is missluna, you can hit me after six""

[Interlude]
How you feelin' right now?
Yes yes yes yes yes yes
Come, Seymour, we have things to do!
(How you feeling right now?)
And just like everything in life
Things grow, People grow
And people grow apart
It's like some things were just never meant to be
You see?
But, then again
Maybe
Some things are
[Verse 3]
You know today gonna be the coolest
And you know how far your school is
Know how dangerous the flu is, so button up your coat
And finish off your breakfast, you know how important fuel is
Food is to human as buoyancy's to boat
I knew this, everyday we gotta go through this
And I ask why you quote, cuz I'm your father Lucas
Pop, last night I was lookin over the futures
Commodities is felon, rental properties is sellin
The bio tech market share is at its hugest
I think we should ride this wave, we can't re-invent the Rubik's
Woah, we should of played her more music
Lucas, dear, why is your bookbag full of tulips

[Outro]
Umm, well Ma, you see there's this girl, you know
And I was thinking that I may walk to her, you know
Try and talk to her
Discuss different things that were taught to her
And see what makes her tick
You know? You know Mama?"

Devious skill that make a strong willed nigga wane
Since a lil nigga hang with the killers and distributers of 'caine
They dismemberers of swishers then refill it with the Jane
Then they tilt it and they lit it with a flame
Then they took a pull of killer to the brain like (inhale noise) ah
Evil minded like Krang they became
They deranged like the Rover that I rode
That was the Range that I drove when I was a little bit older, mayne
Declaring war on the deck like they The Joker
All while, ducking from Bruce Wayne
While they polka with the devil in our moonlitten ghetto
Hello My Name stickers on the stickers of the veins
In rehab, remembering the feelings when they used to get mellow
When they was all back of a nickel like Monticello
When the underworld had to be smarter than Donatello
No honor amongst fellows
It's harder than sitting with a blind man and
Trying to describe yellow
Got me feeling like killer Joe
My life the album, know the classics by heart
And exactly how the filler go
Repeat it on my way to the liquor store, Charlie

And do what we know how to do, you know

'Cause, I can't feel the field nigga chains
Though I covet mine, so I covered mine in bling
Then I bumped into a bum and covered mine in shame
Then I bumped into a hun and uncovered mine again
Diamonds then under minded mayne
They give a nigga with no mack another kinda game
See money talks in another kinda slang
Detectives can't decipher as they listen through the wire
As I accept the call and listen to the lifer
Getting religion, making wudhu in the sink of your cell
Reciting Al-Fatiha in the kitchen
Indeed on his deen and in addition to doing dishes
Listen as I get schooled to the rules to rule
The fuel of fools, the obstacles, the cool
Had to slow it down homie
Chopped and screwed, he said blow it down for me
Sticks and stones make the homes
Only God's words can stop the wolves
And don't fraternize with pigs those kids'll think your stool
Not at the bar but trying to put him behind the bar like a bartender
He laid the law like the bar so I put it in a bar for dude
He said, borrow my jewels and bar the fools

Get some beats besides George Clinton to rock over
Rap career is over, better off acting
What trouble I see in managing WC and Wack 10?
You backed into a four corner hustla
Lying on your dick, said you was fuckin her
Use higher learning, don't take my words out of 'text
Went from gangsta to Islam to the dick of Das EFX
It'll take the nation of millions to hold me back

I seen you (Mack 10), you ain't say shit in ATL
Cube, I like that diamond charm, I might cuff it, then sell-
It out, like you sold Kam and Threat
A year ago, you wasn't talking shit about the West
Guess you knew your shit was done plus the one got you cable
Hoo-bangin'? You ain't banging shit but the table
And the Circle MAAD ain't got no choice but to fight
Ain't none of y'all motherfuckers got a chance on the mic

Until you let that bitch in you walk up out you

Hold up a minute, I'm the King of the Ghetto
Holding the rap game, like wood grain can't let go
You niggas'll never see me, I'm on another level
Stay ready to dig a grave, keep a gun and a shovel
And Boric acid chewing up evidence
Saw me in the rear view, now you wonder where I went
I'ma get you if I owe ya, visit your residence
Lay the merk game down, and then I'ma hit the fence
Better keep my mouth closed, so they can't see the shining
They think it was Z-Ro, cause all they seen was diamonds
I'm cold as a deep freeze, with bags of ice in it
My .357 pretty, but ain't nothing nice in it

Got so many of my real niggas under the gutter
Watch a nigga full of life, light close like shutters

When it's time to get your jewelry done who do y'all call
Cause you fellas ain't shining at all, check me out
On the first and fifteenth, I'm some'ing like a pimp
Even with a suspended license, still finna flip
Ain't no limit to this cash, ain't nothing I can't get
5 deuce Hoova Cuz ain't nothing like a Crip
Ride with a Revolve', I don't fuck with clips
These roach ass niggas, trying to make me bust my chips
But I'm not a bank, I don't even trust my bitch
I'm from the South and I got diamonds in my mouth

Casualties of a Dice Game,Big L,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop']","[Intro]
It's Flamboyant y'all
Yeah, yeah yeah, Corleone y'all

[Verse]
Me and my man was cruisin through the streets and everything was flowin nice
The corner's crowded, niggas must be rollin dice
I parked the ride so my nigga Iroc can crash the lye spot
And I'mma gamble until he come back - why not?
Click-clack, cock the gat back, gotta be strapped
The game was mad packed, mad cats pockets was fat
They playin cee-lo, my dick get hard when I see dough
I bets nothin less than a G yo, you know my steelo
First I was losin then I started throwin headcrack
After headcrack, got my bread back, jumped in my red Ac'
I'm waitin for my nigga to come out of the spot
I see niggas startin to plot, and I'm far from my block
Finally he walked out, told him, ""Hop the fuck in""
On my face he saw the grin and said, ""How much did you win?""
I estimated about, 45 maybe 50 G's
My man was hungry so I dropped him off at Mickey D's
Now I'm alone, headin home to rest my dome
Spotted some niggas trailin so I picked up the phone
Called Bones, I said, ""Yo son, I'm on the run
Need your help before I get done
Meet me downstairs, bring your big gun""
I don't believe this, this nigga said he can't make it
Cause some bitch is in his house butt-naked
And then he hung up
And this supposed to be my man and he don't give a fuck
That duck sold me out just to get a nut, what?
I'm cruisin fast and they still behind me
The same nigga who I won the money from, and his grimy crimey
It's about to get, real hasty
Grabbed the steel, took it off safety
Cause I refuse to let these niggas waste me
I started to cruise fast, then stopped short and made 'em crash
And now them fags is all bloody from the shattered glass
And one of them had passed, when his face smashed the dash
I was injured too, leakin with a deep gash
I ain't panicked, I was quite calm
Couldn't use the right arm, so I grabbed the gat with the left
Walked up to the car the creep was stuck in the seat
Looked at him, shook my head then started buckin my heat
It's over now, cause both of these motherfuckers asleep
I think I'm dyin, I'm feelin weak out on my feet
But before I got some medical help, I had to catch a cab first
To one-forty-first and Bradhurst
That's where Bones live, walked in the buildin, staggerin
Lookin tore down, shot his door down and beat his whore down
From the look in my eye, he knew he would die
Started to cry, stuck the gat to his head and said, ""Why?""
Then he offered me, all of his cheese
Then dropped to his knees and begged me please not to squeeze
Then his brains got blast out, he's ass-out, then I dashed out
Into the streets covered with blood, about to pass out
The hospital's up, a couple of blocks, I'm on my way but
Damn, here comes a couple of cops; I pulled out
And started blowin they started blowin back I'm goin all out
I ain't holdin back, I been to jail once and I ain't goin back
I kept shootin, one shot caught a cop dead in his top
The other pig ducked behind a big truck
I was bleedin real bad, and couldn't stop it
But still had the fifty thou' profit in my pockets
The coast was clear, so I jetted to a park that was near
Seen kids playin everywhere then threw the cash in the air
I watched all of them, run for they share
And all I can do was stare
I got weak and fell on my rear
Now I can hear the sirens, that means here comes the Jakes
But it's too late, I'm knockin on the pearly gates
Yeah, casualties of a dice game
Never gamble with snakes
Let that be a lesson to ya
Yeah, it's Corleone y'all
Yeah, it's Flamboyant y'all

This for the corners, where them G's standing on (still grinding)

Blue and yellow appearal, I bang like a gavel
Have you around mo' shells, than a sand castle
I'm so sick, I belong to drama E.R
Got a lil' rock, and I don't mean Arkansas
Boys on the block, fronting like they getting loot
Just a class act, like Dancan Pendahue
I take your broad, and make her hide the crack in her tits
Officer don't rat, my hoe hook him up with clit
So think bright, take the word justice
Lit up between the T and the I, it's spells just ice
I melt through it, the law not above me
Rock-a-by baby, I'm pulling up like Huggins yeah
The grind I'm in, yeah they try to knock it
And take me out my crib, like Ellian Gonzalez
But I'm so solid, I'm hardcore thugging
F' the shot clock, we shoot after the buzzer
[Hook]

[Ill Tactics]
I hit I-10, then I spin and I spun
Riding shotgun, with Lil' Keke the Don
Purp in my lungs, trunk full of yay
It can't be scene, like Nadaline Halloway
Drop a order off, then I swerve in another state
Night time come, pull a dime then I fornicate
Fuck then wake up, before the mack swear house
Guessing what's next, inside of Sean Blaze loft
Looking out, from a balcony view
Got the city in my eyes, with my drumline crew
It's nothing, to be put to rest
And he ever snitch sleeping, like his alarm clock wasn't set
The strongest, came up from bony to chubby
To obese, from famously displaying my gully
You reach I'm so out of, you need mo' extension
Then try to boss up, I grind for the dollar partna

[Hook]

[Ill Tactics]
I rep that Beaumont, please do not stunt
Got a handheld throw away, you do not want
Scrilla on my mind, I ain't hesitant to get it
Let me go on hop into it, like a cricket
Zigging and zagging, dipping and dab it
Whipping up batches, pitch it to addicts
I G-R-I-N-D, for my family yeah
I'm street smart, so it all come in handy boy
Get low, grind shuffle on
Hit the flo', and grind shuffle on (grind homie grind)
Mean mugging, grind shuffle on

Jump in the crowd, grind shuffle on
Put your middle fingers up, and grind shuffle on (grind homie grind)

Notes of Def,Lakim Shabazz,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","(Okay budddy - start playin)

Hush-hush pooh-putts, I lay ya like sheet rock
He thought he'd rock me, what a peacock
You coconut creampuff cornpop
I'd get a million for my rhymes if I took em to a pawnshop
A musical menace, in awareness I make slammin hits
I got flavor more than a banana split
Prepare yourself for a hip-hop, a knock, a blast
A hitman for hire by the name of Lak Shabazz
I elevate till I raise the roof
Girls get naked and give me their bathing suits
Like a magnet I cling to the mic, I don't swing a knife
I'm like GE, I 'bring good things to life'
One of the chosen few holding you under siege
Wanna bleed, I treat you like weed and a fonto leaf
Roll ya, smoke ya, you should hold ya breath
I see smoke comin out your ears from the notes of def

It ain't nothin like ( ? ) listenin to a serious saxophone
That cracks the dome open wide
To a smooth sound, who's bound to do now
Not too many, I see a lot of them go and hide
The subject is that I must get
Hype, this is a chain, a connnection of ruffnecks
You're weak and not wise, you move counterclock-wise
You should know that I swat flies
The microphone gets clutched like a tourniquet
Gimme a scratch, watch me burn a bit
Yo, I hold information like a microchip
I'm rough and rugged, I might as well go head and flip
Into a lyrical round-off
All I hear in my ear is that they love the way it sounds off
The way I beat on a rap was quite brutal
I make em completely ineffective, futile
Rhymes I could rock, I'm in a good spot
I turn sell out crowds and pack em in like Woodstock
Been a long time since you heard a rhyme like mine
You're impatiently waiting for the punchline
But it won't come till I'm done, so beware, son
My vocals are deadly, most get scared and run
For reinforcements, I'll enforce this
Law of how to get raw, watch my force rip
Take a sip, the beats'll hit you
Here's a chance to dance, now may the force be with you
Rhymes are like kerosine
You ride my saddle, you wanna battle, you get creamed
You better quit I don't think you can deal with
I was made mentally, physically fit
To take heads, cold rip to shreads
Call on the coastguard, I rip the feds
45 King is in the effect mood
He'll produce and get loose with a correct groove
You need to back off, you can't hang with us
We're not dope, we're more like angel dust
The earth is mine, every square mile of it
Units of flavor, got piles of it
I drew my path for those that follow it
My impact is like that of a hollow tip
I'll arrange the style, don't change the dial
I'm refined with the rhyme that'll make you smile
Cee Just remain serious, no time to play
Stay still, nobody move, watch him display
Talents and techniques as I speak, the weak
Freak cause I'm sleak and unique
Horns are horny, the snare drum makes some retreat
Cee Just on the cut and the King's on the beat
My voice is choice from baritone to bassclef
And these are the notes of def"
The Voice of Power,Lakim Shabazz,"['hip hop', 'alternative', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Lakim Shabazz]
I come across louder than a bull horn, a full-born
Human ghetto blaster that has to move on
The voice of choice to pound the sound that Mark made
If you sleep, huh, you catch a heartache
Tweeters scream, woofers blow when I flow
Biters bite actin' like they didn't know
Rhymes I make take the cake, they have to be
Sweet like sugar, Strawberry D'Acquery
I'll dilute your brain like Mohawk
Brandy I'm dandy if you can't flow
Walk off the set, go and get
Reinforcements or new concepts
See if you can match the man that has to stand
Militant and armed, ready to cold bomb
Get in your stance, here's your chance
Now you're gettin' a blast from Lak Shabazz
The voice of power, the voice of power
I got the voice of power

[Verse 2: Lakim Shabazz]
See, I been waitin' to catch you, now I got you
I'ma mop you, make you walk the desert like Jacub
Greatest [?] and slob
Any negative thoughts? Yo, save it, hops
For the wack ones, I simply attack them
Do what I wanna do with 'em and ransack them
Gather your fortress, I run through y'all
You're nothin' but a bunch of knuckleheads, screwballs
This were a contest for money you wouldn't win a nickel
Your rhymes are too wack, you whimsical
My impact is that of a nuclear explosion
I'm unloadin', comin' through to ya
Loud and clear, proud to bear witness
To the fact that I'm packed with swiftness
Now what you gotta say for yourself?
You might as well pray for help
Rappers like you, I eat 'em and plow rhymes
When the dinner bell ring, it's chow time
I rush the stage, grab the mic and rock a party for hours
I got the voice of power
I got the voice of power
I got the voice of power
[Verse 3: Lakim Shabazz]
Rhythms I ride with ease to please a crowd
With lyrics that totally tower
When I was young I made a vow
That thou will always possess the voice of power
I kick science you're bein' dropped on
Gimme the mic, look at how the props swarm
And see the brother cold undertake
Gimme the cue, watch me stun the break
I'm gettin' fed up, you're so wack, dag
You're like roaches and I'm the blackflag
You little insect, I put heads out
Rappers check in, but they don't check out
You waste time, you should learn to make
Deffer rhymes so I don't have to exterminate
I wasn't made to be ruled by no one
And it ain't no fun if I don't get none
The voice of power longs for strong rhymes that penetrate
Listen as Lakim demonstrates
Vocals I flow styles, I like the track
I sound crisp and some whisper, ""How's he do that?""
5'4"" and a connaisseur, so step slow
While you intake a vision from a video
I'm known to rock a party for hours
I got the voice of power...
I got the voice of power

Ah yeah, Flavor Unit in effect
1990, Lakim Shabazz, all that
You know what I'm sayin?

Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga, but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyah""

Know that motherfucker, well, what you gon' do now?
Whatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So, mami, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ah, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship

And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, Ye, they can't stand besides me

Ah, ah!
I'm sittin' in the crib dreamin' about Lear jets and coupes
The way Salt shoops and how to sell records like Snoop (oops!)
I'm interrupted by a doorbell
3:52 - who the hell is this?
I gets up quick, cocks my shit
Stop the dogs from barkin', then proceed to walkin'
It's a face that I seen before
My nigga Sing, we used to sling on the 16th floor
Check it!
I look deeper; I see blood up on his sneakers
And his fist gripped a chrome four-fifth
So I dip
Nigga, is you creepin' or speakin'?
He tells me C-Rock just got hit up at the Beacon
I opens up the door, pitiful: ""Is he in critical?""
Retaliation for this one won't be minimal
'Cause I'm a criminal way before the rap shit
Bust the gat shit, Puff won't even know what happened

Precisely, so we know exactly what we facin'

Was braggin', about how much loot and crack he stackin'
Rock had a grip so they formed up a clique
A small crew, 'round the time I was locked up with you""

""But yo, nigga, let me proceed
Don't fill them clips too high
Give them bullets room to breathe
Damn, where was I? Yeah
Went outta town, blew the fuck up
D-Roc went home
And Jay got stuck the fuck up
Hit him twice, caught him right for the Persian white
Pistol whipped his kids and taped up his wife (niggas is trife)
He figured Rock set 'em up, no question
Wet 'em up no less
Than 50 shots in his direction"" (uhh)
""How many shots?""
""Man, nigga, I seen mad holes""
""What kinda gats?""
""Hitchlinks, Kochs, and Calicos""
But fuck that

Miss the nigga they want and murder innocent kids

Ain't no slugs gonna be wasted
Revenge I'm tastin' at the tip of my lips
I can't wait to fill my clip in his hips
""Pass the chocolate, Thai!""
Sing ain't lie
There's Jason with his back to me
Talkin' to his faculty

Put the mask on in case this nigga start squealin'
Scream his name out: (""Ay yo, playboy!"")

5th Dimension,B.o.B,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","[Intro: B.o.B & (Ricco Barrino)]
What's up, what's, down
Ladies and gentleman we are entering into the fifth dimension
And did I mention, we gone? Ha ha ha. We gone. We gone
(B.o.B, B.o.B, give it to 'em, shortie)

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Girl, I'm eons and eons beyond these peons
Another human like me there will never be one
The planet that I'm from, I can't even speak on
The stars is what I sleep on
The moon I put my feet on
The way my aura glow, you'd swear I'm made of neon
Cooler than the freon, that's in your Dodge Neon
They say the future is now, to me it hasn't begun
Stay tuned to me and their will never be a re-run
So come and leap on my body and as we come
You'll probably feel moist like the trees on the tropics
We gone, we out it, no we don't need rockets
We hop up on the mother ship an we gone, we slidin'
We slippin' through dimensions, we hyper space glidin'
Blastin' through the atmosphere
Frightenin' in the lightenin'
I know I'm out my mind girl, but you know you like it
So hope up on my cosmic highway so can ride it
[Hook: Ricco Barrino]
Shorty are you going, my way?
Come and ride on my, my cosmic highway
Ooh, let's go
Ooh, let's go
Look, shorty I can't stay on the Earth no more
Another galaxy we must go

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Well, fresh up out the sky I'm like a meteorite
So when the studio, no, I don't need to go write
Man I just came up in the game 'cause y'all just needed more life
So, so by the time I'm done their ain't gonna be no more mics
And people ask me, ""B.o.B what kind of language is that?""
'Cause I may blast into the future, I may never come back
And I'm a leave with a 30,000 light year leap
Headed to a distant planet called B.o.B
And then I'm gone
Man they not ignoring me
Taking off from half court Air Jordan
All systems go in 10 seconds I'm orbiting
Hanging in the Cosmos like a space ornament
Heat 'em up like a solar panel, yes I bring the pain
Similar to asteroid that's headed to your brain
My lane is something that they really cannot explain
They try to hold me down but man it's me they can't contain
[Hook: Ricco Barrino]
Shorty are you going, my way?
Come and ride on my, my cosmic highway
Ooh, let's go
Ooh, let's go
Look, shorty I can't stay on the Earth no more
Another galaxy we must go

[Bridge: Ricco Barrino]
Come and go with me, I'll take you to my galaxy
I'm talkin' 'bout Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Mars, Mars
And I'm sayin' girl, let's ride all night
And I need you for this ship girl to take flight
Let's go, let's go
Come on baby let me take it off
Another second we gone blast it off

[Hook: Ricco Barrino]
Shorty are you going, my way?
Come and ride on my, my cosmic highway
Ooh, let's go
Ooh, let's go
Look, shorty I can't stay on the Earth no more
Another galaxy we must go"

Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I’ll get a chance
To see you when I close my eyes
I’m going outta my head
Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hands and be my guide?
Clouds filled with stars, cover your skies
And I hope it rains, you’re the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this?

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don’t wanna wake up from you
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your loves to good to be true
My guilty pleasure I ain’t going no where
Baby long as you’re here
I’ll be floating on air cause you’re my
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don’t wanna wake up from you
[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, yo, Young Money right here
Bike here, throw it up, no high chair
Cold like a white bear
Freddy Krueger I'm a rap bitch nightmare
And I’m rich, I could buy you
Kill bitches, leave their body in the Bayou
More brain than a IQ
More head than a dread, my youte
And my bank account ain’t hardly empty
That’s why I come through in a Barbie Bentley
So please mamacita, please no envy
When you come around it reads no entry
Who’s next to go?
My flows so flexible
Get gas, then get at me, Texaco
Shoot yourself in the leg, Plaxico
White jag with the twisted lip
I ain't Mike Jack but ""This is it!""
B-b-b-boo I'm everywhere
You're like balloon boy, mama, you was never there!
I am the Kung Fu Panda
Fuck all your blogs, fuck all your propaganda
Good for the goose, then its good for the gander
Nicki ain't a rapper, Nicki is a brander
Please, you can never compare to me
All these bitches is scared of me
I am who they couldn’t even dare to be
So that's all folks, badabadee
I go hard, pause
Hospital flow, get more gauze
I'm a bad bitch on all fours
The President be like, ""It's all yours!""
Weezy and Nicki bring the A-game, high stats
Go together like Ricky and his eye patch
Go together like a team in the gym
Kareem and the ring, the queen and the king
[Bridge: Beyoncé & Lil Wayne]
Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death could make us part (No Ceilings!)
What kind of dream is this?
You could be a sweet--

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, kush it out, red bone, pussy, mouth
Eat you up, spit you out, fuck your girl in your house
I’m terrible, be careful, you might want say a prayer or two
So cold, I need theraflu, I'm so high, I need parachutes
I'm error proof, I'm never spooked, got my coupe, heaven blue
And my flag red as hell, think you're sweet as devils food
I never lose, my weapons use
Fuck with me wrong, shit get ugly, Devin Dude
And she’s the queen, two’s a couple, three’s a scene
Weezy that nigga that you see in your dreams, get the pussy wet, Abita Springs
Hah, I'm Easter clean, shout to my home girl, Mika Means
Anything we want we redeem, you niggas gassed up, ‘93 Supreme
Nicki Minaj is the hardest bitch, more than an artist, bitch
She talk a whole lot of shit and walk around like she President Carter's bitch
She be on her Barbie shit, and me? I'm on Tha Carter VI
And I can turn crumbs to bricks, and I can turn nuns to tricks
Hah, Young Mula baby, f-fuck your feelings
And this is No Ceilings, yeah
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don’t wanna wake up from you
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

Yeah, just a little bit
Just a little bit
And it goes...

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
Bought a big house and a whole lot of Ranges
A fresh new couch and a whole lot of trainers
A closet full of clothes and some brand new dangers
And, some Mexican floral arrangers
A great big TV that'll entertain us
Some colorful commissions from some high-paid painters
Someone to take the rap so that I stay stainless
And, a new relationship with a banker
And two pinky rings for my manicured fingers
A trained German Shepherd that bark when it's angered
To watch my possessions and look out for strangers
And, a fifty-foot yacht with an anchor
A young supermodel that shall remain nameless
Ups and the downs, the sames and the changes
All the money in the world don't make it painless, no
[Hook: Lupe Fiasco & Thom Yorke]
But they love it, and they love it, the more
The more you try to erase me

The more that I appear, oh
Ugh, and they love it, and they love it

Plain Pat, what up?
Ugh, ugh, lifestyles of the broke and famous
Let you know how crazy this game is
Look at all the new, beautiful faces
At home, supermodel Myspaces
Long for they shot on the TV screens
American Idol never seen these dreams
Just last week, they want to see ID
Now, they got you in V.I.P., huh?
How many people almost famous?
You almost remember what they name is
Like ""Hey, didn't you play in?
No, it couldn't be, quit playin'""
And tryna keep that balance after MTV
That's a Real World Challenge
Back on that train
Never to be heard from again

G-R-I-P, P-I-M-P
I, any spelling, bitch, come on, that's me
I bring a burning sensation to the urban eye
Like an eye-drop of turpentine
You can listen to the serpent, fine
But the earth got gas; once it burps, it's fine
Some around me, they talk about degrees
Not GHG, how to cook a quarter key (Ugh)
Talking all nasal, he ain't over that cold
No glove, scrub, man, he just over that stove
Perfect paradigm, wrong place, wrong time
Should have been Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline
Number one chemist, look at him, no blemish
Eggshell off-white like a DuPont finish
Young, dumb, high-strung, who could handle us?
I wonder how God's gon' paint todays canvases
'Cause who knew that day that man would just
Go to V.A. with a Tec and spray campuses?
What a way to see the cover of Time
I know that nigga wish he was standing in line

What a world that I'm living in
Will the rainstorms ever end?
(Still I feel my) Path narrow, I run again
Seem happiness is gone again
(And then you see 'em) Grey clouds up above mayne
Metaphoric to my life mayne
(Still I feel my) Heart stronger than it's ever been
Strong will 'til my journey ends
(Until then I roll) More than I ever rolled
Not pills, but the Mary though
(Still I feel my) Eyes heavy when the day goes
Nothing helping when my head doze
(But I ain't sleep) Awake in another state
Living in a new space
(Still I feel my) Mind running at a steady pace
God help me so I'll win the race

Grey clouds stuck together fam
Lightning piercing through another land
Over the desert where the lost play
Soul searching each and every way
(And then you see the) Awesome sound, so profound
When it– it'll grip you
(You can see it) If you hear it you can feel it too
Something special I am running to
(Until then I go) Away, very far away
To another universe where all the people say
It's the new-new place for the special to embrace
Like a Martian who seemingly wandered out of place
Take what you need from the valley of the hope, where
Even if you drown you'll be floating higher up, and
You can say bye, bye, bye
Sky might be falling but remember you can fly high

Four records deep, and I still get stage fright

How's about burned at the stake

He still bent both ways, ain't no due process
For boys that become guls or verse vica
Field niggas control this
Pin the hollow point tip

If you don't like what I say, fly away, fly away

Check this out, bust it
This is like a rocket, you never packed
This many condominiums in your pocket
Ughn, you never smoked this much weed before
Where else can these niggas go
Don't know tomorrow, it's about today, bruh
I want some coochie that I ain't gotta pay for
I'm the one that holidayed ya
ATL, land where we par-laya
No nigga jealous with his gat wanna clown
It's enough females in the streets to go round two, three times
Atlanta, the doctor's home
Always somebody hoggin the payphone
Say homes, where your daughter
She'll tell ya I'm pure like Artesian water
Feed me a quarter like a jukebox
I sell rhymes like rocks, the police oughta stop checkin
The Lord gave me a blessing
Long as rocks I sees with you
Think the Lord pleased with you
Ughn, you think he kissed you
You think he kissed you
Or he dissed you

Suits of brutality patrol sectors
Day care centers ran by vestors
Drunk drivers behind the steering wheel of liquor trucks
New comers think they won the diversion on pure luck
Shark pools in the hall, one drop can start a frenzy
Feeding off of your ignorance of the law consider no excuse
We here by being careful, vigilence
Vampires ??? lace personal pants with blood
Just ask for the special
Crackers crave samples of niggas urine
Strands of hair and semen
Blue lights in the basements
Having conversations with voices between four by fours
Rack 'em up, I'll bust your head
Stay playing the role of executioner, been years on death row
Now he don't wanna die for arranging his wife's murder
Equal opportunity, designated bullets don't discriminate
Like unemployment, officers doing break
Y'all done stepped on we, the green green
One deep in this team
Y'all done stepped on we, the green green

Poetry deep in the team
Y'all done stepped on we, the green green

Belligerent thoughts of militant ways
Camouflaged in the brush, love or lust
Which can we trust hidden in the cuts
Terr-i-ble they bounce 'em every third month
Yeah, after the big flood of truth
Caught in your own evidence
Now you hesitant to believe me
You back to hangin with Parks
That's what you called her
Now you run cause you know that's what you want
(What you want, what you want)
If I felt like everything was good
Maybe then I could knock on wood
To protect the good
That surrounds my innermost thoughts
Until my thoughts were caught unguarded
As hard as it is to be perfect I try
And I still flaw listening to the next guy
That knew more and saw it before I did
Came up big, to dig an early grave
Get locked up, and turn a slave for the rhythm
We rap, still get slapped by the system
[Chorus]
Poetry deep in the team
Y'all done stepped on we, the green green
Yeah, Poetry deep in the team
Y'all done stepped on we, the green green

How do you feel when you judge quick
And you all up in my face and I ain't even spit?
Just like them folk that say they know me from my old days
I know you wonderin' about my spirit and my old ways!
You hearin' me spittin' the piece of mind, got you froze in time
Playin' catch-up with yourself
I'm on another level, and you can say I'm dead wrong
Even if you stay home
They gotta fight because you livin' in a war zone
Head strong
Can't leave it 'lone till they get and they gone
So now I'm stylin', my momma 'bout to travelin'
He be hangin' with them monsters and they smilin
And my babies' coughin', thinkin' they have TB
And they neva call him daily in that wee-wee
So what I find is to eliminate the problem
Befo' they cause problems
Befo' we have problems
Cause you thought you had it sewed up
Until that green house grew all of a sudden
Sho' nuff, it showed up
Now you didn't know he had it in him
The venom
It fits the test and I'm gon (win) him
Then the ride, can't be cryin' got it steady now
You need to find out, there ain't no time-outs
You can't sign-out, better let it whine out
Don't drop the gun cause the street is gettin' packed now
Just let cones bang the ground, don't you back down!
For it's the fate, that brought you to this place now
So let it guide you and take you to that touch-down
And stay ground, so that you can stay proud
Cause one in, and one quick

You preach that real shit 'till you can't doubt no mo'
Now wait a minute y'all, I am the one
That ride the rhythm from midnight to the morning sun
I do it for the freedom, finance, and forever fun
Now revolution of the mind has already begun
Now just a second y'all
It got to be
For every thought is fulfilled in the prophecy
I'm supernatural and there is no stoppin' me

Even the ghetto is still God's property!
C'mon

Ever since you was a youngster the devil been
Over your soul, like this one-eyed monster
Ain't no in between you either off or on
Never pass judgement
But the feeling is mutual
Pass the hog mog, tryin' to drown me
After years of gravel
You promised no rest to (blow) in weeks
I know you ain't choppin' in the next man footprints
Wobblin' like a duck
Stuck, crawlin' out the same hole
Me don't promote no mysterious behavior
(Pimped) and be dead
I used to flow, my high school goal
It come through in the ghetto!

He put his boots on
He took a face from the ancient gallery
And he walked on down the hall
He went into the room where his sister lived, and then he
Paid a visit to his brother, and then he

In Between Us,Scarface,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Nas]
Circumstances are like my first fight I lost
It was swinging, my arms bugging, adrenaline pumping
Oh shit, this little nigga's thugging
I mean, I was thirteen, I was nursing a knot on my face
But chose another time and a place
That I would avenge my last fight cuz the same shit
Ain't gonna happen that just happened last night
Knuckle game changed quicker than lightning
Hit 'em or slice 'em
Either stick 'em or blast pipes, it's the fastlife
I try to give another nigga advice, shoot dice
Do plenty of shit cause this life, how many you get?
How many niggas do you know get two?
Besides a nigga who snitch to skip a life-bid, be one a' your crew
I don't respect killers, I respect O.G. knowledge
Codes of the streets got new rules, but no guidance
Lessons, detrimental to a young disciple
Focus, take care of your brothers, niggas do as I do
Keep your enemies close, where they can see you
It's not your enemy who get you
It's always your own people

It's always your own people
It's always your own people
It's always your own people

Mass confusion, in my head
Killing me, driving me mad
Got me wondering, can I trust my friends?
Cuz they stick me in my back every chance they get
Am I paranoid? and if that's the case
Is it curable? Can you help me find my place?
I can't handle this, I'm losing it
With a loose grip I'm hanging on to emptiness
Help your brother, save him from the
Evil demons in between us, came between us

[Verse 2: Scarface]
I know you hate me, don't you
I bet you sit and wish my time never came
You probably rather see me die in the game
You probably rather see me die in a plane
Well ya'll see me up on top of my dough
I get my money shit changed
And niggas start looking at me different than this
And downplay the real nigga shit to get with a bitch
But I'mma tell a motherfucker like this
You only good as what you come up against
Nigga you get what you get
Sure the grass is greener on the other side of the fence
But any attempts and you gonna need the guy in the trench
I'ma starter while you riding the bench
You saying you a player, well I'm the one designing your prints
Something to go by, to let these niggas know I
Don't believe in letting shit slide, nigga gonna die
Best friends since high school seniors
With a homeboys demeanor
But let the bullshit come between us

Got me wondering, can I trust my friends?
Cuz they stick me in my back every chance they get

Visual visual, JB
Yo, Ye, what up? Raekwon

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
You got stacks like the International House of Pancakes
All alone, ready to phone me and your hand shakes
Palms is wet, a don's regret
Never to walk miles for love, I sit in the starter's deck
It just happened, I was floatin', you seen the captain?
Blinked at me then I threw him my thinking cap
Take her, then we could slide to Jamaica
Shop for like a year or two, stop in Diego
It's obvious, I want to see who your mami is
We just friends so she can't Clyde, Bonnie this
Fly walls, dinin' in fly halls
Come to the master suite, leave every piece in the master hall
All my money tied in knots
Stand over there, that's why I make it happen on blocks
Brazil cut sweater, Audi leather
Playin' the field, tryin' to out-slick Baretta
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
You see my baby up and hit the road
Where she's going? That's what nobody knows
I need to find her 'fore another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm just tryna be cool, cool, cool
Tryna be cool, what you expect me to do?
I'm just tryna find, find, find this sweet love of mine

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Last name West and my teeth diamonds
She said, ""Yo, what's your occupation, crazy rhymin'?""
Listen to Wu-Tang, tryin' suits on
Accoutrements is Grey Poupon
Stuntin' in a high-top Louis, shorts is the Coogis
Open up the door when you take her to the movies
When you meet the parents, you tell De Niro
Her boyfriend a zero, she need to cut the weirdo
Next show, they gotta up the zeros
Nobody rockin' like this sixteen years old
The hard drums and the Wally's somethin' that caught me
I'm tellin' you what Wu-Tang taught me
The young youth, rockin' the gold tooth
Pull up in a drop top, old school bumpin' to ""Cash Rules""
No question, we the reason why the summer's blazin'
Then say, ""You lookin' good, fly colored Asian""
Raw, I give it to ya, no trivia
She used to roll with my G-Unit like Olivia
'Til she caught me gettin' numbers and hugs
I guess that's the day she became a runaway love
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
Why can't I find you, love of mine
When you're standing in front of my face?
Oh why, I must be blind?
How did I let you get away?
Hahah, yeah

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Leave it up to the most high, sittin' in ghost fly
Chillin' with two of my brothers
We both live on deck, baggin' 'em on set
This is how we roll independent, she a go, I'ma go get
Take that queen or shorty up
We can live it up every month, baby girl, just call me up
Wakin' up, restin' in cold sweats
Thinkin' of this ****, the videotapes, even the stress
My mind is a terrible thing to waste
No love lost, I know I'm goin' crazy, I can't floss
Me, my lady, left my homies, it's all baloney
Just like rockin' the old Ponys
So when I'm chillin', I'm just lost, no more feelin'
I need my honey in my life, get that? Feel me?
Take your time, Rae, Justin, yeah, you shine
My runaway love didn't mind, come on
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?

Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright, stop, pajama time

[Verse 1]
Come here, little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean ""rap"" as in a new case
Of child molestation accusations
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything but little boys
And that's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung-hole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little poot-poot, it's okay
Oops, my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

Just to party all the way 'til Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I don't know what day
Every day's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kinda breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin', all I know is
When I get there someone's gonna touch my body

[Verse 2]
'Scuse me, miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair?
Spit on me? Maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)
Now, what's your name, girl? What's your sign?
Man, you must be up out your mind
Dre (Ah-ah), beer goggles, blind

Down the street screamin' (Ah-ah-ah-ah)

All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said, ""Save it, boy, we got you on tape""
Yellin' at an old lady to touch my body

Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality look, it's B. Rabbit
Yo, you signed me up to battle? I'm a grown man

Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous (What?)
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm calling all girls

Butt squeezin', it's the season

No assistance just that persistence with that commitment if
I don't get it, somebody gon' die tonight
I know my vibe is tight and I deserve the throne
And if the kid ain't right, then let me die in this song
See, I be ridin', just ridin' alone
With my daddy on my mind like, ""You gotta be kidding""
How the hell you ain't here to see your prince do his thing?
Sometimes I wanna drop a tear, but no emotions from a king

Bulletproof, leave a nigga with a bullet-roof
Shoot ya in your mouth, Leroy, they call him bullet-tooth

There's a full court pressure, I'm just goin' for the two
If I'm open for the three, I'ma take it in a second
Even if there's one second, I'ma make it, it's nothin'

And I promise if you try me, he gon' have to rewind this track
And make me go back, that thing'll go rrat
That boy'll lay flat, so flat
That act is what I perform amongst you haters
Got nina in my palm and I'm masturbating
Black Peter Pan, fly 'til I die, what you sayin'?
Bathing Ape, Yves Saint, Evisu what I stay in
Got me feeling like Scarface, light the Cohiba
Streets reply I look right in a four-seater
You know I be out here right in a four-seater
Top floor of the Four Seasons
Four of them whores
And they all know how to cook it up
And look I got some
And only one know how to bag, bitch, bundle up
See, it's a cold world, so homie, bundle up
We ain't on this grind for nothin', now get your hustle up
[Chorus]
Baby, you gotta know that I'm just out here
Doin' what I gotta do for me and you, and we eatin'
So, bitch, why the fuck is you tripping?
I'm takin' these chances
My head to the sky, my feet on the ground
My fingers to the judge, if the money don't move
Then I won't budge, won't budge
No, I won't budge, no, Lord
Baby, you gotta know that I'm just out here
Doin' what I gotta do for me and you, and we eatin'
So, bitch, why the fuck is you tripping?
I'm takin' these chances
My head to the sky, my feet on the ground
My fingers to the judge, if the money don't move
Then I won't budge, won't budge
No, I won't budge, no, Lord

[Outro]
Man, man, this be that hustler music
Young Weezy got that motherfuckin' hustler music, y'all
So ride to it, y'all, and vibe to it, y'all
I'm asking y'all, please, please
Young Weezy got that hustler music
Young Weezy got that motherfuckin' hustler music
Ride to it, y'all, vibe to it, y'all, vibe to it y'all, yeah, yeah, woo
It's real shit, man, it's real talk, man
It's how we do it, how we did it, how we done it, ayy
It's real shit, man, it's real talk, boy
It's how we do it, how we did it, how we done it
I ain't braggin', I ain't boastin', it's the way it go
I ain't braggin', I ain't boastin', it's the way it is
Better guard your kids, guard your face
Better guard your body, we warned the place
We here
Fuck bitches, it's Young Money, nigga"
Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It,Ice Cube,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
- Prior to gangsta rap music, the world was a peaceful place. And then all of that changed: violence, rape, murder, arson, theft, war. These are all things that came about as a result of gangsta rap music- But wasn't Compton dangerous before gangsta rap ?
- Wrong! Compton was a nature preserve for bunny rabbits. When gangsta rap came along, they tore down the country clubs and put up housing projects!

(Maestro!!!) Blame me!
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
It's R-A-W, R-A-W

[Verse 1]
You lookin' at the grand wizard
Warlord, vocal chord so vicious
And I don't have to show riches
To pull up, pull off with some bad bitches
And it ain't about chivalry
It's about dope lyrics and delivery
It's about my persona
Ain't nothin' like a man that can do what he wanna
Ain't nothin' like a man that you knew on the corner
See 'em come up and fuck up the owner
See 'em throw up Westside California
Nigga, I'm hot as Phoenix, Arizona
I'm Utah: I got multiple bitches
It's a new law, keep a hold of your riches
Dumb nigga, don't spend it as soon as you get it
And recognize I'm a captain and you a lieutenant
[Hook 1]
I can say what I want to say
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
I can act like an animal
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I eat you like a cannibal
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it

[Verse 2]
I'm raw as a dirty needle
Choke an eagle, just to feed all my people
Lyrically I'm so lethal
Plant thoughts in they mind just to defeat you
Ice Cube is a saga
Y'all spit saliva, and I spit lava
I got the fearless flow
Don't get near this, ho, if you scared to go
I keep it gangsta, and why should I change that?
Fuck you old mothafuckas tryin' to change rap
But ain't you the same cat
That sat back when they brought cocaine back?
I'm tryin' to get me a Maybach
How you mothafuckas gonna tell me ""don't say that""?
You the ones that we learned it from
I heard nigga back in 1971
[Hook 2]
So if I act like a pimp
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nappy-headed ho
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I shoot up your college
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I rob you of knowledge
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it

[Verse 3]
Thank God when I bless the mic
You finally get to hear the shit that you like
A nigga talkin' about real life
So you can try to get this shit right
Use your brain, not your back
Use your brain, not a gat; it's a party, not a jack
Don't be scared of them people
Walk up in there and show them that you equal
And don't be material
A nigga grew up on milk and cereal
I never forgot Van Ness and imperial
Look at my life, Ice Cube is a miracle
It could be you if you was this lyrical
It could be her if she was this spiritual
‘Cause me and Allah go back like cronies
I ain't gotta be fake, ‘cause he is my homie
[Hook 3]
If I sell a little crack
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I die in Iraq
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I take you for granted
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I fuck up the planet
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it

[Bridge]
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow-flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
It's R-A-W, R-A-W

[Outro]
Oh yeah, and another thing
For all y'all niggas that don't do gangsta rap
Don't get on TV talkin' about gangsta rap
‘Cause 9 times out of 10
You don't know the fuck you talkin' about
Talk about that bullshit rap you do
Stay the fuck out of mine"

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
1970 something, nigga I don't sweat the date
My moms is late so I had to plan my escape
Out the skins, in this world of fly girls
Tanqueray and Hennessy until I call hurl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck?
I wish moms would hurry up so I could get buck
Wild juvenile ripping mics and shit
New York, New York, ready for the likes of this
Then came the worst date, May 21st
2:19, that's when my mama water burst
No spouse in the house so she rode for self
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck
I'm seeing my death and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringing mad joy
The doctor looked and said, ""He's going to be a bad boy""
[Chorus: Diana King]
Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Now I'm thirteen, smoking blunts, making cream
On the drug scene, fuck a football team
Risking ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearing the coach scream ain't my lifetime dream
I mean, I want to blow up, stack my dough up
So school I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up
Mom said that I should grow up and check myself
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf? Nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, King of New York, I want to be it
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated, kinda scary
C74-Mark 8 set me straight
Not able to move behind the great steel gate
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?
All the money I stacked was all the money for bail

[Chorus: Diana King]
Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend
Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Ninety-four, now I explore new horizons
Mama smile when she see me, that's surprising
Honeys is tantalizing, they freak all night
Keep ducking cops on the creep all night
As I open my eyes and realizing I changed
Not the same deranged child stuck up in the game
And to my niggas living street life
Learn to treat life to the best, put stress to rest
Still tote your vest man, niggas be tripping
In the streets without a gat? Nah, nigga you're slipping
If I'm dipping on The F with weed on my breath
Original hustler with the muffler on the TEC
Respect to the macks in the Ac's
To the freaks in the Jeeps, lick shots to my peeps

Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend

50 Barz,Chris Webby,['hip hop'],"Yea, this is where I show you how nice I am. 50 bars

I rip up the mic dirty, battle anybody who's worthy
The only player out with a CT jersey
You see me, heard me, felt me, purely
The sickest on the earth, ain't no shit to cure me
I am surely, a rhyme busta, fuck ya
If you go against the kid then I'll have to crush ya
Knock you down like a gust of wind if fists touch ya
Cause I always stay on my grind like Chad Muska
Take that suckas, hit em with brass knucks
And kick em with Tims on and fuck that ass up
I eat em like Pac Man, the score just adds up
Should be in a trash can, shit I'm grouchy as fuck, yup
I'll wrap my hands around your neck and choke ya
Shock ten thousand volts, Zeus lightnin' bolt ya
So keep your courage close if I go and approach ya
Cause I'm here to ""Face Off"" like Nick Cage and Travolta
Spit molten flows that shatter your chest
Leave you with a broken nose for a lack of respect
So please son, if you really wanna battle the best
I'll put your fuckin' life in ""Jeopardy"" like Alex Trebek, yes
I'm not your average vet, blastin' a TEC
I'll ravage your set, beat you up like masochist sex
I never met another rapper of my caliber yet
But them beatin' me is like me passin' an Algebra test
I be flippin' like a calender, lyrics be scorchin' em
Rap valedictorian, swingin', stingin' like scorpions
Skin whiter than porcelain, but bringin' them dark forces in
Sick like the shit they caught on the Trail to Oregon
I'm talkin' Cholera, Scarlet Fever, and Dysentery
It's scary, you'd swear to god I memorized the dictionary
I'm buyin' if the ""Price is Right"" with Drew Carey
Fairly out of my mind got you runnin' like Tom and Jerry
I am very mentally nuts, spit with quickness
Step to a bitch like baseball, designated to hit this
Got your head spinnin' like kickflips, when I rip this
Hardbody like my flows lift weights at Planet Fitness
You can't get with this shit Chris spit I'm this sick hit piff
Till I'm flyin' through the air quick as a discus
You simply can't dismiss this, ready to go the distance
In the booth feelin' like a fuckin' kid on Christmas
This is, me back and fresh as can be
Hell I got more kicks than the UFC
More kicks than Jet Li, or Tekken 3
I'm nice, anybody I've ever met could agree
Could it be? The dude who's droppin' analogies
Hustlin' to make a salary, and burnin' opponents quick as a calorie
I will glad-a-ly, charge up the battery
And swing with a bat and see if I can knock your ass straight out the galaxy
Fact not fallacy, I rapidly drop shit
Pilot in the cock pit and sure as a clock ticks
I'll be here throwin' more fists than a mosh pit
50 bars later and I'm still spittin' hot shit
Yea bitch, I'm nice!"

MC Ren: Yeah, you know it
Eazy-E: Let's go do this shit, man, I got it all planned out
MC Ren: Yeah, shoot any motherfucker that moves

[Sample]
Alright everybody

[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
This is a stick-up, everybody get face-down
Ren, gag their mouths so they can't make a sound
Tie em up for the fact that I'm kickin ass
I got my hand on my gat, and I'm tempted to blast
My name is Eazy, but I go the hard way out
This ain't personal, but now I'm about
To commit a crime and go through it
You know what, no need for shaking, because I'm used to it
Take out the security guard with a slap of my hand
Yeah, he's wearing a badge, but he's a old ass man
Pop his ass in the head, and take his gun
So me and the punk can go one on one
Cover the lens on the TV screen
You know so me and my gang, just can't be seen
Lock the doors, and throw away the key
Close the blinds, so no motherfuckers could see
And smile, you know, cause I'm controling of the shit
And no sucker ass nigga's gonna stop the hit
Wardrobes and locs, and a Ruthless shirt
That means I'm ready to work, and rush a fool to the dirt, so

Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt

Alright, anybody move and I'll blow your fucking head off

[Verse 2: Eazy-E]
Alright, empty your pockets, but do it slow
Take everything you got and lay it on the fucking floor
Don't make me have to set an example today
And blow one of you crazy motherfuckers away
I'm in a bank, and it's a little bit funny
Taking all you stupid motherfuckers' money
Peepin' at a bitch 'cause my dick's on hard
Laughing at the dumbass security guard
Who's tied up for the moment, not saying a word
I should have known it before, the motherfucker's a nerd
But back to the bitches I'm peepin'
And then untie the hoe, so I can start creepin'
Took her to the backroom, about to jack
Cold trailed the bitch, with a gun in her back
I said: ""Lay down, and unbutton your bra!""
There was the biggest titties that a nigga ever saw
I said: ""Damn!"" then the air got thinner
Only thought in my mind, was going up in her
The suspense was making me sick
She took her panties down and the bitch had a dick!
I said: ""Damn!"" dropped the gat from my hand
(What I thought was a bitch, was nothing but a man)
Put the gat to his legs, all the way up his skirt
Because this is one faggot that I had to hurt, so
[Hook]
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt

(I said get down. I want you all face-down on the floor
Anybody moves and I shoot)

[Verse 3: Eazy-E &  MC Ren ]
Stacking up the money and there's more to collect
Cause I don't give a fuck, I take traveller's cheques
Yo, Ren, peep out the window, and tell me what you see
Three motherfucking police staring at me; what to do now?
Hurry up and get armed
Alright, tell me, who hit the motherfucking alarm?
I'mma give ya a chance, and count to three
Or else five of y'all bitches are comin with me
(Alright, Alright, come on out niggas, or we're coming in
This is the only chance to turn yourself in)
Fuck you, we got hostages, and plenty of loot
And don't give a damn and not afraid to shoot
We're sending out the hostages, all except five
And if you don't meet our demands, they won't stay alive
We want a copter, so we can get away clean
And take some pussy along, if you know what I mean
One hostage got brave, and got off the floor
But I smoked his ass before he got to the door
(They shot a hostage, they shot a hostage)
You stupid motherfucker trying to run
Now you're dead as fuck trying to race a gun
(Alright, this is the last chance to get off your ass
Or else the tear gas is about to blast)
I ran to the back and Ren followed behind
To a hell of a spot that was hard to find
The bank was fucked up, the shit was smokin'
With screamin hostages, running and chokin'
Gettin away, but I was suddenly stopped
At point blank range, by a motherfucking cop
And I hope they don't think that a lesson was taught
Cause a nigga like the E was finally caught
My gat wouldn't fire, the shit wouldn't work
So, y'all know what time it is
[Hook]
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt

And this is based off, flow

Luring you closer and closer away

Every thought you walk through the trails is hell
Airborne for one

Well I woke up this mornin with the same frustration from situations like these
Got a call about some work from one of them temporary agencies
No high school diploma or any college degrees
I can't enlist but they'll draft me if there's a war overseas
Oh please
Of course I can slice some OZs
But see I'm one of those aspirin MCs
And uh bills are due so at times I'm doubtful and everyone disagrees
But I'd rather struggle on my feet than to live on my knees
So my uniform tight workin all night at Mickey D's
Got about 90 dollars and some change after the government
Get they fees
These minimum wages ain't enough to feed my babies
Purposely these limitations on black folks opportunities
So I quit cuz I'm tired of being one of those overworked
Underpaid employees
Stop carin at all went on and did a few small burglaries
It seems like my faith done turned into forgotten memories
And I ain't gettin away with nothing because I know He always sees
But see right now I need to see how I can get this here dope sold
I done stuffed in my pocket as many rocks as it can hold
They gonna get high so I'm gonna get my money even though it's freezin cold
Now how many times you done heard this story told?
Believe it or not, there's some very intelligent junkies
But dependencies is eating away at they souls like disease
Anyone can turn into somebody who covets and envies
Unequal economics can easily make you some enemies
And the crime rate never drops so the cops ride around in threes
I knew he would have killed me if I did anything but freeze
They found the rest of the dope in some nearby shrubberies
In a dimlit room being questioned by these authorities
And they gave me some time in correctional facilities
And now my woman's gotta take on a man's responsibilities"

A thousand points of light, right?
The glare is bright and there's still no sight
Remember 83 in Panama?
A tip and trip from the drug czar
Summit with Bush and Noriega
Classic Coke is what they gave ya
Fly em in via CIA
Chumped from up above as they say
Start a war, yo, what the hell for?
Take him out, he won't talk no more
What I'm stating is incriminating evidence
Imprison the President

Imprison the President
Incarcerate the Congress
Levitate the Pentagon

Imprison the President
Incarcerate the Congress
Levitate the Pentagon

[ VERSE 3: Laquan ]
I diss, dismiss what I choose to lose
The attitude is funk it while I'm swingin the blues
Self-worth ain't worth shit
While I'm starin down a big black federal pit
You know Reagan can break the law
Live another day to make a score
Phony cronies steal from HUD
Iran-Contra, political mud
Who can respect the legal system
When any Senator can put the fix in
Every Congressman gets his licks in
And in the White House still sits Dick Nixon
Flase prophets and demagogues
Living large while the people starve
Famous speeches can't do jack
When down the block you're under attack
Preach hatred, preach salvation
Fifteen secs, a media sensation
Go ahead, juice the poets of revolution
Now's the time for some hard solutions
So many answers lie in yourself
So don't go following someone else
Learn and teach your own damn evidence
Imprison the President
Imprison the President

Incarcerate the Congress

Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one
Representing BK to the fullest
Gats, I pull it
Bastards ducking when B.I.G. be bucking
Chickenheads be clucking, in my back room fucking
It ain't nothing
They know B.I.G. be handling
With the MAC in the Ac' door paneling
Bandaging MC's, oxygen, they can't breathe
Mad tricks up the sleeve
Wear boxers so my dick can breathe
Breeze through in the Q
Forty-five by my side, lyrical high
And those that rushes my clutches get put on crutches
Get smoked like Dutches from the master
Hate to blast ya but I have to
You see I smoke a lot
Your life is played out like Kwame

That's that ""Oh I, thought he was wack""
Oh, come, come now, why y'all so dumb now
Hunt me or be hunted
I got three hundred and fifty-seven ways
To simmer sauté, I'm the winner all day
Lights get dimmer down Biggie's hallway

Bite my tongue for no one

Leave no witnesses, what you think this is?
Ain't no amateurs here

They too near not to hear me
Clearly, I'm the triple beam dream
One thousand grams of uncut to the gut
It seems fucked up, the way I touched up the grill
Trying to play gorilla when you ain't no killer
The gat's by your liver, your upper lip quiver
Get ready to die, tell God I said hi

My 1st Single,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'alternative']","[Intro]
Oh! Yeah! So much for first single on this one

[Verse 1]
Shady's the label, Aftermath is the stable
That the horses come out of—erra
Of course we're about to stir up
Some shit thick as Mrs. Buttersworth's syrup
It's the Mr. Picked-on-Christopher-Reeves-just-for-no-reason
Other than to—just to tease him
'Cause he was his biggest (*burp*) fan
He used to be Superman, now I'm pourin'
Liquor on the curb in his name for him
""Eminem, you wait 'til we meet up again, fucker
I'm kickin' your ass for everything you've ever said.""
It goes one for the money, two for the fuckin' show
Ready, get set, let's go
Here comes the buckin' bronco
Stompin' and stampedin' up the damn street like them buffalo
Soldiers, I told ya I'm 'bout to blow, so look out below, Geronimo
Motherfuckers, it's dominoes, I'm on a roll
Around and around I go
When will I stop? I don't know
Tryin' to pick up where The Eminem Show left off
But I know anything's possible
Though I'm not gonna top what I sold
I'm at the top of my game, that shit is not gonna change
Long as I got Dr. Dre on my team I'll get away
With murder: I'm like O.J., he's like my Cochran today
We keep the Mark Fuhrman tapes
In a safe, locked 'em away (*slam*)
Better watch what you say
Just when you thought you were safe
Them fuckers got you on tape
You swear to God you was playin'
Whether or not you was little Joshua
Gosh, I wish I could've told you to not do the same
'Cause one day it could cost you your name
[Chorus]
And this was supposed to be my first single (*burp*)
But I just fucked that up, so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle (*burp*)
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle (*fart*)
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle (*fart*)
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-no, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh-oh-ah-ah
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, poo-poo-ka-ka

[Verse 2]
Eri-Eri-Erick swallowed some generic sleeping pills
And woke up in bed next to his best friend Derrick, bare-naked
Jig-a-jig-ji-ji-Janean just turned 16 and used a fake ID
To sneak in V.I.P. to see R. Kelly
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee to be so young and naïve
Oh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and carefree
Paris and Nicky's parents must be so tickled, they cherish
Every picture with their kids with hickeys all over their necks
Hickory-dickory Dirk Diggler, look at me work wizardry
With these words – am I a jerk or just jerk chicken?
Or chiga-chigga-chig-chig-jer-chig-jer jerkin' your chain
Twenty-two jerks in a jerk circle, or is it a circle jerk?
Wait a minute, what am I sayin'? Allow me to run it back
And rewind it {blblblblblblblb} – wait, let me ask you again
Am I just jerkin' your chain? Am I berserk or insane?
Or am I just one of them damn amateurs workin' the dang
Cameras, filmin' one of them Paris Hilton homemade
Pornos, who keeps tiltin' the lens at an angle
Jigga-ji-just recently somebody just discovered
Britney and Justin videotapes of 'em fuckin'
When they was just Mouseketeers in the Mickey Mouse Club
And dusted 'em and went straight to The Source with 'em
'Cause they could've sworn someone said, ""Ni—""
And then tried to erase and record over it
But if you listen close enough to it you can hear the
""Ga-hu"" and then they come to
Find out it was Justin sayin', ""I'm gon—nuh cum!""

And this was supposed to be. my first single (*burp*)

Oh, ah, erra, poo-poo-ka-ka

[Verse 3]
Any opinions or somethin' you just wanna get off your chest
And address it about my lyrics I'd love to hear it
All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
It's 1-800-I'M-A-DICK-SUCKER-I'D-LOVE-TO-SUCK-A-DICK
And if someone picks up
You can talk all the shit you want about me
Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key
And I'll be sure to get back as soon as there comes a day
That I fall out with Dre, wake up gay and make up with Ray (hey!)
So fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken, beat a chicken
Eat a chicken like it's a big cock, big-a-big-cock!
Or suck a dick, and lick a dick, and eat a dick, and stick a dick in your mouth
I'm done, you can fuck off, fuck-a-fuck-off!
[Chorus]
And this was supposed to be my first single (*burp*)
But I just fucked that up, so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle (*burp*)
Slap a bitch and smack a ho

And I never say never but I mean hardly ever
And if shootin's the solution then you're not that clever
If you don't know shit then you still know better
Human life is so precious it could never be measured
Have you ever had it loaded and cocked back the heat?
Plottin' on the next nigga while he walkin' up the street
Trigger off safety spacin an opportunity

But he just posted up like he was waitin' on the bus

Used to walk with a gun but I never did use it

But these days you can't tell but I figured what the hell
So we yell out: ""Hey girl,"" they yell back
Maybe two in the front maybe two in the back
But they had this dark tint, couldn't see through the black
We roll up on 'em ask 'em ""where the party at?""
They just start to laugh and I knew it was a trap
But I couldn't roll out cause the strip was so packed
Now I'm lookin' at this nigga in his *red* and *white* hat
Start talkin' that *blood* shit like we was on some *cuz* shit
My nigga used to bang but we ain't on no thug shit
I tried to dismantle it but you know Los Angeles
This nigga kept talkin' so my boy had to handle it
He jumped out the lac snatched the dude out his hat
I put it in park jumped out to get his back
But as I did that, I heard two shots
I turned to my right and I see my dude drop
Time stopped. Couldn't believe what I seen
Was struck by reality when the two girls screamed
I saw his killer stand up he put the gun in his jeans
Saw him wince from the pain as the heat burned his waist
Then he turned up the block; disappeared without a trace
I remember his face but what I remember most
Was when I got to my knees and I held my nigga close
And asked not to leave us in the name of Christ Jesus
But he's gone and all I got left is his blood on my sneakers
[Bridge]
It was a year to this day that my best friend died
For weeks I sat alone in my room and cried
And I tried to pretend everything was fine
But my soul couldn't rest until vengeance was mine

A year to this day that my best friend died
For weeks I sat alone in my room and cried
And I tried to pretend everything was fine
But my soul couldn't rest until vengeance was mine

[Verse 3]
The day began with me standin' at his grave with his mother
His old girlfriend, his two younger brothers
We said a few words faces covered with tears
On how we missed him so much and we wished he was here
Then his girl said a poem put some roses on his stone
And we said our goodbyes and they all went home
I thought I'd use this time for me and him to be alone
I broke out the Hen' poured a little out for him
Told him who was gettin' married, who had went to the pen
How the homie named his newborn son after him
But as the sun went down our talk came to an end
So I said a quick prayer..amen
And I shook in the lac cross the railroad tracks
And I headed up La Brea, saw the homie Isaiah
I asked him what he doin' he was way out of bounds
He said he had a freak that lived on that side of town
But he always kept the heat just in case it went down
I clown, then I rolled down my window 'bout to light a ciga-
Hey! Is that that nigga... gimme your motherfucking gun right now
Man, drive around the block and post up for a minute
I hit you on the chirp, hit the corner nigga bend it
Splendid now with vengeance in my grasp
I couldn't dream of a better day for me to catch his ass
Slippin' while he dip into the ride by himself
I slid up behind him in the shadows hella stealth
He started to break hisself I said I didn't want a dime
Do you remember what you was doin' last year about this time?
He looked into my eyes with both shock and surprise
I split his face with the Glock right before he could reply
He cried as I pressed the heat against his cheek
Then I squoze two times for the homie rest in peace
[Outro]
It was a year to this day that my best friend died
For weeks I sat alone in my room and cried
And I tried to pretend everything was fine
But my soul couldn't rest until vengeance was mine
It was a year to this day that my best friend died
And for weeks I sat alone in my room and cried
And I thought that's what I wanted til the problem was confronted
Now I'm haunted by remorse that I wished I hadn't done it"

It's been a long
A long time coming but I know
Change gonna come

[Verse 1: Charles Hamilton]
Prisoner to my cerebellum
So I reach out to the listeners
And my mission is I better tell 'em
Our fear of a free mind is hearing
Your spirit can die anytime
You need to cry and so you hide it deep inside
Reason why?
How can you change what was written?
Easy, don't focus your brain on what they mentioned
I got so used to tryna make due
I feel like I'm cheating when I'm faced with a break through
The man in the mirror keeps saying I hate you
I respond like lil nigga I made you
Slay those sayin they could break you
So when I take a break I go ape come back and play fool
When they think they won that's when I crush them
Change is eminent I evolve so it's nothing
What's the discussion

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
We've been pompous ever since Columbus couldn't work a compass
We've accomplished what we've conjured up while conscious Unconsciously we've conquered all the eye can see
Constantly concocting more options but jobs are still obsolete
It seems so odd to me, an odyssey
How honesty is honestly the rarest thing upon us
It's astonishing
How did all the honest people vanish from the planet?
Leaving us a laundry list of problems to acknowledge
While plotting with my phonics me and Conic and B.o.B
Nag Champa rises as I sit down and sketch my rhymes
Stretch my mind to figure out what's next in line
The next Em, Ye and Andre?
Nah homie its just been a long
A long time coming

It's been a long
A long time coming but I know
Change gonna come
[Verse 3: B.o.B]
Well as you listening to this track
You probably about to blog about it and maybe say its wack
Or maybe compare the verses to see which one of us has snapped
Completely ignoring the fact that this is way more than rap
Cause I happen to be on a magazine you happen to see this issue
Some people wish you well man some people turn against you
Some people even call up to the station just to diss you
You bitch you, you only mad at your self here's a tissue
But that ain't even my focus man that hate ain't on my menu
Im in a different city about to rock a different venue
My girl sent me a text message just to say ""i miss you""
It won't be long before I'm home baby but the rent's due

You know how good it can be, if I took you home with me

Can I get a chance, grown man from afar superstar status
Holdin' on to the apparatus firmly
West shake show love heat 'em up in the club if you don't care
Conversations short, too many Newports blowing me away
To another broad, I mean cutie, with the nice round booty
Cut to the spot where all the girls wanna do me
On the low, nice and slow
T-mo on the floor, out the door lets go
Keep it on the hush, don't wanna rush when your ready
We can touch some G's, and blow trees in the wind
With a zip, I'm there, telling tales, out on bail
SWAT's tales of rolling boulders and breaking shoulders
Taking me closer to a poacher with that roll line
Shawty cause I'm down for mine

We at the club 112 on the front row
Shawty done shot the Cuervo
Even though she dancing with another niggeroe
Somewhere out on the floor
She told me Lo snap your finger when your ready to go
So you know I feel great, I can hardly wait
Hit the Waffle House and get a chicken-melt plate
Scrambled Eggs with cheese, and a pile of grease
And get full as a tick bout' ready to drip
And oh for trilly shawty don't be silly
Calm your nerves cause I'm back on that Philly
Cheifed like a champ, and everything is good
I got to much class, and I'll take you to school
I wanna act a fool, but I'm waiting patiently
It ain't good if it ain't been mentioned with me
And if your number fuck around and get hard to find
All I really wanna be is a thought in your mind

Can I take you home
You grown, sip a tea, nice feet
Eyes fly too, saw you when you came through
By yourself girl, no crew
Can I hold you, can I show you
Everything in life, that I've been through
We can roll in the hills in my big wheel
98 Lank Lank with the Stank Stank
These lights, this night, my dream, your screams
Silk sheets, we meet, what you need a ride, I got Fleet's
Leather seats with the woodgrain head back
When I drop it like that, baby don't act
How many times do I say that I want your love
Lets dip this club

God led me to The Shark Bar
On a Wednesday, with the dreads
White derby, looking delicious, good enough to eat
And what do I see, staring at me
A nice pair of eyes, coke bottle figure, wig, done to a T
Dressed in gangsta black, ready to be attacked by a real mack
Playing hard to get it, so I dips upstairs
How long will it take for my earrings to withdrawl
You is such a cold and lonely heart, I'll make you warm again
But it was something different about you though
You didn't ask for no autograph or swarm
All you needed was a hug
We being snug like fingers in the glove
8th grade was the last time a nigga was in love

Stuck on me at waffle house
After 1:12, when I go out
Where do you hang?
Or do you slang?
Or wear a chain?
Wear platinum rings?
I still maintain my ghetto side (Yeah)
Keep my pride
Get in my ride
Twenty-inch rims
I sport a brim
Hang with my girls
Go to the mall
Around the world
And keep the change
The finest things
Will still remain so ooh

Don't even look from across the room
You don't know enough about this world to

To come up on a girl like me
And that's not a possibility cause
[Verse 2: T-Mo]
You a big plastic girl
I'mma big boss man
I like old model cars and big sedans
You like two doors
Frontin' their clothes and Rolls
Or sit on the porch sip something cold
I like the nine when you up and not O's
I do sweets while you prefer the lows
Tonight I'mma choose cause you already chose
Grown for the business and I run the flow

Cause you ain't ghetto enough for me (What?)
And you ain't hot enough for me (Enuff)
And you ain't fly enough for me

And you're too tight wit yo money

Check it baby
So ghetto like hot fries
I come from Melvin and resemble
Twenty-twenty with his blood shot eyes, got 32 loads
Went from two O's to 32 loads
Which is enough to buy a Rolls
Hey, but nobody knows
Stay at my place
Keep my diamonds out of your face
You wanna be with this player
You gotta play at my pace
I'm slow but I can still come over there from where you're from
If you want some bullshit you better buy you some

Shorty wear yo gold teeth
Shorty wear yo long nails
Shorty wear yo fake hair
Shorty got the attitude all up in the news
To represent the Nineties girl
Doing it oh I need to

Or cause I’m Black, hmmm maybe?
Yeah, hey, tell me why my hands start sweating
And I hold my breath every time that you get behind me
I turn my music down so you won’t hear a sound
Man I’m nervous like I got a couple pounds on me
You pulled me over, you frown on me
With your flashlight, tell me what do you see
Thug niggas, drug dealers, it's a trip
Every nigga in this whip gotta motherfucking college degree
And then ahana... unh

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my middle finger to the law
I'm busting off, tryna touch the sky
My teacher said impossible but I’mma fucking try
Plus how he gon’ tell me, he don't make the rules
There’s niggas dying every day man we don’t make the news
Instead they talking bout some thunderstorm, cyclones
Timmy got his bike stole
Top story: Tiger Woods be fucking all these White hoes
Anchorman stop snitching
Cut to commercial, he be texting all his side bitches
Hey my goodness, how ironic
On trial for possession of some chronic
My lawyer came to court, man he was higher than a comet
Hey your honor, is you kidding
How you sit above me
Are you perfect motherfucker
How you finna judge me?
When you home you don't cuss, drink and puff like us?
These cops is bad boys, baby just like Puff
They hate they jobs and they days be fucked up like us
At the end of the day you niggas just like us
You niggas just like us"

You need a hot one I got one, now take it and bend
Shake it down, break it down with me and a friend

Arms, legs, backs, and breast

Suck it up and yuck it up, baby, work on that pole

See, my hot girl ride Lexus Coupe, bitch
And she got the matchin' Rollie, ho, floss your shit
And she got the matching mink for the winter, bitch
Plus, see, a real hot girl can't be faded, bitch
Roll the dice, hit the sev', no craps, bitch
She got the brand new Rover out the showroom quick
Customized TVs all through that shit
Yokahama twenty-inch dubs on that bitch
Now see my Cash Money hot girl floss her shit
Ridin' uptown, bumping Hot Boys, ya bitch

[Verse 3: B.G.]
A hot girl is a solid ho
If a bitch get outta line, she a violent ho
Ain't no pest, far from being a whining ho
Fuck up, she confess, she ain't no lying ho, that's what I need
A hot girl is a jazzy bitch
I'd take her any day for a classy bitch
On the down low for her nigga, she a nasty bitch
I tell her touch it, she gonna reach out and grab the dick
I bust a nut, it's soft, she get it back hard
The police kick in the door, she take the charge
If a nigga go to jail, she run for her nigga
Money orders, business, and pump one for her nigga
She be a nigga balling, work that body for her nigga
Let me come through, hit the stash, and rock-a-bye the nigga
I can't see no other bitch for the B.G. 
But a hot girl for sure, call her a H.G., a hot girl

[Verse 4: Turk & Lil' Wayne]
I like 'em hot, the ones that don't tell me to stop
Eat dick, swallow the cum and they know how to pop
I need a project bitch, a hoodrat bitch
One that don't give a fuck and say she took that dick
She a doggy with it, she can wobble-dy dance
She know how to monkey with it
Open her legs and squeeze a nigga like she want me in it
Now turn around and back it up
Then throw it at a nigga 'til I say, ""Ooh, that's enough""
Give me a gangsta ho, one that don't give a fuck
And that'll shank a ho
One that'll slang still, and keep it on the low
One that'll do time for me and slang that fuckin' coke
Dawg, you know
A lil' shorty get in the twat, have it hurting and thumping
They be like, ""They say he small, girl, he workin' with something""
I'm Lil' Wayne, on fire, I'll snatch your lil' boo
You a hot girl, baby, what's happening with you?

Oh, what you need boy? I need a hot girl

Come on, get with a nigga
If you fit the standard, come on, get with a nigga"
The Way I Am,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Segue from ""Steve Berman (Skit)""]
...Man, whatever

[Intro]
Dre, just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo
This song is for anyone
Fuck it, shut up and listen
Ayo

[Verse 1]
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this, on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
Of this chest and I rest again peacefully (Peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me (Speak to me), I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty (Is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you ten feet (Liftin' you ten feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you (Of all you), I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me
[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses.""
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (Finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (On Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happenin' (This happenin') then attack
Eminem 'cause I rap this way (Rap this way) but I'm glad
'Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn
And it's burnin', and I have returned
[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 3]
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a ""My Name Is""
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (Got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always
Keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (Fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (Drivin' me crazy), I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without
Someone standin' by it! (Standin' by it) No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad
[Chorus]
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

Hey, uh

You look sweet enough to make a nigga need a filling
If you got a man, do that nigga need a fill-in?
She said, ""Looks kill and I’m tryna make a killin'""
And God willing, I’d be chilling on the boat nigga
Love is a gamble, I ain’t dealin’ with no broke nigga
Down in Miami with a super ho team
Tryna bag a brother with a Super Bowl ring
Oh, she down in Dallas at the All-Star game
Spittin’ All-Star game
Tryna get a nigga with a all-star name, somethin’ like James
Somethin like Wade, if you something like paid
You can fuck tonight, yeah, she sayin', ""Fuck some nice J's
What about your life savings?"" Won’t spend her life slavin’
So she graduated, rich nigga wife training

But you done got thick on a nigga, goddamn
Hey now, I got a thing for you
It's been a long time comin', I should hang with you
'Cause see way back, I thought to fuck with you was impossible
Count your baby daddy’s now, two and a possible
Uh, you still got it though, yeah, you still got it though
Girl your body lookin’ like a fuckin’ pot of gold
You got your mean little walk with the model pose
You got your hair did, you got designer clothes
You still got it though, yeah, you still got it though

Do you get brains? Did you make the honor roll?

Hey, I get bored so fast that they won’t last
But girl you’re special like I met you in the slow class
'Cause yo ass got me fiending for ya so far
My life is like a movie, would you be my co-star?
Like Halle Berry? Your old nigga act like a bitch, like Tyler Perry
You caught him down in Memphis cheating like Calipari
I see you like to stay up on your ESPN
If your mind is on sex, you must got ESP then
Had a crush on way back, I wasn’t VIP then
But I was plotting on you, I really wish that I'd have got to know you
Before we grew up and I blew up with these Benjamins
That way I know for sure your love is really genuine
Is you my homie? Well show me what kind of friend you is
What if it's phony? Yeah only 'cause I can give you ends
Too late for turning back, fuck it, we continuing
Get your ass in that position I love to bend you in

You ever see someone who roll with Mayweather
Rhyme like Ricky Hatton
Smash whatever you throw, 1000 is what I'm battin'
Got a few hooks but no jabs
Took them out your corn dog books and notepads
I get it, you Got Rich robbing those in the industry
Bite off this one, steal from your enemy
Never try to play the hottest one out your camp
He might step off and take half the juice from your amp
Enough to make you vogue on the cover of GQ
Only missing the sheer blouse, homie, you see-through
Stop sipping on that Formula 50
They want heat, I'll give it to them burnt and crispy
Rhymes too short to box with God, so stretch it
Especially these overrated rap steppin' fetchers
I told you if I rain, there'll be an eternal drizzle
Woodwork strips being chipped to charred chisel
One verse shatter your spine and crush your spirit
No matter what, you still window shop for lyrics
If you's a pimp, put chicks on a stroll
And if those your soldiers, give 'em bigger guns to hold
Who Shot Ya? You don't have enough on your roster
Move like a Fed, talk like a mobster
That Yayo slangin, please abort it
Too many cuts on it, cokeheads they won't snort it
Spray the Flea-Unit with pesticides
You can get your best ghostwriters, get them all to testify
Have you ever been stung by a thousand hornets?
Five hundred killa bees, buzzing and really on it
Whipped with Cuban Linx, cut with Liquid Swords
Choked by Ironman 'til we crush your vocal cords
You ain't nothing but a pig in a blanket
Hoghead, the deadliest food at the banquet
All this rap crap that's trapped in your colon
Only means, get rid of the whack shit you're holdin'
Sweet-tooth dudes stay out the candyshop
You ain't gotta handcuff 'em to see the panties drop
A few cats is looking for a rat with cheese
Got something to pitch? They all swing a bat with ease
Get your ankles rolled while doing your two-step
Leave a Thank-You note for the crutches the Wu left
Proactive rap, you know they put drug in the cream
You hallucinate, see Kanye in your dream
And yo, I don't smoke dust; I dust off Smokey and the Bandits
With the brush stroke off the canvas
I walk on your Gators and lizards
Raise the lynx that was killed for your minx, you be rocking them Blizzards
Wanna be caught 'til you walk the D-Block
To get a transfer, I'll spread your wings like Peacocks
I was an emcee while you was in Nutville
On a world tour, you was gettin' your guts filled
Ten years your senior but I flow like I'm twenty-one
Straight from Medina with a mass of many suns
Supernova give off gamma-ray bursts
And I'll finish this, only 'cause I let off first, what's up?"

Da-da, da-da
Yo, I can't sing, but
I feel like singing
I wanna fuckin' sing
'Cause I'm happy
Yeah, I'm happy
I got my baby back
Yo, check it out

[Verse 1]
Some days I sit starin' out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy
I'm crazy, oh, so crazy
Why am I here? Am I just wastin' my time?
But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no
[Chorus 1]
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
(Fuck, I was scared)
Everyone's leanin' on me
‘Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

[Verse 2]
My baby girl keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes ‘cause they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side
I act like shit don't faze me
Inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no

[Chorus 1]
‘Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
‘Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

[Verse 3]
Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't *reh tnaw*
Now, you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packin' drug addict who bags on his momma
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
‘Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside of
My soul and just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin': three felonies, six years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman
I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs
Bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I shoulda seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
Wouldn't have ripped the prenup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, maybe, the only lady that I adore
Hailie! So sayonara, try tomorrow, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted
And—
[Chorus 2]
Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
Nothin' can take her from me

[Outro]
Wooo! Told you I can't sing
Oh, well—I tried
Hailie, 'member when I said
If you ever need anything, Daddy would be right there?
Guess what—Daddy's here
And I ain't goin' nowhere, baby
I love you (​​*smooch*)​​"

Oh my God, oh my God
We're gonna have to shock him
Oh my God

These are the results of a thousand electric volts
A neck with bolts
Nurse, we're losin' him, check the pulse
A kid who refused to respect adults
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
A corny-lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery
'Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me
And I might snap, one day just like that
I decided to strike back, and flatten every tire on the bike rack
My first day in Junior High, this kid said
""It's you and I, three o'clock sharp, this afternoon you die""
I looked at my watch, it was 1:20
""I already gave you my lunch money
What more do you want from me?""
He said, ""Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse""
My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first
Somethin' told me, ""Try to fake a stomach ache, it works""
I screamed, ""Ow, my appendix feel like they could burst
Teacher, teacher, quick, I need a naked nurse""
""What's the matter?""
""I don't know, my leg, it hurts""
""Leg? I thought you said it was your tummy""
""Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee""
""Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over
And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework""
""But don't you wanna give me after school detention?""
""Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'ma let him""

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song
Brain damage

[Verse 2]
Way before my baby daughter Hailie
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named DeAngelo Bailey
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes
So every day he'd shove me in the lockers
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin'
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat
I tried to plead and tell him we shouldn't beef
But he just wouldn't leave
He kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe
He looked at me and said, ""You gonna die, honky""
The principal walked in and started helpin' him stomp me
(What's going on in here?)
I made 'em think they beat me to death
Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four-inch screws
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms and foreign tools
This is for every time you took my orange juice
Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
I'm gettin' you back, bully, now once and for good
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could
And beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot
Made it home later that same day
Started readin' a comic, and suddenly everything became gray
I couldn't even see what I was tryin' to read
I went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
My mother started screamin', ""What are you on, drugs?!
Look at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug"" (I'm sorry)
She beat me over the head with the remote control
Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
I picked it up and screamed, ""Look, bitch, what have you done?""
""Oh my God, I'm sorry, son""
Shut up, you cunt
I said fuck it, took it and stuck it back up in my head
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck
[Chorus]
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song

[Outro]
Brain damage, it's brain damage
I got brain damage, it's brain damage
It's probably brain damage, it's brain damage
Brain damage, I got brain damage"
Grammy Family Freestyle,JAY-Z,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","[Intro: Jay-Z & (Funkmaster Flex)]
I been crushing the building since Izod socks
I'm so independent, sh..I might buy Koch
I might not stop
Places to cop, seventy-six floors, you can call me the Doc
Say when, say when
(When!)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Inspired by Basquiat, my chariot's on fire
Everybody took shots, hit my body up, I'm tired
Build me up, break me down to build me up again
They like: ""Hov, we need you back so we can kill your ass again""
""Hov got flow though he's no Big and Pac, but he's close""
How I'm 'posed to win? they got me fightin' ghosts
Same sword they knight you they gon' good night you with
Sh.., Thats' only half if they like you
That ain't even the half what they might do
Don't believe me, ask Michael
See Martin, see Malcolm
You see Biggie, see Pac, see success and its outcome
See Jesus, see Judas; see Caesar, see Brutus
See success is like suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
If you succeed, prepare to be crucified
Media meddles, niggas sue you, you settle
Every step you take, they remind you you ghetto
So it's tough bein' Bobby Brown
To be Bobby then, you gotta be Bobby now
Now the question is, is to have had and lost
Better than not having at [all]
[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Everybody wanna be the King then shots ring
You layin' on your balcony with holes in your dream
Or you Malcolm X-d out, get distracted by screams
Everybody get your hand off my jeans
Everybody look at you strange, say you changed
Uhh! Like you work that hard to stay the same
Uhh! Game stays the same, the name changes
So its best for those to not overdose on being famous
Most kings get driven so insane
That they try to hit the same vein that Kurt Cobain did
No dangers, so shameless
Invited to the inner sanctum of your chambers
Low chain 'em as the enemies approach
So raise your draw bridge and drown them in the moat
And the Spirit I'm evoking
Hold on

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Everybody screaming they want the old Hov
But the new improved Hov hit like Albert Pujols
Everybody wanna hear me talk that money like Phil Rizzuto
But my mind is on Pluto
Bills that I do fold, I now invest on
Trying to find some loopholes in the IRS
As where I used to have a few hoes, I am just
Concentrating on making a new Hov through sex
I've awakened just in time to school those putos
Trying to follow in my shoes with jewels froze
Better adhere to this text 'fore you go
Broke, spending more than you've accrued on silly baguettes
I know silly begets silly you'll learn on your own
At least my conscience is clear, I'm no longer steering you wrong
Ain't nothing wrong with baguettes after you get a home
Take care of your home, you can go back and—ugh!
[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
I'm getting courted by the bosses
The Edgars And Doug Morris-es-es
Jimmy I's and Lyors-es -- it's
Gotta be more than the choruses
They respecting my mind now
Just a matter of time now
Operation: Takeover Corporate
Makeover offices-es-es then takeover all of it
Please may these words be recorded
To serve as testimony that I saw it all before it
Came to fruition, sort of a premonition
Uncontrollable hustler's ambition
Alias Superstition, like Stevie
The writing's on the wall like my lady, right baby?
Saw it all before, some of y'all thought I was crazy, maybe
Like a fox, I'm cagey, ah-ah
The more successful, the more stressful
The more and more I transform to Gordon Gekko
In the race to a billion got my face to the ceiling
Got my knees on the floor, please Lord forgive him
Has he lost his religion, is the greed gon' get him?
He's having heaven on earth, will his wings still fit him?
I got the Forbes on my living room floor
And I'm still talking to the poor, nigga I want more
TIME's most influential, was impressive
'Specially since I wasn't in the artist section
Had me with the builders and the titans
Had me right with Rupert Murdoch
Billionaire boys and some dudes you never heard of
Word up on Madison Ave is I'm a cash cow
Word down on Wall Street, homie, you get the cash out
IPO Hov, no need for reverse merger
The boy money talk no need to converse further
The baby blue Maybach like I own Gerber
Boardroom I'm lifting ya skirt up"

Admiring your style and your physique
And I ain't tryna critique
But you deserve a good drink, so what's up?
What you sipping on? It's no problem
Black and gold bottles like I'm pro-New Orleans
But, shawty, I'm far from a Saint
But I got two Am-Exes that look the same way

My Prada say ""Prada,"" and they Prada say ""Fila""
I ain't gotta tell you, they know about me, huh
Come to D.C., and I can make you a believer

Big black diamond, bigger than a black razor

Uh
Uh
I love it, though
I love it, though, huh, you know?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Uh, put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preachin' to the congregation
We love Jesus, but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married, but tonight I need some consummation

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour, I seen good Christians
Make brash decisions, oh, she do it
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She putting on her makeup, she casually allure
Text message break-ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbin' off
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
I'm looking at her like, ""This what you really wanted, huh?""
Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preachin' to the congregation
We love Jesus, but she done learned a lot from Satan
Satan, Satan, Satan
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married, but tonight I need some consummation

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
When the sun go down, it's the magic hour, the magic hour
And outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don't leave while you're hot, that's how Mase screwed up
Throwin' shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat
You see, I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight, you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
That's ""Dior Homme,"" not ""Dior, homie""
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me, could you be more phony?
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
Haven't said a word, haven't said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Lookin' at my bitch, I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist, it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sipping rosé all alone
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry-red chariot, excess is just my character
All-black tux, nigga's shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired (Uh)
Before his jaw shattered, climbing up the Lord's ladder
We still speedin', running signs like they don't matter, uh
Hater talkin' never made me mad
Never that, not when I'm in my favorite paper tag
Therefore, G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools, fool, I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope, I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin', so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex' sport
So many cars, DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps I was gettin' mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, right in Melbourne
Whole clique appetites had tapeworms
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns
I shed a tear before the night's over
God bless the man I put this ice over (Uh)
Getting 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice-roller
I'm makin' love to the angel of death
Catchin' feelings, never stumble, retracin' my steps (Uh)

Coolest flow, signal to my crew the cue to go
With they finger on triggers, gunpowder under cuticles (Ugh!)
And, newest flow shows as ugly as warzones, yeah
Shit is ugly as Lady Gaga's wardrobes (Ugh!)
Word to Dilla, his verses iller, the words are killer
Ain't heard nothing this legendary out
Since the birth of Thriller (Ooh!)
My human nature to expose teams seems
These rapping niggas are girls, pre-teen Billie Jean
Seems they love when I'm performing (Ha!)
They laugh at your performance (Yeah!)
My shit is Martin Luther, your shit is Martin Lawrence (Oh!)
Touring on a plane in somewhere in the world new
In the clouds, listening to Stevie Wonder's ""Girl Blue""

Just these triggers; we old school like Dean Pritchard
You can't take the heat, get yo' ass out the kitchen
Matter-fact, take yo' ass back in there and wash the dishes

I don't even write seriously; I just fuck around
Like a rolling stone, I lay the hat in many homes
Bad boy like Diddy Combs
Shoulders, what his whole entire city on

Yo! You need to be amputated (Ugh); I'll snap you in minutes
I left Detroit rappers in fitteds decapitated
It's not a dumb threat 'cause though I'm not what I'll become yet
I'll challenge some vet and stick it to him like a drum set
Clap the matic; I'll flip like an acrobatic
Slap fanatics with murderous rap mechanics
I'm worth pay, pockets go green like it was Earth Day
That's why I blow cake like it's my birthday
The way I roll: envision a city blob
Half of y'all shouldn't rap
Y'all do a shitty job like colon cleansing
And I'm dying to test ya, no denying I'm applying the pressure
Like the iron I rely on that lie in the dresser (Ugh)
Several try and get they Kangol crushed
Cuz my skills ill like slicing up devil's pie off of angel dust
You left behind me looking shadowy, it's fatality

Ladies and gentlemen, right now
We wanna bring forth to the stage
A very special guest
The undisputed Made Men

[Verse 1: Twice Thou]
Ayo don't run up on me, wit that rah rah
Smoking lah lah
I'll blow holes in your dada, you nada
I toke a lotta, choke a lotta... from Havana
And stroke skins in the Ramada, I open drama
Told the llamas in my bomber, word to mama
Ready to war in pajamas in these cold streets
I hold heat. I'm a known thief, with gold teeth
Matching custom made gold jeep
Chrome rims, brown Tims, plus a Benz getting flown in
Equipped with shit to make domes spin
You average, we set standards
Trend set, Made Men wet
Anything moving in front of the TEC
With immaculate, accurate aim, crack the game
With a home run, blasting lames with they own gun
It's on, son. My air crowd's got the spare gat
By the gear shaft, quick to clear cats out like tear gas
The wrong one since a young gun
Not an unsung hero with a fitted sombrero
Gimme arms' length. Bomb threat phenomenon, shit
I get the dough cause I want it (that's right!)
[Chorus: Benzino]
Cash from mad grams make it alright
While we push big cars under moonlight
Be those 20 inch mirrors on Mercedes
Nickel nine for those niggas acting shady
Never ever turn my back on my Made Men
Nigga when its time to set it, just say when
But for now we gonna ride like it's do or die
And when its all set and done its just you and I
(you and I, you and I)

[Verse 2: Mr. Gzus]
C'mon, let the game break, g
Even though it's the grain cause of Made Men
Selling drugs with pistols just to get papes
211 your spot, leave you 187
And a pen and pad being my only weapon
Approaching Armageddon, care to learn a cautious lesson?
Second guessing in this life can be costly
When the bangs broken leave a nigga frosty
Frozen stiff from the 40 mil mega lift
From a game played out like a Sega gift
For the streets, shit take a major whiff [inhalation]
Of the high potent seedless cannabis sativa, I believe that
It takes a lot of pain away, I do this everyday
It gotta be a better way, looking for a rider
Tomorrow been suffering the sorrow
Took the heat, took the lead, now you follow
Every road has two paths
One's fun and laughs, opposite of blood bath
I choose the better half, run with the cheddar staff
Avoid the garbage, recycle the trash
To get track cats slapped up and kidnapped
Cause we rapping don't mean it can happen
See the gats clapping? At ease. You been cleared from the homicide
Nothing to fear cause we here, just you and I
[Chorus x2: Benzino]
Cash from mad grams make it alright
While we push big cars under moonlight
Be those 20 inch mirrors on Mercedes
Nickel nine for those niggas acting shady
Never ever turn my back on my Made Men
Nigga when its time to set it, just say when
But for now we gonna ride like it's do or die
And when its all set and done its just you and I
(you and I, you and I)

[Over Chorus and outro to fade out: D Quest]
Where my dogs at?
Where my dogs at?
Let's ride
Where my dogs at?
That keeps us alright"

Soon as I hit the club, look at them hoes' face
Hit the pedal once, make the floor shake
Suede inside, my engine roarin'
It’s the big boy, you know what I paid for it
And I got the pedal to the metal
Got you niggas checking game, I’m ballin' out on every level
Hear them haters talk, but there’s nothin' you can tell 'em
Just made a million, got another million on my schedule
No love for 'em, nigga breaking hearts
No keys, push to start

Stay high like how I’m supposed to do
That crowd underneath them clouds can’t get close to you
And my car look unapproachable
Super clean, but it's super mean

Get fly and take trips and that's that, real rap
I let her get high if she want and she feel that

Dont Let Me Fall,B.o.B,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues']","[Chorus]
Well, it was just a dream, just a moment ago
I was up so high, lookin' down at the sky, don't let me fall
I was shootin' for stars, on a Saturday night
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall, don't let me fall
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall

[Verse 1]
'Cause I'm glidin' up there, oh so very high that if the
Clouds were to drop me then I'd, fall out the sky, I don't really
Know why I'm here, I guess I'm, just here for the ride, I swear it
Feels like I'm dreamin', it's vividly defined, yeah
So call me whatever you want, title me whatever you like
But let's get one thing straight, you know my name
So I run this town, when I'm on this mic, yeah
So here I go, B.o.B, Bobby Ray, I don't know, need I know
But I know, that I flow, rack 'em up, knock 'em down, dominoes
Then I go, as my story goes
I know I've done been down here before
Product of my East Decatur home
'Cause I was in the cold, tryna keep my toes unfroze
Now I'm in your house, now I'm in your soul
Now I'm everywhere that your iPod go
Everything I seen was a dream just a moment ago
[Chorus]
Well, it was just a dream, just a moment ago
I was up so high, lookin' down at the sky, don't let me fall
I was shootin' for stars, on a Saturday night
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall, don't let me fall
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall, don't let me fall
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall

[Verse 2]
Yeah, well I'm from much lower than where that pavement is
'Cause there ain't no parachute that they can make for this
'Cause I put my pain, my heart, my soul, my faith in this
Does anyone feel like how I feel? Then you can relate to this
Or just blaze to this, maybe roll one up, then take a hit
Toast to the good life then take a sip
Vacay everyday, yeah take a trip
It's easy to see I was made for this
From the womb all the way to the grave I spit
Just to show y'all niggas what greatness is, yeah
I'm talkin' very lucid, like makin' movies
To picture my life boy, you need a higher resolution
I used to cut class in the day, then run away at night
But now I'm ruler of the upper class and I don't even write
[Chorus]
Well, it was just a dream, just a moment ago
I was up so high, lookin' down at the sky, don't let me fall
I was shootin' for stars, on a Saturday night
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall, don't let me fall
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall"
Onslaught 2,Slaughterhouse,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Royce Da 5'9""]
(Ohh!) Yeah (let's go!)
I said once upon a time in a city that's mine
There was a nigga named Nickel that spit like Big in his prime
He got a 52 box, original tick in the mind
Listening to Pac and them drop with a prestigious design
My niggas is dons, my bitches is dimes
I came up behind Eminem in '99 and I took the baton
I been running shit ever since then, slaughtered MC's
Sit and watching my green grow, like I'm watering seeds
The problem with me is I'm the heart of the streets
Niggas calling for peace, they can't even call the police
If I ain't better than you I'm harder to beat
Probably cause I live by the art of for-keeps
I get indicted after my product's released
We a different form, a different centrifugal force
Every line is like gripping on a stick shift in a Porsche
My niggas asked for direction to go on this track
I said FUCK a direction, spaz out! Get 'em up HIGH

[Female] Crooked
[Crooked I]
And for them wack songs that you made
I want you to throw your pin, but hold the grenade
Explode to your grave - and go straight to hell
When your soul is enflamed for the road that you paved
The role that you played, in fucking up hip-hop
You owe so you paid, the fo'-fo' close to your brain
Closer than the close shave of a low fucking fade
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with J-O-E
With Nickel we gon' make more cheese
Heavy hitter, call me Joell David Ortiz (what up!)
I point a burner at the plaque on your teeth
On some leftover shit, it's a wrap on the beef
I'm one in a mil', comin' to kill
It's like you won an appeal, my gun put your back on the streets
Spine on the concrete looking at the sun
Eyelids heavy, ""Why did Crooked have to come?
He was full of 'gnac and rum, like a bully acting dumb""
Fully-automatic umm, that's Crooked having fun
Listen, don't make a nigga find your dame
And make the dime give me brains 'til my mind is drained
Listen, don't make me grab a 9 and aim
And how your dime did me, do yo' mind the same
But different, the West Coast king Crooked I
I'm a kamikaze pilot, I stay fly 'til I die, get 'em up HIGH
[Female] Joell

[Joell Ortiz]
Here we go again, you know I'm him, Mr. Ortiz
Soon as I hold a pen I co-defend the sickest MC's (Slaughterhouse)
Pick a disease we got it, I vomit sniffle and sneeze
Lyrics squeeze, listen please, Lord help get rid of this fever
I'm like 150 degrees
16's used to be sweet, now they're a bit of a tease
A nigga need a infinite instrumental just to be pleased
Used to dream about living now I'm living my dreams
The bitches fiend, made my dick a machine
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I am just as fucking big as I seem
When I'm spitting this mean, me and government intervene
A couple presidents, literally live in my jeans
I give 'em residence, they just let me pick anything
When I'm in the mall, they show me the latest kicks on the scene
And I get 'em all, I ball like the nigga I am
Niggas hate, bitches Cheer like Norm, Cliff and Diane
I'm in a state, of mind that should be the fifty first
I run radio, but I don't use them itty bitty words
I ain't shabby with the nouns, I ain't shitty with the verb
When I reach heaven I want the nigga Biggie to be like ""Word""
City slicker, New York delivery when I swerve
Hold that mic like the Statue of Liberty, I deserve
A shot at the title, Spitter of the Year
E'ry year, let's be clear, put some fingers in the air
And hold 'em up HIGH {*echoes*}
[Female] Joey

[Joe Budden]
Work on your half-court shot, I'm money from far
Get 'em mad, see a ape on your monkey bars
And that's rate, getting hate from the wannabe stars
And that's great, mean he feel it and know he numb
See that bullet coming from around the corner
Like a shot from Angelina Jolie's gun; think Joey the one
I'm a fake? Ain't your run-of-the-mill
I'm from where they kill you for one of your bills
For me it's fun, your man think we evenly skilled
He Mel Gibson, all that shit he believe, gon' get his son killed
Play with a match, FUCK what you take it as
No good straight jacket, all I did break the match
They say he talk tough with his fake ass
Four pounds put me in another weight class
Great Escape the pad
Took the jumpsuit off my naked ass and ate the mask
You diss me, you wanna be a great that fast?
Take a fully-automatic and spray at gas
Me? Body a whole shit with a verse probably atrocious
In your whole camp, nobody focused
They say you the Ultimate Warrior, I agree
You die and come BACK, won't nobody notice
Drive by, screaming it's a new crew repping
Hanging out the window, like it's ""227""
Get 'em up HIGH

Get 'em up high, get 'em up high
Get 'em up high, get 'em up high
Get 'em up high, in the sky
Put 'em up high, put 'em up high
Put 'em up high, fingers in the sky

Pour Out a Little Liquor,Thug Life,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'alternative']","[Intro]
Yeah, pour out a little liquor for your homies, nigga
This one here go out to my nigga Mike Cooley
(Light up a fat one for this one!)
How you come up, man?

[Verse 1]
I started young, kickin' dust and livin' rough
You'd watch your mouth, around my mama you couldn't cuss, man
I had a down-ass homie though, we ran the streets
And on the scene at the age of fourteen, huh
I packed a nine and my nigga packed a forty-five
We drinkin' forties, lil' shorties livin' naughty lives
You couldn't stop us, long as I got my Glock, fuck the coppers
Hangin' on the block, slangin' rocks and makin' profits
I couldn't fuck with the school life
I was a fool, I'd play that motherfucker for a tool, man
Tonight'll be the night, that's what we thinkin'
Hustlin' in the rain, felt no pain 'cause we drinkin'
Playin' them hoes like manure
First let my nigga fuck and then I fuck, that's how we do her (haha)
It's two niggas comin' up out the hood
Livin' life just as good as we could
But since a bitch can't be trusted
Hoes snitched to the police, now my nigga's busted
The cops whoopin' on my nigga in jail
Tryin' to get a motherfucker to tell
And couldn't nobody diss my nigga
Damn, I miss my nigga
Pour out a little liquor!
[Chorus]
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
This goes out to all you so-called G's
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
Pour out a little liquor for your real motherfuckin' partners
Don't let the drink get like that, y'all, huh
Pour out a little liquor!
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
Pour out a little liquor!
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
What's that you drinkin' on?

[Verse 2]
Drinkin' on gin, smokin' on blunts and it's on
Reminisce about my niggas that's dead and gone
And now they buried, sometimes my eyes still get blurry
'Cause I'm losin' all my homies and I worry
I got my back against a brick wall, trapped in a circle
Boxin' with them suckers 'til my knuckles turn purple
Mama told me, ""Son, there'll be days like this.""
Don't wanna think so, I hit the drink and stay blitzed
We had plans of bein' big-time G's
Rollin' in mob cars, movin' them keys
And now I roll up the window, blaze up some indo
Get tore down for my niggas in the pen', yo
Your son's gettin' big and strong
And I'd love him like one of my own, so you come home
And the years sure fly with a quickness
You do the time, and I'll keep handlin' yo' business
That's the way it's supposed to be, homie
If you was me, you'd do the shit for me, homie
I can remember scrappin' back to back, throwin' dogs
On them suckers, runnin' up on this young hog
I hope my words can paint a perfect picture
And let you know how much a nigga miss ya
Pour out some liquor!
[Outro]
My cousin' died last year and I still can't let go
Look at you, drinkin' got you
Where you don't even give respect to your partners
Pour out some liquor, nigga!
It ain't like that, tip that shit over!
Pour out a little liquor!
This for my nigga Madman, Dagz, Hood, Silk, yeah
My cousin' died last year and I still can't let go
A little liquor for my homies, y'all
We in this motherfuckin' piece, yeah
My cousin' died last year and I still can't let go
Pour out a little liquor!
Young Queen, yeah
My cousin' died last year and I still can't let go
This one goes out to all my mack partners
Back in the motherfuckin' Bay
My cousin' died last year and I still can't let go
Oaktown still in the motherfuckin' house
(Pour out a little liquor!)
My nigga Richie Rich, Govenor
My cousin' died last year and I still can't let go
(I don't care, Night Train, Hennessy)
All my real motherfuckin' partners

And all my real partners in Marin, fuck you busta-ass niggas!

When thugs cry
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my guns to keep
If I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
Got us dyin'
When thugs cry, times is hard

[Verse 1]
Born thuggin', and lovin' the way I came up
Big money clutchin', bustin' while evadin' cocaine busts
My pulse rushin', semi clutchin' into insanity
They shot at my cousin, now we bustin' at they whole family
The coppers wanna see me buried, I ain't worried
I got a line on the D.A. ‘cause I'm fuckin' his secretary
I black out and start cussin', bust 'em and touch 'em all
They panic, and bitches duckin', I rush 'em and fuck 'em all
I'll probably be an old man before I understand
Why I have to live my life with pistols close at hand
Kidnapped my homie's sister, cut her face up bad
They even raped her, so we blazed they pad
Automatic shots rang out, on every block
They puttin' hits out on politicians, even cops
I ain't lyin', they got me sleepin' with my infrared beams
And in my dreams I hear motherfuckers screamin'
What is the meanin' when thugs cry?
[Hook: singer & (2Pac)]
Oh, why should you send your child off to die?
In the streets of chalk where they lie
Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God (when thugs cry)
Oh my, does it have to be this way?
Our children of today won't stay wise
Let the children hear when thugs cry, dear God, oh why?

[Verse 2]
Maybe my addiction to friction got me buggin'
Where is the love?, never quit my ambition to thug
Ain't shed a tear since the old school years of elementary
Niggas I used to love, enclosed in Penitentiaries
But still, homie, keep it real, how does it feel
To lose your life, over something that you did as a kid?
You all alone, no communication, block on the phone
Don't get along with your pop, and plus your moms is gone
Where did we go wrong? I put my soul in the song
To help us grow in time, but now our minds are gone
We went from brothers and sisters to niggas and bitches
We went from welfare livin' to worldwide riches
But somethin' changed in this dirty game, everything's strange
Lost all my homies over cocaine, man
See, they ask me if I shed a tear, I ain't lie
See, you gotta get high or die, ‘cause even thugs cry
[Hook: singer]
Oh, why should you send your child off to die?
In the streets of chalk where they lie
Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God
Oh my, does it have to be this way?
Our children of today won't stay wise
Let the children hear when thugs cry, dear God, oh why?

[Verse 3]
And all I see is these paranoid bitches, illegal adventures
Bustin' motherfuckers with uppercuts, I leave 'em with dentures
‘Cause in my criminal mind, nobody violates the Don
I write your name wit' a piece of paper, now your family's gone
Why perpetrate like you can handle my team?
So merciless in my attack I take command of your dreams
Leavin' motherfuckers drownin' in they own blood
Clownin', takin' pictures later
Laugh 'bout them punk bitches that turned snitches
Regulate my area, the terror I represent
Makin' your people disappear, you wonderin' where they went
Am I cold, or is it just I sold my soul?
Addicted to these streets, never find true peace I'm told
Come take my body, God, don't let me suffer any longer!
Smoke a pound of marijuana, so I know it ain't long
Where is the end to all my misery, is there a close?
I suppose that's why I murder my foes; when thugs cry
[Hook: singer]
Oh, why should you send your child off to die?
In the streets of chalk where they lie
Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God
Oh my, does it have to be this way?

Let the children hear when thugs cry, dear God, oh why?

Oh, why should you send your child off to die?

I got ice all over my windshield
I can tell it's gon' be a cold winter
I hit the defrost, I never turn the heat off
And still I'm so chilly willy snowflake
These silly billies really fail to act as if they know Drake
Always gossipin' callin' and textin'
Magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men
Tellin' my ex-girl tryin' to explain
How I am no good, so go with the next man, but dog
You don't know me, you don't know us
We go by the name of A-T-F, and any previous affiliation
They know to hold they tongue and I spare 'em humiliation
I know you in and out, nigga I am not playin'
Just fall back, keep on Escape'in and Alize'in
And stop tryna act like you like me and my team
Not us, so you knock us, that's precisely what I mean
And dog, it's forever clear, my money evergreen
My presence required in places you have never been
It's all in a day's work, that's what I am on
NBC, MTV, Viacom
And whose Continental GT is outside
Showin' them how monumental he be?
One wheel on the curb, ticket on the dash
It's like every fuckin' summer I just switch it on they ass
And maaan I'm a commodity, none of them as hot as me
The industry standard, so I am what they gotta be
Cause Drake's syllables is like Jake Gyllenhaal
Can't help it, I been brainwashed to kill 'em all
I think I should pass my own amendment
You frontin' with glass all in your pendant
You ain't livin', rapper, you never have been
You a has-been, a gas station attendant
Your man is a turkey, you wit' a liar
I'm clearin' the air, I'm a humidifier
I'm spittin' fire, and gettin' flyer
And what you plannin' for this summer, I did it prior
I've shattered shows in tattered clothes
Met status quos, this is the South
And I am, present when it matters most
The startin's hot but pay attention to my latter flows
Givin' brain ain't bad girl, don't be that opposed
I flatter hoes
And drink Dom, they always ask me, ""Is that a rose?""
""You mean Rosé? Why yes it is""
I stopped trying years ago, this is effortless
I'm in your house got the key to your home
I am Jeopardy asked Wikipedia known
I am A.A. driven and Expedia flown
So stop jackin' my style, you're in need of ya own, man"

They say we living in troubled times
Aye, do you see the trouble signs?
Aye, lifes a bitch, and I'm cuffing mines
My dough in flipmode, what up to Busta Rhymes
I used to never see green, I was colorblind
Now I get my hustle on
Pay dues like a hair salon
My way like a Usher song
Higher power where these verses from
You niggas hoes, put your purses on
Church, get your worship on
Born alone, work alone, die alone
Hot fire like Dylan
Bitches get their dial on
Fake niggas get dial tones
I ain't no Viacom nigga
I'm a fire arm, nigga
Look how I alarm niggas
Watch my dope pile on
'Til it's like a mile long
Niggas couldn't fill my shoes
Couldn't even try 'em on
Showed your lil' ass look
That's how you take it
Two-facing niggas, couldn't tie my shoe laces, boy!

That was the warm up, this is the blow up
Now if you ain't talking no bread boy, ain't no need to show up
Man they say I'm repping the Ville too much, but fuck it, so what?
When my niggas carrying toys like they don't wanna grow up
When my sisters drinking like fishes and won't even throw up

Some niggas can't get no love
Some of 'em can't get no bucks

My brother got him an interview, but he can't get a ride
What's up God?
No this ain't no Wu-Tang shit
This is my lil' fire drill, just some routine shit
Just to shoot fiends with
And hold 'em off a lil' longer
Every verse I write I swear I'm only getting stronger
Can you ponder?
Imagine what my shit gon' sound like
If I told you that The Warm Up was just a sound bite
Damn right, believe I put it down right
And I'll be sure to tell you lil' niggas what that crown like
I showed you love, I brought you through
I gave you pounds right?
Aye, in my face, you knew your place
And so you smile right?
So why I'm here, and now you talking like a little girl?
You sound like Whitley, nigga

Fuck what they say, wishing me harm and sorrow

They catching Z's on me, aye we gon' call 'em Zorro
I'll let you sleep today, but it's on tomorrow

I can't be responsible for what I say or I do
When I talk intoxicated
Shorty say I told her I love her
I put her out the next morning saying bitch I must have been faded
I don't know what you heard about me but the word about me
That I'm no trick, I'm no sucker, I'm no chump
I be in the VIP, with my niggas round me
Saying y'all can have whatever you want
[Hook 2]
Me I get it in
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
That's Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday we get it in
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty give me a drink
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty give me a drink

[Verse 2]
I hate to say I told you so, but I told you so
I go hard when it's time to play
Shorty get to dropping it low, like the dancers do
In the Go-Go in front of me
She know I like to see her dance, she get to breaking it down
We get the bouncing outta control
Because I got a hell of a flow, we got paper to blow
My whole clique pop bottles galore
It's no secret the hood done peeped it
When we come through son, we look like bread
My '89 grind, make my old nine shine
Like we been moving bricks round this bitch for years
I say I get it in it's because I get it in
Now shorty there a eight but her friend near a ten
I feeling a spend my G, she fuck with me I'm into win
I'm cooler than her ma then we do this shit again
[Hook 2]
Me I get it in
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
That's Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday we get it in
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty give me a drink
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty give me a drink

[Hook 1]
Na na na na, Now me I'm the life of the party
A little bit of juice, little bit of the gin
A little bit of mo' play, bottles of the rose
Feel a little buzz, then I'm getting it in
Now me I get it in, I get it in
Me I get it in, I get it in
Now me I get it in, I get it in
Me I get it in, I get it in"

For 210!

Feel the beat slowly making its way into me
Im the type of guy that pre-fers qua-li-ty over quan-ti-ty
Only purchase the best buy to help I bring out thee best in me

With ini-tials that spell out E.V.L
Only uh dumbass would try to test me
If you want to mess with me you better be a girl indeed unless you wanna rest in peace

Which is something I do everynight in my sleep
CuzIlet my words do all the dirty work n keep my hands clean
Oth-er medi-ocre flows blow they belong on a winded band team
This uh wicked mans scheme to acheiving his dream

Attracting together completly opposite styled entity's
To create perfectly engineered sounding symphony's

Life is like a movie where I mercilessly shoot every scene
Including a beat
Ordinary delinquents infamously
Living in infamy no matter how soft you try you'll never get rid of me
Matter fact neither one of us/we go to hard
Cops are uh joke

I had fun with there cuffs

Always lie never bluff, its nottuh paradox com-pare youre best stuff with the shit thatI
Trash like an old pair of socks
People say my image ain't tough enough but when you one with the earth theres no need to wear rocks
It matches my rhyming style unorthadox/rockin lacoste
I dont give uh flyin fuck how comforatable ill never wear croc's

Since I already walk around uh lethal weapon
Strapped with uh python in my pants this uh deep throat session
Dime pieces bout to get cockstricted

Though I know they enjoyed the message still got left with a life sentence as my conviction
SoIsaid fuck it
Ima have fun with it
Broke outta prison and made it a tradition
Dont take my confidence for cockiness er think that im conceited

I just have
Such a joyful dream to fulfill so I gotta use these angry skills and drop my bars like I gotta handful of pills

N' thats foreal
On top of that I like to smoke beforeIwork-out/to sore more
Think your words were sharp ours are foreign swords
Braggin bout your different colored bones but ima dawg who gets orange whores

[Hook:i.D]
Expect more to come
From these two cannabis savages
Spitting lyrical adjectives
We whats in the toilet after uh couple of laxatives
Of course only with ""Thee"" in front of it, I promise you homie
We goen fucking make it believe us when we say this, we gonna be famous
To all those who doubt y'all just some fucking atheist, virgins up until we hopped in this game and started raping it
Now the papers on the run n' we the ones chasing it
Bet you could take this chorus to court for killing the beat; n' make uh case of it
N' make a fucking case of it, and bring uh fucking case of it

[Verse 2:Charles E Vera]
I'm lookin for a better day but ey it ain't to late
I just gotta remain constantly trained to obtain whatIneed to maintain
I can feel it in my veins
Ima bout to release my rage
Make sure to read the caution before you come into my cage
Cuz ima cannabis savage it ain't safe im untamed

You think your flo is good well motha fucka mines great, theres no need to debate
Like saying I never hit up hobby back in the eighth grade
With a backpack full of cans and some delinquents ready to spray
Bitch don't complain half this fucking worlds insane
If you are, really all you can do is begin to pray

This is what it sounds like when two geniuses collaborate
Higher then a five star rate the type o' fellas that celebrate 420's date"
Last Bref,Masta Ace,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'alternative', 'jazz', 'blues', 'rock']","[Verse 1: Masta Ace]
I'mma tell you one last time in one last rhyme
And listen closely, cause if my name was Josie
A lot of you pussy cats would be out of the game
Regardless of fame, because I hear a lot of the same
It's not impressive, y'all should be more aggressive
You're too passive. And the rap game is too massive
For niggas to be standing around, trying to be him
Rapping about the same old Benz and BM
Look - I know the way. You can't win as a protege
So throw the crocodile shoes and mink coat away
And come back with flows sharp as a thumbtack
I bump that. In my pickup with the gun rack
Driving down the middle of 95, I be live
Hoping that my song get a buzz like a beehive
I experience heavy breathing regardless of the season for one reason
Hip Hop's full of treason, I'm leaving, yo

[Hook: Masta Ace]
It don't matter how many you sold
Platinum or Gold, hot or cold, yo (Last Bref)
Yall can keep on nappin but if you're out there rappin
It will happen, yo (Last Bref)
It's like death and taxes
You can't get by it, so don't try it yo (Last Bref)
You won't know it's your last left...your last breath
[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
I got a sick caper, smoother than Vick's Vapor
I can break you fast as a nigga that tricks paper
My main focus and purpose is to make sure nobody jerk us
Cause the rap game right now is a circus
I honestly hate rappers, most of them great actors
With songs that couldn't turn me on with eight clappers
And the saddest thing is platinum status is king
If you got the sickest watch, or the baddest ring
You're hotter than three cops in a weed spot with three Glocks
And a search warrant - they thirst for it
I'm a sad soul, probably rap til I'm mad old
And sound worse than D.O.C. with a bad cold
I'll sit in my rocker and freestyle for my doctor
Stand up and shock ya with hella flows like a copter
I'll show a young whipper snapper rapper I'm greater
And then have to rest later, on a respirator, yo

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Masta Ace]
In the game of rap, there'll be none of that coming back
As soon as a nigga drops the ball like a running back
It's over, you could do a song with Jay Hova
Get DMX to sing the hook, nigga look
It happened to the best and it's gone happen to the rest
So I hope you don't think you're immune to the same doom
We can be in two different states or the same room
It don't matter - I'mma hear your career shatter
I personally know a few, tried to show a few
That got back in the ring to try to go a few
It ain't the same, believe me, it ain't the name
It's not the label, you could do a show on cable
You could go to the Source Awards
And pay the Ku Klux a few bucks to drag you around in a blue truck
And rap fans'll walk on by when you're past death and laid out
And just finished taking your last breath yo

Yeah, two thous', new styles, fly as fuck for days
Fry chocolate thai, high as shit for days
Benz 6, V-12, 19's for shoes
Men stick with a team known to squeeze the uz'
Cute girls, jewels, whirlpools and champagne
I ran game, Made Men's on they brain
Aficionado, cigars and Henny bottles
Frijole corazon gatos with hot Glocks though
Twist you like a braid, canary glaze that's made
Baguettes don't shine? Then get it appraised
Perform for MCs with Bentleys and M3s
Burn bomb trees with mamis, sit under palm trees
[Verse 2: Cardan]
Some niggas talk like P Cardy, won't grab three shotties
Let off three bodies, platinum three parties
I move quicker than half of the niggas that's witcha and
Move swifter than cats who Jack the Ripper so
When I say check this, respect this
If you ain't with me and Made Men, get off the guestlist
You see I'm from a place where it's nothing but beats
Nothing but cee-lo where pushers pay the dice off defeat
I got the Rove' out the shop, take the Chrysler off the street
Too much light and too much heat, pick a fight with these freaks
Got a hundred Harlem brothers that'll daze y'all crew
But this is the remix to the déjà vu

Everybody bouncin, steamin up ounces
Ain't no beef, just liquor, and reefer that's cheap
It's cheat or defeat, your girl is quicker to leave
I wanna know can she do dat—if it's you, true dat
Meet me in the back after this track
International, money magnificence
To go against this, I think you know the consequence
I rock Kangols, my link dangles
Got more Cash than Tango, from my mad flows, you know?

Hey yo my shit is fatal, one blow, I make your chin to-ma-to
Don't make me run up in your crib and kill what's in the cradle

Rush my clique through your set, suck my dick, lick it yeah
You the worst I ever heard, cursed with severed nerves
And my words to every verse like feathers to a bird
Rhyme compatible, my nine'll rip the spine outta you
Why should I battle you? You couldn't define one parable
I'm thug animal, Hannibal Lect', real cannibal
Eating that ass like fire and gas, my shit's flammable
Frightening in fact, you know niggas is biting my raps
Writing exactly the same like they reciting my back
Niggas carbon copies, always mocking my shit
But can't nobody stop me, get up on top of me dick

You know why? Cause all the bitches love me
All I need is a beat that's super-bumpin'
And for you, you, and you to back it up and dump it
Put your arms out front, lean side-to-side
They gonna be on you when they see you hit that Dougie, right
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my bro from Morningside
He go by Bubba and he hit that dance like thunder
I ain't from Dallas but I D-Town boogie
I show my moves off now everybody tryna to do me
I leave the functions and all the ladies tryna to screw me
Now you just do you and I'mma do me
Niggas love to hate so they try to screw me
Bitches be stuck to me, I think they try to glue me
I make the party shine bright when it started boomin'
This beat was bubblegum, so I had to chew it

[Chorus]
Teach me how to Dougie, teach me-teach me how to Dougie
All my bitches love me, all my-all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me, you ain't fuckin' with my Dougie
[Verse 2: Yung]
The name is Yung for them dudes who don't know me
I know I'm from the West but I can teach you how to Dougie
I step up in the club and all these bitches bug me
On a nigga dancin' and none of them know me
I hear this crowd screamin' like, aye get it Brodie
So I'm move my shoulders and I take it real low
They like, how he do that
He can Dougie on the flow
And when that nigga stop they like, Dougie some mo
I'm like, a nigga kinda tired then I pass it to the bro
M-Bone, show these cats how to do that
Down South dance that we learned a lil' too fast
And brought it to the hood and, got the whole crew cash

Teach me how to Dougie, teach me-teach me how to Dougie
All my bitches love me, all my-all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me, you ain't fuckin' with my Dougie

Back of the party, I don't really like to boogie
I'm just tryin' to get bent and meet a thick redbone
She do her Dougie and all them bitches hatin'
But I'm about to escape with a bitch and head home
She got her friend so it's a two man and
I run it, run it even if her legs long
She like, you hubby
I think she love me
But I change the subject and I do my Dougie
Cause I don't give a fuck, blow trees, get money
Me, Smoove, Heff in the back with Playboy bunnies
We gonna make em do the Dougie in the middle of the bed
And when I asked for some head the bitch looked at me funny
Duh, bitch you can't tell me nothin'

I just see the Dougie when everybody clubbin'

Run for Cover,Eric B. & Rakim,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Run for cover

[Verse 1: Rakim]
Here I go again, ready to flow again
Better hope my mic don't blow again
Warned by alarms when the mic gets warm
Crowd'll get critical, can't keep calm
Jet for the exit, why hang around?
Words that I found make the mic melt down
If you stay, better cooperate, cuz I  amputate
And whoever don't break, I'mma suffocate
Leave em with asthma, you better pass the
Mic to the massacre master that has the
Power to build and destroy at the same time
So track the wack and the right and exact will shine
Make the beat overheat, but I won't stop
So evacuate the spot when the mic's hot
Switch it from one hand to another
And that's a hint, my brother, run for cover
Because I'm armed, my brain contains a bomb
As if I escaped from Vietnam
Some people label me lethal
Lyrics I made then put beats to
Format, collapse your lungs, twist your tongues
You can't bump your gums off of none of the drums
Words that I made'll create an iller scene
Eric B-eing the fly human being on the guillotine
Hook 'em up to a respirator, cause it's the mister suffocator
What I write its like shoving a mic down your windpipe
Don't let him bite rhymes Rakim write
No mic-to-mouth resuscitation is necessary
No obituary, and nothing left to bury
As he strikes on the same mic twice and then
Cut it on, and I'mma strike again
I meditate off the break, till the place shakes
Then I make rain, hail, snow and earthquakes
Speak the truth, tear the roof off the mother
The stage is stomping grounds -- run for cover
[Verse 2: Rakim]
Evacuate the building, danger, cause I came to explain a
Strategy that'll be tragic automatically
Havin' me to cause another catastrophe
All you gotta do is give Rakim the
Microphone and the crowd'll yell timber
Buildings collapsin', rappers getting trapped in
Areas closed off, no one gets back in
So set up roadblocks, barricade the cross-fade
Put a detour sign on the stage
Hold my microphone as evidence, the weapon I use
And been using ever since
The days in the park when, rap was an art then
Plus I was dominant, determined and dark-skinned
Making it hard to walk the streets at night
For those who talk the weak beats on the mic
Whoever's living large better wear camouflage
Prepare to be bumrushed when I yell charge
Surround by the sound of the beat-down another brother
This is stomping grounds, run for cover
Wheels or foot better not stay put
Whole place shook till the mic's unhooked
Then you got seven minutes to vacate the premises
Lyrics'll echo soon as the break finishes
Don't act wild, single file to the door
No need for an encore, just clear the floor
Cause my mic's about to self destruct
The stage'll blow up when my rhymes erupt
So make sure the place is cleared out and abandoned
Cause minutes from now it won't be standin'
Then send out an A.P.B.: All Poets Beware of a brother like me
Now how many rhymes could your man manufacture?
How many biting MCs can I capture?
Trap rappers who try to run off at the mouth
Take over they route, play 'em out like a cub scout
So leave trooping for MCs at war
And if it's a battle let the crowd keep score
Cause me and the drummer make drama, and that's word to mother

And you can picture like a photo
Music mix, mellow maintains to make
Melodies for emcees, motivates the breaks
I'm everlasting, I can go on for days and days
With rhyme displays that engrave deep as x-rays
I can take a phrase that's rarely heard
Flip it—now it's a daily word
I can get iller than 'Nam, I kill and bomb
But no alarm—Rakim'll remain calm
Self-esteem makes me super, superb and supreme
But for a microphone, still I fiend
This was a tape, I wasn't supposed to break
I was supposed to wait, but let's motivate
I want to see you keep following and swallowing
Taking and making, biting and borrowing
Brothers tried and others died to get the formula
But I'mma let you sweat, you still ain't warm, you a
Step away from frozen, stiff as if you're posing
Dig into my brain as the rhyme gets chosen
So follow me and while you're thinking you were first
Let's travel at magnificent speeds around the universe
What could you say as the Earth gets further and further away
Planets as small as balls of clay
Astray into the Milky Way, worlds out of sight
Far as the eye can see not even a satellite
Now stop and turn around and look
As you stare in the darkness, your knowledge is took
So keep staring, soon you suddenly see a star
You better follow it, 'cause it's the R
This is a lesson if you're guessing and if you're borrowing
Hurry hurry step right up and keep following the leader

This is a lifetime mission, vision a prison
Aight, listen
In this journey you're the journal, I'm the journalist
Am I eternal? Or an eternalist?
I'm about to flow long as I can possibly go

Eric B. on the blades bleeding to death, call the ambulance
Pull out my weapon and start to squeeze
A magnum as a microphone, murdering emcees
Let's quote, a rhyme from a record I wrote
(Follow the leader) Yeah, dope
'Cause every time I stop it seems you're stuck
As soon as you try to step off you self-destruct
I came to overcome before I'm gone
By showing and proving and letting knowledge be born
Then after that I live forever. You disagree?
You say never? Then follow me
From century to century, you'll remember me
In history, not a mystery or a memory
God by nature, mind raised in Asia
Since you was tricked, I have to raise ya
From the cradle to the grave
But remember - you're not a slave
'Cause we was put here to be much more than that
But we couldn't see because our mind was trapped
But I'm here to break away the chains, take away the pains
Remake the brains, rebuild my name
I guess nobody told you a little knowledge is dangerous
It can't be mixed, diluted, it can't be changed or switched
Here's a lesson if you're guessing and borrowing
Hurry, hurry step right up and keep following the leader
[Chorus: Samples]
Follow the leader
Rakim'll say, ""Follow the leader""
Rakim'll say, ""Follow the leader""
Rakim'll say, ""Follow the leader""
Rakim'll say, ""Follow the leader""
Rakim'll say, ""Follow the leader""
Rakim'll say, ""Follow the leader""
Rakim'll say, ""Follow the leader""

[Verse 3]
A furified freestyle—lyrics of fury
My third eye make me shine like jewelry
You're just a rent-a-rapper, your rhymes are minute-maid
I'll be here when it fade, I'll watch you flip like a renegade
I can't wait to break and eliminate
On every traitor or snake, so stay awake
And follow and follow because the tempo's a trail
The stage is a cage, the mic is a third rail
I'm Rakim, the fiend of a microphone
I'm not him, so leave my mic alone
Soon as the beat is felt, I'm ready to go
So fasten your seatbelt, 'cause I'm about to flow
No need to speed, slow down and let the leader lead
Word to daddy...indeed
The R's a rolling stone, so I'm rolling
Directions is told then the rhymes are stolen
Stop buggin' a brother said dig him, I never dug him
He couldn't follow the leader long enough so I drug him
Into danger zone he should arrange his own
Face it, it's basic, erase it change your tone
There's one R in the alphabet
It's a one letter word and it's about to get
More complex from one rhyme to the next
Eric B. be easy on the flex
I've been from state to state, followers tailgate
Keep coming but you came too late, but I'll wait
So back up, regroup, get a grip, come equipped
You're the next contestant, clap your hands, you won a trip
The price is right don't make a deal too soon
How many notes, can you name this tune?
Follow the leader is a title/theme/task
Now you know, you don't have to ask
Rap is Rhythm and Poetry, cuts create sound effects
You might catch up if you follow the records E wrecks
Until then keep eating and swallowing
You better take a deep breath and keep following the leader
[Outro]
Rakim
The R
Rakim'll say peace
Follow the leader
Follow the leader"
Shoot Me Down,Lil Wayne,['hip hop'],"[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Open up your hearts, people
Page one, chapter one, verse motherfucking one
Yeah, uh-huh
I'm drinking hot tea, bitch
Feel me

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, now if you let me, you won't regret me
Shit, if you let me, you won't forget me
Remember? And if you don't then ponder
Hold up, bow! bow! there's a reminder
I ain't kinda hot, I'm sauna
I sweat money, and the bank is my shower
Haha, and that pistol is my towel
Haha, so stop sweating me, coward
And I would die for ours
Ride for hours, supply the flowers
This is history in the making
Now shut the fuck up and let me make it
[Chorus: D. Smith & Lil Wayne]
Please don't shoot me down, 'cause I'm flying
I'm flying, I'm higher
Please don't shoot me down
'Cause I'm flying, I'm higher
I swear this tea is at a real good temperature right now
So am I, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I spit Alcatraz bars, I know
And D-boys is the only Alphabet Boys I know
Got a .380 on my waist and Rambo back home
No more bandana 'round my dome, bandana in my right pocket
Bitch, I'm grown, fuck what you on
Now, watch me stand on the world as I sit in a throne
And if I jump, I'ma fly and look into the eagle's eye
And see, I am nothing like you, why?
Bitch, see, it gets me how nothing gets me or get to me
And if you shootin' for the stars, then just shoot me
But your bullets don't reach Mars
Paws, claws, because I'm a beast, I'm a dog
I'll get you, my picture should be in the dictionary
Next to the definition of ""Definition""
Because repetition is the father of learnin'
And son, I know your barrel burnin', but—
[Chorus: D. Smith]
Please don't shoot me down, 'cause I'm flying
I'm flying, I'm higher
Please don't shoot me down
'Cause I'm flying, I'm higher
Ayy, I'ma talk to my daddy

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Papa, I did it to 'em! I'm a bastard!
And I'ma do it again, like ""nigga"" backwards
These niggas backwards, but they behind us
Now, watch me get high, like, time's up
Nah, D., bring the drums back
And watch me hit 'em where they lungs at, like that
I get respect 'cause if I don't, I'ma take it
I see your boys hating, and I see your girls naked
Drum, sound like a naked gun, switch clips with my thumb
Then, I pop another clip in and aim at his vision
'Cause Wayne is his vision, 'cause Wayne is the mission
I'm aiming at a mirror

[Chorus: D. Smith & Lil Wayne]
Please don't shoot me down, 'cause I'm flying
I'm flying, I'm higher
And I've done it before
Please don't make me do it no more
Please don't shoot me down
'Cause I'm flying, I'm higher
Watch me soar
Where the fuck is my guitar? Now roar
Ohhhhhhhhhh
Please don't shoot me down, 'cause I'm flying
I'm flying, I'm higher"

Out here slanging on this blade prayin that I don't get cut
By these police making raids, jumping out and checking nuts
Cutting balls down to crumbs, babbage weed is in my lungs
Nigga stick me for a bag, I'mma shoot him in his ass
I'mma show 'em who the boss, when you niggas gonna learn
When you cross in this game, then yo ass will get burned
Wait my turn, or my time rock for rock, for the dime
Takin' Fed chance after chance, but I got to dance
To the rules of this shit, that's why I keep a revolver
How the hell you robbers gonna rob the robber?
Boy I'm gonna scald ya with pistol slapped cross mouth
Reachin in ya pockets, and take yo money out
Mane you now whats goin'~ you got cheese, I got dope
For da 900th strong, I got p'z, I got coke

Niggas robbing, niggas banging, niggas slangin' down here

Quarter bird what's the word? For you dog, it's da low
Sellin me babbage weed but you want the purest snow

Ounce of cane mixed with sugar and some killas strapped wit gats
Always trying to be slick, you done stepped in some shit
You done broke ghetto laws, you done tore ya fuckin drawes
Wit me boy, yeain't know, cause the streets never lies
Walk right up on yo ass, shoot right between the eyes
You be stankin' with the flies
While I'm ridin on chrome, wit yo bitch, smokin' dro
Fucking all in yo home, while ya kissing on her lips
She be sucking on my dick, flippy flop on the paint, system booms as I dip
Through the streets of the hood, North Memphis Hollywood
Represent it to the max
I'm just out here stating facts
Trying to stack me some pape's, got my foot on you snakes
I'm gon squeeze off some lead for you niggas that are fake

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3]
You could duck from the tech, out tha Escalade (caddilac)
Once I get my cheese on a roll, then I must get paid
If you want to come against me dawg, bring your whole brigade
But you shall get sliced, like a throat, with a swisher blade
Sippin' on some Paulie Musson, like some sweet Kool-aid
Strapped with me, an automatic gun, don't you violate
Nigga said 'he'll snitch on me dawg', I didn't hesitate
Caught him, in the projects one day, sent him to his grave
Playaz wanna come through the hood, but forgot the fear
Knowing it ain't all to the good, you could get it here
Wrong place, at the wrong time, calling Slip, let's go
Dope fiends keep me up with them and my pockets swole
Eyes red as hell, cuz I ain't had a lick of sleep
Snorted a quarter ball, so that I could stay on my feet
Treat any bitch, just as same as a nigga too
If you trusting hoes in this game, you'se a damn fool

You can't see me (yeah)
But check this out I was talkin' to this, um, nigga, the other day
And he said ""Yo Dre, you know female MCs don't blow up that large in the hip hop world"" (D-O double to the G)
And I said ""ya trick nigga, ya better ask somebody else"" (yeah)
""Cause the Lady of Rage is in the motherfuckin' house"" (Ay)
Can you dig it? Yeah
But anyway far and beyond all that bullshit
My motherfuckin' nigga Snoop Doggy Dogg is in the house (Ay)
And we gon' drop some shit
Hit 9.2 on the Richter scale, can you dig it?
So Snoop, what we want you to do is come in
Set off a little freestyle before Rage comes in (Biatch!)
And let's get this motherfucker jumpin' off
Can you dig it? Yeah

[Freestyle: Snoop Dogg]
Damn, look what the wind blew in
From the depths of the sea
It's the S-N-double-O-motherfuckin' P
In the place to be
And this time I came with the homegirl R-A-G-E
So let me begin
To slowly start to flow but let me grab my cup of gin
Then look, the crook, it's me
Who be the D-O-double to the G
I fly through the sky like a dove once again
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg -- can I blend, men?
Then send more than you need
Can I have some bags so I can roll up the weed?
I take a glance, in other words a chance
I spot myself up on the dance floor taking a dance
I got a bitch on my dick, some niggas talking shit
But ain't no need for me to call my clique
Cause DPGC be the clique that the D-O-double G belongs to
I wrote a song to the track that's provided by my nigga Dr. Dre
Now slowly start to slide into a trance, move around
And get hooked, lady, by the sounds of the Pound
We got the hits that just don't stop and they don't quit
Cause once again, Snoop Dogg is 'bout to drop some shit, bitch
I can't stop, I pop
Never flip, I flop
Snoop Dogg got the shit that don't stop
Rock on with your bad self
It's The Lady of Rage at the top of the shelf
So push the button and run because
Snoop Dogg is on the mic and I'm a dope motherfucker
Yeah, you best ask somebody
About the man with the la di da di
I got the shit that makes your body shake
It's time for you to stop, pause, and awake
Open up your eyes and stay composed
It's one nine nine four -- I still don't love hoes
I treat them the same -- it's like the boom bam
It's Snoop Dogg, I'm on the mic; can I slam?
Yes you can, and you just don't stop
C'mon, say what, and you just don't stop
Uh, yeah, and you just don't quit
Hey yo Rage, could you please drop some gangsta shit

Cause I'mma break it down to the nitty gritty one time
When it comes to the lyrics, I gets busy with mine
Busy as a beaver, you best believe-a
This grand diva's running shit with the speed of a cheetah
Me the, lyrical murderer
I'm serving em like two scoops of chocolate
Check out how I rock it
I'm the one that's throwing bolos
You better roll a Rolo
To find out I'm the number one solo
The capital R-A -- now kick it to the G-E
I'm bringing things to light but you still can't see me

Ain't no doubt about it, I'm the undisputed
So what you want to do is back on up
I'll tap that butt, wax the cuts, pass the bucks
So put your money on the bread winner
I kick lyrics so dope that the brothers call 'em head spinners
I got the tongue that is outdone anyone
From the rising to the setting of the sun
Or the moon, I consume the room with doom
When I hear the kick of a 808 bass...boom
Boom, bam, Goddamn!
I'm hitting so hard you could say it's a grand slam, dunk
Punks get broken off for chunk when they feel the funk
Of the rhythm (fresh) that I give 'em
Let it hit 'em, split 'em, did it -- now I'm rid of 'em, yeah
I put that on my unborn kids
Rage in effect so you know how it is

Now ever since my debut, I've continued to lay you
Flat on your back from the raps that I spat, spit
Oh shit, I'm the shit
You can't get with the Rage, then tough titty
I pity the fool that gets
With the lyrical murderer cause my shit is rude
You wanna get with the wickedness?
With that big-bodied girl that's kicking it
Ripping it apart like Jason
You'll be chasing a dream like Freddy
Are you ready for the cream de la creme?
I'm steam pressuring those who ain't measuring up
I keep competitors stuck
In the muck with they butt up
What, you want to nut up like cashew?
Don't you know that I will mash you?

Fake Manolo boots straight from Steve Madden
He patterns his-self, the rap JFK
You wanna pass for my Jacqueline Onassis, then
Hop ya ass out that S-Class
Lay back in the Maybach, roll the best grass, I ask
Have you in your long-legged life
Ever seen a watch surrounded by this much pink ice?
Look but don't touch, motherfucker, think twice

We got bottles full of Arme, mamis in Manolo
Bags by Chanel or Louis Vuitton logos
All attracted to Hov because they know dough
When they see him, whips be European
If you're a 10 chances you're with him
If you're a 5 you know you riding with them
Sick with the pen, nigga -- no physician in the world could fix him
No prescription you can prescribe to subside his affliction
He's not a sane man, he's more like Rain Man, twitching
You can't rain dance on his picnic
No Haitian voodoo, no headless chickens
Can dead his sickness, no Ouija board
You can't see me, dog; nigga, ya CB4

Pink diamond necklace, strawberry wrist
Please excuse yourself, you're very sick
Don't confuse me with Marbury out this bitch
Run up on me at the light, you could lose your life
Motherfuckers must be smoking they la la la with crack
Forty-five gun smoke, choke off that
Let's get back to the music, I ain't with all that
Plus the Feds tapping my music -- y'all get all that?
I'm the public industry #1
Public industry #2 is my whole crew (R.O.C.!)
Now I ain't down with who like me or who like you
That's gay, I ain't into liking dudes no way
But get a pen, I can tell you pricks my plans for the future

Hallelujah,Leonard Cohen,['alternative'],"[Verse 1]
Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing ""Hallelujah""

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 2]
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[Verse 3]
You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to ya?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 4]
I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[Outro]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah


[Additional Lyrics]
Baby, I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah"

Hi, my name is B.o.B, and I approve this message

Now everybody wants some presto magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Ahooooooo, I got the magic in me

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
These tricks that I'll attempt will blow your mind
Pick a verse, any verse, I'll hypnotize you with every line (Ah!)
I'll need a volunteer, how about you, with the eyes? (Right there)
Come on down to the front and stand right here and don't be shy (Bobby)
I'll have you time travellin', have your mind babblin'
People tryin' to inherit the skill, so they askin' me
Even David Blaine had to go and take some classes and
I see Mindfreak like ""What's up man, what's happenin'?"" (Mindfreak!)
So come one, come all, and see the show tonight (Ha)
Prepare to be astounded, no ghost or poltergeist

Stay on the road, so I call my mama when I got time
I hit the stage, go insane, then jump into that crowd (Ah)
See, see, when I rhyme, I flow on the beat like pitta-da-da
See, I deceive ya with my intergalactic ether (Yeah)
I sing just like Aretha, so respect me like I'm Caesar
I kick it like Adidas, flowin' sticky like adhesive
Be cautious, 'cause what I be on'll leave ya with amnesia
I break all the rules like Evel Knievel (Yeah!)
It's a spectacular show, 'cause my heart pumps diesel
So whatever you sayin', it don't entertain my ego
I do this everyday, Hocus Pocus is my steelo

When Im Gone,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'alternative']","[Intro]
Yeah, it's my life
In my own words, I guess

[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
""Daddy, look what I made!"" ""Dad's gotta go catch a plane""
""Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?""
""I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself""
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby, ha
[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 2]
I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
""You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?""
""Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more"" ""Daddy, you're lyin'!
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine!""
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
""Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it wit' ya!""
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin' 'cause, man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', ""You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late.""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on and I'm singin'
[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 3]
Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow and ""Thank you all for comin' out""
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
""Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!""
""But baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?""
""I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'.""
""But baby, wait!"" – ""It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, kid, keep it real.""
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, ""Die, Shady!"" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say
[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing

No Rain,Blind Melon,"['rock', 'alternative', 'blues', 'pop', 'metal', 'jazz']","[Verse 1]
All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
I like watching the puddles gather rain
And all I can do is just pour some tea for two
And speak my point of view, but it's not sane
It's not sane

[Chorus]
I just want someone to say to me
""I'll always be there when you wake""
You know, I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today
So stay with me and I'll have it made (I'll have it made)

[Verse 2]
And I don't understand why I sleep all day
And I start to complain that there's no rain
And all I can do is read a book to stay awake
And it rips my life away, but it's a great escape
Escape
Escape

Some call that a problem but I call it a gift
Xzibit make the whole continent shift (hell yeah)
Invadin your territory in a blaze of glory
A soldier story, livin off nothin but instinct
Bitch niggas continue to floss and lip-sync
And I'mma just continue to flow, while rockin the boat
Probably smoke three-hundred thousand dollars in dope
Don't make my Desert Eagle barrel touch the back of your throat
Always approach niggas that's known for killin your folks
Be surprised who could turn around and bust on y'all
Catch your mother or your sister comin out of the mall
Bang holes through they coats and they Macy bags
No retaliation you basically runnin with fags
In these streets, you only good as your last transaction
Funny style, and these niggas ain't laughin
Y'all got it all fucked up in zero-zero
Think life is a video for ""Last Action Heroes""
Face the price you pay for the games you play

Judge and jury, don't get your case dismissed
When I get pissed and smash through the makeshift
Uplift, dump this, make your shit knock
Hypnotical hardrock that don't flop
It's the best thing crackin my nigga
Lot of rappers talk of flashin the trigger but don't ever deliver
From the home of the toe tag, lowriders and body bags
Earthquakes police with automatics and nerve gas
Learn fast or get left behind quick (yeah)
You testify, you get wrapped in plastic (hell yeah)
Xzibit turn your SUV into a casket
Melt your body parts in a tub full of sulfuric acid
Drastic measures we take just to get by
For all the shit you gotta go through to get high
Stand by, do or die for the WestCoast!
Wanna fuck with Xzibit but can't come close motherfuckers

Recognize all men are not created equal
I'm lethal, all y'all faggots remain see-through
Only the kid from ""The Sixth Sense"" can peep you (DEAD PEOPLE!)
When I get through the World'll be a better place
A little Jesus Christ mixed with some Leatherface
Go find some punch to spike, find some dope to lace
Pull a pistol from my waist, nigga reach for space
Smack the taste out of your mouth if you talk shit
Or hit so hard to the chin it make your back flip
My transcript number one up in this conference
It's nonsense, all y'all niggas want is conflict
Only associate with pros and the convicts
Xzibit roll up in the spot with a bomb bitch
And then bounce with a couple, motherfuck a tussle
You never have enough muscle to stop a nigga hustle

One Beer,MF DOOM,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'alternative', 'jazz']","[Intro]
I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why shouldn't it be true?
I get a kick out of brew

[Verse]
There's only one beer left
Rappers screaming all in our ears like we're deaf
Tempt me, do a number on the label
Eat up all they emcees and drink 'em under the table
Like, ""It's on me—put it on my tab, kid""
However you get there, foot it, cab it, iron horse it
You're leaving on your face, forfeit
I crush the mic, hold it like the heat, he might toss it
Told him tell 'em they stole it, he told her he lost it
She told him, ""Get off it,"" and a bunch of other more shit
Getting money, DT's be getting no new leads
It's like he eating watermelon, stay spitting new seeds
It's the weed, give me some of what he drooping off
Soon as he wake up, choking like it was whooping cough
They group been soft
First hour at the open bar and they're trooping off
He went to go laugh and get some head by the side road
She asked him autograph her derriere, it read:
""To Wide Load, this yard bird taste like fried toad turd
Love, Villain"" — take pride in code words
Crooked eye, mold, nerd, geek with a cold heart
Probably still be speaking in rhymes as an old fart
Study how to eat to die by the pizza guy
No, he's not too fly to skeet in a skeezer eye
And squeeze her thigh, maybe give her curves a feel
The same way she feel it when he flow with nerves of steel
They call the super when they need their back, uh, plumbing fixed
""How is only one left? The pack comes in six!
Whatever happened to two and three?""
A herb tried to slide with four and five
And got caught like, ""What you doing, G?""
Don't make 'em have to get cutting like truancy
Matter fact, not for nothing, right now, you and me!""
Looser than a pair of Adidas
I hope you brought your spare tweeters
MCs sound like cheerleaders
Rapping and dancing like Red Head Kingpin
DOOM came to do the thing again, no matter who be blingin'
He do it for the smelly hubbies
Seeds know what time it is like it's time for Teletubbies
Few can do it, even fewer can sell it
Take it from the dude who wear a mask like a 'tarded helmet
He plots shows like robberies
In and out — one, two, three — no bodies, please
Run the cash and you won't get a wet sweatshirt
The mic is the shotty: nobody move, nobody get hurt
Bring heat like the boy done gone to war
He came in the door, and ""Everybody on the floor!""
A whole string of jobs like we on tour
Every night on the score, coming to your corner store
[Skit 1]
There, it is done
Now that the representative from South Africa has been
Mind programmed
All of the world leaders on earth are under my control
And when they meet tomorrow in special session
I, DOOM, shall be voted: Master of the World
My plan is foolproof, but just in case
And what about snow?

[Outro: Skit 2]
Now you keep your eyes open
When I tell ya, start snappin' (Oh yeah, sure)
Uh, ladies und gentlemen
I am risking my life to tell you with, with great concern
That I must warn you, I, I
You must listen
Many among you, have, have had their minds taken over
(What a story, start snappin’)
DOOM, gosh, I wish I’d brought my autograph book
(Your attempts at humor bore me) Right, lead-head
You’re weird
Why is everyone staring at us?
(Aw, I should have realized, we must look like freaks to them)
Relax masseur, just do your thing
(Get a good grip on my—)
What? Why, I’ll bend your read-out meter for ya, you little
(Hey, knock it off, Ben)
What’s the matter? (Oh, Ben)
You’re nothing but a chicken-head

'Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own
And I'm feeling so alone

Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums, some call it nice
I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise

Another urchin snaps and left dead on his own

For some strange reason it's now feeling like my home

Looking like Caine but nah this is a not a movie
Cell phones up, tell them girls to shoot me
All I hear is ""yea bitch that's Dom can you excuse me""
Leimert Park legend, I used to bump that Snoopy
Had some iceberg and I used to want that Coogi
Back in 97 man my uncle wore the Gucci
And he rocked Polo, and he wore the Stussy
I am no marine but these niggas do salute me
Catch me on Pico, I am like the Lucy's
Give it to em raw, I am like the sushi
I hate how rappers use the term ""fresh"" so loosely
Bad ass nigga, I am like Boosie
But that just might have went over yo head like a kufi
If I was a DJ, I would be Brucie
Or any of them niggas Biggie shouted out on ""Juicy""
Sometime I get chose, but you can say I'm choosy
And if you want to keep her then you should not introduce me
25th hour, that was introducing
Roll wit the winners girl cause I ain't into losing
Talking Crenshaw king, that's what we be cruising
Get my point across, so I never have to prove it
Squab wit a nigga, I ain't into shootin
This is not the army but them niggas is recruiting
Hardwood floors, but we don't be hooping
When them boxes touch touch down, then we gon' move it
Maybe out to Compton, just like St. Louis
Sugar 16's, nigga watch how I do this yeah I studied this game
I'm a student, but now everyday they call my name and I be truant
UCLA, I'm a bruin
And all them plans you made, I'm a ruin
Your whole rap career, it is ruined
And everybody say ""damn Dom you shouldn't do it""
I'm the number one pick, that's Ewing
No one said I would make it, but somehow I always knew it
And I'm running this game, that's stupid
I write like Eric, yeah that's ruthless
These hoes so Ashanti, that's foolish
I'm good on the track, Carl Lewis
All these rap critics always asking for some new shit
Tell em go buy it and they never do shit
I fuck with FutureStreet, but dawg this my new shit
You say I'm bout to really B-L-O-W shit

In 1997, I wrote my first rhyme
""I wanna marry you"" is what I told my first dime
Had my first drink, rolled my first dime

I used to cop a lot, but never copped no drop
Hold mics like pony tails tight and bob a lot
Stop and stick around, come through and dig the sound
Of the fly brown 6-0 sicko psycho who throws his dick around
Bound to go three-plat, came to destroy rap
It's a intricate plot of a b-boy strapped
Femstat cats get kidnapped
Then release a statement to the press, let the rest know who did that
Metal Fist terrorists claim responsibility
Broken household name usually said in hostility
Um... what is MF? You silly
I'd like to take ""Mens to the End"" for two milli'
""Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!"" That's a audio daily double
Rappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble, yo
Watch your own back came in and go out alone, black
Stay in the zone—turn H2O to Cognac

Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime
Get out my face, askin' ‘bout my case, need toothpaste
Fresher mint, monkey-style nigga get mentadent
And dope fiends still in they teens, shook niggas turn witness
Real mens mind their own business

Known amongst foes for flow without no talking orangutans
Only gin and Tang
Guzzled out a rusty tin can, me and this mic is like yin and yang
Clang! Crime don't pay, listen, youth
It's like me holding up the line at the kissing booth
I took her back to the truck, she was uncouth
Spittin' all out the sunroof, through her missing tooth
But then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce
So I turned it up faster than a speeding knife
Strong enough to please a wife
Able to drop today's math in the 48 keys of life
Cut the crap far as rap
Touch the mic, get the same thing a Arab will do to you for stealing

It’s fun to do bad things like rhyme about handguns
If any problem pop off
I’ll Joe Pesci any fool while drinking that Popov
That’s cause I’m a Goodfella
Stay up out the hood hella much now
But punch clowns if they touch down
While I’m eating lunch now
While I’m eating a burger
Metaphysical spiritual lyrical murder

[Kool A.D.]
The ill ’96 manifestible third eye
Abstract backpack vegan skateboards etc
Rap hella much in a busted ass Jetta with Coretta Scott King
Rap bridge on a duet with T-Pain and Stephen Hawking
I’m not joking, stop jocking, stop talking
Shut up, hush up
Please, shut the fuck up
Shut up, dude, shut up
Das Racist is the new Kool G Rap
Peep us at the Grammies
We’d like to thank G-chat
We’d like to thank weed rap
The best rapper is B Real
Jokes, it’s us, come on, be real
Second Latin rapper to like the Beatles
But on the real yo they swearing I’m blacker than Cheadle
Like Don King playing Donkey Kong Country at his cousin’s house
You don’t even know what it’s about
[Heems]
This is panic attack rap
Eating four flapjacks
Trap raps, let 'em free, they always come back to me
The Internet told me that that’s called love
I’m on the Internet cause I’m an Internet thug
Himanshu
Yes I’m in control, man
Pos vibe emanator
Yes I got my Soul Tan
Soul Shine
Soul Glow
So-so Po-Mo
Catch me on the South Side
Kicking it with Shlohmo

[Kool A.D.]
Kicking it with Gary Soto
All the cholos saying “Mira el joto”
Just because I rock the second hand Versace
Wash me, watch me
The second hand couldn’t even clock me
You couldn’t see me like a Cuban playing hockey
Cracker in the chocolate, that’s human Pocky
Papa look stocky, Mama look chalky
Me I look a little something like a young Shock G
Words come through me like I was a walkie-talkie
All I do is open up my mouth and just rock, see
You, you are not me
Me, I am possibly
Everything plus everything that is not me
Jokes, that is not T-R-U-E
Are you understanding everything, do you got me?
Catch me in the trees where it’s shady like Lockheed Martin
Sparking in the shade of the trees in the park, B
Hark! the angels stay singing in the dark
Like the rainbow in the Ronnie James Dio joint
Hit it from the back court
Like it was a three point
I don’t give a fuck, I’m a duck to a decoy
No trust them white face man like Geronimo
Tried to go to Amsterdam they threw us in Guantanamo"

Why I gotta ask what that TUDOR cost?

You know, B.I.G. and Pac, you know to get it hot

Waiting for the chance to get to tell her
I'm the one she should be with
She's popular wit all the guys, so innocent in my eyes
I can see her in my life, she woulda had the world if she were mine
But see, she had other plans, I couldn't understand
Her and her stupid friends, Varsity's biggest fans
Never forget the day she laughed and walked away
And I couldn't stop her, I guess she had it all

She had it all figured out when she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
'Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen, the prom queen

See you never know how
How everything can turn around

They loved her fancy underwear, every boyfriend, every year
She tried to keep them entertained
When they can hardly remember her name
She did everything she could just to make them laugh and treat her good
She finds herself alone, askin' herself, where did she go wrong
She didn't realize she chased the type of guys
That don't believe in ties, tryin' to apologize
Never forget the day she left and walked away

Now I'm in love with these two chicks
I don't know which one to pick
My feelings for them both are getting thick
Now am I wrong cause I don't want to lose none of them
Am I confused cause I don't want to chose one of them
It's no doubt I think about my honeys everyday
It's no question I show my honeys love in every way
Possible I once took my shorty to the hospital
She cut that hand on glass plus I love that ass
Short and sexy lips always wet see
I go downtown cause it's fresh plus she lets me
Rub it the right way like Johnny Gill would say
I'm glad you feel that way sometimes we just chill and lay
In the sack I rub her back when we're resting
It was love at first sight my confession
She know who she is can't say her name
Cause if I do I won't be true to my game
Word up

[Hook]
I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to Moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I don't want to let none of them go
Yo I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to Moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I don't want to let none of them go
[Verse 2]
Now, my next one she lives out of state
I mean the sex and conversation situation is great
Everytime I hit town we make a date
And when it's time to chill my shorty can't wait
Now I can still remember when we first met eachother
Exchanged numbers promised we won't forget eachother
Goes to work and school
That's cool
No doubt that's why a nigga went that route
No form foot locker
Shorty lookin proper
She's out to get me can't stop her
Know I had a lover
Yo still went for her
Even copped a bed and kicks on the strength of her
Yo chatted talkin bout see you later
From that moment on I knew that I had to date her
Couldn't conversate long
Shorty had to go back to work
Something inside said that will work

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I thought I couldn't live with chicks cause they be too demanding
Especially the ones that's never understanding, like
Who was that? Where you goin? Who you out with?
Them same niggas I make moves and I shout with
Don't let these niggas in the street gash your head up
Like they can do better than me
Plus I'm fed up
I had to tell my main chick that one time
Thinking to me short
She thought that I'm
Some clown nigga she can scream on and talk to
I had to run her down the line this ain't no walk through
Now who the fuck you think you talking to chick
Your complaining's making me sick
Understand man I tried to do my thing
Yo understand I played the puppet on the string
Like I say everyday be careful my friend
Good things always come to an end
So yo
[Hook]

[Verse 4]
See the moral of this is that I really do care
But I'm not afraid to go there
Very unselfish and yes I do share
You could have your bitch but you gets nowhere
Word, she began by saying try after try
It's a done deal
Now I'm singing bye bye
All I tried to do was keep you satisfied
Never dealing with no others I try
Too many threats kid, gotta let her go
Always in your corner
Got to let her know
As I grab my coat and painfully walked out
Hands about to give, we talked out
I'm feeling pain as it came to an end
I said to shorty I will always be your friend
Now if you ever need me I will be right there
I ain't going nowhere, for real

Book one, strategy, tactics, techniques
Look dumb, but massively notice the weakness
In all them, gotta shoot only if necessary
Homie vest is very real if enemies carrying heavy steal
Beware the thugs who ain't scared of blood or jail time
When Aryan nations ain't having integration
We so blind, the beauty of life
Was when my mom said nigga you could be Christ
I wasn't old enough to hold my dick and pee right
""Jesus"", what is he like?
I picture him standing with diamonds on him
Little different from the way my mommy saw him
Practice your aiming, physical training in difficult terrain and
Test your endurance, try to keep your stamina banging
Splitting dutches up, strap up, the armies is school
Teaching smart ways to kill, I'm thinking Gandhi was a fool
The chronic's a fool, got me thinking out loud, fuck it
Sleep on my drunkenness I'll blow your brains out

And feed him to the rats in the back of the P's

Teach y'all women how to hold the family down in case something happens to it's fathers
Protect the children, grab revolvers
The women plays important part of our life force
So what we fight for, my heart goes to you, beautiful wife in war
Uh, and listen more and talk less
Watch all and trust none, demand your respect
And be ready to die for what you believe in
And ride all the time not just when convenient
Justice and freedom, wisdom and understanding
We the lost children of Israel in this western world region
You ain't a man, you a coward if you can't support the girl you put a seed in
Strong rule the weak, but the wise rule the strong
It's more to a war than just getting it on
Conceal your form, cover your tracks, stay prepared

Instead of slipping through
You bit off more, much more than you could chew

[Chorus]
You could not swallow it
No, baby, you're not ready, slow down
And take the time to evolve
You could not swallow it
No, baby, you're not ready, slow down

[Verse 2]
We had a lot to learn
Table manners and grace, how to wait your turn when
Time came to clear your slate
You had too much, had too much on your plate

[Chorus]
You could not swallow it
No, baby, you're not ready, slow down
And take the time to evolve
You could not swallow it
No, baby, you're not ready, slow down
[Bridge]
Take your medicine and crawl before you walk
Think it through before you open your mouth to talk
Be an advocate of joy
Find your little heart's desire and
Follow it

[Chorus]
Whoa, baby, you're not ready, slow down
And take the time to evolve
You could not swallow it
No, baby, you're not ready, slow down
Baby, you're not ready

You could not swallow it
No, baby, you're not ready, slow down
And take the time to evolve
You could not swallow it
No, baby, you're not ready, now, slow down
No, no, no, no

[Outro]
Don't be afraid, this is your year
It's gonna be alright, you're a performer
Just take your time, but not too much time
No, no, no, no"

There's a still in the street outside your window
You're keeping secrets on your pillow
Let me inside, no cause for alarm
I promise tonight not to do no harm
I promise you, baby, I won't do you no harm

[Chorus]
And we're caught up in the crossfire
Of heaven and hell
And we're searching for shelter
Lay your body down
Lay your body down
Lay your body down

Watching your dress as you turn down the light
I forget all about the storm outside
Dark clouds roll their way over town
Heartache and pain came a-pouring down
Like hail, sleet and rain, yeah
They're handing it out

And we're caught up in the crossfire
Of Heaven and Hell
And we're searching for shelter
Lay your body down

Tell the devil that he can go back from where he came
His fiery arrows drew their bead in vain
And when the hardest part is over we'll be here
And our dreams will break the boundaries of our fears
Boundaries of our fears

Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Lots of people talk, and few of them know
Soul of a woman was created below, yeah

Run 'round, sweet baby, Lord, how they hypnotize
Sweet little baby, I don't know where you've been
Gonna love you, baby, here I come again

Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair

[Hook]
There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

[Verse 1]
I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this
Gotta be somethin' for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it
Signed, sealed, delivered, for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault them, ‘cause I probably did it too
Because of you, feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light
But they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I want to be the one to make you happiest
And hurt you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close
To the most high
Regardless of what happen, on Him let's rely
[Hook]
There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

[Verse 2]
It's important we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night, for you in the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light
If Heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call
So I pray every day more than anything
Friends we'll stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family, love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth havin' you work at annually?
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine
[Hook]
There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side, oh, darling
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

[Verse 3]
It's kind of fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you shit pop when it's time to
Thinkin' you fresh, suggestin' beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence
The time we committed love, it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you
But as my equal, it's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'ma lead you
And whatever's right I'ma feed you
Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da
Yo, I tell you the rest when I see you; peace!

""In my lifetime""
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
It's the thought of a ride that make my eyes wide, I'm caught up
I'm tryna make all of my dreams materialize, so I sorta
Say my goodbyes to the straight and narrow
I found a new route, you 'bout to see my life change
I make the means justify the ends
I make the cream, materialize keys to a Benz
And so I'm rollin'
For now, holdin' down the fort, who's controllin'?
The ground's gotta blow 'em, yep, y'all shoulda told 'em
Uhh, my first felony's approachin'
Copped my first key, took a freeze, now I'm frozen
I bought a black MAC, I'm outta control
Losin' bankrolls on blackjack, you gotta know
It always crossed my mind
That Feds be tappin' the lines like Gregory Hines
Still on the phone, discussin' my biz like it could never be mines
I know the price, know the risk, know the wrongs and the rights
Still my blood flows ice, it's just my life, uh

What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
""In my lifetime""
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
""In my lifetime""

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I'm like the bass with the ass, splashin' cold cash
The Big Willie get you chilly when I pass, brrrrrr
Is it, just a mirage all these girls thankin' God?
Is this, world my world? Am I the star of stars?
Baby, pimped out, I'm gettin' too large and smokin' cigars
All chicks is hollerin' about Jig-ga, the whole city's buzzin'
Wasn't checkin' for me a dozen or so, months ago
Now I'm all they know, I'm a person (yeah)
Lettin' the Cristal's breathe at the Barnacle Bar
Under my sleeve, vernacular, 50 G's
I'm talkin' big cheese, you gotta be down to dig these (uhh)
Uhh, give me a rush like you wouldn't believe
My head's about to bust, acceleratin' what drives me
Hope I don't gotta die to see, see, I can't lie to me
I know the price, know the risk, know the wrongs and the rights
Still my blood flows ice, it's just my life

Uhh, from the beginnin', see, we never seen the endin'
Runnin' up in all the women, all the linen, all the jewels, huh
We sported Pele's, gold diamonds and Pirelli's
Sports cars, the good life'll give you a belly
But that's cool, as I zone in the Al Capone, watch me
'Cause the Medusa's head on Versace turned me to stone
Now my poems just ain't poems, they bloody when I recite 'em
Bones get disconnected like the phones
Now, I'm a hardened criminal with game
Like the Garden, all my penpals life controlled by the warden
Still the thrill makes me blind to the fact
I could do real time, I'm a prisoner of my crimes
Know the price, know the risk, know the wrongs and the rights
Now I'm incarcerated for my life

This is a favourite short saying of mine
Two famous lines, time flies
Especially when you listen to rhymes
Words become time and time is disguised
Around the world in 80 seconds through a sentence
Experience is the mother of all adventure
Who knows the unknown? Where will you end up?
Question yourself, who, when and what
I tell you this much, it's up to every one of you
Learn from the past or the future will punish you
Power flows to those who remember
Memory comes from words, words come from letters
This is Mic Club's primary premise
We tell history, we don't let history tell us

Obvious with the occasional glare from the natives
Call 'em back tell my mama I make it
Not complacent with the life style
Feels good but it's hard to crack a smile
When the ones you came up with not around
Roll a joint after pickin through the pound, whole perception done changed
Funny how a three hour flight can make ya life change
Tight things I be thinkin on
When I'm driftin in and out of herb clouds
Hangin on every second of the moment
So you can feel all the memories I come home with
And for those that miss me, I'll be back don't trip in the 'Maro with the shift kit
Ocean side, doors open wide tryin' not to be sea sick
Plottin in the tropics thinkin' how I'm gone run this

I'll have niggas scrappin' the skin off yo face
With the same shit they peel the potatoes
I thank the Lord for my blessings and I'm glad he gave us
The willpower and reflexes of Larry Davis
You don't wanna see my block formin'
That's a hundred and one doggs
And I don't mean the ones with the spots on 'em
We're respected highly
Cause you don't need to practice gymnastics to catch a body
Me and money's like Whitney, next to Bobby
If I bring all my niggas, I'll need an extra lobby
As soon as you ain't around jake
You get your ass whipped for chips
Now that's the real definition of poundcake
I got the crown, snake, and you can tell when I'm shopping
Cause when the mall stampedin', you feel the ground shake

You get your head cracked and niggas don't run and tell
It's like we sell crack, get caught, head back to jail
We on that ""fuck the police"" shit, we livin' in hell
You better guard your grill homey and stand your ground
These bullets burn, they hit whoever's standin' around
I never learn, even after I took a couple shots
I just got me some Band-Aids and bought a couple Glocks
Had to go on a rampage and hit a couple blocks

You gotta blast me, yo, cause the Louisville
Will have yo head lookin' like the top of a pistachio

Got every boyfriend thinkin' their girlfriend's a nasty ho
My heart laughin' it's small
Maybe it's cause my grandpop dropped right after the ball

You can call me Whitley, I go to Hillman
Listen, I'm the baddest in the school, the baddest in the game
Excuse me, honey, but nobody's in my lane
When you was in New York, you was fuckin' a Yankee
I was fuckin' with base, I was pitchin' to Franky
These bitches so cranky, get 'em a hanky
M-mommy, I'm cold, gimme my blankie
Flyer than a kite, I get higher than Rapunzel
Keep the Snow White, I could buy it by the bundle
Step your cookies up 'fore they crumble
Don't be actin' like the Cardinals and gon' fumble
'Cause I'm a Steeler, fresh up out the dealer
All the dope boys gon' feel her
Flow so sick I need a healer
Fuck is my MAC concealer?
I be out in Queens on the back of four-
Whee-whee-whee-whee-whee-whee-wheelers, I'm a big deal
That's why I get more head than a pigtail
Put some ranch out, I’m gettin' the munchies
I think I'll have a rap bitch for my entrée
'Cause they be thinking they can spit, spit-shine my shoes
You know I keep a bad bitch, let me sign your boobs
I'm the only thing hoppin', like a kangaroo
I mean the only thing poppin', like a can of brew
Listen, you should buy a sixteen, 'cause I write it good
That 808 woof-woof, 'cause I ride it good
And bitches can't find they man, 'cause I ride it good
I'm the wolf, where is Little Red-a Riding Hood?
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Now, if you see a itty bitty piggy in the market
Give that bitch a quarter and a car, tell her, ""Park it""
I don't fuck with pigs, like ""as-salamu alaykum""
I put 'em in a field, I let Oscar Mayer bake 'em
And if you see a itty bitty piggy in the market
Give that bitch a quarter and a car, tell her, ""Park it""
I don't fuck with pigs, like ""as-salamu alaykum""
I put 'em in a field and I let Oscar Mayer bake 'em, bitches

Wow
It's like I just single-handedly annihilated, you know, every rap bitch in the building
Like, like, I'm Nicki Minaj, Nicki Lewinsky, Nicki the Ninja, Nicki the Boss, Nicki the Harajuku Barbie

Like, give it up! It's me!
I win! You lose Hahahahahahaha
Oh, shit! Hahaha, yo

Lames is your whole set, Gs don't recognize y'all
Independent acrobatics, make that loot somersault
Remembering my license and restrictions in my mom's car
Came a long way, but I don't got time to be
Sitting at the dock of the bay, wasting every second
Money can be made out a rhyme, I can do it on the dime
Kick the shit out a beat until it die, call CSI, I...

Lemonade-level vodka, backgammon, playing Keno
Musical mafia
Loaded bases, bring my team home, I'm the great Bambino
Roulette wheels in the casino
Fat Macs skimming off the top
But that's the game we in, what you gon' do about it, ha?
Sacrifice and hit the independent? Probably not
They not like me, that's why they don't like me
Me, I'm likely in my trailer, in between scenes
Got the feature girl from the video full of weed
Break your foot tryna kick how I kick it
Kill yourself tryna live how I'm living, Spitta!

Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up

[Hook: 50 Cent & Lloyd Banks]
Hands up! Shorty, when you party with me
We goin' way past quarter to three
(I say hands up!) I'm good in the VIP
I got my hammer right here with me
(I say hands up!) You know when you party with crooks
You gotta learn to respect the jux
(I say hands up!) Everything ain't cool as the fame
And this shit ain't as sweet as it looks (I say hands up!)
You know I'm puttin' something on me
Right before I leave outta the car (We came to party)
You go tough talkin' at me
You gon' leave out the club wit a scar (We came to party)
We pop bottles like it's all free
'Fore I leave, I'mma buy out the bar (We came to party)
You gon' order whatchu want, it's on me
I'm a G, take a look at a star (We came to party)
[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
It feels so good to live sucka free
I'm soakin' it all up while your girl's suckin' me
It mean the world to her, it's nuttin' but a nut to me
Look miss, get a grip or let a mothafucker be
I'm a rap star, who 'posed to be ridin' around in that car
Two in the front, in the back got the plasma
This ain't a free ride, you gotta have the gas ma
I wouldn't buy a chick a pump that got asthma
And I'm busy so I move a bit faster
You can't tell me yes if I don't ask ya, huh
I'm a bastard, damn near chauvinist, hand over the plastic
Cause they wanna see ya man go in the casket
Rule number one: keep ya gun or get ya ass hit
And that's it, lights off and ya body stiff
By the same niggas you used to party with

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Yea
I cruise through the strip, 22's on the whip, new Ruger on the hip
Thousand dollar outfit, never stooge never slip
Follow rules or get whipped, nigga move or get hit
I don't care who's on the strip
It ain't only the Ferrari now, the jewels got 'em sick
Now it's 2006, I need a new bottom miss
It's a'ight, they can talk, I'm amused by the pricks
I'm the news out the bricks, nigga, who's hot as this?
I bet the mansion and the swimming pool got 'em pissed
I ain't a cuddler, I fuck the drool outta chick
My niggas ice-grill, but it ain't the same
They don't see the faces, they just see the chains like
OOH when ya get 'em, they don't know you with me
They probably think the bouncers at the front door frisk me

Master Thesis,Canibus,"['hip hop', 'alternative', 'r&b']","[Verse: Canibus]
This is the Master Thesis underneath the deepness
Come to micclub.net where you can read this
Run a plot on the map in hyperspatia
From the Society for Scientific Exploration
Color is vibration, vibration is sound
Sound resonates through the mouth, check it out
What I say vibrates no less than 9 ways
South, South East, West, South West, East
North, North East, North West
And the black and white images fade to grey sound waves
Trap my adversaries like a mouse in a maze
With a bewildering array of lyrical display
The Best of Bis orbitally rearranged
Monoatomic elements with adept intelligence
The highest professorship, my English etiquette
Compels me to not say it if I can't spell it bitch
My circularized third eye sees all
Atlantis was surrounded by 4 sea walls
I read one-fourth of the Library of Alexandria
Before it was burnt to the floor
I wish I could've learned more
About the shapes of the sacred geometry they used to draw
They were new millennium but Euclidean in form
Ancient in many ways but not nearly as old
Carved from Egyptian gold, moulded in Assyria
With processed Beryllium by the quintillion
They cooked on symmetrical stoves
With my logo etched above the hole where they inserted the coal
And they barbecued birds to the bone
And thhey burned incense in a Buckminster Fuller type dome
I talked to Mr. Fuller over the phone
And he said he had a contract to rebuild Rome
Said he didn't want to do it alone
I told him I was busy writing poems but I'll think about going
The process was slow and the dough was low
But I took it as the perfect opportunity to grow
Plus I ain't never travelled that far from home
But I heard about the beauty of Cydonian snow
Neon green grass, statues made from translucent glass
I'll be crazy to pass
I like Algerian Jazz
The blue twilight band that plays, tunes from a laser black sax
It sounds so laid back, it helps me relax
I brought the album after seeing K-Pax
Oh how I miss my nautilus
I was told pharyngoamygdalitis did not exist
You have a modest case of scaphocephalous
I prescribe some neo-gothic antibiotics
Words concocted from the lyrical locksmith
Deadly as 10 droplets of Ricin toxin
From every angle the competition gets boxed in
As Dr. C indoctrinates his doctrine
Translate the English alphabet to the omega text
Life is now and death is next
Post bond out on bail from the belly of Hell
Communicate through diatonic and pentatonic scale
These dark side tales might affect sales
I set sail and hunt down erect sperm whales
Use the aphrodisiac to get a female
Called Ginger, tie her up and drink her ginger ale
Grand Marnier for me, scotch on the rocks for you
Your vocab is smaller than a cockatoo's
In the studio with James Lipton
Reminiscing about the script that was written before the beginning
All of a sudden the boos turned into applause
My jaw's stronger than the Caninde Macaw's
Can't even count the bars I've expended so far
Don't want to rap no more, it's been so long
I wish the clock would hurry up and tick
I'm out in the bush and the sticks humping a 100 clicks
Dr Scholls gave me a good fit
Me and him went to school together back in '86
When I was really ill
Putting Planck energy in a rhyme the size of a Tylenol pill
You wanna laugh now and cast your belligerent doubt
Show you what poetry is really about
The side effects will make you pass out
Followed by skin rash, itching, diarrhoea, nausea and dry mouth
You want a time out? You better spit a rhyme out
Before the community of real MCs die out
College students say to me, ""You ain't smart""
Record label A&Rs say, ""This ain't art""
These are the contents of the Covenant of the Ark
Listen to my chest beat, tell me this ain't heart
You gotta be as obsequious as the Disciples of Jesus
This is my Master Thesis"
Poet Laureate,Canibus,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative']","[Produced by Kemo]

[Verse: Canibus]
Yo, Houston to Earth, watch the Ripper crucify you with verse
My urethra to ya uvula quenches your thirst
Put your flames out with dry desert dirt where leopards lurk
Lock your soul down with an esoteric weapon search
Strap a bomb to one of your labels record clerks
And activate it as soon as they get to work
Ring the alarm, red alert, nigga it gets worse
Bypass security networks with select words
Megahertz make nebulas reverse till your head burst
Call the press first and ask them who got the best verse
Give me the respect I deserve
If you are what you eat, it's obvious I can't eat what I'm worth
Y'all niggas eat pussy and burp
The other half of y'all suck dick till your jaws and ya neck hurt
When you address me nigga end your sentence with, ""Sir""
Critics went berserk they ain't even heard my best work
See I broke into the mind by
Quietly going by their eardrum walls and hotwired they skulls
Yeah I earned the name Canibus, but what did it cost?
Battle rap is nothing but a serendipitous whore
Niggas probably like, what the fuck he dissing him for?
Yeah he dissed me first but you was never informed
I'm one of the top five nigga, my shit is tight nigga
You heard it right nigga, I rock mics nigga
But the limelight isn't where I belong
The top four don't even look in the mirror no more
If they did I'd be in the mirror looking back at 'em
Ready to grab them, kidnap them and put them on my album
I rip jackers, Rip the time/space fabric
Loop the future with the past tense looking for patterns
Eradicate Africans that sold Africans to Saxons
And forced black men to pay taxes
Attack a wack bitch with counter tactics
Split your bullet proof chassis in half with a rapid Gatling
Keep firing at you till you trapped in
Non-combatants scramble for helicopter extraction
While I'm back at Fort Bragg bragging
How I tortured them faggots and stabbed them with Rip the Jacker daggers
Slay dragons with old passages from black magic manuscripts
I found in the cabinet written in Arabic
Translate to characters one by one like Arafat tarot cards suggest
I make terrorist threats through your stereo sets
Various anthrax carriers sending sarin to the press
With an imaginary address, Cani's the best
Untraceable, your pictures unpaintable, canvas that's wet
Let me dry you off wit some of this fire I spit
26 years old nigga look how I spit
A microphone fiend since I was like 14
My Cuban uncle used to sell cocaine, OK?
I'm reloaded, you fucking wit the wrong MC
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease to the whole industry
Potent as Hennessey that was distilled in Tennessee
One shot scrambles your memory indefinitely
Nowadays a hundred bars ain't impressive to me
You stepping to me nigga do it intelligently
You wanna battle or you wanna fucking wrestle wit me
You ain't better than me, you just got an obsession wit me
Canibus hybrid, the cake icing of rhymeness
As I grow older I get colder like the declining climate
Of earth's environment, I'm entirely tireless
Rhymes come from my higherness of wireless dialect
Scientists from Sirius B designed my specs
Astrally project during heightened sex, chakras connect
Doctors inspect what they can't possibly interpret yet
That's why they revert to threats
They curse and throw fits
They like immature earth cadets looking like Captain Kirk in a dress
Lyrically I step on you, rip on you
Then I defecate what I just digested on you
I'm better than you, I'm better than you, I'm better than you
Just to get the chequered flag I'll put the pressure on you
Put the extra effort on you write a motherfucking letter to you
And your editors too, threatening you
Detective check your mail and your messages too
You can take this verbal slashing that I left as a clue
Execute the type of wickedness the devil approves
Which basically means I can do whatever with you
I'm a rap music mutant with a cool name
Misconstrue fame, but I spit butane
Blue flames out giant CO2 tanks
Demagnetize memory banks, enhanced, advanced
One of a kind like modern man's retina scans
Quick as a glance and flickers from kerosene lamps
What you want me to break first? Your jaw or your grill?
What type of spit you want from me? Sparkling or still?
Study law, Yale draw up my own deals
So the longer they resist me the stronger I feel
Spread the ganglia from Tanzania
To the flats of East Anglia, give up, you can't keep up
The man eater in a wife beater
Spreading Typhoid Fever through mic receivers with light reverb
Type in the right keywords, I might emerge
Takes a really nice nigga to incite these nerds
Niggas wanna see the gully in me, keep fucking with me
Never under pressure, I keep the pressure under me
Burn the weed
Drop a freestyle on the internet then watch niggas burn the CD
Upload a picture of your mum getting DP'd
I'm one size away from 13, believe it she peed
I'm the illest and its gonna be that way forever
Word of mouth is good but a mouth of words is better nigga
No body gets sicker than the Ripper"

OK, it's time to get started, don't want to but the forces forced me
With incantatory allegory they translated for me
U-M-L-O-U-T: Umlaut
That's the reason I bend vowels when I spew from the mouth
Spit drooling out a very grotesque view at best
Burn through desks at the University of Budapest
Sitting in a room with a windowless view
Concentrating, looking at you
Freeze frame frozen at the very moment
The wormhole opens, you know Canibus has spoken
The circumference of a third eye so vibrant
To me, Ezekiel's Wheel was just a spare tire
My epithelial genetic fiber
Was forged in the protoplasmic fires in a black geyser
The explosion can described as a white iris
When the absolute began, I don't know where I was
I must have just been a piece of micro dust
That's why I the fuck love mics so much
My micro, macro robotic rap flow
The Magna Carta of the entire Rap world
Mayflower 2002 Phase 1
Adapt to the pressure gravity has laid on my lungs
The theory of communication, Claude Shannon's dissertation
With a makeover in camouflage make-up
Light waves bend to the weight of Bus
Mics buckle with white knuckles, metacarpals crush
Acid reflux all over your face, you fuck
Grab heart with bare hands, squeeze and spray blood
You iller than me? Give me a call
W-W-W-N-A-M-I-ORG
Dear boss, you mind if I share my thoughts?
Psychotherapy is expensive, can you share my costs?
In a cushioned room with leather doors
Handwriting experts take a look at the letters I draw
Excessive roundedness, no space between words
Excessive cross-outs, it must be my nerves
Rhymes that vaporize, disablize and destabilize
Pray to God, say, ""Goodbye""

You will never be iller than the Canibus man
You could be male, female, black, white
Fuck the details, I rip a nigga with a rhyme till he screams help
Any nigga I told to kneel knelt
You haven't the slighest idea what a real MC is about
You need to be yourself, you can't sound like nobody else
And you can't do all of the beats yourself
You can't do it without the streets help
Niggas on the block that blast the boom box till the speakers melt
That's how I was brought up, big fat elephant balls what
I'm a knucklehead with big walnuts, small frame extra large guts
I'll do anything to a nigga if he pushes me hard enough
I use to rhyme like all day
I mean little nigga spittin till my jaws felt sore with pain
I use to train with myself in the mirror
Like ""Mirror mirror on the wall, tell me who's iller""
How you like that? I use to say it just like that
Maybe I should copyright that, I'll be right back

Sorry to leave you hangin
I write things down quick cuz I ain't takin no chances
Thats the difference between you and me
You a wanna-be, and I'm an MC

Now in this rap field, I got a lot of confirmed kills
I put niggas through drills to prove if they got true skills
You coulda sold millions, but if you ain't got 100 bars shut the fuck up
At least don't talk to me, cuz I ain't hearin you
If you that ill, give me a hundred bars, I'm darin you
I definitely ain't scared of you
I go to war cuz I'm prepared to lose
Just as long as I get to damage you
Take the mic from you, then put a knife in you
That's what I like to do, make you lose a pint or two
If you a lion I'm a tiger too
I could be as nice as you, but if you a snake I'm a viper too
Look you in the eyes and lie to you
Thinkin about all the possible ways to kill you while I smile at you
You like to get fly nigga I'm a pilot too
Don't even try to get deep cuz I'm a diver too
Don't try to fit in my shoes cuz you can't
Nobody can fuck with the Canibus man, understand?

Yo, yo, yo, my mouth is mechanically mechanized
My verbal weapon fires a whole clip of rhymes before you can get off one round
Can-I-Bus will buss ya, apply enough pressure to crush ya, I pulverize mother fuckers
Leave MC's laid out like hurricane debris, 15 Megatons of TNT
The overseas block busta, bustin up blocks like the Tiguska meteorite to hit Russia
Comin from the underground I discovered
A ground underneath the ground before underground bunkers
Dedicate it's blunkers, deeper than the labrith
Conductin excavations of the matrix
Living in uninhabitable places, craters of a desert like oasis with a cydonian faces
As barren as Las Vegas, as barren as the wombs of women who use artificial insemination
As barren as Utah's Salt Lake City basin, as barren as ancient Egypt before irrigation
A five-star chef makin mouth-watering creations with blood stains on my apron
Put the heads of wack MC's in my oven and bake them
Then garlic bread sticks in their eye sockets and taste them
It's not really that odd, when you consider part of the ancient culture loves to eat dogs
Feline cats with their claws, paws and all
Caucasians eat frogs, African-americans eat the hog
Hindus in India will kneel to the floor and worship cows and rats as gods
I raise the odds, spit rhymes towards Mars and beyond to the nearest binary star

Straight through his eyes, straight to his heart
I'm still alive, how did I make it this far?
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go
Every single night I pray
And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found
I guess it's just a warrior's way, uhh
[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
This is a song, for my warriors (a warrior song)
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior (definition of a warrior)
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of my own beatin' drum

[Verse 2: Nas]
Like King Nasir fightin' the British regime
I can't cope my existence is hope for younger teens who lost and they broke
Earlier this year I buried my queen in a gold casket
Your mother's the closest thing to God that you ever have kid
I'm askin', what would you do at your own mom's funeral
Wanna pick her up out of it, this can't be real
Tellin' my daughter grandma's gone, but I can't keep still
I can't go on, responsible for so many
Her last days at the hospital
Visits from family I'm tryin' not to bust shots at niggas
Wishin' death on other nigga's mothers ain't right but why mommy
She raised me in the projects alone
Her untimely exit from her, heavenly body
Got me ready to body somethin' quickly
Can't be happy, fuck a party she can't party with me
So your apologies are burnin' ya own souls
To the kids with no parents at home, grab a hold

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
This is a song, for my warriors (a warrior song)
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of my own beatin' drum
[Verse 3: Nas & Both]
Fight 'til the fight is over, for my peoples I die see
When you thought they were soldiers they turned out to be nobodies
I think they out to get me, helpless was livin' sinful
If you was me all this pain I'm feelin' would bend and killed you (I'm a warrior)
It only made me stronger
But in my head it gets darker who wishin' evil on ya
Sometimes I wish I was dead
But I took heed to the cause (I'm a warrior, yeah)
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go
Every single night I pray
And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found
I guess it's just a warrior's way, uhh

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Nas]
This is a song, for my warriors (a warrior) to my warriors
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior (definition of a warrior)
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of my own beatin' drum
This is a song, for my warriors (a warrior song)
Warriors, baby, KrucialKeys! Braveheart y'all
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior (definition of a warrior)
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of my own beatin' drum

[Outro: Nas]
This to all my warriors, who breathe with the heart of a lion
To everybody that lost their mother, their father
Rest in peace moms!
My mother's last words: Never give up
A true warrior, who raised me in the hood, in a war
Love ya girl, y'know keep marchin'
Yeah yeah yeah, you never give up
To all my warriors, haha
Braveheart, Braveheart
Definition of a warrior, ha"

Hookin' up with Dyablo

What's going on, pretty girl (To all those pretty girls, pretty girls)
Hey (This one's for you)
I wanna talk to you, girl, come here (This one's for you)
Let me tell you somethin' (This one's for you)
Check this out

Chorus: MC Magic
Something about you, baby (Something about, you)

Drives, me, crazy
Something about this pretty girl
Blows, my, mind
[Verse 1: MC Magic]
Si tu supieras lo que siento
Cada vez
Que me pongo a pensar en todos los momentos
All the good times we've had, me and you, you and I
Hot summer nights, making love in July
The only girl that didn't give it on the first night
Una mujer incomparable, I'm a love her life
Me captivaste with your ways and all the things you do
My pretty girl
I gotta make it work with you
Tell the world, tell your girls, and your family
Con este amigo, te prometo, you're my everything
Cause nobody's ever made me feel the way you do
I just dropped you off
Already miss you
Chica bonita, sonrisa, sincera
I wanna be with you hasta que me muerda (That's right)
Let's make a pact
And always be together
With you by my side, girl, I'm down for whatever

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Dyablo]
Solo una
Es en la vida, el amor, te toca el alma
Un sentimentio limpo, que hasta el dolor, te calma
Siempre estuvistes conmigo, en la buenas
Y las malas conmigo
Solo Dios y tu son mi testigo
Inorvidables momentos, que juntos pasamos
Y los problemas mas fuertes, juntos areglamos
Incomparable mujer
A ti yo pertenecer
Contigo, yo fallecer
Juntos como un solo ser
Una preciosa mujer, que siempre esta a mi lado
Que en el dolor y las tristesas, me has acompanado
Quieres mi vida, te le entrego, si es lo necesario
Pues, en mi mente y corazon, te tengo, yo del diario
Te has incrustado tu en mi corazon (Mi corazon)
Como un implante, eres mi salvacion (Mi salvacion)
Eres mi todo, mi razon de ser
De la creacion, la perfeccion, una bella mujer
Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Lil Rob]
I know I was the kind of man you wanted, when I met ya
You asked me to sign your tetas and feel your piernas, showed me your lengua
Estas, why not, don't let nobody tell you different
You're into it, don't like to waste time, love to get intimate
Predicaments, I've got myself into a few of them
Stick and splits, that's what I do with 'em, and then I was through with them
You think I want that type of girl
Walking by my side
One last wish, it was parle'in' at homeboy's ride with Homeboy
Getting high
I don't think so
I need a good woman who can cook
And a girl so fine, even other girls take second looks
And a girl who makes me miss her
I just can't wait to kiss her
When I get home, she whispers, in my ear the things I wanna hear
Likes to have a good time and
Try new things
That keep a smile on her face, no matter what life brings
I'll make her happy
She'll make me happy
If she can
You think you can, then baby doll, I, wanna be your man

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said: ""I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm""
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, ""We want prenup! We want prenup!"" (Yeah!)
It's somethin' that you need to have
‘Cause when she leave yo' ass, she gon' leave with half

You don't want a dude to smoke, but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So stick by his side

No homo, you rocking wrong; rest in peace, my styrofoam
Now, they wanna know what I be on
Get the fuck off my dick, my cock, my bone
Bi—Big money, my pockets long, New Orleans, I got my home
And they got my back—pause; no homo, no maricón
Smoking on that private-grown, it put me where I belong
All about my cheese: cheddar, mozzarella, provolone

From secondhand cocaine powder—I know it sounds absurd
I never tooted, but it's in my veins
While the rest of the country bungies off bridges without no snap-back
And bitches, they say they need that to shake they fannies in the ass clubs
They go the other route, turn each other out, burn each other out
Where a bona fide nigga like me can't even get no backrub these days
Ain't that bleak on they part?

Freaky me, freaky you can't help but be a-roused
'Scuse me, Lord, lustful thinking, but that's the way we was brought up
Sneaking to watch Playboy at night
We all must be caught up in worldly ways
Chemistry between boys and girls
Is a lot like when we went to the woods and laid with the squirrels
During P.E., we'd be exploring each others privates
Hunching with all our clothes on until we felt excited then (Aaaah)
Oh, now it's on from here on out
Put yo hands in the atmosphere if you know what I'm talking about
Now if too harsh then walk on out and I'll see you on the next song
They call it horny because it's devilish, now, see, we dead wrong

Moping around and wondering where she stay, saw her last that she lay
Give it another day, I say, but the Lord, he taketh away
Now give it back, Lord, 'cause that's like backboards without the rims
Me and my auntie was tight like Southwest
Before the pinks moved in
Like the niggas who owned the liquor store, crack cocaine, pimps and whores
Living up on this earth before a nigga like Daddy was born
But they be making it seem that my music and crime are a team
But I'm speaking the truth not dreams
So what in the fuck they mean, my lyrics ain't clean?

Every time I go to get up I just fall in pits
My life's like one great big ball of shit
If I could just put it all into all I spit
'Stead of always tryna swallow it
Instead of starin' at this wall and shit
While I sit, writer's block, sick of all this shit

This is it, last straw, that's all, that's it

Blow this building up, I've concealed enough
My cup runneth over, I done filled it up
The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts
You think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts
Well, I'ma show you what, you gon' feel my rush
You don't feel it, then it must be too real to touch
Peel the Dutch, I'm about to tear shit up

Yeah, sit up, I'ma tell you who I be

All I need's a line
But sometimes I don't always find the words to rhyme
To express how I'm really feelin' at that time
Yeah, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
It's just sometimes, it's always me
How dark can these hallways be?
The clock strikes midnight, one, two, then half-past three
This half-assed rhyme with this half-assed piece
Of paper (*rip*) I'm desperate at my desk
If I can just get the rest of the shit off my chest again
Stuck in a slump, can't think of nothin'
Fuck, I'm stumped up, oh wait, here comes somethin'
(*Crumples paper*) Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out
New pad, crinkle it up, and throw the shit out
I'm fizzlin' now, thought I figured it out
Ball's in my court, but I'm scared to dribble it out
I'm afraid, but why am I afraid?
Why am I a slave to this trade?
Cyanide I spit to the grave
Real enough to rile you up
Want me to flip it? I can rip it any style you want
I'm a switch hitter, bitch, Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter
I'ma sit until I get enough in me to finally hit a
Fuckin' boiling point, put some oil in your joints
Flip the coin, bitch, come get destroyed

They hate me, see me and shake like a chain-link fence
By the looks of 'em, you would swear that Jaws was comin'
By the screams of 'em, you would swear I'm sawin' someone
By the way they're runnin', you would swear the law was comin'
It's now or never, and tonight is all or nothin'

He said he'd be back, he pinky promised, I don't think he's honest-""

Don't believe me? Watch, I'ma win this race
And I'ma come back and rub my shit in your face

Liver bad, he wouldn't live long, that snatched my dad back
Guidance? I never had that, streets was my second home
Welcomed me with open arms provided a place to crash at
A place to study math at, matter of fact, I learned it all
Burnt it all, this music is where I bury the ashes at
Flash back, not having much, not having that
Had to get some challah bread so you can holla back and
Holla at my Jewish lawyer to enjoy the fruit of letting my cash stack
And just in case a nigga gotta use his rat-tat-tat-tat-tat
Own boss, own your masters, slaves
The mentality I carry with me to this very day
Fuck rich, let's get wealthy, who else gon' feed we?

I'm in the lab with Ab, I got the pen and pad
My man T-A-S-H take it to yo' breastplate
It's the Mighty Mos Def, complete the trilogy
Just shot myself a dime, see, are you feelin' me?
Son, I'm wicked and nice when I'm on facility
Lemme take a sec to review what I wrote
(Mos Def, and it sound far fetched?) — OK, it's dope
Let's record this ('Cord this), they gonna award this (Award this)
And all area crew is gonna applaud this {*clapping*}
And when we step to the plate, Pah, it's flawless
My man T-A-S-H with styles glory great
Great, great great, great great
[Verse 2: Tash]
Up next, we got KaTash with that West Coast rhymin'
Bombin' niggas with the style as dangerous as mountain climbin' (Ahhhhhhh)
'Cause the Alkie words I'm spittin' be twistin' while you listenin'
Plus I'm in this motherfucker with the Likwit coalition (woo)
That'll leave you in position, twisted backwards like yoga
While you starin' down my throat like, ""Is he drunk or is he sober?""
(Who knows?!) All I know is Tash got flows (Woooo!)
And got the technique to get the ladies out of they clothes
I been overly exposed to the forty-oh's and chickens
So I'mma keep it pumpin' 'til the beat stop kickin'
Or 'til the plot thickens, 'cause this is how we do
CaTashtrophe, Mos Def, and the brother man Q!

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
What's up, Tash? A-yo, Tip can't call it
Chill as Mos is Def and you Alkaholik (Right)
I'mma be surfin' at, thing that's worth dealin' (Uh-huh)
Hypodermically, shoot up your feelin' (Uh)
Figuratively speakin', of course, now (Right)
Old and greediness seekin' it's course, now (Uh)
What we gonna do? (What?) Eradicate them
Shoot them from the jam, they be diseased phlegm

[Hook: Mos Def]
Tash Love — are you ready to rock the mic?
Q-Tip — are you ready to rock the mic?
Mos Def — are you ready to rock the mic?
We got the universal style you got to like!
And ain't nobody steppin' up when we got the mic
So turn the A.C. up 'cause it's hot tonight!
And 'til the bright early morn', we be rockin you alllllllll
Don't stop, the Body Rock!
[Verse 4: Tash]
'Cause I'm next to flex
And I'm technically advanced to turn you on like cybersex
So in less (Uh) than two sec's (Uh), I blind MC's like Thomas Dolby
With the Science that'll leave they braincells fryin' slowly (SCIENCE!) So slowly I flow with this express written consent
From the undergroundin' niggas, Coast II Coast I represent
'Cause gettin' bent — I do
But I'm doper than sherm
Plus the way I put it down could burn the perm off Big Worm
So peep this private screenin' of the Last Action Hero
That be freezin' rappers dead in they tracks like Sub Zero (Zero)
'Cause Rico ain't no joke, I eat yo' flows and yo' beat up
Rappers even feel my presence when I'm home with my feet up

[Verse 5: Mos Def]
What you, skied up or treed up?
Relax and pull a seat up, make your landlord turn the heat up
Got the opposition shook like Tiger Woods about to tee off
So niggas, there's no competition with the clear Mos Definition
MC's screamin' now for years
Can't rhyme without they mom's permission
You just a young'un comin' out, gettin' gassed to run your mouth
Wildin' on the Runabout, Baby Pah, you comin' out
Barkin' that you want a bout, but son, you know the comeabout
When Mos Def blow up and, you don't nuttin'
Don't you know nuttin'?! My crew go huntin'
We keep it on the norm, then we transform somethin'
And while we do it, you bounce to it
The cops wanna stop the Body Rock (But don't do it)
[Verse 6: Q-Tip]
DY-NO-MITE!!! Like Jimmy J.J
Slobbed down pen-ny, somewhere in L.A. (A)
Now we got to bond like Voltron (Tron)
Tash — you the bomb, Mos — you the wonton (Ton)
Re-peatedly, I must drop on thee (Thee)
A-B-S, I bust down, facility (Ty)
T-R-A-C-T is the MC (C)
It's the LL, inside the place to be (Be)

[Hook: Mos Def]
Q-Tip — are you ready to rock the mic?
Tash Love — are you ready to rock the mic?
Mos Def — are you ready to rock the mic?
We got the universal brothers you got to like!
Now, ain't nobody steppin' up when we got the mic
So turn your A.C. up 'cause it's hot tonight!
And 'til the bright early morn', we'll be rockin' you alllllllll
(Don't stop, the Body Rock!)

[Outro: Mos Def]
All my people out in Queens, you know you're hot, you say..

All my people out in Brooklyn, and you know we're hot, say..

Motherfuckers, that's why I ain't playin' with their ass, that's what's gon' happen to them niggas
Motherfuckers done fucked up, man
Ain't it some shit like that?

[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm only rhyming where the drums is at
Y'all niggas think y'all slick with that bullshit—bump that
Y'all pay V for flowing to the beat
Not for what he know that got hoes hoeing in the streets
That's for him to know and for they to never find out
About the kidnap, blind fold, and the blind mouse
The coroner report say he simply signed out
Oh, and I know, y'all wanna see a wino? Bring the wine out
Cat with a dead mouse is how he catch a phrase, and pause
Plays with it, kill it, and eat off it for days, get it
Whoever ain't get it ain't supposed to
For standing still close to, bandits will ghost you
No shoot, Sherlock, I don't know how they do on your block
Out here we rock on to the sure shot

Aw—Ya'll motherfuckers
Playin'

V catch the beat too ridiculously
People think he study levitation's true mystery
Had a pal named Ed Leedskalnin until he got him for his sweet 16
He said Ed be Wilin'
Rumor has it things got violent
He clobbered him and broke the fuck out
But he ain't try to rob him
I told her don't tell your man, that's the trouble with these chicks
Next experiment: Twelve strands from double helix
No I haven't seen Kes, Neelix
""Oh, yeah? Just you stay away from her with those lyrics.""
Please—ain't nobody fuckin' after her
I'm out of here as soon as I fix the flux capacitor
And OH, and speak to V in a proper manner
Before he stabs you and put out all types of propaganda
Stop the slander, chop the hand of a thief
And cut the mouth off of who ever come out they teeth
V sell time to an inmate
And then tell him a rhyme for the hell of it to demonstrate
They know who's the renown beat critic
And do a street lyric like, ""That's a neat trick!""
Off on a tangent, they ain't got a cent
Supposed to went to management, and spent it getting bent
Sparky, I had enough of your malarkey
For one, don't mark me and who you calling Darkie?

""Oh hell, there he go again talking that shit""
Bend corners like I was a curve, I struck a nerve
And now you 'bout to see this Southern playa serve
I heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
Then I heard it's not what you make but how much you spent
You got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried

Or will it give a fuck about what others say and get gone?

Droppin lethal raps on wax so I can count stacks
I keep a heavy knot, got a spot on every block

Now I'm back and all the ladies still cheer for L

Starin' at the world through my rearview
Just lookin' back at the world
From another level, you know what I mean? Starin'

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Multiple gunshots clear the block, the fun stops
Snitches is callin' cops, people shot, nobody stops
I wonder when the world stopped carin'
Last night two kids shot while the whole block starin'
I will never understand this society
First they try to murder me, then they lie to me
Product of a dyin' breed; all my homies tryin' weed
Now the little babies crazed, raised off Hennessy
Tell me, will my enemies flee when they see me?
Believe me, even thugs gotta learn to take it easy
Listen, through intermissions, search your heart for a plan
And we turnin' bad boys to grown men, it's on again
I give a holla to my niggas in the darkest corners
Roll a perfect blunt, and let me spark it for ya
One love from a thug nigga
Rollin' with a posse full of paranoid drug dealers
To the end, my friend, I'm seein' nothin' but my dreams comin' true
While I'm starin' at the world through my rearview
See, I'm seein' nothin' but my dreams comin' true
While I'm starin' at the world through my rearview
[Hook: 2Pac]
They got me starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly
And all my motherfuckers
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly
And all my motherfuckers

Now you see him, now you don't
Some niggas be here for the moment, and then they gone
What happened to 'em?
Well, let's see, it seems to be a mystery
But all I know I never let the money get to me
Stay down like the truest
Thug Life until I check out this bitch, I thought you knew this
Who is gonna catch me when I fall or even care to?
While you thinkin' I see you lost up in my rearview
Hear you is down with them Outlawz
Outcast, left far, I'm through like southpaws
But still we keep mashin' until our dreams come through
Starin' at the world through my rearview
[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now, I was raised as a young black male
In order to get paid, forced to make crack sales
Caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
In the cell, countin' days in this livin' black hell
Do you feel me? Keys to ignition, use at your discretion
Roll with a 12 gauge pump for protection
Niggas hate me in the section, from years of chin-checkin'
Turn to Smith & Wesson war weapons
Heavenly Father, I'm a soldier
I'm gettin' hotter 'cause the world's gettin' colder
Baby, let me hold ya: talk to my guns like they fly bitches
All you bustas best to run, look at my bitches!

“Do dreams come true?”
Still starin' at the world through my rearview
I said, now I know the answer
“Do dreams come true?”
Starin' at the world through my rearview

[Hook: 2Pac]
They got me starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly
And all my motherfuckers
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly
Nigga, Kadafi say!

[Verse 3: Kadafi]
Back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
Nine-six for Glocks
'Cause fiends hittin' up blocks with street sweepers
Bless myself when knowin' rules to these streets
Somethin' I learned in school
On some Million Man March shit for the peace
True that, only one life to lead, a fast life of greed
Criminally addicted, infested since a seed
We all die, breed, bleed like humans
Towns run by young guns, Outlawz and truants
Shit's deep, turn eighteen, burn my will when I go
Burnt my body with my shotty, or choosin' my dough
So while you reminiscin' all nights out with the crew
Smoke a blunt for me too, I'm starin' through your rearview

[Outro: 2Pac]
Hahahaha, you ain't knowin' what we mean by starin' through the rearview
So, since you ain't knowin' what we mean, let me break it better understandin' the world…The world is behind us
Once a motherfucker get an understandin' on the game, and what the levels and the rules of the game is
Then the world ain't no trick no more, the world is a game to be played
So, now we lookin' at the world from, high watch, behind us
Niggas know what we gotta do: just gotta put our mind to it and do it, it's all about the papers, money rule the world
Bitches make the world go round
Real niggas do what they wanna do, bitch niggas do what they can

(And we go by The Runners)
Yo, SB, haha (Go hard)
I think it's my time, you know why? (Go hard)
My tears have dried, and I know that no weapon formed against me will prosper (Go hard)
And I truly believe that my haters are my motivators
Young Money

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
If you could, you would get rid of me
Fuck you gon' do when a bitch try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (To me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another girl sit in your throne
I done put the chokehold
Now they screamin', ""Nicki leave me alone!""
(Hard) I am (Hard), I'm still (Hard) the one to beat (Go hard)
Ain't in a rush for mainstream, I am the streets (Go hard)
I am getting it in until the end
I gotta go (Go), go (Go), go (Oh)
Go hard
[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Gotta go, lemme get the car key
You don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie
Keep a marquee, everything sparkly (Man down)
Hit him on the walkie-talkie
Hit 'em, hit em, knock-knock, tell 'em let me in
My name ring bells, bitch, buzz me in (Bzzz)
And I only stop for pedestrians (Oh)
Or a real, real bad lesbian
Hit 'em with the MAC, hit 'em with the TEC-nine
Hit 'em with the Ruger, by the intersect sign
Hit 'em with a Tommy, so my niggas call me Pammy
And I always keep the jammy
In the trunk or in the Lamby
Put my whole borough on my back and I'm good
I don't wanna hear what you woulda, what you coulda
I represent all the girls that stood up (Uh)
Used to drink water with a little bit of sugar (Oh)
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups (One, two)
Doing the scissor-leg, on the mat, with my foot up
Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up
Now I'm tellin' LA Reid to step his bid up
And I'm tellin' President Carter he picked a winner
Bitches like Nelly and Kelly got a dilemma (Uh)
These birds all fly south in the winter (Uh)
Fuck I look like? Chomping on a chicken dinner?
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle? (C'yeah)
I'ma be the queen, no matter how they shuffle
Skirts with the ruffle (Yeah), Louis on the duffle (Yeah)
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Hahahahahaha, no muzzle)
What you wanna do, do, do? (C'yeah)
Bitches is softer than Al Dente
Cut from a different kente
Tell 'em I'm the ninja, Weezy is my Sensei
So I call him Splinter, faster than a sprinter
Gimme my chopsticks, I'll have these rap bitches for dinner
This is for my gentlemen in button-ups, and khakis
This is for my nigga, Seven Up, in Castaki
This is for my niggas wheelie-in' them Kawasakis
Shout out to the Vackee's, saltfish ackees
Kisses to my fans unless I'm feelin', kinda cocky
Winter Wonderland is on my hand, it's kind of rocky
I am Nicki, Minaj or Lewinski
Pump's on the clutch, right hand, on the 6-speed
Write my own raps, I gotta go, I gotta get me (Gotta get me)
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Yeah), ohh

From slap-and-cry you start to die
So I must go harder
Gotta make these bitches know me
Just like Bobby know water
Better yet, like Bubba know shrimp
But he don't say shit when the gun on his lip
And I don't say shit, put the gun on my hip
So I don't say shit but the gun on my hip
If you don't wanna drown, don't come on my ship
Check out how them bitches just run on my dick
And me, I'm still nasty as a son of a bitch
I still got that bitch cum on my lips
If you ain't got money, don't come on my strip
And if you got money, don't come on my strip
I wear that metal, no Olympic
But I can still make you tumble and flip
You fuckin' with me if you fuckin' with Nic'
They ain't fuckin' with me, they ain't fuckin' with Nic'
Your girlfriend her decision is split
'Cause she wanna fuck me and she wanna fuck Nic
They wonder if he be fuckin' Nic, as long as she be fuckin' rich
That's why I keep my luggage 'cause I swear y'all a fuckin' trip
Young Money dungeon, bitch, my swagger just punchin' bitch
And I shoot like I'm from overseas, so call my gun ""Gunović""
Weezy F Baby and the 'F' is for a bunch of shit
Red drank, blue pill, white dust, yes, I love my country, bitch
Hahaha, yeah, guitar

Wish you could get rid of Young Money

Look at her hips (What?), look at her legs, ain't she stacked? (Stacked)
I sure wouldn't mind hittin' that from the back (Back)
I like it when I touch it 'cause she moan a lil' bit
Jeans saggin' so I can see her thong a lil' bit

Man, she so stacked and she know that I want that
Her man, he's so wack, girl, can I taste yo cat?
Gave her three hundred to strip, like buyin' a throwback
She stay in the club, like to be seen, she got it honest
In real life, girl remind me of Pocahontas
She be at events (Yeah), cuss out the press when she pass (Yeah)
All the high rollin' cats wanna pay for that ass
Ain't no half steppin', she strapped with a nice weapon
Trick, it's against the law for her to move them hips
If you ever seen her dirty, your mouth gon' drop
Worldwide fools probably tell you this off tops

Huh, workin' in a Fatty Girl Hugga Top
Then she back it up on me and let it drop (Drop)
Make it hop, boing, like a bunny (Bunny)
Girl, can I touch you where it's sunny?
Or a purse and make you give her some money

Just bring the liquor, there's already eight shawties
I'm on my way, let me stop by the store
Get a 12-pack of Coronas - plus an ounce of 'dro, ya know?
Now I'm on Highway 270 to Natural Bridge Rd
I'm already blowed, hit third I'mma be be blowed some mo'
Pulled up, stop parked, rims still spinning
Valet looking like he in the game and must be winning
To room 490 I'm headed, on my way up
It's three girls on the elevator like: ""wassup?""
I told em: ""follow me"". they knew I had it cracking B
One said ""ain't you that boy that be on BET?""
""Ya that's me, Ching-a-ling equipped with much ding-a-ling""
Knock on the door, I'm on the scene of things
Busted in, Henny bottle to the face
Fuck it then, feel like my head is toxic waste
It's some pretty girls in hurr, I heard em whispering
Talking bout ""that's that dude that sing ""Right Thurr"" - he glistening""
I ain't come to talk, I ain't come to sit

Man know what, get them wraps and roll up
I took a chick in the bathroom seeing what's poppin
You know what's on my mind, shirts off and panties dropping
Niggas knocking on the door drunk, acting silly
The girl said ""can I be in yo video"" I'm like ""yeah!"", ""oh really?""
Now she naked strip teasing, me I'm just cheesing
She gave me a reason to be a damn heathen
Handled that, told ol' G, bring tha camera
Then I thought about, no footage as I ram her
Walked out the bathroom smiling, cats still wilding
Sharing the next room with some girls looking like they from an island

Just play a little ""D"" and I'll make ya mouth dribble
Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle
I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not Wiffle
Hit 'em in triples, with no strikes, stripes, or whistles
I ain't felt this good, since my wood lived off a thistle
Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels
For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle

Baby need new shoes, and you sitting on 22's

Unpacking your suitcases filling up your dresser

Life is your professor, know that bitch is gon' test ya
I got some shit I’d like to get off my chest
I spill out my soul, I spit out my stress
And can I spit out my stress?
It’s the feeling in the air
You bout to drop a real classic
He said, ""Cole, a lil' birdy told me on the low you got a Illmatic”
Nobody touching Nas, nigga it’s more like Villematic
Uh, these Fayettenam tales be paying off well
What story is my audio theater gon' tell
I know my debut will ship, but is it gon' sell?
I guess it’s in God’s hands
I make the type of pieces that make Jesus say, ""God damn""
That's for your non-believers, I’m the truth, only time'll teach ya
And fuck the haters, probably never love they mamas neither
Old bitter-ass sit around in middle class homes
With computers on hatin' on the newest song
While you was browsin', I was takin' out them student loans
Tryna do this shit better than the niggas we grew up on
Name a fuckin' song I ain't threw up on
Talk is cheap, it's like y'all grew up in a Jewish home
Hah, pardon the stereotype
But y'all giving me mixed feelings like I married a white woman
One minute I’m overrated, next minute I’m the savior
You hate it before you played it, I already forgave ya
For bullshitting, and that nigga Cole spitting that real
Wrote this line on a plane got flown straight from the Ville
To Miami, where the same time last year
I was broker than you, I just wanna make that clear
'Cause now I’m dealing with money I’ve never seen before
And R&B bitches want me, that was just dreams before
Now do I give into the temptation I’m facing?
The thought of losing a good woman keep me from chasing
But I’m just a man, at time’s the timing is wrong
Plus my dick is like a man with a mind of it’s own
But I’m tryna be strong, remind myself she ain’t about shit
These hoes the same, all that change is the outfit
Looking for cheese on some mouse shit
Suck a nigga, fuck a nigga, then go run they mouth quick
Rappers took a vacation I came over to house sit
You want change, this that between the seats in your couch shit
The fuck you thought, I lost it?
All that flame on my name would get exhausted
Au contraire, my nigga, they all ears
Sit back, enjoy the ride it’s finna be a long year, yeah
It’s finna be a long year, yeah

I heard 'em say, ""Exact opposites attract""
If that's a fact, it'll take task force to get you back
Come on
[Chorus]
Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance

[Verse 2]
The first victim I had, she was a big one
Big movie star, a party girl, big fun
She was the girl the media always picked on
In and out of rehab every four-to-six months
She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
At Nickelodeon, flashed the little kids once
What an event it was, I was sitting in front
I was hooked in at the first glimpse of them buns
Seen her backstage, now here's where I come in, son
Look, here she comes, I better pull out the big guns
""Hello Lindsay, you're looking a little thin, hun
How 'bout a ride to rehab? Get in, cunt!
But starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want
Girl, I'm just kidding, let me start over again, hun
See what I meant was, we should have a little intervention
Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension
You little wench, ya, murder wasn't my intention
If I wanted to kill you, it would've already been done""
Slowly she gets in and I begin to lynch her
With 66 inches of extension cord
[Chorus]
Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance

[Verse 3]
My second victim was even bigger than the first
Pop star, icon, the whole works
She played a little schoolgirl when she first
Burst upon the scene and seen that the world was hers
She twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts
It irked me, it made me mad at first
I lashed out in my songs, but what was really going on
Was that I had developed a crush
I just didn't know how to tell it to her
Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?
Send her pictures of my collection of skeletons, or
Footage of me impaling myself on an elephant tusk?
We'll settle this once and for all, I'ma tell her at dusk
Tonight, tonight is the night, and tell her I must
Creep up to her mansion in stilettos, and just
Climb the gate, and ring the bell like, ""Hello, my love
I just picked your prescription for Seroquel up
Now would you like to share a pill or two with me?
I'll share my Valium with you 'cause I'm feeling you Britney
I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one
Ever since a schoolgirl juvenile delinquent
I've been feeling you, ooh-ooh, girl, you sexy little gal, you
Hold that pill any longer, it'll get sentimental value
C'mon toots, give me the Valium alley-oop
I'll slam dunk it in your mouth 'til you puke
And just as soon as you pass out in your alphabet soup
I'm 'bout to make a new outfit out of you
New outfit? Shit, I'll make a suit out of you, shoot
Now, show me how you move, baby, do how a-you do""
[Chorus]
Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance

[Outro]
Same kicking and screaming, same crying and sobbing
Same song and dance
Same begging and pleading, same yelling and bleeding
Same song and dance
Yeah
Same song and dance
I know
Same song and dance"

'Cause I grab the mic and get down like syndrome
Hide and roam into the masses
Without boundaries, which qualifies me
For the term “universal” without no rehearsal
I leak words that's controversial

Niggas that take no for an answer get told no
Yeah, I been told no, but it was more like “No! No! No!”
Life's a bitch, met her, fuck you if you let her
Better come better than better to be a competitor

A medic instead of the cheddars and credda
Settle vendetta with metal Beretta from ghetto to ghetto

So think what I'ma do to you, have done to you
Got niggas in my hood who'd do that shit for a blunt or two
What you wanna do? Cocksuckers, we Glock busters

I'm tryin' to clean up my fuckin' image
So I promised the fuckin' critics I wouldn't say “fuckin'” for six minutes
Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!
My baby's mom, bitch made me an angry blonde
So I made me a song, killed her and put Hailie on
I may be wrong, I keep thinkin' these crazy thoughts
In my cranium, but I'm stuck with a crazy mom
Is she really on as much dope as you say she's on?
Came home and somebody musta broke in the back window
And stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trench coats
Six sick dreams of picnic scenes
Two kids, sixteen, with M-16's and ten clips each
And them shits reach through six kids each
And Slim gets blamed in Bill Clint's speech to fix these streets?!
Fuck that! Pbbt, you faggots can vanish to volcanic ash
And reappear in hell with a can of gas and a match

Hip Hop Is Dead,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by will.i.am]

[Intro: will.i.am & Nas]
Hip hop, hip hop (Ugh!) is dead
(Had to flip this track again, y'all!)
Hip, hip hop, hip hop (Ugh!) is dead
Hip, hip hop (Ugh!)
Hip, hip hop is dead (NYC! Dirty South!)
Hip, hip hop (West Coast!)
Hip hop (Midwest!)
Hip hop (Let's go!)

[Hook: Nas & will.i.am]
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll load an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
(Hip hop just died this morning
And she's dead, she's dead)
[Verse 1: Nas]
Yeah, niggas smoke, laugh, party and die in the same corner
Get cash, live fast, body their man's mama
Quick fast, trigger fingers on the llama
Revenge in their eyes, Hennessy and the ganja
Word to the wise with villain state of minds
Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
(Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind)
Whenever, if ever, I roll up, it's sown up
Any ghetto will tell ya, ""Nas helped grow us up""
My face once graced promotional Sony trucks
Hundred million and billin', I helped blow 'em up
Gave my man my right, I could have went left
So like my girl Foxy, the kid went deaf
So people, who's your top 10? Is it MC Shan? Is it MC Ren?

And she's dead, she's dead)
[Verse 2: Nas]
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'
Come through, something ill, missing the ceilin'
What influenced my raps? Stick-ups and killings
Kidnappings, project buildings, drug dealings
Criticize that, why's that?
‘Cause Nas rap is compared to legitimized crack
‘Cause we love to talk on nasty chickens
Most intellectuals will only half listen
So you can't blame jazz musicians
Or David Stern with his NBA fashion issues
Oh, I think they like me, in my white tee
You can't ice me, we here for life, B
On my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey
And for that, we not taking it lightly
If hip hop should die, we die together
Bodies in the morgue lie together, all together now

If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ

Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ

Hip hop just died this morning
Hip hop just died this morning
And she's dead, she's dead)
[Outro Verse: Nas]
Everybody sound the same, commercialize the game
Reminiscing when it wasn't all business
It forgot where it started
So we all gather here for the dearly departed
Hip-hopper since a toddler
One homeboy became a man, then a mobster
If it dies, let me get my last swig of vodka
RIP, we'll donate your lungs to a rasta
Went from turntables to MP3's
From ""Beat Street"" to commercials on Mickey D's
From gold cables to Jacobs
From plain facials to Botox and face lifts
I'm looking over my shoulder
It's about 80 people from my hood that showed up
And they came to show love
Sold out concert and the doors are closed shut"

John 1,Holy Bible (KJV),['country'],"John 1:1: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

John 1:2: The same was in the beginning with God.

John 1:3: All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.

John 1:4: In him was life; and the life was the light of men.

John 1:5: And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.

John 1:6: There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.

John 1:7: The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.

John 1:8: He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.

John 1:9: That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.

John 1:10: He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.

John 1:11: He came unto his own, and his own received him not.
John 1:12: But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:

John 1:13: Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

John 1:14: And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.

John 1:15: John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.

John 1:16: And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.

John 1:17: For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.

John 1:18: No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.

John 1:19: And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?

John 1:20: And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.

John 1:21: And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.

John 1:22: Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?

John 1:23: He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.

John 1:24: And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.
John 1:25: And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?

John 1:26: John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;

John 1:27: He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.

John 1:28: These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.

John 1:29: The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.

John 1:30: This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.

John 1:31: And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.

John 1:32: And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.

John 1:33: And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.

John 1:34: And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.

John 1:35: Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;

John 1:36: And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith,
Behold the Lamb of God!

John 1:37: And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
John 1:38: Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?

John 1:39: He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.

John 1:40: One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.

John 1:41: He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.

John 1:42: And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.

John 1:43: The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.

John 1:44: Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.

John 1:45: Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.

John 1:46: And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.

John 1:47: Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!

John 1:48: Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.

John 1:49: Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.

John 1:50: Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.

John 1:51: And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man."
John 2,Holy Bible (KJV),['country'],"John 2:1: And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:

John 2:2: And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.

John 2:3: And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.

John 2:4: Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.

John 2:5: His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.

John 2:6: And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.

John 2:7: Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.

John 2:8: And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.

John 2:9: When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom.

John 2:10: And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.

John 2:11: This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
John 2:12: After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.

John 2:13: And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

John 2:14: And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:

John 2:15: And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;

John 2:16: And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.

John 2:17: And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.

John 2:18: Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?

John 2:19: Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.

John 2:20: Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?

John 2:21: But he spake of the temple of his body.

John 2:22: When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.

John 2:23: Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.

John 2:24: But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,
John 2:25: And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man."
John 3,Holy Bible (KJV),['country'],"John 3:1: There was a man of the Pharisees,
named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:

John 3:2: The same came to Jesus by night,
and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him

John 3:3: Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God

John 3:4: Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?

John 3:5: Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God

John 3:6: That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit

John 3:7: Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again

John 3:8: The wind bloweth where it listeth,  and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit

John 3:9: Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?

John 3:10: Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?
John 3:11: Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness

John 3:12: If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?

John 3:13: And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven

John 3:14: And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:

John 3:15: That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life

John 3:16: For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life

John 3:17: For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved

John 3:18: He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God

John 3:19: And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil

John 3:20: For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved

John 3:21: But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God

John 3:22: After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized

John 3:23: And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized
John 3:24: For John was not yet cast into prison

John 3:25: Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying

John 3:26: And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him

John 3:27: John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven

John 3:28: Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him

John 3:29: He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled

John 3:30: He must increase, but I must decrease

John 3:31: He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all

John 3:32: And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony

John 3:33: He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true

John 3:34: For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him

John 3:35: The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand

John 3:36: He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him"

Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs?
Haha, knock it off, Neimans, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the baller-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless, P

Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy

If one day, you just up and leave

Too Hard for the Fuckin Radio,Mac Dre,"['hip hop', 'rock', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Listen up, I'm about to get dope
It ain't nothin' but some shit I wrote
About a young brotha deep in the game
They call me Mac Dre and I'm keepin' the name
I sport Nike shoes, I got a mic to use
To talk bad about suckers, I don't like the fools
Down and dirty bout spittin' my hits
And if not, I'm gettin' my grits
Playin' the game like it's supposed to be played
Makin' much more than a minimum wage
Not a pimp daddy, don't drive a Caddy
I just mack and get all that babby
Dre, you know I never slow down
Smokin' cesstee until I'm really towed down
Walk into the party, fully perked
Grab the microphone and let the mouthpiece work
I got hype and the game starts flowin'
The girls get freaky and it starts showin'
And when the party's over at the end of the night
They say: Damn, Mac Dre you ain't nothin' polite
'Cause I'm the numero uno, could never be the dos
A Mac named Dre and I'm poppin' the most
18, makin' raps 'til I'm 80 though
And too hard for the fuckin' radio

""Tell me something good""
I'm too hard for the fuckin' radio

My rhymes are dope 'cause Mac Dre made 'em
And made you geek every time you play them
On your tape deck, hooked to your ZAPCO
A little hard, but brotha I'm a mack, though
Nothin' nice, makin' raps that you wanna hear
Gettin cessted, put my hands on the beer
I can't help it, that's what I like to do
Sloppy drunk, rappin' on the mic for you
A young brotha, kinda bone-skinny
I take a girl to the Golden Penny
Get romantic, just like I planned it
Then cut turf and leave the girl stranded
Is it hard because I just beat it?
Not really, that's what the girl needed
That's game, I thought that you knew this
Mack game, and mine is the smoothest
Like lotion I'm in motion
I'm a mack, I was a big ocean
But no matter what the fuck your name is
Nothin' nice is what my game is
18, makin' raps 'til I'm 80 though
And too hard for the fuckin' radio

I'm too hard for the fuckin' radio

Come to the Northside of the V
The C the R the E the S-T
Hit Leonard, what will be seen?
20 young niggas gettin' full of the heem
This is the Romper Room, and you know who I am
The Mac named Dre, so get with the program
Nothin' proper, freaks will clock ya
And if there's funk, then punk we'll mop ya
So beware of the four-door Delta
Get your crew if you think they can help ya
And step up but not too close
'Cause the Crestside is poppin' the most
And all you girls, don't you feel left out
And to the boys, I've worn that flesh out
And after that we can still be friends though
And if not, we'll be friends with the Indo
Romper Room kickin' on Leonard Street

Rather be up in the club, shakin' for a dub
Get triple times the money and spendin' it like they wanna
They got they mind on they money, money on they mind
They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the 9
See, everyday they feel the struggle but stayin' on they grind
And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line
But I know there's a drop in the block
You move slow, you gettin' pressure from cops
You don't know whether or not to lay low

She wears a dress to the T like the letter
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather
She used to run track back in high school
Now she tricks on the track right by school
She take the loss 'cause she don't wanna see her child lose
So respect her, or pay up for the time used
And then she runs to the pastor
And he tells her there will be a new chapter
But she feels no different after
And then she ask him: ""Where my money at?""

Paper Bag,Fiona Apple,['alternative'],"[Verse 1]
I was staring at the sky, just looking for a star
To pray on, or wish on, or something like that
I was having a sweet fix of a daydream of a boy
Whose reality I knew, was a-hopeless to be had
But then the dove of hope began its downward slope
And I believed for a moment that my chances
Were approaching to be grabbed
But as it came down near, so did a weary tear
I thought it was a bird, but it was just a paper bag

[Chorus]
Hunger hurts and I want him so bad, oh, it kills
'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up
I got to fold cause these hands are too shaky to hold
Hunger hurts, but starving works
When it costs too much to love

[Verse 2]
And I went crazy again today
Looking for a strand to climb, looking for a little hope
Baby said he couldn't stay
Wouldn't put his lips to mine and a fail to kiss is a fail to cope
I said, ""Honey, I don't feel so good, don't feel justified
Come on put a little love here in my void,""
He said ""It's all in your head,""
And I said, ""So's everything"" but he didn't get it
I thought he was a man but he was just a little boy
[Chorus]
Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh, it kills
'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up
I got to fold cause these hands are too shaky to hold
Hunger hurts, but starving works
When it costs too much to love
Hunger hurts but I want him so bad, oh, it kills
'Cause I know I'm a mess that he don't wanna clean up
I got to fold because these hands are just too shaky to hold
Hunger hurts, but starving works me
When it costs too much to love
Oh, hunger hurts but I want him so bad, oh, it kills
'Cause I know I'm a mess that he don't wanna clean up
I got to fold because these hands are just too shaky to hold
Hunger hurts, but starving, it works
When it costs too much to love, hmm, hmm"
Wonder Why,Wale,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","[Produced by 9th Wonder]

[Verse 1 (Wale)]
Don't wonder my hours long and I never tire
Because a nigga grind well exceeding 9 to 5
Who fear a 9 to 5, seein' me again?
I came through with diseased semen on my pen
That's AIDs to the ill
LA to the Chilly
East Coast, still them W's just raised up for real
Felatio fetish, broads know me where I live
Brought dimes to Brazil, fuck the currency ya dig?
Still they wonder how I seem so confident
One can seem pompous
Me and you just need to talk a bit
I ain't your regular rapper who just be talking shit
Listen to it a lil' closer, hear the gospel in it
How I maneuver through the studio is hallelujah
You dudes peak too early like Biakabutuka
I share rhyme in the sewer
Pepe Le Pew my music
You ain't the reason why they came like the fries at hooters
I'm beside the future
They can't get rid of it
I'm past, present, every day's December 25th
Jolly ol' Saint Nicholas
Take your pick
Admire my style, flyer than Kid Icarus
[Hook (Mike Posner)]
Just because you know me, you don't know me
I've been tryin'a do it big since '03
And I got a little big, keep it low key
Tryin'a keep up with my mind, and you wonder why
You on my mind
Don't wonder why
Their sayin on my mind

[Verse 2 (Big Sean)]
Better then whoever nigga as is
I'm always dressed up but I never slack shit
So good, man I feel like I could be the 8th wonder of the world
And the 9th is on the track bitch
On track 'til I go hoarse
Hear my voice, and they pray that they never hear the chorus
Cause thinking logical to me was illogical
So I took impossible and turned it into optical
Seen blood, sweat and tears like a locker room
But you should take a look at where it got us to
We grind so when we shop out we cop out, like precincts
Even if it's not out, bring the whole stock out
We ain't on the court but everything is getting boxed out
Got it on lock, you just locked out
Skinny jeans, but a nigga still hood
I bet they thought they'd never see a Big gone good
But I swear to god my biz bad boy
And that's word to my nigga bad boy
Saw Puff, I was finna' speak
Nigga turn around and he recognise me
Damn, now that's what the fuck you call dedication
Get money, you still waiting on your reparations
Weight of the world, I lift without preparation
And it's time to make a real nigga separation
[Hook]

[Verse 3 (Kenn Starr)]
I used to be the most humble until
I figured out that it don't matter for real
Now I'm arrogant
Ill as a blood born pathogen to the killed
The reason why they had to give me a deal
Because I'm gettin it in
Look this the joint that could get me the spins
You get the point? Listen this what it is
Here's the lesson
I'm a force to be reckoned with
Why would you question it man?
Of course it's a definite
Enforce, I'm elegant and
You're soft and you're delicate
You should have a flower logo
My power awesome like Austin Powers with his mojo
Crossed them powers or devoured in a heartbeat
Sharper than sharpies
I'm sharper than shark teeth
Start beef bigger then your spouse
Should be harder to find
Than diggin' in your couch, looking for your car keys
Give it back with a sensitive mouth and some hard knees
From gettin' the jimmy like a car thief is
Wale and Ken Starr, we
Outt'a your league
Get grand slam fans out of they seats
Let's get paper, and caked up
Like six layers of thick make-up
On the self-conscious chick over-compensating for A-Cups

Me and Kid Sensation at home away from home
In the black Benz limo with the cellular phone
I'm calling up the posse it's time to get rippin
A freak in each sunroof to keep you suckas trippin
Everybody's looking if you're jealous turn around
The AMG kit keeps us closer to the ground
We're getting good grip from the 50 series tires
The Alpine's bumping but I need the volume higher
Cause the 808 kick drum makes the girlies get dumb
We're rolling Rainier and the jealous wanna get some
Every time we do this sucka mc's wanna battle
I'm the man they love to hate the J.R. Ewing of Seattle
Picked up the posse on 23rd and Jackson
Heading for the strip, yes we're looking for some action
The limo's kinda crowded, the whole car was leaning back
Maharaji's watching T.V. with two girlies on his lap
On Martin Luther King the set looks kinda dead
We need a new street so posse move ahead
We all look kinda swass, the crew you can't forget
The Mix-a-lot posse cold ripping up the set
[Chorus]
My posse's on Broadway
My posse's on Broadway
Posse up

[Verse 2]
Rollin in, my posse was getting kinda bored
There's not another posse with more points scored
We don't walk around like criminals or flex like big gorillas
My homeboy Kid Sensation is the teenage lady killa
Maharaji's on the def side dancing like a freak
The girlies see his booty and their knees get weak
Larry is the white guy people think he's funny
A real estate investor who makes a lot a money
Clocking lots a dollars, we all got gold
Cruising in this Benz and ain't got no place to go
Wheeling 23rd we saw nothing but thugs
The girlies was too skinny from smoking all them drugs
Cause the rock man got em and their butts just drop
The freaks look depressed because the Benz won't stop
At 23rd and Union the driver broke left
Kevin shouted Broadway it's time to get def
My girl blew me a kiss she said I was the best
She's looking mighty freaky in her black silk dress
The closer that we get, the crazier I feel
My posse's on Broadway, it's time to get ill
[Chorus]
My posse's on Broadway
My posse's on Broadway
Posse up

[Verse 3]
Cruising Broadway and my wheels spin slow
Rolling with your posse is the only way to go
The girlies by the college was looking for a ride
We tried to pick em up but we had no room inside
We put em on the trunk we put em on the hood
Some sat up with the driver they made him feel good
The posse's getting bigger, there's much too many freaks
My muffler is dragging, my suspension's getting weak
Now the freaks are getting hungry & Mix-a-Lot's treatin'
We stopped at Taco Bell for some Mexican eatin'
But Taco Bell was closed the girls was on my tip
They said, ""Go back the other way we'll stop and eat at Dick's""
Dick's is the place were the cool hang out
The swass like to play and the rich flaunt clout
Posse to the burger stand so big we walk in twos
We're getting dirty looks from those other sucker crews
Kid Sensation dropped a 20 and didn't even miss it
Skeezer from another crew, she picked it up and kissed it
Her boyfriend's illin, he went to slap her face
My homeboy PLB cold sprayed the boy with mace
Cause I never liked a punk who beat up on his girl
If you don't have game then let her leave your world
We took his girl with us
With him she rode the bus
She gave the boy the finger and the sucker starts to cuss
Boy I got a def posse you got a bunch a dudes
You're broke cold crying about the rock man blues
Ya beat up on your girl and now your all upset
She's with the Mix-a-Lot posse on the Broadway set"
Playaz Club,Rappin' 4-Tay,['hip hop'],"[Chorus]
Me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

[Verse 1]
I got a ho named Reel-To-Reel
She got a buddy named SP-12, now you know the deal
We gets freaky in the studio late-night
That's why the beats that you hear are comin' real tight
Somethin' to roll to, somethin' to stroll to
If you's a player in the game this'll hold you
More money, more money for the bank roll
Stick to the script, don't slip in the '94
A lot of fools put the salt in the game
To where these women get the notion that they runnin' the game
Huh, I run my own, and I'm my own self-person
No respect make the situation worsen
Fillmore, H.P., and Sunnydale
There's a Playaz Club everywhere you dwell
Lakeview, P.H., and Army Street
A different part of town, a different kind of freak
I just wiggle my toes on a mink rug
And press play on remote at the Playaz Club
[Chorus]
Me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club
(More champagne, Mr. 4-Tay?)

[Verse 2]
From day one I had to get my money right
Me, Fly, and Frankie J, we took an airplane flight
Huh, they wanted to hear a rap, I said ""Alright, bet""
We dropped a beat, I grabbed the mic, and then they wrote a check
A few G's for the pocket, no hesitation
Took a flight back to the Golden State, and
Shops made orders from a whole new capital
The word was gettin' out, 4-Tay's out-rappable
Don't need a Glock, but I bought one just in case
A sucka try to stop me from pursuing my paper chase
Know the chase is on, because it don't stop
I got the beat and got the rap, you make the Glock pop
So treacherous suckas couldn't sweat this on a bad day
By the way, just in case you never heard of Rappin' 4-Tay
I'm on the smooth tip
Never trippin' on them suckas poppin' off at the lip
I pop the top off the drank and we can roll some dank, bro
Leave the gat at the house, bring some dominoes
Kick off your shoes, relax, and get a body rub
And shoot your mackin' at these women at the Playaz Club
[Chorus]
Me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

[Verse 3]
You can't resist it, but don't get it twisted
VIP, that means the number's not listed
Membership is based on clout
And how you carry yourself; now homie, what you all about?
I stack paper and kick it with the O.G.'s
Some got a nine-to-five, some jook a lot of kis
You can learn a whole lot from a playa
A lot of these playas make a damn good rhyme-sayer
A lot of people get a misconception
And start drifting in the wrong direction
Miss Goody Two-Shoe, I'll see you later
I ain't got time, you ain't nothing but a playa-hater
I'd rather kick it with the crew in Arizona
They chop game like we do in California
Another show, another flow, a new bank account
But cash money comes in large amounts
So get your membership, but never slip to lameness fast
Or else Fly will have to tap that ass
And drop you to the ground, and make your knees scrub
It's just an everyday thang at the Playaz Club
[Chorus]
Me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game, that's how we do it in the Playaz Club
Check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club
Me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'Cause we kick much ass at the Sucka-free Club

[Outro: Rappin' 4 Tay & Lil Fly]
Yeah, I'd like to send this shout out
To all the Playaz Clubs throughout the world
I know they got a Playaz Club in Chicago
Huh, what about that one they got in Philly, Fo'?
You know they got one out there in Atlanta
The way they be choppin' it
You understand, shit; Detroit, New York, Texas
Yeah, but we gonna move on down to these Playaz Clubs
Closer to home, like Seattle, L.A., Bakersfield, San Diego
P.A., V-Town, Richmond, Sacramento
Yeah, but a special shout goes out to the Playaz Club
Right across the water in the Biggity Biggity O
Yeah, and last but definitely not least, yeah
Them Playa Clubs they got right there in the
San Francisco mothafuckin' bay, yeah
Where your Playaz Club at 4?
My Playaz Club right in the heart of Fillmo'e
Uh, I feel you boy
Where yours at Fly?
Man, on the corner of Third and Newcomb, right in the heart of HP
Hahahah, Huh

Crazy In Love,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'alternative', 'pop', 'jazz']","[Intro: Heart (Sampled)]
Tell myself that I was doing alright
There's nothing left to do tonight
But go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh

[Verse 1]
Can't you see what you do to me, baby?
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
You're truly the only one who can do this to me
You just make me get so crazy
I go schizo, I get so insane, I just go schizophrenic
One minute I wanna slit your throat, the next I wanna sex
You make me crazy, the way we act
Like two maniacs in the sack
We fuck like two jackrabbits
And maybe that's a bad habit
'Cause the next day we're right back at it
In the same exact pattern
What the fuck is the matter with us?
We can't figure out if it's lust or it's love
What's that that's attractin' us to each other?
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother
Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch
But I stay and still stick it out with you
Even though I just hit you today
But you deserve it, you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
Just 'cause I came home late last night
Crawled in bed and I woke you
But if there's one thing about you that I admire it's, baby
Because you stay with me, maybe 'cause you're as crazy as I am
'Cause when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes
But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side
Like a devil in disguise, you're always full of surprises
Always pullin' devices out your purse: little vibrators and dildoes
You fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore
You're only 24, but you're plenty more ma-ture
Than those other little hoes who just act like little girls
Like they're in middle school still
You're crazy, sexy, cool, chill
And you play your position, you never step outta line
Even though I stay in your business you've always kept outta mine
I wonder what's on your mind
Sometimes they say love is blind
Maybe that's why the first time
I dotted your eye you ain't see the sign
Or maybe you did, maybe you like being shoved
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love
[Chorus: Heart (Sampled)]
Go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh

[Verse 2]
You are the ink to my paper, what my pen is to my pad
The moral, the very fiber, the whole substance to my rap
You are my reason for being, the meaning of my existence
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this
As intense as I do, and the irony is you rely on me
As much as I rely on you to inspire me like you do
You provide me the lighter fluid, the fuel to my fire
You're my entire supply: gas, the match, and igniter
The only way that I am able to stay so stable
Is you're the legs to my table
If you were to break I'd fall on my face
But I'm always gonna make you feel I don't need you as much
As I really need you so you don't use it to your advantage
But you're essential to me, you're the air I breathe I believe
If you ever leave me I'd probably have no reason to be
You are the Kim to my Marshall, you're the Slim to my Shady
The Dre to my Eminem, the Alaina to my Hailie
You are the word that I'm lookin' for
When I'm tryin' to describe how I feel inside
And the right one just won't come to my mind
You're like the pillar that props me up, the beam that supports me
The bitch who never took half, the wife who never divorced me
You're like the root to my evil, you let my devil come out me
You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me
And no matter how much, too much is never enough
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love
[Chorus: Heart (Sampled)]
Go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh"

Falling too fast
Clearly rules don't apply
Can't believe that I just met you
You got me here

Wondering when to expect you
There you go, is this a dream?
Looking like every picture that I've seen of you before
I've seen it all before

Now that it's over
I should of known better
Then you think this is real and
You could be mine

You needed time

Cover me in rag and bone sympathy
Cause I don't wanna get over you

Sorrow's a girl inside my cake
I live in a city sorrow built

Things have been so crazy and hectic
I shoulda gotten back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better anyhow
So if you gotta go
If there's anything I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you're looking for a purpose

[Verse 2: Drake]
You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore?
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm off singing karaoke
Further than I've ever been
So if you gotta go
If there's any way I can help
[Verse 3: Drake]
Isn't it ironic that the girl I want to marry is a wedding planner
That tells me my life is too much and then moves to Atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you'd choose somewhere
That had somebody that you know
I'm always up too late, I worry 'bout you there alone
In that place you call your home, warm nights and cold Patron
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy
'Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories 'bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest
But that first cut is the deepest
I tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets
Secrets you were telling everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money, I'm still just young and unlucky
I'm surprised you couldn't tell

E: Yo, what’s going on, kid?
O: Chilling, man, what’s going on with you?
E: Yo, you heard the O.C. shit?
O: Yeah, yeah, that shit is flavor, kid. What’s the word? Yo, yo
E: Yo
O: Man, yo, well, talk to you later, man

[Verse 1: O.C.]
Uh
I never ran from a man unless Glock get cocked in my face
I dash before the *gunshot*
Dissed the sister ‘cause she didn’t like ya, mister
Bust your ego on down like a blister
The party was packed
In fact black ladies with back were stacked
Inside of the place like flapjacks
First of all, what you call hardcore? Who’s hardcore?
I gets grit in your teeth and lock in your jaw
Mess hall is filled with crooks and criminals
Ill type of characters giving up ill subliminals
Get nostalgia from a rhyme that I wrote long time ago
Found this place, I figured, “Who would know?”
The body’s a poem, talking ‘bout the mind more powerful than anything known to mankind
My flight has begun—stand clear of the runway
The only way I see you killing me is with gunplay
In many ways and more peeps die in the raw
Flip the word around, now “raw” spells “war”
Never could I kill a man to fill a void of prosperous life
He gets burnt like phosphorus
Crooked your face from the slap of my base in your grill piece
You’re the lamb I took fleece from
You underestimate the quest of fate
Destined for a date with O.C. the Great, ha
Ruling benevolence over a girl named Evelyn
Getting woman to succeed in my field of medicine
Fuck the ones who adjourned my concern with all-out conceit
I cop the Ogee beats
Balance, not bullets. The world is already full of nonsense
So I’ll contribute to your conscience
O, (yeah?) raise up the kicks, (hmm) pop back in the disc
Make it feel as though the slapping of a fist
Flip verses, skip curses, dodge hearses
Collect fat purses, stay surface above the dead planet
Earth of granite
A thousand emcees of my sex is satanic
I’m sticking to my comments, never rap nonsense
The metaphoric title of my table of contents is logic
No such thing as modern, out and achieve
But some are still deadweight, rock-bottom
Talking shhh, sparking for nothing
Barking up the wrong damn tree, homie, slice cold-bluffing
Alas, ain’t nothing mashing just for fashion
What’s the object? It’s, like, no main topic
[Outro: Prince Po]
No doubt, baby pop, we do it like this, uh, nonstop
One time we gotta rock
O.C. for the ‘94 flavor
We do it like this, sending your whole career to the grave
One time for your mind
Going back to the lyrics with no tricks
Uplifting your spirits with no gimmicks
We do it just like this one time, uh
The sess is in effect, we do it like this
Prince Po’ll catch wreck one time
With no main topic...
I’ll break it down like that"

[Verse 1]
Like the dead-end kids, we used to play in the streets
Never worrying about grief, football spelled relief
Ronnie Ritney was the coach for us
See, he taught us to play almost every single day, okay
Now on Evergreen was Larry and Mike and Lon
My cousin Boo lived there too, just to name a few
And Cha-rone, he’s bad to the bone, Boo’s little sidekick
Had a badass mouth, he sufficed it
On Harmon Street, with Zach, Leo and Ed
Meet Jody and Boop by June, Rocky, and then
Comes Tommy and Cedric, Lamont and Greg, unique in our own right
At times we’d fight, but that’s aight
Still, not realizing we had love, it showed when we played
The phony charades against one another
Now, while I write this song
It’s like some are still alive and a couple are gone

[Hook]
We’re born to live a life and die
Life’s so damn short, man, I wonder why
We’re born to live a life and die
Life’s so damn short, man, I wonder why
We’re born to live a life and die
Life’s so damn short, man, I wonder why
We’re born to live a life and die
Life’s so damn short, man, I wonder why
[Verse 2]
As kids, you’re overlooking death
It didn’t seem important or serious, it just seems curious
It was about waking to a bowl of cereal
Cartoons on Saturdays, karate flicks in life
Riding your skateboard or bicycle
It went as deep as Killer Joe on the corner drinking Ripple, plus
Puerto Rican kids on the block were cool, we got along
We all knew right from wrong
By far, we got a dose that life was hard
A Spanish kid we were close with was killed by a car
Shocking, Alberto was hit on the block, and
Death was spontaneous, his moms was clocking him
Cross the street, he just received an award
For Little League Baseball like a hour before, plus
He didn’t even get to see the summer set in
Dying all young at the age of seven
It opened up my eyes more that the flesh was weak
As a kid, thinking shit like that was mad deep
Peep it

[Hook]
We’re born to live a life and die
Life’s so damn short, man, I wonder why
We’re born to live a life and die
Life’s so damn short, man, I wonder why
We’re born to live a life and die
Life’s so damn short, man, I wonder why
We’re born to live a life and die
Life’s so damn short, man, I wonder why
[Verse 3]
Now, when somebody is gone, that’s when you realize how close you was
How close you are, like a scar
Real deep, it takes time to heal
And, still, from time to time, you wish you could find the way to forgive
And let ‘em know you forgave
But they can’t feel six feet deep inside the grave
What’s left but attend his wake?
Believing if it was you, he’d do it for old time’s sake
Damn, I’m disturbed by the news when I was told, I was sitting
Knowing damn well Boo ain’t bullshitting
My life flashed like big bills of cash and good times we had
Now it’s all so sad
One of my childhood pals hit the road
When you take to the streets, then you die by the code
But in this case, who knows what went down?
Bottom line is wishing that he still was around
Now, he found a spot in my heart, or should I say lobotomy
Mike, yo, you’re trapped inside of me
And every other brother in Bushwick who rushed to your side thick
All down with the clique
Yeah, God bless, he laid to rest
Called him Mike Boogie, that’s what describes the nigga best

[Hook]
We’re born to live a life and die
Life’s so damn short, man, I wonder why
We’re born to live a life and die
Life’s so damn short, man, I wonder why
We’re born to live a life and die

By the time you get props, David Duke'll be in Harlem
I wanna see you get paid, fat checks and G's
Like I want Roseanne Barr to do a strip tease
And it'd be nice if you could flow hip-hop
But bout when you get skills Dominicans will be wearin socks

I'm turnin parties out no doubt whatever that you give me
Don't need a +Terry Lewis+ to see me +Jam+ like +Jimmy+

And let it all hang out like a bitch without a bra
You tried and you tried but your project was failin
Now you're gettin treated like a door to door salesman
So what you toothpick here's a buck don't feel sorry

Touch, if you will, my stomach (Hmm)
Feel how it trembles inside (Mhm)
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you
Even doves have pride

[Chorus]
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world so cold? (World so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father: too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah
Doo-doo woah-oh
(Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold? (World that's so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding (Maybe, maybe)
Maybe I'm just like my father: too bold (My father, you know he's cruel)
Maybe you're just like my mother (Maybe you're just like my mother)
She's never satisfied (Never, never satisfied, why scream?)
Why do we scream at each other? (Why?)
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
[Break]
When doves cry (When doves cry, when doves cry)
When doves cry (When doves cry, they cry)
Oh, no, oh
Oh, no, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah

When doves cry
When doves cry (Hoo)
When doves cry (Hoo)

People might hear this and they might take it the wrong way
That's what people do
Like I give a fuck
They gonna think we starting trouble like usual
But we just viewing our opinion
Some people might get offended
I ain't trying to ruffle nobody feathers
But you niggas ain't gonna do shit

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
Now, I'm always flying, always driving something new
And it makes me cry for half the shit that I've been through
So gifted back then when it came to selling the coke
So now we pop rose every night just to make a toast

[Hook: Sen City]
Let's have a toast for the pushers
Let's make a toast to the strippers
To the connects when we re-up
Knocking points off when we meet up
Let's have a toast to the new Porsche
The one you bitches in when we murk off
Baby, I got a plan
I'mma need you to cook a thousand grams

I fuck with hoes that do check scams
And pop E pills, yeah, call 'em X-Clan
So I tell 'em, ""Vanglorious""
'Elz Neo, the One; Cam's Morpheus
Dipset, yeah, you know who's scorching this
All of these kids should open a damn orphanage
What up Jetlag? What up Sin City?
Killers first, Killa first; niggas been pretty
And Kanye, you a sucker nigga
Dis Dame, so my attitude is ""fuck a nigga""
Sucking Jigga, how you gonna live with that?
Took your beat — now, come get it back
Fuck what Mama say, whip color is marmalade
Modern-day Wilt Chamberlain, hoes andale
Yeah Malibu, boo, but it's Dom today
Shout to Weeso coming home, Tone, John, and Dre, ay

[Verse 3: Jim Jones]
And half these rap niggas still living a facade
Mention my name and I'll be thinking that they hard
But catch them out of bounds, and they ain't really like that
Catch us out of town, and we be living like that
Spent thirty thou, but we 'bout it on the flight back
Ash call Yandy, one show and get it right back
Think about the strip where I used to spend nights at
Spent nights on blocks where niggas lost they life at
Some got shot up, hospital, went right back
To the same block where they could have lost their life at
Damn, and shout out to my nigga Zoe
He used to laugh when he'd hear me say, ""Give 'em more""
Miami nights at the club, jumping in the V
You know the rich get richer, hungry never eat
But fuck that, nigga, I'mma need a plate of chow
No fuck that, nigga, I'mma need a plate of Chow's
Last whip I bought, that's a hard ninety thou'
I'm married to the game and didn't say my vows, ow
[Outro: Jim Jones]
I ain't say my grace, neither
Bow your head, don't be disrespectful
Like I was saying before, you might not understand this
You might not figure this out
We on a different side of the thing
Just lift your glasses up
Put your bottles in the sky
Let's have a toast for this money we've been getting
Let's have a toast for niggas getting back together, real niggas
A toast to the haters, because without you there would be no me, nigga
You smell me?
Ain't nobody pressed they luck, we still on deck, fucker
You know what we do
We fly high and die hard, motherfucker

Ladies going gaga for a nigga tryna fuck 'em
Nickel plate tuck it, hesitate nothing
And I got the AR, why I like to bust it?
Why I need counseling? Why I won't discuss it?
Why I spend Donkey Kong knots in the mall like fuck it?
Pull up at the stop light, looking at this cop like

Still let the top drop back when it's sunny

Gave me a box of baking soda and a skateboard
I'm in the kitchen putting the work on steroids
Peeking out the blinds for the Feds, I'm paranoid
Naw I ain't platinum, but how I'm a millionaire?
I know this a four-door, so how it ain't no ceiling there?

They tell me rap changed, well I'ma have to let her
Common loved her, I wish I never met her
They slutted her out, there's nothing left to treasure
Seems all I hear em say, ""Nigga, where them dollars at?""
Here they go right here, tell them niggas holla back
Hit it then I quit it then I step like a welcome mat

Crack a Bottle,Eminem,['hip hop'],"[Intro: Eminem & 50 Cent]
Oh! Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady! (Let's go!)

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Interlude: Eminem]
Okay, let's go!
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk
[Break 1: Eminem]
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre!

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
They see that low rider go by, they're like, ""Oh my!""
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why
I dip through in that Six-Trey like, ""Sick 'em, Dre!""
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A.
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk
[Break 2: Eminem]
And I take great pleasure in introducing 50 Cent!

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up, and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuan', do what you want
Nigga, on and on 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit (Uh huh)
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick? (Yeah)
Fat-ass Birkin bags, some classy shit (Haha)
Jimmy Choo shoes; I say, ""Move,"" a bitch move

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust

What's sunshine with no rain
What's joy without the pain
And I'm still gon' do my thing
There ain't no holding me back
Aye I'mma get mine, believe that
And what's sunshine with no rain
And what's joy without the pain

[Verse]

The city fucked up, even thug niggas getting robbed
Know it's bad when the drug dealers getting jobs
Same niggas who skipped out on graduation
At the gas station
Filling out them applications, but
They ain't calling me back
Best friends be our references
Paychecks spent on necklaces
Downpayments on them lexuses
Debit in the negative
Overdraft, with the sky overcast
But I'm screaming fuck the pessimists
Cause ain't no holding me back
The lil' nigga had big dreams, to do big things
But in this game, everything ain't what this shit seems
Try hard, to climb up to the flag-pole
Just to find out that your heroes is some assholes

So long, so long so long

(Verse One: Busstop)
I never got a chance to say goodbye
I could've made it to the funeral, I won't lie
But I didn't want to see my homie laying that way
Now I regret not paying respects to this day
Cause its hard to accept I'll never see u again
Not only true homies, we were best of friends
I hope u understand my pain and grief
Cause I can feel u up there looking down on me
Now I need to get somewhere so I can think
I'm going to the graveyard to pour my homies a drink
I sip the liquor, snip a rose and lay it on the grass
And never in my life have I felt so bad
It's Saturday night, I'm at the gravesite
Sitting by the tomb stone holding a flash light
The scene is cold I got sweated in my palm
I'm hurting so inside I feel so i drop the bomb
Lil' Jay could of been more than nineteen
Now it seems every night he's in my dreams
O.F.T.B. means operating from the bottom with a tribute to the homies that's gone, but not forgotten
(Chorus x2)

(Verse Two: FlipSide)
A lot of my homies died from gang affiliations
While others die from, imitation
But I ain't tripping, I learn from my losses
From gang banging u got's to pay the causes
You only live once, so live it to the fullest
A lot of my homies, they died by the bullet
Tony ?? not a convict
Just a gangster who grew up in the projects
A big daddy, is what he drove
Back then, to me it was a Roll's
Top Gold, he wore it on his clothes
He had a gangster live on pose
Just keeping it real so don't set trip
Much love from the Low, the Bus, the Flip (O.F.T.B.)
If you ever in Watts take a look at the wall
Dedicated for love dogg for all of y'all

I remember everyday, I use to play
With my niggas Ros Bowlow and Lil' Jay
But now they gone and not forgotten
And homies, this crazy world, is still plotting
I know one day I'm going to have to meet my end
But that's the day I hope we all gon' meet again
And give each other big hugs at the crossroads
It's hell on earth so I'm hoping Heavens your World
I'm still chilling, with Flip and Bustop
I hope y'all chilling, with T.C., Scoop and Choc
And all he other, homies that a nigga miss
For every candle, I blow out you know I wish
That we was all getting high, parle and trip
And have some laughs about the good times we use to have
Back in the days when we was all doing real bad
And right now a nigga trying to get his money right
But y'all know me yo, it's still tight
I never thought, we'd have to say goodbye
This kind of shit bring tears to a gangsters eyes
But the Low, you know I'm going to be strong
I won't say goodbye, I'm saying so long
(Chorus x2)

(Verse Four: MC Hammer)
I know we done all lost a friend before
A victim to the game in these street wars
But we gotta remember, we all gotta die
No matter what you do you can't escape your fate
David the boss was a warrior, a soldier
You had to pay attention to the game that he told you
A dark night when he lost his life
Full of than drink he couldn't put up a fight
So he slipped on over to the darkness
My homie, my Uncle, my dearly departed
I shed tears cause I wish he was here
(He never see his Nephew get to make it up here)
25 when he took his last breathe
He barely had lived, and he had to come and see death
I can't explain all the pain that I feel
David the boss, I love you and yeah that's real

(Chorus)

So long, so long so long
I hope to see you again
So long, so long so long
I hope to see you again
So long, so long so long
I hope to see you again
I hope to see my homies one day soon

To all my Nephews

And them niggas I used to ride with, stack cash get high with
Was the same niggas on my side, them the same niggas I'ma die with
Some friends turn foes, and some men turn hoes
But that's how the shit goes, when you ain't broke no more
Money the root of all evil, it could help or hurt people
You can't live without it so it tend to turn good guys evil

I’m grabbin’ the fattest asses, just to see ‘em shake
I swear I’m too real to be, I’m too real to be livin’ so fake

[Chorus]
Look out!
Cause I’m just too fake for the world
I know it’s just a game to me
I’m just too fake you see
I wish I didn’t have to be but watch out
I got too much soul for the world
It’s breaking my heart in two
I got too much soul for you
I don’t like it but it’s true
[Verse 2: Big Sean]
""Yeah I know Sean, I swear that nigga ain’t shit
Known him for forever and he ain’t on the same shit
It breaks my heart when all the kids be yelling 'You the mayne, Big'
He ain’t no hometown hero, he on that LeBron James shit""
Man I tell them suck my dick then choke on a nut
Cause when they see me it’s ""Oh, It's Big, What's up?""
Man for the team, man, fam, or regime
Might knock down any door, open it up
Got on and now you startin’ actin’ different huh?
No really I wasn’t fuckin’ with you from the beginnin’ bruh
Here we are, here we go, my circle tighter than a Cheerio
People want a handle like silver spoons
People want a handout like here you go
Man, the realest nigga I know is inside the mirror bro
And these fools be trippin’ like a suitcase, a shoelace
They too fake, and I’m too real, yeah, boy

[Chorus]
Look out!
Cause I’m just too fake for the world
I know it’s just a game to me
I’m just too fake you see
I wish I didn’t have to be but watch out
I got too much soul for the world
It’s breaking my heart in two
I got too much soul for you
I don’t like it but it’s true
[Verse 3: Chiddy]
Fake it til you make it
What happens when you do?
Friends turn to strangers, so I’m a stranger, too
They want this or that
Boy gotta hustle like a flip or pack
Year a go a nigga wasn't gettin' scratch
When I hit the booth I came up with a sick attack
Oh yes, feelin’ so strong we about to take the game like Conquest
Wish we fail, but they check pre-sales, and a hater gets proven wrong, yes
They just bantering, calls I’m not answering
Married to the music so I never give a hand a ring
But Chiddy jigga with these girls we be on the next
And they get mad cause we really don’t respond to text
Yeah, they say I, may be just on the shady side
Maybe I, grow so much and I smoke so much got a lazy eye
Yeah I’m too gone, this the new shit to get loose on
The boy Chiddy and Sean on a new song
If you ain’t with it, tell me what the fuck you on
I said I in heads, made it off of Big chance
Yeah and still the game can make you fake like implant
But I'm real"

[Intro: Mos Def & Swizz Beatz]
Yeah, yeah, there it go, there it is
This, is something special (uh-huh, yeah)
This, is something new (it's an amazing time)
This, is something special (look around)
This, is something new (the power of observation)

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
Marvels and frights and strange delights
Attributes, properties, disciplines and novelties
Ecstatic patterns in the calendar design
Wilderness tours, guided by and for the blind
Cool ruler standing still sweating through the shades
He knew those lights only grew bright to fade
Dead wrong pageantry, lottery and games
Sleight of hand provided by extravagant and fake
The carnival tilt bell the hustle for the age
They clutch what they covet, what must they give away?
Who was uninvited who was asked to come and stay?
Surprise, it's your life, it's your business anyway
So please, pardon these and such curious minds
Peace, safe passage, precious time hither and gone
The day of days, Yawm al-Qiyāmah
This tiny stone illuminated by a star
The only star so large, many more
To make our largest star show small, furthermore
The end is not the end no stop but a pause
And what we can witness isn't all there is at all
Custom mock of a scotch and pork chops
The passion, expansion, the order of the random
See the dreamers, see the sleepers
Why'd you wake them? Sweet Jesus
Enlighten the Earth, seek heaven first
Let's put in this work
[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Swizz Beatz]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Her heels set the mood, where did you acquire those Alaïas?
When I met you I heard Jesus, bells, strings and the choir
I got lines that's better than niggas' albums, plural
The king of the urban make your shit sound rural
She said I hit it so deep she need a epidural
Them other niggas have you looking like a squirrel
Now that's nuts
I only hang with white boys that like black sluts
Tell them Plain Pat yo that track sucks, we ain't dissing you
But you in the position to play something for us to listen to
I'm trying to worry about my scratch minus the crabs
I ain't stopping for you niggas like yellow cabs
I got scripts so why we need a movie?
And if I'm a douche, then put me in your coochie
I swear they shoulda never gave these niggas loose leaf
And excuse me if I'm trapped by the boobies
Booby trap, holla back

It's gonna take you a couple years to get this here
Thank AP, well they thank me
And I be mad too, if you ain't me
Call me Mr. Dean, or Mr. Boss
See me riding clean, in a Rolls Royce
Niggas talking funny, that's old money
Niggas looking crazy, but they talking funny
Nowadays rappers, they like bloggers
You see me? I'm a bank hogger
Coming through your hood, in a Brinks truck
With 25s on it like what the fuck?
100 feet and better, what the fuck you stick?
Paparazzi on the water with the fuck-you stick
My face got the ""fuck you pricks""
My beats go hard like fuck you dicks
Pouring champagne damn thing
See me rocking suede, nigga, in the damn rain
Ain't a damn thing, money ain't a damn thing
Ask Yeezy and Mos, we do the goddamn thing

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Aiyyo, open glass on my fingers, I sit back like I'm caged
But still caking, my niggas is hating
It's like being in the livest Lambo in the hood
You a piece of steak, I'd rather be that than some bacon
Every project is a throne only just bigger stones they throw
That's why I wear a big hat and roll weed
Gone if you don't know where you came or when you came
All you know is weed and cocaine, nonbelievers no game
I'm zooted down, rolling a spliff, maxing
Flaming like wheels got traction, I'm sun, he's attractive
Guaranteed to service the real niggas out cruising in a Volvo
A duffle for dolo, buffy polo
A blow house is where I resided once
Live amongst fiends, counting currency, hitting blunts
Only to hear the door rumble, grab the 4
Hope it ain't the law or maybe some nigga trying to score

Ain't a motherfucker deeper than me, bitch, dig

Spitting that heat rock, I'm smooth, not Pete Rock
And my, and my money on et cetera, three dots
Still get a stomach ache every time I see cops
You better run motherfucker, cause we not
You better run 'til your feet stop

Colder than a ski shop, holding on to the top
And even if I let go, I still won't d-rop

Dear Fall! You might not know what my album is called
It's ""Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor""
God willing, September is when I plan to fall
I mean drop like the temperature
Then rock on right through the winter
Put something on they mind, give em lines to remember
Aw! a lifetime remembered, which is mine
Then recorded, put it in Georges then rewind then look into
My mis-adventures, adventures into the Underworld
Hanging with them Cover Girls, this ain't my enter, nawww
On Arista, I coulda been a contender
But BMG had a different agenda
What up, LA Reid? I still see ya
You still my homeboy, won't even charge ya for a feature
I went from MC to being MS

Astaghfirullah, I'm not a prophet
But Fahrenheit 1/15 is being quoted by preachers
Far from being a leader, but I'm still being invited by teachers
With no Hennessy, and no reefer
Give him a hand, I came from hand-me-down sneakers
And I don't wanna boast or brag
But for what most niggas hope, a nigga done had
Chop game with my folk and split it in half
You ain't gotta bring it back tomorrow, a nigga can have
Rich or broke, a nigga ain't mad
Self-esteem will make a Regal ride like a Silver Seraph
Just wipe the french fries off the seat
Lean back, and I tilt my hat, uh!
And nod my head to the baseline
Freebase to the 8 times at Baseline watching Jay put it together
I wonder if he knew
While he was mumbling that this would push Lupe forever
Together, with the FNF crew
Atlantic on post, proudly present to you, uh!
Some new, something fresh, something different
A lil to the left, a lil upliftin'
A lil good game, a lil hustlin' in it
Some SB Nikes, some nice crushed linen
Don't forget the skateboard, of course, the nice women
Can I get a mic check? And a lil light dimming?
And a fresh bottle of Voss, maybe with some light lemon?
And you gotta blame my momma for the lil light-skinning
And this ain't written, I swear, Autumn
I was just recording 'em as I thought em
A YG, FNF U-P
23-year-old VP
With a flow like Laudanum, that'll getcha sleepy
But soon as they nod off, that's when I smelling-salt 'em

Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi, like Tim, it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise on the minimum wage?
And I know the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allāhu Akbar and throw in some hot cars
The things we seen on the screen is not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars—I know it
[Chorus: Kanye West & Adam Levine]
Uh, and I heard 'em say (Ooh)
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
(Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today)

And nothing lasts forever, but be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus, and one day that you see him
'Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin'
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin'
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of it now

Now let’s see, the boy’s so zesty, I’m fresh come get me
You don’t gotta know how I does it the best
And this is the guideline on how to keep fresh
Flow blue streak like Tulley, and I’m so gully
Rhyme so cold that it came with a skully
And them haters really love me
Cause they talk always seem to seep out like soda when it’s bubbly
Yea, I’m up there with a small arrow
Oh they mad cause I Shyne like Jamal Barrow?
And they say I’m so proud, but I’m like, I know
I do this thing nobly like Manu
Ten I know, grand like piano
Stack in my pocket, I could make it to the condo
I could take her and U2 like Bono
They say you got a point like Rajon Rondo

[Hook]
One, two, three, if you tryna’ get fresh like me
One, two, three, if you tryna’ get fresh like me
(Fresh like this, are you fresh like that?)
One, two, three, if you tryna’ get fresh like we

One, two, three, if you tryna’ get fresh like we
[Verse 2]
Now I’m fresh like that
I’m the best like that
I’m Aretha on your speakers so respect like that
I see them ladies in the house, they better than cold weather
So naturally my number I slip her like chancletas
And I’m the one that they came to see
Ayo, my drink keep it mixed like Amerie
I be grindin’ like a dancer, flow rarer than pandas
School of hard knocks, no I will never transfer
Money on top, my money on top
When she give me brain it’s a dummy on top
Regret if I let her take all my guap
She funny like a episode of the Boondocks
You watch, I get my point across like Swatch
I’m on another boat, don’t cross my yacht
The sonic is chronic, I know I can’t stop
I guess I got nicks like Dr. Robot

[Verse 3]
It’s time to throw a party
Hey, like my girls French, like Louie V and Cartier
Make the people jump, you could pass the Courvoisier
You gonna’ need a couple more shots, to get on my level
Hit on the pedal, gas up a female
Oh, they made cause I’m smooth like CL?
You don’t know, I’m a big deal
Stand up like Hughley, I keep it on the D.L
Yea, I’m inbox like G-mail
I get head, I need tail
But let me quit it ma’, no play
I was tryna’ break in like O.J
Okay, I be puffin on a Starbury
So if I interview, I’m acting like Marbury
They tend to get aggie
But if hate is the new love, then we fittin’ to get married

Tiny shirts, shiny jeans

I married Paris Hilton
We're at the Hilton
Limousine driver, nickname Hilton

Watch Paris Hilton
Chain Paris Hilton
Rain Paris Hilton

The Severed Garden,The Doors,"['rock', 'blues', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'metal', 'r&b', 'hip hop']","Wow, I’m sick of doubt
Live in the light of certain
South's cruel bindings
The servants have the power
Dog-men and their mean women
Pulling poor blankets over our sailors

I’m sick of dour faces
Staring at me from the TV tower
I want roses in my garden bower, dig?

Royal babies, rubies must now replace
Aborted strangers in the mud
These mutants, blood-meal
For the plant that’s plowed

They are waiting to take us
Into the severed garden
Do you know how pale and wanton thrill-full
Comes death on a strange hour?
Unannounced, unplanned for
Like a scaring over-friendly guest
You’ve brought to bed
Death makes angels of us all
And gives us wings
Where we had shoulders
Smooth as raven’s claws
No more money, no more fancy dress
This other kingdom seems by far the best
Until it’s other jaw reveals incest
And loose obedience to a vegetable law
I will not go
Prefer a feast of friends to the giant family"

I'm not listening, I'm not interested
My attention only focused on what I get
Diamond’s glistening, they call me Mr. Check
White ice lemonade, Black ice she thick
I got general ambition, life's a bitch
So I treat it real good like hoes is squeezed
My whole life, I ain't never seen a car like that
And she probably won't see the next shit I get
And a seventeen fresh, I say I guess
Successful, healthy, I live no stress
So today is the day that the big boy shine
Drop tops everywhere, I wouldn't know how to rock
Got the titties out today showing off tan lines
Bands bending in my pocket, no it's not drumline
Me and Skateboard P in the club on time
No, not on time, but it just in time

Don't you feel stupid? Look how I did it!
Look how it came to pass when I said it
We can do debit, I don't need no credit
Yes, I'm epic, look how I rep it
It's been eight years, but I broke the record
Yup, the record... yup, the record... yup, the record
(Just for the record)
Uh, I'm all that I can be
And I'll admit, I'm appalled when you envy
’Cause you can do it, too, and you can do it, too
I just happen to be the girl that they threw it to
So I'mma bounce back, and I'mma ball out
And every time that you see me I'mma go all out
And I'mma win till the ending

Cooler than a motherfucka in a Porshe lemonade coupe
Pull up in a Ferrari in your hood, get intimidated
Mutilated, Maserati, Lamborghini (are) decapitated

That I'm not the man that I say I am

But I just run around town pickin' up stacks
Some like Louis, some like Gucci
I love money, ya I love solutions
And my teenage karat ring, baby girl choosin
And I ain't hard to please baby come choose me
Lounge around, round the town with the top chopped off
You can call it lost and found ’cause my top stay down

There is so much hatred, war, and poverty

Wake up all the teachers, time to teach a new way
Maybe then they'll listen to what you have to say
Cause they're the ones who's coming up, and the world is in their hands
When you teach the children, teach them the very best you can

The world won't get no better

They're the ones who suffer and who catch all the hell
But they don't have so very long before their Judgment Day
So won't you make them happy before they pass away
[Verse 4: Melanie Fiona]
Wake up, all the builders time to build a new land
I know we can do it if we all lend a hand
The only thing we have to do is put it in our mind
Surely things will work out, cause they do every time

It's the God hour, the morning I wake up
Just for the breath of life I thank my maker
My mom say I come from hustlers and shakers
My mind build-ed on skyscrapers and acres
He said take us back to where we belong
I try to write a song as sweet as the Psalms
Though I'm the type to bear arms and wear my heart on my sleeve
Even when I fell, in God I believe
Breathe the days in
Weave through the maze and the season so amazing
Feed them and raise them
Seasons are aging: earthquakes, wars, and rumors
I want us to get by but we're more then consumers
We're more than shooters, more than looters
Created in his image, so God live through us
And even in this generation living through computers
Only love, love, love can reboot us
[Outro]
Wake up, everybody
Wake up, everybody
Need a little help, y'all
Yes I do, need a little help

Need a little help, y'all ay
Wake up everybody
Wake up everybody

[Verse 1: T.I.]
My garage is flawless, under a hundred thou' ain't allowed
Maybach triple white like I'm ridin' in a cloud
No denim on my seats, baby, you gon' need a towel
Ride sexy through the city, see me, you will be aroused
My bankroll so well-endowed
Pull bitches from MIA to ATL in style
And in crowds, catch me in Tao
On the strip in Vegas, chillin', fillin' bitches' faces with babies
Bitch, bite your tongue, this just ain't a Mercedes
Tell the ATF I'm ridin' with another three-eighty
That's my car cost—y'all thought I would fall off?
That was just a small loss, we can have a ball-off
Fly to NY, meet me at the Waldorf
Astorian, architecture Victorian
Ridin' in the past like you're drivin' a DeLorean
Hard times, never heard of those
In the 'Bach, my feet kicked up, gettin' my dick sucked with the curtains closed
And for the record, kid, my final question is:
""How your bitch gon' feel in that when you two pull up next to this?""
Hahahaha!
Maybach Music, nigga!
[Chorus: Erykah Badu & Jadakiss]

How the story goes
Money and clothes
They gon' come and go
But guess who stays the same? (Ha-HA!)
You gon' see the name (Ugh, yeah)
Stroll real slow (Yo)
When the curtains roll

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yo, piff that I'm blowin' on is fuckin' up the ozone
Plus, I keep a dope line, similar to Coldstones (Ugh)
Ice cream (Ugh), pipe dreams
Is what they have when I pull up in that light thing (Yeah)
I put a hurtin' on, I got the curtains drawn
Whoever ain't gettin' shitted on, I'm squirtin' on (Ha)
I'm in the six-deuce, fifty-sevens for the help (Yeah)
Chopper in the trunk, forty-five for the belt (Belt)
Bunch of wax dummies, all you guys gonna melt (Melt)
Live for your kids (Ugh), die for yourself (Die)
Bottles in the sky if you ride for the wealth (Ride)
Peas on the block, pies on the shelf
If I ain't in the back of the 'Bach, I ain't in nothin' else
Haha, I'm somethin' else

Time to make a blind motherfucker recognize
Ammunition got the competition nonexistent
Had the bubble crack, but didn't have a pot to piss in
I'll double that—how dare you try to knock a nigga?
Street scholar, graduated, no father figure
Still tote chrome, check my chromosomes
Meet me halfway with things in a mobile home
Money machines, yeah, they rrring! like a mobile phone
I'm a 7-Up and need a Coca-Cola loan
I'm in the hood like I'm James Evans
Cashmere handmade sweater
Me and money got a vendetta
Lookin' back, to tell the truth, I could've did better (Woo)
Parents never had a good job
Now it's Black American Express cards

Money Over Bullshit,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
My niggas got scarred grills, skully hats and gats be fullies
Brrrat! Cars peel, the East Coast cartel
Rats get their tails snapped and trapped
The snitches in the streets and the snitches who rap
Pure euphoria, a dose of death to all of you
Coroner choruses sung from The Bridge to Astoria
Dreams of falling in the elevator, passing floors
Suddenly stop, the doors open up to a brick wall
I can smell the haters, wishful thinkers, bad-luck prayers
Picture your tarot cards and bodyguards getting sprayed up
Sabotaging my makeup, my watches get laced up
Even if they indicted Jacob
Forensics, paramedics, carry cowards off
Defibrillators shock to your chest, try to cough
They die and hit Hell from an iron
I'm fly in YSL, I'm paid from this shit
Got bitches high as hell, and they fucking like AIDS don't exist
They get sent to your hotel, I'm made in this shit
Put a barrel in a capo mouth 'til his scalp come out
You a kid, you don't live what you rap about
King poetic, too many haters to count
Too much paper to count (QB, bitch!)
[Chorus]
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn (Mourn)
Money over bullshit,pistols over brawn
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn (My own strength, nigga! That's what I'm afraid of!)
Money over bullshit, pistols over brawn (Hahaha)
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength

Got seven candles lit, black wallpaper, black carpet
Thinking about which nigga to target
You kill a nigga today, he lives forever
So I plotted out smarter, there'll be no martyrs
Black TEC on the table, Mag' four-four
Black negligée on my bitch, she's at the door
Black fish eggs, nigga, that's the caviar
You niggas fish-made, y'all niggas is fifth grade, niggas
It's fifty ways to dissect the General
If I give ya the top five, you will not survive
Rule 1: Cocksucker, keep my name from your tongue
Rule 2: Thought you knew—don't fuck with God's Son
Rule 3: See, matter fact, I just wait
If y'all reach top five, then I'ma eat y'all alive
Each one of ya guys that claim hip-hop is still alive
Like y'all ain't in agreement with Nas
I said it's dead motherfucker, it's dead, bitch…

Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn (It's dead, bitch!)
Money Over Bullshit, pistols over brawn
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength

Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength

[Verse 3]
From crack pushers to Lac' pushers and ambushers
And morticians to fortresses, case-dismisses
Laced in riches, cake ridiculous
From nickel and dimin' to trickin' them diamonds
Vegas, places in Switzerland
From 9 blastin' to I don't have to blast mine
They blast mine, black 9, you flatline, my cash climb
Buy rare art, antique pieces, Mona Lisa's, own no leases
Five-star restaurant eaters; don't forget who your peeps is
'Sposed to dine with you, sip that good wine with you
Only if they grind with you or slang for ya
Seen niggas live, laugh, party and die in that very same corner
Pretty girls glance at us, status unconceivable
Private planes landed out in Teterboro, weed I twirl
Once even gave me a phobia, that I be in a spot trapped like Madame Zenobia's with this kid eyein' my Rollie up

Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn

Dissin' me is the wrong mistake to make
Don't do that, ddt nigga Jake the snake
The harlem earthquake can't escape the shake
Ima point blank pistol, face to face, great

Me and you is like a UFO landin' on a tonka
The human bomb not anansi kamikaze
Try to stop me? you need more than 106 to try and rock see
I'm not as cocky as I used to be

So if this dude should eat, this dude being me

Cuz she got bills to pay, and it ain't no chores to play
Only thang outside is a sand box and a gate to hate
And the show ain't gon' show money, soul of a show money
Only thang around town, Brooklyn is dat dope money
Dem boys on the corna, and they pockets gittin' stronga
Momma did it fo' the hunger
We sold about a hundred, err'body still runnin'
And we sittin' on the block
Cuz the dope feigns rollin'

I ain't trynna be no actor

Instead while these dudes beg for head
They got the game twisted, heavy traffic in this rap shit
Look how my lane shifted, elevated my game, lifted my name
Now these lame niggas could never get it
Like that bad bitch you wanted but could never hit it
Clever with it, my flow like a devil spit it and heaven sent it
So high, if I dropped I would fall for 11 minutes
So yeah, I operate on a higher plane, my thoughts take a higher train
It's dope, then you should know the suppliers name
It's J. Cole, set of horns and a halo
And all these Jose Canseco's wanna text us like Waco
Its hard to remain faithful niggas be throwing hate
Yo I'm in a league of my own so what the fuck would I play for?
Some next niggas almost slid in but didn't fit in
Naw I ain't Maury Povich but who the fuck is you kiddin?

Try not to show stress, I guess the flow is protested like a sit in

Now honey, aye is it destiny or is it money you're feelin
Heard rumors of a deal and now you thinkin a million
Pardon my paranoid mind but I'm starin in the mirror livin in fear that things a never be the same
No one left for me to blame but myself 'cause I asked for this
Headed for fame but in my brain, hey can I last in this?
Aye five years I'll probably laugh at this
Try not to let it wear me out like a bad bitch with fashion sense

Living the life of ice is nice, and fancy cars and all that shit
Going to bars menage tois, and nice ass broads that we just flipped
Up in the mall they call us dogs, but we gon ball until we fall
If you ain't living like us, well bitch you ain't living at all my life yeah

[Lil' Flip]
My life-my life-my life, it ain't great
Cause some days, I barely had food on my plate
So when I get some, a nigga real greatful
Cause when you in the ghetto, rich people hateful
With the he say and she say, from Keisha to Nay-Nay
From Nay-Nay to Shante, Shante and Andre
Sha'll I go on, about the shit I see everyday
Like a whole bunch of black folks, with no place to stay
Nowhere to lay, nowhere to pray
Just imagine, if you wore the same clothes thirty days
With scuffed up dirty J's, and plenty holes in your shirt
And won't nobody help you, they treat you like dirt
It's my life, I married the streets and made the hood my home
And I'ma represent this shit, till I'm gone
And even when I'm gone, you can listen to my songs
Cause I'ma let you know, what's right and what's wrong
It's wrong to borrow money, and never give it back
But if your family poor, it ain't wrong to sell crack
It's right to make cash, and make sure your click eat
And it's right to do a feature, with a nigga like me
Cause I'ma tell the truth, about everything I say
I've been through some shit, nigga I came a long way
From boy to man, from zero to grands
From no shows to mo' shows, and now I'm a man

See I be trying to spit some knowledge, to these kids
But should I tell 'em go to college, or quit and find a gig
Cause the world don't really give you jack, and if you black
Fucking round with that crack, get you some time on your back
That's why I always, try to keep it clean
The FED time got my brother, doing fifteen
At bed time, send my prayers up
And I stay prepared for the money in the air, I'm trying to have stuff
That's why, I'm all off in the rap game
And worldwide, trying to spread it 'cross the map mayn
But black pride, got me thinking there's no limitation
Gotta survive regardless, any situation well

I'm grinding (where you at), on the block
(what's that) hand full of rocks, looking for the cops
(HPD) pull up, I wouldn't wanna be em
(what you do) hop the first gate, see em
Thank God I'm still breathing, cause I'm a little heathen
I'm the type of cat, that start shit for no reason
Use to have meetings, with the church deacon
Cause I was doing other shit, while he was preaching
And every single thing, he was saying came true
And when we got our shit together, in 9-2
And boy I was a fool, at making that cash
Hit licks flipping bricks, right after every class

Four niggas from Watts, operate with rhymes
If you woke up late, then I'ma pull out the nine
Millimete but it's bound to go deep, as I proceed
To the next line, born in LA, Watts raised me up
Not Compton where if I was a sell-out I'd be a
Stupid motherfucker but I'm not, no I'm not a zero
Tell you whatup, c'mon, niggas ain't hero
You ran 100 Miles to avoid a jack
The Bottom group will meet yo' ass on the tracks
It's vinyl put to walls, you can't hang, how can your figure
Let's be honest -- have you ever squeezed a trigger?
In the late 70's yo the courthouse was built
A year later the first nigga was kilt
(Caught stealing hubcaps, is that a fact?)
Nah but I'm sure it was somethin like that
Where I'm from niggas are BROKE, and fuck bein RUTHLESS

Hey close the doors and windows, hide your goods
When the Bottom of Watts is in your motherfuckin hood
Hold my zone with a vicious appetite
And we'll take your shit (after we take your life)
That's why these suckers think twice about comin to Watts
You know it's real gangbangers, murders and dope spots
(This ain't no lookalike shit) my city's for real
So don't commit suicide, come to Watts and get killed
And you fake motherfuckers ?takin all of the streets?
I'ma let my posse tell you (that shit sound weak!)
My lyrics don't lie niggas die everyday
You better check your map, cause Watts in in LA
(South Central motherfucker) where the shit is CRITICAL
Brothers killin brothers makin blacks look PITIFUL
You wanna make a change and roll with my crew?

Eighty-eight was the time (in ninety-one we had to wait!)

But the topic of discussion is rhymes perpetrated
Play at the role of a ganster (you gettin faded!)
Talkin that same gang, you down with the real thang
Check the charts, it's nineties niggas still dyin man

Straight from the niggas in Garden Projects
If you don't know what set, try the heart of the city
A controversial rap, but we feel no pity
The job wasn't done (someone had to do it)
They called up my crew (and we got right to it)
When you think of LA (niggas think Compton)
(But where was Compton when Watts was stompin)
We speakin on the 70's and even the 60's
Compton was somewhere singin ?Saint Dixie?
Back then it was a place for the upper class folks
The other side of town our parents were broke
Blacks moved to Compton, they thought it was a privelege
I remember when they first built the Village
They try to make it appear that Watts is forgotten
OFTB means Operatin From The Bottom
The last nigga played us (I shot him!)
We comin on strong yeah we must check Compton

Lookin at the window thinkin should I break out
Honey Bun steps on the set
They call him Honey Bun but he's kinda hard, bet
And Vince is a madman
Crazy motherfucker with a gun in his right hand
The new house steps in for the new air
And Lala calls 'em to the square
He's a white boy so they wanna gank
I got a shank, motherfucker better think
10 B 3 is the location of the cell block
Where the deputies are happy when they clock out
The boss comes in and hollers, ""Rec time""
I'm my own boss, I got my own mind
Little Robert is a kid that you shouldn't trust
Motherfucker tried him out bit the fuckin dust
The deputies ran to the cell block
The posse's in effect, so we bailed out
Made it to the elevator swiftly
Takin out the cameras was easy
Then jetted through the first door
Went to get some guns and we'd meet 'em on the sixth floor
The plan was to escape from this hell hole
They couldn't stop us, cause 10 B 3 was too cold
Shots were fired and a lot of people died
Fuck a trustee, nigga's on the other side
I knew a homie who's a sergeant
But the brother wore a badge and a gun so I dodged him
If we ever met face to face
I'd buck him down and I'd shoot him in his fuckin face
Cause this is a crew song
And if you ain't down with B 3 you gettin clicked on
Gary West was strapped with a gat
Shot a guard in his back as we ransacked
Headed for the first floor
The hard part, but we was ready for a real war
Yo man, that was the easy part, man
Gettin out that motherfuckin cell, man
But yo, we get out this elevator, man
We gotta start bustin ass
(Man, fuck them motherfuckers)

Here is the set and the action as it takes place
We on the first floor headed for the big chase
Over the loudspeaker they shouted red alert
The deputies were goin bezerk
Out of the elevators we crept out
Honey Bun and Vincent fired as we stepped out
A lady deputy spotted us and she yelled, ""Stop""
I said yo, she turned her head and all you heard was pop
By now they knew we wasn't fakin
Blood over the floor, bodies layin there shakin
One of the homies got popped
It was police, I figured he was an undercover cop
I guess he knew he wouldn't take that
That's why he's layin on the floor, .45 bullet in his back
Lala made it to the computer room
A guard followed him, so that's where he met his doom
As he erased all the records of the cell block
The captain caught him so he turned and he shot
By now HPD was notified
But little did they know the outcome would be a homicide
Better yet a massacre, a disaster
10 B 3 comin atcha
Yo man, there is Boss in the van, man
And five-o right across the motherfuckin street
Man fuck that man
Yo man, let's just get to the hideout man, see where we go from there
Aight bet

Back in the city in the streets we dwell
It is better to be free than in a fuckin cell
They couldn't take us when they tried to
So if you ever heard the B 3 soft you bein lied to
Wait a minute before we step light
Vince, make the block and make sure that the escape's tight
There's nobody who can swallow us
Two blue suits lay in peace who tried to follow us
The posse's safe, we in our hideout
The mood is mellow, the noise has died out
Makin plans for the future to come
Money on our mind, Harold says, ""Let's go get some""
Robert looks out the window
He yelled, ""Jump out boys at the front door!""
It was time for the fun to end, or begin
Either way B 3 couldn't win
Kicked in the door and they yelled out, ""Freeze!""
""Everybody on their motherfuckin knees!""
Honey Bun reached for the cop's gun
Now 10 B 3 is minus one
From out the backroom Harold shoots
Now a cop wears a red and a blue suit
Gun's empty and he flees from the scene
Shot from behind Harold dead at 17
Gary West and Vince broke out runnin
Out the backdoor, HPD gunnin
Layin in the backyard, blood and buckshots
Pushin up daisies cause they went the wrong route
Yo E, told 'em motherfuckers was comin the other way, man
Shit man
(10 B 3 comin atcha)
But yo, we can't sweat that, gee
So why don't we just call Scarface and get our dope

Pos prints the peace on his jeans or Girbauds
But let the herd know if beef they wanna throw
Lunches of punches is what I bestow
Oodles of O's enhance my ho's at mic checks
O's take the shape of medallions and specs
And don't forget the O's that let the air in my nose
Breathe in the fresh as the stale hit the road
Girls ask for flicks and I'll plot the pose
Eat the Al Greens, won't sniff the Kurt Blows
Mase got something to say and it goes
(Maceo is rocking on the radio)
[Chorus: Dove]
Now I think we're talking 'bout the oodles of O's ya know
I think we're talking 'bout the oodles of O's
I think we're talking 'bout the oodles of O's ya know
I think we're talking 'bout the oodles of O's
I think we're talking 'bout the oodles of O's ya know
I think we're talking 'bout the oodles of O's
Yeah, we're talking 'bout the oodles of O's ya know
I think we're talking 'bout the oodles of O's

[Verse 3: Pos]
Hoods like to play macho, you know
Guns going ""Bo!"", people hit the floor
Don't have a piece but an arrow and bow
Target it firm cause I'm head Comancho
Charging barricades like a raging rhino
The donuts come big and some in jumbo
The landlord is finished but before I go
I'll give a shout out to Quest and my fellow Jungle Bros

[Verse 4: Dove]
Knocked by the dock of the bay by the shore
Swimming in the rhythm of the hi-de-hi-de-ho
Punk Pinocchios gotta go, gotta go
(What's the reason?) to be cheerful
Season is breeze, time to pimp promote
Nuts can no flow if the shade is in the dough
On with me hat, d-d-duh-duh-doh
Dreadlock is heading out the door y'all
[Outro: Dove]
We're selling O's, y'all
We're selling O's and O's
We're selling O's at the corner store y'all
We're selling O's, y'all
We're selling oodles and oodles and oodles
And oodles of O's, y'all
We're selling O's, y'all

Yo, it's three thousand thirty
I want y'all to meet Deltron Zero, hero, not no small feat
It's all heat in this day and age
I'll raid your grave, anything it takes to save the day
Neuromancer, perfect blend of technology and magic
Use my rapping so you all can see the hazards
Plus entertainment where many are brainless
We cultivated a lost art of study and I brought a buddy
Automator, harder slayer, fascinating combinations
Cyber warlords are aggravating abominations
Arm a nation with hatred? We ain't with that
We high-tech archaeologists searching for knick-knacks
Composing musical stimpacks that impacts the soul
Crack the mold of what you think you rapping for
I used to be a mech soldier but I didn't respect orders
I had to step forward, tell them this ain't for us
Living in a post-apocalyptic world morbid and horrid
The secrets of the past they hoarded
Now we just boarded on a futuristic spacecraft
No mistakes black it's our music we must take back

Del I'm feeling like a ghost in a shell
I wrote this in jail playing host to a cell
For the pure verbal
They said my sentence was equivalent to murder
Just another hurdle, I bounced through a portal
I knew they had the mindstate of mere mortals
My ears morphed to receptors that catch your
Every word about gravity control
And the families they hold for handsome ransoms
On the run with a handgun, blast bioforms; I am warned
That a planet-wide manhunt with cannons
Will make me, abandon, my foolish plan of uprisin'
Fuck dyin', I hijack a mech
Control it with my magical chants, so battle advanced
Through centuries of hip-hop legacy, mega speed
Hyperwarp to Automator's crib and light the torch
They can't fight the force
Victory is ours once we strike the source
Enterprisin' wise men look to the horizon
Thinkin' more capitalism is the wisdom
And imprison, all citizens empowered with rhythm
We keep the funk alive by talking with idioms

Yo it's three thousand thirty
I want y'all to meet Deltron Zero, and Automator

It's an eternal evil concerned with thievery
Medieval prehistoric rhetoric well we ahead of that
Lay it down with sound waves that pound pavement
Original minstrels my central processing unit
Is in tune with my heart for this art
Not artificial cause that makes it hard to miss you
Copycats finish last in the human race
Staying glued to safes too prude to take a buddha break
We got espers that let us bless with fresh shit
Undetected by yes men
Questing for five fleeting nanoseconds of fame
Protecting the brain from conspiracies against my cosmos
While I flow to Neo-Tokyo with Opio
Or discuss combustible rust clusters with Plus
Evade cyber police in a computer crib confuse the kids
But I can make a kickin' rhyme that's sacred
Telepathic mind that takes his greatness from the Matrix
Esper rhyme professor rushes on colder pressures
With correction measures
While half the world's a desert
Cannibals eat human brains for dessert
Buried under deep dirt, mobility inert
I insert these codes for the cataclysm
Ever since I had the vision use my magnetism
In this modern metropolis that tries to lock us up
Under preposterous laws, it's not for us
[Chorus: Del the Funky Homosapien as Deltron Zero]
Yo, it's three thousand thirty
I want y'all to meet Deltron Zero, and Automator

If niggas could look inside my mind, you'll find
Where bodies are buried, first look past the hotties who dimes
Go to the center, enter with caution, past the brain cell graveyard
Where weed's responsible for memory loss
Let's witness, the horrific, the stench'll make you nauseous
See what I seen every day I live with this torture
Lightin' spliffs up to stay high like 24 hours
Sleep with my heat, wash with my gun in the shower
My tongue is power, it thrills women, kills demons
Long as I'm still breathin' I'm still winnin', I'll teach 'em
The hood converted from trey bags to 20's a girl
Everybody had money, every summer was real ill
Four-finger rings, dope dealers, 'caine/Kane
No Half Steppin' with flat tops when Rakim reigned
Radios on card tables, Benetton, the Gods buildin'
Ask for today's mathematics, we Allah's children
And this was goin' on in every New York ghetto
Kids listened, Five Percenters said it's pork in Jell-o
We coincide, we in the same life, maybe a time difference
On a different coast, but we share the same sunlight
Your part of the world might be like colors and gangs
While on my side, brothers'll murder for different things
But it all revolve around drugs, fame and shorties
Stuck for your bling, stripped for your chain, the same story
From, Czechoslovakia to Texas metropolis
Them treacherous rastas in the Mexican mafias
Be scrappin' with tats on they back, violent wars
Nothin' less than a lethal injection if ever caught
Courtrooms, eagles and flags, American style
While in our world, the ghetto stays incredibly foul
Watchin' for paint chips, don't want no lead in yo' child
But them gangstas put lead in yo' child, the bezzy be out
The chain be like a hundred K
Shinin' since Roxanne Shante' made Runaway; that's been a minute
Genesis is deep, my features are that of a God
It's not a facade it's a fact, these rappers wanna be Nas
My Exodus doesn't exist, I'll never leave the streets, it's all in my mind
Even with sleep I'm duckin' nines in my dreams
Si-rens, wide awake, why'd I think it would change
Can't hide when you famous or even try to do the same things
Like, somebody's always watchin'
My life before I, walk out the door I size up every option
Eyes cut every direction, it's like God or guns
Which is better protection? Can't decide, that's a hard one
I mean they wanna see me in prison, the chains bamboozled

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long, that
Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc

Fool, I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight

I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams

Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye

And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger

Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches

So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness

Started believing that I was the greatest

Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night,Dylan Thomas,['country'],"Do not go gentle into that good night.
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light."

No key to the Benz cause its voice activated
When my brother get off like, I know hatas have to hate it
[Hook]

[Paul Wall]
Here I come turn your head, why your girl turning red
You remind me of the type of person, that would turn fed
Turn your frown into a smile, she don't like you take a hint
Turn the corner, everybody stare at color changing tents
A lot of money I spent, to make blind people squint
I tip the waiter enough money, to pay for his rent
I hog the lane, listen how my horn be oinking
My diamonds got more points, than a point guard pointing
I'm badder than some sun glasses, better cover your eyes
I drive fast jaws drop, and eye brows rise
I hold it down like Sprint, mouth looking like gold bricks
Looking like stalagmites, hanging off my lips
I had aspirations of balling, ever since I was six
My record's like mosquito bites, every DJ wants to itch it
Every time people staring, and pow wow mix
They call a ambulance, to help em get they face on fix

[Hook]

[Chamillionaire]
When it come to riding chrome, we some veteran pros
Matter fact, I'm living larger than David Letterman's nose
Don't play stupid and act like, I never said it before
I'd rather chase a set of them vogues, instead of them hoes
Whoa Kimosabi, find me in a Denali
Or hopping out the Impali, if I'm sweating its probably
Not the damn sun, cause this heater strapped to my body
Whoa Kimosabi, think I'm bluffing then try me
Mirror mirror on the wall, I'm watching all them laws
So I can see who's plotting on me, when my twinkies crawl
They staring at us dog, that boy Lew Hawk is not
The type to let some drama pop, and then sit back and watch
Niggas just sit back and watch, while we sit back and drop
Haters see more red dots, than a kid with chicken pots
If you want it its whatever, you haters need to go get a
Like we cheddar getters, for 2K1 and forever
Whoa Kemosabe, get you done bring corrected
When you see a color changing necklace, you better respect it

Keep Your Coat On - 38091,Pudgee tha Phat Bastard,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","Yo, you ain't stayin too long
Keep your coat on, you gotta go
You got, to go
Umm, listen up..

[Pudgee]
From Queens to Boogie Down you know I can Boogie Down
From Mt. Vernon downtown they call it Uptown
You can tell it in the style of the rhyme of course
Born in Harlem, lived on the concourse
Wicked in the lyrical, roughneck individual
Denise Williams told you that it's gonna take a miracle
To slow the flow, though it can't be stopped
And Donnie Wahlberg's the New Kid on the Block (I know)
Keep clockin you won't get the time of day
Throw a clap I deserve an encore Fonda Ray
A standin ovation, ""Rhythm Nation: 1814""
""In Control"" like dreams (?) (you know that)
See it in his eyes and from the other side
Shalamar dead give-away, nothin to hide
Ain't nothin fair in life but it's fair to let you know
You ain't gettin too far so, keep on your coat
Keep on your coat
[Chorus]
You gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go
You gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go SO KEEP YOUR COAT ON
You gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go
You gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go SO KEEP YOUR COAT ON
You gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go
You gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go SO KEEP YOUR COAT ON
You gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go
You gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go..

[Pudgee]
Keep on your coat no more the cat stays away
The mice or men will have a very short stay (time to go)
To us of the new they give nuff respect
Be in the ""Next Generation"" just like a Star Trek (Captain Kirk)
And we shoot the knots you better play my team
Givin out black eyes like Tyson did Mitch Green
There ain't no slaves like back in the days
So John Wayne is probably turnin in his grave
Cause paleface tried to keep it all undercover
And didn't want to give credit to anyone of color
It was a black man's recipe, you know the Colonel lied
He had no idea on how to make Kentucky Fried (nope!)
But he will tell you that he did, if you asked him so
To keep you from knowin what he thinks you shouldn't know
White supremacists exist from coast to coast
But there's the young black man so, keep on your coat
Keep on your coat
[Chorus]

[Pudgee]
Seems like somebody got it all wrong
All along, you was goin on and on, sayin please put me on
(Please listen to my demo) To put me on when I wasn't no one was willin
And now I get congratulations like (?)
The, Gregory Hines of rap is tap-dancin
And you be givin me more Cheers than Ted Danson (Cheers nigga)
I know the deal on you we can go way back
You know that, so leave the baldhead thing to Kojak
Keep your coat on, you ain't stayin too long
And by the end of this song, I'm really hopin you'll be gone
Cause I don't think you wanna hear what I have to say
Spit more verses out my mouth than Andrew Dice Clay
So run along, gettin fronted on I'm too smart for that
Like Light(?) said on The Jane(?) Show, ""I'm too large for that""
I keep it rockin yes I rock don't rock the boat
And on that note, it's cold outside - keep on your coat

.. and I'm gone"
With You,Lil Wayne,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Shawty badder than a three-year-old
Keep playing and I'ma eat her like a pita roll
I'm just saying, with my love I could feed her soul
Two-day getaway and we don't need our clothes
We at the pool and she looking like a center fold
Two tattoos but she say she getting plenty mo
She got Indian in her family, Seminole
Me and shawty go together like chemicals
And she get mad when I call other women hoes
You send her rose, I pick some flowers and send her those
Tall glass of Merlot get her in the mode
Two tall glasses of Merlot get her out her robe
I whisper in her ear then lick round her lobe
And when she check her watch, it’s never time to go
And with her brain she should make the honor roll
And when I came she caught me like a common cold

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit

With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you and only you

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I say damn I must be left
'Cause you the best I ever seen, right
Shawty put me on, you got me going like some green lights
See you with your girls, they probably telling you that he ain't right
Bet they be the same bitches at the wedding throwing rice
Let's get together over night
Shawty I'm a pro and you are looking like the prototype
Ms. Cita, I took your advice
Sometimes you got to blow it twice then shake it up and roll the dice
I'm cruising on the road of life but I need a passenger
Appetite for loving, ma I'm hungry like a scavenger
I be on that lavender
I be in the bath with her
Then I gotta go under that water like a mariner

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit

With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you and only you

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Now she don't know about me but I'ma put her on it
And she ain't sure about me but can't go without me
We probably ain't supposed to be together
But I wonder if our love affair could last forever
And shawty I'm with you
Smoke a lot of weed but I could never forget you
Then I told her to her face
If everyone was like you, the world would be a better place

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit

Got a sign on my dick that say ""Bad Bitches Only""
I don't drink champagne, it make my stomach hurt

Got a silencer on the gun, that bitch go pew
Got a mean ass swagger, my bitches do too
Yeah all my niggas nuts and I'm a loose screw

Yes I talk shit, got to defecate to conversate
Weezy fuck the world, yep I fuck it 'til it ovulate
Get her to the crib, get in that pussy and just dominate
Weezy F. Baby and the 'F' is for fornicate
Polo Ralph Lauren, bitch, that's what my pajamas say
Big tall glass of some shit you can't pronounciate
Boogers in the bezel of my watch with the vomit face
And still I do not give you motherfuckers the time of day
Pistol in your mouth, I can not make out what you trying to say
And if they want a war
Then tell them motherfuckers ""Bombs away""

It's just hard to just keep goin'
It's like I feel empty inside without you bein' here
I would do anything man, to bring you back
I'd give all this shit, shit don't mean nothing

Goes out to everyone that has lost someone
That they truly loved (C'mon, check it out)

Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (That's right)
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anythin' to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death

Every step I take, every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray

In my heart is where I'll keep you, friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts Big I just can't define (Can't define)
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone (Can't believe you're gone)
Give anything to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death

One glad morning
When this life is over

I'm popping champagne, drinking till I'm jumping out the window
Heh, if the autotune's gone
Bet they all will tune in, so I'ma do it bigger than
An Audemar wrist watch, hip-hop's slackin'
Why they getting Grammys when these niggas is actin'
They phony, should get Tonys for the things that they be yappin'
It's utterly bologna, so I'm Muslim to these rappers
Fuck yappin', they lucky we don't clap 'em
And have them peoples leakin' like they CD isn't mastered
CD is in plastic, these niggas is has-beens
We ain't makin' friends while these niggas is Anistons
Dig, these niggas is fake joe
Hip-hop need a wake-up, we the fuckin' clock radios

If we wasn't so original, then we'd be criminal
Wale and K'naan, they don't know is there radio
How the hell did they fit the TV in the radio?
[Verse 2: Wale]
They told me go in; no problem, I'ma go in
Ain't shy away from drama, I ain't run away from no man
And there ain't been no buster, prepared for you suckers
Then they'll play with Mario Brothers when it was Duck Hunt
That's words to my mama, since I wasn't a starter
A nigga been a star before I forfeited my scholar-
Ship, didn't finish college, shit wasn't a problem
Shit, when homecoming is here I'm who they call up
So I still be on that yard with a Philly of that Marley
From the city, the Philly women willing to menage
Though, I put 'em on pause since Manilli been involved
Though, everybody's on me like the Milli beat partner
I'm from the D-Dot where we not no beatboxers
We talkin' B blockers keep us with deep pockets
See not no fad or no internet phenom
But he be's on that web like he be's with Pete Parker
Me I'm naija and my partner's Somalian
K'naan and my buzz is too big like Kamala
Ballin', Folarin so goddamn hard

I don't know why the industry wanna keep me a secret
And Wale been tellin' other rappers take a deep breath
And don't perform after him or you might regret
I guess they didn't get the memo or the leaflet
You know if you was harder than me then you'd be lead
And if you had more street cred then you'd be dead
And I'm Somali so I guess I'm just tryna eat bread
Fuckin' with my people well that's called the Heath Ledge
Needless to say I turn rap beef to piglets
Make you speechless, make you bloody, make you teethless
Then the blood drip on the floor poison pieces
I been on more red carpets than Ryan Seacrest
Don't cross me, cause my friend, I'm no Jesus
I don't turn cheeks, I draw blood like leeches
And my friend's aim at knees, sparking heaters
Get your ass privileges with parking meters
Do I condone it or is this some kind of small talk
Course not, I'm big like horse nut
Under pressure I don't sweat like my pores shut
I'm from the tin shacks where mishaps get fixed fast
By click-clacks and big bwaps
And inside they think rap's soft
My pen sparks the benchmark I fench off tar
No sixteen, no vaccine, I'm so sick my ten bars cough

The Second Coming,William Butler Yeats,['country'],"Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.

Surely some revelation is at hand;
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert
A shape with lion body and the head of a man
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
The darkness drops again, but now I know
That twenty centuries of stony sleep
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?"

Until the day that I die (Until the motherfuckin' day that I die)
Aight, bitch?

[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm into voodoo, tarot cards and Ouija boards
Lightin' candles campin' out at haunted beach resorts
I write the dark shit, and rap about perverted violence
Ghost stories of people murdered on deserted islands
Dressed in jean shorts, high tops and tube socks
Holdin' a rifle, with a life full of drama like 2Pac's
Jumpin' off rooftops drunk after I do shots
Landin' in someone's backyard gettin' chewed up by two rots
I got a new watch and two rings with huge rocks
This rap shit got cash comin' out the blue like nude cops
I use to sell pizzas, now I got twelve visas
So tell Jesus that I'ma quit sinnin' when hell freezes
[Hook]
That's why my brain is out of order
That's probably why my nights are gettin' colder and my days seem shorter
But as the world turns and I keep growin' older
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over
Bitch, till hell freezes over
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over
And as the world turns and I keep growin' older
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes (over)

[Verse 2]
Yo, I used to be too heavy in that cruising Gratiot crap
I think I fucked my head up listenin' to acid rap
I go to parties bumpin' Nasty Nas's new song
And smoke pot 'til I get high and stare at shit for too long
Like this weed is laced, ain't it? It tastes tainted
The whole place fainted, I woke up with my face painted
Spaced out like Sci-Fi TV, ""Fuck ICP, buy my CD!"" (Yeah)
That's what I'm screamin' while I'm handin' out promo tapes of my debut
Tellin' bitches, ""Let me eat your pussy while I shave you!""
Ain't no shame in my game, I turn the party out
Makin' everybody shout for the rapper with potty mouth

[Hook]
That's why my brain is out of order
That's probably why my nights are gettin' colder and my days seem shorter
But as the world turns and I keep growin' older
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over
Bitch, till hell freezes over
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over
And as the world turns and I keep growin' older
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over

Uh, was always smartmouthed and quick-witted
But somethin' was always missin' like six digits, lucky seven
Probably poppa, little nigga so they picked on him, hassled him
Things changed when I hassled back, so, David hit the pavement
With this grapple rap, Snapple fact: you rather wack
While I am poppin' like a snappin' crack
So high you could see like Tallahass, the opposite of cataracts
Matter fact I am Farmer John milkin' cattle tracks
Action packed nipple squeezin', boy colder than sniffle season
Simple genius, go hard and spit bits of semen
So when the street is split, don't act surprised, agree with it
The gang of wolves that creeps in crypts
As deep as Dawson's Creek and shit
I pray they got gills either that or grab some floaties
I know I got skills, why you think I'm posted boastin'?
Braggin', tell these faggots to stop naggin'
'Cause them Wolf Gang niggas threw them off the bandwagon like

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Uh, was always fucked up as shit with it
But I didn't cross the line until the bridge hit it, troll
I got you niggas nervous like virgins flirtin' with Uncle Mervin
Fuckin' y'all with no lubricant, go grab the detergent
I preach to demons at your church, now I'm the newest sermon
Wearin' nothin' but they fuckin' blast with the matchin' turban
I drive through white suburbans in the black Suburban swervin'
Hittin' curbs and blastin' Erick Sermon, drunk off English bourbon
I'm stealin' purses, rapin' nurses, I'm a crooked surgeon
And treat the beat like sanitized Nazi puss, I'm a German
I'm squirtin' while I'm masturbatin' and regurgitatin'
From eatin' Miley Cyrus salad pussy platter they were servin'
My only purpose is to jerk it cause it has a curve
So bitches hate to do me like ex-convict community service
This my Zombie Circus, you better get a fuckin' ticket
Odd Future Wolf Gang, like they're filmin' Twilight in this bitch
[Verse 3: Earl Sweatshirt]
I'm back on my sixty six sick shit
Flowin' like the blood out the competition's slit wrists
She lick it up, Dracula, then spit it back, back at ya
She mad as fuck, stuck in the back of a black Acura
Fed her acid now the duct tape quacks back at her
Hello Heather yellow feathers, now you ain't laughin', huh?

[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator]
Bitch, you're barely breathin', leavin' on the back of the boat
While I fill you up with semen from the Wolf Gang team and
Flowin' like the creampie inside of your daughter
Oughta eat the bitch with salt and wash it down with a gallon of water
I grab the saw and sawed her arm off and auctioned it
And dip her teeth in gold molds and flossed the shit
Fuckin' awesome, spittin' box of trees, got you niggas
Shakin' like it's Parkinsons from the clitoris of Kelly Clarkson's dick
Ironin' you niggas now it's time to starch the shit
Drown your bitch in a tub of cum and throw a shark in it
Find a random abandoned garage and go to park in it
Find Earl laying on the burgundy carpet, pull my knife out
Sharpen it, stab him, put a arch on it
Pour unleaded gas on him, get the Zippo and spark the shit
Hop back in the van and then depart the bitch
Killed him on his own track, the faggot shouldn't have started it"

Crashing while jacking off
To buffering vids of Asher Roth eating apple sauce
Sent to Earth to poke Catholics in the ass with saws
And knock blunt ashes into their caskets, and laugh it off
Twisted, sicker than mad cattle, in fact I'm off
Six different liquors, with a Prince wig plastered on
Stop screaming, bitch, you shouldn't be that alarmed
When Big Lips is in the attic, armed with an addict's arm
Earl puts the ""ass"" in ""assassin""
Puts the pieces of decomposing bodies in plastic
Puts them in a pan and mixes it up with scat
Then gobbles it like fat black bitches and catfish
It so happens that I'm so haphazardous
I'll puke a piece and put it on a hook and fucking cast the shit
I'm askin' that you faggot rap actors take action
And get a hall pass for this class-act shit
How the fuck I fit an axe in a satchel?
Slip capsules in a glass, she dizzy rascal
Party staff baffled, asking where her ass go
In my room, redefining the meaning of black holes
Go on, suck it up; but hurry, I got nuts to bust
And butts to fuck and ups to shut and sluts to fuckin' uppercut
It's O.F., buttercup, go ahead, fuck with us
Without a doubt, a sure-fire way to get your mother fucked
Ask her for a couple bucks, shove a trumpet up her butt
Play a song, invade her thong
My dick is having guts for lunch, as well as supper
Then I'll rummage through her ruptured cunt
Found the mustard
Fucking nosey neighbors notice something's up
""What you doing?"" – nothing much
Would shout some other stuff

Cotton soft pussy, them Odd niggas is Molotov

Every night I wonder
If it's Hell or Heaven I'm dwellin'?
Does Hell have the pearly gates?
Or is Heaven a deadly robbery at 7 Eleven?

[Verse 1]
I'm not afraid of death
I'm embracin death
So if I take your breath away
Expect the day to rest
The sun comes down underground
Where the hedgehogs be, I am undone now
Broke apart from the broken heart
I know the stars are in alignment
For Charles' assignment
How simple is this
My only mission is to live and exist
I was given a gift difference is
I was made in God's image, ya dig?
So I guess it was me that presented the gift
Accented with a twist
I get it how I live
I live just to live
I give a fuck if
You don't consider fuck a curse word
So in this matrix, I am just a cursor
God tight
The sky light
My life is in the games highlight
Gettin high ever night to fight my plight
Now my mic got me livin in the high life
So fuck you rappers and ya bikes and ya chains
This is my way sadness that can brighten ya day
[Hook]
God gave me style
God gave me grace (God give my style God give me grace)
God put a smile on my face (God put a smile on my face)
God make me shine like the sun (God make me shine like the sun)
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
Yep I'm pretty sure

[Verse 2]
I make mixtapes to talk about the right now
I make albums to talk about my lifestyle
I make music to pump my heart
A perfect 10, November is the month I start
WHOA
Is me
This beat
Gets me to the state of mind where I can live free
9th grade insecure couldn't get numbers
Spent time between writin, beats, and pichunter
This summer I'm Charlie DiCaprio
Hardly happy but I ain't walkin sadly tho
I am so at peace, I'd call my daddy, yo
If he even existed to me
Dead or alive no difference to me
Either way his soul is distant to me
I ain't grow to be what mom wants me to be
So what my nigga, Psalm 23
[Hook]
God gave me style
God gave me grace (God give my style God give me grace)
God put a smile on my face (God put a smile on my face)
God make me shine like the sun (God make me shine like the sun)

Yep I'm pretty sure

It ain't my fault!
I just reached the style I'm hot I break it down
It ain't my fault!
You can't break it down the way I break it down

Meet Eddie, 23 years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going
(Damn, I'm going fucking insane)
He decides to rob a liquor store
(I gotta take this shit, I can't take it no more, holmes)
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
(Shit is mine)
And suddenly (I gotta do this)
His conscience comes into play (I gotta do this)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre, Eminem, & (Eddie)]
Alright, stop (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (Who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience
That's nonsense
Go in, gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
(Can I borrow this?)
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right)
Not over this shit (Stop)
Drop the biscuit (I will)
Don't even listen to Slim, yo, he's bad for you
You know what, Dre? I don't like your attitude

Come on, just come in here for a minute
I don't know
Look, look, look

Look, it's gonna be alright, alright?
O-okay
Look, give me a kiss, pull your pants off, come on

Meet Stan, 21 years old
After meeting a young girl at a rave party
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Once again, his conscience comes into play

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now, listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair? (Uh-huh)
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?
No, but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest
Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dog, then bail

Here I lay
(Man, it feels good to be home)
Meet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker
After coming home from a hard day's work
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man
(What the fuck?) Grady

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Alright, calm down, relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work, she's with some dude tryna get off
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitch's head off
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?
Tsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
What you say?
What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
I'ma kill you, motherfucker
Uh-uh, temper, temper
Mr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A, Mr. AK
Comin' straight outta Compton, y'all better make way
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that
Aw, fuck it, what am I sayin'?

I could have snapped, took it past rap and hurt you
But I didn't, I kept it on wax and served you
I square dance 'cause I'm sick of rapping circles
Around these clowns, steady trying to call me out

Drugs, rock and Hennessy, thug like I'm Pac, on my enemies
On your knees, got you under siege
Somebody you would give a lung to be
Hun-ga-ry like a fuckin' younger me
Fuck the fee, I can get you jumped for free
Yeah, buddy, laugh! It's funny, I have the money
To have you killed by somebody who has nothin'
I'm past bluffin', pass the K-Y
Let's get ready for some intense serious ass-fucking!
[Chorus: Eminem]
Come on now! Let's all get on down!
Do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hair down and square dance with me!
Come on now! Let's all get on down!
Do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time

Kilo,Fat Joe,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","[Chorus: sample]
All around the world today, the kilo is a measure
A kilo is a thousand grams, easy to remember
A kilo is a thousand, pretend you remember
When we measure kilograms, we say weight is common usage

[Intro: Pusha T - over Chorus]
Yo Joe, what up?
It's ya neighbourhood Pusha
See my man, my man May May locked up for like 25 years
He in the Feds right now, right
He said he locked up with this old Spanish man
And they was sitting down watching TV
And you popped up on the screen
The man said, ""hey, what's Joey doing on TV?""
He didn't even know you rap, haha

[Verse 1: Pusha T & No Malice]
K-I-L-O, the king saying hello
From my Sugar Hill Ray Nathan he's Romello
I plays it like a cello, I pull them strings
To make them scales teeter totter like balance beams
It's everything it seems, the guns and the glamour
The re-compressed birds broked down with sledgehammers
Smile candid camera, goddess in zoom lenses
Unclaimed taxes, sitting in new Benzes
Champagne drenches, the loafers of bosses
Lord forgive me, it's blood diamonds in these crosses
Suffered major losses to repeat the past
Guess I never learned a hard head makes a soft ass
Ugh, and soft white makes for hard cash
And Continental GT's with the soft rag
Like soft batch, cookies out the oven
Getting 13 at a time, now that's a baker's dozen
[Chorus: sample]
All around the world today, the kilo is a measure
A kilo is a thousand grams, easy to remember
A kilo is a thousand, pretend you remember
When we measure kilograms, we say weight is common usage

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
It's Coca baby
Krills mania, BX, TS nigga!
Ayo, it's blood on the cocaine, a scene out of Psycho
Dope so pure, fiends cling to the light pole
Wet purer than holy water, your wife know
And she ain't gotta fly to Columbia for that lipo... (Darkside)
Cut keys like a locksmith
Blasphemy, but it feels like it's God's gift
One sniff'll have you kneel down and praise me
Nodding out, holding onto your babies
A new connect means a few more dreams
Now watch a nigga flood the streets like New Orleans (get it?)
Blow like trumpets, snorting on the second line
Fucking with that white bitch'll have you on the borderline
Penthouse in the city got the scenic view
And maybe you can fuck Madonna like you Peter Shue
Snowcaps dripping off rock mountains
Crack in Wonderland got coke dripping out the fountains
[Chorus: sample]
All around the world today, the kilo is a measure
A kilo is a thousand grams, easy to remember
A kilo is a thousand, pretend you remember
When we measure kilograms, we say weight is common usage

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Okay baby, got you Crack, Killa!
I said a kilo is a thousand grams, but can you remember?
Check my agenda, snow like December
Coke, I'm a emperor, go head and taste it numb up your dentures
Moving in renters, probably a sentra
No I won't serve you, don't mean to offend ya, 'fend ya
Roundtable, glass up, all hail us
Toast the life, one they told me will fail us
We prevail from the corner, now (?)
Still got wet, they on water like a sailor
Me and Cook Coke (Cook Coke), cook coke (cook coke)
No fracture, but damn you look broke
Know my pedigree ready is what you better be
(Better be) put two holes in yo' ass like the letter B
My parameter homie is where you need to be
Gambler? Nah, Janitor, I keep the keys... Killa!

Come on, to my thick chicks down in Texas
All the way to New Orleans where the girls cook catfish
And in L.A., every chick's an actress
Hollywood status with the shaded glasses
To Detroit, yeah the place that I rest
Where the ladies got ass and symbolize sex
And hot Atlanta, y'all is one of the best
Where they speak Southern slang and smoke la cess
And New York, women are way too fresh
Too much on your mind, let me ease that stress
I wish you all were mine, it's so selfish
Maybe I'm feeling myself too much, I guess
But, to my ladies all across the globe
In small towns that I don't even know
To all local international codes
Whether you see me in streets or catch me at shows
I'm calling

And steal the spotlight like Mr. Bentley
I spotted her like Spud McKenzie
And for them fake boobies, I paid them Benjis
Get your own
I got Paris, he got Nicky, he tried to get 'em a clone
He said, ""Ye, you know you got extra hoes
And everything you do is extra cold""
From the Polo fleece to the Jesus piece
I got family in high places like Jesus' niece
Can I please, say my peace?
If y'all fresh to death, then I'm deceased
And this one here is a heatrocks, spit like a beat box
The way the beat rocks, new version of Pete Rock
But for that Benz, I get CL love
So I switch my girls around like 3L-dub, I'm calling

What up, Pam? How your little man doing in New Jersey?
Last I heard he caught the flu and you was worried
Hope he feels better, and thanks Jonetta from Cleveland
For that good head in your Jetta, better believe it
Shanice, you're my piece from Compton, before I'm off the plane
Make sure you cop some trees to spark up
Danielle, ATL, got them pictures in the mail
You sealed with a kiss and you sent it with Chanel
You looking good in that one showing off your body
Had a Beverly Hills mami that would buy me Cartis
Take me to afterparties, her name was Khari
And it sucks that we didn't keep in touch, I'm sorry
But, hey Kim, how's Minneapolis?
You so pretty, hate you show off your titties for silly classes
Cause I love you girls, though you ain't mine
I wish my arms was long enough to hug you all of the same time

Flash that buttery gold
Jittery zeitgeist, wither by the watering hole, what a patrol
What are we to Heart Huckabee, art fuckery suddenly
Not enough young in his lung for the water wings
Colorfully vulgar poacher, out of mulch
Like, ""I'ma pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt""
Fine, sign of the time we elapse
When a primate climb up a spine and attach
Eye for an eye, by the bog life swamps and vines
They get a rise out of frogs and flies
So when a dogfight's hog-tied prize sort of costs a life
The mouths water on a fork and knife
And the allure isn't right
No score on a war-torn beach
Where the cash cow's actually beef
Blood turns wine when it leak for police
Like, ""That's not a riot; it's a feast, let's eat!""
[Chorus]
And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, ""None shall pass""
None shall pass, none shall pass

[Verse 2]
Now, if you never had a day a snow cone couldn't fix
You wouldn't relate to the rogue vocoder blitz
How he spoke through a NoDoz motor on the fritz
‘Cause he wouldn't play rollover fetch like a bitch
And express no regrets, though he isn't worth a homeowner's piss
To the jokers who pose by the glitz
Fine, sign of the swine in the swarm
When a king is a whore who comply and conform
Miles outside of the eye of the storm
With a siphon to lure out a prize and award
While avoiding the vile and bizarre that is violence and war
True blue triumph is more
Like, ""Wait, let it snake up out of the centerfold
Let it break the walls of Jericho, ready go""
Sat where the old, cardboard city folk
Swap tales with heads, like every other penny throw

[Chorus]
And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, ""None shall pass""
None shall pass, none shall pass

You tried, you tried, you tried to trick me
You've got a, you've, you've got a, a lot of nerve
I'm, I'm not, I'm not, trying to trick you
I'm try, I'm try, I'm trying to help

[Verse 3]
Okay, woke to a grocery list, goes like this:
Duty and Death
Anyone object, come stand in the way
You could be my little Snake River Canyon today
And I ran with a chain of commands
And a jetpack strapped where the backstab lands if it can
Fine, sign of the vibe in the crowd
When I cut a belly open to find what climb out
That's quite a bit of gusto he muster up
To make a dark horse rush, like, ""Enough's enough!""
It must've struck a nerve so they huff and puff
'Til all the king's men fluster and clusterfuck
And it's a beautiful thing
To my people who keep an impressive wingspan
Even when the cubicle shrink
You got to pull up the intruder by the root of the weed
N.Y. Chew through the machine

[Chorus]
And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, ""None shall pass""
None shall pass, none shall pass"

I'm a gorilla
I spit till the void fill up
Cause honestly I feel the radio is staright filler
If North is up and South is down
Why every five minutes niggas walking out
That's not a jab at UNK but I don't think the PD's are reasoning with us
Cause they don't think, no
They just wanna dance
And she don't want to learn
She gon' shake that little ass while they rain with that cash
If I don't make that man there dance
That man there throw Wale on the shelf and I lose
I'm not moving like a cartoon
Or a harpoon to Tom Cruise with a jock tune
For every Black Thought, I thought I caught Roots
It don't feel right, so what I'm gonna do
It's lopsided like a AA college student trying to undertake a D1 scholar
They need work, the freaks here makes their knees work
Yep she's on X, I called that bitch speed burst
I plead with em, the system ain't right
Like the first Nintendo, the blinking red light
So my thought process is all but a cartlidge
When I'm blown I can work proper
Yeah listen up, I ain't here kissing up
Every single single ain't a single just to hit the clubs
I am not involved, nor do I indulge in the hardest thing of poor artistry
I rock awesomley, the offspring of the flawless brings game
I'm autumn leaves change
Photosyntheis, notice what the focus is
I move the club like a poker dealer
And most feel me like masseuse
Lyrical kama sutra
But radio ain't trying to follow suit
So what you've heard is the fix like super
Intendent attend them, cool cause
It's cool cause the radio don't do much
I lead the city in requests, but don't do nothing

So keep fronting till my peeps come

Back when I said you should catch me like Rawlings

Ball for a few then end up walking
Catch me in the ball with a Cinderella waltzing

Not to give you all of my time that you wanted
You can give me some head, but keep the breakfast in bed
I'd rather spend my morning diggin' through some records instead
But tonight, I guess it'd be aight if we can touch bases

Baby was a virgin, that's what she said
So I gave her some Hennessy, she gave me some head
I fucked her on the floor so I wouldn't mess up my bed
Then Lil' ½ Dead put his dick on her head
Take that bitch home and give her a bone
And give her the number to my cellular phone
Now she's blowin' up my pager, the shit's gettin' major
A favor for a favor, this dick is what I gave her
Somethin' to go by and bitches know why
Stuff dick in they mouth and then I'm out (See ya!)
24/7, Dre, Snoop and Devin
We servin' these hoes and never lovin' these hoes, biatch

[Chorus: Devin the Dude]
I just wanna fuck you
No touchin' and rubbin', girl
You've got a husband who loves you
Don't need you all in mine
I just wanna fuck you
We can't be kissin' and huggin', girl
You've got a husband who loves you
You need to give him your quality time"

9 to 5 minimum wage? What type of life is that?
For me? It's blasphemy, you fuckin' around

Strangle your neck, slap you like the opposite sex

Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar
Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar

This is one's for all my brothers and sisters who died in Iraq, Israel, Afghanistan and right here in America
(Jesus Walks)

Abraham Taught
Muhammad Taught
And Moses split the sea
(Jesus Walk with me)
I ain't tryin' to profit off the prophets so this one's for free

[Verse 1]
G's up along with Muhammad and Jesus
In the Quran they call him Isa
Don't think Osama and Saddam is our leader
We pray for peace, but the drama intrigues us
All, so we fall for the illusions of the beast
So instead of tryin' to teach we show our teeth
Same God, different beliefs
Hijabs, Sunday clothes, yarmulke, kufi, same mission beneath
We all tryin' to get to where the sufferin' ends
In front of the Most High bein' judged for our sins
Can't front for the Most High, so the struggle
Continues
You, every bee, bird and tree, he, her and me
We virtually on the same boat
With the same goats, on the same sea
Tryin' to stay afloat, and put the devil in the yoke
With a couple of God's quotes
[Hook]
Ash-had an la ilaha illa llah
(Astaghfirullah)

[Verse 2]
And to the sisters and the mothers of ours
Who cover theyselves cause they're lovers of God
The Creator of the worlds, Sculptor of the stars
During Hajj, we walk, through Ramadaan, we starve
Though you not eatin', there's a feedin' of the mind
A defeatin' of the demons, a seein' of the signs
A leanin' on the lines from the surahs
Getting purer, God deemed it unclean
(There's no eatin' of the swine)
Nor drinkin' of the wine
We all bend to his whims, so I send out a message to my kind
I’m cordial to Mr. Norful, Mrs. Adams you’re the theme song when I’m battling
Creflo, player, what’s happening? I can hear the truth in your rappings
(No)
Sex before you marry
No grudges
You should carry, no lyin'
Not supposed to be gamblin'

We all the same man
It's all a game
The devil hate each and every one of us exactly the same

[Verse 3]
You know
(uh)
And to my Akh's tryin to stay on their deen
It gets mean especially when you stay on the scene
And at the same try to stay out of trouble
But don't forget the blessin' is in the struggle
The Most Forgiving will forgive it if you stay repentant
And hustle
You gotta stay on your salats, your zakats, your Quran
To my homies and miskeen
Astagfirullah
Allah forgive us all
For we all are sinners
Bless us to be among the winners
When it ends
But until then please strengthen the mission within our hearts
All praise is due to God
(Amen)
Tellin' it how it was taught me
I ain't tryin' to sell it can be brought for free
This is how it is
Now how it ought to be

Jesus walk with me

That's just the way it goes
Rock bottom watching my inspiration fold
Thrown in the game, no warm-up but I ain't cold
Transition from ice cold to luke warm
Wanna feel my story homie come and put my shoes on
Yeah, Cause since the beginning people be hatin'
When I see 'em I'm just grinnin'

Grew up in the city blowin' Ls while we winnin'
You know I'm going just had as hard in the ninth inning
As the first thanks Boston for Raisin' me

Unless it's Ari Gold

Head up in the clouds, sophisticated stance
While my body's in the office, supplyin' their demands
And every hour in the booth that I'm getting paid for
Wonder why it's dark outside, and where today go
Cuz' it's easy to get your name known

Being underrated gave me time to create

Carried my weight, but seem to receive nothin' but hate

Kidnapped, locked in a trunk and shot in the face
No hoes, no clothes, no one showin' up for my shows
You know how it goes, I might as well kick it at home
But my baby mama hate my guts and can't stand me
Packed up, moved out, started a new family
So all this strugglin' for what, so I can blow up?
Marry a slut but can't watch my seed grow up?
Fuck that! This the fuckin' thanks I get
For tryin' to edutain assholes and feed my bitch?
Yo, I feel like my whole life is upside down

It's like, every day I wake up, another drama
It's a wonder I'm alive survivin' this karma
If I can hold on to my private life for five minutes longer
I might get my wife to let go of this knife and just calm her
Without these cameras in our faces like animals
For your Channel 2 Action News to follow our ambulance up the avenue
And catch a glimpse of all the suicide attempts
And what we do in private since they won't let us put up a fence
And you wonder why I carry every gun under the Sun
Whether it's unloaded, full or an unregistered one
No bullets? You're so full of shit
This clip is so full, it'll spit if I don't pull it
And don't give me no bullshit, I'm not in the mood

Yo, Em, it's time to get serious with it
Time for everybody to feel it, similar to the egg in the skillet
This is your brain on drugs, Xzibit rain on thugs
Ain't no neighborhood that's big enough to bang on us
Ain't no love lost, my niggas, relax yourself
I'm about to snatch it all and start spreadin' the wealth
To my niggas who never seen it, I mean it when I holla
At the top of my lungs about my guns and my loved ones
Got tons of ammo to crack your enamel
Changin' your channel, you played like a fuckin' piano
Ridin' slow through Cali like I'm ridin' a camel
Millionaire motherfuckers with their brains in their flannels
I feel like Tony Soprano: who do I trust now?
Just hit me on my tele', nigga, soon as I touch down
Spit lines to split spines, just to get mine
Big behind bitches gettin' dick to spit shine
Sniff lines of coke – that's the only shit that make you dope
Bitch-ass nigga that's droppin' the soap
Get choked out and beat, put your head in a vise-grip
And turn 'til you motherfuckers tell me the right shit
[Verse 4: Eminem]
So do I gotta buy a whole block to myself, a front door with 12 locks
And have a bodyguard walk me out to my mailbox
And every time somebody makes a threat, run and tell cops?
Fuck that! I protect myself with these 12 shots
And one in the chamber, gun in the waist
And one in the ankle, waitin' for someone to come to my place
Tryna walk up and knock, like these cocksuckers are not
Gonna get a shotgun or a Glock shoved in their face
And it's a disgrace Hailie can't play with her toys
In the front yard without you drivin' by honkin' your horn
Screamin' some shit, leanin' out your windows, beepin' and shit
Or pullin' up in my drive like I won't leap in your whip
And so these kids tell their friends and relatives where I live
So my address ends up on the Internet again
So then, I do an interview with Spin, tellin' them
That if someone comes to my crib, I'ma shove a gun in their ribs
And reporters blow it out of proportion
Oh, now he's pullin' guns on his fans, just for tryna stand on his porch
And I'm the bad guy, ‘cause I don't answer my door, like, ""Hey! Hi! You guys wants some autographs? Okay, form a straight line!""
Sometimes I feel like loadin' this rifle
And climbin' the roof at night and hidin' outside to snipe you
It's not that I don't like you
It's just that when I'm not behind the mic, I'm a person who's just like you"

Welcome back to the stage of history
Yo, Slim Shady!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo, I'll fuckin'... (Alright), I'll...
I'll puke, eat it, and freak you (Ew)
Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to
The only key that I see to defeat you
Would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
And force feed you 'em both
And on each feet is a cleat shoe (Agh!)
I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse
You'll think I pulled the fucking ground out from underneath you
(Bitch!) I ain't no fucking G, I'm a cannibal
I ain't tryin' to shoot you
I'm tryin' to chop you into pieces and eat you
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass
And have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin' mattress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers
Fuck the planet 'til it spins on a broken axis
I'm so bananas I'm showing up to your open casket
To fill it full of explosive gases and close it back
With a lit match in it while I sit back and just hope it catches
Blow you to fragments, laugh, roll you, and smoke the ashes
[Chorus: J-Black]
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step it gets dim
Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in?
If so, Heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step it gets dim
Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in?
If so, Heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down

[Verse 2: J-Black]
Am I the worst because I never go to church? (Never)
I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
I'ma drink till my liver rot, see the doc leave the E.R
Then hit a bar for a liquor shot; fuck the liver spot!
One day we all gon' die
But when I die, I'ma be so high
That I'ma get up and walk, leaving the concrete bare
With the chalk outline still there
I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot
I got a cross on my chain, but it's just to rock
Now if I pray every night (Night)
Do I still have to hold my tray very tight?
You feel me, God? I done did so much shit while on Earth
I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse
I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse
Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk
See me at the pearly gates in line, wearing a North Face
Nickle 9 at my waist, God done lost faith
Angels greet me, but I don't reply back
Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at?
[Chorus: J-Black]
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step it gets dim
Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in?
If so, Heaven's got to be better

Maxi was seriously wounded
But the soul still burns
Final battle, fight!

[Verse 3: Masta Ace]
Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso
Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso
And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger
Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her
Ten blocks, untie the bitch, and I still bag her
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
My flows spill, like using the wrong end of a funnel
Everyday I grow more older and more colder
Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a boulder
I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare
‘Cause you're fuckin' with some niggas like this who just don't care
[Chorus: J-Black]
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step it gets dim
Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in?
If so, Heaven's got to be better

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Left the keys in the van with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan if a citizen bystands
The shit is in my hands, here's your lifespan
And for what your life's worth, this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland
See, I'm a nice man, but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin'
Hurry up with the cash, bitch, I got a ride waitin'
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin'
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied Nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin', clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
Or gets your description and sketches ya
Then connects you as the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
'Cause I got a daughter to feed
And two hundred dollars ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell
And hit up Chess King and have the lady at the desk bring
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin' a MAC
Co-operate and we can operate and save an attack
This bitch tried escapin' the jack
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nothin' for her to be smoked
Then I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin', ""Freeze!""
But I'm already wanted for sellin' keys
And a bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin' bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit me square in the chest, wasn't wearin' a vest

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Left the house, pullin' out the drive, backin' out
Blew the back end out this lady's Jag, started blackin' out
Pulled the MAC-10 out
Stuck it in her face: ""Shut your yackin' mouth
'Fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp!""
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Figured, ""Fuck it—mug her while you're there,"" jacked her up
Stole her car and made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and loft it
Out the window like the girl in Set It Off did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin' pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive, but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin', ""Johnny, go in and call the police!
Tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!""
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin' like they never seen nobody hit a lick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores, the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles
And collided with an eighty-year-old lady with groceries
There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, musta been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I musta dropped a Beanie Baby
Fuck it, I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin', ""truce-truce!""(Don't shoot!)
And surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me, it was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps

Her  It,John Berryman,['country'],"I fell in love with a girl
O and a gash
I'll bet she now has seven lousy children
(I've three myself, one being off the record.)

I wish she'd read my book & write to me
From O wherever ah how far she is
After all, I get letters from anybody
From hers, I'd tear to the 'phone

It's not now near at all the end of winter
I have to fly off East to sing a poem
Admirers, some, will surge up afterward
I'll keep an eye out for her

My tough Songs well in Tokyo & Paris
Fall under scrutiny. My publishers
Very friendly in New York & London
Forward me elephant cheques

Time magazine yesterday slavered Saul's ass
They pecked at mine last year. We're going strong!
Photographs all over!
She muttered something in my ear I've forgotten as we danced"

Blasphemy,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'alternative', 'jazz', 'blues']","[Intro: This Week In Bible Prophecy]
God has a plan, and the bible unfolds that wonderful plan
Through the message of prophecy
God sent Jesus into this world to be our savior
And that Christ is returning, someday soon
To unfold the wonderful plan of eternity
For my life and your life
As long as we're cooperating with God
By accepting Jesus Christ as our personal Lord and savior
Unless the Lord does return in the coming seven days
We'll see you next time here on This Week in Bible Prophecy

[Intro: 2Pac]
2Pac, don't start that blasphemy in here!
Makaveli, the new breed
And I remember what my pops told me
The new word, follow me
Remember what my pops told me

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
My family tree consists of drug dealers, thugs and killers
Strugglin', known to hustle, screamin', ""fuck they feelings!""
I got advice from my father, all he told me was this:
""Nigga, get off your ass if you plan to be rich!
There's ten rules to the game, but I'll share with you two
Know niggas gon' hate you for whatever you do
Now, rule one: get your cash on, M.O.B.
That's Money Over Bitches, 'cause they breed envy
Now, rule two is a hard one: watch for phonies
Keep your enemies close, nigga, watch your homies""
It seemed a little unimportant, when he told me, I smiled
Picture jewels bein' handed to an innocent child
I never knew, in my lifetime, I'd live by these rules
Initiated as an outlaw, studyin' rules
Now, papa ain't around, so I gotta recall
Or come to grips with bein' written on my enemy's walls
Promised if I have a seed, I'ma guide him right
Dear Lord, don't let me die tonight
I got words for my comrades, listen and learn
Ain't nothin' free, get back what you earned
No doubt, gettin' higher than a motherfucka, bless me, please
This Thug Life'll be the death of me

We pro'ly in Hell, already, our dumb asses not knowin'
Everybody kissin' ass to go to Heaven ain't goin'
Put my soul on it, I'm fightin' devil niggas daily
Plus the media be crucifyin' brothers severely
Tell me I ain't God's son; nigga, momma a virgin
We got evicted, had to leave the 'burbs
Back in the ghetto, doin' wild shit
Lookin' at the sun don't pay
Criminal mind all the time, wait for Judgment Day
They say Moses split the Red Sea
I split the blunt and rolled a fat one up, deadly
Babylon beware, comin' for the Pharoah's kids
Retaliation, makin' legends off the shit we did
Still bullshittin', niggas in Jerusalem waitin' for signs
God comin', she's just takin' her time (haha!)
Livin' by the Nile, while the water flow
I’m contemplatin' plots, wonderin' where the thought’ll go

The preacher want me buried, why? 'Cause I know he a liar
Have you ever seen a crackhead? That's eternal fire
Why you got these kids' minds thinkin' that they evil?
While the preacher bein' freaky, you say, ""honor God's people""
Should we cry when the Pope die? My request:
We should cry if they cried when we buried Malcolm X
Mama, tell me: am I wrong? Is God just another cop
Waitin' to beat my ass if I don't go pop?
Memories of a past time, givin' up cash to the leaders
Knowin' damn well they ain't gonna feed us
In my brain, how can you explain time in B.C.?
It's hard enough to live, now, in these times of greed
They say Jesus is a kind man
Well, he should understand times in this crime land
My thug nation, do what you gotta do
But know you gotta change
Try to find a way to make it out the game
I leave this and hope God can see my heart is pure
Is Heaven just another door? I leave this here
I leave this and hope God see my heart is pure
Is Heaven just another door? And my people say

Nuff a dem a steal in the name of the lord

That if you fuck with Dre, nigga, you're fuckin' wit Death Row
And I ain't even swangin' them thangs
I'm hollerin' 187 with my dick in your mouth, biatch
[Interlude: RBX]
Yeah, nigga, Compton and Long Beach together on this motherfucker
So you wanna pop that shit, get your motherfuckin' cranium cracked, nigga, step on up
Now, we ain't no motherfuckin' joke, so remember the name
Mighty, mighty D-R
Yeah, motherfucker (The shit done hit the fan)

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
Now understand this, my nigga Dre can't be touched
Luke's bending over so Luke's getting fucked, buster
Must've thought I was sleazy
Or thought I was a mark 'cause I used to hang with Eazy
Animosity made you speak what you spoke (Yeah)
Ayo, Dre (What up?) Chip this nigga off, loc
If it ain't another ho that I gots to fuck with
Gap teeth in your mouth so my dick's gots to fit
With my nuts on your tonsils
While you're on stage rappin' at your wack-ass concert
And I'ma snatch your ass from the backside
And show you how Death Row pull off that who-ride
Now you might not understand me
'Cause I'ma rob you in Compton and blast you in Miami
Then we gonna creep to South Central
On a street knowledge mission as I steps in the temple
Spot him, got him, as I pulls out my strap
Got my chrome to the side of his White Sox hat
You tryna check my homie, you best check yourself
'Cause when you diss Dre you diss yourself, motherfucker (Yeah, nigga)
[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
So I don't want no dilapidated, two-faced, pigeon-toed, bow-legged, cross-eyed son of a gun fuckin' with me (Fuckin' with me)
Yeah, nine-deuce
Dr. Dre droppin' chronic once again
It don't stop
Punishin' punk motherfuckers real quick-like
Compton style, nigga
Doggy Dogg's in the motherfuckin' house
Yeah, Long Beach is in the motherfuckin' house
Yeah, yeah, straight up
Really, though
Breaking all them suckas off something real proper-like
You know what I'm sayin'?
All them sucka-ass niggas can eat a fat dick
Yeah, Eazy-E, Eazy-E, Eazy-E can eat a big fat dick
Tim Dog can eat a big fat dick
Luke can eat a fat dick
Yeah (Yeah)"
Its Been A Pleasure,Bun B,['hip hop'],"[Chorus: Drake]
Emotions in this game run deep
So before these haters kill me in my sleep
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
Reppin' 'til my last second through
Done a lot of shit they'll never get to do
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
Honored to be somebody they mention
But before these niggas stop payin' attention
I'll just say it's been a pleasure
You'll never be somebody they need

Tonight I'm gon' make some money go
For the H-Town

Set up the occasion
I’m up in the place and
If amazing was a young bitch
I'd be going to jail cause I'm fucking amazing
What's up for the taking
I’m ready and I'm willing, why the fuck are we waiting
Yeah, and baby you should bring your best friend
Then you should persuade her to let me get some sex in
Don't get offended, baby, that's just a suggestion
Really we can do it however..you..like
I’m probably in your hotel tonight
Whatever floor that me and 40 staying on is smelling riiight
Yeah, just know we grinding till it’s light out
Show up in your city, turn that motherfucker right out
Yeah, tell me who controls kings
I don’t follow rules, stupid old things
I’m riding through the city in the coupe with those wings
My team deserves some motherfucking Super Bowl rings
Oh yeah, and I know we gon' get it
Me and Jeezy bout whatever, shorty, holla if you with it
Even though I want it to this shit don’t last forever
But better late than never, honestly I’d like to say it's been a pleasure

6 in the morning, I’m gonna call Wale
Tell J. Cole meet us down in the A
And bring Wiz Khalifa cause the green look pure
We some real niggas
We just looking in the mirror

[Hook]
I'm on fire, whole hood blazing
Hustle game incredible, ice game amazing
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror
Look's like a chandelier, look in the mirror
Eyes super clear, you looking in the mirror
Who you heard see when you look in the mirror?
If you a real nigga, you looking in the mirror

[Verse 1 - Wale]
D.C. all up in this bitch
Bout time I got my respect
And now these hoes are on my line
Like Sally Mae on college debt
Gotti here, I’m in this shit
Here's your nigga, come hear this year
I bet you hear that white music
But I don’t mean Top 40 hits
Talk to the mirror
And I don’t need a cure
And when I’m done with this muthafucker
You’ll need an urn
Shopping I’ll be in Paris
Plottin' don’t even worry
You walk in my closet your favorite stylist will be emburrsed
You out where, we don't ever see ya
My niggas out here, they spot me like Chippy D
And I’m probably smoking reefer til I got that emphysema
How else can I emphasize I’ll only let the mirror see ya
[Yo Gotti]
It go microphone check, one, two, yola
Two chains, two guns, he bipolar
Two baby mamas, 3 kids, two Rovers
That's too many problems, too late to think over
The cars off the showroom, the clothes off the mannequin
Hoes out the centerfold, I be going in at em
One bitch from Howard, another bitch from Grambling
College girl going wild, we gonna need a camera man
Bird talk feather man, Louie jacket leatherman
Fresh to death that bullshit irrelevant
Man in the mirror, I can’t get my shot again
My bitch like a coke bottle, your bitch like a Pepsi can

[Hook]

[J. Cole]
Mirror mirror on the wall
Bitch, I was born to ball
While you took the summer off my money did a somersault
Backflips, cartwheels, Carolina Tar Heel
Ain't no nigga touching my style, it got a force field
Magneto, blew up like a torpedo
The view from my condo make hoes say ""neato!""
Game strong like the arm on Marino
I stack Cheetos and Doritos like casinos
Fresh to death like I’m buried in a tuxedo
At times I look in the mirror to boost my fucking ego
I say it’s your World, Cole World to be exact
With a flow that’s so thorough, no sir you can’t re-enact
[Wiz Khalifa]
150 on my chain
Balling, but it’s not a game
High: that's why they call us planes
All the bitches know my name
I take em home, fuck her, get high and never call again
And my niggas all the same
Now that's what you call a gang
Hundred thousand dollars and that’s on champagne
Bitches choosing their excuses: my new car’s to blame
Wanna dump a nigga, fuck a nigga with a lot of fame
Don’t want nothing from a nigga; he all kinds of lame
Try doing what you doing but it’s out of range
Niggas taking shots, don’t know how to aim
Don’t know bout you but I see a real nigga
When I’m looking in the mirror
With some diamonds in my ear muthafucker"

Aw, look at daddy's baby girl
That's daddy's baby, little sleepy head
Yesterday I changed your diaper
Wiped you and powdered you
How did you get so big?
Can't believe it, now you're two
Baby, you're so precious, daddy's so proud of you
Sit down, bitch! You move again, I'll beat the shit out of you! (Okay!)

[Verse 1: Eminem & Kim]
Don't make me wake this baby!
She don't need to see what I'm 'bout to do!
Quit crying, bitch! Why do you always make me shout at you?!
How could you just leave me and love him out the blue?!
Oh, what's the matter, Kim? Am I too loud for you?
Too bad, bitch! You're gonna finally hear me out this time!
At first I'm like, ""Aight, you wanna throw me out, that's fine!""
But not for him to take my place, are you out your mind?!
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine!
How could you let him sleep in our bed?! Look it, Kim!
Look at your husband now! (No!) I said look at him!
He ain't so hot now, is he?
Little punk!
(Why are you doing this?!) Shut the fuck up! (You're drunk!)
(You're never gonna get away with this!) You think I give a fuck?!
C'mon! We're going for a ride, bitch! (No!) Sit up front!
(We can't just leave Hailie alone, what if she wakes up?)
We'll be right back — well, I will, you'll be in the trunk

I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

[Verse 2: Eminem & Kim]
You really fucked me, Kim, you really did a number on me!
Never knew me cheating on you would come back to haunt me
But we was kids then, Kim, I was only eighteen
That was years ago, I thought we wiped the slate clean
That's fucked up! (I love you!) Oh God, my brain is racin'
(I love you!) What are you doing? Change the station!
I hate this song! Does this look like a big joke? (No!)
There's a [four]-year-old little [boy]
Laying dead with a slit throat in your living room!
Ha-ha! What, you think I'm kiddin' you?!
You loved him, didn't you? (No!)
Bullshit, you bitch! Don't fucking lie to me!
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
Fuck you, asshole! Yeah, bite me!
Kim? Kim! Why don't you like me?
You think I'm ugly, don'tchu? (It's not that!) No, you think I'm ugly
(Baby!) Get the fuck away from me! Don't touch me!

Fuck you!
You did this to us! You did it! It's your fault!
""Oh my God, I'm crackin' up"" Get a grip, Marshall!
Hey, remember the time we went to Brian's party
And you were, like, so drunk that you threw up all over Archie?
That was funny, wasn't it? (Yes)
That was funny, wasn't it?! (Yes!)
See, it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight, one of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced (No!)
And while this is going on, his son just woke up
And he walks in, she panics, and he gets his throat cut
(Oh my God!)  So now they both dead
And you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I shoulda known better when you started to act weird
We coulda— hey, where you going? Get back here!
You can't run from me, Kim! It's just us, nobody else
You're only making this harder on yourself!
Ha-ha, gotcha! Go ahead, yell!
Here, I'll scream with you, ""Ah! Somebody help!""
Don't you get it, bitch? No one can hear you!
Now shut the fuck up, and get what's comin' to you!
You were supposed to love me!
Now bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed!

Real Niggaz Dont Die,N.W.A,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'alternative', 'jazz', 'blues', 'rock']","[Intro]
Die nigga! We are born to die nigga
You've been dyin for 400 years
Niggas know how to die
Niggas don't know nothin else, but dying
Niggas dream about dying

I'm a motherfuckin nigga  (with an attitude)
I'm a motherfuckin nigga  (with an attitude)
I'm a motherfuckin nigga  (with an attitude)
I'm a motherfuckin nigga  (with an attitude)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I got a case, of spittin in a motherfucker's face
So me and my ace, we got a taste
Of a motherfucker's billy club, he took his gun and
Put it to my head and said, ""Nigga start runnin""
So tell me what's the next episode?
Is he crazy, does he want to chase me or waste me?
I thought, ""Run nigga run"", but I caught myself
Because my secondary thought was death
I've got head and heart real, but still a motherfucker said
""I want another black motherfucker dead
Niggas ain't good for shit to me""
Cause it's a race for second class, so get your ass
Up against the wall bitch, and then he tried
To jump me but the punk became a victim of a walkby
Fuckin with Dre, you get a foot up in your asshole
It's just another way to let you know
Nigga send them, nigga send them, nigga send them
Punk can't fuck with me - Real motherfucking G
Straight from the streets of the CPT
Telling you why, real niggas don't die
[Hook]
""I-iiiiiii, just want to celebrate!""

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Real niggas don't die cause they eventually multiply
The niggas I'm with, they take an eye for an eye
Because the times are so wrong, gotta stay so strong
Niggas gotta keep it goin on and on
And don't let no paleface throw your ass in a snail race
Have your residence occupyin a jail space
That's what they want to do cause the system is fucked around
I try to let you know with the records that's underground
They don't give a fuck about a nigga, they would rather pull the trigger
And have you in front of a barrel smilin sayin ""Cheese!""
So nigga get smart and rebel back
I'm not with that black shit so I'm not gonna yell that
All I see is niggas getting harassed
And can't do nothin about it but get a foot in they ass, yo
But if every nigga grabbed a nine
And started shootin motherfuckers it would put 'em in line
And that's how it's supposed to be
When a pussy-ass nigga try to fuck with me
Yo, because it's useless to try
To kill a nigga cause nigga a motherfuckin real nigga don't die!

""I-iiiiiii, just want to celebrate!""

Die nigga, everywhere you go
Niggas dying, niggas been dyin for 400 years

Only the good die young, so that makes me young and bad
Puttin ass-kickings on the niggas that never had
So I guess that makes me tough shit
Straight up gangsta, wrong nigga to fuck with
So how can a nigga die, when he's causin the bloodshed
By shoot motherfuckers in the head
Tryin to make a nigga extinct because they fear me
But never wanna hear me
So I'mma let 'em know how a nigga's livin
Takin from motherfuckers cause nobody ain't givin
A damn thang! To a nigga, a real nigga
So I'm living by the motherfuckin trigger

Spinning Tops,Lucid Dreams,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","
Red dot's on the mic still
And I won't kill no one, but the mic will
Claim you quite ill, my tight skills are more sick
I keep seeing dead rappers, my dreams are all morbid
Y'all some winners right? What you awarded
Shit even the Oscars gave a prize out to Norbit
First time I drove I had to try not to floor it
Cause I go into fifth gear every time I'm recording
And when I write too, mic might snipe you
Eat beats like Dwight Schrute, inflame the mic booth
Is it really that hard for y'all to write truth?
But y'all get capped like you lacking a nice tooth
And if a beat's dead, well then I re-maim
Riding with two pistols, no T-Pain
One keeps the dope lines safe, so I ain't phased
The other one got me insane on any stage
And I grow with age, my mindstate is fuck the hate
But I won't say more on it, -- just in case
Entourage pimpin', I'm the one they chase
Y'all some treble rappers, I bring the fucking bass
I freestyle for 13 minutes and kill songs
My mind's so crooked, I've got my tilt-on
Team's a gang of stars, respect is what we built on
Man you ain't on my level, go and get yo' stilts on
I've took a few shots, but homie I'm still strong
You rappers act like chicks, must got kilts on
Pick a beat, what track you wan' get killed on?
And the style's so cleaann, all of that filth gone
I'm like a pill mixed with an ill dose of crystal meth
Words can rip your flesh, thoughts as sick as death
And when I record it's like I spit a cigarette
Cause when my mic is up, then I light it up
No Drake though, and no fake flows in my rhymes
Fly words for city lights, I write skylines
You see a hot chick, then that dime's mine
So fuck what you heard, baby, I'm fine
Haters all look like crabs in a bucket
I drop a new album for the bastards, fuck it
Ask me what I think about rapping, I love it
But a more passionate subject's getting cash in abundance
And every rap track seems to sound the same
I'm running through the names and they all sound like lames
I'm fanning up on these flames, taking over the game
I'm a genius AND insane, both pinky AND the brain
And I keep more ho's than Santa claims
Got girls of all flavor, like the Fanta dames
Flashy clothes and they dope, call 'em manne-caines
And I keep 'em on display, so they can't complain
And all that peace talk is beyond me
Claim that on a track and you end up like Gandhi
You so wavy? I'm a tsunami
And when I perform all I hear is Bravo, no Johnny
Let the drummer play
I'm on the Kanye shit, if you ain't got this much ""Power"" you should ""Runaway""
I won't even talk about Cassius fucking Clay
But I'm Muhammad Ali, who I gotta punch today?
My bars are hotter than a California summer day
How many times y'all threaten 'fore your gun'll spray?
Success is coming soon, the one thing I love to say
If it ain't right now, it's just another day
And BOSTON is my back setting
So I throw my 3s up like the half's ending
And all of you haters can come find me
And watch me snap like Tom Brady's behind me
That's why 1-2's the mic check
I flip words like my phone when I write texts
Double meanings, just watch as he kills it
My bars always sunny, I got Paddy Pub lyrics
And the redlight is the sunshine
And my heart beat is the drumline
And please note that I'm avoiding the punchline
Jealous dudes who don't even nod at me in lunchlines
You taking breaks like kit-Kats but it's crunch time
And my bars are so tight it's hard for me to unwind
And as I ramble and take all these gambles
The world turns to shambles but I remain like a candle
Now did you listen? learn your lesson
It's lucid dreams no connection to inception
...but my tops still spinning
And my mind keeps buzzing, this is just the beginning"

(Now here's a little something that needs to be heard)

[Intro]
Uncle Ricky, could you read us a bedtime story?
Please, huh, please?
All right, you kids get to bed, I'll get the storybook
Y'all tucked in? Yeah
Here we go

[Verse]
Once upon a time not long ago
When people wore pajamas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood
And people were behavin' like they ought to good
There lived a little boy who was misled
By another little boy and this is what he said
""Me and you, tonight we're gonna make some cash
Robbin' old folks and makin' the dash""
They did the job, money came with ease
But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another and another and a sister and her brother
Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover
The cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic
He said, ""Keep still, boy, no need for static""
Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap
But little did he know the little boy was strapped
The kid pulled out a gun, he said, ""Why'd you hit me?""
The barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure
""I'll do years if I pull this trigger""
So he cold dashed and ran around the block
Cop radios in to another lady cop
He ran by a tree, there he saw this sister
Shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her
Looked 'round good and from expectations
So he decided he'd head for the subway stations
But she was coming and he made a left
He was runnin' top speed 'til he was outta breath
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him (Sorry)
Then he made his move to an abandoned building
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor
Opened up the door there, guess who he saw? (Who?)
Dave, the dope fiend shootin' dope
Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap
He said, ""I need bullets, hurry up, run""
The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun
He went outside but there was cops all over
Then he dipped into a car, a stolen Nova
Raced up the block doing eighty-three
Crashed into a tree near university
Escaped alive though the car was battered
Rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered
Ran out of bullets and he still had static
Grabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic
Pointed at her head, he said the gun was full of lead
He told the cops, ""Back off or honey here is dead""
Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
So he let the lady go and he starts to run on (Uh-huh)
Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded
And before long the little boy got surrounded
He dropped his gun, so went the glory
And this is the way I have to end this story
He was only seventeen, in a madman's dream
The cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh (Uh-huh)
Just another case about the wrong path (Uh-huh)
Straight and narrow or your soul gets cast
Good night
[Outro]
(Knock him out the box, Rick
Knock him out, Rick)
- Oh boy, that Uncle Ricky is really weird
- I know right what does he mean
“Straight and narrow or yo’ soul gets cast""?
- I don’t know, I think he be crackin' it up or something
- Well, good night
- Good night

Uh, used to be Valentines, together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
It's like I sent my love with a text two times
Call 'cause I care, but I ain't get no reply (No reply)
Tryna see eye to eye, but it's like we both blind
Fuck it, let's hit the club, I rarely sip but pour me some
'Cause when it's all said and done
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to

I hate liars, fuck love, I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big, but it beat quiet

I don't never feel like we vibin'
'Cause every time we alone, it's a awkward silence
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And give me back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit, it's over, what you trippin' for?

Shorty full of drama, like Gangsta Gri-zills

You made me wanna say bye-bye (Say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (Say bye-bye, say, say)
Say bye-bye to her (Say bye-bye, bye-bye, deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (Say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (Say bye-bye, say, say)
Say bye-bye to her (Say bye-bye), deuces"

Ms. Hill, you got skills, that's a gift, it's real
Get ill, what you spit got the power to uplift the heel

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
I wish I could talk to Lauryn
I mean excuse me, Ms. Hill
And let her know how much we love her is real
The industry was beating her up
Then those demons started eating her up
She need a savior that'll bleed in a cup, yup
We used to kick it in the salad days
When she look at me like she ain't know me when she see me nowadays
I nod, she nod back, that's how it stay
Her songs still better than anything out than ""Hot"" or ""Power"" play
Remember how they accused her of saying, he did her album without help
Then she went to Rome to sing and tell the Pope about herself
Just after she left the Fugees, started rolling with the Marleys
Got back with her crew at Dave Chapelle's Block Party
She made songs about Zion and trying to be faithful
Took Black Star on tour in Europe, I was so grateful
Speaking for myself but I'm sure I could speak for Dante
I got to watch a show with Nina Simone and Harry Belafonte
We used to chill at Nkiru, her moms was a customer
She used to love to buy the books by Octavia Butler
Parable of the Sower, the main character's name was Lauren
What the album did for black girls' self-esteem was so important
I got concerned when she got sick on the road
She ain't healthy, I'm a brother
And I wish that I could pick up the load, but no

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Got your assistant on the the phone, ""I need to talk to Lauryn""
And I wanna walk through the storm, and I could be the umbrella when the rain is pouring
Please, this no disrespect to whoever your man is, though
This relationship is strictly music like D'Angelo
I know you hate Babylon, and wanna see it fall
But they won't let you read your poem at the BET awards
You give us hope, you give us faith, you the one
They don't like what you got to say
But still they beg you to come, whoa
Now that's powerful sis, it's black power
We get money, keep our eyes on the final hour
And no I ain't saying you Christ, that would be sacrilegious right?
But you can blow and you nice, sisters them raps is vicious
The raps the sisters recite with their black fist up
The devil's last wish is a queen that rise past bitches
We used to read Francis Crest or anything
By Third World Press impressed
But what the power of the word suggest
Hatched ideas in our heads like birds in the nest
You gave birth to a new sound like Donda West, yes
Should I be saying all of this while the mic is on?
I might as well let it out because one day I might be gone
I write this song and hope you feel how much we love you
And you play it, cause I really ain't got the words to say it
But yo

Swagger Jacksons Revenge,Jay Electronica,['hip hop'],"[Intro: Michael Jackson and 60 Minutes' Ed Bradley]
Michael Jackson:
""Just because it's in print doesn't mean it's the Gospel
People write negative things because they feel that's what sells
Good news to them doesn't sell.""

Edward Bradley: ""How has it impacted you?
You know, touring, record sales...""

Jackson: ""My record is number one all over the world
All over the world. America's the only one because
I don't want to say too much.""

Bradley: ""But it's not number one in the United States.""
Jackson: ""It's a conspiracy, yeah
I will never stop helping and loving people,the way Jesus said to
He said, continue to love, always love, bring on the children
Imitate the children. Not childish, but child-like.""

[Verse: Jay Electronica]
It's the return of the black Moors with no fez
Scary like that documentary on Lisa Lopez
Pentagrams, pyramids, conspiracies with goat heads
Knock down the levees
Knock down the projects
Start another project
Build another object
A drive-thru touchscreen doctrine for me to digest
Just horses with our blinders on
Drivin' by the obvious
Ridin' by the obvious
Flyin' by the obvious (uh huh)
Regardless who you vote for
If the mind don't grow
And the poverty line don’t go
But the dope keep coming
And the tv keep flashing images of a sports car
Then you bound for a coke war
The meek get clowned by the coke law
The sheep get drowned in the folklore
Then lulled to sleep by Tom Brokaw
What a pity, the hope on a politician's tongue
Never ever trickles down the city
So if a nigga put a president's mask on
And run up in the bank with a Mac saying ""gimme gimme!""
I ain't glad at him
But I ain't mad at him
(I ain't mad at him)
If anybody ask you who I be
Say a painter with a felt pen who drew Ali
I'm like Cassius when I blast molasses
Out the ass of the masses
From Fulton Street Mall to Gratiot
I'm handin out free at last kits
Yo, Jay, where ya staff at?
Green said you threw it
Yeah, I outgrew it
Some blogs said, “you blew it”
Nigga, fuck yo' blog
Jigga man said you can't knock the hustle, dog
I'm on the same launchin' pad that shot Russell off
That's why I stay dougie
That's why I stay dougie
That's why I stay dougie"

Noemie Lenoir, Chanel, Sessilee Lopez
Arlenis Sosa, Selita Ebanks
Grew up on Mobb Deep and speak that Jourdan Dunn language
Make a phone call out to Joan Smalls
I wonder how it feel in Lara Stone's walls?
Jessica Gomes, y'all, I would damage her
And see if Jessica Stam got the stamina
I’m in the car with Leo and the Benz swerve
I heard Bar was friends with Esti Ginzburg
Coco Rocha, Kate Mimosa
Alessandra Ambrosio, Anja Rubik and Olga
Kurylenko, tell her I’m very single
Abbey Lee too, I’m a freak, boo

Miami nights, on the search for some T and A
Tryin' to hide what’s obvious to see in me
We conversate a bit about your DNA
And my salmon-colored suit from the VMAs
Oh, you was watchin'? Who the fuck wasn’t?
Me, skip across that stage in five dozen
Yuuugh! Six grand for a minute's time
Italian Vogue styled a nigga for a minute-rhyme
Let's be clear, and let's be fair
The best thing in music’s being offered here
It's a round table full of bosses here
Still giving you it all like the coffin's near

[Verse 3: Ryan Leslie]
It’s time for a lesson in model behavior
Damn, look at all the bad bitches I gave you
Man, I can see the flaws to your flavor
Look like Wonder Woman and still need a savior
Maybe it's a billionaire, maybe it's that cocaine
I done seen drugs and money run the whole game
A good girl lost in the city life
Agent Provocateur, hold them titties right
I'm haute couture of hoes galore
Give my girl a Newport 'cause she's smoking yours
I'm the authority of model seniority
They call me ""Les"" but they all need more of me
[Verse 4: Lloyd Banks]
Ugh, handcraft material, champagne for cereal
Shawty stole my heart, criminal, my lucky charm, ugh
Fly clothes and Lear shows take the stuff we on
Stuff all my problems in that bong, and I’m puffin' strong
I been locked in my way of thinkin', now my cuffs are gone
Must’ve been the liquor talkin, I’m beggin' the cups, c'mon (C'mon)
Might come off as irregular, I come in custom form
T-G-I-F, GT breeze, my hustler’s poem (Yeah)
My sound’s full-grown, reminds me of my favorite chronic (Kush)
Ball like a SuperSonic, make the haters vomit (Ugh!)
Nigga, make some money ‘fore you make a comment
I meant to snap a while ago, but who knows where the time went?
Probably dime chicks, whips with a Diddy
Now I’m back like a nine-milli, running New York City
See me clearly through the storm, the world’s mine
Sits pretty in my palm, Chandon as we continue on

Niggas think they know, only got half of the story
They don't really know what's in my head fuckin' with me
How can I be better? I could start with just the basics
Dior, Dior galore, I love the cut
I seem to have forgotten that I’m off the looney
To the people who don't know Cud, know what?
Rose gold presidential on my bony wrist
Took my ma to Chanel, held Elsie, the stunner
She got haters, some in the fam made us
But they don’t really matter, we escape 'em with our paper
Hey ya, I’m on my André 3000
I’m all good now, a nigga don’t need no counseling
Woke up in the room and my mojo was active
Looks from the hoes that were more than likely passive
Back when–let me not reflect on the old shit
I’m on to the new act, on to my new script
Bitches better have they thoughts before approachin'
I done heard it all, baby, save it for them other niggas
Doin' things off-beat for a living

Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On the carousel, so around I spun
With no directions, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, livin' in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none
[Pre-Chorus 1: B.o.B]
There's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinkin' maybe I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant, but I was wonderin'
If there was somethin' that you wanna know (That you wanna know)
But never mind that, we should let it go (We should let it go)

Always hoping for the worst, waiting for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean when I tell her keep it drama free
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
Chu-chuckin' up them deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Yeah, yeah)
Told you that I'm leaving, deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Woah, woah)
I know you're mad, but so what? I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up

[Verse 2: Drake]
What you mean I ain't call you? I hit you when I landed
I'm waitin' in my hotel room
Seems like we're arguin' more and it's gettin' less romantic
Yeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon
But I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
I'll fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean, this part of our relationship's amazin' still
I might just put up with the arguin' and stay, for real
You lookin' bad, girl, for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
I'm willin' to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days
Well, girl, that makes two of us, our timing is wrong
Your friends always tyin' up every line on your phone
Yeah, but tell them bitches that you'll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fuckin' business
Is mindin' your own, uh, and every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired, then I break you off
It's useless, all this fightin', let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around
[Verse 3: T.I.]
Your wrist and fingers glisten, ice cold like Michigan
Ayy, look at what we livin' in, here we go with this again
I just keep on talkin', but I guess that you ain't listenin'
Rather run around with them nothin'-ass bitches then
Go on, got me hot, smokin' like a chimney
We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemies
Deep inside it’s killin' me, but soon it's gon' be killin' you
To see her in that two-seater, know that's gon' hurt your feelings, boo
Ah ha, didn’t you think you would be over me by now?
So you go sleepin' with them clowns, they are no relief
She spoke her piece, I know, capisce
So love must be let go, released, into the wind
Again, again, and deuces I must throw ya, peace

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
You know what, yo? You a bitch
You should have a travel agent, ‘cause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fuckin' issues, you fuckin' bitch
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me, her second son
Get your mind right, baby, or get your shit together
You gonna be hot a little while, I'ma be rich forever
Girl seducers, they come in deuces
But when I cut 'em off they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turned it to his new bitch (Haha)
I'm stupid, but I won't get my drama on
What I'm dealin' with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk 'bout “you know who”
I don't know who you talkin' 'bout

According to my old bish, I be on some new ish
She was on some oldish, now I got a new bish
Think I give two-ish? You ain't gonna do ish
Meet my two fingers, intro-deuces
If you knew better, you'd do better
Wanna get the middle finger, but I got two better

Know you gon' miss me a little when I’m gone

Come on, that's old news, yesterday's paper (Nice)
Oh, you talkin', what about?
If it ain't how I kept you studded out
You might as well shut your mouth
You'll never score another me, I'll shut it out
Act like there's gum in your hair, girl, cut it out!

Got a pocket full of hundreds, she the only one that's missin'
Got a bucket full of ice, and a watch to go with it (Ugh!)

Haters better put their head down, they know that boy be fly
All the charter planes, now I’m talkin' ballers slang
R.O.Z.A.Y. on that wall in that Hall of Fame (Ugh!)
I let my denim sag, red Louis belt
How can you love me, baby? First, you gotta love yourself
[Verse 8: Andre 3000]
The farewell email from a female
But I’m a playa, ain't gonna tell you all the details
What it entails is hard to say, like sellin' seashells
By the seashore, but she’s not a bore
But neither a whore who needs to know more
The kind you can’t ignore but want to open the door for
Or run in your favorite store, and leave with all them shopping bags and half of it ain't yours
I did things for her; ain't rich, ain't poor
I wanted to do more, but hell, I just ain't know her
Well enough to know if this is all she came for
But enough to know tonight excited she came four
Times to my cousin house to see if I was there
Get your minds out the gutter, man
We out here tryna have a good time
And here I am, all heavy with the words where
Somebody that's a nerd, likely fast forward
But, shit, they asked for it
It’s hard to throw up them deuces
‘Cause when you know it’s juicy
You start to sound like Confucius when makin' up excuses
Chase Cabooses until the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop makin' sad songs

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her"

A long way from hustlin', that china white

Alright
Baby listen, they playing our song
You want to slow dance with me? C'mon
You can just say no
You ain't gotta be a douche about it

[Verse]
I was just a kid, she was just a kid
Lost in the mix, it didn't matter what we did
She used to baby me, I was her baby doll
I used to chase her around, she was my basketball
I guess it had to fall, I should've known
No model to follow, we were both from broken homes
But we used to laugh about acting grown up
And I could hear her mom in the back yelling hang the phone up
A teenage love, a teenage love
Keep up the crush on what it means to us
It's okay girl, we don't even need to fuck
I was the first one to show her what a penis was
We used to sit on the park bench and hold hands
Staying out past dark to feel the romance
Summer time I was waking up early
Bounce out the flat little worm, get the birdy
Walk to her house and watch a couple movies
Kissing on her nipples, playing with the coochy, whoo!
That's as far as it ever got, pet the spot
Get her all wet and hot, and then it stopped
Frustration, soon after that
She broke up with me like boom it's a wrap
She said that we were moving too fast
No seducing the ass, she needed room to relax
But hold up now, I don't understand
All I really wanted was to be your lover man
We can wait, no pressure, I'll be patient
She said stop calling me, I'm taking a vacation
So there it was decorated with the wordplay
I'm at school and I'm tryna hide my hurt face
She started seeing others but it got worse, wait
She let my homeboy hit it on the first date
[Bridge]
Oooh!
Sorry dude
Makes me wanna sing, I wanna sing, c'mon

{Hook: x3}
I don't miss you, but I remember you
You taught a lesson and for that I give you gratitude
I'm such a mess with love and sex
But I don't fuck around with my best friend's ex, nah"

Be careful or you'll be history
Looks like another unsolved mystery
It's murder! (Murder, murder)
Ahhh, it's murder! (Murder, murder)
Yeah, it's murder! (Murder, murder)
Somebody tell 'em it's murder!
Murder was the case – and they blamed me

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Officer, I didn't do it, you can't blame me for this
Could you please loosen up the handcuffs on my wrists?
You can call me what you wanna, man, but I ain't a snitch
No cooperation is exactly what you will get
'Til I talk to my lawyer, you get no reply
You've obviously been watching too much CSI
I'm not a crash dummy, so don't even try
To talk your dirty trash to me, no BFI
If you are not guilty of anything, then why did you run?
‘Cause you the police! And plus I saw you cocking your gun
And the chamber wasn't empty, it was obviously one
If you think I'm believing that one, then you're obviously dumb
I know that you heard the sirens, you dived in
To the vehicle you was drivin' and ridin' in
Instead you shouldn't be whinin', but abidin'
By the law, naw, it's obvious that you're lyin'

Stop lying to me, boy, it'd be best you confess
I can smell the BS on the scent of your breath
Saw the meth while I was inspecting your deck
Saw that you was ridin' dirty when I looked at the rest
Who is this guy Busta? Who is this guy Snoop?
Who is his other friend who's wearing the sky blue?
Look at this pic here, he standing beside you
Tell me his name now, I heard he was Piru
Confiscated the CD's at one of your homes
For evidence ever since we heard some of your songs
What about this Pimp guy? He was on one of your songs
I could've sworn that he said he had a ""Pocket Full of Stones""
Am I wrong? Hell yeah! I don't know who that is!
I don't know no Pimp C, all I know is I'm rich
And I'ma bond, like James, bet I be out here quick, man
You ain't getting out of here, you must think that you're slick
In the car we confiscated the chronic and the clips
Diary that you had and all your blueprints
On the Death Row booklet we found your two prints
Your thumb and your index, the judge will love this

Gave us a description, so we picked up your boy, and
You'll get a lighter sentence if you put the crime on him

A big celebrity, a case we long for
You a pirate? Why you got that eyepatch on for? (Funny)
Putting people in a hearse what I heard for
Where were you the night of April 21st, son? (Home)
I think you got your facts wrong, gat's on
You, Chamillionaire, robbed, shot a couple cats on Melview
(What?) We gonna have to jail you too
In the lineup, don't speak until we tell you to
This the person who jimmied your lock, sir?
Well, it's dark, kinda look like him, I'm not sure
Failure to nail, ‘cause assailant's another
Believe I see an unmarked tailing a brother
Hit the bodega, not no more game
This chick used to be nice acting all strange
Like she was gonna get it, pathetic
Assailant caught, now they all apologetic

The Warning,Eminem,['hip hop'],"[Intro: Eminem]
Only reason I dissed you in the first place
Is 'cause you denied seeing me, now I'm pissed off

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Sit back, homie, relax, in fact, grab a six pack
Kick back while I kick facts, yeah, Dre—sick track
Perfect way to get back, wanna hear something wick-wack?
I got the same exact tat that's on Nick's back
I'm obsessed now, oh gee
Is that supposed to be me in the video with the goatee?
Wow Mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out
Bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore I put all them phone calls out
You made to my house when you was wildin' out before Nick
When you was on my dick and give you something to smile about
How many times you fly to my house, still tryin' to count
Better shut your lyin' mouth if you don't want Nick findin' out
You probably think 'cause it's been so long
If I had something on you I woulda did it by now
Oh on the contrary, Mary Poppins, I'm mixin' our studio
Session down and sendin' it to masterin' to make it loud
Enough dirt on you to murder you
This is what the fuck I do; Mariah it ever occur to you
That I still have pictures? However you prefer to do
And that goes for Nick too, faggot, you think I'm scurred of you?
You're gonna ruin my career, you better get one
Like I'ma sit and fight with you over some slut bitch cunt
That made me put up with her psycho ass over six months
And only spread her legs to let me hit once, yeah
What you gonna say, I'm lucky? Tell the public that I was so ugly
That you fuckin' had to be drunk to fuck me?
Second base, what the fuck you tell Nick, Pumpkin?
The second week we were dry humpin', that's gotta count for somethin'
Listen, girly, surely you don't want me to talk
About how I nutted early 'cause I ejaculated prematurely
And bust all over your belly and you almost started hurling
And said I was gross, go get a towel, your stomach's curling
Or maybe you do, but if I'm embarrassin' me
I'm embarrassin' you and don't you dare say it isn't true
As long as that song's gettin' airplay, I'm dissin' you
I'm a hair away from gettin' carried away and gettin' sued
I was gonna stop at sixteen, that was thirty-two
This is thirty-four bars, we ain't even third of the way through
Damn Slim, Mariah played you, Mariah who?
Oh did I say ""whore,"" Nick? I meant a liar too
Like I've been goin' off on you all this time
For no reason, girl, you out your alcoholic mind
Check your wine cellar, look at the amounts of all the wine
Like I fuckin' sit around and think about you all the time
I just think this shit is funny when I pounce you on a rhyme
But fuck it, now I'm 'bout to draw the line
And for you to cross it that's a mountain that I doubt you wanna climb
I can describe areas of your house you wouldn't find
On an episode of Cribs, a blow below the ribs
If I hear another word so don't go openin' your jibs
'Cause every time you do it's like an overload of fibs
I ain't sayin' this shit again, ho, you know what it is
It's a warning shot, 'fore I blow up your whole spot
Call my bluff and I'll release every fuckin' thing I got
Includin' the voicemails right before you flipped your top
When me and Luis were tryin' to stick two CDs in the same slot

Let me whisper sweet nothings into your ear, boo
Now what you say? (It's nothing) Yeah so what I'll do
Is refresh your memory when you said (I want you)
Now should I keep goin' or should we call truce?
(You think you're cute, right?) You bet your sweet ass I do
(I'm Mary Poppins, baby) And I'm Superman, ooh

So if you'll still be my (Baby girl)

It cuts like a (Knife) when I tell you get a (Life)

And if you got beef I turn it to a tenderloin
Sanity kills so I live the crazy life

Rock bottom, where them cops got a problem at
Where them outsiders getting popped for they wallet at

Smoking more reefer than Redman and 'em
Damaging MCs, and my name—'Riq, geez

Of naysayers, cheaters and thieves
All it gave me was a good enough reason to leave
And put the writing on the wall for y'all to read it and weep

Place down your jewels, cash and four-four

Fuck around and make your town Warsaw

My technique is to ambush you, guerilla-style
My instinct is of a killer whale

And me, the Five Footer
I kicks the mad style so step off the frankfurter
Yo, Phife, you remember that routine
That we used to make spiffy like Mr. Clean?

Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram
I'm like an energizer 'cause, you see, I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack, that's where you're dead wrong
I slayed that Buddy in El Segundo then Push it Along
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
'Cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shout of peace goes out to all my pals, you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's
'Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me
They get vexed, I roll next, can't none contest me
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
On top remaining, no home training 'cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt, the Jim must be erect
You see, my aura's positive, I don't promote no junk

Well, it's kinda simple, just remain your own
Or you'll be crazy, sad and alone

You're not a man, you're a serpent
Then I prayed to God let the nine get to workin'

[Hook]
I better get to workin'
You know I heard they hood robbin'
Your money or your life and there ain't no stopping
I better get to workin'
You know I heard they hood robbin'
Your money or your life and there ain't no stopping
[Bridge]
Ain't that a bitch
When you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich
Ain't that a bitch
When you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich

[Verse 3]
Uh, drug dealer MD
Doctor feel good, give you what you need
In California, prescribe that weed
Oxy cotton and codeine
Turn your grand mama into a fiend
And see the sign not at first, it ain't free
I know you 'bout to die, but let me see your ID
I know you 'bout to lie, but can you pay this fee?
If you can't pay, then please have a seat
You can't see a doctor, but you could see a priest
We can’t save your life 'til we got some assurance
Your premium is paid at that insurance
I hope you got endurance
They got me on hold, and I'm under the influence
Nurse high as a kite
In charge with my life
And everything is lost
Without a Blue Cross
[Hook]
You know I heard they hood robbin'
Your money or your life and there ain't no stopping
You know I heard they hood robbin'
Your money or your life and there ain't no stopping

[Bridge]
Ain't that a bitch (that's a bitch)
When you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich
Ain't that a bitch (that's a bitch)
When you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich

[Outro]
Whatever you need
We got it for cheap right here, baby
This America, it ain't gonna cost you nothing
But a arm and a leg
Maybe one of them motherfuckin' ears
Don't trip, just put it on your credit card
Put it in your baby name"
Mosh,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'alternative']","[Intro]
I pledge allegiance to the flag
Of the United States of America
And to the republic for which it stands (People)
One nation, under God, indivisible
With liberty and justice for all (It feels so good to be back)
(Mosh with me now)

[Verse 1]
Scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel, re-energize, and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight, you take it as ""I'ma whip someone's ass""
And if you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a fatherless past
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multitaskin'
And juggling both, perhaps mastered his craft slash
Entrepreneur who's helped launch a few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career, typical manure, movin' past that
Mr. Kiss-His-Ass-Crack, he's a class act
Rubber Band Man, yeah, he just snaps back
[Chorus]
Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

[Verse 2]
All the people up top, on the side and the middle
Come together, let's all form and swarm just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people, some white and some black
Don't matter what color, all that matters we're gathered together
To celebrate for the same cause no matter the weather
If it rains, let it rain, yeah, the wetter, the better
They ain't gon' stop us, they can't, we're stronger now more than ever
They tell us no, we say yeah, They tell us stop, we say go
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell, we gon' let 'em know
Stomp, push, shove, mush, fuck Bush
Until they bring our troops home, come on, just

[Chorus]
Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on
[Verse 3]
Imagine it pourin', just rainin' down on us
Moshpits outside the Oval Office
Someone's tryna tell us somethin', maybe this is God just
Sayin' we're responsible for this monster, this coward
That we have empowered, this is Bin Laden
Look at his head noddin'
How could we allow somethin' like this without pumpin' our fists?
Now this is our final hour
Let me be the voice and your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify it, times it, and multiply it by six
'Teen million people all equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach Al-Qaeda through my speech
Let the president answer a higher anarchy
Strap him with an AK-47, let him go
Fight his own war, let him impress daddy that way
No more blood for oil
We got our own battles to fight on our own soil
No more psychological warfare
To trick us to thinkin' that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizin' a hero
Look in his eyes, it's all lies
The stars and stripes have been swiped, washed out, and wiped
And replaced with his own face, mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight, you'll know why
'Cause I told you to fight
[Chorus]
So come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

[Outro: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
And as we proceed
To mosh through this desert storm
And these closing statements
If they should argue, let us beg to differ
As we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army
To disarm this weapon of mass destruction
That we call our president for the present
And mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak and be heard
Mr. President, Mr. Senator
Can you guys hear us?"

Wake up Mr. West, Mr. West
Mr. Fresh, Mister, by himself he's so impressed
I mean damn, did you even see the test?

Homie this shit is basic, welcome to Graduation

Good morning, on this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
I'm like the fly Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary
Detroit Red cleaned up
From the streets to the league, from an eighth to a key
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain, look how far we done came
Haters saying you changed, now you doing your thang

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning and—
Good morning!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Good morning and look at the valedictorian
Scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean
Scared to face the world, complacent career student
Some people graduate, but be still stupid
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
Just peep this, preach this, teach us, Jesus
Okay look up now, they done stole yo' streetness
After all of that you received this

Uh, MS, Lupe
You know I'm a fan man, I'm a real fan

[Hook]
(Gonna be somebody)
Feel real honoured to be up in here
(Gonna be someone)
You know what I'm saying?
They had to bring out the expensive mics for this one
(Gonna be somebody)
You know what I'm saying?
The seven thousand dollar headphones for this one here
(Gonna be someone)
Know what I'm saying?
Come on, talk to me

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
This is the story of them against us, win or lose
Forcing your feet into someone else's shoes
Everybody's got something to say
That we ought to live their way, what we're doing's not okay
In this world, everybody's got a chip on both sides of their neck
Got no respect, wait up a sec
You ever feel like the pressure's too much to take?
Too much weight? Ladies and gentlemen
If anybody can hear me right now, please shout back
We're not the only ones feeling so trapped
In a dream of somebody else, in fact
They got their heads full of some overblown scheme
Opportunity they missed back when they were sixteen
And all they want to do is push you to be that
And all you want to do is scream back
[Hook: Holly, Tak, & Mike]
Gonna be somebody
(For anybody telling me I can't)
Gonna be someone
(For anyone who told me I had no chance)
Gonna be somebody
(I'm telling you, the time has come, like that)
Gonna be someone
(And maybe you'll get it when I'm finally done)

[Verse 2: Mike]
We don't sleep to dream, we sleep to build stamina
Energy to do our thing, get your camera
'Cause this ride is about to begin
Sit down and buckle it in, let me say it again
In this world, everybody's got a chip on
Both sides of the neck, got no respect
Wait up a sec, when I was young
They said the odds of making it were slim to none
Ladies and, fuck it
I'm tired of them saying the dream you have doesn't exist
Telling you you're worthless, saying you should quit
Basically, telling you that you'll never be shit
Really, they're pissed 'cause they'll never achieve
Some opportunity they missed back when they were sixteen
And all they want to do is push you to be that
And all you want to do is scream back
[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Ugh, they gon' think you're crazy mumbling to yourself
In the basement all day, uh-uh-uh'in to yourself
My pops didn't dig it, was shoveling to myself
My boys used to get it, they dug it because they felt
My undertaking took me, I was making in my stealth
A wealth of rhymes of crazy, I would chuckle to myself (Ha)
Then they went into the mental Rolodex
See I'm know 'em by heart, like a brain in my chest
Then I took them to school where subjects was gettin' felt (Ugh)
Books under my seat, notebook laying on my desk
My teacher's like, ""Mr. Jaco?"" ""Yes?""
""With all that knowledge, you ain't tryna go to college?
Be a lawyer or a doctor, get a whole lot of dollars?
Rather degrade women and glorify violence?""
""Well, the work that works for me might not work for you
No homework, I got work to do""

Everything that I’ve given, I swear I’ll never give in

Why, oh why must you swoop through the hood like everybody from the hood? Is up to no good
You think all the girls around here are trickin'
Up there lookin' like Superchicken
At night I see your light through my bedroom window
But I ain't got shit but the pad and pencil
I can't wait till I hear you say
""I'm going down, mayday, mayday."" I'm gonna clown
Cause everytime that the pigs have got me
Y'all rub it in with the flying Nazi
Military force, but we don't want ya
Standin' on my roof with the rocket launcher
""So fly like an eagle.""
But don't follow us wherever we go
The shit that I'm saying, make sure it's heard
Motherfuck you and your punk-ass ghetto bird

[Hook]
""Run, run, run, from the ghetto bird""
""Run, run, run, from the ghetto bird""
[Verse 2]
Now, my homey's here to lick on a trick for a Rolex
And let me try the fo' next
Now the fo' I was driving was hotter than july
Looked up and didn't see a ribbon in the sky
Saw a chopper with numbers on the bottom
""Calling all cars, I think we've got em.""
I hit the gas and I mashed past Inglewood
I think I drove through every single hood
South Central, Compton and Watts
Long Beach, bust a U, here come the cops
Wish I had a genie with about three wishes
Metal flake green on D's I look suspicious
You know that I'm running
Shit, I hear it humming
Fuck, I see it coming
Is it a bird? Yup
Is it a plane? No
I hit me a right on El Segundo
Wanted to holla, had to ditch the Impala
Let's see if they would folla
Me, hit a fence, hit a fence, and another
Met me a baby pitbull and his mother
Ran up in some peoples house and looked out of the window
I wish it was my kinfolk
Had to pull a strap on a fool named Louis the Third
'Cause I'm getting chased by the ghetto bird
[Bridge]
""Just put his hat, ehrrr, he combed his hair and then put his hat back
On. Errr, he's acting nonchalant up there in that cockpit, going 115
Miles an hour, with the police chasing him. Ehm, they're not gonna be
Real happy when they catch up with him, no matter what, the eh
Ehrr, they hate, they hate a bigmouth even worse.""

[Verse 3]
Officer Bird's on his way, and I don't wanna see him
Could you please give me the keys to the B.M.?
See, I didn't want to gank you
But don't make me bank you, thank you
Tried to get to the hood, and you might guess
That a fool like me done shot Cyrus
Incognito, Ghetto Eagle
Saying, ""Fuck, where did he go?""
I bust me a left on Ruthelen. Park
The 735 and I'm bailin
Went to my homegirl's house and got a hug man
She helped me run like Harriet Tubman
Looked out the window by the black bed
I saw the pigs and the fo' on a flatbed
Then the light from the bird hit me in the face
I closed the blinds cause I didn't wanna catch a case
All that night, I heard the bird circle
While I was eating fish and watching Urkel
She said I could sleep on the couch
By two A.M. I was digging her out
Fuck the ghetto bird

""Which way is he going now?""

Levitibus,Canibus,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: TV Sample]
""You want power...but you're not big enough
So you steal it piece by piece, tainted and spoiled
And you're weak... step by step you'll weaken and the power....""

[Verse 1: Canibus]
I harness the power of the chakra, remote viewing into darkness
Describing what I see in the process
Are stone statues surrounded by Neolithic objects
Geoglyphs on the Pampa
A dose of polaramine makes it feel like a dream
The dream state is the playground for the supreme
Critics attempt to follow a trend
Today they call me a charlatan but tomorrow I will be a God of men
To create a universe all I need
Is one thousand trillion trillion degrees
Sodium 22, betatrons and a cloud chamber
Keep the noise down so I don't arouse my neighbors
Got a message from the Falcon and the Snowman
In an unopened Coca-Cola can
Showed the whole plan in coded program
Encrypted by a ProScan modem with a low band
Hold up, let me load it in
[Hook - samples from Outer Limits and ""Exertions (Remix) by Jedi Mind Tricks]
""Put a curse on you""
""You want to take over""
“You clash with cyanide gas and die fast”
""Another mystery"" ""Are you gonna put a curse on me""
""There's no need""
“Rhythmical equivalent of solids, liquids and gas”

[Verse 2: Canibus]
I was created by intelligent design
You are merely a descendant of the unmodified
You diss me out of pride, but when you're finished
Talking about money and bitches you're simply out of rhymes
Even my worst album was sublime
If I don't slow down, I'll distort the timeline
Back through the time tunnel to a 100 Bars again
A master like the honorable Earl of Carnarvon
The grand architect
Used to be a partisan to Lamarckism theory but I lost the bet
No regrets, you live and you learn
I'm through giving advice, I just give concern
Sterilize my hands to prevent catching the germs
And try to rebuild all the bridges I've burned
I prefer modesty over controversy
But what am I to do when these jerks keep bothering me
Jealous because they can't rhyme like me
And they never had a scientific mind like me
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Canibus]
I'm above average with verbal semantics
The Aurora Borealis in the form of a rap ballad
They look at me like, ""Poor bastard
Why can't you manipulate Billboard with all your metaphor magic?""
No matter how hard I practiced
Every microphone I saw I grabbed it, obviously that's the wrong tactic
I went through a long period of mourning and sadness
When I wrote that Stan shit
But if you wanna see some hardcore Canibus just say so
And I'll come out the egg roll with seven dead scrolls
If you can find a better flow?
Then I can find a dinosaur on the Galapagos archipelago
Hey, you shouldn't fall for the naivete
Lyrically I'm the illest but my beats is okay
Food for thought, nutrition for the whole brain
Keep your neurotransmitters warm on a cold day
I'm ahead of my time or so they say
I guess that's why I already feel old and grey
OK, that's enough knowledge for today, I'm killing them
You better not forget it 'cause this is Levitibus

The day of the geechee is gone boy
And you goin' with it
Yeah, nigga
Immortal Technique
Metaphysics

[Verse 1]
The bling-bling era was cute but it's about to be done
I leave you full of clips like the Moon blocking the Sun
My metaphors are dirty like herpes but harder to catch
Like an escape tunnel in prison, I started from scratch
And now these parasites want a percent of my ASCAP
Trying to control perspective like an acid flashback
But here's a quotable for every single record exec
""Get your fucking hands out my pocket, nigga!"" like Malcolm X
But this ain’t a movie, I'm not a fan or a groupie and I'm not
The type of cat you can afford to miss if you shoot me
Curse the Heavens and laugh when the sky electrocutes me
Immortal Technique stuck in your thoughts, darkening dreams
No one's as good as me—they just got better marketing schemes
I'll lead you to your own destruction like sparking a fiend
'Cause you got jealousy in your voice like Starscream
And that's the primary reason that I hate y'all faggots
I've been nice since niggas got killed over 8-ball jackets
And Reebok Pumps that didn't do shit for the sneaker
I'm a heatseaker with features that'll reach through the speaker
And murder counter-revolutionaries personally
Break a thermometer and force-feed his kids mercury
A&R's tried jerking me, thinking they call shots
Offered me a deal and a blanket full of smallpox
You're all getting shot, you little fucking treacherous bitches!
[Hook]
This is the business, and y'all ain’t getting nothing for free
And if you devils play broke, then I'm taking your company
You could call it reparations or restitution
Lock and load, nigga.  Industrial revolution

[Verse 2]
I want fifty-three million dollars for my calloused hands
Like the Bush administration gave to the Taliban
And fuck packing grams, nigga, learn to speak and behave!
You want to spend twenty years as a government slave?
Two million people in prison keep the government paid
Stuck in a six-by-eight cell, alive in the grave
I was made by revolution to speak to the masses
Deep in the club, toast the truth.  Reach for your glasses
I'll burn an orphanage just to bring heat to you bastards
Innocent deep in a casket—Colombian fashion
Intoxicated off the flow like thug's passion
You motherfuckers will never get me to stop blasting
You're better off asking Ariel Sharon for compassion
You're better off begging for twenty points from a label
You're better off battling cancer under telephone cables
Technique chemically unstable, set to explode
Foretold by the dead sea scrolls written in code
So if your message ain’t shit, fuck the records you sold!
'Cause if you go platinum, it's got nothing to do with luck
It just means that a million people are stupid as fuck
Stuck in the underground, a general that rose to the limit
Without distribution managers, a deal, or a gimmick
Revolutionary Volume 2 murder the critics
And leave your fucking body rotting for the roaches and crickets
[Hook]
This is the business, and y'all ain’t getting nothing for free
And if you devils play broke, then I'm taking your company
You could call it reparations or restitution

I read the news today—oh, boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

[Refrain: John Lennon]
I'd love to turn you on
(Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten)
*alarm clock rings*

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

[Interlude: John Lennon]
Ahh-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ahh

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
I read the news today—oh, boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

Black Cloud,Joe Budden,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Nothing stays the same forever
Not even me
Uh, uh
Check this, check It

[Verse 1]
Something must’ve changed me, niggas might defame me
But things that used to taint me, no longer seem to restrain me
Strangely I’m no longer sad, mad or angry
Shame-ably it pains me, feeling like it just ain’t me
Mainly what do I tell all the people that thank me
Namely those who ordain me, aside from can you blame me
Motivation the ""Game"" was supplying me it's no longer providing me
Jason Williams something killed whatever was driving me
Worrying less about the past more about the now
Less about what I’m going through more about the how
It’s for certain spent 30 years being fit for hurdling
Now I’m a different person with nothin' to overcome and I miss the burden
For certain, got 6 figures in my sock drawer
And honestly this year I expect to make a lot more
It’s hard to live without a budget when life is corrupted
In a house that's so peaceful that I’m trying to disrupt it
Scream fuck it not because I have to but because I love it
Which makes me as fake as the puppets that I speak of disgusted
Without a paddle up shit’s creek
Dig deep and see it ain’t life it’s just me
So be warned as I’m putting on like I’m reformed
Only so y’all can accept it as being my norm
Maybe I quit working on me, maybe I given up
Maybe I been lying to myself maybe I give a fuck
[Hook]
It’s enough to make you black out, pull a Mac out
Aim it at the sky while I’m running from the black cloud
Every day we playing cat-and﻿-mouse
As I watch it hovering over my glass house
It’s enough to make you spazz out, pull a Mac out
Aim it at the sky while I’m running from a black cloud
Tired enough for me to pass out, tired of running from the black cloud

[Verse 2]
I say it loud hoping someone can hear me clearly
Trying to make my girl get it she don’t know that it’s very scary
But she’s a nympho she can be barely near me
She still want the God in her, think she Mary Mary
The prettiest bitches just want to service me
While niggas' prettiest bitches wouldn’t get a word from me
Some of you haven’t heard from me, some of you wouldn’t mind murking me
Find that news funny likes its straight from Ron Burgundy
These niggas ain’t never seen dough
They can dream though I bump into ‘em in between shows
People say I'm Emo, what that really mean though
Is though the song can’t breathe I actually make it seem so
I lost loved ones because they couldn’t deal with me
Cherish whoever still with me though the merit's been killed in me
Normally it’s just me and my lonely mind
Everyone storm is different so this forecast is only mine
Fans recognize my misery uplifted me
Shifted me to my epitome, guess the curse is a gift to me
Maybe its serendipity, maybe it’s weighing on me physically
Maybe I should man up and tell God not to solicit me
Been medicated, meditated, sedated, hated
Character assassinated, all theses years I masqueraded
Hard headed, if it was on my mind I had to say it
Tongue on the devil’s pitchfork to see how disaster tasted
Rap is fabricated, rappers are so exaggerated
Wouldn’t be scared of the truth if they weren’t castrated
Grab a mag, spray it, surrounded by people that shoot it before me
That'll unconditionally love my beautiful ugly
Now lemme speak to who I cater to
Would you love me the same if all my weeks were not favorable
Promised to maintain being unique but relate-able
All while suffering from a disease that can do away with you
Poetry on the beat, spoken-word for the masses
Therapy over Pro-Tools, every word is on acid
Consonants on Kush, every vowel is blunted
Highly wanted this whole organization privately funded
This is bigger than the Eiffle, this is alert the public
Had coppers bar our tunnels and our bridges with the rifles
Sentences meant to stifle, this is a man aching
This is the dam breaking, contraband in the making
This is panic unveiling, got potential but I never met it
He be trying to come over, it seem like God won’t let it
Either he never got my invite or he just dismissed it
But if all I’m hearing are the sounds of blackness, why am I pessimistic?
You’ll never progress if you’ll never try
All I ask, let every word I birth, never die
My wings spread, but when I met the sky
Weather didn’t change like I thought and had me petrified
[Hook]
It’s enough to make you black out, pull a Mac out
Aim it at the sky while I’m running from the black cloud
Every day we playing cat-and﻿-mouse
As I watch it hovering over my glass house
It’s enough to make you spazz out, pull a Mac out
Aim it at the sky while I’m running from a black cloud
Tired enough for me to pass out, tired of running from the black cloud"

All of you

Banned from all bars
The man with seven scars

[Verse 1]
Smack it up, flip it, pulled out, 'bout to fell
Sunday in the ATL and I'm all outta ale
Like a bat out of hell, tripped on a cat tail
Mutt drinkin out a pail, who let the rat out the cell?
Got all the ingredients and recipe, might as well
Since last week, the bootlegger been in jail
If all else fail, inhale the L
Makin' sure they can't see your sale via snail mail
Mind like a sewer, servin' rhyme on a skewer
DOOM'll step to a fine dime like he knew her
""My black sister!"" She said, ""Step back!"" before he kissed her
She did the dipper and the smack just missed her
There go a list of politics like Henry Kissinger
99% of rap's just a friendly listener
I'm like, ""These dudes must have some screws loose to hate y'all""
Or a couple of ounces short of deuce-deuce or 8 Ball
Y'all know it's time for the end when the day come
Buy a album, get rudely insulted over fake drums
Same CDs you get for free, you break 'em
Wa-alaikum, make 'em eat they food like Steak-umm
Why she wanna ask me if I could pass the paprika?
One hand on the mic, the other on the beaker
Every week or so, peeked out the lab though, eureka!
A technique to keep somethin' uniquer in ya speaker
For yo' information, I didn't do the beat, y'all
It ain't my fault if she didn't move her feet at all
Skeeter, robbed Peter to pay Paul
So he could trick it on Mary so she can play ball
[Chorus]
She better have my skrilla
Cut it out with all that funny hand jive, will ya?
All this trouble for a tall glass of Olde E
Drink it all fast and make you haul ass slowly
Remind me to remember what you told me
Holy moly, did you get a load of her roly-poly?
Yo, G, remind me to remember what you told me
Whoever don't feel him, feel balls like a goalie

[Verse 2]
One for the money, two for the better green
3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine
Told the knock-kneed ghetto queen, ""Get the head fiend""
Tell him it's from Medellin and use oxyacetylene
Who needs airplay? It's all just hearsay
Leave a wig like it was having a bad hair day
Miracle glide master, asked him what's his secret
He said, ""Shasta, it turns to formaldehyde faster""
When I'm home with my lady, I try to duke her daily
One night, she tried to flail me with her ukulele
Pack your heat, the Villain on the cover of Black Beat
With a bunch of crackers and some snack meat

[Chorus]
They better have my skrilla
Cut it out with all that funny hand jive, will ya?
All this trouble for a tall glass of Olde E
Drink it all fast and make you haul ass slowly
Remind me to remember what you told me
Holy moly, did you get a load of her roly-poly?
Yo, G, remind me to remember what you told me"

Render unto Geedorah what is Geedorah's
Ten to one he sees ya through a beaker and a tweezers
Read the fine print and be like, ""What's the big deal?""
Spun wheels of steel since broke wheel Big Wheel
Back when it was greasy S-curl, now it's easy dread
Had a rhyme on how they used to tease him 'bout his peasy head
Yes-yes-y'all to the beat, have it bald or Avacor
Have it your way, or grab his drawer, Jabberjaw
Since two tone Lee's, these new phonies is boney ho's
Lonely, like cheese and balogna only
I could've broke my ""sacro-philly-ac""
Silly grind, Billy Jack, illy nine, milli black
Listen to it go ""bang!"" Through and through a Kangol
A strange combination of a king who teach slang flow
Two-thirds slow, one-third amazing
Wonder words, fine sponsor of this Thunderbird occasion
And have an iller rhyme, at least by Miller Time
Collect the skrilla, and geese with a killer dime
Met her out in Killa Queens, originally she from the Philippines
I love the way she fill her jeans
Still a teen, and made for strange bedfellows
Okay, so it's head to elbows for shell-toes
Uh-oh, heads up! There she blows
A whole load of Head & Shoulders, and who care where she goes
Let the music take control
Just don't let the evildoers abuse it and use it to take your soul
It's like putting fire to fake gold, it turn colors
And get duller than a bake roll with no butter
The shutter of a cake hole
Who break drakes 'til it get old and flake mold
Cornball, have 'em seeing white stars, I warned y'all
Like getting hit with a bottle of Mo' from Sean Paul
""He not white"" ... Oh, he mad light though
Either which way, they not ready for the lightning show
They can't scandalize mine
You could ask a swine who can't stands when I shine
Geedorah the professor, add a question to the lessons
He suggest you get a full assessment instead of guessing
It's too stressing, did he stutter like rookie yes-men?
Or did he just bring the butter, like the cookie chessmen
This just in: they ain't even worth the worry
Lying on their first birth, and couldn't even hurt a Smurf-berry
Hear ye, hear ye! How dare ye
Go up against the king who do his thing tri-yearly?
They too carefree with their mouths around here
Off with his head, and display it at Town Square
On top a seven-feet spike, make sure it's on tight
In light of when the peasants throw stones with all their might
Skull get smashed for weeks
'Til vulture beaks eats the last meat off the cheeks
Maybe then they'll know the right words to speak
Out loud, at home, in the world, or in the streets
There's no escape, just in case
All the kings' mens and 'em decides to go apes
The most slick-talking of burly guys
Get caught early and boiled in oil like curly fries
Even those that's Mr. Furley's size that earned the fate
Can all get burned at the stake
Send word to his closest kins, that for his sins
We claim his throne, his providence, and its citizens
In the name of King Geedorah!
Don't make him catch a seizure
[Outro: Samples]
""We regret that you have not yet complied with our order
We interpret this as a negative reply
We are prepared therefore to conquer the earth""
""We have stationed King Geedorah in the Western Hemisphere
Geedorah was always one of their weapons
And King Geedorah is completely controlled by our computers through magnetic waves""
""Are you a homo? (Like the others)
We help thousands of homos every month!""
""All I’m saying right…
Is in the old days right..
The women knew who the women were
The men knew who the men were
The women knew who the men were
And the men knew who the women were.""
""I'm here to tell you that the future of your planet is at stake
I urge that you transmit that message to the nations of the Earth""
""Now do you feel like telling me where your leader is?"""

Sheitan never came so ill, he got skill
Met a brother from the grill that gave my spine chills
All thirty three nerves, controlling my curves
Common sense just swerved every time I got served
Stress, frustration, empty rhetoric
Cold as winter in Connecticut, compassion lacking deficit
Thought it was love like, sent from above, you not a soulmate
More ways and actions of a primate
Who by low and census coming faker than extensions
Pissed away all good intentions, outta here sister was missin'
Intuition, maybe it was me, I couldn't see

Leave you in a blue lagoon lost (True)
Three nines in the glove with Masu, D-Don and The Gov'
Right behind on a bus
Haters don't touch (What?)
Weigh us both up
Now my neighbor doped up
Got the cable hooked up
All channels, lift my shirt, all mammal
You ship off keys and we ship Grand Pianos
Sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump
Sippin' on a forty, yo, smokin' on a blunt
Bust my gun, y'all, Red and Meth didn't jump
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Yeah, come on
Red and Meth didn't jump

Sickos,Harlem Shakes,"['alternative', 'rock']","[Verse 1]
Welcome back to your sweet city
The wind sings in your face that you're at home
A hundred old lovers talking by themselves
Keep me company while I'm home

Getting high amidst these free skies like
Way back in the day
Remember when you said that if I'd stay you'd always stay?
Getting high amidst these free skies like
Way back in the day

If there's a bomb in your hand just throw it
If the ground's too hot, just run
This place is filled with sickos!
This place is filled with sickos!

I'd always stand out like a sore thumb
Southern girls, they're oh so sensitive

But can't stand to see me walk out the door? (Ah)

Excuse me it's the fluid makes me woozy when I sip it

I remember when, last past November when
Clown kid got pounded in with the Timberlands
They left him trembling, he was not remembering:
Never tuck your denim in just to floss an emblem
Some would debate, ""Wait, the fella ate gelatin
Or he been listening in to what his weathermens was telling him""
When I could feel it in my melanin, it's compelling
Us to break them off, no reassembling
No science-fiction to no theater near you, coming soon to
Fuck with you frequently like how phases of the moon would do
You could gather 'round like it was an eclipse
Just don't look directly to the bitch, you may be blinded by the scripts
Pass the L, the last to tussle in them shirttails
All hail, King Geedorah, the third rail
700 volts holds rap to a standstill
Fool ignore the rule, fuck up and get his man killed
Two bottles of Dom got his hands filled
And so goes the days of our lives as the hourglass sand spill
And built with Passion and a glass of the 'Ze
(And the lights went down and hey!)
[Hook]
And I knew it was the last day - Wig-Twisting Season
When some could get their wigs twisted back within reason
Mostly with these crimes of treason
And you'll be lucky if there's no squeezing even this evening

[Verse 2]
From how he's feeling, thrilling choice of flow is sick
He's the villain with the million dollar voice-throw trick
He's like a ventriloquist, with his fist in the speaker's back
Couldn't think of no uniquer track, nope, sneak attack
It don't really matter how big them is. So much as a nipple
Cause you could have a chick with D-Triple
'Cept the nipple little, just hot off the griddle
Like how he do monkey rhymers, like Monkey-in-the-Middle by his damn self
Ain't no average MC ahead of me
Getting cheddar instead of the probably better pedigree
With nicknames, sick games as Rick James
Messy games, Sci Fly such as Jesse James
Blast, I figure, ass-hawking ass titty licker
Last one to walk up in, fast-talking city slicker
Got bagged cause of the dirty chick with make-up
Bail out quick for the 7:30 wake-up
My only backup was an A-cup, as far as May
To when the leaves turn red and gold to Nimrod earthday
All else? Worthless to say
(And the lights went down and hey!)
[Hook]
That's when I knew it was the first day - Wig-Twisting Season
When some could get their wigs twisted back within reasoning
Mostly with these crimes of treason men
And y'all be lucky if there's no squeezing even this evening

[Verse 3]
It's like a mosquito, the much sweeter resent the act
I been bent back since my Physical went back
Since, Cultured more of my kin
And for them I keep an L rolled in this hellhole
Hold your head, use your head and hold, or be dead and cold
In the worsest way, soon as the leaves show red and gold
To 'round Nimrod release day
And all else? Needless to say
Wait a motherfucking minute! True facts presented
The names was probably changed just to protect who ain't in it
The XP was three-quarters tinted, 4/5ths was converted
The way his shit was twisted? Ask him if it hurted

[Hook]
Wig-Twisting Season
When some could get their wigs twisted back within reasoning
Mostly with these crimes of lying, and fronting, and cheating
All types of different styles of treason"
Hey,MF DOOM,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop']","[Produced by MF DOOM]

[Intro: MF DOOM + sample]
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
(""Hey!"")
I'd like to thank you all for joining us this evening
Let me know if y'all with me, y'all
(""Hey!"")
Just a couple of things I wanna say

[Verse]
I only play the games that I win at
And stay the same with more rhymes than there's ways to skin cats
As a matter of fact, let me rephrase:
With more rhymes than there's ways to fillet felines these days
Watch the path of the black one: Supervillian
He wrecks clubs for delf in a drunken stupor, chillin'
Ready and willin' to inadvertently foil that
Plan of any rhymer, whiner or spoiled brat
Who got more snottier flows than snotty nose?
And holds mics like he knows karate body blows?
Nobody knows the trouble I see
From the MPV fly dirty tailin' the eye bubble eye thirty
For the record; this is some shit I just thought of, y'all
Science fiction that's not admissible (""Hey!"") in no court of law
I live to rock mics 3-D
The only reason I seek to stop—to snuff the TV
I heard beats, they sound like karaoke
With monkey rhymers on a leash like don't have this fairy choke me
Hit 'em with a penny so we can get these peanuts
And I thought we was nuts, I used to get free cuts
They locks Lex Luthor up in Green Haven
Since when a nigga never really been too clean shaven
Misbehavin' rap stars need Listamint
Call me Mista Bent
I'm at where your sister went
Intelligent, used to write and be well spoke
Now all a nigga wanna do is fight and sell—(""Hey!"")
—tell a joke
This could lead to catastrophe
'Bout to stop the violence right after these last of three
Shots from the black bat got me at headlock
Holdin' on to sanity, by strands of that dreadlock
She told me, ""Get off,"" I said, ""Bitch!
Let me set this shit off so I can get rich right quick""
Then it hit me like the point of intoxication
Nigga, come out and rock this nation like (""Hey!"") ox defacin'
A lot of niggas out is rusty like oxidation
In this world's strangest, most dangerous occupation
But you could do it, you the Super like in your building
Villian like trife Kinder is in All My Children
Plottin' and it sure to pay ends
With some real mature womens, and some more of they friends (""Hey!"")
And when bad men roll tight, it's actual true
Like a pack of Big Bambú, with natural glue
Who grip necks of Becks to triple X?
He just came in 4-D: Follow the ripple effects
And it'll lead you right to him
Oh, snap!
It seems you walked into a trap, through rap
Zoinks!
This place is filled with pretender willies
One false move, and get broke off like end of Phillies
True believers
Ain't nothin new to a
Crook with special powers like how to tell the future uh-uh-
Rhyme of the month two page long
Bustin' off two gages with my cape on wrong
Son, it's on, remind me of a Raekwon tape song
With a fleet of super bad... Status: Rae Dawn Chong
Let me know if y'alls with me, y'all! (""Hey!"")
National and geographic down to the titty-bar
Rep Monster Island City, y'all!
To all my brothers who is doin' unsettlin' bids
You could have got away with it if it was not for them
Meddlin' kids!

Self destruction, you're headed for self destruction

[KRS-One]
Well, today's topic, self destruction
It really ain't the rap audience that's bugging
It's one or two suckers, ignorant brothers
Trying to rob and steal from one another
You get caught in the mid
So to crush the stereotype here's what we did
We got ourselves together
So that you could unite and fight for what's right
Not negative 'cause the way we live is positive
We don't kill our relatives

Pop pop pop
One is shot, who's to blame?
Headlines, front page, and rap's the name

Took a brother's life with a knife as his wife
Cried 'cause he died a trifling death
When he left his very last breath
Was ""I slept so watch your step""

How could you gang-bang?
I never ever ran from the Ku Klux Klan
And I shouldn't have to run from a black man

[MC Lyte]
Funky fresh dressed to impress, ready to party
Money in your pocket, dying to move your body
To get inside you paid the whole ten dollars
Scotch taped with a razor blade taped to your collar
Leave the guns and the crack and the knives alone
MC Lyte's on the microphone
Bum rushing and pushing, snatching and taxing
I cram to understand why brothers don't be maxing
There's only one disco, they'll close one more
You ain't guarding the door, so what you got a gun for?
Do you rob the rich and give to the poor?
Yo Daddy-O, school em some more

[Daddy-O + Wise + both]
Straight from the mouth of Wise and Daddy-O
Do a crime, end up in jail and gotta go
'Cause you could do crime and get paid today
And tomorrow you're behind bars in the worst way
Far from your family, 'cause you're locked away
Now tell me, do you really think crime pays?
Scheming on taking what your brother had?
(You little sucker) you're talkin' all that jazz

[D-Nice]
It's time to stand together in a unity
'Cause if not then we're soon to be
Self-destroyed, unemployed
The rap race will be lost without a trace
Or a clue but what to do
Is stop the violence and kick the science
Down the road that we call eternity
Where knowledge is formed and you'll learn to be
Self-sufficient, independent
To teach to each is what rap intended
But society wants to invade
So do not walk this path they laid
It's...

Self destruction, you're headed for self destruction

[Ms. Melodie]
I'm Ms. Melodie and I'm a born again rebel
The violence in rap must cease and seckle
If we want to develop and grow to another level
We can't be guinea pigs for the devil
The enemy knows, they're no fools
Because everyone knows that hip-hop rules
So we gotta get a grip and grab what's wrong
The opposition is weak and rap is strong

[Doug E. Fresh]
This is all about, no doubt, to stop violence
But first let's have a moment of silence
*Fresh beatboxes*... swing
Things been stated re-educated, evaluated
Thoughts of the past have faded
The only thing left is the memories of our belated
And I hate it, when
Someone dies and gets all hurt up
For a silly gold chain by a chump (Word up)
It doesn't make you a big man (And)
To want to go out and dis your brother man (And)
You don't know that's part of the plan (Why?)
'Cause rap music is in full demand
Understand

[Chorus]
Self destruction, you're headed for self destruction

[Just-Ice]
My name is Just-Ice — a man, not a prankster
I was known as the gangster
But believe me that is no fun
The time is now to unite everyone
You don't have to be soft to be for peace
Robbing and killing and murdering is the least
You don't have to be chained by the beast
But party people it's time I release!

[Heavy D]
Ayo here's the situation: idiodicy
Nonsense, violence, not a good policy
Therefore we must ignore, fighting and fussing
Heavy's at the door so there'll be no bum-rushing
Let's get together or we'll be falling apart
I heard a brother shot another, it broke my heart
I don't understand the difficulty, people
Love your brother, treat him as an equal
They call us animals — mmm mmm, I don't agree with them
I'll prove them wrong, but right is what you're proving them
Take heed before I lead to what I'm saying
Or we'll all be on our knees, praying

[Fruitkwan]
Yo Heavy D, deep in the heart of the matter
The self-destruction is served on a platter
Making a day not failing to anticipate
They got greedy so they fell for the bait
That makes them a victim, picked then plucked
New jack in jail, but to the vets they're a duck
There's no one to rob, 'cause in jail you're a number
They never took the time to wonder about

[Chorus]
Self destruction, you're headed for self destruction
Self destruction, you're headed for self destruction

[Chuck D + (Flavor Flav)]
Yes, we urge to merge, we live for the love of our people
The hope: they get along (Yeah, so we did a song)
Getting the point to our brothers and sisters
Who don't know the time (Boyyyee, so we wrote a rhyme)
Instead in your head, you know, our job
To build and collect ourselves with intellect (Come on)
To revolve, to evolve to self-respect
'Cause we got to keep ourselves in check
Or else it's...

[Chorus]
Self destruction, you're headed for self destruction
Self destruction, you're headed for self destruction"

Came in Grindin’, Ye’ came Through the Wire
Met at the crossroads, Bone thugs inspired
1st of the month, Trump to the buyers

My life’s prom night and guess who’s the Prom King
They having a kissing fight and I’m Don King
Everybody know I’m coming soon like LeBron’s ring
I’m Big L, Notorious, Big Pun, Shawn Carter
Sean Combs and Connery all in one
Whoever told you sky’s the limit is looking dumb
Cause I’m 22 and I’m moonwalking on the sun
Oh thats your girl?
She feelin on my ""whoa there!"", right next to a couple boaters
And she tryna motor boat her
And im coming from the w-w-westside of the Motor
You might find banana clips ’cause it’s Guerilla warfare
Last year I was watching this from the couch
And now I’m here
That should let you know what I’m about
Reaper black suit cuz my whole team’s killing
Had to keep setting trends cuz your whole team stealin

Won’t stop til I get that Mercedes 700 CLK and Mercedes ain't made it yet

And being dope made you broke I am piss poor
I’m big poppa plus I’m Tupacalypto
My mind is a weapon what I need to pop a clip for
Huh, I’m doing this for hip hop
Im coming after you, him and his spot
Still tied to the streets like a hitch knot
Ain't nothing fake, I’m not a Rolly with a tick tock
Atlanta repper in the home of the Yankee
Rose wood suit on with the hanky
I got rich from the zones of the stanky
So everybody know my money long, lanky!
So I’m flexible stretching out my decimel’s
Switching up the flow got the crowd going testicles
Can’t bleep it out cuz there wasn’t nothing sexual

Leave requested from the years I’ve invested
Arrested, develop, addressed it, envelope
The body of the black party from Farley to Bob Marley
Go home or go hard, at home is life hardly

[Verse 5: Kanye West]
The plan was to drink till the pain over
What’s worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air rolling down the window
Too many urkels on your team thats why your Winslow
I sold my soul to the devil thats a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me loneliness
Get away from me misery
Get away from me fake bitches, I can’t take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
I’m an only child lost in the World (DJ Premier)
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring
Feeling like hell rings
Bringing me back down
Checking my background
Its ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didn’t have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I’m spaced out Dog, I be on that Moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And I ain't finna change, so we’ll never agree again
Just a few things pouring out my soul
Rosewood we could see her with our eyes closed"
Rik Smits,Asher Roth,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","Part time problem, full time nonchalant
A stone flow, better known as Ash Roth
Went from Ramen to rhyming
Now I’m on top of the charts
Who would of thought them thoughts was cash crops
Ya’ll can eat my almonds
All of ya’ll that who thought that I was soft
And didn’t know that the jaw was Bradshaw
Yeah, Pittsburg steeler than wheels they scratch on
My fault that I feel I’m the realest in rap dog
Black Thought, mixed with a kid ripping on Falkor
More like Rik Smits spin without using a backboard
Nick swish, flip switch, when I get into rap form
That’s pure glory what else would I fucking rap for?
All the girls, glitz, and glow eventually goes
And I know and I’d only end up in an elephant's nose
In some trunk, trunk of a truck fucked in the butt
By some drug smuggling thug I met in the club
Fuck that, smoking blunts with a couple of buds
Bust a bunch of upper cuts when I’m up on a Just Blaze beat
They blame me when I blaze these trees
While they prescribe pills for the ADD
Like the enemy is energy
Let them be athletic
Yeah don’t think they any better cause they're getting Bs instead of Cs
Look at what they try and teach
Give them what they want to read
Personally my favorite one is Jimmy and the giant peach
Why wouldn’t I try to reach a level that they kinda see
Seen as condescending that you overlook the obvious
Asher Roth a lobbyist for teaching as a hobby
Tell the kids to speak their mind and to think of what they wanna
If you want to smoke some juana just to get it out you outta
Cause everything you wanted isn’t coming from your momma
Or a daughter
Same thing if you believe in God or karma
No matter how you’re brought up we’ll be in it all tomorrow

They Schools,dead prez,"['hip hop', 'alternative', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz']","[Intro: Sample & stic.man]
Why haven't you learned anything?
Man that school shit is a joke
The same people who control the school system control
The prison system, and the whole social system
Ever since slavery, naw I'm sayin'?

[Verse 1: stic.man]
I went to school with some redneck crackers
Right around the time 3rd Bass dropped the Cactus Album
But I was reading Malcolm
I changed my name in '89 cleaning parts of my brain
Like a baby nine
I took they history class serious
Front row, every day of the week, 3rd period
Fucking with the teachers head, calling 'em racist
I tried to show them crackers some light, they couldn't face it
I got my diploma from a school called Rickards
Full of, teenage mothers, and drug dealing niggas
In the hallways, the po-po was always present
Searching through niggas possessions
Looking for, dope and weapons, get your lessons
That's why my moms kept stressin'
I tried to pay attention but they classes wasn't interestin'
They seemed to only glorify the Europeans
Claiming Africans was only three-fifths of human beings
[Chorus: stic.man & Keanna Henson]
They schools can't teach us shit
My people need freedom, we trying to get all we can get
All my high school teachers can suck my dick
Telling me white man lies straight bullshit (bullshit)
They schools ain't teaching us, what we need to know to survive
(Say what, say what)
They schools don't educate, all they teach the people is lies

[Interlude: stic.man]
You see dog, you see how quick these motherfuckers be to like
Be telling niggas get a diploma so you can get a job
Know what I'm saying but they don't never tell you how the job
Gonna exploit you every time know what I'm saying that's why I be like
Fuck they schools!

[Verse 2: M-1]
School is like a 12 step brainwash camp
They make you think if you drop out you ain't got a chance
To advance in life, they try to make you pull your pants up
Students fight the teachers and get took away in handcuffs
And if that wasn't enough, then they expel y'all
Your peoples understand it but to them, you a failure
Observation and participation, my favorite teachers
When they beat us in the head with them books, it don't reach us
Whether you breakdance or rock suede Adidas
Or be in the bathroom with your clique, smoking reefer
Then you know they math class ain't important 'less you adding up cash
In multiples, unemployment ain't rewardin'
They may as well teach us extortion
You either get paid or locked up, the principal is like a warden
In a four year sentence, mad niggas never finish
But that doesn't mean I couldn't be a doctor or a dentist
[Chorus: stic.man & Keanna Henson]
They schools can't teach us shit
My people need freedom, we trying to get all we can get
All my high school teachers can suck my dick
Telling me white man lies straight bullshit (bullshit)
They schools ain't teaching us, what we need to know to survive
(Say what, say what)
They schools don't educate, all they teach the people is lies
(Y'all know they don't give a fuck about us)

[Outro: stic.man]
Cuz for real, a mind is a terrible thing to waste
And all y'all high class niggas with y'all nose up
Cuz we droppin' this shit on this joint, fuck y'all
We gon speak for ourselves
Knowhatimsayin'? Cuz see the schools ain't teachin' us nuthin'
They ain't teachin' us nuthin' but how to be slaves and hardworkers
For white people to build up they shit
Make they businesses successful while it's exploitin' us
Knowhatimsayin'? And they ain't teachin' us nuthin' related to
Solvin' our own problems, knowhatimsayin'?
Ain't teachin' us how to get crack out the ghetto
They ain't teachin' us how to stop the police from murdering us
And brutalizing us, they ain't teachin' us how to get our rent paid
Knowhatimsayin'? They ain't teachin' our families how to interact
Better with each other, knowhatimsayin'? They just teachin' us
How to build they shit up, knowhatimsayin'? That's why my niggas
Got a problem with this shit, that's why niggas be droppin' out that
Shit cuz it don't relate, you go to school the fuckin' police
Searchin' you you walkin' in your shit like this a military compound
Knowhatimsayin'? So school don't even relate to us
Until we have some shit where we control the fuckin' school system
Where we reflect how we gon solve our own problems
Them niggas ain't gon relate to school, shit that just how it is
Knowhatimsayin'? And I love education, knowhatimsayin'?
But if education ain't elevatin' me, then you knowhatimsayin' it ain't
Takin' me where I need to go on some bullshit, then fuck education

Until we hit the ground and pass out

Yeah, I’m in charge now
I’m a star and I bought my fucking cast out
I live a very, very, very, wild lifestyle
Heidi and Audrina eat your heart out

I've got so many clothes I keep some in my aunt's house

Soon I'll be the king like Prince Charles' child

20 light bulbs around my table and my dresser

Where’s my fucking clap, where’s my encore?
I walk alone, ‘cause I was born alone
I chirps her just for fun, I never ever call her phone
I leave her in the club, I never ever walk her home

7 Days DJ Premier Remix,Craig David,['hip hop'],"[Intro: Craig David]
Oh no! Look at who they let in the back door
It's been 7 days so let's roll
From the UK to Brooklyn they know
Craig David, Mos Def, and Premo
When we step on the mic we too cold
This remix might fracture your nose

[Verse 1: Mos Def a.k.a. Yaasin Bey]
Now look alive and clap your hands to it
Sexy mamis in the house, shake and dance to it
My hard head's in the place - don't act stupid
It's not Craig and Big Mos can't do it
Get that ass moving, from the front to back to it
Putting that thumping back to it
It's that music to set it off and get the mass movin
Yo tell them 'bout that shorty you came through with

[Craig David]
I met this girl in the subway, walking my way
It must have been my day
Seem like the perfect match for me, so she said to me
""Craig can you give me what I want?
I don't know about you, but I feel so good..""
Girl I can make you feel real hot tonight
So I said baby we can do it in the pouring rain
Do it again do it again till you call my name
Girl you got me insane
Can't maintain the speed in the fast lane
Or we can do it on the telephone, make you moan
Make you groan, all night long, yeah
Or we could do it on the down low, or when you're all alone
[Hook: Craig David](x2)
Cause it was ""ooh"" on Monday
And it was (two!) on Tuesday
And it was ""ooh"" on Wednesday
Gave her what she wanted through to Sunday

Page 2: look at my girl
Come a little closer, gimme a twirl
Put my hands on your body cause you're on my mind
On my mind, think about you all the time
Girl can you give me what I want?
I don't know about you but I feel so hot
I want to love you baby
Do all the little things that I want to do
Or we can do it in the pouring rain
Do it again, do it again, til you call my name
Girl you got me insane
Can't maintain the speed in the fast lane
Or we can do it on the telephone, make you moan
Make you groan, all night long, yeah
Or we could do it on the down low, or when you're all alone

And it was (two!) on Tuesday
And it was ""ooh"" on Wednesday

[Verse 3: Mos Def a.k.a. Yaasin Bey]
Listen, little mamma you can kill all the drama
Girl you know you gonna be here til tomorrow
Probably stay after that, later on and maybe play after that
Get it on and lay straight after that, it's like an natural fact
When you see me you know how to react
It don't matter anywhere that we at it's game time
Move your waistline shook your tail further to the bassline
Moving in the same time like we got the same sign
Peep game, it's pro ball I'm pretty laced to my part
I go off like Biz Mark
Yeah I talk big talk but carry a big staff
And stay down for laying it down your big ass
I'm know I'm wrong, but damn ma I got to tell for true
Tell the world like I tell it to you
That's it's just a mere mention of you
You make me get in the mood
Mos and Craig Dave get in the groove, it's like

Say my name, say my name
Observe how I stake my claim

My own two raise my flame, 'cause dickridin' ain't my thang
I earned what they said I wouldn't
I got it the way they said I couldn't
But now, I'm gettin' it and they whole grill is crooked
Mad 'cause I'm gettin' caked out from my bookings
When y'all was askin' permission, I just stepped up and took it
What!? The kids better buy my rookie card now
'Cause after this year, the price ain't comin' down
And if you got a joint bubblin', then get money now
'Cause in a minute, there's gonna be some real trouble comin' out
Just a warnin', as usual some cats won't heed it
The hard-headed always gotta feel it to believe it
It's a shame they jealous gaze is too short to see it
But when they face hit the cement, they nod in agreement
We could play nice and decent, or dirty like the 7-1 Precinct
Call it a day, or make it a long evenin'
You keep on schemin', man, gimme some more reason
To have the women in your mama's church screamin' ""Lord Jesus!""
Harder than y'all 'cause I'm smarter than y'all
I know that deep down, it's gotta be botherin' y'all
Pay attention, watch Flaco get larger than y'all
Pour your pride on the rocks, and make you swallow it all
The mathematic problem for y'all, it just get harder to solve
Every day that the saga evolve
The do-or-die stay rumblin' and bumblin' hard
And when we move, we ain't got no discussion at all
East Coast's on your neck and you ain't shruggin' it off
Try to bullyfoot and end up stumblin' off

Through stages of wackness, Pharoahe's raps are blazin'
And it amazes, me how you claim thug
But go two-ways without Skytel pagers

Than motorcade police parades through East L.A
More beef then deli's
Thus, what I vent is just... (Uh!)
What you lust to vent, it's irrele'
Huh, hallelujah! Pharoahe Monch'll do ya!
Maintain the same frame of mind — screw ya!
Get the picture, sit ya, seat ya, greet ya with scriptures
I'm equipped to rip ya, reach ya

Coast to coast, we boast to be the most explosive here
Ferocious, the lyrical prognosis
The dosage is leavin' you mentally unfocused here

You're the next contestants on ""Catch-A-Beat-Down""!
Don't be hesitant, sound cracks the sediment
It's evident we medicine for your whole town

All windows is tinted
How you seein' me when I'm in it?

Yo, first I snatched the streets, then I snatched the charts
First I had they ear, now I have they heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start

Seen the Rovers roll up with ribbons
I seen them re-po'd, re-sold, then re-driven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot, I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzling
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'Cause I'ma be that nigga for life
This is not an image, this is God-given
This is hard-livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'

I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6, she was arrested for the sit-ins
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's or to the dealership
That's why I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racism still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club
I done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized 'least three or four times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
It's gon' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl father passed away
So I promised to Mr. Rainey, I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you seen the car I bought her
And you sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side

Get up, I get down, get up, I get down

[Verse 3: J. Ivy]
We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you a part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this that's why I get spiritual
But I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm trying to get us ""us free"" like Cinque
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip, I would never ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed with a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I too dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
'Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out
Take 'em to church
[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get down

[Verse 4: Jay-Z & (Kanye West)]
Who else you know been hot this long?
(Oh yeah, we ain't finished)
Started from nothing but he got this strong
(The Roc is in the building)
Built the Roc from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Pedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special (Wooooo)
Let you tell it, man, I'm falling
Well, somebody must have caught him
'Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em
Number one albums, what I got? Like four of them
More of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
This is Jay, dissing Jay will get you maced
When I start spitting them lyrics niggas get very religious
Six Hail Marys, 'Please Father forgive us'
Young, the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas
The way y'all all follow Jigga
Hov's a living legend and I'll tell you why
Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive"

Ruff Ryder Three, Time for the younger generation to blow

[Verse 1: Jae Hood]
Hey yo, it's Jae Hood bitch respect my bars
The doctors had to piece together your face like a collage
Niggas always talk breezy till the steel come out
And slugs rip through their gums and their grill come out
Motherfuck you and fuck your mans
If I don't clap you in the dome
I'm a leave clips in your diaphragm
I'm the hood prophet
Puff purple instead of chocolate
Stay from around chumps and cowards cause they gossip
And I'm a stay on the corner like stop signs
With a pack of them creamy colored rocks and the Glock nine
When you speaking of the hardest nigga
Bring hood's name up
D Block bitch, we about to have the game chained up
My words too strong, bars too powerful
And your towel can't dry you when the dumdums shower you
Your mad because your garbage and your lyrics is boring
And your whip was made that same year you was born in
[Verse 2: Shiz Lansky]
Listen man, Don't worry how many gats this crook has
Just know I stay strapped like book bags
Bitch is shook ass
You just getting off your porch
And me? I'm just getting off in court
I could make sure your coffin bought
Why would you mention a burner?
There is a difference between rapping and attempting to murder
Talking the shit you living and talking the shit you heard of
You said fuck Larceny?
What is you crazy, bitch?
Before you walk the streets, here's a few safety tips
Watch who you speaking bout and watch who you speaking to
The cats you speaking bout could show you what the heat could do
A respirator is what you'll be breathing through
And you got beef with who that you need toast
The closest you came to beef was meat loaf
When we pose with bats and pea coats
Y'all niggas better be close

[Verse 3: Cam]
To fuck with Cam, y'all bitches better hope and dream
Every gun that I own got a scope and beam
When I approach the scene shake the dice, rook the team
Best bitch on the east coast since Queen
Latifah, buy reefer, fly diva
Ride deeper, four pound bump louder than five speaker
Spit fire, hot lava flow
Don't get it twisted, I'm not one of them Prada ho's
Catch me in Escada clothes, with a lot of dough
That's not mine, it's his
I need a lot more to live
You got to get the king before the kid
How you think a bitch like me afford to live motherfucker?
[Styles]
That's a bad bitch, Shiz you a bad ass nigga, It's the younger generation, killing y'all, Lock, get busy on these niggas

[Verse 4: Lock]
Hey look, I'm trying to sell mad gravy
So I get birds from my crew and make Erykah Badu my ""Bag Lady""
You that crazy? Squeeze, I know you ain't spitting shells
Your hand shake so much it shows up on the Richter scale
I made the huskiest niggas look like they had sickle cell
I don't just sell bricks, dog I got a bitch for sale
So let me find the nigga that hating Lock
No coffin, he get buried in the refrigerator box
God damn, I'm a hot man
I'm telling you straight up, I got my weight up, Jacob
Call my wrists Roxanne
Cause if I wore it in a dark room
You and your man would hate it, I'mma look animated like a cartoon
Bottom line, I'm telling you that you ain't fucking with me
Hard, nobody guards, you want a shot, come and get me
I'm not a sucker, nor is any nigga running with me
And why are y'all balling with wheels if they under fifty
Nigga

[Verse 5: Rockstar]
Lock and blocks the motto
Got more slow than Dr. Zhivago
Same mind state that makes a poem rock in Chicago
But I don't get my gangster from movies
I'm a rockstar, 5 star teles, running with gangsters and groupies
Come through and leave a voice sick
Cause my F-type steers with a joystick
I'm the heart in my era
Listen, I lead an artistic life
Paint pictures with my actions, ain't no margin for error
My innate features, leave niggas dismayed, speechless
And please don't mistake weakness for kindness
I fuck with old timers
So don't make me forget that you real and catch Alzheimers
Motherfucking hoes never I spoil them
Remember, I'm known to break a bitch for reckless eyeballing
The top dog, nigga, I'm the bare truth
You want to get math?
Nigga I'm the square root
The Rockstar
[Verse 6: Cassidy]
I got mean stash
You seen Cass get his thug on
Strip my bitch, we kiss and get our hug on
She what I put drugs on and get my grub on
And dog, when you park your car, put your club on
The next cat I put the snub on
Ima clap the gat till it get too hot, and that's with gloves on
Y'all love drawing, you should go to an art school
I get my club on with the glow in the dark jewels
Trees in my shoes, polo in the dark blues
And I spark tools that the po and the narcs use
Fuckers, y'all stupid or something
What's the point in pulling out your joint if you ain't shootin at nothing
Dude, fronting will get you banged in the face
If you have braces then you know how the banger will taste
I'm near anything pertaining to cake
And Just copped the blue lighting with the rectangular face
Easy

Easy niggas, matter of fact fuck that go hard
Cass' show these niggas how you built
Grab your guns and bust off, my nigga

[Verse 7: Cassidy]
Yeah it's Cassidy bitch, get the name clear
I'm what you lame steer got the game scared
Buy 'caine by the square, sell it by the o
I run through snow like a reindeer
The cool kid, got the coke heads nose red like Rudolf
I grind on the strip so hard I got blue balls
I'd rather knock a q off then get blew off
That's how I stay on my toes like my shoes off
You dudes are soft, really bitches like Ra Paul
When's it's war I move out like U-hauls
I'm a true boss
I send eight balls to the corner
My strip like a pool hall
And I ball like I been in the sport
My trigger finger itching like it got genital warts
Don't play around with him boy (why's that)
Cause Cass is a pain in the ass like hemorrhoids

Power of a cyclone, kill my clone, there can't be two
Coward listen to the way I slay your crew

[Scratching]
*The man of the hour*
*Rip and kill at will*

[Verse 1: Virtuoso]
I've noticed those in power have no alterior motive
Than to kill the inferior with corrosive chemicals
The virtuos locust internally tearing ya with explosives
Whole infirmaries scared of ya cause your throatless
My inferno be searing ya till it's hopeless
I'll incinerate you in my crematory
Innovator what I breathe is gory, disinegrate ya no need for stories
For the police, my flow heat leave no evidence
No sediment I burn books, theres no testament
To the savage thing, that the battle king
Does when I stab and swing, slice Jupiter, slash Saturn's rings
Splinter Venus, then leave the man in the Moon
Wounded in operating rooms being fed by intravenus
Seen as off the radar, my dark laser
Will drop eight stars, and chop holes through quasars
A powerhouse, brute force like rouge elephants
Runaway rhinocerous, cut out they asophagus
Ask most I'm half ghost the last rebel
Smash metal like cinderblocks tied to gas pedals
Skull spit a full clip chest left holy like a pulpit
Head and neck snapped like a bullwhip
Mind is an elaborate, hazardous labyrinth
Filled with ravenous, savages the flow hazarous
Like rapids with white water to fights slaughter
I might order executions, slice quarters with mic cords for retribution
I'll leave your life torn in destitution
We need a resolution, your death is the best solution
My evolution break down your institutional practice
Fascists want my name on the blacklist
Earth's axis, cracked with so much force
When I was born it was torn from the back of Atlas
I smash this track with Mjöllnir
Born chief viking soldier, zero celcius blood, life is colder
Like a polar cap in Nova Scotia
Souls are at rest, as you digest a whole gallon of ammonia
Born stoner mom's smoked lie at my birth
Fell from heaven and was raised as a child of the Earth
Reverse the first curse of the final conflict
Go beyond which famous landmarks Osam hit
Kids armed with Glocks, conference talks lead to concerts
Of nuclear weapons for years to this fate we've been destined
Food for thought too hot for ingestion
Spit wrecking every intestine in your mid-section
Blaze and scathe your place of residence
No trace of evidence
Steal a briefcase from the president
Lace residents, of every race with letters sent
Revealing plots and plans of which every man should be hesitant
Angel of doom, carve his name in the moon
Stop his wife from reproducing when I mangle her womb
Let the anger consume, my mind hang your platoon
For sport I leave your corpse laying strangled in tombs
I'm burying neandrethal man, stab up a mastodon
Ask Saddam who blast the bombs, they run this like decathalons
The masters calm like ghandi but they got me
Cocky, wanna see Virt convert to a nazi?
Pay the holocaust, it's too late to call it off
I throw flows that burn foes like molotov
I burst on the scene, my words are machines
To murder your team, you want dope? I'm serving the fiends
With blood curdling screams, as your team stretch on the rack
Chest has been cracked, no cartilage is left in your back
I'm letting you rap, don't take the fact for granted
It's like my biggest fan is trying ta manage a plan which will do me damage
Your man's fam is, laid bare like damn pandas
If they can't stand us, I make they back slam canvas
Crush! original bum rush ya' lose
We hard granite, the fucking best on the planet
Shine for light years, steaming hot like the amazon
In your nightmares but dissapear when the cameras on
A vampire, there's no captured image
Raps smash your gimmicks till that ass is finished
Boxing with walkmans slap dats
Contact fists with compact discs while vinyl scratches like a bitch
Violent sprays, leave my opponents in states of silent praise
Trapped inside the tyrants maze, fire will fry ya' in my iron cage
My violent lions have been enraged
By violins and sirens that thunder from center stage
Slicing throats, every full moon like a lycanthrope
Life is cloaked in darkness, watch us knife the pope
Or any other faggot catholic bastard
Caught raping children kill them and gas the casket
And throw a match lit, till it burns to ashes
And place the remains in a urn and smash it
I'm the massive, volcanic eruption that happens
When comets are thrusting through the earths crust in-
To its core for internal combustion
Imagine if you heard a discussion, between Stephen Hawking
And Aristotle talking, while comparing models of the universe
That's what it's like to follow when I use a verse
The insight in my mind, is the height of design
My rhymes Frank Lloyd Wright in his prime
So light up a dime
And put it high in the sky, till it looks like the air is filled with fire-flies
I, spark cheebas in the dark fiendish
Bury your crew under the ocean so only the sharks seen us
My heartbeat is, in perfect synchronicity
With whatever machine is circulating electricity
Skill breach ethnicity, will beat ya' physically
Till ya' see god, that's a religious epiphany
So it's no mystery, why we flow so sadistically
Pain twisted me, inside the rain of it's misery
Linguistically my, cancerous shower
Cause a transfer of power, I'm the man of the hour
How I keep time make clocks stop to watch
Leave time a verse behind everytime I rock the spot
I'm the curse, two dead Lee like Brandon and Bruce
MC's kick a verse, then I hand them a noose
Cause either way, once you run out of breath, it's certain death
Believe what I say, what my lungs hold will burst your chest
If knowledge is power then I'm the mental dictator
My pen will rip major arteries, who wanna part of me?!
Hail to the great, I hammer nails in your face
Barbarian ape, I make the sound barrier break
Carry my tape my voice travel on nuclear transportation
Any rapper riding my style becomes a chronic cancer patient
My corrugated sabre blade is sharp as razors
All invaders of my dark chambers hearts are in danger
I throw a coat hanger down your throat hang you heartless
Stiff as starch is, in a state of catharisis
Fiberglass frames cry plastic mucus splinters
As your crimson blood spills in the massachusetts winter
Throwing your staff in glowing baths of petroleum gas
Photos I flash blow you in half and now your smoldering ash
The essence of eloquence, I'm dominant, no resistance for a pittance
I'll stop your portion of our co-existence
I strike the paltry, the holy taliban and papacy
Your ballsy, my blade leave you spade for trying to rap with me
Slash vas deferens in half past impotence
Cowards are incompetent my powers are omnipotent!

Ego-Tripping there may be a reason,Nikki Giovanni,['country'],"I was born in the Congo
I walked to the Fertile Crescent and built
The Sphinx
I designed a pyramid so tough that a star
That only glows every one hundred years falls
Into the center giving divine perfect light
I am bad

I sat on the throne
Drinking nectar with Allah
I got hot and sent an ice age to Europe
To cool my thirst
My oldest daughter is Nefertiti
The tears from my birth pains
Created the Nile
I am a beautiful woman

I gazed on the forest and burned
Out the Sahara desert
With a packet of goat's meat
And a change of clothes
I crossed it in two hours
I am a gazelle so swift
So swift you can't catch me
For a birthday present when he was three
I gave my son Hannibal an elephant
He gave me Rome for mother's day
My strength flows ever on

My son Noah built New/Ark and
I stood proudly at the helm
As we sailed on a soft summer day
I turned myself into myself and was
Jesus
Men intone my loving name
All praises All praises
I am the one who would save

I sowed diamonds in my back yard
My bowels deliver uranium
The filings from my fingernails are
Semi-precious jewels
On a trip north
I caught a cold and blew
My nose giving oil to the Arab world
I am so hip even my errors are correct
I sailed west to reach east and had to round off
The earth as I went
The hair from my head thinned and gold was laid
Across three continents
I am so perfect so divine so ethereal so surreal
I cannot be comprehended except by my permission

I mean...I...can fly
Like a bird in the sky"

Well, I stand up next to a mountain

She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long I'd probably break down and cry

She's got eyes of the bluest skies

Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place

And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

Dear Diary,Joe Budden,['hip hop'],"[Intro: Sample]
It's five o'clock, I'm just getting home
Roaming on my own
What can I tell her
That she might understand?

[Verse]
The soundtrack to my life is like CNN first shit
Images like CNN but worse shit
I would down the whole Pinot Gris
But I'd see the group home without the Primo beats
And it hurts my soul
I'm a warrior so though the odds is against a nigga, Dirk gon' choke
Some people confide in the person that they sleep with
I've learned there's no such thing as a secret (oh)
I can't describe the feeling I get
You was riding shotgun, I was wheeling the whip
Shit, I even let you rock out, being Bill Belichick
Tapin' from the sidelines, stealin' my shit
But dawg, you was like a mini me, mocked me, envied me
Turns out you was blowin' hot air, Kenny G
But you was cool, accepted you instantly
Not a groupie but you had a few tendencies
And though we share a few memories
Couple wrong turns'll turn a friend to an enemy
See, phony people like phony people
Even you could be mistaken if you phone these people, look
When you invite the nerds to the cool table
Shit is bound to break up like a pool table
So wack dudes'll start feeling like the shit
And you thinkin' it's you, it's really where you sit
Or maybe you was neglected
'Cause when you take the front down and strip a nigga naked, he's dying to be accepted (oh)
I did that, just the way you was
Now you a stranger, nothing like the way you was
But uh, you not real, you not Rachel
You not Worm, you not Dill, shit, you not chill
I thought you had some couth
Fuck the fake shit, I'm really feel that you tryna screw me
And you a little smarter than the average dude
So it took a nigga just a little longer to see
They tried to warn me, fought with my girl erry night about you
Shit only hurts cause she was right about you

She run around wanting to shoot you the fair one
I keep telling her ""chill, I don't care none""
I got another side I never showed to you
The side where everybody is disposable
See, relationships are never a threat
Cause I'll erase the history and act like we never met
Become done giving a fuck and done calling
I got your e-mail, I was done way before then (oh)

Dear Diary, I don't wanna keep shit inside of me
I'd rather just speak to you privately
Maybe it's my mood, as far as I can see
There's really no point in having this guy with me

Change from the days of us getting in your truck
It's bigger than one song, it's bigger than a buck
It's bigger than me, bigger than buck
Bigger than voodoo, its bigger than luck, shit, it's bigger than us

I always call niggas fools for wanting to learn the hard way (when)
When I'm really the fool for tryna teach 'em
When the blinds leading the blind you can't reach 'em
If niggas ain't as hungry as you then why feed 'em?
Niggas ain't tryna be lead then why lead 'em?
Having big problems with your dogs, why breed em?
I'll keep my part up, keep my guard up
Was like Thundercats but changed faster than Cheetara
This a small part of a larger issue
Sometimes acceptance is so hard to get to
But we all equal, no one lower or above me
I love my team just as much as they love me
If not more
If I turn the knob we all going through the door, I ain't coming back for y'all
The whole crew feel the same as me
How could you ignore something so plain to see?
I'm being ig'nant, that get on my nerves every minute
What's plain to some is really Burberry printed

Being so real sometimes is a slow kill
We was one squad, you broke out like Mike Schofield
I want fillet mignon, you want oatmeal
Add up our differences equals up to no meal
No mills, yup, no deal, why you gotta chase sh*t
To know it's no thrills, for real

A nigga still beefin' with his baby momma (BUT!)
Only thing my baby ain't a baby no more
Hit her on MySpace, maybe she ain't shady no more
Sent old girl a message, no reply but she read it
Some things are so embedded and our heads is
Looking for O's but get X's, dealing wit ya exes
I was one long line away from the Tetris
She sent me the L, that sent me to hell
To the point where I’m denied my son
I don't see him, don't talk to him, I don't greet him, don't walk wit' him
But I pay for him like he's an object
No matter how right I am, in court I can't object
Dear Diary, how could she deny me?
How she go to bed without it fucking with her psyche?
Is she wrong using him so I can come back? (or)
Am I wrong for wishing I could get my cum back?
Looking for sun, all I see is the hail
How I'm gon' trust? All I see is betrayal
It's like they keep trying more and more to subdue me
And only you understand, signed by yours truly"

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Yellow Benz with a spoiler kit, with my spoiled lil' chick
Yellow diamonds on my neck and wrist, match this yellow bitch
She a trip, shawty, she the shit, she know she the shit
If you don't buy her what she want then she throw a fit
She a bitch, shawty, mean as shit but she super thick
And she act silly like a kid, give her candy stick
She a pit, make her flip a brick, make her sick a chick
Since a jit, I've been slangin' dick, Gucci Mane the shit (Burr)
I met a girl name Susie, I let her join my group
I know she not a groupie, so I let her in my coupe
I stashed her in my fender wall and stashed her in my tire
Susie is a money maker but that bitch a liar
Susie roll in '08 'Rari but that girl on fire
Pull us over Candler Road, said she had some priors
Ten bricks in my car, shawty singing like Mariah
Singing like the choir, better yet singing like Mya (Bitch)
[Verse 2: Ester Dean]
Well, my name is Susie and Gucci think I love him
That sucka think I'm loyal but I fucks with all the hustlas
I be wit' all the ballas, I be at all the spots
I might be in yo' kitchen, nigga, cooking with yo' pots

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Ester Dean]
I think I love her
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I think I love her
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I know I love her
Nigga, you don't love me

Nigga, you don't love me
I know I love her
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I think I love her

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Told my boy, man, Polow Da Don
I think I love this girl, man, huh, why?
She sweet but keep kief, she stains her Irene
Two piece, she dime piece and jeans, they dead meat
She sweet, she so deep, she read with good teeth
Two jobs, she get cheese, her dates, are my treat
How neat, she loves to eat, we eat bon appétit
We feed, she's so neat and like me, she so neat
[Verse 4: Ester Dean]
Nigga, always talk but I run the block
This bitch is so hot, my clique, I close shop
My wrist froze with rocks, I cop all the drops
Unfold all the knots, expose the have-nots
My hoes pose with pot like young Goldilocks
We got white bulging rocks, Ziploc stocks to cop
We never closin' shop, we hot, steaming hot
I'm Susie Sarah plot, a click clack, p-pop-pop

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Ester Dean]
I think I love her
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I think I love her
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I know I love her
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me
I know I love her
Nigga, you don't love me
Nigga, you don't love me

Suicide it's a suicide, biddy bye bye
Suicide it's a suicide
Suicide it's a suicide, biddy bye bye
Suicide it's a suicide

[Verse 1: Frukwan/The Gatekeeper]
So you wanna die, commit suicide
Dial 1-800-Cyanide line
Far as life, yo, it ain't worth it
Put a rope around your neck and jerk it
The trick didn't work
Your life was fucked up from the first day of birth
After watching Jackie Gleason, walk into a precinct
Gun down the captain for no fucking reason
And get some LSD or a drink from the bar
Get behind your wheel and crash the car
Like Desert Storm, got bombs for the war
Confront an alligator, let it eat ya raw
Back to the function, riding the caboose to hell
BZZZZZT touched the third rail
You fucked up chicken, now you just got fried
Cause it's a suicide
[Chorus: KRS-One]
Suicide it's a suicide, biddy bye bye
Suicide it's a suicide
Suicide it's a suicide, biddy bye bye
Suicide it's a suicide

[Verse 2: Too Poetic/The Grym Reaper]
Hey, you, little rich kid, what's your beef?
Come and tell the Grym Reaper all of your grief
You asked for a Benz and you only got a Jeep
Your pop's got ends, but yo, he's mad cheap
Maybe you're a bastard child, you think
Mom and Dad are white and you're dark as ink
Maybe you're Sicilian with a tan
But you hate lasagna and the pizza man
Now you stand on the Gravedigga plot and
You're singing the blues about the rough life you've got
(Not!) You don't wanna live no more
I guess you're really ready for the graveyard tour
When you get home, just seal up your windows and you doors
Turn your oven on high for about four hours
Light you a blunt, kiss your ass goodbye
You gassed yourself, 'cause it's a suicide

[Chorus: KRS-One]
Suicide it's a suicide, biddy bye bye
Suicide it's a suicide
Suicide it's a suicide, biddy bye bye
Suicide it's a suicide
[Interlude: Scott (the Moleman) Harding]
Yep, I've said it before and I'll say it again
Life moves pretty fast
If you don't stop and look around every once in a while
You could miss it

[Verse 3: The RZArector]
Six fucking devils stepped up playing brave god
Had the fucking nerve to try and enter my graveyard
I'm the Rzarector, be my sacrifice
Commit suicide and I'll bring you back to life
The first was convinced, stuck a water hose in his mouth
At full blast so his head can explode
Second one said, ""Hmmmm, that's good but I can top it!""
Put a axe up to his head and then he chopped it
Blood shot out in every direction
The rest didn't know what to do, I made suggestions
Put a slug in your mug; overdose on a drug
Wet your hand, stick a knife in the plug
Or be like Richard Pryor, set your balls on fire
Better yet, go hang yourself with a barbed wire
Three and Four fell deep into the spell and
Ran to the zoo, locked themselves in the lion's den
Number Five said, ""It ain't worth being alive!""
Smoked a dust joint, mixed it with cyanide
The only one who escaped was Number Six
He went home, sat in the tub, and slit his wrists
Yeah, more graves to dig, goodbye
There's no need to cry... 'cause we all die"

Relaxation,Fashawn,['hip hop'],"[Produced by J. Cole]

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
It’s ya nigga, deep thinker, big drinker
Late night, with ya wife in ya crib sneaker
When you out of town, and you not around
Turn your ass over like a nigga stepped out of bounds
Crowd around young’n
I got ammo and a lot of rounds coming
Up in the streets where you not allowed, runnin’
Got the songs bitches ride around hummin’
And the niggas stay thumpin’
And the hater’s hate pumpin’
Got the 808′s bumpin’
So the trunks stay thumpin’
And the nigga get high only on occasion and
My mind too wild
Damn thought weed supposed to calm you down
But I’m so high I could palm two clouds
Boy look, these niggas quote my lines like the Lord’s book
You niggas less rhymes more hooks
More bucks but less love
You hear them drums, Questlove
No Roots, I’m so truth
I used to rock sidelines like a coach suit
Had to look at all them loafers, yeah them boat shoes
Now I’m in the game but I won't boast to you dummy
Remember niggas had short jokes for my money
Toast to the honeys, money and the liquor
And bitch I don’t sound like any other nigga
With my finger on the trigger
I burn rappers like Henny on the liver
Grant death wishes like a genie I’m a killer
Lord giveth and he taketh like an Indian giver
Hard to keep jimmy in zipper
When you got them bad Aunt Vivians with ya
Remy and weed, I got em on Pluto
I prefer Henny but the hoes like Nuvo
[Verse 2: Fashawn]
Check, every time a nigga roll
Old school whips and it’s sitting on vogues
Hoes on me when I enter the door
If a nigga wanna trip, good grip on the chrome
Empty out a clip from the fifth then I’m gone
Twist up a spliff, get a fifth of Patron
Hate a chick who just talk shit on the phone
Baby I’m tryna stick, give ya dicks to ya dome, shit
If I was you nigga I would hate him
Hot August nights I’m out there in Vegas
Stuntin' til time, had that patience
Now it’s big faces, fly vacations
Alias Shawn Stacks
Miss shows, never call back
Blowin’ Dro sippin' tall cats
On the low had to crawl back
Niggas wonder if it’s all raps
Or it’s all facts

[Verse 3: Omen]
As I step in the door like Fe fi foe
With the heat like flow and the beat typo
Better rewrite yo, get your rhyming straight
Get murked plus 8 like Jon and Kate
I mean it’s time for the face off
Hit the corner like an 8 ball
Man I concentrate like Adolf
No time for a hater, get a day job
Me on the mind you ain't even on the radar
Love her brain but I never been a fiend for her silly ways
So I’m tryna get the cream til I’m silly paid
Couldn’t put her on the team, every week another reason
To scheme like Billy Mays
Gotta grind gotta focus
Gotta shine through the minds of the blind, lot of hopeless
Never confined to the rhymes that I’ve chosen
Omen, a sign of the times, gotta quote this"

I-I-I say that shit again, I said it once before
I just, I just, I just, I just want it all
I glisten and shine with misses' fine model chick, big behind
Bad enough to skip the line but to me she just a nine
I hop up out that double-0, you can call me Mr. Bond
Bitch, I am a monster, I belong in District 9

[Refrain]
Catch me in my office, office, doing business
Fuck you doing? Bullshitting

I get all the eyes when I step inside and
They all arise when I am arrivin'
Bring out the Rose, Nuvo, Ciroc and
Bring out the OJ like Johnny Cochran
I guess they on son, cause my neck look like horizon
Just a million people behind me and I don't have Verizon

Man, I'm chillin with my niggas nigga, and a couple cool bitches
Fuck you doin'? Bullshittin'

By the time y'all over here, I'm prolly over there
And by the time you riding what I'm riding on I'm in the air
No wonder why my mind is so cloudy, I'm drowsy
My frequent flier miles is in the thousies, I'm outtie

Somewhere chilling in Maui, swimming with the scuba fishes
Fuck you doing? Bullshitting

Gone and roll that weed yea I think it's time to spark it
Cause I be running through them trees niggas call me Tarzan

Well, what do you know? The Di-Dawg is first up to bat
No batteries included, and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move-fakin'
Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe, so
Sleep if you want, Nytol will help you get your Z's, troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some; short, dark, and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fumin', I've had it up to here
My days of payin' dues are over, acknowledge me as in there

East coast stompin', rippin', and rompin'

And wow-how-now-wow, how now, Brown cow?
We're ill 'til the skill gets down for the flex, next!

From radio, to the video, to Arsenio
Tell me, yo; what's the scenario?

(True, blue!) Scooby Doo, whoopie doo
Scenarios, radios, rates more than four
Scores for the s'mores that smother dance floors
Now I go for mine, shades of sea shore
Ship-shape, crushed grapes, apes that play tapes
Papes make drakes baked for the wakes
Of an (L-ah-!), an (-eader!), simply just a leader
Base in the space means peace, see ya later
Later (Later!) Later, alligator
Pop blows the weasel and the urge to inflate her
So, yo, the D, what! The O
Incorporated I-N-C into a flow
Funk flipped, flat back, first this, foul, fight, fight, fight, laugh
Yo, how'd that sound? (Ooooh!)

It's a Leader-Quest mission and we got the goods here (Here!)
Never on the left, 'cause my right's my good ear (Ear!)
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime, so I ain't no (criminal!)
I love my young nation, groovy sensation
No time for hibernation, only elation
Don't ever try to test the water, little kid
Yo, Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell 'em what I did—
—I heard you rushed and rushed (and attacked!)
Then they rebuked and you (had to smack!)
Causin' rambunction throughout the sphere
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear—
—You know I did it
So don't violate or you'll get violated
The hip-hop sound is well agitated
Won't ever waste no time on a played out ego
So here's Busta Rhymes with the scenario:

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes & All]
Watch; as I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come, rewind
Powerful impact (Boom!) from the cannon!
Not braggin', tryna read my mind, just imagine
Vo-cab-u-lary's necessary, when diggin' into my library
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
Eatin' Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh
Unh! Unh! Unh! All over the track, man
Unh, pardon me, unh! As I come back!
As I did it, yo, I had to beg your pardon
When I travel through the town, I roll with the squadron
Rawr! Rawr! Like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers 'cause your pants are saggin'
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban
And have you smellin' rank like some old, stale urine
Chickity Choco, the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel, buttcheeks, they were kickin'
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme
The rhythm is in sync (Unh!), the rhymes are on time (Time!)
Rippin' up the sound just like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario
Yeah, my man, mothafucka!

[Verse]
My name is L, and I'm from a part of town where clowns
Get beat down and all you hear is gunshot sounds
On 139 and Lenox Ave. there's a big park
And if you're soft, don't go through it when it gets dark
'Cause at nighttime niggas try to tax
They're sneakier than alley cats
That's why I carry gats
Yo, I'm a muthafuckin' fugitive
Buckwild and foul is the lifestyle that I choose to live
Because to me it's all about a buck
I used to have a partner in crime by the name of Chuck
We stormed the city, shooting shit up like Frank Nitti
We robbed kids and split the dough 50/50
One day we stuck a dice game on the ave. and split the cash
Then I murdered his ass and took his half
Because I'm all about ends and skins
When you got those, you don't need no muthafuckin' friends
If I catch you on a late night, black, you're getting stuck, jack
My moms told me to get a job, fuck that
Ayo, picture me getting a job
Taking orders from Bob, selling corn on the cob
Yo, how the hell I'mma make ends meet
Making about 120 dollars a week
Man, I'd rather do another hit
I want clean clothes, mean hoes and all that other shit
Yo, I admit, I'm a sucker
A low down, dirty, sneaky, double-crossin' connivin' muthafucka
Breaking in cribs with a crowbar
I wasn't poor, I was po' - I couldn't afford the 'o-r'
I used to wait until it gets dark
And tell a nigga to strip, I wanna see some birthmarks
Like a ninja, dressed in black with a ski mask
I take all the funds, then I run down the street fast
I vicked this nigga named Eugene, took his brand new ring
'Cause sticking up's an everyday routine
Once I was cruising in a beat-up ride
Saw this nigga named Clyde
And snuck up on him from the blind side
I told him, ""Give up the dough, before you get smoked
Oh you're broke? *gunshots*
Now you're dead broke""
The Big L was called crazy
A top-notch crook snatching pocketbooks from old ladies
I don't care, I'll do anything to get a buck
Even rob a Miller truck, 'cause I don't give a fuck
Some say I'm ruthless, some say I'm grim
Once a burglar broke into my house and I robbed him
Plenty and many brains I bust
'Cause I was livin' the lifestyle of the poor and dangerous

So comfortable at the top I hopped on a plane and claimed Everest
You might as well say the boy is Himalayan
I rent my rooms on the moon, Mr. Smith is comin' soon
The angels feedin' me cereal with a silver spoon
My hair line is Craig Smith Airlines
A ride from Kansas City to LA is as long as a fan line
I'm high as '08 gas prices, my votes are
Twice as high as Obama's and I ain't gotta ask nice
I'm high as Tech's tour bus, the light skinned one
So if you're lookin' for me dog look up and try to find the sun
[Hook]
I'm in the air
High in the air


[Verse 2: Nesto]
Yeah, don't mean to brag but I froze my piece
And I'm gettin' higher then a nose bleed seat
Don't bring her to my session, if your ho sees me
She'll drop dead in the studio like ODB
Yeah, it's the owner and I'm very cool
Plus this weed keep me higher than an air balloon
Copy cat, like what I'm wearing dude?
I'm so fly, I walk around with a parachute
And even rappers lie too
But I'm the only human with an astronaut suit
See yo entire verse? Say that your iron squirt
When you only shootin' in the air like fireworks (Pussy)
If suckers still on that hatin' shit
I'll stuff 'em in a bag like potato chips
I'll bend they ass up like a paper clip
Tech, sign me and see how quick your paper flip

[Hook]
I'm in the air
High in the air
I'm in the air
High in the air
[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I ain't gotta introduce myself, y'all know what it is
Why call me underground when I rock the stars?
And even they can't see me with a pair of binoculars
My hip-hoppin' gave a good side swipe to Mars
One-Third an extinction hit, which left the limelight ajar
You want your scripts to fly, not in my solar system
Cause I'll dismiss 'em like they wished to die
Mack mother-nature and I ripped her, why?
Civilian ladies love me, so bro, excuse her while she kiss the sky
Call me master more exalted than a priest, a pastor
Blasphemy have me blast fags fast with Magma
In the air like Dancer and Dasher
High in the sky, above all mountains off in Alaska
Higher than a million heroin hits if it'll last ya
Super-Celestial when everyone's stuck off in the pasture
The wack, I will cast ya down below those who get caught up in my rapture
Don't be callin' me ""dog"" cause I want you to say it backwards

[Hook]
I'm in the air
High in the air
I'm in the air
High in the air
I'm in the air
High in the air
I'm in the air
High in the air
[Outro: Tech N9ne]
Your first lesson for today man
That was it, Sickology 101
Yaddada mean
Craig Smith, Nesto, Tech Nina nigga
In the air, motherfucker
Sound like a bird flying around
Yeah, Wyshmaster on the track
We out this bitch"
