Duel of the Iron Mic,GZA,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Oh, mad one, we see your trap
You can never escape your fate
Submit with honor to a duel with my son
I agree

I see you're using an old style
I wondered where you'd learned it from
You know very well, it's yours too
Heh, I had forgotten, will you show me?
And what have you come for?
You come here, since you're so interested - fight me

[Verse 1: GZA]
Yo, picture bloodbaths in elevator shafts
Like these murderous rhymes tight from genuine craft
Check the print, it's where veterans spark the letterings
Slow-moving MCs is waiting for the editing
The liquid soluble that made up the chemistry
A gaseous element, that burned down your ministry
Herbal vapors and biblical papers
Smoking Exodus, every square yard is plush
Fuck the screw-faced photo sessions, facial expression
Leaves impression, try to keep a shark nigga guessing
Give crazy shouts, son, here's the outcome
Cut across the semi-gloss rhymes you floss
Shit is outdated, just like neckloads of Sterlings
Suede-fronts, bell-bottoms, and tri-colored Shearlings
I ain't particular, I bang like vehicular homicides
On July 4th, from Bed-Stuy
Where money don't grow on trees and there's thieving MC's
Who cut-throat to rake leaves
They can't breathe, blood splash, rushing fast
Like running rivers, I be that whiskey in your liver
[Hook: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Duel of the Iron Mic!
It's the fifty-two fatal strikes!

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
This is not a '85 affair made clear
When the Gods get on to perform storms blew up
Wu's up, causing the crowd to self-destruct
Killer Beez are stinging something while I reveal
Science that's heavily guarded by the culprit
Bombing your barracks with aerodynamic
Swordplay, poison darts by the doorway
Minds that's laced with explosive doses
Damaging lyrical launcher
Lunge at the youthful offender then injure
Any contender, testing the murderous Master
Could lead to disaster, dynamite thoughts
Explode through your barrier, rips the retina
Who can withstand the astonishing punishing
Stings to the sternum, shocked in the Hip Hop livestock
Seeking for a serum to cure 'em

[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
Adults kill for drugs plus the young bucks bust
Ducking handcuffs, throats get cut when dough rush
Out of town foes look shook but still pose
We move like real pros through the streets we stroll
Bullet holes lace the windows in one-six-oh
So control the avenues that's the dream that's sold
Building lobbies are graveyards for small-timers
Bitches caught in airports, keys in they vaginas
No peace, yo the police mad corrupt
You get bagged up, depending if you're passing the cut
Plus shorty's not a shorty no more, he's living heartless
Regardless of the charges, claims to be the hardest
Individual, critical thoughts, criminal-minded
Blinded by illusion, finding it confusing
[Hook: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Duel of the Iron Mic!
It's the fifty-two fatal strikes!
Duel of the Iron Mic!
It's the fifty-two fatal strikes!

[Outro]
Huh, Master, he must be dreaming, heh
Well, if he is dreaming then he must be asleep
And if he's asleep, then I will wake him up!

At the height of their fame and glory, they turned on one another
Each struggling in vain for ultimate supremacy
In the passion and depth of their struggle
The very art that had raised them to such Olympian heights was lost
Their techniques vanished"
Lets Get This Paper,Rich Boy,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Yeah, yeah, hey, hey hey

[Verse 1]
R.I.P. Pooh Bear, that's my dead homie
Fuck that other shit, hey, let's get this bread homie
Remember when they could catch a charge down in Atlanta
They underestimate me cause I'm comin' from Alabama
Martin Lee Anderson he ain't even have a chance
They beat him in that boot camp 'til he died in that ambulance
That boy was only fifteen years old, fuck what they say he did
So tell me how I'm 'posed to feel when police killin' kids?
And then we can't get a job, ridin' we get them pounds
If it ain't that coke then we get that 'dro and break it down
See that ice, the dope man paradise
Boy better think twice, that dope have you doin' life
They tore down the projects, so where we gon' move next?
They takin' them food stamps, they stop government checks
Hey, money my motivator, my mouth my money maker
Naw I don't see them haters, so let's go get this paper

[Bridge 1]
Yeah when you look at us just think about it, we don't own nothin'
If we get money, we got a lil' few dollars, but our whole family tore up nigga
You gettin' money for the people in ya family that ain't got nothin'
When it's all said and done, what do you own? You don't own nothin', you
Don't own you... The nigga playin' basketball, he don't own that jersey, he can't
Even be in a commercial wit' his name on the back, so when it's really all
Said and done, what did you do this for? What difference did you make?
[Verse 2]
You see how the world changin'? Yeah, they left Saddam hangin'
Wish they just kill 'em all so now the Middle East they bangin'
Preachers in that pulpit, say they teach that bullshit
So know how we know it's bullshit? Same niggas I went to school wit'
Grabbin' on yo' nuts and disrespectin' get you merked
Them young niggas got pistol grips, they been about they killin' shit
But they all some hypocrites, haters they won't let me be
When I come up to them gates, I hope you say you heard of me
Now Kendrix Curtis gone, them angels took him home
They gave my brother ten years, the system did him wrong
Now we convicted felons, because they caught us sellin'
And nine times out of ten yo' friend the one who tellin'

Money my motivator, my mouth my money maker

Everyday for some bullshit! Huh nigga? What yo' bank account say nigga?
Oh that's all? Haha!
[Verse 3]
They shippin' them boys off, they fightin' in Iraq
It's soldiers in that war that ain't never gon' make it back
Niggas this the battlefield, fake niggas scream keep it real
Yeah yeah, rob, steal, anything to pay them bills
Hey nigga times harder, so we grind harder
We takin' chances wit' that coke comin' 'cross that water
Tryin' to get up out this ghetto life ain't gotta be this way
Them pigs they came and kicked my mama do' in yesterday
I prayed a thousand nights, I did a hundred crimes
And now I'm beggin' Lord that you don't let me down this time
Money my motivator, my mouth my money maker
No I don't see them haters, so let's go get this paper

[Bridge 3 - Rich Boy]
Our Father who art in Heaven, Please Lord forgive me for that crack

If you want a doo doo rhyme, then come see me
I've got the savoir faire with the unique rhymin'
I keep it on and on, it's never quitting time and
Strictly handheld is the style I go
Never rock the mic with the pantyhose
I strap on my ear goggles and I'm ready to go
‘Cause at the boards is the man, they call the Mario
You pull up at the function and you know I Kojak
To all the party people that are on my Bozac

And on the microphone, I come correct
Timing like a clock when I rock the hip-hop
Top notch is my stock on the soapbox
I've got more rhymes than I've got gray hairs
And that's a lot because I've got my share (oohh, weee)
I've got a hole in my head and there's no one to fix it
I gotta straighten my thoughts
I'm thinking too much (yeah) sick shit
Everyone just takes and takes, takes, takes, takes
I'll have to step back, I gotta contemplate
Well, I'm like Lee Perry, I'm very on
Rock the microphone, and then I'm gone
I'm like Vaughn Bode, I'm a Cheech Wizard

MCA, come and rock the sure shot

[Verse 3: Mike D, Ad-Rock, MCA]
I want to say a little something that's long overdue
The disrespect to women has got to be through
To all the mothers and the sisters and the wives and friends
I want to offer my love and respect to the end
Well, you say I'm twenty-something and I should be slacking
But I'm working harder than ever and you could call it macking
So I'm supposed to sit upon my couch just watching my TV
I'm still listening to wax, I'm not using the CD
Well, I'm that kid in the corner
All fucked up and I wanna so I'm gonna (yeah)
Take a piece of the pie, why not, I'm not quittin'
Think I'm-a change up my style just to fit in

I use a bullshit mic that's made out of plastic
To send my rhymes out to all the nations
Like Ma Bell, I got the ill communication

The Plan,J. Cole,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
One time for the plan
Straight to the top, I got the power in my hands
Live for the moment, be hot
Act like you want it, reach high
Now we ain't known, but we try
Now holla back and reply

[Verse 1]
Feel like I lived for this moment
I see it in their eyes, them other guys don't want it
My style they can crown it, but can't dethrone it
I was aiming for the top and now I I I'm on it
What a powerful performance
I was in my zone, send flowers for opponents
Tell 'em ""Get well soon""
Cause I ain't in the mood
So if you read that word backwards then it should spell 'doom'
I'm on fire, y'all can inhale fumes, as I zoom by ya
As you thinking, 'Who's higher?'
Fueled by a desire you should admire
That's why I'm what they aspire to be 'fore they retire
A livin' legend, with God givin' blessings
And game so cold they probably watching this in Heaven
Expecting the incredible, so baby watch me do that
And make the Angels say 'Lord, how he do that?'

One time for the plan

Now holla back and reply

[Verse 2]
A champion's mentality
And so I'm scoring, ignoring the fact you're fouling me
And one, where I go you can't come
I was schooling your father boy, that make you my grandson
I've been around the block twice, now my shot nice
No referee but best believe out here I got stripes
Now that they finally consider me a legit scorer
Would you believe I started off as a bench-warmer?
Have me feelin' like Master Splinter
Now the haters and commentators say 'there's a winner'
Hey, hard work pay off, now I don't take a day off
I rest not, I guess that's why your best shot? Way off
These are the things that dreams are made of
The sweep, no time for sleep, when you're elite
If what you reap is what you sow, then what was you expecting?
Expect to come in second
While I become a legend
[Hook]
One time for the plan
Straight to the top, I got the power in my hands
Live for the moment, be hot

Now we ain't known, but we try

Why don't you reach for the sky?
You don't believe you can fly?
I guess I'll see you when you get here

Why don't you reach for the sky?
You don't believe you can fly?
I guess I'll see you when you get here

Suckas,Jay Electronica,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
This goes out to those that choose to use
Disrespectful views
On the game of H-i
P-H-o-p, we terrorizing you misfits
These wack emcees got the game twisted
We don't give a fuck about your rings or your chains
Your four-dot six Range
Or Frankie B jeans
I came in the game muhfucka, it's death to the bling
Jay Elect reign supreme over everything
Meet the heavenly man, mics in my hand I rip 'em
Brrrr-ha stick 'em ha-ha-ha stick 'em
Wack rappers we vick 'em
And leave 'em for dead
For spitting that wack shit
That they see in they head
Mufucka'
A new beginning - Forever

[Verse 2]
The last dragon, carrying weight like Oprah
Redeemer of Abnner Louima and Sankofa
I mash out more posses than Billy and Fame
Sucka emcees rock ice but they really in flames
Eighty-five think they free but they really in chains
Talking that big willie looking silly and strange
Earthquakes and rain, hail, snow, locusts and bees
All of the above is caused by the dopest emcees
Back day I used to rock Adidas open with Lees
Windmill on the cardboard and close with the freeze
Silly suckas
[Verse 3]
It's War with The Dragon, visit your day see god
Spar with a passion, this is your day swing hard
As I spark your imagi-nation it may seem odd
This world is crazy hard, but it made me god
Rock with the blastmaster of rock with a rap masters
The Notorious BIG and 2Pac were the last pastors
I gotta grab the, torch and lead the flock to the pastures
Return of the Jedi, who stud-ied under the master
Jakes wanna creep me, the eighth beast seeks to defeat me
I'm feelin leapy, Homeland Security breechy
They can't compete B, my Third Eye vision is 3D
Seeing what Maussan couldn't civilize in the BC
Rap is a misfit, a cheap trick covered with lipstick
Yappin about freaknik, and plattin about deep-dish
War with The Dragon, I'm here to clash with the beast
Harass the Police, in the process of establishing peace
Forever!"
Love You More,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Still love me? Take this
You ready? One, two, three!

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me and I love you more

[Verse 1]
It's sick, but who could ever predict we'd be doin' the same shit?
We say we do it for our baby, but we don't
We do it for us, it's lust 'cause neither one
Of us trust each other, so we fuck till we bust
And we cuss each other out, we know what it's about, shout
Till I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
Fist fight 'til we turn this mother out
Then apologize after, laughter, pain
It's insane, we're back in the same chapter again
And it's sad, but it's true, when I'm layin' here with you
There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say or ever do 'cause—
[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad, but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me and I love you more

[Verse 2]
'Cause I hate you, do you hate me?
Good, 'cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry
It makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
On the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you
You fuck other people and I fuck other people
You're a slut, but I'm equal, I'm a mutt, we're both evil
In our ways, but neither one of us would ever admit it
'Cause one of us would have one up on the other, so forget it
We can make accusations, people spread rumors
But they ain't got proof, till they do it's just the two of us
It's you and me, 'cause any chick can say that she's screwin' me
But you gotta believe me to a degree 'cause true indeed
If you didn't, I wouldn't be hittin' — yeah, I would
'Cause the sex is too damn good, if I ran who would I run to
That would be this soft and warm?
So it's off and on, usually more off than on
But at least we know that we share this common bond
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on
I hope the only reason that I cope is 'cause of that fact
And plus, I can bust in that, and that's why—
[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me and I love you more

[Verse 3]
I can never understand it, that's why I don't try
From junior high until we both die, it's silly
Oh, why must we try? Is it really so rough
That we must always call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff?
Try to pull each other's legs until the other begs
We're lyin' to ourselves, that's the beauty of it, yeah
'Cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fightin'
All we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night
And it's clear it ain't gonna change, it's pent-up rage
We both have, we both feel like we've been upstaged
By someone else, we've both been someone else's
""Someone else,"" problem is neither one wants help
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed
Our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix
And it hurts 'cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time
On every song, every lyric in every rhyme
All the hoopla, all of the whoopty-woo
What you put me through, fuckin' whoopty-do
But I won't be made a fool of, if this is true love
You wouldn't do what you did last time, you wouldn't screw up
This time, 'cause this time, girl, I'm tellin' you what
You do it again, I'm fuckin' you up no matter what
[Bridge]
No matter what you say, or what you do
I'mma hunt you down till I find you
No matter where you run, I'll be right there
Right behind you in your nightmares
So I brought you the flowers and the candy
All the times that you threw it back at me
Told me you hate me, you gon' hate me more
When you find out you can't escape me, whore

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more"

Oh Bo Studio,Bo Burnham,['pop'],"[Intro]
I feel like hip hop
Used to be a voice for the voiceless
And now it's become, at least in the mainstream
A symbol of misogyny, gay panic, fiscal irresponsibility
So I figure
If you can't beat 'em
Join 'em

[Verse 1]
Hittin' the club up VIP
I got a fake mustache and a fake ID
I look like Wooly Willy
With a really wooly willy
And I bypass the bouncer
Pass by an ex and I flex and bounce her, wowser
Look at all of Bo's hoes
Looking for a ride on Bo's hose
And I spot a little Latino, booty so big call it Oprah's ego
We go to it, through it, she says, ""Dios mio mi amigo!""
Pull it out, stick it in your mouth, and I bust in the back of ya
Swallow bitch, there's people starving in Africa!
[Chorus]
Single every single day
Do it every single way
Make the single ladies say
Oooh Bo
And if I were gay
Though I swear I'm straight
I'd make them fellas say

[Verse 2]
You're an ice cream sundae with a cherry on top
But careful, cherry, cause I'm the King of Pop
Pop pop pop goes my weasel
Now ya looking like Jackson Pollock's easel
My suggestion is you don't blow 'til you know what congestion is
Swallow when you know what digestion is
Follow Bo, the only question is
Have you been splattered before by the mad-hatter matador?
Cake-batter never more
It don't matter whether you're Spanish, French, Swedish or Cambodian
I'll slime you so hard you could be on Nickelodeon

[Chorus]
Single every single day
Do it every single way
Make the single ladies say
Oooh Bo
And if I were gay
Though I swear I'm straight
I'd make them fellas say
Oooh Bo
Oh Bo-o, ooh Bo, Bo
A-a-Oooh Bo, Oooh Bo, Oooh Bo
[Verse 3]
You think that you can handle me?
Girl, don't make me laugh
I said my junk is bipolar
It will split you in half (yea)
And if you're lucky, I might just bring you home
And I'll have you going down like you're growin' an extra chromosome
And when you grab me, don't grab me by the buns
Cause I got a bad case of the runs
I got the runs
I got the runs

[Chorus]
Single every single day
Do it every single way
Make the single ladies say
Oooh Bo
And if I were gay
Though I swear I'm straight
I'd make them fellas say
Oooh Bo

[Interlude]
I wanna break it down for y'all
I came from the streets, with nothin'
Now I'm makin' hit records
For my people still livin' in the streets
Still livin' in poverty, I wanna tell you
I'm doin' this for you
My success is your success
And I know you may be thinkin'
Hey, if you really believe that
Why don't you use some of your money
To help rebuild the neighborhood
Instead of putting spinning rims on a gold jet ski?
And to that I say (uh, chorus is comin' up):
[Chorus]
Single every single day
Do it every single way
Make the single ladies say
Oooh Bo
And if I were gay
Though I swear I'm straight
I'd make them fellas say
Uh uh!

[Verse 4]
You got a fume like a tuna
I'll smell ya later
I met a fat chick and I fucked her in an elevator
It was wrong on so many levels
It was wrong on so many le-le-le-levels
It was wrong on so many levels (uh)
It was wrong on, it was wrong on, it was wrong on

[Chorus]
Single every single day
Do it every single way
Make the single ladies say
Oooh Bo
And if I were gay
Though I swear I'm straight
I'd make them fellas say
Oooh
Single every single
Do it every single
Pop that single like a Pringle jingle
Oooh Bo

[Outro]
This song's almost completed
All this little ditty needed
Instrument that's double reeded:
The oboe
(Yea)
Oh, Bo, play that oboe"
Raindrops Keep Fallin on My Head,B.J. Thomas,['rock'],"[Verse 1]
Raindrops are fallin' on my head
And just like the guy whose feet
Are too big for his bed
Nothin' seems to fit
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head
They keep fallin'

[Verse 2]
So I just did me some talkin' to the sun
And I said I didn't like
The way he got things done
Sleepin' on the job
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head
They keep fallin'

[Bridge]
But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me
Won't defeat me
It won't be long 'til happiness
Steps up to greet me
[Verse 3]
Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes
Will soon be turnin' red
Crying's not for me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain
By complainin'
Because I'm free
Nothing's worryin' me

[Trumpet Solo/Verse 4]
It won't be long 'til happiness
Steps up to greet me

[Verse 5]
Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes
Will soon be turnin' red
Cryin's not for me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain
By complainin'
Because I'm free
Nothing's worryin' me"
Sickology 101,Tech N9ne,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Hey, now everybody sit down and shut the fuck up!
Class is now in session
If you came here to hear that lovey dovey shit - get the fuck out!
If you soft and scared of hardcore shit - get the fuck out!
For those who love raw shit - welcome to Sickology 101
Your instructor for today is: Tech N9ne!

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
This is style, I use pitch to catch and seduce chicks
To signal the true sick, monotone is what you spit
Switchin' the pattern, bust out that quick Middlewest chatterin'
Some people hate but it ain't matterin'
But the people gather, it's flatterin'
Switchin' the pitch, mixin', there's no need to be stiff in this bitch
Spittin' full clips on a mission, full bliss when I be rippin' this shit
Make it exciting, got to be inviting when you're writing your piece
Never be dick riding, if you're going to be biting, you're igniting the beast
This is melodic, melodies if you got it
Mix it hot as tamales, you singin' off-key, it's garbage
If you can't keep an octave in a pocket, you need to stop it
Have confidence, speak with conviction
Don't put 'em asleep when you rock it
This is harmony, Nina's taking you through it
Make it buttery, utterly beautiful, make it fluid
Sickology 101 is in session, I thought you knew it
We murderin' motherfuckers in music, that's how we do it!
[Hook]
(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat
(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat

Such an oddity with it, this is Sickology
(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat
(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat
(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat

From our West Coast instructor: Crooked I

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
My killer cadence can keep me crushin' the competition
Comin' correct when creatin' the crazy composition
Cannibal character, Calico carrier, got a crooked copper missin''
Cali killers on candid cock emissions
That was constant consonant wordplay
Wordplay rhymes with Thursday and thirsty - if I'm thirst-ay!
I change the pronunciation of words per se
The English language got to do whatever my verse say
So if you want to learn to rap, this is how (this is how)
Right now I'm puttin' swag in my style (in my style)
It's an emphasis on the simplest sentences
Then I give 'em charisma with a laugh and a smile (and a smile)
If you want your verses to cost higher
Then your similes got to be hot as a live wire
You need some better metaphors
For example, this song is a war zone and you listeners in the crossfire
[Hook]
(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat
(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat
(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat

(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat
(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat

From our East Coast instructor: Chino XL

[Verse 3: Chino XL]
Everybody start lockin' their windows and doors
Chino might get in
It's like lightning and how I'm strikin' a triflin' rifleman
Bullets flyin' up and I'm numbin' the bum like it's Vicodin
So much metal in his spine, he could get rich from the recycling
Chino be curdlin' blood, don't get burned from the buzz
I speak with conviction like what Da Brat just heard from the judge
Bludgeon no love, industry hate me yo
I'd rather hear Hannah Montana than half of you rappers on the radio!
Startin' drama with Chino, God forbid
Auction my lyrics on eBay, that's God for bid
Problem is lyric Jesus is more than a man
With a sick delivery like I drive a coroner van
I'm demented, spittin' writtens as sick as I can
Grenade grippin' and fittin' to detonate Disneyland
I am teachin' Sickology, try to follow how every punch line hits
Like Chris Brown's fist in the face of Rihanna
[Hook]
(Get) on your feet, (up) out your seat

[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Yep, yep, yep
Let me paint this picture for you, baby, yep

[Verse: Justin Timberlake]
You spend your nights alone and he never comes home
And every time you call him, all you get's a busy tone
I heard you found out that he's doin' to you
What you did to me, ain't that the way it goes?
When you cheated, girl, my heart bleeded, girl
So it goes without sayin' that you left me feelin' hurt
Just a classic case, a scenario
Tale as old as time, girl, you got what you deserved

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And now you want somebody (Hey)
To cure the lonely nights (Hey)
You wish you had somebody (Hey)
That could come and make it right (Hey)
But girl, I ain't somebody (Hey)
With a lot of sympathy (Hey)
You'll see, see

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(Take it to 'em, hey, hey, hey, hey)

See, you should've listened to me, baby

Killa, Jones, Freekey
Yeah man, I'm back at it, come on

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Today's a new day, got the boo-lay up in the suitcase
Go uptown to Harlem, tell 'em that I sent ya
Tell 'em it's August, I'm gone til' November (yeah)
I need a couple birds, get a broad, have 'em sent up (of course)
Call my bird, get my broad have her sent up (please)
Call my niggas, call my squad, have 'em sent up (please, yeah)
I see a town I'm liking
See some niggas getting money in a town: I like it (yeahhh)
I run up on them with the pound and light it
Like, ""it's my block now, alright, kid?"" (whoa)
He understood me quite clear
Then that thing banged out
And rang out the side of his right ear (woo!)
And I got back to my business, back to my bitches
Back to the kitchen, that Pyrex vision
Pot, I let that white stuff sit in
Get hard, get rock, get to the block and pitching (what)
Yeah I'm sorry but this is how I'm living
And this is how I'm getting, fuck how I get it
Hey!
[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
I stood alone watching the wall, in the zone, hand on my handles
Listening to gangsta music, ay!
I stood at home hand on a chrome, with a zone, flipping the channels
Watching how the gangstas do it, ay! (say it with me)
I stood alone, getting dome, from a thick chick in sandals
Watching Shaft, clocking math

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Now I see death around the corner
Gotta stay high, will I survive?
In the city where the skinny niggas die
Nope, it's the city where the skinny niggas ride
.45 semi on the side, twisting when they drive, yeah
Lick a shot for Big Pop and 'Pac, yeah
One more for Shyne locked inside, yeah
Two more for Cam, for taking over the Roc
Yeah, yeah, it's my year
So, okay, okay, okay, y'all can't fuck with me, no way
Jose or Hector Camacho
TEC blows and watch yo' chest close and tacos
Motherfucker I'm the best, I told y'all before
I showed y'all before, ay!

Killa, Killa (Killa...)
I'm on the west side of Chicago, looking for a bust-down
Don't make me put my two arms up, touchdown! (what up, ma?)
You stay in touch now, but when I touch down
I'm like Buckshot, shorty, Duck Down
Yeah I must clown, I'm from Harlem, uptown
Where we flash money, take your bitch and ask you, ""what now?""
Birds flip a dozen, chicks, it's dicks they suckin'
Swallow my kids, go and kiss they cousin
Yes, they kissing cousins, Toya's kissing muffin
Worse than that, they go home and kiss they husband (shit's foul)
The shit's disgusting
Keep the chickens clucking, keep the pigeons bugging
This on my wrist is nothing
Yeah, it's just yellow hearts and pink diamonds
Where I get the money for this? Don't think rhyming
You fucking with Pablo, Bravo
Mario Villabona, hoe, Ta-to

Yolandas House,Ghostface Killah,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Ghostface Killah]
Ay, yo, I'm skinned up, Nike's is scuffed
Still buggin' earlier around four how I escaped the bust
The way I fell cracked the face of my watch
My mans chantin' me on like ""Run son! Don't go up in the spot""
Jettin' through bushes and backyards, neighbors is rattin' me out
Dogs is barkin' all you hear is the car's sirens
I'm tryin' to think and toss the iron
Bomb in my sweats got me runnin' funny, you think I'm lyin'
May God strike me if he don't like me, I'm tired and I'm out of breath
The weed got me paranoid, my heart's poundin' through my chest
Tryin' to focus up and make progress
That's what I get for slingin' in them projects
Next thing you know I'm in this bitch's crib chillin'
Told her my story and like this I had her legs in the ceiling
Cookin' me fries, fish sticks, hot side of them biscuits
While she doin' this, the bitch still slidin' on lipstick
Now I got the fat stomach on, she crackin' a dutch
I'm playin' with her pussy on the couch, I'm ready to fuck
Like come here miss lady wop, where you put the condom box?
She finished off the last one, oh shit I hear the cops
Handcuffs and talkies, I mashed her white Yorkie
Jettin' up the stairs, them pigs want revenge like Porky's
So I slid, hid behind the wall, opened the door
Like ooo I seen my man Meth goin' in raw
So he jumped up balls out, hid in the closet
I'm dyin' laughin', he said ""Yo Starks be quiet!""
[Method Man]
...and let me put my drawers on, nigga what kinda dope you on?
Shoulda knocked before you came in the spot, Ghost you wrong
Bustin' in here on that government shit
Got this chick screamin' grabbin the sheets tryin' to cover her tits
She's asthmatic and you laughin' son
I bump my toe on the nightstand just runnin tryna grab the gun
'Cause shit's real man, you spazzin' dun
There comes a time in a man's life, he gotta toss his pack and run
You know we family like Crack and Pun
But Mr. GFK, state your business after that, be one
Now can it be that you hot, lord?
You did some shit on the block that the cops tryna lock you for?
Can't believe you blowin' the spot, lord
My chick is buggin', she trippin'
My dick keep slippin' out my boxer drawers
Now I'm caught up in the drug sting
Niggas is callin' my horn, police is hittin' every corner we on
Can't understand it, it's a thug thing
And in the middle of thought, I'm interrupted by Shallah Raekwon

[Raekwon]
I need my money Meth, gonna buy them hundred birds
Tell Tone get at me, all them little clients want work
He know we fresh out, tell the kid meet me, matter of fact beep me
Word to mother lord, son he got me hurt
You still fuckin' shorty? I knew it
The big mouth broad that be yolkin' my balls out
Her little brother wanted two bricks
You know the nigga licks, a Maybach on twenty-six
All he do is get money, hustle, he's a dick
He told me foul shit, wild shit
That nigga wear a lot of loud shit, no that Steve Rifkind style shit
Hit me with some other talk, him in New York
They robbed the Venezuelan niggas, stabbed his son with a fork
That was Jesus' rooster's little niece, little nooses
Father's homeboy, that's the kid who gave us a boost
He gave them things on the arm, said for us to be calm
And if some beef pop off, go ahead and ring the alarm"
Shakey Dog Starring Lolita,Ghostface Killah,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Ghostface Killah]
I had my eyes squinched up tryin' to get through the fog
Pullin' up mad slow blunted, passin' police cars
I saw one two three bodies
Blood mixed with the rain ran through the gutter
That's the work of a tommy
But then I heard it was the work of a mami
Spanish chick bad, about five six, long hair, red Jag
Kinda bowlegged, Chanel sweatpants, she thick
She love her some pussy, don't really give a fuck about dick
That's when I got the call, yo Tone come to the shop
Some fire jumped, chill I'm about to pull in the lot
Lowered the tunes, pulled the Benz keys out the ignition
Brushed the ashes off my blazer then finished my Guinness
So then I walked in, seen the God shufflin' cards
Spades game, it's goin' down, he lost a couple of yards
Peace Lord, how your physical?

[Raekwon]
He upstate miserable
Stressed, doin' a thousand sets
But yo check the visuals
I'm at this hotel in Queens
Me and Charene getting' slow necked
That's live, I couldn't finish the bean
Gotta a phone call, seen the whole bitch face fall
Dope fiend look like the bitch swallowed an eight ball
They talkin' about killin' ya man's and them
That kid from Staten, his jewels is tough, his robes is satin
Yo that's my heart Tone; yea yea he killed the captain
What nationality nigga? The kid was Latin
It happened uptown, broad day, right in Manhattan
I was shoppin' with my home girl, Leona with acne?
But you know what, Flaco niece Lolita
Flew in, she from Medellin, he deaded her uncle over them seventeen bricks
Niggas ain't slick, niggas is dicks
Y'all got beef for life now cause that bitch is a trick
[Ghostface Killah]
Ay yo fuck that, close the gate

[Raekwon]
And lower the shade
Then a shot popped off

[Ghostface Killah]
Hit lil' bro in his fade
And then I see him dropped his clippers

[Raekwon]
He dipped with the quickness
It was Lolita black down yo

[Ghostface Killah]
With four other bitches
She had a nasty hammer, fat ass

[Raekwon]
Her tits was bananas
Yo the clip was ninety shot

[Ghostface Killah]
She lit up the cameras
So then I bugged out, ran up the steps
[Raekwon]
Yo I got hit in the leg

[Ghostface Killah]
He shot back, hit one bitch in her breast
Under the pinball game aimin'

[Raekwon]
It's foggy and rainin'

[Ghostface Killah]
My jewels is clangin'

[Raekwon]
Yo Tone tuck your chain in
She shootin' like she wanted a payment
Throwin' bullets like Joe Nameth, yellin'

Yo it's all entertainment
Where y'all girls at? Where ya'll pussies at?

The Announcement,Jay Electronica,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Introduction: John F. Kennedy]
Its hazards are hostile to us all
Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind
And its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again
But why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal?
And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain?
Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic?
Why does Rice play Texas? We choose to go to the moon!
We choose to go to the moon
We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things
Not because they are easy, but because they are hard
Because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills

[Verse 1: Jay Electronica]
My view is aerial, your crew inferior
My crew imperial, MC Killers: milk and cereal
Get it? Forget it
You’ll still be connecting the dots with smoking holes in your fitted
Those that got it be all at the shows throwing fitteds
The light from the dynasty sign froze all of the critics
And nary a soul got on they frog toes to ribbit
Shhh…T'was the night before the coming
Sugar plum candy coated lines for the dummies
Decoded hieroglyphics in the shrines for the mummies
We not illuminati but our eye is on the money
My mind's on the scripture -
It’s beautiful,I see every line on the picture
So when the leaves rustle and the cock crows winter
Just know that the Black Gods mingled a bit
Then the fingers got pricked, then the single got picked
Man I’m living out my brain I don’t dream about shit
If I say dream, I meant dream, fresh not Hampton
I got a date with destiny I’m definitely not canceling
Romancing...The Stone
The Roc...The Throne
The elegant celebration sent tremors through every nation
The stars aligned like cars at Grand Central Station...elevation
Yours truly my duty and obligation
A newly appointed ruler who move with no observation like W.D
Say my name on a record, WW III
I’ll put you niggas in a box like the WB
Here’s a footnote on the Blueprint, Whoms fucking with We?

Uh, yo

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Well, I do pop pills, I keep my tube socks filled
Pop the same shit that got 2Pac killed
Spit game to these hoes
Like a soap opera episode
Punch a bitch in the nose 'til her whole face explodes
There's three things I hate:
Girls, women, and bitches (What?)
I'm that vicious to walk up and drop-kick midgets
They call me Boogie Night
The stalker that walks awkward
Stick figured with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg
Coming through the airport, sluggish, walking on crutches
Hit a fucking [pregnant] bitch in her [stomach] with luggage
It's like a dream I can't snap out
I black out or back out
Lookin for somebody ug' to beat the crap out
I'm bringing you rap singers two middle fingers
I flip you off in French, then translate it to English
Then I'mma vanish off the face of the planet and come back
Speaking so much Spanish, Pun can't even understand it
[Chorus: Missy Elliott (Eminem, Missy)]
Won't you busa rhyme for me, boy?
(It's the ill, that cool? Slim Shady)
Won't you busa rhyme for me, boy?
(It's the ill, that cool? Slim mothafucking Shady)
Won't you busa rhyme for me, boy?

Won't you busa rhyme for me, boy?
(It's the ill, that cool? Slim mothafucking Shady)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I had a huge attitude, started off staticky
Mad at you, had you mad at me automatically (One more time)
I'm not a commodity, I'm an oddity
Who oddly enough developed himself a Halloween following
It's so big, if I counted up all the freaks who follow me (One, two)
I'd probably owe Ozzy Osbourne an apology (Whoops)
College girls, live in an alcoholic's world
Full of url, head twirls every time the toilet swirls
Covered in throw-up, and I refuse to grow up
I won't budge, I still tell a grown-up to shut up (Shut up!)
I made this rap game suspenseful
Cause now I got an impulse game to insult you wit a pencil (Bitch)
They waste the paper on you, chopping down the oakwood
Cause everything that you wrote in your notebook was no good
And as long as I stay in the studio and keep cuttin'
You motherfuckers are puttin' your words together for nothin'
[Chorus: Missy Elliott (Eminem, Missy)]
Won't you busa rhyme for me, boy?
(It's the ill, that cool? Slim Shady)
Won't you busa rhyme for me, boy?
(It's the ill, that cool? Slim mothafucking Shady)
Won't you busa rhyme for me, boy?

Won't you busa rhyme for me, boy?

Turn the music up, we gon' wake the neighbors (Uh, uh)
We gon' get high, we gon' roll to Vegas (Uh huh, uh)
Me and Slim Shady on some shit daily (Uh, wha-wha?)
What you want, what you got
Is it hot, is it hot?
Turn the music up, we gon' wake the neighbors (Uh, uh)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I'm homicidal and suicidal with no friends
Holding a gun with no handle, just a barrel at both ends
Sprayin' tec's at you until you see your fucking legs
With the bullet holes and the exit wounds laying next to you (Ah!)
Fucking mad dog, foaming at the mouth (Grrr)
Fuck mouth, my whole house is foaming at the couch
Jumped out of the 93rd floor of a building
And shot every window out on the way down to the ground
(Keep filming!)
Woke up to a hospital staff, got up and laughed
Chopped 'em in half, suffocated the oxygen mask
Shit, if I get any higher
I'mma get the East and West beefing again
Fly back to Detroit and stand in the crossfire

[Verse 4: Missy Elliott, Missy as girl]
Y'all better call the police 'fore I kill this track
Don't shoot Missy! Get back
Uh, I'mma put you all in the line uh, and I'mma watch you MC's die
Yo Mommy, Mommy, Missy done lost her mind
I think somebody done pissed her off this time
Yeah, I'mma have to bus' you through your chest and
Uh, you gon' have to clean up the mess (Uh huh)
It's raining, raining and it's pouring loud
Never fear, 'cause pissy Missy's through the crowd
Uh, I hear that the gats go cha-pow
You shot me dammit! Bitch get down
Don't walk when I talk, I never talk when I smile (Uh huh)
I'mma lay em on down, like they lived underground (Uh)
For the sounds that me and Timbaland, we found
Get your ass kicked later or get your ass kicked now

Swagger Like Us Alternate Verse,Lil Wayne,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","No one on the corner have swagger like I
Too cool for school, fly boy high
I drop out like I fell, from the sky
Hold up, let me wipe the cloud off my eye
He has class, first in the lunch line
My lunch ticket let my eat rappers at lunch time
Swagger, shinin' brighter than sunshine
Misfit, duck in the fashion one time
No one on the corner has swagga like moi, Church
But I'm too clean for the choire
I require what I desire I earn my stripes, Adidas
Mami scream papi no mas
Run up in your house just me; no mas

Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk
Get fucked up, hit the strip club
Don't forget ones, get your dick rubbed, get fucked
Get sucked, get wasted, shit-faceted
Pasted, plastered – puke, drink, throw up
Get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
I was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated
I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
Them hips and licked them lips, and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit

Two to the one, from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good tree
Smoke so much weed, you wouldn't believe
And I get mo' ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one, from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountaintop
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon, I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass, I'm gon' continue to rock
Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy, just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt)

I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rin-inse
Swish, but don't spit it; swallow it and now finish, yeah
Me and Nate D-o-double-g
Lookin' for a couple bitches with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's

Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I want a bitch to sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can, but she won't say no
(Now) Look at this lady all in front of me
Sexy as can be, tonight, I want a slut
Would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
Now, I hope you don't get mad at me

Hope you don't mind

We As Americans,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
There's an intruder in my house
He cut my phone line: can't dial out (Shit!)
I scream for police, but I doubt
They're gonna hear me when I shout

[Verse 1]
A couple of cocktails'll send me to jail
There's a couple of cops hot on my trail, but this time
When I get pulled over there's a Doberman Pinscher
And a pit bull in the seat, these pigs'll get bit
Foolin' with me, quit foolin' with me
Bitch, you're gonna see no pistol in the seat
Why it always gotta be an issue when you're me?
And which you're gonna see in the long run, I'ma be the wrong one
You wanna harass with this limo-tinted glass
Flashin' that flashlight on my ass — where was you at
Last night when them assholes ran up on my grass?
Rapper slash actor, kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
They took away my right to bear arms
What I'm 'posed to fight with, bare palms?
Yeah, right! They comin' with bombs
I'm comin' with flare guns; we as Americans
[Chorus]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

[Verse 2]
I make beaucoup bucks, wearin' beaucoup vests
Drama hangin' over my head like a voodoo hex
I coulda been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
With you-know-who, with an S tattooed to my chest
But I've finessed it, now I've got the industry pissy
Ever since me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on 50
It's funny, we got a buzz spreadin' quicker
Than makin' paper airplanes out of a twenty
Fuck money! I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the President [dead]
It's never been said, but I set precedents
And the standards and they can't stand it
My name shoulda been ""Bastard,"" the shit shoulda been plastered
On my forehead with a stamp, I shoulda been blasted
I shoulda been had a cap put in my ass
But I'm too swift and fast for that, I'm past it
I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot — fuck that shit!
I done seen how fast this rap shit
Can turn into some pap-pap shit, that quick, snap click
But this time, they got the fuckin' automatic
Ain't no one gon' test this man — clack (*click*)
[Chorus]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

[Verse 3]
(Shht!) I got a secret if you can keep it between us
I tuck two ninas under my jeans, either side of my penis
Under my long johns, under my Sean Johns
One run-in with the long arm of the law, I'm long gone
I'ma do five years — no less than that, no questions asked
So it might be a good idea that I stop right here
And quit while I'm ahead, already in the red
Already got a steady infrared meant for my head
A target on my back, bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gon' send a task
I ain't gon' even ask, they ain't gon' let me pack
They ain't gon' give me my semi, but I got my weed back

[Chorus]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans"

Emulate,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Obie the person that came up introverted
'Cause of nervousness, that was solely the only verdict
It was worth it 'cause he changed, became so observant
Servin' such of a purpose
If you knew him earlier in his days, it's like a different version
So much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain
That's why it's curtains in this murder, if you get him worked up
I'm so assertive on these muthafuckas acting tougher
Had enough of isolatin' myself in a room
Writing poems and songs, doing the same in school
Now look what he became, a fool
'Cause he learned how to sustain his tool and obtain fame from you
Livin' hard but still Julliard
A god walks and ain't spend a day in the pew
Regardless of this I draw visual, pictures when a nigga vents
So welcome to the art department

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I stimulate the brain, mimic, emulate the sane
Cynics keep on thinkin' it's a fuckin' gimmick when it ain't
Clinically insane, brain is on Venus, up Uranus
Label me a genius if you ever seen us you would say
""He may seem as though he's plain normal"" if you ever meet him
Greet him with a shake, see he ain't as mean as what they say
See the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say
So he's vague, so they mistake him for bein' crazed
You part ways, your impression of him changed
You don't think he's strange, you turn around and tell him; ""Peace and thanks""
You catch him flippin' you off, with his pants down
Hands around his scrotum, tuckin' his fuckin' penis between his legs

It's all psychologic, why am I so maniacal?
Am I a psycho or some kind of psychotic shtick?
Or am I truly psychotic? Or my molecules just diabolical?
'Cause biologically, I defy logic, by golly, haul me off on a trolley
Probably want a quack, or I'm back on that whacky tobacca
I'ma step away from crack, Obie smacked the shit out of me
I'm so slap happy, man, snap me back to reality
I'm a walkin' art gallery, a science museum

Eleven, twelve, thirteen, pistols big as M-16s
How the fuck we sneak in with this many heaters in our jeans?
Nina, two ninas, a piece, they don't even see us
Some shit pops off we squeeze each one
They're gonna think it's machine guns
Vandals-vo-vandals, bananas and old flannels
Hands around our Colt handles, hold them like Roman candles
So ban us, go ban us, banana-fanna-fo-fannas
Who come back all bananas, banana clips loaded
Managers, bouncers, and the club owners
The motherfuckers don't want us to come up, bum rush in the club
And run up in it with a bunch of motherfuckers from Runyon
Steady popping them onions
Ready, set to go nut up, prepare to tear the whole club up
Fixing to get into some shit, just itching to choke someone up
You know we finna loc'n when we mix coke with coconut rum up
So, yeah, yeah, ho, what up? See my people posted up
See you talk that ho shit now, when you're down you won't get up
And can't sit up you're so slit up, the ambulance won't sew you up
They just throw you up in the trunk once they tag your big toe up
Heater-no-heater, automatic-no-matic
Mag or no mag, it don't matter if I have or don't have it
You never know when I'm packing so you just don't want no static
And open up a whole can of whoop ass

Quit tryna play the wall and quit hatin'

Quit procrastinatin'
What the fuck you waiting for? Get off the wall and quit hatin', bitch
Git up now!

I keep a shitload of bullets, I pitbull it to pull it out
And automatically explode on motherfuckers until they mouth get closed
Permanently, you get burned to line quickly
You cannot hit me niggas, too terrified to come get me
Tempt me if you think Swifty won't send a slug, people run
When the reaper comes, the repercussion gon' equal blood
Nigga what? Steppin' without a weapon, you leave, you gone
I be still rollin' with stolen toasters while on parole
Snatch you out our home like eviction notices, ho
When I unload, I'm known to never leave witnesses to roam
When I'm blowed, I'll write the wickedest scroll ever told
When I'm sober I'm prone to roll up and disconnect your soul, nigga

Now it's been proven it's about to be a misunderstandin'
And furniture movin', bullets flyin', lawyers and mothers suin'

Gripping the pump
And who want to fuck with a walking psychopathic pyromaniac
Shady cats with eighty gats
And maybe that's the reason that you gon' get it the worst
And since you jumpin' in front of everybody you gon' get it first
I disperse the crowd with something bigger and versatile
So run and record your verses now while you got a mouth
And it's not a joke, it's some kind of riddle
Kunizzle will lift up a 12 gizzle and throw a party from my acquittal
And a Glock that you will stop you from walking
Bullets'll hit your liver, I'll even shoot Native Americans

I'm sailing on a cloud, they trailing below
My shrink told me, ""It's a feeling they'll never know""
I pack up all my sins and I wear 'em to the show
And let 'em go, let 'em go, let 'em go, let 'em go
I'm sailing on a cloud, they trailing below
My shrink told me, ""It's a feeling they'll never know""
I pack up all my sins in every L that I blow
And let 'em go, let 'em go, let 'em go, let 'em go

[Verse 1: Jay Electronica]
In the land before time
A land before altar boys, synagogues, and shrines, man was in his prime
Look how far I go in time just to start a rhyme
The method is sublime, you get blessed with every line
I'm in touch with every shrine from Japan to Oaxaca
The melanated carbon-dated phantom of the chakras
Me and Puff, we was chilling in Miami
He said, ""Nigga, fuck the underground, you need to win a Grammy
For your mama and your family, they need to see you shined up
You built a mighty high ladder, let me see you climb up
Nigga, what you scared of?
Terrorize these artificial rap niggas and spread love, pollinate they earbuds
Like you supposed to, spit it for the culture
Pay no attention to the critics and the vultures
They rather have a shot of Belvy just to spite you
They casting judgments 'cause they feel they got the right to
Fuck 'em, I let the dice roll like The Father did
I gotta shine, it's in my blood, I'm a Harlem kid
I treat my babies right, treat my ladies ladylike
Hit them with a remix to make sure that they play me twice
I thought you said, ""It's the return of the black kings
Luxurious homes, fur coats, and fat chains""
[Chorus: Jay Electronica]
I'm sailing on a cloud, they trailing below
My shrink told me, ""It's a feeling they'll never know""
I pack up all my sins and I wear 'em to the show
And let 'em go, let 'em go, let 'em go, let 'em go
I'm sailing on a cloud, they trailing below
My shrink told me, ""It's a feeling they'll never know""
I pack up all my sins in every L that I blow

In this manila envelope, the results of my insanity
Quack said I crossed the line 'tween real life and fantasy
Can it be the same one on covers with Warren Buffett?
Was ducking the undercovers, was warring with muh'fuckers
Went from warring to Warren, undercovers to covers
If you believe in that sort of luck, your screws need adjusting
In the world of no justice and black ladies on the back of buses
I'm the immaculate conception of rappers-slash-hustlers
My God, it's so hard to conceive
But it all falls perfect, I'm like autumn is to trees
Aw, the doc interrupted
He scribbled a prescription for some Prozac, he said, ""Take that for your mustard
Boy, you must be off your rocker
If you think you'll make it off the strip before they 'Pac ya
Nigga, you gotta be psychotic or mixing something potent with your vodka
It takes a lot to shock us but you being so prosperous is preposterous
How could this nappy-headed boy from out the projects
Be the apple of America's obsession?
You totally disconnected with reality, don't believe in dreams
Since when did black men become kings?""
[Bridge: The-Dream]
You have no idea, yeah
The meaning to what I say
And you have no idea
Of how I got this way
Now hear my dreams
And by the time you wake
I'll look down from the clouds
See I'm on my way

[Chorus: Jay Electronica]
I'm sailing on a cloud, they trailing below
My shrink told me, ""It's a feeling they'll never know""
I pack up all my sins and I wear 'em to the show
And let 'em go, let 'em go, let 'em go, let 'em go
I'm sailing on a cloud, they trailing below
My shrink told me, ""It's a feeling they'll never know""
I pack up all my sins in every L that I blow
And let 'em go, let 'em go, let 'em go, let 'em go"

You don't wanna be just like your daddy
Pimpin' hoes out here drivin' Caddies
Runnin' 'round town, fuckin' with skeezers
Shots in your ass, catchin' diseases
Son, your daddy got a foul mouth
From fuckin' bitches in they foul mouths
I can't help it, my group's D12
All we do is pop pills and stay in jail
Talkin' nasty shit, Bizarre won't stop
I'll fuck two twins, with a midget on top
A sick mind, rapin' an old lady
Knowin' damn well Bizarre shouldn't have a baby
All I can teach you, learn how to mack
Smoke crack, smack a bitch when she talk back
Matter of fact, smack your sister, she's a slut
Don't you realize Bizarre don't give a fuck?

""Why they let Bizarre rap on Hi-Tek track?

If your wife is pregnant I call her a whore
Leave her no money and go out on tour
Nah, I'm playing, leave her something:
A pack of hot dogs and a fucking dirty muffin
You're my son, I'm trying to teach you something
You're {eight} years old? It's time to start fucking
You know daddy won't give you the wrong advice
Smoke weed and listen to Obie Trice

Meth lab in the back
And the crack smoke peels through the streets
Like an early-morning fog
Momma's in the slaughterhouse with the hatchet
Helping Daddy chop early-morning hog
I'm catching Zs like an early-morning saw
When I woke up to the racket, yawn and pause
What the fuck, man? I can never get sleep, man
Peeped out the window, what's wrong with y'all?
Stood up in my Crimson Tide Alabama sweatpants
And threw my pillow
Looks like Daddy caught the motherfucker
That tried to sneak in and steal his elbows
They don't know that old man don't hold hands or throw hands
Nah, he's rough like a Brillo
Went to the Chevy and pulled out a machete
And a gun as heavy and tall as that midget, Willow

Think he's playin'?
You better listen what he's sayin', punk
Don't make me go pop the trunk

11:30, and I'm pulling up dirty
Smoking babbage out the back of my buddy's Monte Carlo
Spitting over some Supa Hot Beats
With a super hot freak we call ""the parking lot ho""
You know we sipping on that old brown bottle
Bass in the trunk make the whole town wobble
So when we ride around, bitches follow
And tonight, one of them bitches is giving us problems
Well, one of them bitches
Been fucking one of my homeboy's favorite bitches
And he's been on his hit list for a minute
And I think he's ready to handle his business
He told me ""Yelawolf, get this""
And he handed me the Cartier watch that was on his wrist
He said ""Watch this shit""
And he jumped to the trunk and grabbed his biscuit, biscuit

Two men stand
One's gotta go
One falls down to the ground
One walks down to the road
Momma better call the police
Now he's screaming, ""No!""
Took a buckshot to the chest
With a rock-salt shell, and he's moving slow
All this blood has spilled
Enough to give a penguin chills
Hot enough to make a potato smoke
At the tip of the hollowed steel
In the valley of the hollowed field
In the valley of the hollowed tip
This ain't a figment of my imagination, buddy
This is where I live! Bama!

And the fabulous Case y'all, stick 'em out y'all
All my Detroit players, let's go!

I ain't set the stroke and I ain't for games

I got a woman at the crib so I ain't your man

You know all I really wanna do is fuck
I ain't gon' let a money hungry women set me up
And if you think I'm that stupid you done pressed your luck
I'll be damned, I'll be damned, I'll be damned

You damn right, yes I love menage-a-trois
And I got drawers as big as guys's big ""wah""
I'm a Trick Daddy nigga, so bitch how you figure
That I wouldn't turn my niggas on to you when I hit ya
I probably could forget ya if I hadn't been drunk
But your badunkadunk, keep my mind on hump
When my mind's on hump it mean my .9's in the trunk
And Denaun got a line for every fine bitch I hunt
Not once, twice, but three times the lover
That your man is, and I'm a freak undercover
I got plans for you, trick, I don't need a baby mother
I got five of them motherfuckers trying to smother me already
We can't go steady, but you can give me head
Give me that, get the hell out my bed, and leave the shed
My chapped lips will cut nipples when breast fed
And on the way, leave the bread with Achmed
I'd love for you to stay but I got another date
With a fat chick that eat cake on play skates
She rubbed my funky ass feet and feed me grapes
Plus my man in the closet ran out of videotape

I'mma make this one thing clear
Ain't no woman here gon' ruin my career
All the hell you doing is pursuing a dream
That's when you find out that life ain't truly what it seems
All these hoes be lying, bullshitting each other
And why the hell Kobe Bryant didn't wear a rubber?
He might as well have went and told the ho that he love her
I'm sure as hell ain't gonna go to court for my mother
Or my wife, and my sisters, so motherfuck a mistress
They signing a contract before these bitches hit this
Never will a woman take me out that way
I keep a RCA camera in their motherfucking face

My name is Bizzy, a bodyguard for Mr. Mathers
Sit down girl, let me get you a drink
I'mma buy you a mink, and rape you on the sink
From day one, I knew you was a ho
I put a rubber on my toe and fucked you some mo'
Turn around, let me see your nasty ass
Put on a Jason mask while I take off your maxi pad

[Verse 4: Kuniva]
These hoes be on some bullshit, always trying to pull shit
Outta they ass, get mad and put you on blast
Tell 'em bitches how she fucked you, sucked you, put it on you
Boned you, yapping off with they mouth, saying she loved you
All on your dick, calling your phone, spazzing and shit
Having a fit until you feel like calling it quits
Then she starts calling your chick wanting to fight
Every time you show up at a gig she front row with her friends
Flipping you off follow you to the bar, the bathroom
The parking lot, to the car, pissing you off
Until you blackout, now you and the ho is having a scrap out
You get locked up for assault and now you assed out

Yeah, Bad and Evil is (back)
(Don't stop)

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9""]
We 'bout to get into a tale of a gunner that details the dungeon
Just as the pale moon illuminates the hail and thunderin'
'01's the year where I fell from blunderin'
Shady lifted his wing, then I fell from under it
Now I’m freefallin’, my career is gone into re-calling
Regardless of who’s fault, I was speedballin'
God bubble wrapped me and dropped me on top of the Earth
Then Marshall doubled back and got me from on top of the Hearse
I’m alive, nigga, Justin T ain’t got nothin' on me
'Cause I done cried Mary J. Blige rivers
I realized that God’s with us, soon as I decided
To put that bottle down and pick up my Todd Bridges
The writing's on the wall
Since niggas seen me at the baseball game
With Shady and Jay-Z, suddenly everybody calls
Like, ""I’m just checking on you, dog!""
While I throw up this message on the stall
[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9""]
When them bottles stop poppin’ and them dollars start stopping
Do what you did to get it and don't stop (don't stop)
I made a promise to my momma, I'mma out live her
How can I be a quitter when haters don't stop? (don't stop)
I’m living proof, nigga, it's pretty safe to say
God giveth and God taketh away
It's the Worldwide American way, I’m living proof, nigga

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Your body language is sayin’ your confidence is gone
Well, pick ya ass up, lil' homie, come on
You just gon' sit there and take it or make 'em suck it?
Tell 'em where to shove it straight up
You gon' make love to the world or you gon' fuck it?
The last time that life kicked me in the ass
I pulled down its pants and put a foot up its ass
Man, what a catastrophe it’d be for me to be a bitch-ass pussy
And not open a can of whoop-ass, let you piss-ants whoop me
Will be the day I say I ate poop, shit, the day that
I don't straight shoot, I'll drop outta my anti-women hate group
Say I’m a sissy faggot, record it, play it back
And put it on straight loop, you haters look like you ate a grape fruit
To see me climbing back on that wagon, got my swagger back
I was dragging, hopped back on it, grab the reigns on that bastard
And came back on 'em without remorse man
Man, of course, I’m a one-trick pony
'Cause I’ll be screaming on these whores 'til I’m hoarse!
[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9""]
When them bottles stop poppin’ and them dollars start stopping
Do what you did to get it and don't stop (don't stop)

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9""]
Nah, I ain't fading yet, I’d rather stay and rap
I might've made a debt but I find excitement in wondering what I’ma write next so I don't stay in debt
Me broke, you might as well cut the embryo
Out of my momma and play catch
With the baby with AKs with baby bayonets
I’ma get rich or I’ma die trying
That's why it's either kill or be killed
So call me suicide homicide Ryan

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There's a bomb inside my head, I’m a live wire
I am on the edge, teetering on it like a totter, I might
Get on a nut like a tire iron, I have no desire stopping
So why would I drop and roll? That's how much on fire I am
Rappers are fun and I’m the time 'cause I’m just flying by ‘em
Man, I’m laughing at ‘em the entire time, why am I up?
'Cause tribulations I have triumphed, bitch, I’m fired up
""So one time for me, just let your fuckin' lighters light the sky up""
[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9""]
When them bottles stop poppin’ and them dollars start stopping
Do what you did to get it and don't stop (don't stop)

But I feel like this is worth it, do you disagree with that?
If not then holla back
Hey and tell ya girl you’ll call her back

But ain't you riding with me?
We breaking, up we making up
Like Dwayne Wayne and Whitley
You throw things, you broke things
Use both hands and hit me
And right when you call the law
I’ll tell my boy to come get me
Then you, then you start listening
To friends, and then it gets tricky
They try to tell you leave, but this love is real sticky
So you ignore the hickeys, the pics of chicks in they vicky’s
That they sent me, is that real love
You’re the only one that I will love
Damn, damn

My best friend says
I can stay with her
At her house, no doubt, anytime I like
My best friend says
Don't let you in my life cause you don't do for me and you don't act right

And have the operator breaking on yo line when you speak
And I can say I'mma make you mine in a blink
You nominated just for your behind and I'm geeked
You a thug with yo best of friend mud wrestling
Sitting in the corner with a mug and a cup of Gin
See me looking for you when you win in the pen
See, I hug you dirty, you confronting me for flirting
You wanted me too, suddenly my company's a burden
But I won't jump a balcony and how can I be hurting?
I'm just playing with you and it's working

Bring yo friends damn, your skin smell like coffee cake
Yo, meet me at the place when you get off at 8

You the truth, I'm for real yo I love you to death
And if we break up I'mma stalk you and bug you to death
Until you scared to leave the house because you know I'm in the bushes
We went from hugs and kisses to shoves and pushes

6 in the Morning,D12,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Eminem]
Good morning! Ha-ha!
Wake your motherfucking asses up!
Are y'all with us or what?
Well, come on then, you know what time it is
Stop sleeping on my group, BITCH!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
For whatever it's worth it's worth me havin' my ass whipped
'Cause I'ma have the last lips to ever kiss ass with
I just can't get past these little piss ants
That wanna be brawny bad asses so bad
And they so mad, they can't stand it
'Cause we can and they can't spit
And they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens
And I snap, and it's a wrap, and it's scrap, and then it isn't rap, is it?
Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you gotta go and resort back into that shit
Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but my passion is to smash anyone rappin' without havin' to slap him
Believe me, I'd much rather lift a pencil than a pistol when I'm pissed now
But it all depends on just how far it gets took on the mic
'Cause I'm tellin' you right now, you're not gonna like it
'Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pullin' you with me
You poke a stick at a pit bull, you get bit, B
These words stick to you like Krazy Glue when you diss me
'Cause they just bounce off me, like bullets to 50
I'm the beautiful-lest thing and you gonna miss me when I'm gone
Like Keith Murray when he threw a stool and hit a girl accidentally
I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy & Proof, are you with me?
[Chorus: Eminem]
Come on then, everybody come on and
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers, come on in
'Cause we get it on until the break of dawn and
Wake your ass up motherfuckers, quit yawning
'Cause we ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning
So have a sing along with the words of the song and
If you don't know the words, and you can't sing along, then
Fake like you know 'em motherfuckers and join in
Everybody, good morning!

They consider me the epitome me of a beef starter
In a party with heat, it's hard to keep me without one
Fuck slugs, I'm walkin' gloves with a shotgun
Constantly poppin' slugs, they hot, son, better not run (Aah!)
The bosses of all bosses; a holocaust to whoever ain't conscious
In a house full of dog shit
I'm a gothic death project, you stop breathin'
You die quicker than Mach speed without bleedin'
It ain't about what you readin'
When you meet me, better speak like a season's greetings
Either that or we'll be beefin' frequent
You niggas need an ''E'' just to speak shit
Your leader's a petite bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I snipe you with it, and we won't even keep it a secret
Nigga I did it from the mind of a mental patient
When Glocks wave, you can save that conversation for satan
You brave?

Come on then, everybody come on and
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers, come on in

I can see that he's just a punk
I mean these niggas squeeze on me
Please, I'm seeing guts
I don't need no enemies, as my family a couple trucks and my MPC and a mic
They empty out on them bike to fight you
In front of every reporter that I don't like
No need for metaphors to get points across when I write
This emotion's enough to say: ""Fuck you, bitch, and I don't like you!""
What?! I might as well give this up, but that'd be selfish as fuck
To leave D12 in this, but we can't self-destruct
I've never felt it this much, c'mon, fellas, get up!
We gotta fight like Bugz last night of his life, c'mon!
[Verse 4: Kuniva]
I walk with a limp, pistol hanging off of the hip
I'm awkward and quick enough and sick when sparking a fifth
Your carcass is split, even if beef is partially thick
We can't take you seriously, you a comedy skit
You probably wish that you could be out, shooting at G's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze, I can't believe
You speaking on moving keys, but every time we hear you kick it
The only thing that you selling is woof tickets
I look wicked 'cause niggas'll test your nutsack
So when they bust, you better bust back or get your guts clapped outta your stomach
And when they want it I'll bring a hundred niggas from Runyon, so get to gunnin' if you coming

[Chorus: Eminem]
Come on then, everybody come on and
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers, come on in
'Cause we get it on until the break of dawn and
Wake your ass up motherfuckers, quit yawning
'Cause we ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning
So have a sing along with the words of the song and
If you don't know the words, and you can't sing along, then
Fake like you know 'em motherfuckers and join in
Everybody, good morning!"

Oh, we sound like Em clones, huh?
Where the fuck you think he started at holmes, huh?
Skip the small talk, talking is a risk you take
Kick yo' face 'till yo' head go through this window and break
Break to the 1-9, Denaun cause the gun-line
And collect bank from every weed spot like I'm one time
I'm ain't the remorseful type, I'll drink and still drive prone to hit anything at any given night
Fuck leaving my roots, I'm still in cahoots with nincompoops who shoot out like troops in Beirut
Pull up in a red hearse with Fred Durst dressed like a nurse
With a coach purse screaming his throat hurts

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
On my Harley Davidson, I ride down Main Street
I speed with my dad's name on my ass cheek
Gimme your ones and get robbed with a broken gun
Got you doing more dances than Puffy's son

You gotta be 12 years old with a coloring book
And anyone else who wanna get fucked, 'cause

To bring you the shit to murder conservatives with
To curse and diss, with verses so merciless
These words can just fuck up your high worse than this

I've killed for less, and dumped bodies in the motherfuckin' wilderness
I'm a wildebeest, and I've concealed a piece even after I was busted by Warren Police
You think just because I got caught by these cops once
I'm not gonna carry shotguns to blow your wigs back like hamburgers without any top buns
So many damn murders I can't even count one
Two black guns, I don't know maybe they're Magnums
I don't know what the fuck they're called, I just grab them
12-gauge dumps in a drug-fueled rage, fuck age, still goin' through my ""fuck-you"" stage
I'm a 27-year-old eleven-year-old, I'mma never grow up, bitch, I ain't gon' ever get old
I'll be sitting here with a cane and a beard
Still insane and as weird as the day I came in here, brain in my rear, yeah

Now why you wanna play a game with me, dangerously
The outcome's hot, once split your brain in three
Proof with crooked raps, always ask them ""What the fuck you lookin' at""?
And invite the hook to scrap
I gave my life to God, nigga, then I took it back
Move it black, this fuckin' gat'll leave your cookie cracked
Detroit's derelict arrogant terrorist, straight on you aerospit
Spit at various people to leave you with a body to get buried with

You need protection, you gon' fear it
I snatch away yo' DNA from existence, with no spirit
Give up the carats or see the nine
Fuckin' with mine is like Farakhan chewin' up swine, on Christmas
With a white trailer bitch on his arm, chillin' in Europe, havin dinner with a Uncle Tom
I attack killin', fuckin' hoes like Matt Dillon
Stackin' obituaries higher than Michael Jackson's ceiling
I leaves nobody livin', I got Satan shiverin'
Hate what I'm deliverin', you know the best then send 'em in, crack you with a fifth of gin
You got your men, but they all wearin' skirts like them niggas from Scotland, you hoes are not grim
Don't make me stop in with a mag, and blow yo feet up out yo Top Tens
[Verse 6: Kuniva]
I'm the one they call in to torture ya
Smackin' your bitch and forcin' her in the back seat of an old Corcia
Kuniva's the silent type, but under the silence is a violent life, usually followed by sirens and lights
Get your throat cut by this tyrant's knife, from high as a kite
And my get-a-way driver's drivin' right
Fuckin' with Hans will get you flipped like a baton, the deadliest bombs
Wrap around niggas like Camabons, you know I ain't nothin' to play with
Thinkin' you real like The Matrix, fuckin' with niggas drippin' off self-hatred
I'm on some live shit, rappers be on some ""Ready To Die"" shit
'Till I put a ice pick, right through they eyelids, fuck heaters, I'll knock you out instead of shootin'

Give up the cash and coat, or get your little brother's classroom smoked
And the substitue gagged and choked

Cry Out,Lil Wayne,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Yea... Yea
Yes
Ima call this here... real rap
Cause this rap is real... ya know?
I hope you ain't too tired to cry
And I hope you know you ain't never too live to die
Listen

[Verse]
I grew up where them people called them people on us
Think we slangin, but we just got beepers on us
Grindin' all day like we got sleep insomnia
Livin' like the videos write a treatment on us
Stuck in the hood like they put cement on us
Ghetto birds still shittin on us, government still quittin' on us
Lost a few homies and the grief still sittin on us
So we got the names writtin on us
White folks still spittin' on us
And them bitch ass police canines, teeth still grittin' on us
But we smoke, ashes still gettin' on us
Older bitches still hittin' on us
I remember well, Beezy roll the L
Beezy ain't here... where's Beezy at?... Beezy got killed
And that was my nigga, I go way back wit my nigga
But I know thats how it happened my nigga
Shit is much deeper than this rappin my nigga
But now they all rappin, my niggas, so now I must make it happen
So I'mma play the captain, sail boat flappin my nigga
No fingas I'm snappin', happy for my nigga Lil' Tiggas
Cause even though we couldn't, The Lord saved him
Last time we seen him was when Katrina hated
Found his body like a month later, Rest in Peace boy
He was a East boy, and so was Wesy West
He was a good nigga, so I know he blessed
And his daughter is a princess
This shit is harder than a bench press
But I'mma keep goin, and I swear I got a lump in my throat
But I'mma keep on pumpin the flow
So if I cry dont stop the beat
I feel like my heart just stopped the beat
My nigga Lil' Derrick is quick to cop a key
Either that or load the gat and go pop a G
And because of that he's just a name in a rhyme of mine
I pray his family and his mama fine
So much shit just sit on this mind of mine
I think about it all the time
I drink about it all the time
I smoke back to back
Cause if my thoughts got to me I'd be in this rap
Or I'd be in the can, thank God I had dreams of being the man
Yea
And fuck a man with a badge
Cause he ain't shit to a man on the edge
The five o killed naughty good boy dead
Man you woulda thought they killed corn bread
Shot 'em up face down on the lawn
Not to mention with his handcuffs on
Not to mention they had plain clothes on
And the complaint goes on
But don't nobody do nothin' bout it
The jailhouse and the morgue is too fuckin' crowded
And haters at an all time high
Everybody gotta hate, it's like a fuckin iPod
Shit and they tried to burn my phantom up
But I got my gun license, I got my hammers up
I'm ready to shoot like a camera
Stay still mothafucka I'mma have to write my will this summer
Cause if they don't kill me, I'mma kill this summer
Yea
And you can put that on my late father
Or my late grandmother, Ms. Mercedes Carter
Or my grandfather Larry Bosock
The old man hustle 'till his heart stopped
And all I know 'bout my real pops is that he had money
No bank account, that brown paper bag money
Yea he might hit me off wit a little brag money
But the nigga still wouldn't be a dad for me
But look how I turned out I hope he glad for me
But thats why when I see him I acts mad funny -
Cause he's a joke to me
Don't message, don't call, don't talk to me
It's just me and my mama how it's suppose to be
And I make sure she paid like she wrote for me
And I know she gets all hope for me
And I don't ever want to see her mope for me
Hopefully, but truthfully there is a day that's due for me
But we gone pray it's as far as the future sees
You are listenin' to the future Wee-zy F. Baby

I am the wrong nigga to cross and the first nigga to jam
With the AK-cuatro siete over microphone in hand
Goddamn, Generation uno, Dungeon Fam
The lab is filled with potions of emotions out the ass
I laugh when you think that you have seen the last
But it's only the beginnin', my nigga, don't be so fast
Mash gas or slow it down to a screechin' halt
Impeach the President 'cause he don't think before he talk
Iraq, goddamn, now he gunnin' for Iran
North Korea got that shit that make LA look like Japan

Next stop, Bowling Green, bling flashin'
Glow my ass off, po-po, they try to harass
My dough, ching cash, and I sit in my castle, bent
You know the W that come from Dirty Bast
Bird baths, love to stunt, we got burners with gas
Fly past, buy NASA, caught up with the cash
Why blast when you know we in your crib? Bypass
I mastered (What?), the treasurer of gettin' ass
Whip Aston, red pipe and leather, slick nasty
Sassy (Shit), but at the same time raspy
Plug me a thug, your mother eatin' plaster

Styles will change, they say change is dang–
Erous as a King standing on the terrace
While his partner pointing up at the riflemen
Coward shooter, never know when your life will end
Then live like there ain't no 'morrow
And if one come, then this the motto
Now I put message in bottle
You go to the nearest beach and open your car door
And walk to the place where the sea meets the land
Yeah, it's easier to run the street than walk in the sand
Hey, I'm talkin', young man, as if chalk in my hand
I will take y'all little ass to school
It's cool when the kids call me Sunny, the hood calls me Stacks
The B's call me honey, Hollywood calls me back
Crack and I have a lot in common
We both come up in the '80s and we keep that bass pumpin'
That's a negative comparison, embarrassin'
Unfortunate that if you come up fortunate
The streets consider you lame
Ha, I thought the name of the game was to have a better life
I guess it ain't, what a shame
I don't slang, never slung, but I'm one with the slum
That has a name well fitting, plenty cheese getting
No wonder why they call it the trap, so watch your tail
And I'm not kidding, the rats and mice would give advice
They say, ""You can paint and draw, get out of here
Go show 'em that we're more than slangin' raw""
That's when I broke into my Big Rube impression
And I tried to enlighten, but that night I learned a lesson
That the morals that you think you got go out the window
When all the other kids are fresh and they got new Nintendo Wiis
And your child is down on her knees
Praying hard up to God for a Whopper with cheese
Do you B, hit the street hard with a flair?
Or do you A, go to school for heatin' and air?
Dare make an honest livin' or make a crooked killin'
Or do a bit of both until you're holdin' on a million?
Brilliant, you got one foot in, one foot out
You put your left foot back in and then you shake it all about
You do the hokey pokey 'til you turn your life around
That's what it's all about, 3000 out

I'll always come back to you (Break)"

One for the money, two for the show
Three to get it crackin' in the hood, let's go

[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
My rhymes pop like them nines, they claim they tote
But they rap lackluster shine
My shits busts like Busta Rhymes sniffin' lines of coke
(Woo-ha!) Ha, that's all she wrote
On the quest to qualify for these inquisitive quotes
Quirk-ass MCs be as queer as folk
Talkin' about, ""Nigga can rap!"" No shit, Sherlock
Y'all MCs can't see me like Matt Murdock
I'm the pinnacle rhyme kid
And any line of mine is criminal minded
And I blind her with original rhyme shit
Fall in line with the sick, cynical grime shit
Clinically approved for you to move your behind with
Timeless, all world girls wiggle their spine to Pharoahe
Do you need to be reminded now?
Stick 'em up, it's that, get 'em up, it's that
Put 'em up, it's that, let's go, uh

Yeah, how we rock, show them how we roll
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Let's go)
Line 'em up, light it up, fire it up
Wire me up, let it blow
One for the money, two for the show
Three to get it crackin' in the hood, let's go

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
They research my stem cells, clone ten of me
Send one of 'em back in time just to get rid of me
Stop Pharoahe Monch from having verbal epiphanies
Now that's new definition to 'your own worst enemy'
Ock listen, man, stop snitching, man
You use sex to sell, your Nextel to Sprint
Everything you represent is immoral, singular, not plural
You and your sidekick get rid of that whack trio
I freeze MCs zero degrees below
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
You need to get loose to the heat I produce
From Long Beach to Boston
Your chicks text us like Dallas and Austin
I spark tireless illumination
Fire sixteen bars, wireless communication
Let's go
[Chorus: Pharoahe Monch & Mela Machinko]
Yeah, how we rock, show them how we roll
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Let's go)
Line 'em up, light it up, fire it up
Wire me up, let it blow
One for the money, two for the show
Three to get it crackin' in the hood, let's go

Show them how we rock, show them how we roll
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Show them how we rock, show them how we roll

So Bling, tell me
What's really good?
What's up with the harshness diss record? You wanna retaliate?
Yo, fuck you niggas, straight up and down
You niggas never had no weight in the street
You know what I mean? Yo, what the fuck you know anyway?
Yo, yo, yo, chill, chill with the cursing, yo, fall back with the cursing
I had New York on my back for years, you know what I mean?
I don't really give a fuck anyway

You sit on your hand 'til your hand turn numb
Then you jerk your penis 'til you start to (what?)

Phantom,Mr. Lif,"['hip hop', 'alternative', 'r&b']","[LIF]
Check it out
I been waitin', playin', for a long time
X amount of thoughts carried out in my mind
I turn on the TV, I see crime
Script written diligently and aired on time
Push the power button, now I'm to devour somethin
Opened up my fridge and found nothin
Tipped to my room with an aura of gloom
Wishin' I could write another tune
But my hands are paralyzed, plus my eyes
Wanna shed tears, but it's not possible, there's
The burden of things I couldn't bear
Feelings weren't dealt with properly
Remorse follows me
With his good friend, the threat of poverty
Here's where I am, versus where I think I oughtta be
There's a certain chance I'm a victim of circumstance
I take a look at myself and at first glance
I see who I recently thought to be me
Based on identities public and private
Behold the radio pirate, ya nigga
A felon, chillin' with a gun to your melon
A pimp with his pockets swellin', a jester
A slave with wounds that fester, the wanna-be
Pre-med 3-D dread an academic reject
Hoping to detect why we wrecked what God gave
Human laws are laid, we go to war
Come back and come up with more
I'm kind, friendly, your worst enemy
Charming, crass, and potentially
Dangerous, have you ever heard of such?
I'm invisible and impossible to touch
[EL-P]
This is not my beautiful melting identity
The thoughts that I can't manipulate for the safe line
Is personal, one amongst many is the macro
Made from the pain of the fragile
(repeat 3x)

[LIF]
I still say fresh dope and things of that sort
I don't shoot up, smoke crack, or take shorts
Your thoughts are always welcome, I seldom
Won't enter another's perspective, corrective lenses
Are somethin' that I wear, so I can see the globe real clear
Look, there's famine over there, plus the families in fear
Of disease and distress that lingers in the air
These are the words of a man in purgatory
Words of a simpleton living in oblivion
Is this the model for life you will envisionin
Free as can be in a world of imprisonment?
I dare you to check new territory
American dream? Time for another story
One where I don't choke to keep afloat
I'm sick of livin' on false visions of hope
With a knife to my own throat
Stick of dynamite inside my overcoat
Because I know the ropes
Reality in this world is bought and sold
A very limited scope of life is shown
And I'm just one of the mold, fully controlled
Left to erode in my humble abode
You won't hear me because I got no loot
You don't hear me because you don't compute
I'm docile, psycho, have you heard of such?
I'm invisible and impossible to touch
Single mother, who are you? (I phantom)
Office worker, who are you? (I phantom)
Caught up in the system, who are you? (I phantom)
Tryin' to earn a living, who are you? (I phantom)
Depressed and uninspired, who are you? (I phantom)
Hard-workin', broke and tired, who are you? (I phantom)
Seekin' education, who are you? (I phantom)
Can't get ahead no matter what you do? (I phantom)"
Jugular Vein,Mr. Lif,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","(Chorus)

Well I have arrived
And over the years I've tried to sit back
And watch niggas that think they top notch
What did I spot, niggas is sub par
So I came to claim your jugular veins
First name (huh), Last name (whew)
I'm still not ready to reveal my identity yet
Enemies keep testin'
May I step back and make a simple suggestion
Please don't approach, I'm highly unstable
Don't pass me the mic cable, I'm fatal
Let me nutshell tell my life story, but I got to hurry up
And kick it, cause the feds are lookin for me
Once upon a time I had to slay crews
And the story never ends like Atreyu's
Describe the process first they bruise
Then blood ooze, Down streets and avenues
Cops search for clues, They found a black hoodie of mine
And some raggedy shoes, you could be a casualty too
Traces, I'm in various places, I look like everybody of all races
One of sciences most spectacular cases
A man of the earth to be discussed for ages
The un-just lust at the wars they wage us
Pass me the bong, nigga, hold the papers
(Chorus)

I'm high now, niggas can die now
Every morning when I see the sun rise, I bow
Then I stand up, pick the land up
Got the whole globe in my hand, what
Am I disrupting your day, shhh
Listen up the universe has got somthin to say
I translate, while all of my jams wait
All life is clingin to the wings of mans fate
And you can't clip the cords
So I find time for inner reflection when I'm bored
Maybe I'm made of liquid metal like T2
Cause after you blast me my dome is see-through
But I heal real fast, Here comes a real blast
12 mega bombs n ash, And after I get rid of your frame
Why dont you come back to the crib and play some videogames
(doorbell) Thanks for checkin me, sit on the couch
Pick up a controller and lets play Tekken 3
Whoop that ass 4 times, now you wanna switch
You can use Eddy, now I'm Dr. Boskonovitch
Lay on my back, spit in your face
Pump up the bass, take your shin sweep the leg
You startin to beg, stomp your nuts headbutt
Break your arm, nigga be ghost oh I forgot your already gone

Pull Out Your Cut,Mr. Lif,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Lif, a new state of mind, new state of being
Constantly striving to understand what you're seeing
Finding the courage to stop fleeing
Problems that lie within
So this is where we begin
Self-esteem: something that's diminishing
Look upon the faces of the youth you'll see them withering
Societal pressures can be imprisoning
Look at the effects that they have on us all is rather vividly
How many women you know with eating disorders?
How much makeup on the faces of our pre-pubescent daughters?
Dudes are acting macho and they don't know why
A famous never-written motto is that ""boys should never cry""
Keep all those emotions bottled up, now what's up?
You can't communicate once you became an adult
Situations got brought cause you had lockjaw
Your kids ended up learning about life from a pop star
But I feel that rap is more real
Matter of fact this music's gotten me through many an ordeal
I was laying on a stretcher kicking rhymes by Eazy-E
After falling off my bike while holding food from Mickey D's
So I chilled, had to calm my mental state
Happy with the knowledge that the music helped me meditate
And while I'm healing waiting for this world to erupt
You can catch me sitting next to my crate pulling out cuts
""Pull out your cut"" (Rakim...scratched)

[Spoken]
Yeah that's what I'm talking about right there
But yo kid, yo I was buggin, you remember ""Watch Me Now"" by Ultramagnetic?
Oh of course dog, my favorite joint though was Gang Starr
What's that joint? How's that joint go?
Wait, yo I think I remember yo

[Verse 2]
I'll flip, you know I'll flip the script
I said I'll flip, you know I'll flip the script
The Guru, he's been my idol for years
Ripping shit with Premier, making the b-boys cheer
And the GZA, Investigative Reports
He, Ghost' and Raekwon, they didn't take no shorts
Plus the R, cause that's the way that it has to be
These brothers redefined lyrical mastery
And I could go on cold pulling cuts for days
But I got something to say about you rappers today
Your rhymes drop in weak spurts so you bite 'til your teeth hurt
But I'm your dentist so meet my apprentice
Chucky, and Charlie Bronson from Death Wish
I couldn't hoard all of these medical skills and be selfish
It's hard to say rhymes with no incisors or canines
I kill all the weak minds, administer brain ????????
Cause I'm the type of kid that's on the positive tip
But that's because I suppress my urges to slaughter you quick
But this time I just can't fight the feeling
That's why I'm smiling as your small intestines dangle from the ceiling
You're over, as KRS has said on the track
""It means return of the real hard beats and real rap"" (KRS-ONE sampled)
""Pull out your cut"" (Rakim...scratched)"

Vision is blurred, yo

[Verse 1: Mr. Lif]
This is the last chapter, bombs hit who? Crushed what?
Over there? Oh, my God, oh, dear
I was, hmm, I think I was, huh, going somewhere
About to pay my fare, bright glare, not quite clear
Stare blind into the light of possibilities
Think I heard the screams of those in my proximity
Or had I started thinking wishfully? Guided by fear
I'm semi-aware, please, is anybody out there?

[Verse 2: El-P]
It was a gentle fission kiss on my block
And hot light like a baby breathing sigh in her terrain
And now my name is merely last second of brain exist
Before the final flash
Where emotion and pretty details of the life I had passed
Now my warm night in Brooklyn is ash
Falling from the snot of loosies that I choked on
Around the corner from class
Before the moments when the moon can move fast
Another summer slowly growing with the friendships
That would end with a blast
Or how the hours could so blissfully lag
She slid her tongue between my lips and I gasped
Told my dawgs and they laughed
Now we're combining our cash at last
A pack of smokes and a flask
I hope there's liquor with a gas by the mask
[Verse 3: Jean Grae]
Convert to atheism, denounce god, pronounce religion dead
Faith in nothing, trace my wrists with razors
I refuse to wait for the blaze to erase my spirit
Death, faced with it, run to it, not from it
Swallow all the pills in the medicine cabinet
Chase it with a bottle of one-fifty-one, hug mommy
Head outside to smash windows and trash my hotel lobby
Rape a cripple if the time allows
I find a kid to hem up, I wish I'd done more sinnin'
Get a strap-on, run up in some women
Lay in the middle of a highway, wait for pain to hit me
Steal all I can with people lootin', screamin', ""Come and get me""
Find the nearest pawn shop, biggest gun, crowded street
Blow my brains to hell and gone and let the devil come for me

[Verse 4: Akrobatik]
What's the chances I'd be one of the last ones left alive to see this?
The Earthcrusher came before I could even conceive a fetus
But I did go from nothing to misunderstood elitist
Who tried to tell his people to rise instead of actin' like defeatists
But what good is that? 'Cause now we all goin' to hell
Like some kid playin' in his class, out talkin' before the bell
I died believing in righteousness, but I could have indulged more
'Cause giving in to temptation don't seem that raw no more
I heard some airline offered flights into space
I shoulda took it to see earth before they mashed up the place
I thought I'd be alone when they finally came to get me
But nobody gotta miss me, 'cause they all comin' with me
[Verse 5: Mr. Lif]
Our horizon was accessorizing, need bred more need
Best believe it's the equation of greed
I need a new car and thus new brakes, another tune-up with lube
Whatever's put together shall be unscrewed
In times of famine, we made more food, food made more people
It's all explained within the cycle of evil
Would I trade it all? Cruisin' down the highway on a bright summer day
Gazing out a plane to see the earth from miles away
Watchin' the Patriots win the Super Bowl
Grabbing that fumble from Ricky Proehl
Or my stereo, providing me with rhythm and soul, I don't know
All I know is I feel guilt for every single thing I've ever bought and sold
I shoulda been in more demonstrations
Planted bombs in corporations
Murdered CEO's and cancelled TV shows
Burned billboards and torn posters, I coulda read more
Finally, I'll get to meet this god they left us dead for
And it's ill, it's power to the form of a bill
For which people killed, lied, manipulated free will
Conscience will be their crucifix, the chopping block for poppycock
And I can feel our spirits drop upon these streets I oddly walk
Enough talk, here's my last chance to cherish a thought
My flesh is fully melted and my stomach's in a knot
So to my love, I hated to leave you alone, pardon my zone
Passion took me places and my life was a poem
Baby, I was on my way home, about to catch a flight
Our meeting has dissolved in radiation and light
Love you gave me made me shine
You're gorgeous with a powerful mind
You lifted my spirits and strengthened my spine
I'm at peace with my life, 'cause knowin' you was divine
You made me see eternal beauty in a world that was dyin'
Now we're all ground by the grind, out of luck and out of line
Out of signs, and now we're out of time"

(Mr. Lif)
It's rhyme time
Spread your wings and take off
Up into the atmosphere
Riddled with fear
Emotions dangling, the air keeping afloat
Heart in my throat
Another bout with self doubt
Welcome to this journey of mine
Through my mind
These are the ruins of a glamorous shrine
Over here
I have a force with which none can interfere
But on the flipside
I'm tampered with
Misguided and slided
Exposed and thus unable to hide it
My dome is the +Fulcrum+
As the pendulum swings
I try to measure the potential of things
They say I'm the descendent of emperors, kings
When sorrow sings
It's my name that's synonymous
Studied by archaeologists, astrologists
Lost tribes found the path to follow this
[Opio]
Uh, we unearth, the obelisk and dinosaur bones
We prehistoric with the microphone
A new millenium, you're weak
With a flimsy heart, your best shot get
Blasted ?out of misty? park
I'm grand slammin 'em
Cannons missin the mark, we hard targets
But ?Lenin? counter attacks they hit the sargeant
And general, they're bloodsuckers

Will try to stop you
And swindle you

[So what you ?fin? to do?]

Sample repeated 8x:
""Let's travel at magnificent speeds around the universe"" ---] Rakim

[Opio]
Yeah
Playing like Prince
Purple Rain in Minneapolis
And snatch up your ?appleonia?
With the hazardous, batting averages
Swing hard like Joe Dimaggio
Akin to winning rap roulette at the Belazio
Opio's unstoppable, killin all the sacrilige
Keep my shit locked and loaded until the caps in this
Real as a Vietnam flashback, imagine this
Crushing your cardiac harder than an Aztec
I might choke or snitch [what?]
Like Slobodan Milosevic
[Oh shit] Holding on with both my fists
You'll the Ultimate Fighting Championships
Were jumpin in your living room
Fucking up your amplifier
So loud it damn near chipped your tooth [what]
I'm living proof that there's mind over matter
Your spine'll get shattered
+Three Eyes+ comin at ya [ha ha]
Faster than plasma beams, futuristic

The master dreams of a society twisted
One cult with everyone enlisted
Clingin to religion just to feel uplifted
Brother I can feel your aggression
Life on a whole is in question
We ignore what we don't mention
To err is human, but the road we're assumin
Stops all things from breathing and the flowers from bloomin
Now I'm no historian, but I recall
That ALL
Civilizations fall
We give up our control but we suffer from withdrawal
We learn how to walk now we're too proud to crawl

I know it's past visiting hours
But can I please give her these flowers?
The doctor don't wanna take procedures
He claim her heart can't take the anesthesia
It'll send her body into a seizure
That lil' thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin'
Hey, chick, I'm at a loss for words
What do you say at this time? Remember when I was nine?
Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'
Her family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'
I'm arguin', like, ""What kind of doctor can we fly in?""
You know the best medicine go to people that's paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandma's in the NBA
Right now, she'd be okay?
But since she was just a secretary
Working for the church for 35 years
Things 'sposed to stop right here?
My grandfather tryin' to pull it together, he strong
That's where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse, ""Did you do the research?""
She asked me, ""Can you sign some t-shirts?""
""Bitch, is you smokin' reefer?
You don't see that we hurt?"" But still–

Hell yeah, still always into something
Heart still in Compton
The comp can't oppose, dope Cali platinum classicals
Introduced you to my Doggs, that don't love hoes
And Firm Fiascoes—assholes
Fucked you up with my last video, tuxed up
Doing a tango
And cash, always in my grasp
Came up in the game wearin' khakis not kangols, stranglin' hoes
When asked about it in most interviews I just laugh
Now I vacate with hoes with a gang of ass
One feedin' me mangoes, the other lightin' my hash
Rap tabloids write Dre's light in the ass (What?)
Came home uptight, ready to mash
Like a gas pedal, get on that '64 Chevy level
AK-47 heavy metal
Who say Dre ain't ghetto? Just whistle like a tea kettle
I throw three at you, tell me if you see devils
'Cause we rebels over here, I smell chronic in the air

Toting Austrian firearms that's made out of plastic
In these drastic surroundings, it be sounding like Lebanon

Just as long as you don't call me broke

Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote

Ain't nothin' new, I seen it all before
But still, I ball like no tomorrow
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote

All she wrote, all she wrote
I said, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote (Yeah)
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote

It's stupid how I go in knowin' everybody knowin'
That I’m sewin' up the game, destroyin' life, they hate me for it
Eventually, see they can't beat, and then with me, they join
Others sworn under oath or banished, left completely scorned
You tell lies, get cut, nigga, kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
On the fast track, ain't no need for no pit stop
I just laugh at nigga wishin' they were this hot
Guess they mad at me, huh? Really pissed off
Better that than pissed on, I’m the Jetsons, you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone, high-steppin', Prime Time
Thought you niggas been known, ain't no blockin' my shine
Like my new Air Yeezys, you can see me in the nighttime
I get rich off livin' life, you check to check, recitin' rhymes
So call me what you want, wanna hate? Have a nice time

Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed–wait, Sarah, you're late
Your train left, mascara and eggs smear in your face
Night's over, goodbye, ho, I thought that I told ya
That spilled nut ain't nothin' to cry over
Never shoulda came within range of my Rover
Shoulda known I was trouble soon as I rolled up
Any chick who's dumb enough after I blindfold her
To still come back to the crib
Must want me to mess with her mind, hold up
She mistook me for some high roller when I won't buy a soda
Unless it's Rock and Rye cola (Faygo's cheaper)
Buy you a bag of Fritos?
I wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't dye for ya
Tryna pull five bucks from me is like tryna pull five molars
You'll get your eyes swolled up, I'm on my straight grizzly
So why would I buy you a gay-ass teddy bear?
Bitch, you're already bi-polar

See me posted in anything, wearin' any chain
Never gon' see me totin' anything, all you gon' see is bang
It's so nice where I kick it, hate you never get to visit

It's all over ‘fore you finish—sorry, bro, this where we end it
Won’t give you the satisfaction of me givin' you the business

Yeah, I guess life is a bitch, ain't it, Tip?
And each one thinks they the shit
Shirt off my back? I wouldn’t give you the dirt off my handkerchief

Let 'em get a good taste of it
I’m sure you got that relationship memo by now, but in case you didn't
I'ma stick this whole pad full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wastin' it
So, I pace this shit a little bit quicker, that clock I'm racin' it, double timin' it
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time that it may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm, I'm like Stretch Armstrong
Man, I still say ""K-Mart's"" like there's an apostrophe ""s"" on it, dog
And they say McDonald's isn’t a restaurant, well I guess I’m wrong
But if you're gonna tell me that A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs, you can get the F on, dawg!
[Bridge: T.I.]
And on my throne I remain, all alone in my lane
I’m as strong as they king, they were gone ‘fore they came
Now I don’t wanna hang, I slap five with them rap guys
They just wanna sabotage my hustle, shawty, that's why

Now I don’t really care what you call me
You can even call me cold

This is a mixtape about... nothing. Not on drugs
If you bear with me, you might see the undertone of the undertonéd message that's at hand—at the— you know that I'm talkin' bout? Yeah
Look

[Verse 1]
Hmm, what's the deal with this rap stuff?
Since Napster the sales been crashin', and
Since Napster the game's been flooded by has-beens
And never-will-be ringtone-rappers
Hmm, what's the deal with these ringtones?
Niggas buy ringers—can't pay their bill though
Thus contributing to ongoing credit
Issues, their issues pathetic, please listen to me
Hmm, what's the deal with these issues?
Magazines who, at times, seem to misuse
My time with their half-witted reviews
And the blogger has their reviews in rear-view
Because he made his decision
A month prior when it leak on the Internet
So now the net sales quivers
The record sold slips and the drop is now imminent, yeah
What's the deal with the Nets, though?
Like being in the east ain't enough hell for 'em
Two Carters, I thought it'd get better, but
They're getting rid of Kidd, like a miscarriage
Hmm, what's the deal with the DMV?
Niggas is unifying as we speak
And as we speak niggas hatin' me
While they hate me, they sendin' beats for a fuckin' feature
Hmm, yeah, and what's the deal with these rap features?
Half-witted rappers should of stuck to grass pushin'
I'm glad pushin' that envelope, it's mad open
It shows I know a bit—Rasputia
And, what's the deal with Rasputia?
I mean, Eddie Murphy, swang, gettin' married
He got a wife, ex-wife, and a baby mother
In the same year, but I ain't judgin'
Hmm, what's the deal with these niggas judgin'?
I moved from DC in 1990-somethin'
I got a number one spot, who gon' take it from me?
And I ain't never left—that's why I'm makin' money
Hmm, what's the deal with makin' money?
And why black niggas can't get enough of it?
But too much gets you viewed in the news, youngin'
For shootin' done to you or we're losin' money
Shoot young, and what's the deal with these little youngin's?
And True Religions make your butt look ugly, youngin'
Let me put you on the joke, I'll put you on the frank
And tell me what you is, can't tell me what you ain't
I can tell you that this tape
Collection of freestyles that I just want to make
And not a single feature except Lil Wayne
;Cause everybody else did it—I had to save face
And if you love substance, you'll love Wale
But most niggas love nothin' so I made this tape
Get it?
Most niggas love nothin' so I made this tape—gone!"

With all this stress on me?

The Message,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Trackmasters]

[Verse 1]
Fake thug, no love, you get the slug, CB4 Gusto
Your luck low, I didn't know 'til I was drunk though
You freak niggas played out, get fucked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out, Montana way
The Good F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jump out the Range, empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'Zé make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, murder schemes
32 shotguns, regulate with my dunns
17 rocks gleam from one ring
They let me let y'all niggas know one thing
There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King
The highlights of livin', Vegas-style, roll dice in linen
Antera spinnin' on millenniums
20 G bets I'm winnin' 'em, threats I'm sendin' 'em
Lex with TV sets the minimum, ill sex adrenaline
Party with villains, a case of Demi-Sec
To chase the Henny, wet any clique with the semi TEC
Who want it? Diamonds I flaunt it
Chickenheads flock I lace 'em, fried broiled with basil taste 'em
Crack the legs way out of formation
It's horizontal how I have 'em fuckin' me in the Benz wagon
Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon?
Grab your gun, it's on though
Shit is grimy, real niggas buck in broad daylight
With the broke MAC that won't spray right
Don't give a fuck who they hit as long as the drama's lit
Yo, overnight thugs bug ‘cause they ain't promised shit
Hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit
[Refrain]
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'

[Verse 2]
I peeped you frontin'
I was in the Jeep sunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpin'
Across the street you was wildin'
Talkin' about how you ran the Island in '89
Layin' up, playin' the yard with crazy shine
I cocked the baby 9, that nigga grave be mine
Clanked him—what was he thinkin'?
On my corner when it's pay-me time
Dug 'em, you owe me, cousin
Somethin' told me ""Plug him!""
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and shot one
Heard shots and dropped, son, caught a hot one
Somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came askin' me my name
What the fuck? I got stitched up, it went through
Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had the drop so how the fuck I get clapped?
Black was in the Jeep watchin'
All he seen speed by was a brown Datsun
And yo, nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through, blazin' at his crew daily
The Bridge touched me up severely, hear me?
So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours
Be lightin' Ls, sippin' Coors on all floors in project halls
Contemplatin' war niggas I was cool with before
We used to score together uptown coppin' the raw
But, uh—a thug changes and love changes
And best friends become strangers (Word up)

Y'a–Y'all know my steelo
Ther–Ther–Ther–Ther–Ther–There ain't an army that could strike back

Gettin' it on in the world, you know?

Lonely People,Talib Kweli,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Talib Kweli, Paul McCartney & Latoiya Williams]
All the lonely people
Yeah, I like to go out to clubs (Hey, hey)
Where do they all come from?
Las Palmas, you know
She this envy if I wanna get grimey wit' it at Bungalow Eight (Hey, hey)
All the lonely people
Opium down in Miami (Yeah-ah, yeah-ah)
Where do they all belong?
But when I walk in, I look around, and I think

[Chorus: The Beatles & Latoiya Williams]
I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people
Hey-yeah-yeah
I look at all the lonely people (Ooh)

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
Yo, I'm headin' out, 'bout to do some fleshin' out
I know my flesh endowed
With somethin' to prove, I'm settin' out
On a trip to Heaven's mouth, yeah
I'm steppin' out in the name of love
Who knew the Devil could slow dance?
We have pathological romances with technological advance
Infatuated with infatuation and
Intellectual masturbation with premature ejaculation
Make a baby mama's all bastardization and
Lonely people all through the city
They club hoppin' and they love shoppin' and they thug posturin'
Thugs be lockin' horns with Crips on them drug blocks
And them dollars flow right out of the 'hood
When you tryin' to make paper out of the wood
You know that money don't grow on trees
For paper people change colors like leaves
And they fall off in the mud like a filthy pig
Makin' you and your dogs who store all call off
That much deserved ass whippin'
He snitchin', he twitchin', he bitchin', he all soft
Never work with his hands
Little kid on the block who always ran
At all costs, gotta be in the club
Lookin' for happiness or the meaning of love
Then it hit him, out the blue like a vision
All of a sudden he don't like the way he been livin'
And he wanna be forgiven
How I know? 'Cause I'm right there wit him, yo, yo
[Pre-Chorus: Paul McCartney & Latoiya Williams]
All the lonely people (Yeah-ah-ah)
Where do they all come from? (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
All the lonely people (All the lonely people)
Where do they all belong? (Ohh-ohh-I)

I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people
Oh, I look at all

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Tattoos tell 'em who you are
Plastic Surgery coup d'etat the God
Uh, lasers to remove the scar
And then you are, you a supastar, supastar
It's your birthday and you in the club
Talkin' ""Holla back"" and ""Nigga what""
So much cleavage and asscrack
If pussy were a stock it would plummet on the Nasdaq
Blank stares like nobody care
In a room so exclusive nobody there
But really, truth is that nobody there
'Cause it's feelings inside that nobody share
I want God to smile on me
But see, fame is a drug and you wild on E
Celebrities decorated like Christmas trees
God complex like they born on Christmas Eve
Sing a song to yourself and you stand alone
Get nominated for a gold gramophone
Walk the red carpet, left your man at home
Security snatchin' people' camera phones
You got rose gold yellow bottles, pink Cashmere
So ahead of the trend, that's so last year
Last month, last day, last hour, last minute
Your pursuit of cool is so passionate
Doin' for the cash in it, laugh in his face
If it's def or anybody who don't stay in his place
So popular can't go nowhere, folks stoppin' ya
Might want to check a thermometer
When you went into a room, the heat rises
Surrounded by people still lonely
That's why you need disguises, well, probably
[Pre-Chorus: Paul McCartney & Latoiya Williams]
All the lonely people (Ooh, people)
Where do they all come from? (Yeah-ah-ah-yeah-ah-ah)
All the lonely people (All the lonely people)
Where do they all belong? (Ohh-ohh-ohh)

I look at all the lonely people, ohh

Listen
I got a passion for spitting
Smashing the competition
Vocals the logo for the back-to-back world champion Pistons
Undebatable
Flesh is biodegradable
People ego deflatable
See no evil and play the role?
I'm Peter Gabriel
With a sledgehammer
Red handed
Bled stanzas
Set standards
Dedicated to Dilla, Proof, Abel Meeropol, Fannie Lou Hamer, Marlon Riggs
Nina, and Fred Hampton
There goes the neighborhood like
Fred Sanford next door to Ned Flanders
These cats pop off at the mouth like Orville Redenbacher
My lyrics open up the portal to your seven chakras
Helicopters circling
Watch the exchange of Betty Crocker
Soap operas inventing drama
Prevent it
Remember Nakba
SMASH various barriers
Bury us under road blocks
You don't get it. Get it yet? Do you?
The struggle don't stop
It don't quit
Worldwide winning with style like Globetrotters
Don't try this at home
If you stuck in time with broke watches
[Hook]
SMASH the walls of hate
End it for the next descendants
Watching em fall from grace
Repping for the independents
Futuristic sound
You just missed it now
Present with the essence
To evolve, put it all at stake

That's why your power is the size of your attention span
Dilla said it best: (You don't pay attention man)
That's why your respect's the size of your attention span

Its fresh air when I'm speaking to y'all
Sometimes it falls upon deaf ears like I'm speaking to walls
I ain't preaching to y'all
Breaking cycles of violence
Not repeating they flaws
Open up your memory bank
I got the key to the vault
Serving the antidote to Alzheimer's
Delete and install
Ginkgo biloba  think it over
We the leaders we've all been waiting for
Believe it
Heed the call
Breathe it
Keeping involved
These lyrics heat seekers
Deplete tweeters til the speakers dissolve
""Each generation must find its mission, fulfill or betray it.""
I know that ours is more than just being killers or players
Or making millions of papers
Our blood is spilling
They hate us
Too much injustice among us to sit still n complacent

Did a couple DVDs, made a couple mistakes
Didn't know what I was doing, but I put on a cape
Now it's, ""Which world tour should I go on today?""
See, you told me I would lose, but I won
I might cop a million Jimmy Choos just for fun
'Cause bitches couldn't take what was in me, Australia, Sydney
Might run up in Disney, out in LA with Lindsay
Got the eye of the tiger, the Lion of Judah
Now it's me and my time, it's just me in my prime
Everything I tried to teach 'em, they gon' see it in time
Tell 'em bitches get a stick, I'm done leadin' the blind
Got two shows tonight, that's Brooklyn and Dallas
Then a private party at the Buckingham Palace
Which means I gotta fly like a movie, no commercial
That's Young Money, Cash Money, yeah, I'm Universal

Now I'm sitting at the closing, bought my mother a house
You could never understand why I grind like I do
Micaiah and Jelani why I grind like I do
'Cause even when my daddy was on crack, I was crack
Now the whole album crack, you ain't gotta skip a track
I ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards
I just walk up out the door, all the girls will applaud
All the girls will commend as long as they understand
That I'm fighting for the girls that never thought they could win
'Cause before they could begin, you told 'em it was the end
But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in
Got two bones to pick, I'ma only choose one
You might get addressed on the second album
Which means you can breathe 'til I motherfucking say so
To all my bad bitches, I could see your halo

That they've never felt before, c'mon

From ghetto to ghetto, to backyard to yard
I sell it whipped un-whipped, it’s soft or hard
I'm the, neighborhood pusha
Call me Subwoofer, cause I pump base like that, Jack
On or off the track, I'm heavy cuz
Ball 'til you fall cause you could duck to the Feddy Govs
Sorry my love, what I'm seeing through these eyes
Benz convoys with the wagon on the side
Only big boys keep deuces on the ride
Gucci Chuck Taylor with the dragon on the side
Man, I make a buck, why scram?
I'm tryna show y'all who the fuck I am
The jewels is flirting, be damned if I'm hurting

Platinum on the block with consistent hits

I bake them cakes as fast as I can
And you can tell by how my bread stack up
Then disguise it as rap so the Feds back up
Watch it, like my whip, like my chick topless
Doing a buck-six with me in the cockpit
Grindin' cousin, I got wholes for a dozen
Even 11-5 if I see ya keep it comin'
And my weight, that's just as heavy as my name
So much dough, I can't swear I won't change
Excuse me if my wealth got me full of myself
Cocky, something that I just can't help
'Specially when them 20's is spinning like windmills
And the ice 32 below minus the wind chill
Filthy, the word that best defines me

My grind's 'bout family, never been about fame
From days I wasn't able, there was always 'caine
Four and a half will get you in the game
Anything less is just a goddamn shame
Guess the weight, my watch got blue chips in the face
Glock with two tips whoever gets in the way
Not to mention the hideaway that rests by the lake
Consider my raw demeanor the icing on the cake
I'm grindin'

Balance weight through the hood, kids call me Mr. Sniffles

I'm from the '80s
Home of the her-on
Era of the hustlers, uh
The world is my custies
New Rich Porter
The way I flip quarters
Front on all these other rap artists, but me
Momma was a mink wearer, papa ran numbers
So it's plain to see where my whole plan come from
American dream, I'm living the life still
Way I shine is like a zillion dollar light bill
Still I'm grinding, army jacket lining
40 below Timbs on, getting my M's on
My best friend's gone
I seen bad days, still find songs that I hear him on
Getting my Mary J. Blige Reminisce on
I hear his voice in my mind like, nigga live on
So I get on that fly shit I been on
Spin on corners in Enzo with rims on
But for info, puffing on Endo-Nesia
Give me amnesia
I ease up, that right, I'm high nigga
I want the sky
The world when I'm done
I'm give it to my sons
Let 'em live it up, split it up, switch it up, uh
Sixes kit it up, man I did it up, done
The rest of my belongings belong in the hall of fame
A list of hits next to all my names
I came

(Woo!) uh-huh (geah)
I want the sky baby
I want the sky baby

[Verse 2]
If the sky should fall
And it all goes tomorrow and they foreclose on the house
And auction off all my cars
Don't cry for me Argentina, I mobbed the Beamer
Took trips abroad, got mobbed in Sardinia
In Ibiza, I had pizza in the club
Ladies know I'm that guy, they wanna piece of my love
Now they wanna do your boy like Mike in his prime
Billie Jean, the goddamn boy ain't mine
And the Roc break up, had the people losing hope
Can't lie, they had Muhammad Hovi on the ropes
Now I'm back in the go mode, back in the go-go's
Throwing the diamond up, repping the logo
Rose gold, Rosé flow, I'm okay though
What don't kill me makes stronger than before so
Here we go and I'm not Domino
When it all falls down, I'm like Kanye's jaw
I might break but I don't fold, 'til I hold the sky in my hand
Yeah, that's my goal
And then I bid you Freddy Adu
Prodigal Child, y'all not ready for the fu-ture, ture
Then I disappear in the Bermuda Triangle
My name will be viewed as such
Here's to the man who refused to give up
I want the sky nigga, chuuurch

People Not Places,Invincible,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Prepare for take off
Touch down Ben-Gurion
Strict search make sure nobody enters with bombs
Blue white flags
For the Birthright Tour I’m on
Never mention three villages the airport is on
Recent history buried
But it speaks through the sand
All Jews: Law of Return
I don’t seem to understand
""A land without a people for people without a land""?
But I see a man standing with a key and a deed in his hand
First stop: museum of the Holocaust
Walking outside–in the distance–saw a ghost throwing a Molotov
Houses burnt with kerosene
Mass graves
Couldn’t bear the scene
It wasn’t a pogrom–it was the ruins of Deir Yassin
Next stop: shopping at the Kenyon Malcha
Built it on the back of the town Al-Malha
Wishing we could call it its name;
Appalled by the change;
And now a mall full of chains
Is all that remains.
[Hook]
My Ima misses people not places
Has she seen the towns with names in Arabic the Hebrew replaces?
The policies are evil and racist, deceitful and heinous
You’ll never be a peaceful state with legal displacement

[Abeer]
Remember the names of our cities before you came and replaced it
Remember and tell me how am I supposed not to miss a nation living within us?
[Translated from Arabic]

[Verse 2]
At the Wailing Wall I’m rolling a wish
Then stick it in between the hole in the bricks
I’m feeling more than melancholy
This used to be the Moroccan quarter
Until we stopped em short and
Now their grandkids is the ones that’s throwing rocks at borders
I ain't one to play and I don’t pray often
So I’m AWOL'n
While you making native sons
Feel like a stranger in they own land like James Baldwin
This ain't about a Qur'an or a synagogue or Mosque or Torah
The colonizer break it into acres and dunums
Erasing the culture
Changed Haifa to Chaifa
Changed Yaffa to Yaffo
The old city left to haunt
Hummus pronounced chumoos, we ate in a restaurant
Next hit the discotheque
Yes we on the list of guests
Palestinians can't get in
Its blatant disrespect
Cops stop em for speaking they language
Its dangerous
To repeat it when
With history we disconnect
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
200 year old olive trees
Uprooted the groves
To build a wall
Now their future enclosed
Settlements spreading like cancer and toxic sewage polluted the roads
Now full of checkpoints
I superimpose the truth and it shows
Village ruins overgrown with planted trees
Who’d have thought the ""desert blooms"" and Tu Bishvat
I can't believe
This ain't environmental
Disguising lies, extincting lives like manatees
Calling it a transfer? Please–
More like a catastrophe!
Birthright tours recruiting em, confuse em into moving in
Claim its only names and words but denying the root of them
Power been abusing it
Our past never excusing them
60 years since 48 and 40 since Jerusalem
My boy Shadi wanted to visit it so badly
He lied he’s diabetic to see it for five seconds
One Nine Four ruled the courts in the case
Mom, you can’t disconnect a people from the importance of place

Disc Jockey: How you been? Main'taining?
Mr. Lif: Main'taining, son
Disc Jockey: No doubt, yo I been holding it down here
Rocking a ton while you away
Mr. Lif: Of course, of course, of course
Disc Jockey: You know, but like yo this cat was running his mouth you heard?
Mr. Lif: What's up?
Disc Jockey: Cat was running his mouth
Talking 'this' and 'that' saying you don't be
Rocking, you don't rip the mic or whatever
I was just like, yo kid, I just wanted to know how you felt about that

(Verse 1)
That's absolutely ridiculous I'm meticulous when ripping this
I'll break your ribs, hip, and fist
If you don't get the jist I'll give the ear a twist
I'm more fatal, as a tornado, or volcano
Hotter than fire with the texture of glass
Lif the lava mass
This mega blast is supplied by years of struggling and praying that society
Start crumbling
It's humbling when you describe your skills as pummeling
Step on stage and proceed to start mumbling
And stumbling over the mic stand
This is when I enter the stage and start to decrease your lifespan
Same thing goes for your dj and your hype man
My targets are on-lock, you're in my sights and...
I am, going to show you a true mic holder
Burn that ass up, watch you smolder

Run step yeah bounce nigga bounce
Run step yeah (echoed and scratched)
Step yeah bounce (echoed and scratched)

My shits so clear, yours just bubbles like root beer
Talking bout you went on tour where
With that tired ass shit that nobody wants to hear
You showed up at the venue wasn't nobody there
Except me, hoodie down and deadly
Ready, to end you with the murderous medley
This one here is aimed right at your head see
You suck clown, krs told you ""duck down"" (sample of krs-one)
But you didn't listen
Lif wasn't missing
I came in on some nuclear shit, well here's fission
Hitting, with a quarter century of wisdom
Have you ever heard the sound of bones splitting
Come a little closer, oops you're not supposed ta
What with another rugged rhyme from my holster
I keep flipping
You think you're calm? Keep wishing
Til' this niggas done, next mission
(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
You hear my voice so you know that I'm here
Letting competition know I'm fresher this year
Parts of a scientist, mind of a bear
There's a rumor, that Mr.Lif's Kuma
Robots time warp to battle me sooner
Cause they know my plan is to damage they future
So I write a def rap
Similar to a death trap
Squeeze til the bolts in they neck snap
Check out my newly, found ability to let life flow through me
The only way to truly pursue the
Wisdom for which my soul seeks
Now my mind spans over valleys and peaks
Bringing an alarm to anybody who sleeps
Orbit the concept inside of your reach
My breath taking word play snatching ya speech
Son you're just a student of the lessons I teach

Here's some funky fresh hip hop shit for 3000
Long after we've laid to waste all areas surrounding
Bass pounding, souls jumping, and you're pumping your fist
You've never heard a stiff body ripping like this.  See
I was stripped of my identity, conquered by the enemy
And now I'm faceless in the 21st century
You may kind of vaguely remember me or maybe not
Was it Ted or was it Scott, homo sapien or robot?
Serial number: ay carumba
So you look at me real deep in my eyes and then wonder
Hold up.  I still have important things to say
I go home and watch news after stagnating all day
Just press play, cool out, sit back, and relax
And gobble up another earful of these undelivered raps
And just think that perhaps what we think matters
Delve into yourself and rediscover once forbidden data

I see traps, I eats raps such as kneecaps
Scapula, clavicle, I call this the “Marrowcle.”  Bones
By the barrel-full.  Great meal, nigga.  I'm rather full
This section: digestion.  Blood rushes
To intestines.  When we met, I left a negative
Impression.  Yet another state of metamorphosis
I'm off-keel.  Please pardon my awkwardness.  Here, let me
Start with this: here's a hint like [?]
Let's calculate what you think my mental net profit is
Patience something I was forced to learn.  You must
Truly tap into yourself to make the records turn
So here I go.  Words make wind blow.  I’ll change the world
When looking through my window.  Angle strangle
Any sucker duck, my mind done went outside and
Fuck him up.  You picked the wrong street, nigga, you're out of luck

Oh, let me tell you, son
Watch this
I run up in the Oval Office
The President's nauseous
He'd better be cautious
Before Lif launches
Another assault, his
Weaponry's too advanced
You give him a glance
He might present an ill
Bio-chemical sentinel
Here it comes
Funny how a politician runs and shits his suit
That he bought with money from selling guns to loot, perhaps
Came from makin' what pollutes your lungs and gave ya a glance of cancer, and 21 salute
You were just another recruit that got shitted on in life's crap chute
The government gave you the boot
But now I'm in cahoots with alternative routes
Let's all meet, so we can tear down Wall Street
Actin' like a misfit, up in your district
Financial, the damage is substantial
My oath-limited growth, the law, you continue to break
Earthquake, set and calculate how long it will take to rebuild
How many people will be killed in your high-risk
Search for what doesn't exist
Lost in the mist with assist
From the microchip up in your wrist
I'll blur your sense of secure
Many have tried, but, none can deter
Me from this path
Political bloodbath
They question, don't mention my name when they ask

Because They Made It That Way,Mr. Lif,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","It started with two turn tables and a mic
Lightning strike, electricity
MC rip rhymes DJ cut the wax viciously
The combo, maliciously brought, ingenious and precise
Mad nice, soon to be subject to mad heists
Niggas talkin' bout they bought mad ice, livin the mad shiest
In the battle of art versus trends
Poetry ends when money contends the recipe blends and becomes diluted
Polluted in fact, but check who's been recruited
Intact with rhymes for your mind
Everyday's a struggle cause society frames you
But raise your head and walk with pride because i came to...

""Make It Better"" -] [KRS-One sample] (2x)

The only place I can find justice is deep inside of these lines
That i designed to explain situations of the times
People in general are targets of big money markets
And are all disposable unless you come ready to work
Fully posable with suit and tie
Ready to buy into the bullshit images
Of people claiming that money is what there religion is
Filthy females that are visionless
And foes that are precisionless
Let me be your mind's eye and vision this
Rise above, your power is limitless
The ghetto's designed to leave you spiritless
Living from day to day dodging AK spray
Niggas doing anything for pay
In streets that spite the light of day
The fallen gods been led astray
I must retaliate
""Why?""
Because they made it that way
""Word""
Fully educated rhyme spray
My way is to give you something to cling to
So you can survive dilemmas that you live through
Then exist through your light
And focus on being in search of what's real
Instead of just relying on the steel
""Make It Better""
""Remember?""
""Make It Better""

Check it
This is the new lyrical selection
Red, black, and green protection
Motivation and pride connection
Moving the focus of your perception away from nice cars with fuel injection
The lesson is often taught, but never heard
Leaving your vision forever blurred
Killing for wealth in a world that's absurd, with hate in killing the fate
Delivered by your villain(?)
Fucked up from skunk and malt liquor and now he's illin'
Cause he hasn't had a meal in three days
Chop your neck in three ways, common occurrences these days
Soon to be locked in a cell for raising hell
Looking back upon his life wondering where he fell
But martyrs tell of many uncivil nights
While battling for civil rights
Niggas die cause ignorance plights
And ignorance fights progress
In all shapes and types
By blocking the lights of success from niggas sights
So one nigga snipes his brotha who he claimed he never likes
And snatches his Adidas and Nikes
So I drop knowledge on mics until apocalypse strikes
Atomic blast blowing niggas off dirt bikes
I mold the soil into dirt spikes
And jump straight from the top of the chart
And drive 'em through the devil's heart
It's time to revolt and restart
And live our lives from the heart
And bring this music back to the art, rip it apart

[Mr Live interrupts]
Yo yo, hold on, wait a second. You with the jheri curls
Get out my way. Yo yo this is Mr. Live
88 whats a name (?). I bust all over the
Gap dress, nah mean? This cat is fradulent

[TB] No no, I claim the stain. I claim the stain...
[ML] Nah Nah, that was me. Crazy bust off
The DNA gonna show it

[ML]
Why you go and do that, Mr President?
It was me that ran through that, splashin over Monica
Fradulent confession, Mr. President
I was all up in your residence the White House
I was militant like Mumia deliverin messages
See that Gap dress clingin tightly to her breasteses
She was after this, your secretary
But I wasn't respecting this, its legendary...
Told her my name was Vernon Jordan
""I can hook you up with Revlon,"" she bought this
She's givin me head in oval offices!
I can't believe Lewinsky is on the knees
Who busts in the door your wife and Chelsea
I couldn't lie though, your wife is a bimbo
Chelsea's ugly, and Monica's a nympho
We took it the Oval Office
Where they signed the 5th amendment
Preceded to bend it, like I was demented
Up in a mile a minute, I splashed and left a stain
Went for the cheek, and got all on her dress
I lost my aim, Bubba
Another fact that's gonna be a teaser
Monica left the dress in her momma's deep freezer
Monica's a skeeza
Why do Live have to be the double lard pleeza?
Turkey on the roll, and I can smack that beeva
From here to Geneva
Monica Lewinsky took every centimeter
Shes a Pita eata
The bomb like the taco bell, chicken fajita
Believe a brother Bill, Kenneth Star
Gonna take the DNA and find out that's
It blacker than the whole NBA
So I'm sorry for the stain Mr. President
I know its causin you pain, splashin over Monica

Why'd you go and do that, Mr. President?
It was me that ran through that, I wasn't hesitant
Now one night @ SOB's I was out lookin for cheese
And I came upon this honey mo-mo lewinsky
She's 5'8, couple of pounds overweight
So I wondered was it glandular or truly what she ate?
Maybe a family trait
She needed fries with her shake
And to be honest, I would say
She'd get it on a good day
But since I'm a brotha who stays in control of his boner
I had more reservations than (what?) Arizona
Three drinks later she was damn near Pam Grier
Maybe my imagination or the Black and Tan beer
Well anyway, we're in her black Mitsubishi, on the
Way back out to DC with Secret Service and [dee tees?]
Tellin me, she wants to get touched like she's ET
I say ""Don't worry Mo, I got more hard drive than a PC.""

Where she used to smoke illy with Kathleen Willy
And some shots of Clarence Thomas when he had locks
Reagan on rocks, she had Edgar Hoover's old frocks
We did it once upon the kitchen, and once upon the floor
And once upon the ceiling with the [neck around the door?]
Then it splashed galore, she forgave me for
The stain I left up on her and the White house decor
So sorry for the stain, Mr. President
I know its causin you pain, splashin over Monica
I claim the stain, Mr President, I tried to
Be benevloent but then I had to represent like skeet
(imitates Clinton)

Moment 4 Life,Nicki Minaj,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I fly with the stars in the skies
I am no longer trying to survive
I believe that life is a prize
But to live doesn't mean you're alive
Don't worry 'bout me and who I fire
I get what I desire, it's my empire
And yes, I call the shots, I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water upon a vampire
In this very moment, I'm king
In this very moment, I slayed Goliath with a sling
This very moment, I bring
Put it on everything that I will retire with the ring
And I will retire with the crown, yes
No, I'm not lucky, I'm blessed, yes
Clap for the heavyweight champ, me
But I couldn't do it all alone, we
Young Money raised me, grew up out in Baisley
Southside Jamaica, Queens, and it's crazy
'Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me
Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't faze me
Ain't being cocky, we just vindicated
Best believe that when we done, this moment will be syndicated
I don't know, this night just remind me of
Everything they deprived me of (Yeah)
Put your drinks up
It's a celebration every time we link up
We done did everything they can think of
Greatness is what we on the brink of
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive

[Verse 2: Drake]
What I tell them hoes? Bow, bow, bow to me, drop down to your knees
Young Money the mafia, that's word to Lil' Cease
I'm in the Dominican, Big Papi Ortiz
Doing target practice, all these bitches just aiming to please
Shout out to the CEO, 500 Degreez
Shout out to the OVO, red wings and fatigues, oh
Niggas wanna be friends, how coincidental
This supposed to be y'all year? We ain't get the memo
A young king, pay me in gold
40 got a bunch of weed he ain't even roll
These niggas be droppin' songs, they ain't even cold
Weezy on top, and that nigga ain't even home yet
Yeah, be very afraid
These other rappers gettin' bodied and carried away
Fuck it, me and Nicki Nick gettin' married today
And all you bitches that be hatin' can catch a bouquet, ooh
Yeah, you a star in my eyes
You and all them white girls, party of five
Are we drinking a lil' more? I can hardly decide
I can't believe we really made it, I'm partly surprised, I swear
Damn, this one for the books, man
I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man
I'm really tryna make it more than what it is
'Cause everybody dies, but not everybody lives, ah
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
This is my moment
I waited all my
Life, I can tell it's time
Drifting away, I'm
One with the sunsets
I have become alive

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life

The Sauce,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
It's all bad now, man, it's all bad
But y'all done fucked up now
Yeah! Haha! New shit!
Ayo, I just want the whole world to know
That I did not start this, but I will finish it

[Verse]
Comin' up, it never mattered what color you was
If you could spit, then you could spit
That's it, that's what it was
Back when motherfuckers was straight backpackin'
Cipherin', fightin' for life in this rap
For the mic to get passed, and you psyched and you gassed
Then you hype, ‘cause you last
And you might whoop some ass; if you lost, then you lost
Shake hands like a man and you swallowed it
When the Unsigned Hype column in
The Source was like our only source of light
When the mics used to mean somethin', a four was like
You were the shit, now it's like the least you get
Three and a half now just means you're a piece of shit
Four and a half or five means you're Biggie, Jigga, Nas
Or Benzino—shit, I don't even think you realize
You're playin' with motherfuckers' lives
I done watched Dre get fucked on The Chronic
Probably ‘cause I was on it
Now you fucked me out of my mics twice, I let it slide
I said I wouldn't hold my fuckin' breath to get a five
Shit, I was right, I'da fuckin' died already tryin'
I swear to God, I never lie, I bet it's why
You let that bitch give me that bullshit review
I sat and took it, I ain't look at the shit, we knew
You'd probably try and fuck us with Obie and 50 too
*Spit* Fuck a relationship! We through!
No more Source to street cred, them days is dead
Ray's got AK's to Dave Mays's head
Every issue there's an eight-page Made Men spread
Will somebody please tell whoever braids his head
That I am not afraid of this fuckin' waste of lead
On my pencil, for me to write some shit this simple
So, listen closely, as I break it down and proceed
This old G's 'bout to get smoked like rolled weed
You don't know me or my motherfuckin' mother
You motherfuckin' punk!
Put me on your fuckin' cover just to sell your little sell-out mag
I ain't mad, I feel bad, here's an ad
Here's a poster of Ray-Ray and his dad
You wanna talk about some shit
That you don't know about, yeah?
Let's talk about how you're puttin' your own son out there
To try to eat off him because you missed your boat
You're never gonna blow, bitch, you're just too old
No wonder you're sore now, lordy, you're bored now
I'm pushin' 30, you're kickin' 40's door down
Bitch, this is war now, and you'll never beat me
All you do is cheat me out of Quotables
But you know that you'll always see me on your TV
‘Cause you've got to stay up 'til three in the mornin'
To see your video played once on BET
So, hee hee hee, who has the last laugh? Aftermath, yeah
So, on behalf of our whole staff, kiss our asshole cracks
We'll never fold or hold back
Just know that Benzino's wack; no matter how many times I say his name, he'll never blow, jack
You're better off tryin' to bring RSO back
Look at your track record, that's how far it goes back
It's extortion, and Ray owns a portion
So, half of the staff up there is fresh out of jail from Boston
Bullyin' and bossin' Dave like a slave
They completely brainwashed him, and forced him to stay
Locked in his own office
Afraid of the softest, fakest, wannabe gangsta in New York
And it's pitiful, ‘cause I would have never said shit if you'd
Have kept your mouth shut, bitch, now what?
Hit it, Clue! Spit it, Slay! New shit, Exclusive
Yo, Lantern, yo Whoo Kid
You know what to do with this
Use it, I'm through, this is stupid
I can't believe I stooped to this bullshit to do this
And who you callin' a bitch, bitch? You owe me!"
Taking My Ball,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Yo, Dre, Man
Make my vocals sound sexy... woo!
Come on, man, come on, man, okay

It feels so wrong 'cause it feels so right
But it's all right, it's okay with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me
So I'm taking my ball and going home, home

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm that guy, man, shove a diamond up my hind end
And crush it with my butt muscles while I cut vocals
Slut poke holes in ya shirt, jump in mud puddles
While I stomp mudholes in ya ass, girl, now let's cuddle
Blood curdlin', you're gurglin' on your blood, what'll
I do for my next trick? I'm feelin' wonderful
I think I might just do somethin' a little less subtle
Shove a fuckin' Tonka truck up a little kid's butthole
Feel the wrath of a psychopath slash ambassador
Of the Valentine's Day Massacre slash assassin
I slash her in the ass with a icicle
And leave her layin' in a blood bath while I
Put a catheter in and jump in the bath with her
In my Spider-Man mask, man, just imagine the
Fun I can have with a strap-on
Stick it up Kim Kardashian's ass and make the bitch run a triathlon
Are those pistachios? Damn, I'd like to have some
Laying on the patio, man, rolling a fat one
Shady, drop the magic marker, put the cap on
Goddamn, man, are you that much of an asshole?

It feels so wrong 'cause it feels so right
But it's all right, it's okay with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm like Houdini, tuck my teenie eenie weenie between each
One of my thighs and make it disappear like a genie
Make the shit disappear like Tara Reid in a bikini
Believe me, homie, you don't know the meaning of a meanie
They call me the fruit loop from Jupiter, I'm tryna maneuver the
Hoover up in your poop chute, don't move or ya
Might get it stuck so fuckin' far up in your uvula
You ain't gonna know what he was tryna do to ya gluteus
Totally tubular, sniffin' glue through a tube in the studio
Now who do ya think is more fruitier?
Wiener smothered in peanut butter, puttin' on a tube of ya
Eye shadow and man, it looked nice, you should've seen it, mother
I think I'll put a piece of art on my Visa card
Then I'll go beat Mischa Barton with a Cuisinart
Then mosey on over to Rosie O'Donnell's with McDonald's
Jump on her lap then watch The Sopranos

It feels so wrong 'cause it feels so right
But it's all right, it's okay with me
I'll do my steps all by myself

I can put you in a trance the way I dance

Shady, what are you doin' chewin' on a human?
Grab an aluminum bat, hit Heidi Klum in the back, boom! And
Assumin' the fact that that dude's in the back room
Usin' the bathroom, vacuumin' a raccoon
Skewin' a rat, a cat screwin' a baboon
You shouldn't ask what is he doin' with that broom
You should be glad he ain't leave you full of stab wounds
You in a trance, I'm back doing my dance, ooh
But they're afraid I might get Sarah Palin by the hair
And make her wear a bathin' suit and take her parasailin'
Shady, why do you gotta pick on the lady for?
Why you make her read eighty-four bedtime stories to you in baby talk?
'Cause I'm scared, there's monsters under my bed
Kellie Pickler hid my juice box under my bassinet
No wonder my ass is wet, my diaper needs to be changed
You like graffiti, dyke? Well, I can pee-pee and write your name
[Chorus]
It feels so wrong 'cause it feels so right
But it's all right, it's okay with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me

[Outro]
Fine, nobody wants to play with me?
Fuck you then, bitch!
You guys are always mean to me anyways
All you ever do is rub gum in my hair and stuff
You guys are gonna make me... make me sad, I'm sad
I'm gonna cry... I'm crying
I'm going to tell my mom... Mom!"

Welcome back to class, bitch, grab on to your glasses
Odd Future leaving even niggas in past tense
Style is patent, the measures is drastic
Either that or they 4:4, some call them fantastic
She called me fantastic, I called her a fat bitch
Still kill the pussy, put the cat in a casket
The funeral service was fucking worthless, so I said a couple words at it
Didn't know her but I'm confirming that she sure gurgled dick
The Odd nigga with a spoon in your Danimals
As hungry as a cannibal, trapped in a van of cantaloupes
Harder than granite, hoes know I'm coming
With the grand force of Van Damme's fist in a damn cannon, so
Fans catch us on Animal Planet, tracking hoes
And attacking faster than foes can change the channel, whoa
My dick hates sweaters so she jack it slow
The aftermath proves to be smoother than hair relaxer, no

Took the van, went snatch her
Oh, you wanna snap and scratch? Snap your fucking jabber
Wocky, she's a dancer, walkie-talkie Ace for back up
Like, ""Fag, I got class and can't take this bitch to math, what
Tell the fucking teacher that this burlap sack is filled
With snacks for after class for the whole class to snack up?
Yeah, right, get over here faster
Cause Earl's a pro rapper but amateur kidnapper""

Earl, goddammit, I'm still in my damn pajamas
Waiting on mom to bring me the Aspirin from a trampoline jump
And if I pick her up, I'm humping and I'm fucking with no lubricant
I'm using spit, piss, vaseline or something, how old is she?
(Seventeen) This bitch is underage
But I'll have her face off tied and Nicholas caged
But anyway, give me cash fag, cause I'm low on gas
Aww fuck it, about to jack off, go catch a fucking cab
No I'm not lying when I say that brother's all I have
But if you're not dying don't fucking bother to call me back
I'm sleep...

He ain't touching me like Martin Sheen's penis
Y'all niggas ain't clean as my team is mean as
Hitting amputees in the knees-es, Jesus
Please, just peep the Crystal Method where
I take a fucking beat, strip it nah-ked then I wreck it
It's no question, Sweatshirt's OF
And you can tell by the chiseled horns on my forehead, bitch
Hammer-hat flyer than a bag of bats
And Jade's a fucking acrobat, I'll flip her on a mattress

Luper,Earl Sweatshirt,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Ma said ""Wake up son, good morning""
I rolled out of bed, greeted mama with a yawn, then
Paused to scratch and itch, and went down to the kitchen
Fixed a plate of eggs and bacon, glass of OJ Simpson
Just as I was about to dig in
A thought jumped in my head, school was to be attended, shit
I paid my thoughts no attention 'cause I wasn't tryna kick it
With this bitch that just ended it with me
But mama wasn't havin' it, so I grabbed my bag
And split out the door and saw the whore that I'd rather kick
It seems kinda brash but it's the hash, I mean the harsh truth
She runs shit, she's the jock, I'm the horseshoe
She's gorgeous, when niggas see it jaws hit the floor so
When she left, it didn't break my heart it broke my torso
Making my eyes ache, stalking your MySpace
Posted a new pic, I mean it when I say that I fucking hate you
But
Maybe if you looked in this direction
I'd pick my heart up off the floor and put it in my chest then
Feel the fucking life rushin' through my body
But you got a guy that's not me, so my wrist is looking sloppy
Come on, let's cut the bull like a matador
You light me up like lamps, a chance is all I'm really asking for
Give me one, I promise I'll be back for more
Most wanna tap and score, I want a fam of four
[Interlude]
Not like a family of four, just like...
Fuck it
You'll never listen to this shit anyways
Fuck you
Bitch
Ugh...

She said ""You rushing, you rabid son of a Labrador
But I'm attracted to you like teenyboppers to Apple Stores""
The basement light is darkened, the switchblade is sharpened
Her name on my arm and her face on a two-percent carton
See her face while you're fixing your breakfast
And know she's in my basement, objecting to sex with
Me, murder spree, surges on with the next bitch

Y’all better leave dat boy alone

And they don't want him to come back strong
I wouldn't dare get that boy going
I said leave dat boy alone
'Cause y'all don't know him
That there boy he out cold
And that there boy he been known
To tear some shit up when he in that zone

It's my attitude that's making me bust shit
I ain't to be fucked with
So basically niggas wasting they time trying to touch Swift
I run with a bunch of killers that dealt with punks
Be turning ghost 'fore you be looking at yourself get stomped
I'm a dysfunctional bastard who will puncture your ass
With a mag and, I'll be glad to send another one after you
Without no hesitation, I'll run up in your house and wake your spouse up
And give her gun to mouth resuscitation
A niggas information, they haunted and they sad
Got you mad cause they shitting through their stomach in a bag
We coming too strong so it's irrelevant to blast you
We master ready, slash like relatives of Manson

Honest to god I usually try to keep to my self
But it's kinda hard when you surrounded by ignorants, well
Let me explain something to ya
A real street nigga ain't trying to get in the streets
He's trying to get out, feel me?
And he ain't the type of dude to pop a E and get drunk
And wave his heat all in the air like he's some dumb ho punk
At least a soldier in the army lose his life over a cause
That nigga's dying over pride to prove he got balls
I play keyboards, I don't play beef
You borrow guns, I own shit that explode when it hit
You think it's fun that you homesick and you can't really get sleep
Cause you done laid a nigga down, but that ain't me
Well my conscience won't allow me to make decisions in vain
I'm a man, I do my business and I do it again
If you take it to that level, I take it to whoever
Want to harm me and my family, Runyon Avenue forever

If you can't feel it, then I must express it through fighting
And I just bought me a new gauge and added on a new knife
And I strike people so fast, niggas think I threw lightning
Clash with a few titans blasted a few hype men
Been harassed by two dykes who wanted Lou Pikner
Plus you know I'm too violent, to be out with you whiling
Cause as soon as you driving I'm a spit a few 5 ones
And I love to Kuniv' son, and you left a live one
I know how to hide guns, from skinny to wide ones
Go buy me a long sub and hide it inside buns
You looking for hoes, and up in here you going find none
You niggas done tried once, and you can kiss my nuts
You soft little dry cunts, get stomped till your eyes shut
No time for the why whats, I'm writing these five words
""Fuck you dick riding niggas,"" count it, it's five words

Okay, I'm done, I already came twice
You ain't gonna make me cum

Uh, your finger just went in my ass
Ow, that hurts, take it out now
Oh, wait a minute, aw

Let that little rascal nibble on my asshole, uhh
Yeah, right there, right there
Ahh, I'm cumming, oh, yeah
Fack, I just came again

It Has Been Said,The Notorious B.I.G.,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Eminem]
It has been said that there has been known to be bloodshed
Over bread, men who have bled to death, dead
Strapped to beds, pipe bombs, dynamite, lead
Money, power, respect, street cred, yeah
It's scary, ain't it? Picture yourself going out as a hero
Picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners
Fans meet to mourn us, while we meet the coroners
Notorious tried to warn us
We watched, so many piggybacked off of
Biggie's back and 'Pac's, landmarks, history in rap
Statistically in fact; it's so sad to see us re-enact
These tragic events, which lead us back
To where we left off on March 9th
To come from such hard knock lives
And make it up out of 'em, hit the spotlights
And, once they're on us this is our lives
Thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
To see who can last the longest
And he who lasts the longest must be the strongest
In this concrete jungle where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
It's origin, which is usually originated from cats who starving
Or it could just be somebody's aura, that just horri-fies
And applies to his persona or the sizes
In his entou-rage that intimidates the people
To the point that you know that he's gangster
He ain't just say shit, you just believe it
[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
Since B.I.G. taught us niggas to think big
I'm been about my business since then, so anxious
It ain't how we live, it's what he said, he did it for Brooklyn
This I took in, sent chills through my skin
Vicious, I'm experiencing the same sights as him
It's what excited Obie to write these poems
Rolling, going through the same shit he spoken
Open up my eyes so there's no limit in them skies
When Ready to Die was a sick part of my life
Palming that forty-five, plotting to pop my mind
Then that crooked eye Jamaican I'd so many times rewind
Got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind
Get up out the system, who could give him better signs
No pop of mine could top Big Poppa rhymes
So possibly I'd be popular, huh?
That's the inspiration I got from my nigga B.I

[Verse 3: Diddy]
I took him from coal to diamond, I molded his mind
Into the most phenomenal artist of any and all time
I made a Frankenstein, my design impressed
Backpackers and press who said my house was a mess
Critics lashed, said I made a fortune off of his passing
All I did was build a dynasty off of his passion
And I'm addressing the adolescents absent to who he is
The original king of New York, Christopher Wallace
This is a promise on Diddy's honor, I'm a father T'Yanna
And teach her that with all the drama don't even bother
On repeat, all of your albums play back to back
And I visit your grave 'cause our friendship's intact
An immaculate concept, extravagant progress
Bullet wounds left in my heart, I'm yelling ""God bless""
Regardless to critics yelling that East/West
I seen the game losing, I'm just pressing the reset
And when the resurrection of you shines through an individual
Lyrical enough to wear the same crown of thorns literally
I'ma pay homage, Brooklyn's finest
Whether it's Queens or Harlem it'll be instant stardom, nigga (nigga)"

The Nothing,Mr. Lif,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'alternative']","(*horn scratching beat intro*)

(Verse 1)
A lot of these MCs tend to freeze
When someone mentions kicking frees
Talking 'bout he's kicking a freestyle
He must be senile
Forgot that he wrote that track last night
That's right
If me and that nigga battle it'll be his very last fight
Ate him up down to the last bite, with maple syrup
You're up next
After you I'll drink a Beck's
Contact another L, listen to raising hell
Run these MCs back to the lab
When I stab tracks I slash backs
Max like simay
Bring your ass to the battle, see what happens
Give me a beat to rip on, and Mr.Lif will catch frames like a dip-on
Snapshot when my rap drops from my track
Rocks and jams your lap-top
Cause your disk drive can't get this lad
This guy willing to diss guys in the right of disguise
This is what wack niggas despise
(soft voice)
I hear what you're saying
But what is it exactly that you're doing

(Verse 2)
I go back to the future like jiggawatts
Come back to present time, they say this nigga rocks
This jam probably shocks blocks
And throws djs in the beat craze
Yes ladies and gentlemen real hip-hop is back
The gotta rip tracks, smack the wack until the stage crack
Get off the stage black, you're of lesser caliber
I battles stars like galactica
So if you're fucked, get up I'm coming after you
After you see me you'll probably flee
That's no use, cause I rock rhymes and stop signs
Jam up your block lines
In text with mic checks
Chop MCs necks then say next
Every concept is a bomb threat
Feared by the pentagon, wear a center-bomb in a black box
So the black shots
Now they want the guard with the black rocks
Cause the fight against crack-rocks, and give back Glocks
To suffering ghetto tenants who got out of detox
And bleedox that report for slave ships and beat the shit out of those that
Wave whips
Have you heard of Mr. Lif, word is flav flips
(*horn scratching beat heard at beginning*)

(Verse 3)
Any MC on my shitlist gets ripped with the quickness
All those in favor say 'I like witness'
I'm about to get physical like fitness
You paper like litmus, you'll get busts
Now increase my implant, I've been amped
I've been champ cause I'm quite tight
Mr. Lif is old school like Light Bright
Scaring nigga like fright night
We might fight cause you might bite
Try to walk my tight rope and I might scope
MCs that think they're quite dope but can't quite cope
With a style that's sinsicular to sickle your throat
Quote for quote, note for note there's no hope
Now carry that back to your crew and ask them what they wanna do
Probably nothing
If they said they wanna see me, they're probably bluffing
Probably only tough in the bathroom mirror
Rhyming over r and b tracks
But I still bump, ease back like it was brand new
That's while all my shit stick like bamboo
Ain't no situation I can't handle
When it comes to you and your mic getting mangled
I take some time out to take your rhyme out
And if I can't be there myself
I'll create a genetic replica to step you

Late Night Coastin,Mr. Lucci,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","(Mr. Lucci)
Another night coastin sippin playa potion
In the drop top
Me and your lady coastin love and crook motion
Sounds from the ocean
With the boat docked
Playing real not intending to stop
Me and my niggas steady holding it down
Blazing a pound while I'm making them frown
Dallas, Texas be the place where I'm found
Bumping my sound
Twenty inches above the ground
Since I'm a crook I was born to clown
Low down is how I'm doing it now
Cause nigga your peeping I called my puerto rician
Tell him creep in
Do you feel like freaking for the whole weekend?
Flamed james got me geeking
And keeping me speaking
Pimp shit to get the hoes knees weakin'
Don P. is what I'm drinking
Bubbles baths and thinking
Parked the two door benz hopped in the licoln
Now we off in the wind
To deep with four sweets
To the coastin beet slow keep it calm and cool
Rubbing her fingers through my braids trying to set the mood
This lady rolling up the cake while I set the brew
This little trip was only mad for two
So pass the brew
And follow what your master do
I know your nigga are steady asking you
Why all your cats in true
And keep on saying he wanna blast with Luc
Squash that cuz im your pass in true
But ain't no way he can stop my style
Do all the things that will make you smile
Back rubs and hot tubs
Give you rose and huggs
Slow love and pleasure rubs
With your number one thug
I'm not your man but I plan to scuff
So girl whats up?
Lets go and chill fabulous
Turn off my screens in the slab with plus
You back and grabbed the tusk
Cuz the night of the hype is gonna light with us

If I'm riding with my trunk open
If I'm to deep deep choking
If I'm out on slow beet bumpin
Well then you know I'm late night coastin
Everybody wanna hate my style
Well everybody wanna hate me now

With another niggas naked spouse

See I'm the type of nigga loving this
I want some more crrok lovly shit
I be the quickest one to roll up with the bud
When I roll and twist
Better prepare for the bomb and shit
Because the constant hit
This stoney crook brain
Flossing with a crook chain
Dark tone with a smile
Pick you up at seven it's about five thirty
So I guess it leave a crook nigga just a little while
So I can get clean and shit
With the startched down jeans and shit
Off audelia with the braids
Now she all up on me
She don't wanna get up off me
From the unique smell of my cologne and the cake
Go on and do your thing im the grey star fleight wood
Won't you take a ride with a deep crook
And I know you gonna be trying to look your best
With the trick wood
Try to come around with cheep look
Cuz of acting like a fish hook
I need a lady crook
One to pick a playa up when he fall
Put down a hustle with no regaurds to the law
When she know a few ballas and got the platinum on the mouth
Ball to the mall
Now it's time for the boasting shit
Tell your friends how I bought you this
Don't be worrying about the cost and shit
Cuz any lady that has seen the rippla was a flossing miss
Keep game i'll talk the trick
Right up on the dick
Slurp slurp got me wiggleing toes
Got me feeling like I'm fixing to explode
While she bobbing and boasting
I'll push back her head and she'll take in some more
How you deal with it all on your nose
I mean nut on your close
And i'll be damned if you kiss me girl
I ain't a playa that will lick the pearl
I'm just a crook type playa late coastin in this infra world

And mixing the lean
Shining clean
To my crooked theam
Checking the pictures of my team
Platinum plack shining clean
Living room eurpean
With the movie screen
Pimped out just like a dream
That O.J. sing
A little twink from my queen
I'm sippin on the drink while I'm puffing on the green
I'm trying to debate weather the cherrys or the cream
Unplugged your phone
The pagers gone
Don't take me wrong
I'm trying to bone
Until the break of dawn
If theres a problem then I'm gonna take you home
But if not then I'm gonna make you mone
So girl don't take to long
Drop your keys, chain, shirt, and thong
Now go ahead on and do that shit
Just spread your tricks if you did
Young women when you gripped it
And licked it up so slick
So heres my chain cuz theres no ice up in the fridge
Now handle your biz
Cris-style fiz and siz
On the side of the tele
While I'm giving it to you steady
Un-button down the pele
Your rubbed down with jelly
She lick around the belly
While jaming down to kelly
The unseen is getting sweaty
And heavier than we freak
Up under the sheets
Work till my water bed leaks
She creeps up out the lace
In front of the fire place
She flossing it up in my face
And begin me for a taste
She scoops shakes
And takes it off
In bed and wall
And keeps a nigga dick straight standing tall
I mean I played it so slick from my pants to jaw
When it was time for me to spit she ain't even pause
Just squeezed my balls
Heath and halled
Up in this chick man I don't think I even seen a flaw
She make a nigga wanna ring the law
But cleanest thing of all
I ain't even gotta see her tomorrow

We makin sho that we ain't takin no loss
And for them niggas who keep on comin across
They can't fade wit a nigga I pause
The ass and leg arm and head

Place bombs in beds the bitch niggas who gone be scared
Fuck the dumb shit I'm gone numb shit
In some red rum shit
Wit my crook niggas
All these niggas talkin nonsense while my drum click is unconcious

In a rythum I ain't spittin and I ain't quittin betta get the gettin
Cuz I ain't kiddin

Im sendin a message to hoes everytime the hoes come you get it crooked

For releasing the beat
Now gone keep me off the leash

I dropped my hinnisee you find it up on the beach
Been gone for four weeks dont wake him up he sleep

Chorus 2x:
Nigga we stay lifted
All yal niggas in the bitch betta run from us

We too pass th Glock before they call the cops
From the ones that will make you hot
From the bottom to the top put your body in a phase
From a crooked ass nigga who ain't scared to bust
And put a bullet in your got damn face
I'm gone burn the place u gone get the gasoline
Burn everything into smitherines
Cuz I gotta get away with the pistol play and your hoes
Better hope I dont come you way I'm gone  bash the place
Retalliated with a mind disgrace
Step if you dont wanna die take another look
Because you might get shook if you ain't ready to bust

Uh
The Bad!
Yeah
The Evil!
The Bad, the Evil!
Put 'em together...

[Hook: Royce Da 5'9"", Eminem & Both]
Yo, if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothing to strip
If it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothing to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothing to chew
I'm just fucking with you, 'cause I got nothing to do

[Verse 1: Eminem, Eminem w/ Royce da 5'9""]
I came in the diner with skateboarders and placed orders
Ate hors d'œuvres and hit the waiter with plate warmers
Let you inhale the Glock smell while I'm ripping your wallet off
And slipping a Molotov in your cocktail
Burning your contracts, punch your A&R in the face
Smash his glasses and turn 'em to contacts
I'm on some Suge shit; if it's missing, I took it (Whoops)
""Nurse, look at this straitjacket; it's crooked""
I go to jail and murder you from a cell
Put a knife in an envelope and have you stabbed in the mail (FedEx)
So how do you describe someone with a decapitated head
When the rest of his body's still alive running?
[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9""]
Coming with five gunmen, waiting to do a drive-by
So when you see the black 500, hide from it
For every hundred emcees rhyming about birds
Only about two thirds, I really said it without words
Yo, you ain't a thug, I can make you bitch up
Pick the fifth up, cock, spit
You would swear it's raining slugs (What)
I'm the hottest shit in the industry (Uh-huh)
I got every thug on the block that get a wind of me, defending me
You lack class and respect, get a direct backblast
The Bad and Evil mad rap, I cover the Bad half
You know how a thug in this shit'll end up
Spit a round, lift your chin up
You get hit, ten down and ten up (What)
I take it if you run your mouth, then you wanna get sent up
Heat it up, you be leaking blood and spitting phlegm up
Now we rivals 'cause of a small name or title (What)
You stepped, got devoured and left with a flower and Bible

Yo, if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothing to strip

Forget a chorus, my metaphors are so complicated
It takes six minutes to get applause (Yay)
And by the time you all catch on, I'mma end your career
And walk away with the whole floor so you have nothing to fall back on
I'll throw you off of ten floors (Ahhhhh!)
Pull a fucking headache out of my head, and put it in yours (Take this)
I'm indoors, waiting for this acid to seep in my skin pores
To go outdoors and do some in-stores
This bitch wanted to blow me, I said, ""It oughta happen—
You swallow cum, bitch?"" ""No, but I brought a napkin""
Getting skully while I'm autographing
Got my daughter laughing 'cause I sent her mother whitewater rafting
I'm not a fact, I'm a proven fear
Mr. Rogers blocked up my U-haul screaming ""You ain't moving here""
Lorena Bobbitt—c'mere, want a souvenir?
I've been high as fuck, since I was a juvi-neer
""Juvenile?"" Same difference, I need some 'caine
'Cause I ain't sniffed since I woke up to seven slain infants (Oh, my God)
Brain implants and they say there's a slim chance
I won't stay the same 'cause I traded brains with a chimpanz' (Ohhh!)

[Verse 4: Royce Da 5'9""]
Walking in swamp water with an M-16
Out for the blood, shove a gun in the mouth of a thug
To break braces (What), you say grace and make faces
I'll display hate and break you in eight places (What)
Take paces, turn around draw in a standoff
Precise aim, ice in my vein, blowing your hand off
Dancing with the Devil leading
I won't die, I'm never leaving (What)
I pledge allegiance to forever breathing
Street niggas with nuts, what? My meat's bigger
Fake-ass thugs with toy guns and cheap triggers
With a death wish, thinking I'm the nigga to mess with
Let the Tec lift, direct chest hit, melt your necklace
For instance, you just a henchmen, on tough soil (What)
A follower never had heart, he just loyal
Thugs is glass doors, I see through 'em, put the heat to 'em
Be careful—you might get what you ask for

It's several different levels to picking up shovels
And dumping you in ditches under sea level
Front and you can witness
Let me refreshen you niggas, tell you my position in this
(Ch-chk!) Beef! Leave you under Venice, opposition finished
Here it is, we invaded, created a pyramid
Of a Haven of names, so blame Dre, and that ear of his
So (ah-ha, ah-ha) breathe, I'd rather reach for your neck
And I never heat you for respect, unless you greet me with less
I got a skunk in my trunk, I'm lying, I got a pump in my trunk
You dying, how many lumps niggas want?
Who's ready for y'all? We ready for y'all
We too incredibly raw for any artist that said he would draw
I stand firm, and it hurts to live it
You open up that can of worms
I hope you ready for the dirt that's with it
Slap a hoe, snatch a mic
Being brought to y'all in black and in white
(It's the new!) Joe Jackson and Ike
We renegades
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
‘Cause see, they call me a menace
And if the shoe fits I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference
They're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Nah, nah, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here?
I don't think you do, so stay tuned
And keep your ears glued to the stereo
'Cause, here we go: He's Royce, he's the King of Detroit
And I'm the sinister, Mr. Kiss-My-Ass is just a—

Move back, youngster, the Glock gon' speak
Chew up your vest and turn your chest hair to taco meat

Or flash the clip, or give you the picture, develop the
Click clock, six shots blows through another door
And it gets hot, Hip-hop Quotable tug of war
Who did you niggas' beats, you bitches, who made it work?

You talk about his momma, he won't even give you the finger

See I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ, the King of these Latter-day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
As a monger of hate and Satan, a scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today
See it's as easy as cake, simple as whistling Dixie
While I'm waving the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they try to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfucking spiteful, delightful eyeful

Kanye's got stacks, ya'll already know that
Louis that, Gucci this, just got a model chick

Just got a stripper chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Something feel different
Cute little college chick, lining up a scholarship
Just got a school grant, spent that on some new tits
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Ain't that a true bitch?
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Let me show you how to do this shit

[Verse 1]
Get you a cute chick, face got potential
Working with her little hips, waist like a pencil
Know how niggas play you, but you know how 'Ye do
Says she love Beyoncé, let me upgrade you
Spanish chick grab my chain, asks ""is that Jesus?""
If I'm unfaithful, blame it on the Grey Goose
All my friends says implants is a selfish gift, they all up in
She ain't pregnant but about to have twins
Now, is it real love, I need to ask Cupid
She real smart but her ass stupid
And she gon' finish school and get all type of degrees
But I bet she never had them D's

Louis that, Gucci this, just got a model chick

Cute chick living good, down here in Hollywood
Upcoming actress, but she got a flat chest
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
That'll give her access
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Let me show you what happened

[Verse 2]
Walking down Melrose, spot where they sell clothes
That chick know she bad, tell by the Chloe bag
She ain't no hoodrat, she ain't gotta prove that
I peep the McCartney's, Stella got her groove back
Hold on, lemme ask you
Why you spend your money on that shallow shit?
Why don't you buy some bigger tits? Something that'll last you
I couldn't tell you if Halle's really real
But I'mma let you know soon as I get a chance to feel
I don't need no hands to know Lindsay Lohan
She on the same program as Britney, is you wit' me?
That's why I respect Alicia Keys
She say fuck getting them D's, I'mma just ride out with these

I Need a Doctor,Dr. Dre,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day, it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack
But they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son
Demons fightin' you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options
There's nothin' else I can do 'cause—

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up, Dre, I'm dyin', I need you
Come back, for fuck's sake, 'cause—
[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers
When the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers; I'm back, bastards
One more CD and then I'm packin' up my bags
And as I'm leavin', I'll guarantee they'll scream:
""Dre, don't leave us like that, man"", 'cause—

I'm mass murderer, pack burners to blast further then you can get
My shit be shooting through bricks
I mix anything together, I done guillotine a nigga
Keep a heater that pop clips with seventeen or better
I'll be severing heads, I'm in everyone's nightmare
A nigga that can never ever be scared of the feds
Send the niggas that'll fuck with you
Stab and brass knuckle you
Then have you in the public, there's nothing that you can do
Enough with you're motherfucking tough talk, you're soft
Get you're balls blew off, from a sawed-off, I'm raw dog
Crazier then all y'all, wet you like the navy when I'm angry
You'll never catch me hanging in a Narc's car
All I have is thought of, breathing evil
Desert Eagles will eat through people
When I see you I'mma heat your beef slow

I send they body flipping around like a stunt double
Forget about the fighting, scrapping, squabing, bucking
I'll squeeze the piece you jumping, dodging, ducking
Squatting under trucks and screaming ""that nigga's bluffing"" (you bluffin')
I cuff my nuts while cussing ""don't trust him""
I round up Runyan, Dave, Wood and Nico
My nigga Big I and Mal' letting the heat blow
Heat seek hoes got A&E closed
Cause you keep shooting at me and missing like Shaq's free-throws
You gotta get a little closer if you wanna try
Pistol whip a soldier, with a missile on his shoulders
We can fold or blow your brick house into some tiny boulders
A grimy, older cat will leave you with a tiny odor
I'm doggish, you feeling froggish, then leap bitch
My car is right across the street bitch and (I'm gonna get my gun!)

My whole outfit count clips, get your house lit the fuck up
Your spouse shit, and your mouse clip
Better bounce, bitch, countless, slugs I'mma send
Watch you holler when the hollow tips go through your skin
I'm in love with the sin, tell Bugz I'mma see him
When I cock back, right, I’ll put your blood on your friends
Make a rug outta him, bust a slug on his chin
Ain't going nowhere like the drugs outta Kim
I'm a psycho icon, a mightful might bomb
Get a eye full of lead when I slight your lights out
With a street cleaner, wipe your life out
Bullets gnaw at your ears, like a Tyson fight bout
Fuck the night clout, guns, clips...
(I'm gonna get my...)
Fuck that, run bitch!
Hit the streets talks, chumps don't know me
Ain't no prob to leave your whole bod' holey

[Hook fades out in the background]
This motherfucker's popping that shit...

[Break: Eminem]
Dumbass motherfuckers always gotta come to me with some dumb shit
Fucking
I done told this motherfucker
Wassup, bitch?! (*cocks gun*)
Autograph this! (*gun jams*)
Oh shit...
(I'm gonna get my gun!)
[Verse 4: Eminem]
I'm trying to pull the trigger but it's stuck, fuck
My shit is all jammed up, ugh
Come on, you cock-sucking, good-for-nothing
Motherfuckin' piece of shit shoot, ah
Yeah! What up, bitch!? Say that shit again
Shot, the bullet missed, hit a brick, bounced of it
Ricocheted back in his shin
Went through his bitch on a way back, hit his friend
Payback homie, don't play that shit is spin
To be on I told you to leave this shit alone
Or... (I'm gonna get my gun!)
And it's a shame, I'm too drunk to even aim
Denaun stepped in the way and I shot him in his leg
It's like

[Verse 5: Kon Artis]
Bang, bang, bang, nigga, pow, pow, pow
Everybody busting rounds like they ""Ra', Ra', Ra'""
But when you see me in the street I be like, what's up, now (what up)
Their bodyguard be stepping in trying to calm shit down (chill out, bitch)
Fuck that! I got a bone to pick
You said it then we should address like some grown man shouldn't we
Then me and you could talk about our problems couldn't we
Just shoot a fair one and handle this situation seriously
I guess not, you want to resort to the heater
So I gotta grab my Mac and my Uzi and my Nina
Step in between us and get shot
But get separated with the squeaza
You ain't ready for war, Runyon ain't nothing to play with

[Hook: Eminem]
This motherfucker's popping that shit
Nah, fuck that, I'll be right back (fuck you)
(I'm gonna get my gun!)
Nah, motherfucker, fuck you
You ain't disrespecting me like that
(I'm gonna get my gun!)
Walk to the room, sixteen shot clip
Bitch, how you like that
(I'm gonna get my gun!)
Bet you ain't know that I'm strapped
Nice one, bitch, this is my gat
(I'm gonna get my gun!)

[Verse 6: Bizarre]
Walk to Rite-Aid for a can of spaghetti
It's been one hour, bitch, my photos ain't ready
Pictures of my dog and my family reunion
It's been two hours and my fucking days ruined
Hey, Kate, do you wanna get raped
Have my pictures on fucking Philips 38
That's why I don't be fucking battle rapping
Cause every time I lose, this what the fuck happens *Gunshots*
Back to the pictures I was trying to get developed
This man tried to get in front of me, I wouldn't let him
I'm ready to blow this bitch's brains out
I'm nervous, I farted, some shit came out
Times up, shot her with a gun
Got on my cellphone and called Reverend Run
And all this crazy shit, I regret it
All because I wanted to see Elton John naked"
Bitch,D12,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Eminem & Bizarre]
I always got something for the bitches
These bitches always be all, giggling and shit
But they get mad when their favorite song don't come on in the club
Catch an attitude and shit
So we got one for them, it goes like this

[Verse 1: Eminem]
We wrote a song for the hoes
You like to hear it, here it goes
A little something you probably won't hear on your radios
So when it comes on in the club it's one that everyone knows
And if I'm talking too fast it just means you're listening too slow
And if you listen a little faster maybe you'll catch up, bitch
Ju jah jah jah dah du ju jah, you just made me mess up, bitch
Blibiri babiler blabber, it don't matter, I'm just blabbering
Like you understand what I'm saying anyway
I'm just traveling in one ear and I'm out the other
You're so fucking drunk all you hear is the beat b-b-beat
I could be saying anything, just get your ass on the floor
Wear the same pants that you wore from the day before
Baby and shake that ass like a whore
[Hook: Eminem & Kon Artis]
Yeah, I'm talking to you, bitch
Get up and dance, bitch
Wiggle that ass, bitch
Yeah that's it, bitch
Yeah, I called you a bitch, bitch
What you going to do about it, bitch?
Sit there and cry like a little bitch, bitch
Get up and dance, bitch
Wiggle that ass bitch
You little trash, bitch
Yeah, that's it
Yeah, I called you a trash, bitch
Not trailer trash, switch
Take the person you with and exchange partner, bitch

[Verse 2: Swifty, Eminem]
Tell me that it ain't no hanging and fuck calling home
Until you look at me, before you answer the phone
When I flee, your ass can get naked and be as free
As you wanna be freak, but I'm taking the key with me
You ain't gonna get shit, so don't even ask
Disrespect my wishes (Bitch) I'll beat your ass
Watch me coming home full, eating half of your doggy bag
And I leave laughing, while you calling me on the rag
I'm the type that might cut off the lights when I hit
And before she cut them on, Kuniva already (Switched)
Your ass ain't even riding with Swift unless you're hoeing
When I'm done, I'll throw you out and ask you where you going
[Verse 3: Bizarre & Eminem]
Ho ain't the only thing you call a girl:
Slut, Tramp
Oh, how you doing, Sheryl?
Ever since I was eight I been starting to hate
I said fuck the hoes and started eating cheesecake
Scrambled eggs and steak, strawberries and grapes
Damn that sounds great, hold on wait... Bizzy!
Okay back to the bitches, wash the dishes after that
Give me stitches, a fucking half Indian chick, sucked my dick
This time tomorrow, I won't remember shit
Got respect for a player, got on snoop gators
And they ain't Now and Laters, bitch

Man, fuck both y'all niggas
See I was trying to be polite, stank ass trick
Oh, somebody's jacking off tonight

[Verse 5: Proof]
Oh you a bitch but don't choke
I say the same to my Momma

Shit, we banging Madonna
Watch her strip you on that ten bitch ain't got change for a dollar
Blow your tongue and give this one the mouth you came with a condom
Quick cum is the motto, so just swallow and breathe
Swallow and breathe, now swallow these seeds
I know you mocha lotti Mommies won't get down on your knees
You want some money honey damn you must be outta your weave
Hit the telly fuck her belly you ain't gotta go weak
Plus you wanna be a model you need a lot of more sleep
I'm a pimp bitch don't be shy, show me them big tits
Your lipstick, I want it smeared all on my limp dick
For instance, busting nuts is only my interest
So princess, don't get your feelings hurt cause men just
Party and bullshit till she gargle and swallow the dick
I'm taking the train to spain, don't bother calling me, bitch

We was talking bout you DODO
You, you dumb bitch! YOU! Haha

Echo,Bad Meets Evil,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
All around
The world there's an echo
As he takes
A bow, and they all know
All the girls, the boys
They chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo
Echo, echo, echo
They will follow the echo
Echo, echo

[Pre-Verse 1: Eminem]
It seems like no matter what I do, I just can't get away from them
Get away from what?
The voices
I can hear 'em callin', callin', callin', callin', callin' me

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I eat rappers, with the rhyme, consume 'em
The only fucking thing that you consume is time, I'm super human
My world is like a Rubik's Cube, it's too complex girl
You assuming, Cupid's looming, my mentality's caveman stupid woman
My life is Truman Show, all I have is music, ho
I stopped chasing every chick under the sun many moons ago, so pretend my dick is a balloon and blow
But you better put a fork in it if you think I’ma lay here just spooning, yo
Oh, you think you the shit 'cause I just said you was beautiful?
Diabolical to my last molecule, down to my last hair follicle and cuticle
Rotten to the core to the bone cold all the way down to my soul from my head to my toe
Ever since I was 13 I learned how to sew and sewed shut my own bootyhole
'Cause I ain't took no shit since I looked down to my nuts and saw my first pubic grow
I told these stupid hoes when I come back I’ma set this bitch on fire!
And this time I don't mean I'ma pour gasoline on some chick and light her
'Cause this time when I fuck this world I’ma put the whole goddamn dick inside her
I ain't even put my tip in that hole yet, I'ma go get Nickel and try to rip it wider
[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
All around
The world there's an echo
As he takes
A bow, and they all know
All the girls, the boys
They chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo
Echo, echo, echo
They will follow
The echo, echo, echo

[Pre-Verse 2: Royce da 5’9” & Eminem]
Shh!
Did you hear that? Somebody just said something
Is anybody there?
I can hear 'em callin', callin', callin', callin', callin' me

[Verse 2: Royce da 5’9”]
Classical poems, battle my own demons, I need a glass of Patron
Bad as I need a horn stabbing my clavicle bone, I'm matador prone
First time I seen a desert eagle I was letting the .44 buss, the .44 pop
The first time you seen one, you was eating coco puffs, looking at Robocop
I am not a man, I'm a logo, I'm a such thang
In order to clean my veins you need Saleen, I'm never referring to the solution, I’m talking about more like the Mustang
Vroom! Get respect from the get-go, hello! Step to the echo, echo, echo
Pen got a mind of its own, got to write my rhymes with a timer
Otherwise I’ll probably vibe out to a nine minute song
As the echo follows the Maserati, as the petrol swallows
I'm a thousand bodies away from a skeleton, check your Bible inside it
It'll say this guy's an elephant, I’m fly like I’m killing the scene like
I’m a villain with wings, I’ll sleep when I’m 6 feet deep
Right now I’m living a dream, though we may be reckless
The ladies check us, they whisper Shady Records, baby echo!
[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
All, around, the world, there's an echo
As, he takes, a bow, and they all know
All the girls, the boys, they chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo"

Ripping you to shreds, fucking up your tattoo
Break into your crib, take your records and plaques too

They catch me mingling by a bitch with class
When she turn I'll be sprinkling some shit in her glass (aahh)
What part of this you can't understand?
I'll emmilliate a man, worse then making a band
Don't be mistaking that man
He'll invite you over
Real fast, and pass your ass a glass of Ebola

Better get it through your brain
When you say my name
Never say it in vain 'cause I'm a psycho

[Verse 1: Swift]
I'm a motherfucking omen, I bow down to no man
Split a nigga open, killing folks compulsive
A soldier with a motive, scrotum big as boulders
I hold 'em then unload on you, put it on a poster
So everyone can notice who was focused on us poking
They nose in our business, hoping that I don't come smoke 'em
No one knows my notions or emotions, I'm a vulture
You niggas close to croaking any moment and I know when
I could fuck the culture up, probably rap
A maniac with anxiety attacks, I don't wanna chat
Speak when you spoken to
And I don't have to read a fucking magazine or quotable
To notice what you hoes will do
[Verse 2: Kuniva]
We all soldiers, we move as a unit, we all roll up
And show up at your residence, light your front door up
Get scared, life ain't fair
And I'm prepared to blast you just as fast as Dre can say ""Hell yeah!""
So watch what you say 'cause it can happen either today or the next minute
I can draw the heater and spray and I'm dead serious
You could be dead period, end of story
I'm on your porch with a gun and your son, sipping a forty
Nobody can hold me, I does it all by my lonely
I stomp your head when you awake, you be looking like Gumby

They found Saddam, but they ain't gon' find me
I'll be under a tree in Buttfuck, Tennessee
And I don't know too much about my daddy
Except he spit in my face and fucked me in the fanny
I ain't a racist, I just hate whites
Fags and dykes, blacks and transvestites
Thirteen years old and joined a fucking gang
Hair under my ass cheeks feeling the fucking pain
Am I insane? Who really knows?
'Cause any second my temper can fucking blow
I get colder than December
Black the fuck out, tomorrow won't even remember
See Bizarre can show you what violence is all about
And this Dr. Dre beat done brought it the fuck out
Run in your house and put a gun in your mouth
And blow your brains the fuck out!
[Verse 4: Eminem]
I probably got a screw loose or two
Or maybe three or four of 'em
Some fell out and hit the floor
All I know is ever since my fucking head hit the snowbank
I been a little neanderthalish, no thanks to my man D'Angelo Bailey
But I just take it slow daily, my biggest dilemma's
Trying to figure whether to use the flat head or the Phillips
Or just go to the Home Depot and pick the new power drill up
It's been two hours and six days and I'm still up
I feel like I'm about to snap any minute
There's a new Tower Records about to stop and get a fill-up
Pick the new Cypress Hill up
And go find who did that shit to Xzibit
And go fill up a whole liquor bottle with piss
And shatter his fucking lips with it

It feels like I've been drivin' for miles (Yeah)
I'm givin' up, baby
And I can't seem to silence these voices in my head (Yeah)
This time, won't you save me?
Come save me
This time, won't you save me?
Come save me

[Chorus]
This time won't you save me? This time won't you save me?
Baby, I can feel myself givin' up, givin' up
This time won't you save me? This time won't you save me?

Here I Am,Nicki Minaj,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Why is it that you could only see the worst in me?
I swear, sometimes, it feel like it nurtures me
But to keep it all real, it's kinda hurtin' me
I could say I'm done with it, but it lurks in me
So I'ma just tell myself that it works for me
Take a real long drive in the Mercedes
And I might pop a couple of them Percoce's
Yeah, that'll make me transform to Hercules

[Pre-Chorus]
I am who I am
Ah

[Chorus]
Here I am, here I am
So take me as I am
Here I am, here I am
So take me as I am
Here I am, here I am
So take me as I am
[Post-Chorus]
I am who I am
Ah

[Verse 2]
I swear to God, man, everything in life is old
And the only thing that changed is the price of gold
Even in the afterlife, I'ma fight your soul
'Cause the second time around, I'll be twice as bold
So do you take me to be who I am?
To have and to hold 'til death do us part?
'Cause if not, it's just best we both part
'Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start?
You got me thinkin' twice to just breathe (I am)
Then you say I won't survive if I leave (Who I am)
But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve (Ah)
I no longer need your attention, at ease

[Bridge]
It's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar
It's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar
Now it's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar
It's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar (Here I am)

Dear Old Nicki,Nicki Minaj,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Mmm, oh
Mmm
Yo

[Verse 1]
Maybe you died 'cause everybody ask me where you at
I tried to channel you in hopes that I could steer you back
But it's like every intersection we just missed each other
You got your fans waitin', tell me you ain't six feet under
And tell me that you comin' back and you just took a break
Maybe I blamed you for everything, that was my mistake
In hindsight, I loved your rawness and I loved your edge
'Cause it was you who talked me down from jumpin' off the ledge
Your earings bamboo, your long nails too
Your BMW every time you came through
You was the brave heart, you stole Wayne heart
You never switched it up, you played the same part
But I needed to grow, and I needed to know
Were there some things inside of me that I needed to show?
So I just deaded you, left you in all black
But dear old Nicki, please call back
[Chorus]
You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly, I believed you
But I'm standing here calling, I can't see you
But I am holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
To that

[Verse 2]
Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamour, money, fame, and power?
'Cause if so, that will forever go down my lamest hour
I shoulda kept you with me, gettin' at them nameless cowards
They was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess
I had to make them changes, I hope you understood
You see, for every bad, I did a ton of good
But you was underground and I was mainstream
I live the life now that we would daydream
My only wish is you come enjoy it with me
Get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me
The money came, yeah, I tripled and quadrupled it
But I still miss us when we was just on some stupid shit
And it's still fuck the media
They ridiculed you, never believed in ya
They just deaded you, left you in all black
But dear old Nicki, please call back

[Chorus]
You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly, I believed you
But I'm standing here calling, I can't see you
But I am holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
To that
[Outro]
And yes, I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
And yes, I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
And yes, I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
To that
And yes, I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
And yes, I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
And yes, I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you

Fresh
For 0 A.D
You SUCKERS!

[Verse 1: Soul Khan]
It took me 23 years just to write this verse
I felt the sum of all fears in a lightning burst
I was shaking at the window like Pookie with a Pipe
But there ain't no director when the movie is your life
Look for answers in The Book but it takes too long
And it ain't like Nina Simone can make new songs
They said if I speak my mind, I'll be despised
Stick to liquor punchlines, ass cheeks and thighs
But I'm just too potent
I get you open, like a flesh wound
Hopin that the fresh truths soak in
Oh, they got flow? Well I exhale oceans
How could they not know? They up the next male's colon
This is for the pipe dreamers with the nine-to-five fever
The hardest working fathers and the Friday night divas
I dedicate my resume to all my light sleepers
Who stay awake and wonder where the future might lead us"
Soulstice,Soul Khan,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
This is a letter to my older self
Do you remember how our shoulders felt
When she said she couldn't live without us
Or when our dad left the crib without us?
Same shock to the system, but a different outlet
Now you the champ like Hogan with the golden belt
Premium octane grade to make the motor melt
In other words, you the rap Franklin Roosevelt
Portfolio sick as polio corroded cells
This is a letter to the man that I'll be one day
You're worth more than what your IRS refund pay
Tax bracket got you acting like you athsmatic, coughin' it up
God damn doesn't mass transit cost you enough?
Did you have a child, what'd you name him or her?
For their mother's sake, I hope you ain't similar
Just playing, you the perfect mold
To turn a soul into what it needs to be when you up in the dirt
This is a letter to soul khan
The shepherd of protons
You beat the game but never with codes on
Summer's on its way and the album approaches
So please let me welcome all y'all to the Soulstice
[Hook x 2]
From month to month, and moon to sun
Now the winds of change move through your lungs
It's a force of nature you've become
The soulstice is here

[Verse 2]
I'm from the home of one season, they take warmth for granted
It's a beautiful morning in the great north Atlantic
This is your life now, so please claim your baggage
Sorta like peter north, I came for the cabbage
That's real talk to the A-L-K
I've had people lie to me when they say they'll stay
Til I snapped at the seams, and I packed all my dreams
And traveled to the capital to pave the way
I am the truth, unequivocal, no motive to lie
I am the answer without even proposing a ""why""
I am the filament that charges the bulb in the sky
I've touched lives so I'll never be alone when I die
Now this a little more simple than I usually spit
So I scribbled this soon as an opportunity hit
Sometimes I feel like maybe I'm too stupid to quit
But I ain't following whereever they been moving this shit

What the Beat,DJ Clue?,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Method Man]
Niggas is like ""Oh My God! Not you!""
Yes! I'm in the flesh like hollow heads through your vest
No contest, M.E.-Eth Man's obsessed
With sex, drugs and rock & roll, new TECs and calicos!
Word has it we move mathematic on rappers who don't add up
You get broke, battered and slapped up
8 million stories in the Nekkid, call yo' man Method
Straight guerrilla, iller nigga kill a murder record
My verbal shooter does it to ya
The 16-bar Ruger, bustin' yo' funky dope maneuvers
But I'm not ya Super Lover Cee, I'm the Super Sperm
Splash it on your skin, rub it in like it's Lubriderm
10 outta 10, I be the men of all men, I mean the
Crème de la crème or schemer, sippin' on 'Gnac and Zima
True, Professional 2 (DJ Clue!)
Now that Bush is president, nigga, we all through! (Word!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Yeah, it's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
Why I keep on duckin' under the bed when I hear thunder
'Cause I ain't crazy, I say shit that's crazy to crazy people
To make 'em believe I'm crazy, so they can relate to me
And maybe believe in Shady, so they can be evil, baby, I like that!
I'm only as crazy as people made me
Believe me, they'd be just as many mutherfuckin' murderers
And heroin users without Marilyn's music
But I figure, I make my music, I don't care if you use it
To murder somebody, I just wanna be there when you do it!
Now the parents are suin'
'Cause little Darren is screwin' Karen and Susan
'Cause I told him to do it on Clue's new shit
Now it's all ruined, the whole world is fucked up
'Cause of me, two 12-year old girls is knocked up
My attitude's 'Fuck it!' like Pac's was at one point
Wanna come join? Pick up a Glock and just point
Now everybody's killin' everybody and everybody's bloody
And I'm just laughin' like it's funny
'Cause I don't really give a shit about no-motherfuckin'-body
I'm so motherfuckin' nutty, I don't give a fuck about nothin'!
[Verse 3: Royce da 5'9""]
My wrist is water and freezer mix
This is Audio Jesus, the repent shit gets big
Keep a sharp-like knife in a pop device
So ""Duro, you gotta let it bump!"", I came from a hard knock life
They say this kid be rude like this can't be true
I'll suck my own dick like if I had a rib removed
Vampire, sun go down, I'm still wildin'
Bullets travel through the Air In The Night like Phil Collins
Rock City, baby, knife through your throat 'til you're broke
Rise from the underground like sewer smoke
It's all shifty, I got all of my dogs with me
And they all rich, and still all of they palms itchy
We'll pump, rumble over birds, jungle urge
Walkin' like we talkin' drunk, while we stumble over words
Clue *inhale*

Hold up, breath!

Chop chop the block, then cock the Glock

While we bake the cake, then brake the plate

Cause we B-A-L-L-I-N what I'm known fo knockin down yo stone do'

Talkin' bout my business deals and my sprint phone wit icons
If you thank you sho they hold on cause Mr. Lucci puttin in work
Candy apple below the seal wit a wood wheel sittin on some skirts

There they go, motherfucker there they go
When we comin down the lane grippin grain let 'em hang what they sayin
Where they go, motherfucker where they go

Bendin corners on twanky twak

Poppin pills blowin doja

To the snipe nigga wit a double scope
Tha wrong words might cost yo throat

Big wheels and a 100 spokes
Big ball points still cash flow
Slang north star like lasso
Small joints we pass doe
Gettin how we live tho
The wind blow wit my cash flow
When we comin around the block
Ima drop the top and let my grill show

My Glock a frind when I roll in
When a cup of henn and my blue benz
Gutted out on 2 10's
Wit brake lite in the rear fen

Holdin while I'm rollin
Twink twink on my pink pink
Puff puff on the good green
Now how the hell you feel when we ridein shinein in the place
Diamondz all up in yo face

Stand up straight and make way for these for these mothafuckin trill niggas

I could've been had fame
Jump shot with a stupid-ass aim
'Cause you couldn't get around the last name
So my cross-over wins the last game
And it's ill, right?
Switched up the flow, but it's still right
Go back to that, yeah, I still might
I'ma just do me when it feel right
Uh, you could bring it any day
Natural bad-ass, NBA
That's my initials, that's why officials
Don't blow the whistle, bang-bang the pistol
A-a-and I'm bossy
Can't keep these hoes up off me
Damn, the flow nasty, coffee
Don't you do like the Pope and cross me

Yeah, this is my last chance (Oh)
Last chance (Oh)

I get it in though
No sexual innuendo
Nobody that I could just depend on
Until I touch down in the end zone
And then they come out like roaches
P-p-pecking away like vultures
But little did they know, distribute the payroll
Pick out the outfit, pick out the single
Sadly, I'm so business savvy
Similar protocol, but the tidbits vary
Never been like me, ain't never been like this
My flow's a crisis, they screamin' high pitch
Uh, gun cock, pause
And I'm well aware of the gun laws
Tell 'em that I'm gunnin' for the top, Forbes
Headed to the top, dot org

Yeah, this is my last chance (This is my last chance)
Last chance (Oh yeah, yeah)

Only one chance, one bullet in the gun (I'm ready to shoot)

Then he kicked me out the line, yeah he punted on me
Well look, I’m back, bitch, back with an attitude
Buyin' out the bar, 'cause I feel like this the shit I gotta prove

Remember when I did a show with Waka Flocka Flame
Felt naked 'cause the boy rocked about a thousand chains
Guess we rock a lot of ice 'cause we got a lot of pain
Thats five hundred years of swellin', I’m tryna tell 'em
Jacob the Jeweler is cooler now that he a felon
Jay put a stamp on the nigga but wouldn’t mail him
If he couldn't sell him, so what that tell him, huh?

That pussy from the back I'm a get it
I'm walking over to ya with the rubber (oooh)
Your ass in trouble (Is it up high enough?)
I done caught your bluff
Fuck you until you cry {*girl moans*}
You said I beat that pussy from back so much that I hurt yo side
Yo ass should have been built for the war (yeah) Fuck it!
And if you don't want to wear your tail
You need to put it in your ass and tuck it
I whispered, just to get you in the bed
And now I'm fixing to pull your hair on your head (pull it)
Shouldn't've fucked with me, should you?
If your ass could've ran you would've
But you put that there a side
That's how my dick got between your thighs
Now that's all right
I got a ten foot pole
That'll go in your hole
Take yo soul
Make nut come out yo nose
Fall all on yo clothes

I know I may be young, but I’ve got feelings too
And I need to do what I feel like doing
So let me go and just listen

[Verse 1]
All you people look at me like I’m a little girl
Well, did you ever think it'd be okay for me to step into this world?
Always saying, ""Little girl, don’t step into the club""
Well, I’m just tryna find out why, 'cause dancing’s what I love, yeah (Now watch me)

Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh

[Verse 2]
I know I may come off quiet, I may come off shy
But I feel like talking, feel like dancing when I see this guy
What’s practical? What's logical? What the hell, who cares?
All I know is I’m so happy when you’re dancing there
[Chorus]
I’m a slave for you
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it

Getting High,Mr. Lucci,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Let me take another choke of the reefa smoke
I gotta roll up another and another
Like a dime or a double I'm on houble
Like I'm I am floatin on a bubble(hmmn)
Ain't no trouble wit me rollin the bink
The only trouble wit me is my holdin the bink
Cause when I blaze I hate, I parlay all day
Wit my niggas who can't plus a dozen of sweets
Now mary jane is my love that I keep
The only one that show  when she creep
The only one that I know where she sleep
The only one that can blow like a freak
The only one that can hold my piece (fo real dough)
24/7 gettin twisted and blowed, blowin cakes til my lungs explode
Lettin the good green indo flow threw my lips then out my nose
Pullin sweets and optimos thru my ho dressed in the finer clothes
When the bitch nigga flexed up
She  call me slow then she tells me go
I don't know what I'd do without the blazins of my flamin boo
Through my arm steady, keepin my game in tru
Keep a nigga steady clamin you
I admit keep nigga spendin number while they changin you
When the bags gone in we threw
Or betta yet when the bags gone when we begin
On a hunt for another session wit a fella Texan
Where it's 10 to get in
All day & night she just hold me tight
Like pit bull bike, like a g&fight
I can't see it no other way
But me and Mary Jane alone without a joke let's ride!
[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Smoke wit me, that indo weed, that hennessy
Let's get high, touch the sky
Smoke wit me, that indo weed, that hennessy
Let's get high, touch the sky

See I'm the type that a grab the weed & roll it up solo Johnson fool
Cause everday situations got me lost me in amazing shit
Now I'm wishin I was back in school, I mma break the rules
Smokin weed everyday of my life
And heavenly or everyday that is trife
I be the crook in the night
When my took a look at our life
And found mary as a bigga delight
So baby take swing to the right
And let me kiss you smoove
Leavin my niggas down wit the things you do
I don't care that you be fuckin wit them niggas is cool
But later on tonight it'll be me and you
Got no time to prove how deep is my love
For ya bout as deep as the seeds grow
But let me tell you something
I been knockin down dos for ya
Pistol pack where the weed ho
Hit the sweet and I'm blowed
In my superior mode
Playa I've been on the grind tryna get it grind cuz i live it
Cool, calm, relaxed, straight, and while I'm straight
Make a playa feel like he chillin the whole day
And feelin it all day
Mary Jane to the brain I'm in love wit ya
You know you need to spend a dub wit ya
Plus I know you really love mista
So won't you put me on the level like you do all the bud niggas

In the glass house smoked out movin it slow
Don't smoke don't stress no mo

Get my mind stir fried like a vegetable
Puff puff til my lungs explode
Now I'm gone in my own zone, country slow

Cuz she prevoke the choke
And leave me fucked up singin a note

Zero options to choose
Living in a box full of Cuyahoga blues, and listen
I stayed away from reading The Plain Dealer
Most of my niggas back in Cleveland were plain dealers, uh
Who whipped Supremes, the candy-painted eyes
But the love from the boppers had 'him watchin they rise
Wasn't no love for a nigga in the smug
Sipping out a cup, a concoction for cruising
High off life? My nigga, not even
I'ma go to war with the Devil 'til we're even
Bobbing and weaving, spiritual hymn singing
No commentary my man, I come out swinging
And this will be the song that we sing
Any young nigga with visions when he's sleeping

Tell Me A Story,Robert Penn Warren,[],"[ A ]

Long ago, in Kentucky, I, a boy, stood
By a dirt road, in first dark, and heard
The great geese hoot northward

I could not see them, there being no moon
And the stars sparse. I heard them

I did not know what was happening in my heart

It was the season before the elderberry blooms
Therefore they were going north

The sound was passing northward

[ B ]

Tell me a story

In this century, and moment, of mania
Tell me a story
Make it a story of great distances, and starlight

The name of the story will be Time
But you must not pronounce its name

Tell me a story of deep delight"
The Emperor of Ice Cream,Wallace Stevens,[],"Call the roller of big cigars,
The muscular one, and bid him whip
In kitchen cups concupiscent curds.
Let the wenches dawdle in such dress
As they are used to wear, and let the boys
Bring flowers in last month's newspapers.
Let be be finale of seem.
The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.

Take from the dresser of deal,
Lacking the three glass knobs, that sheet
On which she embroidered fantails once,
And spread it so as to cover her face.
If her horny feet protrude, they come
To show how cold she is, and dumb.
Let the lamp affix its beam.
The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream."
He Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven,William Butler Yeats,[],"Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths
Enwrought with golden and silver light,
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
Of night and light and the half-light,
I would spread the cloths under your feet:
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
I have spread my dreams under your feet;
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams."
Pencil,GZA,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: GZA]
The echo chamber enhance the flow with the block party
Keep an MC head spinning like Dark Bacardi
This B.A.C. is 2.3
Now the liver's damaged, but his lungs are joint free
So inhale, exhale, breathe and get well
Kick something live stop chirping like Nextel
I'm All In Together, a swordsman forever
I paint the town red, with many heads are severed
R-A-W, I still bring trouble to
Throw your raps in the sleephold, quick to smother you
Dart hit your breastplate, meet ya death date
Rook down a E4, look, it's checkmate
No other way describe it but catastrophe
The plan was drawing blood and displayed it graphically
Direct order, hit the border, then slaughter
Horrific torture, by prolific authors
Shape and mold MC's, like I'm playing the skelly top
It's getting 'hot in here' like the single that Nelly dropped
So take ya clothes off, the track is so soft
A little vodka turn 'em into Ivan Koloff
Why do the Gods make MC's study from
Thirty five, and fifty year, then try to become
Under the study with the sword above the head
So he would keep in mind under the open pledge
[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
Fierce glisten, something so sharp
Piercing, swords cling, the vigilante intimate
Close combat, this is emceeing at its best
But there is no contest, sent I'm this
Speaking of a test, this and try to question this
He so different with the swiftness, godfather civilization
Shell casing, universal nation
Could he be the one predicted, presidential sent in
Old school soul survivors, we the wildest
Asiatic Arctic flow is so frigid

[Verse 3: RZA]
Is it, the Zig Zag, I'ma pay you a visit
Somehow mistake me as an old wise wizard
Word? I'm not the same
I go somewhere, don't remember how I came
Is it the weed, the hash or the 'caine?
Or the Digi being stained on my brain
Appear from a cloud of smoke, your throat is on choke
If surrounded, seven men drop from one stroke
Even if my feet was shackled down to one handcuff
To defeat me, ten demons wouldn't be enough
I sleep in the lion's den, without the steel iron
Ascended like Musa coming down from Mt. Zion
Superlogical this, superlogical that
Digital, take it back with superlogical rap
Have a shootout, at midnight, the sequel's quicker
Forty four colt jolt, all you seen was the flicker
You distress like the damsel, lost like little 'Hansel'
Your flame couldn't generate the heat of a candle
Me, I be a Killa Bee, keeping exilery
Ol' play the desert e, shoot ten millime'
Master the millipede, you try to end the sea
Your body being found in the naval yard artillery
A black blind governor, a rich white mayor
Man, this whole city ain't got a prayer
Bobby has invaded, now the whole town's slated
Your decapitated head is being tooken out paraded
Up and down the avenue, I drive a shatterproof
Benz, and all my men's are tattle proof
My mic is a dyke, my life is a light
A Day to God is a Thousand Years, how long is a night?
You get trapped in my shadow of dark, hark, who goes there?
Power-U smells like carp, don't put your nose there
Drop you to a tank of sharks, your wound's bleeding
And it's been two weeks since they had their last feeding
Any leftover bones, we grind into sand
And spread it out, over 20 acres of land
Some call me Steels, 'cause it's hard to bend me
See Cipher Pigs can't apprehend me
In a no smoking zone, I smoke bones of hash
Niggas see me, then I disappear in the flash
Next time I'm spotted, I got the fatter wallet
Moving with a clique that stick like dry porridge
Someone's been sitting in my chair, who goes there?
To sub zero cold, your words can't flow here
Glaciers of ice, plus layers of spice
Say your prayers at night, 'fore you touch that mic"
Aston Martin Music,Wale,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","In life, I think our aspirations should guide us

As far as being hard, I feel I’m somewhere near Medusa

Yo, yo, fuck 2DopeBoyz and fuck Nah Right
And any other fuck-nigga-ass blog that can't put an 18 year old nigga
Making his own fucking beats, covers, videos and all that shit
Fuck you post-Drake-ass cliche-jerking, LA-Slauson rapping
Fuck-nigga-ass Hypebeast niggas, now back to the album

[Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
Well, Tyler, hi, I'm Dr. TC and um, I'm guessing that your teacher sent you here to talk 'cause you were misbehaving
Um, it's gonna be three sessions: today, tomorrow, and the next day
So, just tell me something about yourself...
Well, look, if, if you don't talk, I mean, these sessions are going to go slower, so-

[Verse 1]
This is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep
Some food for thought? This food for death, go 'head and fucking eat
My father's dead, well, I don't know, we'll never fucking meet
I cut my wrist and play piano 'cause I'm so depressed
Somebody call the pastor, this bastard is so possessed
This meeting just begun, nigga, I'm Satan's son
[Verse 2]
My mother raised me, a single parent, so it's apparent
That I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckers
Are much important, I'm getting angrier while recording
I'm feeling like the bulls, I've got a gang of wolves
Odd Future is children that's fucked up in they mental
Simple, but probably not, fuck em

[Verse 3]
I'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck
Drunk white girls: the only way I'll get my dick sucked
Suspended from school, coolest nigga without effort
Easy to spot, like black bitches with fake leopard
Soak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on
'Cause this album pack enough evil
That you can't fit inside a Jansport
Go to school with this

[Verse 4]
I go from AP to JC inside a fucking week
Waking up with random girls like ""Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?""
I stay with grandma, she always bitching about her carpet
Every time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit
No to drugs, I never spark it, I used to be bullied for honor classes
By those that were slow as molasses
Take this shit to school
[Verse 5]
Raquel treat me like my father, like a fucking stranger
She still don't know I made ""Sarah"" to strangle her
Not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler
All because she said no to homecoming, demons running
Inside my heads telling me evil thoughts
I'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares are caught, go to sleep

[Verse 6]
I wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky
""Fuck me,"" the monster said, somehow the monster's dead
Inside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil
With this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble
I'm on my grind feeble, my music is either
A fucking sin or too illegal, play this shit in church

[Verse 7: Tyler, The Creator, Dr. TC]
I graduated without honors or fucking father
He died (I'm so sorry) No bitch, don't even fucking bother
I wanted a brother, my mother I told her
But instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada
So both of our imaginations are creations of the fucking situation
That's having our brains racing like Dayton
Wearing some fucking Heelys

[Verse 8]
I know you fucking feel me, I want to fucking kill me
But times I'm so serious, you think I'm silly
I'm doing Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11
Seven, what's religion nigga? I am legend
I roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition
I created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented
Than 40 year old rappers talking about Gucci
When they have kids they haven't seen in years
Impressing their peers
With the same problem, the only way to solve them
Is to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver
Life's a salad, I'm a toss it, eat that shit up, Rick Ross it
Shit it out, bag it up, sell it, I'm so damn rebellious
Cause my mother let me do what I want
She wasn't careless, protective she is the bear
The shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid
My father didn't give a fuck, so it's something I inherit
My mom is all I have so it's never meet the parents
When Danielle or Milan decide to fucking share
This confused boy, I wanna hug, oy
I’m bad for your kids to listen to, soy is not the choice
I'm bad milk, drink it
[Interlude: Dr. TC]
Whoa, umm, it seems you had a lot to say
Uh, who knows I might feel as I'm evaluating

[Verse 9]
My wrist is all red from the cutter
Dripping cold blood like the winter, the summer
Is never that's equivalent to me and Sarah
Well that's not her fucking name, but I think this shit is clever
My niggas wanna know if I'm fucking, if I'm kissing
But I'm sitting here downing beers simply just wishing
With a tear they try to tell me but I never listen
'Cause I don't give a shit like sitting down pissing
Eighteen, still talking to imaginaries
Hopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy
Losers can never win me, you can never offend me
My goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully mom'll attend the
Ceremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal
This my Zombie Circus, I hope the majors heard this
Fuck a deal, I just want my father's email
So I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail

Wow, umm
So, Tyler, if you had the chance to tell him something
What would you tell him?"

And they like when a nigga say hahn (hahn!)
Play a nigga song like hahn (hahn!)
Cause we keep coming wit the shit ya like
I say you got that right?
You got that right
Niggas stay crunk like hahn (hahn!)

On 106 and Park screaming hanh! (hanh!)
We was on Spring Bling screaming hanh! (hanh!)

Even next year we still gonna scream hanh! (hanh!)
When we take the description of the song
Just cause we make it a jingle
That don't mean its a get along
See we make it like this
So you can learn it quicker
And find out why we ain't concerned with niggas
The twins and we quicker than little nigga
We quicker to drill a nigga
We jump up on a stage and kill a nigga
They wishing that they crowds would feel them nigga
The way me and my mans and them nigga (x4)
Scream hanh! (hanh!)
Till you can't no more
After that start stomping the flo'
Kinda like you got the holy ghost
Get crunk, start doing your thing
Get up, start doing your thing (hanh!)

We Love Logistics,Nadia Ackerman,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro - Guy]
Logistics makes the world work better

[Verse 1 - Nadia Ackerman]
When it's planes in the sky
For a chain of supply
That's logistics
When the pipes for the line
Come precisely on time
That's logistics
A continuous link
That is always in sync
That's logistics
Carbon footprint's reduced
Bottom line gets a boost
That's logistics
With new ways to compete
There will be cheers on Wall Street
That's logistics
When technology knows
Right where everything goes
That's logistics
Bells will ring, ring-a-ding
Ring-a-ding ring-a-ding
That's logistics
There will be no more stress
Cause you called UPS
That's logistics"
Ghetto Strain,Mr. Mike,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Tales of a lost soul
Gotta stay in control

[ Hook ]
My ghetto strain bring mysery
Gotta feel the pain physically
To gain anything spiritually

[ VERSE 1: Mr. Mike ]
It's a cold game, I see my folks slain
Right in front of the crib, the house
Brothers runnin they mouth, the southern route
Little church dude trippin, sayin my mama shout
It hurts, fool, knowin that's that pressure built up from the house
That she had to let it out, so much they said about
The life of me, Mr. M-i-k-e
Hit you where eyes can't see
Up in my time to leave
Ghetto kids yellin, ""Where we live we grindin these streets""
Hard to breathe, in times like these, my eyes I squeeze
To stop tears from fallin when my peers be callin
Young player, you're starvin ballin
And they wonder why we get high
I hope to see my people in the sky
[ VERSE 2: Mr. Mike ]
It's like a lion, dragon, and beast
I'm high, a scavenger peeps
His eyes on the prize, bring these rhymes from the street
Define my homie's life, fell to the game, well painted stripes
And earn the age, what a way, hell, paid the price
Tales of a lonely knight, they walk up on you, right?
Never knowin fright, the darkest corners where I learned to fight
People ain't concerned with right, they rather be about the game
Persuin me and doin me, never takin it light
[ Napp-1 ]
That's why I switch up women and cars every three months
Wanna kill me or what? Push my pawns to the front
Plus suckers bustin me, testin me, as a kid been stressin
]From my flesh on to my soul in, how could I win?
Lord, is they really my friends? And why I ain't got no ends?
Don't mean to question my faith, too much excitment in this paper chase
I stay laced with game, but nobody knows my name
Workin hard at this rap shit, I'm glad I adapted

[ VERSE 3: Napp-1 ]
Dressed to kill, a million dollar-bill in front of your face
Game laced, disappear without a trace
Who am I? Action, v.i.p. right through your backdo'
A dog in sheep's clothing, could you ask for mo'?
What is they blastin fo'? Lower the casket do'
Somebody killed my little homie right in front of the sto'
[ Mr. Mike ]
It's like we lost touch, the millenium niggas crossed up
Stupid mistakes that others made taught us
Jealousy feels, heavenly steel, just a frail way
A felon who you can deal, then dash in the ghetto way
Car or van or truck, man, the rush
I'm standin up, yes, I'm standin up
The only man in the house at five years old
Take out the trash, wipe my sister and hide my clothes
Time unfolds, my rhyme's like a treasure of old
The pleasure, the pain, the principle of havin this dough

Uh-huh uh, the saga continues...
Motion picture shit

[Verse]
I'm done talking
Ran up in the spot gun smoking
Shot it in the air, one woke him
Son soaking, sweating in his bed like dun' loc'in!
Thinking to himself what done provoked him
His thoughts is racing like a Vulcan
I swear I saw a light bulb when
He finally realized who was the culprit
I said yeah, remember me from Friend or Foe when
I told you don't ever ever come around here no more
Time to pay now, you try to rise, I wave the gun - lay down
This time you're really going to listen to Jay now
I try to talk sensibly, hoping that eventually you realize
I had this locked and it just wasn't meant to be
Plus I had sympathy when we all bought rims with your keys
And it was an afterthought that maybe you'll try to avenge me
But I was like ""Nah"", Homes had to know he was wrong
And if you caught me on the foul now you sing me the same song
Plus you promised
And that's really no fun
And here I find you in this Motel 6 with all these guns
And all your goons, lined up in adjoining rooms
Like some wild cowboys coming to get me at high noon
But my mind's like a flower in bloom
Peep how my eyes just scour the room
I'm alert, plus I paid the clerk I got it laid out
You think you the first nigga I played out, in a two-hotel town?
Come on now, I peeped your Lexus as you
Left the exit got some niggas on that side of the town
Money well invested, rudely interrupted
Jamaican accent (Boy you know who you dun fucked with?)
A gun in your face and that's all you can come up with?
I'm done talking, back up and clap him, one in the abdomen
Do me a favor duke, get two ice cubes I pass them
Take that ice up, for the nicest MC
And please yo, tell BIG, he's unbelievable

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, this is where the fathers ain't livin', least not with us
Might see 'em round the city and won’t even say wassup
When niggas play tough, won't even smile in mirrors
And we learn to fuck hoes off trial and error
Just a small town nigga, big city hustle
Glued to the TV, Jigga, Diddy, Russell
These were our heroes, strictly for them zeros
For that Robert De Niro, niggas reload on them kilos, uh
Dodgin them people, mad at myself 'cause
I done seen some things that I’d rather not tell
Shawty smoke crack and her boyfriend too
And sometimes, he touch her daughter how them boyfriends do
Pull up to the club where my boys went too
See that yellow tape and the boys in blue
A nigga on a stretcher, and though I never met you
I'm thinkin', ""God bless you, the city tryna get you""
[Bridge: J Cole]
Man, don’t let the city get you
Fuck the horoscopes, know the ropes like a wrestler
If them bullets wet you, bet your mama need a tissue
Your face on the front of our shirts, screaming, ""We miss you""

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Come with me
Run quick see
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?
Da da-da-da, da da da da
Come with me (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
Run quick see (Da-da da-da da-da)
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?
Da da-da-da, da da da da

[Verse 2: Omen]
Yeah, now see God, I know you only do what's best for me
But is it cool if we negotiate my destiny?
They always tellin’ me it’s temporary
Then why it's feelin' like a cemetery? My dreams ain't got no obituaries
My city hurtin' and none of us well-equipped here
You heard me say I was ballin’, I probably meant tears
I’m tryna get clear
I’m tryna quit fear, who wrote the scripts here?
These kids live their whole life just killing time
Running the race with no finish line
They tryna noose us with they ropes, but I'm finna climb
I think my foolish pride might become my suicide
But I ain't tryna go, no, baby
And through these lines and quotes you gotta find some hope
'Cause I ain't dying, my words gon’ last forever
You can hold the treasure, look inside, see a diamond in my mind
I'm tired of seeing dope fiends wiping they nose clean
Is my neighborhood just a smokescreen?
I think I'm in the dungeon fam, I see low green
Sons raised by both queens but it's no kings
[Chorus: J. Cole]
Come with me
Run quick see
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?
Da da-da-da, da da da da
Come with me (Da-da, da-da, da-da)

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
It seems like niggas either feel you or they tryna kill you
I face the sky and hope that God ain't acting unfamiliar
You play whatever cards he deal no matter how peculiar
They tell me that it's God’s will, I’m asking ""God, will ya
Heal a nigga from all this pain?"" Mama smokin' cocaine
As it rains out, am I to blame? Try to stay sane
So I came outside where they rock with them thangs out
To clear my mind, the same time they blew that boy brains out
But will it change? It's like niggas is free
But our minds still in the chains, brothers killing each other
The blood spill, it's a shame, will it ever slow up?
A lot of niggas getting older, but they never grow up
And do they sons like they fathers did and never show up
No need to cry about it, just another episode of
Life, watch the whole season, nigga, no reruns
The devil out here buying souls, nigga, no refunds, huh
[Bridge: J. Cole]
Man, don’t let the city get you
Fuck the horoscopes, know the ropes like a wrestler
If them bullets wet you, bet your mama need a tissue

Another day, another song
A mother prays, another gone
But still we play, like ain't nothing wrong

Yeah, I'm one of them pretty rappers
Buck if I really have to, I really slap you
King of Detroit, who they namin' the city after
Scandalous partners whose grammar hammers the hard shit
Into your heart with content, yo, who wanna start with?
Expert, Bad & Evil is comin' soon
MCs get stuck, head first back in they mother's womb
This shit is written, in my eyes I'm the illest MC spittin'
Leavin' all of you cats shittin' kittens
I gotta diss you, my niggas be cockin' pistols
Shot and split you, fuck splittin' the profits with you
Six percent of y'all niggas is just pretend
Cliques with clits, pussy niggas stink with dicks
Niggas act bully and blast for the fast penny
My auto is fully, plenty of niggas packin' semi
Speak darts — yo, you get paid?
Rhymin' about it is the sweet part
You can't be street smart with a cheap heart
5'9"", a street nigga with deep feelin'
I keep illin', my steez willin' to keep killin'
Fuck rap! A lot of y'all all is just acts
Trust that, you rhyme all wack on rough tracks
Bust and then we all black when you get bust back at
Fuck that, you get blast at, you get laughed at
And I'ma spit thunder, stick to my guns
Niggas is finished before they gimmicks: one-hit wonders
What? Big balls, that's why when I spit, your clique stalls
I'm a pitbull, I'm just dog, I'm just raw
Split y'all, holler, ""It's on!"" – then I diss y'all

The one man on the planet that'll drive off of the Grand Canyon
Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstandin'
Any man plannin' to battle'll get snatched outta his clothes
So fast it'll look like an invisible man standin'
I'm headed for Hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
Bill Clinton, hit this — and you better inhale!
‘Cause any MC that chooses to go against me
Is gettin' taken advantage of, like Monica Lewinsky (Leave me alone!)
Came home in a frenzy, pushin' a ten speed
Screamin' to Aunt Peg
With three spokes stickin' outta my pant leg
Fuck a headache! Give me a migraine, damn it, I like pain
You should be anywhere that a mic ain't
You rap knowin' you wack
You act up and I'm throwin' you down a flight of steps
Then I'm throwin' you back up them
If they don't like the track, fuck 'em! The rap struck 'em
Harder than gettin' hit by a Mack truck and then backed up on
And any half-assed known rapper to trespass
Better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly
I'm sicker than a 2Pac dedication to Biggie
I'm free-fallin' feet first out of a damn tree
To stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath
I'ma climb the Empire State Building
And get to the last step and still have half left

Beast Mode,B.o.B,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse]
I really don't know how long I been doing this shit
I guess 2010's the first year that you gave a shit
I was the underdog, so please excuse me a bit
I need some space so someone please make me some room in this bitch
'Cause I’m in beast mode, feast mode
Gimme those beats, I eat those
All day I don’t sleep, no, I don’t even know what I got sheets for
Them pillowcases and bed frames, oh no, take that, don’t need those
So high I don’t get high, I don’t even know what I got weed for
People, I’m in beast mode, why’d you think I got these teeth for?
Why do I rep that east side and why do they all call me B.O.?
But see, I knew this beat before anybody fed my ego
Back in the hood at east shows, so we take hood wherever we go
Please know, I am as loyal as loyalty is when it’s gave
Dedicated, determined, dependable
Yes, I committed myself to the game
Don’t be letting them tell you them lies
We make the industry real when it’s fake
So stay meditating so your head is facing
Into the direction that you aim, bitch
Okay then, know what my name is
Excuse my language but I’m fed up with the same shit
They say they love me, but it's really 'cause I’m famous, see
My momma told me this back when I was nameless
So fuck y’all, I’m shameless, I’m a beast unleashed, I’m raging
I’m living inside of this Matrix, this video game that I’m playing
I ride around and they praise me, I crack a smile and they waving
I guess you could call me David Ruffin
I’m circled in the temptations, huh
Or maybe I’m angry, maybe I just need a little more patience
Or maybe I’m crazy, maybe I just get a little too anxious
Sometimes I rhyme like I’m inside Einstein's mind
Look at the time fly by, plenty of times I died
Looking at these jive guys claiming they lost they mind
You ain't really seen shit, nigga
Till you had the whole world flipped upside down
Right side up from the DEC so the Eastside’s up
Fired up so you know
When I get to the booth I go ham, cause I gotta do what I can
So I’m like ""kadoish, kadoish, kadoish, Adonai Tsebayoth"" I chant
I’m kinda like a blur with these words
Guess I'm more absurd with these verbs
Running at a hundred kilometers, man
Pretty soon I’ma leave Earth
Earthlings, or whatever, human beings
I’m a beast, you're a feast, curly fries, onion rings
This is not a fucking game, ain't no referee’s involved
This is military combat soldiers standing guard round my yard
Entourage, ham squad to be exact
Smoking ham, smacking back
Take your girl, have her back
We don’t want her round my team
She’s a slut and she’s a freak
But you don’t know cause she’s discreet
I swear I see everything that's a bit
Man I’m fed up to my neck with the stress
I could use a wish; Hayley, where you at?
I guess the only exception to these girls is that I rap
But I only attack
'Cause I’m in beast mode, just beast mode
Everybody know that I’m a motherfucking monster
Monster... Energy Drink shoulda been my sponsor
But sometimes I wonder, what is this race I run for
I give a fuck about numbers so I do find it ironic
These niggas get mad at me
Talking all sideways with they eyes glazed
They mad cause I’m straight, what the mind sees, the eyes say
And they say that I went pop and the streets say I ain't hip hop
Well if it's not, then the shit stop"

Okay, I'm talking 'bout a good girl gone bad
Crooked world, wrong path; right Mom, wrong Dad
I sing this song mad but not mad enough to shoot you
But it just eats me up, like some barbecue from Luther's
In the morning with the roosters
On the corner with the boosters
And she's the fresh-cut and they're on her, like sutures
And I wanna talk to her, but her momma has to school her
I wanna see her better, she's the weather of my future
I don't wanna see another hurricane
Baby, you can kill the pain
If you just let me explain, trust me, I know what I'm sayin'
You will end up on the track of an on-comin' train
Stuck in the passenger seat, travelin' through the fast lane

Well, once upon a time there was a mom and a dad
Who on the outside, had everything people wished they had
A beautiful daughter, two-story house, two-car garage
And a white picket-fence wrapped around the front yard
See, Daddy was a doctor and Mommy was a banker
Mommy's job got outsourced, so now Mommy's a dranker
Daddy had a malpractice suit, now he's a snorter
And all this shit is takin' place right in front of the daughter
She says, ""Daddy, what's wrong?"", but he's just too high
""Mommy, what we gon' do?"", she just get drunk and cry
Caught in the middle of two wrongs, tryin' to do right
Looking for answers all alone in the darkness of night
Shit ain't right

I'm heard of, from China to Europe
Every summer, I turn up, like turnips
My glory, my honor, my courage

I put this thing in gear, now they primal fear it
Im so near it they can smell it, (*sniff*) teenage spirit

I know you like that, you want to try that
It's like a flashback, so shake your ass crack
I got the balls to rock the salsa
Funk the blues-a, any groove to
Make your move, ‘cause taking you to
Another landscape is my mandate
I'm highly animated even though I'm decomposin'
So if your feet is frozen, I'ma die to see you ropin'

Tap your toes and clap your hands
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on, trace the globe and shake your pants
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Just twist your hip and do the dip
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on, shake and bake, do whatever it takes
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
[Verse 2: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Gravitational pull'll have you making a fool
Out of yourself on the dance floor
Doing back spins, running man and more
Party down with vigor and candor
Coming to the jam or look like a landlubber
And do the aqua boogie, win lots of goodies maybe
Pop a Gucci wallet, turntables is talking to me
It's awfully groovy, seeing all the treasure and the booty

[Verse 3: Del the Funky Homosapien]
I want to get down lower than Atlantis
Going toe to toe with an enchantress
Get funkier than Funkadelic wearing Pampers
While you eggheads is on the wall preparing answers
Sharing transcripts, while we over here
Dipping and dancing, rhythm romancing
Wallflowers, giving no action, no
All hours we chillin' and maxin'
So relaxin', opposites attractin'
I'ma toss my hat in, floss when the track spin
Like I'm on a crack bend, jigglin' and wigglin'
Freaking booties, speaking to the cuties so belligerent
No religion, just bump the feed on
You'll feel reborn, negativity we just dead it like decoy
Better lift your feet and just measure the beat on
The pulse when it responds

[Hook]
Rather be, rather

Rather be, rather
Rather beee with youuuuuu

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah
Hey
Ay though I love you hate that bitch that's always with you
A Shame I gotta put up with her shit just to get you
She threw another fit you had to split because she was wit you
And now I'm at the crib all alone damn I miss you
Ay when we first met you was too tense for me to get through
And then I got you loose it's like a glove how I fit you
Your two lips they smell like tulips so official
My niggas'll probably clown me if I told 'em that I kissed you
But you clean as a whistle wet as a tissue in the toilet
Love to hit that spot get you hot like I boil it
Even let ol' girl watch she enjoy it
Even though she make it hard for me to see you
Knowing that I need you
Now look, don't make a grown nigga beg that ain't fair bitch
Just take them clothes off oh look you got your hair did
For me looks good she said oh you so sweet
Now get me while you can you bout to have to wait a whole week
Ah hell not the beast really I don't give a fuck
Well since you already bleedin' that mean I don't get to cut
Ay look I'm already fienin' so just let me slide thru
Tell your homegirl relax and let me get inside you
Because that booty mad thick behind your juicy ass lips
I'm trying to get you hot and wet you know Jacuzzi that shit
Then I'm bustin' like an uzi in this bougie ass chick
The only reason that I put up with this moody ass bitch
Is... you

Rather be, (Hey baby its... you) rather
(And I... ) rather beee with youuuuuu

[Verse 2: Wale]
Yeah
She said I love you she talks tellin' me to kiss her up
But when her friend visits I doesn't get it much
Its soo-woo season and shawty dick teasin' now for that reason
Now my shit is like a crip sneaker
Listen love of my life, I'm tryin' to get some, a-
-ttention. You don't gotta listen just give a fuck
Your mouth, I don't need, your legs, you can keep
Just tryin' to get up in your jeans re-sew your seams
And your pussy was the cameo but stole the scene
So I got my camera on your cameltoe say cheese
Two lips blowin' kisses, muah to my mistress
Goodbye to my girl when I'm in it
I'll take you out shorty but let me know its mine
I'll paint you with my tongue and stay in those bikini lines
See it's a part of you I gotta be a part of
But every other part of you make me wanna depart and
Baby look at what you started, why am I working for it
Why are we still conversing when I'm sure you've heard the chorus
I'm sure you get the point and I prefer you throw it urgent
Your mind can say no but she can't control the urges
Because your booty mad thick behind them juicy ass lips
Trying to get you hot and wet you know Jacuzzi that shit
Then I'm bustin' like an uzi when I'm through with that shit
The only reason why I put up with this stupid ass bitch
Is because of you

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
Uh, and how I wish I would've met you first
Never had a chance to try
Cause your overprotective friend saw the lust in my eyes
So you she would hide cause she thought of me as a typical guy
Which you know I'm different, right
You listenin' to her is leaving you with empty nights
Recognize shawty, be real with ya'self
Mama feelin' herself literally
And I wondering if her mission is to get rid of me
Cause every time you come by to kick it
And I open up the door you bring her cranky ass with you
Influencing your decisions I can't even get a minute
Without her making attempts to garner all of my attention
She talk and I don't listen, I'm just picturin' me stickin'
And movin' you moanin', music on the counter in the kitchen
Spitta be that nigga bitches reachin' for my zipper
Cause they figure that's the way to my digits I beg to differ
Lifted like the research group, I so get it
She know you'll never be the same if I hit it
You know you longing for the stroke so you drippin'
She smoking and that'll be the scapegoat for slippin'
Oooo your booty so thick behind them juicy ass lips
I'm trying to get you hot and wet you know Jacuzzi that shit
Then I'm bustin' like an uzi when I'm thru with that shit
The only reason that I put up with this bougie ass bitch
Is... you

Niggas want me on a song so I give em' the South
Thirty a verse, cars just for sixteen bars
And that's before I did this, so it probably went up
Eighty thousand dollar bonds, I ain't givin' a fuck
Cause that's change in my pocket, 45 I cock it
Click before I spit then it's time to scram
Bought a Cutlass on dubs, colored candy yams
And that's bowling ball paint so I roll the lane
Keep a poker face bitch and I fold the game

Before the DJ started cutting (I was already fucking)
Cinderella'd you girls; from nothing to something
Hit the parking lot, hear the club system thumping
Lose the face, you two's was great
But it's to the V.I.P., I got new moves to make
[Hook: Pharrell]
(Get down!) When the last time you heard it like this?
Smoke something, drink something, get ripped
And make the girls in the party just strip
Move ya ass, girl (Get, get down!)
Only if you know you live
From the club to the parking lot
How many chicks can you fit in that ride?
Put 'em up, homie (Get, get down!)

[Verse 2: Malice]
Hey, it's just a day in the life
Club nights, one of the reasons I love life
Chicks be in the back tipsy
We gets in for free—""Ay, they with me""
Two stepping, you see each crew repping
Slipping on the floor, mirrors and walls is sweating
Shorty in my ear say she got a thong on
And I love how she move any time a song on
I like that ma, you do something to me
Come this way and prove something to me
Fast or slow, she got the right moves
And I got the right dough for any date that I choose
I'm open, but naw, I don't lose focus
If the shit jump off, you know the thing that I'm toting
But I'm only here to party, y'all
Carry every weekend like it's Mardi Gras
[Hook: Pharrell]
(Get down!) When the last time you heard it like this?

How many chicks can you fit in that ride?
Put 'em up, homie (Get, get down!)

[Interlude: Pharrell]
Yo, you are now listening to the sounds
That are vibrating your speakers
Please do not be alarmed (Get, get down!)
It will not hurt you at all
For it is the real
For all my real niggas and bitches (Get, get!)

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
When they say, ""Last call"", it don't mean the night's over
It mean it's time for her to show ya
How quick she can hop out those Gucci loafers
Pin her ass to the sofa and attack the chocha
S&M chick, asked Pusha to choke her
But I thought about how rich I am and said, ""No sir""
Chick was crazy, gave her crazy space
What did it? The whip appeal or my baby face?
[Verse 4: Malice]
The night's still young and I'm already leaning
Cruise through the lot on the deuce-two's gleaming
The liquor in me and I don't need a reason
Obnoxious with the women, hot tucked in the linen
I pull up, let her get in, she know from the beginning
She added to the list of them chicks that I done been in
Her head spinning and my head spinning
Mine from juice and gin and hers from neck and chin and
I'm a winner, man

[Hook: Pharrell]
(Get down!) When the last time you heard it like this?
Smoke something, drink something, get ripped
And make the girls in the party just strip

Chicks exotic, mix Hpnotiq
Superhero role boy, I'm bionic

Grow Up,Bishop Lamont,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
I used to think fuckin' up was cool
Loved ditchin' class 'til I didn't pass high school
My dad always said it's easier to keep up
Than it is to catch up, but all I did was mess up
Roll around the streets, get drunk and shoplift
Freestyle, meanwhile, continue to bullshit
A teenage life, when you think you know everythin'
About everythin' and don't know a damn thing
Hit the 'shaw, liquor, bank, then the gas station
Get to duckin' when they buck in gang altercation
We scatter, then come right back
Shit, riskin' our lives, but never saw it like that
A few blocks down the street, couple fools get capped
Nigga, bullets ain't picky, it coulda been a wrap
It never hits home until your homie get clapped
You at the funeral with tears, sayin' to yourself you gotta grow up

[Hook]
Way up (Up, up)
You not a kid no more, I think it's time to grow
Homie, you better know, you know it's time to grow
Way up (Up, up)
Cause nigga, you too grown, get out and get your own
Your childish ways are gone, I think you better grow up

[Verse 2]
You got a Bentley, but can't keep gas in it
A Gucci wallet, but ain't got cash in it
Go out to eat, it's your treat, then at the last minute
Say you forgot it, never had it, want them to spend it
Now that's an interestin' thang
Cause in your video, you havin' so much blang
A few days ago, I heard you pawned that chain
Instead of coppin' that, you shoulda copped the food chain
V-necks, mohawks, just ain't me
Shit, it barely looked right on Mr. T
Your biker chains, designer shades, just ain't right
Especially when you can't breathe cause your pants's too tight
Wack beats, catchy hooks and little ass kids
Add a dance to it and it's gon' be big
It's our fault everythin' done flip-flopped
You wanna save hip hop, rappers? Then you gotta grow up

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Nigga still cruisin' Crenshaw at thirty-six
Your wife at home, you wastin' gas, tryna bust a bitch
At the club, actin' young, wearin' the wrong shit
Think you're Chris Brown, but you look like Keith Sweat, bitch
Ain't you got kids to raise?
Instead of actin' like them, nigga, act your age
Why you wear a wave cap, but ain't got waves
Wear that shit out in public and on church days
And goddamn, niggas, pull up your pants
Got your drawers all out, what you wanna strip dance?
And homeboy, what you doin' in a 5X?
You ain't that big, shit's lookin' like a dress
You bought an iPhone but live in your momma home
Gotta wait 'til she's asleep before you can bone
You grown, you know you wrong
But either way, someday, homeboy, you know you gotta grow up

Wake Up,Blu,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
Wake Up and pray
Give thanks for another day
Take a little time to stop and praise
Then be on your way but first
Wake up
Give thanks for another day
Take a little time and meditate
Get busy then be on your way

[Verse 1]

Wakey Wakey, mans all snakey
Man up gracefully and you'll thank me
Stand up face the streets and proceed
Go leave the hood to more good
Knowledge is power, dollar is the model of tomorrow
Yesterday, present day, can I ball
A resurrection in my deck since I'm listening to beats just to see where my head is, bet it
Ahead of this I wreck it
Stress free I'm destined to be I once dreamed
Deeper than kings 6'3"" I was 6'4""
Living his dreams in 3D
Memories visit me like remember me?
When we was free Jesus, Kings even
Think about it
Nothing odd about it
Hard for me to doubt it when I'm sitting in history
Pissed cause the only time you're benching me is when you're lynching me
Woke up and they was lending me money
Killing me many
And when I speak about it they just look at me funny
Like isn't he funny?
What is he rapping about now honey? Money?
No dummy, I think he said God
Apparently black people think their Gods
Have we been sleeping?
I think we need to
[Hook]

[Verse 2]

I seen a lot of dreams at long beach
Chillin' in the breeze when you walk by the sea
See it in the eyes of most folks you meet around the lakes
So I know what they expect me to be
Just another MC out to be big Will
Get mills and park my wheels all up in the hills and peace, please
I knew I'd get this far, the hard part is putting art over the cheese
Artists tryna steal something weird from here
Trying not to leave a homie at the rear
I fear one and trust none but the G O
Even though the love for my people is sincere
Made it to the pier
I just became peers in this weird life like ""How the fuck you get up here?""
Realized I was following a dream I had and didn't notice I sleepwalked out my little sphere
Smoke clear, mind open
Sunshine over 'em
Usually go gold as a God
Eyes is bliss
Wipe the crust out your eyes and shit and realize that you really God
But first you gotta

Slow Ya Roll,Young Buck,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Young Buck]
Let me take you back to high school, '94
When at least when a nigga had time to go
Walk to the bus stop, selling rocks on the way
Little bad motherfucker with a pocket full of yay
Fell in love with a shorty that was bad
I would go and skip class just so I could see that ass
But she was too fast, and I was too slow
'Cause she wanted a nigga who already had dough
She found her a man who was like 24
But what she didn't know that he had plenty hoes
She was too young, so now he got a new one
'Cause shorty went and bought her a new gun
See when she catch this nigga she gon' do something
Not fight, but shorty gon' shoot something
But she never got a chance, a change of plans
Shot herself in the back putting the gun in her pants

[Chorus: Young Buck {with Chester Bennington}]
Live life young nigga, quit trying to be grown
You gon' miss momma when she dead and gone
So {slow your roll}, slow down, my nigga
{Slow your roll}, slow down my, nigga
Live life little mama, quit trying to be grown
You gon' miss daddy when he dead and gone
So {slow your roll}, you gotta slow down
{Slow your roll}, you gotta slow down
[Verse 2: Young Buck]
I got a graveyard tatted on my arm
So I'ma just start with my uncle William Hahn
My momma only brother, he served in the Navy
He lost his life because the war made him crazy
My nephew Shannon, 15 years old
When I think how he died I get real cold
'Cause they found him in a field with some crack stones
There was no flesh, it was just bones
I was just home, with my cousin Craig
And then I got a phone call said they found him dead
So what's next, ain't went to Bizz funeral yet
Instead of one casket I need two of them shits
It don't quit, just when you think I'm seeing better days
My auntie just find that she got AIDS
And it's fucked up, 'cause her life don't end
And she locked up, so she dying in the pen', damn

[Chorus: Young Buck {with Chester Bennington}]
Live life young nigga, quit trying to be grown
You gon' miss momma when she dead and gone
So {slow your roll}, slow down, my nigga
{Slow your roll}, slow down my, nigga
Live life little mama, quit trying to be grown
You gon' miss daddy when he dead and gone
So {slow your roll}, you gotta slow down
{Slow your roll}, you gotta slow down
[Refrain: Chester Bennington]
This can't be life, we're living
'Cause I don't wanna live no more
I don't wanna live no morrrrrre
This can't be life, we're living
'Cause I don't wanna live no more
I don't wanna live no morrrrrre
This can't be life we're living

Mad Bars,Chris Webby,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Yeah, this shit right here is for all the haters
Alright, everybody sayin', ""Yo dude, you can't spit.""
And I'm like, I'm like, ""Yo fuck that I can spit!""
Ha. So uh, let me just lay down mad bars
Yeah

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I'll spit a whole bunch of bars, re-roll up cigars
I am greater than the rest Supernova, the stars
You're just the common cold I am SARS
I do not spar, every single blow will hit hard
And I know what you are and hm, you're not me
Outdo you in anything bitch, just watch me
Drop shit on any topic, hotness
Then swap spit with hot chicks and get my cock licked
I'm a rot pit mixed with a little bijon
Hugh Hef in the flesh, Stay rollin' with three blondes
So don't hate this, I can't help that I'm great bitch
I spit a rhyme and then I'm outtie, Like an A6
I make hits and I hit the marijuana
Then beat the shit out of Rihanna just because I wanna
Haha, Nah, I ain't Chris Brown, I am Chris Web
CT is listenin' to everything this kid says
The only time I get bread's at a meal
Before my main course, god damn I need a deal
I'm broke out on bail and I'm livin' with my parents
But I spit, and got these high school girls starin'
Darin' to be different, apparently it's rhythm
That's keepin' me goin' every moment that Webby be spittin'
Spittin' like I got a loogie stuck in my throat
But fuck it I'm dope, the ring leader's runnin' the show
So ring around the rosie with a pocket full of OC's
Pop 'em all at once and OD
Oh me! Oh my! So high! I don't even want to land
Contraband in my waistband, rip it cause I can
Half man, Half ninja turtle
Half a fuckin' head case
If I don't make it on the mic I'll make a sex tape
Me, Kim Kardashian, and Paris in a three way
Burn it right to disk and make a million off of Ebay
I got true blood runnin' in my veins
Sharper than a vampire's fangs
Bang! Sneeze a lightnin' bolt, cause I'm always spittin' thunder
Runnin' shit like Ari, cause drama like Vince's brother
Smoother than butter with a pocket full of rubbers
And skills that'll make your girl s-s-s-s-stutter
Back up in this m-motherf-fucker with a vengeance
Make 'em pause like they got a comma in their sentence
You can tell I'm the shit as soon as I hit the entrance
Fuck the shampoo, we that rollin' that Herbal Essence
Cause I'm great like Alexander
Two Poke balls hangin', spit flames like Charmander
And I got your chick wetter than a Blastoise
She said I'm sexy and she love my raspy ass voice
I'll turn the stage into a slaughter house, ask Royce
Fuckin' with Webby is just a bad choice!
I'm a mothafuckin' goblin man
Get the cable vision rhythm, rippin' on demand
You can see me with the mic on my sonogram
The doc was like ""hm, I think we've got a problem ma'am""
Had a rattle in my right hand, dutchie in the other kid
Diaper on my ass, thirty rack up in the fuckin' crib
Had 'em sayin' ""what the fuck is up?""
Cause all I do is fill up cups and puff a dutch
Rollin' with a crew of giants like Justin Tuck
So if you really wanna step, better muscle up
Cause I really got to show 'em when enough's enough
Cause now these rappers trying to bite me like Scruff McGruff
Gotta get these damn dogs euthanized
I am back ill as can be, and super-sized
Like Star Fox, I am truly fly
Can't do what I do, excuse you I
Be runnin' shit with my manager younger than me
And I'm young as fuck, and still nobody fuckin' with me
I am in A&R's wet dream ready for the shit
Cause the games a fuckin' rap when they let Webby in this bitch
Because the game's a fucking rap
When they let Webby in this bitch. [x2]

Yeah, you know, mad bars
Maaaad bars
Spit straight on any mixtape
I'm ill, yeah, what"

Banks, what you wearing all that blue for? You know Snoop Dogg?
Fake king of New York, you ain't Jay-Z, you RuPaul
You ain't hard nigga, you ain't hot
Yayo, do your dance, show homie how to flop
Christopher Lloyd gon' be Christopher Reeves
Picture him rollin' through the N.Y.C
Tellin' niggas that I stole your logo, tryna use me for promo
Your logo is a shield, and you stole that from the po-po
You cop nigga, you ain't got New York on lock, nigga
Check the record store, they still got yo shit in a box nigga
Your boss sing songs, only R&B nigga wit' bling on
Y'all should stop rappin', and sell ringtones
Drunk ass flow, G-Unit alcoholic
Me and Dipset seem to be the only motherfuckers (Ballin'!)
Again and again, I will aim, cock, and shoot
Make your fitted cap spin in the wind
With your Jay Leno chin

Tryna play me out, but you out of bounds, man
Where your goons at when I come around, man?

Tryna play me out, but you out of bounds, man

Young Buck, when your album comin' out?
Naw, for real, go ask 50 when your album comin' out
You niggas fightin' over airtime
It's my fault that he pushed your album back farther than Clyde Drexler hairline
Creep up on your tour bus, pull out the pump
Word from Cashville, you ain't been down south in months
You got money in the bank? I'll tell you what I think - you're broke
What you gon' do when 50 stop payin' your car notes?
And the nigga Paul Wall take his grill back
Gotta go back to Nashville, you gon' feel that
David, this ain't' no butterknife Dre shit
This is one shot, kill, ask him where his face went
Now back to the basics, you niggas stuck in the Matrix
Before the nigga finished the G-Unit logo I erased it
So face it Freddy, you'll never see Jayceon
A year and a half later, still looking for my replacement
[Chorus]
When Game in this bitch
It's goin' down man
Try to play me out, but you out of bounds, man
Where your goons at, when I come around man?
Banks, Yayo, and Buck is runnin' from the Sound Scan
When Game in this bitch
It's goin' down, man
Tryna play me out, but you out of bounds, man
Where the goons at when I come around, man?

Bitch, I'm up on the guest list with the Swedish House Mafia
You can find me on a table full of vodka and tequila
Surrounded by some bunnies and it ain't fucking Easter

Get into the bar buy a couple bottles of Ciroc
Bottles of the 'Tron bottles of the Grand Marnier
Couple bottles of the 'Yac bottles of the Rosé
Throw another couple shots back throw another rack
Bring another couple of the models (OK-K)
Get another drink let the waiter know
'Till every single bottle finished spend a lot of dough

Let me come in then I give it to ya raw
Baby girl go ahead wiggle to the floor
We bang 'till you can't take it anymore
While a nigga drunk everybody fall on the floor
King Kong with it y'all know when I come through
Imma give it to you niggas that are hatin'
Imma -- evaporate everything around me
See the way I do it how the kid disintegrated
When I'mma do it I'mma neva neva do it wrong
And I hit you with the bang and I hit you with the bong
Back murderin' another track, every nigga better black
While I hit ya with another Trey song
[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
My vision's blurred, my words slurred
Its jam packed, a million girls
And I ain't tryin to leave though
We drunk so let me be your alcohol hero
Callin' all the girls, do you hear me?
All around the world, city to city
Cheers to the girls, throw a deuce to the guys
Now I got a chicken and a goose in the ride
Gettin' loose in the ride

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
I'm tired of living fucked up, tired of living bad
Tired of hearing grandmama telling me
""When you gonna go to church, Chad?""
Now I'm tryna live up to the image that she would want to see
But I got one foot in the street
And every week I flip a ki
I never wanted to be a G but niggas depend on me
It ain't safe to hit I-10 so niggas fear wit' me
And all the niggas that I went to school wit'
Got cool wit', went to fool wit'
Out there sellin' that white shit
Pushing cocaine, niggas' whole existence
Dependent on the game
What ya want me to do? It's like somebody cut my throat
Got twenty-thousand dollars trying to turn it to a hundred
And ain't nobody got no dough
So niggas tend to smoke, bad habits do exist
And this bitch think that she can ease my mind by sucking my dick
Bitch, maybe for a minute but that shit never lasts
It's 1996, niggas is dying from laying on some ass
First Magic Johnson got it, then Eazy-E died
And you be wonderin' why young niggas out there smokin' fry
I wish that I could tell y'all I wore a rubber every time
But if I told you that, nigga, you know that I be lying
And I've been fucking pussy since the tender age of nine
It's getting to be a full-time job just trying to stay alive
And crackers tend to smirk
Offended by the weed smoke coming off my shirt
But still I put in work and front for my folks
'Cause where I come from, nigga, family just ain't no joke
Now D be gettin' married, and Edgar on the boat
But what about Baby Doe? Some say that nigga's selling dope
And you know I ain't lying, that's just how family talk
But what you gonna do when the Devil poke you with his fork?
And everybody sittin' in the pulpit ain't saved
Most preachers just false prophets fucking hoes and getting paid
I'm looking for the

[Verse 2: Bun B]
You only got one life to live, that's all they give us to do it
You can bullshit your way through it
Or stay true, it can be complicated 'cause niggas be gettin' shot in the cross
People and names get lost, the feeble and lame get tossed
Streets'll eat your ass alive
Take your possessions with pistols, bare hands and knives
And nobody's surprised if somebody don't survive the dusk to see dawn
It's treacherous how we was left here to just die on these streets that we be on
Motherfuckers sleeping on them corners that you pee on
Probably 'cause society felt they didn't belong
Now who in the fuck made it this way for us?
Got all these little niggas selling that yay
Because it ain't like they make higher levels gainable
And that quote piece of American pie just ain't attainable
So how can I sustain a full life before death?
Man, I'm left out here to make it by my goddamn self
Now come on, who gives a damn when you can't afford the turkey or ham?
Living off of ramen noodles, beef jerky and spam
Now that's sad, but that's a fact of life
All I can see in front of me is up for grabs, come off your slab
'Cause poverty'll push a nigga over the brink
Over the edge especially if you don't know your ledge
And so instead of being without, I'm hustling
Trying to get through these ungodly days
Thinking of ways to get the fuck outta this maze
A man'll commit a crime 'cause a fucking crime pays
I'm going through a phase you don't grow out
Until you a reason a motherfucker gots to po' out
His .40 on the curb, disturbed and left with no doubt in his mind
But still sometimes he don't know why
He walking around just hoping he get one more try to make it
It's bullshit he going through, but yo, he gots to take it
You can't fake it, to get the high life

We living that high life

We living that high life, mmm (High life)

Watch me Watts, come here Brooklyn
Follow me Houston, see what I'm 'bout
Really South Philly Bank Head keep looking
Uh...You feel me I'm a product of pushing
That was red off whooping pull switches off trees
Pull of the leaves like she loves me...not
It's hot I couldn't tie a shoe
Move slow like Tai-Chi
Down the block, come kick it with me like Kung Fu
Where I hung like noose, they call me young bruce
I cop Jordans pull chickens with these
Please was not odd to work at pa-pa
Though I came with a biscuit
Just tryin' a make a mill
I brang in the bidness
Flow like chuch, pulpitted with ease
Pivot and pull from the lines like threes
Gain a better understanding
I'm just tryin' a make it real
Like a fisherman, pon da river fam
I'm pon my bank, deposit my thoughts
Till my mind draws a blank
And I withdraw from checking
I'll leave that with y'all for a second
Give you a minute to let it sink
Didn't I advise baptize?
For them dead presidents, I'll tie a bomb to your brakes
And burn money faster than you learn you ain't even conserve money
Gave you a second now I return hungry
Period young blood, I return monthly
To bogart like humphrey
Stern, gully, seldom, stumble
Welcome to the jungle like FernGully
Man it's gorillas here
Takes a village to raise a villain here
And you might have to raise his bail
Tryin' a free the whole cartel
I need to raise a million here"

[Verse 1]
Hey, I know that this ain't nothing that you used to
Out of the ordinary, unusual
I know you had your whole life planned out
So to watch this pan out I know this shit gotta confuse you
I know you wonder why I had to choose you
Don't wanna take you for granted or abuse you
So I’ma keep it honest
I think it’s a little ironic
If I hit another chick its gonna bruise you
Shit, staring out the window of this plane
Thinking if it crash, I’ll never see your ass again
Wouldn't that be a shame
Cause look at all the shit we overcame
Made it through the flame and never got cremated
I made it to the fame and never got too jaded
All them other couples we fuck with, secretly hated
Flash forward it’s been years, we the only ones that made it
Shit, remember I was straying from home
And ""Where I Wanna Be"" was my favorite song
Sometimes I still be on my Donell Jones
But I just can’t leave you alone
[Chorus]
It's like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Feel like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not

She know me like a book, its too easy to read my ass
Unhappy stressed, yelling don’t mislead my ass
I mean I make it so easy to please my ass
The shoe was on the other foot and you would leave my ass
True that
My song all on the radio
Who Dat
Am I so far gone, used to see both sides like the Mohawk on
Now I know you wonder why this phone lock on
All this time that I’ve been with ya you ain't used to do that
I loved your ass way before I knew you could rap
The way you breaking my heart I should sue you for that
Call up my uncles and my cousins have them do you for that
We had a deal you ain't keeping up your end of the shit
In my mind I know she get the short end of the stick
Try to justify it thinking, man we finna be rich
Some bad bitch I barely know sending me flicks

It's like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Feel like she loves me

But, yo, yo, if you got a plan, believe me, you gon' get there
You gon' get everything you ever wanted, baby

Trust

[Verse 1]
My niggas come home from long bids
They check for me before they see their own kids
I open up accounts for 'em, we bounce tourin'
Major cities, arenas, headline with big time singers
Cop Ferraris with navigational screens
Guide us through your hood and any locality, then back to Queens
Piped out seats, Oakwood MB cord speakers
Bumpin' out old shit
That made me think of Old Easters '86 in a Le Tigre short sleeves
Lees, flip the cuffs up, gettin' fucked up
From Old E, Fresh Fest, niggas got hurt
100 niggas rush the door with Queensbridge tournament shirts
Back then, nobody wore a vest
Pull out razors, you had to put your hand skills to the test
Get your Pumas took, come home barefoot, wylin'
Look at the chain I snatched with the medallion worth a thousand
Cops rushed, the God done made it home smilin'
Half of the crew? Prob'ly on the island
Project call play puff ball the hoop was made out of a hanger
Playin' corners, stick the elevator never thought
Project life would promise nothin' but to die trife
For steppin' on the next man's Nikes, my motto: look for tomorrow
Today is yesterday look at the hood now, I'm mad that it turned out that way
Gats spray, these shorties is killers
The older G's taught us well, what's wild now is that they're smaller
And they look at me like I'm on the outside lookin' in
Like 'who's you?' when I cruise through
I call shorty took him in watch your friends, get ends
Be clever, realize that today's the first day that begins forever

Everything will eventually come to an end
So try to savor the moment, 'cause time flies, don't it?
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
'Cause nothin' lasts forever, ya know? Yo
Everything will eventually come to an end
So try to savor the moment, 'cause time flies, don't it?
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
'Cause nothin' lasts forever (Yo)

Nice cars, livin' like a star, club-hoppin'
Poppin' bottles at the bar, love shoppin'
Gucci iceberg, coppin' two, three nice furs
One for your wife, one for your freak
Silver-spurs Rolls Royce, too good to be true, houses worth 2.2
Pool parties, beautiful view
You made it in life, Forbes Magazine style, baggy jeans style
Pass the green while hoes wit' meanwhile
Asses, pretty mommies illest bodies pass glasses
Louis Roderra with Peach Schnapps you just relaxin'
Thinkin', ""Damn, wish my niggas could afford this""
On the sand at your Malibu house holdin' a cordless
Talkin' to lawyers, accountants, investments
Money doubles, triples, protect it: hard work you manifested
Worries of failure, when you buried is your familia
Gon' keep your name prosperin' to the maximum?
You should live, there's only one life, that's the physical
Rich or poor or in jail, why the fuck should you be miserable?
Things happen for reasons, the clock keeps tickin'
Love could have your heartbeat skippin', thugs turn to religion
The bitch you love could start to hate you
The shit you used to do escape you
Things that make you laugh represent the past
Reminisce the block, gamble Gs on the floor
Niggas use to be the man, you don't see 'em no more
Your favorite restaurants and favorite stores, they tore 'em down
Turned 'em into shopping malls, the hood is like a ghost town
Haunted by souls who thought that time stood still
Just live your life to the fullest, never look back, it's real
[Chorus]
Everything must eventually come to an end
So try to savor your moments, 'cause time flies, don't it?
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
'Cause nothin' lasts forever, ya know?
Everything will eventually come to an end
So try to savor your moments, 'cause time flies, don't it?
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better

July,Jhen Aiko,[],"[Verse 1: Drake]
This verse starts as my snipers hit their marks
And your guards fall down from a rifle to the heart
Like, clap, clap, let em fall slow
I know you had your fears, you can let 'em all go
And most women are motivated so I act accordingly
But this is so refreshing that it means a little more to me
Dedicating time when I really can’t afford to be
I provide protection if you open up the door for me
Couple stares, couple texts, couple dates
Couple ""I think that we’re ready""s
Couple ""I think that we should wait""s
Are we actin' like a couple? I’m just tryna get it straight
Cause I’m over here convinced that it’s too early for mistakes
And then

[Bridge: Jhene Aiko]
Oh, you had to change up the game
Oh, the weather is not the same
Now there’s only cloudy days
Can’t stand the rain in July
Oh July, there were fireworks explodin'
But now it’s getting colder
Leaves are turning color
Why, it’s just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh, baby oh
Our summer turned into fall
[Verse 2: Drake]
Damn, tell me where did all the magic go
I followed the rules and told you everything you had to know
Had you over every night, every night was passionate
Plus, you met my mother even if it was an accident
I’m confused tell me where we go wrong
I was sure that I would be with you for so long
I was planning on this on being something worth mentioning
Energy invested in someone I saw potential in
Who killed chivalry? They need to get their sentencin'
Meanwhile we arguing and I can’t get a sentence in
And just as I predicted here we go again
They always say the hottest love has the coldest end

Oh, you had to change up the game
Oh, the weather is not the same
Now there’s only cloudy days
Can’t stand the rain in July
Oh July, there were fireworks explodin'
But now it’s getting colder
Leaves are turning color
Why, it’s just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh, baby oh
Our summer turned into fall

See it's funny cause I never thought this would end
But then the season changed

You were my, you were my, you were my girl
Shoulda made, shoulda made you my world
Shoulda done everything to make you happy, baby
Oh yeah

Can’t wait for, can’t wait for, can’t wait for springtime
And I will turn into a butterfly
I will spread my wings and fly
And I’m too fly for this shit

This is my last day, this is my last era
Wifey sitting front row running her mascara
And I'm laid out STIFF like my last pair of
Starch jeans; it seems that all my past errors
Don't even matter cause, I ain't even mad at God
I just think the saddest part is I don't wanna go
Cause who the hell knows for, whom the bell tolls
I was, chilling with my peoples just, out on Melrose
With Blu and Evidence lamping in our shell toes
Drinking brew and tapping bitches on the el-bow

When they start to toll, it's just yo' time to bail, yeah

Some people live to try, and fly, and fly sky high

Uh, bells and whistles, they shooting, could smell the pistols
They never EVER hit or miss - it's the real official
Bulls eye target, like New Jack Carter

Part of me says, ""Go back home""
The other half says, ""Get that throne"" (y'know?)
So I spit words, they read like palms
And turn directions from East to North (oh!)
We can't stop nature taking its course
But I can report, so I stay with my hand on record
Looking for the next future resort
To reside in a time where bell rings and people are dying

What up?
Escobar season begins
Repent your sins
Nine-Six
Trackmasters
Check it

Spark the lye with the eight-forty I fly
Pretty thug show no love its like when doves cry
Maybe I'm just too demanding, parked the Land
Mark Buchanan, fuck a job I'mma die scramblin
Digger gold, dig a bigger hole in ya soul
Que Pasa, Pablo's throne cabron
At the airport the Mobb picked me up in a truck
Jewelry chunky like fuck never scared to get stuck
So whats the deal Papi?
Heard the feds could of knocked me
Had the cuban posse all up in my room and lobby
Negotiating, my name holds weight, we motivatin'
Hustling, as if God was dancing with Satan
The Firm waitin', to get ajourned cause we facing
Double life, thuggin for life, you taste it
The white numbin ya toungue
I bought it from Dominicans
A suitcase of benjamins swung tight in his fingers
Had the Firm gun slingers, hit the lights, grab the white
Murder everything in site, and jet in the Bimmers
Now im home with the phone screaner
Resting the stones in a jewelry cleaner
Checkin my mail reading my supoena
To the witness standing, I got remanded
Livin on the 4th building and can't stand it
Gotta fight my case from the inside
Niggas telling, I felt it coming when my pockets started swelling
But thats the game for ya
Hid a stash to ya lawyers
Supreme court, Queens New York will bore ya'
Suited up, booted up, with the jail cut
Million dollar bail what?
Z put up the house and I was out
Word the Fuck Up
Time to get the shit on son
Tryna trap a nigga
Incarcerate me yo'
Check it tho, yo, yo
Im gonna make it if I try, cross my heart hope to die
(cross my heart hope to die)
Im gonna make it if I try, cross my heart hope to die

Praise the Lord, ive been scarred with hot water
Days are shorter, next court dates around the corner
Money ain't the same, shit is outta order
Since the days of Rich Porter
Something gotta give, I ain't trying to bid
Now I run up in cribs, body shit, but no women no kids
In the Bridge where the murderers live
I used to make a quarter million monthly
I was ill until they sunk me
Killed the snitch with the pump 3 shots
Bought a passport off a junkie
The Firm helped me flee out the country
Word and I'm out, Pakastinian land
Chilling with my man Jungle

Freestyle Or Written,Juice (IL),"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
I freestyle erratically for those that wanna battle me
Spit venom at MC's until this mic cord is staticky
Do damage to a salt and a pepper, without the battery
When you diss you flatter me, I'm fuckin' up your whole anatomy
The tan tenor, oh your hoe... we ran in her
With thirteen king size chocolate antennas
And in my city, for reals yo I'm sick of who talk
About how me and my man is on the dick of New York
'Cause when I innovate, I incinerate then I eliminate
You in a state of shock until these niggas hyperventilate
I serve the east coast to west coast and won't discriminate
Penetrate, I crush all beef right where it emanate
In daylight my stray mic strike the twilight
And I'mma stay tight, playwrite, create highlights
And ain't nobody finna do me, especially in this bitch game
I'm ruthless, I use my middle finger when I switch lanes
Pertainin' to bein' entertainin', now I'm rainin'
I slay men, experts and laymen with my grey pen
I'm scrapin', remotely holding rap down and shapin'
A style handcrafted since the days of my playpen
In my drop-top, I rock spots, I got it lock stocked
When my Glock pop, I had the hardest niggas playin' hop-scotch
I'm top notch, and if she ain't fuckin' then watch me cock block
I hit hot twat, and pop-lock, hey nigga knock knock
I'm enterin', Juice's shit is colder than the winter and
These instumentals bang and leave a nigga's skin splinterin'
""Friday the 13th"" I rip Jason
A slick Mason like Perry with more game than Dick Grayson
Perfection, rap erection, now let my TECs in
I burn your neck skin, these niggas start epilepsin'
Juice steps in, and If a motherfucker test us
They scrapin' his ass of the wall like asbestos
[Hook]
I just freestyle the hook and display my skills
No matter what a nigga kick you'll be on my deals
Get your notebook, quote, it's time to take notes
Can't fuck with the freestyles or what I got wrote
Swear to god I just rip it and freestyles my skills
And everything I kick is dope so they'll be on my dillz
And when I get done with the song you'll think I'm bullshittin'
'Cause you won't know if it's freestyle or if the shit is written

[Verse 2]
Niggas swear to god they finna rip the microphone
I swear they couldn't go gold if they bought a herringbone
They'd need kneepads, lookin' at my style 'cause I'mma be bad
I swear it's so dope, I had to check into a rehab
Never nervous, MC's are worthless, put down your pencil
My instrumental, will cramp your style like a menstrual
Scenario, it's time for your motherfuckin burial
I'll murder you and burn your promotional material
Kinetically and alphabetically, I'm the thickest
And theoretically, poetically, (cough) I'm the sickest
My bic is, scribblin', yo it ain't no ritalin
If rap was defense, I'd have Kobe double dribblin'
I'll leave this mothafucker so hot, it'll be sizzlin'
I haven't even started my reign (rain), I'm only drizzlin'
I'm unpresentable like pierced needles through your genital
In general, I'm known for stealin' shows like a criminal
I'm crucial, mathematically I'll reduce you
I'll noose you, I'll shoot your posse even if they neutral
Yo, don't drink and drive when you choosin' my tape
It's like, cruisin' on the freeway and losin' your brakes
And the crash will be a crash that will thrash your ass
I'll harass these motherfuckers from the first to the last
There's no immunity, when my tape hits the black community
Niggas will put the crack down and start usin' me
My shit injures, average men down to ninjas
My tape so dope, it should've came with two syringes
I blend this, with no glitches for all your bitches
Last time I got so open, I needed stitches
When every nigga in they Accent Hyundais heard this
I leave niggas quieter than Sunday service
I can burn any nigga steppin' in my jurisdiction
Big Juice, I'm in the house like a shorty on restriction
[Hook]
I'm like Schwarzenegger when it's time to erase
These niggas talk behind my back but they be all up in my face
If I do kick a written rhyme for your instant bonus
I'll make you change your name to ""The Rapper Formerly Known As""
So next time please just get off my deals
And let me do whatever and display my skills

I'm a dope nigga, that's no bullshittin'"

I'll be another nigga headed to heaven, hanging with 'Pac
These motherfuckers look at me like I'm a slanger
Makin threats to my family, dawg I'm in danger
Who do you call when these agents want you dead
And they hit these penitentiaries and niggas make a pledge
So I dip and duck the feds, all my homies stuck out on indictments
Caught up on the phone, talking prices (Hello?)
25-to-life's the mandatory minimal
My whole community gets treated like they criminals
Prior convictions getting motherfuckers hung
Got a C.I. on the inside and everybody's sung
Mothers and fathers separated from they sons
Households are broken, you couldn't hold your tongue
If it's yours, say it's yours, take the case, do your time
When you was out here getting money from it everything was fine
Now you crying in your jail cell, stressing on the case
And the D.A. is at a nigga every other day

You in question of your manhood homey (Keep the code)

If I got shit to say about a nigga case
I'm a motherfucking nigga through and through, iron gate
Know a nigga caught a case and he took his 25
Sat it out on appeal, and gave him back that time
A soldier in his mind and his actions said the same
Told a cracker tell your mammy suck his dick cuz he with James
Ain't no motherfucking game, we been living this for real
When the government is working, real niggas never squeal
Right here the truth revealed, Troy you a mouse
Yeah you rapping but the homey Lil Pots can't get out
Niggas they hit the pen, they get charged, then get out
On a Rule 35, he informing for the cops
You can hear it in his voice, I done listened to the tapes

Still we stickin' to the G Code, we playing by the rules
We don't fuck around with new niggas, cause new niggas is fools
We don't photograph the homies, that'll catch a nigga up
On a picture you a victim, bottom line nigga fucked
Only connect the real, staying down with the true
I got love for you Ant, you a real nigga Spook
My nigga Spoonie Gee, I can only name a few
But there's a thousand motherfuckers in the pen bulletproof
So this one here's for you, I'm a rep it 'til I die

I Hate College Remix,Sammy Adams,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
I hate college remix

[Chorus]
I hate college but love all the parties
Finishing kegs and crushing bottles of Bacardi
Can't go to class, I'd rather lay up with a hottie
Single doesn't mean I'm looking for somebody
Some say they drink blaze up, but hardly
Poppin' PK's, ski a little bit of molly
Am I out my mind? Most people say probably
But I've been on my grind puffin' nugs of that cali, collie

[Verse 1]
Pack my bag, no parents didn't drop me off
I felt lost saw some herbs all wearing Lacoste
A couple dudes in pinnies musta played lacrosse
Grabbed my duffle and I hustled through the dormitory doors
Of course my homie lived on the same floor
Soon to blow trees and down to pound Coors
Down to pound whores, out of time though
Flow the better up to the whole town oooh
I hate college but love getting laid
Socialite swagger at night when the sun fades
Check my sun shades talking about upgrades
I can't see the haters no more I feel great
My eyes 20/20 so sunny when skies gray
I'm loved by the honies what more can I say
I'm just getting paid working like a slave
Between school athletics and music it's all day
So invite your friends to come play
Gave you the invite if you miss it don't complain
If you lucky get a kiss but miss no that's lame
Wanna get it in with wizzy, I'm your man
Sweating bullets no fan can contain
Short to pull it, but quick to amaze
I'm looking forward to tours in these planes
Seeing the cork popping from bottles of champagne
Dear Lord taking your name in vain
All these sins in college that I made
Well well my game's off the chain
I last a couple hours tomorrow go insane
[Chorus]
I hate college but love all the parties
Finishing kegs and crushing bottles of Bacardi
Can't go to class, I'd rather lay up with a hottie
Single doesn't mean I'm looking for somebody
Some say they drink blaze up, but hardly
Poppin' PK's, ski a little bit of molly
Am I out my mind? Most people say probably
But I've been on my grind puffin' nugs of that cali, collie
I hate college but love all the parties
Finishing kegs and crushing bottles of Bacardi
Can't go to class, I'd rather lay up with a hottie
Single doesn't mean I'm looking for somebody
Some say they drink blaze up, but hardly
Poppin' PK's, ski a little bit of molly
Am I out my mind? Most people say probably
But I've been on my grind puffin' nugs of that cali, collie

[Verse 2]
I can't sleep 'cause my god damn teach keeps assigning essays
Due at the end of each week
But little do they know I got a show by the beach
Watching girls flash Wizzy way more than their teeth
They mad I'd rather learn flows than their lesson plans
But sit me down asking do you get the message Sam?
This is your life and you're in school to get right
Nah, music is my sun and you blocking my light
And if I don't blow get high and ignite
My life full of lines so my money gets nice
Well money's not happiness, you'll only get greedier
But shit it'd make life a whole lot easier
And my field gets a whole lot cheesier
Dominos bread but still getting meatier
But schools good for one thing I must add
And that's having a plethora of my vocab
Whole bags of verbs that I must grab
And throw down like a rich girls bar tab
[Chorus]
I-I hate college but love all the parties
Finishing kegs and crushing bottles of Bacardi
Can't go to class, I'd rather lay up with a hottie
Single doesn't mean I'm looking for somebody
Some say they drink blaze up, but hardly

Hey, this is the story of a youngin dreamin'
Left his city to see if he could be what he dreamin’
Big city on his own shit
But every now and then a nigga get homesick
Pick up the phone, holla at my partner he telling me, be warned
A lot of shit done changed in the time that you’ve been gone
Streets got meaner, the hoes got growner
And went and got babies the day they got they diplomas
Damn, gon’ be some niggas missing when you fly back
If you black, they sending you to jail or to Iraq
Old buddy that we hoop with, with the bad chick and a fly 'lac
And a gold chain? Caught him on the Merc, tryna buy crack
Damn homie! Shit, in high school you was the man homie
The fuck happened to you?
Used to beat niggas down at the buses after school
Now you looking like a motherfucking fool

Said I’ll be home for the holidays
So when you see me, better holla at me
I gotta get up out this city ‘fore it try to trap me
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay
But I’ll be home for the holidays

From way before, keep your head up
Come let's get this bread up

But I’m coming home for the holidays

Hey, this is a story bout some puppy love
But at the time boy, I was feeling like this must be love
Although now I'm on my grown shit
She bad as hell, a nigga still get home sick

Dressed like a black man in college shit
Got a little knowledge now I’m following the politics
But I still gotta holla at my old chick
So sweet, so thick, girl pick up your phone, it’s me
She said “what, we ain't homies no more”
You go to college now you act like you don’t know me no more
Girl please, we got history, semester seem so long
The last time I seen ya baby you ain't have no clothes on
So if history repeats itself
When I get home, girl it's on, you ain't gon' need ya belt
Or your pants or your drawers, then we hit the rewind
Just don’t give it up in the meantime

I know you know them act a fool days
That missed the bus then hit the blunt and go to school blazed
Trying to get laid so I gotta stay fly
But a nigga hella shy you would have thought that's where the Bulls play
Was just a freshman could used a little Kool-aid (cool aid)
Crushing on them upper classmen but it was too late
Buddy she was dating, yeah, he had the freshest shoes
But the nigga graduated and he never made two A’s
Hey if you’re listening, we got in school
But who will pay our tuition man?
These niggas crazy
One year cost about same as a Mercedes (benz)
Four years cost wife, crib, and a baby
Ay maybe this ain't for me
Only if I could be LeBron and go straight to league
The worst part of growing up man: shit just ain't for free
Maybe I can be somebody people pay to see
And maybe I should move up out here to the place to be
To get from A to Z, aye what you think I'm crazy
If I told you one day that I'ma sign with Jay-Z
And will I make it man I guess we gotta wait and see

Now I'm back with a brand new sick rhyme
So black check time and tempo
Revolution ain't never been simple
Followin' the path of Mao and Fanon just
Build your brain and we'll soon make progress
Paid your dues, don't snooze or lose
They came with the masterplan that got you
So know who's opposed to the dominant dark skin
Food for thought as a law for the brother man

[Verse 2]
P-Dog with a gift from heaven
Tempo 116.7
Keeps you locked in time with the program
When I get wild I pile on dope jams
Then spit on your flag and government
Cause help the black was a concept never meant
Nigga please, foodstamps and free cheese
Can't be the cure for a sick disease
Just the way the devil had planned it
Rape then pillage everyone on the planet
Then give 'em fake gods at odds with Allah
Love thy enemy and all that hoopla
Hear close to the words I wrote
Crack, cocaine are genocide on black folk
Who in their right mind ever coulda missed this?
Damn right when you think seditious
And I move swiftly, you can't get with me
The triple six moved quick but missed me
When I came off involved in conscience
So don't ask why next time I start this
[Verse 3]
Now let's get wild, allow me to freestyle
I build and fill your mind up with know-how
A common sense, a defense the next time
A pig tried to step to this, listen
Never let someone whoop on ya
They don't belong to the set you from
Ya can't be intrigued by the leads a pig lead
Unless you don't give a fuck to be free
Keep stompin' on, I keep stompin'
Attitude but I ain't from Compton
I can't be fucked around or muffed around
I can't be held down, check the sound
And keep in tuned on point on target
The revolution won't be thwarted
A setback cause my man it's plain to see
Must end all white supremacy
So let the rhythm roll on when I kick this
Brothers gonna work it out with a quickness
And now you know just why a panther went crazy
The devil made me

Beware the beast man, for he is the
Devil's pawn. He kills for sport, or lust or greed
Yea, he will murder his brother to possess
His brother's land. Shun him, for he is the
Harbinger of death"
Bridge,Jean Grae,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook - MeLa Machinko]
See I can be the bridge that takes you home
Or I can be he wind that makes you moan
Depending how you treat me baby
See I can be the beacon, brings you light
Or I can be blacker, colder than midnight
So how you gonna see me baby

Now either you can go on and choose me
Or baby you're gon' go on and lose me
Cause I can be, I can be, I can be, I can be
I can be, I can be, I can be, I can be

[Verse 1 - Jean Grae]
If I could be blatant with, well, what I gotta say about you and I is
What I gotta do to not see it Kevin Smith way
You know, View Askew, babe
Give it to me straighter than a hetero, I'll pay for petrol
We can go riding through the metro (polis)
Put it together because separate causes, misunderstanding, watch
Metropolis
That's like us, see together we marvelous
Hard as the city of the concrete gardens
Split it up, inserts the margins, you get confusion, the words lose purpose
The mark and the target, the arc and the aim like a dart just miss position
If I can explain the way we need to go and where we gonna go, I can do it just like this
Listen
I guess this is the infamous, ""What is this really?"" conversation
Man I hate as a miss is this it's me bringing it up
Predictable dating
But you won't, I've been waiting
I wouldn't bother, wouldn't have the patience
It would be the aphid in the room, wasted breath, but I think you're amazing
That being said... (dot, dot, dot)
Love the way the bed rock non-stop
Love the time we spend, chill, eat, shop
Even iller the days we pretend we wanna be at our own spots
But then you knock, knock, knock
But yet still not confirming lock
I need to know or else just get dropped
Get canned, get blocked
Got plans, or not?
[Hook - Jean Grae]

[Verse 2 - Jean Grae]
The way you think is appealing I
Like the feeling of thinking of you
Like to know that you're thinking of me
Like the feeling of being us, two
Might reveal how I'm feeling too much
Might be feeling the fear, we do rush
Fight the feeling to flee, to lose us
Type to reel in the scenes and lose trust
Slice the dealings and leave, abuse lust
Cuts and bruises, I see you lose love
But you chose to redeem it, who does?
Fuck the blues and the demons, choose one
Human to humor cupid with some ""cue in the music cupid shit""
Come
Lose the race in the shoes that you run
Fuse the pace of the two into one

Back to the Grill,MC Serch,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'blues', 'jazz', 'pop']","[Hook x6: All]
Back to the grill again, the grill again

[Verse 1: MC Serch]
You need a posse the size of the Nazis to attack this
And you're more optimistic than the Sounds of Blackness
Flip rhymes that rip through the chest cavity
And I keep goin' and goin' just like an Energizer battery
Flattery will get you nowhere, unless it's the derriere
And then it gets you everywhere
Went to the flea market, was in my car, I parked it
Beef like blunts, if you got it, then spark it
And with the fisticuffs came the fists
And you've joined Steven Segal on the Marked for Death hit-list
Went back to the '70s and brothers got on grins
'Cause they can step to sisters and say ""Slap me some skins
Honeydip"", and take the squaw to the teepee
Hit it off, smoke a cig, watch a little TV
And if there ain't no papes, there's no show
I'll just chill and return to kick 'em in the... grill
[Hook]

[Red Hot Lover Tone]
Word up! MC Serch, that was fly
We gonna try like this, though, um...

[Verse 2: Red Hot Lover Tone]
Bust a style while I do it, if you know it, oh, you knew it
If you knew it then you knew it, if I catch a punk chewin'
I'mma drop the flavor fluid on his head, yep, I flew it
And like Aretha Franklin, your moms is jumpin' to it
So, so, so, where did you go, what do you know?
So many people want to be fly like Joe
G.I., E.I., oh, lots and lots
And any rapper can top the Red Hot (Not!)
R&B rips hip-hop (Not!)
MC Serch is gonna flip-flop (Not!)
All my hoes look like Sasquatch (Not!)
And uh, George Bush gets enough props
Well, uh, anyway, I'mma slay, slay, lay
Pull a hoe around my way and make hooker soufflé
Red Hot Lover Tone would like to thank MC Serch
Yo, you're chill for makin' me part of history
Kickin' 'em in the grill!

[Verse 3: Nas]
Finesser, keep a Tec-9 in my dresser
Lyrical professor, keep ya under pressure
Mind like a computer, the inserter
Paragraphs of murder, the nightclub flirter
This is Nas, kid, you know how it runs
I'm wavin' automatic guns at nuns
Stickin' up the preachers in the church, I'm a stoned crook
Serial killer, who works by the phone book
For you, I got a lot to shoot and songs to hear
My rhymes are hotter than a prostitute with gonorrhea
On the mic, I let vocabulary spill
(It's like that, y'all!) That, y'all, kick 'em in the grill!
[Hook]

[Sample x2]
""Jump, jump, with the man, with the plan, Chubb Rock""

[Verse 4: Chubb Rock]
The Chubbsta breaks, head nods, he fakes, steady rate H
The panty mix the verse, looks to Serch, kick him in the grill again
Part 2, sequel of ""The Dialect, The Derelict""
The murder list, Vanilla kicks it to climb on the crucifix
Comin' around the mountain
When he comes to sell the record bumps
Digest the lyrics then you suck on some Tums
Crumbs with the energy from the lump sums
And lips to to the mixture to the friction and then you're hummin'
The door rings, yo, I'm comin'
To a theater near you, get your popcorn and your brew
And a Guinness Stout, check the clout when I'm about
'Cause YOU! are a BLABBERMOUTH!
A blabber, it gets no badder
Lyrics on a diet 'cause it gets no fatter
Like a Gwen to the Guthrien, jumpin' up on the scene
With the Serches with the verses, word up, the illustrious
Rapper, dapper, snapper fish, you want us to sell out your wish
My lips have never touched the circumference of a spliff
And if you see some coke or some spill
With some ill pill, yo, kick me in the grill, grill

""So get up and get down""
""Serch'll never stand still""

[Verse 5: MC Serch]
So here's a true or false, tell me if it's fact or bull:
You wanna kill the Klan, shoot the fans at a tractor pull
Got crazy game, so no one can stop me
But ayo, I'm white, I guess my game is hockey
Or basketball, football, takin' papes in poker
If honeydip got a moneyclip, I'm gonna stroke her
Wait a minute, chill, chill, can't swing
'Cause my girl ain't my girl no more, now she got a ring
Respect my wisdom like I respect myself
Try the G, I'll put you in a tree just like the Keebler elves
You couldn't be The Mack if you had the car, the hat, the ho
And your shit would still be out the back like a patio
'Cause I saw you eatin' pig knuckles, with Frankie Knuckles
In a club called Chuckles, wearin' name plate belt buckles
Goddamn, your life is flimsy
Gave you 'nuff respect, but took it back 'cause I was stingy
So from the cons and pros to the pros and the cons
Call me a motherfucker, I'll say, ""Yeah, I fucked your moms""
Until she calls back, I'm gonna chill
Peace to Red Hot Lover Tone, Chubb Rock, kick 'em in the grill

Where Im At,Lloyd Banks,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah, you got me
I’m up now, it’s your loss
Must suck to be you

[Break: Eminem]
History is like a quarter-note delay
It keeps repeating itself, and what else can I say?
You wondering why I act this way
I never should've gave you the time of day
Guess you know what time it is now, eh?

[Verse 1: Eminem]
There must've been a gust of wind
‘Cause you change your mind every time it blows
And you just changed it a-motherfuckin'-gain
You just said you just wanted some dick 'fore I stuck it in
I wouldn't have been such a prick to you, fuckin' men
You say you don't trust 'em
Why do I hear the sound of toilets flushin'?
Some shit is goin' down
You must've just not been truthful from the start
See for me it’d be nothin' to say you never had my heart
But I’d be lyin'
Fuckin' see why they call this bullshit a relationship: ships sink
And you know it's love as soon as you fall in it ‘cause shit stinks
And it feels like every time I fuckin' do I get jinxed
Cupid must have put a curse on me, six weeks
Have went by and we only spoke twice
I’m sittin' in your driveway, callin' you from the car, suffice
I think it's safe to say you’re not at home
I’m callin' your cell phone
You answer but I can tell though that you're not alone
How was I to know?
It should've been time to go a long time ago
I kept holdin' on, it's comical
When I think back now why I couldn't get the hint
And feel the draft you were throwin', I wasn't catchin' your drift
But there's a cold breeze blowin' over me, I'm over you
Success is the best revenge to pay you back
And that payment is overdue
I overcame odds to get even
The sober me is shittin' all over the un-sober you
And I hope they play this in every club that you're goin' to
I’m hauntin' you, bitch, everywhere you turn I'm followin' you
‘Cause I loved you with every ounce of me, you know it's true
It's killin' you now, yeah, I hope the ho dies slow in you
It's ‘cause of you now I don’t trust ‘em at all, fuck 'em!
Middle finger up, I’m gon' just keep grabbin' my balls, cup 'em
I’ll never fall again, I trip on stairs, I fall up 'em
So, buttercup, don't try to come back knockin' on my door all dolled up
[Chorus: Eminem]
‘Cause I’m movin' on, don’t worry about me
‘Cause I’m gon' be just fine without you, you’ll see
There ain't no one on this Earth right now I’d much rather be
‘Cause, goddamn it, I’m glad that I’m me
I said if you could be where I’m at (bye, bye)
You’d wanna be you too (I'ma be good without you)
If you felt the way I feel, I bet you’d be in as good a mood as I am
But you don’t ‘cause you just feel like you
I said if you could be where I’m at (bye, bye)
You’d wanna be you too (I'ma be good without you)
If you felt the way I feel, I bet you’d be in as good a mood as I am
But you don’t ‘cause you just feel like you

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Uh, I’ve had it for the last time
Your actions got me hot as my last rhyme
Your options are leave or put out, granted, your ass fine
Fine just ain't gon' cut it
Drama is what you’re in love with
You and them bitches you run with
Lately I’m feelin' smothered
You snooped around for dirt to be uncovered
Conceited with cover girl motives, I gotta rise above it
You thinkin' about who's lovin' me, I’m thinkin' about who doesn’t
Doesn’t really matter what you say, sickness in my stomach
Told you I was gon' be splittin', you don’t think I mean it?
Left you with everything I got, fuck you! Ain’t no secret
No apologies, you keep it
Now that I’m doin' my thing and you peep it
The badder times all outweigh the recent
Your energy, who needs it?
Every rumor you hear, you go believe it
Point out the times you’ve seen it
You stabbed me, should have leaned it
Revenge is mine, I need it, need a way out
It’s my fuckin' life, let her find a way to stay out
Bet you thought I’d break, it ain't that easy
Bet you thought I'd need you a million times before you need me
Leave me everything that I gave to you
Ain't no freebies, get your coat and go
The female Pinocchio, money-hungry hopeless ho
You fuckin' with my focus so
Go back to that chump that played the role befo'
Love is like a cancer when you don’t let go
I’ma blow fo' sho'
Unnecessary weight makes the boat go slow
I don’t need you sinkin' us, hope you float
Lyin' through my teeth, I hope you don’t
(Drown, drown!) Not a sound out her be dope
Bottles pop out while he smoke
Hate we met, proud that we broke
Let them girls crowdin' me go
If they got somethin' to show, let 'em show me
I don't love 'em, never lonely, never even left a scar
You fell hard, I’m laughin', ha ha ha ha ha
Tire smoke fancy car, nothin' is what we are
No beginnin', no tomorrow
[Chorus: Lloyd Banks, Eminem & Both]
‘Cause I’m movin' on, don’t worry about me
‘Cause I’m gon' be aight without you, you’ll see
There ain't no one on this Earth right now I’d much rather be
‘Cause, goddamn it, I’m glad that I’m me
I said if you could be where I’m at (bye, bye)
You’d wanna be you too (I'ma be good without you)
If you felt the way I feel
I bet you’d be in as good a mood as I am
But you don’t, ‘cause you just feel like you
I said if you could be where I’m at (bye, bye)
You’d wanna be you too (I'ma be good without you)
If you felt the way I feel
I bet you’d be in as good a mood as I am

Who the fuck want it? Make my fuckin day
I blow your candles out, now nigga cut the cake
I gotta eat, bitch! Like a runaway
Y'all niggas ain't eatin, stomach ache
Okay, all these bitches, and niggas still hatin

Especially if you ball, they don’t take niggas well
Hell nah, you can't come through flying
In a, in a Bentley shining
I’m in the back, backseat driving
Screaming on a nigga like I’m actually driving
[Hook: Kanye West & T.I.]
I would like to welcome (you) to the world of (world of)
Fast money, fast cars
Big diamond rings, teeth, chains and the girls of (girls of)
Fake smiles, broken hearts
And if you looking (what) for your real love (well)
You won't find it here
If you looking (what) for your real love (who)
Well goodnight my dear

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
Oooh, if you looking for real love
Don’t come around here
Oooh, if you looking for real love
It ain't here my dear
Mmm mmmm, move on"
Lyrics of Fury,Eric B. & Rakim,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
I'm rated ""R"", this is a warnin', ya better void
Poets are paranoid, DJs destroyed
'Cause I came back to attack brothers in spite
Strike like lightnin', it's quite frightenin'!
But don't be afraid in the dark, in a park
Not a scream or a cry or a bark, more like a spark
Ya tremble like an alcoholic, muscles tighten up
What's that? Lighten up! You see a sight but
Suddenly you feel like you're in a horror flick
You grab your heart then wish for tomorrow quick!
Music's the clue, when I come you're warned
Apocalypse Now, when I'm done, ya gone!
Haven't you ever heard of a MC murderer?
This is the death penalty and I'm servin' a
Death wish, so, come on, step to this
Hysterical idea for a lyrical professionist!
Friday the 13th, walkin' down Elm Street
You come in my realm, ya get beat!
This is off limits, so your visions are blurry
All ya see is the meters of the volume
Pumpin' lyrics of fury!
It's a... a fearified freestyle!
[Verse 2]
Terror in the styles, never error-files
Indeed, I'm known to exile!
For those that oppose to be level or next to this
I ain't a devil and this ain't the Exorcist!
Worse than a nightmare, you don't have to sleep or wink
The pain's a migraine every time ya think
Flashbacks interfere, ya start to hear
The R-A-K-I-M in your ear
Then the beat is hysterical
That makes Eric go get an axe and chops the wack
Soon the lyrical format is superior
Faces of death remain
MCs decayin', 'cause they never stayed
The scene of a crime every night at the show
The fiend of a rhyme on the mic that you know
It's only one capable, breaks the unbreakable
Melodies unmakable, pattern unescapable
I haunt if you want the style I possess
I bless the child, the earth, the gods and bomb the rest
For those that envy an MC, it can be
Hazardous to your health so be friendly
A matter of life and death, just like a Etch A Sketch
Shake 'til you're clear, make it disappear, make the next
After the ceremony, let the rhyme rest in peace
If not, my soul'll release
The scene is recreated, reincarnated, updated
I'm glad you made it
'Cause you're about to see a disastrous sight
A performance never again performed on a mic
Lyrics of fury!
A fearified freestyle!
[Verse 3]
The ""R"" is in the house, too much tension!
Make sure the system's loud when I mention
Phrases that's fearsome, you wanna hear some
Sounds that not only pounds but please your eardrums
I sit back and observe the whole scenery
Then nonchalantly tell you what it mean to me
Strictly business, I'm quickly in this mood
And I don't care if the whole crowd's a witness
I'mma tear you apart but I'mma spare you a heart
Program into the speed of the rhyme, prepare to start
Rhythm's out of the radius, insane as the craziest
Musical madness MC ever made, see it's
Now an emergency, open-heart surgery
Open your mind, you will find every word'll be
Furier than ever, I remain the future
Battle's temptin', whatever suits ya!
From words to sentence, there's no resemblance
You think you're rougher? Then suffer the consequences!
I'm never dyin', terrifyin' results
I wake ya with hundreds of thousands of volts
Mic-to-mouth resuscitation, rhythm with radiation
Novocain ease the pain, it might save him
If not, Eric B.'s the judge, the crowd's the jury
How do I plead to homicide?
Lyrics of fury!
They're gettin' furier!
A fearified freestyle!"
Im Just Raw,Lyrics Born,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
His name is (Lyrics Born)
And he is, as they say, wild and crazy
As a composer, arranger, and producer
He's exploring it all
From the furthest reaches of musical outer space
To the most down to earth funk
And he sounds, well, he sounds exactly like this

[Verse 1: Lyrics Born]
Nobody 'members those
Rap City episodes from twenty years ago
When you were the guest host
Past history, let it go
Get off on a medical
Pack a duffle bag with all your wrinkled clothes and pedal home
Get a little dictaphone and sit alone
In the middle of the room and let it flow
Wouldn't it be better
If you went and chose a new career path
Like a shepherd or a flight attendant on an aircraft?
You're pitiful, a pollywog
Tiny fishy in a smaller pond
Holding barbie dolls and leftover beads from the Mardi Gras
Actin hella hard but that's just poppycock
Cause inside you're hella soft like a Jolly Rancher lollypop
I'll give you cauliflower ears stupid
You're weird
Feelin blue
On a stool somewhere, two-fisting beers
At a Hofbrau
Moaning like a hot cow
Cryin on the shoulder of some old man you met just now
[Hook]
I'm smarter than you
I'm harder than you
I'm better than you
I'm just raw

I'm hotter than you
More popular than you
More clever than you
And goshdarn it, people like me

I'm smarter than you
I'm harder than you
I'm better than you
I'm just raw

I'm hotter than you
More popular than you
More clever than you
And goshdarn it, people like me

[Verse 2: Lyrics Born]
Look I'm sorry, mate
This is awkward, k?
Little hard to say
So I'll just say it
Me and your mommy date
She's awfully great
She's a saucy dame
She calls me late
Always wants to meet
On her coffee breaks
She bought me seats
To Bonnie Raitt
Now there's no concrete date
But she bought the ring
It's laundry day
And my stockings stink
From my foot up in your ass
Cause you drive me absolutely batty
See I'm crabby when you get around me
Tell me who's your daddy
Call me Mister McAffee, your poop-deck pappy
Shut your trap and get back in the backseat of the Camry
Don't sass me or I'll backhand you
Smack you with an axe-handle
Burn you with a wax candle
Slap you with a sandle
I'm trying to watch the rap channel
Can't you tell we laugh about you?
Call yourself a rapper but I gives a rat's ass about you
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lyrics Born]
Why do I even bother with these off-brand cats
Y'all are wombats man
I'm bout to blow this pop stand
Lyrically y'all don't compare to me in any contest
Like a stealth bomber up against a Hyundai Accent
Tall-can to a shot glass
Bong-hit to a contact
Gary Coleman versus Big Boss Man
The Loch Ness Monster up against a crawdad
Talking Sly Stallone in Rocky versus Sly Stallone in Copland
Judge Judy versus Johnnie Cochran
Oh man
Nell Carter versus Karen Carpenter topless
Better yet, Broadband
Compared to a long ass
Piece of string connecting two pop cans
It's all bad
Don't quit your job at all believe me you'll be so glad back
Hold on with both hands
It's sucks washing sauce pans
I know there's an off chance that one day hip-hop heads
Will maybe feel rappers in the top-ten that cross-dress
[Hook]

[Outro]
Ever since his triumphant return from his first album, L.T.D
Critics are calling (Lyrics Born) the brightest new star in years
(Same Shit, Different Day) is his new album, on his own label
And it's got the kind of top talent (Lyrics Born) always surrounds himself with
Here's a sample of what they're raving about"
One,Ghostface Killah,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Ghostface Killah & Trife Diesel]
Yo (Yeah), new Ghostface! (True, indeed)
Glorious days, (True, indeed, God)
Check it out, y'all
We back, yes, yes, y'all (Fake roller derbies), yeah
Masked avengers, (We're here to sharpen your sword)
All praise is due, T.M.F., Wu-Tang Clan
Scream on it, Ghost (Ayo)

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
We at the weed gate waiting for Jake
We want eight ravioli bags, two thirsty villains yelling bellyaches
Heavyweight rhyme writers, hitting the grass that's the ripest
Pull out this kite from this white bitch
Talking 'bout, ""Dear Ghost, you the only nigga I know
Like when the cops come, you never hide your toast""
Guest starred in mad shit, CBL, Ice Water metallic
Past tense placed in gold caskets
Dru Hill bitches, specialist lounging at the mosque
Suede kufi wrap, undercover dentist
Rhymes is made of garlic, never in the target when the NARCs hit
Rumor is you might start to spit
You nice, Lord, sweet daddy Grace, wind lifted on the dance floor
Makeover's free followed by gauze
Duncan Hines monument cakes, we never half-baked
Alaskan sesscapade, push your new court dates
Trauma, hands is like candy canes, lay my balls on ice
The branches in my weed be the vein
Swimsuit issue, darts sent truly from the heart, boo, I miss you
See daddy rock a wristful
Modern-day slave God, graveyard spells fog you goggles
Laying like needles in the hospital
Five steps to conquer, ask Bernadette, Baguette swizzle
Ziploc the air, hear thistle
[Pre-Chorus: T.M.F.]
To my real bitches take your drawers off
To all my high niggas, snatch her skirt off
Just in case she wanna play, get up in that bitch face
And tell her Ghost said, ""Take your clothes off""

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Ayo, the Devil planted fear inside the black babies
Fifty cent sodas in the hood, they going crazy
Dead meat placed on the shelves, we eat cold cuts
Fast from the hog y'all and grow up (Grow up)

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Ayo, crash through, break the glass, Tony with the goalie mask
That's the past, heavy ice Rollie laying on the dash
Love the grass, cauliflower hurting when I dumped the trash
Sour mash served in every glass up at the Wally Bash
Sunsplash, autograph blessing with your name slashed
Backdraft, four-pounders screaming with the pearly ash
Children fix the contrast as the sound clashes
Mrs. Dash, sprinkle with her icicle eyelash
Ask Cappa Pendergrass for backstage passes
Special guest, no more Johnny Blaze, Johnny Mathis
Acrobat, run up on that Love Jones actress
Distract the cat while I'm high, sugar, get a crack at this
Dicking down Oprah, jump rope, David Dinkins
Watch the black mayor of DC hit the mocha
Tangerine sofa, two super soakers in the Rover
Hit the sports bar, tell a young lady to bend over
Meditated yoga, Paddle Ball, dancing with the vulture
Castor Troy laying for Travolta
Yo, switch the lingo, five-nine-seventy
God glow, seven fifteen four be ebony
[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Ayo, the Devil planted fear inside the black babies
Fifty cent sodas in the hood, they going crazy
Dead meat placed on the shelves, we eat cold cuts
Fast from the hog y'all and grow up

[Outro: Ghostface Killah & Tommy Whispers]
Ayo, Wu-Tang Clan, T.M.F. in the motherfuckin' joint
We all connect as one
That's it, baby, straight up and down y'all, Staple-town, y'all
Yo, how many girls you gotta fuck, yo? One
Ah-hah, that's it? (Trey-Mack, what? Shaolin), yo

How many nuts you might bust? One
Haha, straight up and down (What?)
Take to drop a nigga, yo (What?)
How many shots? One
How many shots? I'm gunnin' for the dome
And it only takes one
That's it, word up
How many cakes we bake, y'all? One
Yo, yo, yo, how many L's we smoke? One
Hahaha, at a time, nigga
At a time, you know we do, at a time
Dope fiends, dummy

Switch The Science Project,Lupe Fiasco,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro (Spoken)]
Yeah, Revenge!
Now what we gonna do right now, a-ha! uh
Is gonna try a little experiment, just a little experiment
You know what I'm saying? A little ""science project""
You know what I'm saying? I like to call it

[Verse 1]
(Switch!) You you you, yes let the words woo you
Till you woozy, let the lyrics subdue you
Massage and soothe you, move you, till conscience lose you
Lu now rules you, do what Lu do and you'll do beautiful
(Switch!) I'm the meanest! You the meanest?
I'm the meanest, and I mean this
Now I don't mean this to sound fiendish
But I'm a genius, you a genius?
And the cleanest, never seen this
As clean as my cleanest
From on top, from underneath
From behind, or in between us
(Switch!) I'm a hustler, creeping with my hat low
Niggas know I pack, so, what they gonna do that for?
Niggas got my back, though, like answering the back door
Catch you, I'ma slap you, leave you redder than the Batphone
(Switch!) With a little bit of this and a little bit of that
That, mixed with a little bit of pimp and a little bit of mack
And a little bit of limp, and a whole lotta gangsta lean
I can't be seen, I ain't the King
But a nigga is strengthening to paint the scene
And take the thing over like a soldier, colder than a polar
Got the hood like a cobra, nigga thank the team (Switch!)
[Hook]
Switch, nigga, this is how I got it
I switch like hydraulic cars
Switch like DeBarge, nigga (Switch!)

[Interlude (over Hook)]
Aight, now remember that
That's a, that was a part of the experiment
I had to set it up, so, so, don't worry
I know what you're thinking, I was thinking the same thing
Just, just follow me, okay? Watch, okay? Come on now

[Verse 2]
Murder niggas, step on my shoes, I hurt a nigga
Kill a nigga, fill a nigga with holes, call women hoes
Hold up niggas, hold up hoes, break the calm, detonate bombs
Blow up niggas, blow up hoes, turn around, smack they moms
(Switch!) Heal niggas, educate and build niggas
Instill in niggas, it’s real to respect women
Treat 'em like they real, they feel, nigga, watch the words
Watch Dr. Phil, nigga, chill, nigga, go learn a skill, nigga
(Switch!) Rims, Mercedes Benz, twenties, twenty-twos
Twenty-fours, rose gold, platinum watches, cases of Mo'
Gucci, rubies, mansions, models, VIP, Ferraris
Chinchillas, diamond rings, change, Range Rovers, bling bling
(Switch!) Niggas bust his trains, pocket full of change
Dimes, quarters, taking orders, delivering pizzas
Air conditionless, beaters, hand-me-down sneakers, silver
Wannabe models won't show me love and I can't get in the club
(Switch!)
[Interlude]
Ha, it's getting good right?
Yeah, aight, so check this out
Now go back to the first one, aight? Run back to that one
We're going to have a little bit more fun with that one, aight?
You ready? Aight, come on

[Verse 3]
(Switch!) Hey hey hey, it's coming back to you
Lu no longer rules you, you can do what you do
Back to your usual
(Switch!) It's official, it's official, I'm official
As officials, got the stripes
And the flags, and the whistles
(Switch!)And watch my niggas come from the underground
Just like Thriller, play Bambi and you gon' hear that Thumper sound
(Switch!) They can't touch the sound that I'm busting now
It's like a cloud tryna touch the ground
Tough and bound, ever since we're touching down
Jealous niggas catch your feelings 'cause I'm hustling now, what?
(Switch!) They be hating (Switch!) They be hating?
(Switch!) What? What? What? They be hating
Don't give them stage then
(Switch!) What's a nigga s'posed to tell 'em
When they up in my face then?
(Switch!)That you got a cousin that don't mind catching cases
Busting niggas' heads and slapping niggas' faces
(Switch!)And he-a do it, he-a do it
He-a do it, and I'll prove it
'Cause I done seen it, you done seen it?
I done seen it, he the meanest
(Switch!) Ho-ho-ho, wait, I mean it
I thought you were the meanest
See? That's why this thing is fiendish, right now
(Switch!)
[Hook]
Switch, nigga, this is how I got it
I switch like hydraulic cars
Switch like DeBarge, nigga (Switch!)

[Outro: Lupe talking]
Yeah, experiment done
I think that was a goody, I think that was a good experiment
I think that was nice, it's a nice little science project
Haha! Revenge!
Shoutouts to my homies at Asylum, what up? Yeah"
The Anthem,Sway & King Tech,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: King Tech]
One two, one two
We dedicate this one to the Hip-Hop culture, y'all
Brought to you by the world-famous Wake Up Show

[Verse 1: RZA]
Bobby Steels, Staple' tales, MCs get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred swordplay, tongue-twist
Piercin' holes in you, you can't escape
70,000 kilowatts blast through your box
Walk with alarm clocks, cars drivin' slow down the block
One stopped, parks, pops the trunk
Snare pops loud as Glock shots
Bass like an M80 in your face
Cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification

[Interlude]
Wake up, wake up, wake up!
Tech is on
[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
When I woke up, I grabbed the mic and never choked up
Busted a verse and all the Gs in Cali loc'd up
When I was summoned, styles were mixed like the Drummonds
Killer clown is comin', look around, your town is crumblin'
This Big Tech from the Midwest
Leavin' MC's listless on the Wake Up Show
Make up no stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cypher, partner, you can't fuck with the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirty diaper
Mic heister, psycho alpha-schizo
Hypno, cryo gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway and Tech heard me flow, and it's sealed
Now I got Swedish women yellin' ""Tech N9ne's vild!""

[Verse 3: Eminem]
This place is my house
I might as well erase my face with Wite-Out
‘Cause y'all can't see me like Ma$e's eyebrows (Where you at?)
Climbed out of a nice house through the front window
And heard this guy shout, ""Hey, that's my couch!!""
Pull a 9 out durin' a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin' this shit, put a clip in and spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than a convertible flippin' vertical
Nose-first with the top off landin' upside-down
Get tied down and duct-taped—fuck rape!
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg with my nuts shaved
It's Sway and Tech, two disk jockeys
Breakin' so many freakin' needles, I wonder if they inject?
[Verse 4: Xzibit]
Lo and behold, better than platinum and gold
Yes, God bless, success, never forsake the soul
Xzibit take control—locked, loaded, and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
‘Cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up (Yeah)
Or listen to my niggas Tech and Sway so you can wake up
The X-Man, catch me doing drills in the Danger Room
Big game huntin' from high noon to the full moon

[Verse 5: Pharoahe Monch]
With synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush, from minimum thrusts
Bust multiple assaults in small interims
As horrid as Boris Karloff was
When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of skin
So the head won't fall off
Hauled-off, sawed off shotgun blast
He asked: ""Why did he have to die like cast metal?""
Oh (Haha), see, now like Omar Credle
We 'pon pedal at a high resolution
On the Wake Up Show with Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

[Break]
Revolution, revolution
Revolution, revolution
Revolution, revolution
Revolution, revolution
[Verse 6: Kool G Rap]
I sway the TEC with the Tech and Sway
Step away, weapon spray, rep today
Who owe the debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board, like checker play
When I blaze, your whole sect' arrays
Wake Up Show for those who slept away
Niggas that met the tre, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinnin' like lead from out the Heck and K
Tearin' your neck away, flood up the street with blood redecorate
Until the head of Jakes investigate

[Interlude: Jayo Felony]
Sway can give it to, but what you gon' do with it?
Tech can give it to you, but what you gon' do?
Rev can give it to you, but what you gon' do with it?
I can give it to you, wha-wha-wha-what-what!

[Verse 7: Chino XL]
Yo, yo, yo, Chino make the world go 'round
Fuckin' up entire record companies like Harrell did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, ominous walk
""Which flow will I destroy you with this time?""
The most commonest thought
The drama that's brought caught us in the midst of a sibling rivalry
For instance, there is nothing born in existence that can survive with me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Randall
My style filed for sexual harassment, like Tisha Campbell
You wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fucking murder your young style, like JonBenét Ramsey
Now who the master to beg? Your demo get passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg
I'm Wake Up Show-reppin' with Sway and Tech
My TEC's like Tekken, the industry weapon
I'm Chino X—bring KRS in!

[Verse 8: KRS-One]
De-de-de-da-de-de-de-da-di-day (Hey!)
KRS-One comin' with the Tech and Sway
Yo, I rock up on the littlest set and up on the biggest set
As ill as it gets, I still manage to wiggle your neck with sweat
Never forget: the bigger the budget, the bigger the debt
You gotta be, willin' to rock in the middle of dry
And in the middle of wet
But I'm willin' to bet, on a Sway and a Tech, they stay in effect
Never been a pain in the neck, they gainin' respect
Nevertheless, I wreck you
Now, you know what Sway and Tech do
I'll be back, but for now just seckle!

Ha ha ha! Fresh for 1999, you suckers!"

But all you got to do is believe
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah

Man I refuse to let the bitches take away my pride
Them hoes can lock my body up, but they can't lock my mind
See I'm a young street flame, I got them fire eyes
I mean that Eyes of Fire, the Tiger, the Black Pride
I call some women bitches and I call some women whores
A bitch a dirty boar, a ho open up the pussy store
Now what's the difference between the two? Man, I just told you that
But that don't mean that every woman I know is down with that
If you a bitch and wanna switch, it ain't too late to change
It's all about how you carry yo'self and how you handle thangs
Some say that hoes and pimps is born, I don't believe that shit
Cause anytime you wanna stop, it ain't too late to quit
Just cause you sold your body don't mean you a ho for life
I got to speak it right for all the one that paid the price
But if ya in it to win it, go head and live the life
But baby, if you ain't in it, you still can do it right
(right...right..)

You can't let no bitch shatter yo' dreams (hmm...)

I got to get my money-hey, oh-ho
You got to get yo' money-hey, yeah-eah
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah... - you got to get yo' money

To all the babies havin' babies on ya' own
I know you feelin' fucked up and feelin all alone
I know ya people tellin you, ""Ya fucked up your life""
Ya only fucked up if you lay down and don't continue to fight - uh!
And to the young nigga out there tryna sell dope
I know ya family fucked up and it's your last rope
In your heart, I know ya cold with this rhyme shit
But ain't nuttin hap'nin but this twenty and this dime shit
And you the daddy wit lil' mama that's bout to have the baby
You wanna own ya team but niggas tellin you, ""Ya crazy""
""What you thankin? You too young to have a family""
But all the moves ya makin, look like you a man to me!
When you get caught up man them niggas ain't gon ride witchu
But get down wit that girl and she gon keep it live witchu
But she gon help ya put your money up and save somethin
Cause right now ya run it, th'ew it back and you ain't made nuttin

If you a ballplayer, man go 'head and play ball
Don't let nobody steal your dream if you ain't came to fall

You tell them haters, ""Save that bullshit for another day""
If you a sanger, lil' mama go 'head and sang ya song
Them hoes say, ""You ain't gon make it"", the funky bitch is wrong
You ain't got to get butt-naked on stage in a thong
Just sang your records to show the people you got it goin on
I see a whole lotta motherfuckers come and go
I know young niggas sold they soul for the dirty dough
They want a rapper, I understand go 'head and chase ya dream
But chase too hard, give up the lord and end up like a fiend
Some people gay, what can I say? The only judge is God
But don't be ashamed and try to hide cause then you livin fraud
Cause everythang done in the dark, gon' come to the light
So do yo' thang, cause cain't no man tell you what's wrong or right
Right, right, right, right

[Chorus 2]
I know all along
All along
I know I'm meant to be alone
It's crazy
But all along
All along
I knew I was meant to be alone
Out there on my own, yeah

[Bridge]
Suppose somehow the lionhearted
Failed to win
Who will be the villain?
All the strangers voted for him
Suppose somehow the lionhearted
Failed to smile
Who will be the villain?
All the strangers voted for him
[Chorus 1]
All along
All along
I guess I'm meant to be alone
All along
All along
I guess I'm meant to be alone
Out there on my own, yeah"

[Intro: Kanye West]
Uh
Hello, can I speak to, uh
Uh
Yeah, you know who you are, look
You had no idea what ya dealing with
Something on some this realest shit
Pop champagne, I'll give you a sip
'Bout to go dumb, how come?
Yeah, that's my bitch
That's my bitch
Sh-shorty right there? That's my bitch
That's my bitch

[Chorus: Elly Jackson & Kanye West]
I've been waiting for a long, long time
Just to get off and throw my hands up high
And live my life, and live my life
Just to get off and throw my hands up high (Yeah)
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I paid for them titties, get your own
It ain't safe in the city, watch the throne
She say I care more about them basquions
Basquiats, she learning a new word, it's yacht
Blew the world up soon as I hit the club with her
Too Short called, told me I fell in love with her
Seat by actors, ball players, and drug dealers
And some lesbians that never loved niggas
Twisted love story, True Romance
Mary Magdalene from a pole dance
I'm a freak, huh? Rockstar life
The second girl with us, that's our wife
Hey, boys and girls, I got a new riddle
Who's the new old perv that's tryna play second fiddle?
No disrespect, I'm not tryna belittle
But my dick worth money, I put Monie in the middle

[Chorus: Elly Jackson & Kanye West]
I've been waiting for a long, long time (Where she at? In the middle)
Just to get off and throw my hands up high
And live my life, and live my life
Just to get off and throw my hands up high, high, high, high

[Bridge: Justin Vernon]
Swilling little licks and mixes 'til mornin'
I'm yearnin', ooh, yeah
Could I maybe have a little dab of your potion?
Stop motion, ooh, yeah
[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Go harder than a nigga for a nigga, go figure
Told me keep my own money if we ever did split up
How could somethin' so gangster be so pretty in pictures?
Ripped jeans and a blazer and some Louboutin slippers
Uh, Picasso was alive, he would've made her
That's right, nigga, Mona Lisa can't fade her
I mean Marilyn Monroe, she's quite nice
But why all the pretty icons always all white?
Put some colored girls in the MoMA
Half these broads ain't got nothing on Willona
Don't make me bring Thelma in it
Bring Halle, bring Penélope and Salma in it, uh
Back to my Beyoncés
You deserve three stacks, word to André
Call Larry Gagosian, you belong in mo-seums
You belong in vintage clothes, crushing the whole building
You belong with niggas who used to be known for dope dealing
You too dope for any of those civilians
Now shoo, children, stop looking at her tits
Get your own dog, ya heard? That's my bitch

[Chorus: Elly Jackson]
I've been waiting for a long, long time
Just to get off and throw my hands up high
And live my life, and live my life
Just to get off and throw my hands up high, high, high, high"
Classy Man,Blu,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Kiss the sky
In the middle of the winter with you
Under covers feeling like mid July
Take me up to cloud 9 with you
Chill with me while I twist a la
Twist the locks let me find a groove
I got modern bangers old soul and funk
But I usually bump Jazz or Blues
Miles, Marvin, Curtis, and Thelonious Monk
Books by Saul Will and Langston Hughes
She probably thinking who the fuck is that?
The reasons why you tryna fuck with Blu
She said well really I don't listen to rap
I said I know, that's why I'm fucking with you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a classy man (Man)
It ain't no regular players in here
'Cause I'm a classy man (man)
It ain't no regular players in here
Let's Go!
Let's Go!
[Verse 2]
Yo, karmas a bitch
Excuse me for talking in French
But I had no intentions on harming this chick
Even though I have in the past
I never put my hands on her unless I was caressing that ass
I probably shouldn't have even done that
Cause all that led to was wanting calls back but it's cool
But I ain't got a phone besides my house phone
And I'm usually gone send me a message at the dial tone
[Girl voice]
*Dial Tone* Fuck you blu
You think you can just fuck me and cut me off?
I will cut your meat and make you *Dial Tone*
(Pshh) Message deleted
You wonder why I see your emails and don't read it
Drama, don't need it mama
So beat it
Think I can't find another chick with your features?

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a classy man (Man)
It ain't no regular players in here
'Cause I'm a classy man (man)
It ain't no regular players in here
Let's Go!
Let's Go!
[Verse 3]
Kiss one, Teach one
Some love and some cheap
Some run so far from the heart it don't beat
Some need love and end up mistaking it for lust
One day I gave it all up and had to tell a broad hush
Never punch a lady cause the way I'm brought up
But dog you kinda crazy tryna play for me a chump
I let her put her hands on me once
Good thing I wasn't drunk cause I would have left in cuffs
Cause fuck
When love gets forced to something violent
Turns to Tug-Of-War and of course you're invited
Turned up the beat to ignore her while I'm writing
She took my pad and threw it on the floor tryna fight me
Like the fire inside her was gone ignite me?
I was like please hit her with a nice breeze like
Peace!
I'm outta this bitch
You need God but I ain't got no time for this shit

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a classy man (Man)
It ain't no regular players in here
'Cause I'm a classy man (man)
It ain't no regular players in here

Let's Go!"
Rainy Dayz,Raekwon,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Blue Raspberry, Ghostface Killah, Raekwon, Samples]
It's a mystery inside
Of how I'm gonna get mine
I'm thinking 'bout so many ways
Of how to conquer these rainy days
You sang beautifully just now
I sing for him and he isn't here
It's going down, man, word, man (What's up, black?)
Niggas just fuckin' robbed my gate, man (Word?)

[Chorus: Blue Raspberry, Ghostface Killah & Raekwon]
It's raining, he's changing (Fuckin'— Yo, I'ma murder somebody, man, for real, I ain't playing, whatever, man, whatever)
My man is going insane, insane (The war is on, yo)

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
On rainy days I sit back and count ways on
How to get rich, son, show and prove, ask my bitch
Stood up late nights, build with my a-alikes
We can pull a heist, snatch ice or rock mics
But this rap shit, got me wanna clack back the latch
How it goes the only pesos made from scratch
But in due time, soon to get mine like Bugsy
Heavy on the wrist, Polo mocs, socks and rugbies
Old flicks remind me of Gucci's
Back in Union Square when little Maxmil blast Pierre
That was Build Build, fast forward, ninety-four
Who got the bad base? Filthiest fiends scream for more
Bless me out of state, howdy, Jake, Starks is back
Niggas want work, nine brought back off a g-pack
Coke rocks flood the co-ops, live in gossip
Them big lip niggas singing to cops need to box it
Stop it, the projects over-flooded with slow leaks
The fiends geek, new faces get wrapped in sheets
I gotta get mine, like my old Earth, bless the cheese line
Sipping on fine wines, the power of the blacks refined
(Rainy days) Divine
Waiting on these royalties takes too long
It's like waiting on babies, it makes me want to slay thee
But that's ungodly, so, yo, God, pardon me
I need it real quick, the dough flow like penmanship
Meatheads get pistol-whipped, I blow spots like horse shit
So now talk shit, nigga, what?
[Chorus: Blue Raspberry]
It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane, insane
It's raining (Past sunlight, more gunfight)

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
What brings rain, hail, snow, and earthquakes?
The beat breaks, 'cause all my niggas to break, son
Styles is similar to criminals locked up
With gats, ghetto tabernacles is fucked up
I live once, though the mind stays infinite
Traveling to touch nine planets in my midst
While I carry, to earn a decent salary
Soon get married, raise a family, but the plan'll be
Real great, to sit up in the loft, count stacks and max
And real cats cold watch my back
But listen to the Wu, son, and maintain
It's all real, starving individuals kill
I puff what's only right, leave the poison alone
Projects infested with rats, cats, and crack, holmes
Half of us'll try to make it, the other half'll try to take it
So many fake, half real freedom-build
Born to science my alliance analyzes
Wild surprises, keeping my eyes wide to this
The unfortunate, laying in mountains counting
With jewelry on, can it be the next team house the horn
Chill dun, just for real ones, light the lye up
I hate to have to tie the next guy up
Pay attention to 1010 WINS, Wu blends
Now I'm steering you to truth, buckle up
Now who's a legend?
[Chorus: Blue Raspberry & Raekwon]
It's raining, he's changing (Word up dun)
It's raining he's⁠—, my man is going insane (Peace to Philly, VA, these days, word up, y'all)
My man is going insane (Word up, the sun, moon and stars, fly cars, word up y'all)

[Outro: Blue Raspberry]
No sunlight, more gun fights
I've lost him to the street life
Street life (I've lost him to the street life)
No cash flow, no more dough
He's someone I don't even know
Someone I don't know
Rainy Days
Getting through those rainy days
Getting through those rainy days
Getting through those rainy days
Getting through those rainy days
I lost him to the street life
The street life, woah"

She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang - she shot me

[Verse 1: K'naan]
Ahh, there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian
In other words, she came through explodin’ in the podium
Dynamite Napoleon like sodium mixed with petroleum
Slowly but surely, she was walking toward me
Cut the convo short ‘cause she had to wake up early
But continuing the story, don’t worry
She gave me digits for her Blackberry
“You’re very handsome” is what she said
And the way she looked in my eyes said, “put me to bed”
Oh my, oh my, I should have known when she said to me on the phone
“You do not know me very well, but I would never hurt a fly”
Then she aimed at my chest with love in her eye
Said she aimed at my chest with love in her eye

[Chorus: Adam Levine & K'naan]
She was walkin’ around with a loaded shotgun
Ready to fire me a hot one
It went bang, bang, bang, straight through my heart
(Straight through my heart)
Although I could have walked away
I stood my ground and let her spray, ooh
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang - she shot me
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang - she shot me
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang - she shot me
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang
[Verse 2: K'naan]
Scorpion, she’s so hot she’s a scorch-ian
Killing me softly: Lauryn or Kevorkian
Couldn’t tell if she’s cuckoo or quirky, when
I asked her her name, she said, “call me Ten.”
Testing, testing
Things just got more interesting
She’s dressed in a vest pin, double-breasted holster
A very Western toaster
She ain’t nothing Kosher
Ah, she lets me closer
Hotter than a pepper-crusted Samosa
While I try to keep my composure

[Chorus: Adam Levine & K'naan]
She was walkin’ around with a loaded shotgun
Ready to fire me a hot one
It went bang, bang, bang, straight through my heart
(Straight through my heart)
Although I could have walked away
I stood my ground and let her spray, ooh
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang - she shot me
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang - she shot me
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang - she shot me
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang
[Bridge: K'naan]
Am I wrong?
But what is love without the pain to go along?
And what is pain?
If not the reason for me to sing this song?
And this song is for the weak and for the strong
'Cause I was strong
And still, she got me, she got me
Bang, bang, she got me
She got me, she got me
Bang, bang

She was walkin’ around with a loaded shotgun
Ready to fire me a hot one

Introduction / The Revolution Will Not Be Televised Small Talk at 125th and Lenox Version,Gil Scott-Heron,[],"[Intro]
Good evening and welcome, my name is Gil Scott-Heron
My accomplices are, first, from left to right:
Eddie Knowles, a drummer for the Denise salute dance group, a drummer for December dances and a percussionist for a group called ""Black & Blues"";
The brother to my immediate left is Charlie Saunders, of December dance group and a former drummer for Loretta Parker;
David Barnes, a singer of ""Black & Blues"", will be heard later on in the evening.
We'd like to do a poem for you, called ""The revolution will not be televised""
Primarily, because it won't be

[Verse]
You will not be able to stay home, brother
You will not be able to plug in, turn on and cop out
You will not be able to lose yourself on skag and
Skip out for beer during commercials
Because the revolution will not be televised

The revolution will not be televised
The revolution will not be brought to you by Xerox
In four parts without commercial interruptions
The revolution will not show you pictures of Nixon
Blowing a bugle and leading a charge by John
Mitchell, General Abrams and Mendell Rivers to eat
Hog maws confiscated from a Harlem sanctuary
The revolution will not be televised
The revolution will not be brought to you by the
Schaefer Award Theatre and will not star Natalie
Woods and Steve McQueen or Bullwinkle and Julia
The revolution will not give your mouth sex appeal
The revolution will not get rid of the nubs
The revolution will not make you look five pounds thinner
The revolution will not be televised, brother

There will be no pictures of you and Willie Mae
Pushing that shopping cart down the block on the dead run
Or trying to slide that color TV into a stolen ambulance
NBC will not be able predict the winner at 8:32
Or any reports from 29 districts
The revolution will not be televised

There will be no pictures of pigs shooting down
Brothers in the instant replay
There will be no pictures of pigs shooting down
Brothers in the instant replay
There will be no pictures of Whitney Young being
Run out of Harlem on a rail with a brand-new process
There will be no slow motion or still life of Roy
Wilkins strolling through Watts in a Red, Black and
Green liberation jumpsuit that he had been saving
For just the proper occasion
Green Acres, The Beverly Hillbillies, and Hooterville
Junction will no longer be so Goddamn relevant
And women will not care if Dick finally screws
Jane on Search for Tomorrow, because Black people
Will be in the street looking for a brighter day
The revolution will not be televised

There will be no highlights on the 11 o'clock news
And no pictures of hairy-armed women Liberationists
And Jackie Onassis blowing her nose
The theme song will not be written by Jim Webb
Or Francis Scott Key, nor sung by Glen Campbell, Tom
Jones, Johnny Cash, or Englebert Humperdink
The revolution will not be televised

The revolution will not be right back after a message
About a white tornado, white lightning, or white people
You will not have to worry about a Dove in your
Bedroom, the tiger in your tank, or the giant in your toilet bowl
The revolution will not go better with Coke
The revolution will not fight germs that may cause bad breath
The revolution will put you in the driver's seat

The revolution will not be televised, will not be televised
Not be televised
The revolution will be no re-run, brothers
The revolution will be live"
K-os - Fantastique,k-os,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[K-os]
Yo, uh uh uh uh uh
This is a mission not a small time thing
Let me tell you bout what happened when the phone went
I was chillin' at the crib with this girl named Wise
She was kissin' my brain, caressin' my third eye
When the phone rang, I couldn't believe it
Told myself to forget it, ignore it, leave it
But just when things started goin' great
It rang again, I said hold up, wait
Picked up the phone, ""Yeah who the hell is this?""
Somebody said, ""This is serious business
Hip hop is dyin' it's all Darth Vader
So pick up your mic and swing your light sabre.""
The Skywalker, the fly talker from the T-dot
We got, beats and lyrics to get you up
Kick in the door, wavin' my ASR
Who got my back? In fact it's Figure Four
I keep it raw, cross the city just like gore
Rappers are claimin' to be hardcore
But never no more
[Hook]
Some just lost, they floss they don't get it
When I fall off things I'm quick to admit it
If you love this life I know you'll get with it
Cause all in all it's fantastique
Some just lost, they floss they don't get it
When I fall off things I'm quick to admit it
If you love this life I know you'll get with it
Cause all in all it's fantastique

[K-os]
There's only two digits; zero and number one
But some get fooled by countin' bullets in a gun
I make a run, with that renegade Red 1
We so close you can figure us cousins
So step up if you want to get taxed
Hip hop used to be black, but now it lacks
The brick cause they mostly spit like demonology
My psychology not dependant on pimpology
Cause pimps just react to things, men make em happen
This rappin' dedicated to soul clappin'
If you got soul, than The Infinite's in control
Stop using mine, people to legitimize
Youself cause you raped the Earth and tell lies
My man positive intelligent and wise
I don't suck energy son, I energize
This is dedicated to make it live, bring it back
[Hook]
Some just lost, they floss they don't get it
When I fall off things I'm quick to admit it
If you love this life I know you'll get with it
Cause all in all it's fantastique
Some just lost, they floss they don't get it
When I fall off things I'm quick to admit it
If you love this life I know you'll get with it
Cause all in all it's fantastique"
EXIT Call Me,k-os,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
Call me
(call me)
If you wanna go
We don't have to stay
In a world that is slippin' away

Call me
(call me)
If you wanna go
We don't have to stay
In a world that is slippin' away

[K-os]
Face the world
My father told me
That life is mystical
Beautiful bliss-ful
Now, in troubled times
I find soul in reaching
What I'm seeking seems so far
Praise the world
My mother told me
That life's mechanical
So tyrannical
It blows my mind
Just what we'll be reaping
Many weeping so help us god
Never knew that I
Could be looking why
Are so many
Breaking
Making castles of sand
Every man
Wanna be the one
Wanna be the one to be
King for a day but its slipping away
And I'm happy
Most melodical things I say
To release the pain
And cease the rain
In my brainstorm
I can't hide
From inside
Escape to, the outside
And I'll be flying away
Chorus (repeat 2x)

[K-os]
Never know, never know
Whats right and true, so they be walking death
Everyday is just a struggle
We take till there's nothing left
When I wake I pray that I can see the truth between the dark
For the rest that don't care this a message straight to your heart
Nothing you say now can turn me away
I'm walking the path, never leave me a stray
Many they hold mics and don't know what to say
Whats going on today?
And you walk to fast
On the broken glass
On the smoking pass
Hoping that
Worshiping the cash
But it never lasts
Won't you ask
What can we be?
Can we be free?
Where can we go?

Chorus (repeat 2x)"

Yeah, this is the... warm up

[Verse 1]
Okay, I roll up, hold up, look at how I showed up
I blowed up, had a hole up in my pocket, now it's sewed up
They feinin' for that crack, you know that rock, I got that product
You niggas tryna stop it, better load up, I hang my coat up
Aye, I'm gon' be here for a while so I smile, haters
I'm on that green like a flower, like an alligator
Now or later, I'm serving niggas; I'm a sound waiter
Just tell me what you want, I bring that back an hour later
Look how I cater, dog what you afraid of? Nothing
They talking gangsta without no data, they fronting
Jackie-Chan, Jean-Claude-Van-Dam, straight stunting
I wish a nigga would say something
I'm a Carolina nigga, boy I got it on my back
Piggy back style I ain't talking 'bout no tat
And I'ma rep the Ville in every city that I'm at
And I guarantee I'm bringing home plaques
Shoutout to my brother Zach, and my mother, I love ya
[Break]

[Verse 2]
Yea look ain't that about a bitch? This nigga on his own dick
They say I'm like the human body, I produce my own shit
And I toot my horns, a star when I was born
My name ain't James, my word is bond
Yea shoutout to Canibus, had a similar line 98-99
Damn, that was the times never mind dwelling in the past
You're listening to the future
The flows gets tighter, them hoes get looser
Then they wanna seduce ya like Medusa, be cool
I said I got a girl, she told me, ""Me too!""
So that must mean you want a nigga to eat that seafood
Baby don't be foolish but call her I'll watch her do it

Yea and this is only ""The Warm Up"" yea"
U Cant Touch This,MC Hammer,"['dance', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus]
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this

[Verse 1]
My, my, my my music hits me so hard
Makes me say, ""Oh my Lord""
Thank you for blessin' me
With a mind to rhyme and two hype feet
It feels good, when you know you're down
A super dope homeboy from the Oaktown
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

[Chorus]
I told you homeboy (You can't touch this)
Yeah, that's how we livin' and ya know (You can't touch this)
Look in my eyes, man (You can't touch this)
Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics (You can't touch this)
[Verse 2]
Fresh new kicks, and pants
You gotta like that, now you know you wanna dance
So move outta yo seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rollin', hold on!
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's goin' on
Like that, like that
Cold on a mission, so fall on back
Let 'em know that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, they can't touch

[Chorus]
Yo, I told you (Can't touch this)
Why you standin' there, man? (You can't touch this)
Yo, sound the bell, school's in, sucka (You can't touch this)

[Verse 3]
Give me a song, or rhythm
Makin' 'em sweat, that's what I'm givin' 'em
Now, they know
You talkin' 'bout the Hammer, you're talkin' 'bout a show
That's hyped, and tight
Singers are sweatin', so pass them a wipe
Or a tape, to learn
What's it gonna take in the 90's to burn
The charts? Legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit
[Chorus]
That's word because you know (You can't touch this)
(You can't touch this)
Break it down!

[Breakdown]
Stop, Hammer time!

[Verse 4]
Go with the flow, it is said
That if you can't groove to this then you probably are dead
So wave yo hands in the air
Bust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair
This is it, for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump
(Bump, bump, bump)

[Chorus]
Yeah (You can't touch this)
Look, man (You can't touch this)
You better get hype, boy, because you know you can't (You can't touch this)
Ring the bell, school's back in
Break it down!
[Breakdown]
Stop, Hammer time!

[Chorus]
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
Break it down!

[Breakdown]
Stop, Hammer time!

[Verse 5]
Every time you see me, the Hammer's just so hyped
I'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mic
Now why would I ever stop doin' this?
With others makin' records that just don't hit
I've toured around the world, from London to the Bay
It's ""Hammer!"" ""Go Hammer!"" ""MC Hammer!"" Yo Hammer!""
And the rest can go and play
You can't touch this

[Chorus]
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
Yeah (You can't touch this)
I told you (Can't touch this)
Too hot (Can't touch this)
Yo, we outta here (Can't touch this)"

Who need elevators when these haters just use stairs a lot
Until the day they say ""That is where the exit is""
Execute and excellence
Nigga what's a Freshmen list
I will etch my name into every single desk there is
Until the world knows who XV is

Break The Silence,Asher Roth,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
And see I never thought it'd happen to us
Not another family as happy as us, its a matter of love
Just a little different, a little twisted
A bit sick, but sick is realistic
It isn't fiction, its the hidden truth
Some would rather act stupid than admit it's true
Just because it doesn't happen to you
Doesn't mean it doesn't happen
It happened to exclude you
I excuse you if you'd rather not
But someone you that know might be on the topic
On the hot seat
It's not easy to keep a secret and I can't keep this
It's too deep, real deep

[Hook: Big Prime Da General]
Deep secrets can't tell a friend
But it hurt so I can't hold it in
Hairy thoughts been sitting on the conscience
Its up to me to break the silence, the silence
The silence, break the silence
The silence, the silence
Break the silence, the silence
Silence, break the silence
The silence
Its up to me to break the silence, the silence
[Verse 2: Big Prime Da General]
Aye everybody gotta life story or situation
That they going through
So let me tell you what I'm facin'
My back against the wall
The hand I was dealt
Sorta like I'm playing spades
But not having a spade at all
Gimme one time to stand, one chance
One try and ill have you feeling my life
To the point where you cry
The separation of my parents
Left me embarrassed in school
Cause my dad was never there
Mom just act a fool
I think growing up in public housing
With my grandma it kept me grounded
Now I ain't high as mountains
Yea, now my goal is to keep you educated
Know my life
So you can tell
In every rhyme, that I'm dedicated

[Hook: Big Prime Da General]
Deep secrets can't tell a friend
But it hurt so I can't hold it in
Hairy thoughts been sitting on the conscience
Its up to me to break the silence, the silence
The silence, break the silence
The silence, the silence
Break the silence, the silence
Silence, break the silence
The silence
Its up to me to break the silence, the silence
[Verse 3: Asher Roth]
She was 13 and he was 32
And she could leave man if people only knew
B-but as a teen what hell you supposed to do?
Molested by her dad who was molested too
So confused she ran from and hided
Stashed away like it was a secret dialing
She cried at night
No one to confide it
Scared her mother wouldn't love her
If she finds it, so she lies
Kept it bottled up inside and
Mama came sick with the blindness
And in her mind everything was quite fine
'til he decided to break the silence

[Hook: Big Prime Da General]
Deep secrets can't tell a friend
But it hurt so I can't hold it in
Hairy thoughts been sitting on the conscience
Its up to me to break the silence, the silence
The silence, break the silence
The silence, the silence
Break the silence, the silence
Silence, break the silence
The silence
Its up to me to break the silence, the silence"

This one's for you, yeah
Cadillac's on 22s
Pimp my voice and mack these beats
Pray to the to the Lord for these Mississippi streets

[Refrain x2]
Cadillac's on 22s
I ain't did nothing in my life but stayed true
Pimp my voice and mack these beats
Pray to the Lord for these Mississippi streets

[Verse 1]
God I know that we pimp, God I know that we wrong
God I know I should talk about more in all my songs
I know these kids are listening, I know I'm here for a mission
But it's so hard to get em when 22"" rims are glistening
I know these walls are talking, Lord I want to do right
I tried to fight but these demons they come to me at night
Like my Momma, my Daddy, my girl and all my boys
I lost Michelle but I guess I still got Dwayne and Roy
My cousin Sweets, Mama Lena and Jason
Lord I'm praying for SWAC, my heart is steady pacing
Keep him off them drugs, far away from thugs
He's still my hero but just a shell, man of what he was
Yeah smoke and get a buzz, but God I hear you calling
And shit wrong with balling, but my soul is just steady falling
In to sex and the debt, into an Earthly jail
God I'm stacking my mail but will I end up in hell
[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
Lord they hung Andre Jones
Lord they hung Raynard Johnson
Lord I want to fight back but I'm just so sick of bouncing
Lord I'm sick of jumping, Lord please just tell me something
My folks still dumping my music bumping but I feel nothing
My heart is steady pumping, my heart is steady breaking
Sometimes I feel like I'm faking, man I'm so sick of taking
Maybe hell ain't a place meant for us to burn
Maybe Earth is hell and just a place for us to learn
Bout your love, your will and grace
Sometimes I wish I wasn't born in the first place
Maybe this first base, God knocked the ball up out the park
So we can come home this world right here feeling so dark
It's feeling so cold, Lord I'm getting so old
I don't if I can take this world right here no more
22 inch rims on the 'Lac
I guess that was your footprint in the sand carrying us on your back

And them niggas ain't change, them niggas can't change
Their moms shake they heads, say, ""It's such a dang shame""
The train to the bus then another dang plane
My stage and my government ain't the same name
I'm a rockstar, love it that my wallet chain hang
I'm a modern day saint, I'm a modern day Kane
My definition, I can finally explain
Cold smooth like that dude Sean Connery was playing
I just gotta be the man, I'm the father figure and

How that mic feeling like a million dollars in my hand

'Cause them niggas outside looking desperate again, nigga
And the blunts and liquor killing our lungs and liver
The asthmatic drug addict, I function with it
I put a rapper in a hole where the dust will sit
For spitting played out patterns that once was hittin'

You never seen nothing, can't say the same thing

Nigga I followed her to school you know I don't be into that
Dog, dog, she showed me some ID B, word up
Niggas got to jail for that
Lot a niggas go to jail
See you not a regular nigga right now

Her friend ain't wanna give me the pussy
You wanna know what that bitch said to me?
What happened?

I really wanna mess wit you
But I ain't ready to have sex wit you
And I don't mind kissing on you
But I need to be, I need to be
You know I need to be loved by you
You know I need to be hugged by you
And I can't wait to be touched by you
Cuz I need to be, cuz I need to be
[Verse 1: Mase]
How many niggas out remember the
First time they try to take a girl virginity
And through the bullshit, you lost your identity, and lost your cool
Cuz you ain't know what to tell all your niggas at school
I had niggas making bets like, did he fuck her yet?
Ask her did he touch her bra, when I say 'Nah' they say 'Aw'
So tomorrow I use that pressure to undress her
But the more I caress her, more I feel like a molester
So I wait for the day I deserve it
But every time I go to touch it, then she say I hurt it
I can't even talk sex, and then she say I'm perverted
And then she say, ""Mase, why we can't wait? What, I ain't worth it?""
It ain't that but girl you never say I go too fast
All I'm seatin' when I'm eating, or goin' in your ass
I guess you like that, huh?

I really wanna mess wit you
But I ain't ready to have sex wit you
And I don't mind kissing on you

You know I need to be hugged by you
And I can't wait to be touched by you
Cuz I need to be, cuz I need to be

Now mother may I? Yes you may
I told her 'bout all the baddest bitches from Harlem to LA
Now anything that Mase done blazed, gotta get away
See girl, work is work and baby, when I'm workin' I get paid
For overnight stays that's gonna cost you breakfast on trays
No need for shower curtains, we bathe in Camay
I live the willie life cuz that's the style that I portray
We pop Cristal like my niggas got a raise
See nowadays man you got to know these bitches age
Cuz they ass be real fast when they be goin' through that phase
You fuck a girl that's young, and you gonna end up in the cage
Cuz the mom ain't tryin' to hear that you never knew her age
And naughty is the only way that Bad Boy plays
Fuck them hoes, have them girls recoverin' for days
A nigga like me, I have a girl head in a maze
And I never eat pussy cuz I'm too stubborn in my ways, come on

I really wanna mess wit you

I need to be licked from my head to my feet
To make a long story short, girl I need me a freak
She can be fat, black, light skin, type slim
Matter fact shorty ain't even got to like men
As long as when she grab my meat, she take it down real deep
Till her body feel weak, then I'm fallin asleep
See I ain't talkin 'bout these primadonna bitches you meet
I need a girl that if I ask her handle me and my peeps
Get down dirty, and lick ice down my butt cheeks
Then she wiggle, then I giggle, then she feel my nut seed
Then if she give my dick a kiss, probably give her clit a kiss
Then I hit it from the back, then I yell whose shit is this
Then I go so hard that she need her guts fixed
If she make my nuts itch, I kill that slut bitch
I done been around the world, uh huh, and never met a girl
That's so thorough that could suck a dick until my toes curl, uh huh

[Chorus Outro: Monifah]
I really wanna mess wit you
But I ain't ready to have sex wit you
And I don't mind kissing on you
But I need to be, I need to be
You know I need to be loved by you
You know I need to be hugged by you
And I can't wait to be touched by you
Cuz I need to be, cuz I need to be"
Time,Mr. SOS,"['alternative', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","""Time ... Time ... What is it?""

[Hook]
""Time ...""
People wait for it others hate all of it and many waste all of it
Time. I need to know, ""what is it""
And when it's yours what will you do?
""Time ...""
Don't lose track of it
Let it pass you, kid
Or you'll find out what's after it
""Time."" I need to know ""what is it""
Cause mine might be long overdue

[Verse 1]
Spare a minute of your time to sit and listen to a rhyme
About decisions in your life that you choose
There's this kid, they call him Byron and he misplaces his lighter
And his bills are past due so he's screwed
No ambition left to find, he sleeps until it's five
Feeds his body mad brew and fast food
Gets back too late to say hi to dad, so one day father gets mad
And tells him what to do, he's gotta move
Now he's confused, walking down the street without any shoes
And he's starting to look more skinny too
What more can he do?
He's clueless, begging quarters for food
But he's content cause that's all he's gotta do, what a fool
He should have kept better track of minutes and dollars he used
Then he could probably do whatever he wanted to
But he acts like he's trapped right where he is and he can't fight
Destined to live a bad life, but do you believe that?
Cause many don't, including his dad
Who finds him in the back of a restaurant rooting through trash
He scoops him up fast and shoots him back to the pad for brunch
Prefaces his lesson with, ""I'll only tell you once
What I'm gonna tell you now. Don't no one around
Give a fuck about your luck they just don't want you in their town
Time waits for no man."" Byron replied then
""That might be true but every man woman and child waits for-""
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Second story's about an attorney who's on a journey
To feed his wife and child that was born prematurely
Tis the season to worry like always
For no reason cause everything due is all paid
But can't let a song play without some interjection
Becoming restless when they're running late and had nothing for breakfast
An hour late to meet the parents the mother could no longer remain calm
But just who do you place the blame on?
The same song reloops and they never stop and listen
Feeling like each day doesn't have enough hours in it
But at any given they're dealing with million dollar digits
If that's how I was living do you think I would complain? No
But back to the show with me
A rough day at court quickly turned to getting more tipsy than Nicole Richie
Rolling swiftly after boozing and cruising on purpose
Ended with the Sheriff asking ""Do you have proof of insurance?""
The answer was yes, but then he breathed a flammable breath
And the officer saw his new passenger sweat ...
""What happens next?"" Wait. Look at his license. His name is Byron
Looks like he took some advice and didn't like it
And would almost rather be back with no food on the street
Now look and see cause Byron lives in both you and me
Trusted judges among us, even brothers who lie
To survive look inside for the right balance, and you might manage"

Damn, here we go again
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam
Now everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again

Everything I'm not made me everything I am

I'll never be picture-perfect Beyoncé
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet? He was black as the street was
I'll never be laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people'll reach a
Fake-ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up?
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I'll never rock a mink coat in the wintertime like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like will.i.am
Let me know if you feel it, man
'Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am

And I'm back to tear it up
Haters start your engines, I hear 'em gearing up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get their hair cut
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flaring up
'Cause they want gun talk, or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reeboks, or A-di-dos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
So say goodbye to the NAACP Award
Goodbye to the India Arie Award
They'd rather give me the Ni-Nigga Please Award
But I'll just take the I Got a Lot of Cheese Award

I know people wouldn't usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year, Chicago had over six hundred caskets
Man, killing's some wack shit
Oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
He got changed over his chains a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
The church want tithe, so I can't afford to pay
Pink slip on my door, 'cause I can't afford to stay
My fifteen seconds up, but I got more to say
That's enough Mr. West, please, no more today

Niggas ain't heard my shit...hahaha
The life of Bizarre...what!

Hip hop, that's the way of life (Word?)
If you think you're nice, then go grab the mic (Grab it!)
Let me tell you my story, cause everybody got one
Grab a pen and pad and start to jot some
Always told myself that I would never be losing
Man, I ain't had no hood, my mother was always moving (Damn!)
From Detroit to Texas, Texas to Detroit (C'mon!)
Goddamn, Mama, what's the point? (The fuck?)
So I would go in my room and pack my little bags (Aughh!)
Jump in the truck with my step-dad
When I was ten years old, I started to feel the hunger
Got a little older, man, the force got stronger (Yeah!)
And me and my rap partner wasn't seeing eye to eye
So he picked up and started a group with some other guys (Haha)

Man, I thought this was supposed to be hip hop, hip hop
I'd rather be fishing in flip flops, flip flops
Or cross over to country like Kid Rock, did, I
Can't see no country singers beefing over some guitar
Riff that Willie Nelson lifted from Bob Seger
When I was younger I was so eager
To have a gun I would do the same
Couldn't wait to get to the shooting range
Me and my man Goofy Gary just trying to let loose some steam
Motherfuckers laughing 'cause I couldn't aim
So I'd pull the fucking target closer and just shoot the thang
I used to have this theory: keep three bullets in the gun
It was a mandatory year up here in Michigan
For each bullet if you got no CCW license
I tried to apply for one, they said it'd take five-six months
What the fuck am I supposed to do mean time when rivals come?
Hide that sumbitch in the glovebox or inside the trunk
Now, back to what my three-bullet theory was
I'm triple platinum, I ain't trying to catch no murder one
Figured I'd shoot to wound, probably miss with at least one
But them other two gon' fuck his shoulder and his kneecap up
Then I'mma say it's self defense,"" how come I had the gun?""
""Was because I was at the range, on my way back from""
This dude approached me on some bullshit
I'd get a year for each bullet at the most
As opposed to having a full clip in that
That was my idiotic logic, it was basically for safety
But it gave me power, and it made me crazy
And psychotic, I just got retarded once I got it
Thank God it was empty the night that I got caught with it
What the fuck, man I thought that it was supposed to be

Snatched him like a bitch and threw him in the trunk
The punk thought I was bluffin', but swear I'm nothin' nice
Before I take your life, first wrestle with these mites
I listened to his screams until he went insane
I guess the little mites had finally found his brain
New Rovers pull me over, I'm sentenced to the pen

I kept it deep inside, I done let it fuel my anger
I'm down for all my homies, no mercy for a stranger
The brother in my cell is 16 as well
It's hard to adapt when you're black
And you're trapped in a living hell
I shouldn't have let him catch me
Instead of livin' sad in jail I coulda died free and happy
And my cellmate's raped on the norm
And passed around the dorm
You can hear his asshole gettin' torn
They made me an animal
Can't sleep, instead of countin' sheep, niggas countin' cannibals
And that's how it is in the pen
Turn old and cold and your soul is your best friend
My mama, pray for me
Tell the Lord to make way for me, prepare any day for me
(Why?) ‘Cause when they come for me they find a struggler
To the death I take the breath from your jugular
The trick is to never lose hope
I found my buddy hangin' dead from a rope; 16 on Death Row
[Hook]
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go
Where they find me; 16 on Death Row

[Verse 3]
Dear Mama, they sentenced me to death
Today's my final day, I'm countin' every breath
I'm bitter ‘cause I'm dyin', so much I haven't seen
I know you never dreamed your baby would be dead at 16
I got beef with a sick society
That doesn't give a shit and they too quick to say goodbye to me
They tell me the preacher's there for me
He's a crook with a book, that mothafucka never cared for me
He's only here to be sure I don't drop a dime to God
About the crimes he's committin' on the poor
And how can these people judge me?
They ain't my peers, and in all these years they ain't never love me
I never got to be a man
Must be part of some big plan to keep a nigga in the state pen
And to my homies out buryin' mothafuckas
Steer clear of these Aryan mothafuckas
‘Cause once they got you locked up
They got you trapped, you're better off gettin' shot up
I'm convinced, self-defense is the way
Please stay strapped, pack a gat every day
I wish I woulda known while I was out there
Now I'm straight headin' for the chair
[Hook]
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go
Where they find me; 16 on Death Row

16 on Death Row, Death Row

I see you ain't a player, you ain't balling
And I don't even care who the hell you call in
In this game, it ain't no talking
You can get it started, I nail the coffin
And all I here is ""get your man up off him!""
So why I gotta stop it, this nigga was talking
And I ain't gotta prove you nothing
I do it and you ain't gotta push my buttons
[Bizarre]
This dude in front of me, he weighs a brick
He's quick and I can't get Marshall hit (MARSHALL!)
So I played my position and don't make a move
Been doing this for years, my team we can't lose (D12!)
And ain't nobody, ain't nobody hard
9 o'clock, I'm gonna punch me a guard
Hut one, hut two, I'm ready
Hike, give the ball to Nelly
And nobody out there feels me
Take this ball, you have to kill me
And any player in my way, I'm folding
Damn it, caught holding

Football, Football, I love football
Yes, tres, dos, uno
Dos, tres, fuck, shit, bitch, asshole, son of a bitch
Everybody cuddle, blah I mean huddle
I just stepped in a mud puddle, butthole
Freak, who just tapped on my ass cheek?
Nevermind, let's try quarterback sneak
Cover me, smother me with love that's brotherly
That didn't work, try another play
Hut one, hut two, hut hut, hurry up
I'm reaching up another grown man's butt
Hike the ball, I mean I like Bizarre
But Jesus, he hikes, I think I can feel his balls
My dick is long as it is hard, yeah, so are my balls
It's the longest yard, whoops that's not the chorus
Run it back, wrong song, yeah disregard
That whole statement I just made, what yard line we on?
Our own 5 and our timeouts are gone
Less than a minute left, I just throw my ball
To the sideline to Von, he steps out of bounds
48 seconds left on the clock but every last one counts
Call another huddle, we're down by six
The plan is, to throw the ball to Swift
But he's so god dang high that he trips
Falls and slips, Proof grabs him by his fingertips
And runs the ball all the way down to the one
But he don't get in, but all we need is a put, put.. *mumbles*
But all we need is a touch down and an extra point to win
But then I get sacked all the way back to the ten
God dammit I'mma slap somebody if I get tapped on the ass again
Everybody's laughing now, no timeouts and its now fourth down
We're never gonna make it, wait, I just got an idea
Quick, everybody get naked, Denaun go long
I'mma throw the bomb, c'mon how they gonna tackle you with no pants on
Ass out with a flopping schlong, touchdown! Yeah, I told you
It's the longest yard
[Hook]

[Kuniva]
The new face on the yard, just hand me the ball
I'mma run through all of yall, yall just soft
Even though my cleats is kicking up mud
It's more traction for me, I'm stiff arming punks
High stepping through the end zone
I been grown, I'm so dirty you don't even know my skin tone
It's time to rumble, no time to fumble
And I won't stumble, your frontline will tumble
Playing ball with killers, my team's the realest
Three time offenders, even drug dealers
One of the best running backs there never was
Moving like Barry Sanders, leaving you in the dust

[Proof]
Yak is high, I got the highest yak
Hit the ground so hard I leave tire tracks
Bizarre snap like a fire crack
And my palm more stickier than spider back
Eying my eye, a Mack truck trying to sack us
No matter how big they flying backwards
Wide receiver receiving wide
For every stride in my life, yo, I breathe and die
[Kon Artis]
Defense is playing a pass
Then the quarterback peeps and screams (blue 43)
That means that its time for me
To run out the back like a bat straight outta hell
My tracks burn turf when they excel
I try to lateral pass the ball to Proof
He got dropped and the ball came loose
And shot up like a flare, I gave the ball a stare
And use my lineman's shoulder as a chair
Now I'm flying through the air like a superhero
They can use this pose for a box of cereal
I'm no joke punk, I get my dinerio
For being the best player on my team, what?
As soon as I hear the hut 1, 2, hut
I do one run, run, the screen go run run
Then I cut, spin around in the endzone (touchdown!)
Then I do the ninety shuffle so

You don't got the balls to fit in them draws
So whatever it is you thinking that's got you gassed
You better start rethinking and thinking it fast
Ain't nobody told you, homie, ya wanna ask

Sinister, a menace to many, I'm not friendly
You get shot in a Kennedy fashion
Pop willingly you walking around with Pac's identity
I'm a mockery you 'bout to watch what it's fin to be
I'm not mentally focused but lyrically we got it locked
And it's not about dropping albums, I'll sock a nigga on the spot
You can't help it but to imagine this walking massacre
A madman strapped with a Magnum blow that spasm out ya back
And just stand there and snatch your medallion
See I can't fear any nigga that can not happen
The immaculate Mac handler
That got this wrapping by the back of his neck
A scavenger I'm a threat then you feel me
Like a hand full of syringes
I'm ill enough to scream at your front do'
Blow it off the hinges (nigga)
I'm marksmatic, depressed marksman outta walking
'Cause soon your body they catch me shooting up your carcass
So don't provoke shit, I wish the whole

Niggas is bitch instead of digging a ditch

Just fight for the wrong cause

You ain't in my bracket bitch, following faggots
With wanksta tats on their ass, see ya

The only brother in sight, the flight attendant catch fright
I sit down in my seat, 2C
She approach officially, talking about, ""Excuse me""
Her lips curl up into a tight space
Cause she don't believe that I'm in the right place
Showed her my boarding pass, and then she sort of gasped
All embarrassed, put an extra lime on my water glass
An hour later here she come by, walkin' past

And I refuse to camouflage with other guys
You see my mind is amused of they head noddin'
I so got 'em, as hypnosis of hip-hop
Cause, when I talk they don't just watch
I make 'em feel it, the feelings' unfamiliar
A rush of your adrenaline you can pick up a buildin'
You can become a killer if properly scripted
The first one's free, next time I'll be billin' ya

[Chorus]
Here go your prescription
Here go your prescription
Here go your prescription
Take your prescription
[Verse 2]
Don't let the pain getcha
I swear my lane will provide as a painkiller
A painkiller, a 16 of Percoset
Just let it chill Joe
That lil' burn that you feel, feel good, don't it?
Just sit back and relax and take it easy
And let the beat play
Close your eyes, whoever uninspired
Pay me no mind, I put Adderall in y'all's
Riddle them with Ritalin, attention deficit
Niggas start listenin', and what I'm givin' them
The drug that they brain need
Them niggas sick of hip-hop so they appointed me
And I invented but the IV inside of me
And ignorance was drug of choice but they OD'd
Couldn't alone leave 'em
I am the sole leader
The young soul that the OG's still believe in
And if you not convinced keep on promotin' them
I breathe life in the game, they are Kevorkian
They provokin' suicide but as soon assigned
I drew designs for consumer's minds so in time
I do it for all y'all, do it for all y'all
Don't gotta wait long
The doctor has arrived just be patient
Please, please
[Chorus]
Here go your prescription
Here go your prescription
Here go your prescription
Take your prescription

[Spoken Outro]
See, they say one has to know the past to last in the present. So I, bask in the weather while the presence of these laggers lend me they rappin' to give gifts to my brethren. My nigga this is more than a vocal booth, this is my, only truth, this is my risin' up. So you can ask Black Thought if I know my Roots. Shit, before you? Quest my love for this, just know we would play Q-Tip in the Q before you knew T.I.P. And before you knew T.I.P. I was tippin' strippers properly to pussy poppin'.
So, when you ask me ""What you know about that? "", ironically I'm askin' you the same question partna'. I am hip-hop. Past, present and future. I can rap on some old Primo, sound like the present Sigo and make it feel like a sequel to the new me, bitch. I'm Wale, the prescription"
Ghost Deini,Ghostface Killah,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, summer time, holdin' the nine, split the Vega in half
Jeeps rumble and my dogs puff grass
Bank stoppin', hide your rocks, hydraulic
The kid with the most knowledge will obtain and touch top dollars
Hold me down, hand me my cake
Dust and bake, activate
Fuck your corny debates
I'm like cake, or maybe like ten thousand dollar rabbits
The kid walked through, switch up his accent, now I'm from Paris
Cash the bill, frozen elements in gold
Signs from the most high causes me to break the mold
How the fuck was y'all niggas thinkin'?
You think I fell off the ledge?
The legendary Ghost Deini might be dead?
Never, impossible, pull out black burners like tonsils
Two Galants, hittin' if we got to
Bustin' at y'all niggas daily, wall to wall, hawkin'
Suckin' your teeth 'cause God chain-talkin'
Like Ghostface this, Ghostface that, Ghost sold crack
Now his revelations spoken through rap
Velour-ed down like the Sheikh of Iran
Gasoline CREAM wrapped in hospital bands
Model vans, Michael Davis, it's me against housing
Extraordinary pro-black, sold God creations to control thousands
Catch me at the flicks, Apollo rap Frederick Douglass
You know what? Aiyo, fuck this!
Aiyo, how can I move the crowd?
First of all, ain't no mistakes allowed
Here's the instructions, put it together
It's simple, ain't it? Well, quite clever
[Bridge: Ghostface Killah]
Marvin, Marvin, you were a friend of mine
You stood for somethin', ugh
2Pac, Biggie, ohhhh, how we miss you so
We want y'all both to know
We really love you sooo

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, I'm Gucci down, Wally boots, Jamaican hat, long 4-pound
Ask niggas how I get down
Don't speak much, deluxe plush imaginations
Hold a note like Willie Hutch
You might've bumped into me on the Rikers bus
Weed in my cheeks, gem in my beauty sleep sleeve
Dead serious, knowledge by 2% triple geese
Come on, we juggle mics
Three Card Molly, amps advance to the final
Show these niggas how the way we dance
Hot night, Jamaica
Came through in a booger green '68 Pacer
Mad paper, high as a fuck, truck
Two rappers got stuck that night, I ain't saying no names
They know who, thank you for the chains
Outdoor event, New Year's Eve, Cali weed
30 seconds 'til we tear and decease
Quick, call my seeds, dipped in the crowd
The ho spotted me, he knew not to call my name out
He walked off softly, we exactly
Formed like Christ and his disciples
Black fatigues, lethal-faced doonie, he held the rifle
We had the whole shit shook
Your favorite rappers droppin' they drinks
On the low, tuckin' they links, we made eighty off the books
[Verse 3: Superb]
One of the illest since Magic Johnson, no disrespect
But metaphors'll keep me out the projects
Rap connects'll keep me correct
Aiyo, I wrote this on Donnie roof, after his funeral, on one knee
Thinkin' his killer's followin' me
So to my nigga Donnie, up there
Can you please tell God that we fucked up here?
You got beer, weed, guns, AIDS
All these obstacles, it's hard to make it nowadays
Why's the Devil winnin'? Some say it's our fault
If that's the answer, you know smokin' cause cancer
Let me drop a bracelet, leave a chain behind
My tape stay at the beginnin' 'cause that's how they rewind
Y'all know how we dine, we don't eat swine
And we don't drink wine
If you don't bring me some motherfuckin' cognac, I'll kill you!
I can't feel you, ain't in my senses, and you ain't in my dollars
I fuck with rottweilers, no leashes, no collars, brolic scholars
That's Ghost Deini!!"

It is I, the B-I-G, the B-O-I
Me, oh my, ears to the street and eyes to the sky
Kept my sights on the prize, wide open, worldwide
Like the thighs of a hooker spread, told the girl, ""Bye""
I got bigger fish to fry, niggas wish I would retire
'Cause of the pressure I apply every time I bust a rhyme
None of the rest of ya are tryin'
Watch me stimulate the minds of the masses
While you niggas kickin' it like jackasses
And who you votin' for, Republican or Democratic?
Don't say it doesn't matter 'cause that's how they stole the last one
Assassin's bullet might be waitin' for Obama
Do you think they'll have a brother before Billy's baby mama? C'mon!

When a motherfucker steps out his place
And gets slapped in his motherfucking face
Just because the motherfucker tried to base
The G.O.D., the G.O.D
And while I see his whole clique pass us by
Motherfuckers think they qualify
And for those niggas want to try
The G.O.D., the G.O.D

[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm not caught up in politics
I'm no black activist on a so-called scholar's dick
I come through with the Wu and drop math
And versatile freestyle bombs and phonographs
And deliver, all things in number and weight
Searched to death, on how living things relate
Cause at a young age, I was molded in a religion I relied on
And got caught up in superstition
Scared to split pole, ducked black cats
Once in a while, threw salt over my back
But with knowledge of self from off the shelf
Made things seemed complicated now small like elves
So turn off the lights, light a candle, and have a seance
Pull the lid off the Dean Martin scandal
Witches, warlocks, spooks and holy ghosts
RZA let's defraud the hoax

And gets slapped in his goddamn face

And for those niggas want to try
The G.O.D., the G.O.D

[Verse 2]
We were on the same ship when the slaves were checked
I had to pull your card, you was on the top deck
So I plotted my escape, I saw the thin line between love and hate
And fast from the hog on the plate
I suffered brutal pain, from whips and chains
Punishments that were set to wash the brain
So look listen observe and also respect this jewel
Drawed up, detect and reflect this
Light I shine, because my powers is refined
Through the truth, which manifest through eternal minds
Purified gases and masses the same elements
That helped spark civilization classes
I see brothers quote math plus degrees
Lip-professing-ass niggas can't feed they own seeds

Reality Check,Binary Star,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
I have a request tonight... when you hear this... that is the introduction...

Do you love pianos?

[Verse 1: OneBeLo]
This is how I represent, I rock the mic 110 percent
It's intimate, I keeps the party movin' like an immigrant
Binary Star, superstar, it's no coincidence
Every verse is intricate, this ain't a circus in a tent
We don't get down like them clown and the kids
I'm used to being indigent, who said it's all about the Benjamins?
I want a fortune, I wanna make music and hit the lottery
Fortunately, my music is never watery
That's how it's gotta be as far as I can see
Maybe you should grab a telescope to see my view, it's like astronomy
It ain't all about economy
So the fact that all these wack emcees is making G's don't bother me
Honestly, my number one policy is quality
Never sell my soul is my philosophy
High velocity, lyrics like Nostrodamus makin' prophecy
I told you cats a long time ago it ain't no stoppin' me
I bomb your set: that's not a threat, it's a promise
Got everybody ridin' on my wagon like the Amish
But still I never claim to be a big rap star
'Cause no matter who you are, it's still Allahu Akbar
Better believe this, most rappers can't achieve this
I'm bad to the bone but X-rays can't even see this
See I'm strategic, I letcha money talk, bullshit walk
While I keep it rollin' like paraplegics
Whoever's on the microphone, let it be known
You in danger, I got next like the Boston Strangler
You ain't never heard an emcee speak like this
And Rodney King ain't never felt a beat like this
[Interlude]
That is the main theme
I'm gonna do something else

[Verse 2: Senim Silla]
Get a grip on yourself 'cause you ain't grippin' mines
Life and times, idolize rap guys outta line careers I finalize
Collide with this seranade cyanide you've applied for Silla-cide
The thing that makes killa's hide
Hang 'em high by they gold link necktie
And drain 'em dry enter temper sty now you ain't Ki
So you ain't that high, wanna be aeronautic
Then get swatted for actin' fly
Mastermines crafty rhymes, Ill wind from drafty lines
That chill spines like the Alpines, runnin' up on senim turbines
A close encounter of the worst kind
Go ask the cats that heard I'm lyrical turpentine
Who wanna taste mine? I carry hell on the waistline
God's gift to bassline so let the phlegm fly
I semi 75 through the MI, when I forcefully Jedi
In a bullseye red-eye, heads fly bet I sharpshoot dead-eye
Snooze crews bed bye, Mary Lou flippin', I paper punk rip it
I stomp it, I semper-fi represent, temper I, signified
Walkin' rhyme, ain't nothin' similar
Or Gemini, or in this perimeter 'cept him and I?
Cats be cut dry, I'm a wild wet guy
I be rainin' precipitation 'til it's one inch from neck-high
Arrest fly kids mid-sky without an alibi
Who said you rap tight? You come unraveled by
Slice of this rap scalpel, as quick as apple pie
I'm learned in all schools of thought and shit you baffled by
Conceptual intellectual fox sly
Silla oxide, rhymes flow like a rockslide
You must've forgot I'd slap your ass knockneed and cockeyed
Bruised, battered, broken up, open cut, dipped in peroxide
Death to the Pop Fly

I usually don't do request numbers
Unless of course I have been asked to do so"
Glen Close,Binary Star,"['hip hop', 'jazz', 'r&b', 'blues', 'pop']","Ayo, when I shoot a rhyme I make you shudder
I shoulda shot a MC for tryin to steal my butter
He's bitter cause I'm better, so now he drinks the bottle
I did a dirty duty with a cutie she's a model
I met her at the party scoped her body, name was Patty
She's pregnant with a shorty, said that I'm the baby's daddy
Just paid for sweet potatoes nine months later had a daughter
Coulda said ""I'll see ya later"" but I stayed a child supporter
I didn't love the baby's mother
Now she's colder cause I told her
For the better that my other lady's name was Heather
She's like whatever, whatever, a tear she cried it but she dried it
Deeply hurted, broken hearted, but she tried to hide it
But finally she pleaded that she didn't want to end it or suspend it
She wanted me to sever ties with Heather
So we could be together
I said I'd think about it, but I know she don't believe it
She kissed me on my cheek and as she drove away she speeded
The next day, I'm greeted by her mother
Oh brother, she think I'm stupid
Tryin to play cupid undercover
Talkin about how me and Patty made the cutest couple
Then invited me for supper
Now don't think that I'm petty
But I know what desperate ladies put in their spaghetti
That's why I told her that I ate already
Oh snap, the hell?
Ay yo, ay yo, check this out
Yo, after we parted that's when trouble started
Patty was actin all retarded
I tried to disregard it but she keeps playin on my phone and blowin' up my pager
I wonder, how she keep gettin my number?
But I find out later Patty was a good friend of Brenda, the operator
I didn't sweat it
I coulda did something about it, but forgive and forget
The next day I got a letter
Yeah, you know who wrote it
I can't quote it in the same exact words she stated
But it was saying something about the times that we dated
The baby we created
She said she hated me for leaving
And soon she would get even
Sincerely, Patricia Stevens
After I read it, I knew where this was headed
And I couldn't let it go no further, not even a little
Right in the middle of this thought I was caught by surprise
It was a call from the hospital
Somebody named Dr. Evans
Telling me that my lovely Heather was in room 311
So pedal to the metal I got there in seven seconds
She's alive on my arrival, even though the signs are vital
I asked the doc what happened
A hit and run accident and not a single witness police never caught the driver
Deep inside I knew that Patty did this
Yo, so if you find true love, hold on til the end
Cuz we all know the women outnumber the men
I caught one to play me close like her name was Glenn
And I'll be damned if I ever let it happen again
Fatal Attraction [repeated over scratches]
Yea, yea, I caught one to play me close like her name was Glenn"
Take Em To War,Lloyd Banks,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Bury me with my enemies, dead and gone they remember me
Wasn't me in the dirt nigga
Power hold the show power in the P's
Money bring fleas, and crack put prom queens on knees
Genetics like the jeans on fiends - dirty
I'm seven thirty and I feed off Queens - early
I drive Bentleys and I speed off scenes - pearly
Necklace all over your ex, your wife, your girly
Life flies when it push it to the limit
Fuck just getting by, that’s no way to live it
What the fuck did you take me for?
Try to take something you’ll be laying on the floor
There's a lot less comrades breathing than before
I lose a nigga every time I leave out on a tour
They don’t even respect war
Bullets squeezing out the four
Heaven’s door got to be better than anything we've seen before

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Fuck talking, let’s take 'em to war
Drama after drama, stay laying on the floor
What the fuck do you take me for?
Eye for an eye, time to even out the score
I’d rather be not here, than hungry
I’m sick when I’m not near my money
They want me to lose but I’ma win
I made it there before and I'mma make it there again
[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Bullshit kept to a minimum
Come at me on subliminal, I'ma retaliate straight
You need a M-F miracle
A Saddam bomb lyrical, something chemical
Hungry enough to scrape plates
A sure shotter, and rule sour
The mall's ours, the whores crowd us for twenty four hours
Ignore cowards, stunting one of my super powers
Stupid dollars, swagger and the coupe is stylin
Used to violence, old beef new medallions
You’ve been drowning, I'm flying en route to island
G-Unit soldier in the front line of the new battalion
The car is German, the paint's black, the shoes Italian
I don’t cuddle or kiss French, shorty you whyling
No need for a stylist, I'm already styling
Profilin' jealousy and crowd pilin'
Keep the neighborhood on edge, ain’t nobody smiling for

Watch when I show up gettin' chips off the strip with the piff and the blowup
I'ma kill the block and then leave when it slow up
Get your mind popped off for a sign that you throw up
I just want a lamp to see the weed plants grow up
Niggas get that money, legal or illegally
Bullets put these niggas right where they need to be
Bitches never leavin' me, Porsche pull off easily

Gettin' money dances and twenty five chances

I break the heart in hoes, I gave my heart to sneakers
I owe my life to Jesus, put my faith in God

[Verse 1: Guru]
One of the meanest and the cleanest
And still I'm kind of fiendish when I'm at this
Been doin' this for eons, peons best to catch this
Vision of excellence precise rappin' ability
'Bout to make some dead presidents, mackin' a million, G
The money though, it's got people acting funny yo
As soon as some niggas get some light, they be like dummies yo
Products and puppets and pawns, gettin' played out
When authentic niggas step up, respect be layed out
Major effect to your sector, I'm the corrector
Live and direct, wavin' my mic like a sceptor
Supreme exalted, universal leader
Descendent of the kings and queens, the overseer
The overlord, cream of the crop, crème de la crème
Spent years building with cats in the streets so they my men
Again, Gang Starr has done it
Remember too much jewels back in the days? You'd have to run it
Check it, the ground be hot under our feet
So we be listenin' to beats to keep the cypher complete
Whether you kids be holdin' on the block all day
Or you be puffin' lye out in the back hallway
Or whether you be in school or in the library
Wherever you are, baby paw, realize that your essence
Is divine, son, and let it shine, son, as we refine, son
Ayo, this shit'll blow your mind, son, we're royalty
[Hook: K-Ci and JoJo]
Wherever I go, I want to take nothin' less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I have to stand out from all the rest
Whatever I do, wherever I go
I want to take nothin' less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I just wanna stand out from all the rest

[Verse 2: Guru]
And all the girls they want to spoil me
My honey anoints me with oils, G
After work she greets me and treats me like royalty
Works with me, givin' herself by my side
She don't sweat me for loot, my fame or my ride
A lot of ladies out there be lookin' lovely
But they don't got no control of their life, inside they're ugly
Word to Bugsy, and to Red Alert
Sway and Tech, and Funkmaster Flex to make your head jerk
Chicks go beserk when they see us in the spot
K-Ci, JoJo and Primo, creepin' to the top
And to the sweethearts out there breakin' hearts
While we're takin' part of this hip-hop art
Listen yo, the best way, it ain't always the fast way
And yes, the best way, it ain't always to act nasty
I'll open up the door always before you pass me
Baby Doll, because you're royalty
[Hook: K-Ci and JoJo]
Wherever I go, I want to take nothin' less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I have to stand out from all the rest
Whatever I do, wherever I go
I want to take nothin' less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I just wanna stand out from all the rest

To whom it may concern
This goes out to anybody who’s doing the bullshit, straight up
Yo, everybody’s calling me, my lawyer, everybody on this, ‘yo did you scratch such n such name?
Or this, that, and the third on the record for a hook?’
Y’all keep calling me on that shit and y’all supposed to be hip hoppers and all that, and letting the industry control the rules of the hip hop world that we made?
Y’all need to knock that shit off, that’s some greedy-ass, fake bullshit!
Knock that shit off for real!
Y'know'm sayin'?
And when that shit come and slap you in the face, that greed, I’ma be right there laughing at y’all…
And one other thing… What’s the deal with you break-record cats putting out all the original records that we sample from and snitching by puttin us on the back of it sayin we used stuff?
You *know* how that go!
Stop doing that, y’all are violatin', straight up and down!
Word up, man, I’m sick of this shit
Y’all muthafuckas really don’t know what this hip hop is all about
So while you keep on faking the funk, we gonna keep on walkin' through the darkness, carryin' our torches
Underground will live forever, baby
We just like roaches, never dyin', always livin'…
And on that note, let's get back to the program…"
Payback,Lloyd Banks,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
I made my flow up at the corner store
Mad niggas rapping out here, I just want it more
Turn the music down, you can hear my stomach roar
Bagged a hundred bitches last year, just bagged a hundred more
They hating but everything that goes comes back
Sticky green fun pack, jewelry make me hump-back
Back packers want that and they ain't bout the diamond shit
Goon gone commercial, who the fuck you think you rhyming with
I got the drama, kid, and my Obama whip
Bitches running up on my stage, Lil Mama shit
Ugh, lil' mama thick, and my time is slim
Come bout thirty minutes after I put the condom in

[Hook: 50 Cent & Lloyd Banks]
I'm getting to the dough, Louie on my foot
Put the pedal to the floor, is all a nigga know
Payback, don’t come around here disrespecting
We dont take that, I’m on my letters every second
And my hearts so cold, man I don't trust a soul
It’s funny how the bullshit goes, you never know
Payback, don’t come around here disrespecting
We don't take that, I’m on my letters every second
[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
They crown me with the punch hat, who better?
I hit red skins, smoke green, and spit blue pepper
Benz blue leather, jet cool weather
Cool meaning hot, so I don’t need the top
Calm down, breath and stop
Start and I’mma skip your pulse
Miss my life’s the shit
Calamari, shrimp, and boats
C-notes, 5 Ferrari, different coast
I’mma suits em up, well I probably ain't gotta lift my toes
I shut my doors on ‘em like Jehova's witness
I done made it to the top like I said, I told you bitches
They don’t really want me they just want my riches
So motherfuck them all: friends, cousins, and sisters

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
I turn the club to TV, come dancing with the stars
Then I’m in your ear, in her ear, amping a menage
Nigga done made the money, but never knew how it felt
In a hundred pair of pants, thats a hundred different belts
Stress kills, chronic helps, pussy just for the moment
Balling like a Hornet, see I get it, I want it
Everybody knows, heat hurts you got to show me first
Magician, but I can turn them to a Holy Ghost
You can bring two, three, four of them, the war's won
Tick tock boom, make ‘em all run, come on son
Big talk's just talk, I let my money bark
Put my Ferrari in park, give them a running start
Go, cause I don’t feel a single drop of pressure
No, eagle strap a foreign guap collector
He better stop all the hate, he know my ends straight
I clap your girl make the bed break, leak the sex tape
[Hook] x2"
Home Sweet Home,Lloyd Banks,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Yeah, twenty miles an hour in my long Bentley
Shame on you hater, this what the Lord sent me
Shit lately I’ve been practicing my gas face
Cause that’s what I’ma give 'em when they land in last place
Hand right by the hammer, ain't too many seein Santa
So they wanna take my gifts, but I wrap em with the fif'
My regular scent is piff, currency, and Cashmere
You done drove your bitch away, I told her she can crash here
Yeah I’m counting paper like the cashier
Living like I’m limited, breathing like it’s my last air
My boy in and out the box, super stupid soldier
Told me if he could do it again he’d do it over
Poverty’s king cobra, squeeze your life out
Cause it's the fatalities and causalities I should write ’bout
These rappers ain’t iced out, they just fooling niggas
Running round town fakers, zirconian cubic niggas

[Hook]
Only money matters in the game, fuck the fame
I gotta eat dollar signs, feed my hunger pain
Music like heroin, leave you numb the same
Play me like I’m something sweet, be apart of summer slaying
Most hate it most doubt it, that's what they shouted
I’m on top now, there’s nothing they can do about it
Y'all better have y'all guns
Cause walking where I’m from, there ain't no way around it
Home sweet home
[Verse 2: Pusha T]
You motherfuckers can rap 'til you blue in the face
You’ll probably turn into smurfs with the time that you waste
Throughout history they thrown shots at the greats
But I shoot back, the Lord ain't designed me for hate
I’ve never understood Martin Luther with the speech
With the whole world watching me, turn the other cheek?
Never, so there’s one left to die in the streets
Cause his long arms happen to connect with his reach
Try to kill you then, them near misses was God’s kisses
True Hollywood Story, ghetto Todd Bridges
Diff'rent Strokes that nigga broke, this nigga rich
You only read about the cars that I paddle shift
You only dream about the hoes that I dabble with
Balcony views like a postcard, imagine this
White stones, black steel, cold chrome
This city’s my doormat, bitch I'm home sweet home

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Niggas see me where you see me, shit I'm always seen
Off the Queens magazines, pissy hallway scenes
Paying crowds, hunger screams, pressure crumbles teams
Fuck being humble in the jungle where they fumble dreams
Drugs for the living, Henny payment for the body
Crosses for the power, ghetto bitches for the smiley
Pitbull, I bit my way out the cage, whats happening?
Competition got me on the Rampage, Jackson
Part of my reaction to they corny ass raps
Keep flirting with death and get your horny ass clapped
Back for more me, rat tat, kiss the ring, beat respect out them
Bloody heads, turn Timberlands to red bottoms
Fifty bottles just a start now that's how you do it
Carbon fiber through the Spyder playing rider music
Ain't no question of my resume, I gotta prove it
Life’s a bitch and I get blowjobs reclinin' through it
[Hook]"
So Forgetful,Lloyd Banks,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Boy wonder, one summer I was stunting
Winter falls when I cake more, bag models and crush ‘em
I ain't never been a cuffa, my lifestyle is custom
Chromy Cartier Carrot glare keep me hustling
My lamborghini sunk in, dimes humpin in tight bikinis come when I’m out here doing something
I know it’s something for me, do you think its you?
Problem is I’m thinking her too, and your crew
A girl smooth, got a body like a spur do
And I wanna cruise, hit gears to make your soul move
I’m so cool, ice grills for my cold jewels
Make my own rules, baby I’ma finna rap in old school
She asked why should she, you think you special?
Hell fucking yeah, now come here, let me bless you
Hit yeah, no air hit you in the pretzel
And I don’t remember how I met you, so forgetful

[Hook: Ryan Leslie]
I deal with a lot of pretty girls
So forgive me if I don’t remember you
Yea, so forgive me girl I’m so forgetful
And there’s too many New York City girls
So forgive me if I don’t remember you
If I don’t remember you
[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Wet spots on the mattress as champagne splashes
Designer glasses, a couple backstage passes and they fine ass's
Damn how did y'all get here? How are you getting home? ’Cause a nigga gone
Get dressed quick grab her ass grab my phone
Walking out alone, smelling like chronic bag cologne
Driving home still drunk hope they don’t pull me
Cause I’m riding with the bully and it's loaded fully, feel me?
Game tight girl I ain’t a rookie, hear me?
I love the chips, treat 'em like my family,
And we got a thing for the light, ball out, fall out
Do the same thing tonight, flash backs to ass claps
It’s going down long as she black jack
Weed up just to help me to snap back
The last text I got says ""I missed you""
I must of missed something, so forgetful

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ryan Leslie]
Flights in planes, overseas, don't be mad, you know my steez
All at once I'll be gone, if you miss me, play this song
I'll do me, you do you
It was good girl, but we through for now
So I bet you I'll forget you
[Hook] x2"
Father Time,Lloyd Banks,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
Yeah they see me moving
They gonna need to stop, drop
Off the face of Earth but, I'mma make it pop, hot
These niggas are not, now
Watch me take my spot
Got money got power and respect baby
I just hope times on my side
I've been trying all my life
Every block someones dying
Always high, here's our life, come inside

[Verse 1]
Energy's my ammunition, like AK shells
So think about that when you plan on dissing, go straight to hell
Bred to be balling since a baby kicking
I had the smell, brand new money ladies sniffing, they take a L
I take a shit on rappers all it's worth
Can't die over, must conquer the world first
Like a monster to media on my beautiful girls search
High and low I am no thing you tamper with
Made the plan you should cancel it, make examples I trample shit
Drop your hair I am cancerous, answer this, who can handle this?
Scandalous, I dismantle these ants and piss on a trucer
You think I seen the future, how I wham, quick recouper
Fire hand, wham turn a brand new man, big producer
Gift from heaven, living legend and I come from Queens
Robbing leggin' 3-5-7 in my fucking jeans
Suffering and fucked up schemes
Twin Bentleys matching beamers on a couple beams
Try my sentencing
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Murdered half of y'all on my mixtapes
Come wrapped up in my wrath
Now I'm laughing look at your rib cage
Your ass been in a slump
Cum blasting all in your bitch face
Success is what they want
Tongue lashing will get your shit sprayed
Have it how you want, blood bath
I'm a sharpened switchblade
You'll be smiling for life
Love flashing I got the shit made
Forget where I'm at, now I passed 'em around the sixth grade
Passion for my profession outlast anyone you could name
Hood fame got me riding in wood grain
Look lame, Staten, Harlem to Brooklyn
They know I'm cooked 'caine took aim rappin would bang
I could change, but this sport ain't a good game
I'm strapping sir, back seat in the passenger, semi-auto massacre
Shopping while I laugh at you, rappers feed my appetite
Metaphors will tackle you, these niggas ain't half as nice
Playboy in my afterlife, real nigga with cash and ice
Drop the bread pass the dice, hope I crack twice

U Got It Bad,Usher,"['r&b', 'pop', 'hip hop']","[Intro]
Ooh-oh
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No-ouh

[Verse 1]
When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then maybe...

[Chorus]
You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad
[Verse 2]
When you say that you love them and you really know
Everything that used to matter don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (you can have it all and)
Flowers, cards and candy (I do it just 'cause I'm)
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl
I want you to know I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her: ""I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world""
Ladies say: ""I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can""

[Pre-Chorus 2]
See, I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad

[Chorus]
You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad
[Electric Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else..."
On The Double,Lloyd Banks,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
I'ma need a double, bring it on the double
A bottle each hand, I'm the fucking man
Cars double, broads double
And I don't have a girl, so I can't get in trouble
See I can do what, I can do whatever I want
Drink 'til I'm drunk and smoke my blunt
My baby outside you should hear my trunk
They gon' talk about this stunt all month

[Verse 1]
Don't nobody see y'all because we are the best
The mighty mighty Unit, blue fitted, blue vest
Watch me get 'em, who's next? Who wanna be the one?
I'm shining royal diamonds in the nightclub with my gun
Back to the money twenty four hours committed
And I'm strapped like The Mummy, you a dummy you can get it
You ain't getting nothing from me, better get it how you live it
All my days is sunny, I stay out where you visit
Rich nigga I ain't had to think all day
Cash made, Rosé, in my mink all day
I own VIP, have a drink on me
Girl we run this city that's how shit gon' be
[Hook]
I'ma need a double, bring it on the double
A bottle each hand, I'm the fucking man
Cars double, broads double

See I can do what, I can do whatever I want
Drink 'til I'm drunk and smoke my blunt
My baby outside you should hear my trunk
They gon' talk about this stunt all month

[Verse 2]
Shorty say I talk a lot of shit
I told her ""Fuck talking, I can back it up quick""
She seen as I'm sitting in two hundred thousand whip
And I ain't never seen a vagina I couldn't hit
I roll up like a Marley in my brand new Klum Kardi's
Lamborghini, Ferrari, when I pull up at the party
She ain't usually snotty, now she showing off her body
Flaunting them while she walking and claim that's she's riding shotty
Moet, Henny, Bacardi, have ya chasin' everybody
Outside million four-wheeled Ducati
G's, check! Bentley! Jet!
Sour on deck! Frizzy! Neck, baby!!!

[Hook]
I'ma need a double, bring it on the double
A bottle each hand, I'm the fucking man
Cars double, broads double
And I don't have a girl, so I can't get in trouble
See I can do what, I can do whatever I want
Drink 'til I'm drunk and smoke my blunt
My baby outside you should hear my trunk
They gon' talk about this stunt all month

I can do what, I can do whatever I want
I can do what, I can do whatever I want

Rock and Roll,Edan,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'alternative']","[Verse 1: Dagha]
I be the headbanger with the double-edged razor
The breath-taker, dragon slayer-slash-savior
Assassinator, flamethrower fascinator
My Dagha/dagger blade cascade and catch the mayor
Captivator, spectator activator
Palladium's packed, they pay me in stacks of paper
Aggravated assault, halt the path of strangers
The strangler, long-ranger devil devastator
Educated rebel with the heavy metal flava
Levels is elevated to decibels of danger
Volts from the generator blow the detonator
Decimate the place and left the radius a crater
I cater to the greater entertainer
And blaze the remainder with the energy of anger
Celebrate the maker, I'll mutilate later
And play a naysayer like an amplified bass player

[Verse 2: Edan]
The Riders on the Storm enter with Doors open
To bring raw dosage in the form of swarm locust
Beatles and Byrds, they seem evil and absurd
Gather with The Eagles who swerve to form herds
Butterflies made of Iron ride the horizon
Giving Creedence to the Revival of Posiedon
Who feeds in the Clearwater, you fear slaughter
The Lovecraft author pens the horror for tomorrow
Zombies and walking dead stalk the Talking Heads
Insects with open legs halt with awful dread
All along the web, the thread remains red
With bloodshed that led to where the Little Feet fled
To lost places, thought lost for all ages
With Small Faces sittin in walls of tall mazes
That overlook The 13th Floor with long gazes
Connected to the earthly core through Elevators
Check, the Underground is made of Velvet
Where butter-soft brothers talk tough on wax but ain't sell shit
Every cracker that rap ain't the Elvis
My Aqualung Cult-ivates the Blue Oyster shellfish
I design my Pearls Before Swine
And form rhymes to take you to a world before time
Where living things coexisted with Crimson Kings
Who on the Moon's Dark Side painted pretty things
That illustrated lessons conceived by The Mothers of Invention
Who also built a Stairway to Heaven
It's a present only to be stolen by a thief
The Judas Priest who unleashed his devil magic
My mental fabric, too thick for Lenny Kravitz
Who imitates Jimi Hendrix in every facet
Semi-automatic rap heavy metal jackets
Kill with mathematics then build on Black Sabbath"

I got to shake you out my system
'Cause with the fucking and kissing
And all your emotions mixed in puts me in a tough position
Baby, what am I supposed to do?
I can't control my actions when I'm close to you
We been away too long girl we're overdue
I guess the cake ain't enough you want to eat it too
See me and you have a magnet in between that keeps pulling me closer
I'm like an addict for your scream, your fully loaded toast
Automatic with the beam, the baddest on the coast
I got to have you like the green, your swag is more than most
I got a sex drive that won't allow me to lax
Bring on the next five, look how they grind on my lap
Booty, breast, thighs keep your boy relaxed in back
And you deserve way more than that, I'll just fall back
[Hook: Jeremih]
I think I love you
Don't let me get in the way (Get in the way)
Don't let me stop you girl
From doing your thing (Doing your thing)
'Cause I don't deserve you, no, no
I don't want to hurt you
Play with your mind (Play with your mind)
Have you running in circles
Don't let me get in your way (Get in your way)

[Outro: Jeremih]
I've been thinking a long time
And wishing you were just all mine
So maybe this is the wrong time
That I deserve it, I don't deserve it
I've been thinking a long time
And wishing you were just all mine
So maybe this is the wrong time
That I deserve it, I don't deserve it, no
I don't deserve it, I don't deserve it
I don't deserve it, I don't deserve it
I don't deserve it, I don't deserve it
I don't deserve it, I don't deserve it"
You Cant Stop Us Now,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Nas]
From Willie Lynch to Willie Hutch, right on, we Superfly
Made Gucci the shit, Louie too, suits and ties
Player trophies, pray to Goldie
Picture wax museums full of Black Panth's and triple OGs
Aunt Jemina hoes, historic horse shit
Girls from long time ago, stagecoach with the horse, kid
Witchdoctors, good ol' pickpockets
Sip moonshine, so-called coons, shines, and darkies
I love y'all, pyramids to cotton fields
To Wrigley Fields, forgotten men who did get killed
Crispus Attucks, the first blasted
Peace to the rich lady purse snatcher shot in the back
I know your hunger kid, I know they hung your dad
Burnt ya mama crib, I know that hurt you bad
Minstrel shows, from gold to shackles and back to gold
We act like we home, matter of fact, we are home
Bad attitudes, octoroon skin tones
Slave food turned to soul food, collards to neck bones
Betsy Ross sewed the first American flag
Bet she had a nigga with her to help her old ass!
[Interlude: Eban Thomas]
As James Baldwin says:
""You can only be destroyed by believing that you really are
What the white world considers - a nigga""

[Chorus: The Last Poets]
Ohh, no matter how hard you try
You can't stop us now (oh, no matter)
No matter how, hard you try
You can't stop us now (no)

[Verse 2: Nas]
Can't be stopped
Yo, on Dateline, the other night they showed hate crimes
Gave a blood time cause he fought with his canine
Beastiality, humane society
Go to China, see how they dine, see what they eat
Better yet, ask PETA, whoever, which animal makes suede?
If not for suede, would you have survived the Dark Ages?
Cannibal ways of the ancient Caucasians
Stare you like you're steak tartar, pinot noir
David Star on the chain of Sammy Davis
He helped pave the way for Southern crankers and them Harlem shakers
Now we gettin' our papers, they try to censor the words
And stop our money comin' but you can't escape us - haters
[Chorus: The Last Poets]
Ohh, no matter how hard you try
You can't stop us now (oh, no matter)
No matter how hard you try
You can't stop us now (no)
You can't stop us now"
Sooner Or Later Die 1 Day,Lloyd Banks,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
I know that sooner or later
I'm going, to meet my maker

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
I never thought in the beginning I would see his fall in the end
Pay a man to paint pictures on the wall of my friends
1990s sins it was all for tha ends
Ends for the rims, rims for the Benz, Benz full of skins
'Fore you talk about money, make a mil first
You don't dig me, sig me, either kill me or get killed worse
Your song's in need of a real verse
Son of the man, God feel me like he feel church
And right after speech time, it's sparking the street crime
Niggas throwing anything at you, except a peace sign
Live by the gun, die by the gun
'Til my time come, I'mma spend time with your son
I can just see them sad when they remind you of them
Them would've did the same thing, We're confined to the slum and those that don't adapt are either blind, deaf or dumb
Spine of a squirrel, mind of a girl set to run
[Chorus Lloyd Banks]
Why run nigga?
It's gon' come nigga
But 'til the day it does
I'ma hold my shit down, take it in blood
Outsiders get no love

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Fishin' in a swamp in a desert, Lizard sweater
Half a billy in fives, 2 macs in da ride
They call him Coke-Komo, Co-signed by kings in the rich homo
Made me 3 mil in a month, Pockets mumped
Ferrari still by tha projects buildin', real dot tech ill
They dumb out wit uzi’s and wheels yo
Steak’ll take meetings, beefin' too much dough — the legion
Bat in my hand — the sweet eastern
Losing money fellas, we won’t have that, better grab that
Or don’t come back, or get clapped at
Me and my vixens in tha kitchen
One sucking dick — I paid to her ass shots and sent to the Brinxton
Dons eating calamari, coke in a lawry’s jar
Never broke, hardly rob, eat with the godly’s god
Get wit the gods or get wit the mob
From Shaolin to Queens, we wild wit the beams

[Chorus Lloyd Banks]
Why run nigga?
It's gon' come nigga
But 'til the day it does
I'ma hold my shit down, take it in blood
Outsiders get no love
[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Don't blame me, blame Southside
That's what made me ma, crazy high
But I’ll spot a traitor out my lazy eye, ladies spy
I’m the one you wanna have that baby by — Maybe I'm
Better of alone, Keeps me in my zone
Nights roam, white patron, GT in my chrome
Alien phone home, ET in my throne
I achieved what they wanted, ease into they stomach
When you broke time slow, but ya weeks are numbered
And bad news keeps you weak and numb
Like when i lost my old man, Damn near threw up the whole weekend son
I shoulda listened, friends turned foe, was told so
The fo' fo' make a nigga run like Ocho - cinco
In my mink ho I'm a protege of pimpin'
Livin' for the sippin', now that they rolled away to Clinton
Marijuana shippin' Champagne lobster shrimpin'
Game trained not to listen, maintain pop the clip in

[Chorus Lloyd Banks]
Why run nigga?
It's gon' come nigga
But 'til the day it does
I'ma hold my shit down, take it in blood
Outsiders get no love"

All of you Africans that know how to do things that's working for other people
Y'all need to open your own business
Save your money, quit paying motherfuckers for jheri curls
Quit paying motherfuckers for perms

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Wake up, jumped out my bed
I'm in a two man cell with my homie Lil 1/2 Dead
Murder was the case that they gave me
Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?
I'm only eighteen, so I'm a young buck
It's a riot, if I don't scrap, I'm getting stuck
But that's the life of a G, I guess
Eses way deep, shanked two in the chest
Best run 'cause brothers is dropping quicker
Uh, too late, damn, down goes another nigga
Bouncing off the walls, throwing them dogs
Getting that rep as a young hog
It ain't nothing like the street life
You better be strapped with your shank, 'cause ain't no fist fight
So I guess I gots to handle mine
Since I did the crime, I gots to do my time
[Chorus: Daz Dillinger & Donny Hathaway]
Them say me grow up to be nothing
Look at me now and tell me what you see
I am what I am, it's only me
Little ghetto boy
Playing in the ghetto street
Whatcha gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility?

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Now I'm holding a dub, sitting on swoll
27 years old, up for parole, stroll
I'm back up on my feet with my mind on the money
That I'll be making soon as I touch the streets
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump, but now they blast, right
But it ain't no thang to me
'Cause now I'm what they call a loced-assed OG
The little homies from the hood with grip
Are the ones I get with 'cause I'm down to set trip
Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so what you wanna do?
Didn't know he had a twenty-two
Straight sitting behind his back
I grabbed his pockets and then I heard six caps
I fell to the ground with blood on my hands
I didn't understand
How a nigga so young could bust a cap
I used to be the same way back
I guess that's what I get (For what?)
For trying to jack the little homies for they grip
[Chorus: Daz Dillinger & Donny Hathaway]
Me learn many things from what me see from the street
The outcome of what I've come to be
Little ghetto boy
Playing in the ghetto street
Whatcha gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility?

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Something for the real OGs to get with
Some facts, made our made, now you runnin' but don't play
Like every single day, really, though
You know me, I'm the smooth macadamien, gaming them for my homie
No needing being calm if you pack right
And learning just enough to keep your sack right
Late nights, I wonder what they getting for?
Early morning on the corners, what they hitting for?
Seven young G's put they serve down
In a G ride, east side's where they swerve now
Not thinking about what's really going on
Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone
I spent four years in the county with nothing but convicts around me
But now I'm back at the Pound
And we expose ways for the youth to survive
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right
So make all them ends you can make
'Cause when you're broke, you break, check it out
So ain't no need for your mama to trip
'Cause you's a hustlin'-ass youngsta, clocking your grip
[Chorus: Daz Dillinger & Donny Hathaway]
Now me finally grown as you can see, still an OG
For life and always remain to be
A little ghetto boy
Playing in the ghetto street
Whatcha gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility?"

I Need A Girl Pt. 2,Diddy,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: P. Diddy, Ginuwine & Mario Winans]
Yeah, is that bounce right here
Time to move on, time to be strong
Don't stop now, straight to the top now
Someone who truly understands
How to treat a man
This is what I need

[Verse 1: P. Diddy & Ginuwine]
Girl, you made me believe again
If you happy, then be with him
Go 'head, mami, breathe again, go 'head, mami, breathe again
Don't stop now straight to the top now
Go 'head, mami, make it hot now
I need me a love that's 'gon make my heart stop now
And what I need is simple, five foot five with dimples
Potential wife credentials
Know about the life I'm into, life I've been through
And how I had a triflin' mental
So ride with me, G Force fly with me
Times get hard, cry with me, die with me
White beach sands, lie with me
My advice is forget the limelight
Let's make love, while we listen to Frank White
(This is what I need) So tight, now I understand life
[Chorus: Ginuwine with Mario Winans, & P. Diddy]
What I need (Yeah, take that), oh, baby
Is a pretty woman next to me (A pretty woman, yeah, baby)
To share the dreams that I believe (Dream with me, believe in me)
Maybe we could start a family (Start a family, baby)
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need

[Verse 2: Loon with Mario Winans & P Diddy]
Listen to me now, what should I say now? Come on ma
Been a whole day, now I wanna lay 'round
And sip coladas, dipped in Prada
I'm smooth as Erik Estrada, dipped in dollars
We out in Vegas Nevada, bubble bath in the champagne glass
'Bout the size of a campaign ad
You don't know how you look to me
But if love was a crime you be a crook to me
'Cause mami, I done been around the world
Seen a lot of places
Been around your girl, believe I read faces
I can tell she don't want me to prevail
But I, learn my lesson watchin' Sean stressin'
So why listen to her and start guessin'?
Mami, you ain't ready to ride then start dressin'
I need a girl to receive my mom's blessin'
Confession, my love no contestin'
I need affection
Yes, I need affection, let's go Mario
[Bridge: Mario Winans]
Girl, what the hell is on your mind?
I could be dumb but I'm not blind
There's something leaking in your mind
Don't look to good for you and me
Always getting weak
That ain't what I need, baby

[Chorus: Mario Winans with Ginuwine]
Is a pretty woman next to me (Oh, please, baby)
To share the dreams that I believe (I need a girl in my life)
Maybe we could start a family (Start a family baby)
Someone who truly understands
How to treat a man (How to treat a man)
This is what I need

[Verse 3: P. Diddy]
Ayo, the sun don't shine forever
But as long as were here, then we might as well shine together
Never mind the weather, go somewhere and get our minds together
Build a love that'll last forever
So let's stop the pain, stop the rain
Put stress to rest girl, stop the games
Name the spot, mami, I got the plane
Roll through rough, I got the Range
Ma, I got some thangs, known to put rocks in rings
Pushing hundred foot yachts and thangs
Your man don't play, have you ever been to Saint-Tropez
Or seen a brotha play a Mandolay?
Girl I wanna just look in your eyes and watch the sun rise
No more lies, no more tears to cry
No more reasons for leavin', you I believe in
Love you 'til the day I stop breathing
I love you, girl
[Outro: Mario Winans & Ginuwine]
This is what I need
Is a pretty woman next to me
A pretty woman next to me
To share the dreams that I believe
When I wake up in the morning
Maybe we could start a family
I wanna see your pretty face
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
Oh yeah, oh yeah
This is what I need
Is a pretty woman next to me
To share the dreams that I believe
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need baby
Is a pretty woman next to me
Standing next to me
To share the dreams that I believe
When I wake up in the morning
Maybe we could start a family
I wanna see your pretty face, baby
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
Oh yeah, oh yeah
This is what I need
Is a pretty woman next to me"

[Verse 1: Method Man]
I breaks it down to the bone gristle
Ill speakin' scud missile, heat-seekin'
Johnny Blazin', nightmares like Wes Craven
Niggas gunnin', my third eye seen it comin' before it happened
You know about them fuckin' Staten kids, they smashin'
Everything, huh, in any shape form or fashion
Now everybody talkin' 'bout they blastin', hmm
Is you bustin' steel or is you flashin'? Hmm
Talkin' out yo' asshole
You should have learnt about the flow and peasy Afro
Ticallion stallion, the chinky-eye and snot-nosed
From my naps to the bunion on my big toe
I keeps it movin', know just what the fuck I'm doin'
Rap insomniac, fiend to catch a nigga snoozin'
Slip the cardiac, arrest me, exorcist hip-hop possess me
Crunch a nigga like a Nestle, you know my steez
Burnin' to the third degree
Sneaky ass alley cat, top pedigree
The head toucher, industry party bum rusher
You don't like it? Dick up in you, fuck ya

Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin (That's right, all you corny-ass rap motherfuckers)
The special technique of shadowboxing (Better go back and check your fucking stacks)
Because your naps ain't nappy enough (Shadowboxing)
And your reach ain't rugged enough, bitch

[Verse 2: GZA]
Yo, I slayed MCs back in the rec room era
My style broke motherfuckin' backs like Ken Patera
Most rap niggas came loud but unheard
Once I pulled out, round 'em off to the nearest third
Check these non-visual niggas, with tapes and a portrait
Flood the seminar, tryna orbit this corporate
Industry, but what them niggas can't see
Must break through like the Wu, unexpectedly
Protect ya neck, my sword still remains imperial
Before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial
We reign all year 'round from June to June
While niggas bite immediately, if not soon
Set the lynchin', inform the execution date
As this 2000 beyond slang suffocate
Amplify sample through vacuum tubes compressions
Cause RZA to charge niggas twenty G's a session

[Verse 3: Method Man]
When my mind start to clickin'
And the strategy is mastered, the plot thicken
This be that Wu shit
I don't give a cotton-pickin' fuck
About a brother tryna size a nigga up, I hold my own
Hard-hat, protect the dome
Look at mama's baby boy actin' like he grown
No time for sleep, I gets deep as a baritone
Killa bee that be holdin' down his honeycomb, loungin', son
Wu brother number one
Protect your neck, flyin' guillotines, here they come
Bloody bastards, hard times and killer tactics
Spittin' words plus semi-automatic slurs, peep the graphic
Novel from the genie bottle
Hit the clutch, shift the gear, now full throttle
Time to bungee to the next episode, I keeps it grungy
Hand on my nut sack and spittin' lunghies
At a wack nigga that don't understand the fact
When it come to RZA tracks, I don't know how to act
Real rap from the Stat', Killa Hill Projects, how to be exact
Break it down, all in together now
Things are gettin' good, lookin' better now
...and some other shit

The only man a ho wait for
Is the sky-blue Bally kid, in '83 rocked Tale Lords
My Memorex performed tape decks, my own Fostex
Watch out for Haiti bitches, I heard they throw hex
Yo, Wu whole platoon is filled with raccoons
Corner-sittin' wine niggas sippin' Apple Boone
This ain't no white cartoon
'Cause I be duckin' crazy spades
The kid hold white shit like blacks rock ashy legs
Why is the sky blue? Why is water wet?
Why did Judas rat to Romans while Jesus slept?
Stand up, you're out of luck like two dogs stuck
Ironman be sippin' rum out of Stanley Cups, unflammable
Noriega, aimin' nozzles, stay windy in Chicago
Spine-tingle, mind boggles
Kangols in rainbow colors, promoters try to hold dough
Gimme mine before Po wrap you up in so-and-so
I ran the Dark Ages, Constantine the Great, Henry the 8th
Built with Genghis Khan, the red suede Wally Don
[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
I judge wisely as if nothin' ever surprise me
Loungin' between two pillars of ivory
I'm lively, my dome piece is like building stones in Greece
Our poems are deep, from ancient thrones I speak
I'm overwhelmed as my mind roams the realm
My eye's the visions, memory is the film
Others act sub-tile, but they fragile above cloud
They act wild and couldn't budge a crowd
No matter how loud they get, though they growl and spit
Clutch they fists and throw up signs like a Crip
And throw all types of fit
I leave 'em split like ass cheeks and ragged pussy lips

[Verse 3: RZA]
Aiyo, camouflage chameleon, ninjas scalin' your building
No time to grab the gun, they already got your wife and children
A hit was sent from the President to raid your residence
Because you had secret evidence and documents
On how they raped the continents and lynched the prominent
Dominant Islamic, Asiatic, black Hebrew
The year 2002, the battle's filled with the Wu
Six million devils just died from the Bubonic Flu
Or the Ebola virus, under the reign of King Cyrus
You can see the weakness of a man right through his iris
Unloyal snakes get thrown in boilin' lakes of hot oil
Up boils your skin, chickenheads gettin' slim like Olive Oyl
Only plant the seed deep inside fertile soil
Fortified with essential vitamin and minerals
Use the sky for a blanket, stuffin' clouds inside my pillow
Rollin' with the Lamb, Twelve Tribes a 144,000 chosen
Protons-Electrons-Always-Cause-Explosions
[Verse 4: GZA]
The bank's a G, all CREAM downs a bet
Money feed good, opposites off the set
It ain't hard to see my seeds need God-degree
I got mouths to feed, unnecessary beef is more cows to breed
I'm on some tax-free shit by any means
Whether bounty-hit scheme or some counterfeit CREAM
I learned much from such swift cons who run scams
Veterans got the game spiced like ham
And from that, sons are born and guns are drawn
Clips are fully loaded and then blood floods the lawn
Disciplinary action was a fraction of strength
That made me truncate the length one-tenth
Woofers thump, tweeters hiss like air pumps
RZA shaved the track, niggas caught razor bumps
Scarred tryin' to figure who invented
This unprecedented, opium-scented, dark-tinted
Now, watch me blow him out his shoes without clues
'Cause I won't hesitate to detonate, I'm short-fused"
Never Forget You,Lupe Fiasco,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: John Legend]
Take me to that old familiar place
Take me to memories we won’t erase
Take me to all that we had
Good and the bad
I’ll never forget you
I’ll never let you go
I’ll never forget you
I’ll always remember, I hope you know

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Let the record reflect the records we set
Best foot forward with every step
And let’s push towards it, never regress
And let’s remember, if ever we get
Down, the places that we came from ’round
And all the good times on the bad side of town
The upside of bad, flip it upside down
Came from the bottom but we up high now
Believe, and from this view we achieved
We looked back at the rules we received
And how we broke those, dismantled and rewrote those
And the ghost still alive in the photos
Sounds of the summer, day and go wise
Cold wind blowin’ through a city on fire
Moments of the past, came here to find you
Not to relive them, just to remind you

And let the evidence show, the future’s so bright
It’s never been more, not like tonight
We walk into the glow, right into the light
The past all around us, the time of our life
The first love kisses, the broke heart disses
This is just like a first-class ticket
Back, to the first written rap
The crumbled-up paper and the pen with no cap
The hand-me-down clothes and the unturned hat
The hookers on the corner and the kids sellin’ crack
The needles in the yard where we used to play catch
Stories from the project we could never go at
Or to, these are shades of my youth
Trials of a child, everything truth
Moments of the past, comin’ back to find us
Not to relive them, just to remind us

Take me to that old familiar place
Take me to memories we won’t erase
Take me to all that we had
Good and the bad

Everything cherished, remembered in my heart
So you will never perish, you will never part
I tell ‘em all about you, drummin’ in the park
We put you in the ground, but I see you in the stars
Go’n, take a bow, a round of applause
The best dad ever, always ready we are
Love always shines, that’s how I’ll find you
In case you forgot, I hope this reminds you

Take me to that old familiar place
Take me to memories we won’t erase

Box so I can shop, sometime it doesn't register
So I return to the ring, like Return of the King
With the habit of a hobbit it makes it hard to drop it
I'm a klepto stealing
And it gets the best
Just when I guess that I left those leanings
I be back on post in a trench coat scheming
[Chorus]
Much is more what we got in store
Just believe me, (than they can ever see)
Much more than they can see
Is how it'll always be, believe me

[Verse 2]
Uh, yeah, uh
So I get back into my stance, revert to my dance
With a shirt full of pants
And my accomplice got a purse full of pants
A pocket full of purses, with no intent to purchase in the plans
And we rehearsed it 'til it's perfect
Just to dodge the searchers of the man
Just to surface outside, then return of all the merch to stay
In the service of the perfect understand, uh, yeah
And I boost myself
So from the coal car to the caboose I'm felt
From the rear to the engineer
From the L to the Underground Railroad
From the redline to the TGV
A champion fighter for whom the bell tolls, L-U-P
Little engine from the hood, the hustler in me
Known to hit the track like John Henry
Just give me my glasses
My eight ounce Everlastes' and a Michael Buffer entry
Shoplifter, tag switcher
That's me, nigga I'm back with ya, uh
[Interlude]
Championship is here, yeah
F&F is here
1st & 15 is here
Madison street, we back in here
Chi-town is here
Lupe Fiasco
Fahrenheit 1/15
Revenge of the Nerds
Part II
Can we bring the hook back
Bring my girl Yummy back
Know what I'm saying, let 'em know that we still rolling
Know what I'm talking 'bout

Living In The World Today,GZA,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: RZA & GZA]
Yo yeah, check it out, son, check it out, son
Yo Wu, can I get a soo?, live in the place to be
You got the capital G, Z to the A, MC
Givin' a mad shout out to the Ranch Crew, from the old school
And we gonna take y'all back, know what I'm sayin'?
Lyrical sorcerers right here, the fathers, the cream of the crop, son
Yo, check it

[Hook: GZA & RZA, Method Man]
Well, if you livin' in the world today
You be hearin' the slang that the Wu-Tang say
Niggas that front, we don't have 'em
So we blast 'em, alright, well, ok
Well, if you like the way it sound, then clap, man
And if the women love it too, well, then raise your hands
But only raise your hands if you're sure
Punk niggas shatter like a glass jaw, break it

[Verse 1: GZA]
My rhyme gross weight vehicle combination
Was too heavy for the Chevy's, is chased out the station
Double-edged was the guillotine that beheaded it
Gassed up, fuckin' with some regular unleaded shit
Heads roll on hillsides behind ropes that bind-in
X marks the spot on the scope
Heavily armed, military is necessary, it's a gamble
MCs bet they best at every
Powerful parable ditties might harm
If tampered with, set off and strike like pipe bombs
Flashbacks to the ""Duel of the Iron Mic""
Look out for these fatal flying spikes, so massive
Sleep-holds, put strangle on commercial angle
Microphone cords tangled from being Star Spangled
Now, who could ever say they heard of this?
My motherfuckin' style is mad murderous

Well, if you like the way it sound then clap man (clap man)
And if the bitches love it too well then raise your hands (Come on)

Yo, I know a lot
Well, can you demonstrate somethin', nigga?
Huh, I'd rather not
I'm talkin 'bout stacks, cousin
Nigga, that's what I got
Cash Rules the world
Well, Cash Rules the spot

[Verse 2: GZA]
My preliminary attack keep cemeteries packed
Of niggas who think it ain't like that
MCs are gunned down like being run down with mad trucks
Then, God struck, religious niggas call it ""bad luck""
Rap celeb, you got caught up in the web
Now, bees are stingin', yo, that niggas em-singin'
I'm just swingin' swords strictly based on keyboards
Unbalanced like elephants and ants on see-saws
I throw raps that attack like the Japs on Pearl Harbor
MCs be out like bank robbers
Fleeing the scene, to be a sole survivor
DJ, the getaway driver
Tried to dip, but he dive, I socialize on vocal vibes
On tracks stabbed up with razor-sharp knives
Criminal subliminal minded rappers find it
Hard to define it, when narrow is the gate
For fat tapes and then played out and out of date
Then I construct my thoughts on site to renovate
And from that point, the God made a statement
Draftin' tracements, replacements in basements
Materials in sheet-rock to sound proof the beatbox
And microscopic optics received through the boxes
Obnoxious topic, major labels, flavor tropical
Punchlines, that's unstoppable
Ring like shots from Glocks that attract cops
Around the clubs and try to shut down the hip-hop
But we only increase if everything is peace
Father You See King the police

Aiyo shorty, yo that's my word
Oh, y'all smelling y'all piss now y'all think y'all gold
Yo anybody get caught flinging over here
I'm returning 'em, that's my word they getting blasted
Anything from 220 to 140, that's mine
Y'all need to step the fuck off
Y'all niggas ain't crazy for real

[Hook 1: GZA]
Yo, the fiends ain't coming fast enough
There is no cut that's pure enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you

[Verse 1: GZA]
I'm deep down in the back streets, in the heart of Medina
About to set off something more deep than a misdemeanor
Under the subway, waiting for the train to make noise
So I can blast a nigga and his boys, for what?
He pushed up on the block and made the dope sales drop
Like the crash in the Dow Jones stock
I had a connect to cross-sales, to catch more mill's
Than ho-bitches got birth control pills
I'm in the park setting up a deal over blunt fire
Bum nigga sleeping on the bench, they had him wired
Peeped my convo, the address of my condo
And how I changed a nigga name to John Doe
And while we set up camp, we got vamped
Put the stake through his heart, I ripped his fucking fangs apart
Snake got smoked on the set like Brandon Lee
Blown out the frame like Pan Am Flight 103
He got swung on, his lungs was torn
A kingpin just castled with his rook and lost a pawn
A regular on the block that played lookout
For preying predator with a Glock, he should have took out
[Hook 2: GZA]
No neighbourhood is rough enough
There is no clip that's full enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you
Fiends ain't coming fast enough
There is no cut that's pure enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you

[Verse 2: GZA]
It's mandatory that I supply all my troops with mega firearms
Big apes and spread 'em out like crops on a farm
To get cream, sometimes they repaint the scene
Like the last episode on gates, and other niggas
Plant bombs till the smoke from the blast becomes thick
And flows through, all they knew, he's gun sick
His Glock clicks like high-heeled shoes on parquet floors
Mad sick, stand on hills and invade wars
Filthy foul, shovelling dirt, he's out to hurt
For instance, chop off hands, attack worth
His idols would lock down airports and extort
Some import, catching ten percent of what the fiends snort
Up in the ski resorts, up in hills
They move keys and had the skis making drops on snowmobiles
The plan was to expand, catch seven figures, release triggers
And live large and bigger than my nigga
Who promised his moms a mansion with mad room
She died and he still put a hundred grand in her tomb
Open wounds, he hid behind closed doors
And still organizes crime and drug wars
[Hook 3: GZA]
Fiends ain't coming fast enough
There is no cut that's pure enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you
No neighborhood is rough enough
There is no clips that's full enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you
There's no cuffs that's tight enough
There is no niggas that's fuck with us
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you"
Black Friday,Lil' Kim,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Angie Martinez, Nicki Minaj, and Lil' Kim]
It’s funny ‘cause, you know, we’ve been asking people what they wanted to know
I mean, clearly, you’ve been having this thing with Kim
And I don’t know, just thinking about you and where you were from and that you’re a rapper –
And I’m thinking, sure, I know things have gotten crazy and people are assuming -
Even though you say it’s not specifically about her - that Roman’s Revenge is for Kim
Umm, you know, she just really jumped out the window, and you gotta be careful when you pick fights
And that's what I've learned in this business, you just never know –
SHUT THE FUCK UP!

[Verse 1]
Who the fuck want war?
Fed Ex beef straight to your front door
It will be a murder scene
I'm turnin' Pink Friday into Friday the 13th
A'ight you Lil' Kim clone clown
All this buffoonery, this shit stops now
Time for you to lay down, I'm sick of the frauds
I put hands on this bitch like a spa massage
We all know your last name is what got you your job
You a put together gimmick, something like a collage
Since you puttin on a show, you gon get the applause
Clap, clap, lift ya frame like a fucking garage?
This hood shit you and Drake ain't built for
This the shit this other bitch almost got killed for
I still counting what Hardcore generated
Bet my shit keeps spinning like its syndicated
Corny broad I'll leave you bloody like you menstruated
You hot air ass bitch, should have been deflated
This ain't a championship fight I been the greatest
See the fact is what you doing... I did it
Lames trying to clone my style and run with it
Thats cool. I was the first one with it
Yous a Lil' Kim wanna be, You just hate to admit it
I'm the blueprint, You ain't nothing brand new
Check ya posters and videos, You will always be number 2
I seen them come. I seen them go. Still I remain
Sweety you on your 14th minute of fame
Im over 10 year strong still running the game
Cut the comparison, I'm in the legendary lane
Fighting for a spot... Child please I'm solidified
With my hands tied, you couldn't beat me if you bitches tried
Either you high or sippin that shit Wayne on
I get top dollar for whatever my name on
Go stick your head in a tornado- Brainstorm
I drop bombs- Flex, Napalms
Black and yellow, we'll pull up in your ghetto
Giuseppes when I step out, posted up in stilettos
Pussy so pink like my kitty sayin hello
If I whistle they'll pistol whip you in all 5 boroughs
I'm from Brooklyn I be everywhere comfortably
Now who pumped you and told you to come romp with me?
You the type to run your mouth and then run from me
I'm poppin off in your hood with no company
C'mon, Queens ain't showin you no love
I was there the other night poppin bottles with the thugs
You like Washington heffa I'm Benji
You got a buzz right now, I had a frenzy
Oh yeah welcome to the fam Fendi
You need to stop, you're not hot you're a burning match
That means the end is near soon, copy that?
Oh I see they really got you gassed, like I'm a thing of the past
Betta slow down dummy, you about to crash
Stank pussy ho, I'm givin you a bath
Thermometer in hand and I'm comin for ya ass
Who you think you gettin past?
I see right through you, your whole shit is made of glass
[Clip of Nicki Minaj's 'Right Through Me']

[Verse 2]
I draw back
I'm a Brooklyn thorough bitch, rep for my borough bitch
Never been the type to have beef and try to settle shit
I ride out til the wheels fall off
And my niggas squeeze til the last shell go off
Fuck your whole team all I see is a bunch of wierdos
You'sa airhead bitch- scarecrow
Ain't nothin old but my money bitch
This is grown liquid assets
Benjamin's my daddy you Young Money bastards
You and Diddy- sorry bunch of swagger jackers
I mothered you hoes I should claim you on my income taxes
Bobby Fischer in the flesh, taught by the great
So on my next move I'm yellin' checkmate
I smell a massacre
I'm Charles Manson, you don't stand a chance with her
Jeffrey Dahmer and you lookin like lunch to me
Bout to kill all you bitches like Ted Bundy
Leave your whole head red like Pegg Bundy
You're hilarious... thanks for all the laughs
You're garbage, so I'm takin out the trash
You? Shit on me?
C'mon baby girl- Ain't enough ass shots in the world
You're a nuisance, you'd probably steal my new shit
But you could never fuck with me
So chuck it up deuces
All around the world I ball like a ball team
I stack chips, call me Miss Rothstein
Tricks is for kids silly rabbit you're my offspring
Kim more anticipated than a Lebron ring
[Outro: Lil Kim mocking Nicki Minaj]
""I mean I know... I know you guys asked me if Roman’s Revenge was about Kim...
And no, I, it’s not about Kim...
Actually if Kim thought it was about her, I’m so sorry
I’m so sorry, I apologize, Kim
I don’t know, I just had temporary insanity... I lost my teeth and my mind..."""

[Verse: GZA]
Restaurant's on a stakeout, so order the food to take out
Chaos outside of Sparks Steak House
Maintain the power, I feel the deal's gone sour
Nigga missed the wedding, late a fuckin' half-hour
And his man who bought land from Tony Starks
While he was contractin' bricklaying jobs in city parks
He's a loan shark, interest rate’s a grand to a finger
In the garment district, got it sewn like Singers
'Cause all that talk blasphemy
This kid after me for the heist in a Burlington coat factory
Fuck it! He turned state's on my nigga, Castro
This copilot who used to drop rice sacks of blow
On this remote area we label Dead Man's Island
Two hundred miles south from Thailand
Right off the docks, I got luxurious, custom-made yachts
Burial plots for my niggas hit with fatal shots
There's no need for us to spray up the scene
I use less men, more powerful shit for my team
Like my man, Muhammad from Afghanistan, grew up in Iran
The nigga runs a neighborhood newsstand
A wild Middle Eastern bomb specialist
Initiated at eleven to be a terrorist
He set bombs in bottles of champagne
And when niggas popped the cork, niggas lost half they brains
Like this ex-worker — tried to smuggle a half-a-key in his left leg
Even underwent surgery
They say his pirate limp gave him away
As the Feds rushed him, comin' through U.S. Customs
Now look whose on the witness stand singin'
A well known soprano, a smash hit from Sammy Gravano
Here's the plan: Minimum for the hit — two hundred grand
Half-time at the game, blastin' niggas out the stands
The sharp-shooters hit the prosecutor
Judges are sent photographs of they wives takin' baths
Along with briefcase filled with one point five — that's the bribe
Take it or commit suicide!
First rule — anyone who schemes on the gold in Syria
I want they small intestines ripped from they interior
I got a price for those jewels, ship 'em freight cargo
Don't forget to launder the cream through Wells Fargo
Reconstruct those processing plants for the call of Costa Rica
Four hundred barrels of ether
Two hundred pounds of reefer, and fifty immigrants with fake Visas

As well as the Park Slope and Gowanus neighborhoods""
""This was the first battle of America""

Mix collaboration man, little man and his girl

Plus I'm analyzin' young youths on roofs, you know
Three-time felony brutes toll together
Tropical trees puff, whatever
Yo, we could go run up on kids for leathers
What drug? Faculties bubble keys for G's
Cream flow like seven seas, hit chicks — Guyanese
Word up, hold your head before you fall out the morgue route
The devil want that, let's get my niggas locked all out
Change for better, that be my only vendetta
When life feed your seed right, he's breathin' indeed, right

Life is like Tarzan, swingin' from a thin vine
Shatter dreams, then mirrors don't need a press spirals
Aim at the white shadows with big barrels
Of Moet-ers, the bald headers milkin' Armarettas
Who fear none, crushin' all personal vendettas, yo
They use guns while we angrily shot arrows
You better keep your eye on the sparrow
[Interlude: U-God]
Rugged rhymsters, crooked crimesters
Dime droppers, Twenty-five-to-lifers
Backstabbers, low blowers
Illegal... cocaine growers
Starvation, profanity
Anxiety, brothers tryin' me
Gun slingers, dead ringers
Investigative reports

I Gotcha Back,GZA,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: GZA and RZA]
I gotcha back, but you best to watch your front
Cause it's the niggas that front, they be pulling stunts
I gotcha back, but you best to watch your front
Cause it's the niggas who front (they be pulling stunts)

[Verse : GZA]
I was always taught my do's and don'ts
For do's I did, and for don'ts, I said I won't
I'm from Brooklyn, a place where stars are born
Streets are shot up, apartment buildings are torn
And ripped up, stripped up, shacked up and backed up
From fiends, cause the bosses on the scene, they got it cracked up
Kids are slinging in my lobby
Little Steve and Bobby
Getting paid but it's a life-threatening hobby
Yeah, they still play hide-and-seek
The fiends seek for the crack, and they hide and let the cops peep
Grown folks say they should be out on their own
Before the gangs come and blow up their mom's home
Because they lifestyle is hectic, so fucking hectic
Blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Bullets are ejected
My lifestyle was so far from well
Could've wrote a book with a title ""Age 12 and Going Through Hell""
Then I realized the plan
I'm trapped in a deadly video game, with just one man
So I don't only watch my back, I watch my front
Cause it's the niggas who front, they be pulling stunts
Back on the Ave of Livonia and Bristol with a pistol
Sticking up Pamela and Crystal
You know your town is dangerous when you see the strangest
Kid come home from doing the bid and nothing changes
What is the meaning of CRIME (what?)
Is it Criminals Robbing Innocent Motherfuckers Everytime?
Little shorties take walks to the schoolyard
Trying to solve the puzzles to why is life so hard
Then as soon as they reached the playground, blaow!
Shots ring off and now one of them lay down
It's so hard to escape the gunfire
I wish I could rule it out like an umpire
But it's an everlasting game, and it never cease to exist
Only the players change, so
[Hook: GZA and RZA]
I gotcha back, but you best to watch your front
Cause it's the niggas that front, they be pulling stunts
I gotcha back, but you best to watch your front
Cause it's the niggas who front (they be pulling stunts)
I gotcha back, but you best to watch your front
Cause it's the niggas that front, they be pulling stunts
I gotcha back, but you best to watch your front
Cause it's the niggas who front (they be pulling stunts)

Cause it's the niggas that front, they be pulling stunts
I gotcha back, but you best to watch your front
Cause it's the niggas who front (they be pulling stunts)
I gotcha back so you best to watch your front
Cause it's the niggas who front, that be pulling stunts
I gotcha back but you best to watch your front

[Outro: (LP version only)]
Your, tech, nique, is, mag-ni-ficent
When cut across the neck
A sound like wailing winter winds is heard, they say
I'd always hoped to cut someone like that someday
To hear that sound
But to have it happen to my own neck is... ridiculous
*man gasps for air*"

The Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth
The Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth
The Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth

[Hook: Killah Priest]
Life is a test many quest the Universe
And through my research I felt the joy and the hurt
The first shall be last and the last shall be first
The basic instructions before leaving Earth
Life is a test many quest the Universe
And through my research I felt the joy and the hurt
The first shall be last and the last shall be first
The basic instructions before leaving Earth

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
Knowledge this wisdom, this goes back when I was 12
I loved doing right but I was trapped in Hell
Had mad ideas, sad eyes and tears
Years of fears but yo my foes couldn't bear
I searched for the truth since my youth
And went to church since birth but it wasn't worth the loot
That I was paying plus the praying
I didn't like staying 'cause of busy-bodies and dizzy hotties
That the preacher had souped up with lies
Had me cooped up looking at loot, butt and thighs
During the service he swallowed up the poor
And after they heard this, they wallowed on the floor
But I ignored and explored my history that was untold
And watched mysteries unfold
And dropped a jewel like Solomon but never followed men
'Cause if you do your brain is more hollow than
Space oblivia or the abyss
With no trace of trivia left with the hiss
Does it pay to be deaf, dumb and blind?
From a slave we was kept from the mind
And from the caves he crept from behind
And what he gave was the sect of the swine
When the Bible, it condemns the pig
I don't mean to pull your hems or flip your wigs
But we used to wear a turban but now we're in the urban
No more wearing beanies and dress like the genie
No hocus pocus 'cause I focus on the facts
And put it on the tracks, embroid it through the wax
I speak on Jacob, it might take up some time
And too much knowledge, it might break up the rhyme
I did it anyway just to wake up the mind
Of those who kiss stones or prays on the carpet
Those who sit home or sell books by the market
Need to chill and get their mind revived
For years religion did nothing but divide

The Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
I strolled through the books of Job to unfold
And open bibles, instead of hoping on revivals
Calling on His name and screaming hallelujah
When he hardly knew ya, that's how the Devil fooled ya
See look into my eyes brethren, that's the lies of a Reverend
Why should you die to go to Heaven?
The Earth is already in space, the Bible I embrace
A difficult task I had to take
I studied till my eyes was swollen and only arose when
I found out that we were the chosen
I deal with the truth and build with the youth
And teach my son as he kneels on the stoop
Son, life is a pool of sin, corrupted with foolish men
And women with wicked minds who build picket signs
To legalize abortion, the evil eye extortion
I quiz son with my wisdom
Before I converted, I was perverted and knowledge was asserted
The study of wisdom, I preferred it
The understanding, it gave me mental freedom
I even learnt Caucasian were really the Tribe of Edom
The white image of Christ is really Cesare Borgia
And uhh, the second son of Pope Alexander
The Sixth of Rome and once the picture was shown
That's how the devils tricked my dome
I prophesized to save a man, but no one gave a damn
For my nation, the seed of Abraham
Blessed with the tongue of Hebrew
Now we're strung on needles and some are plunging evils
So study and be wise in these days of darkness
Peace to my nephew Marcus

Dead Presidents Remix,Bing Cypher,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","(Verse 1) (Bing Cypher)
I find it hard to believe that the game has life
When all I see is a clown with fingers made out of mics
Heart carved out of ice
Eyes that are stage lights
And a face that's always covered with a hood dark as the night
A presence in itself who's trying to seem right
Persuading all of its followers to sell their soul and life
Exchanged with the fame and glory
To preach all the hoods stories
Infecting and advertising the wrong just like Maury
But I can see right through it with x-ray eyes
Like Clark Kent from Smallville with limits up in the sky
Never could I relate it so never did I debate it
Or try to be fitting into the hood because I ain't it
And rap I used to hate it
Repeated it like a statement
Cause I couldn't fuckin' relate to half of the shit they played
I'm a hypocrite I played
Even tried to relay it to my own life stories so I could impress the game
But reflection, infection and it started infecting mine
Cause in retrospective we wanna make connections right
It's not about the cars, the girls, the fame
Just some big digit bills of presidents who came
So I started switchin' my style
Took me a little while
Didn't get my respecting but started making connections
Lupe's Food and Liquor got thinkin' a little bigger
And I told myself to take the shot and fuckin' pulled the trigger
(Verse 2) (Bing Cypher)
From '91 till the day that be the end of me
I might be gone, but my lyrics are here for infinity
Forever and continuing
Foundation for remembering
History is made everyday; Cheers to memories
So stop all the confusion we started a revolution
And call me Captain Planet I'm cleaning up the pollution
The game needs change
I'd rather see the dollars
Like the dead presidents we need some old school scholars
Like the wind I wish that it could blow away
And we could stop all the songs about the size of chains
The cars candy paint and the rims with bling
All the commercializing got me goin' out of my brain
Insane just like the straight jacket padded wall shit
I'm all restless like I'm on Adderall bitch
So never could I be heard my lyrics are absurd
Causing a ruckus from the inner cities to the burbs
And the public views me as a little bit irritating
My flow is underground you say that it's irrigated
But I rule the basement dojo I'm the master
Rap's Mr. Miyagi I'm on and off waxin'
The mainstream pulls and erodes all of the acting
And with my classes I can't see past it
I'm praying for my chance hands cuffed and kneeling
You can't hold me down like Wayne there's no ceilings
(Verse 3) (Gro)
Yo feel the rhythm of the Illmatic
While Im preachin' my seminar that's Socratic
Syllables Flippin' like acrobatic
On top of the world chillin' in god's attic
While I got your mind hooked like a heroin addict
But don't shoot up and lose touch for the rush
Young prospect go to school you hoopin' too much
NBA veteran got you tuning in later than Letterman
Listening to me deliver like Stockton to the Mailman
Speakin Frank like Anne
Concentrating while I camp
Using knowledge as my tool to help me pay to go to school
But I could use some more money so Holla(cause it)Cost me
Rhymes meaner than a fuckin Nazi
You blind if you can not see
Yes its Jesse the nice kid of the family
So Kind I'd cut you to pieces and give it all to charity
Voluntarily there ain't no repairing me
My heart is strong got the pride of a lion
I got your future in my hands like the minds of the Mayans
My desire to put my dreams higher than the Empire State of mind that I'm in
Shining brighter than the diamonds from Sierra Leone or Arizona
Put your minds to ease, like a gram of medical marijuana
Verbal elements got the mommas hotter than a sauna
Peaceful like the Dalai Lama
This my term call me Obama
Droppin' lyrical bombs like Osama"

My mama said life would be this hard
Growing up days as a Black girl scarred
In every way, still, you've come so far
They just know the name, they don't know the pain
So please hold your heads up high
Don't be ashamed of yourself, know I
Will carry it forth till the day I die
They just know the name they don't know the pain, Black girl

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
I do it for the people, I do it for the love
I do it for the poet, I do it for the thug
This is for victory, and this is for the slaughter
I do it for my mother, I do it for my daughter
Promise I'll always love ya, I love to kiss and hug ya
You and your brother should be looking out for one another
I'm so blessed, man, y'all the reason I got up
Somebody put his hands on you I'm getting locked up
I'm not playing, that's the prayer I'm saying for Diani
And if I die then she'll be protected by Amani
That's her bigger brother and I love the way he love her
She a girly-girl, she love to imitate her mother
But she a Gemini, so stay on her friendly side
She'll put that look on you, it's like somebody friend just died
My pretty Black princess smell sweet like that incense
That you buy at the bookstore supporting Black business
Teach her what black is; the fact is her parents are thorough
She four reading Cornrows by Camille Yarborough
I keep her hair braided, bought her a black Barbie
I keep her mind free; she ain't no black zombie
This is for Aisha, this is for Kashera
This is for Khadijah, scared to look up in the mirror
I see the picture clearer through the stain on the frame
She got a Black girl name, she living Black girl pain
This is for Makeba, and for my Mamacita
What's really good Ma, I'll be your promise-keeper
I see the picture clearer through the stain on the frame
She got a black girl name, she live in black girl pain
[Hook]
Mama said life would be this hard
Growing up days as a Black girl scarred
In every way, still, we've come so far
They just know the name they don't know the pain
So please hold your heads up high
Don't be ashamed of yourself, know I
Will carry it forth till the day I die
'Cause they just know the name they don't know the pain, Black girl

[Verse 2: Jean Grae]
This is for Beatrice Bertha Benjamin who gave birth to Tsidi Azeeda
For Lavender Hill, for Khayelitsha
Athlone Mitchell's Plain, Swazi girls I'm repping for thee
Manenberg, Gugulethu; where you'd just be blessed to get through
For beauty shining through like the sun at the highest noon
From the top of the cable car at Table Mountain; I am you
Girls with the skyest blue of eyes and the darkest skin
For Cape Coloured for realizing we're African
For all my cousins back home, the strength of Mommy's backbone
The length of which she went for raising, sacrificing her own
The pain of not reflecting the range of our complexions
For rubber pellet scars on Auntie Elna's back, I march
Fist raised, caramel shining, in all our glory
For Mauritius, St. Helena; my blood is a million stories
Winnie for Joan and for Eadie, for Norma, Leslie, Ndidi
For Auntie Betty, for Melanie; all the same family
Fiona, Jo Burg, complex of mixed girls
For surviving through every lie they put into us now
This world's yours, and I swear I will stand focused
Black girls, raise up your hands; the world should clap for us

My name is Shady
I never meant to leave you (I never meant to leave you)

[Verse 1]
You see that chick in the gym, checking me out?
Any second I'm 'bout to stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a pill and I'm recklessly wreckin' the house
That was supposed to be breakfast, where the heck is it now?
There's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse
Man, I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope, guess I'll re-route
Maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch
Oh, jackpot, yeah—open sesame, mouth
Down the hatch, and the feeling—you can't match it
I rap-tat-tap on your door with a damn ratchet
Attack-tack-tacking a whore with a damn hatchet
A knapsack packed with like forty-some Xanaxes
Shorty, come back, I'm tryna score me some lapdances
I'm 'bout to relapse, so, baby, pour me some Jack Daniel's
Formula 44D and 40s with bad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch, I'm back at ya

All I wanted to do is just say hello, yeah

[Verse 2]
My equilibrium's off—must be the lithium
I don't need to buy any drugs, man—people give me 'em
It just becomes everyday, extra-curriculum
No reason in particular—it was strictly fun
A fifth of rum and two bottles of 151
Fifty-one people asleep in my damn living room
Excuse me, hun, but what is your name? Vivian?
I woke up next to you naked, and, uh, did we, um?
Of course, we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy, hun?
I'm looking for the torn wrapper, but there don't seem to be one
No offense, baby girl, I don't mean any harm
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from
I find the package, and I'm cool—I immediately run
Like Speedy Gon-zales to see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of 3's—I'm fiending for some
My head is pounding to the beat of the drum
[Chorus 2]
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello
Do you happen to have anything on you
To make my mood mellow?
Some are oval and some are pink
Some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello

[Verse 3]
Oh, those were the days—they certainly were
It's hurting me to know that I'll be closing that curtain for good
Word-word, chk-word-word, chk-word, chk-chk-word
I second that and I third, rushed to emergency surgery
To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased
He's no longer getting them free—hundred bucks for these Percodans
Plus, it's getting to be where he'll lustfully search the den
Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles be hurtin' him
Tirelessly, on the phone trying to rustle up
Muscle relaxers for his back and a couple of Paxils
Now, he's doubling backwards, and he's stumbling back
Slipped and fell, hit his back, boom, heard something go crack
Now, he's up in the bathroom, like he's busting a nat
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact
I'm just busting my own chops while I'm busting a rap
Resuscitated and rejuved, so fuck it, I'm back!
[Chorus 2]
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello
Do you happen to have anything on you
To make my mood mellow?
Some are oval and some are pink
Some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello

So keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, you lose

[Verse 2]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just racin' time, where's the finish line?
[Chorus]
So keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, you lose

[Verse 3]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it goin', keep the loving goin'
Keep it on the roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby, I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I've been down this road too many times before
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to

[Chorus]
So keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, you lose

You lose, you lose

Hollywood Divorce,OutKast,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: André 3000]
Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars, success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
And I'm a star
Yea, and I don't have to go to Hollywood
'Cause Hollywood come through my neighborhood with cameras on
I really think they're stealing from us like a sample song
I really wish one day we'd take it back like hammers home
The hurricane come and took my Louisiana home
And all I got in return was a darn country song
This whole country wrong
Oh, but you right if you just put a little ice on
And cut your mic on but you don't even write songs
But Hollywood make you spit like a python, I meant Cobra
I'm so not sober I'm high like a Hollywood
Coffee or soda, you can call me a roller
Hold up, your grill's glistenin'
Spent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different
What's the real sense of it?
Bling bling, I know and did you know
I'm the creator of the term, I just straightened the perm
They let it sit too long, they just makin' it burn
Make a movie of our lifestyle, but they earn
Like a dead body burned on the mantle piece
That's why I try not to lie on wax like this candle grease
And I be's the little nigga, cooler than anti-freeze
Defrost on your window pane - Lil Wayne
But in Hollywood it's Litt-le Wayne, don't make me none
So that's why I got a pre-nup
I do
[Hook: André 3000]
Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars, success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Yeah, Yeah
A is for Adamsville
B is for Bowen Homes
See if I give a fuck if you like me you know I don't
If she ain't got a good head on her leave that ho alone
If she do got some good head on her let her sing a song
D is for what I serve, I don't be on no curb
She ain't no junkie neither, I ain't no dope dealer
But she keep coming back three stacks must be some crack
Put that pipe in her lap, she ain't know how to act
Now that I've got your undivided attention, I'm
Gonna say this and run under condition one
Promise me you gon' stack, promise me you gon' ball
Promise me you'll invest three fourth of it all
For what? So your kids, kids, kids can have some cheese
Can't get with it? Get, get, get, get, get on your knees
'Cause wealth is the word
Rich is round the corner from the curb
Don't like what I write? Shoot me a bird
[Verse 3: Big Boi]
(Starts off)
Tenth grade, the way was paved for me and Dre to create
Like Dr. Frankenstein of arts and crafts
Now could we make ah a difference
Antwan Patton and André Benjamin
Been jammin' for you crabbing rap niggas and journalists
That's quick to misprint public and private business
Then retract back for deaf ears and think it's dismissed
Part two the sequel all new 'Kast
Just ain't the same gang of nerds on the internet
Slandering your name behind that screen name
They're lame and their life is pretty plain
M&M's with no nuts
Won't show up face-to-face straight bitch made
Like puppies on the nipples of a mutt
Address it on a case-by-case basis like the judge
What about these lyin' ass hoes tryin' to plot
Or these niggas on the block who want the queen
(Nigga please)
But even she can walk we'll miss her we ain't gon' fake it
But God don't make mistakes must be something bigger waiting

[Hook: André 3000]
Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars, success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce
[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
I do, love you but you hate me at the same time
Lights, camera, action, it's game time
Do you take this here as your lovely wife?
To love her and cherish her for all your life?
I solemnly swear to dare share and take you there
And me and you together, baby, we a lucky pair
It's been a long time, we walked a thin line
Others say they got you but you been mine
As I sit back and watch all them cat fights
Domestic violence — is that right?
But you love the Dogg, gave me the spotlight
And now I'm growin' up, showin' up, blowin' up
I never ever thought that we would separate at all
But you played me like a game of football
Used to feed me, need me, dress me
Now it's so messy straight cut out and left me

[Outro: André 3000 + Snoop Dogg]
Hollywood divorce
All the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing
Look at blues, rock, jazz, rap
Not even talkin' about music
Everything else too
By the time it reach Hollywood it's over
But it's cool
We just keep it goin' and make new shit
Take our game, take our name
Give us a little fame
And then they kick us to the curb that's a cold thang"

What up, dawg?
You all right?
Chillin', cold as hell
Yes, it is. Hey, bus didn't come here, didn't he?
No. Hey look, you got 15 cent?
Nah, I got just enough to get on the bus, I'm broke
We gotta go to the store. Alright, man?
Quick, ‘cause I'm short
Yeah, we gonna have enough time to go to the store?
Nah, look
You should just, how much you got there?
I only got 75, I'm sure I got a dollar, know what I mean?
Just throw it in there, they ain't gonna know. You know what? Ayy look, I'm sick of takin' this damn bus everywhere, man
You gotta make some moves or somethin'
I know, look, I'm tryna get rich
I got a baby on the way, I ain't even got a car. You know what I'm sayin'?
I still stay with my moms, 21 and still with my moms
Yeah, look, hey, we gotta make some hit records or somethin', you know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause I'm tired of bein' broke
[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Cause all I do is yearn a life without a concern
And dream of havin' a turn to earn money to burn
Mappin' out my strategies to get rich, huh
My desire's like a scratch that needs to get itched, huh
'Cause, man, I live in the D, this shit ain't given for free
Nothin' is different to me, so what else is there to see?
I'll be the prisoner to flee from all of this misery
I'm not wishin' to be another fish in the sea
But just an MC, so listen to me for this and agree
You're missin' the key, you ain't even in the vicinity
Unconditionally, my aspects to cash checks
My objects were never to swab decks
It's up to you, the decision is yours
If what you vision is tours, or a missionless course
When your shit is in the stores, 'cause you can be a star

[Hook: Eminem]
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue par
'Cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you, baby, 'cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue par
'Cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything

I can't be broke for the rest of my life!
Em: Yeah, I hear what your sayin'. Look, there's got to be somethin' better, you know what I'm sayin'?
De: I can't live like this for the rest of my life, man.
Bummin' rides everywhere I go.
Em: Yeah, what's up with Lexus's and Land Cruisers?

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Yo, I'm not about to chance it and dismiss handlin' business
I'm cancelin' Christmas to gamble and risk this
Financial interest is the matter at hand
I got an adequate plan for stab at a grand
I grab what I can and do what I must
Pursue what I lust, it's true that I just
Choose the few that I trust
Them's the people that I still got
Fuck with gangsta Philpot, get your grill shot
The 5 Ela for life: my man Thyme
Proof, Kyu and Denaun, we move through in the nine
My crew's true and divine, we never fronted
We just wanted to be funded, and live to be a hundred
Instead of hunted or bein' wanted as fugitives
It's all about a man plannin' what his future is
What he can do for his to be a star

Never will I ever utter never to myself
Fall in love with defeat, throw my endeavors on the shelf

Really in subconscious
They see a star no longer the underdog
So nobody wanna walk with ya
They all talk like you think you was a god n'shit

So the more you see, it's few niggas speakin' like me
So they put me in the box with he, and he
And them which is more of a circus than a fair

They say I'm Lupe, they say I'm Lil' Wayne
They say I'm too Jay to portray new-lay
They say I'm too nice to be a rapper
The prerequisite is gun clappin' so what happened
They label me a backpackin' nigga on fashion
I laugh at 'em, though Mr. West I ain't mad at ya
See, he in his soul mode, I'm in my go go
Only thing in common is these fuckin' Matsumotos
Yeah live from the SoHo, and hov told me I'd blow Joe

That you were sitting home, just wishing we
Could go back to when it was just you and me
I'm sorry for the times I would neglect
I'm sorry for the times I disrespect
I'm sorry for the wrong things that I've done
I'm sorry I'm not always there for my sons
I'm sorry for the fact that I'm not aware
That you can't sleep at night when I am not there
Because I'm in the streets like every day
I'm sorry for the things that I did not say
Like how you are the best thing in my world
And how I'm so proud to call you my girl
[Chorus]
I understand that there's some problems and I'm not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you, even though you might not show
If I can't apologize for being wrong, then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry for the things that he put you through
And all the times you didn't know what to do
I'm sorry that you had to go and sell those bags
Just tryin' to stay busy 'til you heard from Dad
When you would rather be home with all your kids
As one big family with love and bliss
And even though pops treated us like kings
He got a second wife and you didn't agree
He got up and left you there all alone
I'm sorry that you had to do it on your own
I'm sorry that I went and added to your grief
I'm sorry that your son was once a thief
I'm sorry that I grew up way too fast
I wish I would've listened and not be so bad
I'm sorry that your life turned out this way
I'm sorry that the feds came and took me away
[Chorus]
I understand that there are some problems and I'm not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you, even though you might not show
If I can't apologize for being wrong, then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me (Oh yeah)
Said you could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry that it took so long to see
That they were dead wrong tryna put it on me
I'm sorry that it took so long to speak
But I was on tour with Gwen Stefani
I'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt
For the embarrassment that she felt
Just a little young girl tryin' to have fun
Her daddy should've never let her out that young
I'm sorry for Club Zen getting shut down
I hope they manage better next time around
How was I to know she was underage?
In a 21-and-older club they say
Why doesn't anybody wanna take blame?
Verizon backed out, disgracing my name
I'm just a singer tryin' to entertain
Because I love my fans I'll take that blame
[Outro]
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
I'll take that blame from you
And you can put that blame on me (On me)
And you can put that blame on me
You can put that blame on me (Blame's on me)
And you can put that blame on me (Blame's on me)
And you can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me"
Yesterday,The Beatles,['rock'],"[Verse 1]
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

[Chorus]
Why she had to go? I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

[Verse 2]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Chorus]
Why she had to go? I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Sabotage,Beastie Boys,"['rock', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'ma set it straight, this Watergate
I can't stand rockin' when I'm in here
'Cause your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear
So while you sit back and wonder why
I got this fuckin' thorn in my side
Oh my god, it's a mirage
I'm tellin' y'all, it's sabotage

[Verse 2]
So, so, so, so listen up, 'cause you can't say nothin'
You'll shut me down with a push of your button
But, yo, I'm out and I'm gone
I'll tell you now, I keep it on and on

[Verse 3]
'Cause what you see, you might not get
And we can bet, so don't you get souped yet
Scheming on a thing, that's a mirage
I'm trying to tell you now, it's sabotage
[Pre-Chorus]
Whhhhhyyyyyy
(Our backs are now against the wall)

[Chorus]
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage

[Verse 4]
I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'm-a set it straight, this Watergate
But I can't stand rockin' when I'm in this place
Because I feel disgrace because you're all in my face
But make no mistakes and switch up my channel
I'm Buddy Rich when I fly off the handle
What could it be – it's a mirage
You're scheming on a thing, that's sabotage"
I Aint No Joke,Eric B. & Rakim,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
I ain't no joke, I used to let the mic smoke
Now I slam it when I'm done and make sure it's broke
When I'm gone no one gets on 'cause I won't let
Nobody press up and mess up the scene I set
I like to stand in a crowd and watch the people wonder damn
But think about it then you'll understand
I'm just an addict, addicted to music
Maybe it's a habit, I gotta use it
Even if it's jazz or the quiet storm
I hook a beat up, convert it into hip-hop form
Write a rhyme in graffitti in every show you see me in
Deep concentration 'cause I'm no comedian
Jokers are wild if you wanna be tame
I treat you like a child then you're gonna be named
Another enemy, not even a friend of me
'Cause you'll get fried in the end when you pretend to be
Competing 'cause I just put your mind on pause
And I can beat you when you compare my rhyme with yours
I wake you up, and as I stare in your face, you seem stunned
Remember me? The one you got your idea from?
But soon you start to suffer, the tune'll get rougher
When you start to stutter, that's when you had enough of
Biting it'll make you choke, you can't provoke
You can't cope, you should've broke because I ain't no joke
[Verse 2]
I got a question as serious as cancer:
Who can keep the average dancer hyper as a heart attack?
Nobody smiling
'Cause you're expressing the rhyme that I'm styling
This is what we all sit down to write
You can't make it, so you take it home, break it and bite
Use pieces and bits of all my hip-hop hits
Get the style down pat, then it's time to switch
Put my tape on pause and add some more to yours
Then you figure you're ready for the neighborhood tours
The E-M-C-E-E, don't even try to be
When you come up to speak, don't even lie to me
You like to exaggerate, dream, and imaginate
Then change the rhyme around—that can aggravate me
So when you see me come up, freeze
Or you'll be one of those seven emcees
They think that I'm a new jack but only if they knew that
They who think wrong are they who can't do that
Style that I'm doing, they might ruin
Patterns of paragraphs based on you and
Your off-beat DJ, if anything he play sound familiar
I'll wait 'til E say, ""Play 'em""
So I'mma have to diss and broke
You could get a smack for this—I ain't no joke
[Verse 3]
I hold the microphone like a grudge
B'll hold the record so the needle don't budge
I hold a conversation 'cause what I invent
I nominated my DJ for president
When I emcee, I'll keep a freestyle going steadily
So pucker up and whistle my melody
But whatever you do, don't miss one
There'll be another rough rhyme after this one
Before you know it, you're following and fiending
Waiting for the punchline to get the meaning
Like before the moral of my story I'm telling
Nobody beats the R, so stop yelling
Save it, put it in your pocket for later
'Cause I'm moving the crowd, and B'll wreck the fader
No interruptions, and the mic is broke
When I'm gone, then you can joke
'Cause everything is real, on a serious tip
Keep playing and I get furious quick
And I'll take you for a walk through hell
Freeze your dome, then watch your eyeballs swell
Guide you out of triple-stage darkness
When it get dark again, then I'ma spark this microphone
'Cause the heat is on, you see smoke
And I'm finished when the beat is gone— I'm no joke"

Pipes is filled with crack cocaine
And the dope go inside of the veins
From where I came
Though I bear a name only one can live with
Coach, they won't knock me off my pivot, forget it
I'm sicker with it, pick a city, buy a condo
Find a fine ho, let some time go, chill
What you know about a bongo having her mind go
Over a convo about dough? Nothing
Man, the four-wheelers look so good on the sand
Tee or tank top, pocket fan
No pocketknife, no handgun in sight
Just that rat-tat, tat, tat-tat-t-tat-tat, boom
Haha, tonight, I might just boost my feature price
'Cause to each his own, and the lights is bright
And I'm feeling like Mike at a Tyson fight

And he ain't gettin' up after them shots if you hit him in the right spot

Down The Left Hand Path,Cage,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","I was mislead, but once I found the way
I convinced a group of 19 that they should drown today
How I flipped it, clipped it after madness
Then the dead came back and haunted the wrong address
Cause they some stupid dead motherfuckers
Just like all you bitches and Weathermen fluffers
And I get my shoes polished
By the best open mic emcees , paying Timberlands homage
In this day and age if your deck ain't playing Cage
You're probably disgruntled your Mrs. funneled mayonnaise
Or I ain't get the right pub
My whole career been a upstream kayak through blood
My tools love, seeing the face of opponents
Seconds before their skull and wig savor the moment
Light up a J, cast silence over bobbing heads
Stuck underground, shit I might as well rob the dead

Give this to the DJ then trash the clubs
Lick the cover of my CD then see what acid does
Don't just stand there looking like some average thugs
If there's a chick standing next to you then grab her jugs
And if you ain't grabbin' the dough when they ask for love
Then you come back to the crib wearing a mask and gloves
Then you go back to the club stinking of ass and blood
Yoke some kid up, dig his pockets and snatch the drugs
I took a backwards education
Studied some shit with broken navigation
All this anti-Cage demonstratin'
I don't pray to Satan
I prey on agents makin'
Shapeable minds
Capable of firing traceable 9's
But not at any pigs that make their snout's seen
I don't know what I wrote til' I spit and my mouth bleeds
Look, more patterns to market
Not even aimin' I'm staining the walls of Target with shoppers that look at me awkward
Granted I got a cannon and my freakin' mouth's leakin'
Cause my crew put more dust in the air than house keeping
If you sleeping you're getting woke the fuck up
Like you're parents while you bump this and smoke the fuck up
With so much drama in the NYC
I carry 9 millimeter in the back of taxi
While I thought music prevented GOV servants
In the cycle of brain wash entertainment's the detergent

Yoke some kid up, dig his pockets and snatch the drugs
If my thought patterns
Brought palans, to Walt Adams
And spit violence and death, then kids start gatherin'
Bloody ear canal
Hold it down with a towel
Cause by the time the verse hatch your stomach's hangin' out
We got a verse on the loose, let's get these mouth zippers
Buy six drinks a night then wake up and wear 'em as house slippers
I'm just fuckin' with you bitch, don't get offended
This ain't your average anti-pop record with a happy ending
Go ask your block
School body and bastard pops
How the fuck you get your hands on acid drops
Music television repellent for kids with extreme views
Start torchin' labs to light your team's fuse
Forgotten, plottin', rotten student, been truant
I keep my hands in it with no tangible influence
Whether a Clockwork Orange or a murderous night
A book of what my pops did to Tony Burgess's wife

You know, I cut my boss because I don't care

You're gonna get smacked with my gold finger knuckle

Tasmanian Pain Coaster,El-P,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: From the 1992 film ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me""]
Do you think that if you were falling in space
That you would slow down after a while, or go faster and faster?
Faster and faster
For a long time you wouldn't feel anything
Then you would burst into fire, for ever
And the angel's won't help you, cause they've all gone away

(Uno, dos, uno, dos, tres, cuatro)

I saw this kid walking down the street
I was like ""wait"" (echoes)

[Verse 1]
Bumped into this kid I knew, he often would walk strange
So I ignored the blood on his laces so this cat could save face
The dunks and the gaze stayed in an off grey haze
And the lump in his pocket talked to the ox that he clutched safe
So I saluted him there, waiting for the A
Trapped on the empty platform without the option to escape
Gave him the standard: ""Yo, what up man, how you landin'?""
And the hypnotized response was no surprise: ""I maintain""
""Yeah we all do, that's the standardized refrain
But on some really real man, good to see you, really, what the dealy deal?""
Oops, fuck, screwed the pooch, asked too much, knew the truth
On the train now, a caboose
In his brain now, no recluse
80 blocks to uptown spot, destination vocal booth
Metro-card like: ""you get what you pay for, stupid"", no excuse
He pulled his hoody off his cabbage rugged practical
And began to fancy the words I mistakenly jostled loose
The stogie he brazenly lit where he sit looked legit
But when the flame touched to the tip I could smell it's of another nit
He leaned his head back and inhaled the newpie dip and said
""The whole design got my mind cryin', if I'm lyin' I'm dyin'..shit""
[Hook]
This is the sound of what you don't know killing you
This is the sound of what you don't believe still true
This is the sound of what you don't want still in you
TPC motherfucker, cop a feel or two

[Verse 2]
The whole design got my mind cryin', if I'm lyin' I'm dyin'
Dyin', I'm flyin', the same line, no disguise, guy...I'm bent up
Know the sky's high by coincidence and I'm tied blind insignificant
To the ground function I'm Munsoned, it's the dreaded 7/10 split again
The medic made it out to be, epidemic shaded...wow for me
Evidence of pressures mounting, residential shroud: Kings County
Brotherhood of the working wounded, wounded working city unit
Taking out the trash and strappin in, let's get it movin', stupid
Many men make moves more useless, use abuse quick
Losers, juiceless
Bitch, either speak the truth or you leave toothless
Two fists of the furiously ruthless
Justice for my very own amusement with no regard for the conclusion
I swagger with rats tappin' the glass in a Gov. lab
Pass me the gloves, mask and flask of the cheapest liquor you have
In the back of the Tasmanian path, insane again laughin
Cacklin' at the randomness of the city and all its facts
The dark art of interrogation agent skippin' class
And at last in a flash on my tip toes walkin' on cracked glass
Gats blast and wiz by fast or just catch in my calves like ""hold that!""
In other words: I'm trash, glad you asked

This is the sound of what you don't know killing you
This is the sound of what you don't believe still true
This is the sound of what you don't want still in you

Good Morning,Cage,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Cage]
Homeless cardboard cribs, cops shoot civilians
Vendors rap stars wall street billions
Donald Trump shotgun pumps illegal store fronts
Dollar fifty dutches, AF1's and dunks
Skyscrapes planes hit 'em army in the subway
High risk orange alert everyday
My clique is a clip that spits in Glock land
Walk like I'm from the hood, hair like an indie rock band
Throw fits then pitch from hammers blow lungs up
Before Onyx was telling me, was throwin' them guns up
My style was sick and homeless freezing and stuck
'till Def Jux stuffed them G's in the cup
Now It's the season of ""full of shit"", piss in the morning flicker
Lights in your head and earn my explicit warning stickers
NY on the fitted shines from the brain inside
So I don't need a Yankee on for a New York frame of mind

[Hook: El-P]
I'm trained in the dirt, I strain to be heard
The fame of the words alive in my city
Stray from the herd I say what I learned
Painfully burned alive in my city
Aim for the dirt, claimin the earth, danger alert
Alive in my city
Though the same that desert, I remain when they murk
Claim a grain of the worth in my city
[Verse 2: Cage]
Knocked up Jux, they had a monster I'm TV on the street
In the cabbage patch with premies on my feet
I got a New York bop itchy index like a New York cop
Sick in whichever city my tour stops
So by the time I get home, I'll have spread so much enjoyment
I'll create the vaccine, then destroy it
I pull immaculate concepts from thin air
Implemented by the listener to learn until I get there
I'm most alive from one to five in the morning
Thursday's WKCR gave birth to weatherman, then died
Homeland security advisory system won't work
Until the danger rainbow jumps into red alert
Divide quickly, a few can ride with me when martial law hits
Pack up the whip and hide with me
Until the eve of destruction paints the town black
And anarchy ensues you'll have the soundtrack

""Number 247681-Z, step to the line""

[Gunshot]

[Verse 1: Cage]
Two types of people in this world to recognize
Conquered, and the one holding the rifle at the next in line
The crosshair in my eye is a vessel to God
The container that kept you around in a hole in the yard
Sail the cemetery seas, half the crew leaves then move on
You have no idea how right my head is screwed on
When I wake up and put this suit on, I feel escape begin
Expirations are needed, I facilitate the end
[Verse 2: El-P]
There are two types of mornings/mournings in this life I can surmise
I wake early in the first to help supply the second type
Technician of repetition clips in the numbest of traditions it's
The little wondrous blunders that can summon one's demise
I know the line to walk, talk softly, punch a clock, aim (pow) done
I see the shelter in contrition, best to limit wagging tongues
But today's a confrontation with a thought that's not assured
She's inching closer to my services and further from my world

[Hook]
""I found love on a prison ship
I found love on a prison ship

[Verse 3: El-P & Cage]
Does this job ever bother you, darkly creep up in your conscious too?
Nope, in fact I'm so enamored with the standard
Of being handed a command to (pow), it's almost romantic
The lead giveth, I take it, if I didn't understand it
I'm saying during the tenure of your gig, have you ever herded a pris
Who despite the traitorous label, makes you nervous as a kid?
Maybe beyond a date with the lead, there's something else meant for
A prisoner with the beauty of 247290-Z
Oh God, you gotta be joking, I get it she's smoking
Go get a taste, I'll hold you down for thirty, she must be purty, you're open
Your secret's safe with me, go on a raping spree
I gotta couple numbers of my own, just return the courtesy
No, nah man, that's actually not on my mind
Somehow it's different this time, I mean
Should a creature so sublime and young really be in line for the gun
And am I the one to dispense it? She seems almost defenseless
And her eyes have the surprising effect of rendering me restless
[El-P]
You know, you look really pretty without handcuffs on
Without the dirt on your face...

[Verse 4: El-P]
Like the piss and stench of the huddled traitors evaporates from the room
And in that moment I can see her truly, and she can see me too
Beneath the body armor and weaponry, my heart quietly thumps and whispers
""Drop the guns and grab her, now's the time to make your run""
Sitting in my transport as we slip through traffic veins
She doesn't ask me where we're going, only holds my hand and gaze
She's my only reason now, and my only hope to live
We pull up to the cabin way above this damn metropolis
Me and prisoner 247290-Z
Somewhere that is Soylent Green, we're living life instead
No more war on traitorism, only me and her
She can clean my gun and I could help her clean the floor
Back to something natural, we'll live off of the land
When Radon levels drop we walk the trails and talk and laugh
I tell her she's innocent, and she'll show me she's not
I kiss the number on her arm and lay her on the cot
I'm the first to touch her without gloves on
She's the first to kiss me without crying
Life before this was just dying
Me and prisoner 247290-Z
Away from all this violence, live inside each other's heads
Away from all this violence, live inside each other's heads
Away from all this violence, live inside each other's heads
Away from all this violence, live inside each other's heads

Jabberwocky,Lewis Carroll,[],"'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

""Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!""

He took his vorpal sword in hand:
Long time the manxome foe he sought--
So rested he by the Tumtum tree
And stood awhile in thought.

And as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood
And burbled as it came!

One, two! One, two! And through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back.
""And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!""
He chortled in his joy.

'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe."

And you never will, bitch-ass niggas
Weezy F. Baby, believe that
Haha, yeah

I got them 24-inches, sitting on them Joe Buddens
And the trunk straight jumping, bitch, I can't hear nothing
Or I might do the Spurs, sitting on them Tim Duncans
And in that Lamborghini, I do donuts like Dunkins
How come every bad bitch with a pussy wanna fuck him?
But I just feed 'em drugs and just watch 'em fuck each other
My neck was a hundred, and my wrist was another
It make her pussy wet, I leave that bitch with a puddle
I'm a beast, I'm a dog, I should rap with a muzzle
Peyton Manning flow: I just go, no huddle
Baby girl getting straight dick, no cuddle
You know I'm out this world, I just bought a space shuttle—
I'ma put some D's on that bitch
And these hoes starting to get like fleas on my shit
Have you seen her? Who? Nina, she's on my hip
Yellow-white diamonds, call it ""cheese on them grits""
You niggas ain't balling
Real talk, you niggas can't guard me
Two niggas can't guard me, you looking at Jordan
From the side, like Spike at the Garden
I got the hardest bars, call me the warden
Yeah, excuse me, pardon
I break a bitch down like Tonya Harding
Bitch, I'm col', not dude off Martin
Pockets just fat like the Klumps and Norbit
Bitch, I'm fly like a magic carpet
And bitch, I'm fresh like a pack of Orbit
See, I'ma take it and go bring it back to New Orleans
And bitch, I'ma shine in the land of darkness
In which I'ma grind 'til my stacks is tall as a wall is
And I'm high, don't wan' know how deep the fall is
No, I can't come down
And every time I send my girl out of town—
I put some keys on that bitch
I'm a certified gangsta
Haters make me nauseous, the money make me anxious
Listen how my words are poetic like Langston
Dreads down my back like I come straight from Kingston
But I come from Hollygrove, seventeen, danger zone
So many C-notes, I can sing a song
T-top coupe, looking like a thong
Your girl love my dick, she treats it like a bong
I don't wan' be right if gettin' high is wrong
My eyes so low, I look like I'm from Hong Kong
Boy, I got more green than the Bishop Don Juan
OK, I'm not a rookie, I'm a pro... -methazine fiend
Make the homies say, ""Ho!"" and make all the girlies scream
I am a vegetarian, man, I only eat beats
Wear a lot of carats, and I smoke the best greens
No beef in my grocery bag
Just some Swishers and a whole bunch of cans of whoop-ass, ha
I'm strapped, like a bookbag
So anyone of y'all can come on and get a foot tag
D.O.A., ride all night
Sleep, no way—sleep when I lay
Six feet deep, and until that day
I'ma be living like it is that day
Yeah, I keep holding on
I said, ""Bitch, I been hot; bitch, the stove been on""
If you don't like it, I roll over and roll along
Fuck you and the horse that you rode in on
Yeah, some cool shorts and my Kobes on
Looking slicker than the lane that you bowling on

Yo I got an idea
Let me go grab Sticky right quick
Hey yo Stick, Stick
Yo, Slim Shady
Yo, I just had like a nightma...
Wait, it wasn't like a nightmare
It was like a good drea...
Well, it wasn't a good...
What was it?
Hey, yo, I just had a crazy dream man
What?
Yo, yo I dreamt I was white!
Oh shit!

[Chorus: Eminem]
What if he was white? What if he was white?
What if he was white? What, if, he, white?
What if he was white? What if he was
White, white, white, white, white
White, white, white, white, white?
[Verse 1: Sticky Fingaz, (Eminem)]
What if I was white skinned, the same color as cocaine?
Blond hair, blue eyes, the whole shibang
I know one thing: police wouldn't always be watching me
Pull me over for nothing, constantly jocking me
(Can I get your autograph?)
The yellow cabs in the city would stop for me
I wouldn't need collateral to buy property
If I was white, wouldn't matter if I was rich or poor
Security wouldn't follow me around the store
(Maybe he might have stole something)
Like I'd steal something, because I'm black I rob
And automatically assume I ain't got no job
On my own land, I feel like an immigrant
If I was white, I wouldn't have thought OJ was innocent
(He did it) If I was white...

What if he was white? What if he was white?
What if he was white? What, if, he, white?

What if he was white? What, if, he, white?
What if he was white? What if he was
White, white, white, white, white
White, white, white, white, white?
[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz, Eminem]
If I was white, it'd be a different world for me
If I was white, hm? What shade would I be?
Would I be Redneck or Skinhead, preppy or high class?
You'd probably live in a trailer park and be white trash!
In any case, that be the ill shit right?
But there's a good and bad side of being white
You can't say the N-word without starting a fight (What's up, my nig​ger?)
Couldn't dance to a beat, I'd have two left feet
Even if I was white, probably still have a ghetto shit (How you doing?)
Is it a myth or do I really have a little dick? (Nah, it's true!)
If I was white, I would probably listen to hard rock
And cover my ears whenever I heard Hip Hop

[Chorus: Eminem]
What if he was white? What if he was white?
What if he was white? What, if, he, white?
What if he was white? What if he was
White, white, white, white, white

I'd watch Tennis and Golf and bet on Hockey games (Red Wings, man)
Wear suit and ties and go to work everyday
If I was white I couldn't live around my way
And there probably would of never even been an Onyx, shit
I be somewhere sipping Vodka and Tonix
Smoking on a Marlboro instead of a Newport
I'd live in Long Island instead of New York
If I was white, I probably couldn't dunk
'Cause everybody knows White Man Can't Jump (Nope!)
And probably wouldn't be able to go to the weed spot
'Cause all of the dreads would think I'm a cop

[Chorus: Eminem]
What if he was white? What if he was white?
What if he was white? What, if, he, white?
What if he was white? What if he was
White, white, white, white, white
White, white, white, white, white?
What if he was white? What if he was white?
What if he was white? What, if, he, white?
What if he was white? What if he was
White, white, white, white, white
White, white, white, white, white?

[Outro: Eminem]
Yo, what if I was white?"

Yeah, G'd up from the feet up (I got you Trae)
Ya dig, A-B-C-D-E-F
I'm a G to the end, the end of the road
But back in the kitchen, at the end of the stove
Hey, T, looks like we at the end of the O
Drop a for in a twenty ounce, and call it 24
You sit on 24's, and we sip on 24's
Got the Caddy, sitting on a pair of Gucci penny loafs
Yeah I get money, fuck with bitches that get me more
Now you know the game, same shit different hoes
Yeah we cut the ears and the tail, off Mickey Mouse
Never been a rat, never had 'em in the house
Call me Captain Kangaroo, I got money in my pouch
And I don't mean loose change, when I say money in the couch
Ya dig yeah, I'm getting paid at what I already say
Can't see these niggas, like debris on these niggas
Got a bitch named Nina, and Nina so slutty
Cause she'll do him, and every one of his buddies
[Hook: Lil' Wayne & Trae]
We put them drinks down, and pick them tools up
And if dude tripping, we hit dude up
And you ain't shit, if you ain't never been screwed up
And you ain't shit, if you ain't never been screwed up
We drop the top down, and chunk the deuce up
These 84's'll make a hater, put his shoes up
Yeah you ain't shit, if you ain't never been screwed up
Yeah you ain't shit, if you ain't never been screwed up

[Verse 2: Trae]
I'm in the drop sitting low, 84's looking dangerous
My swagger got me in the hood, looking like I was famous
My neck and wrist, look like it been hit by a couple painters
I'm getting money, but the fact I'm gangster never changes
I got my locs on, waiting on a time to plex
Like this bopper shotgun in the whip, waiting on time to sex
It's A.B.N. until I rest, and won't be nothing less
Since I'm protected by the neighborhood, I never need a vest
I know them haters talking, but they ain't saying nothing
Long as they stay inside they place, I'mma continue stunting
My ice the shit, I'm prolly at a hundred stacks and running
I guess I'm fly, cause my do's in the air and trunk is humming
I'm still moving slow, my swagger just got off the chain
Whether the club or in the hood, I'm still gon make it rain
Yeah I'm the Truth, so please address it when you say my name
You try to take it to me, I'mma try to take it to your brain
[Hook]

[Verse 3:Trae]
It's still the same name, new whip new shoes
Fifty on the frame, so I know I won't lose
Kit is on fly, do's up when I cruise
All eyes on me, everytime a nigga move
I pop another trunk, and show the world I'm screwed up
This hey different color chain, will make you put your jewels up
Say bitch you better chill, cause I'll beat your dude up
Put him on the sideline, and have his face bruised up all screwed up
Oh yeah these diamonds in my mouth, showing I rep the South
This 80 thousand dollar bitch, got the top tooken off
Up in these streets I'm like a kid, cause I love to get lost
And stay packing something, that love to break a hater off
So when it come to this gangster, homie I got it locked
And if I put that drop on the block, I'm unable to stop
And when it come to what it do, I'm that number one spot
They knew I represent for Screw and H.A.W.K., banging my music chopped

That's a way to get ya ass sent Upstate (dayyyum)
In 98' I took them trips down to Lauderdale
Back and forth, like Aaliyah
Chances of gettin' rich is like one-in-a-million

Flashin' lights, my mind's playin' tricks on me
But the mini van still do tricks homie

A nigga paranoid, I still sleep the same
You niggas rappin' 'bout blow, like it's a fad
Nigga this is my life, I ain't tryna set trends
Cause everybody knows how that brick-road ends
Heartless, maybe I need to see the Wizard
Until then, I'mma make it snow blizzards

Day in and day out until a nigga sold out
You niggas playin', I show you what that street shit 'bout
Hit you right up with them thangs, and come back with the chains
Might cook it in the stove, might cook it in the microwave
Either way it's gonna sell, still weigh it on the scale
You rappin'-ass niggas ain't never sold no yams

Light skinned with the chromed out six, y'all
Thought they was creepin', took trips to V-A every third weekend
While you was sleepin', he hit you on the box
Sixty-nine code non-stop
Shoulda left ya then, but my heart said not
You knew too much, the relationship grew too much
You knew about the crack vials, means to be trial
Where I hid dough under the bathroom tile
Waited for a while, thought you was my right thing
Then things got frightenin'
Peep the scene, sorta like Sam Rothstein
Guess you Ginger, huh, go figure
Never thought you could be a gold-digger
Take my dough and spend with the next nigga
Asked my man Jigga, my ace boon coon
Told me cut the bitch off 'fore the shit balloon

Or the O'Jays, thinkin' 'bout the old days
My nigga's like, fuck that bitch, go play

Scale them fishes, my love is concrete
Stashin' your heat in the passenger seat of the Nautica Jeep

Still a bitch like me tryin' to hold on
Teary eyed, damn a bitch steamin'
Girls steady screamin', ""Kim you need to leave him!""

Couldn't think straight thinkin' 'bout the bitches I fought
Over you, nigga have the shit you bought
And fuck you, movin' is my last resort

You're mad at me, too bad she ain't as bad as me
Shoulda kept the freak bitch off my canapé

When I walk up in the spot, ain't nobody saw you
They see me like “there he go”
Look at you like ” ahh who?”
Bought every bottle at the bar
Shortie you know how I do
I take them all across your noggin', I ain't finna argue
Still big shit popping, nothing changed but my clothes
Triple digits in my pocket, rubber band bank roll
Tell the bitch I take you places where your man can’t go
Can’t be, he ain't doing shit, if he ain't me
Can't you see the difference between us when I walking to the door
Your twenty thousand worth of ones, start letting money go
Let it fly, throw some twenty when my one running low
50 stack, I’m a show you how to ball: triple that"
Intro,Lil Wayne,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Rasta dem king of the jungle
Dread lock swing down me back like Repunzel
My bred'dren sling dem pack an' dem bundle
We'll take your tings, sell it back to your uncle
And we'll make it rain till your dances will come true
We'll make it rain so you betta bring a swimsuit
Alone when I came, but I'm leavin with them two
Gals give me brain, give me brain like temples
And him got the game, game sharp like a pencil
And if you want formage we can crash like a symbol
And Let prepare me window, on my new sports coupe
Twelve hoarses in the hood, sittin on hoarse shoes
Come from the land that Jesus walked through
Sacrifice me life, man I bleed for me uncle
Them no want to run, run with me them no want to
Murder them, and the family them belong to
Next ting them kno I run a street like a car door
You go after me, me I dearly depart you
Hip hop is mine now, Mine what you gone do?
I can jump on any nigga song and make a part two
Playtime for me, cuz see to me, they are cartoons
How come every joint be on point like a harpoon?
How come evry bar stand strong like a barstool?
How come every line is so raw you gone snort too?
Murder them. Man I murda them. Fuck a competition, man I murda them
Man murda them. Man I murda them. Fuck a competition, man I murda them

Sitting on a truffet, puffing on the best cut buds
Trying to get butt from Miss Muffet
Me and Teddy Ruxpin sturring up a ruckus
Egging all the houses, smashing all the pumpkins
Suck a Dick Butkus, chumps can't funk with the punk kids
Ash Roth be the king of the blumpkins
Any Tim Duncan, spur of the moment
Let the whole world know I run shit, jump ship quick
Tell a friend that I'm dumb sick
Spit fungus that'll grow from a dung, trip
Twist to a front flip, son that was some trick
Watch all the dumb chicks hump when I bump this

[Verse 2]
Kinda like the blonde Bob Saget, Ash can get nasty
Pass me a blunt and some Captain
Chilling with an Ashley, heading to the mall
Sitting in the backseat, getting jerked off
Ten feet tall with the balls of a matador
Door-matted whore with your words, heard that before
Poor metaphor, pedicure, get your feet fixed
Walk in my shoes for a few, you gonna need it
Yeah, get your Wii Fit to practice your frees with
Need a few weeks before you can compete with
Razor Ramon flow, oh so sharp
You can take Kapowski, I'mma take Lark on my go-kart
[Verse 3]
Mario Kart skills are outrageous
Play me anyday and I'll be the best racist
Wait, no, erase it, meant to say racer
Traded in my cell phone for a new pager
Take off your Bluetooth now dot com
I'm at the grocery store with hot moms
About thirty five with at least two kids
We can make-out while my friend baby sits
All up in your fridge eating left-over shit
Tuna sandwich, Butterscotch Krimpets
Cheetos be my choice of chip
I enjoy for a bit, take a sip from my Ssips and split

Roll that J up, is it rolled?
Yeah, roll it up, uhh

Hair like a troll doll, basketball shorts on
Yeah, I'm a dork but I'm still holding court
Ball up, baller, y'all take too long to get dolled up
Give a fuck if I look like I just woke up
Who am I trying to impress? Honey in the sun dress
With the breasts luscious just sent me a text

We were willing to die for an ideal and we would die for it again
But we prefer living for it, working for it, safeguarding it

A.O.T.P., we above the law
See the cops start running nigga call the dogs
They can't see me, I throw that Molotov
And clear the whole field out, nigga call the gods

[Verse 1: Demoz]
I don't give a fuck about you
I swing my blade and take a chunk up out you
Chase the driver that's trying to save you
And lace 'em with the scalpel
Break your Adam's-- apple and clap you and leave you mangled
I'm not the asshole claiming Philly, I'm blowing up the fucking castle
Fuck pity and mercy I'm thirsty for the title
Kill your vitals with verses, curses
And hearses move 'em like Vinny Idol
Take Vinnie and Planet, mould 'em inside a bowling ball
Launch em against the way you claim you carry
Break your shoulders off
Just for showing off you're stupid
I don't threaten niggas, I really do this
Squeeze the juice out of you like embalming fluid
Burn his lid, barbecue 'em and fuckin' burn his ribs
Throw the dress away with the evidence
Burn a fucking wig
[Verse 2: Celph Titled]
I got plans for your murder and I'm ready to discuss em
You're ready to die? Tell God I said, ""Fuck him.""
Call me Iron Fist motherfucker I aim hard
Bullets are free throw, silencer is the point guard
Said you was a crook but you ain't busting no lead homes
Only jack you pulling is connected to some headphones
The sound of the clap louder than several operas
My sitcom screaming ""I'm gonna kill you"" across the Teleprompter
Yes I'm sick fuck the Zicam and Zyrtec
How you gonna fight man when y'all resemble Smurfette?
Stretch your neck till your head meets your ass
I'll beat your dad dead now he's a deadbeat dad

[Verse 3: Planetary]
Nothing is ever promised, especially your life I demolish
Too many niggas claim street but wouldn't last in the projects
Too many happy-go-lucky cats rap with no money
Black why you gotta act? I be screaming where the money at?
I never understood your hood mentality
Man you still selling weed on the block dog, that's blasphemy
That's embarrassing, you nickel and dimin'
A small cut off a bundle and you thinking you shinin'
I could rumble in the jungle and tussle with all the lions
My hustle could turn to rustle but for now I'm survivin'
Living
My kids are chillin' and I'm whippin' the new boy
It ain't a Maybach but it's better than your toy

From eating motherfuckers on the street up to bloody tears
Camouflage backpacks, Tims and some money wares

You're fucking with something deadly and Vinnie Satan laughs

You faggot mixtape rappers I should snap your throat
Bunch of tracks cracking jokes 'bout crack and coke (release the Krakken)
Ap is the crackers last hope
Honkey Kong fuckin' bitches leaving mattresses broke
If the condom break I'mma tell the bitch to abort
I'm like the sniper on the roof looking out for the stork
Little dogs getting shanked for a box of Newports
There ain't a jail that could hold me cause Ap teleports
Skipping court on the porch with the criminal sorts
You was usin' couch cushions buildin' living room forts
Your mom's pouring yayo on my dick to snort
I only rock a halo to hide horns and pitchforks

Fuck U Man,Kool G. Rap & DJ Polo,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse]
Since I made the record ""Talk Like Sex,""
Bitches are comin' up with their friends for a nigga to hit the skins
Hopin' that Kool G Rap was just makin' rhymes
But I'm leavin' bitches' vaginas with more stitches than Frankenstein
Some even had the nerve to try to give me head
And swallow the whole jimmy to make a nigga fed
But come on you bitches, don't make me laugh;
You couldn't deep throat G Rap if you was a motherfuckin' giraffe
Dag, some even fled when they saw the head
Cuz G's dick would make you seasick fuckin' me in a waterbed
Don't try to play me like no sucker
Cuz these bitches'll be callin' up Dial-a-Mattress like a motherfucker
You heard the song before; you don't wanna see me
""I'll fuck you on the A-train while I write graffiti.""
I'll even fuck you in a taxi cab
And after sex with a nigga you'll be buyin' a box of maxi-pads
Soon as you open your legs
No need for no birth control, bitch, cuz my dick is touchin' the eggs
Kool G Rap, the pussy slammer
Hell, I'd be talkin' fucked up grammar if you was Bad Mamma Jamma
I ain't small, I'll have you cummin' like waterfalls
And then turn them sugar walls into Carnegie Hall
Leavin' my mark on hookers like Zorro
Plus fuckin' bitches so def like there won't be no pussy left tomorrow
Hittin' hoes like it ain't funny
I think about bowls of Cheerios because I want my nuts and honey
Talkin' to all the women that look fine
Pretendin' my prick was Moby Dick and have a whale of a time
Now I'm not a deep-sea diver
But I love it when my dick's covered and smothered with saliva
Shit, might even straighten out your dentures
Because it's not just a blow job, honey, it's an adventure
But 69in', I ain't with that:
I'll go to a Chinese restaurant, bitch, if I wanna eat cats
Because you gotta be brave to eat the tuna, G
So when it comes to pussy-lickin', I'm the chicken of the sea
I should be on the sex channel;
Not a chump cuz I'm givin' punk-bitches better humps than camels
If you're a virgin, I'll make it fit
Because my dick'll pop the cherry and spit out the fuckin' pit
And if you're concerned, my sperm don't burn
And if it did, I'd give that nappy-headed ass a fuckin' perm
Shucks, I instruct a fuckin' lesson
You think it's painless? I hit the anus and fuck up your large intestines
Leavin' you bitches stingin' from the bangin'
My man Jimmy got a hole in his head, but yo, that nigga's still hangin'
Bitch, you'd rather hump a fuckin' whole army
Cuz even the Witness Protection Program couldn't hide this man's salami
You fuck around and catch a seizure
Before I fuck a ho I gots ta put the hooker under anesthesia
Lettin' saliva dribble on your nipple
Orgasms double and triple sit ripple and turn your ass into a gripple
Then I see you searchin' for the swellin'
Cuz I'm-a leave a hole so big your gynecologist might fall the hell in
Got damn! I hit the ham right
Honeybuns, you can ask my Three Sons, I got the Dick right out the Van Dyke
I'm fuckin' naked girls with fly rhymes
But don't push me, because that pussy will be runnin' for it's nine lives
I know you hookers can't refuse this
But don't pick me to give no hickeys cuz I'm givin' bitches bruises
Yeah, I'll tear that pussy hole apart
For fuckin' with G Rap after dark, you'd rather jog in Central Park
So if you want kids before I fuck ya
Look at the size of my dick, and you'll adopt the motherfuckers
Shit, bitches get open like a can;
Just leave it up to G Rap, cuz I'm the neighborhood Fuck U Man"

Two-hundred-thousand dollar whips and chains
Crooked cops, Crips, crack cocaine
2Pac, Chris, I'm still feelin' the pain
Seven-year-old girl, shot and slain? What does it all mean?
We go insane in the struggle
The stress make him add panic
We're I'm from, we do not eat organic (Talk about it)
You see, my mama can not afford Whole Foods
She break fast for the bread, call it soul food
Where I come from — let it breathe
Where I come from, no one runs when funds run low in lump sums
We chose to dump dumb dumb bullets (Dun, dun)
We livin' hum-drum in the slums where scum conceal stun guns
The word's mum for fun, son, conundrums ain't pretty
In this cesspool called New York Shitty
I call it that 'cause it smell like shit
Walk around hunchbacked or you might get hit (Talk about it)

He said, ""Pharoahe, let's get this money up""
What the fuck? What, you need me to holla at Steve Rifkin?
Hit him, escape from New York like Snake Plissken
I told you from the gate that you needed more marketing
And these major labels are not listenin'
Stood in a b-boy stance, teeth glistenin'
From the gold in his mouth, the summer breeze was whistlin'
I contemplated my retort, eyes fixed in
On a crucifix around his neck, I guess he was Christian
Just then, the police siren had pitched in
To the soundtrack of the hood, so I spoke with conviction
Spoke as if I was 6'10"" with thick skin
Put a little bass in my voice like pitch bend
'Cause where I come from
Where I come from, we all come from
Sky, moon, the stars, the earth and sun
Multiple skin tones, your blood is one
The pen is the ammo to my automatic gun
Bring to fruition what I write to get me out of the slums
And I'ma shine, sh-sh-shine, shine, shine
Shine like the sun, the world is mine
Each line of speech designed to transcend time
And reach the unborn to transform your mind
And I'ma shine, shine

You Never Know,Immortal Technique,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
She was on her way to becomin' a college graduate
Wouldn't even stop to talk to the average kid
The type of Latina I'd sit and contemplate marriage with
Fuck the horse and carriage shit, her love was never for hire
Disciplined, intellectual beauty is what I desire
Flyer than Salma Hayek or Jennifer Lopez
Everyone told me, kickin' it to her was hopeless
At first I just thought she didn't mess with broke kids
The thug niggas always talkin' about how they smoke kids
But the rich sniff-coke kids got no play
""I'm not even interested"" is what her body language would say
Everyone around the way gave up tryin' to get in it
It didn't matter how good your game was, she wasn't with it
On the block, bitches was jealous but wouldn't admit it
Talk shit, and deny to everyone that they did it
Cause they regretted the long list of niggas that they let hit it
And no one ever gave them shit except McDonald's and did-dick
Smokin' weed, with thoughts of envy whenever they lit it
She spoke intelligently and they bit it, always tryin' to copy
But when they tried to use her vocab they sounded sloppy
She had a style, all her own, respectful and pure
I was sick in the head for her, and there wasn't a cure
[Hook: Jean Grae]
Don't you know that time waits for no man?
My fate, it's all planned
I'm blessed just to know you
I've loved and I've lost just to hold you all night
Can't find a reason why
God came between you and I
And if I had the chance again, I'd never let you go
Hold tight to your love, ‘cause you never know

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
Her eyes are brown and beautiful, yet empty and sad
I used to talk to her occasionally, and she was glad
That I wasn't just another nigga tryin' to get in it
So every now and then we'd stop and talk for a minute
I didn't have a gimmick, so the minutes turned to hours
On her birthday I gave her a poem with flowers
Then I took her out to dinner after her cousin's baby shower
We talked about power to the people and such
We spent more time together, but it was never enough
I never tried to sneak a touch or even cop a feel
I was too interested in keepin' it real
Perfectly honest and complete
She would always call me ""cariño"" and never Technique
Bought me a new book to read every two or three weeks
Forever changin' the expression of my thoughts when I speak
It was because of her I even deaded all of my freaks
She convinced me to stop hangin' out on the streets
To stop robbin' and stealin' from people like you
Instead I took her out to the Apollo and the Bronx Zoo
Museo del Barrio, and the Metropolitan too
Got to the point when I was either with her or my crew
So I decided one day to tell her my feelings was true
I couldn't live without her, so I told her, facin' my fears
But honey's only response was a face full of tears
She could only sob hysterically, holdin' me tight
I tried to speak, but she wouldn't stop until I left sight
I felt like a moth who got himself too close to the light
Except I didn't burn, I turned cold after that night
[Hook: Jean Grae]
Don't you know that time waits for no man?
My fate, it's all planned
I'm blessed just to know you
I've loved and I've lost just to hold you all night

And if I had the chance again, I'd never let you go
Hold tight to your love, ‘cause you never know

[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]
I went on with my life, college and my career
Ended up locked up like an animal for a year
Where the C.O.'s talk to you like they were the overseer
Then I got sent to the hole when my exit was near
At night in my cell, I'd close my eyes and I'd see her
Hold her close in my dreams, but when I woke she disappeared
Just an empty cell until the state gave me parole
In the summer, came back, intact and on track
But the fact of the matter is I still felt cold
Even after my mother hugged me, cryin' at home
My real niggas would catch me thinkin', outta my zone
Fuckin' lots of different women, but I still felt alone
Relatively well-known around the New York underground
But I kept thinkin' of her and how we used to be down
The sound of her voice, and the beautiful smell of her hair
Though gone physically, somehow it was still there
I had to do somethin' because the shit was too much to bear
So I went and visited the building where she used to live
The world looks a lot different after you do a bid
The way your life done changed
While primitive minds are still stuck in the same game
Like her cousin who was on the corner, slangin' cocaine
Stepped in the lobby, and tapped the button next to her last name
Her mom buzzed me up and hugged me up like a mother oughta
But her facial expression changed
When I asked about her daughter
[Hook: Jean Grae]
Don't you know that time waits for no man?
My fate, it's all planned

And if I had the chance again, I'd never let you go
Hold tight to your love, ‘cause you never know

[Verse 4: Immortal Technique]
She told me that there was a note, for me, that was left behind
And she had left it there waitin' for such a long time
I was inclined to ask about it, but she brought it up first
I saw a tear swellin' up in her eye, and then she cursed
She told me where the letter was, and I started thinkin' the worst
Reversed my position, stepped over and opened the door
And sure enough there was an envelope
With my name on the floor: ""Nobody loves you more than me, cariño,"" is what the letter said
""By the time you get to read this, I'll probably be dead
But when you left in '97, a part of me went to Heaven
I thank God at least I got to know what love really was
But it hurt me to see what true love really does
‘Cause even though we never made love
You were all that there was
It was because I loved you so much that I had to make you leave
You made me doubt the way I thought
You made me want to believe
And then I slipped up, and I let you get close to me
It was hard to not be openly when people spoke to me
This was not the way I thought my life was supposed to be
Baby, don't you see?
I had a blood transfusion that left me with HIV
Hope didn't exist for me since late in 1993
I died a virgin, I wish I could've given myself to you
I cried in the hospital because there was no one else but you
Promise that you'll meet me in Paradise inevitably
No matter what, I'll keep your love forever with me.""
What happened for the rest of the day is still a blur
But I remember wishin' that I was dead, instead of her
She was buried on August 3rd
The story ends without a sequel; and now you know why Technique don't fuckin' fall in love with people
Hold the person that you love closely if they're next to you
The one you love, not the person that'll simply have sex with you
Appreciate them to the fullest extent and then beyond
‘Cause you never really know what you got until it's gone"
Book of Kings 2:2,Solomon Ray,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","1 And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal

2 And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said unto him, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel

3 And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace

4 And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho

5 And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace

6 And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on

7 And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan

8 And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground

9 And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me

10 And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so

11 And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven

12 And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces

13 He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;
14 And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over

15 And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him

16 And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send

17 And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not

18 And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?

19 And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, and the ground barren

20 And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him

21 And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land

22 So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake

23 And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head

24 And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them

25 And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria"
And Did Those Feet In Ancient Time,William Blake,[],"And did those feet in ancient time
Walk upon England's mountains green?
And was the holy Lamb of God
On England's pleasant pastures seen?

And did the Countenance Divine
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?
And was Jerusalem builded here
Among these dark satanic mills?

Bring me my bow of burning gold!
Bring me my arrows of desire!
Bring me my spear! O clouds, unfold!
Bring me my chariot of fire!

I will not cease from mental fight,
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand
Till we have built Jerusalem
In England's green and pleasant land."
Monkey Suite,Madvillain,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse: MF Doom]
Villain'll hold a mic like he's mean and his tummy hurt
In a clean pair of ripped jeans and a bummy shirt
Wonderin' would you clap your hands if he was friendly?
Dapper Dan dipped and pretend to be Fendi and gold sellin'
No tellin', slap a fan hand down, tell 'em ""no yellin'""
DOOM, all capitals, no trick spellin'
Got what it take to get it through your thick melon
(Woopwoosh) Fresh witty city skits
When he get wreck, pretty emcees catch titty fits
Told them call the cops, just don't hold your breath for the ball to drop
Better yet, hold on to your halter top
Kept reppin', steppin' in hotta
Ignoring pigs like Biggs Top Shotta
Survivor of a live crew, not out to jive you
It stings when he laugh when he at the bank drive-thru
Wylin', get me every red penny
Sold a lonely only child an imaginary enemy
When he sees the mask and the microphone gizmo
He's the broke host, this is like his own quiz show
This go out to all my brothers doin' long bids
And sisters who got brothers bein' fathers to the wrong kids
Stay strong and ride like the funky flute
Won't find the Villain in the street inside no monkey suit
Or either at the bar in no gorilly bra
Nor raceway park scoring on no silly car
Ask the stranger he knows who you really are
Behind the mask face stay dark, no boring willy star
Gleaming, dreaming, screaming- he'll be off the heezy soon
Cunning live rats drive at your steaming greasy spoon
In participating places tip your waitresses
A sure-fire way to wire, trip the matrices
Skip ya laces, all black tennis miniature
Ball stack, gall tall pack, Guinness minister
Tussle the hustle, cut your dank with dirt
Won't be in the club in no muscle tank shirt
You could find him in the pub with a grub stain
Chuggin' on a small tub of pain to his bugged brain
Sane, some say he plum crazy
Amazed at how he still get paid but dumb lazy
That's for him to know and for you to guess
Won't be caught in a suit vest at no computer desk
A suede front, maybe may stunt khaki dig
Not in no braids or no lace-front yaki wig"

Comin' backstage, dyin' to get pleased
You got me, I rock thee, Versace and linen
While you stop your grinnin' wit' bunch of foxy women
Why you speed ball with cards, that's invalid
I get clothes, custom made, from a stylist
Cruise in my Lexus Land with no mileage
While you walk the street until your feet get calloused
Take you on a natural high, like a pilot
It be all good, toss your clothes like a salad
When it's all over, put your vote in my ballot
It's my diner, I'm Mel, and you're Alice
Spend a night, in Lil' Cease palace
It be all good as long as you don't act childish
While you standin' there with the Crist' in your cup
If worse come to worse keep this on the hush, uhh

And I'll be doin' things that you won't regret
Lil Kim, the Queen Bee, so you best take heed
Shall I proceed? (Yes indeed!)
I'ma throw shade if I can't get paid
Blow you up to your girl like the Army grenade
You can slide on my ice like the Escapade
And itchy-gitchy-yaya with the marmalade

CD's with crazy bass, keep my lady laced
Don't be fooled by the baby face
I hope ya not, 'cause your thighs got me hot
Only one plan, that's to rise to the top
I told you before, when I first pursued
I want a interlude, in the nude

[Verse 4: Lil' Kim]
You know I love the way you feel-a, sip my tequil-a
Works from the dealers, full-length chinchilla
Heat up the clutch, seven-fifty deluxe
Then we speed down the hutch, breakin' trees in the dutch

Want a cheap trick, better go down to FreakNik
You got to hit me off, buy this girl gifts of course

This type of shit, it happens every day (Check it out, uh)

Now who smoke more blunts than a little bit?
What are you a idiot? Listen to the lyrics I spit like M1's
Got mad guns up in the cabin
'Cause Cease ain't the one for the dibbin' and dabbin' shit
I make it happen, you got your ass caught
All you saw was fire from the Honda Passport
Or the M.P., what if you see, then I miss ya
I blow up spots like little sisters
Gwaan grit ya teeth, gwaan bite ya nails to the cuticles
Like Murray, my killings be the most beautiful

Niggas grab your gats, bitches take a glance at
The little one, pullin' over in the Land Rover

Stack the green, read all between the lines

How ya livin' Biggie Smalls? I'm surrounded by criminals
Heavy rollers, even the sheisty individuals
Smokin' skunk and mad Phillies
Beatin' down Billy Badasses, cracks and stacks in masses
If robbery's a class, bet I pass it
Shit get drastic, I'm buryin' you bastards
Big Poppa never softenin'
Take you to the church, rob the preacher for the offerin'
Leave the fucker coughin' up blood and his pockets like rabbit ears
Covet the wife, Kleenex for the kid's tears
Versace wear, Moschino on my bitches
She whippin' my ride, countin' my ones, thinkin' I'm richest
Just the way players play, all day, every day
I don't know what else to say
I've been robbin' niggas since Run and them was singin' ""Here We Go""
Snatchin' ropes at the Roxy, homeboy, you didn't know?
My flow, detrimental to your health
Usually roll for self, I have son ridin' shotgun
My mind's my nine, my pen's my MAC-10
My target, all you wack niggas who started rappin'
Junior M.A.F.I.A. steelo, niggas know the half
Caviar for breakfast, champagne bubble baths
Runnin' up in pretty bitches constantly
The Smalls, bitch, who the fuck it was supposed to be?

I used to pack MACs in Cadillacs
Now I pimp gats in the Ac's, watch my niggas backs
Nines in the stores, Glocks in the bags
Maxin' mini-markets, gettin' money with the Arabs
No question, confession, yes it's the lyrical
Bitches, squeeze your tits, niggas, grab your genitals
Proteins and minerals, exclude subliminals
Big Momma shoots the game to all you Willies and criminals
I kick the really with my peeps all day
325's roll by with the windows down halfway
D-K-N-Y, oh my, I'm jiggy
It's all about the Smalls and my fuckin' nigga Biggie
Bitches love the way I bust a rhyme
'Cause they all in line screamin', ""One more time!""
Niggas, grab your dicks if you love hip-hop
Bitches rub-a-dub in the back of the club, straight up"
Clint Eastwood Phi Life Cypher Version,Gorillaz,"['rock', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","[Si Phili]
""Yo. Yo. Yo.""
Cause I'm this, Gorillaz from the mist lyricist and my thoughts be twisted
I spit the wickedest rhymes from a time that's never existed
My futuristic linguistics turn fools into statistics
I'm a lyrical misfit with the sadistic characteristics
I perform murderous acts on my tracks with a single breath
And if a boy wanna phi test, then I be stampin' upon his chest
Done makin' a mess - Not a man could conceive the weed I'm consumin'
And I transform from my cartoon pseudonym, turn to a human
I spit words from my mouth that be turnin' you inside out
And I tie knots in intestines just like I'm a boy scout
That's workin' 'em out - Now rearrangin' your whole skeletal structure
Then I find some nine inch nails to perform some acupuncture
When I punch ya, I rupture one of your rib cage in a rage
And I turn you into a cartoon toon and erase the page
I take you back to the stone age with Barney and Fred Flinstone
Get Dino to tear your Moschinos and then force you to limp home

[Life]
I'mma take off like a jet pack with the get back, rather step back
I'mma make the crowd react and nod they heads until they neck snap
I can flip raps while riding a skateboard and doin' a tic-tac
And leave your head in a spin like starin' at turn table skid mats
I'm a concrete lion, big cat - this is real talk, not big-chat
Did ya get that, cause I ain't no small timer - I rhyme on big tracks
Now fell the vibes I create, this heavy weight, I'm about to detonate
And demonstrate how I generate lyrics that supernaturally levitate
To the top of my lyrics escalate, accelerate and leave you panickin'
Take the ground from beneath your feet, leave you Skywalk-in' like Anakin
I'm sharper than the tips of Zulu spears and Olympic javelins
My style is totally buckwild and most definitely happenin'
To your brains I be tappin' in, to computers I be hackin' in
To me, I be out of this world like aliens who were time travelin'
I'm dabblin' in the Fists of Fury technique when I speak
Forget Karate Kid and these wooden blocks, I chop through concrete
Concrete, concrete, concrete!
Wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha!
[Si Phili]
I been stoned; ever since the days of creation, I've been red
I'm a mad dread, causin' so much havoc in Russel's head
My lyricism is just like an aneurysm inside his brain
He plays the beat in a trance and he's never feeling no pain
I could never be a racist because I possess so many faces
I'm one of those beat-up bad wit' bags and a pair of braces
With lines longer than laces - I'm gracin' you with my presence
The lyrics went flippin', makin' ya bubble like effervescence
I pulverize and bamboozle, shake numb skulls like a boodle
I smashed the top of your head with a guitar I borrowed from Noodle
I'm as animated as Japanese animes causin' calamities
Some serious savory from my roarous rhymes of reality
At the speed of sound, I'm wanderin' around - The clown done tried to defeat us
Without tenacities it's an audacity that you ever thought you could beat us
Beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us
Beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us
Beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us..."

We on a roll now, can't nobody stop our crew
You can treat us like convicts, you know we got records
On the shelf and on the charts the double decker
The fat donkey house down the block, belongs to me
You criticize the way I walk, you wanna see my bankbook?
I'm not a crook, I flipped the script and changed my ways
So I can get paid, everyday
I see the same old shit, I see in the streets
I know you think I'm sellin' keys but I only sell beats
Dopefiend music, it's drug related
You can buy it on the corner, get a radio and play it
It always sounds better when you turn it up loud
Rap music let these motherfuckers know what we about
I know these gay ass record labels keep fuckin' niggas
It's just like in the streets mane, how much you get?
[Chorus: Jay-Z]
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hangin' with the honies is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Bustin' my toast off the roof, drinkin' 90 proof 'til spring
Real niggas do real things

[Verse 3: Too $hort (Jay-Z)]
That's right, I been a hustler for a long time
Always got the right beats, never sayin' wrong rhymes
I started off with nothin' ended up with everything
Now we sip Hennessy in first class on every plane
Ask Jay-Z, he know what I'm sayin'
Always see me at the bank and yes I'm goin' again
There ain't no dollar amount, that can make me happy
Fine women, a big house, a truck and a Caddy (that's right)

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
Now peep, how sweet, niggas lives can get
Put beef aside, the East and Westside connect
$hort Dawg, and Jigga with the, fo'-fo' flow
I got love for y'all motherfuckers y'all just don't know
I know y'all got a thing for them rag six-fo's
I like the five speed drops pop the clutch then go
If you're ballin', keep ballin', if you jealous, stop
I want Biggie to rest in peace, as well as 'Pac
How real is that?
[Chorus: Jay-Z]
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hangin' with the honies is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Bustin' my toast off the roof, drinkin' 90 proof 'til spring
Real niggas do real things, check

[Outro: Too $hort & Jay-Z]
Beyotch! $hort Dawg's in the house
Jigga
Much love
$hort Dawg, get your money mane
All the way from the West coast
Uhh, how real is that"

And I'd like to tell her, I'd like to tell her
That I’m forever indebted

And bon voyage, bitch, I'm like Chef Boyardee
In this bitch, send a bomb to my mom's lawyer
I'm a problem for you, boy, you think you're Tom Sawyer
'Til I pull you out the fuckin' storybook and stomp on ya
Fuckin' fictitional characters and fairy tales
Prepare yourself for Captain America on Ferris wheels
But it ain't fiction, it's fact, boy, beware, it's real
Them lyrics you wield equal zero to a hero's shield
Mr. Fly-By-The-Seat-Of-His-Pants parasail
Fall, hit the trampoline, bounce and grab a pair of stilts
And I ain't wearin' zilch, zip, zero, nothing, no, nada

Yeah, boy, you know we're 'bout to put it down for you
So kick your shoes off in the foyer, have a sound voyage
And sayonara, see you fuckers tomorrow
Get some R&R and marinate in some marinara
And have a Coke and a smile, don't make me open a jar
Of whip-ass on ya, that's the last straw you're hopin' to draw
Yeah, you're fresher than most, boy, I'm just doper than all
Boy, I'm that boy, boy, them boys, them no up to par

I'm sick as hell, boy, you better run and tell someone else
Bringin' hell, boy, singin' telegrams and get dealt
And to that boy on them sedative meds who said he was better
I bet he never seen Freddy in a black and red little sweater
Back, better than ever, the cheddar shredder, the grater
The beef grinder, I'll settle vendettas a little later
Givin' haters incubators, think you made a mistake
By sayin' Shady was ghost, I ain't even close to the gate
You got one foot in the grave, just stay put and behave
I'm 'bout to turn this fuckin' place to Beirut in a day
So, hey, wouldn't you say I'm the shit? Couldn't agree with you more
If you were to say that my fuckin' shit doesn't stink

Gym Class Heroes. Cool and Dre
This is. You silly for this one
Whats wrong with me? Its Travie
Why you doing this to me? Ha ha

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
I started rappin, back of the class, scribbling tracks in hopes
That one of my jokes a have the pretty young things laughing
A chubby little bastard with a nack for little debbie snacks
But what I lacked in looks I made up for it in passion
No advance and plus we make it happen
And ya concious more obnoxious in that laffy taffy snappin
Goodbye yesterday's rags, hello high fashion
Years before you's a man, then built a castle with sand
With no regards for tidal waves I finally established
Til water comes in gallon drums and wipes away my palace
But now I'm sitting lovely off in wonderland with Alice
With purple people passing me at the caterpillars chalice
Ha ha, you probably thinking I'm wrong right
Like I should quit writing these songs right
Tell you what, do it better I just might
Take it back to 86 you wanna lick sike
[Bridge 1: Travie McCoy]
Don't let the tv mislead you, me and you dude we are not equal
Fuck you this is for my people, fuck you this is for my people
Don't try to hide like I can't see you
Your parents must a been trans you so see through
Fuck you this is for my people, fuck you this is for my people

Before I utter words and before I start to begin
Let me make sure you clear I'm about securring the win
I puzzle up my words while I piece another concoction
Cause I'm stubborn with the thought that failure is never an option
I grinds like a carpenter til my calluses bleed
With the passion from my heart to the many mouths that I feed
That's why I look at most of you stupid I know its odd
Because you can't really do nothing to me unless you God
Well being that none of you ain't him
You can't fuck with me now watch me erase them
Now trust me see I'm so determined
I'm walking through the heap of gauntlets how the fire was burning
Or how the tire was turning on the rim of the V
I laugh and shake it off the shit they be doing to me
With all the yappin and talking and so and so
You think that you could ever stop the kid OH NO
[Bridge 2: Busta Rhymes]
So if you get in my way, you know you done son
You best believe what I say, you better run son
Fuck you because I do this for my loved ones
Fuck you because I do this for my loved ones
You better kneel down and pray, cause where I come from
We going hard everyday, that's how the fights won
Fuck you because I do this for my loved ones
Fuck you because I do this for my loved ones

Everything you said is finally setting in
The training wheels fell off and I kept pedaling
Now I'm riding wheelies on this industry
Say the word and I'll ghost ride this bitch instantly
Good looking pop all the strength that you giving me
Wasn't for you GymClass would be history
I'm on my upstate shit
I was Brooklyn broke but now I'm upstate rich
Getting brain from two dames with french accents
I don't mess with local chicks I get em upstate shipped

Power Freestyle Remix,Money Carlo,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Money Carlo]
When im spittin it, bars sick with it, Ritalin, barbiturates
Mix it with penicillin, the ceiling should start spinning if
You sniff it, cook and wiff it, whip it, put ya wrist in it
King of the kitchen, listen whats missing a glass dick with it
Way above ya budget I ain’t breaking or budging
Not forsaken I’m skating, skeeting in the face of the public
Cause shine I deserve to murk you not a square up in my circle
Got em geeking like Ukel, pen got the bird flu, gotta go in like curfew
Skills so slick ya tounge slip, fall and twist
Break and split trying to whisper what I spit
I’m like bitch I’m on my shit, gorilla in the bricks
Niggas know he untamed, I’m up lame, all you see is blood stains, tucked chains
Miss me with that bitch shit, cause its a risk clocking this wrist
A arsonist with this I’m hot as Syphilis piss
Niggas lame so I explain it out in layman’s
Smoking dro on the plane, I’m like dang, I’m hydroplaning
No clue but ya’ll accept it, no glue, but I’m connected
No rules, I don’t respect it, I bruise stretch it and wreck it
Every second I’m breaking records like snapping 45
The threads is fresh to death, but the swag is going live
I’m back up in it, kinda slacked for a minute, so I looked back, backed up and backflipped it
Flipped back gift wrap all the comp on they back ready for the Hacksaw Jimmin
Never pause for a skeez got them b’s on the knee’s
Like all praise thee my liege
Bitch I’m the King, ducking Lee Harve, on my A game looking for a B job
He ice grilling me, like he a G, fucking with C, see em in the ER
I get it split it unwrap it whip, make it do what it does
Now its berling (boiling) its magic like Merlin, ya’ll can’t fuck with me cuz
Now go find it, time it rewind it try to, figure what the fuck I spit

Indo smoke and money's my thang (my thang)
I keep my mind on the green (Crestsiders!)

Now open up your mind take a ride with me
And hit up on the spliff with your brain on G
We hit the track thinking scratch, big bank, and scrill
Money making schemes so the dreams be real
Just a hog in the game thinking schemes to get paid
Hound on the hook represent the pimp Trey
Never sport a fade, known to let the perm bang
Coming through siding with them Chevys on thangs
Known to serve a trick nothing but them with the spits
Player haters hate cause your boy be on hit
Cause I'm down to make it quick, the fetti and the cents
Never pay the rent cause your boy be on hemp
And the hemp to my brain check the game, keep it sharp
Sesed Out, Strictly running with the mob
Steady fetti related won't lag 'bout the Leroy
Smashing in the four door, that's how it be boy

With a pack of Backwoods and some hurt ya D

Gotta stack G's shake mutts and the fleas

Stack G's for my needs 30 rounds when I shoot

Chasing fetti like a hound dog, G's what I spend

My Opinion,Mac Mall,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","(Khayree...)
(What's up?)
(...drop some dope on these fools.)

[Verse 1]
My name is young Mac Mall, mayne, and this is my opinion
And since I got your attention there's some shit I would like to mention
Fuck them punk ass rollers, them highway type of strollers
'Cause they be wanting to bust them big fat caps in ghetto souljas
I guess they wanna fold us, but see we won't just have that
Because I'm from the streets in '93 and playas bust back
I might just be a dead man
Because I speak rebellion
They already did Malcolm X and Dr. King
There ain't no tellin'
The government they hatin me
But still I pack .380
That's why I won't put back
'Cause Uncle Sam, he never paid me
Soon as they try to fade, then today's their pay day
I'm standing in the cuts fuckin' it up with my AK-
47 ways them black brothas won't behave
And since I'm stressed I'm on the quest to put them in their grave
I'm trying to go to school but the system wasn't havin' me
Some say it's technicality but this is just reality
In 1992 you know how crazy I was feelin'
[Hook]
My name is young Mac Mall, mayne, and this is my opinion
This is my opinion[x4]

(Aww man, Mac Mall why you comin' like that, mayne?
You know thats that shit, mayne, straight from the Crestside, mayne
You know they can't fuck with this, mayne; uhhh, that's that shit!)

[Verse 2]
My name is young Mac Mall, mayne and this is my opinion
I had to set up shop, but it ain't rocks that I be dealin'
The ghetto type of feelin', the drug money and killin'
I speak in a playa style, it's gon' make me a million
I'm tryna live very happily but fools be wantin' to cap on me
That's why up under my coat, it's something dope
Then I be packin', G
It's gonna be a tragedy on your whole family
So call them punk police, them little old pussies can't even handle me
You might think I'm a criminal, but this is not subliminal
I'm tryna spit that knowledge to my folks but you don't hear me though
Some might think I rock gang fuss, but all I want is justice
And my chance to get on the mike and spit game to these hustlas
And if you like the realness
You might think this appealing

[Hook]
My name is young Mac Mall, mayne, and this is my opinion
This is my opinion[x4]
(Haha, yeah though nigga, that's that shit though
You mothafuckas need to hear the shit he spitting though
But you don't hear it though, you just some little old punk mothafuckas, mayne
He spitting that real Crestside Sawyer Street playa type shit, mayne
Mothafuckas. I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm hitting this shit mayne, haha, biatch, biatch, biatch!)

[Verse 3]
'Cause now I got my chance, to speak my opinion freely
They need to fit on blinders 'cause these fools don't want to see me
I'm poppin' like a preemie, sometimes I wear a beanie
It's on like that told ya 'cause that doja got me dreamy
When fools be pimpatratin', it's causin' me frustration
And there's no hesitation in a snitch assassination
Mac Mall is just a youngsta, hustla, thugsta
But if you fiend for dope ass raps, fool I'mma plug ya
And them mothafuckas, them brothas
Is from another planet
They must don't understand it, how they take they life for granted
So tell me, can you really fuck with this young buck?
I take you on a ride in the trunk tied up
And with luck, maybe they can find ya, and sign ya
Off as a loss 'cause you tossed of Carquinez
Bridge, and if you live, make dibs on the wood box
I be kicking the Rasta shit and don't sport the dreadlocks

'pinion, 'pinion, Mac Mall, mayne, and this is my opinion
Opinion, opinion, my name is young Mac Mall, mayne, and this is my opinion
(Uh, Mac Mall, man, that shit is so muthafuckin' vicious, mayne. You know that's that pimp shit, mayne. What's up, mayne? Could I be down with the muthafuckin' SES Faculty, mayne? Come on, man, take me to the Sawyer strip, mayne. I need some of that doja, mayne.)"
Livin N The Bay,Young Cellski,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","
As a youngsta I've always been around some funk
I'm watchin niggas duck from buck shots of the pump
Bein around this shit made a nigga violent at times
Servin D the dope was beatin em down if they don't sell mine
Cuz you know that's how the fuckin game goes
Niggas gettin beat with bats gettin stalked with steel
Toes a nigga was no older than thirteen or fourteen
When the bank was on I cocked a gun from a dope fiend
Little six shot, 38 special
Cause when the bang is on you got to be strong livin up the ghetto
Me and my niggas walkin around straight gassin'
Mug on mean funkin' wit niggas up in my classic
Four deep is how niggas roll up in Frisco
And everywhere you go a nigga got to pack a pistol
The beef is back on but I don't really know the reason
Supposed to be a truce but niggas started bangin' season
So I'm letting it be known I'm fading niggas with the chrome-9
Me and my niggas walking around with Macs and the 45
So how you wanna handle your biz, you bitch-made mark?
Leave you dead to the head in Ocean View Park
Cause when the bang is on niggas coming out the cuts
Wit artillery in their hand ready to start to buck
Have them bitch-made niggas trying to make my day
Cuz that's how it is when you're livin in the Bay
[Hook]
Comin up in the bay it's like a motherfucking zoo
The Bay Area ain't no joke
Every nigga do whatever the fuck he gotta do
The Bay Area ain't no joke

Boom boom boom was the sound that I heard
As I walked to the turf and took my hide cuz I was perved
Thinkin to myself I hope my niggas ain't hit
Cuz you know niggas dying young over stupid shit
Ran to the turf to see what happened
Find out my niggas was cappin at some niggas that was gassin in a
Caprice Classic come to find out it was them niggas that we was funkin' with
Ain't gonna say no truce to set cuz I be starting shit
But you know how the story goes livin in the Bay
V-Town, Oaktown, Richmond, and E.P.A
Frisco! words goin down all the fucking time
For all young niggas on the bang when they on the grind
Niggas walking around they packed, packin nines and carryin Macs
In they nuts or they drawers pocket, a crack sack
Po's on the turf waitin for some shit to go down
Niggas comin up short fucking wit the fogtown
Cuz in Frisco you never can predict
Cuz in the town man the fog is just too thick
And niggas gettin smoked comin up short where I live
Another dead body washed up by the Bay Bridge, nigga
Cuz that's how it is where youngstas living
Where niggas always takin and they never giving
So you better listen to what I gotta say
Cuz that's how it is when you're livin in the Bay
[Hook]

Livin day by day by the Bay it's the same thing
Niggas smokin dank sellin D and gang bangin
Livin in the illy-ac-town of San Fran-psycho
Where niggas doin drive-bys on motorcycles
Got crooked ass niggas who jack for a living
But I can't blame a nigga cuz ain't nobody giving
A mothafucking thing so I bang for mine
Even if it means robbing and killing when you're on the grind
Because a nigga gots to have some type of funds
And niggas kicked out the house can't count on mom
And a nigga gotta do anything I can
Even if it means rushing every set with rocks in my hand
And that right there tells you that life's a bitch
A nigga got three strikes and they swung a pitch
And that's how niggas live day by day
Cuz that's how it is livin up in the bay, mayne"

Boy, come on, get with this 'cause you can't diss this
I'm burnin' your ass like syphillis
A fast brother, you're just a lover with a slow hand
I freeze MCs into Frosty the Snowman
No man withstands the pain of brain cells
Phaser, hellraiser, cut like a laser, Polo plays a part
Inside the arts, the rap charts start to break you apart, so get smart
You cry for help, knowin' you felt the rhyme
Makin' the track melt, Polo chops like a black belt
MCs are grounded, pounded down, astounded
Rounded up, pounds of sounds when I drowned 'em
Surrounded, check the date, and play when rate too great
Related too late, I demonstrate fate
I'm fast and passin' the stage of an assassin
Massacre, in a mass I start blastin'
Theoretical, periodical
Blowin' up particles of molecules, here, read the articles
Every time I built a plan, it killed a man
MCs got smoked without a filter and
Scuffed and puffed like marijuana
Terminator of data and your rhymes is Sarah Connor
You can't rip up, rap up, slip up, slap up
'Cause you're trapped up to get capped up
Play the back of this here scenery
You clowns'll get broke down like machinery
I bring trouble on the double, bust you like a bubble
Hard rocks are crushed into rubble
The gates of Hell open wide, so scope in
And I'm hopin' you're brought to the Pope and
The Holy Bible when you made your arrival
Now, the name of the game is survival
The result isn't real difficult, the strategy:
Stayin' Alive like John Travolta
My rhymes are gettin' hotter
I got around to a lot of towns like a Globetrotter
So, I'mma give you the Hell that you brought me in
I'm a king with the sting of a scorpion
I just follow your footprint, trace, track and blackout
You better shout to get a rap out
What I arrange, invented is strange, demented, deranged
You changed when I entered
A stage of furious rage when I had this madness
Badness, you felt sadness
Raps are brave and outrageous
All those chicken rhymes you written
Should be put in the Yellow Pages
I stand tall, play the wall and watch your brain stall
And wet your ass like rainfall
I think you need a replacement, you're illin'
Call that buildin', boy? You're still in the basement
My brain cell swells to jam like a pelican
Fresh out of breath, death left you a skeleton
I'm gonna need your full cooperation
This is a matter of life and death, operation
To ease a man in the siege of surgery
Bein' done without anesthesia
Go slow? Hell no, I let the beat kick
And I get wicked like the Witches of Eastwick
I'm not soft, I kill suckers off
Disarmin' it, bombin' it, off in a coffin
You get struck and just like a motherfuckin' duck and
Plucked this shit out of luck and bucked
Designated to self-destruct
Knocked around like a hockey puck
K-double-O-L G R-A-P, N-O M-C plays me
You wish your name had a G
But to be a badder G, boy, you gotta play with strategy
Top rankin', thinkin' ability, memory bankin'
But instead, you're just sinkin'

Rain, rain dollar bills in my dreams
Bitches fighting for me like it’s Jerry Spring’
But this the Summer, Winter, they falling for me
Colder than a coca cola polo, 7 degrees

Remove your top, time to pop
She said she like it rough, so I beat it up, pussy punch

Lose your mind, lose your sense

Fill my cup high as trees, relax feel the breeze
All jokes aside, got a mistress on the side

It's always a risk you take
Doing a different take
Big mistake rappers make

Some just complain about the status of rap
They say it's average in fact
They wish the eighties was back
I say everything's everything
Nothing stays the same
And yet, it is the same, just given a different name

And it can get Ripgut Cannibal if you wish
Cause nigga, it's E-B-K everyday all day to the day I die
I'm creepin' through your set with a mini mac 10 A-R One Five
Ruger with a 12 gauge pump in the trunk and a black beanie disguise
That nigga that you can't see just cause of them bloccsta locs over my eyes
Crept like a black cat through the mack
With a Mac 10 on my lap and a fat sack of that shag
Took a hit of that shit and seen some niggas with a fo fifth
So I let 'em have it, ounces of O-E fo'-oh, no-doz, Indonesia spliffs
And a 9 millimeter for the nigga that'll dump and pump one in yo' bitch

Running to the 'llac threw my strap in the back
Twist me up a sack and I'm back at the Garden Blocc
Kicking it with maniac, the nigga that'll mainly act
Sicker than sick when a clip's in progress
Put 'em underground with a brain full of them nine slugs
Then read 'em in Reader's Digest, Uh!

Half of the doja, half of the O-E
Half of the fact that I'm that insane

Where niggas never put their Glocks up
And get their cocks sucked nigga you just can't stop a

I put my pencil to the paper and watch lighting strike
Casual, the innovator, in a state of advancement
MC scolder, breakdancin on the lake when it freeze over
So much game, I told her I'm a disease holder and I still hit it
Bust a nut in her eye and made her deal with it
The straight bump, y'all, yeah you best agree
Whatever that sess do don't let you come next to me
Mentally, I'm compatible with Macintosh
And I can get a nigga's bitch in the sack with floss
Hop on the microphone
Actin lost, unaware, unprepared
Then I bust off the top
And niggas get scared

Uhh, now I told y'all I wasn't playin
It's Hieroglyphics in here
Now that's Cas, now you know that's how it was, That's How It Is
We bout to do it with my next man, A-PLUSS

A to the, Plus must do ya, bust through ya
Defenses with lyrics mentally muscular
Holdin down like cement shoes, to make you drown right
This is what we do if we the crew you sound like
I can't stand a person bitin someone's creativity
I have so many styles that you can take one as a gift from me
It's like deja vu whenever you pop they tape in
Lyin more than Satan, fallin off like they was ice skatin
Trying to get they mic taken, you get scolded
And chastized, my holy mic, is baptized
Givin flatlines to you rap guys and still send you
Back with black eyes, on the mic you telling fat lies

Hold up, stop the presses, this just came in
Del's done it again, you gotta get his name in
He's, infallible in battle flows and battle royals
Collects all the spoils of soiled celebrities
Shape my fantasy as the form, lyrical odyssey
It's not modesty, I show my ass for all to see
Polishin wax with facts sharp like tacks
To stop your heart like cracks
Rip, apart the tracks

[Interlude three]
Na-na-na-na-now you know that's self explanatory
Now we bout to get busy with my man Tajai
Break out your notebooks and your pads
Listen real closely to what this brother has to say

[Tajai]
I kick the, Acura like dialect
It's sacrilege, steppin in the sanctuary of the sacrosanct
Do not desecrate acquiesce
Before I dessicate all your flows and leave you dry as bones
It's awful how I decimate, but also awesome
People say that they saw something they cherished they lives long
When I expectorate upon a song
To be honest number one's what I expect to rank
Not for just the crown jewels or scepter
Out for justice, and exposition of the rest as jesters
With they lackluster compositions
Suckers in estrus, thinkin that Heiroglyphics won't fuck you?
[Interlude four]
Oh my goodness, I told ya
Once again, it's Hieroglyphics
We got the smooth lineup, Tajai, A-Plus, Del, Casual
They just to' it up, forget about it, leave it alone
It's Hieroglyphics from here on out
You don't know what you're doin
And me, I'm the Extra Prolific, Whiz Kid
Y'all can't mess with this, leave it alone
Drop ya pen, it's time that we go on
Let us alone y'all, can't fade this
You know how we do it.."

He bought it with the money he got from his chores
He robbed the candy shop, told her lay down on the floor

To kill the infidels and American devils
A bomb on his waist, a mask on his face
Prays five times a day and listens to heavy metal
Little Alex got a gun he took from his dad
That he snuck into school in his black book bag
His black nail polish, black boots, and black hat
He going to blow away the bully that just pushed his ass
Little Joker got a gun he bought on the street
To go and kill the niggas that beat him up last week
Cause he don't let go of none of his past beefs
Bullets flying out the window, shells landing on the seats
Little Sarah got a gun from her Uncle Sam
She got armor-piercing rounds and her gun don't jam
She got laser-guided rockets, she killing to go to college
She thought it was an insurgent, it was some old man

Well let me tell ya
Pull a gat so quick
Insane, your life ain't shit
Because I listened to your footsteps follow me
Of course I'm strapped with a gat so your creeping don't bother me
Cause once upon a time in the old school
I got robbed, jacked me by this old fool
But back then, J, I really didn't know no better
That's why I went home and grabbed the .25 Beretta
And ran there fast to the scene of the robbery
Knowing he wouldn't be there
But he's standing on the side of me!
Pop! Pop! I had to do him cause he did me
My name's Dru Down
You shoulda took it more seriously
Nigga, I'm just a playa from the Oak
So recognize game cause I'm a pimp
Also pimpin hoes
I say the bigger the better
Oh I would never
Be a player hater cause I'm a playa
Play ya major
But now I gets off so when it comes to shooting rounds
Well then you will know, punk
Why they call me Dru Down
See, you's a goddamn fool because I'm sick with the shit
I bust the punk off because I'm steady making licks
They call me Dru Down because I'm drawing on these suckers
Your pockets is long? Well let me make 'em a little shorter
Brace yourself! That's what I say when I'm pointing the chrome
Now whacha think I'mma say
When I'm running through your home?
Now picture: me and Ol' Black are running through your damn kitchen
I'll stuff you in the stove and bake your ass like some chicken
Cause I'm the crazy nigga that'll turn and do that shit
I'll make ya screamin' ""Yeah!"" while yet I'm sayin' ""shut up, bitch!""
I finally realized that my name's ""make me sick""
Sicka than what you get when you're lying in the cukoo nest
Now see, can you get
With the nigga Dru Down, straight full of it
And if you don't know me
You will know when you hit the town
There's a reason why they call me Dru Down

Dru muthafuckin Down for your ass, two-time
Coming for your mind

Earning the name Dru Down is kinda difficult
You wanna try to earn my name? Buy a gat and start shootin' fools
Cause to get my stripes I was no punk
I walked the streets in '89 with a gauge pump
But now it's '93 I got a new spot
I made it real hot
But went and bought me a brand new black Glock
Shooting motherfuckers in the leg
Pistol whippin suckas, hittin' em dead in the head
Cause I don't give a fuck, nor do I care less
But just to be aware I'm being strapped with a vest
Cause if I get caught on the sleep
I'll bet you motherfuckers wanna fill me with some heat
But I'm not going for it pull a fully, use all rounds
And then you will know, punk
Why they call me Dru Down
Three times for your motherfuckin' minds

I'm from where the cut-throats cut coke
Cause school ain't cut it, they cut out to puff smoke
And guess what? That's who I hang with
So when you speak Industry, I don't know the language
But play a beat and I'll show you why I'm head honcho

Another magazine spread, yeah you fuckin' right
I'm on my grind like a pair of in-line skates
Get on tracks and go bananas like a primate
Baboon, gorilla, chimpanzee, a wild ape
King Kong when he escape, I'm 'bout to skyscrape
But the sky ain't the limit
I could teleport through my mind any minute
Take you to a place where the lions go ""ribbit""
All the frogs ""roar"" and the fire is frigid
I'm outta this world, don't belong here
What good is heiring the throne if I taught you from a small chair?
Family, you niggas got it twisted
Flow out of the box, yours chicken and a biscuit
Give me Chicken Pox when I listen, I be itchin'
To cripple your career like a ligament is missin'

When I swing it's knockouts I ain't gettin' a decision

Can't escape my bars: no visitors permitted
Welcome to Hell where Joell holds a pitchfork
And you burn in eternal flames for your bitch-talk
Dick in my hand: I'm pissed off
But I ain't bucklin', everyday I'm hustlin': Rick Ross
One day the whole globe will know that I'm Clark Kent

I'm on fire, you got a little buzz: Miller Lite
Man there's so many words runnin' 'round my brain
If I don't put them on a track I would go insane
Maybe that's why everything I say is crazy
And everyday I wake up, with a naked lady
With a V.I.P. band on my right wrist
Pants on the floor, J.D. with a slight sip left in the bottle
'Telly key on the nightstand
I go to the bathroom to pee, and then I scram
I live the life of a rock star
They ain't wanna let me through, so I became a cop car
Put the sirens on every time I touch a pen
Everybody move like dope: that's a fuckin' '10'
My peers know I'm gonna win
This music's like my first crush, for years I wanted in
I'm here. Oh boy will you taste the wrath
I'mma make it ugly like what's underneath Jason's mask

All y'all niggas do is whine like Jamaican ass
Every night I celebrate, we take a glass of champagne to the brain
Sometimes we take a bath
Victory feels far better
Than defeat; you niggas weak: Solar's Letter

My worst rhyme's 30 times rougher than your hottest bars ever
I could front like a car fender
Cause everything I'm on, DJs pull up like the bartenders

And I might be buggin but it seem to me
That cartoons be realer than reality TV
They inspire my decision to be open and listen
But folks got it all twisted, like a yoga position
Like in order to spit it dope, you gotta have a criminal past
That's similar to the cast of Different Strokes
Me and my people break bread, sit and smoke
The conversation rich but that depend on what you consider broke
I draw on anything for inspiration
A fond memory, a piece of paper, walls in a train station
[Chorus: Talib Kweli]
It's just that I'm old school like that
Roll that rap over soul loops like that
It's just that I'm old school like that
Roll that rap over soul loops like that
(I'm old school y'all, keep it goin y'all) It's just that I'm old school like that
(I keep it goin y'all, here we go, we'll see) Roll that rap over soul loops like that
(I'm old school y'all, keep it goin y'all) It's just that I'm old school like that
(Keep it goin y'all, ah here we go, c'mon) Roll that rap over soul loops like that
Yeah!

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
And we'll be right back after these messages
Fellas grab your nutsacks, chicks squeeze your breastesses
We ain't all that grown, it's still funny like
Goin to the store on your own with rainbow money
Since then had an insane flow sonny
Walkin to the corner rhymin in the rain, nose runny
Breakdancin maybe ten, bummy
Is when Subroc would run up handspring Arabian somee!
Ooh wee, like a Hong Kong Phooey kick
Or a weekend afternoon, karate movie flick
Slept good, no justice, no peace
Woody kept it hoody, never discussed it with police
Shot the fair one nobody ran to get the gat
Or felt they had to put it up in they raps to set it fat
And since when lyrical skills had to do with killin a cat?
What type of chitlins is that?
The Super Villain has the bad hydrotonic
Whoever willin to ride, provide raw chronic
[Chorus: Talib Kweli]
It's just that I'm old school like that
Roll that rap over soul loops like that
It's just that I'm old school like that
Roll that rap over soul loops like that
(I'm old school y'all, keep it goin y'all) It's just that I'm old school like that
(I keep it goin y'all, here we go, we'll see) Roll that rap over soul loops like that
(I'm old school y'all, keep it goin y'all) It's just that I'm old school like that
(Keep it goin y'all, ah here we go, c'mon) Roll that rap over soul loops like that

These are last words of a hanging slave
How could I forget this
I rob you, put you on my hit list
Under my nails are dirty look at the grime
My burnt lips from the roach clips
How can I shine
Being broke and bag a dope bitch
Powerful minds, we brave men
I blow smoke and I'ma keep sayin'
These are last words of a hanging slave

[Verse 1: Nashawn]
I wanna be more than that bullet that go through ya zone
Wanna be the lead that tear through ya skin and crack bones
Wanna be the heat you feel makin' ya moan
Wanna be the hospital bed that you lay on
Wanna be the god you feel when you pray-on
It's Nashawn the type that get the hyper calm
I'm gonna kill somethin', rap cats be real frontin'
Fuck shootin' legs, cock back put his brains on the pave
Nigga how 'bout that, close range with the gauge get payed
First rapper to shoot off stage
Turn the front page the next day, my life is like a book
A twenty four hour song without no hook
Millennium Thug computer chips up in my slug
Turn corners when you turn corners, know who to plug
Thugs around me outside its grimy outside
Better slide before you get bodied outside

I'ma prison cell six by nine
Livin' hell stone wall metal bars for the gods in jail
My nickname the can, the slammer, the big house
I'm the place many fear 'cause there's no way out
I take the sun away put misery instead
When you with me most folks consider you dead
I saw too many inmates fallin' apart
Call for the guards to let them out at night when it's dark
Convicts think they alone but if they listen close
They can hear me groan touch the wall feel my pulse
All the pictures you put up is stuck to my skin
I hear ya prayers (even when ya whisperin')
I make it hotter in the summer, colder in the winter
If the court parole ya then another con enters
No remorse for your tears I seen 'em too often
When you cry I make you feel alive inside a coffin
Watch you when you eat play with you mind when you sleep
Make you dream that you free then you wake up to me
Face to face with a cage no matter your age
I can shatter you turn you into a savage in rage
Change ya life that's if you get a chance to get out
'Cause only you and I know what sufferings about
Yo it's stunnin' when bed sheets become your woman
And I'm the one that gotcha weapons when the beef is comin'
Maybe one day I'll open up my arms to release you
You'll always be my property nigga stay legal...

Mama Said Knock You Out,LL Cool J,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
C'mon, man
And with the local DBC news
LL Cool J with a triumphant comeback
Word (But tonight—)

[Verse 1]
Don't call it a comeback, I been here for years
I'm rocking my peers, putting suckas in fear
Making the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosions, overpowering
Over the competition, I'm towering
Wrecking shop when I drop
These lyrics that'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare stare, you better move
Don't ever compare
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced
Competition's paying the price

[Chorus]
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
[Verse 2]
Don't you call this a regular jam
I'm gonna rock this land
I'm gonna take this itty-bitty world by storm
And I'm just getting warm
Just like Muhammad Ali, they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this beat like a skull
That you know I had beef with
Why do you riff with me? The maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy get ready 'cause it might go blaow
How ya like me now?
The Ripper will not allow
You to get with, Mr. Smith, don't riff
Listen to my gear shift
I'm blasting, outlasting
Kinda like Shaft, so you could say I'm shafting
Olde English filled my mind
And I came up with a funky rhyme

[Chorus]
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh), breakdown

Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie (Yeah)
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie (Yeah)
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie (Uh)
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie (Huh)

[Verse 3]
Shadow boxing when I heard you on the radio
Uh, I just don't know
What made you forget that I was raw?
But now I got a new tour
I'm going insane
Starting the hurricane, releasing pain
Letting you know that you can't gain
I maintain unless ya say my name
Ripping, killing, digging and drilling a hole
Pass the ol' gold

[Chorus]
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
[Verse 4]
Shotgun blasts are heard
When I rip and kill at will
The man of the hour, tower of power
I'll devour
I'm gonna tie you up and let you
Understand that I'm not your average man
When I got a jammy in my hand
Damn
Ooh, listen to the way I slay
Your crew
Damage, uh, damage, uh
Damage, uh, damage
Destruction, terror, and mayhem
Pass me a sissy-soft sucka, I'll slay him
Farmers (What?) Farmers (What?)
I'm ready (We ready)
I think I'm gonna bomb a town (Get down)
Don't you never, ever, pull my lever
'Cause I explode
And my nine is easy to load
I gotta thank God
'Cause he gave me the strength to rock hard

[Chorus]
Knock you out
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)

Quas, when he really hit star mode
Never will he boost loose Phillies with the bar-code
Or take a whole carload on a wasted trip
Or sit White Owl laced tip from tip with yip
Some rather baggies others like their cracks in vials
Catch a tag, roll a bag of schwag in a Black & Mild
He twist Optimo, just the raw leaf part
The list top go: bust before beef start
At the Stop-n-Go Mart, actin' like a spirit host done it
""America's most blunted!""
Yeah, yo
DOOM nominated for the best rolled L's
And they wondered how he dealt with stress so well
Wild guess? You could say he stay sedated
Some say buddha-ed, some say faded
Someday pray that he will grow a farm barn full
Recent research show it's not so darn harmful (True)
Sometimes you might need to detox
It can help you with your rhyme flow and your beat-box
Off spite to your surprise
Turn a Newport Light to a joint right before your eyes
Tear a page out the good book, hear it how you want it

Consume weed and drink brew 'til we perfume the room
The Beat Konducta smoke twenty-four/seven
Shady, you can even ask my reverend
Willie knows, how the Phillies roll, really though
I spend my last dough to pick up the sticky gold
I spark the lah, but don't shh with speed or trees with seeds
Quasimoto crew, we get keyed
The most blunted on the map
The one astro black, in the alley, with a hoodrat
Hoodrat, when you try to react
Shut the **** up! Even your pops got smacked
Even your moms got cracked
""Meanwhile!""- While my bowl got packed
*Gulp*, drop X so you can have good sex (What, no)
I smoke dank so I can grow me a shank

[Verse 2]
Go to a vagina orchard, count 1, 2, 3
Spin that plant around, you got a third world country
That's right, consider yourself warned
I'm offensive and creative like handicapped porn
You're playing with your breasts, excuse me, can I try it ma'am?
You're pushin' em together like a titty Venn diagram
Look at that crack! Excuse me can I buy a gram?
Right below your diaphragm, ass looks like you're hidin' ham
First base, we're makin' out
Second base, I'm gettin' faked out
I said, third base, I'm gettin' take out
And I'd try to take it home if I knew I'd take it out
But I just don't know, I said I just don't care
I said my flow's so cold I need a tampon from a polar bear
And you can spell and smell my stink
B.O. lingers and it makes you think

[Hook]
I'm Bo yo
And I'm the greatest rapper ever
And I'll weather your weather whether you think I'm clever or not
Think you're better, you're not
Don't need a sweater, I'm hot
I'm a real G, shawty, that can really find your G-spot
Whoa, yeah
Provided that you point me in the general direction
Well, get ready
[Verse 3]
'Cause girls are like donuts when I be bustin' Bo nuts
I can make 'em cream-filled or give them a layer of glaze
I'm like Doug's friend Skeeter whenever I meet her
Because I skeet her so hard people call her Patty Mayonnaise
(Oh! Nickelodeon and cum!)
(What?)
Yo, I'm blowin' up like I thought I would
I'm circumcised, 'cause I don't cum from the hood
My girl is epileptic 'cause she's the one I'm jerkin' with
Come on, you Asian child laborer, show me what you're workin' with... (ooh, large machinery?)

'Cause there's an inverse relationship between respect and sects
I'm talking about religious sects like a Mormon sect
That says you can't have sex with members of the different sects
But you can't have sex with members of the same sex
So if the sects can't be different, the sex can't be same
Then the only sex left is some left hand shame
And girl I left you 'cause you left the game
And if that don't feel right then you can write my name

[Hook]
'Cause I'm Bo yo
And I'm the greatest rapper ever
And I'll weather your weather whether you think I'm clever or not
Think you're better, you're not
Don't need a sweater, I'm hot
I'm a real G that can really find your G spot
Whoa, yeah
Oh, but I'm inadequate
Have I gotten that point across yet? (how original)
[Verse 4]
Yo, my junk's so long that it hangs and swings
So at the nude beach, people think I'm lookin for lost rings
Play the skin flute, your big boy sings
If you want to take it all wear African neck rings
(They make your neck longer, cause, um um... fuck it.)

Haters call me gay, but that ain't hatin'
Cause I'm not homophobic, my morals are straight, and
If I'm in the closet then you are below me
Takin' the b-a-t out of basement, homie, yeah
Yo, yeah, what

[Hook]
'Cause I'm Bo yo
And I'm the greatest rapper ever
And I'll weather your weather whether you think I'm clever or not
Think you're better, you're not
Don't need a sweater
I'm a real G, that can really find your what now?
Oh, yeah, well I'm Bo yo, yo, what
I'm representing you
I'm representing the people from the 01982, yo
Oh, yeah, what
Yo, motherfucker, tinkle
Yeah"

A little grease always keeps the wheels a-spinning
Like sitting on twenty threes to get the squealers grinning
Hitting on many trees, feel real linen
Spitting on enemies, get the steel for tin men
Where no brains but gum flap
He said his gun clap, then he fled after one slap (Pap!)
Son, shut your trap, save it for the bitches
Mmm, delicious, rapp snitch knishes

Dont Play This Song,Kid Cudi,"['hip hop', 'pop', 'r&b', 'rock']","[Intro]
Hey, let's have some fun this time

[Chorus: Kid Cudi, Kid Cudi & Mary J. Blige]
Wanna know what it sound like when I'm not on drugs?
Please, please don't play this song

People think they really being helpful
By telling me please be careful, yeah right
R-r-right, r-right, right, right
Please, please don't play this song
Yeah, haha

[Verse 1]
Pain, hurt, sadness, and loneliness
Balled all that shit right up
Tossed it away to the bottomless pit
The part of my mind that slips
And the part of my mind so sick
I don't even like to take the trip unless I'm sloppy drunk
I pray for my mom, how a teach had a son
That never gave a fuck about a scantron?
All I wanted was to be a human being
And show all the world some new colors and scenes
Imagine all types of beautiful scenery
I remember when I first had trees
Smoked out a Black and Mild, so dumb of me
Now, I'm grape Cigarillo man
Any young black kid, guaranteed fan
Hold it down, humble pie on the humble
And I treat normal girls like models
Reckless and young, and my, my mom's calling
Think I should hit decline
I'm numb faced while I'm thinking 'bout suicide

Black Robin Hood, riding high just like we should
You know the saying, ain't no delaying
Gotta gets the getting while the getting's good
Yeah, demented, my brain was forced to transform
Wise up, I'm checking the gate
On humble tales and minimum wage
The blogs tell it, ""Cudi's lame
Wearing a kilt? He must be gay""
Let's keep it trill, fuck being discreet
But some girls tweet how they miss my meat
Yeah, Cudders; HBO, that Vitamin Water
That's money to blow 'cause it's money for blow
Don't take no shit, you can blame my ma
I'm in the maze, I'm in a daze, I'm losing it
I'm locking in my rocketship
I'll be a blip on your radar, bitch
Feels like things can be covered
Until the day I'm above myself, hovered

Apologize,Kanye West,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Ah-ahem
This something I did
Something I can explain how to
I can't speak for everybody, but, uh
Man...

[Verse 1]
There must be more good women than men, percentage-wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
That's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guys
And mess with other girls part-time to improvise
I knew she wasn’t bi, no, I seen it in her eyes
But I'm like any other guy, trying to get in her thighs
She telling me 'bout how black people should enterprise
And I'm like, if you don't get your ass in this ride from Enterprise
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by five
With the gas fully filled up like I didn't drive
Told her I had a girl, dog, fuck it, I didn't lie
Told her this rap game is alright, I'm just getting by
She had a lil' weed and we get a lil' high
And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving her vibe
Told me back in '95, she fell in love with the Tribe
Boo, back in '92, I was just like you
Please, don't be confused by the ice and jewels
I'm like any other nigga, buy ice to stay cool
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school
And think, ""Yeah, Free's banging but she's no Rachel""
[Chorus]
We ball 'til we fall, hit the mall
After we hit, don't call
We fill your lives with nothing but lies
And I would like to apologize
We ball 'til we fall, hit the mall
After we hit, don't call
We fill your lives with nothing but lies
And I would like to apologize
But you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is going to be alright
'Cause until the day a real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise

[Verse 2]
Was it something I did wrong? Yeah, I know I'm wrong
She's at home alone and I'm always gone
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive
Now she on the internet, looking for classes
Out of state though, man, that hurt, yo
But I got work though, and I'm at work, yo
And she don't call a lot
And when she do, she pouring out her heart
""You never listen to me,"" then the call drop, mm
And I promised her everything
Told her when I get a deal, I'll get her a wedding ring
But when I got my deal, I was back in the ring
Fighting my urges, strip club splurges
Never had money, so I felt like a virgin
And I'm trying to break the bank's cherry
Tryin' to see, can I afford Canaries
With a Ferrari and a dinner date with Halle Berry?
Went from fifty G's to fifteen hundred in a week
Now I'm trying to call
One ring, two rings, seven rings, eight rings
Her mother picked up the phone
Like, ""She in school and she don't stay here no more""
I guess there's more good women than men, percentage-wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
I guess that's why she says she ain't into guys
And focus on school full-time to improvise
[Chorus]
We ball 'til we fall, hit the mall
After we hit, don't call
We fill your lives with nothing but lies
So I would like to apologize
We ball 'til we fall, hit the mall
After we hit, don't call
We fill your lives with nothing but lies
And I would like to apologize
No, no, you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
'Cause until that real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise
You can't stand right here
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
'Cause until that real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise
You can't stand right here
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
'Cause until that real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise"

Spinning in Circles,Snibunny,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
Where do you turn when you're spinning in circles?
When anger and pain start to encircle?
You grit your teeth until your face turns purple
Lose what you love and run your life in the dirt fool!
You just gotta look up and figure it out
All before you start filling with doubt

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of this man, I'm tired of it all
Trying to get up now and all I do is fall
Back on my feet but my back's to the wall
Mind blocked like Tetris with tetanus locking my jaw
Got me bottoming out with time passing in crawl
Dark in a corner I lie, sit, and I bawl
Bells keep dinging it's an emotional brawl
I'm on me ripping and tearing
Staring and glaring, scaring myself
When I look in mirrors
That's me facing my fears
Jerking my tears
I hate that reflection that leers!
Especially the way that it peers
Deep in my soul
It pours outta this hole
It overflows into the rows
And no one knows
That I'm about to just hop off it
About to risk it all at a chance for no profit
I just can't stop it
Here, I'll hand you my heart just drop it
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Wow my head is spinning
And this is just the beginning
Thought is my little minion
Bouncing off my cranium
Bashing my brain
It's dense as uranium
My loss is my gain
I make it rain on them
While I'm progressing my grain
I gather strength from my pain
I guess I reap what what I sow
Here's a peep at my show
Picking them off 1 by 1
Catching tigers by the toe
I put them under the gun, I got my ducks in a row
Keep them in line like my exes, I tick I tack and I toe
So much stronger I grow
When I'm at my emotional low
So shoot me down
Plasterize my face with a frown
And make me cry
Run my fucking tear ducts dry
I want you! Look at me why!?
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Why you gotta drag me over here every night?
Away from me avoiding me and making me fight
It's like I'm losing you I'm starting to kite
Dancing all around in myself in hopes that I might
Stumble on a way to finally do something right
I feel so hopeless, copeless
No longer the dopest
Getting so hard now to coast this
All a sudden you roast this
Tension that's been building up between you and I
You tell me that you want me I'm your favorite guy
You've got me in your web now it's as easy as pie
And you're radiant, stealing my eye
I don't know why, I said I'll never be confused
I'd rather be gathered, beaten, battered, shattered and used
While you try to bore me and ignore leaving my confidence bruised
Everything I see you do, to me it's a ruse
Now you're my muse
Take a look at the clues
We need to be together, just look at how our chemistry brews"

[Verse 1]
So this is it, this is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it, fame to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different
But somethin' changed the minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffin' it
And it became my cocaine, I just couldn't quit
I just wanted a little bit, then it turned me to a monster
I became a hypocrite, concert after concert
I was rakin' in the dough, rollin' in green
Had the game hemmed up, like a sewing machine
But I was losing my freedom, there was nowhere for me
To not go and be seen, and just go and be me
And there was no in-between, you either loved it or hate it
Every CD critics gave it a three, then three
Years later they go back and re-rate it
Then called The Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just ain't passed yet
A couple more years, that shit'll be Illmatic
And eight years later, I'm still at it
Divorced, re-married, a felon, a father, sleeping pill addict
And this is real talk, I feel like The Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke and I can still walk
[Chorus]
So be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold
I said be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold

[Verse 2]
I got a letter from a fan that said he's been praying for me
Every day and for some reason
It's been weighing on my mind heavy
'Cause I don't read every letter I get
But something told me to go ahead and open it
But why would someone pray for you
When they don't know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals, I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at, I've already told you
At least a thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer but I've already got God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
Just watching it from a opposite standpoint
Man, boy's got to look
Nuts, and that's the only word I can think of
Right now, on how to describe the shit
This is like a vibe you get, go ahead and bop to it
Just watch what you wish for 'cause I got the shit
[Chorus]
So be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold
I said be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold"

Hey, yeah

They say anything's possible
You gotta dream like you never seen obstacles
Chasing obscene profits so we ain’t stopping for the red lights
Look in my rearview, all I see is niggas' headlights
Catch me if you can ho, they try and sack me and I scramble
Look up in the sky you’ll see exactly where I am bo
Hey, don’t you see me man?
Making my wishes come true with no genie man
I got the keys to my beamer with no Beenie Man
I’m on these rich niggas' ass, no bikini man
I bring the real to the day the Lord free me man
Never imagined that the kids would want to be me man
Ay, could it be I give the hopeless broke kids hope?
Caught me walking through the mall, looking like he seen a ghost
Simply had to approach, ""What's up youngblood?""
Ay, ain't it strange?
A year ago today, my nigga, I was counting change
Yeah, hopping trains up in New York City
Know I gotta thank God, 'cause if you weren’t with me
Then I surely woulda died, you can throw the fork in me
This my New Year's resolution, dawg, no more pork in me
Uh, I ain't no Muslim though
Caron Butler, I’m a wizard if ya doesn't know
It's Young Simba, yeah, I’m ballin’ 'til the buzzer blow
You's tryna kick the shit I kick, man you gon' stub your toe
Boy that's just how tough I go, see this is my light work
This shit y'all callin' classic, I be like, ""That might work""
Want you to feel something new, that's how a dyke work
They ask me 'bout pressure, they want to see my pipe burst
[Interlude]
Not tonight nigga
Ay, not tonight nigga
Yeah, hey
Man, man, hey

[Verse 2]
Man, I rap so vicious but I talk so politely
Never met a baby momma momma who don’t like me
Met a couple baby fathers though that wanna fight me
I hit it 'til she snooze like the news nigga, nightly
Send her back to you when she no longer excites me
Now she bitter with this nigga 'cause he ain't quite me
One thing's for certain baby girl, you are a wifey
Two things for fucking sure, I am not the husband though
So run back to him while you still can
He sticking with his wife and kid, yeah, that's a real man
I was ashamed all along and I still am
We let the lust interrupt something real, damn
Well girl we grown so you gotta play your own position
I wouldn’t say that you a ho, just made a ho decision
And you can blame it on the liquor like a prohibition
We both know that's what you wanted girl, I know you listenin'

[Interlude]
Hey
Girl, I know you listenin'
Uh, I know you listenin'
Hey, yeah
[Verse 3]
Shoutout to the bootleggers who supply my shit
The fans online tryna find my shit
And to them niggas listening but won't buy my shit
Then catch me in the street and wanna ride my dick
Y’all niggas is the worst, see me
Like, ""J. Cole homie, could you sign my burnt CD?""
Nigga please, a album ten dollars, you act like it’s ten Gs
This food for thought cost the same as two No. 3s
So at ease with that broke shit
We all tryna get a dollar boy, no shit
You know I feel your pain, therefore I slang this hope shit
And give you lines that you rewind and think, ""Oh shit""
These rappers talk a lot of money, cars and hoes shit
I give you that and then a whole lot more shit
That ""got rich and still rapping like I’m poor"" shit
You niggas think you know shit, man you don’t know shit

[Verse: MF DOOM]
Tripping off the beat kinda, dripping off the meat grinder
Heat niner, pimping, stripping, soft sweet minor
China was a neat signer, trouble with the script digits
Double dipped, bubble lipped, subtle lisp midget
Borderline schizo, sort of fine tits though
Pour the wine, whore to grind, quarter to nine, let's go
Ever since ten eleven, glad she made a brethren
Then it's last down, seven alligator seven
At the gates of heaven, knocking - no answer
Slow dancer, hopeless romancer, dopest flow stanzas
Yes, no? Villain, Metal face to Destro
Guess so, still incredible in escrow
Just say Ho! I'll test the yayo
Wild West style fest, y'all best to lay low
Hey bro, Day Glo, set the bet, pay dough
Before the cheddar get away, best to get Maaco
The worst hated God who perpetrated odd favors
Demonstrated in the perforated Rod Lavers
In all quad flavors, Lord save us
Still back in the game like Jack LaLanne
Think you know the name, don't rack your brain
On a fast track to half insane
Either in a slow beat or that the speed of ""Wrath of Kane""
Laughter, pain
Hackthoo'ing songs lit, in the booth, with the best host
Doing bong hits, on the roof in the west coast
He's at it again, mad at the pen
Glad that we win a tad fat, in a bad hat for men
Grind the cinnamon, Manhattan warmongers
You can find the villain in satin, kongas
The van screeches
The old man preaches about the gold sand beaches
The cold hand reaches for the old tan Ellesse's

Oh it i love,Hellogoodbye,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Oh,it is love from the first time I set my eyes upon yours thinking ""Oh, is it love?""

Oh,dear
It's been hardly a moment
And you are already missed
There is still a bit of your skin
That I've yet to have kissed
Oh say, please do not go
When you know, oh you know that I must
Oh say, I love you so
You know (oh) you, oh know you can trust
We'll be holding hands once again
All our broken plans I will mend
I will hold you tight so you know
It is love from the first
Time I pressed my hand to yours
Thinking, ""Oh, is it love?""

Oh,dear
Its been hardly three days yet
And I'm longing to feel your embrace
There are several days
Until I can see your sweet face
Oh say, wouldn't you like to be older and married with me?
Oh say, wouldn't it be nice to know right now that we'll be
Someday holding hands in the end
All our broken plans will have been
I will kiss you soft so you know
It is love from the first
Time I pressed my lips against yours
Thinking, ""Oh, is it love?""
Oh, your heart may long for love that is more near
So, when I'm gone these words will be here
To ease every fear
And dry up every tear
And make it very clear
I kiss you and I know
It is love from the first
Time I press my lips against yours
Thinking, ""Oh, is it love?""

And we're right here on a beautiful morning
In Cleveland, Ohio, and it's chilly today
The kids are going to school, the grass is frosty

(Theme song) In the morning
(To life) Hello Cleveland
(Hahah) Yeah

[Verse 1: Chip Tha Ripper]
A nigga like me be so gone
Eyes so low that a nigga gotta throw his locs on
""Wonder what them folks on?"" That's what they be askin'
Dumb kush we smokes on, smell it when a nigga passin'
We gettin' to the cash and, you can see a nigga shinin'
Just a little gold, a couple hoes, couple, two, three diamonds
Up in the hood where you find him
'Less he out on the road ('Less he out on the road)
Every show got a bag full of blow and Patron
All my niggas getting throwed like they 'posed to
Cause life is short and filled with lots of grief and doubt
So I just, pull that bag of colorful frosty leaves on out
And free my scalp, I need to free my mind a puff at a time
I'm up all the time, I'm up on the grind
So a Red Bull and a blunt would be fine
Just wanna feel fine, just wanna kill time
Just wanna relax and think of a rhyme
Don't really like sippin' cause I get to trippin'
My nigga, just roll up a heap of that pine
And only bring a little bit for the trip
Just in case we get blurped by 5-0
""Sir, you look high"", I know, but I prefer my eyes low

And we get higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
And we get higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
You know we get higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
You know we get higher, so higher
Oh-oh-oh, oh yeah, we get so high

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Yeah, they say, ""Easy friend""
There he go talkin' 'bout weed again
Probably cause of all that weed in him, yes and no
Cause and effect is what most don't know
Doing bad or like Mike said could be doing wrong
Forget about the obvious context of song
Put your brain where it belong
Can't we just all get a bong and tag along?
And we float, we kids with hope
Better to cope when you smoke
Dawg, please don't miss
What a nigga tryna get you thinking 'bout
We outside because my mama in the house
Puff-puff-pass with your bitch-ass
Back in high school, smoked weed when I cut class
And now I'm an addict, tragic, stay rolling up while reclining
I be looking down, see my Jesus piece shining
Good look, Yeezy, now I stay blinded by that light
Somebody pass me that shell to the right
Yes, I'm going, I'll be outtie, and you can find me
I'll be chilling back, I'll be chilling, Jack
Let's go

And we get higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
And we get higher, and higher

Uh, little homie, in the room
In-in the room, boy on the moon

Talk that shit to just my little homies
One year younger, they ain't get where I was going
Took a turn to the worse when my father left me lonely (Hmm)
Lonely in my room
I-I mean me, up on the moon
Entertained myself, laughed at myself
As I grew to be a teen, I disguised myself
Had the lowest self-esteem, especially with the girls
Tried every sport just to impress all the girls
Instead of all the ladies, 'cause they talked down
I was too artsy, known to be a clown (Hmm)

Made-made the move, flew off the moon
Still (Had no-no one) no one to hang out with
Talk that shit to just my Brooklyn niggas
All I would wonder is when will my time come
Had mad jobs and I lost damn near all of them
Thinkin' 'bout my bosses, yep I hated all of them
Studio at night had me hustlin' to most of them
Nigga, I was late damn near every day
But I'ma be on time when my stars align
When my soul was happy on my Ramen diet
Followed by a loosey, was the meal of grinders
If you knowin' the truth, all you think about is that thing
Always be a hater tryna shoot down any dream
Until you meet a kid like K-I
Niggas thought I was crazy, my mama know I stay high
We getting money, mom

This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world

And none of y'all had a clue about me
And none of y'all had a clue about me
And none of y'all really knew about me

To sell BJs 'til her mouth get raw
I'm from the California coast, beaches and bridges
Hit the cock, get ghost, I don't be sleeping with bitches

Bitch gon' ask me to come with her to grocery shop

And where your dude at? Should I serve him the news
And let him know he's finna be walking in some brand new shoes?
Ooh, you a fool, gotta watch thyself
One false move and can't stop thyself
Sometimes I'm not myself, I'm another man
I'm a rockstar, in another band
Plus, I'm the man with the plan in his hands
Soon, we all playing in sand
'Cause to my estimations and these calculations
And all the money I made off The Rompalation

Wearing the same kind of clothes, fucking the same kind of hoes
And you Bedrock pimping, meaning your game's kind of old
And you don't want it with me, I'll bother ya
So get lost, pal, before I clobber ya
I got golden gloves, I'll give you a new look
With a stiff left and a sharp right hook

Now that's what I call increasing the peace, I'm indecent a beast, your blood spilling is what recently
Leaked
To the streets your drug dealing is easily peaked, by high flying verbal missles better duck like you got a
Beak
Put you on hold like I got a beep, you're so boring when you're recording that your computer goes to sleep
But when I shut it down niggas sit there and laugh you couldn't categorize my paragraphs with a pair of
Graphs
My vocal cords hold swords like I wear a sash, you rappers sin nonchalantly yall ain't scared of wrath?
Well get prepared for the lyrical judgment the restoration comes after what happens first is the second
Coming
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got a flow like you wouldn't believe not a magician but I'm equipped with tricks that I put up my sleeve
As this ink stains a different form of wood off a tree, in bad grammar I wonder what rapper's gooder than me
Pardon my french cause better is better I make it rain young fella, so ask Rhianna for her umbrella
But it ain't capital gain it's a brainstorm, while you rap about your chain my style remains warm
The rap game now is a digital underground where everybody is downloading the same song
Since I sing a different song I wonder why I ain't on, but I still be saying that repetitively
I keep up with all others competitively, and there really ain't another rapper better than me
And there never will be another verbal endeavors with the vendetta to put words together consecutively"

Ma say my fit go, I tell that ho stop it
Then get back to floating, Life ain't nothing but a never ending drop kick
From the streets where it's no Gi but we chop bricks
Food for thought but ciao mayne
Holler of you need some chop sticks
Sac I got this
[Verse 2}
Now what's messing with that?
Boy jams so deaf fuck a vest and a Gat
Still riding dirty but no point in mentioning that
Pulling up on the scene looking clean as Benjamin Bratt
Where the Benjamins at, next question in fact
Where the lesbians at, yeah business gets messy like that
So I tell 'em bring 100 of each when these janky ass promoters trying to get me to rap
I don't need a part two to Elvis Presley and blacks
Giving up styles for free so the shit can get snatched
Before that happens Illy gon' be dressed in all black
And on somebody's line niggas will get slept with a smack, smell that
They said I couldn't do it
I wonder what they finna say the day the boy prove it
I bet my writing hand you'll be all up in the stands
Standing by my biggest fans singing this theme music, yeah"

Yeah, woah-woah, haha
Yeah
My name is Scott Mescudi, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Gotta get it through my thick head
I was so close to being dead, yeah
Life, live it, with nobody's help tips
Man, I'm just walking without being led
See the world is so crazy and filled with such risk and man
I just know I gotta dodge them, yeah
The beginning is always followed by an end
In the in-between time I'm not runnin' or hidin'

[Pre-Chorus]
See things do come around
And make sense eventually
Things do come around
But some things trouble me
[Chorus]
The people I've met and the places I've been
Are all what make me the man I so proudly am
But I wanna know one thing
When did I become a ghost?
I'm most confused about the world I live in
You think that I'm lonely, well I probably am
One thing that still gets me
When did I become a ghost?
Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, woah-woah, haha, yay
Yeah, whoa, whoa-whoa, yoo

[Verse 2]
Tried to fight it, but soon that gave in
Went down a road with no lights on
Can't describe it, and you don't move like them
You become their worst nightmare
You remember the things that your parents had said and well
Rather find out the hard way
You should tell a friend to tell a friend to tell a friend
I keep with my stroll, I'm not runnin' or hidin'

[Pre-Chorus]
See things do come around
And make sense eventually
Things do come around
But some things still trouble me

The people I've met and the places I've been
Are all what make me the man I so proudly am

When did I become a ghost?

What if my twins ask me why I ain't marry their mom? (Why?)
Damn, how do I respond?

Whenever it comes on, it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop (We won't stop)

War Lab, call us haters all you want

[Verse 1: Kuniva]
Fuck it, call me a hater, full blown instigator
Leavin niggas on intubators breathin like Darth Vader
I hate people that pack guns but they don't bust 'em
Or bitches that come back to my room but they ain't fuckin
Pistol clutching, the Dozen, you heard it don't get is misconstrued
Whatever we do'll hit the news once we get the tools

If you’re an MC and you mention my name in the wrong way, you draw first blood, I’m gonna come at you""

[Verse 2: Canibus]
You pushed D12 to the side to sign Voltron 5
If Proof was alive, he'd be dyin' inside
You ain't no hip-hop messiah, you a bitch 'cause you dissed Mariah
Shit like that supposed to be private
I'ma fry you on behalf on Mariah and Michael
Put you back on them drugs, make you suicidal
You can't shut the record down, nigga it's viral
When you use the word ""nigga,"" just remember your idols
[Verse 3: DZK]
I got a question, I'm white, can I join D12?
I'll sell you four million records then I'll tell you go to hell
Leave Swifty in charge, then remove all the stars
And make the group wish Bizarre shot pool in a bar
An assault lawyer stop the beat, suing us all
I really do hope you know who get involved
Cause I'm a fan and I'll get you for a Nick Cannon dissin'
And you already know how fuckin' sick Canibus is

[Verse 4: Swifty]
I hate a bitch-ass nigga just as much as I hate fags
I love goin' to war but I hate when they raise the flag
These niggas hittin' the streets spittin' venom on me
Then start renegin' the beef, I hate peace treaties
Forever yo' enemy I increase beef as Amityville's finest
Cause I don't believe in stoppin' violence
I'm a tyrant that'll snatch my respect and scram
I use a Uzi cause I hate a Tec when it jams
I hate when dudes treat this like life a movie
Usin' rap as his excuse to do shit and they only move keys in the booth
I piss on niggas hands, whoever's grown, patches and tombstones
I hate 'em ass when I break into a home
I'm barefaced, I clap your cat, ransack it
That's what I'm wearin' black and I hate goin' out the back
So call me a hater, walkin' detonator, I ain't afraid
To stick this blade into your fade in front of spectators
[Interlude]
You're an emcee, big small it doesn't matter
No matter how big I get, I just want people to know

[Verse 5: Canibus]
You the devil in a red dress on MTV
You signed more black people than a basketball team
What you trying to say subconsciously? You can't rock the beat like me
Consciously, you know I rock you to sleep
Slim Shady you a coward 'cause you scared to rap with me
The only black man you respect is 50
And the greatest rapper of all time was dead right and dead wrong
You shouldn't have even been on that song

[Verse 6: DZK]
He fell off so hard this faggot broke his accent
I'm flippin through the channels seein Bruno get his ass sniffed
And I'm disgusted man, what the fuck is wrong with you?
Why'd you date Mariah? Mariah's not a fuckin' dude
You never even saw her nude and you busted, too
Must have been thinkin 'bout your stepdad touchin' you
But that ain't nothin new, I asked your ugly crew
They verified it, so bitch quit lyin'

[Verse 7: Canibus]
I remember the first time we met, I ain't even liked you
Walkin' around my video set like you was in high school
It must excite you seeing black people being tribal
That's why Dr. Dre signed you
I bet you right now you got a big rotten Rosenberg beside you
Trying to be just like your father, inside you
Your Stan android fanboys need to kill that noise
I know what you thinking, ""kill that boy""
[Verse 8: DZK]
We leavin' Elvis funny money makin' pelvis shattered
Let's see you square dance now, let's see you hold your bladder
Let's see you fire back Em where's the fire at it?
Suicide hotline time, go dial that
Put on that ""8 Mile"" hat and write a vile track
Get at some people that can actually diss you back
No more target practice on retarded actors
And pop stars, Marshall you're not hard

Renegade Schemenegade, you pink like lemonade
I've been better than you before Genesis was made
You ain't better than Black Thought, you ain't better than Mos Def
You ain't better than Canibus, Professor Griff, Hotep
So Renegade Schemenegade, you pink like lemonade
I penetrate through Halley's Comet with metal blades
Yeah! You and I both know why I'm saying this
I hope Whoo Kid get fired for playing this

Get off, Nikolai Volkoff, mazel tov
Ready to show off, fo'-fo'll blow your do' off
Blowin off steam, goin off the beam

Bitch I'm the king, color me bad
Skinny jeans, what happened to the sag? You makin' me mad

Some underworld spy or the wife of a close friend
Wife of a close friend, and

Let me tell y'all a lil' story about myself
This right here is a true story, check it out though, uhh...

[Verse 1]
Ulcers hurt my salary, alter my personality
Give it to you real, I can't feed my culture no fallacy
You know my attitude: arrogant, cocky, rude
Eating off papi food, used to be a stocky dude
Weighed two-twenty, with two honeys, I move money
It's true dummy, dunny need a new tummy
I become berserk, it was no fun to work
Every day my stomach hurt, ripping off my undershirt
The pain was no comparison, stomach started cherishing
Throwing up in public, yo fuck it, it was embarrassing
Regurgitating: green, yellow, burgundy, boom
But came my urgency soon, (what) the emergency room (oh)
In there, no salvage, treated like a cold savage
They said pimping symptoms, huh, a dope addict
There you have it, but they ain't find no heroin
Coke, crack, dope, just weed, but that's my medicine
[Chorus]
My baby mama, mama, and my grandma
Say that I'm too gaudy (too gaudy), word to my blue Mauris
This is a true story
I got stomach pain, don't matter sun or rain
Thought that it went away, uh oh, here it come again

[Verse 2]
Never mind stunting, dime puffin, doc spent his time fronting
He like a bad detective, he ain't find nothing
Besides that though, I can't enjoy a movie dinner (why is that?)
My son growing up, I'm looking like the movie Thinner
I'm thinking suicide, do or die, sit and cry (oh)
What hurt my baby moms asking if I'm getting high
She gonna play me a thug, I told the lady I love
If it ain't hustling ma, please don't relate me to drugs (at all)
I'm losing weight though, every day pounds of muscle
Gotta get off my ass, hit some towns and hustle
Bein sick, huh, it get sickening you know
I was too sick to do shows, but still equipped to move O's
You know my attitude, get it how I get it
If I can shoot, I turn around (then) I'm off my pivot
And oops, I thought I had it mapped
Weight started to gain again, it was just a game my friend
Dame mane I pained again

My baby mama, mama, and my grandma

Killa!
Ayo, god body, I'm hard bodied, word mommy, vanishing
Had to go low, The Mayo Clinic, Minnesota
I couldn't get cake, a rock in a hard place
For me, that's a odd place, I'm only here by God's grace
Like a lab rat, them tests dishonor Cam
Ultrasound, MIR, CAT scan, sonogram
Laparoscopy, endoscopy, I be stressed (I be stressed)
The prognosis, diagnosed, IBS
And that's irritable bowel child, I had to spit it y'all
Kick to y'all, so it ain't my fault if I shit on y'all
Get it, get it, get it, get it?

But fourteen grams, oh man I made a killing
On the fifteenth the welfare check dropped
So it popped like the sixteens sitting in my Glock
Seventeen years old with the coliseum fronts
In the back way with like eighteen blunts
It was nineteen, I forgot the year but it was on
Cause dimes went out of style and the twenties came along
Twenty-one dollar E&Js with my crew
Cracks in my ass and the grands are twenty-two
Twenty-three on my jersey, Nikes on my feet
On the twenty-fourth bus tryna write to a beat
Locked the game like twenty-five to life at twenty-six
Twenty-seven gave you The Brick, at twenty-eight I give you this nigga

Simple mathematics y'all"

You heard of Salt N' Pepa? Well girl, you food
Girl, you hot like a bowl of hot stew
And I just stood over ma stew and just blew
And when there's no more of you, in the soup
I remove ma spoon and drink your juice
If you want to do me, do what cha wanna do
And if her job is to blow, you can bet she blew
Mic check 1, 2, how about 1, 2
P-L-A-Y because I don't have a clue
But when I find out, I'm a show and tell you
When I lift my top lip, I could still smell you
When I swallow ma spit, I could still taste you
Put that pussy in ma face every time I face you

Nigga, I'm tired of these niggas barkin' that shit, talkin' that shit

Holdin' a gat, ain't gonna bust and know that
It's a Dub-S-C thang, W.C. brain

Un-fucking-believable! Lil Wayne's the president
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, even if they celibate
I know the game is crazy, it's more crazy than it's ever been
I'm married to that crazy bitch; call me Kevin Federline
It's obvious that he'll be Cash Money 'til the death of him
The ground shall break when they bury him—bury him?
I know one day they got to bury him
Better lock my casket tight, baby, so I don't let the Devil in
People, it's just me and my guitar

Somebody tell me what's happened to me

The country bud got me chokin'
I'm on a mission to the point that motherfuckers think I'm smokin'
Yeah, that sick nigga Biggie with the 8-shot fifth
With the extra clip for that extra shit
Don't you know that a killing is thrilling?
All the blood spilling is all a part of drug dealing
A born gangsta, my daddy was a thug
Had a .38 with the hollow point slug
So when he licked shots, niggas dropped
Quicker than a bootlegger sells his liquor
A little nigga tried to squeeze .22's in my Reebok shoes
Payin' dues, while kids was on their one's and two's, huh
Now I'm much older, colder, fuck a holster
Got the MAC-11 swingin' from my shoulder
It's a damn shame I got to put my momma through the strain
I'm livin' in the house of pain

Is anybody listenin'?
Tell me, can you can see this darkness surrounding me?
Nights gettin' colder, heavy on my shoulder
And it's gettin' hard to breathe

When you're livin' in the house of pain

Do you have the heart to see a nigga, before you bust?

Bustin' motherfuckers out the box, I ain't even go!
Now how the hell do you explain my claim to fame?
From doin' flicks to bustin' tricks out the fuckin' frame
Got these bitches on my jock, niggas on my block
Jealous ass suckers got 'em duckin' from my smokin' Glock
And bustin' niggas asses to stay alive
Skinny ass player watchin' bigger motherfuckers fry
They ask me how I'm livin', high, I'm a hustler
Buckin' busters 'til they die
Now it's on in the ghetto, you ain't heard?
Niggas got they AK's headin' for the 'burbs
Aimin' at them skinhead bitches, let it rain
Givin' 'em a wet welcome to the House of Pain

Wendy Williams say I stayed dusted, maybe I should
'Cause these rappers'll have your phone tapped like Savion Glove'
And on the West, yo, police corrupt, some are Bloods
But these Teflons I loaded explodin' some mugs
I'm like Furious in Boyz n the Hood, but at the drive-thru
I ain't runnin', I'm dumpin', crazy like a Piru
And loc'd up, know how Nas do
I'm callin' Henchmen and Concepcion, to organize a black truce
Then we party hard, party with Nas
Since there ain't no more - Mardi Gras
And Bush won't apologize
I got gangsta hoes Kobe Bryant scared to sodomize

Burn You Alive,Army of the Pharaohs,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]

This is the night I’m burning you alive
Right here and no one will hear your cries of fear
This is the night where I’m sure of your demise in my head
And I will be here to watch you die in fear

Live your life by a prayer, are you there, and do you care?
And I don’t care

[Verse 1]

You either a mark or a killer, me I’m as sharp as a splinter
As cold and harsh as the winters in the heart of December
My limericks ain’t hard to remember but harder to figure
I leave your carcass disfigured, dismembered then carve out your liver
And vital organs, rigor mortis, your corpse is
Niggas hard to record this
I’m thought-provoking with the logic of Vulcans
I’m not into sulking but soaking the bitch
I’m at sea with the sharks in the moat
And see if his princess carcass can float
Hearts will get broke, haunted by ghosts
The same old G in this game homie
Still bringing the pain like Sugar Shane Mosley
And you will light a candle to say a prayer
And cry in fear but you still die and I won’t care
[Verse 2]

Ain’t nobody dope as me
Unless you find him in the ill AOTP
So let the sinsemil no seeds, purple hairs blow
Xans in the tuck ? for the weirdos
Shake makes a lot so he’s letting his beard grow
His father gave his lessons over eighty-four years old
You can’t out-slick a fox with his own tricks
The barrel got spit same time that the chrome kicks
Your block’s hurting, niggas hoping to score soon
Fighting a case on Facebook and the courtroom
Can’t provide a dozen so we gonna need more room
Faggots still bugging so they gonna need more tombs

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

The more you sweat in peace time the less you bleed in war
I’m strapped with the four-pound cocked at the demon’s door
I ain’t trying to talk it out, it ain’t peace at all
I just pull them four-fours out when the Reaper call
Osama Vin Laden been rotten, walking strong
I’m hitting harder and smarter than a Sri Lankan bomb
I’m still using the weaponry that I copped at Nam
I’m still using telepathy from the father’s palm
It’s wild hard to explain what I do to rats
The hollow tips will have y’all dancing like Scoob and Scrap
Fuck a fair one, I let the Ruger clap
Now you rock an eyepatch like Ricky the Ruler’s back
[Verse 4]

It’s hot in the winter, cold in the summer, nigga the slumber
Overpower the thunder clap, y’all niggas going under
I cover the fort, hold down the team for sport
We need dope so Nixon get the fuck out of court
Yo block, we need the block sewed up and locked
Tell Maserati to shut down, the city is hot
Paz got the Glock, Planetary don’t stop
And it's nothin to malfunction your dungeon to rot
I’m something to watch, sort of like American Idol
I’m sheisty, that’s why I never swear on the Bible
I came to heal the sick and raise the dead
Cast out all the demons and introduce the plague

Got the haters fired up and ya wondering how
Yall use to make fun of me, but now your like wow

Went from mike drop the mic, to ""wow were so proud""
From your lyrics are wak to ""wow look at that crowd""

They said keep it a hobby, cause ya never gunna fly

But I'm standing here bitch, and I refuse to lye

He told 'em they flows is bitch talk and ayo's
His whole crew walk with pitchfork and halos
Say, ho, if you never worked a J-O
And keep more cash in the stash than a peso
Okay, yo, y'all know who to follow
Tie 'em up in the crib and leave they place hollow
Oh, shoot, the goose is loose
So wild you couldn't chase it down with straight fruit juice
Frown like the first time you taste cous cous
Stash the deuce deuce, troops asking ""truce, truce""
Today on intense wreck week
We have the super villain in his own defense to speak
It's all part of my mental techniques
Available to freaks and pencil neck geeks
Train a sane brain to an insane train of thought
On a campaign trail he came to gain your support
Charge cash for a autograph
Say some shit to make your daughter laugh then slaughter the ass
See 'em on the big screen like Steve McQueen
Do something and never be back once he leaves the scene
Keep more medicated pads than Stridex
For his own side wreck with no known side effects
Before you press charges use your noodle
So what when he grab the mic he crush your cute cuticles
Keep your mouth shut, everything will be beautiful
It would be awfully rude to you, now get back to your hooty hoo
Damn it, it ain't worth the drama, can it
From the calm bandit eat rhymers like pomegranate
Soon as he stepped in, he lit the room
Boom, reschedule my noon with Brit Hume
(Doom!) In love with Mary Jane, she's my main thing
Pulled her right from that web head, what a lame brain
Maintain and say it, don't spray it
You wanna see your girl again, you might as well pay it
If I had a dime for every rhymer that bust guns
I'll have a cool mil' for my sons in trust funds
When I was broker than a broke dick dog
I always kept a L to smoke in thick fog
When it rain, it sure do thunderstorm
I got more rhymes in the summer than musty underarms
One, two, microphone checker
First learned to neck off a Home Ec homewrecker
This is back when he was like crib age
When he hit the stage, it's like a gauge to the rib cage
Break the mic like a rock star break a guitar
And jump off the stage like ""Yee haw!""
[Outro Skit]
(UN leader): We shall now vote for a new world leader. I nominate, DOOM. All in favor, say Aye
(Delegates (In unison)): Aye!
(Peter Parker): Oh no
(DOOM): DOOM, is master of the world

(Voice 1): We must hurry
(Voice 2): Wait! If you are really with us, prove it. Let me hear you say it. Tell me that DOOM is a tyrant and must be overthrown
(Voice 1): I-I have spent my life
(Voice 2): Say it! You have spent your life serving a tyrant. DOOM must be stopped
(Voice 1): I fear you're right, my friend

(DOOM Cronie): The President of the United States is on the phone
(DOOM): Mr. President, you're at the mercy of your deadliest enemy
(President): It is time you learned once and for all, DOOM. The United States does not barter with terrorists
(DOOM): You never learn, do you?

(Voice 1): Here, this is the address of friends in New York. They'll help"

No, fuck the bitches, fuck all the stank-ass hoes

Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique, Gucci Don, you know how we play
Fuckin' scandalous-ass bitches
You know how it go, Gooch
I meet a bitch, fuck a bitch
Next thing you know, you fuckin' a bitch
You just pass around shit, pass the shit like a cold and shit
Fuck 'em

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G. & Lil' Kim]
Now when I'm fucking off gin I'm invincible
Don't love no ho, that's my principle
'Cause, uh, bitches come (And uh) bitches go (Uh)
That's why I get my nut and I be out the fucking door (You know)
They might be the one to set me up
Want to get they little brother to wet me up
That's why I tote TECs and stuff, to get them off my case
Just in case the little fucker ends up misplaced
I don't give a bitch enough to catch the bus
And when I see the semen I'm leaving
Bitches be scheming, I kid you not
That's why I keep my windows locked and my Glock cocked
One ho said, Big, why you so hard on us?
Why you swear all bitches are so scandalous?
Thug nigga 'til the end, tell a friend, bitch
'Cause when I like you, then you go and fuck my friend, bitch
And you know that ain't right

You know that ain't right with a friend of mine

You see, I don't sweat these hoes
I keep them in flavors like Timbos and Girbauds
Bitches just like to play the merry-go
Yeah we know, drop the scenario
It was me, Dee, the MPV
The blunts and brew thang, knocking some Wu-tang
M-E-T-H-Oh shit, look at them lips and them hips on that bitch
Dee hit the dip, so I can drop my mackadocious shit
Light the blunt clip and recognize a pimp
Needless to speak, the G's obsolete
Don't sleep, banged the skins in a week
On the creep up the avenue
I seen her on the block, who she rapping to?
That's my nigga Dee, damn he got G
Now she fucking him and fucking me, see
You know that ain't right

You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine, uh
[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Now I play her far like a moon play a star
She still sweat me hard 'cause I'm a rap star
I be cruising up the block, I be passing her
Pimping hard with a female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, scheming on a gangbang
She should have used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's saying I dissed her 'cause I'm fucking her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets 'em pissed, uh
But she started that fucking family
She fucked my man Dee, so why she mad at me? (True)
Plus your sister look better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
So break the fuck out like a rash
I'm glad I ain't spend no cash to hit your nasty ass

You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine"

Shootouts,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Trackmasters]

[Verse 1]
Yo, release what's in me
Besides the Henny, it's eyes that's seen plenty
Fiends get skinny as if Queens was a Craig Jenny
Instead of diet plans, it's crack, 200 grams
I pump a G-pack, peepin' for where the D's at
It's slow, lookin' for Rambo
The cop who got grazed back in the days
Chasin' niggas through my project maze
That cop — he got a death wish
He run behind niggas until you breathless
Everyday, he makin' ten arrests, shit!
My nigga, check this, I know the bitch he rest with
I even blessed it, forty-dash-ten, inspect it
(Already checked it, dunn, near his ankle you could see his gun)
Peep, he parked his Jeep in the back of the slum
To check Tanisha, fat ass, real fly with the blonde caesar
Vittadini summer gear, she push the two-seater
I heard she brag about the way he eat her
A Irish man, short, slim with a tan, they say he laced her cheeba
She due, be lookin' weaker, now her teeth are foul
Speakin' loud, peep her style, in and out of every reefer cloud
Fat ass dissolvin', like cotton candy in a mouth that's starvin'
Rock the same gear daily, like a soldier in my squadron
I heard she let Jake investigate from her window
'Cause she's a nympho, suckin' dick and coughin' up info
So now it's set up, her and the beast to get wet up
I know he's vest up, we blazin' from the neck up
(Yo, let me knock first) Soon as he open, let your Glock burst
They had the chains on, son, hit the lock first
We busted in, the cop jerked, Jungle popped one in his shirt
I grabbed the bitch by her tits, she tried to say she Earth
We saw the cameras, tape recorders and the monitors
They eyein' us, (Nas, yo, he survived one from the fo'-five)
Pull his shades down, they seen his last days now
There's no way now, we can be treated just like a slave now
Two in the dome, he's laid down
A-yo, the bitch is saved now
She's livin' in a snitch grave now
[Chorus]
Shootouts is similar to Wild West
Broad daylight, face-to-face without a vest
You know the episodes, thugs camouflage the spectacles
Please God, just save the life that the Devil sold
See, It Was Written, but was never told
Peep the jewels, black man, it's even better than gold
Niggas roll with iron
Police roll in hot pursuit, tryin' to stop the loot
Fuck Jake, cock and shoot

[Verse 2]
Still on the streets with my peeps so deep
We threw a block party for my man goin' up creek
To do his two-to-four, niggas show love from all around the board
Peace, Lord, Sony Handy-Cam on record
Pop a bottle, 'cause when you come home, we still got it sewn
We can watch the tape, play back and just zone
Film all the bitches, on the benches with ill extensions
We block the streets off, only crew cars can enter
Music was loud and it was crowded
Barbecued wings, we fed the fiends
(Gamble in the back!) Killa shouted
And Frank tried to stop the bank, lost about what a Roley cost
Guzzled his drink, and staggered off
He's a Big Will, used to slang krill, now he own The Hill
Couldn't take losin' his cash, and I could feel
Something in the air, yeah
Frank returned with Pierre
A gunslinger, who niggas hadn't seen in a year
I usually be holdin', 'specially this type of weekend
And everyone except for me had started reachin'
They had gats in each others faces
With kids and grandmothers around
Frank's only concern was his papers
My man Killa let off, half of them fake niggas jet off
Police blitz quick, waitin' for that to set off
Runnin' the static, it got me mad 'cause they a bunch of faggots
Startin' shit in my hood, I can't have it
Yo, High, get the 40-Cali stainless
Jake is still out, let's make it real and still make 'em niggas famous
Dip behind trees in fatigues and squeeze, dodge and weave
Hearin' Jake retaliatin', and Wiz was up the alley waitin'
We breeze, jump in the ride, heard Pierre died
Internal bleedin' inside, and ain't been back since '95
[Chorus]
Shootouts is similar to Wild West
Broad daylight, face-to-face without a vest
You know the episodes, thugs camouflage the spectacles
Please God, just save the life that the Devil sold

Peep the jewels, black man, it's even better than gold

Uh oh-oh-oh, check me out, let's get it

[Verse 1: Usher]
Baby, how you doing? Hope that you're fine
Want to know what you got in mind and I
Got me feenin' like Jodeci, girl I can't leave you alone
Take a shot of this here Patrón and it's gon' be on
V.I.P done got way too crowded
I'm about to end up calling it a night
She should holla at your girl, tell her that you're shaking the scene
Pulled off, beep beep, shotgun in the GT with me
She said, ""Ohhhh! I'm ready to ride""
(I was like) Yeah
'Cause once you get inside, you can't change your mind
Don't mean to sound impatient but you gotta promise baby, oh!
[Chorus: Usher & Ludacris]
Tell me again (Tell me again, my baby)
That we'll be lovers and friends (Oh, I gotta know baby, oh yeah)
Tell me again (Make sure you're right, oh before we begin)
That we'll be lovers and friends (Oh, oh it's a good look baby)
It's a really good look baby, look here

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Sometime wanna be your lover, sometime wanna be your friend
Sometime wanna hug you
Hold hands, slow dance while the record spins
Opened up your heart
'Cause you said I made you feel so comfortable
Used to play back then now you all grown up like Rudy Huxtable
I could be your Bud, you could beat me up
Play fight in the dark then we both make up
I do, anything just to feel yo' butt
Why you, got me so messed up?
I don't know but you gotta stop tripping
Be a good girl, now turn around and get these whippings
You know you like it like that
You don't have to fight back, here's a pillow, bite that
And I'll be setting separate plays
So on all these separate days, your legs can go they separate ways

[Chorus: Usher]
Tell me again (Tell me again my baby)
That we'll be lovers and friends (Oh, it's a good look baby)
Tell me again (Tell me over and over and over again)
That we'll be lovers and friends (Make sure you're right before you choose)
[Verse 3: Lil' Jon]
I's been knowing you for a long time (Shawty)
But fucking never crossed my mind (Shawty)
But tonight I seen something in you (Shawty)
That made me wanna get with you (Shawty)
You ain't been nothing but a friend to me (Shawty)
And a nigga never ever dreamed we'd be (Shawty)
Up in here kissing, hugging, squeezing, touching (Shawty)
Up in the bathtub rub-a-dubbing (Shawty)
Are you sure you wanna go this route (Shawty)
Let a nigga know before I pull it out (Shawty)
I would never ever cross the line (Shawty)
Shawty let me hear you tell me one more time
One more time

[Chorus: Usher]
Tell me again (Tell me again my baby)

Befo' I came up in the game these hoes didn't show no love

They see that I'm a star, now they wanna sit in my car
Now they wanna count my cheese, smoke my weed and sip my barre now
They used to love to me diss me, now they rush to hug and kiss me now
They tellin' all they friends when I leave how they miss me now

And I ain't trippin' cause my pockets stick out mo' than my belly
They know I'm paid, livin' laid in the shade
Two slabs in the Escalade with fo' or five estates

You know we had to do a remix, right?

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
Ugh! Ugh!
Niggas is mad I get more butt than ashtrays (Yeah)
Fuck a fair one, I get mine the fast way
Ski mask way, nigga, ransom notes (Ugh)
Far from handsome, but damn, a nigga tote (What you tote?)
More guns than roses, foes is shaking in their boots
Invisible bully, like The Gooch
Disappear, vamoose, you're wack to me (Ugh)
Take them rhymes back to the factory
I see, the gimmicks, the wack lyrics
The shit is depressing, pathetic, please forget it (Ugh)
You're mad 'cause my style you're admiring
Don't be mad, UPS is hiring (Woo!)
You should've been a cop, fuck hip-hop
With that freestyle, you're bound to get shot (Ugh)
Not from Houston but I Rap-A-Lot (Uh-huh)
Pack the gat a lot (Uh-huh), the flav's 'bout to drop, ugh
[Chorus: Craig Mack]
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kicking new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand-new flava in ya ear
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear (Ahh, here comes the Mack!)

[Verse 2: Craig Mack]
Word up, no rap, no crap, you bore me (Remix)
Wanna grab my dick, too lazy, hold it for me (Ugh)
I'm straight, rap great, busting heads, straighten dreads
I'm everlasting (What?), like the toe on Pro-Keds
A Tec-9 when I rhyme; plus, I climb
Word is bond, your album couldn't fuck with one line
It's been three years since you last hear
But now, I reappear, your heart pumps fear
To your gut (What?), did your girl's butt (Ha)
I scraped it, shaped it, now, she won't strut (Haha)
I smash teeth, fuck your beef, no relief
I step on stage, girls scream like I'm Keith (*Haaaa*)
You won't be around next year (No, you won't)
My raps too severe, kicking mad flava in ya ear

[Chorus: Craig Mack]
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear

[Verse 3: Rampage]
21, '94, mad motherfucking hardcore
It's my time to burn, now, explore
The flava in ya ear, it's The Boy Scout
I make outs, I make other rappers have doubts (That's right)
You're fucking with the wrong clan and the wrong man
That's it, now you got to get your dome split (Rock on)
I'm going into my knapsack with my gat
Take off my hat, guess I'm just cool like that
The dangerous, the ruggedness, from the Flatbush abyss (Ugh)
BLS, 97, KISS, bounce to this
I'm gonna live long in this rap game, niggas know my name
Yo, Puffy! (Burn 'em in the flames)

[Interlude: Puff Daddy]
You're jingling, baby (Go 'head, Daddy)
You're jingling, baby (Go 'head, Daddy)

Hee-shee! Ugh, blow-ticious
Skeevy (Mmm), delicious
Gimme couscous, love me good
Mmm, damn! Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good?
I guess like the jeans, ugh!
Flavor like praline, sick, daddy, yah'mean?
Papa love it, when he does it (That's right)
Niggas buzz it
But tell me, was it really just the flavor that be clogging your ears?
The most healthy behavior is to stay in the clear (Ugh)
It's all for you, it's really all for you (Now what?)
Hunchback, close your eyes, try to munch that
Oil up your ankles, let your Timbs tap
Bite the flavor, it reacts to your gold caps
Word to Mama, I tongue-kiss a piranha
Electrocute a barracuda, I'm here to bring the drama
[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Yo! Yo! Yo! Flavors in your ass crease, ha!
Busta Rhymes about to bring the noise, so cease, ha
Let me loose from the belly of the beast, ha
Everybody!
Hey, hey, hey! You better believe it's Busta Rhymes, the great
We 'bout to rip the Tri-State, yo, yo
Hey, hey, hey! I'll split your face and give you stitches
Throw niggas in ditches, slap the ass of fat bitches
Wait one sec, as I get down
I'm rolling with the heavyweight connect to the stomping ground
Now, don't you get suspicious, I grant your wishes every time (Ha)
Bring it vicious when I bust a rhyme (Word is bond)
I know one thing the whole world least expected
Is how we all connected (Ha) to break food on the same record
Five new flavors on beat, feel the fucking heat (Whoa)
I really think you should retreat while we blow up the street (Hey)
Instead of copping pleas, just freeze (Ha)
Maintain the focus while we smoke these marijuana trees
When I get down, I disappear, reappear
And blow up everywhere (Ha!), fucking with these flavors in ya ear

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kicking new flava in ya ear

Who? Mike Jones - who, Mike Jones, who Mike Jones
Geyeah! Holla at your boy
Y'all know my cell phone number, geyeah!

Everyday I stay on my grind, and I hold it down 'til I'm not around
I mash for cash so I can eat, I grind so much that I hardly sleep
I'm pimpin the game, grippin the grain, under 25, gettin this change
A CEO at twenty-fo', holdin it down for that Texas mayne
Mike Jones, Nicole Wray, we stay on the grind, we don't play
In Fila {?} forever stay, puttin it down, for that pay
It's a man's world, that's what they say
But I think girls get {shit} they way
But who am I to argue and bust
I don't give a {fuck} you can kiss my nuts
I'm steppin out, hoppin in my Lo
Grippin on grain, tippin on Vogues
""Who is Mike Jones?"" finally here, so go and pick it up out the sto'
I said - I'm steppin out, hoppin in my Lo
Grippin on grain, tippin on Vogues
""Who is Mike Jones?"" finally here, so go and pick it up out yo' sto'
[Hook: Nicole Wray]
It takes a lot to be in a man's world
Believe it or not, I'm runnin for my girls
Holdin it down, ridin through yo' block
And if you get hot, I show 'em what I got
It's a man's world.. it's a man's world
It's a man's world.. but it wouldn't be nothin without me and my girls

[Nicole Wray]
Baby girl was workin real hard nine to five
Boss man came through, told her come inside
Said he didn't need her service no more
And everything she worked hard for out the door
First thing she did is thought about the kids
And how to pay the bills and keep food in the fridge
She said, ""No! This ain't right!"" Looked at him and said
""It's a cool world, and I'm destined for greatness""

[Hook]

[Nicole Wray]
It's a man's world.. it's a man's world
It's a man's world.. but it wouldn't be nothin without me and my girls

Couple years later, see the girl doin fine
Big ol' house and bright diamonds that shine
Drove by the old job, seen the old boss
Splashed water in his face, music loud and drove off
See what he ain't know, baby girl was gifted
Tried to hold her down, hold her back but he missed it
She's her own boss now, she stay gettin lifted
Party hard with her friends, stuntin on the fakers
Y'all ain't never seen no face like this
Bass like this, haze like this
Y'all ain't never seen no cash like this
Floss like this, boss like this - this is what she say to y'all
Y'all ain't never seen no face like this
Bass like this, haze like this

And I can see the world right through her bedroom walls
She has a jaw like a pelican's beak is deep
Humming me right to sleep, my favorite freak
I can rearrange the patterns of the stars in the sky
I can fly with the seagulls on the beach with the tide
Cause she can blow me there, I swear, right through the air

To have her hum in performance, the show is enormous

[Verse 1]
I don't give a shit about celebrity
But motherfuckers did ya happen to see who's here? Me
The bottom feeder at the top of the food chain
Frontin' from the back of the line on some dude named
After car parts that as fast as a spark hitting gas
Starts a fire gets wired from barbs that
Cut like a jalapeño popper fart
Burnin up an asshole that once ripped apart
Punched hard but it ain't like I ever cared if I went
Too far as stitches left scars from more clowns bent
Outta shape than the Cirque du Soleil ever had so
Though he throws his weight around he's still in my shadow
In the dark so he doesn't know his girl remarked that I make her
Laugh on the inside but I can hear it later
With my dick as her other cunt gets screwed
In the process I got to get hot chicks nude

Thanks to you bitches I got more screams
Than David Arquette's resume what that means
Is my job involves getting' mobbed like John Gotti
Dressed to kill like I'm Gianni Versace
But I gotta be so when a gimp limps back for more
In a huff like that fat kid that had sat out for
Every gym class due to his asthma that wore
One correctional shoe but still passed that I swore
I spotted at the smorgasbord sprintin' for seconds
That I reckon ain't as sloppy as the leftovers gettin'
Me clocked by blocked cock pissed my tryst with his missus
Got her panties in a bunch just like his is
That my face between her legs? Because that could be
What convinced this dick getting' hard I'm a pussy
But if that were my name I would have autographed her breasts with
Motherfuckin' dollar signs instead of s's

In front of the club I see this girl like, ""Yo love""
Thought she said ""thug"" but she called me a ""scrub""
Scrub? What? She musta talk me a joke

Yo, chill cousin, these birds is ill cousin
Cause they call me scrub like we can't even bill cousin

Throw you on the street team, make you shit vinyls
Hey yo Flex, shorty tried to flash me wrong
How she gonna wear sandals wit nasty corns?

I wonder how you get hearts
In dirty Victoria draws with the skidmarks
Uh, ya flat ass gets enough laughs
Take it to the salon, pluck ya mustache
So next time you shotgun, and that ho bitchin'
Hittin' you a scrub, call that bitch a Pigeon
[Verse 4]
Hey yo, I got two nuts bitch, choose a ball
You only walk Pigeon-toed cause ya shoes are small
You don't shop, you just cruise the mall
No dough, with Lee Press-Ons
Frontin' with ya girlsfriend dress on
You birds wanna take over?
Get some cash and a Jenny Jones makeover
Broke Bitches, I hate Pigeons
Dirty braid Pigeons, medicaid Pigeons, Section Eight Pigeons
Got me fed, burned I tell these birds Shutup
And how my left ear be double her whole getup
Go ahead with your lame ass, blow at night
Throw a ripped dolla at her, tell her, ""Put that on your train pass""

[Bridge]
If you got more than one baby father
Oh yes girl, we's talkin to you
If you strip all week to go clubbin'
Oh yes girl, we's talkin to you
Buy a dress to front and take it back to the store
Oh yes girl, we's talkin to you
Wanna smoke wit me, wit no money
Oh no, I don't want no

Greet your highness, Queen's finest
Gleam shin as three clip street fighters
Deep dish Jeep riders
Outlandish in they expanded rover
Passenger in my own whip, yeah that's my chauffer
I rap for ya, that's my culture
When I holla holla like Ja Rule
You in a trance from the god's jewels
Glance at my car, drool
Grand like the Concourse
Wonderin' damn, how much the car cost?
Ya just another fan, applause, encores
And when I fly through world tours on Concords
Don't need no chicken drippin, save that for Lipton
No scrubs here, strictly Mo' Thugs, dear
Check the listings, no Pigeons
Flat broke chicks, out to get rich off the next bro's shit
Instead of TLC, you give us brotha's B.I.G. trouble
We're just Sporty Thievz, huddle game with the illest rebuttal"

Holiday, oh, a holiday
And the best one of the year
Dozing off underneath my sheets
While I cover both my ears

[Chorus]
But if I wait for a holiday
Could it stop my fear?
To go away on a summer's day
Never seemed so clear

[Verse 2]
Holiday, still so far away
Our republic on the beach
I can't forget just how bad it gets
When I'm counting on my teeth

But if I wait for a holiday
Could it stop my fear?
To go away on a summer's day
Never seemed so clear

A vegetarian since the invasion
She'd never seen the word 'bombs'
She'd never seen the word 'bombs'
Blown up to 96-point Futura
She'd never seen an AK
In a yellowy Day-Glo display
A T-shirt so lovely, it turned all the history books grey

[Verse 3]
I got wheels, I got Cutter spray
And a healthy sense of worth
Half of me is the gasoline
But the other half's the surf

Could it stop my fear?
To go away on a summer's day
Never seemed so clear"

So if I ever touch millions, don't you say that I changed
I been a spewing dickhead since I got my brain
And all these wack niggas rap the same: Drizzy
Will never catch a shot or shots: 50
If you ain't Young Money, then them punches ain't hittin'
Drop spit like a waiter, and his table ain't tippin'
I'mma boss, no simpin', and it's only bomb strictly
With a maniac side for all the slime that ride with me
Parking lot pimp, eating steak and tiger shrimp
With a 90's old flow like a Karl Kani fit
A Four Loko sipper, on my dollar sign shit
With style about as hot as valves on a satellite lift
Chesapeake lineman, VA's finest
Shouts to the host, but we gettin' the bar livest
My trippy niggas in this, they split it, they raw, violent
They'll rearrange ya wig like Nikki Minaj's stylist

Sorry I took so long, yeah

[Verse 1: P.O.S.]
There ain't nobody to be pretty for, fuck it, let it rattle
Let the clatter kill 'em, let the cataclysm wash
Who really listens? Precision with a verse draws a crowd
I draw a line between an easy melody and piece of mind
I keep the game tweaked, freak the same
To its own thing, spit the plain pain
Econolines for the dime class, it's a goddamn recession
(C'mon) Show a little respect you Pfizer babies
Look at how they hate, pilled out, bounce they liver off they top eight
Who got a fix for the fix? Bush no more
Nobody's like ""Dufresne, search party of four""
Tell me, who's eating? I mean well
Who's beaten shell toes kick a hole in who's cheating hell?
Need it while you can, serve, get swerved, get sleep
Buy it up c'mon, uh huh
They out for presidents to represent them
You think a president could represent you?
You really think a president would represent you? (right)
They call me P.O.S., bold from the go to the goal
To them ice cold bones, freezing in that Minnesota snow
Heating up the winter with the flow
They make it rain, rain, rain go away
Come again brave, or when you bring a bit to help us grow
(Meanwhile) We them pro parade-rainers
Presented by the Doomtree, sponsored by the Rhymesayers
No-brainer if you aim at the aimless
The same small change big drain on my patience
(It's) my act, my scene, my play, my stage
My lines, my way, all day, all style plus guts (c'mon)
Cap cut, no fresh, no clean, all press, yes mean
Swoosh, removed, lose the cool, choose whatever behooves the dude
Move through any mood with ease
Ravage the rules, ravishing mood, Randy Savage the fools
Handy with tools, cutting my own key
Cattle to meat, sheep splitter, kennel killer
Handmade hand-gunner, fan-blade runner, huh?
Promise of skill, better than blessed, promise of stress
Living and breathing, motherfuck all the rest
Now what do you do... exactly?
N-not, not exactly like you don't do anything exactly
But more like, what exactly do you do?

I can't tell if it's the bees or the sting
The honey or the wax on the wing
But people just Walmart what they worth, roll back
They don't get to pick what you deserve

What exactly do you do Miss? (we take)
Tell me who the hell are you? You're out of your element Donny, shut up

No mercy for me

Let me go
Let me go
You've got to let me go
Right or wrong
Let me go
I'm on my path
Let me go

My mama loved me more than I do
She said, ""ya pops was just like you""
Trapped in a vicious cycle
Jesus' youngest disciple
Tell the judge if he throw a book at me
Make it The Bible
Started calling myself ""The King"" for lack of a better title
Loyal beyond belief to my detriment
It's so vital I change or blow opportunities
Like a choir recital
Now while I do not care who telling
Meanwhile, selling powder puts food in the bellies
Well it's unfortunate
The orphanage couldn't keep up the mortgages
Kid go to school stupid, they teachers ignoring it
Sorta just doomed, forced into being a goon, selling kush in a jar
Mixing up the tar in a balloon
Consumed with the same way of life I left
Everything I know now, I learned by myself
All you see are the whips
The Maserati's, Ferrari's, so they don't sympathize
Don't nobody feel sorry
No mercy

Everybody's standing and waitin
Chanting, they' hating
Gospels say they should forgive me
They'd rather hand me to Satan
Blatant, displays the day of hypocrisy
Boy you got to be kidding
Could it be possibly the second coming of Pac is me?
Remember that, when he was here?
And when he died you realized you need him here
God with me partner, ain't no one for me to fear
Hindsight: 20/20
Future not as clear
But I'm a rider 'till I die
Put bullets 'tween my eye
I just ask that I can make my peace with God and say goodbye
Fuck up the world like Lady Di
On the day he died, his wife and sons and daughters know that every day he tried
To be a better person, nah, they wanted better verses
They could market to the merchants
But when they' closed curtains
You could be for certain ain't nobody perfect
But when you're rich, nobody gives a shit
No mercy
[Chorus: The Dream]
There's no mercy for me
No crying myself to sleep
No mercy for me
Nightmares have become my dreams
No mercy for me
Good morning reality
Will I wake? We'll never know

How the hell did he manage to get more felony charges?
He's already got life in jail, man, what the hell is his problem?
Well, to be honest
The smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic
They've compelled me to kill this elderly man
And I get these panic attacks, pop a Xanax, relax
Trying to stick my fucking dick inside a mannequin's ass
Then I get manic-depressed, see the orthodontist, get gassed
Man, it's kick-ass, the first thing I put on is the mask
Speaking of masks, man, it ain't too late to have a change of pace
And take it off and show my face, so you can see the things you face
And slice you up and cook you after you're murdered by strangulation
That's bacon souffle you making, ain't you? Well, thank you, Jason
There goes one more coma due to blunt force trauma
Just give me one more Soma and I'll be done for, mama
Go in the damn broom closet, another Valium, lost it
Shoving the vacuum nozzle, down the bathroom faucet
It seems like every day, I get a little flakier
The medication is making my hands a little shakier
Hand me that eighteen-month-old baby to shake him up
It'll only take me a second to choke his trachea
Breaking his neck in eighty-some places, baby, here Shady comes, lady
He's got the razor b-blades and the ch-ch-chainsa-saw, baby
You b-b-blundering, bumbling, m-m-mumbling dum-dums
Yeah, here I come-come, you hear the rumbling? Vrumm-vrumm
There's something inside of that blue tub and that drum-drum
A head and torso of someone; where'd it come from?
Who's it belong to? Maybe the girl with the long, blonde hair
Who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom-poms
Clearly, there's somethin' wrong, 'cause she didn't come home
She's missing, where is she? Something fishy is going on
I guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs
Now, everybody get your dance on to my damn song, come on!"

And slow it up, because I know how to fuck
Keep your pussy right there, don't move, ooh
Holla at your boy, baby, do what it do
I love fucking you, your pussy's the bomb (yeah)
Think about fucking this shit all day when I'm gone
Get up, suck that dick, spit on it, slob on that shit
More bubbles at the knob of that shit
It's my word, you'se a whore, taste good, right?
Turn around, get on all four
(You pulling my hair) Shut the fuck up
(Why you fucking me like that?) Shut the fuck up
This ain't no R&B dick, this hood
My slow jam dick is on Thursday's, if my sugar high
My dick don't get up, you know I'm the best
Just, shut your mouth up like you under arrest
I'm ready to cum (you ready to cum)
Yeah, keep it right (oh my gosh, my pussy is numb)
OK, just rub it up against your hole
Put your thumb in your mouth, and fuck me real slow
Look at me, yeah, baby, I'mma let that go
Tell me you love me (I love you, baby) Oh oh
[Outro: Ghostface Killah (Girl)]
Oh shit, don't touch me, don't touch me
I said don't touch me, chill
Let me get a cigarette (you don't smoke, nigga)
Oh yeah, I forgot (haha) I love when you fuck me like that
I'mma go put up some work at the studio, though
But when I get back, have a little nurse outfit on
With the hat to the side, so I can bend you over
In that little desk we got in the room
In your thigh highs, word up, and I'mma stop at the Adel store
And get one of them little screaming O's
So you can sit your little clit on it and just
Let it buzz off all day (yeah) Knowhatimsaying, ma?
I'mma get the nine and move"

Yeah, uh, where's the love for the sixteen writers
Who elevate the game when it was in need of a pilot?
Who made a situation from what you see it's a problem
What you thought was a prize is what I see as a blinder
They ask me why I never wear chains, but if you brought up
How I'm brought up, then you probably feel the same
And I ain't saying chains suck, probably get me 3 or 4
But I got cousins overseas that come to me for better clothes
And I can't go to Emmy Lola, stunting with no diamonds on
Mama bills piling up, her son don't got no time to ball
I don't got no time to call, hope that you ain't mad though
You know your son a asshole, but I hope you got those stacks though
Always on the road again, with Omega or the band
Lost a couple friends, cool; nigga made a lot of fans
And I give it to y'all, cause y'all respect that
So gold albums or not, I did affect rap
Uh, for worse or for better
Ain't no one in my circle that can say they perform better
Huh, they poor effort annoys me, who supporting them?
Who endorse them, should pull the plug and stick a fork in them
They finito, why the fuck they all got egos?
My OG is Tyrique and my kick game be like Bobbito Garcia
This shit a free throw, this shit here for my people
No soup for all you suckers while I'm re-ing up on me so
And they feeling me so, they not feeling y'all so
I volunteer every ten I see, Vince Yarbrough
Pat Summit dough, motherfuck a ho
This is More About Nothing, I'm the fucking show
Hold it, keep rolling
Respect is like food, nigga what it do?

I got no time to be a hater, just trying to be your favorite
They trying to be the greatest, their whole signing was a favor
It's not about the paper, it's not about the fame
And I don't know no Triple H, but this is all about the Game
Competition I ain't winning but admit it, I'm still in it though
Should've been an all-star, I'm Crawford for Interscope
Em starting, 50 staring, Gaga, Game starting
And Will.I.Am and the Peas, the sixth man I am, y'all
And though I came far, know I got a way to go
Waiting for Pitchfork to say ""Wale on this, so way to go""
Text message from Elliot saying ""tape was dope""
XXL favorite quote, what else do I need to post?
I am not no homophobe, good thing I don't read The Post
Unless your 'Skin's winning, then I do it just to fucking boast
With this rap shit, you know I do the fucking most
I'm all over this beat like a motherfucking stethoscope
I'm forever dope, you can check your schedule
My timing was any better, then bitch, I'd be a metronome
I am such a renegade, but try to be professional
But I am way too passionate to patch shit up and let shit go
Want you all to listen so I rap it in election form
But when you intellectual, some niggas ain't gon' let you on
But I'm here, jo, I hope you niggas know it's on
No soup for you wack niggas, I'mma get my chowder on

Times R Gettin Crazy,Mac Dre,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Awe, yeah
Mac Dre
From the brain
They don’t know nothing about this type of music, mayne
So-so dope
Check it out…

[Verse 1]
1991 can’t leave my house without packing my gun
'cus nowadays things ain't so clean
You either end up dope dealing or being a dope fiend
Too much stress on a young man’s brain
Smoking that dank to deal with the pain
Much love for the brothers in the crew
But who in the crew will be here in ’92?

Every damn day I see more
Brothers getting killed or thrown in a trunk
Dope fiend mothers sellin sex
Welfare mother’s waiting for checks
Pops in the bathroom shooting Hop
Tell me, my brothers, where does it stop?
I got to get a grip, can’t let it phase me
I’m staying strong, 'cus times are getting crazy
[Hook]
Times are getting crazy {crazy, crazy, crazy}
Times are getting crazy
Times are getting crazy
Times are getting crazy
Times are getting crazy {crazy, crazy}
Times are getting crazy!

[Verse 2]
Brothers search hard for that perfect life
5 bedroom home, 2 kids, and a wife
Dog in the back by the swimming pool
Everybody wants to be living cool
But, to have these things you must have hope, mayn
Can’t get wrapped up in the dope game
It ain’t cool, you better stay far
Life is much more than brains and a car

Girls having babies before it’s time
Getting pregnant and don’t have a dime
THINK, baby, don’t be a fool
You better wait until things get cool
Keep a hat on a young man’s jimmy
It’s safe sex, but you don’t hear me
Wake up, you can’t be lazy
'Cus times are getting crazy
Times are getting crazy…
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Children from the black minority
Locked down in the Youth Authority
Dewitt-Nelson, Washington Ridge
These are places they lock down kids
It ain't right, it wasn’t meant to be
We don’t belong in no penitentiary
You got a talent, you better use it
Pick up a pen and write some music
And if not, boy, play sports
Get the Hoop ball and hit the court
The dope game just ain't cool
You better try and stay in school
'Cus times are getting crazy…

Times are getting crazy

I am Iron Man

[Verse 1]
Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or, if he moves, will he fall?

Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl
[Verse 2]
Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again

That y'all (That y'all!), that y'all (That y'all!)
And that's all!

[Verse 1: Nas]
Street's disciple, my raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain, just like a rifle
Stampede the stage, I leave the microphone split
Play Mr. Tuffy while I'm on some Pretty Tone shit
Verbal assassin, my architect pleases
When I was twelve, I went to Hell for snuffin' Jesus
Nasty Nas is a rebel to America
Police murderer, I'm causin' hysteria
My troops roll up with a strange force
I was trapped in a cage and let out by the Main Source
Swimmin' in women like a lifeguard
Put on a bulletproof, nigga, I strike hard
Kidnap the president's wife without a plan
And hangin' niggas like the Ku Klux Klan
I melt mics 'til the soundwave's over
Before steppin' to me, you'd rather step to Jehovah
Slammin' MCs on cement
'Cause verbally, I'm iller than a AIDS patient
I move swift and uplift your mind
Shoot the gift when I riff and rhyme
Rappin' sniper, speakin' real words
My thoughts react like Steven Spielberg's
Poetry attacks, paragraphs punch hard
My brain is insane, I'm out to lunch, God
Science is dropped, my raps are toxic
My voicebox locks and excels like a rocket

And that's all!

[Verse 2: Joe Fatal]
Fatal is merciful and they curse me
When I grip the mic, I show no mercy
I got heart, I rip the party apart from the seams
And hem 'em up like bell-bottom jeans
But you get done, you get blues like 501
Brothers are live, but I bet you I'm liver, son
So let me get upon the scene and redeem the dream of a team
And knock 'em out like Mitch Green
Smoke some Thai weed, flow at a high speed
Rap on off-breaks, stompin' like Northlakes
'Cause I'm livin' larger than the founders of Fendi
And Asiatic brothers that many rappers envy
So round up your crew and entourage
And let the God Merciful just take charge

[Hook]
It's like that y'all (That y'all!), that y'all (That y'all!)
That y'all (That y'all!), that y'all (That y'all!)
That y'all (That y'all!), that y'all (That y'all!)
And that's all!
[Verse 3: Akinyele]
Some of them said (Said what?) that the Ak' should quit
But I don't sweat it, 'cause I'm too big for that small shit
Like pigs, when it comes to a showdown
Huff and puff, but the Ak' won't get blown down
'Cause I come strong, rather than come at all and not be ready
That's what separates me from the petty
MCs gas themselves by drinkin' too much Getty
And get torn the fuck up like confetti
I'm rich and thick in lyrics like Aunt Jemima
It doesn't take Keenan Ivory Wayans to know that I'ma—
Get you, sucker, if you bite like a piranha
So save them preschool rhymes for the kids at Wonderama
Point-blank, period, with no comma
Rhymes so dangerous, call for the homicide
'Cause I knock 'em dead, even when I'm at my worst
The only future that lies ahead of them is the lights from the hearse
Got game like a crackhead, but don't be misled
I keep rappers on lock like a dread
Knots in the head from the words that I said
So get a shovel and dig your grave, 'cause the shit you talk is dead

Ayo, it's like that y'all (That y'all!), that y'all (That y'all!)
That y'all (That y'all!), that y'all (That y'all!)
That y'all (That y'all!), that y'all (That y'all!)

[Verse 4: Large Professor]
I grab up girls like jacks
Add 'em on like tax, and I'm over like Hot Trax
As far as brothers are concerned, I pressure-cook 'em from start—
To finish, I diminish like a Cuisinart
Secondly, I'm sick of critics who's neckin' me
(Oooh, he got an afro!) Yo, but I got dough
Why's my name ""The Large Professor?""
'Cause I milked your cow; in other words, I hit your heifer
Don't talk about how you can break Rambo
That's just a bunch of mamba-ja-hambo
Propaganda, save it for Savan-da
Joe and Amanda, Zach and Alexandra
Don't let the folks around your way puff your head
'Cause you'll be the owner of a hospital bed
I'll kick fire out your ass so fast
You'll be as crispy as my man, Bill Blass

It’s been a long time coming!
Let me try something brand new
Hey yo Ski!
We overdue, man
Come on!
Yo what we do it for?

This is for the day-trippers and the hipsters
Whores and the fashionistas
Spiritual leaders practicing all the laws of attraction
The teachers who read the passages
From the Bhagavad Gita
We bustin off Dalai Lamas and flashin' heaters (?)
With the shooting, the thugging and all the spooning
The crooning, the auto-tuning. Alas
You be tellin', peddlin' to consumers
I'm helping them to see through it
Get with this new movement
Let's move it!

Through the cold rain
I’m still standing right here
Even though it (?)

[Verse 2]
Yeah I’m a product of Reaganomics
From the blocks where they rockin' the feds like Jay Electronica
Drop and make this a lock that the crime is where the heart is
Could drop, and make us (?), that the crime is where the heart is
Where the Jesus or Muhammad regardless of where the mosque is
They hope for the Apocalypse like a self-fulfilling prophet
Tell me where do we stop it?
Do they ask you your religion before you rent an apartment?
Is the answer burning Qurans so that we can defend Islamics?
The answer's upon us with a hash tag, a trendy topic
You take away the freedoms that we brought in the game
Then you disrespect the soldiers; you ask them to die in vein
In a desert praying for rain
My music's like a drug, and they tend to take it in the vein
It ain’t for the well-behaved
The soundtrack for when you're braver, the score when you felt afraid
More than your average rapper so you sort of felt the (?)
The brain is like a cage, you a slave, and that's why they lovin' you
This is the book that Eli that start with a K-W
[Hook] x2

I do it for the trappers, other rappers
The backbackers, the crackers
The niggas, the metal-packers
The victims of ghetto factories
I do it for the families
The citizens of humanity
MCs endangered species like manatees
I do it for the future of my children
They the hope for the hopeless
When karma approaches we gon' be food for a flock of vultures
The end of the world, ain't nothin left but the cockroaches
And the freedom fighters
We freedom writers like Bob Moses
They chose us, freedom writers like (?)
For my block, my boro, my hood, my city, my state yea
My obligation to my community is so clear
Yea, we gotta save them, this opportunity so rare
We do is so big over here that it's not fair
To the punks, the bitches, the chumps, the snitches that sneak in the game
We let them live although they weak and they lame

Dream of rocking crowds, see me filling up arenas
This weed got me laughing like a damn hyena
Yeah, I live a life pretty similar to yours
Used to go to school, hang with friends and play sports
Every single summer taking trips to the shore
And that was all gravy but I knew I wanted more
Ain't ever seen a young rapper like moi
Can't believe they eyes, swear it's just a mirage
Still got my training wheels in the garage
But I ain't gonna need those, I'ma go hard (Go hard)
So far I've done pretty well for myself
Couple trophies on the shelf, so what else
Could I want that I don't have yet?
Well, a little more cash and my own fast jet
So I can go anywhere, (Anywhere) anywhere (Anywhere)
Cali for the kush, 'cause boy I know there's plenty there
'Bout to be in music stores everywhere, but not yet
They can't understand my concept
I've been climbing up the great wall, haven't had a fall yet
These blogs gotta know I'm on next
Clean conscience, good Samaritan
Companies send me clothes so I'm wearing them
If you didn't know, well, I'm from the 'Burgh
Everything I drop recorded by Big Jerm
I smoke herb, then I make music
I don't even talk about it, boy, I just do it
Everybody got their own opinion, the reasons why they feeling him
You must admit he's killing 'em, running off adrenaline
Waiting for the game to wanna let him in, so open up
The boy a barrel of a smoking gun
Whether I'm old or young, the chosen one
I got a hundred billion flows to come
I hope you know the lyrics to every single song
So when I'm at a show everyone can sing along
My weed bag empty, bottle at its last drop
I'm feeling like this could be my last shot
But many more songs to make, cousin
So why the fuck you bugging? Haha

Excursions,A Tribe Called Quest,"['hip hop', 'jazz', 'r&b', 'blues', 'pop']","[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Back in the days when I was a teenager
Before I had status and before I had a pager
You could find the Abstract listenin' to hip-hop
My pops used to say, it reminded him of Bebop
I said, ""Well, Daddy, don't you know that things go in cycles?
Way that Bobby Brown is just amping like Michael""
It's all expected, things are for the lookin'
If you got the money, Quest is for the bookin'
Come on everybody, let's get with the fly mode
Still got room on the truckload of black boom
Listen to the rhymes, then get a mental picture
Of this black man, and black woman fixture
Why do I say that? 'Cause I gotta speak the truth, man
Doin' what we feel for the music is the proof, and
Planted on the ground, the act is so together
Bona fide strong, you need leverage to sever
The unit, yes, the unit, yes, the unit called the jazz is
Delivering each year an LP filled with street goods
You can find it on your rack in your record store
If you get the record, say your thoughts are adored
And appreciated, 'cause we're ever so glad we made it
We work hard, so we gotta thank God
Dishin' out the plastic, do the dance till you're spastic
If you diss—it gets drastic
Listen to the rhyme, 'cause it's time to make gravy
If it moves your booty, then shake, shake it, baby
All the way to Africa, A.K.A. the Motherland
Stick out the left, then I'll ask for the other hand
That's the right hand, Black man
Only if you are noted as my man
If I get the credit, then I think I deserve it
If you fake moves, don't fix your mouth to word it
Get in the zone of positivity, not negativity
'Cause we gotta strive for longevity
If you botch up, what's in that [ass]
(What?) A pair of Nikes, size ten-and-a-half
[Chorus]
We gotta make moves (words)
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves (words)
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)

[Interlude: Sample]
""Time, time is a ship on a merciless sea
Drifting toward an abyss of nothingness
Until it can be recharted for its own destiny
Time is an inanimate object paying and paying and paying for no justification for belief
Time is dancing, boogalooing-away all memories of past—""

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
We gotta be a winner all the time
Can't fall prey to a hip-hop crime
With the dope raps and dope tracks we move blocks
From the fly girlies to the hardest of the rocks
Musically the Quest, is on the rise
We on these excursions so you must realize
That continually, I pop my Zulu [shit]
If you don't like it, get off the Zulu tip
So what can you do in the times which exist
You can't fake moves on your brother or your sis
But if your sis is a [bitch], brother is a jerk
Leave 'em both alone and continue with your work
Whatever it may be in today's society
Everything is fair, least that's how it seems to me
You must be honest and true to the next
Don't be phony and expect one not to flex
Especially if you rhyme, you have to live by the pen
Your man is your man, then treat him like your friend
All it is, is the code of the streets
So listen to the knowledge being dropped over beats
Beats that are hard, beats that are funky
They could get you hooked like a crackhead junkie
What you gotta do is know the Tribe is in the sphere
The Abstract Poet, prominent like Shakespeare
(Or Edgar Allan Poe, or Langston Hughes, or...)
[Chorus]
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)

""—time is running out on black power advocates in the day and white thighed supporters at night
Every time you see them, they're chasin' some white woman with their tongue hangin' out

Check it, 'cause I think not when this hip-hops like proper
Rhymes be the proof while I'm drinkin' 90 proof
Huh, vodka, no OJ, no straw
When you give it to me, ayy, give it to me raw

All I need is Chemical Bank to pay the roll

Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since
Get bored quickly
He stay grown
So the p-a-tron had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin'
I can't stop her
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels
And they silencing you back
Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track
Well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
Surrounded by Filipinos I think of the worst case
Watch blue and green diamonds I call it the Earth face
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years it's better bein' Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap it's better bein' this real
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' drinks on me
Nah
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole
Singin' off-key like [Andreena harmonizes]
I'mma spare y'all
Why you wanna judge me
I don't ever compare y'all
The city is mine
I know it because I'm there y'all
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all
Spring '07 second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is wack
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
I'mma do it cause I know I put you through it (I know I put you through it baby)
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at a dinner table
And say ""My baby's famous and I knew it"" (yeah)
And it wasn't nothin' to it
I've drawn it and drew it 'til the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out
[Drake Talking]
Yeah
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF (uhh)
Miss Andreena Mill

[Chorus: Andreena Mill]
Closer to my dreams I'm gettin' higher
Yeah I feel it in my sleep
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progressed
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video
Which made everything right with X (Songz)
I got too many records and not enough shows
Far too many rappers and not enough ___
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin'
Day care play pen drop out
To grade ten drop out
To summer '05 with the grey Benz drop out
Charcoal Charger
Racin' through back streets
On my Craig David shit the Artful Dodger
Shola Ama
I told her I'mma
'Bout to get my run on so hold the commas
Times've changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And ""Hi, haters
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest""
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Summertime
Wintertime
Dinnertime
Anytime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive
Home
[Outro: Drake talking]
Yeah one more time 'fore we turn the lights out ladies and gentleman
(Sing it to' em 'Dreena) lights 'bout to go down, curtains 'bout to close but
I want y'all to enjoy yourself on the way out, yeah man
(Yeah man)

[Chorus: Andreena Mill]
Closer to my dreams I'm gettin' higher
Yeah I feel it in my sleep
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams"
Briar Patch,Devin The Dude,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Devin the Dude]
The briar patch
No don’t throw me in the briar patch
You can cut off all my toes but not the briar patch
You can fill me full of holes but not the briar patch
Don’t throw me in the briar patch
Don’t throw me in the briar patch
Please don’t put me in the briar patch
You can season and cook me but not the briar patch
For me no one would ever look off in the briar patch
Don’t throw me in the briar patch
Don’t throw me in

I hop, I jump, I skip through the rubble
Yo, me ain’t looking for trouble
I was just trying to get to the other end, I never been
Maybe then I can tell my friends how it is. I’ve been
Searching for someone to help me, maybe you can
But it’s hard to tell you how I feel when you got a knife in your hand
You can carve me, tie me up and starve me
Put me on the grill, still nothing can harm me
Like the briar patch
Don’t chunk me in
What kind of luck would I have then?
Wait a minute man, before you put me in it use the gun
That you got, a couple of bullets, I’ll be finished – done
Or hey, I can help you find a pot
Help you build a fire, help you get it good and hot
Well, unless you like to eat me cold
You can but oh no
Please don’t throw me in
The briar patch
No don’t throw me in the briar patch
You can cut off all my toes but not the briar patch
You can fill me full of holes but not the briar patch
Don’t throw me in the briar patch
Don’t throw me in the briar patch
Please don’t put me in the briar patch
You can season and cook me but not the briar patch
For me no one would ever look off in the briar patch
Don’t throw me in the briar patch
Don’t throw me in

You’s an ugly motherfucker, dog, I just call it like I see it
And your breath is like death, if you don’t like it so be it
I get mistreated by others if you cut for me or not
Slice off my toes if that’s how it goes I really don’t give a fuck
If all of this belongs to you, do what you do, go ‘head

But throw me in the briar’s patch and you’ll never see so much red
I bled from less than just trespassing cuz, I’m just asking for a favor
Excuse my rude behavior
I’m just trying to savor the flavor of the fruit I just picked
And if you don’t like it, you can suck my dick

But what you don’t do is throw me in the briar patch and then I’m through
Come on man, can’t we call a truce
Can we do somethin about it before people end up crying and shoutin and poutin
Man, come on man, now that would really hurt …
The briar patch
No don’t throw me in the briar patch
You can cut off all my toes but not the briar patch
You can fill me full of holes but not the briar patch
Don’t throw me in the briar patch
Don’t throw me in the briar patch
Please don’t put me in the briar patch
You can season and cook me but not the briar patch
For me no one would ever look off in the briar patch
Don’t throw me in the briar patch
Don’t throw me in"

Linden Boulevard represent, represent-sent
Tribe Called Quest represent, represent-sent
When the mic is in my hand, I'm never hesitant
My favorite jam back in the day was ""Eric B. for Presi—""

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Rude boy composer, step to me you're over
Brothers wanna flex, you're not Mad Cobra
MC shorty black, there ain't no other
Trini-born lad like Nia Long's grandmother
Tip and Sha they all that, Phife Dawg ditto
Honey tell your man to chill, or else you'll be a widow
Did not you know that my styles are top-dollar?
The Five-Foot Assassin knocking fleas off his collar
Hip hop scholar since being knee high to a duck
The height of Muggsy Bogues, complexion of a hockey puck
You better ask somebody on how we flip the script
Come to a Tribe show and watch the three kids rip

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Queens is in the house represent, represent-sent
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent-sent
No taming of the style 'cause it gets irreverent
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent-sent
Huh-huh, here we go, you know that I'm the rebel
Throwing out the wicked like God did the Devil
Funky like your grandpa's drawers, don't test me
We in like that, you're dead like Presley
When we coming through, get tickets to see me
We work for the paper so there'll never be a freebie
Lyrics are abundant 'cause we got it by the mass
Egos are all idle 'cause the music is the task
Valenzuela on the pitch, curveball, catch it
I think I got it locked, just smooth while I latch it
Right, now I must move with the quickness
Here comes Shaheed so we must bear the witness
[Chorus]
Stir it up! Stir it up! Stir it up!
Stevie
Stir it up! Stir it up! Stir it up!
Stevie

[Verse 3: Phife Dawg and Q-Tip]
New York City represent, represent
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent-sent
The Dawg is scientific with the styles I invent
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent-sent
MCs like to meddle, but here's my proposition
I let my lyrics flow, and juxt your whole position
I'm radical with this like the man this song is after (*laughing*)
Yo Tip settle down, what's the reason for the laughter?
I really can't say, I guess I laugh to keep from crying
So much going on, people killing, people dying
But I won't dwell on that, I think I'll elevate my mental
Thanks for these bars on the Biko instrumental
Yo I'll take it back, I'm the Indian giver
MCs take notes as I stand and deliver (word)
Percussion isn't less (uh), Ds wear the vest (what)
Why they dodging bullets (what?), you should be dodging Quest (uh, uh)
Don't get me wrong, violence is not our forte
I just like to rhyme, kick the lyric skills like Pelé
Tip educate 'em, my rhymes are strictly taboo (o-o-)
Fill 'em with some fantasies and I'll look out like Tattoo
[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
Ok, I am recognizing that the voice inside my head
Is urging me to be myself but never follow someone else
Because opinions are like voices, we all have a different kind
So just clean out all of your ears, these are my views and you will find
That we revolutionize over the kick and the snare
The ghetto vocalist is on a state-wide tear
Soon to be the continent and then the freaking globe
There's room for it all as we mingle at the mall
We welcome competition 'cause it doesn't make one lazy or worn
We gotta work hard, you know the damn card
Try to be the phattest is the level that we strive
Try to be the phattest also to stay alive"

We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Oaktown, LA, San Fran, St. John

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
People give your ears so I be sublime
It's enjoyable to know you and your concubines
Niggas, take off your coats, ladies act like gems
Sit down, Indian style, as we recite these hymns
See, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the MOMO
Ludicrously speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo
Heard me in the eighties, J.B.'s on ""The Promo""
In my never-ending quest to get the paper on the caper
But now, let me take it to the Queens side
I'm taking it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers who invade the air
Hold up a second son, 'cause we almost there
You can be a black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and groove but don't crap the roll
See my shit is universal if you got knowledge of dolo
Or delf or self, see there's no one else
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
So, do that, do that, do that, that, that (come on)
Do that, do that, do that, that, that (OK)
Do that, do that, do that, that, that
I'm bugging out but let me get back 'cause I'm wetting niggas
So run and tell the others 'cause we are the brothers
I learned how to build mics in my workshop class
So give me this award, and let's not make it the last

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Back in '89 I simply slid into place
Buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face
A lot of kids was busting rhymes but they had no taste
Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case?
I have a quest to have a mic in my hand
Without that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman
So Shaheed come in with the sugar cuts
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage, call me Dynomutt
When was the last time you heard the Phife sloppy
Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy
Top notch baby, never coming less
Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest
Sit back, relax, get up out the path
If not that, here's a dancefloor, come move that ass
Non-believers, you can check the stats
I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract
Niggas know the time when Quest is in the jam
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Coming with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
Living mad phat like an oversized mampi
The wackest crews try to diss, it makes me laugh
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft
So, next time that you think you want somethin' here
Make something def or take that garbage to St. Elsewhere

Around the clock, yes it’s my time, my throne
Better know the time of day in any fuckin' time zone
I’m feelin' like I’m on top of the rhinestone
Pullin' the ladder from heaven, about to climb home
Mental thoughts are sharper than a pine cone
In this world of numbers, I keep my nine on
And I don’t go to church because the lyin' long
And the preacher, he be gettin' his shine on
But I know my Lord — I am God’s own
Back to my hands, tick-tick; a time bomb

When they turned my city into a swimmin' pool

Polices be on my tip, like hats do
But I stay strong like blacks do
Never saved by the bell in a black school
And I stay in trouble like Zack do

Therefore my name remains, like a tattoo

Alright; alright, alright, alright
I’m in their conversations
The title's up for grabs, I’m into confiscation
Punch, shot, and stab; now you're the doctor's patient
Wild like an Arab from the Islamic nation
I get money 'round the clock, ain't got no time for hatin'
And these niggas ain't shit, like they're constipated
I get the coupe with the kit, watch me lobster red it
Drop the top at the light, that's when I be headed
So far ahead of them I feel outdated
But I feel electric like I’m Rayden
Used to play Mortal Kombat when I was a couch potato
And now I’m coming out the faders, no homo

They wanna be down with the King!

Down with the king for years, about ten of 'em
Recruiting suckers mackin' mic, and makin' men of 'em
Tears and fears for my peers, they rippin'
You think that it is, it is, if not it isn't
Race for the border my daughter, 'cause beats you're bangin' out
Jeeps rockin' beats in the streets when there's time for hangin' out
Gather, or rather form a circle around a loud
'Cause brothers or others could never ever rock a crowd
Is it because he's runnin' off with the mouth
Or was he really clearly tryin' to play a nigga out
Nope, shut him down, the king with a crown
'Cause all you wanna be is Diggy Down

Down with the king
The king down with the king [x7]

Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was meeca, and it went this way
Recollect a mecca mic check on the windmill skills
Mac distracts, wearing Godfather hats
It's okay to parlay to forte better
Tell 'em my nigga made a sweater tougher than leather
Swing another Rodney King thing and I'll wreck
But just like the white one I get no respect
Money stay awake, 'cause them other niggas are fake
From Hollis to the Beacon, now your dumb ass is leakin'
C.L. and Run D.M.C. so rush it
Big time weight before Hammer got to touch it
Remember the faces in all types of places
Look Ma, no shoelaces
And I'm

I'm takin' the tours, I'm wreckin' the land
I keep it hardcore because it's dope man
These are the roughest toughest words I ever wrote down
Not meant for a ho like a slow jam, check it
Sucka emcees could never swing with D
Because of all the things that I bring with me
Only G-O-D could be a king to me
And if the G-O-D be in me, then the king I be
The microphone is branded when it's handed to me
I was planted on this planet and I plan to emcee
The emcee fiends only seem to agree
That I rock all the world and the society
Outrageous on the stages with a tune of verse
I give praises from these pages to the universe
My voice is raw, my lyrics is law
I keep it hardcore like you never saw

I'm the man you see, in the place to be
I went to John Jay University
And since kindergarten I acquired the knowledge
And after twelve grade I went straight to college
Down with the kings on the mic, a full swinger
The P to the R, not an R&B singer
The R to the U-N-D-MC'n
The fly human beings, tonight I hold the key and
Flowin' with the funk track, here to soul brother black
Pick up the bass, better yet leave a space
So let me put my big black twinkie on in to the early mornin'
Had skins yawning'

(I reminisce, I reminisce)
I reminisce, I reminisce
Uh! (I reminisce, I reminisce)
Yeah (I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)

[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
I reminisce for a spell, or shall I say think back
Twenty-two years ago to keep it on track
The birth of a child on the 8th of October
A toast, but my granddaddy came sober
Countin' all the fingers and the toes
Now I suppose you hope the little black boy grows
Huh, eighteen years younger than my mama
But I rarely got beatings 'cause the girl loved drama
In single parenthood, there I stood
By the time she was 21, had another one
This one's a girl, let's name her Pam
Same father as the first, but you don't give a damn
Irresponsible, plain not-thinking
Papa said chill but the brother keep winking
Still he won't down you or tear out your hide
On your side while the baby maker slide
But mama got wise to the game
The youngest of five kids, hon here it is
After 10 years without no spouse
Momma's gettin married and a house
Listen, positive over negative for the women and master
Mother Queen's rising a chapter
Déjà vu, tell you what I'm gonna do
When they reminisce over you, my God
[Bridge 1: Pete Rock]
My God
It's so
Yeah, so lovely
That's how we like to do it in the 90's
Pete Rock & CL Smooth comin' atcha

[Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
When I date back I recall a man off the family tree
My right hand Poppa Doc I see
Took me from a boy to a man so I always had a father
When my biological didn't bother
Taking care of this, so who am I to bicker
Not a bad ticker but I'm clocking pop's liver
But you can never say that his life is through
Five kids at 21 believe he got a right too
Here we go while I check the scene
With the Portuguese Lover at the age of 14
The same age, front page, no fuss
But I bet you all your dough they live longer than us
Never been senile, that's where you're wrong
But give the man a taste and he's gone
Noddin' off, sleep to a jazz tune
I can hear his head banging on the wall in the next room
I get the pillow and hope I don't wake him
For this man do cuss, hear it all in verbatim
Telling me how to raise my boy unless he's taking over
I said pop maybe when you're older
We laughed all night about the hookers at the party
My old man standing, yelling ""Good God Almighty""
Use your condom, take sips of the brew
When they reminisce over you, for real
[Bridge 2: Pete Rock]
For real, baby
Like that
We for real
Comin' atcha
In '92
Pete Rock & CL Smooth
Yeah, c'mon, hit me!

[Verse 3: C.L. Smooth]
I reminisce so you never forget this
The days of way-back, so many bear witness the fitness
Take the first letter out of each word in this joint
Listen close as I prove my point
T to the R the O-Y, how did you and I meet?
In front of Big Lou's, fighting in the street
But only you saw what took many time to see
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
Rain or shine, yes, in any weather
My Grandmom Pam holds the family together
My Uncle Doc's the greatest, better yet the latest
If we're talking about a car, Uncle Sterling got the latest
I strive to be live 'cause I got no choice
And run my own business like my Aunt Joyce
So Pete Rock hit me, 'nough respect due
When they reminisce over you, listen
[Outro: Pete Rock]
Listen, just listen
To the funky song as I rock on
And that's word is bond
I'm not playin'
Everybody, just coolin'
This song we dedicate
To the one and only
Never be another
He was my brother
Trouble T-Roy
It's like that y'all
And you don't stop
Pete Rock and CL Smooth for '92
And we out, later"

""I'm rated R, this is a warning""
""Boy you can't fuck with me!!""

[Verse 1: Redman]
Nah nah nah, fuck that!
Don't hold me back, the Funkadelic Devil just snapped
With a rap, that's shittin on the story of Jack Sprat
So put your money where your mouth is
Watch Redman house shit
And if it's beef, I'll punch you in your mouth, kid ('Damn!')
I got a heart but my heart is made out of nails
Word to Jamelle, my heart pumps nails in my blood rail
I'm not a warrior or barbarian type of nigga
I'm just quick to smoke your family then fuck your sister
That's what type of shit I'm on, word is bond
Been thinkin' about playing that nice guy role at heaven door
'Cause ever since I was an infant I was different
Paid no attention to my moms when she riffed-ed
I was a hardheaded mother-eff, but had to step
'Cause she hit me with a left, then another left
That's why my brain is out of order
Because it takes just a quarter to manslaughter your little daughter
And do a driveby—fuck that, I walk by and I spray shit
Then carve my name in your pavement
I was Rated 'X' but I flexed
I beat up the devil with a shovel so he dropped me a level
Ain't that ill? That I could just stand and watch a bloodspill
From a known rapper, but now the rapper's no frill
Just because I made a record I'm a star, that's bullshit
What's the flavor, Tame? (Fuck what you heard, this rated R)
[Chorus: Repeat 4X]
""I'm rated R, this is a warning""
""Boy you can't fuck with me!!""

[Verse 2]
Back to part two of the segment, the Red bend
Mics of all types, pour beer out for my dead friends
And if I didn't know ya, to hell witcha punk
And tell the devil I'll be in time for lunch (heh heh heh heh)
Got Naughty in my Nature plus I'm down with O.P.P
The best part about it, I got AIDS, bitch!
Psych, I'm only kiddin, only do it to ugly women
'Cause the pretty one's puss' smell like they went fishin
I grab my dick with a tight grip 'cause I might flip
(Yo Red, kick that hype shit on who you had a fight with!)
I had a fight with Chuck, the punk motherfuck
Tried to stab me in the gut, so I dazed him with an uppercut (BING!)
Snapped the neck on Michael Myers then I freaked it
'Cause it was August and he was talkin this trick or treat shit (Trick or treat!)
Jason my man slangs rocks like up the block
143rd and Amsterdam by the smoke shop
Norman Bates work the night shift late
Since he dresses like his mama, I pimp him and his hoecake
Bust a maneuver, Freddy Krueger
Dreamed about me havin' him scooped up
He woke up with his dukes up
That caused me to cut the hands off the man with the chainsaw
Plus I got his brain pickled in a jar
So let's get down with the funk break, 'cause they tailgate
My rap style, so to cut 'em off, I truncate
And rough 'em up, tough 'em up, like bust 'em up
With the one-two punch, like serving a customer
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
Then ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I know, from me, THE original P-Funk
See ya next LP, chump!

""I'm rated R, this is a warning""

Hieroglyphics is gonna twist a kid's cerebellum
If he lives, then I tell 'em, I'll leave his head swellin'
When tellin' fellas about the 5-6
Live, it's me investigatin' fly chick's privates
I got a plan, I got a plan, a strategy
Adam be mad a G, mad at me 'cause I got a fatter salary
Actually, you will be cookin' like bottom ramen
Never top, 'cause you'll never stop the atom bombin'
Hiroshima, Nagasaki, don't copy
The manuscript, man you slipped, you're sloppy
Joe Schmo, never no more, I'm clever and you're
Never gonna score 'cause I'm sure I'm better and pure
Like cannabis, and if it's possible I'll drop a new
Line with the lyrics, live is the spirit
And soul, I got plenty in me, eeny-meeny-miny-mo
Slo-Mo, approach with yo ho, yup
'Cause I'm the man and you can read it in Genesis
A-D-A-M, the A-P-L-U-S
One and the same, runnin' the game on fly chicks
Real tight, so they feel right with the 5-6

Search and find lines of life in my scripture
Screens make me seen so the keen get the picture

Eruptions, and busting, when I'm thrusting, cuts men
Into microscopic particles, molecules, atoms
Attack 'em, hack 'em, never slow, never slack
I'm invincible [?] the flow is intense at fools
Who know not, flow not like this wizard
Ya play with it, fiddle
Widdle a hole in ya throat and pull out ya gizzard
Trachiotomy, I slaughtta the watery-weak
Your slip-stares are sloppily geek
Niggas tweek when I speak, they retreat
Rethink what was spoken and then repeat
My feat of inhuman capabilities, rape and pillage emcees
Then I kill emcees, who have no style
I file niggas down to the cuticle
Who can feel my foot prints
Soot gets kicked in your eye, beautiful
Blinding, winding, up and change-ups
Rearrange punks, when I drops, kerplunk!
Rip chunks, out the mic, and then digest, why test?
I'm cavin' in your chest when I express
Myself, extreme confusion
You think you're losin' your mind
'Cause my rhyme cuts holes like a nine

Tajai, two syllables, easy
With ease, we, seize thee, butt emcees B
'Cause they come wacker than Batman's sound effects
I ground your text, but vertebrae wack I pound your necks
Sally bone, I be prone to rip shit, likely
Believe it or not, believe it I got the cock-D
Cacophony, I cap the phonies, so there is no needs
For meager attempts, deceivers and pimps know I be
Accelerating on that scale, bats pale the countenances
Of countless knit-wits who wished this
Would mishit, but this shit's equipped with
Homin' devices that are precise as they get, kids
Target's stuck to foes who pose muchly
Fronts be fucked and punk nuts rank us amongst thee
Punks we often cross when soft men
Is the image portrayed to them, spinach is no savior when
I pop eyes, all of the guys feel my brutish
Strength, and wimpies see haggard futures
Don't tempt me, shrimps be skewered on the barbie
My foot is found within ya, is there any dilemma? Yo, hardly"

Nas-ty, Massey, be the last G

The kids that sad, the shit that's drab
And flavorless, and reckless

Ponder on this, I swallowed the spliff with locution
Encompassing the pompous means, when I escalate my tool
Shins get split, men get spindled, swiveled, pivoted
By my riveting centrifuge
I'm swindling crews, bringing a fist to bruise
Pulverizing skulls annihilating trifling dunces
Pulling rifle pumps to stifle punks when my knifes'll
Split your spleen hit you clean in the kisser
When I twist a riddle I'm breakin' the brittle
And flimsy with my whimsy

Terrorize 'em, paralyze 'em paraplegic, when I leave 'em

Little reminiscent of the poetry I write

Step outside and settle this, I cause catastrophes

Demolishing, you and your following, I'm swallowing

Wack flows who chose to oppose

Reverses the process, God bless you swing and whoa its you!

Around the planet, pack 'em in like Janet
Jackson, she's askin' if I can slam it, I'm—
Yo, yo, Redman, man, what the fuck, man?
Get the fuck off that punk smooth shit, man
Get with that rough shit, man, you know how we do

[Verse 1: Redman]
Mic check, I walk around the streets with a black TEC-9
By the waistline, kickin' the hype shit
I never claim to be the best type of rapper
But have to show them motherfuckers what I'm after
I'm after the gold, then after that, the platinum
Beef after that, Hurricane G packs the gat, son
Trigger, bang, bang, yo, bust the slang, what my name?
It's the Redman on the funk train
Psych, you're motherfuckin' right, tonight's the night
To do what I wanna do, to do it like dynamite
The work perfected, when the funk been injected
I roughen up the rough draft to like make your head split
Punk, pass the forty and the blunt and don't front
On the block, 'cause when you do front, brothers are gettin' stomped
I'm not an addict, more like Puff the Magic
Then pass it when I'm through 'cause my crew (Gots to have it)
I don't claim to be a big rap star
'Cause no matter who you are, you'll still catch a bullet scar
So listen up and take heed to what I'm sayin'
'Cause tonight's the night and me and my niggas ain't playin'

Fat black bitch, nasty
Bush bear, booga breath bitch
Nasty, talk to your tits bitch
With them nasty Africans, Mr. Bojangles
Turned up shoes havin' ass
Lemming leprechaun haircut motherfucker

[Verse 2: Redman]
You wanna see me get cool, please, save it for the breeze
'Cause the lyrics and tracks make me funky like cottage cheese
Fuck the smooth shit, I get down with the boom bip
Like Q-Tip, I kick more styles than Bruce shoes kick
But tonight's the night what I write tonight
This type of funk with the flavor like Mike 'n' Ike's
Hanging out with my niggas, my niggas
The Pack Pistol Posse keep they fingers on the triggers
I keep the forty between my lap, coolin', rollin' down the highway
Blunt system pumps 'cause it's Friday
Roll over to pick my boys up, we raise a lot of noise
'Cause we can do that black, so ""Get the Bozack"", Jack
Remember, I do the type of evil that men do
Like cursin' out my window at a bitch and her friend too
So turn the volume up a notch
And watch the ba-bump
Ba-bump, make your speakers pop
That's the funk, when it pumps it makes your rump
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
But if you wanna see a fly but frantic
Cool romantic more slicker than my man Rick
You better check the Yellow Pages under smooth shit
'Cause Red ain't down for the bullshit
Niggas fucked up by lettin' me make an album (How come, rude boy?)
To get on the mic and let my fuckin' style run

Tango mango, pickin' havin' ass
Nasty epileptic disease crazy havin' ass

Jack of Spades, boots havin'
Tony Danza, shoes wearin' ass

B-b-b-black by popular demand, I expand
My hand to the mic and let my mouth kick the flim flam

Relax while I tax, or you can just max
It really doesn't matter, just stay the hell back
Poppin' much junk, now the time has arosen
I pick your card and your name has been chosen
Not all about line uppin' or the stick up scene
Let it flow! you know what I mean
I'm the PMD, in the place to be
Clock rhymin' and I lock ya', around the tick-tocker
Suckers steady clockin' at the same time jockin'
So a brother like MD takes a chill and lay low
Hypnotize your girl, while the funk flow

I got my girls to keep me pumpin', just like Getty
Use the same fuel as Mario Andretti
Kickin' butt in the beginning all the way to the end
He drives, I rhyme no matter what we win
I come fully equipped, with the mic on my hip
So if you real, it's no time to slip
'Cause when it's time for some action, check on the Mic-hael Jackson
Do a spin grab my nuts, and start taxin'
Let the MC's know that I shock like lightning
They mess with the E-Double-E, I sounds frightening

I don't wanna go, but the girlies keep screamin'
So I will stay, if that's fine wit you
But I won't leave, until the party is through
So while I'm here, let me get funky
Fiendin' for the rhyme like a four-deuce junkie
Put the pep in your step, the stride in your glide
EPMD them goin' nationwide

While the bass is steady pumpin' and the beat be like thumpin'
You lose your cool, then you start jumpin'
You're out of control, and I'm right on track
In seconds later I work the bone out your back
To mess with the two is to mess with hot water
We like to hang, torture then slaughter
All sucker MC's, who proceed to intrude
E said ""let em slide"", say what but I'm in the mood
For dishin' and dismissin', all those who don't listen
Reel the ones who's in, as if we was fishin'
So in eighty-eight, no wait I think it's too late
Cause in eighty-seven, you bit on the old bait

So let the funk flow

Lounge homeboy you in the danger zone
When the brother PMD is on the microphone
The slow momentum of my rhymes are divine and combined
To go off beat, and come back on time
To maintain and explain, but never sound the same
And when it comes to do this, very few remain
People on my jock for the rhymes I invent
Dip in a phone booth just like Clark Kent
Step out dressed to impress, with no intention to fess
Chillin' hard, with the P on my chest
Rhymin' on the mic, while the beat rocks steady
Throw a funky fresh rhyme and MC's fetch it like Freddy

Listen to heavy metal, hardcore rock 'n' roll
Drink a six-pack, maybe Miller or Stroh
That's not the move, it's about hip-hop
The loud guitar playin' and screamin' has to stop
Let's get it straight for nineteen eighty-eight
For it can sound fine for nineteen eighty-nine
I hear the girls out there sayin' E is hot
That only shows you what juice I got
And if you don't like me, and you yellin boo

‘Cause nobody ever played me

Science can tell us how, but it can't tell us why

The beauty of life, the pain never lasts
The rain always pass, the sun don’t always shine (Yeah)
When it's gone I'm lonely, but when it's there I'm fine
I hate the wintertime because the nights come quicker
The light make them whites think I'm a nice young nigga
But at night they think twice and walk a little faster
It's funny, hunnid-years-ago I'd've called this nigga, master
How the tables turn but still the fire burning huh
I feel the heat the world is a dryer turning, turning
Im looking for some higher learning, learning
Girl you what I desire, yearning, yearning
You say I'm easily distracted
I think the problem is I'm easily attracted by the darkside
The temptation got me questioning where my heart lies
I'm tryna separate myself like apartheid
But ay the liquor keep swallowing
I swear I walk with God but the devil keep following
I say the devil keep following, following
I say the devil keep following, following
I say the devil keep following, following

Uh
Feel like I'm riding on a chartered plane of broken-hearted pain
Turbulence is constant my pilot has gone insane
If I can find a parachute to parasail
Maybe these parasites of paranoia won't prevail
Character dope as hell, but where is my parallel sweetheart
Deep thoughts lost in my brain so I sleep hard
Nights with no progress
Mane I'm thinking like I'll probably find a Loch Ness
In the projects before I find this
Object of my love, this object of my heart
Guitar strings have strum in search of my counterpart
Bound to start drinking or smoking, sink in this ocean
Leaping through the badness hoping I'm reaching for closeness

Hold it, you're a step off the pace, so catch up
And if you're sittin', get your black ass up
Dance to the rhythm, let it move your pants
And if you don't dance, I assume you can't
And as the crowd, steadily expanding
So move, 'cause I don't want to see you standing
You're in the way, so hey you gotta step
Left right, I don't give a damn, just jet
As you leave the party in the light you can see body
Everybody, but you're a toasting Maserati
'Cause you don't want to handle the scandal
Physical abuse 'cause you're as drunk as Tony Randall
And it's a gamble, I mean I've heard you ramble
On and on but you get worn like a sandal
They said, ""Get raw"" and I did then I slid to the back
And hid behind a whirlwind pyramid
[Outro]
The D-O-C, with some help from my boy T-E-E
Is now operating smoothly
Original knowledge of the whirlwind pyramid
Big dollars I'm gonna always clock
And I'm always down to rock
I had some gin and Sacco (I think you're drunk)
Now I'm ready to rock-o, ha ha ha"
Portrait of a Masterpiece,The D.O.C.,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[The D.O.C.]
Yea, c'mon
C'mon, yea, c'mon

Let's take a trip but not of the physical
Sense of direction on a kid who's artistical
Through a gallery of thoughts, of course it's dope
Hangin' tough like the name on my rope
Watch it be weary instead of steppin' wit the boys
A musical massacre of inadequate noise
By the new authority 'cause of majority
Of peers who hear will award superiority
To those who know you knew now it's inevitable
I laid the track and it's simple unforgettable
Time had hold me better than gold, I sold
And in front of a group of soul is a new episode
So like see if you can grab a pawn yet another one
Take it to the everyday like it's done the son
Words connected up to another degree
And I'm the artist who painted this portrait of a masterpiece
It's unquestionable
That lyrically, the D.O.C.'s a professional
Nothing exquisite to prohibit you from listening up
Crisp and clean but I don't mean 7-Up
I preside ill dippy dope to frantic to panic
And just a man on a mission wit something more in the attic
I'm just an ordinary, boring very few
Do it to the mic, is the D.O. to the C., you
Made the choice that doesn't need to pretend
I’m on the ascend, not knowing where the elevator ends
But anytime between I'm spending
Play it strong, write it like it's never ending
Keep creating while suckers are hating me now
Keep the upper hand 'cause the respond is going 'pow!'
No one can handle the physical torture
I've been taking and no matter what, I'll support'cha
Goals and dreams although is seems it won't come true
All of that is up to you, yo
But if you can't handle
You need to jet, 'cause rap's like a gamble
Basically outspoken, keeping them choking on
But you recall, yo, a helluva rap song
Doing it forever together wit Dre, it will never cease
Money and records like ""Portrait of a Masterpiece""
Now I'm exceptional
Instead of the norm, walking and holding my testicles
[Swoon for a six?], spell out what it means to be dope
The D.O. to the C., they can't cope
Deal the real, yo, it's better 'cause I had to be
Better than any 'cause of majority
Negative never, I'm all about a positive force if you recall
It's the D.O.C. Yo I'm the Boss
Rap much greater, Dre up on the fader
Pump the bass and the pace
Most like by the D.O.C and this is it
'Cause when it's hype, then I feel that it's the shit
Word, never would I stop, I drop the beat I will
Especially when I have to kill
I'm an annihilator, standing a full 6' 3
And I really don't think you wanna deal wit me
Why should I go...
[DOC] Hold on Dre, stop the beat, let me catch my breath
[Dre] Aiyyo man, why ya stopping that was funky
[DOC] To catch my breath
[Dre] Alright you got it?
[DOC] Yeah
[Dre] Kick it

Strong blowing kisses to the wind
The D.O.C. in fact to attack the wicky wack
And take the rightful place at a rightful time
The D.O. to the C. and it's mine
Move, 'cause no one's gonna take my spot
It's new and improved, why? 'Cause it's the diggy diggy D.O.C

The Becoming,Little Brother,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Phonte]
I went from niggas tellin' me I really shouldn't rhyme
To droppin' a classic album muhfuckers couldn't find
Took my respect, took lessons and took the time
And if you want a success story, just take a look at mine
I was blessed with the right components, so precise
Cause I write so tight within the moment
And spit like my life depended on it
I target you herbs
On some teleprompter shit I got you watching your words
Tay rhymes are real life, yours are so 'for instance'
Taxin' these niggas like no dependents
12 bar courtroom drama with no co-defendants
Don't beat it off, come to your senses, lil nigga

[Hook]
Hard rock, my block is where you better be from
Top of the line, my team will never settle for crumbs
And he's hated, but still rated 2nd to none
I'm everything you wanna be but have yet to become
[Phonte]
It all started back in '99 when times was hard
North Carolina Central but we called it the yard
Cause niggas wasn't trying to study abroad
They was trynna study a broad or two or three up in the dorms
Met my nigga Chaundon then I started to ponder
""Fuck this, I'mma quit the football team tomorrow""
Did shows around town and word got around that battling Tay
Was like yelling 'spic' in Tijuana
Built my rep up, that's when Pooh and 9th stepped up
9th was old school, Pooh was young and playing catch-up
Cool, cause he could still rock an instrumental
Our first joints, yeah they was wack
But niggas could hear potential in 'em
Honing our skills for survival, hustling
Our flyers passed out like my momma at revival
The real deal on how I repped my peeps
You ain't goin' find this in no press release, lil nigga

[Hook]

[Hook extended]
And ""he's shook""
That's what your team is telling me, son
Still hated, but still rated 2nd to none
And Greensboro, cause that's the only 'boro I'm from
I'm everything you wanna be, but have yet to become
[Outro]
Support your own man (Support!)
Cause we done been on the other side of this shit (Support!)
We done been on the other side of this shit
Niggas don't even get love in they home state
And then two years later when niggas know
It's like ""oh, we always loved y'all!"""

Where savages fought and pastors taught

Oh, yo, Rae, I can't feel my face, my heart pounding and shit
A kilo is one thousand grams—it's easy to remember
Paranoid as a motherfucker right now—who the fuck—close them blinds and shit. Who that?
All around the world today, the kilo is a measure
Captain Kirk? What, it's the fucking Stark Enterprise, the Enterprise shit outside, or some shit?
A kilo is one thousand grams—it's easy to remember
I need some pussy, though—I'm ready to fuck Catwoman or something. F—Fuck it, let's go!

[Hook: Ghostface Killah & Sample]
All around the world today, the kilo is a measure (Ayo, ayo, Shareefa, go to the store for me)
Whoever got the kilos got the candy, man
A kilo is one thousand grams—it's easy to remember (I need some razors and a fresh box of baggies)
You never catch the kid going hand-to-hand (The ones with ten in them)
All around the world today, the kilo is a measure (Ayo, son, turn that water down a little bit—just a little bit? Thank you)
Once you got the funds, you got the panties, man
A kilo is one thousand grams—it's easy to remember (I need two waters, a Dutch, and a cranberry Snapple)
Throughout I-95, I'm the handyman (Ayo)
[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Bricks, tar caps, powder, cooked up crack
Phones is tapped over Franklin stacks
Kingpins put in bullpens, old connects get paro'
Break out of town when the Jakes take down the pharoah
Reason: He was moving that Peruvian white
Blowing coolies in the hoopties, slamming cuties at nights
Big, heavy pots over hot stoves
Mayonnaise jars in water with rocks in them
Got my whole project out of order
A kilo is a thousand grams
Beige, gold, brown, dirty, fluffy, tan
Extract oil cut from Cuban plants
The chemists is brolic, Pyrex scholars
Professors at war over raw, killing partners for a million dollars

Ayo, peace to those cooking that raw, powder-white
Get your sniff on, Scarface niggas, we getting right
Some call it ""bricks,"" some call it ""birds""
How many niggas get they lives tooken playing with shit, then catch a curve?
You would go to jail; get caught with this, niggas'll grow to fail
Stop playing, pot slaying, baking soda and scales
They lived like brothers—word life—connects discovered
Most niggas get hard from fucking with them pipes and hustlers
Kilos is one thousand grams
You know your ammo better be heavy, 'cause soon kids is coming in camo
Protect your land, daddy; I'm a announcer
You get caught with an ounce, it's over

Some say a drug dealer's destiny is reaching a ki'
I'd rather be the man behind the door, supplying the streets
A hundred birds go out, looking like textbooks when they wrapped and stuffed
Four days later, straight cash, two million bucks
Strictly powder, no cut—your coke is vile, that's whats up
Y'all beefing over little shit, we sniff, the balance went up
In a plane or a penthouse, office or a warehouse
Tony got it nice, we never heard of any big droughts
Kilo is one thousand grams, a pile of sand is equivilant
To the eye, it's nice to have a thousand fans
Coke buyers, some be liars; therefore, you check for wires
Dedicated dealers, during holidays, we give 'em lighters

Bringing back sweet memories (3x)

[Talib Kweli]
Life, living in Flatbush and going to house parties
Red lights, bumping, life is what you make it, then sorry
In my lifetime, ain't done too many things
Better than watching your first son put his sentences together
Yo, it kinda make me think of way back when
I was the portrait of the artist as a young man
All them teenage dreams of rapping
Writing rhymes on napkins
Was really visualization
Making this shit actually happen
It's like something come through me
That truly just consume me
Speaking through the voices of the spirits speaking to me
I think back in the day, I absorbed everything like a sponge
Took a plunge into my past to share with my son
Bringing back sweet memories (3x)

Like thoughts out the back of my mind
Going back in some time
Like when you used to cut and had to go to the back of the line
Look back and you find
Tracks that make you relax and recline
Now cats rap about packing a nine
When they lacking divine
Inspiration
Running out of topics of conversation
Well I drop it in the pocket because rocking's my occupation
I do it remarkably, spark up a leaf
And possibly you could follow me
Tap into your chi
Utilize your spiritual faculty
Accurately use your memory
To help you see clearly, then get back to me
Actually, nothing's new under the sun
So when life be stressing me
My remedy is 'bringing back sweet memories'
Like the faces that are woven in the fabric of my consciousness
From cities where making 21's a big accomplishment
Like when my people understood their prominence
And my past life visions of the continent
Like the first time I saw KRS live, rockin' it
I heard Resurrection by Common Sense
Dominant in my psyche
I chose my direction like Spike Lee
To speak my life through mics, and I never take it lightly
It might be something you did to bring you down when you were high
But that Karma's a bitch, you steady asking God why
Like when my parents first split up
Yo, I was illin'
Seems like some years they was together for the sake of the children
And I love them for that
I don't know if they saw that
So I'mma say it, and convey it when the world play it (3x)
Bringing back sweet memories (3x)

Like black is beautiful, names from the seventies
Let me tap into your energy
Fields of dreams become my property
When I reach my destiny like a prophecy
Especially when I 'm 'bringing back sweet memories'
I got deep into my mind, see I got a treasury
That float through my head like a sweet melody
What you telling me
Reflection is a collection of memories
Definitely this is how hiphop was meant to be
Eventually, I knew I'd run into Hi-Teknology
It was only a matter of time like centuries
Check the recipe or technique to how it sound so sweet
I freak with word power, my man speak with beats
If I could make it in New York, I figured anywhere I'd make it
Came to Cincinnati linked with Mood, and we did Sacred
Hi-Tek beats became my favorite
Hustle on the Side was the cut
We started to put songs together like 'What!'
Traveled the world, came back to the crib
And hit the motherland
Yeah, this year we put in work and got some other plans
In fact, that's where I'll take the fam
When the Reflection joint is done
By the time you hear this, I'll be basking in African sun
Like Wow!
We made it

Loud and clearly? rats aren't near me
Wire-tap niggas get blood in they earpiece
I'm from New Orleans, nowhere near peace
Pure beast, fear-free—""Dear grief!""
Catch up, bitch, I'm in gear three
Zoom, gone, see you, peace! Drop one finger (Gangsta!)
Yeah! Fuck 'em and whoever made 'em
I will hurt whoever love 'em, 'cause I hate 'em
Lookin' for a lady, high and sedated
Got her to the pad—I don't know how a nigga made it
She gave me relations, so, now, we related
The morning comes; the picture faded
I waited on my turn to burn—can I get a light?
Little dog: bigger bite; Jackson Five: Little Mike
Can I get a mic or a mic and a half—
That the Source owe me? Shout out to the editing staff, yeah
I'm all grown, so much better with math
I need a spread in the ""Forbes"" taking a Benjamin bath, yeah
I'm serving this track, like Steffi Graf, yeah
Roger Federer; there's no competitors
Niggas know my rhetoric; bitches know my preference
Young God, baby—all them other niggas reverends
Sittin' in my big house, surrounded by my weaponries
I keep them away like I got leprosy
Chopper right next to me, loaded up with pepper seeds
Got an extra clip, but that's only for my especiallys, yeah, yeah
(Dramatic— Dramatic—) This is especially for you
Just respect a nigga game—what kind of referee is you?
Swallow your whistle—make a nigga ride with the pistol
'Cause the fakest niggas ride with the pistol
Even if I die old, I'ma die with the pistol
If you stand over my body, I'll prob'ly kill you, yeah
Now, I feel it: Weezy the realest
I wear a lot of Bathing Ape, 'cause I be with gorillas, yeah (Gangsta— Gangsta—)
He what they talking 'bout: topic of the conversation
Product of determination, yeah
Stop playing—you are not up in my situation

The car red, so the car Cajun; stop hatin'
Y'all ballers; I'm a sports agent, yeah
Wait a minute—let me translate it: It's—

I remember da way
We would both say
We be together
Forever and a day

We're apart and away
And it feels so stray

Wish I could get together
But timing is an error
And I
Tell a lie
To you like ever
If I was even ever
Given another chance to
""do it again""

Like I died
And gone to heaven
Climbed inside a treasure
Died inside of pleasure like
Wow
Your smile is but of essence
Your child is so precious
I wish
It was paternally mine
But karma is a message
But I'mma try to test it
And scream for a blessing
So loud
And I hope that you would catch it
And one day you would come fallin
Out of the most highest cloud

Then ill be there to catch you
Yes
Ill be there to let you
Do da things
We didn't do before
Now
Next time we have to stretch it
Do it never forget it
I never forgot
I wish dat we could
""do it again"" (X3)

Hey
Im just trynna talk to you
If I could talk to you
Den I would talk
Forever and a day
Yes I remember
So vividly
How we would be
When we lay
And my then blue skies
Were no longer gray
She so brightened up my day
Put it on a scripture
She would be a picture
If perfect had a face
I promise you homie
Dat u would be hungry like me
If you had a taste
I put it on my momma
Cus baby girl is a flower
A flower without a vase
No water needed at all
She continues to grow
More beautiful everyday
And I love her somethin vicious
And im just wishin
We could

Something You Forgot,Lil Wayne,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
That's all I can do mama
The love I'm sending
An't making it through to your heart
I hope you hear me

[Verse 1]
Pain! Since I've lost you, I'm lost too
Nigga feelin' like he at the bottom like a horseshoe
Sorry for the trouble that I put you and your heart through
God knows that I'd do anything for a part two, or to
Be prayin' for the day you come back to me
Sayin' that you forgive me, give me another chance
I'm needin' it like a kidney, I don't wanna advance
Give me back her hands, give me back her touch
I don't ask for much, but I fucked up
I know I fucked up, I admit I fucked up
But everybody fuck up, now this other nigga lucked up
Tell him me and my clique don't give a fuck
'Cause, um, we from New Orleans, she was from Georgia
She was my down chick, I was her soldier
I was her gangsta, she was my shoulder
You were the pistol to my holster... BANG!
[Hook]
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying, to keep it under control
I see you hidin' it, mama
You got it down, and you're well on your way to the top
Keep doin' your thing
But there is something that you forgot

[Verse 2]
You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring
I remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing
I remember the love, right after the fights
You can't tell me you don't remember those nights
And if I would cry, then you would cry twice
To me, you are the brightest star under sunlight
See, take away my title, take away my stripes
You give me back my girl, and you give me back my life
Give me back my girl, and you give me back my life
See, this is just a nightmare, so I blink twice
Open up my eyes hopin' she be in my sight
I remember the time, I wish I could bring it back
What she mean to me is what I mean to rap

[Hook]
You've been hiding (Y'know)
Never letting it show
Always trying (I see you hidin', it mama)
To keep it under control (But I know you know)
You got it down (I know you do)
And you're well on your way to the top
But I wish you and yours nothin' but happiness, shawty
[Verse 3]
But I hope you haven't forgot about me—
Up in the living room, watchin' SportsCenter
You were cookin' dinner, I was such a sinner
But the Lord is a forgiver; you know, they say if you pray
Then you can get your blessings ordered and delivered
And your boyfriend is not like me
Ma, you even went and got a teardrop like me
I remember we would sit at home all day
You called me ""butter,"" I called you ""babe""
My momma asked about you, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazing like you
And I know you probably wish you never met me
And I just wish you never forget me, and let me say:
Please don't worry 'bout the women I have been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
And I hope that nigga know he got a queen
And all I can do is dream, damn!

I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
The love I'm sending
Ain't making it through to your heart"
The Mood,Kid Cudi,"['alternative', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by: Emile Haynie]

[Intro]
Yup
Yup

[Verse 1]
Shades over my eyes
Make the creepers look back at themselves
Sittin' stuck, in emotional bliss
The skinny model girls rub coke on their gums
Tap my knee, I'm keepin' the rhythm
The young and wild take chances together
They all jump up, twist and groove
But no one talks, lost in the motherfuckin' mood

[Chorus]
No one talks, lost in the mood
No one talks, sweatin' it out, lost in the mood

[Verse 2]
There's a hunger in the night
The moonlight kissing the nips on a model frame
I kissed her inner thigh
Closed my eyes, she began to make me fish
She like to go the mile
All the while I could see her tear a bit
I forgot her name, somethin that sound like Penelope
Maybe a French twang to it
Her tongue was quick, she was French I knew it
A lovely foreigner, foreign to racism
She like that young nigga vibe
My brown skin, my shagged out 'fro
I'm king to her, and she will please her friend for me
So funny how the starvin' are guardless
Naked is always honest
Her hands all over my privates, lost in the mood
[Chorus]
No one talks, lost in the mood
No one talks, sweatin' it out, lost in the mood

No one talks, sweatin' it out, lost in the mood"
Unfriendly Game,Masta Ace,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Masta Ace]
I'm about to take this beat and teach you bout the agony of defeat
In this football game in the street
And no it ain't two hand touch, it's rough tackle
When niggas ball on your block and they bust at you
The field's full of players, and they all trying to score
The whole team sits on the bench in the down pour
Cause no matter the weather, the game don't stop
Competing with other teams, that reign on top
Your offense gotta be cats with no conscience
No-nonsense niggas, with no options
That know how to carry that rock
Make the hand-off and run off the block
It's hard to get first down when your new in this rough town
You sell a pound its a touchdown
And niggas see the pigskin, they blast cops
So federal agents dress as mascots
Niggas hold weight but it's not for lifting
The only white lines is the ones niggas sniffing
I know it sounds a bit different, the only quarter is a quarter ki
If that ain't a penalty, it oughta be
And the concession stand is so sick
Serving you the cat, rat and dog on a stick
But if you ask why somebody got slain
Yo, it's just an unfriendly game
[Chorus: Masta Ace & Strick]
The game don't stop, cats keep playing
Some got hit hard and wound up laying
Out in the field but the fans keep paying
Understand what I'm saying
It's just an Unfriendly Game
This ain't America is it
This ain't America is it
Where can I be

[Verse 2: Strick]
Yo, a'yo it's Monday night
We on some watch the game shit
But I can go outside and still see the same shit
Cause look, there's a bunch of niggas in a huddle
Looks like they calling the play
Come on kids, don't be all in the way
Cause that's Pookie, he the fucking quarterback
Cause he like to use the shotgun if he don't I know he got one
And that's Budda he the fucking running back
Cause he always say he gone quit
And he always wind up running back
The rest of them
I'll just say they play the line
Cause they like to protect Pookie and Pookie make them stay in line
And if they make a wrong move they penalized
Not by the referee but by Pookie brother Jeffery
And Jeff don't touch shit, he sit and watch
Oversees the whole block, from his own private luxury box
He the one that makes the deals happen
Smoking big cigars while his stars are in the field scrapping
But tonight the line of scrimmage got penetrated
The block got raided, and everybody got traded
Now they wearing stripes in a pen
Guess that's how the game go
Nigga, you don't know?
Highlights at 10
[Interlude: Reporter]
Wednesday police arrested 12 men in a downtown drug raid
The cartel known on the streets as the Sharks
Was transporting large amounts of marijuana
In shipments of little league football equipment

[Verse 3: Masta Ace]
There's a new team in from out of town
What's the sound
Out of bounds
And the front line niggas stay ready for the blitz sonny
So you won't make a sack of money
And every now and then, somebody drops the ball
And the next team be right there to take it all
Now somebody new is trying to make a score in your territory
It's the same old story
And if you want your corner back you better wear a vest
Just in case, you gotta catch a bullet to the chest
Believe me that shit can be a humdinger
Cause every quarterback in this league's a gunslinger
The half-time show's kinda ill
Hood rat bitches dancing to Dru Hill
Another nigga down and out
A crackhead with no name, yo
It's just an unfriendly game
[Chorus: Masta Ace & Strick]
The game don't stop, cats keep playing
Some got hit hard and wound up laying
Out in the field but the fans keep paying
Understand what I'm saying
It's just an Unfriendly Game

This ain't America is it

Good Mourning,Reflection Eternal,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Talib Kweli]

Good mourning, Brook-nam
Another stop... on the train
(wake up... wake up... wake up...)
We come to a stop that everybody got to make
Whether you local or express

What's the meaning of ghetto fabulous?
Not riding the back of the bus
I'm a revolutionary antagonist
Some playas is mad at us for just doin' our music out of love
Some underground heads is hatin' cause we have fun at clubs
I'm probably on some government list for my rhymin'
You a fool if you don't think they already tapped your line
Medicine is big business so my remedies is herbal
It's music is for the people so we Reflection Eternal
Listen, you hear the difference between science and science fiction
We blow it out like if you leave on every appliance in the kitchen
At once; still rolling kind bud in Cuban blunts
On the corner watchin how kids comin to Brooklyn for they fronts
Niggas run past what they need chasing after what they want
Fuckin chumps, you walk down the street and get jumped
Brooklyn cats like to bubble out of town no lookin back
When you a ghetto chef you mastered the art of cookin crack
Some get caught sleepin on the Mother City so when they go
They come back as tales of niggas we used to know
Never looked up to see the stars in all they heavenly glory
Just straight ahead cause the peripheral is buildings with mad stories
Not floors but dramas is played out, shorties get laid out
Like respect and fade out like TV sets
Into the banks of our memories (let it be) we'll never forget you
Lyin on your deathbed askin for God to bless you
Good mourning, good afternoon, good night
What have you done with your life?
Everybody time comes to be embraced by the light
You only scared to die when you ain't livin right, man
I'm puttin up a hellafied fight
(""Stay awake to the ways of the world"")

I need you all to be clear on exactly what I'm sayin
With your attention span I understand that I ain't playin
You mistaken if you somehow think it's just me you facin
Starin me down while your enemy is standin adjacent
My heart is racin but I know just what I stand for
We chasin death carelessly like Jessica, I Care Moore
Who said, ""Just because no one can understand how you speak
Don't necessarily mean that what you be sayin is deep""
In case you die in your sleep you ask the Lord for a blessin
Sometimes they sneak up so quiet that the silence is deafenin
You'll never know who the assassin is until it's your time to go
Your life is flashin, askin for forgiveness but you move too slow
Now the people that you love bear the pain that you once harbored
You was livin for yourself so you could never be a martyr
Life is hard, death is harder; you somebody baby father
Someone's lover, son of your mother, somebody brother
Somebody nigga, now your spirit in the air like a whisper
Hearin your name mentioned when we pourin out some liquor
The days go by quicker and the nights don't seem to differ
It's gettin cold, so I shivered and asked my soul to be delivered
Good mourning, good afternoon, good night
What have you done with your life?
Everybody time comes to be embraced by the light
You only scared to die when you ain't livin right, man
I'm puttin up a hellafied fight
{*Hi Tek scratch: ""Stay awake to the ways of the world""*}

Yo, the time come for everybody
It ain't somethin you can really prepare for

Yo, yo, Mad Duke, rock rock on and
Curtis Mayfield, rock rock on and
Grover Washington, rock rock on and
My Aunt Hazel, rock rock on and
Big L, rock rock on and
Freaky Tah rock rock on and
Jerome Greene, rock rock on and
Slang Ton, rock rock on and
We celebrate life.. {*echoes*}"
Christmas in Hollis,Run,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Run]
It was December 24th on Hollis Ave after dark
When I seen a man chilling with his dog in the park
I approached him very slowly with my heart full of fear
Looked at his dog, oh my God, a ill reindeer
But then I was illin' 'cause the man had a beard
And a bag full of goodies, 12 o'clock had neared
So I turned my head a second and the man was gone
But he must’ve dropped his wallet smack dead on the lawn
I picked the wallet up but then I took a pause
Took out the license and it cold said ""Santa Claus""
A million dollars in it, cold hundreds of G's
Enough to buy a boat and matching car with ease
But I'd never steal from Santa, cause that ain't right
So I'm going home to mail it back to him that night
But when I got home I bugged, cause under the tree
Was a letter from Santa and the dough was for me

[Verse 2: D.M.C.]
It's Christmas time in Hollis, Queens
Mom's cookin' chicken and collard greens
Rice and stuffing, macaroni and cheese
And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees
Decorate the house with lights at night
Snow's on the ground, snow white so bright
In the fireplace is the yule log
Beneath the mistletoe as we drink eggnog
The rhymes that you hear are the rhymes of Darryl's
But each and every year we bust Christmas carols
Christmas melodies

[Verse 3: Run-D.M.C.]
Rhymes so loud and proud you hear it
It's Christmas time and we got the spirit
Jack Frost chillin', the hawk is out
And that's what Christmas is all about
The time is now, the place is here
And the whole wide world is filled with cheer

[Verse 4: D.M.C.]
My name's D.M.C. with the mic in my hand
And I'm chilling and coolin' just like a snowman
So open your eyes, lend us an ear
We want to say

[Outro: Run-D.M.C.]
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!"

One plus one ain't always two
It's one me, one music we want and it's wonderful
That's why I still get upset when y'all wonder who
Is the best, I'm in the flesh, mic check, one, two
I said ""Is this thing working? Do y'all not hear me?""
Like err website keep they dot-com near me
I'm on the playlist in these kid's iPods
Fuck execs, all their interns think I'm hard
I don't go up to radio to talk
So lose the questions, bring up a beat and I'll freak New York
Make you wanna go to the roof and clamp the heat you bought
Cause you be pumped like the feet on the skeets I tossed
They say ""Me, I'm more"", I say ""Me, not yours
But me like your culo so me want more""
And they know the routine, we ain't gotta rehearse
And shorty give me back shots like I shot at her first"

Yo tego hombre we eating
Money is Nathan
I'm freaking these conjugations deep in their conversation
With people facin Satan
I bring 'em the word of God
My observation: disturbing my words to murder your squad
I pull the trigger with my tongue
Grab the Bible, like Brigham Young
Spit fire my brain is the bigger gun
I'm from Brooklyn where I'm from we calling niggas son
It's cause we shining through the night break out the flashlights
You must be on a sure flight cause you packed light
Behave man, I beat cavemen with stalagmites
Get up to fight you too tired for another round
They say I'm worshipping the devil cause I run this town
Now let me run it down and raise the steaks like a boarderhouse
With one fourth of the Slaughterhouse
[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
The most esquisite so gifted more like a wizard
I spit it a frigid blizzard of lyrics what I exhibit
To finish you little midgets
Admit it, you'll all diminish
For mimicking my image I'm the sickest nigga, forget it
You'll never be near as clever or better
Every letter will sever your metal or medulla whatever
You fellas are feathers don't measure up well with a heavy medicine pedal
An incredible Pelle leather rockin hip hop Fererer
Better off servin em
Every word got a purpose murderous verses
Emerging beneath the surface like volcanos I burn
Every person on Earth should be nervous become service and worship
The permanently perfect version of Merciless Copernicus
I was simple as stars an astronomer
Found my bars a kilometer over Mars near Andromeda
A phenomenon
No common dynamotor able to monitor
My temperature will pressure and crush your barometor

Been telling me that I'm so wrong
Kickin through like a rolling stone

Been telling me that I'm so wrong
Kickin through like a rolling stone
I built this building all on my own
I'm at home on this microphone

I finally figured the competition
On a mission to gimme a pot to piss in
I work hard, play harder than hard decisions
Facing all like a head on car collision
Dig it bout to forgive y'all what y'all been missing
Something crispy for ya listening organism
Awww shit God forbid your my opposition
All that salt gon get you a heart condition
Pimpin, the plot thickens
The shot that you kick a make your balls like rock while your feet get lost
Get dropped on your seat
Exhausted by the heat
Then tossed in the meat grinder
Grind to the beat
Two thousand and ten I'm in house again
Straight six PM and ain't about to bend
Close your eyes and count to ten
Get that mic out your hand we don't know where your mouth has been
Street feeder, a street preacher
Key note keepin peace keeper, elite
True believer, few G's can keep up
Don't need your critique or your halftime speech neither
Emcee phoenix sweet Jesus retreat it
Wouldn't believe it if indeed they don't see it
They take the chief cheeba chief it, try to sneak a peek
Into the recesses is of my deep seeded genius

Upon naming me to birth
They just placed me in the booth and I said
Yeah I was talking
I was walking on the first day and you wasn't
Second day sparking in the cot with my cousin

Oh My God,A Tribe Called Quest,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Listen up, everybody, the bottom line
I'm a black intellect, but unrefined
With precision like a bullet, target bound
Just living like a hooker, the harlot sounds
Now when I say the harlot, you know I mean the hot
Heat of the equator, the broth that's in the pot
Jalick, Jalick ya wind up ya hip
Drafting of the poets, I'm the #7 pick
Licks, licks, licks, boy, 'pon your backside
Licks, licks, licks, boy, 'pon your backside
Listen to the fader, Shaheed lets it glide
Tip the earthly body, heaven's on my side
Even in Santo Domingo when I got a Gringo
We got mics, when do we go?
Know a little nigga who can rhyme when you ask me
Short, dark, and plus his voice is raspy

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg & Q-Tip]
1 for the treble, 2 for the bass
You know the style, Tip, it's time to flip this
I like my beats hard like two day old shit
Steady eating booty MCs like cheese grits
My man Al B. Sure, he's in effect mode
Used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue
It's not like honey dip would wanna get with me
But just in case, I own more condoms than T.L.C
Now the formula is this: Me, Tip, and Ali
For those who can't count, it goes 1-2-3
The anti-batty boy, big up is who I be
Brothers find this hard to do but never me
Some brothers try to diss but Malik, you see 'em bitching
Me no care about them dibby MC, my shit is hitting
Trini gladiator, anti-hesitater
Shaheed push the fader from here to Grenada
Mr. Energetic, who me sound pathetic?
When's the last time you heard a funky diabetic?
I don't know, man, I don't know, man, I don't know, man
I don't know, I don't know

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Complementary are we, the three for poetry
I got a humdinger coming hook, line and sinker
The Timbo hoofs with the prints on the ground
Timbos on the toes, I like the way it's going down
Down like a lady of the evening
When it goes in Toots, just believe it's in
'Cause Queens is the county, Jamaica is the place
Take off your cleats 'cause you can't run the race

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!
Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!
Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!

Food for Thought,Joell Ortiz,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Joell Ortiz]
Yo I ain't gon' front, shorty used to look good
She's just lookin' alright nowadays
It's crazy (C-C-C-Cookin' Soul)

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
Uh, I toss and turn, I can't sleep at night
I see that it was your love that inspired me to write
I remember that day in the summer of 9-2
Everybody gathered 'round and they was talkin' 'bout you
Eavesdropped for an hour and was happy when I left
Went upstairs and wrote what I would say the day we met
A little shorty then but I was confident to death
They made you sound so fly, so I just tried to be my best
Crumpled a couple papers, first impressions happen once
So I just wrote what I had heard, sippin' liquor, rap and blunts
Everybody said you liked that so that's what I tried to offer
My crush on you was out of this world like a flyin' saucer
So next day I went outside and told the guys
What I'mma tell you when we met and they looked at me all surprised
My age was so young yet my words so mature
One dude turned and said ""She just might let you in the door""
[Bridge: Joell Ortiz]
Y'knowmsayin? I had such a crush on this girl cause
She was beautiful back then, it was like 9-2
E'rybody's gathered 'round in front of my buildin' talkin' about her
I'm like ""Yo I can't wait 'til I meet her""
I went upstairs inspired! Y'knowmsayin?
Like, start writin' down ideas like what I'mma tell her, the day we met
Like damn, check it

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
After years of talkin' to the guys, I sharpened my pick-up lines
And recorded 'em, makin' sure they was delivered to you fine
From tryin' to find you it was myself that I would find
So I told you who I was and the chronicles I designed
Then a few years ago Koch Records gave me a sign
I was doin' the right thing when they put some money behind
My story, they figured you like what I had to say
I was popular, my story had even got back to Dre
Knew we was gon' meet, so I tried to stay calm
But I was fin' to be the man if I had you on my arm
Ain't get to my head though, still wrote my letters with charm
That's when a dude named Nas wrote a letter that you was gone
Tried not to believe him but then he was co-signed
By writers across the globe that was on they own grind
So what was I supposed to do? (what?)
For the first time in a long time
I ain't have nothin' to look forward to
[Bridge 2: Joell Ortiz]
So y'all followin' me, right?
I mean I'm pretty sure by now y'all should have an idea of who I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm pretty sure y'all don't think she look as fly
As she used to back in the days either
So I ain't alone in this vote, but um
I'mma try to, I'mma try to save her, man
I'mma try to rescue her, man
Y'knowmsayin? She deserve that (listen)

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
I still wrote to you, even though I heard the rumors
That's when I came to my own understandin' of who you was
No one's actually met you, they just write and hope you hear it
And hope that you're attracted to the person in their lyrics
Some people try to bag you by tellin' you what they have
Hopin' you're materialistic and like to brag
Others try to scoop you by portrayin' that they tough
Prayin' that you're a good girl and you like 'em rough
The newest sensation's tryin' to get you through a dance
So if y'all bump heads at a party you'll give him an extra glance (hey!)
Then there's a couple people like I
That let you know exactly who they are, why not?
But not a soul's met you face-to-face
So with every word they write is where they place the faith
(Dear hip-hop) Provin' the next line in this lyric
How can hip-hop be dead when she's a spirit?
[Outro: Joell Ortiz]
Yaowa, Joell Ortiz (yeah)

Goddamn it, I done did it again
I swear them cameras flash every time I pick up a pen
What y'all spit sugar-coated, I be spittin' that phlegm
Cause where I come from, little dudes got guns bigger than them
And crack heads smoke anything that fit in that stem
And little girls do grown men just to sit in that Benz
I'm from the projects, boy (What)
I'm from the projects, boy (What)
If you're not from there listen close I drop some knowledge boy
Night, time you hear thunder from the hottest toy
If you upstairs you sayin' prayers hopin' it's not your boy
With police around, it ain't just to lock you up (Nah)
They hope somethin' look like a gun so they can pop you up
See me, I play it smooth like a hockey puck
If I ain't writin', I'm in the room with a stocky slut
It ain't friendly outside
Cause like 'rybody po' for that doe you can go
Let me let 'rybody know this

See where I come from
Motherfuckers get home from up top
And the kids they used to send to the store own the spot
And them young boys don't give a what if you old or not
We talkin' lizard shorty shit and he will roast your knot
While you was gone, he got it on and moved that dope and rock
But before them roosters cock-a-doodle-do he post the block
Yeah, that's a projects boy (What)
Yeah, that's a projects boy (What)
If you ain't from here listen close I'll drop some knowledge boy
Snitchin'?
We don't allow that
Man, you tell and you dead
The repercussion be disgustin'
Put Joell in the Fed
Somebody clothes and shottie smoke till their melon is red
In the streets my name hold weight like elephant legs
I'm a projects boy
Crooper's P's be here

You can call it the hood
Call it the ghetto, call it the gutter, call it the slum
I'm callin' it home

This trouble is all I know so that's all I write (Listen)
My family my friends, we are not all alright (Nope)
So when I pick up this mic, I rhyme with all of my might
I'm from the projects boy (What)
I'm from the projects boy (What)
If you ain't from there, listen close, I'll drop some knowledge boy
See I ain't got to listen close
You make a lot of noise
I hear your whole conversation
Every word
The project walls thinner than my Blackberry Curve
When I was young my moms and pops got on my every nerve
With all that arguin' until that check hit
And them food stamps held them down like a TEC clip
Then daddy made an exit
Mommy couldn't accept it
In and out the crib for that next hit

Ice is back I got a brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly

And to the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle

You better hit the bull's eye, the kid don't play
And if there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it

Take heed, Cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, That created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
Cause my style is like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and know you wanna step with this
Swamp plays on the fade, slice like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast, other DJ's say ""damn""
If a rhyme was a drug, you know i'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic and when I kick my juice
And if there was a problem, you know that I would solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Most of the family Christian, but most of the homies Muslim
Me and him talking while I'm puffing, so I'm nothing
This is my dream: when I'm a sleep, that's reality
No formalities, back to the essence gradually
I don't trust religion, it's a few people mad at me
See you on the other side where we could build happily
I stay low, but I roll so high
I don't need new friends, 'til some old ones die
I seen a dollar bill could make close friends part
That's why I love Louch and Kiss, those's both my hearts
Brothers from other mothers, other fathers, but same Father
Put the hoodies on, fuck the umbrellas, let it rain on us
We could tell you that the sun gon' shine
But if you in a dark alley, the chrome gun gon' shine
You could see it, even fake jewels shine
That's why the industry niggas'll let the fake dudes sign
I ain't bitter cause the shit is so sweet
I had nightmares of drowning cause my shit is so deep
Probably from the ocean floor, but I'm a fire sign
Yeah I'm on my sad shit, breaking down the ghost of y'all

Sun vs Moon,Sage Francis,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","The devil only exists because of your belief in him
Same goes for that other guy
I believe the sun is simply reflecting the shine from the moon (word?)
Stealing its spotlight, they'll have a cockfight at noon
To settle their differences
At midnight, rematch
To stir up their similarities on turntables
That chicken scratch proved to be unreadable
The determining factor in who gets the pitch to control the tides
No one decides a victor unless they give a fair listen to both the sides
We're low-lives
We go blind jerking off to the eclipse
The sun was pulling cheap shots doing commercial body tricks
Behind the back, Under the leg
I think he even did a headspin
On a crossfader that sounded whack, But looked excellent
All of the sudden it gets dim
The crater face steps in
Puts Mexican drumbreaks on the Technics
He's like ""Let's begin""
He conducted an orchestra so dope the sun started sweatin' him
I guess he'd expected to win on pure artistic merit
Composing complex plays with nothing but soundbytes
Burned out the lights
Made MCs too self conscious to put their mouths to mics
For a thousand nights
It continued without a single slip up
Except once the record skipped
But it kinda sounded cool
And fit within the rhythm he was juggling
Polyrhythms out of country western albums spinning
It is plain that he had come to win
But as always due to corrupt judging
They drew a tie - Now it's do or die
The sun was like
No no no
But the moon was like
Go go go
(repeat x3)

And when the sun was chosen
I came to the conclusion
His dad doesn't know what he's doin'

God's not a woman
He's a big white guy in the sky
And the deserts are reflections of his eyes
He doesn't cry for us
But when he does
It's cause he's drunk
(Say What?)
God's not a woman
He's a big white guy in the sky
And the deserts are reflections of his eyes
He doesn't cry for us
But when he does
It's cause he's drunk
And he's always fucked up
Bottoms up
God's not a woman
He's a bitch

Praise Jesus Christ
Do everything the Bible tells you to
Love thy neighbor
Do not murder anybody)

Shit, pussy

This is one hand clapping alone
This is the smallest violin, (violin)
Run rabbit when they fight to kill your baddest poem
The devil is the fucking white man
This is one hand clapping alone
This is the smallest violin, (violin)
Run rabbit when they fight to kill your baddest poem
The white man (the white man)
Run rabbit when they fight to kill your baddest poem
The white man (the white man)"
The Buzz Kill,Sage Francis,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Recorded Voice]
You are listening to the heartbeat of the Sage
Sage posses the newest and most revolutionary advance in split-second presentation
As well as split-second calculation
To protect the future of America
The defense techniques of tomorrow had to be discovered now
But Sage needed more than this
New concepts, new tools, new weapons
By analyzing the past, Sage can project into the future

[Sage Francis: Verse I]
I used to think that rappers had it figured out
Brass Monkey, St. Ides, Olde English, and Guinness Stout
Once a man, twice a boy with a choice of vice, a voice of spite
Not enough poisons to pick to enjoy this life
Man, I thought suicide was a suburban myth
I couldn't see my own hands being the ones I'm murdered with
That is until I traveled this world a bit
I understand now if I lose my nerve I'll get the girl to do it!
She heard the music but preferred the person--she's worth it
The only one I let behind the curtain to work with
Pushin' buttons and playin' with levers
We'll stay together as long as I'm modest in my songs
Radio - suckers never play this
Scared shitless of dismissing Clear Channel playlists
Poorly developed, yet highly advanced
The black music intertwined with a white man's line dance
[Recorded Voice]
Supersonic, super destructive, seemingly unresistable
On the job around the clock, with 24-hour-a-day reliability
Constantly monitoring, pulse-taking, controlling
Into a continuous flow of interpretations, which could be understood at a glance

[Sage Francis: Verse II]
It's not lonely on top
I'm kept busy with shivers and cold shakes
Sitting on snowbanks
Waving to be delivered some soulmates
So I wait/weight
Lift and test my faith on several levels
Build my body till they send me an empty face with the head of devils
My breath resembles the smell of flowers
Yanked from life and placed in a vase
Sits and wilts and rots and dies in the name of grave mistakes
That we all make
Believe we're getting by treating ourselves wrong
Throw me a reindeer John letter party
And I'll be there with bells on
Hell spawned some iffy calls in City Hall
They still got the gall
To blame the vitriol on Biggie Smalls
From strip malls
To strip clubs
They slip drugs
Into the drinks that kids love
Tell us to drink up and get buzzed
This is the buzz kill, jump into the saddle
Emerge from the dust kicked up in the uphill battle
With my guns drawn and sword out
Pointed towards the courthouse
I sort out words from my war-torn mouth
I disassociate the actions with their meanings
On some ""ends justify the means"" mentality
Plus I'm bleeding
Give me a Band-Aid, a band that can't play
A fanbase with hearing aids and a voice like a hand grenade
I pull the wool over their vision
Pull the pin and push it in 'em
I'm using women as a pin cushion
A supervillain
With some warpaint and jokes done in poor taste
We'll see who laughs last, all the way to foreign banks
[Recorded Voice]
Ready to take over in a matter of seconds
To protect the future of America
Sage also has protection too
(Come on, come on, feel it, feel it)
The protection which comes with the possesion of weapons of retaliation
But is this protection enough?

[Sage Francis: Verse III]
(I was) I was B-boyin' in my former body
Singing all the songs at parties
Now I'm like, ""Don't let nobody
Through the door in the hotel lobby!""
I'd wear Armani if they endorsed me
So people who are poor can rob me
Then forcefully sex me up
Color me confused when they paint issues black and white
Resuscitate their gray matter right back to life
It's my destiny, she wants me, she beckons
She left me for dead but Death didn't want no sloppy seconds
I'm certified fresh
I freedom-kiss the French for their political dissent
Like mwah/moi
I do it with tongue this time
And take that bovine blood out your wine
And take that statue back to the lab it was created at
Your huddled masses yearning to breath free
Take 'em back!
Your homeless, tempest-tost to me
Take 'em back!
The U-S-A has cracked
[Recorded Voice]
And as long as we're on guard
As long as we're ready to look ahead
To move ahead
The future of America is secure"

And da E&J got me pissy like a baby
I was fuckin' with these twins gettin' crazy ends
Robbin' jewelry stores for the cash and the gems
Identical bastards on some fast shit
Tried to stash it
Took the nine plastic, had they fam on some sad shit

My conscience buggin'
Filled wit all the bad memories
I'm visionin' dead enemies tryin' ta kill me
In my sleep, same niggas dat I put to rest
Got me wakin' up pourin' down a hella sweat
The drugs got a nigga high and I can't explain
Tye and skunk playin' tricks on my fuckin' brain
Shit is strange cause I know deez muthafuckas dead
You see the murder still flash back in my head

Smokin' dat denk, sippin' dat drink

Nigga it's dark, it's hard for me ta fuckin' see

Larceny, bent on da marijuana trees
Murder conracts
Collectin' C note stacks, I react
And push the niggas shit back (uh huh)

'Till they hung my picture, wanted on a poster
I pack two poc'd Glocks, fuck the holsters
Neva new this lil' G would get the most of
Robbin and stealin', then led to killin'
Makin' a livin'
Offa muthafuckin' drug dealin'
Then came beef, The Snakes was wanted in the streets
Shit got hot, my other half did a creep
Handled his business cause he was on his third body
Then laid low wit dis freak ass hottie

[Verse 4: Trife]
Eye of da Snakes
Watch for fakes and jakes
Blood money I make, transactions up state
Sparkin' weed and drinkin'
The buddha still got me thinkin'
Thoughts o' death and all the bodies that I left
Face down, you know the routine for the cream
Means necessary
Cock suckas got buried
Nigga raise up or get blazed up
Who be da one lastin'
Cock the fifth and start blastin'
Try me
Die instantly, a couple o' shots is all it takes
Aim slugs to ya face
Perpetrator fraud, I kill you and ya broad
Got yo ass wishin' you was out dis position
Listen, the ganja have me on a mission
Stick the clip in

Del Vec was set with the Lex and diamond rings
Pop Moët with my bitch when it rain
Drink away the pain, got mad stress on my brain
A little nigga roll for dough
Copped keys across seas, in San Domingo
From a Cuban kid named Sallio, sell mad perico
Coppin' bout four bricks, then I called Nino
Meet me at the airport, feds is on the stalk
I almost got caught cause the dumb bitch talked
How much you make and what we do and where we live at
How much my V cost and where my cash stash at
But the feds still couldn't get nuttin'

My rhymes, somewhat Shakespearean, blood I'm smearin' in
Tongue-kissin' my lawyer, at my hearin' and
In this day and age, my rap is like the plague
I married this shit, y'all niggas still engaged
Turn blowouts to 360 waves
How does 12 gauge feel sittin' on ya tongue, on ya lips 'n'
Dippin' with money L in the green Beamer
Sippin' Zima's, on our way to see Katrina
She said she need a Freak Like Me, like Adina
Fucked her by mistake she had a twin named Regina

My style's knock-kneed plum crazy (what?)
Who's that wild ass motherfucker catchin' wreck
Stickin' Jamaicans for sound sets outside discotheques
It's Klep the death specialist, Stallone and Stone shit
Stayin' high representin' for the nine-quint
Ras bad guy, burns the house down like Left Eye
Why try mimic? MC's get broke like speed limits (uhh)
Niggas can't fuck with my metaphors

Windows cracked, so sit back relax
Yo Vec, crush the hash, the Beretta's in the stash

Indecisive thoughts make sentences get dealt
Money makes the world go round, robbin' shit
Fuck a job shit, niggas want cribs, bricks and spliffs
All-wheel automobiles, traction control
For clay roads, rollin' with dough, kickin' game
On the cell with bitches on hold, that's how we roll (uhh)
Rhymes now tight as hell so to the bank I stroll (uhh)
Money on my mind, open lips from my eyes
Reveal pupils shaped like dollar signs --

Niggas frontin', feelin' twelve gauge pellets
B.I.G. is repellent, to all that ""He say, she say""
We play, Russian roulette, fuck the threat
Your whole crew's vagina, you and your co-signer

Three G's in the stash, see we love the cash
More coke to make some more

Niggas don't know bout my game, they don't know
How complex it is, baggin' bitches in GS 300 Lexuses
And the sex is for summer sports
Passports for drug transports to remote resorts
Bitches with Donna Karan ""Catwoman"" suits, matchin' figure boots
Haircut cute, on tops and garters like prostitutes
My lyrics explicit
Got bitches bringin' they own condoms on the first visit

Backin' bitch niggas down, burners bring bundles of belief
Common thief, slash drug chief, syndicated
Went from 10 K, to 24 K and motherfuckers hate it

[Verse]
I got so much money, I can buy the world another god
I got so much money, I can try to find a scripture
That God wouldn't mind listenin' to
To remind him that I'm livin' proof that
Listenin' to dude ain't even fishin', is it?
So he slaved me, yet, while I trust him
I never rush, I stay in bed with percussion
Playin' the head of a dungeon, and you're done in
I got so much money I made somethin' buy somethin'
I'm somethin' else, but C will never take a L
Levitatin' well, hell is bakin' well
Celibate to self, cause jail is just for jealous lovers
So in your head I'm smothered, music the bread and butter
And I am never a sucker, I get sucked on
Get up, get gone, or just puff on the chron'
Kiss, touch, quick hug, get a sucker for you
Whatever lollipops traditionally signify
The spittin' bully, fully semi, or just really bright
Simplified, till soldiers get in any time
Minutes with the women, get in the ride, and give 'em mine
Oh yeah, gender time, change it, or sit and recline
Well, none of my women are a five
And for a few months, I was livin' with two guys
One is a player, and the other is a white boy
None of them like boys, so I made the right choice
Like
(C-C-C-C-C-C-H-A-R
H-A-M-I spitting like a semi
Spitting like- spittin'-spittin'-spittin' like a semi)
A yo how much time I got left?
Fuck it

[Verse 2]
I don't know how much time is left on the clock
Accept it or not, I'm better than most
So I just suggest that you watch your watch
Watch the seconds go
And watch how I spit the most reckless flow
Y'all niggas need to eat your breakfast 'fore I slit your throat
You won't be able to digest the message
Even if I left you know that
You ain't even worth the hair on testicles
From a fucking monkey I'm a ex-junkie
And I make ya ex a junkie
When I stick it in her fucking funky monkey
And I be smacking her donkey
I'm an ass though
And I refuse to be categorized as asshole
Cause I'm the shit
Y'all niggas ain't Charmin
Ya mis-pronouncing this shit cause I'm CHARMING

Strugglin,K'naan,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","(Intro: K'naan)
Yeah, yeah, it's me, strugglin'

[Verse 1: K'naan]
I start out, just to vibe out
I ain't about to bow out
I'm more gangsta than you are
But I ain't about the rou' rou'
My season will come, it has to
Honestly I feel like I'm ten months pregnant or something
I'm passed due. Sincerely I'm touchy these days
I can't take nothing, I'm tryna treat my record like the law
Shit, I'm dying to break something
And mostly, I'm up and stressin'
When other folks sleep
Believe me, I know struggle, and struggle knows me
My life owes me, like an overdose
I'm slowly, drifting in the arms of trouble
Then trouble holds me
And nothing else is close to me
More than pain unfortunately
Like a self fulfilling prophecy, I'm suppose to be
(Hook X2)
Strugglin', and it's trouble in
In this circumstance I'm dwelling in
I find myself in the corner huddling
With some angry men and I gotta settle shit again
Before they gotta kill again

[Verse 2: K'naan]
I should be chillin' on beaches
Instead my bone freezes
Ducking Glocks and I walks
Sort of like Jesus
The realest thing for me is
Since I was a fetus
The only break I ever got, was at recess
So legitimately, I remain very little relieved
Then at thug rappers I remain very little intrigued
Can you blame me?
Look how we lived in the late eighties
Throwing rocks at the crazy ladies
And when we'd play these
Crazy games, the whole crew had crazy names
We even had a cripple we use to call em lazy legs
But my faith remains, untouched and unchanged
Still in my block you hear more shots than a gun range
I'm
(Hook X2)

[Verse 3: K'naan]
Aight aight, more to the truth
No writing, just recording in the booth
Forced by the loop and the guitar but I'm the boss of the groove
I speak truth my deep roots remain in equal danger
The pain on my song is crazy but the sequel is stranger
Hey man, I'm from the hardest heartless projects
Dared departed I'm now known as a recording artist
Spilling what little remains of your memories in the process
Bitter a little, but making your names into a colossus
Believe me, I'm thankful my brother's still with me
And ain't much changed Bobby is still troubling Whitney
And Bush is still bombing poor people yo he's deadly
And me I got a little recording gig but evidently I'm

(What's up, world, beautiful people, boys and girls? We 'bout to take you on a journey. My man, why don't you introduce yo'self to the people?)
""Salaam"" means peace, peace is good. This is K'naan, the Dusty Foot Philosopher. Yo, join me on my journey: this is music - my music - and interpretations of other musics that I enjoy and love. And um, this is called ""My Life is a Movie,"" this whole record. But this song, the first one, is called ""Smile."" You know, an integral part of our community...we smile while we bleedin', you know. Check it out

[Verse 1]
Ah-uuuuuuhh, ah-uuuuuuhh, ah-uuuuuuhh
Yeah
My tragedy's different
My life's deep, listen
Gotta bail, I'm limpin
Walked outta hell's kitchen
Why bother cherishin'
My past is everything, wrong, and my arrogance
Walk down the stairs pissin'
Cop us cause they're bitchin'
Life isnt fair, singin'
Blues and my rap drippin'
Ooze out the blood sinkin'
Deep down to earth thinking
Leave out a nerp chicken
I should run forfeiting everything I know, Listen!
I was The misdirected
I was The least expected
Hop on And get rejected
Walk on And feel neglected
I feel Like I'm the message
Unheard But I'm the message
I'm the last prolific remaining author from the gutter

Shot was my girlfriend
When we was younger
Her, I was scarred yo
Bullets I survived though
Death It's came easy
Truth the games needs me
Never let them see me down, smile while I'm bleeding

Never let 'em see you down, smile while you bleedin'

To my man curently in prison
I can't speak your name
It hurt me that you never listened
It can't be the same
I had to grow my intuition had me deep in pain
Cause I knew my options were either broke or the prison chains
I can't do it
I can't see it, look
Damnit, I can't blow it
I got a judge tellin me my lifes key
They will throw it
Nuh-uh, no sir
I plan to have a chauffeur
It seems to me this chopping crack is really going no where
Therefore I'm resurrected They call me
The poor Injection
I infect you with the real
The Dustyfeetphilosahectagos
I spit, so sick I skid out
Im fallin'I'm Shit outta luck and I'm trapped but ill get out

My fists bloody and blistered a pair like im balistic
I just stare at the red and smile while im bleedin

[Verse 3]
There are a few things you gotta take into account
I'm not an entertainer, I've never been a clown
I was born where the mothers give birth while they frown
I'd walk with the kids that would bbbrrraaaa a sound, uh
I never really thought I'd make it to fourteen
And anybody wanted to fight, I was most keen
Plus I had a little temper, it was often foreseen
Yo, say somethin' bout my momma I'd shoot ya gut out clean
But, uh, ya gotta keep in mind that I grew up in Mogadishu
The only law was gun law, and we don't walk with a pistol
You get laughed at for being so insensitive to the environment
Cause how will you be heard when them big boys is firin'?
War is no place for a child
Especially if he's rollin' with an AK and a smile
He had witnessed his own mother bloody in a towel
But please, please, never let 'em see you down, smile while you bleedin'

Take A Minute,K'naan,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
And any man who knows a thing
Knows he knows not a damn, damn thing at all
And every time I felt the hurting
I felt the giving getting me up off the wall
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it ride
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it breeze
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it ride
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it breeze

[Verse 1: K'naan]
How did Mandela get the will to surpass the everyday
When injustice had him caged and trapped in every way?
How did Gandhi ever withstand the hunger strikes and all?
Didn't do it to gain power or money if I recall
It's to give, I guess I'll pass it on
Mother thinks it'll lift the stress of Babylon
My mother knows; my mother, she suffered blows
I don't know how we survived such violent episodes
I was so worried, it hurt to see you bleed
But as soon as you came out the hospital, you gave me sweets, yeah
They tried to take you from me but you still only gave 'em some prayers and sympathy
Dear Mama, you helped me write this
By showing me to give is priceless
[Chorus]
And any man who knows a thing
Knows he knows not a damn, damn thing at all
And every time I felt the hurting
I felt the giving getting me up off the wall
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it ride
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it breeze
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it ride
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it breeze

[Verse 2: K'naan]
All I can say is the worst is over now
We can serve the hard times, divorce, it's over now
They try to keep us out but the doors is open now
My nigga Akon is getting awards and covers now
This is K'naan, and still repping the S
Coming out of Mogadishu and still draped in the mess
And no matter how we strong homie
It ain't easy coming out of where we from, homie
And it's the reason why I can never play for me
""Tell 'em the truth"" is what my dead homies told me, ooh, yeah
I take inspiration from the most heinous of situations
Creating medication out my own tribulations
Dear Africa, you helped me write this
By showing me to give is priceless
[Chorus]
And any man who knows a thing
Knows he knows not a damn, damn thing at all
And every time I felt the hurting
I felt the giving getting me up off the wall

I'm just gonna take a minute and let it ride

Fit but You Know It,The Streets,"['alternative', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Teddy Mitchell]
Excuse me, girl
I know it's a bit embarrassing but I just noticed some tan lines
On your shirt

[Verse 1: Mike Skinner]
See, I reckon you're about an eight or a nine
Maybe even nine and a half in four beers' time
That blue Topshop top you've got on, it is nice
Bit too much fake tan, though, but yeah, you score high
But there's just one little thing that's really, really
Really, really annoying me about you, you see
Yeah, yeah, like I said, you are really fit
But my gosh, don't you just know it?

[Chorus: Teddy Mitchell]
I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?
[Verse 2: Mike Skinner]
So when I looked at you standing there with your horde
I was waiting in the queue, looking at the board
Wondering whether to have a burger or chips
Or what the shrapnel in my back pocket could afford
When I noticed out the corner of my eye
Looking toward my direction, your eyes locked on my course
I couldn't concentrate on what I wanted to order
Which lost me my place in the queue I waited for, yeah

[Chorus: Teddy Mitchell]
I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

[Bridge: Mike Skinner & Teddy Mitchell]
Whoa! (Leave it out)
Are you smoking crack or something? (Leave it out)
Mike, just leave it, just leave it
We cannot have that behaviour in this establishment (Leave it out)
It's not worth it, Mike, just leave it
Don't touch me
It's not worth it
Don't touch me (Leave it out)
Don't t—look, I'm alright, don't touch me
[Verse 3: Mike Skinner]
For a while there I was thinking, ""Yeah, but, what if?""
Picturing myself pulling with bare white hot wit
Snaring you as you were standing there opposite
Whether or not you knew it, I swear you didn't tick
And when that bloke in the white behind us lot queuing
Was clocking onto you too, yeah, I had to admit
That yeah, yeah, you are fit and yeah, I do want it
But I stop sharking a minute to get chips and drinks

[Chorus: Teddy Mitchell]
I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

[Verse 4: Mike Skinner]
Now, I bashed my head hard earlier due to the brew
But I am digressing slightly, so I’ll continue
I didn’t want to bowl over all geezer and rude
Not rude like 'good', but just rude like 'uncouth'
You girls think you can just flirt and it comes to you
Well, let me tell you, see, yes, yes, you are really rude
And rude as in 'good', I knew this as you stood and queued
But I just did not wanna give this satisfaction to you
[Chorus: Teddy Mitchell]
I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

[Verse 5: Mike Skinner]
Oi, and just as you started to make your big advance
With the milkshake and that little doughnut in hand
I was like, nah, I can't, even though you look grand
But you look sharp there, smiling hard, suggesting and
Gleaming away with your hearty, hearty-looking tan
But I admit the next bit was spanner to my plan
You walked towards my path but you just brushed right past
And into the arms of that fucking white-shirted man

[Chorus: Teddy Mitchell]
I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

[Verse 6: Mike Skinner & Teddy Mitchell]
Oh, oi, what do I give a fuck? I've got a girlfriend anyway
(Whoa, we've all had a drink, mate...)
We're all a bit drunk, we've had a few, fair play
I got this Stella I bummed from that last cafe
This night's not even begun, yes, yes, oh yay
I did fancy you a bit, though, yeah, I must say
I would rather I hadn't mugged myself on display
But this is just another case of female stopping play
In an otherwise total result of a holiday

[Chorus: Teddy Mitchell]
I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

[Outro: Teddy Mitchell & Mike Skinner]
Haha, huh, huh, huh
You're fit but you know it
You're fit but you know it
You're fit but you know it

I think I'm going to fall o–

First, I'm gonna take a dive into the water
Deep until I know I pleased that body, body, ah-ooh
Or, girl, without a broom, I might just sweep you off your feet
And make you wanna tell somebody, body how I do
Or maybe we can float on top my waterbed
You close your eyes as I improv between yo' legs
We work our way from kitchen stoves and tables
Girl, you know I'm more than able to please, yeah
Say you wanted flowers on the bed
But you got me and hours on the bed

And I’m all tatted up, dat bang in my trunk
Everybody in ma city show me love
Because I got my speakers going hammer, bammer-bammer-bammer

[Verse 1]
My speakers out of space like ET
Cops watch me all day like TV
SOD hit the club, we be so deep
Mayne I'm deep in the game I grind like a OG
I got 12 diamond chains like a OZ
Follow me like the Wizard of Oz
Girls love my style cause it is so neat
Ask about me in the streets I spit so heat
Ain’t nobody in the game messing with my clique
Style swift hot like it’s July 10th
Fly chick in my whip with nice tits
Her boyfriend paid for it, I didn’t
Ice game, cold as a polar bear
Sun hit my chain, watch it make a solar flare
We gettin' money over here hands in the air
Y'all making it too easy, it’s not fair

Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop, man, I tried the best I could
But you make me smile

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Etta James]
What's your addiction? Is it money? Is it girls? Is it weed?
I've been afflicted by not one, not two, but all three
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us
She's coming over, so I guess, that means, I'm her drugs
(You make me smile)
Just let me peek now, I mean, damn, I'm so curious
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush
Time's of the essence, I need you to be spontaneous
Roll up the doja, Henny and Co-Co-Coca-Cola
(You make me smile with my heart, ohh)
Then I'm co-coming over 'cause it's ne-never over

Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop, man, I tried the best I could
But you make me smile

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Etta James]
I see the emotion in your eyes, that you try not to show
We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blown
So I pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could go
Then I'll get the lotion, and do somethin' to me, when your thighs is exposed (You make me smile)
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose
Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed
Roll up the doja, Henny and Co-Co-Coca Cola
(You make me smile with my heart)
And I keep co-coming over 'cause it's ne-never over

Just wanted to um, let me, how would I put this, uhh
Let's say, all your friends, remember the one
You said, if you ever, she would be the one
Okay, okay, okay (You make me smile with my heart)
Well, I was thinking, hypothetically
I mean, don't take this seriously
Don't take me, I mean, just, uhh, not credibly
I'm feeling incredibly, I mean, let's let it be
I just let it be

Hometown,Chop,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: Adele]
'round my hometown
Memories are fresh
'round my hometown
Ooh, the people I’ve met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world

[Verse 1: Chop]
In my hometown, blocks real, young shottas pop steel
Hop rails, just to get away, fuck how a cop feel
Watching over boiling pots, spot getting hot, still
Learning how them shots feel, Redzone rock here
The impossible, Portsmouth, I got you too
You'll never catch me hurting up in Murderview Hospital
Hometown, hold it down, carry it to Harbour View
Fitted and a scarf on, the tourist crowd coming through
On the strip, passing hoods, Shmack jeans, VA goods
Car full of backwoods, yelling, “free my nigga Smug”
Been here, so what, since Princess Anne burned up
Jersey boy, but VA was mostly where my home was
You know us, when we coming like we stole something
We on the east coast though, but yet we so southern
Timbaland, Star Trak, my hometown getting that
Took Peddlers down, needa bring it back, where we at?
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chop]
In my hometown, sirens flaring, little kids stay staring
Walking everywhere careless, like they had no parents
Bennets Creek cook out, hot days, look out
Arizona's Brooklyn Style, rob BP's for good amounts
Waterside, get it popping, chilling up at MacArthur
Or in LynnHaven Mall, Chesapeake Square's garbage
Shot at, barely made it, welling hard, nothing grazed 'em
Peppermint backed up, lines get me so impatient
Walking to the bus stop, HRT fill the block
City cops, yelling ""R.I.P"" to my nigga Rock
7-11's everywhere, warehouse with every gear
264-East, in VA Beach every year
Afram festival, they needa free my nigga Vick
Bad news, Suffolk shit, Airline riding shit
Family, stay filling, Clipse or Pharrel Williams
Seven cities on the fitted, Chesapeake is in the building

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chop]
For my dudes that ride for me, know Chop got ya back
Affiliate with A-List, put Chesapeake up on the map
Beach Girls, I'm hitting that, yo, fuck Western Branch
Resurrect the rap scene, for my dudes selling crack
Smoke strong, go hard for my fam that died
Never knew Tennessee but we spoke a few times
R.I., R.I.P. homie, move in silence but they know me
Everybody claim hard, I choose my whole circle closely
And I'm falling in love with these girls out here
And I'm falling in love with the world out here
I don't know too much about the world in whole
But I do know VA's my home, my own
Safe haven, mistaken for weak, face it
We keep shaking, the globe with every statement
VA made me, tougher and bitter
For everybody that I remember, let's get it
Loyal before anything else, what that means
Put Virginia on my back like mattress springs
Too many hate, positive by any means
And you know I'm going hard just to grasp my dream"
Pray,JAY-Z,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Beyoncé]
Deliver me from my enemies, oh God
Defend me from all that rise up against me
Deliver me from the work of iniquity
And save me from the Bloody Men

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Look, mind state of a gangster from the 40s
Meets the business mind of Motown's Berry Gordy
Turned crack rock into a chain of 40/40's
Sorry, my jewelry's so gaudy
Slid into the party with my new pair of Mauris
America, meet the gangster Shawn Corey
""Hey, Young World,"" wanna hear a story?
Close your eyes and you can pretend you're me
I'm cut from the cloth of the Kennedys
Frank Sinatra having dinner with the Genovese
This is the genesis of a nemesis
Mother America's not witnessed since
The Harlem Renaissance birthed Black businesses
This is the tale of lost innocence
As the incense burn
And the turntables turn and that Al Green plays
I see my mother's afro
As Mama taps her toes, as she rolls her J's
And my papa just left the house
In search of the killer of my Uncle Ray
And she's trying to calm her nerves
As I observe, this is just one day
And what tomorrow has in store, we can never be sure
So all we can do is pray
[Break: Beyoncé]
Because of your strength
While I walked upon thee
For God is my defense
Pray for me!

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
As I head to my homeroom
I observe the ruins, dope needles on the ground
I hear a car go, ""Vroom""
Drug dealer in the BM with the top down
As the girls start to giggle
I ask, ""Why you laugh?"" They say, ""You're too little""
""One day, you'll understand when you become a man
About things you have to get you""
Fast-forward, freeze-frame on my pistol
Fistful of dollars, ignorance is so blissful
I didn't choose this life, this life chose me
Around here, it's the shit that you just do
I just left school
The same BM is pulled over by the boys dressed blue
They had their guns drawn, screaming, ""Just move!"" (""Don't move!"")
""Or is there something else you suggest we can do?""
He made his way to the trunk, opened it like, ""Huh?""
A treasure chest was removed
Cops said he'll be back next month
What we call corrupt, he calls paying dues
Now, when the rules is blurred—
As they is and were—what am I to do?
But pray? Pray the Lord forgive me
Pray He guides me by for what I'm 'bout to go through
Pray
[Break: Beyoncé]
Deliver me in thy righteousness
And cause me to escape
And climb thine air unto me
Save me thine Lord (pray for me!)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Geah... Anywhere there's oppression
The drug profession flourishes like beverages, refreshing
Ahh! Sweet taste of sin
Everything I seen made me everything I am
Bad drug dealer or victim, I beg
What came first? Moving chickens or the egg?
This is why I be so fresh
I'm tryna beat life 'cause I can't cheat death
Treat shame with shamelessness
Aim stainlesses at anuses
You know the game this is?
Move coke like Pepsi, don't matter what the brand name is
I stand behind mine
Everything I do, I'm a man behind mine
I'm not an angel, I'm sure
But every night before I lay, I drop my knees to the floor
And I pray

[Outro: Beyoncé]
The name shall endure forever
The name shall be continued as long as the sun
Pray for me!
Men shall be blessed in Him
All nations shall call Him blessed
In Your name, I pray
Pray for me!
Lord bless us"

And watch how we roll up, and
I can't control it, can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazing is how I keep blazing
Towel under the door, we smoke until the day's end
Puff-puff, then pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now, nigga, that's a chaser
Turn nothing to something, now, pimping, that's a savior
Best things are green, now, pimpin', get your paper
High off the ground, from stair to skyscraper
Cool out, thinking we local, c'mon, homie, we major

Feeling better than some head on a Sunday afternoon
Better than a chick that say ""Yes"" too soon
Until you have a daughter; that's what I call karma
And you pray to God she don't grow breasts too soon
Projects tore up, gang signs is thrown up
Niggas hats broke off, that's how we grow up
Why else you think shorties write rhymes? Just to blow up?
Get they first car and then, IRS show up
He ain't never had shit, but he had that nine
Nigga come through flicking and he had that shine
Put two and two together and a little bad weather
Gon' be your whole family on that funeral line
Asked the reverend, ""Was the strip clubs cool?
If my tips helped send a pretty girl through school?""
That's all I want, like winos want they good whiskey

I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write
First line—should it be about the hoes or the ice?
Four-fours or Black Christ? Both flows'd be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man plight
At the studio console, asked my man to the right
""What this verse sound like? Should I freestyle or write?
He said, ""Nas, what the fans want is Illmatic, still""
Looked at the pad and pencil, and jotted what I feel
Been like twelve years since a nigga first signed
Now, I'm a free agent, and I'm thinking it's time
To build my very own Motown
'Cause rappers be deprived of executive nine-to-fives
And it hurts to see these companies be stealing the life
And I love to give my blood, sweat and tears to the mic
So y'all copped the LPs and y'all fiends got dealt
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony when King got killed
I survived the livest niggas around

A lot deserve the finer things in life and I think your one of them (Ayy)
Money ain't shit, got loads to blow (Ayy)
Show me a signal, let me know (Ayy)
If you wanna have a better life, then, baby, you know where to go
It's comin' in quick, it ain't flowin' in slow (Oh)
Like I said, let me know
If Weezy made it rain (Yeah, yeah), I can make it snow (Ayy)

[Chorus: Dappy & Tulisa]
Girls, I'm loving them (Yeah)
But I won't let them get the best of me
Girls, I'm loving them (Yeah)
I get them all around the world
What would I do without you?
What would you do without me?
Don't need to tell you, baby
'Cause it's plain for us to see tonight
Girls, I'm lovin' them
Girls, girls, girls
[Verse 2: Tulisa & Dappy]
Guys, I fuck with them (Yeah)
They be pingin' off my phone, tellin' me they all alone (Yeah)
But they sittin' in at home while I'm out tryna get that dough
And that's why they call me the baddest bitch 'cause I switch up the roles
I'm the one that drives them crazy, they all wish I was their lady
But I'm earnin' more than them, and they say, ""Yeah, that bitch is crazy""
I am the (What?) biggest female boss that ever lived (Yeah)
And everythin' that you done, I've been and did (Oh)

[Chorus: Dappy & Tulisa]
Girls, I'm loving them (Yeah)
But I won't let them get the best of me
Girls, I'm loving them (Yeah)
I get them all around the world
What would I do without you?
What would you do without me?
Don't need to tell you, baby
'Cause it's plain for us to see tonight
Girls, I'm lovin' them
Girls, girls, girls

[Verse 3: Fazer, Fazer & Dappy, Dappy, Tulisa]
When your girlfriend says she's on her way
And you're starin' at the clock in frustration
Thinkin', ""Why is she so late?""
I just can't live without them (Yeah)
They'll break your heart, don't doubt them
I'm the reason why she's never comin' back
Simply can't leave me around them
Girls, I fuck with them
I tell them anythin' they wanna hear so by the end of the night
I'm fuckin' them
Guys, I fuck with them (Yeah, yeah)
And I know they all gas, act like Mariah
But you know what? I'm in love with them (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Chorus: Dappy & Tulisa]
Girls, I'm loving them (Yeah, woah)
But I won't let them get the best of me
Girls, I'm loving them (Yeah)
I get them all around the world
What would I do without you?
What would you do without me?
Don't need to tell you, baby
'Cause it's plain for us to see tonight
Girls, I'm lovin' them
Girls, girls, girls"
Astronomy 8th Light,Black Star,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Mos Def & Talib Kweli]
Haha
Against the canvas of the night
Appears a curious celestial phenomenon, called Black Star
But what is it?
Black people; unite and let's all get down
We got to have what? We got to have that love

[Verse 1: Mos Def & Talib Kweli & Both]
What is the Black Star?
Is it the cat with the black shades, the black car?
Is it shinin' from very far to where you are?
It is commonplace and different
Intimate and distant, fresher than an infant
Black, my family thick like that-strap molasses
Star on the rise in the eyes of the masses
Black is the color of my true love's hair
Stars are bright, shinin', hot balls of air
Black like my baby girl's stare
Black like the veil that the Muslimina wear
Black like the planet that they fear, why they scared?
Black like the slave ship belly that brought us here
Black like the cheeks that are roadways for tears (Mm)
That leave black faces well traveled with years
Black like assassin cross-hairs
Blacker than my granddaddy armchair
He never really got no time to chill there
'Cause his life was warfare, warfare
See, on the front lines, the Blacks is all there
Black like the perception of who on welfare
Black like faces at the bottom of the well
I've been there before
To bring the light and heat it up like la cocina
Make without imagine happen, but maybe I'm just a dreamer
I love rockin' tracks like John Coltrane love Naima
Like the student love the teacher
Like the prophet love Khadija
Like I love my baby' features
Like the Creator love all creatures!
Who are knowledge, truth and peace seekers?
We on point like heat-seekers
Targetin' the black marketin' strategists
Run up on 'em with the heaters
Everybody followin' with no leaders
Feelin' like we killin' ourselves, because I know they can't defeat us
It don't stop 'til we complete this, keep this fly
There's so much to life when you just stay Black and die
Blacker than the nighttime sky of Bed-Stuy in July
Blacker than the seed in the blackberry pie
Blacker than the middle of my eye
Black like Fela man cry
Some man wan' ask, ""Who am I?""
I simply reply, ""The U.N.I.-V.E.R.S.A.L. Magnetic!""
Work to respect the angelic (Ugh!)
Climb the mountain top and tell it 'til the valley's enveloped
You're full of big chat, but ya nah know me
I'm dark like the side of the moon you don't see
When the moon shine newly
[Hook: Mos Def & Talib Kweli & Both]
You know who else is a Black Star? (Who?) Me
You know who else is a Black Star? (Who?) Me
You know who else is a Black Star? (Who?) We
(And we) Be shinin' and shinin', when we rhymin' and rhymin'
We be shinin' and shinin', when we rhymin' and rhymin'
Now, everybody hop on the one, the sounds of the two
It's the third eye vision, five-side dimension
The 8th Light is gon' shine bright tonight
It's the third eye vision, five-side dimension

[Verse 2: Mos Def & Talib Kweli & Both]
You know the light come from the dark
The other way is ass-backwards
It's absurd, make you wanna crow like a blackbird
That's right, you livin' from your first day to your last night
Sometimes you show your ass like
Lint on your clothes when you froze in the black light
Dead that! Before you get your head wrapped like Badu
We see through your voodoo
Just like Eve's Bayou, you dealin' with that black magic
Try to civilize you, not walk on by you
Like Sybil lies do, get you blacklisted
It'll be unlucky for you like a black cat, a panther
Revolution is the answer; that's what we need
Greed plague my people like the cancer; true, indeed
[Hook: Mos Def & Talib Kweli & Both]
Now, Black people unite, and let's all get down
Now everybody hop on the one, the sounds of the two
It's the third-eye vision, five-side dimension
The 8th light is gon' shine bright tonight (Uh, uh, uh)
Everybody hop on the one, the sounds of the two
It's the third-eye vision, five-side dimension
The 8th light is gon' shine bright tonight
It's the third-eye vision, five-side dimension
Equalin' up to eight, light shine bright

It's the Black [?](3:18) right there!"

Hello, everybody! Recordin' live from somewhere
Looooord... Lord have mercy

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
Yo, from the first to the last of it, delivery is passionate
The whole and not the half of it, forecast and aftermath of it
Projectile that them blasted with, accurate assassin shit
Me and Kweli close like Bethlehem and Nazareth
After this, you be pressin' rewind on top your master disk
Shinin' like an asterisk for all those that be gatherin'
Connectin' like a roundhouse from the townhouse to the tenements
'Cause all my Brooklyn residents roll with heavy regiments
Don't believe? Hear the evidence — where Brooklyn? (WHOA!)
See that? 'Bout to take it all, kid, believe that
From where they sell they tree at, to where the police react
Talib Kweli, e-Kweli-ty, yo, tell 'em where we be at
[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Brooklyn, New York City, where they paint murals of Biggie
In cash we trust, 'cause this ghetto fabulous life look pretty
What a pity — blunts is still fifty cents, it's intense
Tree scents is dominant, can't be covered with incense
My presence felt; my name is Kweli from the Eternal Reflection
People thinkin' MC is shorthand for misconception
Let me meditate, set it straight
Came to the conclusion that most of these cats is featherweight
Let me demonstrate:
Walkin' the streets is like battlin'; be careful with your body
You must know karate and think your soul is bulletproof like Sade
Stop actin' like a bitch already, be a visionary
And maybe you can see your name in the column of obituaries
Third grade teacher readin' and talkin' about, ""I knew he'd amount to nothin'""
Neighbors like, ""He was the quiet type, who'd have thought they was frontin'?""
Talkin' loud like you on RCA
Get carted away with body parts and trays
What a way to start your day, yo, it's like...

[Hook: Mos Def]
One, two, three (C'mon!)
Mos Def and Talib Kweli
We came to rock it on to the tip-top (C'mon!)
Best alliance in hip-hop! Y-O!
I said one, two, three
It's kinda dangerous to be a MC (C'mon!)
They shot 2Pac and Biggie
Too much violence in hip-hop, Y-O
[Verse 3: Mos Def]
I said Manhattan keep on makin' it, Brooklyn keep on takin' it
So relax, we're takin' it back, Red Hook where we're livin' at
Plenty cats be strugglin', not hustlin' and bubblin'
It ain't about production, then — what is we discussin'?
When the cock crows, my crop grows, enable me to rock flows
Strivin' for perfection ever since I was a snot-nose
Colossal! True, original b-boy apostle
Standin' on the rooftop with the Zulu Gestapo

[Verse 4: Talib Kweli]
You think you the shit? Somebody in the wings'll force you to quit
It could be your crew or clique
Or some random kid you smoked buddha with
Consider me the entity within the industry
Without a history of spittin' the epitome of stupidity
Livin' my life, expressin' my liberty, it gotta be done properly
My name is in the middle of equality
People follow me, and other cats, they hear him flow
And assume I'm the real one with the lyrics like I'm Cyrano

[Verse 5: Mos Def]
Still sippin' wishing well water imported from Pluto
Three hundred and sixty milliliters for all the believers
In miles or kilometers, most cats cannot precede us
In the jungle with the leaders — we them lions, you the cheetahs
Our cypher will complete us as we come through your receivers
You can play us and repeat us, and then take us home and read us
(Line for line) Good Jesus! Mos Def and Kweli just
Make the pussy freeze up; think it over, ease up!
[Hook]
One, two, three
Mos Def and Talib Kweli
We came to rock it on to the tip-top
Best alliance in hip-hop! Y-O!

A lawyer couldn't object or disrespect the technique
Sweat me, wipe off the sweat
Fight off the shit, and flush the waste down
The pipes of my life flow deep into the ground
Find my purpose on the surface of this Earth
This planet's standards trust and the purpose
Campaign in vain for the same lame fame you've obtained
You ought to be detained
By the Hip-Hop Sheriff, locked up, no possibility
Of getting out because the shit you make is killing me

Show me the bounce, yeah
Just point out the bounce, geah
Timbo the king, yeah
Young Hov the king, yeah
Just point out the bounce, yes
Just point out the bounce nigga
Yo, listen

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Rumor has it The Blueprint classic
Couldn't even be stopped by Bin Laden
So September 11th marks the era forever
Of a revolutionary Jay Guevara
Now it's a whole museum of Hov MC'ers
Everybody dupin' the flow—you see 'em
Everybody loopin' up soul
It's like they tryna make The Blueprint 2 before Hov
Shout out to Just Bleezy and Kanyeezy
See how we adjust to the game so easy
Chicks barely dancin, glancin every chance they get
Like, ""Oh shit, he's so handsome""
Still in demand in the longest run standing
Kidnapped rap seven years, no ransom
Can't one nigga get it back, no rap
Young Hov's going to Canton, I'ma land ya
[Chorus: Jay-Z]
(Point out the bounce) I'll show you how to get this dough in
Large amounts 'til it's hard to count
(Point out the bounce) I turn a eighth to an ounce
To a whole ki to the R-O-C

Uh-huh, ay, uh
(Point out the bounce) Geah, young Hov the king, nigga
Uh, I got y'all

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
For those that think Hov fingers bling-blingin'
Either haven't heard the album or they don't know English
They only know what the single is
And single that out to be the meaning of what he's about
And being I'm about my business, not mingling much
Running my mouth, that shit kept lingering
But no, dummy, that's the shit I'm sprinkling
The album with to keep the registers ringing
In real life, I'm much more distinguished
I'm like a bloke from London, England
Geah, you jingling, baby
See, I go right back and I bring 'em in baby
Business mind of a Ross Perot but never lost my soul
Crossed the line, I bought pop across the row
Then I walk through the hood, where they up to no good
Slangin them O's like a real OG should
""Oh, he's good""
""No, he would never sell out, he's so hood""

To be down, you must appeal

Ask me, ""Ray-Ray, is that yo' car?""
""I seen MTV, I know who you are""
""You did Takeover, do you got beef with Nas?""

Got tracks to go, got plaques that's gold
Platinum to go, yeah, that's the flow

If All Else Fails,Joe Budden,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro - Joe Budden - talking]
Mic check, one two, one two
This what the fuck I'm talkin about right here though
You ready Parks?

[Verse 1 - Joe Budden]
Check it (woo!), if all else fails, I get back to what I know
Ratchet for my foes (uh), watchin for informants, take a stab at it with snow
Long john jacket for the cold, some habits are hard to outgrow
I work so hard, you think the studio's my lodge inn
If all else fails (what?)
I don't have a doubt that I'd be back in that studio apartment
Gettin it in, closet size living room and the kitchen's my den
Playin lotto, hopin numbers'll save the day
Back to price checking, back to layaways
Since I ain't never hit nothin like a bad fadeaway
Back to the corner, takin a bag of haze to face
Basic flow, when I tried to get my cake to grow (what?)
I hit the pawn shop and turn into Trader Joe
Sheisty kid, yack ya jewels while they glistenin
Snatch the hearing aid from a senior, while they listenin
If all else fail, don't know where I'd be
Scratch that, probably at home, nowhere to be
Or probably fuckin a broad that, I treat like a floor mat
Ugly enough to cover her face when a gauze pad (uh)
And that's a step down from my New York rat
That ride it like a horse back (uh), with the horse back
But it won't fail, so if you try to rob the kid
Banana clips by the bed'll put a stop to it
Nevermind that, first you gotta beat the guard
I can change the channel on my TV and see the yard
If it all failed, I'm ready for the scam
Forgin fake checks screamin �Catch Me If You Can�
If all else fails, I'd be out pullin Jerz capers
Knowin me, I'd be best friends with my worst haters
Uh, I'd be dustin off the AR or be behind state bars, for jackin a bait car
If all failed, I'd be right back in them block cyphers
Just to show these local niggas I'm a lot nicer
Cause the less you succeed, the more you loved for it
While the more you achieve, the more you snubbed for it
If all else failed and my pockets were empty
Everything I despised, I'd probably envy
Ignorant shit rappers floss that offends me
Cause I wouldn't be able to attain it, it would tempt me
Frontin in my man's Maserati
I might bag somethin with a modest body, from a college party
Next morning hungover so she can't remember
I would deck my whole crib out from Rent-A-Center
If all else failed and I ain't get a break yet
I'd get unemployment while collectin a paycheck
Would it mean I wasn't built for the bright lights?
Say goodbye to front row seats at fight night
If it all failed, I'd have a pretty common future
From a Chart House nigga to a Ramen noodler
Would my girl say you no longer attract me
Pack up all her shit and head South with an athlete?
My name would hold no weight, so I'd lose the perks
OD on OxyContin, abuse the percs
I'd be a felon gettin my scriptures tatted on (uh)
First 48 star gettin ratted on
If all else fails, I wouldn't take precaution
New hooptie every month would be my way of flossin
And the crib would be an all night party
With six baby moms, then I'd Jet 'em like Cromartie
Uh, fantasizin the girls I could of dated
Hood referrin to 'em as the one that could of made it
Uh, I'd be the only one who cares
Or am I just recitin my fears as they appear?
Shouldn't of even put the idea in the air
Cause it's not possible, let's make that clear baby (ta)"
All Of Me,Joe Budden,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: Emanny]
I give you my all, but it seems like that's not enough
Now you can get all of me
A lot of things have changed from what I see
Is this the way its supossed to be

[Verse: Joe Budden]
Are you in that mood yet, one mo' 'gain
ARE YOU IN THAT MOOD YET
Look, they say tomorrow's not promised, but if it was I wouldn't get open
Wouldn't get souped, them shit's was made to be broken
'Member comin' up dudes talkin' 'bout hoes, boastin'
I was just a Juvenile movin in slow motion
I dropped outta school to be a dude with mad jewelry
Once I got it shit wasn't even cool to me
I dreamt of condos and video vixens
Until I learned most girls in videos is pigeons
I just wanted the world to see that I was for real with it
Wanted a deal, I got it and couldn't deal with it
I want me and my old homeboys to still kick it
I wish they saw me as Mouse and not a meal ticket
Let the beat play, I wish I could see a day wit no he say, she say, just wanna see Trey
Wanna play the hood and not fuck with the toasters
Middle child, wish me and my brother was closer
I wanna scream at her, catch myself before I start to
And then remember it takes two people to argue
All she do is provoke me, all I do is diss her
All I did was shake her, she say that I hit her
She just takin' everythin' I say out of context
I'm tryin' not to black, I'm like a nigga with a complex
Was mad as a fuck, didn't even show it
Yesterday was better off, didn't even know it
Complete role reversal so it's useless these days
TV got real, music went fake, please help her for God's sake
When I proposed to the game I figured life was merry
Five years later I'm feelin' like Tyler Perry
Maybe I'm exhausted, maybe I just lost it
Maybe I should pick up a pen and try n' force it
Same old story, guts and no glory
They tryna low ball me, do him like Joe Torre
I reintroduced myself to the world: I'm Jerz
I'm an artist, I paint pictures, I don't rhyme words
More than a rapper, I pay attention to detail
But how I do in retail tells me if I prevail
Leonardo ain't seen these trials and tribulations
Foul situations with some mild stipulations
I feel like being an addict is a curse
It's somethin' 'bout dude that makes bad shit worse
There's three types of niggas in this world, you know?
So you either gon' make shit happen (or)
Watch shit happen or (or,) not know what happened
So I couldn't just sit there like, fuck rappin'
It's dudes with problems I couldn't imagine havin'
If I had to have 'em I couldn't fathom me lastin', like
I used to bump into Tammy in the club
Few of them, she even helped a nigga get in
See a person long enough you know you bound to get fly wit 'em
Care for 'em, be more than ""hi"" and ""bye"" with 'em
Its been a while, I can't front like I ain't phased
She was my reality check, 'cause we the same age
I mean she put on a show that you can't stage
She made the shit sound effortless
I was damn near in tears checkin' my messages
I got goosebumps all over my skin
She said, ""Mouse, I highly doubt that I'll ever see you again""
Hope everything is well, kid
You see I'm just findin' out I have a brain tumor, but I never felt it
The doctor's giving me three weeks to live
Not three weeks 'til I die, that's three weeks to give
I just wanna tell you that I love you and I care
I wish you all the best throughout the rest of your career""
And then she broke into tears
I pressed seven, took the phone from my ears
Sometimes the simplest of things people need it
But I ain't call back in fear of being speechless
What was I to put her at ease with
I picked a real bad time to be strategic
I think my life's bad, picking up the pieces
Some folk already got they appointment to see Jesus
In this world full of diseases
I've learned not to bite my tongue or have seizures
Depression tells me I suck
So I reply, I ain't here 'cause I fell down, I'm here 'cause I got up
And then I'm goin' back and forth with Ransom
Shit came outta nowhere, was real random
According to him, I'm responsible for Jerz too
I never helped niggas, how the fuck you think they heard you
Motherfucka's got a lot of nerve, dude
I was the nigga believed in you spittin'
Had to con the industry just so they would listen
But go 'head, you just gon' rep yourself
How was you protecting me, you can't protect yourself
Keep the lies to a minimal, just read your interview
I can't help but ask what's gotten into dude
Media trainin' but he don't know how that go
It'd help you come across not soundin' like an asshole
In my past though been to jail, I ain't enjoy it
So why would I stand behind the mic and exploit it
I ain't ig'nant, just because I exercise spiritually
They try to ignore how I exercise lyrically
I thought I had a great job
Back when niggas loved the culture, wasn't in it for the money like a A-Rod
Even when I'm spitting 'bout current events
Its a sublime sayin', who's more current than him?
So I'm wonderin', if a higher power tryna under-man
When you shoot for the stars, sometimes your gun'll jam
I ain't been to Summer Jam
I learned from Lupe: when you dumb it down its just harder to understand
2008, foes is still near me
So you can think I'm tight as FUCK, I'm still weary
The Geto Boys say its all in the mind
Certain wounds only heal over time
No shame in my game, no pain, no gain
And since I ain't see a prophet I figured God would stop it
Waitin' on a alley, niggas just won't lob it
Still a risk taker let me put it in words
Can't steal second base and keep your foot on first
Been about ten years since I was high off the angel
Now I'm walkin' side by side with an angel
In front of my eyes that prize keep gettin' dangled
But can't grab at it, my pride is being strangled
Workin' shorty's nerves like a personal trainer
But its me, its personal, it ain't her
Friends keep tellin me leave her, I won't
Cause she sees somethin' in me that I don't
And I see somethin' in her that ya'll won't
If you never been in love don't tell me I'm wrong
See I preach gratitude, she keeps an attitude
Argue long enough and that shit becomes laughable
My norm now since for her it's so natural
Wish I could tell her that all them niggas after you
So not compatible, that we compatible
Its nothin' else in this world that we would rather do
Anybody out there relate to my pain
Turn the music up let me know that I'm sane
We broke up, bitches was starin' at my chain
Dude was fuckin' you but starin' at my name
But we ain't gotta entertain all that
Back like we never left, we overcame all that
Fuck who made better tacos or who's ass fatter
Let's live for now, right now, none of that matters
Keep bringin' it up its goin' backlash us
Why am I meeting so many back-stabbers?
Why when I'm about to crash I go faster? Past is a disaster
When your house is see through, learn to close your eyes
In case the Glass shatters
Just sayin', it's always a million more pages when my stupid ass keep
Thinkin' I'm on the last chapter
No tit for tat, I ain't equipped for that
Back in New York, chit chat with a Midget Mack
As I get older...I keep gettin' sick of rap
Wanna call it quits, but a nigga can't picture that..."
Buggin Out,A Tribe Called Quest,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Yo, microphone check one, two, what is this?
The five foot assassin with the roughneck business
I float like gravity, never had a cavity
Got more rhymes than the Winans got family
No need to sweat Arsenio to gain some type of fame
No shame in my game cause I'll always be the same
Styles upon styles upon styles is what I have
You wanna diss the Phifer but you still don't know the half
I sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
Mess around with this you catch a size eight up your ass
I never half step cause I'm not a half stepper
Drink a lot of soda so they call me Dr. Pepper
Refuse to compete with BS competition
Your name ain't Special Ed
So won't you seckle with the mission
I never walk the street thinking it's all about me
Even though deep in my heart, it really could be
I just try my best to like go all out
Some might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out
[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Zulu Nation, brothers last creation
Minds get flooded, ejaculation
Right on the two inch tape
The Abstract poet incognito, runs the cape
Not the best not the worst and occasionally I curse
To get my point across, so bust, the floss
As I go in between, the grit and the dirt
Listen to the mission listen Miss as I do work, umm
As I crack the, monotone
Children of the jazz so, get your own
Smokin R&B cause they try to do me
Or the best of the pack but they can't do rap
For it's Abstract, original
You can't get your own and that's, pitiful
I know I'd be the man if I cold yanked the plug
On R&B, but I can't and that's bugged

[Chorus]
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
[Verse 3: Phife Dawg]
Yo when you bug out
You usually have a reason for the action
Sometimes you do it just for mere satisfaction
People be hounding, always surrounding
Pulsing, just like a migraine pounding
You don't really fret, you stay in your sense
Camouflage your feeling, of absolute tense
You soar off to another world, deep in your mind
But people seem to take that, as being unkind
""Oh yo he's acting stank,"" really on a regal?
A man of the fame not a man of the people
Believe that if you wanna but I tell you this much
Riding on the train with no dough, sucks
Once again a case of your feet in my Nike's
If a crowd is in my realm I'm saying -- mic please
Hip-hop is living, can't yank the plug
If you do the result, will end up kind of bugged

[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
Yo, I am not an invalid although
I used to smoke the weed out
Ali Shaheed Muhammad used to say I had to be out
Scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns
Pushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun
When I left for road, see, I was Boulevard status
Battling a MC was when Tip was at his maddest
It was one MC after one MC
What the world could they be wanting see from little old me
Do I have the formula to save the world?
Or was it just because I used to
Swipe the women and all the girls
I'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand, kid
Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did
Supposed to be my man
But now I wonder cause you're feeble
I go out with the strongies and I separate the evils
It's your brain against my mind, for those about to boot out
All you nasty critters even though you see I bug out
[Chorus]
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out"

I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd-pleaser
DJ play another from the prince of this
Your highness, only mad chicks ride in my whips

Rock from South Street to one-two-fifth

Since I moved up like George and Weezie
C.R.E.A.M. to the maximum I be asking 'em
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum?
Never see Will attacking 'em
Rather play ball with Shaq and 'em, flatten 'em
Psych, kidding
Thought I took a spill, but I didn't
Trust the lady of my life she hitting
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon

Ooh. Jesus Christ had dreads, so shake em
I ain't got none, but I'm planning on growing some
Imagine all the Hebrews going dumb
Dancing on top of chariots and turning tight ones
Ooh, tell me when to go (dumb)
Talking on my Ghettro on the way to the store
My second or third trip
Some Henny, some Swishers and some Listerine strips
Dr. Greenthumb lips, just to ease my thoughts
Not just the cops, but the homies you got to watch
The moon is full, look at the dark clouds
Sitting in my scraper, watching Oakland Gone Wild, ta-dow
I don't bump mainstream, I knock underground
All that other shit, sugarcoated and watered down
I'm from the Bay where we hyphy and go dumb
From the soil where them rappers be getting their lingo from

My city couldn't be saved by John the Pope (John the Pope)
I slid past on the gas with the bitches at me
It's good, it's good like the granddaddy
Cross game, you get flipped like a burger patty
Or zig-zagged, pass me a big old fatty
I drink white, with a snow bunny
Talking big shit in the scraper, going hella dummy

Hello my friend, How you do my friend? What would you like?
Yes, what would you like?
(I want uh... pack of Backwoods...pack of Backwoods
Give me a fifth of that privilege Hennessy and uh... thats it)
Thank you very very much

[Verse 1]
What you know about me? I'm Mac Dreezy
Call Hennessy heem and a blunt a bleezy
I keep a fat sack wrapped in a Backwood leaf
Smoke trees that make me look Japanese
Green seedless, mean when I'm weedless
Never in denial, I'm a fiend and I need this
Any day is a bad day for Mac Dre
When he ain't got it, they ask why he act that way
I smoke champ, kush and Naid
""Man, what's Naid?"" Bomb that's sprayed
I can't fade a beezy who don't keep a bleezy
Rolled for a neezy
I ask her, 'What the feezy?'
I gotta have weed to go get weed
You don't like it, kiss my ass 'til your lips bleed
This one's for the club so I'm kinda like keeping it clean
Sing it with me y'all...

Everywhere I go (Bleezies n heem)

I L-O-V-E H double-E M
I drink like ten of them things that swim
""He's heeming again"" is what they say when I come around
I'll get dumb drunk and fuck up your compound
Your building, your establishment
Mobbin', saying ""Cuddie, I'm hella bent""
Oh what a feeling when you're looking at the ceiling
And it's spinning and the earl starts spilling
I drink heem when I perk, don't like Erk and Jerk
It don't work, when a nigga chillin'
Might spill it on my Abercrombie Fitch
Know I got the man at the liquor store rich
Well baby would you please run and get...
Me another Hennessy fifth?

Fire up, lets get drunk
Get your cup, fill it up, don't be no punk
A party ain't a party if every damn body
Ain't lifted and a little bit tipsy
But don't drink and drive, I remember one time
My cuddie Joogy, wrapped his fifty, rap this with me
And if you don't understand
You a inbred, your daddy and your uncle was the same man
I gotta have dope everywhere I go
When they ask me what I drink I say, ""Heem, what you think?""
I gets heem in me, only substitute is Rémy
In Sac with Jimmy, or in Portland with Kenny
I'm danked out, dranked out, can't talk, can't count
If I want some more I'm making baby pull her bank out
You cool on the bomb? What do you mean?
Sing it to him y'all...

What it is
Thizz is what it is
Another knocker
Kick this game around like soccer

Pull up a chair let me make you a plate
Of this game that's seasoned like a tasty steak
Since '88 I've been serving them well
I was serving yayo when L was Rocking Bells
Clocking mail, get, get, getting it
Copping it, flipping it, flip, flip, flipping it
Now I'm spitting it bar for bar
European whipping it car for car
No dough, hoe? You know I say no
I need you like Jaws need a rain coat
I fandangoes, stay high as the Star Spangled
Choke the blood out you, bitch, get strangled
Get mangled fucking with this pimpin'
Hot as Lipton, Dre Jay Simpson
You better pay attention, it's all gamed up
Peep the bio, the file, see how I came up

In the Sco the O and Valley Jo
Getting rich in the Rich and San Jo
Grinding and rhyming and pimpin' hoes
Rolling on vogues and 2-4s

Stay with zippas, boy, I keep a few O's
Get bossed and say 'thar she blows!'

When I sweat her I say 'read my lips'
Bring me cheddar, bitch, bring me chips
Fingertips, ass, hips and lips
Follow my lead, don't ask questions bitch
I want fresh fits from Abercrombie & Fitch
When it's going down, the Mac comes and shits
The Mac comes to spit
Let me do it to your ear baby
I'm trying to flip, see I do it every year baby
Real off the laddish, getting my cottage
Cheese, geez, please, beez, freeze
Stop it, you're heading down the wrong path
Fuck making love, bitch, I want a tongue bath
Dumb cash, can you do it like me?
Cash a fat check at the bank with no I.D
Can you blow by me when I'm doing 100?
Smacking, slapping in my 500

I want a stuffed turkey with all the trimmings
To pay and play extra innings
I'm winning, fat lady start singing
I'm finna get the Cougnut and start swinging
Skeet, dance and eight
And when they run my plates, model and make
I'mma shake, like I'm riding with a cake
Pedal to the metal, rarely hit the brake
I love a high-speed getaway
They wanna get rid of Dre, put the kid away

Death to My Enemies,50 Cent,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Dre, niggas think we bullshitting
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Nigga, try me, son, he best have the heat on him
Whip him outta his clothes, get to mopping the street with him
Boy, I'll put your body in a bag
Front on me, I'm on ya ass
I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies
I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies

[Verse 1]
Nigga front on me, the goons and goblins come out
Bushmaster hundred shot, drums'll run out
They dumb out, you heard of me, they call me big homie
Me I make the register ring, I'm the cash cow
They make the hammers ring, they on ya ass now
Hair trigger, stare nigga, yeah, niggas'll flip
Six shot semi assault, let it off at your will
Here I is, where the money is, I still get biz
If D's know about the beef, you gon' still get did
It be your tombstone and your fucking grave they dig
Have that ass in the precinct trying to talk to the pigs
I'm like Damien, nigga, when I start getting loose on you
Closest thing to Lucifer, you think you got a noose on you
I make it hard to breathe
I come with your hustle, air it out, make it hard to eat
Have you lookin' both ways like you crossing the street
[Chorus]
Nigga, try me, son, he best have the heat on him
Whip him outta his clothes, get to mopping the street with him
Boy, I'll put your body in a bag
Front on me, I'm on ya ass
I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies
I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies

[Verse 2]
Yeah, niggas send me the wrong message, we gon' fucking kill the messenger
Your whole clique, hollow tips'll tear up the best of ya
This ain't the ""Carter"" nigga, this is Sparta
It's harder, I die and be a martyr, respect me like your father
Let off a clip or let a case off
I have your pussy ass running like a race horse
Follow orders now, Yay' shoot his face off
You can have one, blast one, it's mad fun
See how when you listen to me all of the cash gone
I was born with the tech, it's a birth defect
I was conceived in the bins, ended up in a Benz
This is what happens when have-not's turn into Sasquatch
Let the gat pop, boogie down on the back blocks
It's horrific, nah, it's terrific
I got it if you sniff it, go 'head nigga twist it
Get lifted, goddamn I'm gifted
[Chorus]
Nigga, try me, son, he best have the heat on him
Whip him outta his clothes, get to mopping the street with him
Boy, I'll put your body in a bag
Front on me, I'm on ya ass
I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies
I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I tell 'em ride on 'em then they ride on 'em
Get the line on 'em and squeeze the .9 on 'em
Headshot, .40-Glock blow his mind on him
It's a hit, not a jux leave the shines on 'em
Now you can watch me, nigga, like the police watch me
I move proper, go ahead catch a shell trying to stop me
That 430 Spider, carbon fibre
And my dog is like Al Qaeda, natural fighter
Rapid fire, you're sweet like apple cider
The Mack'll fire, mask like Michael Myers
It's off the wire when I get on my bullshit
No smiles, no laughs, you gets no pass
You can explain to my niggas while they whoop yo' ass
My hands itch when the money comes, it's hard to explain it
Last time I itched like this, a truckload came in
Get money, get bread, that's what I do kid
[Chorus]
Nigga, try me, son, he best have the heat on him
Whip him outta his clothes, get to mopping the street with him
Boy, I'll put your body in a bag
Front on me, I'm on ya ass
I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies
I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies"
The Day the Niggaz Took Over,Dr. Dre,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Protestor]
I'ma say this and I'ma end mine
If you ain't down for the Africans here in the United States
Period, point-blank
If you ain't down for the ones that suffered in South Africa from apartheid and shit
Dammit, you need to step your punk-ass to the side
And let us brothers and us Africans step in
And start puttin' some foot in that ass!

[Bridge: All]
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
I got my finger on the trigger, some niggas wonder why
But livin' in the city, it's do-or-die
I got my finger on the trigger, some niggas wonder why
But livin' in the city, it's do-or-die
[Verse 1: Daz Dillinger]
Dem wonder why mi violent, dem no really understand
For de reason why mi take mi law in mi own hand
Mi not out for peace and mi not Rodney King
De gun goes click, mi gun goes bang
Dem riot in Compton and dem riot in Long Beach
Dem riot in L.A. 'cause dem no really wanna see
Niggas start to loot and police start to shoot
Lock us down at seven o'clock, barricade us like Beirut
Mi don't show no love 'cause it's us against dem
Dem never, ever love me 'cause it's sport to break dem
And kill, at my own risk, if I may
To lay, to spray with my AK, and put 'em to rest

[Interlude: Reporter]
Yes, we have—there have been riots, ah, uh, rioting
Well, I don't wanna say rioting, but there's been looting downtown
But right now, Bree, what I want to show you is
They have started fires down at the end of the street

[Refrain: All & Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
How many niggas are ready to loot?
Yeah, so what you wanna do? What you wanna do?
I said, how many niggas are ready to loot?
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a 9
[Interlude: Interviewee]
That's what they told us today, ""In other words, you still a slave""
No matter how much money you got, you still ain't shit!

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Sitting in my living room, calm and collected
Feeling that gotta-get-mine perspective
'Cause what I just heard broke me in half
And half the niggas I know, plus the niggas on the Row is bailing
Laugh now, but cry much later
You see, when niggas get together, they get mad 'cause they can't fade us
Like my niggas from South Central, Los Angeles
They found that they couldn't handle us
Bloods, Crips on the same squad
With the Ese's helpin', nigga, it's time to rob and mob
And break the white man off something lovely, biddy-bye-bye
I don't love dem so dem can't love me
Yo, straight puttin' it down, gettin' my scoot on
It's jumping off in Compton so I gots to get my loot on
And come up on me some furniture or somethin'
Got a VCR in the back of my car
That I ganked from the Slauson Swap Meet
And motherfuckers better not try to stop me
'Cause they will see that I can't be stopped
'Cause I'ma cock my Glock and pop 'til they all drop
[Interlude: Reporter & Reporter 2]
Yes, on the videotape we seem to have the, uh
People in the crowd throwing things at the officers
And swinging at them as well
As there was a, uh, young woman there, you see, took a swing at—
At an officer with some object in her hand

[Refrain: All & Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
How many niggas are ready to loot?
Yeah, so what you wanna do? What you wanna do?
I said, how many niggas are ready to loot?
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
I got my finger on the trigger, some niggas wonder why
But livin' in the city, it's do-or-die
I got my finger on the trigger, some niggas wonder why
But livin' in the city, it's do-or-die

[Verse 3: RBX]
One-time trigger happy, no nigga love
One-eighty-seven time, time to grab the glove
Can't get prints on a nine I throw away
Or get prints on my Uzi when it spray
Pop-pop, pop, another motherfucker drop
And I get relief like, plop, plop, fizz
Smash, I crashed his head like a window
I ain't Nintendo, I'm high off the indo
Creepin', with the quickness to the cut
Bust one to his head while he munches on a donut
And crack-up, so now he best to back up
I guess I gots to pack up, filling the clip up
I zip uptown but motherfuckin' cops are all around
Helicopters flyin', these motherfuckers tryin'
To catch me and stretch me on Death Row
But hell no, the poor blacks refuse to go

[Interlude: Reporter 2]
This now covers a very, very wide area of Los Angeles where these fires have been, uh, ignited
I mean, from here to the, uh, to the south end of South Central is a long way

[Bridge: All]
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'

[Verse 4: Daz Dillinger]
The outcome of this is destruction, so them all fall
Niggas don't give a fuck, so them bust and them fall
The description of three blacks
Shows no justice, so, pick up it's your right
If you riot again, mi, turn the other cheek
We, be too many, mi got, mi nine to my side
So mi bust, flick, 'cause he don't give a fuck
And mi don't give a fuck
And all my problems end with that buck-buck

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Blam, blam, blam 'til dem fall
Listen to the shots from a nigga Doggy Dogg, biddy-bye
Dr. Dre, him bust gun shots
Diggidy Daz and RBX, dem bust gun shots

If I had some nuts, hanging on the wall, what would I have honey?""
I said, ""Darlin', you'd have some walnuts""
She said, ""Well, daddy, if I had some nuts on my chest, would those be chestnuts?"" I said, ""Hell yeah""

Back with some shit that gots to bump
As you pull up in the park, you pops your trunk
Just to floss it like a motherfucker, clowning and shit
Got your Dana's on your hooptie and your fly-ass bitch
Throw off, go off, show off, I take that ho
If she proper, I'ma pop her, the ho hopper
Is back on track
With big money, big nuts and a big fat chronic sack

So Daz, step up on they ass
And give these motherfuckers a blast from the past

[Verse 2: Dat Nigga Daz]
Diggidy Daz out of the cut with some shit that I wrote
With my nigga D-R-E, so you know I must be dope
But, uh, rat-tat-tat-tat that ass
Starting static with Dre, make way for the AK
That I bring as I slang like cavi
Not from Kris Kross but they call me Mac Daddy
Had he not known about the city I'm from
(Long Beach, tic-tac, grab your gat, watch your back)
Here I come, stomping in my khaki suit
B.G. from the hood, kinfolk Eastwood
God damn, I ripped up, flipped up, and skipped up
On top of things as they swing towards my ding-a-ling
[Interlude: Snoop Dogg]
But could you raise up off his nuts?
'Cause Dr. Drizzae's about to rizzip shit up

Chicky-check, microphone check one
Chicky-check, microphone check two
Chicky-check, microphone check three
You're tuned to the sounds of the D-R-E

Now check me out, it's back to the old school
Where the niggas get they scrap on, don't nobody cap on
Slap on some D-R-E
Or some funky-ass shit by the D-O-double-G-Y D-O-double-G
Real G's who drop ki's

Peep out my manuscript
You'll see that it's a must I drop gangsta shit (Biatch)

Fuck that, nigga, what's up with all that shit you was talkin', nigga? (I ain't say nothing, why you trippin'?)

Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Forty-four reasons come to mind
Why a motherfuckin' brother is hard to find
He been walking on the streets and fuckin' with mine
Stupid punk can't fuck with a mastermind
See, I never take a step on a Compton block
Or L.A. without the AK ready to pop
'Cause them punk motherfuckers in black and white
Ain't the only motherfuckers I gots to fight
I think it's better to be tellin' the facts than cuffed up
And jacked and fucked up
What you niggas looking at? You going
""Goddamn!"" 'Cause it's the city
And for you to survive, a nigga gotta be a gangsta
And I'm a nigga you can't remove
Took out a lot of motherfuckers for tryin' to prove
To they homies that they can hang by dealin' with me
But once again in the end they D-E-A-D
I never did time on a murder yet
'Cause I relax, sit back, do a job and jet
Yo, I know you understand my flow
So here we go, and Death Row
Come let a motherfucker know

D-R-E, a motherfucker who's known for carrying gats
And kick raps that make snaps, adapts to
Any environment that I'm located at
If you see me on the solo move believe that I'm strapped
Four-four, tray-eight or AK-47
'Cause slowly but surely send you on a stairway to heaven
Just put my finger on the trigger and pull back
And lay a punk motherfucker flat
As he wonder what popped before he got popped
I told you I was Dre and you know it don't stop
Now I know you understand my flow
So here we go, and Death Row

I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off, yeah
I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off, yeah

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
I breaks 'em off, but I ain't speaking about between the thighs
I'm talking about cocking a gauge in between your eyes
It'll make you drop to your knees 'cause you realize
That a gat'll make any nigga civilized
Old buster-ass nigga talking bullshit
Don't know that I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
Get lit or hit up by the doctor
A nigga that breaks 'em off properly
Real G so don't doubt it
I'm the one who's doin' it while these other niggas talk about it
And if motherfuckers come at me wrong
I straight put my forty-four Desert Eagle to his motherfuckin' dome
And show him why they call me the notorious one
The name is Dre Eastwood when I'm packing a gun
You don't believe me, well step up and give it a try
And if you die, you's a buster, 'cause real niggas don't die
But some still don't hear me, though
You're too near me not to hear me, nigga, yo

When I rack up, so all you mothafuckas just pack up

If you think you're swift with the gift, Merry Christmas

Roll on you like a boulder, you're nothin' more than a grain

This young black kid a mercenary, merciless
Murderin' millions of niggas, so who's first to diss?
They say I'm bad, so you'll find none worse than this
Chewin' motherfuckers up like a Hershey's Kiss
Put to sleep, loving the lyrics I leave in the minds of each
Rough when flex, too complex, wrecks your mental piece
So feel the wrath, nigga, I rip in half, niggas
You're quick to talk shit, I whoop your ass, nigga
Then watch me blast, nigga, 'cause I'm the last nigga
You wanna fuck wit', so up your cash, nigga
I make 'em stagger, I'm scandalous as Jimmy Swaggart
I'm a good tracker, scopin' your girl then watch me tag her
Pullin' steel like a stunt
Shown like an ID card, nigga, no needs to front, so

Anytime steppin' through my hood
But that'll do you no good
One slug to your face, don't hate
You're gettin' smoked like wood

Seven execution style murders
I have no remorse 'cause I'm the fuckin' murderer

One-time bust they caps and watch niggas collapse

This is just the first chapter
In a book from a crook
You get caught slippin', your ass gots to die
Nigga, tell me what the fuck you figure
Trigger happy, RBX to cap you
Pump, pump, and I can't wait to bust a round
Pump, pump, my hollow point smacks the clown

""Yes, it is I,"" says me
And all who agree are more than three 'cause they're we, haha
Yes, yo, I'm in the house now for sure
Because I wanna talk about the hearts of men
Who knows what evil lurks within them?
But let's take a travel down the blindside
And see what we find on this path called

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
Stranded on death row, so duck when I swing my shit
I get rugged like Rawhead Rex with fat tracks that fits
The gangsta type, what I recite's kinda lethal
Niggas know the flow that I kick, there's no equal
I'm murderin' niggas, yo, and maybe because of the tone I kicks
When I grip the mic and kick shit niggas can't fuck with
So remember I go hardcore and slam
'Nough respect like a sensei, whoop ass like Van Damme
So any nigga that claim they bossin'
Why don't you bring your ass on over to Crenshaw and Slauson?
Take a walk through the hood where we up to no good
Slangin' them things like a real O.G. should
I'm stackin' and mackin' and packin' a ten so
When you're slippin', I slip the clip in, but ain't no set trippin'
'Cause it's Death Row, rollin' like the mafia
Think about whoopin' some ass, but what the fuck stoppin' ya?
Ain't nothin' but a buster
I'm stranded on death row for pumpin' slugs in motherfuckers
Now you know you're outdone, feel the shotgun
Kurupt, inmate, cell block one
[Verse 2: RBX]
No prevention from this lynchin' of sorts
You're a victim from my driveby of thoughts
No extensions, all attempts are to fail
Blinded by the light, it's time you learn braille
From a lunatic, I'm death like arsenic
When I kick a wicked rap, Dr. Dre will hit the scratch
With treachery, my literary form will blast
And totally surpass the norm
Not a storm, plural, make it many storms
When I'm vexed, I fight leg, necks, and arms
In this dimension, I'm the presenter
And the inventor, and the tormentor
Deranged, like the Hillside Strangler
Emcee mangler, tough like Wrangler
I write a rhyme, hard as concrete
Step to the heat and get burned like mesquite
So what you wanna do?
The narrator RBX, cell block two

[Verse 3: The Lady of Rage]
Rage, lyrical murderer
Stranded on death row and now I'm servin' a
Lifetime sentence, there'll be no repentance
Since it's the life that I choose to lead, I plead guilty
On all counts, let the ball bounce where it may
It's just another clip into my AK
Buck 'em down with my underground tactics
Facts and stacks of clips on my mattress
Bed frame, there's another dead, bang
Laying lame, put to shame, who's to blame?
Me, the Lady of Rage, a woman comin'
From the D-E-A-T-H and R-O-W, takin' no shit
So flip and you're bound to get dropped

Handcuffed as I bust, there'll be no debate
It's Rage, from cell block H

Ayo, steppin' through the fog and creepin' through the smog

Dre is the doctor and my homie, little nigga
Warren G is my hand and my hand's on the trigga
Shootin' at the hoes with the game that I got
Sent to death row 'cause I wanted to make a grip from servin' my rocks
And I'm still serving for mine
Peace to my motherfuckin' homies doing time
In the pen and the county jail
Mobbin' with your blues on, mad as hell
And you're sayin', ""Fuck the police""
And all the homies on the streets is all about peace
And it's driving the cops crazy
But ain't nothin' but a black thing, baby
Uh, I'm not flaggin', but I'm just saggin'
I bet'cha don't wanna see the D-O-double-G
And you can't see the D-R to the E
Or my motherfuckin' homie D.O.C
You know you can't fuck with my motherfuckin' DJ
That's my homie and we call him Warren G
Yeah, and you don't stop
Doggy Dogg break 'em down with the motherfuckin' Dogg Pound
That's the only way we'll beat 'em, man
We gotta smoke 'em then choke 'em like the motherfuckin' Peterman

Yo, now you know the path I'm on
You think you're strong?
See if you can travel on

Those who are quiet will always cause riots

Those who don't know what happened
Those who wonder what happened
And people like us from the streets that make things happen"

Hell yeah you heard of me, quite an emergency
The way I take the game and I beat it so un-unmercifully, yeah
Ladies with curly features, wait at concerts to see you
They can roll home with B.O., and maybe service me up
But if you wanna work for me then girl you need your working visas
And if you ain't working then you just should not converse with me
That's not that serious, don't take it so personally
Plus currently I prefer the girls who prefer the three C.P.O
C.P.O. I think I think I'm Neo
I'm caught up in her Matrix and I think it's time to reload
And if this were a court, then girl I would have to appeal
I think that the defendant have some things that she must reveal
Heels ha, heels ha, tell me what's the deal, ma
Got me chasing you to see if I could cop a feel, huh
I gotta keep it real, kosher, kosher, kosher
Cause she don't want that bullshit, no sir, no sir, no sir
Her thighs go round like roller-coaster motors
And like a minute bundle, I had to roll them over
Had to connect the headset into her Motorolla

My own lane and my own speed, it's a long road so I don't sleep

If you're full of shit, then you're gonna stink
I'm a realist I'm gonna think, with a pair of eyes so I'm gonna see
I'll be whatever the fuck I wanna be, I'll be everything except a wanna be
I'll be everything you ever wanna be, if you're clever enough you can corner me
But what's a corner to me, I'm geometry
So tell me who gave you the authority? Who the fuck are you? The authority?
What am I supposed to be orderly? pardon my honor you're charging me?
Saying something I oughta be but I got some much heart that my arteries will always be partying like a camaraderie
Man I'm already famous historically so my story is already glorious
Just like P Diddy victorious to the B.I.G. Notorius
I'm a champion, I'm a warrior, I bring war to ya

In your own blood

Blow you up like a SCUD I'm a stud
Sweep you other dirt bags under the rug

Ok there's something fishy here and it's not the bait and tackle
Oh it must be me cause I'm the big daddy Makerel
Hook you right up into your Adam's Apple
And begin to grapple
Your thoughts limb from limb like a bottle of Snapple
Peaches to plums and pears to apples

Knock you right off the hinges

The same thing happened eons ago
To know exactly you have to read up some more
Everyday technology speeds up some more
As is above, so is below
Some feel the heat, yet some feel the cold
We are the souls, yes, we have been chose
Some roll with angels and demons and ghosts
But shh! Hold up, Bob, don’t go there!
You know that they watching, the all-seeing stare
But they can’t stop me, I’m already there
And y’all ain't seen shit but y’all already scared
I’m gone, high like fructose, fructose
You wanna know the truth? Really, you don't, you don't
It’ll blow you out your mind, like a UFO, UFO

While the cops giving out free mace to your face
Now how do that taste? I’m outta my mind
These videos tellin’ y'all lies, bruh
Tellin' y'all we holding evil hand-signs, bruh
Last time I checked I’m from the Eastside, bruh
So do your research and make your own mind up
’Cause us musicians have influence on this mic
But they don’t like that, so they conquer and divide
Double-H N-D, hip hop never dies
So shoot all you want, but we fly
Because, you know, no one man should have all that power
Obviously ‘cause it’s only one power
But nevermind, y’all keep worshipping Towers
While the clock keeps handing y'all hours
But pucker up because the truth gets sour
More sour than the sour diesel I devour
Hear me by the hour, I give you 50 vowels
When I brain storm it's like a shower
So pull out your towels, and don't let 'em play you
Do your own thing, fuck what they do!
And if you good at somethin' make sure they pay you
And if not, take a thankyou
Whether they praise you, or whether they hate you
It’s all about the attention that they pay you
Y’all on that grape drink, try this grape juice
Shouts to Grand Hustle, we got that break through
And, yes, it’s evident we better than
The rest of these competitors
Really there ain't no one else ahead of us
Yeah, I bust these verses off, et cetera, et cetera

Every conjured up question, I answer
No I don’t have crabs, bitch, try cancer
Diagnosed with my arm inside a rope
Calm like I don’t know, but armed to die alone
Where’s arms? Sitting around at the cat scan
Fat chance, I'll give myself a back hand
You fucking bitch, I thought microwaves helped
Fuck it, remove the food, I'll just microwave myself
Mad at me jerkin off? I like to play myself

Falling in love with sin

All the things I never wanted
Never had to hit the club
Not even the 700

No, I'm not Zack and Cody but if you get to know me I think I can make your life real sweet
But she's way too young and I'm getting mad sprung, I'm hoping no one tells on me
But every time I see her face down at Waverly Place, there's a wizard casts a spell on me

I could be your prince Aladdin, you could be my Jasmine, come be in my fantasy Baby

Chunky,Ghostface Killah,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Hey miss what up, Tone got luck
I wore a lot of jewelry and I never got stuck
Cats like the way I write, dress like a superstar
Take car of family so I don't have stupid cars
Peace to all single ladies struggle with a ruff life
Baby daddy fronting
That's aight check out my man Trife
Represent Stapleton, raised in the West
780 Anderson now I'm the best
Stopping all bets slamming niggas like Barkley
Back in my reefer days sellin you parsley
Always kept aluminum bats in the car seat
Then I showed Doo and them, That's were the narcs be
Came to play no games and stay in your lane
And the ratchets on your brain and fuckin to aim at yall
Big spender, Rock a robe in November
I never broke bud I throw my trees up in a blender

[Hook: Ghostface Killah]
How you like it baby
You wanna good time, You alright you alright
Come on, How you like it baby
Can I roll with you tonight
[Verse 2]
Yo, You better shoot spots, Red and blue drops
I used to serve those, those maroon tops, (Go head)
Then crack the window when the fuckin rooms hot
If my CD was skippin get a different boom box
New socks full of polo chet, rugged low mocs
So hot, Right before I pop the fuckin show stops
You can't box, I Seen better hands on an old clock
The old ox never marked you, Ima blow pops
Prophesize Don, it's me
Aqua blue mink, In my bitch arms and feet
20 g's real niggas like pardon me
Ima be honest to your man with the Dom P, More like Sean Connery
Heard he fight crime like the old man Barnaby
Giving you the business, Crack heads and wannabes
And I keep drugs in the Toney Starks pharmacy
Desperate house wives slobbing me cause they honor me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now if it wasn't for the Wu
Tell me if this rap shit would really carry on
Now tell me where you from
Staten Isle baby, Up town baby
Boogie down baby, Brook-Don baby
Now if it wasn't for the Ghost
None of yall rap niggas would be writing songs
Now tell me where yall from
Queens bound baby, Long Isle baby
New Jerus baby, Connecticut baby
Hey mister, please let my niggas in
Thugs and my women in, You don't want no problem wit me
We got them burners on the dance floor
Goons is already in, Shanks and Machetes in
3 to the head again, Ghost Remy Hennessy
All yall haters what yall mad for"

Truth of the matter is I'm complicated
You're as straight as they come
You go 'bout your day, baby
While I hide from the sun

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
It's better if you don't understand
'Cause you won't know what it's like until you try

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
You know I, I've been waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime, but you just gotta decide
You know I, I've been waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side

[Verse 2: CeeLo Green]
We would live forever
Who could ask for more?
You could die if you wanted
But baby, what for?
[Pre-Chorus: CeeLo Green]
It's better if you don't understand
And you won't know what it's like until you try

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
You know I, I've been waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime, but you just got to decide
You know I, I've been waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side

[Verse 3: B.o.B.]
If they say life's a dream, call this insomnia
'Cause this ain't Wonderland, it damn sure ain't Narnia
And once you cross the line, you can't change your mind
Yeah, I'm a monster, but I'm no Frankenstein
And quite frankly, I've been feelin' insane in between my eyes
I really can't explain what I feel inside
If you knew what I was, you would run and hide
Many have tried to go into the night
And cross over the line, and come back alive
But that's the price we paying when we living on the other side

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
You know I, I've been waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime, but you just gotta decide
You know I, I've been waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side

It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand

Destroy  Rebuild,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
This is a journey into the world's most largest and notorious projects, Queensbridge
Listen while Nas saves his hood from the most cowardest rappers

[Verse 1]
He held a mass appeal and a likkle boy smile
Depressed has a complex, his mouth was foul
You need to stay around, I feel like tellin' some stories
First there's this arrogant fuck, his name's Cory
Hung around my mans Lakey and Big Trevor
Trevor's still locked up, Lake's gettin' his cheddar
Corey changed his name to ah, whatever
Cornchip, Buckwheat look-a-like, it's Mega
Right, Mega was his name, sorry about that
But it's so hard to put a coward's name in my rap
Always actin' tough, a jokester be frontin'
He got snuffed, he got shot in the thigh, he did nothin'
But that's Nas always lookin' out for bredren
'Cause when bredren don't return love it don't stress him
'Cause gangstas do gangsta shit, real recognize real
Still laughin' to the bank and shit
Back to Cor', got him a deal but his rhymes was wack
Def Jam mad that he signed the contract
Now he got jealous and mad at my shine
Making silly tapes, I'm always on his mind
Nonsense, not to be obnoxious, kid
Mega, for the record you could suck my dick
Bitch, you from around the way, it's sad what this do to me
But Queensbridge, we gotta have unity
[Refrain]
They say (The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say (The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, we the strongest hood but it's these cowards that kill it
So now they say

[Verse 2]
Since we on the subject of traitors and flunkies
Mega ain't the only faggot in my hood, dummies
There's plenty that wanna be me but cannot
It's like King Arthur and Knight Sir Lancelot
Lefty and Donnie Brasco, Gotti and Paul
Before I woulda told you Prodigy's my dog
Through the ups and downs, robberies and all
Though I always knew he wanted my downfall
He would say his little slick shit and act real funny
For what, nigga? You're butt and it got back to me
Askin' a Braveheart to help get back your jewelry
You ain't from my hood, don't even rep Q.B
Nature moved to Marcy
(Man dick riding Nature) Nothing else to say
Man, Nature moved to Marcy (What? Far)
Backward ass niggas, man, fuck them niggas (Far away)
Go 'head with the program, man, proceed
Old lady pocketbook snatcher, car thief
Course we ain't friends, you never stood on no blocks
Streets or corners with zombies, ghouls and gangstas
Cops, drug dealers with pools of blood anger
Just fills me when niggas let out of town to set shot
And get filthy rich, it's just not
No more morals, no loyalty, no more community
Queensbridge, we gotta have unity
[Refrain]
They say (The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say (The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, we the strongest hood but it's these cowards that kill it
So now they say

[Verse 3]
I put the name on the map after Marley and Shan
Q.B. before the ROC had one jam
Before the Death Row and Bad Boy beef
I had streets locked with raw talent, I laugh at the weak
So this about cleanin' up house, my own backyard
Famous home of rap stars well known be getting robbed
P, how many times ain't you shamed that
Jungle was bustin' his gun to get your weak chain back
They don't respect you, a check's due for me for your fame
Mega, I hope you blow so I'm sayin' your name (Mega, Mega)
Hoes play your position 'cause you'll never be King
Even Jigga want the crown, ""How that sound?"" Poor thing
I'm representin' Queensbridge U.S.A
Where two SK's go off every day ruthless-lay
All you little roaches and rats
Besides my man Ricky, Nas the true ruler is back
So haters say
[Refrain]
(The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say (The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say (The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, we the strongest hood but it's these cowards that kill it
So now they say

""The Bridge is over,"" my dick
The Bridge'll never be over, long as I'm alive and breathin'
Braveheart to the graveyard
I'm the William Wallace of this shit
Ayo, P, Prodigy I got love for you, man, I love you, man
You know what I'm sayin'?
Just get them unloyal niggas from out your circle
You can't save everybody
Niggas invited you to the hood, rep it right, my nigga
Be untouchable, my nigga
So it be Mobb for life for real, and that's real
Ayo, Nature, I can't hold your hand through this shit, man
I'm not your father, man
Be your own man, stand on your own two
I believe in you, believe in yourself, nigga
Or don't even rep this, man
Ayo, Mega you wanna be a gangsta?
There's real gangsta shit going on in the streets, man
Yo niggas is in the grind
Where you be at man? Niggas be buckin'
Why you never buckin'? Where you be at, man?
All of a sudden you the motherfuckin' Nino Brown of the fuckin' hood?
It's disgusting, man, stay out the magazines
Keep my name out your motherfuckin' mouth
There's no more room for jealousy, we destroyin' and rebuildin'
That means the cowards get out and real niggas stay
Niggas been hating me since I been nine
Shining with suede motherfucking Bally's on and silks
I'ma always be the young don
Don't be like the niggas on the other side
Hating me 'cause I'm beautiful
Real niggas in Queensbridge
Y'all niggas come up and get this money and move on, baby

We gon' handle this like grown men, you won't win
You don't even feel comfortable in your own skin
I rap my ass off, I'm fightin' the champ with the glass jaw
At the Garden or Nassau (Uh-huh)
See me, couple hood niggas behind stars
I heard you put a couple good niggas behind bars (Preme!)
I might never sell that much
But you can bet your last two quarters I never tell that much
Picture 'Kiss not come out swingin'
It's like going to see 50 at a show
And he don't come out singin' (C'mon!)
Yeah, you got a felony, but you ain't a predicate (Nuh-uh)
Never the King of New York, you live in Connecticut (Haha)
You don't be in the hood, you be in the woods
Fuckin' with me, it's where you really gon' be for good (Ugh)
I hold the 4-5 myself (Ch-chk)
And hop out the Range on 1-4-5 myself (What up!)

Since when has it become cool to get shot and not shoot back? (Never)
Trackmasters shelved you (Ugh), Bravehearts helped you (Ugh)
Then everybody felt you (Uh-huh), now I gotta melt you (Yeah)
And don't try to pull rank on 'Kiss
‘Cause the niggas I'ma send to do it ain't gon' miss
Be layed up stiff, I spit straight up piff
I did real songs with Big, no made-up shits (Ah!)
And I don't got a problem with clout
You ain't get shot again yet
So what's your second album about? (Nothin'!)
Your raps are pre-school
You made a lot of money, now be cool
'Fore I swell up your lips like seafood (Mmm)
Can I get a mic check?
You don't stand a chance at the dance with me, dawg
Your steps ain't right yet (Uh-uh)
Block is just fine, homie, the D's straight (D-Block)
Most likely, your new CD is a weed plate (Haha)
Bunch of love songs, 100% pure garbage (Garbage)
Just somethin' to break up buds on
You should just sell clothes and sneakers
‘Cause outta your whole camp
Your flow's the weakest (Garbage)
I'm in the town where the young boys is clappin' (Clappin)
You runnin' around with the lieutenant and captain (Haha!)
It'll take a lifetime to see 'Kiss

So I just take what I can find
I see no point in living life that right

When you're out here in this jungle
It's wild round here, you don't wanna spend a night round here
When you're out here in this jungle
Ain't nothing nice around here
Trouble's what you find around here
When you're out here in this jungle (in this jungle)
You're always caught in this struggle (in this jungle)
But you keep asking for trouble
You love, you love when trouble comes your way, your way, your way

[Verse 1 Professor Green]
Welcome to Hackney
A place where I think somebody's been playing Jumanji
A Manor where men are like animals
And they'll yam on you like they yam on food
Cats with claws that'll stab a youth, act bad and catch a slap or two
We don't applaud success, all we clap are tools
London ain't cool to cruise through where the hunters prey
Looking to lunch today
And your chains looking like fresh fruit to a hungry ape
They'll eat on you, then laugh about it like Hyenas do
So stick to breezing through, like cheetahs do, or be a piece of food

But you keep asking for trouble
You love, you love when trouble comes your way, your way, your way

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
It's blitz amidst the strife here, got kids with sticks and knives here
It's hype here, we know no different prick;
It's just life here, life the way we know from young the way we're shown
Stacked trapped in flats where our front doors don't face the road
Got CID spinning round in cars, shifting criminals at large
It's hard, not to think the bits are just a bing without the bars
Jealousy's what the cheddar brings
For the cheddar it's anything goes
Low enough to rob newlyweds for their wedding ring

[Bridge: Maverick Sabre]
Every day is warring, never give a warning
Violence is the only way you settle things
Every day is hating, money that I'm making
Jealous cause I'm moving on to better things
Every day is fighting, rolling in the night now
All you do is watch everyone else get far, you say that life is hard
When you're out here in this jungle
[Hook: Professor Green & Maverick Sabre]
When you're out here in this jungle
It's wild round here, you don't wanna spend a night round here

You can tell me
I'm the bigger man here
Oh it's true
You're all prettier now
Than the last time
But the words aren't coming through
And I'm stranded and I'm starry-eyed

Oh why, won't you wash out of me

There's broken glass all around my feet
Laid my plans so carelessly
What's the story
With my old friends
Drunk and lonely
To a man
How I love 'em all
As the days slip by
And they're all following my lead
Oh why, does the rain fall o'er

Their CDs is ass
Toilet seat, shoulda took a crap on them

[Verse 1]
Want to know where the hell I've been?
In the stu' making hits, on the highway trafficking
Back in the lab with Mac again
Hot 97 bars -- we're going back-to-back again
Who said my flow ain't the best?
My Intratec turn foes to vegetables
Y'all dudes ain't thugs, y'all Huxtables
Y'all want me waiting outside your vestibule?
How do you like Mya/Jay-Z?
My .380 get the best of you
Guy, if a nigga survive
I come back with the streetsweeper, hit the rest of you
Yup, I make a mess of you
Closed casket cause your family'll hate the view
Only time y'all fake-ass rappers gonna make it on the tube
When I make y'all make the news
Y'all know I'm making moves
Free money, Oprah money, Free equate the two
Put y'all niggas to sleep
Hope the pastor awake -- he got a brand-new wake to do
I'm the man y'all hate to love
Motherfuckers probably hate me cause
I'm in the lab all night, in the lab all day
That's the shit y'all hate to do
Niggas can't flow like Freezer, go like Free
Get the dough like Freezer
If I take 'em off, leave 'em in the room
Y'all niggas still can't seem to feel to take my shoes
But still I gots to prove
Like M.J., I gots the moves
Balling or dancing -- I go to Fif' crib, get lost in the mansion
Come to my crib, get murdered in the suburbs
Take cash, get blast with the Mossberg
Bag 'em, toe-tag 'em
Then toss 'em in the earth

I'm gonna obey y'all thirst
Since you want another verse cause y'all want me to rap again
Philly Freezer back like Sprite again
Like Sean Paul, y'all gotta give me a light again
But I don't smoke, don't pass the dro to him
Smoke MC's, you could bring me a bowl of them
They're like African slaves to him
I'm a Pilgrim, I'll be happy to bait 'em in
Where's my plate?
MC's get ate, I don't care if there's eight of them
Or eighteen hundred; two pairs of Louis cost eighteen hundred
Free so fly -- that's why your chick always suck me off
And she tell me, ""Don't stop, keep coming""
So I keep coming, flow keep coming
Freezer need dough like Phillip Drummond
Y'all my adopted sons like Arnold, Willis
I'm a six series wheeler
Used to be on times with mine but

Seen people reach levels thought they'd never achieve
Silhouettes waitin' in the wings ready to D
Thirsty sheists who need at least a buck to breathe

Cut the check, and yo, it better be as heavy as anvil
Next joint comin', all bets is canceled
Nigga Black Ink, Grand Wizzard, Gee Financial
We finna have the whole industry at a standstill
See me put the system on lock like Camp Hill
So get wit' them endorsements, and call reinforcements
'Cause my clique come a full sizable portion
[Hook]
When the saint on the ground with his nine on line
With the niggers who grind with King Kong hittin' Thailand
Give it here. and don’t say nuthin'
Just give it here, give it here and don’t say nuthin'
When the team on the set with the guns gone clap
Gettin' down on everything, hmmm, cut the check
Give it here, and don't say nuthin
Just give it here, give it here and don't say nuthin"
