Dont Stop,Child Rebel Soldier,['hip hop'],"[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
Ugh, what

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Explain yourself, how you sound like me?
The motherfucking Skateboard P
Knowing that you're Milo, playing games like Cee-lo
In a tight situation like speedos
You can have it your way like Carlito
My niggas would be happy to give y'all torpedoes
And have your car twisted like a blunt
For you faggot-ass niggas that like to front
I'm on some BBC Bape shit, I'm on some cake shit
In the kitchen with the heat, making beats in my apron
You hating and you want to erase it
Close your eyes when you know you can't take it
My flow interrupts your homeostasis
I Rolls-Royce it on a regular basis
You talk street shit, it sound like sweet shit
Straight licorice, you niggas sound ticklish
80K large for the Hermès dream
Purple croc in all your magazines
Hunger strike yourself, look like Céline
Dion, me and my niggas like Freon
Your bitch is on my pecan, she got an ass you can eat on
Try to play tough like the leather on a Vuitton
I hit it 'til I could seat on, tryna get her freak on
Ask me to R. Kelly ya and get peed on
I said, ""That ain't me, ma""
That eight behind me still got the burner
Yes, the Enzo is still black like Sojourner
Truth, I might have just loosened a tooth
Spitting what I did in the booth, I'm out, poof
[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Carrera, raised in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle era
Water-bearer tell the truth, I dare you
You lie, so eat this whole bottle of these jalapeño peppers
For terror made in America too live
Fuck the property or give me my props properly
High off life, this high technology, DeVry
I rep Muhammad Ali, more like rap-ology
My policy's not to be dishonestly deprived
So gimme that, gimme that, keep God where my city at
I'm like Steak With Fries but never died
They wanna Ghostface, wanna be me
But they will post-haste follow me into the afterlife
That means you going right after I've
But I'm the hero, sorta like Jack Sparrow
So some way, somehow, I have survived
Ha, ha, surprised?
Who is he that we see coming over the tides?
In a speed boat, boatload of pride
Fall of Rome, dress-shirted and mastermind tie
He what happens when rapping and avant garde fashion collides
OMG, it's the C from the CRS
LOL-ing at you haters, tell your BFFs like

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Yes, Mr. West, turn that new Child Rebel
Loud as a badass child level
Who need a chorus? We do it Tyrannosaurus
Tyrone, it's been a year with no phone
Could you explain how high is your zone?
We'll take the plane, rub his nose in cocaine
There's hoes in magazines you layin' saying you're lame
And for the hate in advance, pull down your pants
Make 'em kiss both cheeks like we living in France
Diamonds blue, his business manager's Jewish
And if I get sued, my lawyers Jews
Some girls do grab the cojones
Say, ""You got enough diamonds to at least Sierra loan us""
Brand new Ferraris, I gotta make the donuts
CRS is like a hip-hop Christmas bonus
Niggas is hating on the internet, I couldn't tell
I was too busy rapping G.O.O.D. as hell
I was too busy flying, parasail
To Colette to get the new shit that Paris sell
Tarantino, Da Vinci, getting Benjis
Get half-off at Fendi, half of that's to Cindy's
Hopped out the spaceship, put my Mork in Mindy
Popped too many corks to let you dorks offend me
Props in New York but Chi-Town's the city
Get my groupie hoochies Gucci, Monica Belluccis
Are those the real millionaires or the bendies?
I'm so ultra, I'm even over Oprah
But let me check your account, haha, no sir"
Wild Horses,The Rolling Stones,"['rock', 'alternative', 'blues', 'metal']","[Verse 1]
Childhood living is easy to do
The things you wanted, I bought them for you
Graceless lady, you know who I am
You know I can't let you slide through my hands

[Chorus]
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away

[Verse 2]
I watched you suffer a dull, aching pain
Now you decided to show me the same
No sweeping exits or offstage lines
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind

[Chorus]
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away

[Verse 3]
I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie
I have my freedom, but I don't have much time
Faith has been broken, tears must be cried
Let's do some living after we die
[Chorus]
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some day

[Chorus]
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some day"
Thieves in the Night,Black Star,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'alternative', 'jazz', 'blues', 'rock']","[Intro: Talib Kweli & Mos Def]
Yo D, what? Come on, yeah
What? What? Come on, yeah

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli & Both]
""Give me the fortune, keep the fame"" said my man Louis, I
Agreed, know what he mean because we live the truest lie
I asked him why we follow the law of the bluest eye
He looked at me, he thought about it, was like, ""I'm clueless, why?""
The question was rhetorical, the answer is horrible
Our morals are out of place and got our lives full of sorrow
And so, tomorrow comin' later than usual
Waitin' on someone to pity us
While we find the beauty in the hideous
They say money's the root of all evil, but I can't tell
You know what I mean? — Pesos, francs, yens, cowrie shells
Dollar bills, or is it the mind-state that's ill?
Creatin' crime rates to fill the new prisons they build
Over money and religion, there's more blood to spill
The wounds of slaves in cotton fields that never heal
What's the deal?
A lot of cats who buy records are straight broke
But my language universal, they be recitin' my quotes
While R&B singers hit bad notes, we rock the boat of thought
That my man Louis' statements just provoked
Caught up in conversations of our personal worth
Brought up through endangered species status on the planet Earth
Survival tactics means bustin' gats to prove you hard
Your firearms are too short to box with God
Without faith, all of that is illusionary
Raise my son — no vindication of manhood necessary
[Chorus: Mos Def, Talib Kweli & Both]
Not strong, only aggressive
Not free, we only licensed
Not compassionate, only polite
Now, who the nicest?
Not good, but well behaved
Chasin' after death so we can call ourselves brave?
Still livin' like mental slaves
Hidin' like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis makin' you look twice
Hidin' like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis makin' you look twice

[Verse 2: Mos Def & Both]
Yo, I'm sure that everybody out listenin' agree
That everythin' you see ain't really how it be
A lot of jokers out runnin' in place, chasin' the style
Be a lot goin' on beneath the empty smile
Most cats in my area be lovin' the hysteria
Synthesized surface conceals the interior
America — land of opportunity, mirages and camouflages
More than usually
Speakin' loudly, sayin' nothin', you confusin' me, you losin' me
Your game is twisted, want me enlisted in your usury
Foolishly, most men join the ranks cluelessly
Buffoonishly accept the deception, believe the perception
Reflection rarely seen across the surface of the looking glass
Walkin' the street, wonderin' who they be lookin' past
Lookin' gassed with them imported designer shades on
Stars shine bright, but the light rarely stays on
Same song — just remixed, different arrangement
Put you on a yacht, but they won't call it the slave ship
Strangeness, you don't control us, you barely hold this
Screamin' ""Brand new!"", when they just sanitized the old shit
Suppose it's just another clever Jedi mind trick
That they been runnin' across stars through all the time with
I find it's distressin', there's never no in-between
We either niggas or Kings, we either bitches or Queens
The deadly ritual seems immersed in the perverse
Full of short attention spans, short tempers and short skirts
Long barrel automatics released in short bursts
The length of black life is treated with short worth
Get yours first, them other niggas secondary
That type of illin' that be fillin' up the cemetery
This life is temporary, but the soul is eternal
Separate the real from the lie — let me learn you
Not strong, only aggressive 'cause the power ain't directed
That's why we are subjected to the will of the oppressive
Not free — we only licensed, not live — we just excitin'
'Cause the captors own the masters to what we writin'
Not compassionate, only polite — we well trained
Our sincerity's rehearsed in stage, it's just a game
Not good, but well behaved, 'cause the cameras survey
Most of the things that we think, do or say
We chasin' after death just to call ourselves brave
But everyday, next man meet with the grave
I give a damn if any fan recall my legacy
I'm tryin' to live life in the sight of God's memory
Like that, y'all
[Interlude: Mos Def & Talib Kweli]
A lot of people don't understand the true criterion of things
Can't just accept the appearance, have to get the true essence
They ain't lookin' around

[Chorus: Talib Kweli, Mos Def, & Both]
Not strong, only aggressive
Not free, we only licensed
Not compassionate, only polite
Now, who the nicest?
Not good, but well behaved
Chasin' after death so we can call ourselves brave
Still livin' like mental slaves
Hidin' like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis makin' you look twice
Hidin' like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis makin' you look twice
Hidin' like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis makin' you look twice
Hidin' like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis makin' you look twice

[Outro: Mos Def & Talib Kweli]
Stop hidin', stop hidin'
Stop hidin' yo' face (Yes, c'mon)
Stop hidin', stop hidin' (Celebratin' death)
'Cause ain't no hidin' place
Stop hidin', stop hidin'
Stop hidin' yo' face
Stop hidin', stop hidin' 'cause ain't no hidin' place
Not strong
Not free
Not compassionate
We well trained

Somewhere on the desktop lives
The zip file mixtape of the next pop kid
Let's not kid ourselves, be clear
You see me here I run zShare
And MegaUpload
With my forever steppin' up flow
Just know I'm just wakin' up so
When I yawn, ya'll get more
Not feelin' how I explore
Alt+F4
No one can tell me what I can and cannot do
Tell me be quiet and I holla like Yahoo

[Verse 2]
Can't nobody stop me, I'm sorry
I was raised in the concrete Safari
You other clowns got hate in your blood
You talk that new shit with Windows 98 in your blood, what?
I don't need some new fad's endorsement
I'm endorsed by these mad important cats
With more than enough to buy your life
But I'm wireless
And your mice
No strings attached when I sling my raps
Real name when I bring the facts
Seen in your favorite magazine with a great pose
Cause I don't pose
Cause I hate pose-ers
Except for one photoshoot
For Complex, what the heck was I supposed to do
I had fun
I acted mad young
I was flyer than the rest of them
Why am I addressing them
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You ain't catch when I said put my Mac down
Like I got a girl's top on my lap now
That was mad hot
And mad foul
Now that I said it all here think back now
Mac lipgloss
Mac laptop
Girl's top on my lap, that's mad hot
Wow
How arrogant of me to explain a hot bar
From a track I did for free
Sorry 9th, I thought they took care of that shit
I hope Reo-G don't think I did some wack shit
I know how some cats don't play favorites
But I need a favor alright? Okay player
Tell everyone to stop puttin' up hate posts
Before I find they IP address
And straight ghost

Kill 'em or send em a virus
Let me chill before they hack my girl's Sidekick"
The Road Not Taken,Robert Frost,['country'],"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth.

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference."
Still Fly Freestyle,Drake,['hip hop'],"[Chorus]
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still pullin' out the phantom and these haters can't stand him
Nigga I'm still doin my thing
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around
Nigga I'm still doin' my thing

[Verse]
Responsible for everything you listen to
While mediocre talent proceeds to try and condition you
Took over my city and I never asked permission to;
Started poppin' bottles cuz it's ATL tradtion to
Celebrate at Bymark, fuck 'em at the SoHo
If there ain't a elevator in it it's a no go
Coldest thing droppin' and these bitches want a snow blow
And they just give me head while the haters give me promo
And man, my DJ shoulda won that
Nelissa and Wristpect, Man the city owe us one back
All these old heads keep they minds on one track
And me, I run Toronto, holla at me when you done laps
Roll around with Niko, party with Azuka
Shout goes out to 1da, shout goes out to future
Shout goes out to Getty, motherfucker I am ready
And whoever got the torch just can't seem to hold it steady
Cuz I see the flame flickerin', ex-girls bickerin'
Got these women jockin' me from Heart Lake Road to Pickerin
Tried to send my nigga short some syrup out in Michigan
But my connect said it'd take a minute if you're listenin'
Please start doin' you, I been doin' me
And I'm a staple in my city, you can never ruin me
Rappers are emotional, critics be reviewin' me
But I got love for everybody even if you're suin' me
My brother P-Reign knows, we fuck with the same hoes
Plus he taught me how to spot a officer in plain clothes
Starin' at you pussy niggas, all I see is rainbows
Hoppin' on a jet to every single Lil Wayne show
Me and Lil Jazzy, please do not harass me
Just holla if you got me and fuck you if you had me
Shout out to Brian E, shout out to Photo Will
Shout out to Oliver and 40, man you know the deal
Shout out to Mayhem, shout out to P-Plus
The names I mention are crucial; you gonna need us
And life is good, everything is just fine

I could sacrifice a line like (mumbles)
Yeah, haha, I swear I really fuckin' does it

I don't eat no meat, no dairy, no sweets
Only ripe vegetables, fresh fruit and whole wheat
I'm from the old school, my household smell like soul food, bro
Curry falafel, barbecued tofu
No fish though, no candy bars, no cigarettes
Only ganja and fresh-squeezed juice from oranges
Exercising daily to stay healthy
And I rarely drink water out the tap, cause it's filthy

[Verse 2: M1]
Lentil soup is mental fruit
And ginger root is good for the yout'
Fresh vegetable with dem ital stew
Sweet yam fries with the green calalloo
Careful how you season and prepare your foods
Cause you don't wanna lose vitamins and minerals
And that's the jewel
Life brings life, it's valuable
So I eat what comes from the ground, it's natural
Let your food be your medicine (uh huh)
No Excederin (uh uh)
Strictly herb, generate in the sun, cause I got melanin
And drink water, eight glasses a day
'Cause that's what they say
[Chorus: stic.man]
They say you are what you eat, so I strive to eat healthy
My goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy
Cause true wealth comes from good health, and wise ways
We got to start taking better care of ourselves
They say you are what you eat, so I strive to eat healthy
My goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy
Cause true wealth comes from good health, and wise ways
We got to start taking better care of ourselves, be

Momma had a baby and its head popped off
Head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off
But Momma don't want me, the next thing I know, I'm gettin' dropped off
Gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off
Ring-ring-ring on the doorbell of the next door neighbors, on their front porch
Their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch

And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, do-si-do now, curtains up, the show must go now
Ring-around-the-rosie, the show's over, you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame was supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off-and-on? This ain't what I chose to be

Only for a night, with no repeat
Baby, you wanna leave and never call

Uhh, I dream filthy
My moms and pops mixed me with Jamaican Rum and Whiskey
Huh, what a set off
Shoulda pushed him dead off, wipe the sweat off (uhh)
'Cause in this world I'm dead off, squeeze lead off
Benz sped off, ain't no shook hands in Brook-land
Army fatigues bring fatigue, to enemies, look man
You wanna see me locked up, shot up
Moms crouched up over the casket, screamin' ""BASTARD!""
Cryin', know my friends is lyin'
Y'all know who killed him, filled him with the lugers from they Rugers
Or the Desert, dyin' ain't the shit, but it's pleasant
Kinda quiet, watch my niggas bring the riot
Givin' cats the opposite of diets
You gain thirty pounds when you die no lie, lazy eye
I was high when they hit me, took a few cats with me
Shit, I need the company (uh-huh)
Apologies in order, to T'Yanna my daughter
If it was up to me you would be with me
Sorta like Daddy Dearest, my vision be the clearest
Silencers so you can't hear it
Competition still fear it, shit don't ask me
I went from ashy to nasty to classy, and still

The Animal Soul,Rumi,['country'],"There's part of us that's like an itch
Call it the animal soul, a foolishness
That when we're in it, we make
Hundreds of others around us itchy

And there is an intelligent soul
With another desire, more like sweet basil
Or the feel of a breeze

Listen and be thankful even for scolding
That comes from the intelligent soul
It flows out close to where you flowed out

But that itchiness wants to put food
In our mouths that will make us sick

Feverish with the aftertaste of kissing
A donkey's rump. It's like blackening your robe
Against a kettle without being anywhere
Near a table of companionship
The truth of a being human is an empty table
Made of soul-intelligence

Gradually reduce what you give your animal soul
The bread that after all overflows from sunlight

The animal soul itself spilled out
And sprouted from the other

Taste more often what nourishes your clear light
And you'll have less use for the smoky oven

You'll bury that baking equipment in the ground!

Hand me an eighth, beam me up and land me in space
I'ma sit on top of the world, and shit on Brandy and Mase
I'm more than ill, scarier than a white journalist
In a room with Lauryn Hill human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot and people'll feel me
'Cause I'ma still be The Mad Rapper whether I got money or not
As long as I'm on pills and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddling, making fun of your yacht
But I would like an award for the best rapper to get
One mic in The Source and a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might just end up back strikin' at Ford
And you wonder what the fuck I need more Vicodin for?
Everybody's pissin' me off: even the No Limit Tank
Looks like a middle finger sideways flippin' me off
No shit, I'm a grave danger to my health
Why else would I kill you then jump in a grave and bury myself?

[Verse 2]
I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrollin' corners
Lookin' for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beatin' James Todd Senior
Across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in a wild hood as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed ninth grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death, as I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind; you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge, and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowin' mine out
Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now

My laser disc'll make you take a razor to your wrist
Make you satanistic, make you take the pistol to your face
And place the clip and cock it back
And let it go until your brains are rippin' out your skull
So bad to sew you back would be a waste of stitches
I'm not a role model, I don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and Hailie Jade is Shady's business
And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when Gilbert's paid to make me dishwash?
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You made me get a bigger attitude than eighty Kim Scotts
And she almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got
I knew that ""Just the Two of Us"" would make you hate me this much
And ""Just the Two of Us,"" that ain't got shit to do with us
And our personal life, it's just words on a mic
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig
But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch!
[Chorus]
(Just pull the plug!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)

The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,T.S. Eliot,['dance'],"S’io credesse che mia risposta fosse
A persona che mai tornasse al mondo,
Questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse.
Ma perciocchè giammai di questo fondo
Non tornò vivo alcun, s’i’odo il vero,
Senza tema d’infamia ti rispondo.

Let us go then, you and I,
When the evening is spread out against the sky
Like a patient etherized upon a table;
Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,
The muttering retreats
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:
Streets that follow like a tedious argument
Of insidious intent
To lead you to an overwhelming question …
Oh, do not ask, “What is it?”
Let us go and make our visit.

In the room the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.
The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,
The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes
Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,
Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,
Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,
Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,
And seeing that it was a soft October night,
Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.

And indeed there will be time
For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,
Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;
There will be time, there will be time
To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;
There will be time to murder and create,
And time for all the works and days of hands
That lift and drop a question on your plate;
Time for you and time for me,
And time yet for a hundred indecisions,
And for a hundred visions and revisions,
Before the taking of a toast and tea.

In the room the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.

And indeed there will be time
To wonder, “Do I dare?” and, “Do I dare?”
Time to turn back and descend the stair,
With a bald spot in the middle of my hair—
(They will say: “How his hair is growing thin!”)
My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,
My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin—
(They will say: “But how his arms and legs are thin!”)
Do I dare
Disturb the universe?
In a minute there is time
For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.
For I have known them all already, known them all:—
Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,
I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;
I know the voices dying with a dying fall
Beneath the music from a farther room.
So how should I presume?

And I have known the eyes already, known them all—
The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,
And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,
When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,
Then how should I begin
To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?
And how should I presume?

And I have known the arms already, known them all—
Arms that are braceleted and white and bare,
[But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!]
Is it perfume from a dress
That makes me so digress?
Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.
And should I then presume?
And how should I begin?

Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets
And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes
Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows?…
I should have been a pair of ragged claws
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.

And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!
Smoothed by long fingers,
Asleep … tired … or it malingers,
Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me,
Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,
Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,
Though I have seen my head [grown slightly bald] brought in upon a platter,
I am no prophet—and here’s no great matter;
I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,
And in short, I was afraid.

And would it have been worth it, after all,
After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,
Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,
Would it have been worth while
To have bitten off the matter with a smile,
To have squeezed the universe into a ball
To roll it toward some overwhelming question,
To say: “I am Lazarus, come from the dead,
Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all”—
If one, settling a pillow by her head,
Should say: “That is not what I meant at all,
That is not it, at all.”

And would it have been worth it, after all,
Would it have been worth while
After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,
After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor—
And this, and so much more?—
It is impossible to say just what I mean!
But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:
Would it have been worth while
If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,
And turning toward the window, should say:
“That is not it at all,
That is not what I meant, at all.”

No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;
Am an attendant lord, one that will do
To swell a progress, start a scene or two,
Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,
Deferential, glad to be of use,
Politic, cautious, and meticulous;
Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;
At times, indeed, almost ridiculous—
Almost, at times, the Fool.

I grow old … I grow old …
I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.

Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?
I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.
I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.

I do not think that they will sing to me.

I have seen them riding seaward on the waves
Combing the white hair of the waves blown back
When the wind blows the water white and black.

We have lingered in the chambers of the sea
By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown
Till human voices wake us, and we drown."
Fight For You,Morgan Page,"['alternative', 'pop']","[Intro]
(Oh)

[Verse 1]
Meetin' you here, the night's alight with midnight cheer
Our dust still unsettled, I feel the pluckin' of our petals

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm drawin' circles don't you know
Protect the seed that wants to grow
To a garden, pardon my territory

[Chorus]
I'd fight for you
I never knew that I could feel this way
I'm right for you
This kinda love don't happen everyday
(No, no, no, oh)
(No, no, no, oh)

[Verse 2]
Be friendly but cautious, you're gonna have to count your losses
Easily attracted, but dangerous to get distracted
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm drawin' circles don't you know
Protect the seed that wants to grow
To a garden, pardon my territory

[Chorus]
I'd fight for you
I never knew that I could feel this way
I'm right for you
This kinda love don't happen everyday
I'd fight for you
I didn't wanna have to raise my voice
I'm right for you
You really leave me with no choice

[Bridge]
So what do you want and what are you thinkin'?
Isn't it about time you stuck up for me?
But what you can't see is we're under siege
And I only fight because I believe
Not gonna share you no

[Chorus]
I'd fight for you
I never knew that I could feel this way
I'm right for you
This kinda love don't happen everyday
I'd fight for you
I didn't wanna have to raise my voice
I'm right for you
You really leave me with no choice
I'd fight for you
I didn't wanna have to raise my voice
I'm right for you
You really leave me with no choice
[Outro]
I'd fight for you (For you, for you)
I'm right for you (For you)

Hustlin the grands, hustle cause I can
Hustle like my mother was in love with rubber bands

I am not a sucker, sucker mother was a Stan

If ten is meaning best then we are votin who the man
Jumpin out the Lam-borghini, they like damn
Wanna be like him so I can get me one of them

Money come from Pam, money come to hand
That's the bitches manager, I want her, I'mma span
Ask me where I been, I've been spending Ben

And the streets is saying that boy so real

The Longest Road deadmau5 Remix,Morgan Page,"['pop', 'r&b', 'jazz', 'rock', 'alternative', 'hip hop', 'blues']","Giddy up and gold mine
Different place, different time
All the stars are in their prime
Pastel trailer park, stars so bright to hide the dark
All is quiet in the yard

Giddy up and gold dust, all the cars turn to rust
You've got no means for wanderlust
Pastel trailer park, stars so bright to hide the dark
All is quiet in the yard

If you are so frequently in love
If you prefer it all to me then my love
You go down the longest road to nowhere
You pull it apart and you're just left there

Giddy up and gold mine, horse dust down time
Its my life, its my time, we've been gettin' nowhere
Gold mine, different place, different time
Hold me down, Hold me down
Hope will be found, Follow me
Giddy up and gold mine
Different place, different time
All the stars are in their prime
Pastel trailer park, stars so bright to hide the dark
All is quiet in the yard


If you are so frequently in love
If you prefer it all to me then my love
You go down the longest road to nowhere
You pull it apart and your just left there

They're waiting for it, you're waiting for it
You're waiting for me, you're waiting for it
You're waiting for it, you're waiting in it

And you're waving in it, and you're craving in it
If you fill my cup with all you must
To speak from something

If you are so frequently in love
If you prefer it all to me then my love
If you are so frequently in love
If you prefer it all to me then my love
The longest road
The longest road
To see the longest road
The longest road
The longest road"
Who Killed It?,Nas,['hip hop'],"[Verse 1]
Look here see, Pretty Mike shanked Two-Face Al over some gal
Found the body dead in the isles
Death by strangulation, microphone cord, a dirty broad
Guess they'll never play it again Sam
Damn that was my jam, now she's on the lam
She made it out with 200 grand, what a scam
While these two compete on who's the star of the show
Golden legs there makes off with the dough
I read the paper there with Joe the Butcher
""He said one glance is all it took ya, she's a real looker
They say her old mans a bootlegger
Transporting in any weather and at this rate we'll never get her""
Fellas, think it's time to call it a night
All this talk of this mystery dame's getting me tight
Thought I saw her in my eyesight, right
Hate to spoil the party, ""What are you guys havin', the same?
Waiter another round for the gang.""
It's strange how I always felt outta place
Joe the Butcher's my ace, but in comes Freckle Face
So I said ""See you later.""
'Fore I hurt him and his two ugly thumb breakers
He met them in Louisiana wrestling gators
An idiot can tell they're involved with the caper
So I pulled the revolver on my waist up
Between the patrol car and the gray truck
Behind the street lamp was a silhouette
White gloves and a real long cigarette
What do you know all this time she's got me in her scope
She spoke, says, ""The devil got you guys by the throat
Your conspiracy theories won't work without evidence
That's the reason why Eric B. is not president.""
[Break]
Well what do ya say
Ya see?
Ya see?
Ya see?

[Verse 2]
Look here see, I know you got soul you're trying to hide it
How did you kill a man out in Cypress
One Eyed Charlie, he only hangs with the criminal minded
Says you guys did it doggy style is he lyin'
She says, ""Walk this way, I'll tell you a children's story.""
We hit the bodega got her a few 40's
We jumped in my ride we drove and she cried
Twisted off the cap there and opened her mouth wide
Swallowed it, whole bottle's half empty
Drinks like a fish, now she's past tipsy
The truth came out as we got to her suave house
Chopped and screwed her mouth and sat me on the couch
I said, ""It's gettin late, come on, give it to me straight
Who's ya sponsor lady?"" She says, ""Bill Gates.""
What are ya born '77 or '78?
She says, ""Nah it goes way to an earlier date
Slave times,"" claims the slaves said rhymes
But she fell in love with some fella named Clive
Who? ""Clive Campbell from Sedgwick Ave
The Bronx."", now she shows me the cash
I said who's Clive, don't play with me skirt
She said Clive Campbell, he's Kool Herc
[Break]
Ah-ha!
Ah-ha!

[Verse 3]
Listen up sweetheart now we gettin somewhere
As she's talking, she starts vanishing in thin air
But before she dropped the money bag on the floor and died
She said if you really love me I'll come back alive"

(J.D. you need to stop!)
You know what this need (this need me)
You know what this need (this need me)
Uh, I drop this in the club when I be DJ'n
From left to right, everybody start swaying
I be, I be seeing girls tapping niggas on the shoulder, saying
""Teach me how to dougie, teach me, teach me how to dougie""
Then I pull it back, start it from the top, and all the bitches love me
I'm the 24-hour stunner roadrunner nigga, can't catch me
Get green like Bill Bexby, damn I mean Bixby
Stay in the 6-speed, my corner in the club is where the fucking chicks be
And the flicks be, popping like the red carpet
That California swag with a little college-park shit
Fat ass, small waist, lil' Cali-Park chick
Came up to me, came-came up to me and said
""Teach me how to dougie, teach me, teach me how to dougie""
If you really wanna know, then girl you gotta go to D-Town
""Teach me how to dougie, teach me, teach me how to dougie""
But until then shawty, check me, check me out now

Everybody love me

They be like ""Smoove, you know you gotta rip on the remix""
I'm telling these guards, ""better work on your defense""
I'm Kobe in the clutch, you other niggas suck
And I'm no B. Jennings, getting Milwaukee Bucks!
What's the deal? I'm fresh like dougie and I keep getting pussy
Cause all my bitches love me
And my swag bring em' in nigga not my money
It ain't tricking if you got it but I am no dummy

[Verse 3 - B.o.B]
Ay, they be like B.o.B, (What?) ""how you do that in Atlanta?"" (Yes)
She said she like my dougie now she jigging off my grammar
Well basically she got it down and dirty like Dianna
I got the Cali puff, you can't find that in Atlanta
I hit her with that flex till she getting preg
You heard what I said, hit her with a test, then she know what's next
I teach ya how to dougie, teach ya how to swag walk
I ain't talking about that swag that come in a plastic bag (Oh no)
This is ain't a infomercial, this does not come with a tag
I'll take the game, beat it up, and leave it on this bag
B.o.B. up on this track, in a Jason mask, so I'm finna hack
Everything in sight, nothing's left in tact
I'm, stuck to the seat with no seat-belt
Don't worry about me cause I don't need help
Ride around down A-Town up 85 with a phone on my hip

Okay, my swagger on flight, my dougie so fresh
Kill it dancing, now I'm on like wings on a jet
Shucks, we brought it to the hood, like a brand new set
Cali what I rep got the game by the neck
Something like a necklace, shout-out to Dallas, Texas
They taught me this dance, now these hoes cooking me breakfast
D-Town boogie, with a little Cali spin
Remix on the track, you know we had to get it in

Mr. Murk-A-Verse, killa remixes
Young Bow Wizzle with that Cali Swag District
Backpack on, snap-back on
Modern day LL, girls can't leave him alone
Phantom two-tone, money too grown

Smoking on that Cali good got a nigga high as fuck

Cell Therapy,Goodie Mob,['hip hop'],"[Verse 1: Khujo]
When the scene unfolds
Young girls, thirteen years old
Expose themselves to any Tom, Dick, and Hank
Got more stretch marks than these hoes holl'in' they got rank
See SEGA ain't in this new world order
Dem experimenting in Atlanta, Georgia
United Nations, overseas, trained assassins
Do search and seize, ain't knocking or asking
They're coming for niggas like me, poor white trash like they
Tricks like her back in slavery
Concentration camps laced with gas pipelines
Infernos outdoors like they had
Back when Adolf Hitler was living in 1945
Listen to me now, believe me later on
In the future, look it up
Where they say it in the Constitution?
That in the event of a race war
Places like Operation Heartbreak Hotel
Moments tear until air tight vents sealed off despair
Dem say expect no mercy
Fool, you should be my least worries
Got to deal with W-2's, 1099's
Unmarked black helicopters swoop down
And try to put missiles in mines
[Chorus]
Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (Nobody now)
Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (Nobody now)

[Verse 2: CeeLo Green]
Me and my family moved in our apartment complex
A gate with a serial code was put up next
The claim that this community is so drug-free
But it don't look that way to me
'Cause I can see the young bloods hanging out at the store 24/7
Junkies looking for a hit of the blow, it's powerful
Oh, you know what else they tryin' to do?
Make a curfew especially for me and you
The traces of the New World Order, time is getting shorter
If we don't get prepared, people, it's gon' be a slaughter
My mind won't allow me to not be curious
My folk don't understand, so they don't take it serious
But every now and then, I wonder if the gate was put up
To keep crime out or keep our ass in

[Chorus]
Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)
Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)
[Verse 3: T-Mo]
Listen up, lil' nigga—I'm talking to you
About what your little ass need to be going through
I fall a victim, too
And I know I shouldn't smoke so much, but I do
With the crew every day—on the average, 'bout four or five
I'm lucky to be alive at sunrise
Now, I realize the cost after I lost my best friend, Bean
I'm recognized as a kin, who am I to tell you to stop smokin'?
Now, you open to disease and colds
And ain't sixteen years old—this shit has got to stop
Let's take a walk through detox
I want out of this hole, I'm in a cell
Under attack—loc' up, folks, they in the hood
Got an eye on every move I make
Open your face to info you ain't know 'cause it's kept low
How the New World Plan reach the planet without the Black man

[Verse 4: Big Gipp]
So what's your aim?
Tryin' to separate me from the blood is disrespect
Like coming in my home and not wiping your feet on the rug
The Citron Absolut has got me bucking
No hang with no phony (Phony)
Look out for the man with the mask on the white pony
On my back are bills staying off my toes, always on my heels
Insane, plain soldiers coming in the dark by plane
To enforce the new system by reign
Tag my skin with your computer chip (Chip)
Run your hand over the scanner to buy your dish now (Now)
No more fishing for your fish (No more fishing for my fish)
Kiss the days of the old days, past ways, gone
Mind blown, conception, protection
My name on your selections but I caught you coming (Coming)
Pow!

Who's that peeking in my window?

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Street poetry is my everyday
But yo, I gotta stop when you trot my way
If I was working at the club, you would not pay
Ayo, my man Phife Diggy, he got something to say

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Haitian
Name is Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation
Told you in the jam that we can get down
Now, let's knock the boots like the group H-Town
You got BBD all on your bedroom wall
But I'm above the rim and this is how I ball
A gritty little something on the New York street
This is how I represent over this here beat
Talking 'bout you
[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Yo, I took you out
But sex was on my mind for the whole damn route
My mind was in a frenzy and a horny state
But I couldn't drop dimes 'cause you couldn't relate

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down (You couldn't relate)
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down (You couldn't relate)
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down

[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
Stretch out your legs, let me make you bawl
Drive you insane, drive you up the wall
Staring at your dome-piece, very strong
Stronger than pride, stronger than Teflon
Take you on the ave and you buy me links
Now I wanna pound the poontang until it stinks
You can be my mama and I'll be your boy

[Verse 5: Phife Dawg]
Original rude boy, never am I coy
You can be a shorty in my ill convoy
Not to come across as a thug or a hood
But hon, you got the goods, like Madelyne Woods
By the way, my name's Malik, the Five-Foot Freak
Let's say we get together by the end of the week
She simply said, ""No"", labelled me a ho
I said, ""How you figure?"" ""My friends told me so""
I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
Word to God, hon, I don't get down like that
[Verse 6: Q-Tip]
I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
Or we could do like Uncle L and swing an ep in my Jeep
Keep it on the down, yo, we keep it discreet
See, I'm not the type of kid to have my biz in the streets

[Verse 7: Phife Dawg]
If my mom don't approve, then I'll just elope
Let me save the little man from inside the boat
Let me hit it from the back, girl, I won't catch a hernia
Bust off on your couch, now you got Seaman's Furniture

[Verse 8: Q-Tip]
Shaheed, Phife and the Extra P
Stacy Beadle, PJ and my man LG
They know the Abstract is really soul on ice
The character is of men, never ever of mice
Shorty, let me tell you 'bout my only vice
It has to do with lots of loving and it ain't nothing nice

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down (It ain't nothing nice)
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down (It ain't nothing nice)
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down"

[Chamillionaire]
You in the presence of the finest
My rims twenty-somethin, age twenty-somethin
Try to count the millions I done made... twenty-somethin?
No homo

I go hard! Its goin down, get ready for the show
I go hard! Mixtape God stepping through the do'
I go hard! Ain't another rapper f-in' with the flow
I go hard! Y'all need to stop actin like you slow
I go... Y'all need to stop actin like you slow
I go hard! Y'all need to stop actin like you slow
I go hard! Y'all need to stop actin like you slow
I go hard! ""Y'all need to stop actin like you slow""
I go hard!

Ay, I'll go at anyone of you dudes that used to hang with the click
Who runnin round makin the threats about how gangster you get
You put your neck on the line, the YOU takin a slip
Do like a chick that won't let me hit and try to stay off my dick
Or I'mma prove that you don't want it with Mufasa, you got the
Warnin it's about to get ugly as Chewbacca
Bout to make me hot as stew pasta, too salsa
Holla in Espanol, cucaracha, tu caca
You see me sittin in it, you can bet that it ain't rented
See the fo'-five infinite Caucasian white tinted
Eyes lookin squinted, they can't tell me that it didn't
Pop eyes, like the ball, white got it like spinach
Chamillitary Mayne, we in the house like tenants
Oh dog, I'm a menace, oh Lord, I'm a dentist
Y'all sound like gimmicks, y'all sound quite finished
And all y'all hang around a bunch of clowns like Grimace(McDonalds)
Meanwhile on the other side of town
Plate full of bullets and another side of rounds
I'm too deep, make a puddle outta nouns
Spit a verse and every person that you love about to drown
I'm a shark in a bloody game of Marco Polo
Dart flyin through the air to mark your polo
Haters try to tell me they don't heart my logo
Others love it so they hug it with their heart, no homo
You a bozo and I am no clown, I am the town
When I step into public, you know it's goin down
When I step back in the city you already know, it's goin down
That I be overseas gettin them G's fall out please, you know it's goin down
Lil Wayne's song describe my smallest bank account silly
A millie millie, a millie, a millie millie millie
I'm movin in it like Diddy, your city's my city
They try to throw me the kitty, the kitty's like ""gimme""
Didn't drop for a minute, bootleggers told me they need me
Looks like the whole region is ready to BCD me
Clowns in the H tryna act like they wanna see me
I'm poppin up like a genie, they disappear like Houdini
You busters must have snorted that Whitney, I am sick G
Peeew, hot, heat seeking missiles be tryna sick me
Wish he, would try to throw it my way and piss me
Off, here's a thought, I make your history a mystery
{*Sound of Twilight Zone theme*} ...Twilight zone
I'm worth two thousand more than me with my ice on
I'm a butcher with a weapon baby, I knife songs
Mo' murder murder, mo' murder, like I like Bone
The only way that you could ever be hotter than me
Is if I don't put out no music and that spot'll be free
Always grindin, any time I ever spotted a G
I was on point like a decimal, a dot or a P-
E-R-I-O-D, no paper out of my reach
Shakin Uncle Sam, I keep a lotta receipts
And nah Cham ain't never the one to bring no sand to the beach
I put the moula in my hand and bring grands to the street, yah
Pullin up in the newest ish, you ain't never knew exist
Baby get inside, darling you can smell the newishness
You can see the platinum, see the clearness and the bluishness
Lookin at my jewellery tryna figure out who my jeweller is
Underground money never disappears
When your mixtape, flow and skill is sick as his
Know its big business, I be on them businesses
You all be actin immature so now I roll with bigger kids
Ridin on 28's, my rims clear a lotta cones
Ridin through the city mayne I hear a lotta clones
Kill a microphone like I'm Killa Kyleon
Bout to change my rap name, (to what?) Killa Clinaclone
I promised that the mic gon' need a mic toe tag
Its still clear, I'm still here and that's despite you're a fag
I left the underground alone and nobody came and took it
Well guess who's back to take it like good lookin
Uh, look in the garage, your cars ain't sick as ours
I done had the doors ajared on plenty cars
I was gettin large while y'all was chillin hard
So the rappers praise the God, (my lord) like synagogue
Just when they thought it was haters win, I'mma hurt 'em all
Just when they thought it was traitors win, I'mma curve the ball
I'm always right but I act like I never heard of wrong
And I know it all like I'm able to give a nerd a call
Clark Kent but I'm sure I can make the shirt come off
Mixtape Messiah 4, its like I'm (click) cocking a burner y'all
""Get ya burners, get ya burners, here we come again""
You know who the streets waiting to see... me
""Get ya burners, get ya burners, here we come again""
Mixtape Messiah part fo', let's go

I try to chase the green face like The Wizard of Oz
Took the yellow brick road, two acquisitive cars
Don't wanna hear nothing real? You should be skipping my parts
My swagger get any higher, I'll be sitting on Mars
I don't post on blogs or chat about what singers gay
I don't switch green names and change up everything I say
I don't let SoundScan allow a lame the right of way
You could sell ten-million and still be not who I'mma play
Car pearly, white as teeth, I guess that you could say I'm flossin
See me and think of green, like Saint Patrick's Day or Boston
I lead and they follow, these rappers guilty of stalkin
The underground was dead but I'm about to leave the coffin"
Seven Nation Army,The White Stripes,"['rock', 'alternative', 'metal', 'blues', 'pop', 'jazz', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back
And I'm talking to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And the message coming from my eyes
Says ""Leave it alone""

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Don't want to hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell
And if I catch it coming back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And the feeling coming from my bones
Says ""Find a home""

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I'm going to Wichita
Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
Right before the Lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me
And I will sing no more

[Pre-Chorus 3]
And the stains coming from my blood
Tell me ""Go back home""

Im Beamin’ Remix,All City Chess Club,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
My aura takes the form of the aurora borealis
Or a floral pattern, more or less a forest to your salad
The neural path I’ve traveled has immediate reaction
Can’t you see that I am beaming? I’ll be leaving in a second
Sipping magic from a chalice, detached from the distractions
At last, I can relax, looking past all of the action
A fraction or a fragment of me actually is present
The rest of me is heavenly, the seventh house’s zenith
Yes, the fence intimidates, it’s meant to keep you out
But let your senses resonate and leap it in a bound
Cause freedom isn’t found inside a visa or a crown
And even the voice of reason couldn’t speak it out loud
But mortals are immortal when their soul has been imported
To a source that is more sovereign, important to the whole
This is the warmest moment of a poet turned heroic
As he slowly comes to focus, go ahead and watch me glow

[Verse 2: Charles Hamilton]
Rey Mysterio flow, staying clear
Of makeup-smeared hating queers, making clear this is spiritual
Throw a spear at you all (pew!), church final
Your funeral in an arena, you searching for fire (shh)
Or titles (whoa), or tidal waves (uh)
Tie the game like a shot from outside when it’s 95 to 98
The throw slid into you left-side broke (niggas) (beam)
Boa constrictor, choking (niggas), the grown man (beam)
Pause mean your controllers get broken (niggas) (beam)
Anarchy in the Ford, you need to focus (niggas) (Beam)
Love, I get none, like saying no to niggas
Hamiltonian’s loneliness, so I hold my (beam) (niggas)
I logged on to see a c-section, a gross display
Sleep never, and Rolaids, deep lessons won’t go away
I keep pressing like my phone is afraid
To be a star, so I end it and pound it, see what the code can say
[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
C-C-C-Calling all the good rappers, had to get my crew together
Fire like the fire-flower, flier than the super feather
Superman with two propellers, enter that, ninja rap
You can call it Super Shredder, boss scene, Ross theme
You can call it super better, new to this, Ludacris
Foolishness, Lu been doing this since super letters
So I can’t spell and can’t mail it out
If you can’t feel, it’s too full, you can’t peel it out
Showboating at the show, but you can’t sell it out
I’m on the sea shepherd deck, helping the whales out
All my egos in the mirror, checking themselves out
Tweeters in the trunk, helping the twelves out
The speakers on bump, the rappers on acne
This track is what would happen if the rasslers met the mathletes
Yes sir, then the Chess Club got dressed up
And went and took all the bitches of the athletes

[Verse 4: Chuck Inglish]
Big up to what’s been up, nigga
Pin-ups from when we clicked up and posed for these pictures
Good, nd the kids connected up, and they clicked snap
Hollering, “Yeah, we weighed it on the iPhone scale app!”
Without fail, the best to ever do it just will
Haven’t done it all, but we got copied real well, though
But it ain’t no sweat, I got a whole outfit
And a new fitted cap that I ain’t wore out yet
(Check, check, check) And I’m beamin’
Yeah, and I seen it, like a twenty-seven inch Zenith
Projected widescreen, now they got it 3D
Now we NBA’d up from development leagues
[Verse 5: Mikey Rocks]
Ayo, they pale in comparison to stories we tell
Man, he see me on the hovercraft and he got a sail
Bubble-ass Brenda, stacked up in the window
Of whatever ‘Lac truck pick her up, retail
Nigga, what? It just hit me like a Mack truck semi
On my last trip to Sydney in the Sheraton lobby
Grab my coattails and get a grip (grab ‘em) You want the truth?
Well, the truth is, this is it, pointing out the differences
This is exquisite shit, riveting, isn’t it?
Lizard king loafers on swoll' when I’m kicking it
Joe, the live nigga, real rig-a-marole
You a handshake away, and them fingers is cold

[Verse 6: Blu]
Boom! Touch art, lush heart, brush my niggas’ shoulder off
Now that blessed soldier know that protocol, show me y’all’s
Maybe not, play me not, say we not remote at all
Roger that, scholars back, solid black, go God
Gobble gats, go hard, condom snapped, so raw
Pompous asshole, flash flow, turn your soul on
So gone, strode strong through your lawn ’til the dawn
Tell your mom, name another real as John, kill a song
‘Cause when you feel it, and it make your ass chill and calm
Paying more than just attention for that glass I’m sipping on
Dog, I would travel half the globe to kiss a broad
Kidding, ma? Scratch backs, bringing out them kitten paws
And pull a bottle out that cabinet while the kitchen’s warm
Back to attending business, do not lay them digits wrong
Dipping all gangsta, but a renegade, no Crip or John
This is Blu, shit is true, pyramid, period
[Verse 7: Diggy Simmons]
I know what you’re thinking, thinking I do not belong
Tell me Diggy ain’t beamin’, 'course I should be on this song
Yeah, I’m a child of God, my reflection is on
Yeah, I’m only 15'n, but my sixteens is strong
Didn’t want me to shine, now we sharing the stage
Twice as good as you rhyme, only half of your age
So the question remains, and it ain’t even how
Got that Verizon flow, are you hearing me now?
Word to Wasalu, they was saying my future was dark
I had the fame, but my name was missing the art
So I’m drawing the line, and I’m crossing my Ts
And I’m dotting my Is, barely catching my Zs
But I’ll be good by the morning, on my global grind like JoJo
They be looking at what I’m putting on and
So fly, so fresh at the Soho
Most niggas don’t know though
They can catch me on the first flight
Been working on a new mixtape, I got a call from Lupe
But I did it for the love, no check, mate

[Verse 8: Dosage]
When people said I couldn’t, I wouldn’t, I made them believers
I come from the school of hard knocks and overachievers
From the City of Brotherly Love, they saying we need you
To be the voice of the people and go against all this evil
Some of them hate it, but I made it, so I’m never concerned
About what they be talking about, I’ve lived and I’ve learned
With my dream and my drive, I determined my turn
In this business, because I’m in control, meeting adjourned
I said, “It’s Third Degree, y’all heard of we?
I’m Dosage, have you heard of me?”
I come from the bottom, so the top where I deserve to be
Where people say, ""It doesn’t matter to me much""
I was on the Steppin' Lasers tour, and man, I shook it up
That was random, but so what? Life is a war, better load up
If you against me, come correct
I am the bomb, watch me blow up (Boom!)
Right before your eyes, forget about the dividends
I just want to say I remember when

[Verse 9: B.o.B]
Well, it’s B to the O, O to the B
You know it’s the flow, you know that it’s me, I flow to this beat
As easy as going to the store and holding receipts
And folding them neat, I’m focused as focused can be
You know I got phobias, please, approach me with peace
Or things could get heated and you’ll get ferociously beat
Speaking of ""ferociously beat,"" you know that girl ‘Nique?
You know she’s a freak
But anyway, back to what I’m supposed to be
Saying all over this beat, you know that we Gs
You see all the crowns, you know that we kings
You notice the rings
Everywhere we go, we roll with the team, yeah
And you know that we lasers, so you know that we beam
It’s the All-City varsity, hard-headed squad
We playing y’all spades, y’all handle y’all cards
But we ain’t all odds, we just blaze, man
Y’all playing checkers in this game, this is chess, y’all pawns"
How Come,D12,['hip hop'],"[Intro: Eminem]
So I changed, huh?
You got a phone
Pick it up, call me

[Chorus: Eminem]
How come we don't even talk no more?
And you don't even call no more?
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine, we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family, ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
We were so young, so full of life and vibrance
Side by side, wherever you was riding, I went
So close, almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shit
When Ronnie died, you was right by my side
With a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes
And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it
You even had the same type of childhood I did
Sometimes I just wanna know why is it
That you succame to yours and mine, I survived it
You ran the streets, I nine-to-fived it
We grew up, grew apart as time went by us
Then I blew up, to both yours and mines surprises
Now I feel a vibe, I just can't describe it
Much as your pride tries to hide it
You're cold, your touch is just like ice
And your eyes is a look of resentment
I can sense it and I don't like it
[Chorus: Eminem]
How come we don't even talk no more?
And you don't even call no more?
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine, we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family, ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you

[Verse 2: Kon Artis]
It was my dream at first to be off spitting a verse
On my own album with a deal, but shit got worse
'Fore I came out, I woulda killed a nigga first
'Fore I let him disrespect me, or check me over some worrisome
Bitch that I wasn't with, I woulda hit it and quit
But you were planning to talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you don't get involved with her
You would smoke in the car with her
Coming out of the bar with her, stumbling, half-drunk
Like y'all was husband and wife or something
But me catching her fuckin' other niggas
Must've hurt your pride or something
'Cause you woof off at the mouth to people
Like you want it with me
When all I tried to do was show you that your bitch was shifty
And ever since the fans and all the shit that I produced
You acting like I ain't your mans and lying like she can't be loose
But I am really your friend, I'm just trying to tell you the truth
Don't hate the game or the player, the one that's changing is you
[Chorus: Eminem]
How come we don't even talk no more?
And you don't even call no more?
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine, we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family, ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you

[Verse 3: Proof & Eminem]
It gets lonely at the top 'cause my homie had to stop
Now we acting like I gotta live only for the block
And homies in the hood only see me on the tube
So they gossip on the porch, get to speaking all rude
Fools I used to rap with all expect magic
Like my finger get to snapping and poof, it just happen
But Proof is just acting out the part he was thrown
Shady made it so my babies ain't starving at home
See the devil in your glance, since the ghetto, we been friends
Forever real intelligence, that's forever till the end
I peep the hatreds in your eyes and the Satan in your lies
Ain't wasting my time with these snakes in disguise
How come when you talk, it's with bitter and spite?
And how come it was my fault for what you did with your life?
And every time I go to hear you and play, you look away
We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face
[Chorus: Eminem]
How come we don't even talk no more?
And you don't even call no more?
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine, we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family, ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you"
Jedi Mind Tricks,Lupe Fiasco,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse]
They tryin' to censor the influencer
Just makes me sicker, influenza, yeah
I'll abide by the censorship
Soon as they ride I'll get back on my nigga shit
Can't reverse
The boy-game Advanced, complete the genesis
I've broke bread with societies menaces
I've dedicated sentences to the dead, and said hold your heads to my niggas doin’ sentences
I send condolences to the victims but, threats to the witnesses
On my path I was facing a paragraph, myself
So they sentiments is felt
When you hate your own and discriminate of self
In a cell gotta make your home, coz you might never make it home
Suicide on your side might commit it with your belt
Keep your pants on homie
Streets are damn so lonely, like only
A bunch of niggas won’t help, nah
That’s the enemy of stealth
Plus if they get caught how you gonna keep your heart fatigue
The hustler’s diet is the enemy of health, give you heart disease
Arteries hard but its hard to leave the bread alone
Aren’t we hard headed, headed for harm, but don’t fret it homes
From the twist tied to the butt
We be rippin’ it up
From the horror to the cure, don’t force the issue
To you my niggas in the war, may the force be with you"

I done been around the world, been around the block
Been around hoes that fucked Biggie and 'Pac
Like Vida Guerra, ass took her to the top
She'll give you some brain, you let her throw up the Roc
Let her put on your chain, she'll throw you some cot
Picture that, like Meagan Good and Jamie Foxx
Hype said it's a wrap, she still on the set
Puttin' oil on her legs like she Gloria Velez
She was Eye Candy in the XXL
Hopped off the page and on a skateboard with Pharrell
I knew she (Wouldn't get far) 'cause five hundred dollars
Can't get you that (Far), how you get that (Far)
And all these new video bitches tryin' to be Melyssa Ford
But they don't know Melyssa Ford drive a Honda Accord
She a video vixen, but behind closed doors
She do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards, ha ha

Game, you mad nuts, how you gon' call out all these
Bitches knowin' damn well they gon' call me?
The only dream, of that ghetto prom queen
Was to make it to the screen, maybe get seen
Maybe get chose by a nigga from my team
Head so good he don't ask for a pre... nup
Now ask yourself this question, umm
Would you be with Jay-Z if he wasn't C-E-O?
Would you be with F-A-B-O if he drove a Neo?
Would you ride with Ne-Yo, if he was in a Geo?
Well why the hell you think these bitches comin' at me fo'?

I done had my share of bitches with long hair
Short 'do like Kelis or Halle in Boomerang, yeah
I been around the block in the Bentley drop-top
In Miami Beach when Lil' Kim was fuckin with Scott
I got the scoop on Hoops, whatever the case
She'll let you spray in her face long as she Bathing Apes
And ain't nobody tryin' to take Beyoncé from Jay
But I know a bitch named Superhead he fucked back in the day
The things niggas do when pussy sittin' on they face
Stabbed Un in the stomach
She must have had a pussy like Wonder Woman
On that superhero shit
Fly as Gabrielle Union in the back of my six, fo'

That's why I fuck 'em today and forget 'em tomorrow
[Chorus: The Game]
(You wouldn't get far), fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, put your hands up ladies
(You wouldn't get far), if you kept your legs closed
(It would be just a waste of time)
But you know, (You wouldn't get far), fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, I wrote this song for you
For you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all

[Outro: The Game]
God damn, you know what I'm sayin'
I'm sittin' back watchin' Kanye video
And I see the same bitch
That was in the homeboy Busta Rhymes video
Then I flip the muh'fuckin channel
Checkin' out my uncle Snoop Dogg video
And I see the same bitch, that was in MY video
You know what I'm sayin'
And then y'knahmsayin, to make that even mo' fucked up
I'm watchin' Oprah cover Hurricane Katrina
I see the same bitch on Oprah
Floatin away on the hood of a Camry
That was in the nigga Lil Weezy video
I mean damn, everywhere I look
Everywhere I go, I see the same hoes
Don't get mad, I'm only bein' real, yeah"
General Patton,Big Boi,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Get the South dick up out your mouth, what are you talmbout?
See we know everything that you're about, so try another route
Paperboy, you can't destroy what we done built
Pick on somebody your own size and fuck around, get killed
But not like the kilt above the knees, BB
Will plant you niggas like seeds, or fertilizer for the trees
Emergency vehicle last seen speeding from the scene
Nigga take one for the team, now he's bleeding from the spleen
Stay so fresh and oh so motherfucking clean
No blood spatter or evidence, long distance with a beam
We come in peace while some of ya'll niggas come in greed
Gluttons fucking up the game like ice, heroin, or speed
Slow down, nigga

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Speed it up like The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, boy go fast
Not a hobby, this my life, you disrespect it, that's your ass
As one half of the OutKast return like Ghost of Christmas Past
It's the son of Chico Dusty, must be West Savannah bad, ayy!
Had to go to church every Sunday with Great-Grandma and Granddad
Taught me always follow Jesus when the grass didn't have a path
If I ever fell astray, then God will get me back on track
Didn't say that Rico, Ray and Pat was getting with me and Three Stacks
Then we spitting 'cause we killing everything that we attack
Special Forces of the rap game, so you best take heed of that
All that shit you rappers lack, we got plenty, here's a snack
Don't ruin their appetite, because your shit is really wack
Wack-ass nigga
[Outro: Big Rube]
Another battle won, another story to tell
Listen to the angelic plucking of the puppet strings
As Sir Lucious puts his left foot forward
And rides off into the horizon of infinite regression, victorious
Undefeated on the battle field
Against the means of ignorance, greed, and hatred
All contenders to the throne are left naked
Because the truth is the only thing you can never be stripped of
And if you want to commit to that truth
Then you could end the vicious cycle that's affecting our youth today
If you just stop lying, if you just stop lying
Stop lying... lying

[Skit]
Hey, Josh, you ever– you know about the David Blaine?
You know the magician David Blaine, right?
The David Blaine is when you're fucking a girl from the back, or somebody from the back, right, and goddamn
You let your friend slide in without her even knowing, right
Then you goddamn run around and bang on the window and you wave at her ass
It's called the David Blaine"

I just want to tape you undressing
And I'll lay you down and record soft porn
If it's romance then it's hardcore
If it's horror, pop the popcorn
The thoughts to rape you really turns me on

[Chorus]
Press my buttons baby
Just to press buttons
Press my buttons baby
Yeah
Press my buttons baby
Press my fucking buttons baby
Press my buttons baby

You're my favorite show, any chance I get I try to watch
Die-hard fans can't stop with the tapings
Sort of like a psycho when I can't stop with the rapings
Of the VHS, especially during sex, baby

But put it in slow-mo, I don't want to bust the tape yet, press play
Now this is what I call an evening
A live show, almost equivalent to the screening
Your dream movie? I'm the clearest copy
Now time for Blow, I'm Johnny deep with the rarest poppy
Snort a little, now you're getting groovy
'Cause I'll kill you if I find out you're watching some other movies, bitch

I buy yellow stones cuz I like the way she got that yellow on

So I'm a raptor, tearin' it up like a tractor
Matter of fact, I'm killin' this track, you're a slacker
Sack like a sacker
Hello Mr. Brady
Tell em' leave his hair for the guy who sings ""Baby""
Baby, someone try to save me, lately
I've been hearing these things that sound crazy
Like....da- da- da

Speaking in tongues....alright
OK, stop, drop and roll Justin Bieber is on fire
It's time to realize it's time to call me young sire
You're the seller, I'm the buyer
You're the teller, and I'm higher
I'm higher than the highest point and, yes, I'm flyer
And I'm wired to the game
Stay dry when it rains
I'm tired of the fame, are you proud of the pain?
Yes, we're the same, yes I'm insane
And my mane hangs down, I'm a puppet got strings

Joey what you said, 24 right
Aight cool, I got you
I define gutter - every time I rhyme
I climb up another notch, hip-hop got my spine smothered
But I'll be fine brother - my mind hovers
Above all you jive suckers wishing, that's word to my mother
You throw a shot at me, I'm throwing a shot back
Yours is on a joint, mine's whistling by your top hat
Yeah, I'm cool but you violate and I'll cock back
Open the mac's mouth and black out like I do not rap
I'm sick and tired of niggas lying
They fifth is lying in the second drawer next door to some bullshit they iron
Y'all be making up stories the little kids is buyin'
I do everything my Penn State like a Nittany Lion
I ain't gotta mention the streets on a song
To get in a nigga ass on these beats like a thong - pause
Veterans co-sign me, the up-and-comers scared
The pretty girls go, ""papi, here's my underwear""
Never in a hundred years I thought I'd be a rapper
But in less than a hundred bars I knew I'd be a factor
I'm PS4 in HD and the screen is plasma
You're Atari 2600 with a weak adapter
Between us the gap's so crazy
I'm Gucci, Louis V; you're Gap, Old Navy
I get coochie in the V, you attract no ladies
You're suburb, I'm gutter where the gats go crazy
[Verse 2: Nino Bless]
Fuck a lecture, ain't tryna be Pun's successor
That term's done fucker, what up whatever
You birds is food, I'm about to pluck some feathers
I'm young and clever, plus clutch under pressure, yup
Who does this better
Walk around with metal all on me like the front of Shredder
I lust for cheddar you owe me
Leave holes in your vest that'll open your chest like a sunken treasure
I'm somethin' like a phenomenon
Dropping bombs for fun then dine in Hell during Ramadan
Whatever I'm rhyming on or whoever
I tear 'em apart; swear on my pops
No fear in my heart, shit been through it all
Done swam with the sharks, snapped fins with my jaws
I'm all that and a bag of the baddest piff
Off of a brick of hash mixed with acid hits like sick cracker shit
Get back, dumb birds I ignore the hype
Click-clack, Yung Berged if you flossing ice
Dawg, cross me twice, can't afford the price
It'll cost you, I'll off your life
You soft, I told you I'm raw white when I'm on this mic
Still mourn at night, don't wanna see mornin' light
And I feel like I'm forced to fight
When the CHiPs are down like Ponch fallin' off his bike
Of course my metaphors are type awesome, right
I got 'em in awe, my aura's Jordan like
What's really poppin', who diddy-boppin
You wasn't really, now you all Common and really conscious
I ain't with that silly nonsense, I really pop shit
My gun stay cocked like Biggie's optics
I stay evolving but grown bitter
On your grave they're carvin' ""Fucked with the wrong nigga""
[Verse 3: Crooked I]
I don't write I kill a pen, leak its blood on the page
I breathe bars like oxygen locked my lungs in a cage
Instrumentals get fucked on the stage
A pedophile unless I dig in the crates and fuck with somethin' my age
Forever vow, to never smile when I'm at peace
Only when I'm eating the deceased like quiche
Only when my enemy's internal organs are a smorgasbord in a feast
The Dahmer with melanin led 'em in the belly of the beast
You'll be missin' until fishermen see your corpse
I'll be in Michigan sticking a chicken in my Michelin
Ready to pigeon pitch again from Switzerland to New York
I was whipping Bentleys before them pictures up in The Source
I'm a gorilla behind these bars, on some zoo shit
Shoot you while you're talking on some news camera crew shit
Sicker than flyin' in past tense on some flu shit
Day-old asshole flow, I drop new shit
Exclusive, you don't want it in fact
I'll have the doctors operating on the front of your back
Tryna keep your stomach intact
The spiritual you, leavin' your body, he don't wanna go back
That's when the tunnel go black
I send your soul to the atmosphere
Fuck outta here and your ringtone rap career
It's Crooked I: the face of Eastside Long Beach
Put your ear to the street so you can hear my heartbeat

Nickel, yeah
I hope niggas know I'll show up to your show
I'll show up where you go, show up to your do', foes will explode
Shells 'fore they hit the floor, I know niggas know
I got a open window flow, I air shit out
In the D they used to call me Mayor Royce
Now they call me Clay Davis
Guess why, ""sheeeeeeeeeeee-it""
'Cause when it come to them words you know I wear shit out
I write rhymes like, white lines on a nose tray
Ice cold Ice Cube flow like O'Shea
Ridin' shotgun with Chris Martin - my DJ
Not the White boy, but I'm down for the Coldplay
Forever stay violent, better stay silent
Hammers stay humming like strumming the mandolin violin
Speaking of, I done played a tune of violence
More than my nigga Charles Hamilton played Sonic
I wrap niggas up, clap niggas up, scrap niggas up
Either that or we gon' slap niggas up
Dump dirt on you right before I go
Into my Maino mode if I smell the scent of Yung Berg on ya
Til it ain't no mo', ain't no dough
Get into his ass cause I ain't opposed, I'm a livin' anal probe
I'm a lame-ophobe, matter fact my nigga JumpOff
Can I keep goin' (why the fuck not)
When I was a teen, I used to pack a three-eighty
Now I'm spittin sittin' between Shady and Jay
I pull the jeans down on my bitch and then wave
Cause the pussy Max B wavy when she ain't shave
I leave the booth smellin' like somebody ain't sprayed
I would talk about Kimbo but I ain't crazy
I'm like Marty McFly goin' back in time
And dissin' his momma nigga you can't fade me

[Verse 5: Joe Budden]
They say he a bastard for real, then they see the ass on his girl
So they wonderin' why's he so mad at the world
I take it out on tracks, I R.I.P. it
So even to the producer it's hard to I.D. it
Bars tremendous, it's in your best interest
I insist your men just do your best Bush rendish
Endless, move more than two inches
My blood'll boil like I got a big skin cyst
So end this or see me mañana
Or see the speed of a llama, underground prima donna
That ain't hard to find, pop a E in a Honda
With hands like E. Honda, he a monster
I love war, it's like my pet peeve kinda
But for us to even beef you should be honored
My dick gettin' hard, I see vagina - pause
Nah, rewind each line each time
Speak mine and meet nine, mano-a-mano
When it rains it pours, grab a teflon poncho
You now fuckin' with Mouse, the head honcho
Nigga I could fit your house in my condo
I walk around like ratchets been legalized
Just me and the Desert Eagle, and an eagle eye
Closed casket, now you having a boxed wake
Zipper over your head, dude's callin' you Crotchface
So y'all could bump ""Swag Like Us""
But the next time rap's discussed add this as a plus
Don't nobody hit the pad like us
And would get up in that ass but the fag's might bust
And since poppin' tags is a must (what?)
I hit the bank all I do is withdraw
Chicks removin' their drawers now, your crew is in awe
How you ball, your jewels from a cubicle in the mall
You gon' need another processor to process it
I'll set it, I said it
So keep running around hot-headed 'til you get hot leaded
'Til everything but your torso on you is prosthetic
Digest it, niggas is pie-thetic
Rap what you can't afford, y'all must got credit

Feetless, wearing a Santa Claus suit

But still can't deny me.. get it?

Got so many bodies on me they call me:

Yeah
Uh-huh

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, hardly home but always reppin'
You hardly on and always second
When I'm awake, you always restin'
And when they call you the answer, you are hardly questioned
I, I'm doin' classic shit in all my sessions
Other niggas' situations, they are all depressin'
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions
I just always did my own thing
Now I run the game, you stupid motha-suckas
I see all this money through my Ohio State Buckeyes
Shit been goin' good, but good can turn to better
'Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her

[Chorus: Drake]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on

I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on
[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, wrong way down a one-way
Women don't get saved 'round me, even on a Sunday
Damn, where I get it from? These niggas always wonder who
Then they meet my pop and tell him, ""Drake is just a younger you""
And shawty wanna party, so don't let yo' girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ of me givin' her mouth-to-mouth
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her
I drive two black cars, I named 'em Malcolm X and Martin Luther
I don't ever play, but I'm in the game lady
They just lose to love, those are tennis games, lady
Have you countin' money, goin' duffle bag crazy
Sippin' on Pink Floyd and puffin' Wayne Brady
Damn, whose line is it anyways?
I'm in a daze, you been amazed
Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage
I'm on fire, yup, I've been ablaze
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right, you look nice
And yo' frame makes me wanna bowl a strike, well alright
Guess I might, know what? Fuck it, yes I will
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin' less than real
Put it to your life

Bun B, king of the trill, also one of the dopest
Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused
The gangsta recognize me for my loc-ness, no joke, it's
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a locust
Or maybe like a python, that's the type of shit I'm on
I wrote this on my iPhone, so let me drop this iBomb
I palm the game like it's a Spalding ball and take flight
From the free-throw line and slam it down like I'm the great Mike
Bun and Wayne and Drake in here, mane, this gon be a great night
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white
Try to cross me over I just fake left, then I break right
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night
This that major moment you've been waitin' on for too long
The best that ever did it and doin' it on a new song
UGK and Young Money, too strong
Bound to be in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?

I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on

I am the leather jacket, black glasses, All-American bad boy
I own the swagger supermarket and you, you just a bag boy
'Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you never had boy
Hate and I will leave your chest the color of my flag, boy
Soowoo, bitch, I do this shit, I'll erase you like I drew you, bitch
And I keep that toaster, you can come and be my strudel, bitch
I'm so uptown
And motherfucker if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah
And now I'm on that rock shit
But why they let me in? I'm just gon' shoot 'em in the mosh pit
Haha, fuck is you talkin' 'bout?

Hehe
I'ma take this one for the team
G.O.O.D. Music!
Yeah, ugh

You know what? I figured out I'm not a nice guy
I shook hands, kissed babies, gave it a nice try
You know what? I hate pictures of other people kids
I hate plastic couches in other people cribs
I hate when other people cribs smell like shit
I hate when I leave and smell like the crib
What's the cause of the poor smell?
She said, ""I just cleaned up"", baby, I can't tell
Why every ghetto bitch gotta smell like Love Spell
Or that God damn cucumber Bath and Body Works?
I can still smell the sweat, the shit hardly works
What about Cool Water? That shit probably worse
This here a classic like the La-Di-Da-Di verse
And my man probably hollered at the hottie first
I scored, he took the charge
Oooh, that shit gotta hurt

And my bitch got on tights with a tack ass
I'm a fly nigga, and I carry on
With them bottles of that Rosé and Perignon
Ever seen how a kingpin carries on?
Dookie rope link chain and a herringbone

First class flights, baby, that's a field trip
Double date, don't cooperate, kill switch

Tryin' to get her back to the nest so I could sting her
So I hit Big Sean on the ringer
I said, ""I got a chick for you that look like a singer
On a scale of one to ten, she's a fifteen-er""
Man, you shoulda seen a nigga face when he seen her
He said the bitch wasn't pretty enough to finger
On my team, she would be a fifth-stringer

Bucharest,Jupiter (Band),"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","Verse 1:
I’m from that place you never heard of till I rapped about it
Where we terrorist threat the muslims we keep their whole heads wrapped about it
Don’t get off the plane with the ice glissing, there’s always guys’ listening
To what hotel you listed in, then you’ll find your wife missing
No racism here, you get blackmailed even if you caucasian
So get the doe to the location, these dudes is on probation
They don’t know what mercy means, they some thirsty fiends
Who noticed that your wallet’s bursting cheese when buying groceries
And if you want this to get solved don’t involve the Police!
They’ll wanna know what the ransom is, then raise it 20 G’s
Please! You’d better pay the price the kidnappers say
Otherwise you’d better pray that these wiseguys won’t slice their prey
It’s not nice to say, they’ll flood her in blood like MK Deception
You’ll get your spouse’s skin samples at the hotel’s reception
They see it as the natural selection, as the gradual ascension
From having nothing to owning your actual possessions
So don’t get off the plane showing off your true value
Cause if you worth that much we might sell you, It’s the truth, I tell you
Fuck Bram Stoker, Transylvania, Dracula mania
Though we might blood drain ya, I rep Bucharest Romania
Accurately aiming ya, I never miss, like a nerd through high school
Don’t stare, you might loose your eyes, fool! I’m ice cool
Me and my peeps we play for keeps, but sometimes we loose it
SS behind these bars, my private jail is music…
Chorus:

I’m from where your shadow is afraid to come out at night
B U C H A R E S T
I’m from where the po-po’s getting paid to stay out of sight
B U C H A R E S T
I’m from the dark side of the globe you on the wrong side of the scope
B U C H A R E S T
Where you can take my name in vein, yap, my shit’s that dope
B U C H A R E S T

Verse 2:

I’m from around here, born and raised, between ciment and concrete blocks
Where the balanced mindstate is overwhelmed by greed, it sucks!
And when they wanna meet us, tell’em not to worry, they’ll know it’s us
Witness the touch of Midas, gold tracks and for the gold we bust!
Diamond necklace?Iturn reckless, assault the rapper
He got a kilo i’ll take that and push it – salt’n'pepa
J pops nine shots then he drops it cause it’s hot
That’s some good shit, some might be chocking on it like it’s pot
Skilltester’s tight with the rock, something like Dino Radja
IfIrocked green contacts you’d think Erick Sermon robbed ya
.38 snubbed ya, my man got the cam to capture such a rapture
It’ll take weeks for the doctors to patch ya
Face bone fracture they need dental records to find ya
They fucked up the medication, it’s like they wanna blind ya
They said you gonna be ok, just that you’ll need a dog to guide ya
No more guns, no more gangsta, no more ganja
Later I be sending a mean bitch like Poison Ivy
Who’s muscles won’t twitch while she injects poison in your I.V
Visiting Bucharest this time of the century – bad timing
You’ll get put to rest if you lecture me, now you flatlining
Back home, they’ll be expecting your coffin to be flown in
Just because you wanted to act childish in front of grown men
Me and peeps we play for keeps but sometimes we loose it
SS behind these bars my private jail is music…"

I moves mountains, there's nothing you can sell me
I tear the world down just to build it back again

Nah, I'm Eric Wright, [nigga] with a attitude
Then I hit her with some 'Pac -- ""I ain't mad at you""
Y'all stay shook, I'm straight crook
I made appointment for head, that face book
And I stay in drama, but anything with honor
I hit your BBM -- your broke baby momma
And I won't stop, I'm on my Diddy [shit]

We take trips with bricks -- hey, you down, ho?
Don't question me, play enough clown, yo
I get the whistle cause you're way out of bounds, mo
We fly high, fly guys, aideo!
Y'all burgers like Five Guys, adios

Young girls say I'm fly, cute -- I reply mute
F5 coupe I pull up to my stoop
Kissing in public? That's preposterous
Superman? Nah, but the crip is Metropolis
My day? It consists of driving bricks
Picking money up, getting head, copping kicks
Then the studio -- I don't even stop and piss
""Go shopping now, Cam?"" -- c'mon, stop it, miss

Bullets hit faces after words exchanged

I'ma go eat me some pussy, and choke off the cherry—I'm gone

Look, kill the game, no one recovers the murder weapon
Young Angel, if you hate me tell me burn in heaven (Brrrrat!)
How'd ya sleep on me? The highest earnin freshmen
Like your third infection, I hope you learned your lesson (Yeah)
Yeah, I spit raw, but I prefer protection
I own a heart and a mind and a shirt she slept in
Bitch, I got the answer, and still ain't heard the question
I shut your club down, please reserve my section
Fuck a confrontation, there ain't no cake in it
And I'm caking, bitch, so tell me why I'd take a break from it
The mother of your child always tell you I'm her favorite
She call me her baby—not the one she was in labor with
She say, ""Ooh, you taste good,"" I say, ""Ooh, just savor it""
She know that she love a nigga, I be on that major shit
'Cause I get paid to stand, and I get paid to sit
So I don't walk around with money, baby girl—I'm made of it"

Mysterious mind is why people can't figure me
Ow ouch oops!
This lil' pistol keeps sticking me
In the side and I
Really got tired of beef quickly
So why they keep picking me
Out to be the bad guy
But it really don't matter nowadays
Don't even ask why
You're Jamie Foxx I'm Tom Cruise and in this cab ride
Elimnatin' every perpe-hater that I pass by
'cept the only difference is all who go against Cham die
A slow rap death and the album is comin' stand by
Jason Chucky Freddy couldn't kill it its hard so eh! try
And then if I'm not the king of the mixtapes then you is a Cham lie

Take a look into the sky you can see its goin down tonight
(its goin' down tonight)
Just take one look by ya side you can really see who's down to ride
(you see who's down to ride)
Take a look into the sky you can see its goin down tonight
(its goin' down tonight)
If you scared then go inside
(if you scared then go inside)
If you scared then go inside and take cover cause its time to hide
I know you thought that I
Was gonna fall out the game
But you gotta give props to me cause I did what the hatas kept sayin' I can't
And I'm all about money
Could live without the fame
But now the ladies getting HOT for me and everytime they see me they keep
Sayin' that name (Chamillitary Mayne)
Rewind it rewind it
Forget mine mayne just keep minding your business cause you lying
You blind and simple minded
And my timing was perfect timing
I'm grinding and I'm shining like my diamonds was perfect diamonds
Went my whole underground career without recycling mine
And my past will never be the future not recycling time
I got patnas that'll go gorilla but not the type on them vines
They repeated offenders that like to recycle they crimes
This is more than a horror flick
Go get ya boy to record it quick
Can't ignore that ya boy can spit
My weapon on and its gonna CLICK!
Clack
POW!
Who wanna hate on Chamilli now
Got revenge if you ask me how
Made it out the dirt ya'll throw it now
The king is back
Ain't a rapper that's high as them
Higher than air or as fly as Cham
I guess I'll be the pilot then
Move out the way cause I'm flyin' in
Let me talk to the streets baby how you been
Grind to the end gotta grind to win
Tryin' to stop that eh! try again
I'll dig a hata up make him die again
And you know that

[spoken word]
You think the mixtape king worried cause he ain't been on the screen
When I'm pulling up in foreign vehicles the maker of the foreign vehicle
Himself hasn't seen
I'm the rapper that don't know the meaning of fear
That'll whisper that get up in ya ear like cheaaaaaaaaa
Mixtape messiah 4 I'm back to get my cash
I just got 100 Gs for a show in Finland
You do the math
And my team getting money too no need to wonder folks
The kid stay with a fresh pair of Stevie Wonder locs
Discussing if I'm selling or if I'm street or who got better beats
Man stop drooling over my plate while I take this fork and I eat
Man I'm way oVerseas internationally getting pounds euros and rupees
And you back home crying like you one of my groupies
I don't really know what you critics want from me
For me to gracefully bow out and hand you the keys to my company
Don't argue with a hata about whether I'm dope let em think what they think
We gon' snatch the game out from under these lames as soon as they blink
Boys must've got me confused because of a commercial single
Try to act like you ain't see me come for revenge
Ha ha I seen you
So as we get on to the proceedings this evening
Realized that revenge is something I've already achieved man
The highly anticipated mixtape messiah whew!
I ain't gonna tell you how much it sell but if I do
Whatever I say is true
So you gon kick it with me for a few and we gon let it do what it do

I'm ready to get it started
You better tell 'em I'm the hardest
You hate on me then you retarded
I'mma get mine regardless
Uh, I'm seeing, the rap game's needing
Me to come back to the mixtapes and relieve them
Uh, fans geeking, and rap sales speaking
Saying they in need of someone to believe in
Uh, I'm seeing, that they ain't me
I'll wreck a Polow beat for no apparent reason
And I think it's hunting season
So I'm cocking back and squeezing

Look at the fans, talking bout who spit better lines
I don't know what you're doing but prepare for mines
I don't just spit a line better than Kevin Federline
You better tell 'em I'm really better than whoever rhyme
Hold up, let me get out this chair
Hear you talking bout your hustles, ain't no profit there
Hear you talking bout your deal, that ain't profit square
Y'all get lil' royalties, I get profit share
What up 50? What up Buck? What up Lupe? What up Game?
What up Jeezy? What up Luda? What up T.I.? What up Wayne?
And just cause I say a name, it doesn't mean I'm insane
Cause I'm shoutin out all the artists that make me step up my game
If I say I'm better than 50, his fans is gon' complain
I say I'm better than Wayne, his fans will do the same
I don't wanna ruffle feathers so maybe I should explain
Maybe it's M.O.E., me over everythang
I'm better than you know who, so better that it's a shame
Better than Lil' Mama, I'm better than Lil' Zane
Better than Lil' Blang, imbedded in your brain
I'm better than every rapper that rap with a little name
You should be pissed that I'm pissed
I know some of my past records was a hit or a miss
Don't try to twist up my ish and twist it into a diss
If you gon' twist up what I said then you should twist it to this
Lauren London can get kissed on the lips
And Bill O'Reilly and Don Imus can get hit with a fist
Hakeem, I'm ""The Dream"", stop missing the swish
And MTV, my name is what you missed on the list
Wait, let me rewind, I really don't want them
To think I'm tryna diss and I just really want them
To know I'm not the type to take Lauren to London
Matter of fact, Lauren be lucky if I take her to lunch man
It's the king of the hill from the land of the trill
What up Elise, can't you see I'm moving in for the kill?
Either I can drop one song a year like Skillz
Or we can get off in these streets, it's time to pay these bills
Gas prices getting high and I'm knowing I got a fleet
I'm skinnier than a mother and knowing I gotta eat
So any rapper out there that's knowing he got a beat
Better never ever allow the instrumental to leak
Studio every day and I'm letting 'em loose
Black and Decker in the trunk, it ain't nothing but tools
When I run a money marathon, it ain't nothing to prove
My closet looking like a stadium, it's nothing but shoes
Jae Millz, ain't forgot about the cover you gave me
Appreciate it G, I'm still one of the crazy
Rebels out of the Texas and I'm runnin 'em daily
Now I'm back off in the streets like F you, pay me
For jackin the Texas swagger, Famous, hand me the dagger
Nah, never mind cause these fakers don't even matter
Mixtape Messiah 4, August 27th
And this just a throw away
I got a draw full of 'em, let's go

Yeah, they offended by words but you can tell it's fear
They say ball till you fall, a fall is never near
They all saying that they ball, who you telling dear?
I manage a whole lot of money like I'm Kenneth Crear
Manage a whole lot of money like I'm Shaka Zulu
You think that I ain't good at rhyming? You out your noodle
Safe sex man, your label tryna prostitute you
I'm on the grind, up earlier than a cock-a-doodle
What up Killer Mike? It's Grind Time man
Rap game in my aim, I'm like 'bang, bang, bang'
Only rappers getting mad, the ones who can't maintain
Now the rappers getting back to the mixtapes man
First they tried to hate when I left, said I'm history
Came back, they telling me that they missed me
Twenty G's for this watch? Are you sick G?
A dot-com on my arm, ThisIs50
Haters talking, acting like they some motor mouths
And I'mma automatic start and turn your motor off
The crib big, MTV can't even show the house
Cause it would take thirty minutes for them to show the couch
F sales, (what you mean?) Bank account is great
Wreckin it since nine-eight and never took a break
Until recently, throwing my rob back in the lake
Rap game tried to give me Kibbles till I took the steak
Stop barking baby, I'm not starving
Getting bucks, you crazy? I'm mill-walkin
Your conscious is talking about caution
Slit your wrists, slit, I'm sharper than Al Sharpton

Ay, it's two hundred women in the V.I.P
And all of the rumours will be bout me
If they talking bout me and my D-I-C
Then tell 'em I'm the king like T.I.P
When you worth as many millions as me
They gon' try to get close to you
Cause I put it down like I'm sposed to do
And your chick is on my promotion crew
Gossiping about what I did
Gossiping about where I live
Aight I'm joking bout where I live
Cause she will never know where that is
Girl that thing is awesome mayne
The grade that I give you is off the chain
I would love to take you to the Rikers' game
But I'd rather get some bread
Now you acting like you my dame
Magical when I do my thang
When I tell her she need to disappear
She gon' turn into a boomerang
Knock, knock, who's there?
""I'm back"" Who cares?

Paper chasing if it's any left
And I'm on the trail till I make the catch
I be so close on that big face
That eew, I can smell Ben Franklin's breath
Y'all can try to test my success
If I ain't the best then come place ya bets
I can't see ya girl saying I ain't my sex
Because I ain't a trick, I know it ain't my cheques
The secret service bump into me
I swear y'all gon' have to be mad at me
Every dollar bill's a fatality
And every President will be casualties
An assassination it had to be
My hustle game is like Master P's
Every verse I spit is of masterpiece
Like that painting that's on my mantle piece
And my crib is worse than gigantic G's
I got corporations and entities
And my wrist is cooler than antifreeze
Cause my money stretching like Hammer P
A-N-T, what's the word?
Tell the haters I'm tugging birds
But not the drugs, that buzzing bird
I keep an eagle, I'm never scared
Word, gotta stay close to the money
Look at all the money that we making for Johnny
Don't make me a deal, that would make me a dummy
Had a bright idea, now my bracelet is sunny
I never ever tell a yellow stellar to get her groove back
I'm pulling that ella-ella-unbrella, tell her groove that
New Barack O-baller, vote for me and I'll improve rap
So in another class, Uncle Sam should charge me school tax
Used to purchase Jordans, found out Michael was a rude cat
Paid this chick to burn 'em and she only charged me two stacks
No response to those that turn on me like I don't do dat
The rumours that I'm hearing just opinions but a few facts

And uh, throw up that finger!
Hey yo, throw y'all fingers up!
Thug style, baby, thug style, y'know?

Tell me, baby are you lonely? Don't wanna rush ya
I can help ya if you're only, let me touch ya
If I'm wrong, love, tell me 'cause I get caught up
In the life I live, it's Hell see, I never thought I'd
See the day when I would calm down, you ain't heard?
I've been known to clown and get around, that's my word
See you walking and you looking good, yes indeed
Got a body like a sex fiend, you're killing me
With your attitude to match, right? Don't be phony
'Cause I hate it when you act like, you don't know me
I've been stressing in the spotlight, I want the fame
But the industry's a lot like, a crap game
Ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go
Can't be with you every minute miss, another show
And even though I'm known for my one night stand (Look here)
I wanna be an honest man, but temptations go...

Getting weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go
In my ride and I'm all in, gettin' high

Everybody knows I'm balling and to God
Gotta keep myself from falling, but it's hard
All the cuties know I'm under pressure, what do I do?
Getting shaky when she pull the dress up, and say it's cool
Should I stroke or should I wait a while? You decide
If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie
Move close and let me whisper some dirty words
In your ears as I kiss ya on every curve
Slow down baby, don't rush, I like it slow
Can't hold it any longer, so let it go
Open the gates to your waterfall up in Heaven
And don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was..

'Cause even thugs get lonely, understand
Even the hardest of my homies need attention
Catch you blowin' up the telephone, reminiscin'
I wanna take you to the movies and the park
Let's find a spot for you to do me in the dark
Now that it's passion, hold me tight
Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight
I know your man ain't lovin' you right
You're lonely and depressed, you need a thug in your life
Enough talkin', you want me to leave I'll get to walkin'
See you later, 'cause baby, I'm a player, and all I heard was—

Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go loco
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my toes
Oh no-o-o-o-o

[Chorus]
Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothing to do nowhere to go-o-oh
I wanna be sedated

Just put me in a wheelchair, get me to the show
Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go loco
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my toes
Oh no-o-o-o-o

[Outro]
Ba ba baba, baba ba baba, I wanna be sedated
Ba ba baba, baba ba baba, I wanna be sedated
Ba ba baba, baba ba baba, I wanna be sedated
Ba ba baba, baba ba baba, I wanna be sedated"

Now if you never left Houston get a passport
Never left Little Haiti get a passport
If you live in South Central get a passport
So you can see the world
Yeah, and if you rep the five boroughs get a passport
Or if you're in the Dirty South get a passport
If you're on the Westside get a passport
So you can see the world

[Pharrell]
Now I've been known to levitate
Like a hobo tryna catch a freight
To get away, and clear the day
Then I'll be smilin' at the stars like the hood does cars
Little ghetto mind you should travel like a bullet
From your favorite gun's barrel or the Indian's arrow
Mathematically aligned like the pyramids or Pharaohs
Don't let 'em bring demise like you and your boys are cattle
Fly to Paris, and end up in Tokyo
Let's start a coalition so even the broke can go
To all those that never sold coke before
And with no ambitions to rock or roll
Let my, people go
To broaden their horizons
Sharpen all they minds in
Sharper than the prong or the Neptune's trident
I'm just ramblin' - I ride my bike in the clouds
Mr. Spielberg, hire me at Amblin
(To the nigga Pimp C) God bless your life
(And the creators of the syrup) I hope you're restin' right
Because you screwed a lot of lives, kids and wives
In my mind I'm goin' ""woo-hoo"" just like The Hives
But in my mind, compromise my design
Like a missin' puzzle piece, make completion hard to find
Hours resuscitated by Capri Sun juice packs
Woke up singin' N.E.R.D. songs and you can YouTube that
Now stay away from people that pursuit they lack
And remember your starter kit was this Lupe track
Now one love (one love) one love (one love)
Hey love, see you in Tokyo
[Q-Tip]
My new passport has been issued so I'm ready
Trekkin the Sahara or grazin the Serengeti
I am there if there's speakers in the place
I will see a foreign face
My magic carpet shuttles me through the human race
But, no matter what's on her mood to foreign district
My postcards so you I missed it
It bein us, how we would discuss findin treasures
Deep in choral reefs, Tigerbillies Islands of pleasure
Holdin you my pretty 'til I get home to our city
In this chitty-chitty bang-bang brutal to our bus
So I, take it in, the wonderments of the world
Samplin each cuisine, a dinner without a girl
Presents for my people like these silly t-shirts
While Rebecca's at the sound check hooked to Mic Works
I remember days when the dollar was strong
Hopefully it gets better, I won't be gone long - backpack

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Let's go to sleep in Paris, wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans, fall in love in Chicago
Mayne, then we can land in the motherland
Camel back across the desert sands
Then take a train, to Rome, or home
Brazil, for real
Wherever I go she goes
[Sarah Green]
Yeah, I'd done seen Paris, and woke up in Tokyo
But I'mma always be Sarah Green from the Southside of Chicago
Just because you on Section 8 and he left
It don't mean a thing (""Girl I can't go nowhere"")
Just come and take a flight with me
Baby girl it's a world to see! (girl go on wit all that)
I never thought the Seven Wonders of the World
Would be so wonderful (for real?)
You got your ghetto pass, now go and get your passport
And make your swagger international (I'll think about it)
If you can, catch a flight, you can go, in your mind
Your destiny, YOU DECIDE! Wherever I go, we go

[Lupe Fiasco]
Oversees, even over here I over seer
Like I'm tryna stop these slaves from gettin freer
From the truth I never veer see, so, faithfully I steer
As I ride through yo' city like Revere, revered
Now everybody gon' and put yo' hands in the air
All you haters with yo' hands in yo' ears - it's okay
Cause later, it will sneak up on you like it's Metal Gear
Put you in a chokehold and then unconsciously you'll cheer
Remain upper tier, ain't no cryin down here
Only shed is in the back, yard with the tools in it
My hood's in disrepair with no schools in it
All the food ain't got no fuel in it
So crude, that's why I'm duelin it
Some dude's thinkin what Rasulullah do in it
Not what they did then, but now what do you do with it?
I know you sick of all the rat-tat-tat-tat
Well this the soothin sounds from the backpack rat pack
Seein Sarah Green from the FNF crew
Two from the Child Rebel and the Q
When I be home I resist it like it's Ohms
I was there, now I'm gone; Shalom!
Yeah, and if you rep the Midwest get a passport
If you from Detroit get a passport
If you from Chi-Town get a passport
So you can see the world
Get that little black girl, a passport
Get that little black boy, a passport
If you ain't got one, get yourself a passport
So you can see the world, yeah!"

But back then dough was like a whore that Goldie love, it didn't exist
And Officer Foldy Cuffs was after my wrists
Was not Beverly Hills where we chilled
Imagine this, the Nazareth had to get from rags to rich

Figurin', how do I turn my Timberlands to Crocs?
Now reptiles was left out, I'm 'bout a watch, what is you thinkin'?

Don't make me stand up, told you
You ain't gotta have your hands up
I was like, screw paper
Then I ran round touched money, changed my mind
Mind on my change so I tucked money hands down
Now, in addition to the semi
There's paper on the waist like Henry
And niggas ain't seeing what I'm keeping concealed
They wanna be it, chill; you would leak it if the secret's revealed
Peep it, might leak it to polices and squeal
Then you gotta hide money like
Fresh or witness protect
Went from, best to business exec in less than 4!
You can get it in the chest like Fresh
Anything not next to Tec is hidden in the floor
So act like you Denzel or Rudy Ray Moore
Wait, there's more:
Let me catch you tappin' my floor like Savion or Morse
Hope you like the sound of hollow, I got more

No colours anymore, I want them to turn black

I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day

I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts

Never Enough,Eminem,['hip hop'],"[Verse 1: Eminem]
There's not much you could do or say to phase me
People think I'm a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Dre-zie
Will have to step in every once in a while to save me
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
A lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erased me
I may be a little too fast-paced and racy
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me
Twenty times 'cause I say so many rhymes it may seem
Like I'm goin' too fast 'cause my mind is racing
And I could give a fuck what category you place me
Long as when I'm pushing up daisies
And gone as long as you place me amongst one of them greats
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z
For every single die-hard fan who embraced me
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me
In the neighborhood daily that jumped and chased me
It only made me what I am today, see
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
You ain't gonna make or break me
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
'Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving
To say to me, you had all this time to think about it
Now don't pussy out and try to about face me
'Cause I've been patiently waiting for the day
That we finally meet in the same place to see

Kubla Khan,Samuel Taylor Coleridge,['dance'],"Preface:

The following fragment is here published at the request of a poet of great and deserved celebrity, and, as far as the Author's own opinions are concerned, rather as a psychological curiosity, than on the ground of any supposed poetic merits.

In the summer of the year 1797, the Author, then in ill health, had retired to a lonely farm-house between Porlock and Linton, on the Exmoor confines of Somerset and Devonshire.   In consequence of a slight indisposition, an anodyne had been prescribed, from the effects of which he fell asleep in his chair at the moment he was reading the following sentence, or words of the same substance, in ""Purchas's Pilgrimage"":  ""Here the Khan Kubla commanded a palace to be built, and a stately garden thereunto.   And thus ten miles of fertile ground were inclosed with a wall.""   The Author continued for about three hours in a profound sleep, at least of the external senses, during which time he has the most vivid confidence, that he could not have composed less than from two to three hundred lines; if that indeed can be called composition in which all the images rose up before him as things, with a parallel production of the correspondent expressions, without any sensation of consciousness of effort. On awaking he appeared to himself to have a distinct recollection of the whole, and taking his pen, ink, and paper, instantly and eagerly wrote down the lines that are here preserved.   At this moment he was unfortunately called out by a person on business from Porlock, and detained by him above an hour, and on his return to his room, found, to his no small surprise and mortification, that though he still retained some vague and dim recollection of the general purport of the vision, yet, with the exception of some eight or ten scattered lines and images, all the rest had passed away like the images on the surface of a stream into which a stone has been cast, but, alas! without the after restoration of the latter!

Then all the charm
Is broken -- all that phantom-world so fair
Vanishes, and a thousand circlets spread,
And each mis-shape's the other.   Stay awhile,
Poor youth! who scarcely dar'st lift up thine eyes--
The stream will soon renew its smoothness, soon
The visions will return!   And lo, he stays,
And soon the fragments dim of lovely forms
Come trembling back, unite, and now once more
The pool becomes a mirror.

Yet from the still surviving recollections in his mind, the Author has frequently purposed to finish for himself what had been originally, as it were, given to him.  Sameron [h]adion asô: but the to-morrow is yet to come. As a contrast to this vison, I have annexed a fragment of a very different character, describing with equal fidelity the dream of pain and disease.


In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
A stately pleasure-dome decree:
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
Through caverns measureless to man
Down to a sunless sea.
So twice 5 miles of fertile ground
With walls and towers were girdled round:
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;
And here were forests ancient as the hills
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.

But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted
Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!
A savage place! as holy and enchanted
As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted
By woman wailing for her demon-lover!
And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,
As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,
A mighty fountain momently was forced:
Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst
Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail
Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail:
And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
It flung up momently the sacred river.
Five miles meandering with a mazy motion
Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,
Then reached the caverns measureless to man
And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:
And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far
Ancestral voices prophesying war!
The shadow of the dome of pleasure
Floated midway on the waves;
Where was heard the mingled measure
From the fountain and the caves.
It was a miracle of rare device,
A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!

A damsel with a dulcimer
In a vision once I saw:
It was an Abyssinian maid
And on her dulcimer she played,
Singing of Mount Abora.
Could I revive within me
Her symphony and song,
To such a deep delight 'twould win me
That with music loud and long
I would build that dome in air,
That sunny dome! those caves of ice!
And all who heard should see them there,
And all should cry, Beware! Beware!
His flashing eyes, his floating hair!
Weave a circle round him thrice,
And close your eyes with holy dread,
For he on honey-dew hath fed
And drunk the milk of Paradise."

When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, ""Let it be""
And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, ""Let it be""

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be

Rocky Road,Chamillionaire,['hip hop'],"[Hook: Chamillionaire]
The rain is fallin and the weather is cold
Don't know which way to go but I continue to roll
The rainfall is really takin a toll
On my mind and my body and on my spirit and soul
The rain's fallin but I'm keepin a hold
On the light cause I know that I could spin out of control
I know (know) I know (know) I knowwww
This is gonna be one rocky road

[Chamillionaire]
Uhh, what part of the voyage is this? Friendship and business don't mix
With anyone else it's just business, with friends I'm personally pissed
Is this a curse or a gift? Guess I was blessed with my wish
Don't tell me that you feel my pain that I seen, it's best that we switch
You take the fortune and fame and see if it's what you expected
Take the money and change and be careful where you invest it
Just take the test and don't stress it, you get stopped by a detective
Tryin to get in your personal life, gotta do your best to protect it
The answer rests in the message, when I go I go in a blaze
But it won't be no Captain Save 'Em cause where I'm goin you saved
Tryin to rain down on my parade 'til that umbrella get raised
They thinkin that they can read me when they ain't nowhere my page
Tryin to keep a smile on my face, even at times when I engage
In business conversations with people I know are snakes
It's like it's a piece of cake, part of the icing is venom
Spend a lifetime tryin to bring me down, but I just ain't gonna let 'em
You better tell 'em
[Hook]

[Chamillionaire]
Uhh, I'm back and forth and I'm pacin, bein more patient than patients
Tryin to wait for the good news to show up but I'm unfortunately waitin
Gotta be group participation if it's in the courts that we makin
I was unfortunately done and she was unfortunately fakin
Cause the only sexual spark is the spark he got for the dough
They say 'til death do us part but that part is where she says no
There are too many emotions, emotions like pins and needles
Actin like emotions are evil like showin love is illegal
I thought that it was a eagle but I seen this vulture befo'
He thinks this is where I'll stop cause he sees that I'm walkin slow
But no I think you should know that soon as I get where I go
You'll remember the fact that I had a purpose for sho'
I hope you know where you're goin, I hope you know that today
On the side of the road you gon' see a whole lot of snakes
When the bad weather comes to rain down on your parade
Just raise up your umbrella and try to keep goin straight
And keep on goin

[Hook]

[Devin the Dude]
This road has many curves, many bumps and potholes
It can even take you through a loop if you ain't got yo'
{shit} together, unpredictable weather could leave you
Dehydrated, frostbitten, washed away or either
Ran over by heavy traffic, watch where you roam
Cause, it's a challenge just tryin to make it home
But, still I walk, I keep my pace, I keep my stride
Would hitchhike but there's too much pride
I must find a narrow path so I can walk and laugh out loud
Choir sing without bein judged by the crowd
Maybe someday I could just fly away but for now
I just beat my feet and get there someway, somehow
And, mile after mile after mile I'll smile
Keepin my head up even though rain's pourin down
And the road gets rough and the journey is long
I might get tired but I must move on
[Hook]

[Chamillionaire]
Most of our heroes are locked up, diseased, or deceased
You could never really feel remorse until somebody restin in peace
You measure the best by success and ain't impressed by nothin less
Only time we say we wanna change is when we ain't got no change left
Only time we call on God is when there is nobody else to call
Keep stumblin over the same roadblock that just made you fall
We always gotta wait 'til somethin happen before we start reactin
We at war with ourselves, how much longer are we gon' be attackin?

{*rainfall and thunder fades out*}"
Mending Wall,Robert Frost,['country'],"Something there is that doesn't love a wall,
That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,
And spills the upper boulders in the sun,
And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.
The work of hunters is another thing:
I have come after them and made repair
Where they have left not one stone on a stone,
But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,
To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,
No one has seen them made or heard them made,
But at spring mending-time we find them there.
I let my neighbor know beyond the hill;
And on a day we meet to walk the line
And set the wall between us once again.
We keep the wall between us as we go.
To each the boulders that have fallen to each.
And some are loaves and some so nearly balls
We have to use a spell to make them balance:
'Stay where you are until our backs are turned!'
We wear our fingers rough with handling them.
Oh, just another kind of out-door game,
One on a side. It comes to little more:
There where it is we do not need the wall:
He is all pine and I am apple orchard.
My apple trees will never get across
And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.
He only says, 'Good fences make good neighbors'.
Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder
If I could put a notion in his head:
'Why do they make good neighbors? Isn't it
Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.
Before I built a wall I'd ask to know
What I was walling in or walling out,
And to whom I was like to give offence.
Something there is that doesn't love a wall,
That wants it down.' I could say 'Elves' to him,
But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather
He said it for himself. I see him there
Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top
In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.
He moves in darkness as it seems to me—
Not of woods only and the shade of trees.
He will not go behind his father's saying,
And he likes having thought of it so well
He says again, ""Good fences make good neighbors."""
The Mower Against The Gardens,Andrew Marvell,['country'],"Luxurious man, to bring his vice in use,
Did after him the world seduce,
And from the fields the flowers and plants allure
Where Nature was most plain and pure.
He first inclosed within the gardens square
A dead and standing pool of air,
And a more luscious earth for them did knead
Which stupefied them while it fed.
The pink grew then as double as his mind;
The nutriment did change the kind.
With strange perfumes he did the roses taint;
And flowers themselves were taught to paint.
The tulip white did for complexion seek,
And learned to interline its cheek;
Its onion root they then so high did hold,
That one was for a meadow sold:
Another world was searched through oceans new
To find the marvel of Peru;
And yet these rarities might be allowed
To man, that sovereign thing and proud,
Had he not dealt between the bark and tree
Forbidden mixtures there to see.
No plant now knew the stock from which it came;
He grafts upon the wild the tame,
That the uncertain and adulterate fruit
Might put the palate in dispute.
His green seraglio has its eunuchs too,
Lest any tyrant him outdo;
And in the cherry he does Nature vex,
To procreate without a sex.
'Tis all enforced, the fountain and the grot,
While the sweet fields do lie forgot,
Where willing Nature does to all dispense
A wild and fragrant innocence;
And fauns and fairies do the meadows till,
More by their presence than their skill.
Their statues polished by some ancient hand
May to adorn the gardens stand;
But, howsoe'er the figures do excel,
The Gods themselves with us do dwell."
Gorillas,Army of the Pharaohs,['hip hop'],"[Verse 1 – Crypt the Warchild]
YY'all get too close, I'mma squeeze the life out of you
You speak too loosely with your words, I'mma silence you
You ain't a leader, dog—nobody'd die for you
You ain't a killer, dog—who the fuck lied to you?
And I don't even fuck with y'all ballerinas
Tryin' to tiptoe by me, I'mma stab your team up
Tryin' to get dough by me, I'mma snatch your cream up
‘Cause my squad gotta eat and y'all can't come between us
Thoughts of blowin' my fuckin' head off when I look at my gun
I cock back, can't squeeze when I look at my son
I stop that, can't breathe.  Y'all wouldn't walk in my shoes
I'm antisocial, don't speak unless I talk with a tool

[Verse 2 – Esoteric]
You can take the braggin', the boastin', add up the passion devotion
The crabs that lack in emotion, we throw 'em back in the ocean
The Pharaohs packin' the potion, we back in action and rappers are chokin'
Actin' like they smokin' cats, their backs will get broken
And '96 was the year I started talkin' with Vinnie
Rockin' the city, talkin', really reppin' Boston and Philly
Now you can find us lined up with OS and QD
We flow best, so don't test, we grotesque and beauty
I profess a slow death, your plan of attack's a panic attack
Still better than Bush's plan for Iraq
My fam in the back, known to keep it realer than most
While you fake cats cower like the Steelers coach
[Chorus – Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, we the realest.  Ain't nobody stoppin' the fam
And we gorillas, walk around with Glocks in our hand
And we some killas, run it like the Mafia ran
And you should feel us cause we turn your fuckin' block into sand

[Verse 3 – Apathy]
We been bubblin' like Bazooka Joe since Boogie Down and Super Ho
Futuristic, new simplistic, sweatin' my computer flow
Army of the armed and dangerous, we stay with stainlesses
Status is famous, raps translated to seven languages
Rulin' rap, iron fisted, flow's fluid, rhyme is liquid
Nitrogen, knife in my pocket, pull it out when shit gets twisted
Y'all lookin' for villains?  Well, I'm that guy
I charge junior high kids for a contact high
And I could always tell y'all was on some faggot shit
Like singin' Lil' Kim's parts during Magic Stick
You'll get your face rocked, nose popped, we got heat cocked
The A-dot, o-dot, t-dot, P-dot

[Verse 4 – Planetary]
Yo, ever since Blood and Ashes, life's slowly been changin'
Catch me sweatin' every night with my rosary, prayin'
Meditatin', bathin' in blood, face full of mud
So grimy, tryin' to speak to me's like takin' a drug
Razor blades under the tongue, with ""Ways of the Gun""
Playin' in the background when I'm embracin' my sons
It's like I'm huggin' Satan, though.  They feel the evil inside me
Nah boys, it's me, Papi, can't one emcee stop me
I'm stressed, blessed with a gift.  I'm still tryna make it
Stained from separations, my brain is like a matrix
I tighten up my laces, prepare for the sequel
Until then, I'm gon' hustle and take care of my peoples
What!
[Chorus – Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, we the realest.  Ain't nobody stoppin' the fam
And we gorillas, walk around with Glocks in our hand
And we some killas, run it like the Mafia ran
And you should feel us cause we turn your fuckin' block into sand
Yeah, we the realest.  Ain't nobody stoppin' the fam
And we gorillas, walk around with Glocks in our hand
And we some killas, run it like the Mafia ran
And you should feel us cause we turn your fuckin' block into sand"

Cuz I keep cream, I'm large on the street scene
I keep cream, I'm large on the street scene
Every time I touch mics, I'm large on the street scene

[Verse 1]
Heads start bobbing like ""who's this?""
Vado that dude spits, sharper than steak knives from Ruth Chris
You hors d'oeuvres get toothpicks, I aim to shoot shit
Sweep up ya whole block; no broomsticks
When I touch mics, I come right
They like ""son nice"", get thrown like hung Nikes
Every bar's a gun fight, get one strike
Coke like Tiger Woods, fuck with too much white (Haaa!)
Proud dream, my style mean
Wish I was here, see the next thing they crown king (Vado!)
It's that swag that Uptown bring
4 pound swing, you be down before the sound DING!
You ask me, you sound weak, you not a threat
Like Artest I don't stand too far from the best (Killa!)
Carhartt and vest, no I ain't the hardest yet
There's a few artists left, words for them ""God Bless""

[Verse 2]
Live performance hit the stage no encore
A wild cat that can ball like he John Wall
Get crossed, big cross wearing like John Paul
No Pope, peel dope, got it inside walls
I cop ounces from the Hill
Uptown and down the block from where Malcolm was killed
Street built, could tell the album is real
Numbers could go on heads, thats just how a nigga feel
Tight if you want, you either fight or get jumped
If I was in hell, I'd have Satan light me a blunt
Got a variety, if it ain't the trey, it might be the pump
Dig a hole for all his kids, throw wife in the trunk
Fuck Life, I fear nothing, you nice? Lemme hear something
I'm like a Mack Truck, you a deer running
Straight roadkill, I don't care buzzin, my name in the air buzzin'
Cops floodin' the block like the mayor comin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Ten dollar bag is a dime
A bad bitch thats fine
Got work on the strip you grind
See a nigga you say slime (Sliiiime!), locked up you got time
Coke you got lines, deal you got signed
Stop it 5 you all talk, singles we call shorts
And popped off means we all for it
Cotton Club thugs ya'll all soft
Blocks thats boardwalks, shipping you up top that's up North
One time means fuck off
Or say it before you hang up the phone, dap your man then walk off
A hot cars a toy, a cop car's the boys
We call Nike Shox the boings, loose change is coins
Gunplay you shoot things with noise
Say you wearing bang bang means your chain is moist
You like the way I deliver it?
I talk for Harlem, I will never stop kicking it

See ever since the day I've got the chance to make a change
I've been in this game, it's a new day
And I'm makin it known cause, I just want the world to know
I'm payin my dues, and I got the utmost, I just wanna let you know
I'm payin homage cause, you've paved the way for me, ye-yeah

[Verse 2: The Game]
Public Enemy and N.W.A
Is all my boombox had to say
""Today was a Good Day"" had the hood buzzin
Ice Cube my favorite rapper, y'all niggas can't tell me nothing
Everybody first bootleg was ""Boyz N the Hood""
Whoever thought gangsta rap would make noise in the hood?
When the cars ride by with the ""Boomin' System""
Two door Mustang, and the roof was missin'
Every girl at your school had the new extensions
Even gangstas was dancin' like New Edition
Cause the house parties stayed rockin all night
Niggas came through and shot it up but it was alright (alright)
Cause after the cops left, it was a party then
You down with O.P.P.? Then bring Naughty in
They say ""It Never Rain in Southern California"", Tony! Toni! lied
Sit back, watch Game throw his money in the sky

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
See ever since the day I've got the chance to make a change
I've been in this game, it's a new day
And I'm makin it known cause, I just want the world to know
I'm payin my dues, and I got the utmost, I just wanna let you know
I'm payin homage cause, you've paved the way for me, ye-yeah
[Verse 3: The Game]
Cash Rules Everything Around Me, C.R.E.A.M get the money
In the back, I relax with all the hunnies
DJ bring it back, let it go
Mix it in with Black Rob, make 'em say ""WHOA!""
Everything full circle, Game livin' major
Girls on my hip like a Skytel pager
Now I'm on the top, let the champagne pop
Throw ya hands in the sky cause The Game don't stop
Just a little more change, gotta Benz and the Range
Every rap metaphor always ends in my name
The Kool Hercs, DJ Red Alerts
Before I was born they was talkin 'bout The Game
Ask a Jay-Z fan 'bout Big Daddy Kane
Don't know him, Game gonna show 'em
Just like they showed me, my lyrics is O.G
When it's all said and done, you niggas gon' quote me

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
See ever since the day I've got the chance to make a change
I've been in this game, it's a new day
And I'm makin it known cause, I just want the world to know
I'm payin my dues, and I got the utmost, I just wanna let you know
I'm payin homage cause, you've paved the way for me, ye-yeah

[Outro: Keyshia Cole]
See, Mary J. I want you to understand
You paved the way, for me
I'm givin' homage, to you"

Yeah, it’s B-O (Hey, 'Nelle!)

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Well if you’re looking for me I’m probably in Metropolis, I
Do this for the love so this is nonprofit shit, I'm
Bored walking, so you can call this monopoly
Obviously, my approach to music ain’t moderate
As my Mer-ka-Ba spins I am the anomaly, I
Love all the haters 'cause the haters is what got me here
Strangers ""Hey Bobby"" me, groupies try to body me
But I’m a different planet, so excuse my astrology
But there are no apologies for dropping all these prophecies
Breaking over barriers, you juggernauts ain’t stopping me
Balance ain’t symmetrical, I guess I’m just geometry
Guess I’m just atomically built, the way that I bomb on the beat
Bomb on the beat, you slide on the beat
We slide on our feet, we tightrope
I don’t need no optometry, I’ll do this in a blindfold
Honestly, we live that type of life people would die for
So we keep on tipping, never slipping, yeah we tightrope
[Hook: Janelle Monáe]
Baby, baby, whether you high or low (High or low)
Baby, whether you high or low (High or low)

And I'm still tipping on it

Greetings, welcome to the meeting of the minds
That be thinking all the time of defeating all the blind
Following, swallowing
Drinking of the time-honored traditions of keeping in a line
I prefer to figure eight and then Mandelbrot
Rock all night 'til the candles on my mantel stop
And it's paid programming on every single channel watched
Televised revolutionaries on the chapel top
Shouting, down at Babylonian accounting
Medieval mathematics equals averaging, amounting
But I surpass that, I dropped out of they math class
I am, cause I thought now my tightrope like a sidewalk, blat!

And I'm still tipping on it

Ha, ha, ha, now, now—now—now—now
I can grind with the fellas and rock a stage acapella, never—
Can you hear me; I'm unpredictable like the weather
T—T—T—Talking about me, I stay floating like a feather
Jump on the elevator, baby, we on the next level
Album just dropped, and I been on a couple covers
Black-and-white tux, ain't no need for no other colors
T-T-T-Talking 'bout, ""W-W-Why don't she change her clothes?""
Well, they ain't seem to mind the last three times I posed in Vogue
Some people get high, and then, some people get low
Well, I'm gon' keep it in the middle so my people can know
Underdog, stand up tall, 'cause I'm talkin to y'all
I can pose, I balance all like I'm Dominique Dawes
And I'm gone!

My Glock burst, leave in a hearse, I did worse
I come rough, tough like an elephant tusk
Your head rush, fly like Egyptian musk
Aww shit, Wu-Tang Clan spark the wicks, an'
However I master the trick just like Nixon
Causin' terror, quick damage your whole era
Hard rocks is locked the fuck up, or found shot
P.L.O. style, hazardous, 'cause I wreck this dangerous
I blow sparks like Waco, Texas
[Verse 2: Raekwon]
I watch my back like I'm locked down
Hardcore-hittin' sound
Watch me act bugged and tear down
Illiterate-type asshole, songs goin' gold
No doubt, and you watch a corny nigga fold
Yeah, they fake and all that, carryin' gats
But yo, my Clan rollin' like forty macks
Now you act convinced, I guess it makes sense
Wu-Tang, yo, soooo represent!
I wait for one to act up, now I got him backed up
Gun to his neck now, react what?

I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits
Check it, my method on the microphone's bangin'
Wu-Tang slang'll leave your headpiece hangin'
Bust this, I'm kickin' like Seagal: Out for Justice
The roughness, yes, the rudeness, ruckus
Redrum, I verbally assault with the tongue
Murder One, my style shocks your knot like a stun gun
I'm hectic, I wreck it with the quickness
Set it on the microphone, and competition get blown

Yeah, yeah
These niggas losing their minds, you find that there's no reward
They say they already home, it’s really clear they abroad
They sound like they boxed in, it’s not just where they record
There’s a cost to be a boss they can’t clearly afford
Swear to the Lord, there's guns like a audience
You put on a show, my .40 clearly applauds
Sitting fifth row, I might appear to be bored
Plotting on a Kanye, but screaming, ""Where’s my award?""
Balling out of control, never won an ESPY
'Bout to buy a black ghost and name that shit SP
Flow outta this world, I’m coming for my Moon Man
You niggas slide back like that walking on the moon dance
No glitter glean, handgun with a beam
Have some boys follow you, Street Fam, Twitter team
Like you could fuck with me, oh did it seem?
Dr. King and Def Jam ain't the only ones with a dream
I’m a grown ass man, this kid a teen
You’re a spoof of me like if hip hop did a Scream
Audi coupe looking good so I went and copped it
Got that TT popping like a trending topic
My ride's matte black, my pride is that jacked
It might get ya dog shot, even a cat smacked
Anyway though, styles don’t apply to me
Jeff Goldblum couldn’t be more fly than me
Shorty say, ""Right after the suck, fuck, poof""
You hit it on the head girl, duck duck goose
You shoulda got the message that I chuck up deuce
Break 'em off and leave it, you seen my fucked up tooth
It’s fuck a bitch, it’s more fish in the aquarium
I rarely hear no, like when niggas ask you to marry them
There’s no lights in the place you buy your jewelry from
Funeral Fab, I’m just here to bury them
[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Reporting live from the Beacon, booth tired from the beating
Had foreplay all day, prepping the beat and the mic for a threesome
With my vocal bi-coastal, speeding 'til the ride's totaled
Mr. Wi-Fi, out a franchise go to magic, standby local’s
Watch the track bust once I show my dick size to the Pro-Tools
I teach you how to have models screaming, ""Get behind me""
E-pills and Maybachs ain't gon' matter if your tip is tiny
Never mind me, we could get knee deep in the beef
Seek me with the heat but you’ll need more to keep me on a leash
Here’s a CC for the peeps that wanna see me in the streets
Invest in Rockports and be easy on your feet
Give a few hammers, a few semi’s and a few snubs
To a few Crips, couple vampires and true Bloods
Gambling in casinos, have a honey handing me my c-notes
The modern day Gambino, I’m careful every step I take
You the nigga walk up in a shootout with some pepper spray
That’d be the last mistake you ever made
Me, I chop his head off from a rooftop
And race it downstairs just to see if I can catch his fade
Like groceries when I’m shooting at fags
Make sure the bread's separated and put the fruits in a bag
Withstand the hatred, dudes is fallin off doin all they can to save it
But everybody's run stops, ask Brandon Jacobs
What y’all call swag to me is all faggotry
Fours want blast at me, that’d equal more casualties
Abort the strategy or get attacked with that Duracell
They put in your back, now that's assault and battery
You can keep the bitching to yourself
There’s beams on every burner, these lasers, a petition wouldn’t help
What good is having shooters if they the type that miss?
Where I’m from, better be careful where you drive that whip
Niggas put they life at risk for pies they flip
In my town, Ben Affleck wouldn't try that shit
And if he did he’d get turned around, burnt down
Tell the new jacks it’ll be a while 'fore they eligible to earn the crown
[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Acid out the baggie, this is more than dope, flawless flow
Fucking off a sign every horoscope done wore my robes
Strapping up the corner cold, critical
Unquestioned, my opponents know
I shoot like Kapono, watch me own the show
Comatose, toasted, getting money while I roam the coast
Stones and boats, mansion homes and hoes
I deserve ‘em both, overdose
Time to earn my votes, watch me turn the volts
Voltage through a meter, this electric chair, danger
Yeah, I see ya, now make way 'fore it turn to diarrhea
Hear a microphone will give you 3 of everything I wear yeah
Models by the pair, swear, bottles, private Lear, steer
Style that's outta here, rare, thousands by the chair, square
Sleep with me, you came here, war with me is scary
Get beat silly trying to lamp here, better bring your fury heat
I got a drop damp here, niggas try me barely
No one breathes, I need an ant's ear, pressure's necessary
Got my mind on the cheddar, kill my haters together
Bury 'em in abundance and starve their families stomach’s
Paper come in my thumbage, brand new fifties and hundreds
On point, just like the drum is, I’m warning them baby mothers
Got the hunger of a broke rapper
Kill you while I’m rolling up then smoke after
Catch you at your show, snatch ya, empty out the dough faster
Bentley off the scene, magnum Mo' splasher, four packer
Southside nigga spitting coke at ya!
[Verse 4: Royce da 5’9""]
Nickel! This is for the fronters and the naysayers
I’m about to scare away the drummers and the bass players
They say I’m out of my league on this one, so when I get done
I want you to cut your fuckin' ears off and Twitpic ‘em!
Lord, I want you to leave this vicinity
You gon' be around here 'bout long as Justin Bieber’s virginity
This is Jesus identity, mixed with weed, Hennessy, Kennedy, King
Mixed with a kill or be killed killer regime, illest you seen, switch
Y’all write all that hard shit then you fall right off, it’s horrible
My oracle is all I offer, so before I borrow your
'Won’t be here tomorrow' flow, sorry, I will prob'y
Adiós my body wit' somebody toast, this shit just practice
Sickest rapping Baptist, kill your pastor
Steal your Chapstick, after that make you kiss a cactus
Then take your ho, make the ho give the whole clique fellatio
Everyone, that wasn’t the whole entourage on HBO
Then after that, I tell her, ""I can’t do much with you, shawty!
I just found out I could fly to Dubai and hire Buffie the Body!""
Don't call us if the bitches ain’t flawless
If they are then we can hang like Aretha Franklin bra-less
The drunk me can box like a sober you
The sober me be more nervous than Waka Flocka in the voting booth
We beef like being deep and dumping K’s
You beef like Lady Gaga and her stylist
Y’all get together to look good in front of a bunch of gays
My feng shui is a pump in the desert
You’ll come up shorter than an Asian jumping out of a trunk in the desert
While my wolfpack looks for strippers and cocaine
Niggas snitching, it’s a shame, we call 'em male tattlers
Fiends touching they noses more than URL battlers
It’s hard to spit saliva when you spit fire, so I’ll just
Pour sugar in your gas tank, put a banana in your tailpipe
Ah ha, so the car can fit the driver"
30 Minutes,Gk,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","Half an hour could change a life
And Whether its wrong or right
Someone could take a knife
And sit and slice
Ur kids and wife
Or wat if u pic a fight
And none of the kids you like
Are pickin up the fone, now ur all alone getting kicked and striked
Or u get in ur whip and drive
And u start to slip and slide
Next minute u hit a bike
How u know she Didn’t die
I kno it doesn’t look nice
But u gotta pay for all of ur mistakes
And Just hope for a good price
Never think twice, anything can happen
All u gotta do is stay true and the Be the captain
Avoiding all the icebergs, and yeaImight panic
But my flow is like a ship cuz my rhymes are titanic
And I managed to get where I am
But I don’t where im going, and I don’t when ill land
AllIknow is that its gonna be long flight, all right
But all it takes is 30 minutes on the Wrong night

This is wat u get when I spit from the heart…
I don’t regret what I did from the start
There were nights I would sit in the dark
There were days I jus hid in the car
But times have slowly changed, and im at an older age, thinkin whats the next chapter turn another page
As the days got colder
My Brain went outta order
Now Im stayin on the border
Or maybe on the edge
If I take another step…ill be fallin off the ledge
And they said I would be dead...But im callin off the bet
I used to want the bread.. and be ballin on a jet
Now all this clyde wants is a bonnie on the bed
U kno a down ass chick
Doesn’t ask for a glass of wine, just a 40 in a brown bag shit
See I thought that the money put a smile on my face
But I was on a chase
To catch a a trial or a case
I was tired of the race
So I had to make a pit stop… goin psycho.... alfred hitchcock

I couldn’t care less about any commitment
My days as a player were very consistent, I was on a mission
I couldn’t resist it , never had to listen, but always got to kiss em
And my mind was always poisoned by the weed and the booze
Went from 20,s to benjy's, to g’s I would lose
Didn’t even care what I would see on the news
I got a wrinkle on my face, like a Crease on my shoe

I was living like a kid without any type of limit
Every Sunday morning I had to find a clinic
Cuz the night before, I fucked with no condom
Now the morning after pill will solve the whole problem
So u snort a couple lines, then u blame it on the crack
When u end up wit a mutherfuckin baby on ur lap
I ain't lookin for the signs of depression, im look for depression to give me a sign, one time
So take my advice, while u alive
Think about the next thirty minutes of ur life…"

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

[Verse 1]
She say she never fell in love with a Superman
Christian, Muslim, Protestant, Lutheran
I told her that being a mortal is the portal
To the true nature of growth; the Christlike Buddha man
That's why I never spit the traditional garbage of a knife fight
Bright lights, white ice to the fans
The radio is just a stereo, like a house ain't a home
And a chair is just a chair, ask Luther Van
Go to work; go to church let your dreams die
Bow tie, Final Call, and a bean pie
Yarmulke for Hanukkah, wish list for Christmas
This is the gist of the life that we lead, why?
So you can fit in, with the closed-minded in the sit-ins
And get clothes-lined in the ed-end
I could care less about a plaque and Bid-enz
And gettin' Punked on TV by my fri-dends
Don't get a nigga wrong
I get tempted by the rewards that all come along with making nigga songs
But what does it mean if I'm a Muslim and you a Jew
And because of that alone we don't get along
And when you talk like this, and try to walk like this
The radio stations'll never put a nigga on
Just Mims, just 50, just Wayne, just Jeezy
Dem Franchize Boyz, and Jimmy Jones
Fuck that, fuck rap, this 'god-hop'
Kingdom music for the hard rocks
I'mma spit it 'til TRL get it and Hot 97 hit a nigga with a bomb drop
Ask Flex, ask Slay, ask Whoo Kid
Just Blaze said Jay is the new kid
I took Eternal Sunshine and I looped it
No drums no hook just new shit
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

...Because He Broke the Rules

[Sample: Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]
Grandpa Joe: Wh-When does he get it?
Willy Wonka: He doesn't
Grandpa Joe: Why not?
Willy Wonka: Because he broke the rules
Grandpa Joe: What rules? We didn't see any rules, did we, Charlie?
[Charlie shakes his head briefly]
Willy Wonka: [springs up from his chair, angrily] Wrong, sir! Wrong! Under section 37B of the contract signed by him, it states quite clearly that all offers shall become null and void if - and you can read it for yourself in this photostatic copy:
[grabs a magnifying glass and reads]
Willy Wonka: ""I, the undersigned, shall forfeit all rights, privileges, and licenses herein and herein contained,"" et cetera, et cetera... ""Fax mentis, incendium gloria cultum,"" et cetera, et cetera... Memo bis punitor delicatum!
[slams the contract copy and the magnifying glass down, continues shouting]
Willy Wonka: It's all there! Black and white, clear as crystal! You stole Fizzy-Lifting Drinks! You bumped into the ceiling, which now has to be washed and sterilized, so you GET... NOTHING! YOU LOSE! GOOD DAY, SIR!

[Verse 2]
The handling of a heart's a very delicate art cause it's paper-thin
One irrelevant thought that started out as a spark could be a poisonous dart
That leaves a permanent mark, that's ice cold in the day and burns in the dark
And makes you never wanna see her face again
Tee-hee, what a place I'm in
Lead me to the station
A one-way ticket, don't look back
One cold tear that froze and cracked
A whole lot of pain I'm holdin' back
Chav said, ""Eff that, roll the sack""
I said, ""If my skull was cracked
And blood ran out to the cul-de-sac
That could not match me where I'm at""
My memories flash me there and back
Yup there goes me right there in black
Holdin' hands, not starin' back
She starts cryin' I start denying, it's my fault
And I'm aware of that
Man, in hindsight signs, be glarin' back
Where's the map to show you where you're at?
I can hear the crowd yelling, I can smell the tire smoke
I can hear the starter pistol where's the track?
Ring no answer came home late
Jane told Dick she had a date
But they was just chillin' and at that moment
The right brain says to the left just kill em
Make the headlines, make the front page
Wild out in the courthouse man thrill 'em
They'll say, ""The boy dead wrong,"" but I feel him

Voodoo Man

[Sample: Turtles Can Fly (translated from Kurdish)]
Satellite: He hasn't walked on a mine! Who said that? Stay where you are! Don't move! How long has he been there?
Boy: Since morning, Satellite
Satellite: Don't move! Don't move!
Riga: Are you talking to me?
Satellite: Yes! If you move you'll die. Please don't move! I'll come over to you
Riga: What?
Satellite: There are mines all around you
Riga: What? I shouldn't move? Are there mines here?
Satellite: Has anybody gone to get his brother?
Pesheow: Yes!
Satellite: Don't move! I'll come over to you. Everyone quiet!

[Verse 3]
Voodoo man, chicken bone chicken bone
I can make a thunderstorm from a light rain
My ears start ringing, my nose get bloody
I feel a little bit of pressure on my right brain
Intermission transmission put me in submission
Glistening trapped in the light prison whistling
The Christ told me come closer to the light man
I went blind, woke up in front of a mic stand
[Verse 4]
Voodoo man, tap dancing in the French Quarter
Walking on water with a scroll in my hand
The blueprints for a disc shaped-like vessel
That was chiseled out of metal off the coast of Japan
Fasting on the top of a mountain out in Tepoztlán
Saw a shiny object floating out of the ocean
I'm sort of like a postman
You can get the message if you want to understand
From the rap Son of Man

[Sample]
...on November 7th saw this disc-shaped object floating above the sea concourse of the United Airlines at O'Hare. Very low in the sky, it was still daylight, very distinct. Didn't look like an airplane, a helicopter, or anything else

[Verse 5]
Voodoo man, civilize the savage
Criticize the parish
Spreading false doctrine
Terrorize the cleric for carrying on nonsense
Specialized lies to paralyze the conscience
Voodoo man, chit chatter Abracadabra
Spitting out matter while I'm shitting out data
Mmm, chew 'em up shitting out rappers
Sipping Pellegrino while I'm giving out matches
Set yourself on fire
Let the wisdom of Elijah purify ya
Take a nigga higher
Sold your soul to the highest buyer
Now you're on the wire talking about two-foot tires
Saying you sell crack
Clapping at cats with macs
But you a liar pants on fire
Same old rugged cross
Different crucified messiah


FYI

[Sample: Elijah Muhammad]
Don’t get me wrong now. Don’t make a mistake in thinking that I’m telling you this was the beginning of the man on the Earth. Fifty thousand years ago is like telling you thirty days ago or ten days ago or five days ago, to the age of the universe. We have no exact record of it but it runs way into the trillions

[Verse 6]
While you was blowin' X amount of dollars on a bracelet
The sovereign nation of France was openin' they files on the UFO phenomenon: i.e. spaceships
It's just the facts, Jack may as well face it
Every rhyme I write the seal get cracked in the chapter of Revelations
A atom get cracked in the blackness of meditation
Mysterious shit
Call me Jay Dogon, I'm on some serious shit
Scholars wonder why don't he bust
Allah blessed me with a Midas-y touch
Everything I lay to hands turn to Ethiopian gold: shiny and buffed
I got a firm understandin' on the minus and plus
So I ain't got time to argue with a rapper 'bout how he ain't got rhymes
That's fuckin' with mine's
I'm trying to kill Lucifer, so if I have to brake
Cause a rapper in my face tellin' me that he the great
You can bet a shiny nickel I'll blast his motherfuckin' ass way past Jupiter
You couldn't be stupider
Fuckin' with the nuclear
Mayan, Aztec lion
Asiatic Blackman from Zion
Quetzalcoatl supreme, lettin' off steam
Dimethyltryptamine make a man dream
But y'all would much rather hear me rappin' 'bout trash
The size of Erykah's ass, blunts and cash
We need savin'
Minds are consumed with swine we need bathin'

[Sample: Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]
Willy Wonka: There it goes. Hold on tight. I'm not exactly sure what's going to happen. Faster, faster...if we don't pick up enough speed, we'll never get through
Charlie: Get through what?
Willy Wonka: Ah-ha!
Grandpa Joe: You mean we're going...
Willy Wonka: Up and out!
Grandpa Joe: But this roof is made of glass. It'll shatter
Into a thousand pieces. We'll be cut to ribbons!
Willy Wonka: Probably.  Hold on, everybody. Here it comes!

Hood Mentality,Ice Cube,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Keith David]
The hood mentality is a crippling disease that attacks your nervous system
It makes you nervous of the system
Gangsters and hood rats are especially susceptible to this grown-stunting mentality
The hood is where I'm from, but it's not what I am
The hood is where I'm from, but it's not what I am

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Fuck school nigga, I'mma be a dope dealer
I'mma be a killer, yep a urban guerrilla
I'mma stack scrilla, yeah buy me a villa
Sell a 5-0 to my auntie Priscilla
I don't give a fuck that she look like ""Thriller""
Hit that shit one more time and fuck around and kill her
Cause I got the heart of a Pittsburgh Steeler
Black nigga draped in gold, with a nine milla
Love money, love jail, love that penitentiary mail
Love the way these niggas smell, keep coming back, can't you tell?
Love to see my mama cry, love to see my babies struggle
Love to see my woman juggle nuts cause she got to hustle
I don't give a fuck how my life go
Now I'm a slave man to this caveman without Geico
Everybody wanna call Michael a psycho
But he ain't never came through the hood with a rifle
Gunning niggas down cause they don't got the right clothes
Hit the wrong person cause we shoot just like hoes
First I was blood thirsty, Mister Mister Controversy
Now I wanna beg for mercy, should have took my ass to Berkeley
[Chorus]
If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality
How the fuck we supposed to change our reality?
If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality
How the fuck we supposed to change our reality?
If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality

If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Fuck school nigga, if I grow a little taller
Everybody tell me I'm gon' do it, I'm gon' be a baller
So fuck that thinking, fuck that thinking
Fuck them Lincolns, I want Franklins
Come back through here with my crew, I'm gon' have my own shoe
I'm gon' be that little fool coming in your living room
Starting point guard nigga, fresh out of middle school
Either it's the NBA or it's the NFL
I don't know what else I can do to keep my ass up out of jail
I wanna be like Tiger Woods, swing that club, make you sick
(I wanna be like Pacman Jones), (I wanna be like Michael Vick)
I wanna be like Barry Bonds, (I wanna be like O.J. Simpson)
Leave this field, leave this prison
Tell you motherfuckers where to kiss 'em
I wanna be all broke up, moving all old and slow
I wanna be a alcoholic just like Broadway Joe
I wanna be a sideshow, kinda like Iron Mike
Used to have a few Bentleys, now I just ride a bike

If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
Fuck school nigga, they ain't trying to educate me
All they give a fuck is what I memorized lately
I'm gon' have to teach myself, clock that money, get that wealth
I wanna be like Santa Claus, I don't wanna be no fucking elf
No kid left behind but he get the runaround
Can't you motherfuckers see that they trying to dumb us down?
Don't trust the government, President is for sale
He don't give a fuck about a nigga, just a oil well
Sell crack, go to jail, bust a rap, go to hell
Do I got to sell my soul if I wanna go to Yale?
Go kiss Oprah's ass if you wanna be Gail
I'd rather have my ass kissed up in Bloomingdale
You can go be a pimp, you can go be a ho
But you only gon' get paid off what you know
If you don't know shit, then you can't work for me
Cause you read your first book in the penitentiary

If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)

[Verse 1]
I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like you's the user
Sellin' drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way, mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray, so you can reminisce
And wish you wasn't livin' so devilish, shit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin' blunts with my crew, flippin' over 62's
'Cause G-E-D wasn't B-I-G
I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out nicks went for 20s down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock 19 for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin' to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin' to hear it
Smokin' mad Newports 'cause I'm due in court
For an assault that I caught in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, 'cause man

I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle

[Verse 2]
I had the master plan, I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-TECs to take over this projects
They call him Two-TECs, he tote two TECs
And when he start to bust, he like to ask, ""Who's next?""
I got my honey on the Amtrak with the crack
In the crack of her ass, two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon to make some quick cash
I told her she could be lieutenant, bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally loungin', black
Sittin' back, countin' double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up, see what's up with my peeps
Toyota deal-athon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead, with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter
Heard TEC got murdered in a town I never heard of
By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G, that's me, blowin' like a bubble
In the everyday struggle

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle

I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)

I'm seein' body after body and our mayor Giuliani
Ain't tryin' to see no black man turn to John Gotti
My daughter use a potty so she's older now
Educated street knowledge, I'ma mold her now
Trick a little dough buyin' young girls fringes
Dealin' with the dope fiend binges, seein' syringes
In the veins, hard to explain how I maintain
The crack smoke make my brain feel so strange
Breakin' days on the set, no sweat
Drunk off Moët, can't bag yet because it's still wet
But when that dry, baggin' five at a time
I can clock about nine on the check cashin' line
I had the first and the third, rehearse, that's my word
Thick in the game, D's knew my first name
Should I quit? Shit no, even though they had me scared
Yo, they got a eight, I got a TEC with air holes

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies

Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies

Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came

Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave

Yo what's Crip-a-lat'n, this big Snoop Dogg
Leave your name and your number at the motherfucking beep
If this one of my hoes, two-way me

[Dr. Dre]
Ay ay Snoop whattup, this your nigga Dre
Ay man I was thinking I ain't said shit on your whole motherfucking album
So check it out, put this on there:
All you motherfucking haters out there, can suck my motherfucking dick!
And we still smoking, what?!

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
For the nigga who be talking loud and holding his dick, talking shit
He better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick, now she sick
She better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking
And I won't do a thing, really hope so
[Snoop Dogg]
Lay low, nobody move until I say so
Limo tint rolling deep like the President
See I don't go to clubs, I never chase a bitch
I'm here to bang that gangsta shit till the apocalypse
We call it stress, some of y'all call it chocolate
Return of the Top Dogg, and ain't no stopping this
Whatever the case, I ain't trying to catch it
Lay low, blow big dope, and slang records
Unseen but well heard, do not disturb
The only reason you alive cause I ain't sent the word
I flip, faster than birds, Snoop Dogg will emerge
From the smoke and go loc, you shouldn't provoke
I bring the worst from the L.B.C
Smash motherfuckers thinking they gonna smash on me
Snoop and Dre give a fuck about what y'all say
From the World's Most Dangerous Group, N.W.A

[Butch Cassidy]
Our rise, it was no surprise
I always knew these fools would trip
Hating, faking, scheming on mine
And on the down low talkin shit
Best move cause I refuse to lose
No matter which damn road I choose
So lay low cause you might be bruised
Top story on the evening news
I ain't for games, so if you wanna play 'em lay low
Lay down on the floor
I'm in a rage, so if we gotta do this let me know
That's what I came fo'
[Goldie Loc]
Where that nigga who be talking shit
He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch
I made her suck my dick, while I was squeezing the tits
Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips
She tried to make me cum, but I was trying to take her home
Dropped her off and seen you fishing on your raggedy Brougham
Coulda thumped you in your dome (you little fag)
And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong

[Tray Deee]
Booyaka booyaka, we bring it straight to ya
From 22's to Luger's the shit that shoot through ya
Who you motherfuckers think the Top Dogg bang with
The same clique he came with and made the game flip
Now niggas grow they hair, hold they stare and act hard
That's even tho' your CEO talk shit get slapped hard
The backyard is where we get our scrap on
The black car drive by then you get capped on

[Master P]
Whassup pimping, it's P and Snoop
With Dre on the beat, this ain't nothing but loot
They call me Jed Clampett for all the bread I got
But they call me Bill Clinton for all the head I got
I keeps it realer, cause I'm all about my scrilla
The ladies love me cause I'm a million dolla hitta
It's, No Limit til I D-I-E

Beasts from the East,Lost Boyz,['hip hop'],"[Pre-Intro: Mr. Cheeks]
""The forecast: showers heavy at times with occasional thunderstorms today and a high of 89 degrees""
The cops said to me, ""yo kid""
""Partial clearing and a low of 74""
Damn! Kghhh!

[Intro: Mr. Cheeks]
Basically, kid
Word, Ren zone, wanna hit?
Queens!
This microphone I got some of this
You know how many member L.B. Tran, get motherfuckin' biz
Along on this track, we got the funk Doctor Spot
Canibus and A+ from far-sized block
Yo, yo, yo, yo, Bink Dawg locks it down

[Verse 1: Mr. Cheeks]
Yo, we come through like bulls, see, ’cause niggas takin' two pulls and pass
Nigga, watch your back once you talk out your ass
I pack a .380 in my stash for protection
Family to raise, the world is acting crazed
I never thought I'd make it, it was hectic when I scrambled
On point like a knife, I'm takin' life as a gamble
Livin' in the rotten apple, yo where every core is rotten
All my niggas, rest in peace, ya see you gone but not forgotten
Now my main wifey, deaded shady chicks
Official Lost Boyz since the year of '86
And fuck these crooked niggas I could kill em with the passion
At times I feel like blastin' in Jamaican Queens fashion
You think you can fuck around, but kid you're just thinking
It's over when I'm sober, imagine when I'm drinking
Without blinking man, I'll tear your crew like pages
I’ll rip you from the backyards, parks and on stages
[Verse 2: A+]
Yo, A+ the lyrically superb one, spittin' rhymes
Off the top of the tongue to burn ya ear drums
Rockin' shit, make the opposite team call a time out
Knocking niggas three times my size out
The crowd loves me, so when I ain't around they ask for me
I buckle up and catch wreck like a crash dummy
For the fast money, I get up in that ass money
The fact you tryna test me kinda bugs me
I leave crews fed up, like handicap niggas tryna get up
Emcees get wet up with lyrical gun pellets
I blow up the spot when it's time to rock
I speak out my voice box and peak out at a hundred watts
Who wanna cipher? I get dumb
Word to my mother, the father, the holy ghost, and Rev Run
When it's all said and done, I end the service
Concoctin' the type of verses average MC's seem to worship

[Interlude: Redman, Canibus]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, Big Dog! Turn the track off!
Fuck how you feel
Yo fake MC's, step to the rear!
Fuck how the lyrical skills get
Yo real MC's, bring this shit up north!

[Verse 3: Redman]
My style is Milk of Magnesia, clutch the five speed and bust
The more the merrier, secure the area
My La Familia is ultimate superior
We don't jack cars, we jack for aircraft carriers
I bounce like trampolines when I be blowing the fiends to pieces
Hem 'em like sewing machines and Jesus
When the shadows of the barrel pointing out my boy Camaro
I get punished like Pharaoh for splittin'
You're better off singin' Christmas carols for Christmas
Because I'm on point like bow and arrow equipment
The president of chicken head conventions
I give you a deluxe Ku Klux lynchin'
I got a headache from the stress, success, not wearing a vest
5-11 for being dirty and court's at 9:30
Yo, Mr.Cheeks, I made this bitch call police
She tried swallowing a nine piece, forgot the warranty on false teeth
I return like Makaveli on 18 inch Pirelli's
Assault and battery like my palms is Eveready
Sharp as machete's, matter of fact I slap for cognac, can the beef heavy
[Verse 4: Canibus]
Canibus brings the sickest drama, fierce enough to pierce the thickest armor
I smack bitches who try to suck dick through a condom
Playing with the mic is something I won't do
My only concern when I approach you is to roast you
I smoke you and whoever you standing close to
And make every man in your crew deny that he knows you
Defeating niggas like Seagal Steven
Putting MCs in positions to prevent 'em from breathing
I'll make you question any and everything you've ever believed in
By peeping your deepest secrets like psychic readers
What's the matter with y'all?
I splatter y'all against the motherfucking wall with these raw lyrics I catapult
None of y'all got the balls big enough to battle
I go ""On and On"" like Erykah Badu
A hundred times nicer than the best is
Twice as African as KRS is, who wanna test this?
Fuck y'all, you don't impress me and no one can test me
An MC so ill, I got AIDS scared to catch me
All that shit you popping will stop when I put you in a headlock
And apply pressure until I crush your motherfucking noggin
I grab mics and push niggas to the left
So fast their hearts end up on the right side of their chests
My hypothesis is that nobody can see this
Lyrical genius, I got it sown like a seamstress
But if you want to battle, I'm down
If you got nine lives, I'll take eight of them off your hands right now
Step up and get your neck cut from ear to ear
If you survive, then you can cover your scar with a beard
I'm the illest from Queens to the new Jerusalem briddicks
Anyone who ain't feeling my shidick can suck my didick
You need to quit it, if you ain't spittin'
More than fifty bars per minute 'cause you ain't in lyrical fitness
Kicking boring raps with metaphors that's wack
All of y'all motherfuckers need NordicTrack
To get ya weight up, fuckin' with Canibus you get ate up
Get beat down and sprayed up, just for bringing my name up
Been rocking longer than niggas twice my age
Back in the days before Bob Marley was rockin' a fade
Before Honest Abe signed the paper that freed slaves
Before Neanderthals was drawing on walls in caves
I existed, in the garden of Eden gettin' lifted
Sticking dick to Eve before she was Adam's mistress
Before Christ created Christmas, I been in lyrical fitness
The Canibus is spitting till he's spitless
Fifty bars of total sickness, you won't forget this
I'm putting every wack Emcee alive on my shit list
Verbally vicious, telekinetically gifted
Took you a minute to exhibit that I'm sick wit it
Now you tell me who you think is damaging shit
Going once, going twice, sold to that nigga named Canibus
Me and Mr. Cheeks, A+, and Funk Doctor
Hopping out the Huey copter to suey chop ya

Motherfuckin niggas can't hang
Well oh no, look at the cloud, it's gonna rain
But I don't give a fuck I'm letting niggas know they can't hang
Don't give me no lip, don't give me no backtalk, yeah break North
Don't make me get my gun and blow your motherfuckin head off
Once again, niggas know my style, God damn it
Unless it's on the cut so give me the mic and watch me slam it
Hard like Shaquille, oh you better kneel
When you see me comin, Big Scoob got em runnin
Sex when I flex I catch wreck on the world tour
With dough in my pockets big like the Biscuits in CB4
Set up a contest, I'm coming, I'm taking the dough
They wouldn't pick you even if you had a afro
So don't try me, you better walk by me
I'll do you like the first part in Menace II Society
Like Cypress Hill, yo, I'm insane
I'll shoot a hole in your toe

Bang biggy bang biggy bang bang, motherfuckin niggas can't hang

Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
We gonna do it like this
Anytime you're ready, check it:
I got seven Mac 11's, about eight 38's
Nine 9's, ten MAC-10's, the shit never ends
You can't touch my riches
Even if you had MC Hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie Smalls the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot Glocks
That's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the lambsbread
Little Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist, or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns,I make number runs
I give mc's the runs, drippin'
When I throw my clip in the AK, I slay from far away
Everybody hit the d-e-c-k
My slow flow's remarkable, peace to Mateo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniffed the yayo
That's crazy blunts, mad L's
My voice excels from the avenue to jail cells
Oh my god, I'm dropping shit like a pigeon
I hope you're listenin', smackin' babies at their Christenin'
[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Yeah, where the motherfuckin thugs at?
Throw up your motherfuckin middle finger
We gonna do this shit like this
I thank the lord for my many blessings, though I'm stressin
Keep a vest for protection, from the barrel of a Smith & Wesson
And all my niggas in the pen, here we go again
Ain't nothing separating us but my MAC-10
Born in the ghetto as a hustler, older
A straight soldier, buckin at the bustas
No matter how you try, niggas never die
We just retaliate with hate, then we multiply
You see me striking down the block, hitting corners
Mobbing like a motherfucker, living like I wanna
And ain't no stopping at the red lights, I'm sideways
Thug life, motherfucker crime pays
Let the cops put their lights on: chase me nigga!
Zig zaggin' through the freeway: race me nigga!
In a high speed chase with the law
The realest motherfucker that you ever saw

[Verse 4: Shyheim]
Yo, this goes out to everybody from Staten Island
(Ah Mister Cee, and you don't stop)
Yo, times is getting hard, word is bond, I swear to God
I even got caught trying to steal from the junkyard
A born terror, a rebel without a pause
I never had a good Christmas, so who is Santa Claus
I walk the streets at night with my head down
In this lil town you see clowns that wanna be down
So they get a Glock and lick shots to get props
And when shit rocks all you can hear when the shells drop
An old man got shot in the parking lot
In front of my building I hang with his grandchildren
And for the nigga that pulled the trigger then tried to slide
And hide, but he got knocked by the homicide
And this happens everyday around my way
So I pray that I can live another day
[Kane] This how we gonna do it, hold up Cee, aiyyo, let's try this
[Shy] Staten Island in the motherfuckin house!
Wassup, Wu-Tang Clan in here or what?

[Verse 5: Big Daddy Kane]
Now what's the bullshit niggas been saying
Dont try to act like Martin now with that ""I was just playin!""
No need to grieve for more, now that the beef is on
Uhh!! Oh yeah motherfucker, your teeth is gone
Just cause you rap don't meant that you're catching wreck with me
Step to this I'll give your mic a vasectomy
I only know one nigga that can come next to me
No, that's a tattle, cause I can't count my own shadow
A battle, I gots to have it, 'lest you're gonna rob me
Like they did, Whittaker when he fought Chavez
Cause when it comes to going against Kane rappin
That's like a pimp trying to pull a nun, ain't nothing happenin
Non-resistible, non compatible
I'm not saying I'm the best, I'm just saying I'm fuckin incredible
And let's just get one more thing understood
If I fart on a record, trust me nigga, that shit gon' sound good"
Starving Artist,Adam WarRock,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","Cause every man's gotta do that thing to eat
Before he finds himself face down, passed out in the street
But I ain't down for this industry
9 to 5 to stay alive even though it's killing me

And I'm hungry for the limelight
Hungry for the high life, thirsty for the fine wine
And I'm hungry for that microphone
Hungry for the live shows
Thirsty at the finish line

Starving artists follow your heart
I know sometimes getting started's like
The hardest part
But I'll die starving to follow this mark
And I'm going hungry

Now tell me why you would ever want
To live a life where all you're doing
Is passing time until you die?
And if I struggle, then I struggle for
The things that I'm trying to accomplish
Before the finish line. Yeah
I know you feel like every chance that
You ever had to do the things you love
Is all gone without a trace
But it's the echoes of the past
And the happier times you had
Trying to escape show in lines
Across your face. And I trace em together
Your face a constellation
Drawn every morning through the steam
After my shower's done
And there's some major to minor
Instead I'm sick of waiting
Pointing straight to the sun
I'll show you how it's done
And I'm trying hard to reach you
Blowing through your speakers
Trying to get inside your mind
And I'm dying just to break through
Still I gotta eat, too
Still I gotta get by

And if I shine, then you shine right back
And we all in this together
If you feeling life is still a dream
And me? I'm floating down the river
And I ain't looking back!
While I see packs of rats
Trying to swim upstream
Mind is much clearer, life is so realer
Wine is much sweeter
Pancakes with the syrup!
Cause one day, none of this will every matter
In the long run
DJ in Heaven keeping track of
How many times your song's spun
But in a moment it's history we create
With misery we replace so to
Busy us in our day. And still you just
Can't mistake the way that it feels to say
""I love this song"" and watching the grin
Spread on our face. Yeah!
That's that shit that's worth living for
Adam got a sicker flow
Similar to the kitchen though
Sometimes I swear, it's like I feel
I'm on a mission, so had to break out
In flight because I feel like I'm in a prison, yo
And life is nothing perfect, present tense
Cause art is Heaven sent. I went from lawyer
To being my own employer, man
That's why I need to pedal wares and sell my
Single. So please excuse the shameless self-promotion
Over strings and snares. Yeah
You can give to your heart's content
I'm simply without repentance
I'm needing like every cent
I need it to pay the rent
I need it for live events
I need it to pay the bills
For the money already spent"

Where you from? Turn around; who you came with?

I'm still a sucker for cornrows, you know I never changed that
Your body is banging mama, but where your brains at?
I'm still the same cat when I was younger running with bad boys

Here come another man, unlike no other man

The only reason they listenin' when ya talkin'
Waiting on ya to contradict yaself

When Tami got David kicked out
Suckers tryin' figure my angle
Puzzled by my shuffle icky wood in the bengals
Adjust my wing rudders in the prescence of danger
Drop bombs on them niggas from the middle
And stay calm knowin' we belong on the top
But we ain't trippin'
Cause we'll get there in a minute

Turn over, make ya give the ball up
They just wanna see ya fuck it all up

(Yeah)
Vintage egg chairs hangin' from the ceilin'
Naked beauties and plush pillows in em
Incense and fresh linen
I spit that complex venom
The real niggas it strengthens
The fake niggas it kills them
And the Big homie said
That he still got visions of the rooftop
As do I
George Jetson, Jefferson
Deluxe apartment in the sky
Niggas can't downplay me baby
I'm too high
Pilots speak I crafted these in my Impala seat
A New Orleans nigga
And I'm way in the NYC weed twistin'
On a mission and I'm fishin' for my nigga Ski Beatz
I been in the game, OG
Seen fools blow up
And blow it low key

Yeah, life under the scope

Turn over, make ya give the ball up

Me So Horny,2 Live Crew,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz']","[Intro]
""What'll we get for 10 dollars?""
""Every 'ting you want""
""Everything?""
""Every 'ting..""

[Chorus: Papillon Soo Soo]
Ahh! Me so horny!
Me love you long time!

[Verse 1: Brother Marquis]
Sitting at home with my dick all hard
So I got the black book for a freak to call
Picked up the telephone, then dialed the 7 digits
Said, ""Yo, this Marquis, baby! Are you down with it?""
I arrived at her house, knocked on the door
Not having no idea of what the night had in store
I'm like a dog in heat, a freak without warning
I have an appetite for sex, cause me so horny

[Chorus: Papillon Soo Soo]
Ahh! Me so horny!
Me love you long time!
[Verse 2: Fresh Kid Ice]
Girls always ask me why I fuck so much
I say ""What's wrong, baby doll, with a quick nut?""
Cause you're the one, and you shouldn't be mad
I won't tell your mama if you don't tell your dad
I know he'll be disgusted when he sees your pussy busted
Won't your mama be so mad if she knew I got that ass?
I'm a freak in heat, a dog without warning
My appetite is sex, cause me so horny

[Chorus: Papillon Soo Soo]
Ahh! Me so horny!
Me love you long time!

[Verse 3: Brother Marquis]
You can say I'm desperate, even call me perverted
But you say I'm a dog when I leave you fucked and deserted
I'll play with your heart just like it's a game
I'll be blowing your mind while you're blowing my brains
I'm just like that man they call Georgie Puddin' Pie
I fuck all the girls and I make 'em cry
I'm like a dog in heat, a freak without warning
I have an appetite for sex, cause me so horny

[Chorus: Papillon Soo Soo]
Ahh! Me so horny!
Me love you long time!
[Verse 4: Fresh Kid Ice]
It's true, you were a virgin until you met me
I was the first to make you hot and wetty-wetty
You tell your parents that we're going out
Never to the movies, just straight to my house
You said it yourself, you like it like I do
Put your lips on my dick, and suck my asshole too
I'm a freak in heat, a dog without warning
My appetite is sex, cause me so horny

[Chorus]
Ahh! Me so horny!
Me love you long time!

Finish Line,Lloyd Banks,['hip hop'],"[Verse]
Under dog is cool, I’m used to being overlooked
Look at me now I’m filled with style, my blunt is rolled with Kush
Look bitch I’m ballin, ballin’
Chasin’ K’s like Reggie Bush
My haters hatin’ don’t know how inside the Bentley look
Five in the mornin’ recording
You think I slept all day
But I really ain't slept at all
I got bills that’s due, need checks today
Southside don’t play
Play around if you want, be another black body dumped
Duck down when you hear the sound
They got peace out here, but not the kind you want
Nigga R.I.P, march throught the club with no I.D
Make sure they put the pretty bitches round me
Tables of Bub’ and it’s all on me
Hoes show love in the V.I.P
Think about bread when you think about P
What I done did and how I OD
Chick ain't a muthaf-cking thing here free
Touch nothing you see
I ex’ing off the hoes quick as they come
Drinkin' heavy rollin’ up like I got an extra lung
Singin' Bentley, sippin’ harley pardon what I’ve become
Leakin’ bezey, reaper fetti, product of mama slum
These niggas ain't never did shit for me when I was starvin’ son
Just me against them, you remember that?
Thought you’d be glad, but you plottin' on when I’m endin' at
I don’t see no kind of friend in that
Fuck 'em all, go spend a stack
Yapping like a bitch don’t get more friend than that
This that no pretending rap
Y’all know how my engine at
Nine in front two ten’s in back
Running with that stack in his back
One in yo ad
I know I’m watched by an angel
Still feel her hugs and her kisses
On the phone with my grandma
Don’t give a fuck bout these bitches
Dont give a fuck bout they trophies
Or anything that they might owe me
I do this for you (you, you)
The only ones that really know me
Only ones that ain't disown me
I remember everything they said
Said I was dead, deaded all that
Sledgehammer right on your head
Live for the now, soo-woo to gone
Sucka niggas left red
No time for waiting rather get mine instead
[Hook]
I gettin’ money on a dime
Girl it’s my time
Go get that Love shit out your mind
You living blind
Can’t go for that will fall behind
I’m on the grind
Im hittin ‘em two at a time
Why would I decline
See you at the finish line

The Breaks,Kurtis Blow,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative']","[Intro]
Clap your hands everybody
If you got what it takes
'Cause I'm Kurtis Blow and I want you to know
That these are the breaks

[Hook 1]
Brakes on a bus, brakes on a car
Breaks to make you a superstar
Breaks to win and breaks to lose
But these here breaks will rock your shoes
And these are the breaks
Break it up, break it up, break it up!

[Verse 1]
If your woman steps out with another man
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
And she runs off with him to Japan
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
And the IRS says they want to chat
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
And you can't explain why you claimed your cat
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
And Ma Bell sends you a whopping bill
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
With 18 phone calls to Brazil
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
And you borrowed money from the mob
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
And yesterday you lost your job
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
Well, these are the breaks
Break it up, break it up, break it up
[Bridge 1]
Throw your hands up in the sky
And wave 'em round from side to side
And if you deserve a break tonight
Somebody say alright! (All right)
Say ho-oo! (Ho-oo!)
You don't stop
Keep on, somebody scream! (Owwwww!)
Break down!

[Hook 2]
Breaks on a stage, breaks on a screen
Breaks to make your wallet lean
Breaks run cold and breaks run hot
Some folks got 'em and some have not
But these are the breaks
Break it up, break it up, break it up
Break down!

[Bridge 2]
To the girl in brown, stop messing around
(Break it up, break it up!)
To the guy in blue, whatcha gonna do?
(Break it up, break it up!)
And to the girl in green, don't be so mean
(Break it up, break it up!)
And the guy in red, say what I said
(Break it up, break it up!)
Break down!
[Hook 3]
Brakes on a plane, brakes on a train
Breaks to make you go insane
Breaks in love, breaks in war
But we got the breaks to get you on the floor
And these are the breaks
Break it up, break it up, break it up
Break down! Yo!

[Interlude]
Just do it, just do it, just do it, do it, do it!
Just do it, just do it, just do it, do it, do it!
Just do it, just do it, just do it, do it, do it!
Just do it, just do it, just do it, do it, do it!

[Verse 2]
You say last week you met the perfect guy
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
And he promised you the stars in the sky
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
He said his Cadillac was gold
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
But he didn't say it was 10 years old
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
He took you out to the Red Coach grill
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
But he forgot the cash and you paid the bill
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
And he told you the story of his life
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
But he forgot the part about...his wife! Huh! Huh!
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
Well, these are the breaks!
Break it up, break it up, break it up!

If I Ruled the World Imagine That,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","[Produced by Rashad Smith & Trackmasters]

[Intro: Nas]
Life, I wonder
Will it take me under?
I don't know

[Verse 1: Nas]
Imagine smoking weed in the street without cops harassing
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle, cruising blue Bahama waters, no welfare supporters
More conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot, my son got knocked, evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage
We'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashing fashion, designer clothes
Lacing your clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers
Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""
[Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Verse 2: Nas]
The way to be: Paradise life, relaxin'
Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon
Armani Exchange, the Range
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in a iller path
The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better living, type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies, history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controlling, clique rolling
Tricking six digits on kicks and still holding
Trips to Paris, I'd civilize every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoners set free, stress free
No work release, purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I'd let Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities
And reverse fiends to Willies
It sound foul, but every girl I meet'd go down-town
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa
[Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Bridge: Lauryn Hill]
And then we'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land
We'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

[Verse 3: Nas]
You love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Ducked down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down outta state
Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
‘Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still, nobody want a nigga having shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I push a Q-45 Infinit(i)
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felony
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see, but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?

If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons,I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls

If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)
If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled
I love 'em, love 'em baby
Black diamonds and pearls, black diamonds, black diamonds
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine)
If I ruled the world

If I ruled the world
I'd love all the girls
Wear diamonds and pearls
If I ruled the world

[Verse 1]
If I ruled the world, was king on the throne
I'd make peace in every culture, build the homeless a home
I'm not running for Congress or the President
I'm just here, to tell the world, how my story went
You see - first it was a dream, I was living in Rome
And then I moved to London, bought a brand new home
And everywhere I went, I drew lots of attention
Like a stretch limousine, one of those new inventions
It took a few years 'fore the day had come
But I was ruler of the world ranked #1
So I headed towards Washington to claim the crown
Let the whole world know that the King was in town
As I arrived the crowd started to cheer
And then someone yelled out, ""The King is here!""
So I headed toward stage to make a speech
About the new style of living I was gonna teach, uh-huh

If I ruled the world (huh huh, huh huh huh)
I'd love all the girls  (I'd love em love em baby!)
Wear diamonds and pearls
If I ruled the world

[Verse 2]
People started flowing as they reached for my hand
I said, ""Thank you for bringing me to the Promised Land
But now I must go, so goodbye to everybody
Tonight I'll see you all at my Super Dinner Party""
And late that night, at my Super Dinner Party
I was dancing to the beat and entertaining: ""La-Di-Da-Di""
The music started ending, it was time for a speech
The crowd started sitting as I rose from my feet
And this was once a dream; I explained to the crowd
But now, I rule the world, and I feel, so very proud
Excuse me please for stopping this show
I just had to thank you all, huh, and me so
My first day in office, the King on the throne
I spent my first three hours on the telephone
You know with newsmen reporters, and voters too
I had so many calls, I didn't know what to do
You know hours passed I continued to work
I signed so many papers, my fingers started to hurt
Then I shook off the pain, say this ain't no thing
'Cause there's nothing in the world like being #1 king!
[Hook]
If I ruled the world (huh huh, huh huh huh)
I'd love all the girls  (I'd love em love em baby!)
Wear diamonds and pearls (oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
If I ruled the world (whoa whoa yeahhhhh)

{AJ Scratch cuts up the track for a bit}

[Verse 3]
Now I rule the world and now, I'm on top
And I'm rolling with folks that could never be stopped
And I'm here to let you know this is where I belong
And to you sucker MC's that sing my song
And it's a song that's strong about right and wrong
And I'ma rock it to you baby baby all night long
And it's a song about love and happiness
In a world of peace and you know that's fresh
Now I'm the king and I want you to know
That I'm the Master Blaster Rapper who's running the show
And to all of you rappers in every country
You better stop what you're doing and listen to me
'Cause we gotta stop war and use unity
To fight crime and hunger and poverty
'Cause the African baby is dying overseas
While you sucker mission politicians busting out Z's
Huh, 20 million people all unemployed
While the rich man try to play Pretty Boy Floyd
While the working class just struggles hard
Try to make ends meet against all odds
While the poor man can't even deal with life
You know he tried to escape, and smoked the coke on the pipe
And it's time for a CHANGE, to a better way
'Cause the sun has GOTTA shine through the cloudy day
So LISTEN UP world while I teach this class
And take heed to the message or we ain't gonna last
'Cause I know, the solution, is the contribution
Of woman and man to just join the revolution
That'll take your brain to a higher plane
And help you deal in a world that's gone insane
With the problems that I know we can stop
From the ruler of the world and the man on top
But the years went by, and time was up
And then the ruler of the world had ran out of luck
And all the people at the time who said they were my friends
Didn't know me when my job had come to an end
The King who took my place was happy as can be
He was running his mouth like, Muhammad Ali
So I shook his hand calmly as I headed to the door
On my way to the ghetto to treat once more
[Hook]
If I ruled the world (huh huh, huh huh huh)
I'd love all the girls  (I'd love em love em baby!)
Wear diamonds and pearls (oh yeah yeah)
If I ruled the world (yeahhhhh)

[Hook]
If I ruled the world (if I ruled the world)
I'd love all the girls  (I'd love em love em baby!)
Wear diamonds and pearls (oh yeah yeah oh yeah yeah)
If I ruled the world (whoa whoa yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)"
White Girls,Mighty Casey,['hip hop'],"[Hook: Mighty Casey]
White girls, (Suzy, Jen, and Karen)
Going through my mind, (Sarah, Jesse and Julie, too)
White girls, (Judy, Beth, and Sharon)
Help me unwind (The more I see the more I do)
Don't tell Minister Farrakhan (That's right)
He don't wanna know what's going on (Ok)
Cause white girls won't go away

[Verse 1]
Ticket to ride, white girl highway
Tell all the white girls they can swing my way
What up baby girl how ya doing is you single?
Have you ever messed with a light-skinned Mandingo?
And I can give damn, what all my friends say to me
You and me baby can start making up for slavery
Girl I'm just playing I got a white mom
You got any black in you (no), would you like some?
O' word, you like my songs that be playin on the radio
You know the sincerest form of flattery is fellatio
I ain't a pickie guy so I really don't care
If you're a hippie white chick that got under arm hair
Or a ghetto white chick who be trying to act black
With your name on your chain and her hair slicked back
You can be anywhere Maine down to Malibu
From a trailer park or the way to Park Avenue
See me with a black girl you not gon' comment
Or it might just been a white girl with a tan
And sista's don't get mad cause I'm out bangin white chicks
Cause we all look tha same when we turn off the light switch
See back in the day I was getting no play
Then I went the white girl way like OJ
So you can call on Kato, but I'm sorry OJ
Cause I got my white girl and everything is ok
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I've had rich ones, poor ones, I've even had some famous ones
Like Tracy Lawerence, Houston, and Jenna Jameson
Right about now I'm on probation for three years
Cause I caught a stat case for having sex with
Britney Spears
Got head in her dressing room I busted on her chin
Oops, I did it again: Gwyneth Paltrow
Always saying I be making her laugh, she gave me head
Cause If I hit it I would break her in half
She ain't even the only white actress on my mattress
I even had sex with that fat chick from ""The Pratice""
And Katie Holmes always trying to take me home
Calling me on the phone saying, 'Casey make me moan'
Smoking weed on the jets again, on a higher plane
Hate country music, wanna bang Shania Twain
Whether short or tall, whether blonde or brunette
I ain't met a white girl that I wouldn't do yet
And I got ""Alyssa Milano"" hitting high notes like sopranos
When we all up in my bedroom making some 'milanoes'
I really don't think there a girl that I missed
I used to like Mariah till I learned she was mixed
For those who getting furious please don't take me serious
I'm just wildin' out like ""Eddie Murphy"" in ""Delirous""
But if you took offense and you black or you white
I glad you did sucka cause you way too up tight"
White Lines Dont Do It,Grandmaster Melle Mel,['hip hop'],"[Chorus]
(White Lines) Visions, dreams of passion
(Blowing through my mind) And all the while I think of you
(High price) A very strange reaction
(For us to unwind) The more I see, the more I do
(Something like a phenomenon) Baby!
(Telling your body to come along, but white lines blow away)
(Blow! Rock it! Blow!)

[Verse 1]
Ticket to ride, white line highway
Tell all your friends, they can go my way
Pay your toll, sell your soul
Pound-for-pound costs more than gold
The longer you stay, the more you pay
My white lines, go a long way
Either up your nose or through your vein
With nothing to gain except killing your brain

[Chorus]
(Freeze! Rock! Freeze! Rock! Freeze! Rock! Freeze! Rock! Blow!)
Higher, baby
Get higher, baby!
Get higher, baby!
And don't ever come down! (Freebase!)

Rang dang diggedy dang di-dang
Diggedy dang di-dang diggedy dang di-dang

(Pipeline) pure as the driven snow
(Connected to my mind) and now I'm having fun, baby!
(High price) it's getting kinda low
('Cause it makes you feel so nice) I need some one-on-one, baby!
(Don't let it blow your mind away) Baby!
(And go into your little hideaway ‘cause white lines blow away)
(Blow! Rock it! Blow!)

[Verse 2]
A million magic crystals, painted pure and white
A multi-million dollars almost overnight
Twice as sweet as sugar
Twice as bitter as salt
And if you get hooked, baby
It's nobody else's fault, so don't do it!

[Chorus]
(Freeze! Rock! Freeze! Rock! Freeze! Rock! Freeze! Rock!)
(Ahhh) Higher, baby
(Ahhh) Get higher, baby!
(Ahhh) Get higher, baby!
And don't ever come down! (Freebase!)

(Don’t you get too high) don’t you get too high baby!
(Turns you on) you really turn me on and on
('Cause you gotta come down) my temperature is risin’
(When the thrill is gone) no, I don’t want you to go

[Verse 3]
A street kid gets arrested, gonna do some time
He got out three years from now just to commit more crime
A businessman is caught with 24 kilos
He’s out on bail and out of jail
And that’s the way it goes, raah!

(Cane! Sugar! Cane! Sugar! Cane!)

Athletes rejected, governors corrected
Gangsters, thugs and smugglers are thoroughly respected
The money gets divided
The women get excited
Now I’m broke and it’s no joke
It’s hard as hell to fight it, don’t buy it!
[Chorus]

Little Jack Horner sitting on the corner
With no shoes and clothes
This ain't funny, but he took his money
And sniffed it up his nose

(Hey man, you wanna cop some blow?)
(Sure, what you got, dust, flakes or rocks?)
(I got China White, Mother of Pearl, Ivory Flake, What you need?)
(Well yeah, well let me check it out man, just let me get a freeze)
(Go ahead man, stuff I got should kill ya!)
(Yeah man th-that’s that’s raw, woah..)"
Aint No Half-Steppin,Big Daddy Kane,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Aw yeah, I'm with this
I'm just gonna sit here laid back to this nice mellow beat, you know
And drop some smooth lyrics 'cause it's '88
Time to set it straight, know what I'm sayin'?
And ain't no half-steppin'
Word, I'm ready

[Verse 1]
Rappers steppin' to me, they want to get some
But I'm the Kane, so, yo, you know the outcome
Another victory, they can't get with me
So pick a B.C. date 'cause you're history
I'm the authentic poet to get lyrical
For you to beat me, it's gonna take a miracle
And steppin' to me — yo, that's the wrong move
So what you on, Hobbs; dope or dog food?
Competition, I just devour
Like a pit bull against a Chihuahua
'Cause when it comes to bein' dope, hot damn
I got it good, now let me tell you who I am
The B-I-G D-A-double-D-Y K-A-N-E
Dramatic, Asiatic, not like many
I'm different, so don't compare me to another
'Cause they can't hang, word to the mother
At least not with the principal in this pedigree
So when I roll on you rappers, you better be
Ready to die because you're petty
You're just a butter knife, I'm a machete
That's made by Ginsu, wait until when you
Try to front, so I can chop into
Your body, just because you tried to be basin'
Friday the 13th, I'ma play Jason
No type of joke, gag, game, puzzle or riddle
The name is Big Daddy, yes, Big, not little
So define it, here's your walkin' papers, sign it
And take a walk as the Kane starts to talk, 'cause ...
[Hook]
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
""Down the road""

[Verse 2]
My rhymes are so dope and the rappers be hopin'
To sound like me, so soon, I'll have to open
A school of emceein', for those who wanna be in
My field and court, then again, on second thought
To have MC's comin' out soundin' so similar
It's quite confusin' for you to remember the
Originator and boy, do I hate a
Perpetrator, but I'm much greater
The best, oh, yes, I guess, suggest the rest
Should fess, don't mess or test your highness
Unless you just address with best finesse
And bless the paragraphs I manifest
Rap prime minister, some say sinister
Non-stoppin' the groove until when it's
The climax and I max, relax and chill
Have a break from a take of me actin' ill
Brain cells are lit, ideas start to hit
Next the formation of words that fit
At the table I sit, makin' it legit
And when my pen hits the paper, aw shit!
I stop and stand strong over MC's
And devour with the power of Hercules
Or Samson, but I go further the length
'Cause you could scalp my Cameo and I'll still have strength
And no, that's not a myth and if you try to riff or get with
The man with the given gift of gab
Your vocab, I'll only ignore
Be sleepin' on your rhymes 'til I start to snore
You can't awake me, or even make me
Fear you, son, 'cause you can't do me none
So, think about it if you're tryna go
When you wanna step to me, I think you should know that
[Hook]
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
""Down the road""

[Verse 3]
I appear right here and scare and dare
A mere musketeer that would dare to compare, put him in the rear
Back there where he can't see clear
Get a beer, idea or near stare, yeah
So on to the wannabe competition
Tryin' to step to me, must be on a mission
Up on the stage is where I'ma get you at
You think I'm losin'? Pfft, picture that

[Hook]
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Mister Cee, step to me
[Verse 4]
The name is Big Daddy, you know, as in your father
So when you hear a def rhyme, believe that I'm the author
I grab the mic and make MC's evaporate
The party people say, 'Damn, that rapper's great'
The creator, conductor of poetry
Et cetera, et cetera, it ain't easy bein' me
I speak clearly so you can understand
Put words together like Letter Man
Now that's dictation, proceedin' to my innovation
Not like the other MC's that are an imitation
Or an animation, a cartoon to me
But when I'm finished, I'm sure that you are soon to see
Reality, my secret technique
Because I always speak with mentality
I put my title in your face, dare you to base
And if you try and come get it, yo, I'ma show you who's with it
So if you know like I know, instead of messin' around
Play like Roy Rogers and slow down
Just give yourself a break, or someone else will take your title
Namely me because I'm homicidal
That means murder, yes, I'm out to hurt a-
-nother MC that try to get with me
I'll just break him and bake him and rake him and take him
And mold him and make him hold up the peace sign

She's just so black!""

[Verse 1: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face, you get sprung
Wanna pull up tough 'cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearin'
I'm hooked and I can't stop starin'
Oh, baby, I wanna get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But that butt you got makes (me so horny!)
Oh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you wanna get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me

I've seen 'em dancin'

And tell you that the butt ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that!
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' 'bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines:
You ain't it, Miss Thing!
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her

I met her on Monday and fucked her all week
'Cause every time she leave, she come back to the tree
She know I love brain so I treat her like a geek
She love the way I spit, so I made the pussy gleek
Wild'n' with my niggas, and I don’t give a fuck
So I circle the bitches, we rounding 'em up
I treat her like I need her, I'm knowing if I eat her
She gon' tell Quita, and Quita like the media
""Woopty-woop"" to the Bloods
Her lipstick match my flag—that's swag
Weezy F. Baby got nuts that drag
I put 'em in your mouth 'til you choke and gag

Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Chi-Town girl (What?), bag match her heels
Her ass hella fake, but it feel real (Ha!)
And it felt great when we had sex
I tore her out the frame, like pics of my ex
From my aspect, I love your assets (Ha)
I love your mini-skirt (Why?) It's easy access
Pipe game never mediocre
So that relationship is over once I poke her
She said she wanted a tour of the tour bus (""So what you do?"")
So I gave her a tour of the tour bus (""Who was there?"")
It was all us on the tour bus (Ha!)
And she did all us (""Where?"") On the tour bus, like...

Africa Must Wake Up,Nas & Damian Marley,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'blues', 'alternative', 'rock']","[Hook: Damian Marley]
Africa must wake up, the sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring, may a better day come
Yesterday we were kings, can you tell me young ones
Who are we today? yeah, now

[Verse 1: Nas, Damian Marley]
The black oasis, Ancient Africa the sacred
Awaking, the sleeping giant, science, art is your creation
I dreamed that we could visit old Kemet
Your history is too complex and rigid for some Western critics
They want the whole subject diminished
But Africa's the origin of all the world's religions
We praise bridges that carried us over
The battle fronts of Sudanic soldiers
The task put before us, do you hear me now?

[Hook: Damian Marley]
Africa must wake up, the sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring, may a better day come
Yesterday we were kings, can you tell me young ones
Who are we today? yeah, now
Africa must wake up, the sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring, may a better day come
Yesterday we were kings, can you tell me young ones
Who are we today?
[Verse 2: Nas]
Who are we today? The slums, diseases, AIDS
We need that all to fade, we cannot be afraid
So who are we today?
We are the morning after, the makeshift youth
The slave ship captured, our diaspora is the final chapter
The ancestral lineage built pyramids
America's first immigrants
The kings, sons and daughters from Nile waters
The first architect, the first philosophers
Astronomers, the first prophets and the doctors were us, us

[Bridge: Damian Marley]
Now can we all pray? Each in his own way
Teaching and learning, we can work it out
We'll have a warm bed, we'll have some warm bread
Shelter from the storm dread and we can work it out
Mother nature feeds all in famine and drought
Tell those selfish in ways, not to share us out
What's a tree without root? Lion without tooth?
A lie without truth? You hear me out!

[Hook: Damian Marley]
Africa must wake up, the sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring, may a better day come
Yesterday we were kings, can you tell me young ones
Who are we today? yeah, Lord
Africa must wake up the sleeping sons of Jacob
What tomorrow may bring. may some more love come
Yesterday we were kings, I tell ya young bloods
The world is yours today...

Distant Relatives
We're all distant relatives
No matter where you from, where you live
How near or far
Africa, China, Japan, Afghanistan, Israel
We're all fam, we're all distant relatives
So that's why we came together
One of the reasons why myself and Damian came together
'Cause we all come from one place, and that's Africa
That's right, you too
And you
The whole world!
We're all family, we're just spread out all over the place
So to all my distant relatives, let's take it back home!

Ce que vous avez sous les yeux, ce sont les pensées intimes de plusieurs personnalités différentes. Si vous me permettez, quelques explications… merci”

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
I lick a shot in the sky
A war don, you're gone cousin, Optimus Prime
You a bitch, one of 700 Solomon's wives
I was in Constantinople during Ottoman's shine
My Glock is a nine
My thirty-eight Wesson a beautiful bitch
You rhyme like a ho, find a more suitable pitch
You bout to find out why German Lugers exist
Dig a hole, bury yourself, beautiful ditch
It ain't a single man living could fuck with the beast
Gay rapper, altar boy you fuckin' a priest
Fuck a cop, dirty pig we buckin' police
Dirt bag can't make money, he stuck in the streets

[Verse 2: Planetary]
What you think? I'm sittin' in this cage for nothing?
If they release me it's curtains, that's why I live in the dungeon
All black nothin' lit up, I set up walls
And hang body's that I hit up, can't fit us all
Warchild got machetes with old blood on the tip
Paz sittin' with artillery to blow you to bits
Shit, King Syze with the getaway
All black UConn, shoes on everyday
Gun play nowadays more frequent
More real niggas mad fallin' off the deep end
And your life depends on me
I ice out the whole joint and put your men on freeze
[Hook: Planetary]
You can start a riot in here, now who's wit me?
Who the fuck gon' ride when this shit get shifty?
Where my niggas at? I know who ride wit me
This Pharaohs shit fo' life, they gon' die right with me

[Verse 3: Celph Titled]
Spur of the moment I could strike with a strategic blow
I hold the heaters low and ground you up inside a pita roll
Explosive botanist, obvious that I plant bombs
I stand out in crowds like I got fluorescent pants on
Satanic candles lit in my recording room
I'm makin' hits, singing songs of death in Autotune
Put a bear-trap on ya ankle
Drop you off at Foot-Locker
Mug the manager like, ""What the fucks poppin'?!""
Punks drop it, while I stand tall
You see me, you seen the greatest rapper, modern man's saw
Electric meat-shaver that's a modern man's saw
Precision chop limbs after I body slam y'all

[Verse 4: Apathy]
Hand saw, body chopper
Bloody opera singer, Satan's trigger finger
Rock the bells in Hell, call me a dead ringer
Freddy Krueger sweater, rock a Beretta cocker
I'll dead a copper, head to Czechoslovakia 'fore they spot me
On security cams
My maturity shows
When I take these young rappers and I murder they flows
Including Weezy's and Jeezy's, if I had a genie
I'd make major label rappers Ice Cube's and Eazy's
Monster with the frees when I'm conquering MCs
I be airin' rappers out, like I'm sponsored by Febreze
If you stop to get some Z's
I just haunt you in your dreams
Smuggle yay from Medellin and vacation in Belize
Please believe me

Obie, yo
I'm sick
Damn, you straight, dog?

[Chorus: Eminem & Obie Trice]
That's why I ain't got no time (I think I got chlamydia)
For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches (Bitch!) on my dick
That's how dudes be gettin' sick (That bitch!)
That's how dicks be gettin' drips
Fallin' victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fuckin' chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

[Verse 1: Obie]
Yo, I woke up, fucked up off the liquor I drunk (Damn!)
I had a bag of the skunk, won in last night's tunk
Pussy residue was on my penis, Denise from the cleaner's
Fucked me good, you shoulda seen this
Big booty bitch, switch unbearable (Shit!)
French roll stylin', body like a stallion
Sizin' up the figure, while my shit gettin' bigger
Debatin' on a fuck or do I wanna be her nigga?
Caressin' this bitch, plus I'm checkin' out them tits (Damn!)
Sippin' on that fine shit, I ain't used to buyin'
I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory
Like takin' hoes' money, but that's another story
For surely pussy on toast, after we toast
Her clothes fell like Bishop in Juice (C'mere)
The womb beater, clean pussy eater, insertin' my jock
In that spot hotter than the hottest block
""Don't stop!""—response I got when I was knockin' it
Clock's steady tickin', kinky finger-lickin'
And can on, semen's at my tip when she moans
I gotta slow down before I cum soon
And work that nigga like a slave owner (Yeah)
When I dropped off my outfit, she knew I wanted to bone her
She foamin' at them lips, the ones between the hips
Pubic hair's lookin' like some sour cream dip
Without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though
Pussy tighter than conditions of us black folks
We in the final stretch (C'mere), the last part of sex
I bust a fat-ass nut, then I woke up next (Holy)
Like, what the fuck is goin' on here? (Shit!) This bitch evaporated
Pussy and all just picked up and vacated
And now I'm frustrated, 'cause my dick was unprotected (Damn!)
And doctor Wesley tellin' me I really got that shit (Fuck!)
[Chorus: Eminem]
That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be gettin' sick
That's how dicks be gettin' drips
Fallin' victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fuckin' chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now I don't wanna hit no woman, but this chick's got it comin'
Someone better get this bitch 'fore she gets kicked in the stomach
And she's pregnant, but she's eggin' me on, beggin' me to throw her
Off the steps of this porch, my only weapon is force
And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
Though what's she shovin' me for? (Bitch!) Doesn't she love me no more?
Wasn't she huggin' me four minutes ago at the door?
Man, I'm this close to goin' toe-to-toe with this whore
What would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce?
She's havin' another baby in a month, and it's yours
And you found out it isn't, 'cause this bitch has been visitin' someone else
And suckin' his dick and kissin' you on the lips when you get back to Michigan
Now the plot is thickenin' worse
‘Cause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a hearse
So you're paranoid at every little cold that you get
Ever since they sold you this shit, you've been holdin' your dick
So you go to the clinic, sweatin' every minute you in it
Then the doctor comes out, lookin' like Dennis the Menace (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby it's AIDS (Sorry)
He ain't even gotta call you in his office to say it (Sorry)
So you jet back home, 'cause you gon' get that ho
When you see her, you gon' bend her fuckin' neck back, yo
'Cause you love her, you never would expect that blow
Obie told you the scoop, how could she stoop that low?
Jesus, I don't believe this bitch works at the cleaner's
Bringin' me home diseases, swingin' from Obie's penis
She's so deceivin', shit, this ho's a genius, she G'd us
[Chorus: Eminem]
That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be gettin' sick
That's how dicks be gettin' drips
Fallin' victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fuckin' chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

We can fight our desires
But when we start making fires
We get ever so hot
Whether we like it or not
They say we can love who we trust
But what is love without lust
Two hearts with accurate devotions
And what are feelings without emotions?

[Refrain: La Roux]
I’m going in for the kill
I’m doing it for a thrill
Oh I’m hoping you’ll understand
And not let go of my hand

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I’m going in and I’ma go hard
I mean what's the point if it ain't no scars
A little teeth marks
Blood on the collar
That's real love, mmhmm ahhnah
She said uh
How could you love someone that hurt you, played you, spoke to provoke you
How could you love someone that burns you, turns you into a werewolf
And in the moment you might do some things you’re not aware of
No one’s prepared for the scale of this, and now you fear love
And war and war and more and more drama looking for a score
State you’re looking for a tour
Her allure is more couture, tailor-made
'Til your screams in rage
I mean ahhhhh I'm breaking out the damn cage, aghh
Hannibal Lector, my A-merican Psycho
A iller version of Ike, yo
The Thriller version of Michael
My recital is as bright as the light show up at the Eiffel
A werewolf up in Paris, I'm livin' off your vitals
I mean, I’ll be your con man, I’ll be your damn liar
Let's start the interview, I’ll be your vampire
I gotta feel you, bite your neck to get familiar
And if you die, guess what, I fuckin' killed you
[Refrain: La Roux]
I’m going in for the kill
I’m doing it for a thrill
Oh I’m hoping you’ll understand
And not let go of my hand

[Verse 3: La Roux]
Let’s go to war
To make peace
Let’s be cold
To create heat
I hope in darkness
We can see
And you’re not blinded by the light from me

[Refrain: La Roux]
I’m going in for the kill
I’m doing it for a thrill
Oh I’m hoping you’ll understand
And not let go of my hand"
Andak Andak,Rumi,['country'],"TRANSLATION:

Bit-by-bit, bit-by-bit, the drunk masses arrive
Little-by-little, the wine-worshipers wine arrive

They are gently on their way
Like Zaran flowers from the garden

Little by little, from this world of dead and undead
The dead have gone and the living will be here soon

They come with hands full of gold and empty
They arrive both poor and hungry

The gaunt, exhausted from the trials of love
Arrive strong and healthy

Like the rays of the sun, the lives of the pure
They arrive from heights to valleys

The green and fresh garden of the pure
Arrive from drunken stupor
Their essence is grace
As the garden receives them

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
Ay, step up in the party and them bad bitches be on me
I be sipping on Patron when I'm jumping out Ferrari's
I be rocking Gucci, sometimes Louis, I'm retarded
And the rims by Asanti, but the shades by Bulgari
Hand on my scrap, I got my mind on my money
Plus if my mind on dine, he ain't taking nothing from me
Headed on this choppa tool, headed on this choppa tool
Got headed on a hundered round cause that's how much the choppa shoot
Ball-balling is my hobby, counting hundreds, going shopping
And a 5 star wit me and I met her in the lobby
Took her to the room, she hit me with that line
Said she ain't that type of girl, so I told her stop lyin'

Okay, I ain't gotta lie, cross my heart, hope to die
Them numbers don't lie, G5 over sky
I fucked her pussy good, make her cry if I tried
But I'm tired of being sick, and I'm sick of being tired
Tired of these niggas, and tired of these bitches
And shit, let them lie, long as they ain't snitching
And men lie about women and shit
Women lie about plenty (Women lie, men lie)
And they ain't lying on me
I'm in the bed with two fine bitches lying on me
So that would make three, and numbers don't lie
And money don't lie, and neither do I, bitch!

Women lie, men lie, women lie, men lie (Cause I'm the truth)
Women lie, men lie, numbers don't lie (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
I'm tryna count to a billion
My bitch, Brazilian
Hop in that Lamb', push the button, lose the ceiling
Sun out, no rain drops, posting the same spot
Right here in North, North Memphis where I came from
Hundred on the neck, I ain't never had shit
That the streets gave me family, Barry White cut the check
Ain't no secret in the streets, niggas know I got neck
Got the swagger through the roof, I was born just to flex
Zip code on my wrist, phone number in the bank
In my ten 'til six with my 305 paint
I got my 3-5-7 and my 501's
In a Lear 55 wit my Air Force Ones
No lie!

[Outro Hook: Female Vocals & Yo Gotti]
Women lie, men lie, women lie, men lie
Women lie, men lie, numbers don't lie (Aye, it's your boy, Yo Gotti!)
Women lie, men lie, women lie, men lie
Say what you want, but the pockets don't lie"
Ayo For Yayo,Andre Nickatina,['hip hop'],"[Intro: Sample]
OK... got some for me?

[Verse 1: San Quinn]
Yeah, yeah, listen to the story I'm about to tell
Another tale about that yayo
Little girl once innocent and sweet
14 introduced to the street
Started from weed, big smoke outs
Before you could exhale, blunt in your mouth
Sham, Nay, blew you blew
Now you need something else to do
A new high to try, a new place to go
Introduced to the yay to the yo
House full of girls, old and young
Plate on the table takin one on ones
Use dollar bills just to snort the lines
You see the big girls do it so of
Course it's fine
Cocaine enforced on your mind
Now blow, then they blow in ya time
Let's go
[Chorus: Andre Nickatina]
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo
All in my nasal
I must have been craze yo
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo
All in my nasal
I must have been craze yo

[Verse 2: San Quinn]
Choppin' and coppin' the kicks
Supplying people with they fix
Where you fit?
On Fillmore Street is where you sit
Don't go in the house till you move a zip
Worked a day and night shift
To stay awake, a nigga might sniff
Not too much cuz you might slip
Instead of 28, you cookin 26
Keep a gat and a pack in the sock
Take a couple of toots, then its back to the block
Back to the service out the sack
Experimenting with that soft, wonder 'bout that crack, huh?
One try, another try without a doubt
Papered out, always at the powder house
Day time, night time, nigga powdered out
Could've been a papered-up powerhouse
[Chorus: Andre Nickatina]
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo
All in my nasal
I must have been craze yo
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo
All in my nasal
I must have been craze yo

[Verse 3: San Quinn]
Like you and I, super high, like Super Fly
One more line, one more rhyme like Peruvian fine
I can keep you down, and get you high
You like to blow? Like Boston George?
You want some more, for you and your whores?
I kick off wars, and get behind walls
And corporate doors, executive nose sore
Rich man high, eight balls and quarters
They call me, placing they orders
Bring me across the border, buyin the cake
Before I'm sold, they take the taste
Snortin habit, not worth affordin
Some use me, strictly out of boredom
I hooked people before man, I warned them
I took many people out before them
Doing my job, connected wit the mob
Got President Bush, Whitney, and Bob
Many others all walks of life have one on ones with me every night
[Chorus: Andre Nickatina]
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo
All in my nasal
I must have been craze yo
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo
All in my nasal
I must have been craze yo
Ayo for yay-e-o
Walk around with yay-e-o
All in my nasal
I must have been craze yo
Ayo for yay-e-o
Walk around with yay-e-o
All in my nasal
I must have been craze yo"

(Dramatic, nigga!)
Well, alright, here I go

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'm a rapper-turned-singer, and you can tell that he smoke
But I don't need my vocal cords, all I hit is C-notes
N.E.R.D. flow, I spaz if I'm pre-voked
I'm about to change the fucking game, pass the remote
Money is everything, and it's every other thing
I'm part of the choir, that's the motto that my brother sing
Cash is the right now, women are postgame
MoneyOverBitches dot com, check the domain
It's coming too soon, album on the way
People ask me if I pray, I say, ""Yeah, once in a blue moon""
Oops, I mean a red moon, I did it again, Tune
Let me leave a space in for your Blood affiliation, I state
Heavy metaphors, flow so overweight
I could rap around these other young'un's like a cobra snake
Frostbite Drizzy, nigga, nobody as cold as Drake
Keep your ass in-line, don't be tryna roller skate
Fuck all the discrete shit, I get on some deep shit
I am 21, tell me, who do I compete with?
I'm on my elite shit, you could tell I'm real
'Cause I'm gettin' hood love and I ain't even talkin' street shit
Young Angel, Young Lion, I'm done tryin'
I'm just doin', who's drinkin'? 'Cause I'm buyin'
It's on me, everything is on me
And my girl is still down like she's fuckin' Jon B
And when I go dumb, I tend to do dumb shit
I just listened back and now I'm sounding like a trumpet
This for all the strippers 'cause I know that they gone bump it
Tell 'em, ""Back it up and dump it, back it, back it up and dump it""
Ain't no pistols here, your money will disappear
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year
Tax brackets and back-and-forth faxes
My money coming full circle, get up on my axis
Nebby, I'ma kill 'em, only 'cause I promised
They think I'm bein' cocky, but I'm only bein' honest
I'm swallowin' the Goose, got a model gettin' loose
And I never party 'less I got some bottles in the booth
I just walk up on the scene, I'm about to take this
I'm just havin' patience, 'cause I want it to make sense
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee State shit
Drop a four in it and appreciate the greatness, Drizzy
[Interlude: DJ Drama]
(Gangsta!) I just want y'all to remember
That this is the first mixtape you bumped
While you had a Black president

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, p-p-pass the dro
I am such a beast and you can ask them hoes
And they might even say you should leave me alone
And homie's scared, 'Cause his bitch like me
Stuntin' is a habit, get it from my daddy
Just like Shaggy, I tote that boom-bastic
I'm a rude bastard, I don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I ain't talkin' marbles, you can pluck my balls
And yes, I'm fallin', but up, I fall
And if your bitch in heat, she could fuck my dog
I went from penny pinchin' to private planes
Never sat on any benches, I got in games
Starter, Carter, ball harder
Ten girls, penthouse suite, y'all order
Whatever y'all please: wine, crackers, and cheese
They take off their clothes and put on my tees
The supplement I've taken got me feelin' mighty
My gun and money don't split, call that shit Siamese
Yes, my watch make the frickin' time freeze
Your girl bless me, she suck my dick and I sneeze
Cheap-ass apartment, just the kitchen I need
And 18 G's is why the chicken crossed the street
Whatcha know 'bout it? My niggas so about it
If you kill everybody, they can't go to court about it
Weezy, I ignore the liars, baby, I ignite the fire
I am like a Michael Myers, leave your body in the dryer
Got the shotty on the side of me, my bad boys follow me
I'm a bad boy, obviously, pop one at your Ivy League
I don't have a rivalry, if so, you'll have a cah-sualty
Oops, I meant ""a casualty,"" oops, I meant catastrophe""
Oops, I meant, actually, you niggas is just ass to me
And big, wet pussy is more like what I'm rather-ing
Welcome to the gathering, welcome to the burying
Or I hang you on the wall like a art gallery
You got short salary, and I got long money
I got Cash Money, I got Young Money, bitch (Gangsta!)

[Verse 1: Nas]
There comes a day in your life when you wanna kick back
Straw hat on the porch when you old perhaps
Wanna gather your thoughts, have a cold one
Brag, to your grandkids on how life is golden
So I'mma light a cigar in the corridor of the crib
Pictures on the wall of all the things that I did
All the money and fame, 8 by 10's
Of the whole Rat Pack inside of a big frame
Colliding with big names that could've made your career stop
All that, and your man is still here and I'm still hot
Wow, I need a moment y'all
See I almost felt a tear drop

[Bridge: Nas]
When was the last time you heard a real anthem
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme
Never on schedule, but always on time
[Chorus: Chrisette Michele]
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me
Ohh, I'm that history I'm that block
I'm that lifestyle I'm that spot
I'm that kid by the number spot
That's my past that made me hot
Here's my life long anthem
Can't forget about you
(Can't forget about, Can't forget about you)

[Verse 2: Nas]
Can't forget about the old school, Bam, Caz, Melle Mel, Flash
Rocksteady spinnin on they back
Can't forget when the first rap Grammy went to Jazzy, Fresh Prince
Fat Boys broke up, rap hasn't been the same since
So irregular, how it messed you up
When Mr. T became a wrestler
Can't forget about Jordan's retirement
The shot Robert Horry hit to win the game in the finals kid
Some things are forever, some things are not
It's the things we remember that gave the world shock
They stay in a place in your mind so snug
Like who the person was with whom you first made love
[Bridge: Nas]
When was the last time you heard a real anthem
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme
Never on schedule, but always on time

[Chorus: Chrisette Michele]
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me
Ohh, I'm that history I'm that block
I'm that lifestyle I'm that spot
I'm that kid by the number spot
That's my past that made me hot
Here's my life long anthem
Can't forget about you
(Can't forget about, Can't forget about you)
Can't forget about you
(Can't forget about, Can't forget about you)

[Verse 3: Nas]
Unforgettable, unsubmittable, I go by N now
Just one syllable, it's the end cause the game's tired
It's the same vibe, Good Times had right after James died
That's why the gangsta rhymers ain't inspired
Heinous crimes help record sales more than creative lines
And I don't wanna keep bringing up the greater times
But I'm a dreamer nostalgic with the state of mind
The past the past enough of it, aight then
But nothing gives me chills like Douglas and Tyson
Or Mike when his talk was live
Or when he first did the moon walk on Motown 25
[Bridge: Nas]
When was the last time you heard a real anthem
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme
Never on schedule, but always on time

[Chorus: Chrisette Michele]
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me

Dont Look Down,Kanye West,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","[Chorus: Mos Def]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Head's in the sky, wings raised and
She's about to fly, and take her place in
Out there in the stars, when she leaves the ground
She'll see a broken heart, if she turns around
But ain't no going back, this is how it must be
He told her she'll be burned alive, she just told him, ""Trust me""
If funerals are beautiful, this ugly
Knowing this, he told her, ""You won't leave me if you love me""
And he knows that, because he knows her
Hard to hide his feelings, as it engulfs her
Now she's a bright blaze, light rays
A shooting out, a phoenix on fire burning up the nightscape
So let's hear it for our heroine
Applaud as her spirit just flies into the never-end
One closed chapter, it opens up another part
So this is more like, ""The end, question mark""
[Chorus: Mos Def]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Don't let me hold you back, I only hold you back
We're on a dead-end street, this block has got a cul-de-sac
So fly baby, my baby so high
Sometimes it's so hard to say bye
We made it from the alley, straight up to the valley
We pulled up at the valet, we'll teach our daughter ballet
We'll raise us a Beyonce, maybe she'll be a Halle
You woulda been the best mom, I woulda been the best 'Ye
You see it all in my veins, like varicose
I know that's very gross, but we getting very close
To our end, though I kill most with a pen
Soon as this flow end, I'ma let Mos begin

Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
How could you do it? How could you do it?

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Okay, now baby, here we go, we go, no baby, me go
You got my heart, baby, this what it beat for
I give it all, walk as far as my feet go
What you mean, ""Me go?"" Why can't it be, ""We go""?
What happens when people turn to tears? (Huh?)
Dreams turn to memories and weeks turn to years, huh?
Been standing in the same spot for a couple of weeks
Give me my feelings back, wish love came with a couple receipts
Man, our vacation was coming next week
Girl, I swear you was a trip, let's make it a couples' retreat (Do it!)
How could my girl do this to me?
Woke up to a note saying, ""The world did this to me""
Now I'm testing, one-two, reporting live from the rubble
Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you
One, two, three, four, five models on the double
Give me head all at once, look like they lying in a huddle
But it's not even half the feeling
As hearing your, ""Seans, you know I love you""
Shedding tears every day (I know you do)
And I'm tired of lying in these puddles
I ask ""Why?"" sometimes like a fucking vowel
Been hitting trees every day like a fucking owl
Trying to get high enough to cut the clouds
Of the Phoenix sun and Nash it out
I mean ash it out, so I could see you smile
I-I know you can see me now

Diamonds up in my charm look like pineapple suckers
TEC-9 for some, MAC-90 for others
Lethal weapon on Ducati's, I got on my Danny Glovers

Five pass rocking with stacks in my pockets

Make them bitches sit back woofers give 'em wet cats
Coming down in a Chevy motor sound like it very tight
It is you can tell I hear the tire yelling er' light

That's when they enter the t-shirt contest to super soak their ass
So Method Man show these niggas the deal
Let these motherfuckers know that your hard to kill
[Verse 2: Method Man]
Who dat nigga? You with me with the super fly Methtical nigga
Who want to die? For real nigga
Wow, even try to test sides
Challenger your the bird with my .45 caliber
Can it be that this is the S.P.I.C.E. 1 and the Method motherfucka
With the guns blazing? You trail, my god, its amazing
Where your punk at?
Nightmares like Wes Craven
The bigger the critter, the harder to pull the trigga
I'll send your ass back to the dark side nigga
You're a snake, I've seen you sliver, so I deliver with death
We'll throw your punk ass in the river
On the battle ship I'm the captain
Beat that ass bloody as a sanitary napkin

Close up your shop, tic toc and it don't stop
Nigga, down for my strap niggas on their back
No rat-tat-tat silencer on the mac
Died come again, coming straight out of my jaws
Got these niggas screaming pause
Pistol whip and breaking out their jaw
Yeah, so you don't want to fuck with me
Many niggas out there willing to go nuts with me
And light up your block and leave them smokin like some fucked up bammer
Can't be caught by no Po-Po's, can't be put in no slammer
I don't be fucking with no snitches
Ain't no body going to tell, leave your dick in the dirt
And yo momma as well
New York to Cali niggas are hard to kill

If your not riding with your steal

Hip-hop addict, hip-hop addict
Man, I swear I'm on top like the attic
Yeah, bitch, I be with my dog like Shaggy
And we stay clean, but we get dirty like Harry
Flyer than bluebirds, cardinals and canaries
Fuck me, I'm all about ""oui"" like Paris—
Hilton, presidential suite already
I'm richer than Nicole, and I'm a lion like her daddy
I am hotter than the Sun-day after Sat'day
I swear, I'm a savage like Lil Webbie and Randy
Oscar De La Hoya, box ya like a casket
Or Diego Corrales, nigga, keep jabbin'
See, my style, it varies, like drugs in a alley
My leather so soft, my paint prettier than Halle
Wittier than comedy, nigga write a parody
But I ain't tellin' jokes... apparently
A parent, yeah, my daughter be the twinkle of my eye
You hurt her, you kill me, and nigga, I ain't 'bout to die
See y'all are at ground, and my daughter is my sky
I swear, I look in her face and I just want to break out and fly
Four tears in my face, and you ain't never heard me cry
I'm richer than all y'all, I got a bank full of pride
Oww!

I'm hyphy, somethin' like a piston

Oh, and did I mention? I'm fly like a pigeon
Higher than gas prices, you Las Vegas trickin'
I'm nine under par in a Bentley golf cart
The Polo be cream, but the Prada's caviar
Weezy, I'm sick from all this tourin'
He told me, ""Sip this, and call me in the morning""
Yeah, and I vowed to never trust another woman
In my life—then, I got horny

My cake sick, shit, been diagnosed, ""sickle cell bread""
My revenue stream got a disease like a jail bed
Like a mattress from Sing-Sing or way down in Comstock
These bitches call me ""Bling King,"" I shit when the bomb drop
And sprinkle diamonds all over niggas, flawless and D-Class
Then twinkle like a shine, just like a sparkle from clean glass
They movin' on a nigga as I'm walkin' the valley, ready
And zoomin' with the cameras like I'm dickin' down Halle Berry
My money help me do things that you niggas can't believe
Like purchase purses, places, all them things that you can't conceive
Like interactin' with women the caliber of Janet
I sit and master my vision and massacre the planet (Whoa!)
I hope you niggas know just what it is

Li-li-like this

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Now little Lisa's only nine years old
She's tryin to figure out why the world is so cold
Why she's all alone and they never met her family
Momma's always gone and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin and nobody'll listen
Momma's on drugs gettin high up in the kitchen
Bringin home men at different hours of the night
Startin with some laughs, usually endin in a fight
Sneakin in her room when her momma's knocked out
Tryin to have his way and little Lisa says ouch
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom but her momma don't believe her
Lisa's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get some clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back (Like this)
[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Little Nicole is only ten years old
She's steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
Why she's not pretty and nobody seems to like her
Alcoholic stepdad always wanna strike her
Yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises
Teachers ask questions, she's makin up excuses
Bleedin on the inside, cryin on the out
It's only one girl really knows what she's about
Her name is little Stacy and they become friends
Promise that they'll always be tight 'til the end
Until one day lil' Stacy gets shot
A drive-by bullet went stray up on her block
Now Nicole's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and NEVER come back

Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Little Erica is eleven years old
She's steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
So she pops X to get rid of all the pain
Plus she's havin sex with her boy who's sixteen
Emotions run deep as she thinks she's in love
So there's no protection, he's usin no glove
Never thinkin 'bout the consequences of her actions
Livin for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction
The days go by and her belly gets big
The father bails out, he ain't ready for a kid
Knowin her momma would blow it all out of proportion
Plus she lives poor so no money for abortion
Erica is stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she 'bout to run away and NEVER come back, ah!

Run it, run it, run it, run it, ah-ah
Don't keep runnin', runnin' away
Don't, don't keep runnin', runnin' away

I will run away with you, I will run away with you
Runaway, runaway love
Don't keep runnin' away
I'll run away with you, if you want me to
[Outro: Ludacris]
Yeah, I can only imagine what you goin through ladies
Sometimes I feel like runnin away myself
So do me a favor right now and close your eyes
And picture us runnin away together
When we come back everything gonna be okay

[Intro: Big L & Pete Rock]
Yea yeah, Flamboyant Entertainment
Big L

[Verse 1: Big L]
Yo, y'all fellas like to stress them chicks
Impress them chicks, spend money to dress them chicks
I sex them chicks and send 'em home
Corleone is known to be stoned
When I bone, I'm rubbered up in case that shit full blown
The other night around 8 P.M
Pockets crazy slim, jumped out the grey BM
Went to the ATM, took a thou' out
Then later on, I had to wild out
In the club, knocked some coward and his pal out
Then afterwards went to the restroom, pissed Cristal out
Now I'm thinkin' which chick number I could dial out?
'Cause it's L, the Harlem pimp, baby, for real
I got more dimes than that Sprint lady, and that's ill
Playa haters be givin' me harsh looks
But I'm tryin' to sell records like Garth Brooks
So F 'em all, when it's cold I throw the skelly on
Illegal chips, keep my celly on
Mega-ice is what I'm heavy on
If it ain't Cristal, boo, I guess it's Perignon
If the na-na's too tight, I throw some jelly on
Yo, try to tax and watch the 9 mill burst
I've been off the scene over three years and cats is still thirst
To hear Big L drop an ill verse
So all you unsigned cats that wanna battle - get a deal first
I sport the bulletproof, fitted hat
That attitude - you better get rid of that
Wherever you floss is where you gon' get it at
What? I stay strapped, I go to sleep with my steel
Makin' figures while you broke cats is keepin' it real
L is rap's most livest cat, I'm gettin' stacks
While you askin' people ""Do you want fries with that?""
I rob fags in the staircase, no mask, bare-faced
The one police wouldn't dare chase
Keep my gear laced
Do I walk around without papes? No way, pal
Word up - my money longer than the O.J. trial
[Chorus: Miss Jones]
Harlem World keep holdin' it downnnnn
Big L, Be The Long overdue (Big L)
Do you still got it got it? (""It's so amazin'!"")
Yeah, yeah, yeah.. Harlem World keep holdin' it down, for Big L
Nigga long overdue - niggas wanna know
Do you still got it got it? (""It's so amazin'!"")

[Verse 2: Stan Spit]
Stan Spit, yo, uh
Yo what the hell y'all can tell Spit? Not shit
I did a flick and bounced on L's shit
Well shit, expect me to go platinum
That's the only reason why I'm rappin'
And since L passed, niggas expect me to make it happen
With no release date, I sell in each state
I'm the type to drive to Philly, for a cheese-steak
So what I'm a Harlem king, doin' my thing
My name ring - chains and dames what the fame bring
After platinum it's the same thing
And niggas'll never learn
Til I pull the steel and make they lover burn
You don't get another turn, game's over
Here's my flamethrower
Rearrange your Rover, Harlem soldier
Wait til I get older - and we won't stop
I thought Mase told ya
Nigga Stan he do what he gotta
And these haters can't do me nada
Be in Nevada, with a lot of enchilada
[Chorus: Miss Jones]
Harlem World keep holdin' it downnnnn
Big L, Be The Long overdue (Big L)
Do you still got it got it? (""It's so amazin'!"")
Yeah yeah yeah.. Harlem World keep holdin' it down, for Big L
Nigga long overdue - niggas wanna know
Do you still got it got it? (""It's so amazin'!"")

[Verse 3: A.G.]
Yo, yo move the fuck back
A bring the heat, when I touch tracks
These niggas beef then wanna chill? Fuck that
These rap niggas with the mills, we deduct that
I asked all my ghetto cats, where my love at
Now where the brews, and the drugs at?
Corrupt cats kept slug hats
Asked the feds where the bugs at
Puff with the dread, 'cause I puff, black
High, til I die, and you can trust that
All I wanna know - is the club packed?
I see the haters sweatin' shorty, but I dug that
She put my nut sack back where her lungs at - little ho
And them niggas who owe, give up that
Huh, it's me and Corle', like Eddie and Nolte
Go 'head and provoke me
Heard you rap, wanna rhyme? Better be dope B
Still ""Diggin"", still livin', still givin'
Y'all the ill written, still fuckin' like Bill Clinton

Harlem World keep holdin' it downnnnn
Big L, Be The Long overdue (Big L)
Do you still got it got it? (""It's so amazin'!"")
Yeah yeah yeah.. Harlem World keep holdin' it down, for Big L

Revis take me shoppin' when I'm up in New York
Hit the shoe store, go and cop a few more
You at the mall getting dinner at the food court
I'm in LA eatin' twenty-two course
Young boss, bitch, paper in my pockets
I got a closet filled with shoeboxes
Mom said my spending habit little bit obnoxious
But a pilot stay fresh up in his cockpit
Used to rock hand-me-downs
Now I buy some clothes, wear 'em out
Hit the club, bitches pull they cameras out
Livin' in a dream, they beginnin' to believe
My hotel smell like cigarettes and weed
Shit, with what I'm spittin', they should give me a degree
Good liquor, what I'm sippin' isn't cheap, uh

I make 'em so mad, they got no swag
Pippens on my feet, they the throwbacks, look
My money good, but these hoes bad
So they stay attached to my gonads, uh
Wakin' up to a few L's
Open up my closet to that new shoe smell
I guess I'm doin' well
Smokin' all the weed that I used to sell
But once my album goes in the shelves
It's going Nextel how it's finna sell
For now, we're sellin' tapes out my shoebox
Any spot, just set up my shop
You're mad that your girl always says that I'm hot

No Competition,Eric B. & Rakim,['hip hop'],"No competition

No competition

[Verse 1]
Competition is none
I remain at the top like the sun
And I burn whoever come in the chambers of torture I caught ya
You should have brought ya
Neighborhood to support ya
No one in my path can withstand
Under pressure the wrath of a swift man
You name the day, the grounds could be neutral
Speak your piece, the feeling's mutual
We can go topic from topic whenever I drop it
Try to stop it
In other words, what the brother heard
He tried to catch it, but what occurred
Was too much weight for one brain to take
Try to concentrate maintain then elevate
From gram to ounce from pound to pound
The matter of weight can't hold my mind down
Permanent damage, I do away with
No time for fun, cause I don't play with competitors
It's only one when I'm done
Competition is none
It's no competition

[Verse 2]
Competition is none
I'm the sole survivor, emcees get live but I get live-r
It ain't a Memorex, live in concert
In every network, the R's the expert
Whoever goes against causes friction
Introduction, music, where's the mixing
Ra will never die, soon they'll never try
To beat or defeat me because whenever I
Put poetry in motion
From the Nile, then out to the ocean
Three-fourths of water makes seven seas
A third of land, 360 degrees
I circulate and remain to rotate
Seven days a week at a quick or a slow rate
Be prepared whenever I come

Competition is none
It's no competition

[Verse 3]
Creator, the alpha. Bet. Let's communicate
When I translate, the situation's straight
No dictionary's necessary to use
Big words do nothing but confuse and illuse
From the first step, my concept is kept
To the end of the rhyme, it get more in-depth
All thoughts I come across, my mind's the source
Made by the R, of course
Seven holes in my face as I'm looking out my window
Speak with the beat and it seems like the wind blows
Through the speakers, I hear it so pump this
And we can fill up the whole circumference
With competition, on an impossible mission
Coming up with nothing, keep fishing
No runner up, just lost or forfeits
They all get butterflies, soon as the door gets
Unlocked, lines for blocks and blocks
Might be trifling, to call the cops
Bring along paramedics
But that won't help you, not even calisthenics
I'm God, G is the seventh letter made
Raining on rappers, it's no parade
So if you ain't wise, then don't even come
Competition for this and the mixin is none
It's no competition
Competition is none!"

Let me tell you about a bad ass chick
Everybody wanna grab her
Tryna climb on that looking for a ladder
Niggas wanna stab her, dag her, dag it
Everybody want it
Ain't too many had it
Beauty and brains, went to all the classes
Graduated too even went and got a masters
Bad ass chick probably could have been an actress
So what she do?
She want to be an actress
Moved to Manhatton, shit got real
Took acting classes with Denzel
Leading lady like Hillary grabbing big Bills
Commercial money baby, ten thousand and a mill
Yeah, plus she had a baby boy
And the nigga she was with she couldn’t love more
Still want more, shit, she on a roll
Move to Hollywood, she could probably get a role
And she did, but realised the nigga wasn’t shit
Addicted to the broads and on top of this she pregnant
With another boy
Honestly thought abort but still had the boy
Lets name him Sean
Honestly probably after Connery
One of her favourite actors but acting ain't promising
Ay yo I know there was certain things that was meant for you
And thats why I’m giving you

Need y'all to just pray for me (Joey)
'Body pray for me
Need y'all to just pray for me (uh)

[Verse]
Now if it goes to the wire
I will never fall, I got the soul of a fighter
Walk barefoot over the coal, through the fire
I thought the toll would be lighter but make sure that blunt's rolled a little tighter
I tell 'em I'm just lookin' for some peace of mind
But they say I'm only working with a piece of mine
If I'ma do it'll be of my own accord, no crush
Swear to God I never called upon the Lord so much
Play the corner of the club, laughin' at the wannabes (why?)
It's ironic, 'cause they 'erything I wanna be
Would light a ton of reef
But that's gon' unleash everything I'm tryna hide underneath
Uh, then I'd lose all I've earned
Uh, and if there's two things that I've learned (what?)
Is I'm the only thing at stake (two)
And when you the only thing real really you the only thing fake
Uh, must be time to escape from that
And fuck rhymes, might be time to escape from rap
Why should I be the only nigga to escape from the act?
So I lie since everybody just escape from fact
Yo, that sucker shit niggas be on, I can't dig it
Joe, won't lose even if you plan to rig it
Yeah, nuttin' to prove with no fear of how I'm depicted
I'm here, won't move, I don't care to be evicted
You don't like how I move? (Well)
Well, I ain't gon' keep still, any nigga want me killed
Wanna leave me in the streets peeled
Well, if it happens, it happens, I believe in free will
Just know that ain't how we built
I'll call niggas that will dead you for a cheap thrill
When the clip's empty, they gon' try and refill
And I'ma be the dude to try stop 'em like ""Please chill"" (come on)
Y'all know what I'm about
They keep puttin' up roadblocks, I keep findin' alternate routes
Now success seems likely everybody wanna try me
I’m all for it, can’t trip me up, won’t fall for it
I'm just a man without a care (what else?)
Neighbor to heartache, roommate with despair (what else?)
Reminded my past is darker
'Cause when AM died (nigga), I was starin' at Travis Barker
Wishin' there was something I could say to make him cheer up
(So) And so I prayed, and he teared up
I ain't wanna see him go through that
The same shit that I feel, I just never show you that
Guess it's none of nobody business
And it just makes you look weaker, every joke is just smoke
Gotta look deeper, never mind, don't bother
'Cause some of y'all are smart e—nough and got sense
That if you try harder you'll get a glimpse of everything
That I harbor, we all ain't got the strength to be a martyr
So to anyone who ever loved me (what?)
I apologize, and I'm sorry
Whole-heartedly, can't change
It's just part of me, it's not music, shit's art to me
Too fucked up to drive, here's the car key
I don't care where we go just get it far from me
Choices I don't wanna make but I know I have to
World's goin' faster since my ride or die chose the latter
Lookin' for a rush out of habit
Proof there's a such thing as too much for a addict
Ain't the nigga I'm belittled as, riddled ass
Nigga come from middle class, when you speak to me show a little class
Dropped out of school, 'cause a nigga couldn't sit through class
Learnt to fall asleep through the sound of a pistol's blast
I come from where dad taught mom to get high (can you hear me?)
But she strong so we still got by (huh?)
When I picked up the drug why the fuck was they surprised
If it wasn't for your genes I wouldn't lust the supply
I come from a whole hood tellin' me that I'm next
Handin' me a mag, must've noticed I was complex (uh)
They say that you a wild individual
You just not gettin' my style, you too typical
'Erybody got a word for me
Shit y'all deem important ain't pertinent to me, nigga
Put your opinion with a feather, and balance that
Grab medicine when the success and the talent match

The Tyger,William Blake,['country'],"Tyger! Tyger! burning bright
In the forests of the night:
What immortal hand or eye
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

In what distant deeps or skies
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
On what wings dare he aspire?
What the hand dare seize the fire?

And what shoulder, and what art
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
And when thy heart began to beat
What dread hand? & what dread feet?

What the hammer? what the chain?
In what furnace was thy brain?
What the anvil? What dread grasp
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?

When the stars threw down their spears
And watered heaven with their tears
Did he smile his work to see?
Did he who made the Lamb make thee?
Tyger! Tyger! burning bright
In the forests of the night:
What immortal hand or eye
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?"
The Lamb,William Blake,['country'],"Little Lamb, who made thee?
Dost thou know who made thee?
Gave thee life, and bid thee feed
By the stream and o'er the mead;
Gave thee clothing of delight
Softest clothing, woolly, bright;
Gave thee such a tender voice
Making all the vales rejoice?
Little Lamb, who made thee?
Dost thou know who made thee?

Little Lamb, I'll tell thee
Little Lamb, I'll tell thee:

He is called by thy name
For he calls himself a Lamb
He is meek, and he is mild;
He became a little child
I a child, and thou a lamb
We are called by his name
Little Lamb, God bless thee!
Little Lamb, God bless thee!"
What I Got,Sublime,"['rock', 'alternative', 'blues', 'jazz', 'r&b', 'pop', 'hip hop']","[Intro]
Fuck, you can't even sing

[Verse 1]
Early in the mornin', risin' to the street
Light me up that cigarette and I'll strap shoes on my feet
Got to find the reason, reason things went wrong
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone
I got a dalmatian and I can still get high
I can play the guitar like a motherfuckin' riot

[Verse 2]
Well, life is (too short), so love the one you got
'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot
Never start no static, I just get it off my chest
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest
Take a small example, take a ti-ti-ti-tip from me
Take all of your money, give it all to charity-ty-ty-ty
Love is what I got, it's within my reach
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach
It all comes back to you, you're bound to get what you deserve
Try and test that, you're bound to get served
Love's what I got, don't start a riot
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot
[Chorus]
Lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
And remember that
Lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
(I got, I got, I got)

[Verse 3]
Why I don't cry when my dog runs away
I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay
I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock
Fuckin' and fightin'; it's all the same
Living with Louie Dog's the only way to stay sane
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me

[Chorus]
Lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
And remember that
Lovin' is what I got
I said remember that
Lovin' is what I got
(I got, I got, I got)"
Life Is... Too Short,Too $hort,"['hip hop', 'alternative']","[Verse 1]
I remember how it all began
I used to sing dirty raps to my Eastside fans
Back then, I knew you couldn't stop this rap
No M.C. could rock like that
Then the new style came, the bass got deeper
You gave up the mic and bought you a beeper
Do you wanna rap or sell coke?
Brothers like you ain't never broke
People wanna say it's just my time
Brothers like me had to work for mine
Eight years on the mic and I'm not jokin'
Sir Too Short comin' straight from Oakland
California, home of the rock
Eight woofers in the trunk, beatin' down the block
Short Dog, I'm that rappin' man
I said it before and I 'll say it again

[Hook]
Life is too short
Too short
Life is too short
Too short
[Verse 2]
Life is to some people unbearable
Committing suicide and that's terrible
Was it much too much or nothing big?
If you live my life, you'd be fightin' to live
Life is to me my main asset
I be doin' all right and keep it just like that
Chill out at the house and pump that bass
I'm tryin' to get rich as I rock the place
Everybody's got that same old dream
To have big money and fancy things
Drive a brand new Benz, keep your bank right here
Never hear me stutter once 'cause I talk real clear
It's on you, homeboy, whatcha gonna do?
You can take my advice and start workin', fool
Or you can close your ears and run your mouth
And one day, homeboy, ya soon find out

[Hook]
Life is too short
Too short
Life is too short
Too short

[Verse 3]
Life is too short, would you agree?
While I'm living my life, don't mess with me
It's been a long time, baby, since I first got down
But I still keep makin' these funky sounds
'Cause I don't stop rappin', that's my theme
I make a lot of money, do you know what I mean?
Life is, complicated, you must stay up
You're asked a simple question boy, don't say ""What?""
Ya only live once and ya callin' it hell
Policeman tryin' to take ya to jail
You could give a man time but you don't know
In a matter of time, I'll be runnin' the show
Now another young buck wants to be on top
Makin' big money, slangin' hop
The task force tryin' to peel your cap
Turn around, homeboy, you better watch your back
[Hook]
Life is too short
Life is...

[Verse 4]
You can take back all the things you give
But you can't take back the days you live
Life is to some people heaven on earth
Livin' every single day for what it's worth
I live my life just how I please
Satisfying one person I know, that's me
Work hard for the things I achieve in life
And never rap fake when I'm on the mic
'Cause if a dream is all you got, homeboy
You gotta turn that dream into the real McCoy
No time to waste, just get on that case
Can't be down 'cause you need to taste
A good life, livin' like a king on a throne
Getting everything you want and trying to handle your own
It's your life, don't be stupid though
'Cause when you waste it, you'll know life is...

Life is...
Alright, that's it"

""Other man!""

I stand in slapped by the wind as I begin
Do you know who I am? And many reply with a grin
Yes, I'm tired of being obtruded
Why should I be secluded? I've got a brand new horn to be tooted
To sum it up in a nutshell, ""Eminem will you kick it for me?""
So I find myself in a certain obligatory
A place that I dwell in, fell into some wonderful productions
To make up for lost time, and then it brings obstruction
Finally let loose, unloading the stockpile
A mental projectile, I aim at the reptile
I look to the one handed juggler and ask him this
""Why is it you insist upon stepping to an octopus?""
Is there a reason for this? The hindrance is aggravating
How many times will it take you before you realize you're fading?
Fading from existence, cause simulations are dead
There's so much more to learn and pages left to be read
So put up the front while you jam for the grammar that's poor
While I hold the scrapbook that's heavier than the hammer of the mighty Thor
Words can weigh a ton
Therefore it's never to fall into the hands of the wrong one
[Scratched samples] - ""Yeah"", ""It's another

Very few have made an attempt to put in a foot on the other side
But I see no borderline, from under this colorblind
And some will probably never hold pieces of the sacred
But then I'm finally about to put an end to the hatred
Wrong, the world would never endure to arguing
Awaking to the absence of unity is startling
""Oh foolish pride, what the hell are you trying to do?
You cannot beat someone that's better than you so quit trying to""
Your echoing words that mean nothing are despicable
So how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable
You're graceless, bland, you're tasteless and you're faceless faceless
Damn, you're dull it's time you faced this, here taste this
Straight from off of the pile, one of the numerous styles
The date of my birth on the Earth, the deliverance of a starchild
Blessed with formidable talent and versatility
But with such a power, there comes a responsibilty
To infringe on the boundaries, so now the defiance is clear
To form an alliance is something even the giants fear
So instead of being oblivious to the color of skin
Refusal of usin' is accepted now it's a trend

[Scratched samples] - ""Yeah"", ""It's another...""

[Eminem]
You know I don't understand why we all just can't get along
You hate me but you know me and what I stand for
No. so then why do you speak for me
And every other white man when you that we're your enemy?

On the floor lies a broken door, cause I'm not to be spoken for
Stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore
Rarely do you see the lighter side of me
I try to be persuasive but also invasive and try to end the rivalry
But ? is isolated, apologies are exhausted
Feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted
Who can I trust after repeatedly being shafted
Switch to the opposite, now scenes are being re-enacted
Pull up that boy by his roots, destroy him quick
His fracture's obviating, we hate him, his patterns past us, huh
Always fighting for the position of top dog
That spot's already occupied, and I don't play leapfrog
Cause I do not wish to fight over territory that's already mine
But I'm always having to prove myself, time after time
Oh how I never understand how a man could be outcast
Judged from the past and he's put last
And others with nothing to say
Stutterin' and slurrin' and mutterin' words with no meaning attack be signin' like Danny Kaye
Here I go again hammerin stammerin grammerin
And eat it like cheese, pass me the crackers please
I've got a craving"

With the boots on, police on us for real
And I love it, my guns is rugged, bulletproof vans with plans
To stay gangstered up and scramble
With the rest of the stresses, the tests
My bank HSBC, yeah, feel all my blessings
While wild out, I'm mild out, calm and humble
Blow a hole in your soldier, come through
Beyond that, guns for combat, right in front of the lobby
My hobby just too ill to saw black
He ain't the shit, we ain't the shit
But we will squeeze for them keys, point black and spank ya shit
Always in Nike, pen filled gooses, leather knockouts on, Tropican' juices
One false move I'm pressing niggas, automatic buttons on 4/5ths
Nigga, what, respect the niggas

They say nothing worth having comes easily
Let's go get in, buzz it down and spread it out evenly
Camouflage my rides, blend with the scenery
And bang in the face of my enemy
Divine from the waist ain't no killing me, it runs in my family
Bloodline, prepare for the best, through tough times
Fifty car caravan, anything jumping
Got the wheel real big with the rims still rubbing
But my rims ain't touching, I'm a Defcon button
I'm a Russian made Kalashnikov, motherfucker
The same thing that builds you up, ain't reserve notes
Watermarks stacked, In God We Trust
But any man can and will be crushed, heaviest move like elephant tusk
Think you better adjust the way you approach, don't get too close
Because you might get hit with a shitbag, and a wheelchair dented in zig-zag

I'm made of less metal, probably just couldn't take it
I roll with my aces, certified assassins
Mid-city militia, we come through smashing
We fucking with them butterknives, we swinging them katanas
Sharper than piranhas, cutting through your body armor
It's all about honor, man, respect the code
Touch a point on your neck and make your chest explode
And the water turns vets into vegetables
You gotta, stay on point or be the next to go
Whether, dickies or chucks, or the guess and low
It's all one love, homie, rep your coast
Cause fame is elusive, respect is the prize

Those guys with subversive plots
Be the ones you despise, and the first to watch, hah

Sometimes it seems like I'm stuck, I'm in the ghetto, Ooh
But I got love for the ghetto, ghetto
When I go to my friends
Now with open arms, let me in
And everyday
We just dream and scheme and drink our lives away
I think I'll fly the sky today

That candlelight complexion upon your skin
It lightens up my day, and that's oh so true
Together we're one separated we're two
To make you all mine, all mine is my desire

Then delay my system when you are near
Come with your positive emotion, love, making enjoyin
That's for me to bust it's like a girl and a boy
These feelings I get I often wonder why
So I thought I might discuss this, girl, just you and I

Shelter from the Storm,Bob Dylan,"['rock', 'blues', 'jazz', 'pop', 'alternative', 'r&b', 'hip hop']","[Verse 1]
'Twas in another lifetime
One of toil and blood
When blackness was a virtue
The road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness
A creature void of form
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

[Verse 2]
And if I pass this way again
You can rest assured
I'll always do my best for her
On that I give my word
In a world of steel-eyed death and men
Who are fighting to be warm
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

[Verse 3]
Not a word was spoke between us
There was little risk involved
Everything up to that point
Had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place
Where it's always safe and warm
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""
[Verse 4]
I was burned out from exhaustion
Buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes
And blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile
Ravaged in the corn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

[Verse 5]
Suddenly I turned around
And she was standing there
With silver bracelets on her wrists
And flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully
And took my crown of thorns
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

[Verse 6]
Now there's a wall between us
Something there's been lost
I took too much for granted
I got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began
On an uneventful morn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""
[Verse 7]
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails
And the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters much
It's doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker
He blows a futile horn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm

[Verse 8]
I've heard newborn babies wailing
Like a mourning dove
And old men with broken teeth
Stranded without love
Do I understand your question, then
Is it hopeless and forlorn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

[Verse 9]
In a little hilltop village
They gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation
And she gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence
And I got repaid with scorn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""
[Verse 10]
Well, I'm living in a foreign country
But I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor's edge
Someday I'll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock
To when God and her were born
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm"""

Life is harsh, nigga got a right to spark

Wouldn't wish this on nobody life to end up like mine
Ever since I was quite young a nigga been in a bind
Had to scratch for every plaque, even rap ain't all it's cracked up to be
Niggas don't stack up to me
Had to hustle in a world of trouble
Trapped in, claustrophobic, the only way out was rapping
America don't understand it, the demographics I tapped in
I'm the truest nigga to do this, nigga, and anything else is foolish
Like those who stay high, under God's grey skies
My lyrics is like Bible, made to save lives
In the midst of all your misery nigga, stay fly
Never let em see you frown, even smile when you down
Shit, I floss on my off-days, fuck what they all say
Niggas can't stop me with rumors, I'm too strong
All day, socks explode and sweatpants pockets is bulging
Holdin' it down on the corner with my block frozen
My spot is rolling, drop the price on the coke and
Drove the competition out and let the dough flow in
The cops is closing in, I can do the time
But what's really on my mind, there ain't no hoes in the pen
I play the low and try and make it hard to find me
Feds still tryna build a case since '93
I told them I'm retired, but they like whatever
You know them pigs don't wanna see you get your life together
[Chorus]
I'm stuck in this life forever
The more things change the more they stay the same
Who am I to change the game?
You gotta move quick like heroin and cocaine
The block's hotter than its ever been
(Once again)

[Verse 2]
Hold the gun at eye level, I ain't afraid of conflict
I let the nine rip, nigga say ""hi"" to the devil
I blind with the bezel, I'm in line with the ghetto
What y'all niggas afraid of, my mind or the metal?
Niggas tryna subtract my life, my mathematics is precise
I carry the 9, so fucking with me just ain't the answer
I just can't lose when I was young I was like Fresh
Poppa raised me to chess moves
And though you're gone, I'm not bitter, you left me prepared
We got divided by the years, but I got it from here
Don't sweat that, sounds bump from Marcy to LeFrak
To that project in DC where my man caught his death at
Over my years I've seen Rooks get tooken by the Knight
Lose they Crown by tryna defend a Queen
Checkmate in 4 moves, the Bobby Fischer of rap with raw moves
In a time where we all move
Let's face it: either you're dough chasing or basing
Lacing, crack's got you feelin' strong like Mason
Careful, any infiltration, I'm leaving niggas
Leaking more than just information
[Chorus]
I'm stuck in this life forever
The more things change the more they stay the same
Who am I to change the game?
You gotta move quick like heroin and cocaine
The block's hotter than its ever been
I'm stuck in this life forever
The more things change the more they stay the same
Who am I to change the game?
You gotta move quick like heroin and cocaine
The block's hotter than its ever been

Welcome to the South,Chamillionaire,"['hip hop', 'alternative', 'r&b']","[Hook: Chamillionaire]
(Welcome to the South) Try to criticize us for how we live
And go do the same things that we just did, mmm
(Better watch your mouth) try to criticize us for how we spit
Then say you respect the money that we get, mmm
(Welcome to the South) Must you criticize everything we did
Then expect at us to never even trip, mmm
We more than grills and candy paint so be careful what you say
Cause we might just throw it right back in your face, hey
(Better watch your mouth)

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Uhh, across the globe I hear the hate
The same whispers from state to state
If you didn't say it then this ain't for you
Don't worry 'bout it cause you can't relate
Before you buy me and you criticize me
While you beside me let's get it straight
Cause you remind me of the kid beside me
Same rapper that you say you hate
Wanna criticize then fine (fine)
Say the South got simple rhymes (rhymes)
Every time I travel I'm
In the backyard that act just like mine
Same grind just different times (times)
I know things done changed a lil'
Used to show our grills and they be like ""eww!""
Nowadays they all say ""that's ill!""
I remember when a major label
Wouldn't even come pay a visit
Used to say they have love for us but
They was blowin them suspect kisses
Now you watch and we see you plot
And you can't act like we ain't suspicious
Shootin slugs just shoot at us
But when you bust your thang, it misses
Uhh, I ain't even much trippin
Cause I'm the man where I'm residing
So I'm deciding where I'm residing
So never tolerate domestic violence
I know you'd rather me just relax
And sit back in silence
But I'm the owner, not just a client
So the South is what I stay advertising

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Don't knock the swagger, don't knock the swagger
Then turn around and be a swagger-jacker
If you a man then you should be a man
Don't walk around without a Adam's apple
We was lookin at it from a distance
But we wasn't trippin cause it had to happen
Styrofoam cup, and a Snapple
And you actin like you been a fan of rappin
If you was hatin or participating
When you saw us up and never slidin through
You and everybody else that did it
It applied to them and it applied to you
You actin like somebody made you say it
Took your hand and then applied the glue
Turn around and gave the mic to you
And now you end up looking like a fool
Can't polly us, come follow us
And that's the reason I'm in the lead
The rest of y'all are some bench warmers
And gettin mad cause I'm in the lead
I'm switching speeds don't get fatigued
Y'all behind the line, y'all chasin me
Y'all finna see my energy
So ya get off my back and let a playa breathe
I won't lie and act like
That I'm the one supporting everythang
Like Southern rappers ain't never lame
Like some of these boys don't eff up the game
Most of us do our thang
And the rest of 'em leave my ears in pain
But that's him and he sure ain't me
So don't look at us like we all the same

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
Uhh, South side candy rider never been a socializer
Flyin high, work grinder, knock your gal you can't find her
She was sittin on butter, hun'ned thousand under her ass
I was workin the wood circle smokin candy mashing on the gas
I can't be you I can't do you, I just do me, if you ain't
Been where I been then you cain't, be who I be if you ain't
Seen what I seen and you can't, see what I see
I put the bricks, in the road there was slab on it wasn't free
Been a legend in the South since the year 9-3
""Pocket Full of Stones,"" menace to society
The hard in the cars, chrome-y fo's, not D's
Now everybody pimpin and they all got keys
Please you work, for UPS
They say they smokin dro but all I keep smelling is stress
I roll with the best, '92 me and Screw in the Lexus
I might not be nothin to you but I'm the {shit} in that Texas

Standing Ovation,Chamillionaire,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'alternative', 'pop', 'rock']","[Intro]
What's up man? I seen you got a Grammy and everything
You done change you ain't, you can't even call me back
You don't even call me back bruh
I called you, 75 times yesterday dawg
They cut my phone off, cause I was calling you

[Singing]
Now that I got dough in my pockets
And a whole lot of profits seems like everybody loves me

[Chamillionaire]
It feels great, seems like e'rybody loves me
Round of applause for the cause, thank you, and thank you
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Used to treat me like the bad guy from Houston
And the media was like Darth Vader
People turning like turntables
They crossing over like cross-faders
Try to switch up teams like ballplayers
So our enemies are like our neighbors
Keep 'em close, yeah very close
Most of 'em folks are still loaning papers
You can work or you can have the work
Or we making more than all of y'all wagers
Motivation makes hustlers make it
So we successful cause y'all made us
Used to not give a flying 'F'
When they greeted us with that one finger
Whole world jumped on the tip
When we hit the switch and sat on swangers
Hit the hood they say y'all famous
Grinding hard so we can ball later
They be like ""Damn, that boy made it""
If they say I didn't that's wrong data
First a broad will try to say I'm fraud
See me pull that wad and that guard changes
Calling me she wanna be on the team
And now she mad cause I'm ignoring pages
Boys thinking that they concern me
Y'all actin like y'all waiters
Same ones that used to walk past
When we was underground but now we all majors
Keep speaking begging for a beat
And I'll tell the streets to do that boy a favor
Turning purple, blue and red, all flavors
I got a message for all haters
[Hook]
Made it to the top and it ain't no way to stop it
And I sho' ain't forgot when everybody used to judge me
Now that I got dough in my pockets
And a whole lot of profits seems like everybody loves me
I know you like my style, I know you like my style
I know you love the way I put it down
I made it through the hating
So when you see me shining give me a standing ovation

[Verse 2]
I was bouncin back like ping-pong
""Ridin"" became the new theme song
Beatin on my chest like I'm King Kong
When I broke the record for the ringtones
You ever seen a platinum plaque
That look like that then you seen wrong
Better sit back and relax
'Cause my platinum reign is gonna seem long
And I don't blame boys for hating
Cause they was impatient and they didn't know the plan
I knew that something had to shake
And it was gonna bubble like a Coca-Cola can
And I shook it up like a soda can
My wallet is overflowin man
Now my potential's unlimited
Like the minutes of my Motorola plan
Accountants and lawyers that got big business managers
Chamillitary is an enterprise
Is you ready to ride? Is you a fan or what?
SoundScan'in' in Africa, SoundScan'in in Canada
We don't play, yeah VMAs
It can't get any better, can it huh?
And I know it's hard to stay humble
They really thought I threw a fumble
I could'a caught that through the trees
Run it right into the jungle
Could'a been lil' Mugsy B., tryna back into Mutombo
Would'a still been a victory for me
You win then they'll say they love you
[Hook 2]
I know you like my style, I know you like my style
I know you love the way I put it down
I made it through the hating
So when you see me shining give me a standing ovation

[Verse 3]
Let's give 'em cheers (Give 'em cheers!)
To everyone who thought I'd disappear
Thought that every word I said
Was a subliminal shot to disappear
Now I'm in a different gear, no beef, no hate, no dissin here
You musta been drunk to doubt me
You obviously didn't miss a beer
I used to argue 'bout everythang
With folks that just didn't hear
You realize I was wasting words
Like whispering in a missing ear
I'd say it good and real, they telling me it isn't clear
My two eyes just didn't tear
'Cause weakness is what I didn't fear
It's a better result than last time
But this grind it's a different year
I really should be commended for what I've accomplished
Give a cheer
[Bridge]
Nah matter fact I take that back (wonderful!)
Hold your applause for the sequel
We haven't gotten to the part where they try to cheat you (wicked)
Haha, yeah...(Whoo! Chamillitary, you're a genius, you're a genius)

Made it to the top and it ain't no way to stop it

Chamillionaire's so - crazy
Look at the face of the media like you - crazy
You thought I'd fall, I'm sorry dawg ya - crazy
Mirror mirror on the wall, you are - crazy
I wonder if it's still called memory loss
If you can't remember the last time you lost, ha ha

[Chamillionaire]
Yeah, the only time I lose is when it's my memory
Haters coming around here, talking about ""Remember me?""
Nah, amnesia, Cham leader apparently
You are just a follower now I'm about to set a speed
If they can't keep up with, no one ahead of me
Victory is just, what I said that I can achieve
Bout to be trouble, you scared? I think you'd better leave
Hope you don't have asthma, ah-ahm, go 'head and breathe

Yeah, pull out your inhaler (go 'head and breathe)
You gon' have to catch your breath for this one
This the victory lap
Yeah, garage lift up, it'll create some enemies
Got the S-S in the middle of it like Tennessee
Sorry but the Ferrari there isn't friend-ly
The engine be running (PYOON!) like it's scared of keys
If she a freak don't handcuff her, just let her be
Get your G's like five letters after the letter B
Photocopy could possibly find a better me
Hot like two letters after the letter C
In the name of gang that's been running the game
Help me explain and tell 'em, Chamillitary mayne

I am a hustler, you gotta pay me
No time to sleep, I'm in the streets on the daily
When you a hustler, no being lazy
I got it whenever you need it just page me

Hustler music, I'm hustling music

A lil' too gangsta for them flicks, no photos
I'm high like gas, rose sticks and blow dodo

Fresh off the underground circuit
Straight into this overground circus (clown ass)
I'mma do numbers like the lotto

Now please pass my passport because I'm it
I got groupies with longer hair than Cousin It
Brazilian ladies who tell me, ""This bra just doesn't fit""
Twins in two rooms trying to make me double dip
Should'a known I would win, yeah, you thought you had it (what?)

This the part of the horror flick, where the white lady trips and falls
And me and Famous escape with the millions, ha ha

No time to sleep I gotta keep going
The hustler of all hustlers, I say it's something I borrow
Sell night to the day and then sell today to tomorrow
(No money don't even bother) Got some paper then call up
Call George Bush's daughter I sell her Katrina water (why?)
Just to get at her father, just so they have some evidence
I'm slick enough to take precedence from the president
America's worst nightmare is right here
I stay sizzling like flares, look up, PYOON!
It's quite clear it's my year 'til I hear
Somebody's smoother then I'm the ruler, I'm like - where
Is he at? Just let me know, I'mma bury him
Under the rocks in the bottom of my aquarium
The chances of me losing this time are very slim
If he was bright then I'm turning him down to very dim
If it ain't me in the sequel then there will be no sequel
You know the obvious reason is cause there is no equal"
Genesis 1,Holy Bible (KJV),['country'],"Genesis 1:1: In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

Genesis 1:2: And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness [was] upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

Genesis 1:3: And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

Genesis 1:4: And God saw the light, that [it was] good: and God divided the light from the darkness.

Genesis 1:5: And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.

Genesis 1:6: And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.

Genesis 1:7: And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which [were] under the firmament from the waters which [were] above the firmament: and it was so.

Genesis 1:8: And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.

Genesis 1:9: And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry [land] appear: and it was so.

Genesis 1:10: And God called the dry [land] Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that [it was] good.

Genesis 1:11: And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, [and] the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed [is] in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
Genesis 1:12: And the earth brought forth grass, [and] herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed [was] in itself, after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good.

Genesis 1:13: And the evening and the morning were the third day.

Genesis 1:14: And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years.

Genesis 1:15: And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.

Genesis 1:16: And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: [he made] the stars also.

Genesis 1:17: And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth.

Genesis 1:18: And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that [it was] good.

Genesis 1:19: And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

Genesis 1:20: And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl [that] may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.

Genesis 1:21: And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good.

Genesis 1:22: And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.

Genesis 1:23: And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

Genesis 1:24: And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
Genesis 1:25: And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good.

Genesis 1:27: So God created man in his [own] image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.

Genesis 1:28: And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.

Genesis 1:29: And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which [is] upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which [is] the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.

Genesis 1:30: And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein [there is] life, [I have given] every green herb for meat: and it was so.

Genesis 1:31: And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, [it was] very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day."

I'm having trouble at the crib
I'm going at it with my baby mother where I live
While the soldiers bleed, the economy recede
And all she want to watch is reality TV
Well for us real life is Strange Love
Some behavior, I couldn't figure the flavor
Dropped out of Charm School when she fell in love with New York
And love money
That's what I'm not made of
I bought a membership to the Celebrity Fit Club
To see if I could stand a real chance with this love
It don't make sense, the way she try to turn a G to a Gent
Don't need tough love, don't get it mixed up

I was one of them Wildboyz, Shootin for Sizemore
She was a little live jawn watching The Osbournes
The Best Week Ever had her goin for broke like Eddie Griffin
Or Danny Bonaduce, but no he never listened
When I drop a Super Sweet 16
Daydreamin of becoming Miss Rap Supreme
Or maybe Making a Band but bring your guns out
Sing your lungs out
Move out like Daddy's Girls out of Run's House
But that's against all odds
Pick apart this mic, come try to Pimp Your Ride
Real as Real Housewives of Atlanta
Yeah it's real outside
And it's like an episode of College Hill outside
Whether it be for the love of the payday
Or for the love of trying to have a baby for Ray J
The most modest model on Project Runway
She wanna be Kimora livin Life in the Fab Lane
And change her last name, and since Gotti's Way was passé
She watched Salt N Pepa and Celeb Rehab day
That's all she talk about at the café
I swear to God it drove me to drink about a half a carafe, hey
My head's so spinning
I'm so through with women
Who watch reruns of The Real World with dinner
And Kim Kardashian, moms and Bruce Jenner
And Three 6 Mafia show, and Jerry Springer
Scott Baio, 46 and Knocked Up
I'd rather see The First 48 or Locked Up
Instead it's just a Nanny 911, I'm Trading Spouses
Extreme Makeover, she rearranged the couches
Now she keep changing outfits
I'm about to get a Doctor Phil to do something about this
The house not fresh, she not Top Chef
I tell her Viva la Bam, she tell me not yet
Watching Cribs lookin at shit she never gon' get
America's best dance move she tryin to do the step
'Bout to do her like Beyonce and tell her to the left
Truth be told, she's bout to television me to death

So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?

Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

I wanna be a billionaire so fricking bad
Buy all of the things I never had

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes, like, here lady have this
And last but not least, grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the ho-ho
Aha, get it?
I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go, I'mma have my own theme music

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I wanna be a billionaire so fricking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights
A different city every night
I swear, the world better prepare
For when I’m a billionaire

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Billionaire dollar crib, stadium, theatre
Personal ball cleaner, the closet's all Gators
I'm eating this morning, break-fast
I'mma need 1st place, I refuse to take last
You can hear the wordplay on the top of the bass-clap
You niggas is all drop-outs, you hate class
Until them umbrellas pop out, splish-splash
Ain't no rain on her blou-ouse, get back
Cause them doors close by themselves
Oh, no-no-no, I don't need nobody help
They say I'm backwards cause the doors on my Phantom open up the wrong way
And I'm like no, homeboy, you just making the wrong pay

Gucci Mane la Flare in the building, yeah
Right back like I never even went nowhere
Growing up, I dreamed I would be a billionaire
And when the Jordans came, I could buy a billion pair
Cause zillionaires swagged up, swear it ain't fair
Lames lay game and they too too square
Life's too short to sit back and look
Every night is a movie, my life's a book
Money rules the world, but money runs to me
You can't put a price tag on what God's done for me
I wanna be a billionaire so freaking bad
So I can tell all my haters to kiss my ass
It's Gucci

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh-oh)
Hey-ay

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son, hoo!
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no-no, hee-hee-hee)
Hoo!
[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, hee!
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
(Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts""
(Don't break no hearts!) (Hee-hee)
But she came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo!)
Hey-ay

Billie Jean is not my lover (Hoo!)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no (Hoo!)

It's Chris Webby, yeah
Asher Roth ain't the only college boy on this rapping shit
And I love college too, shit, heh

[Chorus]
That party last night was awful nuts bro, wish I remembered
But I took a Xany, and shots of Soco so it's whatever
Roll my blunts and pop my E
Now chug that 40 just like me
Pass out at 6, wake up at 3
Then do it again, tonight drinks on me, man I love college

[Verse 1]
I love college even more than Asher
Different chick every other night come home plastered
Somehow pass class and twist blunts after
I'm Hofstra's top dog and homecourt rapper
Fitted pointed backwards, spittin' that fire
The shit on campus bitch ask Van Wilder
Don't need a reminder to party everyday
Cause I'm an alcoholic, I remember anyway
I've been drunk since 12, mothafuck a drinkin' age
Walk in a liquor store, take my wallet out to pay
Clerk tellin' me I'm not who I say I be
Even though it says I'm Spanish on my fake ID
[Chorus]
That party last night was awful nuts bro, wish I remembered
But I took a Xany and shots of Soco so its whatever
Roll my blunts and pop my E
Now chug that 40 just like me
Pass out at 6, wake up at 3
Then do it again, tonight drinks on me, man I love college
And I love boozin', and I love bitches, I love college

[Verse 2]
They say drugs make you dumb, but I don't think they do
Last semester, I pulled a fuckin' 3.2
When I wakeup's, the only time I'm sober enough
To do homework unless I'm hungover as fuck
And still there ain't even a teacher that can hold me
Go to class blunted, lookin' somethin' like Spicoli
Or I just pull a Ferris Bueler, skip the whole day
I'm just here for the party and I hope that's okay
But there's no way to stop me, this sophomore's a monster
Even though I'll end up doin' 6 years at Hofstra
Sit back, sippin' on a beer with a mic
Knowing these are gonna be the best years of my life, right?

[Chorus]
That party last night was awful nuts bro, wish I remembered
But I took a Xany and shots of Soco so its whatever
Roll my blunts and pop my E
Now chug that 40 just like me
Pass out at 6, wake up at 3
Then do it again, tonight drinks on me, man I love college
And I love boozin', and I love bitches, I love college
[Verse 3]
I'm a flip-cup phenomenon, beer pong pro
Hit all 10 in a row with my fuckin' eyes closed
A little bend of the knees and a flick of the wrist
Have you chuggin' every second while I'm sippin' my shit
Dutch Master always full of some ridiculous piff
That got me twisted like a licorice stick
Listen to this, my time is never wasted cause I'm always wasted
I fuckin' love college, that's all I can say kid

[Chorus]
That party last night was awful nuts bro, wish I remembered
But I took a Xany and shots of Soco so its whatever
Roll my blunts and pop my E
Now chug that 40 just like me
Pass out at 6, wake up at 3
Then do it again, tonight drinks on me, man I love college

Ecclesiastes 1,Holy Bible (KJV),['country'],"Ecclesiastes 1:1 The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.

Ecclesiastes 1:2 Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.
Ecclesiastes 1:3 What profit hath a man of all his labor which he taketh under the sun?
Ecclesiastes 1:4 One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.
Ecclesiastes 1:5 The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.
Ecclesiastes 1:6 The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.
Ecclesiastes 1:7 All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full: unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.
Ecclesiastes 1:8 All things are full of labor; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
Ecclesiastes 1:9 The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.
Ecclesiastes 1:10 Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.
Ecclesiastes 1:11 There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.

The Experience of the Preacher
Ecclesiastes 1:12 I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
Ecclesiastes 1:13 And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.
Ecclesiastes 1:14 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.
Ecclesiastes 1:15 That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.
Ecclesiastes 1:16 I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.
Ecclesiastes 1:16 And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit
Ecclesiastes 1:17 For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow."

Look at my necklace, maybe hit a nigga disrespect this click
My pistol grip sound like this...now what
Who want they day fucked, when I cock and load the K, bust bust
Y’all  cowards play tough, and my peeps we come to spray stuff up
Y’all  lives made up, like ugly hoes with make-up bra
We'll shoot you up then toss yo ass in the lake tough nut
My wrist rocky like Sylvester Stallone
So therefore you should invest, in a vest for your dome
Cause I know you marks planning on getting me when I'm landing
Peace to Nick, but my cannon go *Gun Sound*

Fuck a medic, we gonna call yo ass a taxi cab
Bleeding so hard you'll need a life size maxi pad
So flip the script and tell your woman its your time of the month
AK-47 for the niggas who's really looking for heaven and a 9 for you chumps
Got killers in my squad and I'm the nicest one in my group
But I got bananas for you niggas and I ain't talking bout fruit
I’ll peel your cap back with the black mac
'Til your back crack, cock the gat back like (clak clak clak)
Swallow a hollow make 'em digest with a 50 caliber
Your futures not looking so good, tomorrows not on your calendar
I do away with the amateurs, they breathing too long
Ill leave 'em coughing like the sound effects you hear in this song
My shotguns are cold and hard, but my desert is easy
And my triggers are always talking about some squeeze me, squeeze me
And for these fakers talking greasy, I'm starting the show
My uzi got a drum roll, it goes *Gun Sound*

Alright, run it
I never gave a fuck
I never gave a fuck about what niggas thought about me
I mean, I did, but like, fuck it, you know what I'm saying?
You gon' love me, man
You gon' love me, man

[Verse 1]
They can't comprehend
Or even come close to understanding him
I guess if I was boring they would love me more
Guess if I was simple in the mind, everything would be fine
Maybe if I was a jerk to girls
Instead of being nice and speaking kind words
Then maybe it would be okay to say then
I wasn't a good guy to begin with

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But my mind is all crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
They got me thinking I ain't human
Like I came in from above, above, above, above
Feeling like an airplane in the sky
But then they say I'm crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
They got me thinking I ain't human
Like I came in from above, above, above, above
Feeling like a bird sitting high, high

I be that man on the moon, I'm that man on the moon
And I'mma do what I do, so do you, hey-hey

I'm that man on the moon, I'm up-up on the moon

You know, and they'll be like

You know what I'm saying?
""Why your shit, like on another level-Why's, why's it sound so different?""
Like that's a bad thing
And I be like
""Why not, nigga?""

[Verse 2]
Close my eyes, high in the dark
It's a curtain call; come one, come all
All I do is try to make it simple
The ones that make it complicated
Never get congratulated
I'm something different, all aspects
Don't want a woman just to love her assets
I'll still wife her up, even with her flat chest
The type to get hurt, but that's the past tense
[Pre-Chorus 2]
My mind is all hazy, hazy, hazy, hazy
I be thinkin' that I'm wrong
'Cause they used to call me lame, lame, lame, lame
My swag was a little different
But then my mind is hazy, hazy, hazy, hazy
I be thinkin' that I'm wrong
But they the ones who lame, lame, lame, lame
I got the last laugh, nigga

I be that man on the moon, I'm that man on the moon

Sonnet 18,William Shakespeare,['country'],"Shall I compare thee to a Summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And Summer's lease hath all too short a date:
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
And every fair from fair sometime declines
By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd:
But thy eternal Summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;
Nor shall Death brag thou wanderest in his shade
When in eternal lines to time thou growest:
    So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee."

Mark ass niggas stay the fuck up out my way
I'm a true OG, you can quote what I say
I'm an H-town nigga from around the way
Southside, Ridin' Dirty like I'm UGK
Asshole by nature like my name was Trae
And I don't gangbang, I patrol the game
And what I'm representing here is putting holes in brains
Before I say the same thing I'll be old and grey
'Fore I fall off and rap about my clothes and chains
Gripping grain and popping trunks, dog but that ain't me
These elbows hit the scene back in eighty-three
I stay street, when it's done, that's that
You could find me in your hood pumping monster crack
I roll over rodents in Rovers with rims on 'em
Sniffing out a rat I expose him and then dome him
A lot of nigga's bitches, they claim that they OGs
A straight up pussy and claims that he knows me
You see I, putting out these DVDs
Now my shit done hit the streets, he gots to squat the pee
Got the Feds on his team so they watching me
Mousetrap for a rat, pussy watch and see

Just open up and let it rip, ain't nothing new to a G
Hey I ain't worried about these niggas till they shooting at me
My partner died, daughter too, give excuses to me
Still a buster ass rapper I'm refusing to be
Scarface seem to say I'm the king, you a fool if you think
There's another young new rapper dude out there cooler than me (Haha)
I cruise in the V, brand new with the beat
I live a real life like I say I do in the beat
Yo, true indeed, I do indeed
Do it for the OG's and the true MC's
Them busters say this year I got brand new and it's all phat
Cut that fighting in the club, I'm done with all that

Don't pop pills either cause that shit ain't cool
We just drunk a Mad Dog 'fore we went to school
Flick off, back then I was smashing boys
Jump wrong, you saw a nigga get his ass destroyed
Same rules right now, I demand respect
And if I slapped one ho, then her man was next
I'm a kick door robber, a hot-shot driver
A crack rock slanging motherfucker for a dollar
If it's a dare to be made, then I'm finna make it
But if it ain't no way, then believe I'm finna take it
Cause a nigga with no hustle, it ain't worth this G
And a bitch like this is even worse than that
I've been good at bullshitting but this game can cost
And if a nigga can't maintain, mayne he lost
He a nerd, and they fuck nerds in jail I heard

Thinkin' of a master plan
'Cause ain’t nothin' but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pocket, all my money spent
So I dig deeper, but still coming up with lint
So I start my mission, leave my residence
Thinking, ""How could I get some dead presidents?""
I need money, I used to be a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up: ""This is a hold-up, ain’t nothing funny
Stop smiling, be still, don’t nothing move but the money""
But now, I learned to earn 'cause I’m righteous
I feel great, so maybe, I might just
Search for a 9 to 5, if I strive
Then maybe I’ll stay alive
So I walk up the street, whistling this
Feeling out of place 'cause, man, do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Eric B and a nice big plate of
Fish, which is my favorite dish
But without no money, it’s still a wish
'Cause I don’t like to dream about gettin' paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made
So now's a test to see if I got pull
Hit the studio, 'cause I’m paid in full

Rakim, check this out
Yo, you go to your girl's house and I'll go to mine
'Cause my girl is definitely mad 'cause it took us too long to do this album

Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise
[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

[Bridge: Justin Vernon & Kanye West]
At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
Saw the devil in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)
Can we get much higher? (So high)

Monie in the Middle,Monie Love,['hip hop'],"Brother what is with you, you can't take a hint?
I need to shove a splint between your eyes for you to see
You and me were never meant to be
Your homeboy likes me, I like him too, get out the picture
I get your point but I'm not rolling with the punch
I scrunched up the letter you wrote me in lunch
In 5th period I pay no notice to your motion
My work is on the table, my pen's in locomotion
Every time I turn around, you're looking at my face
I try to ignore you, the bell rings, I race out the room
Zoom to another room, sit down, what do you know?
The lover's in town
The other brother (Who?) The one I want to talk to
Sitting three seats back, and I'mma walk over to him
And give him the letter I wrote
Because my feelings towards him are brewing, ya know?

Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
Yep, Monie's in the middle (Where that at?) In the middle
Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
(Go Mon, Mon, what is she?) Monie in the middle (Repeat 2x)
In 7th the knucklehead walks in and sits down beside me
I said ""Yo, why you trying to ride me?""
Day in and day out I can't seem to get you off my back
What do you think I should do about that?
In fact it's embarrassing, what a buffoon
You even follow me in the ladies bathroom
Give me a break, I can't take it, the stakes are too high
Besides, there goes the other brother
I'm not Keith Sweat, so don't sweat me
The other brother's smooth approach is what gets me
He intrigues the Mon you know
So I suggest the course towards me you blow
You're wasting time pursuing Monie
Cause she's pursuing the lover only
And as my mother did she told me
Go for what you know, Mo, yo

Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
Yep, Monie's in the middle (Where that at?) In the middle
Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
(Go Mon, Mon, what is she?) Monie in the middle (Repeat 2x)

Bringing matters to a close and everybody knows
That I'm no longer in the middle
I made my decision, precisely, precision is a must
For me to solve another riddle
Step into a brand new rhythm,-ism schisms
Nope, I'm not with 'em, I've given
My undivided attention, you know what I'm saying?
No type of games I'm playing when
Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
Yep, Monie's in the middle (Where that at?) In the middle
Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
(Go Mon, Mon, what is she?) Monie in the middle (Repeat 4x)"
The Symphony,Marley Marl,"['hip hop', 'alternative']","[Intro: Marley Marl]
I don't care who's first or who last
But I know that y'all just better
Rock this at the drop of a dime baby
I don't know what y'all gon' do with this, but it got to be funky
It got to be funky if you're gonna be on it
I don't care who start
I don't care what y'all do
But you got to be finished
Before the music is through
Now who's first up to bat?

[Verse 1: Masta Ace]
Listen closely, so your attention's undivided
Many in the past have tried to do what I did
But just the way I came off then, I'm gonna come off
Stronger and longer, even with the drum off
I keep on goin' and flowin' just like a river
I got a whole lot to give, so I'mma give a
Little at a time, new trails are blazin'
Action is in effect, and always stays in
Yeah, just like a shot from a cannon
I am the man in charge and I've been plannin'
A jam strong enough that it can lift your soul
I'm the originator, and my rhymes are made of gold
Once you hear the capital ""A"" rap, it'll stay
With you for a while, it won't go away
Unless you force it, because it stays with you, my friend
And if you toss it away, I'mma hit ya again
I project my voice so it's right in the crowd
There's a sign at the door: No bitin' allowed
And if you didn't read it, I suggest you do so
Or you'll be stranded, just like Crusoe
Sleep if ya wanna, go 'head, get some shut-eye
A man broke his jaw tryin' to say what I
Say on the microphone, you shoulda left it alone
Just for the record, let it be known
That my ego's only partially grown
And never will I ever condone bitin' in any form
Yo, I only warn, that verse was the calm, now here's the storm
[Bridge]
Next up... (Yo, I believe that's me)
Craig G, light up the mic for the Symphony

[Verse 2: Craig G]
This jam is dedicated to all un-optimistics
That thought I wasn't comin' out with some exquisite rhymes
But that's alright, 'cause now I'm back
To kill all the rumors and straighten the facts of me
Not rockin' rhymes like I always used to
But you jumped on the tip when you heard me and the Juice Crew
You said, ""Mmm-mmm-mmm, ain't that somethin'?
Yo, Craig, I heard you in that jam, and it's pumpin'!
I apologize, oh yeah, and uh
Can I have your autograph for me and my grandma?""
That's how I'm livin'; on surprise mode
Don't even sleep, try not to keep your eyes closed
'Cause if you do, when you awaken
Your so-called spot will be taken
I'll take you over like a greedy executive
'Cause on the mic, my prospective is
To be the best in all rap events
And since I have a call, I call experience

[Bridge]
Next up... (Yo, I believe that's me)
Kool G Rap, light up the mic for the Symphony
[Verse 3: Kool G. Rap]
Yo, Marley gives a slice, I get nice
And my voice is twice as horrifyin' as Vincent Price
Goes deep, till you fell in a spell of a sleep
And while I'm countin' the money, you count sheep
When G Rap strikes the mic, I recite the type of hype that you like
That make the people unite
I grip up hips and zip up lips, step on reps
You flip and wanna sip on my tip
Take a deep breath, because you don't have another left
Comin' back like I'm avengin' my brother's death
Makin' veterans run for medicine
'Cause I put out more lights in a fight than Con Edison
Rip the damn cage like I'm on a rampage
So, if you want rage, I'mma make front page
Read the headlines, suckers, today's the deadline
Your head is way past bedtime
Can't kill, though, solo, cuz you're still all... soft like a pillow
My rap is rougher than Brillo
So, fear me, don't dare dare me
And don't compare me to him when you hear me
Talk about a battle, but you ain't yet ready for war
Your metaphor sucks more than a whore
You can't replace me, ice me or ace me
Bass me, face me, slice me or race me
Bite me or taste me -- I'll show you that I got force
My rap burns your mouth like hot sauce
Run for water while I break your tape recorder
Serve the sucker, the order is manslaughter
Another rapper G Rap wrecks
He's rated X, that means the boy is sex, next
The amplifier gets used and abused
Pumps so loud, we might blow a fuse
This is anger, madness, ready to hang a rapper or singer
I'm puttin' up my middle finger
[Bridge]
Next up... (I believe that's me)
Big Daddy Kane, get on the mic for the Symphony

[Verse 4: Big Daddy Kane]
Settin' it off, lettin' it off, beginnin'
Rough to the endin', you never been in
To move the groove with the smooth rap lord
Like a bottle of juice, rhymes are bein' poured
Down your ear, crisp and clear
As I prepare to wear, tear and smear -- then I'm outta here
With a mark left that you can all cling
'Cause rockin' a party? Yo, it's a small thing
I rip many places on regular basis
And broken down mics were the only trace is
That I'd been there and there at the party
The mic had my prints, and on it was a body
So, take caution, I'm not horsin' around
In a throwdown, clown, I'm takin' yours, son
So just acknowledge the way that I kicked it
'Cause if rap was a house, you'd be evicted
And dismissed from the microphone
Chokin' on a bone 'cause Daddy's home
And battlin' me is hazardous to health
So, put a quarter in your ass 'cause ya played yourself
Like a game in the arcade, you need a far aid
I'm walkin' the path that Allah made
I'll attend and then begin to send a speech to reach and teach
So just say when
So I can let lyrics blast like a bullet
My mouth is the gun; on suckers I pull it
The trigger, ya figure, my pockets gettin' bigger
'Cause when it comes to money, yo, Grant's my nigga!
You've got the groove, MC's, freeze, stand still, nobody move
It's a sabotage, as I take charge
Don't barge, 'cause goddamn, I'm livin' large
Like a giant, you're nothin' but a midget, a small digit
You ain't wit' it, forget it, quit it
I reign superior, always takin' care o'ya
No-frill rappers, you will evaporate
Disintegrate, deflate to your fate
As the great will dominate straight to the state
Of reignin', gainin', so put Kane in
That category, period, end of story

[Outro: Marley Marl]
Not in my book
Y'all are supposed to keep goin' until the end of the record
I still hear beats, what's wrong with you?
Yo, fellas y'all got to do somethin' on this them tracks
So let the track house you, what?
So let the track house you, what?
Yo, I can't believe it
I can't believe it
I can't believe it
I can't believe it"
Im Bad,LL Cool J,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop']","[Intro]
Calling all cars, calling all cars...
Be on the lookout for a tall light-skinned brother with dimples
Wearing a black Kangol, sweatsuit, gold chain, and sneakers.
Last seen on Farmers Boulevard headed east.
Alias L.L. Cool J. He's bad...

[Verse 1]
Aaaahhhhhhhhhh
No rapper can rap quite like I can
I'll take a musclebound man and put his face in the sand
Not the last Mafioso, I'm a MC cop
Make you say ""Go LL,"" and do the Wop
If you think you can outrhyme me, yeah boy I bet
Cause I ain't met a motherfucker who can do that yet
Trendsetter, I'm better, my rhymes are good
I got a gold nameplate that says ""I wish you would""
And when battles begin then I gotta join in and
Before my rhyme is over, you know I'mma win
Cool J has arrived so you better make way
Ask anybody in the crowd, they say the kid don't play
Slaughter competition, that's my hobby and job
I don't wear a disguise because I don't owe the mob
Got a pinpoint rap that makes you feel trapped
So many girls on my jock, I think my phone is tapped
I'm bad
Cool J, Cool J, Cool J, Cool J, Cool J, Cool J

[Verse 2]
I'm like Tyson, icin', I'm a soldier at war
I'm makin' sure you don't try to battle me no more
Got concrete rhymes, been rappin' for ten years and
Even when I'm bragging, I'm bein' sincere!
Emcees can't win, I make 'em rust like tin
They call me 'Jaws,' my hat is like a shark's fin
Because I'm bad as can be, got my voice on wax
Some brothers think he's making records, now he must have relaxed
I couldn't, I shouldn't, and it'll stay that way
The best rapper you've heard is LL Cool J
Kamikaze, take a look at what I've done
Used to rock in my basement, now I'm number one
And can happen on time, never standin' on line
You wanna try me? First you better learn how to rhyme
I'm the pinnacle; that means I reign supreme
And I'm notorious; I'll crush you like a jellybean!
I'm bad

""Suspect was last spotted with three other members of his group. Bobcat, E Love and the Cut Creator. They are extremely bad, so keep your eyes open. Use extreme caution""

[Verse 3]
I eliminate punks, cut 'em up in chunks
You were souped, you heard me, and your ego shrunk
I'm devastating I'm so good it's a shame
Cause I eat rappers like a cannibal they call me insane
I'm as strong as a bull of course you know why I pull
I enjoy what I'm doing plus I'm paid in full
Not Buckaroo Banzai, but bustin' out as I
Say the kind of rhymes that make MC's wish that I'd die
Never retire or put my mic on the shelf
The baddest rapper in the history of rap itself
Not bitter or mad, just provin' I'm bad
You want a hit? Give me a hour plus a pen and a pad!
MC's retreat, cause they know I can beat 'em
And eat 'em in a battle and the ref won't cheat 'em
I'm the baddest! Takin' out all rookies
So forget Oreos, eat Cool J cookies, I'm bad!
Cool J, Cool J,Cool J,Cool J, Cool J,Cool J

[Verse 4]
Never ever no never
Never wearin' no Levis, battle me why try?
I'll treat you like a stepchild so tell mommy ""bye bye""
Slaughterin' MC's and I'mma never get whipped
When I retire I'll get worshipped like a old battleship
LL I'm bad, all the rappers know
When I enter the center they say, 'Yo, yo there he go!'
My paycheck's large Mr. Bogart in charge
Not a puncher or hunter from a raccoon lodge
The original Todd, teachin' how to be hard
Take the skin off a snake, and split a pea from a pod
You're a novice I'm noble and I decipher my tongue
Not Attila the Hun, nor Abdullah his son
My vocals exact, like rack and pinion in a Jag
You try to brag, you get your rhymes from a grab-bag
No good scavenger, catfish vulture
My tongue's a chisel and this composition's sculpture, I'm bad!

[Outro]
(Think I'm gonna need backup)
(Think I'm gonna need backup)

Gimme that walkie-talkie!
Yo this is LL Cool J
And you'll never catch me so don't even try it
Cause I'm too bad for ya, understand?!
Aaaaaahhhh... I'm bad!"
Remember the Name,Fort Minor,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
You ready? Let's go!
Yeah!
For those of you that wanna know what we're all about
It's like this, y'all, c'mon!

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name (Mike!)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
He doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard, whether it's the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
But fuck 'em, he knows the code, it's not about the salary
It's all about reality and making some noise
Making a story, making sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down, Tak's picking it up, let's go
[Verse 2: Tak]
Who the hell is he, anyway? He never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leaving 'em star-struck
Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
That many misjudge him 'cause he makes a living from writing raps
Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never asking for someone's help (Help), or to get some respect ('Spect)
He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
And now it all unfolds to the skill of an artist

[Verse 3: Ryu]
This is twenty percent skill (Uh), eighty percent beer
Be a hundred percent clear, 'cause Ryu is ill (Next)
Who would've thought he'd be the one to set the west in flames
Then I heard him wreck it with The Crystal Method ""Name of the Game"" (Uh-huh)
Came back, dropped ""Megadef,"" took 'em to church
I like ""Bleach"", man, Ryu had the stupidest verse (Ha-ha)
This dude is the truth, now, everybody giving him guest spots
His stock's through the roof, I heard he fucking with S. Dot

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name
[Verse 4: Ryu]
They call him Ryu the Sick, and he's spitting fire with Mike
Got him out the dryer, he's hot, found him in Fort Minor with Tak
What a fucking nihilist, porcupine, he's a prick, he's a cock
The type women wanna be with and rappers hope he gets shot
Eight years in the making, patiently waiting to blow
Now, the record with Shinoda's taking over the globe
He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope
You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat

[Verse 5: Tak]
Tak, he's not your everyday on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got, making his way to the top
He often gets a comment on his name, people keep asking him
""Was it given at birth or does it stand for an acronym?""
No, he's living proof (Proof), got him rocking the booth
He'll get you buzzing quicker than a shot of vodka with juice (Juice)
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they do and give a hundred percent

[Verse 6: Mike Shinoda]
Forget Mike, nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note and he writes every line
And I've seen him at work, when that light goes on in his mind
It's like a design is written in his head, every time
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
And those motherfuckers he runs with, the kids that he signed?
Ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?
[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

Up all night with college hoes, edibles and bong hits
This just ain't no song shit, do this for my city Joe
But to get my city on, had to let me city go
Shout outs to my Philly hoes, told her drop that eagle low
Called that bitch my quaterback, wild cat all that

From where they take them old beats and turn em into news
You can end this verse premature
But I got skeptics and some fans that just be needing more

And you’re girl working out, I let my niggas train her
You Tim Tebow ass niggas probably still gater
I chump chump pussy if it smell good to me
And I don’t do nothing to her but she do it to me

Let's go... uhh, uh, uhh, uh, uhh, uh
Turn the music up in the headphones
Uh, yeah, that's perfect (yeah, right, right)
Uhh, uh, you gotta take ya time, make a nigga wait on this muh'fucka (hahaha!)

I feel like a Black Republican, money I got comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah)
Probably end up back in the hood, like, ""Fuck it then""
[Verse 1: Jay-Z (Nas)]
Huddlin' over the oven, we was like brothers then (what?)
Though you was nothin' other than a son of my mother's friend
We had covenant, who would've thought the love would end?
Like Ice Cold's album (uhh), all good things
Never thought we sing the same song that all hoods sang
Thought it was all wood-grain, all good brain
We wouldn't bicker like the other fools, talk good game
Never imagine all the disaster that one good reign, could bring
Should blame, the game, and I could
It's kill or be killed, how could I refrain?
And forever be in debt, and that's never a good thing
So the pressure for success can put a good strain
On a friend you call best, and yes it could bring
Out the worst in every person, even the good and sane
Although we rehearsed it, it just ain't the same
When you put in the game at age sixteen
Then you mix things: like cars, jewelry, and Miss Thing
Jealousy, ego, and pride, and this brings
It all to a head like a coin, cha-ching
The root of evil strikes again, this could sting
Now the team got beef between the Post and the Point
This puts the ring in jeopardy – indefinitely

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Nas]
I feel like a black republican, money I got comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them (uhh, uhh)
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah)
Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, ""Fuck it then""
I feel like a black militant takin' over the government
Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them (nah)
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him
Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, ""Fuck it then""
[Verse 2: Nas (Jay-Z)]
I'm back in the hood, they like, ""Hey Nas"" (uh)
Blowin' on purp, reflectin' on they lives (uh)
Couple of fat cats, couple of A.I.'s
Dreamin' of fly shit instead of them gray skies
Gray 5s, hatah's wishin' our reign dies
Pitch, sling pies, and niggas they sing, ""Why""? (uhh)
Guess they ain't strong enough to handle their jail time
Weak minds keep tryin', follow the street signs
I'm standing on the roof of my building
I'm feelin' the whirlwind of beef, I inhale it
Just like an acrobat ready to hurl myself, through the hoops of fire
Sippin' 80 proof, bulletproof under my attire
Could it be the forces of darkness
Against hood angels of good, that form street politics?
Makes a sweet honest kid, turn illegal for commerce (uhh)
To get his feet out of them Converse – that's my word

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Nas]
I feel like a black republican, money keep comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them (uhh, uhh)
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah)
Probably end up back in the hood, ah, ""Fuck it then""
I feel like a black militant takin' over the government
Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him
Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, ""Fuck it then"""

[Part 1]
Komm' ausm Club, war schön gewesen
Stinke nach Suff, bin kaputt, is' 'n schönes Leben
Steig' über Schnapsleichen, die auf meinem Weg verwesen
Ich seh' die Ratten sich satt fressen im Schatten der Dönerläden
Stapf' durch die Kotze am Kotti, Junks sind benebelt
Atzen rotzen in die Gegend, benehm' sich daneben
Szene-Schnösel auf verzweifelter Suche nach der Szene
Gepiercte Mädels, die wollen, dass ich ""Straßenfeger"" lese, uh!
Halb sechs, meine Augen brenn'
Tret' auf 'n Typen, der zwischen toten Tauben pennt
Hysterische Bräute keifen und haben Panik, denn
An der Ecke gibt es Stress zwischen Tarek und Sam
Tarek sagt, ""Halt's Maul oder ich werd' dir ins Gesicht schlagen""
Sam hat die Hosen voll, aber kann auch nicht nichts sagen -
Die rote Suppe tropft auf den Asphalt
Mir wird schlecht, ich mach' die Jacke zu denn es ist kalt

[Hook 1]
Guten Morgen Berlin
Du kannst so hässlich sein, so dreckig und grau
Du kannst so schön schrecklich sein
Deine Nächte fressen mich auf
Es wird für mich wohl das Beste sein
Ich geh' nach Hause und schlaf' mich aus
Und während ich durch die Straßen lauf'
Wird langsam schwarz zu blau
[Bridge]
Müde Gestalten im Neonlicht
Mit tiefen Falten im Gesicht
Die Frühschicht schweigt, jeder bleibt für sich
Frust kommt auf, denn der Bus kommt nicht

[Part 2]
Und überall liegt Scheiße, man muss eigentlich schweben
Jeder hat 'n Hund, aber keinen zum Reden
Ich atme ständig durch den Mund, das ist Teil meines Lebens
Ich fühl' mich ungesund, brauch' was reines dagegen
Ich hab 'n dicken Kopf, ich muss 'n Saft haben
Ich hab dringlichen Bock auf ""Bagdads Backwaren""
Da ist es warm, da geb' ich mich meinen Träumen hin
Bei Fatima, der süßen Backwarenverkäuferin
R'n'B-Balladen pumpen aus'm parkenden Benz
Feierabend für die Straßengangs
Ein Hooligan liegt 'ner Frau in den Armen und flennt
Diese Stadt ist eben doch gar nicht so hart wie du denkst

[Hook 1]
Guten Morgen Berlin
Du kannst so hässlich sein, so dreckig und grau
Du kannst so schön schrecklich sein
Deine Nächte fressen mich auf
Es wird für mich wohl das Beste sein
Ich geh' nach Hause und schlaf' mich aus
Und während ich durch die Straßen lauf'
Wird langsam schwarz zu blau
[Hook 2]
Ich bin kaputt und reib' mir aus
Meinen Augen deinen Staub
Du bist nicht schön und das weißt du auch
Dein Panorama versaut
Siehst nicht mal schön von Weitem aus
Doch die Sonne geht gerade auf
Und ich weiß, ob ich will oder nicht
Dass ich dich zum Atmen brauch'"
I Got a Story to Tell,The Notorious B.I.G.,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'alternative']","[Intro]
Who y'all talkin' to, man?
Ugh
Check it out, check it out
This here goes out to all the niggas that be fuckin' mad bitches
In other niggas' cribs
Thinkin' shit is sweet
Nigga creep up on your ass, hahaha
Live niggas respect it—check it

[Verse]
I kicked flows for you, kicked down doors for you
Even left all my motherfuckin' hoes for you
Niggas think Frankie pussy-whipped
Nigga, picture that, with a Kodak, Insta-mat-tac
We don't get down like that, lay my game down quite flat
""Sweetness, where you parked at?""
Petiteness, but that ass fat
She got a body make a nigga wanna eat that—
I'm fuckin' with you
The bitch official, though; dick harder than a missile, yo
Try to hit it, if she trippin', disappearin' like Arsenio
Yo, the bitch push a double-O with the five in front
Probably a conniving stunt
Y'all drive in front, I'ma peel with her
Find the deal with her, she fuck around and steal, huh?
Then we all get laced
Televisions, Versace heaven, when I'm up in 'em
The shit she kicked—all that shit's legit
She get dick from a player off the New York Knicks
Nigga trick ridiculous, the shit was plush
She's stressing me to fuck, like she was in a rush
We fucked in his bed, quite dangerous
I'm in his ass while he playing 'gainst the Utah Jazz
My 112 CD blast, I was past
She came twice, I came last, roll the grass
She giggle, saying, ""I'm smoking on homegrown""
Then I heard a moan, ""Honey, I'm home!""
Yup, tote chrome for situations like this
I'm up in his broad, I know he won't like this
Now I'm, like, ""Bitch, you better talk to him
Before this fifth put a spark to him
Fuck around, shit get dark to him, put a part through him
Lose a major part to him—arm, leg...""
She beggin' me to stop, but this cat gettin' closer
Gettin' hot like a toaster, I cock the toast, ugh
Before my eyes could blink
She screams out, ""Honey, bring me up somethin' to drink!""
He go back downstairs, more time to think
Her brain racing, she's telling me to stay patient
She don't know I'm cool as a fan
Gat in hand, I don't wanna blast her man
But I can and I will, though; I'm tryna chill, though
Even though situation looking kinda ill, yo
It came to me like a song I wrote
Told the bitch, ""Gimme your scarf, pillowcase, and rope""
Got dressed quick, tied the scarf around my face
Roped the bitch up, gagged her mouth with the pillowcase
Played the cut, nigga coming off some Love Potion shit
Flash the heat on 'em, he stood emotionless
Dropped the glass, screaming, ""Don't blast, here's the stash!
A hundred cash! Just don't shoot my ass, please!""
Nigga pulling mad G's out the floor
Put stacks in a Prada knapsack, hit the door
Grab the keys to the Five, call my niggas on the cell
""Bring some weed, I got a story to tell,"" ugh, ugh
[Outro]
""Yo, man, y'all niggas ain't gon' believe what the fuck happened to me. 'Member that bitch I left the club with, man?""
""Yeah.""
""Yo, stinky, yo. I'm up in this bitch crib—this bitch fuck with one of them ol' Knick-ass niggas and shit. I'm up in the spot, so, you know—""
""Who, God?""
""I don't know, I don't know which one of them niggas. One of them six-five niggas, I don't know.""
""Yeah.""
""Anyway, I'm up in the motherfuckin' spot. So, boom, I'm up in the pussy, whatever-whatever. I sparks up some lah, Pa Duke creeps up in on some...""
""Get the fuck out!""
""Must have been rained out or something, because he's in the spot.""
""Get the fuck out of here! Oh, shit!""
""Had me scared, had me scared to death! I was shook, Daddy. But I forget I had my Roscoe on me.""
""Ah, yeah, I know you had the heat!""
""Always.""
""Hahahaha.""
""You know how we do. So anyway, the nigga comes up the stairs, he creepin' up the steps. The bitch all shook—she sends the nigga back downstairs to get some drinks and shit.""
""Ooh, shit!""
""She gettin' mad nervous. But I said, 'Fuck that man! I'm the nigga!'""
""I know you was finna clap 'em.""
Yeah, nigga. You know how we do it, nigga—ransom note-style. Put the scarf around my motherfuckin' face
""Aight!""
""Gagged that bitch up, and played the cizzut.""
""Ahahaha!""
""Soon as this nigga comes up in the spot, I flash the Desert in his face. He drops the glass. Looked like the nigga pissed on his damn self or somethin, word to my mother! Word to my mother, yo.""
""Ah, shit!""
""This nigga runs dead to the floor, peels up the carpet, start givin' me mad papers. Mad papers.""
""Oh, shit, what? Yo, I told you that bitch was a scheisty bitch, cuz! Word to mother, I used to fuck with her cousin, but you ain't know that!""
""Hahaha.""
""You ain't even know that shit! Really, though.""
""I put all that motherfuckin' money up in the Prada knapsack, and, ugh! Two words: 'I'm gone!'""

Let's do it!
Santana, Jim Jones, Killa, Freekey
How long we gon' have this shit on lock, man?
Yes sir, you gave me the right track Kanye

[Verse 1]
Listen, I been coppin' them P's and
Maybe that's part of the reason
I feel like a boxer: bobbin' and weavin'
But I'm gettin' head, she's bobbin' her weave and (yes sir)
I'm grabbin' her neck to stop her from breathin'
I'ma wild out until I part with my breathin'
Until I'm sparked up and leakin', part of the cement
I need somethin' pure, like from the Garden of Eden (why?)
Wouldn't mind makin' her part of my achievements (what happened)
'Cause when music discourage my pride (who was there?)
Zeek, the only one with courage to ride
The ride's so dirty inside, seems like we were playin' in mud
Hazin' it up, grams, gauge and a snub
Who ill? A check for two mil'
And a cheap case, defaced, blue steel, true skills
I got stories that my soul can sing
Flip water like Poland Spring and I'ma hold them things
[Break]
Forever
That's right y'all
Diplomats y'all, we here
Forever, yea-yeah
That's forever, man

[Verse 2]
Look, talk to 'em
Look, my fella said you been coppin' a lot
Latest caper? Propellers on top of the drop
But fuck it, who ever thought I would rock at the Roc? (Killa!)
Top a top on top of the top
But yo - nothing definite, I chop up the rocks
And I stop up the drop, Blocka Blocka the block
Hello mate, yellow tape, helicopter your spot
What you wanted is not what you got
And I pop up them cops
'Cause dog, it ain't about Cam (it ain't about me)
I got a son homeboy, it's about Cam (for that?)
It's about being 'bout It
If you're not, you're ass backwards
My mathematics cause cash matters (that's important)
Little niggas need to sit up and breathe
If the town too hot, get up and leave
Niggas always got a trick up their sleeve (always)
Nigga like me - I always got a brick up my sleeve
And that's for-e-ver, Killa!
[Break]
Forever
Jim Jones, Freekey, Santana, we here, we here
Forever, yea-yeah
I got it Guru (let's wrap it up man)

[Verse 3]
Shit, I was two blocks from coppin' dust
I used to hop the bus
Now look dog, ain't nobody hot as us
Girls, they gotta rush, shit, they gotta blush
Wanna go in the mall just to shop with us
To how they piss and, bitch, how they ran a mile
Fuck Killa Cam, they in love with Cameron Giles
Damn, I gotta smile, hundred grand, I demand it
Goddamn it, the boy the boy done done it, child
And that's forever, man

[Outro]
You hear it, uh huh
We here, I love y'all man
It's nothing boy
Dash, Hoffa, Young Guru
What's really good?
Holla at your boy
I might have this shit on lock man
Kanye, Harlem, Chicago, Columbus - holla
Chicago, you have your own Kanye West on the track
Harlem, you know who the fuck I am - Killa!
We just want you's to know Diplomats is here
We ain't going nowhere
Holla at the boy-boy, let's ride out man"
Westside Story,The Game,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: The Game]
Crip niggas, Blood niggas, eses, Asians
Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, white boys, Jamaicans
Latin Kings, Disciples, Vice Lords, Haitians
All these motherfuckers been patiently waitin'

[Verse 1: The Game]
Since the West Coast fell off, the streets been watching
The West Coast never fell off, I was 'sleep in Compton
Aftermath been here, the beats been knocking
Nate Dogg doing his thing, DPG still popping
I got ""California Love,"" fuckin' bitches to that 'Pac shit
And Westside Connection been had it locked, bitch
I'm in the rear-view, my guns is cocking
I put red dots on a nigga head like Rodman
All Stars, fat laces, gun charge, court cases
Fought that, not guilty, I'm back, niggas hate me
Been there, done that, sold crack, got jacked
Got shot, came back, jumped on Dre's back
Payback, homie, I'm bringing C.A. back
And I don't do button-up shirts or drive Maybachs
All you old record labels tryna advance
Aftermath bitch, take it like a motherfucking man
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
If you take a look in my eyes
See I'll be a gangsta 'til I die
That California chronic got me so high
Game, tell 'em where you from (Nigga, Westside!)
If you take a look in my eyes
See I'll be a gangsta 'til I die
That California chronic got me so high
Game tell 'em where you from (Nigga, Westside!)

[Verse 2: The Game]
I'm low-riding, homie, six-trey Impala
Gold Ds spinning, chrome hydraulics
Run up on my lo-lo, you stop breathing
Hollow tips make niggas disappear like Houdini
Gangbanging is real, homie, I'm living proof
Like Snoop Dogg C-walking on top of the Devil's roof
Rap critics wanna converse about this and that
'Cause red strings in his Converse, and this a Dre track
Keep gibbering and jabbing, I pull the .38 Magnum
And get to clickin' and clacking
Your homies wanna know what happened
Come to Compton, see Thriller like Mike Jackson
I might be Spike Lee of this gun clappin'
Prior to rapping, I was drug trafficking
In the dope spot, playing John Madden
Homie, I ain't bragging, I took five
You wanna die? Run up on that black 7-45
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
If you take a look in my eyes
See I'll be a gangsta 'til I die
That California chronic got me so high
Game, tell 'em where you from (Nigga, Westside!)
If you take a look in my eyes
See I'll be a gangsta 'til I die
That California chronic got me so high
Game tell 'em where you from (Nigga, Westside!)

[Verse 3: The Game]
New York, New York, big city of dreams
I got my L.A. Dodger fitted on, I'm doing my thing
Got me fucking with G-Unit, you know the drama that bring
I got niggas in Westside Compton and Southside Queens
And Buck told me in Cashville, I'm good when I come through
So I ain't gotta tuck in my chain like DJ Pooh
I'm gangsta—more like Deebo when he was Zeus
Play Bishop, I paint that picture, now, who got the juice?
You niggas is Nutso, I'll take off your roof
Leave your ass stretched out like a Cadillac coupe
God gotta let me in Heaven, all the shit I've been through
I was a O.G. in the hood before I turned twenty-two
Homie, I let the .38 special rip through that vest
And I don't contemplate whether not he left his shit on the dresser
Got Compton on my back, I'm starting to feel the pressure
I'm lyrically Kool G. Rap on these Dre records
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
If you take a look in my eyes
See I'll be a gangsta 'til I die
That California chronic got me so high
Game, tell 'em where you from (Nigga, Westside!)
If you take a look in my eyes
See I'll be a gangsta 'til I die
That California chronic got me so high
Game tell 'em where you from (Nigga, Westside!)"

Super cool, super mean

I'm the hottest nigga you heard in a long time
Introducing you to the hottest nigga you've heard in a long time

Mega pimp, super clean, the coolest in the universe
Niggas hatin' on what he doin', just mad cause they ain't do it first
His name pop up when you hit ""playa"" on ya Google search
Bitches bow they heads and bend they knees, just like they do in church
Drop dough into a purse, before you get into a skirt
She agree to do the work, before she get into the purp
'Til my pine box drop down into the dirt
I'mma be by far the hottest nigga known to the earth
In the air I fly can't compare, my swagger to another rapper don't you dare try
Anyone wit a pair of eyes can look and see, no legacy, will ever be, next to me or nothin' near by
Though I invite you all to try, ay, I'mma a fair guy
Just approach with caution, be aware, cause I don't share my...throne
My crown I own, hottest flow on any song I'm on I'm gone nigga!

Grand Hustle Niggaaaaa!

If I ain't the hottest nigga on the mutha fuckin universe, I guess I'll just have to do 'til he get here nigga!

Here I go

I'm that nigga that you heard about through word of mouth
They probably said I change the music in the dirty south
Now that the word is out
The timing is perfect now
To take all these hypocritical rumors and burn em down
If you observe the doubt you would see what they worried bout
They say I sound like Dre when I'm rapping my verses now
Honestly, I could give a fuck what you blurtin' out
Point blank,I'm in the game...rockin' my jersey now
So just accept me or don't pay me no mind
Either way you gonna be hearin' me all of the time
Whether on Greg street, or 107.9
Or on yo favorite rap blog, on yo rap website
And if that ain't right, then show me straight to the judge
Just like Bryan Nichols I ain't spittin', nothin' but slugs
Venomous blood in my veins
Chemicals up in my brain
Yes I resemble a criminal
B.o.Bizzle, you ain't fuckin' wit mane!
Ahhh!

[Outro: T.I.] + (B.o.B)
Okay, you got that (I'm gone, mayne
I kinda, I kinda feel like I got you, man)
Hehehe (I had to kinda show you up, man
I ain't really wanna make you look bad, really, honestly)
Ay, man, aye man that laughing, that laugh is natural
Because I'm literally amused by your sentiment
I mean if you really feel that, know what I'm sayin
That the likes of the second verse can even
Slightly compare with the immaculate (Hahaha)
Then I must take a chuckle...Hahaha
You know what I'm saying, but never no mind
(We can have em blog about it)
Absolutely, man, I'll let you guys be the judge
(You know you gonna do it anyway, fuck it)
B.o.B or T.I.P. Know what I'm saying, you be the judge, dog

The first album I vomited, the second I colonic’d it
Ain't nobody fucking with me, I Platonic’d it
Bet I got some slippers on, bet niggas gon' honor it
These ain't even real clothes, homie, I’m pajama-rich
Banks told me, ""Homie, go'n, switch the style up""
These bitches on me homie only to arouse us
Told her, I ain't paying tonight, I’m only browsing
She pulled her blouse up, said, “It’s free,” I said, ""Wowzers!""
Wowzers! Yeah

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Plenty hate, they be taking shots, never penetrate
Money generated, if we ain't in the house, renovate
Tryna eat, we ain't finna wait, where’s the dinner plates?
B-M-W, 10 to 8, Interstate
95, passenger, baddest bitch in the states
Half Spanish, half Trini-dae, complexion Henny straight
Y’all ain't got your business straight, track star, finna state
Time is money and I can’t afford to be a minute late (Nice!)
It’s time to make a movie, let the haters watch
Diamonds spinning round the bezel; that's tornado watch
My independent chick, I like my ladies Koch
She got an appetite for dick, I guess her plate's my crotch
Y'all soft as tater-tot, lil niggas, try me not
Under the wings, fried rice at the Chinese spot
I hear ‘em talking it but ain't really living it
Opinions are like assholes, so who gives a shit?

Were All in the Same Gang,The West Coast Rap All Stars,['hip hop'],"[Intro]
Gun is Cocked and Fired
I'm King News and I come to you with the truth
The mean streets took six more lives overnight
All the result of gang-bang stupidity
By the way, you gangsters should know
One of your victims was a three-year-old girl
Well, you gang members, you still don't get it, do ya?

(With your bad self)

[Verse 1: King Tee]
It's straight up madness everywhere I look
Used to be a straight A student, now he's a crook
Robbing people just to smoke or shoot up
Used to have a crew cut, now he's a pooh-butt
Dropped out of school and he joins the neighborhood gang
Hanging on the streets selling 'caine
To his own people
Now when I say people I mean color
You a stupid mother-
I'm trying to stress the fact that you're dumb
Get yourself presentable, son, and just come
Together, you better, cause pretty soon it's gonna be too late
A message from King Tee The Great
[Verse 2: Body & Soul]
Sisters, since we are the mothers of this earth
It's time we start being good mothers from the birth
Of our children, no time for sleeping
Teach them to fight and win for the right reason
It's your time, it's your life, live it
Proud to be black, young and gifted
Lifted by the knowledge and taking the right route
Gang violence needs to be wiped out
A-L-M-I-G-H-Ty and E-Z-I-R-E
We see the F-U-T-U-R-E
Should be a positive thing
Body & Soul and you, we're in the same gang

[Verse 3: Def Jef]
One and the same
Everyone came in the same chains
Caught with the same aim
Brain games and names changed
To protect the innocent by-stander
Lies, slander and the master-planner
Destroy the black male
Crack jail and semi-automatic
For static if the crack fails
So since we all talk the same slang
Stop killin, my brother, cause we're all from the same gang
[Chorus: Michel'le]
Don't you know we've got to put our heads together?
Make the change cause we're all in the same gang

[Verse 4: Tone-Loc]
Now as a youth I used to get my bang on
And on the ave get my part-time slang on
Doing time for me was no joke though
They knew I was crazy, so they labelled me Loco
Khakis creased, golf hat, feelin sporty
Low ridin and tossin up a forty
Thinkin in my mind that no one could handle us
The downest brothers ever touched Los Angeles
I found life was much more suitable
Cause I'm the brother that makes black so beautiful
I ain't slippin or down with a head trip
I'm talkin to all the Bloods and all the Crips
Throw down your rag and get on the right track, man
It's time to fight, unite and be a black man
Tone-Loc is on a positive change
Cause remember, we're all in the same gang

[Verse 5: Above The Law]
Bein' the pimps that we are
We're here to speak on a situation that has gone too far
Here at home in the ghettos of LA
Where a young black brother's not promised to see the next day
Cause we used to clock on the streets before we made beats
But fools just lay and prey on the weak
It don't depend on the color of a rag
Cause if you got what they want you know they gonna take what you have
Cause violence don't only revolve from drugs and thugs
And gangs that bang
Most times it's a political thang
Yeah, a couple of spots'll get popped
And if the government wanted to freeze it it could all get stopped
But they don't because they want it like that
Because the system been set up to hold us back
Yeah, Above The Law means that we can do whatever
So why don't we stick together?
(You got it)
[Verse 6: Ice-T; Hen-G]
Ice-T rippin the microphone the way I do
Listen close, my brothers, cause I'm talkin to you
The problem is we got a suicidal lifestyle
Cause 90 percent of us are livin foul and wild
I say ""job"", you say ""bad joke
I'd rather jack another brother, watch the gun smoke""
Livin in the fast lane flippin like you're insane
You won't stop until your blood runs down the street drain
I got an idea, give me a minute
And if it makes sense, then get with it
What if we could take our enemies, feed em poison
Undereducate their girls and boys and
Split em up, make em fight one another
Better yet, make em kill for a color
All my brothers need to know one thing
No matter what you think, we're all in the same gang

[Chorus]
Don't you know we've got to put our heads together?
Stop the fighting
(Make the change)
Because we're all in the same gang

[Verse 7: Dr. Dre and MC Ren]
Yo, we're not here to preach because we're not ministers
We're telling like it is cause Ren and Dre is like sinister
Reality speaks for itself when it's spoken
A basehead cluck can't blame nobody for smoking
Yo, bullets flying, mothers crying, brothers dying
Lying in the streets, that's why we're trying
To stop it from falling apart and going to waste
And keeping a smile off of white face
N.W.A never preaching, just teaching
The knowledge of the streets to each and
All that don't understand, that's why we came
To let you know that we're all in the same gang

[Verse 8: JJ Fad]
The J double, F, the a, the d, that is
And if you want the solution to the quiz
What's black and black, yo, and kills another?
An ignorant sucker that isn't labelled as a brother
But another
So now it's time we evolve
And get together and solve it
Cause the world is revolvin
Around a terrible situation
One will kill another for a reputation
So it's time we stop and realize that we're all the same
Yo Train, tell em (We're all in the same gang)

[Verse 9: Young MC]
Brothers killin' other brothers
I thought the idea was to love one another?
Open up the paper to one more death
If y'all keep this up then there'll be no one left
I try my best to set an example
Sayin hype lyrics over hip-hop samples
Not just a brag or to boast but to inform
Cause we're livin in the calm before the storm
You see, I believe that the children are the future
But what's it all about if in the future they shoot ya?
We're all human beings, if we're cut we'll bleed
And I want to see all young people succeed
Do 9 to 5, not 5 to 10
Just go to work and not the state pen
Cause you live better when you're out there free
And that's comin straight to ya from the Young MC

[Verse 10: Digital Underground]
I'm in a rage
Oh yeah? Yo, why is that G?
Other races, they say we act like rats in a cage
I tried to argue, but check it, every night in the news
We prove them suckers right and I got the blues
America
Get busy, Humpty
The red, the white, the blue and
The blue and the red
For Crips and Bloods
The white for who's got you doin
Time bustin caps on one another
The Underground's down for peace among brothers
Kill a black man?
What?
Yo, what are you retarded?
Tell em, Hump
Yo, do you work for the Klan?
Do what ya like
Unless you like gangbangin
Let's see how many brothers leave us hangin

[Verse 11: Oaktown's 3.5.7.]
The gang that should hang is the one that contains
The sisters and the brothers who are all in the same frame of mind
Now listen, get loose, it's unity time
Yeah, yeah
Peace is a presence that we all need
The future's in our hands, in word and deed
I'm Terrible T and I'm Sweet LD
We're 3.5.7. totally

[Verse 12: MC Hammer]
Kickin on the ave 'bout a quarter to 9
All the homies gettin blind in an eight ball line
Now on this tip they started runnin at the lip
Jumped in their deuce and took a little trip
Hit the block about 12 on the tick
The windows went down and the nines went click
People started yellin, bodies started bailin
Bullets cold flyin sendin some to hell and
It's gotta stop, we don't need all the violence
Peace in the hood and a moment of silence
We got together not for ego or fame
We got involved cause we're all in the same gang

[Verse 13: Eazy-E]
Last but not least, yo, Eazy's no sell-out
And if you can't hang in the streets, then get the hell out
I'm not tryin to tell ya what to do
You have your own freedom of choice who to listen to
You knew good from bad, fair from foul, right from wrong
Now your mother's singing that sad song
(My baby ain't never hurt nobody!)
But he still got smoked at BeBe's party
But you're not the first or the last
You're nothin but a short story from the past
You're dead now, not number one but a zero
Take notes from Eazy-E, the violent hero

[Chorus]
Don't you know we've got to put our heads together?
Don't you know we've got to put our heads together?"
The Show Goes On,Lupe Fiasco,['hip hop'],"[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
LA-SER
Yeah, yeah
Kane is in the building, nigga

Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up, the show goes on
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up, the show goes on

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Have you ever had the feelin' that you was bein' had?
Don't that shit there make you mad? They treat you like a slave
Put chains all on your soul and put whips up on your back
They be lyin' through they teeth, hope you slip up off your path
I don't switch up, I just laugh (Ha ha) put my kicks up on they desk
Unaffected by they threats, then get busy on they ass
See that's how that Chi-Town made me
That's how my daddy raised me
That glitterin' may not be gold, don't let nobody play me
If you are my homeboy, you never have to pay me
Gon' and put your hands up, when times is hard, you stand up
L-U-P the man, 'cause the brand that the fans trust
So even if they ban us, they'll never slow my plans up
[Chorus: JR Get Money]
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long

Just remember when you come up, the show goes on
Alright, already, the show goes on

Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up, the show goes on

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
One in the air for the people ain't here
Two in the air for the father that's there
Three in the air for the kids in the ghetto
Four for the kids that don't wanna be there
None for the niggas tryna hold them back
Five in the air for the teachers not scared
To tell those kids that's livin' in the ghetto
That the niggas holdin' back that the world is theirs
Yeah, yeah, the world is yours, I was once that little boy
Terrified of the world, now I'm on a world tour
I would give up everything, even start a world war
For these ghetto girls and boys I'm rappin' round the world for
Africa to New York, Haiti then I detour
Oakland out to Auckland, Gaza Strip to Detroit
Say hip-hop only destroy, tell 'em look at me, boy
I hope your son don't have a gun and never be a d-boy
[Chorus: JR Get Money]
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up, the show goes on
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up, the show goes on

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
So no matter what you been through, no matter what you into
No matter what you see when you look outside your window
Brown grass or green grass, picket fence or barbed wire
Never ever put them down, you just lift your arms higher
Raise 'em 'til your arms tired, let 'em know you here
That you strugglin', survivin', that you gon' persevere
Yeah, ain't nobody leavin', nobody goin' home
Even if they turn the lights out, the show is goin' on, alright

[Chorus: JR Get Money]
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up, the show goes on
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up, the show goes on"
We Can Do It Now,Lupe Fiasco,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","[Jennifer Hudson]
Guess I gotta forget all about this issue
And try to live my life just like it is
Whooa
But I want everybody to remember me (everybody)
I will come back 10 years ago (well, hey)
Said I want everybody to remember me
When I go back 10 years and years ago
When I get my second chance

[Lupe Fiasco]
When I get my second chance I’m gon' redeem myself
When I bring myself, me and my team my help
Ain't no “I” in that but I’m in that so I am packed
Like there's ten of me inside of that
Ain't one man army, one man army I am that
Bring it back like a typer-writer, writing that
I attack like a lightning strike with a lions wrath
With a vipers bite come alive with that
Put your life on that
Like everything I do though
All my old wounds have all healed but they still feel like they new though
And everytime I see ‘em I start to think of you yo
First I wasn’t focused, wasn’t willing and my goon’s
So performance was just lackin at those moments that were crucial
Now my heart is razor sharp and confidence is MUCHO
Big, things I can’t forgive, things I can't forget
Things I can’t relive, the agony is asking me, defeat is sweet to sin
But I put that on my city we will never meet again
[Hook]
Never miss the city of the wind that I’m in
City of the wind that I’m in
We can do it now
We can do it now
We can do it now
We can do it we can do we can do it now
Second chance, second win, do it again
Yeah eah, eeeeah

Yeah we do it again
We can do it now
Lets do it again
We can do it now
Do it now

[Common]
The rise of the phoenix, sweat falls
Time has its meaning, I evolve
Hit the ground and bounce back up, just like B-Ball
Muhammad Ali jaw, I knew that I would be all
Far from where I came from, the same place that pain's from
My name hung, from the rafters before an aftermath of a master
Wishing I could have the moment to grab the trophy and glass of champagne
My locker rooms a cold place, LA got no gates
You mighta seen this man cry, that was just my old face
My soul waits redemption and intervention from a higher dimension
Inspire mission, no more hoping or wishing, conditions’ll change
Stickers say Barack on the range
I’m from the Chi’ too, now I’m Barack in the game
Came back and overcame, overstood the rain
More than just the fame, married to the game
Now I hold the reign

Showed your girlfriend my house she think I live in Italy
Just bought a jet I'm 'bout to take that bitch to L.A
Bitch I never met I'm 'bout to meet that bitch in L.A
Ooh, I'm feeling myself
I'm so fly shawty think I really fly stealth
I'm so paid shawty I could really buy stealths
And I'm feeling my belt, and I'm feeling my sneaks
'Cause I don't see them on anybody
Got the semi by me for anybody

Yeah, I'm from uptown, Eastside, I'm lighting up two blunts at one time

Fuck one time, fuck one time, fuck one time, thank God

The Ultimate Victory,Chamillionaire,['hip hop'],"[Intro]
I'mma thank you, when and what the album almost through
Thanks, I ain't never had a fan like you
Eazy E, Left Eye and Aaliyah too
Pac, Biggie, Hawk, Fat Pat and DJ Screw
I wanna thank you

Thanks for opening my eyes and helping me to realize
That tomorrow ain't promised, Gotta live your life to the fullest
What's life if you ain't enjoying it, Know what I'm talking bout?

[Verse]
My purpose really used to be so unclear
Science fiction with the swagger, it's so unreal
So fly that my nickname should be up here
Looking up is the only time when I appear
I'm a spartan, go ahead and throw your spear
Slap failure in the face and still show no fear
They say no show but I show like chea
The Champ's here, let the whole crowd know my cheer (Victory!)
The media, they write about you in the mask
Spread rumors about your life and break you is the task
I know one of my three publicists will ruin my chance
So let me let you know that I don't like you in advance
But I thank you and I extend their thanks too
To everybody saying stuff you know ain't true
You need to go and find god like Mase too
But just stay there with him and try and stay you
Getting away is important
I can pull a couple strings like a guitar hand
Better yet, bring out the whole guitar band
Grab green, we can swing somewhere like Tarzan
I swear to y'all, the rap game really making me sick
The record industry's your home then I came to prevent
Put some nonsense out and I bet ya this one will stick
Or put some real music out and I'm probably gonna catch a brick
Brick on top of brick, we'll build a house
To whoever said that I'm still filled with doubt
Told me I'm in the right hole and then sealed it out
Told me I'm on the right track and then killed my route
Ouch, you never miss a good thing til it's gone
Yeah, the flow is so fluid, it's like drinking a song
Don't get the track listing wrong, this ain't even a song
This is a beat that I must release therapy on
Everybody saying that they wanna see me successful
Came into the game but now I'm feeling let's go
Intimate moments never seem to be special
See the jet, you can bet I'm disappearing like presto
Alakazaam, I ain't mad at the fans
I ain't mad at the man they both scattered my brand
Never will understand what really matters to Cham
So matter of fact, the title is just a matter of plan (Victory!)
After revenge, it's the victory right
Well the final run's done and this the victory hype
Now that everybody's present and this victory night
Let me repaint the pic, they wasn't depicting me right
(Now what you mean?) Tell the world that I'm more than just a grill
Show you how to put ya hands on more than a wood wheel
If that's all you hearing, then let me just be for real
Take your contract, the hell with a record deal
Keep thinking I'm gonna lose if you want to
Been through ten times in life more than you gone through
That's why I always have to make the move on fools
Back on my feet like I got two gun shoes
Yeah, why you think Em probably going all crazy?
So why you think Britney Spears going bald baby?
Interview me, you think you know it all lady
I'm out of here, yeah but not before y'all pay me
Thank you
[Outro]
I appreciate it
You know I'm gonna use the power of respect and a million dollar check to do what I wanna do
And right now, I feel to take a vacation
A real vacation though, Haha)
This the outro, was gonna put it at the beginning
But this is what I say the moment after I'm winning

Thank you, Ultimate Victory"

Closest people to you hate, so I be rollin' solo (I'm creepin' on the low)
Creepin' on the low-low, creepin' on the low-low

Chokin', loc-in', never provokin'
But the trunk gon' get popped, and I'll open the door (Blaow!)
Blunts full of smoke, I be slower than slow (Whoa)
Feel like I'm trapped, and it's nowhere to go (Yeah)
So I just pull out the bazooka—BLAOW! Put a fuckin' hole in the floor (Oh)
Luda! I'm so dope with the flow
Trunk full of speakers, pocket full of dubs (Dubs)
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood-grain?
Grippin' on the wheel (Wheel), turn it, turn it
Blow another sack, I earned it, earned it
Blow another amp (Amp), pull another tramp (Tramp)
Light another blunt, burn it, burn it
Flame it up! (Hey!) Hear my flow? I changed it up (Hey!)
Everybody grab your gats and hold 'em
Load 'em, sock 'em, lock 'em, cock 'em, and aim it up (Blaow!)
Bang it up, off in the sky, catch me rollin' off in the ride (Yeah)
Twenty-six inches, leave 'em defenseless
Forty-five always tucked to the side (Ow!)
Open your eyes, see me cruising
'Cause I keep winnin' and these boys keep losin'
Plus, I'm the pimp of the year
Playas is hatin and hoes is choosin' (Yeah)

Still Countin My Cash,Chamillionaire,['hip hop'],"[Repeat - x2]
Chamillitary Mane... Are you ready?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah
A couple of clowns in the town, run around, they used to be down
But it's build, check what you speaking, watch how you're using your nouns
Can make a million from home, making moves from my lounge
Hard to play captain save her cause them dudes is usually drowned
If you gon' hate, you at least could wait til it get to the chorus
You my promotional team, them boys my biggest supporters
Reside in Houston but they pay me to make a switch like the oilers
Toured a crib like a tourist, my yard look like a forest
Time to get a Thesaurus, they at a loss for words
They can't pronounce what I'm in, they like ""All them cars is yers?""
I got cars with curves, treating all my cars like birds
The fleet is a flock and the engine starts like ""brrr""
Welcome to the place where the music is slowed and choppy
The writers that wrote about me
Said that I wouldn't sell and the major label was gonna drop me
I make money moves and the population is sure to copy
When I need a favour I'ma call Ben Franklin like I know you got me
[Hook]
Haters was hating, they thought that I wouldn't last
But I'm still on the grind, I can see why they mad
Cause I'm still countin' my cash (still countin' my cash)
I'm still countin' my cash (still countin' my cash)
I'm still countin' my cash (still countin' my cash)
I'm still countin' my cash so do the math
They knocking my hustle, they saw me coming up fast
But I'm still getting mine, can't do nothing but laugh
Cause I'm still countin' my cash (uh)
I'm still countin' my cash (still countin' my cash)
I'm still countin' my cash (still countin' my cash)
I'm still countin' my cash so do the math

[Verse 2]
This is for everyone who be acting like a Grammy made me a winner
My hunger did it so do me a favour and make me a dinner
Eating cakes at the lima, they gon' hate when you enter
Pockets swollen, I'm holding up monkey jeans with suspenders
None of these rappers is real, cause if you real then you dodging me
Ain't bumped into one that's even halfway as real from what I can see
I extend middle finger and don't extend an apology
Shows getting me paper, sales getting me property
Guess I'm good at monopoly, taking over the game
Trynna hold so much paper that my arms and shoulders just stain
Ain't smoking or drinking but I'm thinking what being sober will bring
You got a hangover in the morning but I'm hanging over in Spain
Fifty thousand through customs, I know you isn't accustomed
Cause money talks and your pockets look like an end of discussion
So hitting my head on the ceiling from money getting is nothing
I stand on top of my paper and probably get a concussion
I know the...
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Remember that little apartment, we was laughing at Martin
Now the Martin's the aft and the one we passing is pausing
And proper tags with bargains, the card is black what I'm charging
Grind out of this world, I'm chasing ground like a Martian
A hustler that really ball, your purchase is pretty small
Your money is minimal, my crib is a mini mall
And if it ain't really large, my bidness gon' get resolved
I feel like they fake and the boys is fighting for pennies dog

Yeah, I'm a hustler
Yeah, I'm a hustler
Yeah, see I'm a hustler
Gotta keep my hustle up
Yeah, I'm a hustler
Yeah, I'm a hustler
Yeah, see I'm a hustler
You know that I hustle for the
M-O-N-ey
M-O-N-ey
M-O-N-ey

I ain't even gotta say why (say why baby)
She asked me why I'm missing and I (I'm out on the grind)
Cause the reason is that I'm on my grind

Wont Let You Down,Chamillionaire,['hip hop'],"[Intro]
It seems that there's a deadly virus
That's sweeping through the urban community
The side effects cannot often be seen
Because your pockets will not turn green
Some thought that there was no vaccine
But it seems that we have a cure
Chamillitary Mayne
Get off your couch and go get it

[Hook: Kevin Cossom]
I'm up early in the morning thinking bout getting this money
All I know is I gotta get that paper
The hustlers told me that I gotta get it, get it
Now I'm gettin it the best way I know how
I won't let you down, won't let you down
I won't let you down, won't let you down

I'm up early than a mother, chasing mine cause I'm a hustler
Then tomorrow everything is gonna rewind
Only seven days a week and 24 hours a day
That ain't enough for me so I ain't wasting time
Cause only dreams come to sleepers and my life ain't getting cheaper
So you know them dollar signs, they on my mind
When they ask me where I'm goin? I say you already know
I'm bout to hit the streets and go and get what's mine
I won't let you down
Dreams of having finer things
Ridin blades and dreaming should
Make you wanna wake up and get it in real life
Than see the wood in your grip
If you slip and don't grab what you see then good
Only place that you gonna be or ever see gonna be the hood

Poor that word ain't no excuse, you know what it mean to me
It means you passing over opportunities repeatedly
Write it on a piece of paper, only thing I see is P
That paper, paper, paper chaser, better thing for me to be
Nah, my services ain't for free, make that money multiply
Early in the morning I be gone
Chase with me, it ain't gonna be no tie
Try to explain and give em game, I don't know why I even try
You do the same if you was I, but you are you so you gonna lie
Make em think that you got cash, tell them ladies you got slabs
Only thing you get is laughs, you can't even bring down half
Of the bill that's on that tab, only thing wrong with being broke
Is staying broke and making excuses bout it like there ain't no hope

I don't know how many times I gotta tell ya
In the hood, having no condition
I was having something
I remember it like it was yesterday
They was talking down on me and I lost a couple homies
I was getting mine while they used to play
They say I need to slow down
But I ain't slowing down for nothing
I don't wanna let the paper get away
So when I'm in the streets grindin
Ain't no need to be crying
The best way that you can help me is to pray
I won't let you down
Partners that was getting lazy
Females that was acting crazy
Then promoters that tried to play me
Mixtape labels that didn't pay me
My old homies that ain't around me
Dissing rappers that came to find me
Major labels that didn't sign me
Left all that nonsense behind me, I got paid

I won't let you down, won't let you down
I won't let you down

[Outro]
See, rich people ain't going to tell you how to get paid
And broke people act like they the richest people in the world
Always tellin people with money how to get money
Always spendin money that they thought they was gonna get
Always buying things they can't afford
Stop making excuses
If chronic smoke makes him sleepy
He's gonna tell ya he got chronic fatigue
If liquor makes him drowsy
He gonna say he got that Grey Goose disease
If women keep taking his money
He gonna tell ya he slipped off his sleeve
Whatever your weakness, stop making excuses please
You should not be in couch or in house, you should be in route
If you gotta ask where
Then that's the reason you ain't got nothing
You don't know how to listen, go get it"

I'm focused man
Tell Stoute to holla at me man
Uh, young Hova, ya heard?
Trackmasters, ya heard?

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yo, yes y'all and Jigga man be balling
Leave chicks pigeon-toed, some of them be crawling
Get the best of you whenever I put my all in
Have mamis calling for the Lord darling
Jigga Impallin' ass drop
Coupes with half the top, expose half my knot
Nigga mad when I brag about the cash I got
But I'm used to not having a lot
I'm from the gutter and uh
I ain't the type to ever chase your box
I'm the type to interior decorate the watch
I'm the type to sling heavy weight on the block
In every state like clockwork; Jigga's the hurt holla
[Verse 2: Mýa]
Lips are telling me yes
While you're kissing on my neck
Making me feel so
""Should I stay, should I go?""
I don't know
Your hot boy style drives me wild
But in the back of mind I know

[Chorus: Mýa]
Even though I wanna see
How you put that thang on me
I can't let you get the best of me
Even though I wanna see
How you put that thang on me
I can't let you get the best of me

Conversation like what?
Big thighs got you stuck
Feelings starting to show
Should I stay, should I go?
I don't know
You're driving me crazy
I wanna be your lady
But I got a man at home

Used to wheelie bicycles since I was six
High school crossover, waived away picks
Music is the same shit, gave away hits
So ma get it together or forget it forever
When I go at you hard I can get it through leather
You acting like Jigga can't get at whoever
Talking you got a man, okay ma...and?
That's high school making me chase you around for months
Have an affair, act like an adult for once
Plus my hand is up your skirt goddamn you flirt
What's a little me on top gon' hurt?
Maybe a little but
Pain is pleasure and pressure bust pipes
And you look like the 'I Like It Rough' type
We can crush tonight
Tell me what you like
I got a yellow bottle on a bucket of ice
Get right; Young Hova

Thinkin of a master plan
Cause ain't nuttin but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pockets, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper, but still comin up with lint
So I, start my mission, leave my residence
Thinkin how can I get some dead presidents
I need money, I used to see a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nuttin funny
Stop smilin, cause still don't nuttin move but the money
Cause now I've learned to earn cause I'm righteous
I feel great, so maybe I might just
Search fo' a 9 to 5, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street, whistlin this
Feelin out of place cause man do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Warren G, and a big fat plate of
Chicken wings, cause that's my favorite thang
But without no money man that shit's a dream
Cause I don't like to dream about gettin paid

But I'll hunt a duck nigga down like it's a sport
Front on me, I'll cut you, gun-butt you or buck you
You getting money, I can't get nothin' with ya, then fuck ya
I'm not the type to get knocked for DWI
I'm the type that'll kill your connect when the coke price rise
Gangstas, they bump my shit, them, they know me
I grew up around some niggas that's not my homies
Hundred G's, I stash it (What?), the MAC, I blast it (Yeah)

When the fifth kick, duck quick, it sound like thunder
In December, I'll make your block feel like summer
The rap critics say I can rhyme, the fiends say my dope is a nine
Every chick I fuck with is a dime
I'm like Patti LaBelle, homie, I'm on my own
Where I lay my hat's my home, I'm a rolling stone
Cross my path, I'll crush ya, thinking I won't touch ya

Now man, these pussy niggas puttin' money on my head
Go on and get your refund, motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt that ain't been found
I'm the underground king, and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, somethin' special happened every time
I'm the greatest, somethin' like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble, show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper, nigga, go 'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs

Sunny days wouldn't be special if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, ‘cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This is for my niggas on the block twistin' trees in cigars
For the niggas on lock doin' life behind bars
I don't say ""Only God can judge me,"" ‘cause I see things clear
Crooked-ass crackers will give my black-ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die, homie?

Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more

Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men

Every night I talk to God, but he don't say nothin' back
I know he protectin' me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares, niggas keep pullin' TECs on me
Psychic says some bitch done put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much when 'Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked
I ain't gon' spell it out for you mu'fuckas all the time
Are you illiterate, nigga? You can't read between the lines?
In the Bible, it says what goes around, comes around
""Hommo"" shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here for a real reason
‘Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'

Nigga, I'm high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I stay high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I'm high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)

Every time I roll up, niggas holla, ""Roll up!""
Then I tell 'em hold up, you ain't getting money
You ain't smoking in my Benzo, 20 inch Lorenzos
Smoking on indo, high as a motherfucker
I be on them backstreets, niggas know I clap heat
Only if you got beef, man, you better holla at me
Niggas get locked up, stabbed up, shot up
Every time I pop up, a lot going on in my hood
I shoot the dice, I holla get 'em girls, Daddy need new shoes
Daddy need Pirellis to look mean on 22's
Stash box, Xbox, laptop, fax machine, phone
Bulletproof this bitch and I'm gone
2003 Suburban swerving, too many sips of Henny
The D's sick, they searched the whip and they can't find the semis
They was just harassing me 'cause they know who I was

Now if you heard I done started some shit
It ain't because I be high (I be high, I be high)
And if you heard I done let off a clip
It ain't because I be high (I be high, I be high)
But I twist that lye, lye-lye-lye

[Verse 2]
I get high as I wanna, nigga
Go against me, for sure, you's a goner, nigga
I don't smoke to calm my nerves, but I got beef
Finna crush my enemies like I crush the hashish
If you love me, tell me you love me, don't stare at me, man
I'd hate to be in the pen for clapping one of my fans
Now let me show you how to greet me
When you meet me, when you see me
If you real, my nigga, you know how to holla ""G-Unit!""
There's no competition, it's just me

I'm high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)

[Verse 3]
Now, who you know besides me
Who write lines and squeeze nines
And have hoes in the hood sniffing on white lines?
You don't want me to be your kid's role model
I'll teach them how to buck them .380s and load up them hollows
Have shorty fresh off the stoop, ready to shoot
Big blunt in his mouth, deuce-deuce in his boot
Sit in the crib sipping Guinness watching Menace, then oh Lord
Have a young nigga bucking shit like he O-Dog
My team, they depend on me when it's crunch time
I eat a nigga food in broad day like it's lunchtime
You feeling brave, nigga? Go ahead, get gully
See if I won't leave your brains leaking up out your skully
I done made myself hot, so ain't shit you can tell me
Now niggas calling me to feature, man, fuck your money
I ain't hurting, I'm aight, nigga, I'm doing good
I ain't got to write rhymes, I got bricks in the hood
[Chorus]
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alizé, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I stay high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I'm high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)

Harlem Streets,Immortal Technique,"['hip hop', 'alternative', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Yeah, Harlem streets stay flooded in white powder
Like those motherfuckers runnin' away from the Twin Towers
Gunshots rock the Earth like a meteor shower
Bowlin' For Columbine, fear givin' the media power
Innocence devoured like a chicken spot snack box
Government cocaine cooked into ghetto crack rock
Corrupt cops' false testimony at your arraignment
Check to check, constant struggle to make the payments
Workin' your whole life, wonderin' where the day went
The subway stays packed like a multi-cultural slave ship
It's rush hour, 2:30 to 8, non stoppin'
And people comin' home after corporate sharecroppin'
And fuck flossin'! Mothers are tryin' to feed children
But gentrification is kickin' them out of their buildin'
A generation of babies born without healthcare
Families homeless, thrown the fuck off the welfare

[Chorus: Sample]
""Homicide Harlem—blaow! What's the problem?""
""Homicide Harlem—blaow! What's the problem?""
""Homicide Harlem—blaow! What's the problem?""
""Homicide Harlem—blaow! What's the problem?""
[Verse 2]
It's like Cambodia, ""The Killing Fields"" uptown
We live in distress and hang the flag upside down
The sound of conservative politicians on television
People in the hood are blind, so they tell us to listen
They vote for us to go to war instantly
But none of their kids serve in the infantry
The odds are stacked against us, like a casino
Think about it: most of the Army is black and Latino
And if you can't acknowledge the reality of my words
You just another stupid motherfucker out on the curb
Tryin' to escape from the ghetto with your ignorant ways
But you can't read history at an illiterate stage
And you can't raise a family on minimum wage
Why the fuck you think most of us are locked in a cage?
I give niggas the truth, 'cause their pride is indigent
You better off rich and guilty than poor and innocent
But I'm sick of feelin' impotent watchin' the world burn
In the era of apocalypse, waitin' my turn
I'm a Harlem nigga that's concerned with the future
And if you're in my way it'd be an honor to shoot ya
Uproot ya with the evil that grows in my people
Makin' them deceitful, cannibalistic, and lethal
But I see through the mentality implanted in us
And I educate my fam about who we should trust
[Chorus: Sample]
""Homicide Harlem—blaow! What's the problem?""
""Homicide Harlem—blaow! What's the problem?""

'Cause one day a rapist attacked her and broke that all apart
She said there was no way to fix it or to cover her scars
Then one day a guy came along that probably could help her start
He was sincere, made her believe it was safe for her to trust again
Before long, she was cool with givin' hugs to him
Knew that it was right 'cause somethin' was wrong
The alarms in her mind didn't tell her he didn't belong

That's why he get high enough to go touch the heavens above him

Every alley he ever slept in, every purse that he snuck in
Every level of hell he's been to and the one that he's stuck in
The one he can't escape, even though it's of his own construction

So Many Tears,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'alternative', 'jazz', 'blues']","[Intro]
I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears
If I should die before I wake
Please God walk with me
Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven

[Verse 1]
Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me, can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past
You wanna last? Be the first to blast
Remember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now he rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears
[Refrain]
I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

[Verse 2]
Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed
I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse
God, can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again
I'm goin' blind, I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire, I'll shed so many tears

[Refrain]
Lord, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

[Verse 3]
Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step
To bring me closer to embrace an early death
Now there's nothin' left
There was no mercy on the streets
I couldn't rest, I'm barely standin'
About to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep
Will I survive 'til the morning to see the sun?
Please Lord, forgive me for my sins, 'cause here I come
[Refrain]
Lord! (God!)
I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers

[Verse 4]
And Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady 'cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin' noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys
Can't take no more, I'm fallin' to the floor
Beggin' for the Lord to let me in to Heaven's door
Shed so many tears

[Refrain]
Lord, lost so many years
And shed so many tears
I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered many years
And shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears"

Angel hair with the lobster sauce
Summertime, can't top the scorch
Check my hot broad, I dropped the Porsche
FBI wanna watch the force, tryna lock my source
Where I'm from—hear the macs, Tecs, Glocks and fours
Hide the safe, nigga, lock the doors
No respect for the cops and laws
In the land where your own blood brother still plot for yours
Seen things that'll drop your jaw
My soldiers got dropped in war
See the mural on the project wall?
Won't stop til I cop them all
Wanna block me? You gots to brawl, trade shots and all

Still break off the block with raw, my stock is more

With whips and spears and rough diamonds out of Syria

Résumé is straight up live, I shank niggas up for larger Es
And speak with the youth in the spot
Eat the fresh fruit in the crop; all these hip-hoppers eat cock
You could see me in the street or the yacht

Leather in the summer, silk in the winter
This is such an art, where do I begin-a?
Used to sing tenor, in the church choir
Really I was flexin', but the girls they were fire
I'm the type of guy that notice subtle signs
When I cuddle mine, she ain't even tryin'
To look sexy, but even if she was, so what?
Motherfucker grow up, don't mean to be so abrupt
But that let's me know that she's a human being
And being human's hard—on the boulevard
Girl, you got it bad, glad I'm not one
But yet you got it good, you are the hot one
But I'm André, Benjamin André to be exact
You'd hope to meet a gentleman one day, well this is that
In fact, Dookie introduced us at a show
About a year or so ago, I don't know, mind slips me
I'm in the Southern states, you know, where all the pimps be
Dressin all boogey and carryin' ugly cups
And yes, you're getting booed if your shit do not get down
And yes, you're getting sued by women who didn't get up
Out their seat on the bus, and feet shouldn't rust
And beat is a must, and we shouldn't lust
But we do, I'm laughin' at the calendars and clocks
Ascot to match the socks, what's in your Speakerboxxx?
""Pink and Blue"", you're lollygaggin', you're slow pokin'

Sir Luscious is the real deal but even he gets antsy
Some honeys try to kill Bill beneath the underpants see
But patience is a virtue to being anxious, just might hurt you
Like Mike Vick returning to the line of scrimmage too soon
A line of niggas tryin' to get in Vision on a full moon
Should I play it cool or be the one to make the first move?
Anticipatin' and contemplatin', she got you sprung, dude
Shit, I'm finna get her, might even hit her, what you gon' do? (what?)
I tell you what, we won't be fallin' for that one-two
Just kinky sex up off in the Boom Boom if she want to
And if she don't, then I'll dial another date
That means find another face to replace cause I can't wait

This is dedicated to the lover (to the lover)

Can I Live,J. Cole,['hip hop'],"[Verse 1]
Yeah
Pussy my passion, never been a fan of flashin'
Probably 'cause I never could, said if I had it, never would
Then I got my first lil taste of paper and I splurged
I guess it's just a nigga urge, this is The Boondocks
I swear, yo, I’m like Huey mixed with Riley
Thursday I be tryna save the world, and then on Friday, I hit the club
Hopin' that my dick get rubbed by some fat asses
Niggas get to scrappin' then you hear the gats blasting, damn
Hope them niggas ain't got no problems with me
My momma told me to speak like you got a college degree
You see, I can, but I won’t 'cause I’m saying what I want
Plus this slang that I speak don't change that I'm deep
As the throat on a certified freak, will she choke?
As we headed to the crib, yes, I let her give me head
So she won't 'member where I live, my game is tight
Baby, no need to bring pajamas, you ain't stayin' the night
No disrespect, I just say it polite
I drop her off before I sleep, I be praying for life
Like Hov said it, can I live?
Ayy, dear Lord, can I live?
Hey, now am I living to get paid, just slaves for a wage, are we?
I can't do no 9-to-5, told my momma sorry
I can't do no suit and tie, no I want the glory
If you knew me, know my life is like a movie starring me
Pardon me, if it seems that I'm following my dreams
I ain't reading off the script that they picked for me
I ain't pissed, nah, couldn’t give a shit hardly
I'll be shitting on them niggas that was shitting on me
Will I live or will I die before they get to know me?
If I go, I know the ones that’s pouring liquor for me
And I know them fake niggas really hating on me
Knew that I was 'bout to blow, so they was waiting on me
[Bridge]
But oh no, Lord
You see, I'm smarter than they know
So hold on, Lord, 'cause I ain't quite ready to go
Can I live?
Somebody told me that it's only one shot
So I'll be goddamned if I'm ever gonna stop
Promise to my momma I'ma make it to the top
So I'ma keep climbing 'til my heartbeat drop

[Verse 2]
Like the phone when she heard the news
Her sister on the other line talking to her shoes
The only son, what a thing to lose
More blacks singing more blues
More niggas pouring more brews
Poor dude, he was young like 21, straight up out that city that I'm from
A real smart nigga, but his niggas, they was dumb
He ain't even get a chance to run
Before it landed in his lung
God, breathe nigga
His partner screaming “Don’t you fucking leave, nigga!”
Took off his shirt, tryna stop the bleeding nigga, “Don’t you go!”
But his life fading slow
Did I tell my mom I love her, do she know?
Did I tell my baby sorry from before?
Won't get to see my son grow
Lord, I ain't ready to go
Can I live? Can I live? Dear Lord, Can I live?
Can I live?"

Finally, someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing, 'cause I'm countin' no age
Nah, I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare
Intangible, bet you didn't think, so I command you to
Panoramic view, look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you getting down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe, spiritual hero
Who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy?
Lifeless to those, the definition for what life is
Priceless to you, because I put you on the hype shit

Get psychic among those, possess you with one dose

The essence, the basics, without it, you make it
Allow me to make this childlike in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them, every sproutin' tree, every child of peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise (That's right)
From this fuckin' enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles
But percussion he provides for me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind
That's the inner (Fuck 'em) so I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (Right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing and remember that it's all in your head

Wanting to be myself

[Verse 1]
Yeah, and I already know what you expect
Uh
Now let me tell you what you gon' get
You might've seen me in the fast lane flash frame
Now let me guess, you already know my last name
You probably seen me on t.v
Life so easy
But what is it even like to be me
People jumping to conclusions
My own name is what im proving
My independent movement, no illusion
But this ain't nothing new, been rapping since the age of five
Spitting in the basement in Queens in 1999
I'm writing my own rhymes
Even though my dad is Run you've never seen Mike Joran dunking for his son, huh
But just cause
Im backseat driven dont mean im not driven, trynna make a living

At least I ain't here rapping about some violence or nonsense of any age old-school or novice
And you know I got this
And they can't stop it
Andy Milonakis
Flow so retarded
Never wanna use my dads name as a crutch
So Im here to prove a point without him or my Uncle Russ
Don't get me wrong I ain't got a problem with the legacy
Im just tryna do me create my own credibility
You know them haters probably sayin' his daddy made a phone call
But he probably hearing this the same time as all yall
Ya boy digga is a young go getta
Bringin in that currency and he is a real spitta
They sittin at the keyboard bashing him on Twitter®
Gossiping like girls, I'll send you Pastries from my sisters

Came in with my style, so I fathered you
I kept changing on the world since Barbeque
Now you wanna hang with niggas I hung with
Fuck bitches I hit, it's funny I once said
If I ever make a record, I'll take a check
And put something away for a rainy day to make my exit
But look at me now, ten years deep
Since the project bench with cracks in my sock, 'sleep
I never asked to be top of rap's elite
Just a ghetto child tryna learn the craft of the streets
But look at me now
[Chorus]
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man

[Verse 2]
Now wait a sec', give me time to explain, women and fast cars
And diamond rings can poison a rap star
Was suicidal, high, smoking so much lye
I saw a dead bird flying through a broken sky
Wish I could flap wings and fly away
To where black kings in Ghana stay
So I could get old, my flesh rot away
But that'll be the day when it's peace
When my gat don't need to spray
When these streets are safe to play
Sex with death, indulge in these women
Vision my own skeleton swimming in eternal fire
Broads play with pentagrams in they vagina
Like the Exorcist, then they gave birth to my seeds
I beg for God's help, why they love hurting me?
I'm your disciple, a thug certainly
I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
If I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
.45 in my waist, staring at my reflection
In the mirror, sitting still in the chair like Mike Concepcion
When everything around me got cloudy
The chair became a king's throne, my destiny found me
It was clear why the struggle was so painful
Metamorphosis, this is what I changed to
And God, I'm so thankful
[Chorus]
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man

[Interlude]
Yo, ugh, look, look, ugh, that's that bitch Wiz was fuckin' (Haha)
Damn, that's fucked up
Nigga, let's get high, nigga (Roll them dice, nigga, hurry up)
Highest to the sky, it's four hundred in here, nigga
What the fuck is you niggas talkin' 'bout, nigga?
One, one, one, all around the bar
Come on, let's get high, nigga, oh, shit, oh (Oh)
Four fifty-six, nigga, shut the fuck up
Fuck y'all niggas, run my fuckin' money (Run that back)
Run that back, man (Bust it back)
I gotta get high, man, you got weed? (Run that back)
Run it back? Alright, run it back, c'mon"
The Funeral,Killah Priest,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","And the sea is now no longer

[Killah Priest]
A band of horses pullin' his coffin
Enormous, we followed, behind war, death thru dry bones
Hallowed be thy name, it rained his pain
God chariot of fire flowed above the walkin' Messiah
Spread peace and love, holdin' crucifixes and lighters
Outside wit the thieves and liers
Murder and hell stood by
Wavin' was the image of God
The Virgin begins to cry
Why mother, as she looks in the eyes of others
She said: ""It's not for him but my children who suffered""
We got to the burial plot, the bottomless pit
Where he was dropped along wit the apocalypse
We watched from the top of the cliff
Then the Lord said: ""It was the sun""
I unloaded my clip, this is done

Chill son, the funeral, his wake, the eulogy, the gate
Good night"

Swear to God I'll knock you niggas out your fucking clothes
Lay your ass flat like a doormat

[Verse 1: Chubb Rock]
Now clock kids, who got the cocaine?
Don't tell me it's the little kids on Soul Train
The metaphor sent from my brain to my jaw
It comes from other places, not the tinted faces
Journalistic values are yellow and then, of course, falters
You'll watch Channel Zero with that bitch Barbara Walters
She'll have you believe black invented crack
When President Lyndon had the formula way back
In '63 with Kennedy, yes, the double cross
Remember that's when they blow his fucking head off
Vietnam vets come back looking like one-armed pets
Nixon bounced pure checks
No picket fence, no job, no 8-cylinder car
Blue collar turns to bourgeois
Depressed in your chest
Demerol for sess, no dough, crack in vials much less
Whitey can sell on the corners of Bushwick
Whitey can sell on the corners of Flatbush
Whiteys can sell on the corners of Bed-Stuy
Pass the torch to that nigga guy
So just die, nigga, die, nigga
You're too black, you can't handle, you're too strong
Get high, fly, clock.  Next, boost your steel
In '95, we take back Ebbets Field

""Now let's take a sec to think back""

[Verse 2: O.C]
Brooklyn: Traveling distance to party
Brooklyn: absent at functions?  Not hardly
Brooklyn: the name alone holds Godly
You don't know? You better ask somebody
Crack filled streets since '85.
The Beast getting paid to not bust
Hookers’ drawers got crust
Claps clapping regular
Hardcore niggas with Fat gold chains on the corner maintaining
Gold teeth flashing, stickup kids playing in front of
Latin Quarters—keep home your daughters
‘Cause if bullets fly, watch the flaming
Ignorant Ducks are shooting, wiling
They're not aiming
One Easter—now, to think about it, what a pity
Five people died in front of Skate City
Senseless,  Back then you was ill if you had a gun
People gash you and flash you, damn, no fun
Albee Square, you couldn't shop too much ‘cause
Fort Greene would hem you, wreck the fuck on up.
You had Do or Die, East New York, mad Hell
Fellas cutting school, trooping to all go Maxwell
So many memories I can't manifest
Yo, ‘Ru, start where I finish and, to Brooklyn, God bless

[Verse 3: Jeru the Damaja]
Listen ‘cause, for your mind, I got the right nutrition.  We keep shit hard like fat asses and cases of Heineken
Here in Brooklyn, home of the warrior and villain
Trife type chicks, “Top Billin'”s the anthem
Rastas smoke marijuana, enterprising businessmen shoot dice on the corner
Excuse me while I light my spliff but some choose to sip
So bullets hit brains when bottles hit lips
Clips, whatever happened to .38 Special?
Now it's Desert Eagles, government issue
Probably the same one that killed Noriega.
Chips that power nuclear bombs power my Sega
Subliminal hypnotism and colonialism
Leave most niggas dead or in prison
In Crookland, right hand cuts off the left hand
To spite the hand.  Jealous of the next man
So violent crimes black-on-black, plus mad crack to boot
Everybody can't rap, so most hustle and shoot
“Make money money, get money, take money.”
I can't understand that concept ‘cause Jah rules everything around me
Fire burns the unjust like arson, larceny
Melt emcees with mental telepathy
With precision, we're slicing and dicing.
Peace to the East New York, Perverted Monks, and Mike Tyson

And if this ain't hip-hop, it must be knee-hop
I'm higher than a motherfucking chronic leaf treetop
I make that Nina sing like, ""Shooty-do-dee-wop""
You want the facts, Daddy? Well I truly do me, Pop
And I get my candy from your girlfriend's sweet shop
Still get a stomachache every time I see cops
You better run motherfucker, 'cause we not
Yeah, you bitches better run 'til your feet stop

Staring at a mountain like, ""Bitch, I will climb you""
I stand tall like I'm motherfucking 9'2""

I met this girl named Fantasy on wall street
From Tahiti, real Tahitian treat
She had a lot of pep, see, honey was peace
And she told me she liked my smile like Shanice
She danced at this club and made the guys holler
And in a minute made like a thousand dollars
The club that was run by Mr. Schweppes, he had a rep
And everybody watched they step
Cause word on the street was he was no joke
Had everything from crack, marijuana to coke
Later at the club saw this guy named Wayne
Who always bettin' money on the Giants game
As soon as it's on, yo, I stayed away
'Cause he the type who welches a bet and won't pay
I keep tryin' to tell him be a straight stepper
Somebody gonna slice him and send him to Dr. Pepper
Went to the bar checked the score
Got the bartender told him what to pour
He put it on my tab as he filled my cup
And told me the game was tied seven up
Around 12 o'clock she came out to dance
Had all the guys pushing just to have a chance
To spend a little money trying to see the rest
She was blessed, in an orange crushed velvet dress
But I stayed by the bar cause I already know how it go
I already saw the show
See I went to a club like this in Toronto
And came back from Canada dry with no dough
And ever since then I see and see clear
You never find love in this atmosphere
Sometimes you gotta find a better place to be in
Maybe go to a mountain, do a little skiing
So I finished up my drink and I said goodbye
And got home before the sun kissed the sky
No matter where you from or which way you leaning
Now goin' pop got a whole new meaning
[Hook: Jean Grae]
Don't you know we got a lot in here
Wanna be a part of what we got in here
Sorta like we got the whole block in here
No it ain't Nelly but it's hot in here, we got it locked in here
Won't stop (you know), come and drink in numbers like h2o
Soon you gonna hear us everyplace you go
Bubble like the soda kinda like the soap
I just hope you know, it don't stop

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
The Y2K is a brand new era
I'm tryin' to make hits like Yogi Berra
I wonder how long I'll be in this biz
'Cause it's not all cheer like you think it is
There's a whole lot to gain but a lot to lose
Just ask any rapper who paid dues
Everybody now and then bound to struggle
I just grab my wife and we lay and snuggle
We talk about the ivory coast how one day
We gonna sail on the tide and get whisked away
Look up at the stars 'til the crack of dawn
Hold up I never leave your side for long
But for now I keep on making you bounce
And make sure something in my checking accounts
Grab my cell phone and then start to dial
Take a look at my life and start to smile
It's funny how the game make you change your tone
'Cause the joy of my life is the microphone
So I straighten up my act and keep doin' my thing
Gettin' the green, nah mean, getting it clean

Don't you know we got a lot in here
Wanna be a part of what we got in here
Sorta like we got the whole block in here

Nigga I'm a hustler, act like I'm lovin ya
Don't mind fuckin ya, just like the Governor
Used to be the dope man, rolled a hundred spokes man
When I come through, treat me like the Pope man
Ghetto spokesman, I know niggas
In Eastside Oakland all the way to Brook-lyn
And they love my shitty drawers, what you smokin?
Think you got the balls, nigga I'm a Trojan
Catchin all that just like a prophylac'
Don't reproduce, that bullshit is whack
Flavor Flav with a white bitch that is whack
Got to put the nigga back in my Cadillac
Take him to the hood, where it's action packed
Let him know that the target's still on his back
It's a hustle called capitalism
Got my niggas in prison, all stuck in the system yeah
Recognize who's a hustler, George Dubya
He's the one that's sittin back, fuckin ya
With a big dick stuck in ya
I'm from a place where the fuckin Terminator is the Governor
(I got a Public Pretender.. tryin to make me a winner)
(Nigga please don't surrender.. they'll have you for dinner)

[Hook: Ice Cube]
The ghetto is a nigga trap, take the cheese
Soon as you do it here come the police
Invented and designed fo' us to fail
Where you gon' end up, dead or in jail

[Ice Cube]
You only got two places
State of California, got two faces
Motherfuckin devils, get straight racist
When they get you in them lonely dark places
Concrete slave ships, never move
Where niggas like us get used like a mule
Don't let 'em catch you, arrest you
Strip and undress you, throw you in a cesspool
You wanna know the crime of the century
A ghetto elementary, a mental penitentiary
Black man, you never been friend of me
Boy you kin to me, why we enemies?
The ghe-tto is a trap
Fuck where you from, nigga look where you at
Where you wanna be? Point it out on a map
Don't be scared to leave homey, we can come back
If you wanna come back to this bullshit
Most of it comin straight out the pulpit
We got to change our ways in the hood
Understand that it's AIDS in the hood...
The nigga trap...

That are now A&Rs in the cheap office
Rappers that never got signed, but they keep offers
Girls that's way too fine for us to keep off us

She in her birthday suit 'cause of the damn cake
Now it's crumbs all over the damn place (Uh-huh)
And she want me to cum all over her damn face
I never understood Planned Parenthood
'Cause I never met nobody planned to be a parent in the hood
Taking refills of that Plan B pill
Another shorty that won't make it to the family will
If I don't make it, can't take it, hope the family will

Nah, you ain't listen, they Black, they sisters
They mama named 'em after white bitches

Though the jewelry's Egyptian, know the hunger's Ethiopian
Stupid questions like, ""Is he gon' be dope again?
Have you seen him? Has anybody spoke to him?""

Now, lil' Terry got a gun he got from the store
He bought it with the money he got from his chores
He robbed the candy shop, told her ""Lay down on the floor
Put the cookies in the bag, take the pennies out the drawer""
Lil' Khalil got a gun he got from the rebels
To kill the infidels and American devils
A bomb on his waist, a mask on his face
Prays five times a day and listens to heavy metal
Little Alex got a gun he took from his dad
That he snuck into school in his black book bag
His black nail polish, black boots, and black hat
He gon' blow away the bully that just pushed his ass

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
I killed another man today
Shot him in his back as he ran away
Then, I blew up his hut with a hand grenade
Cut his wife throat as she put her hands to pray
Just five more dogs; then, we can get a soccer ball
That's what my commander say
How old? Well, I'm like ten, eleven
Been fighting since I was like six or seven
Now, I don't know much about where I'm from
But I know I strike fear everywhere I come
Government want me dead, so I wear my gun
I really want the rocket launcher, but I'm still too young
This candy give me courage not to fear no one
To feel no pain and hear no tongue
So I hear no screams, and I shed no tear
If I'm in your dreams, then your end is near, yeah!
[Chorus: Nikki Jean]
Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
We're calling you
Little boy, if the guns are just too tall for you
We'll find you something small to use

Now, here comes the march of the boy brigade
A macabre parade of the toys he made
In shemaghs and shades, who look half his age
About half the size of the flags they wave
And camouflage suits made to fit youths
'Cause the ones off the dead soldiers hang a lil' loose
Where AK47s that they shooting into heaven
Like they tryna kill a Jetson, the struggles, little recruits
Cute, smileless, heartless, violent
Childhood destroyed, devoid of all childish ways
Can't write their own names
Or read the words that's on they own graves
Think you gangsta? Popped a few rounds?
These kids'll come through and murder a whole town
Then sit back and smoke and watch it burn down
The grave gets deeper the further we go down, it's...

Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
We're calling you
Little boy, if the guns are just too tall for you

[Verse 3: Bishop G]
Imagine if I had to console
The families of those slain I slayed on game consoles
I aim, I hold right trigger to squeeze
Press up and Y, one less nigga breathe
B for the bombs, press pause for your moms
Make the room silent, she don't approve of violent games
She leave; resume activity
Scarred and blue heart, of hard, sharp wizardry
On next part, I insert code
To sweeten up the little person's murder workload
I tell him he work for CIA with A
A operative; I operate this game all day
I hold the controller connected to the soldier
With weapons on his shoulder
He's only seconds older than me
We playful but serious
Now, keep that on mind for online experience, ugh!

Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
We're calling you
Little boy, if the guns are just too tall for you
We'll find you something small to use

I Do It for Hip Hop,Ludacris,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","[Intro: Ludacris]
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Now this is what they call poetry in motion
My soul bleeds on the paper, heart screams with emotion
It's my daily devotion, the verses stay deeper than the ocean
So hip-hop you owe me a promotion!
Yeah I do a little boastin and braggin
What's all the commotion and naggin about? Cause I'm still the champ in the South?
Cause rappers get in the booth and I keep draggin em out?
Well they're fired, and these pink slips, I'm handin em out
Cause this is ""Theater of the Mind,"" consider it a sign
Of what's to come next, my money's just fine
Bank filled with dumb checks, terrorist threat flow
Proceed to drop bombs like Mr. Funk Flex
But I don't do it for the money, I do it from the heart
I do it with the beat box, I did it from the start
I do it for the dee jays, I do it for the charts
The Van Gogh flow, Luda do it cause it's art
I do it for the fans, I do it on command
I do it for the front row, I do it for the stands
I spit it for the hood, I do it for the block
And since nine years old I did it for hip-hop, so
[Chorus 1: Ludacris]
I don't do it for them cars and the fancy drops
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
And I don't it for the chains and the flashin rocks
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop

[Verse 2: Nas]
Uhh, uhh, uh
They say I'm so low key, I'm socially awkward
Only niggas who really know me, who I talk with
They smile in the light, hate in the dark
You call it beef, to me, it's just a fuckin walk in the park
Cause you are who you are when nobody's lookin
That's who you are, so when the cash and the cars is gone
The day after tomorrow, don't be askin to borrow
Ski mask it hard, like the way you rap in your bars
I can ride on you and whoever, devise new endeavors
I'm as live as a hive full of predators
Twenty thousand different species of bees
Some have poisonous stings, some just pollinate leaves
It's like rap, some just buzz, some will attack
Compromise their own life in fact
Sixteen years since my first sixteen
Pardon the rest of my niggas... but I'm the best who's ever did it!
[Chorus 2: Ludacris, Nas, Ludacris & Nas]
I don’t do for the cars and the fancy drops
Uh, I do it for hip-hop
Yeah, I do it for hip-hop
Uh, I do it for hip-hop
And I don’t do for the chains and the flashin’ rocks
Why we do it kid? I do it for hip-hop
Yeah, I do it for hip-hop
Uh, I do it for hip-hop

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Hip-hop, started out in the park
We used to do it to avoid the Narcs
I used to do it so the homeboy Clark
Can get the fuck off my back while I knocked off these packs
I used to rap to impress my friends
To pass the time while I was gettin' it in
Just so happens, I'm so illegal with the pen
They ain't want me doin' anything illegal again
I lost a lot of dogs to these streets
I got Grammy Awards on these beats
Thank God for Kool Herc
Without your shit I probably would've got murked
Shout out to Grandmaster Flash and to Caz
And even Jaz bum-ass
Hip-hop helped me wash my rocks
These other rappers couldn't wash my socks
That's why I took the number one slot
The realest shit in rap comes from my voice box
Lord knows when I was on my clock
I prolly never woulda stopped, thank God for hip-hop
[Chorus 3: Ludacris, Jay-Z, Ludacris, Nas & Jay-Z]
I don’t do for the cars and the fancy drops
Uh, I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
And I don’t do for the chains and the flashin’ rocks
Come on, I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop

Tell the world I’m coming

Back where I belong
I’ve never felt so strong eh
Feeling like there’s nothing that I can’t try
And if you feel me put your hands high, high, high, hey
And if you feel me put your hands high, high, hey

This is my story, this is my song
If you ain't got the heart, don’t attempt to try this at home
It’s just a poem from a man once living wrong
Now I’m in the zone, tell the world I’m coming home
Been a long time coming, been a long time coming
This song feel like the greatest of all time coming
Cause I do it B-I-G, I remember we would be high
Who’d have thought we’d be running rap when we was knee high
To appreciate the sun you gotta know what rain is
Or cause I’m famous you don’t think I know what pain is
But I bounce back, would ya look at that
I take my spot at the top and I ain't looking back

But one thing I never lose is my grind
My closet need a lot of cleaning now
I can’t sleep cause I dont like the shit I dream about
Hey Dear Lord please help me get the demons out
And then let me get my genius out
And get back to what I had
If my good’s outweigh my bads, do you think my mistakes is gon even out (even out)
I guess try and see, it’s on my diary, I’m living for my kids
Now they is just as fly as me
Talk well, wonder if Andre Harrell knew how great I would be when he fired me

My crown of glory, you rappers y'all bore me
Seven billion stories, angels kneel before me
I build it for majority, seniority, I photography
Prophecy, my bread conceal maturity
The one man that's more than everyone, minority
I stare in the mirror and see infinity
Deep entities, galaxies and planets
A king leading infantry, I see immortals
Majestic, since boar head - the Caesar
The afros, the cornrows
I'm blessed with more flows
Just accept it, no homo
The holder of the rainbow and the volcano
Flows both fierce and precious
My garment alike, these are bar mitts I write
Like the Bar Mitzvah of Christ
Hare Krishna when I'm holding mics
Behold when I spit a sight
Israelite, I could spit death and hell
Dead body's skeletons inside a cold cells
Or the ringer of Church bells
The breaker of spells, the healer
Hopes life is well, the Killah
My raps come out of a shell
The pen hits, my mind click
Tongue led off hot nails
Crucifix, Judas' pix, you wanted to flow
The lifestyle, what if I had doe?
Y'all wanted the gold and all the ice now
I write down, what if I was rich?
None of y'all wouldn't exist
I'm convinced my son is a prince
Under my skin is wonder of men
Kingship, wings sprout pass the genes
Cover my clips; I'm strapped with mac-10's
That murder y'all demons
[Verse 2]
The suffering poet, the ladder to Imhotep
From the grave of Joseph, the journey like Moses
The mercy of Jehovah, thou requirements
From my higher intelligence, from my wars in heaven
The Lord is my Shepherd, born again
Draw my weapon, days of longing
Strong within, over grave that's storming
I descend and sit in my throne
Out of hells catacomb, the ladder of stones
The castle, I prepare my rhythm and poems
Take off these chains, Priest speaks 700 names
No one is the same, until redemption
My rhyme concealment to the time of revealing
Intertwine, smell the hemp scent
Smoke the weed that's growing in my thoughts
I stand next to the Pale Horse
The captive emcee, the sleeping prophet
Rappers forcing the end, calling on the comet
Rhymes are atomic from out of God's department
Topic, my head is the cave of four winds
The plague, I draw with the pen
Armaged' I saw with my lens
I stand in front of you all
Divided by a Red Sea walls
Look ahead I see shores
Walter Reed, peace, I endure
There, where there's no vacant place or an empty place
Gases avoid, I started with the one thought asteroid
Eye lids open up, solar flux, burdens uncoiled
In this formless mind, the asteroids erupt
The small rocks blew up into dust
[Verse 3]
I said to my son, my son said to me
That we gather my beam, behold I am the three
The trinity, the words said to myself, let us form a rhyme
My spirit moved across my mind
We debated for days with wordplays
And the word became flesh when I entered the text
Enter my page thru no sex
The rap conception, immaculate
My rap's to die for, the lost lessons
Crucified the rhyme, to rise in three minutes
A new sentence was invented
My rap's adventure is endless
My poetry is strong, my art's pure
But my heart and my rap is relentless
Not to get religious but these rhymes are pictures
Vivid as Black August or historical scriptures
For listeners and visionists
From the carving of the rhymes talk
Awakens an ancient force
Imprisoned in my poem's source
Zone, no limit in the realms of thought
Unborns must die
Loosen up the saddle of the ghost horse galloping in the sky
Divinity track lucky seven, infinity's back
God codes been broke, now the memory's zapped"

From being led through the desert naked and desperate for water
The Lord is my shepherd, destined for order
But we are his sheeple
Protect us from the wolves or lector tryna do us evil
Never read the Bible for survival
All I know is rivals grab rifles
Despiteful, or disciples are God work
I read Proverbs, for knowledge I starve and thirst
Deal with the sun and the moon, and the stars a third
On the curb puffing herb
Nah I puff a verse, get drunk off this word
I observe spiritual things; I've seen Israel in my dreams
Come true as I succumb to, in a lesson what a blessing
Learned from Timbuktu, or King Tut's tomb
In the Just schools, from the Noah to the three sons
This the reason, Shem, Ham, and Japheth
Now open up the tablets the origins from Shem
Peleg, I look in the mirror everyday
Look at ya self; this is what the artist had felt
Solomon dies, his kingdom splits
One tribe take to the sea in ships
The other say near Egypt, occupy the land
Till their grand's had grand's
While on the other hand
The one who said self have a new plan
Forgot the old way of the Lord, the Covenant
The other children grew up in it
To 70 AD the reign of Titus advance crew ships invaded with the army
Weapons and navies, killing women and babies
Causing Solomon's offspring to flee deeper into Africa
After the massacre, they went to Zimbabwe and Mozambique
Seen an ocean fleet that cause commotion on their beats
Where the Roman Priest held us across, lives were lost
That's after the divine force, they quickly desperado to Morocco
Where they developed other God gold, also when Allah rose
Check my bar flows
Were they shocked when Solomon's children shot 'em and killed 'em
Lots of 'em pilgrims
Fought millions of miles under storm clouds
Where they met these peoples calling themselves Indians
Never reminisce, look at each other eyes and forgot when
Prophecies from old, remember you was told
From the voices of the scrolls, lost souls"

That blonde hair look good, straight down, bun or the braids
And I ain't gon' talk about them light-browns under your shades
Bust right, thus tight
Got a thick set of thighs and struts like... uh
Yo' the game taught this brother to mack
But I think I slipped when I saw them full lips covered with Mac
You got everything that others would lack
Along with the F-A, B-O, L-O, U-S
Your patience I personally admire
Cause I started out a player now I'm 'bout to have my jersey retired, for real
[Hook]

[Fabolous]
There ain't no ""mights"" or ""maybe""
I done did wrong, so I'm a make sure it's right for my baby
You know how tight that my day be
And how long and stressin them flights to L.A. be
Ain't no rumor gon' get back to your friends
Before I let a nigga disrespect you I be back in the pen
Front to back you a ten
You got me thinkin 'bout puttin a car seat in back of the Benz, uh

That's my honey if I give her money she ain't gotta pay me back
No you ain't gotta pay me back
Hey hey hey hey
And I'll forever give you my love cuz
When I'm down you always put a smile on me
And when all of my strength's up, and I'm 'bout to give up

She loves me, she loves me more
Amour me, she assures
She adores me
Even when it's up and down like see-saw
Surely, we can start from scratch like default
When they say you're not my baby like Maury
You can tell 'em that they're telling a story
Testify like you're telling a jury
And I'll repeat like you said it before me
We undefeated like a veteran army
And we as heavy as an elephant, aren't we?
Let's take 'em to the zoo, or better yet a safari
They want me to leave my Dame like the fella from Marcy (No!)
But we go way back like a set of Atari's
From baby fat 'til we skeletons darling
""Me"" starring ""You"" is what it says on the marquee
So let's go give them a show, on my heart, get set, go!

Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm lost
They gave me nothing but doubt
First they waited then hated then counted me out
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm stuck
They say I lost my way
But first I showed em then I sold em right in front of their face

[Verse 1 - B.o.B]
Well this is the world that we live in
One minute you the hero the next you the villain
We got up in this game just to try to make a living
We hit you with the truth while you watching television
But still these are the cards that we dealt
They kick you on the ground when you most need help
Until you dried up and they sit you on the shelf
Then you start to cry because you all by yourself
So just know if you wanna wear the belt
The only way to excel is the soul that you sell
So I could care less about the clothes on myself
Im trying to drive straight on a road made of nails
Yeah, I got to pay the toll if I fail
Or else it would be another story to tell
Im getting to the door I can tell
Im just waiting on the day till the glory prevails

Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm lost
They gave me nothing but doubt
First they waited then hated then counted me out
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm stuck
They say I lost my way
But first I showed em then I sold em right in front of their face

[Verse 2 - T.I.]
All I know is keep goin', shit don't stop
Until the hustle doubles up, I'll put the click on top
Used to wanna have the bricks on lock
Til we went to prison saw we couldn't pick them locks
Easy decision now a nigga think I lost my touch
Listen if I ain't the realest ever done it I ain't off by much
So please don't wake me up if I'm dreamin'
In the fast lane speedin', no safety belt
And it's a marathon, pace yourself
In this race for wealth talkin shit just a waste of breath
Chasing me like chasing your tail your never catch it
Respect is something you never get if you never had it
I'm lookin' back and laughin' this life of mine
Brought me all the way here from my life of crime
Just a constant reminder that the end all be all
Is the one who knows all sees all because
[Hook - B.o.B]
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm lost
They gave me nothing but doubt
First they waited then hated then counted me out
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm stuck
They say I lost my way
But first I showed em then I sold em right in front of their face

[Verse 3 - B.o.B]
Yeah, well these are my predictions
I'll be on the Top 40 with a big hit
Travelin' the world tryin' not to get sick
And I'mma get more friends on my ""Friends List""
And then after that I'll be famous
And everyone I know will tell me that I'm changin'
And then my cell phone will never stop ringin'
And I'll be all over magazine pages
Yeah and they'll play my songs 'til they borin'
And if I ever do stop touring they treat me like a foreigner
Don't believe me, ask Lauryn

The Carolina Andre, the Fayettenam Kanye
So join it, can't beat it, to all the nonbelievers
If you missed it, I'll repeat it, I'm the light skinned Jesus
Here's my thesis for them niggas with them pieces like Reese's
We ballin' while we winking at your bitch up in the bleachers
She fiending just to hop up on my shit like she was featured
On that piece of shit, bed keep on squeaking like some sneakers
On the court, here's some lines you can snort, food for thought
Here's a fork, no pork, damn it, keep it pure, organic
What's the score? Lord, it's a blowout
You niggas out here shoutin', but see me, I'm just gon' show out
Bitch, it's destiny, no doubt, niggas testing me more but I'm sure
Look homie I know my shit can give a tour of the sewer
I'm bored, this shit is simple, on instrumentals I'm Kimbo
Slicing on any tempo, I'm busting like many pimples on the temple
Go hard like I just seen some nipples on Beyonce
No disrespect to Hov, but if I didn't I'd be beyond gay
Almost erased them lines but in the end I chose to keep 'em

Leave you leakin' 'til the plumber come
Still we ain't running from no man
Look bitch I'm hot enough to melt a snowman
Ey pack your bags mama we gettin the fuck up outta Po' land
Cause I'm programmed for the dough
While you hold hands with a ho
You ain't got no chance when I flow
Bitch I was a grown man when I was four
Boy, so sit your ass down
You lookin at the class clown
Slash valedictorian, slash hoopin nigga best dressed
Back in school you was just a stupid nigga
And now you're rappin all you talk bout your Coupe is sicker
Your top is dropped but the cops is out here shootin niggas
Stupid nigga, see me I rather tell the truth to niggas
You out here stuntin, niggas is out here frontin
Nigga you good for nothin
I'm freestylin coming off the dome
Bitch Macaulay Culkin Home Alone
I don't even know why I said that
And bitch I get bread that's enormous
Ya'll niggas on my dick man I'm dormant
That means I'm on the low, that means I'm on your ho
That means I'm about this dough
Nigga I'm coming off the dome

Bitch get hit with a 12-gauge shotty
No Maserati, driving like Mr Cosby

No, not Bangladesh! Bangley
Yo, Brain Bang!
Yo Myspace's been blowing me up
Telling me I had to do it
And since I'm a real democracy
I figured ""I might as well""
You know what I mean
It goes like this

A million here, a million there
Yeah, you got a mil but for real dog nobody cares
If you don't share, don't donate to charity
Children who can barely eat, no shoes on their feet
We don't see, we don't read, we don't really need to
Self-centered humans be the root of all evil
In this industry, we just feed our egos
Got a 7 series and a brand new pea coat
With that ""oh, oh look at me yo
""Heard Ash on milli he ain't talking 'bout me though""
Yes I am, yo, you call yourself a man
But it ain't about the money, it's about what you stand for
This is for my people who can't afford pampers
Wake up in the morning got my clothes out the hamper
Money ain't the answer, still ain't cured cancer
I ain't got a mil but I'm a pretty good dancer
My advance lasts me about a week
After taxes and my bills and a big sack of weed
I am back to where I began
Chilling watching CNN
Thinking damn, we are damned, not again
How is George Bush not in jail for treason
But Clinton gets impeached for busting semen? uh

A million dead, a million scarred
A million bars till' you realize you took it too far
With your cars and you guns, ha, hardy-har-har
Til' I'm dead and I'm gone I'mma party too hard
Life's short, have a ball, matter fact, have two
Yo the government don't care, here's a big ""Fuck you!""
Cause gas is 4 bucks, but they still drive trucks
Dumb and dumber in your hummer, yo I bet that sucks
Spend a milli at the pump
In the city you don't need that
Buy a fucking bike, maybe you wouldn't be fat

Yo homie where the weed at?
Yeah I need to relax, motherfucker I'm chill

(Just relax b, are you done yet?)
Nah
It's just these stupid motherfuckers never get it
It's pathetic
Yo they get to the pros and don't do shit
Like they Redick
When I get that check
I'm gonna take it right to the medic
Cause these sick kids need it more than I need a necklace
Y'all need to respect this
I'm Asher Paul Roth, yo, I'm always on the guest list
Yeah I got a checklist
Stay getting checked, bitch
Keep your mouth closed don't let yourself get checked bitch
Rap's Wayne Gretzky, yes, I'm the best and
Only 22, almost Alex Ovechkin
I suggest y'all invest in some self-esteem
Intervene with Charlton Heston's
Plan to arm every man with a handgun
Who kills people, the gun or the man? um
I'm the best sword fighter in the land, come test me
I'll be drinking wine while practicing my fencing
And driving a jet-ski, straight multitasking
""How are you so good?""

Came from the ghetto
You know!
Food & Liquor!
It's the ghetto right here, man!

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Ayy, it's real here (Uh-huh), dope fiends steal here
Turn around, give us the money to buy wheels here
Give you the chills, yeah? Developers don't build here
The property values low 'cause we still here
Better believe most of us wanna leave
Furthest we went was out of our minds, but we still here
Weapons concealed here, lil' sisters on the pill here
Can't pay bills here, but we like to chill here (Yeah)
Gotta reap what you sow, grow what you till here
Your momma weep where you sowed, ‘cause you was killed there
Police put cameras on poles, too many deals there
Gotta go to the county 'cause you was filmed there (Yup)
How does it feel knowing innocence was killed here?
Last night, down the park, beating heart was still there
For loveliest chain, I make up pills here
Let's pray for our brains, bust-downs kneel here

Sometimes I gotta do a little dirt
Coming from where I'm from (I'm from)

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
There was once a child in here
'Cause all the tribulations and the trials in here (Yeah)
And all the limitations of his housing there
Became a teenage trafficker, a thousand-aire
Captivated with what the drug dealer told
Infatuated with what the drug dealers drove
A life validated by what a drug dealer holds
On the stand 'cause what another drug dealer told
A drug dealer woes: ""Time waits for no man""
No woman waits for a man with time on his hands (They don't)
Didn't you know? Lord, they fearing Ye now
They hearing Ye now, 'specially when the ""Conspiracy""s come down
We come down, get humble; it's no longer fun now
But who gonna hustle to feed his son now?
From the cradle to the cage
We bring our sons to get gunned down
Our daughters to have more
It's war

Sometimes I get lonely (Yuh)
Coming from where I'm from (I'm from)
Things ain't what they seem to be (Or a reasonable facsimile of it)

Sometimes I get a little angry (Just ain't me, though)
Coming from where I'm from (I'm from)
Sometimes it gets the best of me (It's all us, man)

Well I tried to be good
Wanted nothing but to love somebody
Didn't wanna die young
Grinding, hustling, tryna feed my family
Too scared to have kids
And do what Daddy did
'Cause I'm so scared of failing
Sometimes it gets hard
Coming from where I'm from (Sometimes)

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
But, but it's beautiful here
There's nothing like the feeling when you do it from here
You ain't have to move a pack, you ain't have to shoot a gat
And you still took your mama, and you moved her from here
You ain't dropped out, and you figured the world out
Can survive 'bout anywhere—learn how to do it in here
Yeah, that's how we do it in here
Hearing shorties at play is like music to the ear
We still get by, you know?

Now, once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came, and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper-wood
So these silly little fans, they were misled
By a nerdy Internet computer hip-hop head
""Me and you, Clef, we're gonna make some cash.""
""Grab this silver paint and just paint my ass.""
Hey, mister, would you care to bear witness to
The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister?
Stanibus, little Marshall Mathers' sister
And in this corner, we have the ""Mr
Not-Havin'-It,"" it's the Mad, sinister
Dr. Evil, with his bag of tricks for
This little antagonistic faggot
Dick-sucking ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny-Fag-Kaniff-sta
You bastard, I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canibus, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!

Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York, or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh, Canibitch

[Verse 2]
Now, at first, I ain't really understand this shit
Picture me, for a second, and imagine it
Chillin' in the Bat Mansion relaxin' when
All of a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners, it's
Canibitch, on some 'Stan Lives' shit
It creeped me out at first; man, this is sick
But me, bein' just as sick, this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters, you were tellin' me shit like
You respect me, like any other regular MC
The third letter, you asked how come I ain't return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me
The fourth letter: ""Slim, you're really startin' to upset me.""
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me
The sixth letter, there's a bomb threat on our building
This crazy motherfucker's really tryna kill me
So I went back and read the first few letters that said
Some shit about a message you left
Oh shit! That's not a E, that's an A!
This dude wants to leave me a 'massage,' he's gay!
Right away, I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre
""We got a bogey,"" ""Marshall, I'm on the way.""

So, in two seconds flat, Dre's at my crib
Only thing is, we both know where this kid lives
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship
""Shit. Oh, Dre, wait a minute, that's it!
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo-boost
We can fly over the border!"" ""Let's Go!"" [whoosh]
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed
""What was that? Oh, Jermaine Dupri.""
""Fuck it,"" keep goin', no time to waste
""Wait, back up. Hit him one more time, in case.""
""Okay,"" fuck, now he's draggin' under the car
""Oh well, only thirty more thousand miles!""
Meanwhile, me and Dre are tryna conversate
Just tryna find a reason for the constant hate
And tryna figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propane'
""He couldn't have fell off that hard."" Ain't no way!
What happened to the way you was rappin'
When you was scandalous?
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist!
Plus, he raps with his regular voice
[Four impacts] ""What was that?"" ""Pet Shop Boys.""
So, we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted
His corpse was still movin', but his ass was rotted
And he kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love
I figured if I stick him with a fork, he's done
So I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin'—Christ!
He won't die! This guy's like a battered wife!
He's like Kim: he keeps comin' back for more
But he won't fight back, I cracked his jaw
Hold up! 'Bis, quit foldin' up!
Punch me in the chest, make my shoulders touch
Do something! At least one punchline!
Come on! 'Til the meter reads Nine! Nine! Nine-
Ty nine percent of my fans are blond!
'Bis, come on, answer me, man, respond!
Tell me 'bout the sun, rain, moon and stars!
Intergalactical metaphors from Mars!
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs!
Bite another line from Redman's song!
Suddenly, the stub of a dead man's arm
From a midget reaches out from under the car
It's J.D.! This motherfucker won't die, neither!
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether
We swamped the bitch in it; stomped the bitch again
""Compton!"" ""Detroit, bitch, talk some shit again!""
""Stomp him!"" ""Switch feet!"" ""Stomp him!"" ""Switch again!""
""Dre, all right, he's dead, dog, quit kickin' him!
I think Stanibus jumped off the bridge again!"" (""Ahh!"")
""Damn,"" ""He disappeared, yo, he's gone, he did it again!""

It's like everyday somebody's reading the paper
Somebody's reading the eulogy
Far different from the streets elders use to see
But anyway back to the seeming desert
The heaven sent of the plant treasures
Unfamiliar pleasures
Where a fiend play the part of the peasants
Five-percent lessons play the part of the Shepherds
We the sheep need deep
But if they knew most of us are really predators in our essence
Lower the weapon, AK's and SK's, Saviours' Day
The saints, thugs on Church walls, now let us pray
[Hook]
Let us pray
Let us pray
Let us pray
Let us pray
Let us pray

[Verse 2]
Now move out the way, let the saints pass
Seen the picture on the cylinder
The temple with stained glass
'Till the enemy's urn with ash
Light candles under their pic as we burn hash
Learned fast, windows down, when the car turns, blast
Drive-bys, eyes wide shut, we survived
Not African tribes in huts, we died for pride
Bullets will touch, yes! Bitch shut the fuck up
Just ride the clutch, king vibe
Prophesize is the demise of Tut
Mummified money for bribes
Country, fly to hide wives, big shit
Head price is vexed, extortion and hits
Coffins are lifted
Bosses and corpses are found in the ditch
Drown, pounds of piff, head and eyes down
I'm just coming up, white nose after they sniff
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Gang related, slang debated, nickel-plated
Pistol waving, he a apostille of Satan
Crystal is jaded, a fistful blazing
The secrecy keeps amazing
Secrets of my imaginations
Spinning animation, under the canvas, they're awaiting
My reawakening, still funny my girl's cheating on me
Bubbles in my stomach and one's sneaking on me
She's a freak, she's alone and she's horny
I fall asleep; I see a boner in orgies
Insecurities, impurities
React furiously, compulsive disorders
Witch torture, big Torah, Rosh Hashanah
Lit the menorah, God aura
I'm flying disc or saucer, over my head
With the crack, Ghetto Jezuz miracles
Turn rocks into bread, shots at the head
Duck it, got up, it's nothing
God gangsta, a rebel, I'm ready
For devils on all levels and pagans
I'm brazing sickles, amen, patient"
American Dreamin,JAY-Z,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","[Intro: Marvin Gaye]
Dreamed of you this morning
Then came the dawn, and
I thought you were here with me
If you could only see
How much I love you
That's all, that's all, baby

[Chorus: Marvin Gaye & JAY-Z]
Oh no, I never gave up no way (I never felt that before)
Oh no, I never gave up no way (I never felt that before)
Oh no, I never gave up no way (I never felt that before)
But there's always— that's all, that's all, baby (Uh, uh)

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
This is the shit you dream about with the homies steaming out
Back-to-back, backing them Bimmers out
Seems as our plans to get a grant
Then go off to college didn't pan or even out
We need it now, we need a town
We need a place to pitch, we need a mound
For now, I'm just a lazy boy
Daydreaming in my La-Z-Boy
In the clouds of smoke, been playing this Marvin
Mama, forgive me, should be thinking about Harvard
But that's too far away, niggas is starving
Nothing wrong with my aim, just gotta change the target
I got dreams of bagging snid-ow the size of pillows
I see pies every time my eyes clid-ose
I see rides, sixes, I gotta get those
Life's a bitch, I hope to not make her a widow
[Chorus: Marvin Gaye & JAY-Z]
Oh no, I never gave up no way (I never felt that before)
American dreamin'
Oh no, I never gave up no way (I never felt that before)
I'm just American dreamin'
Oh no, I never gave up no way (I never felt that before)
American dreamin'
But there's always— that's all, that's all, baby (Uh, uh)

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Now see the life's right there, and it seems right there
And it's not quite near, and it's not like we're
Professionals, moving the decimals
Know where to cop? Nah, got a connect? No
Who in the F knows how to be successful
Need a personal Jesus, I'm in Depeche Mode
They say its celestial, it's all in the stars
It's like Tony La Russa on how you play your cards
'Cause y'all ain't fucking with me, the ironies are
At all costs, better avoid these bars
Now let's start, on your mark
Get set, let's go, get out the car
Going in circles, it's a vicious cycle
This is a crash course, this ain't high school
Wake up, Muttley, you're dreaming again
Your own reality show, the season begins
[Chorus: Marvin Gaye & JAY-Z]
Oh no, I never gave up no way (I never felt that before)
American dreamin'
Oh no, I never gave up no way (I never felt that before)
I'm just American dreamin'
Oh no, I never gave up no way (I never felt that before)
American dreamin'
But there's always— that's all, that's all, baby

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Step one in this process, scramble up in your projects
And head to the heights where big coke is processed
You gotta convince 'em that you're not from the precinct
Please speak slow 'cause he no speaky no English
If he takes a liking after a couple of trips
And your money is straight, he's going to give you consignment
Now in the game where only time can tell
Survive the droughts, I wish you well— hold up
Survive the droughts? I wish you well?
How sick am I? I wish you health
I wish you wheels, I wish you wealth
I wish you insight so you could see for yourself
You could see the signs when the jackers is scheming
And the cops is coming, you could read they mind
You could see from behind, you could redefine
The game as we know it, one dream at a time
I'm American dreamin'
[Chorus: Marvin Gaye & JAY-Z]
Oh no, I never gave up no way (I never felt that before)
American dreamin'
Oh no, I never gave up no way (I never felt that before)

Millie Pulled a Pistol on Santa,De La Soul,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'dance', 'blues']","""If you will suck my soul
I will lick your funky emotions""

[Posdnuos]
This is the stylin' for a title that sounds silly
But nothin' silly about the triflin' times of Millie
Millie a Brooklyn Queen originally from Philly
Complete with that accent that made her sound hillbilly
Around this time the slammin' joint was “Milk is Chillin'”
But even cooler was my social worker Dillon
Yeah I had a social worker 'cuz I had some troubles
Anyone who'd riff on me, I'd pop their dome like bubbles
He'd bring me to his crib to watch my favorite races
That's how his daughter Millie became one of my favorite faces
She had the curves that made you wanna take chances
I mean on her, man, I'd love to make advances
I guess her father must 'a got the same feelin'
I mean, actually findin' his own daughter Millie appealing
At the time no one knew but it was a shame
That Millie became a victim of the touchy-touchy game
[Trugoy the Dove]
Yo Millie, what's the problem, lately you've been buggin'
On your dookie earrings, someone must be tuggin'
You were a dancer who could always be found clubbin'
Now you're world renowned with the frown you're luggin'
Come to think your face look stink when Dill's around you
He's your father-what done happen-did he ground you?
You shouldn't flip on him 'cuz Dill is really cool
Matter of fact, the coolest elder in the school
He hooked up a trip to bring us all the Lacey
He volunteered to play old Santa Claus at Macy's
Child, ya got the best pops anyone could have
Dillon's cool, super hip, you should be glad

[Posdnuos]
Yeah, it seemed that Santa's ways were parallel with Dillon
But when Millie and him got home, he was more of a villain
While she slept in he crept inside her bedroom
And he would toss her and then would force her to give him head room
Millie tried real hard to let this hell not happen
But when she'd fuss, he would just commence the slappin'
(Yo Dillon man, Millie's been out of school for a week, man, what's the deal?)
I guess he was givin' Millie's bruises time to heal
Of course he told us she was sick and we believed him
And at the department store as Santa we would see 'em
And as he smiled, his own child was at home plottin'
How off the face of this earth she was gonna knock him
When I got home, I found she had tried to call me
My machine had kicked to her hey how ya doin' (sorry)
I tried to call the honey but her line was busy
I guess I'll head to Macy's and bug out on Dillon
[Trugoy the Dove]
I received a call from Misses Sick herself
I asked her how was she recoverin' her health
She said that what she had to ask would make it seem minute
She wanted to talk serious, I said, ""go ahead-shoot""
She claimed I hit the combo dead upon the missile
Wanted to know if I could get a loaded pistol
That ain't a problem but why would Millie need one
She said she wanted her pops Dillon to heed one
Ran some style about him pushin' on her privates
Look honey, I don't care if you kick five fits
There's no way that you can prove to me that Dill's flip
He might breathe a blunt but ya jeans he wouldn't rip
You're just mad he's your overseer at school
No need to play him out like he's someone cruel
She kicked that she would go get it from somewhere else
Yeah, whatever you say, go for ya self

[Posdnuos]
Macy's department store, the scene for Santa's kisses
And all the little brats demandin' all of their wishes
Time passes by as I wait for my younger brother
He asks his wish, I waste no time to return him back to Mother
As I'm jettin', Millie floats in like a zombie
I ask her what's her problem, all she says is ""Where is he?""
I give a point, she pulls a pistol, people screamin'
She shouts to Dill, “He's off to hell cuz he's a demon!”
None of the kids could understand what was the cause
All they could see was a girl holdin' a pistol on Claus
Dillon pleaded mercy, said he didn't mean to
Do all the things that her mind could do nothing but cling to
Millie bucked him and with the quickness it was over"
We Used to Wait,Arcade Fire,"['rock', 'alternative', 'pop', 'blues', 'metal', 'jazz']","[Verse 1]
I used to write
I used to write letters, I used to sign my name
I used to sleep at night
Before the flashing lights settled deep in my brain
But by the time we met
By the time we met, the times had already changed
So I never wrote a letter
I never took my true heart, I never wrote it down
So when the lights cut out
I was lost, standing in the wilderness downtown

[Chorus]
Now our lives are changing fast
Now our lives are changing fast
Hope that something pure can last
Hope that something pure can last

[Verse 2]
And it seems strange
How we used to wait for letters to arrive
But what's stranger still
Is how something so small can keep you alive
We used to wait
We used to waste hours just walking around
We used to wait
All those wasted lives in the wilderness downtown
[Bridge]
Ooh, we used to wait
Ooh, we used to wait
Ooh, we used to wait
Sometimes it never came
Ooh, we used to wait
Sometimes it never came
Ooh, we used to wait
Still moving through the pain

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna write
A letter to my true love, I'm gonna sign my name
Like a patient on a table
I wanna walk again, gonna move through the pain

[Chorus]
Now our lives are changing fast
Now our lives are changing fast
Hope that something pure can last
Hope that something pure can last

[Bridge]
Ooh, we used to wait
Ooh, we used to wait
Ooh, we used to wait
Sometimes it never came
Ooh, we used to wait
Sometimes it never came
Ooh, we used to wait
Still moving through the pain
We used to wait
We used to wait
We used to wait
[Outro]
We used to wait for it
We used to wait for it
Now we're screaming
Sing the chorus again
We used to wait for it
We used to wait for it
Now we're screaming
Sing the chorus again
I used to wait for it
I used to wait for it
Hear my voice screaming
Sing the chorus again
Wait for it!
Wait for it!!
Wait for it!!!"

See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?
Yeah, I said it, has-been
Hang it up, flatscreen
Plasma
""Hey Nicki, hey Nicki,"" asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars, sentencin'
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that ho, punt
Forced trauma, blunt
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with
You lil' Fraggle Rock, beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie, camera block
You outta work, I know it's tough
But enough is enough

I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
You don't like it, then peel off, bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off
And I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollering, ""Why, God?""
He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones
The world ain't finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music
So I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod
The moral to the story is life's treating you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch, ask why not?
The world-world is my punching bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they must've bumped your wagon
You must've went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
Told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic
[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Should've sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
""Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot""
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I hear the mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill, mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' buck, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levis
Raggedy Anns, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli
Manning, Eli, these bitches callin' me Manning, Eli

[Verse 4: Eminem]
All you lil' faggots can suck it
No homo, but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
You have the same passion I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you ass-dicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids, but eyelash
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash
It's high class meets white trash

Uh-huh uh yeah, gi-gi-geyeah
Time to come up, hold my own weight, defend my crown
Gots to lock it down and when they rush -- part two
Cocaine whiter now
Operation is sweet
Whole game tighter now
Moving a brick a week
Plus a nigga price is down
We them niggas to see
Time to start the arising now
I don't know what's wrong with Bleek

[Verse 1: Jay-Z & Memphis Bleek]
It seems, I'm like Keenan, picking up on the vibe
That he ain't too happy, I could just see it in his eyes
I don't know if it's the chicks or how we dividing the loot
Time to pay his ass a visit 'fore he decide to get cute
Jumped out like a star with the flavest car
Matching the gator shirt, softer than my next door neighbors
These young niggas think I fell out the loop
'Cause the last time they seen me hopping out the Coupe
I hopped out in a suit
Look at this nigga Jay fronting, trying to take my shine
I didn't say this verbally, just had some shit on my mind
Plus I'm puffing like an ounce more than I used to puff
Taking advice from these niggas but they ain't used to stuff
They had me thinking, ""Shit, I'm the one that moved the stuff
While he drive around town in brand new Coupes and stuff""
Swear to God, they had me practically hating his guts
As he approached I spoke, ""Jigga, whattup?""
[Chorus: Memphis Bleek & (Jay-Z)]
I done came up (uhh), put my life on the line (uhh)
Soaked the game up (yeah), now it's my time to shine
Time to change up (what?), no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine

[Verse 2: Jay-Z & Memphis Bleek]
Look at that fake smile he just gave me, it's breaking my heart
Should I school him or pull the tools out and just break him apart?
I felt his hatred it was harsh -- 'fore this faking shit start
I should take him in back of the building and blaze him
Uh-oh, this nigga Jay, he ain't slow, he musta picked up on the vibe
But had I not been so high, I woulda been able to hide
Tried to cover up myself, as I gave him a five
Hugged him as if I loved him, to the naked eye
It woulda seemed we was the closest, but to those that know us
Could see that something was about to go down
Stay focused, I'm trying to concentrate
But it's like he's reading my mind
As if he can see through this fog and all this weed in my mind
Could he see I had plans on, being the man
Ever since we first spoke and he put that G in my hand
And I gave it back to show him, I was down for the cause
As he approached (""Whattup Bleek?"") and I paused
[Chorus: Memphis Bleek & Jay-Z]
I done came up (uhh), put my life on the line (uhh)
Soaked the game up (yeah), now it's my time to shine
Time to change up (what?), no more second in line

Yeah, you done came up (uhh), put your life on the line (uhh)
Soaked the game up (uhh), now it's yo' time to shine (yeah)

Right, yo we wild out in Vegas, styled on haters
Mouthed off at the cops, outta cranberry drops
Copped whips the same color, we tighter than brothers
With different fathers but same mothers, this life don't love us
So 'til death do us, I'm never breaking my bond
Nigga, we Lex movers, V-12 pushers
As I stand
One leg of my pants up, in a stance like, ""And what?""
I know these niggas are feeding my mind cancer
But in time's the answer (woo!)
Seems mind-blowing, this weed and Hennessy
Got my mind going, trust me nigga, I'm knowing
Chicks used to ignore me
And my aunt saying I need 50, not 60/40
Oh God, don't let him control y'all
Your gun is my gun, your clip is my clip, baby
Your fun is my fun (uh huh), your bitch is my bitch
Any nigga trying to harm Jay, I'm feeling for you
I ain't only touching you, I'm killing your crew
Give it a year, you'll be sitting on a million or two
Records sold, nigga, perfect your role, geah
[Chorus: Memphis Bleek, (Jay-Z) & Both]
I done came up (uhh), put my life on the line
Soaked the game up (yeah), now it's my time to shine
Time to change up (what?), no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine (geah, geah)
I done came up (came up), put your life on the line (uhh)
Soaked the game up (game up), now it's yo' time to shine
Time to change up (change up), no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine

Yeah, you done came up, put your life on the line
Soaked the game up, now it's yo' time to shine
Time to change up, no more second in line
Yeah, yeah

Young Hov in the house, it's so necessary
Green Lantern in the house, so necessary
Why you fronting on me? Is that necessary?
You know you've become a star
Because you're the biggest target out there, right?
When everyone's on the court, they're coming for you
When the opposing player walks into that arena
They're thinkin of upstaging you
You're, you're like a trophy to them
They're thinkin' ""if I'm better than this guy
The spotlight turns on me""
So, you know you're a superstar because you're a marked man
And everyone's coming for you

The, the, the king
They wanna be the, the, the king
They wanna be the, the, the king
They wanna be the, the, the king (king)
[Verse 1: Jay-Z (Chris Martin)]
Inspired by Basquiat, my chariot's on fire
Everybody took shots, hit my body up, I'm tired
Build me up to break me down to build me up again
They like ""Hov', we need you back so we can kill your ass again""
Hov got flow though he's no Big and Pac, but he's close
How I'm 'posed to win? They got me fighting ghosts
Most kings (... get their heads cut off)
With the same sword they knight you they gon' good night you with
Shit, that's only half if they like you
That ain't even the half what they might do
Don't believe me, ask Michael
See Martin, see Malcolm
See Biggie, see Pac, see success and its outcome
See Jesus, see Judas
See Caesar, see Brutus
See success is like suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
When you succeed, prepare to be crucified, uhh
Media meddles, niggas sue you, you settle
Every step you take, they remind you you ghetto
So it's tough being Bobby Brown
To be Bobby then, you gotta be Bobby now
Now the question is, ""Is to have had and lost
Better than not having at all?""
Because dawg
[Chorus: Chris Martin & Run DMC sample]
Most kings get their heads cut off
Keep on climbing 'til you reach the top
Keep on coming if they ready or not
Most kings get their heads cut off
The, the, the king
They wanna be the, the, the king
They wanna be

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Uhh, everybody wanna be the king then shots ring
You laying on your balcony with holes in your dream
Or you Malcolm X-d out, get distracted by screams
Everybody get your hand off my jeans
Everybody look at you strange, say you changed
Like you work that hard to stay the same, uhh
Game stays the same, the name changes
So it's best for those to not overdose on being famous
Most kings get driven so insane
That they try to hit the same vein that Kurt Cobain did
So dangerous, so no strangers
Invited to the inner sanctum of your chambers
Load chambers, the enemy's approaching
So raise your draw bridge and drown 'em in the moat
Then, spirit I'm evoking
There's kings who've been awoken
From shots from those who was most close to them
They won't stop until you ghost to 'em
But real kings don't die
They become martyrs, let's toast to 'em
King Arthur, put a robe to him
Like James Brown, no the show ain't over
Until Rome's ruined
'Til the republic is overthrown
'Til my loyal subjects is over Hov'
Long live the king, no, the reign won't stop
They want my head on the chopping block
I won't die, nah
[Chorus: Chris Martin, Jay-Z & Run DMC sample]
Most kings get their heads cut off
Keep on climbing 'til you reach the top
Keep on coming if they ready or not
Most kings get their heads cut off
Keep on coming if they ready or not
Long live the king, know the reign won't stop
The, the, the king
They wanna be the, the, the king
They wanna be
Long live the, the, the king
They wanna be the, the, the king
They wanna be
Most kings get their heads cut off
Keep on climbing 'til you reach the top
Keep on coming if they ready or not"

Tell her bring some Ace of Spades no sparklers though
Private flights no hassle I just park and go

Oooooh, look what you created
Only got yourself to blame, I remember when you hated ooooh
Now you tell me take my time
How bout I just take your city make that muthaf-cker mine uh ha
I’m a underground king ho, I sit tall, I swang low
The game ain't always fair and thats the thing though
You can play your heart out everyone don’t get a ring though
You are in the presence of a champion
Bout to get a condo that I can fit your mansion in
You always be calling her, she ain’t never answering
You ain’t figured out I am the reason that she canceling
I be at the parties where you stuck outside and can’t come in
Call me Ron Burgundy y'all the other anchormen
Whats on the news trick, gossiping bout music
Cause rumours I’m the new shit and guess what it’s true bitch

I’m just waiting on my cue dog no pledge
Said she like all girls I turn that bitch co-ed
Threw on my track team handed my baton to her
Passed her blew her off, I chronic Veronica
Who got up on my nerves so I had to platonic her
No that ain't my girl but every leader needs a Monica
I’m the head of my estate ain't that ironic huh
I want the baddest chick to treat my stick like a thermometer
Ohh, I’m who they going ape shit over
I’m who your girlfriend acting like she ain't shit over
See broads over niggas but business over broads
See business equals money and money’s over all
I’m tryna move my momma from the ghettos to the meadows
Well she can’t stay in that fucking hood forever, forever
Was made for that Mick Jagger shit baggage check and a chick
Fast girls, faster whip, big chains master shit

I know I should've did that
I know it's gon' come right back
I know it's gon' destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get ya boy sent away
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it
It's inevitable that I'm... (fallin')

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Uhh, said where I would stop before I even started
When I get to one brick, then the game I would depart with
Got to one brick then I looked to the sky like:
""Sorry, God, I lied, but give me one more try"" (try)
Got to two bricks, new cars, new whips
But niggas never learn until they end up in the news clip
The irony of selling drugs is sort of like you using it
Guess it's two sides to what substance abuse is
Can't stop, won't stop, addicted to this new shit
Brand new convertibles, I'm so ruthless
Front row fight night, see how big my tube is
Fuck HD, nigga, see how clear my view is?
But there's a price for overdoing it
Doing it this big'll put you on the map, stick-up kids is out to tax
Plus the FBI boys with the cameras in the back
Damn...

When you should've fell back
Now you (fallin'), right into they lap
Fallin', they applauding, they screaming at the screen
Damn, you fucked up like your favorite movie scene
Godfather, Goodfellas, Scarface, Casino
You seen what that last run did to De Niro in Heat
Can't beat the odds, can't cheat the Gods
Can't blow too hard, life's a deck of cards
Now your tumbling is humbling, you're falling, you're mumbling
Under your breath like you knew this day was coming (fallin')
Now let's pray that arm candy
That you left your ex for stay down and come in handy
'Cause come January it gets cold, when the letters start to slow
And your commissary's low and lawyers screams appeal
Only thinking about a bill and your chances are nil
Damn, gravity's ill...

It's inevitable (but ya) fallin'

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
And you can't get up
All you do is push-up, pull-up, sit-up
Locked down the town now belongs to the squares
Who said they won't make the same mistake that got you there
And your arm candy sweet on 'em
And the women that you left for this heifer
Got a college degree coming
Bad news keeps coming, hard to keep something on your stomach
You're sick about what your life is becoming (fallin')
But your use-to's, has-beens, ragging bad about all the new dudes
Talking tough on the YouTube 'bout what you used to do
But that's old school to the new crew
They doing numbers like Sudoku
They're the new you, and it's damn near inevitable
They'll experience déja vu too
Fight and you'll never survive
Run and you'll never escape, so just fall from grace

[Intro: Notorious B.I.G. in a 1996 MTV interview]
Gotta try to stay above water, y'know?
Just stay busy, stay working
Puff told me, like, the key to this joint
The key to staying on top of things
Is treat everything like it's your first project, nomsayin'?
Like it's your first day, like, back when you was an intern
Like, that's how you try to treat things like, just stay hungry

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Y'all wanna know why he don't stop?
Y'all wanna know why he don't flop?
Let me tell you pe-people why
Came from the bottom of the block I
When I was born, it was sworn, I was never gon' be shit
Had to pull the opposite out this bitch
Had to get my ri-ide on
Eyes on the prize, Shawn knew I had to
Had to had to get these chips
Had to make moves like Olajuwon
Started out selling dimes and nicks
Graduated to a brick
No exaggeration, my infatuation with the strip
Legendary like a schoolboy
Crushin' merely nearly every every chick
Heavy shit – that's how schoolboy got whipped
And got left on some Just Me, Myself and I
On some Trugoy shit
Had to voyage to a place of, to a place of no return
Had to play with fire and get burned
Only way the boy ever gon' learn
Had to lay way in the cut, 'til I finally got my turn
Now I'm on top in the spot that I earned
[Chorus: JAY-Z]
It's my life, it's my pain and my struggle
The songs that I sing to you is my everything
Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first
And my thirst is the same as when I came
It's my joy and my tears
And the laughter it brings to me, it's my everything

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Like I never rode in a limo
Like I just dropped flows to a demo
Like it's '92 again and I got O's in the rental
Back in the Stu' again
No prob' livin' was a whole lot simple
When you think back, you thought that
You would never make it this far
Then you take advantage of the luck you handed
Or the talent you been given
Ain't no half steppin', ain't no, no slippin'
Ain't no different from a block that's hittin'
Gotta get it while the getting's good
Gotta strike while the iron's hot, before you stop
Then you gotta bid it, good riddance
Goodbye! This is my second major breakup
My first was with a pager
With a hooptie, a cookpot and the GAME
This one's with the stu', with the stage, with the fortune
Maybe not the fortune, but certainly the FAME
[Chorus: JAY-Z]
It's my life, it's my pain and my struggle
The songs that I sing to you is my everything
Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first
And my thirst is the same as when I came
It's my joy and my tears
And the laughter it brings to me, it's my everything
Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first
And my thirst like the first song I sang

Niggas thought we was crazy, man, remember uhh

Your accounting was crazy wrong and shit
But we still put it together
Biggs, whassup?
Member we went to St. Thomas and uh (John Meneilly)
Your dog peed on homie leg and shit
At his crib, I think that was Rudy
And they was having a lil trouble with the pool
You and Ty-Ty was laughing
Emory was there; whattup, Emory?
What up, Ty? Hip-Hop, whattup, man?
Aye, aye Hop, you ain't, you ain't have no uhh
You ain't have no muh'fuckin seat on your, on your bicycle

You Know My Steez,Gang Starr,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'alternative', 'jazz']","[Guru talking]
That makes me know that what we're doing
We had the right idea in the beginning
And and we just need to maintain our focus and elevate
We what we do we update our formulas
We have certain formulas but we update em (oh right)
With the times and everything y'know
So y'know the rhyme style is elevated
The style of beats is elevated but it's still Guru and Premier
And it's always a message involved

[Intro]
The real (The real)
Hip-hop (Hip-hop)
MCing (MCing), and DJing (DJing)
From your own mind (From your own mind)
You know? (You know?)
I, I guess right now we should start the show

[Verse 1: Guru]
Who's the suspicious character
Strapped with the sounds profound?
Similar to rounds spit by Derringers
You're in the Terrordome, like my man Chuck D said
It's time to dethrone you clones and all you knuckleheads
‘Cause MC's have used up extended warranties
While real MC's and DJ's are a minority
But right about now, I use my authority
‘Cause I'm like the Wizard, and you look lost like Dorothy
The horror be when I return for my real people
Words that split wigs hittin' like some double Desert Eagles
Sportin' caps pulled low, and baggy slacks
Subtractin' all the rappers who lack over Premier's tracks
Severe facts have brought this rap game to near collapse
So as I have in the past, I whoop ass
Droppin' lyrics that be hotter than sex and candle wax
And one-dimensional MC's can't handle that
While the world's revolvin', on its axis
I come with mad lovin', plus the illest warlike tactics
The wilderness is filled with this
So many people searchin' for false bliss
I'm here with the skills you've missed
The rejected stone is now the cornerstone
Sorta like the master builder when I make my way home
You know my steez
[Hook]
You know my steez
Let 'em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live, keep it live)
To the beat y'all

[Verse 2]
The beat is sinister, Premo makes you relax
I'm like the minister, when I be lacin' the wax
I be bringin' salvation through the way that I rap
And you know, and I know, I'm nice like that
Work through worldly problems, I got the healing power
When the mic's within my reach, I'm feelin' more power
Stealin' at least three minutes of every rap radio hour
It's often easier for one to give advice
Than it is for a person to run one's own life
That's why I can't be caught up in all the hype
I keep my soul tight and let these lines take flight
The apparatus gets blessed, and suckers get put to rest
No more of the unpure, I got the cure for this mess
The wackness is spreadin' like the plague
MC's lucked up and got paid
But still can't make the fuckin' grade
How many times are wannabe's gonna lie?
Yo, they must wanna fry
They can't touch the knowledge I personify
I travel through the darkness, carryin' my torch
The illest soldier, when I'm holdin' down the fort
You know my steez
(You know my steez)
[Hook]
Let 'em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
You know my steez
Let 'em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
You know my steez
Let 'em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
You know my steez
Let 'em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
The mic

[Verse 3]
On the microphone, you know that I'm one of the best yet
Some punks ain't paid all of their debts yet
Tryin' to be fly, ridin' high on the jet
Set with juvenile rhymes, makin' fake-ass death threats
Big deal, like En Vogue, here's somethin' you can feel
Styles more tangible, and image more real
For some time now, I've held the scrolls and manuscripts
When it's time to go all out, you be like, ""Damn, he flipped!""
Now I'm sick, fed up with the bullshit
Got the lyrical full clip, givin' you a verbal asswhip
Don't trip, it's the gifted prolific one
Known as Bald Head Slick, why is the press all on my di-dick?
My style be wilder than a kamikaze pilot
Don't try it, I'm about to start more than a friggin' riot
Styles unsurpassable, and nuccas that's suckas
Yo, them motherfuckers are harrassable
For I be speakin' from my parables and carry you beyond
The mic's either a magic wand
Or it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb
Then I grab your palm, no pulse, you're gone
And if you thought we'd lose our niche
In this rap shit, you way wrong
I stay up, I stay on, shine bright like neon
Your song's pathetic, synthetic like Rayon
Fat beats, they play on
Want dope rhymes? Put me on
Word is bond
You know my steez"

Miss. Can I call you, Miss?
I got your number so like, can I call you, miss?
She said, ""You don't need a phone to reach me
Cause vocal thoughts lead to arguments.""
I'm sure you won't believe me
If I said I was talkin' to God and shit
But it's all legit, all of it
So just listen to the way we talk and lift off with this
She said, ""I was eyeing you from afar
From a star, I watched you from someone's car""
The glare of light in that person's rear view
When the wind blows, that means that I'm near you
I said, ""I hear you, miss. Wait, what's your last name?""
She said, ""Dess.""
I said, ""God, You're a mess.""
Lets, talk and reflect. Walk with me
Tell me how hard I've been blessed

[Chorus]
Show me who you are and I will do the same
I will never do you wrong
I know better than to hurt you
I can't make mistakes
I swear I love you more
Than anyone can
I think you understand me, baby
[Verse 2]
I said, ""Do you get mad when I talk about
The bitches I done fucked in the past?""
She said, ""Nah, but there are ladies who do, so
Don't get stuck in the past""
I said, ""God you taught me a lot, an awful lot
But I feel awful, a lot.""
I sold my soul to myself, I'm so alone
Over domes I go, with every poem thrown
From my point of view, everything points to you
But you point to me, humanity is annoying me
She said, ""You are far from a boy to me
Your noise is sweet, no way you're annoying me
Join the beat, become your own instrument
I love you, and I'm watching. Listening
Your negative thoughts are just me hugging you tighter
Pressure makes you write hard, so fuck it, it's fire.""

[Chorus]
Show me who you are and I will do the same
I will never do you wrong
I know better than to hurt you
I can't make mistakes
I swear I love you more
Than anyone can
I think you understand me, baby
[Verse 3]
""Don't leave me miss,"" I said
As she walked from the bar
She was off to the stars
I was drunk from her potent presence
No liquor involved but I was copacetic
She beamed down and said
""Your bars are my lullabies
So hard, but calm and I love it, why?
You're Charles Hamilton, but act like you're just another guy
As if you don't reside up in the sky
And you worry bout' goin' over nigga's heads
And bitches fed, cause you said, they was givin' head
I won't lie, you are brash with delivery
But you're not one to dash from your inner beast
Besides, I ask you for chivalry
You have what you've given me
It's mad elementary
This kinda love can last for a century
But you're Charles and your passion is history
Forever.""

[Chorus]
Show me who you are and I will do the same
I will never do you wrong
I know better than to hurt you
I can't make mistakes
I swear I love you more

I swear this is the realest love song I have ever written
It's not a love song, it's a real song
Uh
It's Charles Hamilton
Blame me, right? Shit

[Verse 1]
Well well, Here we are. Another argument
Yeah I know. It's my fault. I always start this shit
This some retarded shit. Calling bitches yamps on my blog and shit
Why do I think that's not the heart of it?
You have a problem with you, not me. Cause you got me
I need you aqui. I look at other women, and it's you I see
I do not need to be abused by thee
You do shit for my attention. It's senseless
You're mine period. Check the end of the sentence. Simone
Took up so much space in my dome, I forget my own face when I roam
I'm more now. Star time. Hard times have passed me
I'm the driver. Crying time is in the back seat
So why do you insist on being in the back with me?
And you get tight when other women wanna ask for me
[Verse 2]
Before I met you I caught mad bodies
You mad probably, but they mad they ain't got me
Copy, I told your ass sit there cocky, but nah. You wanna black
And now you wanna chat with some otha' niggas
Sending texts with the phone I bought you
I know you ain't showing them tricks that I taught you
Going to see them niggas in the shit that I bought you
If I wasn't Charles, I would flip an Ike on you
This is my heart you playin' around with
When niggas I eye-ball you, they want a round fist
But you're not use to the attention I guess
As if your hands ain't on that beating shit in my chest
Bitch I'm obssesed. Getting a rest
Turnin' down celebs. Burn an ounce to the head
I'm certain I'm about to just let go. But no, I love you
But being alone is something that I can adjust to

[Verse 3]
Keep promisin' you gon' be better
Cause you know me better
On some OD letter
But I feel so alone sometimes
Which you, so much so, I bet you think I wrote this shit against you
This instrumental was made out of pain, that you caused
Bitch stay out my brain. Stay in my heart. I gave you a part
Love 2.0, I'm state of the art. The only thing that changed is the way that I talk
Everyday in my thoughts. How could you say that I'm lost?
You call me selfish. Shit I was before I met you
I let you in, how could you not feel special?
Don't wanna hurt you, feels like I might. To be real, I can fight
But I'm a man, kinda flyy. If something does happen, blame it on rap
You can hate me, I'm whack. But I'mma still say

So Jay I appreciate it, hell of a stepping stone
Wonder if he see it in my eyes I'm trying to get the throne
Wonder if the people know how many nights I spent alone
Making beats writing rhymes, thinking deep fighting time
I'm getting better but wasn't getting younger
And all that time can make the most confident nigga wonder
But never doubt it or allowed that shit to phase me yo
Just switch my thoughts up like the stations on the radio nigga now I am
[Chorus]
And they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell them
It's the Fayettenam
Put your glasses and your glasses and your glasses to the sky
This is the last call for alcohol
This is the warm-up!
So get your back up off the wall

[Verse 2]
Now may I never slip up or let my grip up
I know my girl be praying Lord just keep his pants zipped up -
Now if some groupie bitch is on his dick then make it's stiff up, at least give the nigga common sense to wrap his dick up
Toast, let’s lift up our glasses, then sip up
We fly past they look up
They don't last they give up
They don't blast we clip up then empty
And indeed we hit the target yes these niggas think they the shit and they ain't even farted yet
Style incomplete like a garbage ass quarterback
My offense is for real, ay fuck sack, niggas getting coffined in the Ville
Way too often and it feels wrong
New York niggas fuck with me, I got 'em singing Ville songs
Guess it's only right because we grew up singing they shit
Big shit, Mase shit, Nas shit, Jay shit
Time for a Carolina nigga to take his place with the greats
A slim nigga making bold statement
Uh, ay J. Cole how you do that there? I hear you blowing up my nigga
I'm like, true that yea
In NY but smile every time I flew back there
That Carolina, Fayettenam oh yea my crew back there
I go home been so long they saying, you back here? -
Took a turn for the worst boy don't move back here
Don't do that, yo who dat?
He rep the Ville when he spit it told you he be back with a record deal and he did it
Nigga, fuck spinning on my pivot homie, I'm finna travel till 'refs blow the whistle on me
I got a whole fucking city that's just sitting on me
But it fits on my back, my state is sitting on that
Will I drop? I think not I get up while they stop-like a sleeve on tank tops
They ain't give it all they got so they flop
So hey watch, how I'm finna take their spot
Now I'm starting and they not-let me show you how to stay hot
I play not, man I'm killing em even your idols feeling em dog
The same nigga used to chill in the mall
While they were still in the mall, I was up there spilling my rap
The hero fighting villains just to put the Ville on the map
[Chorus]
And they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell them
It's the Fayettenam
Put your glasses and your glasses and your glasses to the sky
This is the last call for alcohol
This is the warm-up!
So get your back up off the wall

[Outro]
Yeah man so shit, this was The Warm Up
Um, what can I say, what can I say?
If you heard The Come Up that was about just a lil nigga from North Carolina man
Fayettnam to be exact
Moved to NYC, chasing the dream
I used college, if y'all niggas don't know, I used college as a tool to get to New York
I ain't have no family up here or nothing like that, I came up here on a scholarship, nigga went to college
And the whole time I ain't even think I would have to finish college, I just thought I'd be signed by my freshman year so I wouldn't have to finish college
But it didn't happen like that obviously, a nigga graduated and things started falling into place
I got more focused, I dropped The Come Up
And I look at The Come Up like, how kinda like how I was in high school
Just picture this, The Warm Up is about a nigga who did not make the team when he tried out and I know it's a lotta niggas who know that feeling man
You try out, you think you deserve to be one the team and you go that day to look at the cut-list
You wake up and you can't even sleep, you're like, ""Damn I'm gon' make the team, I did my thing at tryouts.""
You go to the list. All the niggas is looking at their names on the list, some niggas is like, ""Aww shit I see my name nigga I'm good, I'm good nigga I'm good, I see my name.""
And you're looking for your name, and you kinda play in the back, tryna wait for niggas to clear out cause you're not sure
And you go to the list and your name ain't there
And you're like, ""How the fuck did I not make this team? I'm better than him, I'm better than him, I'm better than him.""
So a lotta niggas either quit or some niggas go harder and so that's kinda how I took the rap shit when I put out The Come Up
Cause ever since I was 15 I thought I was supposed to be signed
But you know, shit, everything happens for a reason
So shit fast forward to The Warm Up, this just me, like you know, me being that nigga that's practicing and making sure it's no way, it's undeniable that when I go to tryouts, there's no fucking way the coach is passing up on me, my nigga
So that's what this whole mixtape was about and lo and behold, you know
As I'm finishing the mixtape, the deal comes
Thank God, I'm blessed. Everything happens for a reason. And it couldn't have been with a more fucking, with a better fucking squad
You know the niggas I got on the squad if you listen to this then you might have heard who I signed with, I ain't even gon' blast it off like that
Shoutouts to, you know, Mark Pitts, definitely
Shoutout to my nigga Mike Rooney, my nigga E, shoutout to my whole fucking crew, man
That's The Warm Up is about man
RG what's good, Mike Shaw, my nigga Mez, Mez held me down, nigga
More than anybody in the whole fucking, in the whole crew, honestly
So shit, let's get it, man
We got a lotta shit for '09, '010, '011, '0 goddamn 35
That's all I got man, that's The Warm Up
I made the team
So when you go from making the team, now what you gotta do nigga, you gotta start
You gotta be a starter, you gotta make it to college
You gotta make it from college to the league, nigga
Trust me, I ain't get no deal and fucking relax man
I feel like I ain't made it yet period nigga
And that's all I really gotta say yo, it's The Warm Up
Thank you for listening man
Yeah"

All that I'm given
It's this pain that I'm living (The remix, the remix)
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that?

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Why is garbage music sellin' a lot?
Why is the music industry state of mind real far from Hip Hop?
Why vote republican if you black?
Why build more jails, less schools cause we under attack?
Why keep the four pound in the air?
The revolution will not be televised if around here
Why keep my right fist in the sky?
I let them know that ""We Gonna Make It"", don't plan our demise
Why you gotta teach your kids on your own?
Cause when you get in the zone, they bringing you in, you both getting cloned
Why we still gotta pray to Allah?
It's Hip Hop, this the New World Order and they playin' us hard
Why rappers getting protection?
Why the country ain't flipped when they jerked the votes the last election?
Why die for all my beliefs?
I gotta look at my kids I rather smile then cry when he's sleep
That's why
[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
Why? Why they got me strugglin', why?
All the brothers locked behind bars, why they pinning me?
Chained up in the system going crazy
I better leave my pistol on, why?

[Verse 2: Common]
Why do they say I changed for a girl?
Why you worried bout my clothes if my flow gonna change the world?
Why you wait 'till you 30 then try to be hard?
Why I gotta have religion if I believe in God?
Why is Bush acting like he trying to get Osama?
Why don't we impeach him and elect Obama?
Why ain't Rick James remembered for classic hits?
Why do we remember it for smackin a *bitch*?
Why did Ricky Williams retire, they mad in Miami
Why did Justin sell Janet out and go to the Grammy's?
Why you kill on every song, why you frown at the screen?
So many thrones, why we argue who is the King?
Why it's over for gangsta, why it's over for bling?
Why they hype Britney up, they know she can't sing?
Why a whip and a chain the black american dream?
Why I know it in my heart it remains unseen?

What is the answer, got a suggestion, here's an example
Won't we build our own airline, states, and highways?
Fly to Africa, do some trades with Zimbabwe
Why did Malcolm's mission die with the man?
Why we ain't pick it up where he left it and carry out his plan?
Why the merger try to exclude L.A. Reid?
He brought you Usher, OutKast top-selling CD's
Why do half America got AIDS?
Why do schools care about your son's braids more than they care for his grades?
Why they hate our white t-shirts and hats turned backwards?
And why is Jesus Christ never played by black actors?
And why there ain't a MC that can touch me nor budge me?
And why is Nas the best thing in rap since Chuck D?
And why this record ain't sell 5 mill yet?

Tell me why is it the money motivates me but the love keeps me grounded? (I don't know)
Why my cases ain't get thrown out?
Why team USA keep gettin' blown out?
Why the Democratic party ain't gettin' with me?
Why they still hangin' black bodies in Mississippi?
Yea, why did governor McGreevey get caught with a lizard?
Why they take away Shyne's phone calls and visits?
Why I been hot for 7 years?
Why the new M5 come with 7 gears?
Please tell me why y'all keep makin' that trash?
Why they reinstating the draft, why is it so much hatin' you have?

Uhh, uhh, yeah
First they love me then they hate me then they love me again
They love me again (Uhh)
Let's take a trip down
I gotcha

[Verse]
Let's take a trip down memory lane at the cemetery
Rain, grey skies, seems at the end of every
Young black life is this line, ""Damn, him already?
Such a good kid,"" got us pourin' Henn' already
Liquor to the curb for my niggas up above
When it cracks through the pavement, that's my way of sendin' love
So give BIG a hug, tell Aaliyah I said, ""Hi""
'Til the next time I see her, on the other side
He was just some thug that caught some slugs
And we loved him 'cause, in him, we saw some of us
He walked like us, talked like us
His back against the wall, nigga fought like us, damn
Poor Isis, that's his mama name
Mama ain't strong enough to raise no boy, what's his father name?
Shorty never knew him, though he had his blood in him
Hot temper, mama said he act just like her husband
Daddy never fucked with him, so the streets raised him
Isis blamin' herself, she wish she could've saved him
Damn near impossible, only men can raise men
He was his own man, not even him can save him
He put his faith in a .38 in his waist
But when you live by the gun, you die by the same fate
End up dead before 38 and umm
That's the life of us raised by winter, it's a cold world
Ol' girl turned to coke, tried to smoke her pain away
Isis' life just ended on that rainy day
When she got the news her boy body could be viewed
Down at the city morgue, opened the drawer, saw him nude
Her addiction grew, prescription drugs, sippin' brew
Angel dust dipped in woo!
She slipped into her own fantasy world
Had herself pregnant by a different dude
But reality bites and this is her life
He wasn't really her husband, though he called her wife
It was just this night when moon was full
And the stars were just right, and the dress was real tight
Had her soundin' like Lisa Lisa
I wonder if I take you home, will you still love me after this night?
Mike was the hard head from around the way
That she wanted all her life, shit, she wanted all the hype
Used to hold on tight when he wheelied on the bike
He was a Willie all her life, he wasn't really the one to like
It was a dude named Sha who would really treat her right
He wanted to run to the country to escape the city life
But Isis liked this Broadway life
She loved the Gucci sneakers, the red, green and whites
Hangin' out the window when she first seen him fight
She was so turned on that she had to shower twice
How ironic it would be some fight that
Turned into a homicide that'll alter their life
See Mike at 32 was still on the scene
Had a son, 15, that he never saw twice
Sure he saw him as an infant, but he disowned him like
""If that was my son, he would look much different
See I'm light-skinned and that baby there's dark""
So it's mama's baby, papa's maybe
Mike was still crazy out there runnin' the streets (Fuck niggas want?)
Had his old reliable .38 gun in his reach
It's been fourteen years, him and Isis ain't speak
He runnin' around like life's a peach
'Til one day, he approached this thug that had a mean mug
And it looked so familiar that he called him ""Young Cuz""
Told him get off the strip but the boy ain't budge (Fuck you)
Instead he pulled out a newer .38 snub
He clearly had the drop but the boy just paused (Hold up)
There was somethin' in this man's face he knew he seen before
It's like lookin' in the mirror, seein' his self more mature
And he took it as a sign from the Almighty Lord
You know what they say about he who hesitates in war
(What's that?) He who hesitates is lost
He can't explain what he saw before his picture went blank
The old man didn't think, he just followed his instinct
Six shots into his kin out of the gun
Niggas be a father, you're killin' your son
Six shots into his kin out of the gun
Niggas, be a father, you killin' your sons

Rosa Parks sat so Martin Luther could walk
Martin Luther walked so Barack Obama could run
Barack Obama ran so all the children could fly

Hello Miss America, hey pretty lady

Good morning, America, sorry I woke ya
I just had to say what's on my mind, like Oprah
Got the whole world like wide open, his mouth
Same reason during Katrina that he opened his house
Helped raise food, helped raise water so
God knows who can feed their son or their daughter
Say what I wanna say cause I'ma say, say it
Say what I'm gonna say cause I'm a taxpayer
Bill O'Reilly, eat a dick, nice try
You're really being a racist asshole in a nice tie
And tell Dennis Miller his show suck anyway
And I rather watch Jimmy Kimmel any day
I got some white friends and a white Benz
Parked out front and, yeah, also white rims
'Cept my president is black and I'ma be heard
Don't ever try to tell me now I can't say the b word
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamn if my rims ain't too
My money's light green and my jewels light gray
I'm in a lux t-white, nah I much too paid

Fuckin with niggas you shouldn't

[Verse: Jay-Z]
People was poor before the hurricane came
Before the downpour poured, it was like when Mary J. sang
Everyday it rains, so everyday the pain
Went ignored and I'm sure ignorance was to blame
But life is a chain, cause and effected
Niggas off the chain, because they affected
It's a dirty game, it's whatever is effective
From weed to sellin' 'caine, gotta put that in effect, shit
Wouldn't you loot? If you didn't have the loot
Baby needed food and you was stuck on the roof
And helicopters swoop down just to get a scoop
Through his telescopic lens, but he didn't scoop you
And the next five days, no help ensued
They called you a refugee because you seek refuge
And the Commander-in-Chief, just flew by
Didn't stop, I know he had a couple seats
Just rude Jet blue, he's not, jet flew by the spot
What if he ran out of jet fuel and just dropped
Huh, that woulda been somethin' to watch
Helicopters doin' fly-bys to take a couple shots
Couple portraits, then ignored 'em
He’d be just another Bush surrounded by a couple orchids
Poor kids, just 'cause they was poor kids
Left them on they porches, same old story in New Orleans
Silly rappers, cause we got a couple Porsches
MTV stopped by to film our fortresses
We forget the unfortunate
Sure, I ponied up a mil' but I didn't give my time
So in reality I didn't give a dime
Or a damn, I just put my monies in the hands
Of the same people that left my people stranded
Nothin' but a bandit, left them folks abandoned
Damn, that money we gave was just a band-aid
Can't say we better off than we was before
In synopsis, this is my Minority Report
Can't say we better off than we was before
In synopsis, this is my Minority Report

So many times I'm, coverin' my eyes
Peekin' through my fingers, tryin' to hide my
Frustration, at the way, that we treat

Turn on the TV, seein' the pain
Sayin' such a shame, then tryin' to go on with my life
Of that, I too am guilty
(Seems like we don't even care)
So we send a little money, tell 'em it's alright
To be able to sleep at night
You will pay that price, but some of these folks
Has lost they whole life

And then it wasn't on the nightly news no mo'
Suddenly it didn't matter to you no mo'
It went on and almost nothin' changed

Talkin' about niggas from Compton
They're no comp and they truly ain't stomping
Tim Dog, a Black man's task
I'm so bad I'll whip Superman's ass
All you suckers that riff on the West Coast
I'll diss and spray your ass like a roach
You think you're cool with your curls and your shades
I'll roll thick and you'll be yellin' out, ""Raid""
A hard brother that lives in New York
Where suckers are hard and we don't have to talk
Shut your mouth 'fore we come out stompin'
Hey, yo Eazy!, fuck Compton

[Chorus]
Fuck Compton
Fuck Compton (Yeah)
Fuck Compton (Oh, yeah)
Fuck 'em
[Verse 2]
Why you dissing Eazy? 'Cause the boy ain't shit
Chew him with tobacco, and spit him in shit
I'll crush Ice Cube, I'm cool with Ice-T
But N.W.A ain't shit to me
Dre, beatin' on Dee from ""Pump it Up!""?
Step to the Dog and get fucked up
I'm simplistic, imperialistic, idealistic
And I'm kicking the ballistics
Having that gang war
We want to know what you're fighting for
Fighting over colors?
All that gang shit's for dumb motherfuckers
But you go on thinking you're hard
Come to New York and we'll see who gets robbed
Take your jheri curl, take your black hats
Take your wack lyrics and your bullshit tracks
Now you're mad and you're thinking about stomping
Well, I'm from the South Bronx, fuck Compton

[Chorus]
Fuck Compton (Yeah)
Fuck Compton (Yeah, haha)
Fuck Compton
Fuck 'em
[Interlude]
Yo, it's about time we got somebody from the South Bronx
Speakin' on them wack-ass rappers from Compton (Yeah)
Know what, man? They really ain't shit

[Verse 3]
Tim Dog and I'm the best from the East
And all this Compton shit must cease
So keep your eyes on the prize
And don't jeopardize my wife 'cause that's not wise
You really think that you can rhyme?
Well come and get some of this loaded TEC-9
Buck-buck-buck! Shots are cold gunning
And you'll really be a hundred miles and running
You wanna play? Go ride in a sleigh
I'm so large I fucked Michel'le
In the bathroom we was bonin'
You shoulda heard how the bitch was moanin'
Do, do, boo-do, doo-doo
Do, do, do-do, do, do
Shut the fuck up bitch, you can't sing
You sound like a kid playing on a swing (Fuck you!)
I'm the man at hand to run the band that's in command
You know who the fuck I am
Tim Dog, what's my motherfucking name?
Tim Dog, that's my motherfucking game
So whether you think that I'm just a myth
The riff, the lift, the gift, the if, the fifth
The shift, the spliff, that's in control to hold
To fold, to bold and make an ache and take and fake
Woo, and I'm still too great
[Outro]
Fuck Compton
Fuck Compton (Yeah)
Fuck Compton
Yeah, this a little somethin' to let you know
That these West Coast rappers ain't takin' over
'Cause I'ma say out the South Bronx
And we ain't havin' that shit
Tim Dog, peace out
Fuck 'em"

Niggas hatin', I'll forget about it, Guido
All you do is call 9-1-1, Reno
I'd appreciate it if you didn't fuck with me
Cause I don't fuck with rats and yo' hood is a Chuck E. Cheese
Catch that bitch in that car suckin' these
All the seats down cause she still on her fuckin' knees

Guns imported straight from Zamunda (City)
We party, party, party, get wasted (Rémy)
Act like you don't know and I will make you a believer
My mama said my daddy was a G, and I believe her
Both of y'all dogs like a golden retriever
You see the apple don't fall far from the tree, bro
Life, can't complain, but I might go to prison

Only thing I'm missin' is the money and the women

Louis on my feet, Kanye West's
Aim for the head, boy, no need for the vests

Teddy protein, bitch, put it in yo' breakfast
I'm fly as fuck like I was related to the Jetsons
(?), who wanna ride with me?
Nine in my Levis, skinny jeans won't fit me

Everyday my birthday, this young nigga gifted
Seven-figure nigga still reppin' 850

Now I'm at the mall, no money, don't trip
Pain got a car the color Whoopie Goldberg's lips

Plus I got a gun the color of yo' girlfriend tongue-ring
They be like, ""Them Nappy Boy niggas is on something, this shit bumping""

Oh my god, I’m so cool turn the air down
And I will still ice your grill like a stare down
Take the stairs down, you’re not on my level
Hoes wanna stare now like I’m rockin’ a bezzle, treble
Why you so high?
Did you smoke yet
Ohh yes, I’m the illest, place no bets
Don’t want your money and I don’t gamble
Rap MJ and I got that Game 6 handle
Ain't this sample familiar, yep
Larry this is tough, nobody killed it yet
Except the rookie looking vet
Who dress like he get no nookie but could be good in bed
Take a looky at the bully and the pet
Who got every last one of these pseudo bully’s pets
You’re now looking at 2Pac the rocker
Making NBA Jams like boom-shak-a-laka

Harlem prince with my darling Nicky’s silly temper
Cool demeanor, thanks for the guitar
Are we cool Jenniea? Hope so
But however the boat floats, I don’t know
Either way I’m gonna flow
O no, like Yoko
Chillin’ in my linen (Lennon) while I’m grinin’ from the ceiling
Top of the world ya’ll, not gonna curl ya’ll
I heard ya’ll, pink ain't just for girls ya’ll
Just take a look at the dude with absurd bars
You never heard Charles, then you ignorant, def
I piped the fat lady, bring a new singer
A blues singer, who’s blue?
Not Steve’s aminal, here’s a new clue
Boo hoo, the color of your tears, Sonic
But pink is the color of the year, every year
Is it clear?

And make you see only what I want you to

Not even. I'm honestly rude, take a second
You gotta love my honesty, dude
I could possibly prove how much my cockiness rules
When I body these fools
Cause most of these rappers is actors
While attacking, I'll just black on 'em like abra cadabra
Fact and the fact lets add and subtract to practice your rapping
And go somewhere and get crap in the bathroom
It's my duty to prove I'm the shit
So is it cocky when I say that I'm why music exists?
No one is fuckin' with me

Get out. The exit is right over there

Me crashing is a thing of the past
Crash is a drug term and I'm bringin' it crack

Forget that. See, I ain't tryna be nice
But I'm nice, therefore, I ain't tryna be nice
I spit one bar, and you were jockin' me twice
I spit one bar, and you were jockin' me twice

Im Awesome,Spose,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop']","[Intro: Spose and Cam Groves]
Awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome
I don't necessarily have to be here for this
Can I...
I'm gonna keep the headphones though

[Chorus: Spose]
Motherfucker, I'm awesome!
No you're not, dude, don't lie
I'm awesome!
I'm drivin' around in my mom's ride
I'm awesome!
A quarter of my life gone by
And I met all my friends online
Motherfucker, I'm awesome!
I will run away from a brawl
I'm awesome!
There's no voice mail, nobody called
I'm awesome!
I can't afford to buy eight balls
And I talk to myself on my Facebook wall
[Verse 1: Spose]
You know my pants sag low (low)
Even though (though) that went out of style
Like ten years ago (go)
Spose, I got the swagger of a cripple
I got little biceps
Getting fatter in the middle
And lyrically I'm not the best
Physically the opposite of Randy Moss, and yet
So preposterous
Feel the awesomeness
The most obnoxious guest up at the sausage fest
Oh yes
The girls are repulsed
So I hide in my hood like I'm joining a cult
I'm as nervous as my cat, ol' Dirty Curtis
All my writtens are bitten and
All my verses are purchased
Me? I'll never date an actress
Got too many back zits
Plus, my whole home aroma is cat piss
Every show I do is poorly promoted
And if you like this
It's cause my little sister wrote it

Motherfucker, I'm awesome!
No, you're not, dude, don't lie

Check it out
I'm from Maine and I don't hunt (nope)
And I can't ski
Smoke weed but I can't roll blunts
Find me whipped by my wifey
My neck not icy
Eatin' at McDonald's because Subway's pricey
Ha, and my uni-brow is plucked
Just asked my mom if I could borrow ten bucks
She's like, ""For what?
Blunt wraps and some Heinekens?
You skinny prick, go get a gym membership and vitamins!""
I'm like, ""Mom please, don't blame it on me
I got my bad habits from you, Dad, and Aunt Steve.""
My attitude's sour but my futon's sweet
And the hair on my ass, it is Jumanji
Suit un-tailored, ringtone Taylor Swift
Can't tweet up on my Twitter
'Cause I haven't done shit
Bank account red, body ungroomed
The only good thing about me is I'm off stage soon

No, you're not, dude don't lie

Furthermore I am cornier than Ethanol
Cheesier than Provolone
I spent ages eight to ten living in a motorhome
With a ego the size of Tim Duncan
Even though I got shit for brains like a blumpkin
I'm twenty-four, serving lobster rolls
Because I spent a decade filling Optimos
And I'm not even the bomb in Maine
On my game, I'm only about as sexy as John McCain
Now put your hands up
If you have nightmares
If you wouldn't man up if there was a fight here
If you got dandruff
If you drink light beer
I'm outta breath

But I'm awesome!
No, you're not, dude don't lie

I'm drivin' around in my mom's ride

Look at me, I'm white and nerdy
I wanna roll with the gangstas
But so far they all think I'm too white and nerdy

First in my class here at MIT
Got skills, I'm a champion at D&D
M.C. Escher—that's my favorite ""M.C.""
Keep your 40, I'll just have an Earl Grey tea
My rims never spin, to the contrary
You'll find that they're quite stationary
All of my action figures are cherry
Stephen Hawking's in my library
My MySpace page is all totally pimped out
Got people beggin' for my Top 8 spaces
Yo, I know pi to a thousand places
Ain't got no grills, but I still wear braces
I order all of my sandwiches with mayonnaise
I'm a whiz at Minesweeper—I could play for days
Once you see my sweet moves, you're gonna stay amazed
My fingers movin' so fast I'll set the place ablaze
There's no killer app I haven't run (Run)
At Pascal, well, I'm number one (One)
Do vector calculus just for fun
I ain't got a gat but I got a soldering gun (What?)
""Happy Days"" is my favorite theme song
I could sure kick your butt in a game of ping pong
I'll ace any trivia quiz you bring on
I'm fluent in JavaScript as well as Klingon
Here's the part I sing on

They see me roll on my Segway
I know in my heart they think I'm white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Can't you see I'm white and nerdy?
Look at me, I'm white and nerdy
I'd like to roll with the gangstas
Although it's apparent I'm too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
I'm just too white and nerdy
How'd I get so white and nerdy?

[Verse 2]
I've been browsin', inspectin'
X-Men comics, you know I collect 'em
The pens in my pocket, I must protect 'em
My ergonomic keyboard never leaves me bored
Shopping online for deals on some writable media
I edit Wikipedia
I memorized Holy Grail really well
I can recite it right now and have you ""ROTFLOL""
I got a business doing websites
When my friends need some code, who do they call?
I do HTML for 'em all
Even made a homepage for my dog, yo
I got myself a fanny pack
They were havin' a sale down at The Gap
Spend my nights with a roll of bubble wrap
Pop, pop, hope no one sees me, gettin' freaky
I'm nerdy in the extreme and whiter than sour cream
I was in AV Club and Glee Club and even the Chess Team
Only question I ever thought was hard
Was do I like Kirk or do I like Picard?
Spend every weekend at the Renaissance Fair
Got my name on my underwear
[Chorus]
They see me strollin', they laughin'
And rollin' their eyes 'cause I'm so white and nerdy
Just because I'm white and nerdy
Just because I'm white and nerdy
All because I'm white and nerdy
Holy cow, I'm white and nerdy!
I wanna bowl with the gangstas
But, oh well, it's obvious I'm white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
I'm just too white and nerdy
Look at me, I'm white and nerdy"

Test 'em, tear drops, violent times of war
Hell or love? Bones crush silently
Flesh pierced from swords
Heads roll over rose petals
Horse stands on hind legs
Here come the hero, old rebels come in brigades
Nine's sprayed thru champagne bottles
The boy, man and the slave follows
Cartels wave the ammo, no angle's hollows
Apostles drop thru wood floors
The rope on their neck stop their fall
Victory for all
The ghoul, whorish harlots
Above the stars zips
I pan down to the projects
A murdah in progress, it's heartless
Words bounce off the tongue, unload the cartridge
Monsters, the widow beats on they chest
Weaves those killers from the worlds beyond the flesh
Statue stands naked, a ball in his palm
Over the pawn, the silencers whisper murdah at dawn

It goes murdah murdah, kill kill kill
Suicide notes, lines of coke in the bill
Street life, live like a warrior, grab the steel
But you know that the Gods always build

Posted up attractable niggas
Durable guns like action figures
With threats that's loose on they tongues
Destruction with long strath that hang
Gats in they pants
With a stance like they belong in the frame
Eyes scrolling up the blocks looking for cops
Wild niggas holding their Glocks
Gambling niggas blowing they guap
Smart niggas know when to stop
Rechargeable niggas popping up after some years
Did five in the tier
Strong words he let it hold in the ear
So many menus of holes he been thru
Streets continue
Just some jewels for your mental

[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Amongst the heart that wears coats of larcenies
Arms that squeeze
CAT-Scans a different brands of weed
Gangsters paradise, palms of green
Investigate a murdah weapon
Detective burn his injection
Infected the hood with wide spectrum
No suspects, the rest, just a blood on the dress
Polygraph, analysts took the handprints of death
Lie detectors, scanners in the eye retina
Shootouts with cops fleeing with the cash register
Clouds of letters spell W'A'R'
Bullets shatter the arm
Gunmen lingers, the hood looks like the battle in Nam
Priest look like the Pharaoh turned God

When I see a full moon and they assed out
Get a dutch get a light then grass out
More smoke more fire till I pass out
That's how niggas get finished like popeye's spinach
On a top five list, go cop my shit
Never cop out when the cops out
Do not doubt I got clout, the rapper rappers rap about
C-H-A-R spitting like an A-R
Fifteen my shits mean so get lean
The MVP in pink, no draft pick
Just drastic, get ya ass whipped
Don't gimme no help just gimme ya belt
So when you start feeling ya self, you'd be feeling the welt
Charles hamilton is back, Sha-leik on the track
This beat is so crack, I got jeezy in the back

[Verse 2]

Got niggas holding they head whenever they cypher with me
Get rowdy like I got Roddy Piper with me
Ya bitch ass looking like a diaper, dig me
I might just hit until I strike ya kidney
And what you gonna do (Not a god damn thing)
What ya man gon do (not a god damn thing) (yeah)
Step inside this god damn ring and watch ya ass leave with (not a god damn thing)
I never lost a battle so fuck you rap niggas
All you do is double talk, I don't trust you rap niggas
You rap with no class, so I cut you rap niggas
Give you a pound?, the hell would I touch you rap niggas?
Its me, Cassidy, and Weezy, the new class
You don't see yo name on the list, why you mad?

Im hungry for the game little nigga I- Am

See I was born out in cleveland, raised here in harlem
Money or not, I'm gon' stay here in harlem

I stay clear of problems but it always finds me
SoIsit on ni**as that say charles is grimy

Not just 1 song like that jason fox ni**a

Fuck outside the box, man I'm living through the roof
Living proof my condition ain't got shit to do with u

Hahaha, Shady
We back (Invasion!) Part II
The Conspiracy

[Hook: Eminem & Green Lantern]
'Cause we ain't gonna never stop, you just keep wasting your energy
On us, you should find something to do with your time (time)
And quit fuckin' with us 'cause we ain't fuckin' with you
And it must be fuckin' with you so much you must be gone out your mind
(Shady Records mixtape, come on Em)

[Verse: Eminem]
They say I'm a day away from my entire empire crumbling
Speak up, you're mumbling, what the fuck-a you's a
Bibi-bay okay big-bi-bi-baby, this is Shady
I know you was bi-bi-hoping we be-be-would just go away
But weeble mable weeble wobble but we don't fall down like
Jam Master Jay's two turntables, our label is just too stable
Your magazine's so motherfucking thin you using staples
To hold it together it's turning back into a newspaper
And ya'll got somethin' for my ass every issue
Thank you, 'cause I keep runnin' out of fucking tissues
And I could diss you but God I was sick of looking at you
At least now I can see when Nike's got a new tennis shoe
But-but I guess no good news is always good-good news
Moving on to bigger and better things (chicka chicka jeera)
50's blowing up, this year just keeps going up
What the fuck is going on? Who the fuck is Norah Jones?
Shady, wait a minute, baby, leave the whore alone
Just go up there and be humble and take them awards home
Bush has just declared the world a fucking war zone
Meanwhile we got a war going on of our own at home
My fuckin' mind's blown
Trying to figure out how to fight my own clone
Rhinestones are so nice, they shine so bright
Especially at night
After a hit of ecstasy, ain't that right Ro'oh?
Wait a minute, I'm rambling
Back to the matter at hand, it's Green Lantern
With Elvis Presley the selfish MC
Back to ruin rap and destroy the industry
Single handedly and oh man did we
Yeah me and 50, Obie, me and Twizzy
And Nelly and Missy and Jigga
God damn, it's all a plan devised by the Man, it's a conspiracy
Against fake shit, and anybody who can't make hits or ain't dope lyrically
So fuck what you heard and what you read about
We ain't ruining rap baby we're just trying to weed it out
Shady in the place to be see
And I got what it takes to rock the mic, right!
Still keep talking shit to me punk
'Cause your magazine's over in less than six months!
[Outro: Eminem]
Haha, Shady Records, still Aftermath!
And don't think we can hear you motherfuckers talking
'Cause we can't
We don't hear y'all
So we just gonna sit back for the rest of our lives
While you ride our dicks"
That Girl,Pharrell Williams,['hip hop'],"[Intro: Pharrell & Snoop Dogg]
We do this in our sleep, nigga
Yeah
Ever been in love before?
I wanna holla at you, ma
You know it's hard for a player to admit that sometimes
But I'ma spit that sometimes, y'know what I'm sayin?
Ayy, P, give it to me one time nephew

[Chorus: Pharrell & Snoop Dogg]
There's something 'bout this girl man, from around my way
She from around the way
Ever try to hold back your feelings, but it just wouldn't stay
It wouldn't stay, wouldn't stay
But when I finally found the words to say
I wanted to run away (Run away, run away), simply run away, oh
You can try to run and hide, it won't make a difference
You can lie to yourself, let me reason
Sure it hurts when it comes to your attention
That you're in love with the girl
[Verse 1: Pharrell]
Yes sir, that's her
But it wasn't like that back when I met her
The lavish life from all the dough spun
Before the double R had to hitchhike thumb
Her friends didn't like niggas like us
But I arrested the coochie and her feelings got cuffed
Spider web sex must have got caught up
But there's more to it I remember once
Sayin' ""Let's shit on the peons
Let's go to Vegas and watch Celine Dion""
Make 'em say ""What we on?""
You say no like you was doin' it for eons
Fuck it I just hum and let the watch give off the neons
When it rains it pours, I laugh to myself when I change the score
You said my sex was a lot but my brain gave you more
And somethin' 'bout how your ex was a toy, I guess he played games
It's only diamond dice here not tryin' to justify
But when you shut your eye you can touch the sky
You in trouble ma, and you should pray about speed
But if that's 'bout you, what that say about me?

[Chorus: Pharrell & Snoop Dogg]
What you say, say, say?
But when I finally found the words to say
I wanted to run away (Run away, run away), simply run away, oh
Check it out, check it out
You can try to run and hide, it won't make a difference
You can lie to yourself, let me reason
Sure it hurts when it comes to your attention
That you're in love with the girl
[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
See I'm a crip in dark blue Chucks
And I does what I does yeah I might say ""cuz""
It's really weird cause a nigga got love
Snoop Dogg's a crip and the girl was a blood
She told me that her baby daddy was a thug
Now it is what it is and it was not was
I'm hollerin' at lil mama like what
Monday morn stack tryna get my cheese back
All these memories breed seed to the rhythm rhyme pleaser
Lay back while we sippin' on a breezer
Fresh four pack sittin' in the freezer
Ain't that Kadija I heard she was a skeezer
She used to hit them licks wit' the visas
When I seen her wit the homies I was like ""Jesus""
It's been a little minute since I seen her
Hope her man don't run up cause I'll have to pull the nina

[Chorus: Pharrell]
There's something 'bout this girl man, from around my way
Ever try to hold back your feelings, but it just wouldn't stay
But when I finally found the words to say
I wanted to run away, simply run away
You can try to run and hide, it won't make a difference
You can lie to yourself, or try to reason
Sure it hurts when it comes to your attention
That you're in love with the girl
[Outro: Pharrell]
There's somethin' 'bout this girl man
There's somethin' 'bout this girl man
There's somethin' 'bout this girl man
There's somethin' 'bout this girl man"

Patience, understanding, loyalty, loyalty
Bayani, loyalty (got to have)

[Verse 1]
It's more than just a hobby or pastime
Cause 24/7 I'm representin' the Massline
Daily grind, 85, wonder why, maybe I'm
Way behind lately been occupyin' my mind
With the possibility this means we'll all end
With two albums and a handful of people I call friends
And friends I call my comrades, and comrades who stand
Together write a book 'till it ends
Indeed as we be headed in directions getting whole towns polarized
Either love it or leave it, indeed I'm giving credit to the fam who believed it
Preceding the hype of the hyperbole of the media
Even though some people abandon ship on the other hand
Some were skeptical quick, but now they quick to bandwagon up
Saggin' my pants at the cocktail party with the mayor
And later rockin' a party with a thousand in the air
That's a beautiful thing, and if you're new to this thing
Don't front, ask a question, stay humble, do your thing
But just remember you ain't gotta prove a thing
Stand up or fall down thanks for listenin' y'all
[Chorus]
Because I, got your back even if you don't got mine
Grind in the dark when the clock strikes hard times
We ain't nothing if this bond ain't solidified
Give thanks in war time that people still alive
Dignified soldiers who walk with the spirit of 12 million plus lost and found in this lyric
Sound man turn it till the whole town hear it
Either stand up or fall down now if you feel it
Stand up or fall down
Stand up or fall down
While the record goes round stand up or fall down
Stand up or fall down
Stand up or fall down
While the record goes round let the whole town know that it's us

[Verse 2]
Somebody tell me where the riders and the soldiers are
Before they close the door and go and start a colder war
I see 'em posted up in corner stores holdin' fort
Hopin' for a life from the crack of an open door
And so the storm comes to cleanse without warn
While the youth play with fire just to keep themselves warm
In a cold world, cold people, playin' cold songs
Sold for spare change while the broke hold on
Why they call themselves right, but then act so wrong
Dollar sign challenge why the unemployment line long
No call for the blue collar gettin' low ball
It's a long climb just to get to petty bourgeois
While we, gettin' lifted but forgettin' that we fall
Hit and shake cause your movin' but without the roll call
This is protracted struggle revolutionized patience
Bump this on your right wing radio station
And maybe crack a top 10 daily rotation but until then
You can keep ignorin' what I'm sayin'
But just remember you ain't gotta prove a thing
Stand up or fall down thanks for listenin' y'all
[Chorus]
Because I, got your back even if you don't got mine
Grind in the dark when the clock strikes hard times
We ain't nothing if this bond ain't solidified
Give thanks in war time that people still alive
Dignified soldiers who walk with the spirit of 12 million plus lost and found in this lyric
Sound man turn it till the whole town hear it
Either stand up or fall down now if you feel it
Stand up or fall down

Uhh, check it out, uhh
I steps in, where the Mo's and the hoes at, baby?
Fuck all that pretty shit

Niggas know who the Don is
Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one
Peep game, uhh, what, what, what

Out of this world like Mars when I spit these bars
Come fuck with these stars up in luxury cars (Yeah)
We built in radars to stay free from the cops
Crucial choices to make, like, A-C or the drop? (Haha)
Are we gonna stop? Shit, man, if my squad go broke
Your squad oughta choke, watch your circle vanish like cigar smoke
Ain't no joke, when your ones don't show
Nigga, I know, might say ""Been There, Done That"" like Dre (Uh-huh)
Through hard work, I earn the vault
Promise God to never look back, or I turn to salt (Yeah)
Got nice watches, nice cars, nice bitches, and rings (C'mon)
Guess it's safe to say a nigga like me got nice things (That's right)
Can't relate to motherfuckers who ain't go no cake (Uh-uh)
When you all fucked up and can't get no break (Uh-huh)
When your fake-ass friends don't help you out when you need it
Be on some real bullshit, politely tell you to beat it (Ugh)
Fuck that, get your own, nigga, don't ask me for shit
That's what I did, now they all asking for hits (Yeah)
Nigga, it's on for the simple fact I let it be known
We still fly, but separately, 'cause now I charter my own (C'mon)

They can't touch us, why niggas bring the ruckus?

Yeah, make you a deal, check
These here's the dog years and motherfuckers don't shed
I try to bring you life, but motherfuckers want dead
So I travel with the barrel, with the chrome, with the lead
'Cause when it's on, then it's on, the shots flown through your head
I been rich, I been poor, I saved and blown bread
Some say I been here before because of the way I zone
Some said Jigga's zone's like the falling of Rome
Reoccurring, that he thinks like that 'cause he's observant
Won't be known until I'm gone and niggas study my bones
Mentally, been many places, but I'm Brooklyn's own
In the physical, unseen like Allah's body
In fact, my thoughts don't differ much from that of God Body
But it's the R-shottie that got cats likening me to the mob John Gotti
Rap dudes biting me 'cause I got it locked like the late Bob Marley
Pardon me, y'all, the great Bob Marley
Solemnly, we mourn all the rappers that's gone
Niggas that got killed in the field and all the babies born
Know they ain't fully prepared for this New World Order
So I keep it ghetto like sunflower seeds and quarter waters
You walk 'em through it, you know, talk 'em through it
Know these beats is more than music whenever I talk to it
Destined for greatness, and y'all knew this when I doubled the pie
Had a shorty in a girdle coming out of B-W-I (In school)
I hated algebra, but I loved to multiply
And I told my nigga Big I'd be multi before I die
And it's gon' happen, whether rapping or clapping, have it your way
'Cause if that's my dough you're trapping, I'm clapping your way
It's for the ghetto...

Flipped two keys in two weeks and didn't flaunt it (Uh-huh)
My brain is haunted, with mean dreams

To get richer than Richie quickly, niggas wanna hit me
If they get me, dress my body in linen by Armani, check it

High-caliber gats is all I fuck with, now peep the rough shit
In my circumference, mad bitches with mad Lucci
Bulletproof vestses under they Coogis
Spittin' my Uzi, don't lose me, my trigger niggas represent
Driving dirty in J-30's gettin' bent (Uh-huh)
And to my hit hoes, my murder mamis
I be smokin' trees in Belize when they find me
While you still killin' niggas with punani, like heiny
And Cyrus up in Cypress
Fuck you raw, you on the floor with the virus
While I just slang coke, smoke pounds of choke (Uh-huh)
Got lawyers watching lawyers so I won't go broke, now check it
Them country niggas call me Frank White
I'm squirtin' off up in my loft, of course, I know my shit's tight
Sunrise, open my eyes, no surprise
Got my shorty flyin' in with keys taped to her thighs
With all the utensils, who hang my china thing
She half-Black, half-oriental, eighty-six, she got me rental
The situation ain't accidental

And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
This why I spit it in my songs so sweet like a photo of your granny's picture
Now that you're gone, it hit us
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yo you heard the track I did man, ""This Can't Be Life""
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it why the guard had to look all through it?
As kids, we used to laugh, who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?

Ways to make it rotten, well-planned hits until you're long forgotten

'Cause on the low half of these rappin' ass niggas wanna work for me
Now picture me standin' on somebody block tryin' to rock
I drop bombs and niggas see me with that dough by eight o'clock
My feet never touch the concrete, just street sweep awards
While you're starin' on my dick nigga, gimme yours
I don't hassle with capsules, cause that'll make the grass grow
And get a project nigga paid up the asshole
If I'ma risk a frisk, gettin' my wrists wrapped up in steel

Under some vagina, discussin' the finer, things
My crib is mean, watchin' a hundred inch screen
Lettin' the shorties slide by once in a while and let 'em dream
They think I've mastered the game, cause dames scream my name
With passion, I tell 'em stop flashin' and start stashin'
And we'll all get off the corner, the only heat you'll feel
Is from a sauna, lettin' bubbles shoot up your ass if you wanna
And fuck that weed, it keeps you broke, invest in
Pounds of herbs and profit if niggas wanna smoke dope
But keep your nuts, 'cause this is a man's game

Unfold a pack of bills, grab my balls then bet it all

I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider

[Verse 1]
They putting pressure on me, son, now they want me to snap
End up like X and Whitney in my mansion smoking crack
I'm paranoid, I'm feeling like niggas is trying to get me
Forget the kids, I'm shaving off my fucking head like Britney
Man, Dre won't mix my records, now I need to talk to Jimmy
I'm falling back in my old ways, I'm riding with the semi
Who's calling me? It's Chris, he's on the other line with Diddy
But I don't wanna talk right now, my day is going shitty
Why's Jay rocking that Urkel look, man, isn't he from Marcy?
They say he's growin dreads and now he's talking like a Yardie
Man, everything is changing, I don't understand a thing
I guess this is that bullshit that all the money brings
I'm on flight

[Verse 2]
My baby mama boyfriend like to talk like he can hurt me
I'm laughing cause she kissed him in his mouth and gave him herpes
That just makes him one of 50 niggas wanting to murk me
Niggas found my truck and burnt it up out there in Jersey
You can ask my son, he'll tell you ""my dad's fucking crazy""
She filled his head with shit and now I think he fuckin' hates me
Shady didn't invent me but a star is what he made me
I'll blow your fuckin' mind out if I told you what he paid me
He gave me all the pills he had left, that's why I'm so high
It makes me feel so good now that I'm not so scared to die
I wish a nigga would, I dare a motherfucker try
You get at me and miss you kiss your black ass good-bye

I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
[Verse 3]
My lawyers on retainers every month, I give ‘em stacks
In case they wanna send me up for murder like Max
Man I wasn't the shooter, I was never on the scene
So if they do forensics they'll find out it wasn't me
There's no need for a lie detector, I ain't sayin shit
The more you talk the higher chances you're doing a bid
Today I read the paper, it said Tru Life caught a case
They said they found a victim with a knife stuck in his face
I spoke to Michael Vick, I told him I'm happy he home
You tell them crackers sorry nigga then you get back on
When dogs are fighting in the hood nobody gives a fuck
So you get back and shake it on the field, show them what's up
I'm on flight

His clothes are loud, but never square
It will make or break him so he's got to buy the best
'Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion

And when he does his little rounds
'Round the boutiques of London Town
Eagerly pursuing all the latest fads and trends
'Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion

Oh yes he is (Oh yes he is)

He thinks he is a flower to be looked at
And when he pulls his frilly nylon panties right up tight
He feels a dedicated follower of fashion

Oh yes he is (Oh yes he is)

There's one thing that he loves, and that is flattery
One week he's in polka dots, the next week he's in stripe
'Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion
They seek him here, they seek him there
In Regent Street and Leicester Square
Everywhere the Carnabetian army marches on
Each one a dedicated follower of fashion

Oh yes he is (Oh yes he is)

His world is built 'round discotheques and parties
This pleasure-seeking individual always looks his best

Uh Dipset! 'Fore I set it off
Okay first off, you a bitch nigga
Only reason I'm doin' this
I'ma just name five reasons real quick, got 150, got 150
First, you stole Roc-A-Fella from Dame
Second, you stole Kanye from Dame
Third, you stole Rocawear from Dame
Fourth, I seen the nigga throw that diamond up before them shots was fired
Fifth, hold on, turn the beat off
I had to turn the beat off for this
You talkin' 'bout you a '80s baby, you 37 years old
You was born in 1968 and I open the Daily News
How's the king of New York rockin' sandals with jeans?
Open toe sandals with chancletas with jeans on
How's the king of New York rockin' sandals with jeans and he 42 years old?
Back to business

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
You ain't the only one with big wallets
Got it, my shits brollic, dot it
But your publishing should go to Ms. Wallace
Honest, stealing Big's shit, he made two albums, you wilding
And he can't dress, dawg, who styled him?
It was Rocawear when Dame had it
Now you got it, call it Cockawear, heh not in here
Dead it pronto, you won't see a car, no
Dame and Biggs' bitch for years, now you Juan ho
He own the 40/40, got you in Atlantic City
Pitch your budget outta Baseline, goddamn it's pretty
You love a Harlem nigga, we get it cooking it's true
But now I look, we got more dudes in Brooklyn than you
Apparently, right? Down in Jeezy video
I should've kissed you on the cheek, you a pretty ho
And Jaz video you starred in it: Peter Pan
I was hopping off the Greyhound: Peter Pan
How could he be the man? Ha, only reason fam
I don't suck dick or kiss ass and I'm conceited, damn
But we hawk yo, right where you walk bro
You can fool the rest of the world long as New York know
We put you under ground clown, they gon' check the cellars
I know he 40 years old, I don't respect my elders
I respect the hustlers, plus the grinders and the sellers
You's a customer buster, here go jet propellers
[Chorus: Max B]
You got to hate us the way we getting this paper
All my niggas are coming straight from minimum wage
Niggas dick-riding the Dip steady trying to play us
But you get sprayed, bust a round we got in his face
Dipset! Hitting 40 and niggas we toting guns
Dipset! This is 40th nigga we from the slums
Dipset! Pushing 40 nigga you not the one

Who can fuck with me? No mammal, but we tote handles
At your open toe sandals, and you look like Joe Camel
Off of Roc-A-Fella, right? No contact
But bust this fly joint they put inside his contract
I left the label right, lot of cats wonder how
Every time I diss that label I get fined a hundred thou'
Just for telling y'all, I get fined a hundred thou'
Huh them cats are ill, five times a half a mil'
Wars to play, like a bumper sticker smack a grill
Paul Wall cap a grill but them cats are daffodils
East Coast, West Coast, slang yo cap get peeled
Down in Houston, ask B I'm a mack for real
Hackie tell me, respect, better dwell me
Beyoncé fiancé, check my second LP
I might bring it back, that's your girl, that's your world
Had the thing, fucking singing 'bout slinging crack
Mr. Roc-A-Fella stop, stop, stop it fella
Still got our acapellas, but I will Akinyele-ya
(Put it in ya mouth, uh, put it in ya mouth)
It ain't my fault I'm raw, I'm sorry B but I want a war
And he stabbed Un over Charli Baltimore
Sucker for love, hmm-hmm sucker for love
Kill a bitch, go to trial, hand be stuffed in the glove
I'ma hop in the bed, dawg gon' just pop off her head
Tell ol' Jay-Z chill, Cochran is dead

You on some Saddam Hussein
Acting like you got something over there
You doing what Ma$e did, you making secret songs man
Let it out man, get ready for 15 rounds man
And all I did was battle once
Everybody getting ready to step to the plate
And I'ma step up again and slam, grand-slam yo ass pardon me
Dipset! I know you, I know you like that
I remember Dame sold you his old Pathfinder
Chipped in for the GS, you Jaz-O's son
Where's Sauce Money at? Where's the like, where they at?
I'ma get back to all that, Dipset dog
Round one, let the games begin doggie
Hahaha, ain't laughing at ya ugly ass no more
You ugly dawg! You ugly! You ugly man, you ugly!

You ol' Alf-ass nigga, get back to you nigga

[Verse 1]
I'm from the streets where the hood could swallow 'em and
Bullets'd follow 'em and
There's so much coke that you could run the slalom
And cops comb the shit top to bottom
And say that we are prone to violence, but it's home sweet home
Where personalities clash and chrome meets chrome
The coke prices up and down like it's Wall Street, holmes
But this is worse than the Dow Jones, your brains are now blown
All over that brown Brougham, one slip, you are now gone
Welcome to Hell, where you are welcome to sell
But when them shells come, you better return 'em
All scars, we earn 'em
All cars, we learn 'em like the back of our hand
We watch for cops hoppin' out the back of vans
Wear a G on my chest, I don't need Dapper Dan

Was clappin' them flamers before I became famous
For playin' me, y'all shall forever remain nameless

Nine to be exact, from grindin' G-packs
Put this shit in motion, ain't no rewindin' me back
Could make forty off a brick, but one rhyme could beat that
And if somebody woulda told 'em that Hov would sell clothin'
Not in this lifetime, wasn't in my right mind
That's another difference that's between me and them
I smarten up, open the market up
One million, two million, three million, four
In eighteen months, eighty million more
Now add that number up with the one I said before

Tale of two cities
Right here

It's time we set it straight, connect wit' Dre the correct way
Predictin' platinum in less than a day
So for that we toast, amongst us while y'all lackin' hope
All I do is write raps, stack, relax and smoke
Seein' my dreams come true, stayin' humble in the eyes of others
Politickin' wit' the wisest brothers
It's Nature, one of the greatest, peep how I play this
Straight from the 'Bridge, one of your kids' favorites
From now 'til the day that I'm stiff
Foul flagrant, pay the rent, always stay swift
Stuck in my ways, type chauvinistic
Since a youth, I had a thing for big Coups
Flooded rings and older bitches
Holdin' my riches in lump sums for trust funds
Fully recovered thugs lust to bust guns
While niggas get drunk, beat wives and cuss sons
A slow process called life, let's show progress
[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Don Cortes, white rags, cherry Bentley
Cop shines from Italy, speak money language fluently
Never fuck wit' the nastiest, flashiest
Bought a house big as Scarface to show my happiness
Rackin' the 6-0's, for those that want to get personal to home
Cock the heavy metal, rollin' with my stones
Prominent with flashy garments, spend a mill'
Small bills bring a smile to a ice grill
Popular, loved throughout the industry
If they sue, light a Phillie 'cause the judge has gotta Free Willy
Salute with chilled Remy
Gently escort four ladies a arm, The Four Seasons at the club
Bentleys, condo suites, I'm fancy
20 floors up, overlookin' ladies, boomerang they panties
Bump The Firm Family's latest, takin' trips to Las Dregas
That's how we do at Aftermath Incorporated

I spit rhymes for the radio and spit for tours
Spend doe that I never thought I'd hold before
Now, if you just wanna front, you know my style's tight
Niggas never should've plugged up the motherfuckin' mic
Sippin' Tanqueray, 60-inch screen when we hang wit' Dre
Just flew in from Queens, no bag and plan to stay
In the heat, park the Rolls Royce on Venice Beach
Seein' topless bitches rollerbladin' in the street
[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
While I lounge in a Jacuzz', sky clear blue, got the whole crew
Nas, AZ, Nature, Foxy there too
How we do? Hit trees, Cristal bottles

Don't know what I'm runnin' from
But I know I need to get away
I don't know where I'm running to
But I hope that I get there soon

[Verse 1: godAWFUL]
The Camry sat crooked, still pumpin 80 at a pace
I let Logic pass a while back, It's like I'm lazy in this race
But maybe it is my fate, wait
Maybe it's the taste, wait
Maybe it's the scent in the air
I'm not coming back!
Gorgeous girl in front of me, gorgeous girl behind me
Let's define irony, neither of them want me
My brain and my cell, at a stage parallel
Half dead, half hopin they will make it to tell
I am here, let's talk, let's exchange all our hell
Let's embrace, let's take it to a place that'll melt
Let's lay, let's display everything that we felt
Let me know that you are gonna break this as well
Third times a charm bracelet, fell from your wrist
But I guess it's better than sayin' it never exist
I play blind, deaf, dumb, while gettin' a grip
But with what you pulled out, I should of been better equipped
Now - everything spins...no headlights for miles
Staring at the empty seat that you left beside me
There is no better timing, I will die or move on
And forgot all about you once I write a few songs
But not now, I'm a man up on a mission
On his breathe you can smell it's a rough transition
See love can't listen, so he hums to deaf ears
Of little miss ""don't give a fuck""-your best years
One working cd, a bunch of dead air
Because the radio is starting to come in less clear
So all that remains, is 'All That Remains'
A ball and a chain, and a call full of thanks
That's when my concentration fell from the pavement
And my fate was in the place on the screen navigating
Twisted metal never had me feeling so complacent

[Verse 2: godAWFUL]
And now my heart feels smaller than the box that I'm sleepin in
Behind a bunch of steel more contorted then the previous
And I'm scared, not by the scene of it
But by the fucked up fact I'm completely at peace with this
I deserved this right, I fucking asked for it
I was the one so eager to fast forward
And all I could think of was my last chorus
And how I should of told you I loved you
But I guess that I never stood a chance
And never could advance, with this half crooked stance
Coming back home wasn't put in the plans
But neither was this bed made of wood & some clamps
I found myself so open in room full of locks
Feelin like a runaway train they couldn't stop
And when I say I'm in a place that I have never been before
Believe me it is so sayin' much more than a metaphor
My shoelaces is gone, I must wreak of desperation
Or they noticed how fragile and easy to break I had become
Maybe they saw how I had to run
Just to keep myself away from being splattered in blood
So here I am counting grains in an hourglass
Tryin' to answer questions I didn't know how to ask
No company kept, no sound to pass
Just a number in my head reminding me thatIwas bound to crash
Now I'm pounding cracks
Livin in the vision of astoundin' grasp
Like how is that? WishIcould of been up in loungin' nap
But out of track
And now I ask, how proud is dad?
In a footstep he left miles back
Like officer lemme dial that
I think I'm ready for my attack
Like get me the fuck up out of her
I'm bound to clear the sound of here
Shouting fear, to a town of near
And I doubt that I'mma put down that beer
But I can dream right, and I can make strides
And I can apologize once I I see that daylight
So put me in front the gun for the son
Cause I'm done with the runnin I'm hummin' to suttin
I'll come up with dumpin' my gut in to lovin'
But fuck it, I'm nothin, I'm huffin and puffin
Like trouble and suffer is tough for the bluff
And I'm bumpin' it up to another production
I put so abundantly stuffed in the cupboard
Above what is pumpin my blood to the public and I
Have never seen eyes that warm
Never felt a heart that cold
And all I can think is I guess should of known

So that's when I hit my reset button"
Respiration,Black Star,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
""What'd you do last night?""
""We did, umm, two whole cars
It was me, Dez, and Mean Three, right?
And on the first car in small letters it said
'All you see is…' and then, you know
Big, big, you know, some block silver letters
That said 'crime in the city', right?""
""It just took up the whole car?""
""Yeah, yeah, it was a whole car and shit...""
Escúchela, la ciudad respirando
Escúchela, la ciudad respirando
Escúchela, la ciudad respirando
Escúchela...

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
The new moon rode high in the crown of the metropolis
Shinin', like ""Who on top of this?""
People was tusslin', arguin' and bustlin'
Gangstas of Gotham hardcore hustlin'
I'm wrestlin' with words and ideas
My ears is pricked, seekin' what will transmit
The scribes can apply the transcript
Yo, this ain't no time where the usual is suitable
Tonight alive, let's describe the inscrutable, the indisputable (What!)
We New York, the narcotics, draped in metal and fiber optics
Where mercenaries is paid to trade hot stock tips for profits
Thirsty criminals sic pockets
Hard knuckles on the second hands of working-class watches
Skyscrapers is colossus, the cost of livin' is preposterous
Stay alive? You pay or die, no options
No Batman and Robin
Can't tell between the cops and the robbers
They both partners, they all heartless, with no conscience
Back streets stay darkened, while unbeliever hearts stay hardened
My eagle talons stay sharpened, like city lights stay throbbin'
You either make your way or stay sobbin'
The shiny Apple is bruised, but sweet
And if you choose to eat, you could lose your teeth
Many crews retreat
Nightly news repeat who got shot down and locked down
Spotlight the savages, NASDAQ averages
My narrative grows to explain this existence
Amidst the harbor lights which remain in the distance
[Chorus: Mos Def, all]
So much on my mind that I can't recline
Blastin' holes in the night 'til she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
Heard the bass ride out like an ancient mating call
I can't take it, y'all! I can feel the city breathin'
Chest heavin', against the flesh of the evenin'
The sigh before we die like the last train leavin'

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Breathin' in deep city breaths, sittin' on shitty steps
We stoop to new lows, Hell froze the night the city slept
The Beast crept through concrete jungles
Communicatin' with one another and ghetto birds
Where waters fall from the hydrants to the gutters
The Beast walk the beats, but the beats we be makin'
You on the wrong side of the track, lookin' visibly shaken
Takin' them plungers
Plungin' to death that's painted by the numbers
With Krylon applied pressure
Cats is playin' God, but havin' children by a lesser baby mother
But fuck it, we played against each other like puppets
Swearin' you got pull
When the only pull you got is the wool over your eyes
Gettin' knowledge in jail like a blessin' in disguise
Look in the skies for God, what you see besides the smog
Is broken dreams flyin' away on the wings of the obscene
Thoughts that people put in the air
Places where you could get murdered over a glare
But everythin' is fair
It's a paradox we call reality
So keepin' it real will make you a casualty of abnormal normality
Killers Born Naturally like Mickey and Mallory
Not knowin' the ways'll get you capped like an NBA salary
Some cats be emceein' to illustrate what we be seein'
Hard to be a spiritual being when shit is shakin' what you believe in
For trees to grow in Brooklyn, seeds need to be planted
I'm askin' if y'all feel me and the crowd left me stranded
My blood pressure boiled and rose
'Cause New York niggas actin' spoiled at shows
To the winners, the spoils go
I take the L, transfer to the 2, head to the gates
New York life type trife, the Roman Empire state
[Chorus: Common, Mos Def, all]
So much on my mind, I just can't recline
Blastin' holes in the night till she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
Yo, don't the bass ride out like an ancient mating call? 
I can't take it, y'all! I can feel the city breathin'
Chest heavin', against the flesh of the evenin'
The sigh before we die like the last train leavin'

[Spanish-speaking woman]
¡Escuchela... Respirando como yo… Ojos sinceros, escondiendo pena y temor… El silencio de mentira, tocando al hogar escapando sentimientos entre ella y yo…

[Verse 3: Common]
Yo, on The Amen, corner I stood lookin' at my former hood
Felt the spirit in the wind, knew my friend was gone for good
Threw dirt on the casket, the hurt, I couldn't mask it
Mixin' down emotions, struggle I hadn't mastered
I choreograph seven steps to Heaven
In Hell, waitin' to exhale and make the bread leaven
Veteran of a cold war; it's Chica-I-go for
What I know or what's known
So some days I take the bus home, just to touch home
From the crib, I spend months gone
Sat by the window with a clutched dome
Listenin' to shorties cuss long
Young girls with weak minds, but they butt strong
Tried to call, or at least beep the Lord but didn't have a touch-tone
It's a dog-eat-dog world, you gotta mush on
Some of this land I must own
Outta the city, they want us gone
Tearin' down the 'jects, creatin' plush homes
My circumstance is between Cabrini and Love Jones
Surrounded by hate, yet I love home
Asked my guy how he thought travelin' the world sound
Found it hard to imagine he hadn't been past Downtown
It's deep, I heard the city breathe in its sleep
Of reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep
Deep, I heard my man breathe in his sleep
Of reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep
[Chorus: Mos Def, Mos Def and Talib Kweli, all]
So much on my mind, I just can't recline
Blastin' holes in the night till she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
Yo, how the bass ride out like an ancient mating call? 
I can't take it, y'all! I can feel the city breathin'
Chest heavin', against the flesh of the evenin'
Kiss the odds goodbye, I'm on the last train leavin'"
Man in the Mirror,Michael Jackson,"['pop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
Gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana
[Verse 2]
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

[Extended Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Man in the mirror, oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Change his ways)
(Come on, change)
And no message could have been any clearer
[Bridge]
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart (You can't)
Then you close your mind (Close your, your mind!)

[Chorus]
(That man, that man) I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(That man)
(Ooh!)
(That man, that man) I'm asking him to change his ways
(That man, the man)
(Change his ways, ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
(Take a look at yourself and then make that)
Change!

[Outro]
Hoo, hoo (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana), hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Gonna feel real good (Oh yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana)
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh no
I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good, shamone (Change)
Just lift yourself, you know
You've got to start with yourself, (Yeah) hoo!
(Make that change) I gotta make that change today, hoo!
(Man in the mirror) You got to, you got to not pick yourself, brother, hoo! (Yeah)
You know (Make that change)
I've gotta get that man, that man (Man in the mirror)
You got to, you got to move, shamone, shamone
You got to stand up (Yeah), stand up (Make that change), stand up, stand up and lift yourself now (Man in the mirror)
Hoo, hoo, hoo! Aaow! (Yeah, make that change)
Go make that change, shamone (Man in the mirror)
You know it, you know it, you know it, you know (Change)

When the fighters are all around
All the lovers are on the ground
No one will save you anymore
So what's happening? what you rapping about, little boy?
Is it cars? Is it girls? Is it money?
The world?

[Verse 1 : Lupe Fiasco]
Or is it something they can never believe?
Or is it something you can never achieve?
Is it beyond your means? Is it inside your dreams?
Can it never come out cause it's scared to, unprepared to
Too worried about the words of the people it's weird to
You don't want them to hear you
You just wish there was a door that would appear
That you can go disappear through
Well I'm feeling your pain
I was feeling the same, but I said I'd never feel that again

When the fighters are all around
All the lovers are on the ground
No one will save you anymore
So what's happening? what you rapping about, little boy?

Man, I really miss my pops
Hope that God watches over him and that he's on top
That there is no more disease and that he's alright
That he's one of the generals inside the army of the light
And grandma, you know I had to bite something from you
So after every show it's ""peace, and much love to you""
Auntie Tweetie's on the way, please look out for that girl
I know we'll meet again, so it's never me against the world

I hope that God forgive us, all of us sinners
Turn us back into beginners, put us up where the winners go
Holy apartments in the gardens in which the rivers flow
Thank you for all your blessings and all of your miracles
I thank all my fans and all my supporters
Shout out to Bishop G, congrats on your new baby daughter
I tip my hat to all my family and friends
Now we just got one more to go, L-U-P-END

Yo I roll up to the mill with my flannel on
And from the lawn I can see that the party’s on
I see chips and dips (they got cheese’s right?)
Hell yea, Vermont Chedder, it’s purple Jesus night
I see my boys in the back, DJ spinnin the track
Hes with some bitches talkin smack that the tavern was whack
It’s the mill yo, and that’s what I told ya
’cause here we all G’s throwin free granola
I’m checkin out the honeys and I spy me a winner
She got Carhartt overalls, stained with dinner
I weave through the crowd man I wish I were drunker
But Pub Safe rolls in, so I hit up the bunker

[Hook]
I’m a Midd Kid, I swing my nalgene low
Go Green on the side, sippin H20
I’m a Midd Kid, I roll my jeans up high
With my Teva strap tight and my flannel so fly

[Verse 2]
I’m a Midd Kid yo and I’m livin’ it up
But I got too much work so I’m “Lib”in it up
Don’t get me wrong man I do what I please
Feelin’ great cause I am and I gotta succeed
Lookin at my macbook, scopin the scene
I’m catchin eyes from this cute little library queen
I’m gettin up yo, but I gotta be patient
Just wait till I see her at the printing station
When I work I wear my sunday best
Tight ripped jeans and corduroy vest
Napsack with some 3 by 5′s
I stack books the pound, work a day at a time
Cause I’m a Midd Kid, gonna ace the test
And there’s no time to rest, no time to stress
I best hit up McCullough when it’s over and done
Grab a fresh Odwalla cause I’m on the run
I’m a Midd Kid
[Hook]

Verse 3
I’m flyin on the pitch as I catch the snitch
And if you dont play Quidditch, then you’re a bitch
Yo I rock 22′s on my Nimbus 3000
And fresh new shoes when I’m hikin a mountain
Keepers by the hoops, fliers in step
Got my shorts real high, show my Hufflepuff rep
I got you by a step misjudgin my pass
Look me in the eye and I’ll bludgeon your ass
I score 300 points to your 76
Spitting fresh game at the Quidditch chicks (heey)
So don’t cross me bitch, I’ll just chuckle as you struggle
Cause I’m a Midd Kid, and you’re just a fucking muggle (censored)

[Bridge]
This one’s for the girls, and Midd Kids all over the world
Swinging your nalgene low (h20)
Now look at that bro, check out his flow
Shawty…

-Key change- (Lax Bro chorus)
Cause I’m a lax bro, eh yo I flow in my Polo
With Natty from a Solo yo, no homo
I’m a lax bro, I shred threads on the reg
All the ho’s should beg, so bitch pump my keg
Cause’ I’m a lax bro
[Verse 4]
I’m a lax bro yo North Face Denali
Rockin Rainbow Sands, wearin Abercrombie
I got 38 visors, a Brine Lacrosse net
Matchin popped collars in my walk in closet
I give my girl gift cards from Tiffany
I got bitches on the horn like I’m runnin a symphony
Watchu know about a female (You’re sperry’s are retail)
I get in box like gmail…
RL, Brooks Dave Matthews tee’s
Mickey D’s double cheese man I’m smashin these
My polo shirt I untuck it, playin ruit I reign buckets
If I ain’t rippin twine I’m sailin to Nantucket

Cause he’s a lax bro and I’m a laxitute
And I dont really care if he’s about to booze
He’s got a Top Gun pinney and he’ll pass with that
Oh my god look at his backwards hat

[Verse 1: The Game & (Sample)]
I woke up out that coma 2001
'Bout the same time Dre dropped 2001
Three years later the album is done
Aftermath presents: Nigga Witta Attitude, Volume One
Rap critics politickin', wanna know the outcome
Ready to Die, Reasonable Doubt, and Doggystyle in one
I feel like 'Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind that G series and All Eyez on Me
I watched the death of a dynasty, so I told Vibe Magazine
Workin' with Dr. Dre was a (""Dream"")
I had visions of makin' a classic, then my world turned black
Like I was starin' out of Stevie Wonder's glasses
It's kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West
Coming back from his fatal accident to beatmakin' and rappin'
But, we the future, Whitney Houston told me that
It's gon' take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back
[Chorus: The Game & (Sample)]
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
'Cause Martin Luther King had a (""Dream"")

So I reached out to Kanye and (""I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you"")
(""I—love you""

""I-I-I love you"")

[Verse 2: The Game]
I had dreams of fuckin' a R&B bitch like Mýa
When I saw that ass on the front of that King
Read the article in the magazine, she loved gangsters, loved nasty things
So I'm in the glass house having nasty dreams
Good girls never give it up
But anything is possible, if 50 fucked Vivica
Hurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream of being Unsigned Hype
'Til I was crushed by Dave Mays, almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
Daydreamin' yesterday, dozin' off backstage
I thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over, heard Jam Master say
""It's a hard knock life, then you pass away""
They say sleep is the cousin of death, so my eyes wide open
'Cause a dream is kin to your last breath

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
'Cause Martin Luther King had a (""Dream"")
Aaliyah had a (""Dream""), Left Eye had a (""Dream"")

[Verse 3: The Game]
The dream of Huey Newton, that's what I'm livin' through
The dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin' you
Who walked through the White House without a business suit
Compton hat, jheri curl drippin' on Ronald Reagan's shoes
Gave Mike Lem my demo, came here to pay my dues
Started off with Whoo Kid, then I start blazin' Clue
It was all a dream like Big said it'd be
Don't sleep on me homey, I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon, defyin' the rules of gravity
Studied all the classics, start revisin' my strategy
'Cause Marshall Mathers made it, Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds, wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gaye went
How do I say this? I'm livin' for my son
But I can't figure out, why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece, like a Catholic nun
The war to be a rap legend has just begun
[Chorus: The Game & (Sample)]
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (""Dream"")
Aaliyah had a (""Dream""), Left Eye had a (""Dream"")

Drip drop, the angels made a pit stop
Pissin' on the demons of the Earth
What’s it really worth? Shit, now it's fuckin' pourin'
Wanted to go skate, can't, now my day is borin', damn
Snorin' in the bed with blankets cause my head spin
Probably cause I popped a couple purple Excedrins
It's a rainy day, so I'll skip the Led Zeppelin
And play some Sade ""Love Deluxe"" through my headset
On my way home I punched a bitch for an umbrella
Why? Cause I really didn’t wanna get my shit wet
Run through the puddles, playin' in the mud
Fun, sucks that I'm too tall for the tub
Or I would get my toys and make a lotta noise
While my mom is in the kitchen cookin' up a meal
Fire place is startin' up, dick is barely warmin' up
Sippy cup full of whip creamed hot chocolate

I can smell it when I go outside
Then it just pours
It gives us peace then all in the town is quiet
That's what rain's for

All the kids see rain and scream ""No, no""
Run off the bus and they will just stay in
Me I love how rain fills the potholes
Me and my sailboat, that's what we played in
Ever wonder exactly where the sun goes
Did it go or did somethin' shade it?
The sun gives light cause it is the window
The rain gives life cause it is amazin'

Lightning is striking, water hittin' on my window like Ike
I am not Tina, buddy, do not give my window pain
Lights bulbs when wearin' that wig, flyin' kites
Here's an idea, why don't I go hiking
On a fuckin' mountain where the water fountains icing
Stand there in a tank top prop that's from Baywatch
And eat about four bowls of some frozen ice cream
Get sick and then I won't have to
Go to school today, tomorrow, the day after
Sit in bed, write a bunch of raps up
And I won't be lyin' when I say I’m a sick rapper
I might fail so I won't bother
The sun is playin' hide and seek like my fuckin' father
The only difference is it comes back, full effect
In the summer heats up, the thermometers erected

Proves there's life"

Young money I’m richer than I used to be
I plant my seed in her garden now she root for me
Baby I’ma tell you truthfully:
I talk it and I do believe I walk it
Call me orthopedic Carter and I ought to be an author
Damn, man and I tell ya, it’d be a best seller
Tim on the beat and me Missy Elliot goes wherever
Ya dig?
You can ask the bank teller
But my money old like Nelson Mandela
Higher than a propeller
And baby I can show you better than acapella

Beach Chair,JAY-Z,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues']","[Verse 1; Jay-Z & Beyonce]
Geah, yeah
Life is but a dream to me, I don't wanna wake up
Thirty odd years without having my cake up
So I'm about my paper 24/7, 365, 366 in a leap year
I don't know why we here
Since we gotta be here life is but a beach ch-ch-ch-chair
Went from having shabby clothes, crossing over Abbey Road
Hear my angels singing to me (Are you happy, Hov?)
I just hope I'm hearing right; karma's got me fearing life
Colleek, are you praying for me?
See I got demons in my past, so I got daughters on the way
If the prophecy's correct, then the child should have to pay
For the sins of a father, so I barter my tomorrows
Against my yesterdays in hopes that she'll be okay
And when I'm no longer here to shade her face from the glare
I'll give her my share of Carol's Daughter and a new beach chair

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear my angels sing...
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Life is but a dream to me
Gun shots sing to these other guys
But lullabies don't mean a thing to me
I'm not afraid of dying, I'm afraid of not trying
Every day, hit every wave like I'm Hawaiian
I don't surf the net, no, I never been on MySpace
Too busy letting my voice vibrate
Carving out my space in this world of fly girls
Cut-throats and diamond-cut ropes I twirls
Benzes 'round corners where the sun don't shine
I let the wheels give a glimpse of hope of one's grind
Son said: ""Hov, how you get so fly?""
I said: ""From not being afraid to fall out the sky""
My physical's a shell, so when I say farewell
My soul will find a even higher plane to dwell
So fly, you shall, so have no fear
Just know that life is but a beach chair

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Jay-Z]
I hear my angels sing...
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream
[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Life is but a dream
Can't mimic my life, I'm the thinnest cut slice
Intercut, the winner's cup
With winters rough enough to interrupt life
That's why I'm both saint and sinner, nice
This is Jay everyday, no compromise
No compass comes with this life, just eyes
So to map it out, you must look inside
Sure, books could guide you, but your heart defines you, chica
Your corazón is what brought us home
In great shape like Heidi Klum, maricón
I am on permanent vacay, life is but a beach chair
This song's like a Hallmark card until you reach here
So 'til she's here, and she's declared
The heir, I will prepare
A blueprint for you to print, a map for you to get back
A guide for your eyes; and so you won't lose scent
I'll make a stink for you to think I ink these verses full of prose
So you won't get conned out of two cent
My last will and testament: I leave my heir
My share of Roc-A-Fella Records and a shiny new beach chair

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Jay-Z]
I hear my angels sing...
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream

History,JAY-Z,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus]
Now that all the smoke is gone (lighter)
And the battle's finally won (give me a lighter)
Victory’s finally ours (Lighters up, lighters up)
History so loved, so long, so long, so long

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
In search of victory, she keeps eluding me
If only we could be together momentarily
We could make love, and make history
Why won’t you visit me, until she visits me
I’ll be stuck with her sister, her name is defeat
She gives me agony, so much agony
She brings me so much pain, so much misery
Like missing your last shot and falling to your knees
As the crowd screams, for the other team
I've practiced so hard for this moment victory don’t leave
I know what this means, I’m stuck in this routine
Whole new different day, but the same old things
All I got is dreams, but nobody else could see
Nobody else believes, nobody else but me
Where are you victory? I need you desperately
Not just for the moment, to make history
[Chorus]
Now that all the smoke is gone (lighter)
And the battle's finally won (give me a lighter)
Victory’s finally ours (Lighters up, lighters up)
History so loved, so long, so long, so long

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
So now I’m flirting with death
Hustling like a G, while victory wasn’t watching
Took chances repeatedly
As a teenage boy, before acne
Before I got proactive, I couldn’t face she
I just threw on my hoodie and headed to the streets
I swear I met success, we lived together shortly
A success is like lust, she's good for the touch
She's good for the moment, but she’s never enough
Everybody’s had her, she’s nothing like V
A success is all I got, unfortunately
But I’m burning down the block, hopin' in and out of V's
But something tells me that there’s much more to see
Before I get killed, cause I can’t get robbed
So before me, success and death ménage
I gotta get lost, I gotta find V
We gotta be together to make history

[Chorus]
Now that all the smoke is gone (lighter)
And the battle's finally won (give me a lighter)
Victory’s finally ours (Lighters up, lighters up)
History so loved, so long, so long, so long
[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Now victory is mine, she tastes so sweet
She’s my trophy wife, she's coming with me
We'll have a baby who stutters repeatedly
We'll name him history, he'll repeat after me
He’s my legacy, son of my hard work
Future of my past, he’ll explain who I be
Rank me amongst the greats, either 1, 2 or 3
If I ain’t number one then I failed you victory
Ain’t in it for the fame, that dies within weeks
Ain’t in it for the money, can’t take it when you leave
I wanna be remembered long after you grieve
Long after I’m gone, long after I breathe
I leave all I am, in the hands of history
That's my last will testimony
This is much more than a song, it’s a baby shower
I’ve been waiting for this hour, history, you're ours"

They thought it was cool to tear down the projects and put up million dollar condos, gentrification
They think it's cool to stand on the block hiding product in their socks to make quick dime bag dollars
They think it's cool to ride down on you in blue and white unmarked cars busting you upside your head

Farewell Summer,Joell Ortiz,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","[Intro]
Yaowa. A lot been going on these past three months. If you don't mind, I'd like to share it with you

[Verse]
Let's see. Summer of Oh Ten
Right before it kicked off I lost a really close friend
Last time we kicked it was at a show in Coney Island
Fucked with some bitches, I swear I miss my homie whylin'
That was bad enough news, like I needed to hear more
Mr. Marshall Mathers is interested in us four
""Us four"" being Crooked I, Joe Budden
Royce and myself, but I swear it's always somethin'
When talks got real, E-1 started frontin'
Tryna cock block, but we handled that, it's nothin.'
Listen close, hear it from the horse's mouth, It's crazy
The deal ain't finalized, but yeah, Slaughterhouse and Shady
Show's been getting better, Highline was retarded
When Fat Joe came out, New York City went bonkers
Styles P came out and held it down for all of Yonkers
Even Sean Paul ripped it after twistin up the ganja
Closed the show with Jim Jones,you know, Nissan, Honda
Chevy. Had the fans Andretti, that's a monster
Wish I coulda spit that on the stage at Summer Jam
Can't complain though, that verse helped me scoop a couple grand
Aside from the music, copped a new apartment
Two bedroom joint, nothing fancy, a little carpet
Marble in the kitchen, cool walk-in closet
A painting here and there, something simple for an artist
If you havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
Well then feel sorry for me, cause I had more than one
Like E-1 and Slaughterhouse single, I lost the one
Before the us and Pharoahe Monch Canada tour was done
I argued with her like, ""Being insecure is dumb
The only thing that I could get from all these whores is cum.""
We did the Skype thing in my bunk on late nights
Always started cool but ended in the same fight
Why I ain't picking up the phone once again
It only takes a second to reply to BBM
Baby, I don't know what to say
Maybe it was the 20 hour drive from Montreal to Thunder Bay
Maybe my phone died, maybe I'm sound checkin'
Maybe I'm on stage going in for the crowd, sweatin'
Either way it's over, you failed to understand
You were dealing with a star, not your average brother man
On another note, I got to kick it with my sons
Up in Dave and Buster's, winning tickets, it was fun
Hit Rockaway Beach, played some frisbee in the sun
At summer camp they had a Track and Field Olympics and they won
I took it down to Miami on the Fourth
Wobbled out a mansion, and did cameo of course
Shit I brought to the telly looked like panties on a horse
Freak brain, this bitch said ""Nigga ram me 'til I cough.""
(I gotta call that bitch)
But yeah, Flex see that I'm focused
Droppin bombs like I did to get rid of the roaches
Feels good being Puerto Rican from the projects
Countries overseas having a ball like my cahones
This summer I did well setting up of Oh Eleven
Coming up on the year my granny said ""Hello"" to Heaven
My mom still goes through it, every now and then she cries
I'm trying to bring a different set of tears into her eyes
Free Agent is fire, the world's will sees it's tough
Gonna drop the Yaowa Mixtape with Green to heat it up
Shouts to ICU, the documentary is nuts
Some people on there gone, a lot of memories, but yup
Gotta keep it pushing, though the ride gets bumpy
I'mma keep whipping it 'til I get money
Hate to be so blunt, but I came up extra poor
Borrowed from next door, couldn't get ketchup from the store
The butt of all the jokes, cause of the rejects that I wore
Matching perfectly with all the V-necks that I tore
But nope, not no more, my feet keep the sickest kicks
Still doing V-necks, but now my shit is crisp
I'm coming for the title boys, I hope you niggas rhyme
Treating this like high school, ""A"" game every time
Let you niggas party, go on Vacay, I'mma grind
'Til every verse I kick is like Pele in his prime
Y'all don't want a war, screaming ""Mayday"" with a nine
Your thought caliber is no match for this AK in my mind
Don't get clapped, like sex with a dirty slut
When I'm done with rap, they gon' hang ya boy jersey up
Cause I done been an all star on all bars
My dad left and the apple never falls far
So I'm gone like a sports car
Anyone who thinks they're better is just wild, draw four cards
I did this by myself, no help brother
No more sag, I'm coming for that belt fuckers
Said my prayers and God called Joell's number
So stay tuned in the Fall
Farewell Summer"
Generation Lost,B.o.B,['hip hop'],"[Intro]
(Turbulence. Can you feel? Turbulence) Okay. (Can you feel?)
I need to spit something real for a second y'all. (Turbulence)
Just bare with me. Listen. (Can you feel? Turbulence.)

[Verse]
Skull and crossbones and death bandannas
A liquor store on every corner in Atlanta
Cops ridin' around tossin' niggas in the slammer
Tell me what's wrong, I could really use some answers
Now-a-days everybody wants to be a rapper
About two years ago everybody was a trapper
Obviously, money is what everybody's after
'Cause slavery ain't change; it's a modern day disaster
Now these are my words from me to you
Everything you do from your shades to your shoes
From your chains to your coupe came from the tube
Trust me, I would know, I was raised on it too
Okay, now just let me get your attention
I'ma turn the tables so you don't get defensive
I'ma put my bullshit aside for a second
'Cause I can't be fake 'cause God won't let me
I used to wear a grill, because it was the trend
Not because I liked it, I just wanted to fit in
Then I got ""Eastside"" tatted on my skin
And I tried to get dreads but my hair was too big
But I was lost, I ain't know who I was
What else was there to do besides look like a thug?
So in my senior year at Columbia High
I dropped out of high school when I got signed
B-dot-O-dot-B was the name
I ain't like Bobby Ray 'cause I was ashamed
But you can call me Bobby Ray from this day forth
And I could give a damn about the fame and fortune
Honestly, I don't even listen to rap
'Cause when I turn the radio on, out comes crap
And if you make good music that's okay
But on the radio, that they don't play
It's easy to see we created a beast
'Cause everybody wants to hear what they don't need
And now all the rappers got to struggle to give you
That bullshit music so they can continue to live
The position that I'm in
Is quite an interesting predicament, I will admit
But you can count on me 'cause I'm refusing to give in
'Cause I'ma give you music 'cause we need it to exist, bitch!
So I'ma play my guitar
Rap about aliens and sing about stars
'Til you understand that's what we are
So we ain't got to struggle no more so we don't starve
I swear to God I love you with every bar
We all got problems that need to be solved
So while I got the mic I'ma speak my thoughts
And I'ma keep it real till the day I fall
[Coda]
Turn my music up!"
Fly Song of Liberation,Exile,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","Ready Ex?

[Verse 1]
She said she was sick of the city life
A sweet girl but the world made her the shitty type
When she was young she just wanted to be pretty like
A model or an actress but, she had to work for her two kids
Father in jail serving time for two bids
Kids hungry asking mama where the food is
And she can see their hearts beating through their two ribs
Now she crying watching cribs
Cause the rent's due soon, in the one bedroom
And the kids kicking mama like I need some leg room
Daddy gone, the babies might as well be test tubes
In the projects stuck, wishing they could just move
To the country, I see her time to time, trying to make a little money
That makes me realize, shit, my life ain't that crummy
So one day I asked her how she deals with it
She said she she doesn't, she lets God, so she can fly

[Hook]
Fly, reach high and go
Wish on to a star
And release your soul
Cause you know you can fly
(Fly through the friendly skies)
Reach high and go
(Get you ticket, pack your shit, and let's roll)
Wish on a star
(And don't worry I'll catch you if you fall)
Release your soul
Cause you know you can fly
[Verse 2]
He said he had a problem with commitment
And it was probably cause his pops was into pimping
As a kid he called different women Momma
So he grew up with some drama
That he could never get out of, he was 18
Already hating life, so he blazed trees
And he could ball but he ditched everyday it seems
And his grades was so bad, he never made the team
So he started slanging trees, then he moved to coke
College coaches always noticed that the kid was dope
But he smoked too much
Dropped out of school, cause shit he didn't go too much
Till one day he overdosed, sniffing coke and such
I think about him time to time, and I realize how similar our past is
But how different my path is
One day I asked his dad how he deals with it
He said he doesn't, he gets high, so he can fly

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
He told me he was pressured and was stressing out
And he usually makes music just to let it out
He asked his mom about it and she told him pray to God
She didn't notice that the faith was fading from his mind
He tries to ignore the stress that he endures
Try to find some liberation but the pains is indoors
He's feelin sore since the bills start coming
His stomach started rumbling, Pops calls it growing pains
Ask his friends about it but, they don't know the pain
They just tell him roll a blunt, try to smoke some hay
So he gets high hoping it will go away
But it doesn't, shit is stuck is his head
Goes to sleep and the grief crawls up in his bed
Start tripping out thinking he should fuck with some meds
And he remembered what his grandpa said when he was young
So he looked to the sky, asking God how come?
I feel this pain time to time when I look in the mirror
And I realize, that guy's me trying to see clearer
So tell God I hear Him, and I know how to deal with it
Close my eyes till I find my spirit and just fly

I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing, I've foreseen it, I dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances, if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of autumn
All them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport, they check all through my bag
And tell me that it's random
But we stay winning
This week has been a bad massage, I need a happy ending
And a new beginning and a new fitted
And some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you don't know who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS

Is hip-hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they'd try to crack me if they ever see a Black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jumpshot, runnin' a track meet
But this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the world's games, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up off of this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest, nigga, I must have missed it

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying

I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said, ""Take them glasses off and get in the pool""
It's been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume, feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a Black Beatle anyway, a fuckin' roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fuckin' coach
My guy said I need a different approach
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffin' coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it, I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever, who has it?
You blowin' up, that's good, fantastic
That, y'all, it's like that, y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to blackball me
Forgot about two things, my Black balls

Ayy, yo

Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots, and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag', a Louis bag, grabbin' a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buyin' sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black Dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye

Uhh, Roc-A-Fella
Geyeah

[Verse 1]
We treat this rap shit just like, handlin' weight
What they want we give it to 'em, what they abandon we take
Hit a rapper with consignment, let him know it's at stake
Put his ass in the studio, let him cook up a cake
When it's hot, get on my money spot in every state
Like the wiz in Camelot, the mom-and-pop's is the gate
But first we scope shit, advertise in every area
Let the fiends know hey, we got some dope shit
Gon' need a middle man, so we look to radio
Let 'em test the product, give 'em a promo show
Just a breeze, not enough to catch a real vibe
Then we drop a maxi single and charge 'em two for five
Ain't tryin' to, kill 'em at first just, buildin' clientele
So when the album drops the first weeks it's on sale
But when demand grows it's time to expand yo
You don't want no garbage papi, it's ten grand per blow, fo' sho'
[Chorus]
""Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game""
""See that rap shit is really just like sellin' smoke""
""Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game""
""See that rap shit is really just like sellin' smoke""
""Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game""
""See that rap shit is really just like sellin' smoke""

[Verse 2]
Ge-ge-geyeah
I got that uncut raw to make a fiend's body jerk
Got your whole block now, pumpin' my work
My CD's is like keys for you Willie's who
Like to floss my cassette tapes in sixty-two's
And my singles like gems, you know the treys
Get you high for a while, but the, high don't stay
You need another fix, you better cop these last two bricks
'Cause when this shit flip, I'ma get on some other shit
Never pitchin' for a label, Jigga's the hook-up
You know my shit is fishscale, y'all niggas is cook up
Just blow up, scream my name from Brooklyn to Da-kota
They know my shit stretch without the bakin' soda
Went from an eighth, to a quarter, to a half a key
Priority's work wasn't right so I switched factories
Now I'm the new nigga, who figured I'd get the game locked
Now watch how the prices of your cocaine drop, papa
[Chorus]
""Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game""
""See that rap shit is really just like sellin' smoke""
""Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game""
""See that rap shit is really just like sellin' smoke""
""Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game""

Mockingbird,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But ayy
What'd Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

[Verse 1]
Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it
We gon' do it, Lainie—Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something
We have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream
[Chorus]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright (Heh)

[Verse 2]
It's funny, I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurts so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot, so Momma moved back
On to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre  and flew you and Momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh! Momma's only gone for the moment
[Chorus]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright

[Post-Chorus]
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Ha-ha!)"

It's bigger than hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, uh

[Verse 1: M-1]
One thing bout music when it hit you feel no pain
White folks say it controls your brain
I know better than that, that's game
Man, we ready for that
Two soldiers, head of the pack
Matter fact, who got the gat?
And where my army at?
Rather attack than not react
Back to beats, it don't reflect on how many records get sold
On sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll
Whether your project's put on hold
In the real world; these just people with ideas
They just like me and you when the smoke and camera disappear
Again the real world; it's bigger than all these fake-ass records
When poor folks got the millions and my woman's disrespected
If you check 1-2, my word of advice to you is just relax
Just do what you got to do; if that don't work then kick the facts
If you a fighter, rider, biter, flame-igniter, crowd-exciter
Or you wanna just get high then just say it
But then if you a liar-liar, pants on fire, wolf-crier, agent with a wire
I'm gon' know it when I play it

Nigga don't think these record deals gon' feed your seeds and pay your bills
Because they not (Uh-uh)
MC's get a little bit of love and think they hot
Talking bout how much money they got;
Nigga, all y'all records sound the same
I'm sick of that fake-thug-R&B-rap-scenario, all day on the radio
Same scenes in the video
Monotonous material
Y'all don't hear me though
These record labels slang our tapes like dope
You can be next in line and signed and still be writing rhymes and broke
You would rather have a Lexus or justice?
A dream or some substance?
A Bimmer, a necklace or freedom?
Still a nigga like me don't playa-hate, I just stay awake
This real hip-hop
And it don't stop 'til we get the po-po off the block

Heart and Heart
Left Right Left
We'll all fall down, Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit
Were torn apart
We'll never win
But the battle wages on, For toy soldiers

He's supposed to be the Soldier who never blew his composure
Even though he held the whole world on his shoulders
He wasn't ever to show it, nobody is supposed it. Even if it meant going toe to toe with a lieutenant it never mattered
He never dragged them into battle that he can handle
That soldiers name was Joseph Ray Torres
That man had a tough life. He always tried to become a rapper
But he turned out a captain
Some good did happen to him
He and Ray had sat down to talk
Ray asked not to rap
He didn't believe it was happenin'
Until the lieutenant knocked on his door
Askin' for him to be his captain
Step then step

Are you gon' call me like you said you would?
Is this really your real phone number?""
Wait a minute motherfuckers

Ain't a hood nigga, but a nigga from the hood
See, mama stayed on me so I turned out pretty good
But if you wanna try, sucker now then we can do it
Ha-ha, sleep, Tylenol PM if I pull it
Sh-sh-sheep, count 'em for the rest of ya life
Yeah, yeah your partner got away, but now he vegetable-like
So-so I sent his mom and dad a whole case of V8
He can die any second, how much longer it's 'gon take?
Go and get it over with, oh, what if you were in my loafers then?
You might be the dope, but I would flush it down the toilet
Like the boys in blue when they come through with them boots
And they kickin' down the door and they don't care who they shoot
But we do care who they shoot, so we do what we must do
So we act like we run track, then we run straight to the back
But they comin' from the back, so we run back to the front
They say get down on ya knees, we say, ""What the fuck you want?""
They want cheese, they want bread, they want dough, they want mo'
Than I wanna give 'em, but if I keep talkin' they won't know
That my cousin in the back, and we call him Roto-Rooter

Keep my tires bald, I never leave a paper trail
Nah, I'ma keep it clean, ball when I hit the scene
Elbow out the window, show 'em how to gangsta lean
Put Cali on the map, west side on my back
Hometown on my face, forty-five on my lap
Twenty in my earlobe, hundred on my neck piece
Just bought a Bentley, nigga, and I'ma throw some Ds on that bitch
Pull up at the rim shop and throw some Ds on that bitch

Let the sunshine in and the bass jump out
Hit the block, fifteens vibratin' the whole fuckin' house

The Problem,Wale,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'alternative', 'jazz', 'blues', 'rock']","[Wale] (Spoken Word)
This isn't no gripe but a mere portion of a semi-important life
Far from a complaint, but a mere look at the present showing you the changes that I made
The proverbial lemonade that I made
I made my mistakes, you see life's lemons often times come in a abundance
In conjunction with the pressure that we're under
Underrated some would say
Hated, and some say it's the things I say or how I say em
And I admit, in this race I tend to struggle to relate in words
It's like I'm an alien who alienates by the herd, so as far as being heard
I guess I gotta wait, deprived by the station's eye
Wale, more times than not, am not for whom the air waves
Thank God for the free thinkers, for you keep me in mind
In this state of mind that I'm in, for you keep me in the race with the baton that y'all give
And they hypebeasts, street wear, Versace and Vuitton that I'm in
And really don't matter unless y'all coming with
No days off, may we rip the face of the whole game off
Imma say it to y'all, I'm gonna put my faith in y'all when I don't understand me
They say I'm running hip-hop but I'd rather unify with y'all then stampede
And lastly for everybody who doubted I can't live without you, please
Continue to inspire the fire that is my re-dedication to greatness y'all
Paint A Picture to A.D. to freestyles to famous songs we out 'chere (here)
Unforgettable gestures, unmeasurable effort, to pleasure the masses with impeccable work ethic
Let's get it, I go hard, no days off
[Verse 1: Part 1]
Pain on my face, laying back rolling a J
Feeling like these rap niggas ain't as real as they say
That's why I keep my friends limited, Keep them hoes interested
Resented by the game like I'm Pete Rose in this bitch
Ain't nothing stopping us, tell u what the problem is
I'm on top of my game but these niggas won't acknowledge it
So a nigga hungry as a plastic hippopotamus
So, to stop us better take it in blood like a phlebotomist

[Seinfeld Skit]
You really need some help
But a regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you, you know what I mean?
You need to get involved at the university level, like where Freud studied
And have all those people looking at you and checking up on you
That's the kind of help you need, not the once-a-week for eighty bucks, no
You need a team, a team of psychiatrists working around the clock
You need to go to, like, Vienna or something

[Verse 1: Part 1]

[Verse 1: Part 2]
I walk around understanding the politics
Wish you niggas father understood where the condom was
'06 came, had all kind of buzz
And Isaiah say one day your time will come
Then '09 came, them bad record sales
The silver-lining couldn't find 'em up on any shelf
I'm in the mirror like ""this a product of my skills?""
And I feared that my fans say I failed
It's just my fate, let me chill, nah flip
My shit was submarine like, under ship
Look at what I'm up against, scrutiny, criticism
Everybody judging off a single I ain't even pick
Now my eyes Chinese, keep the loud lit
Now I'm taking these pills and I ain't even sick
Ice and Rain, Letter, Center of Attention
I wanted them on my debut, but they ain't wanna listen
You know I love my team, but they couldn't see my vision
Interscope is my fam, so I ain't tryna make no issue
I'm just trying to paint that picture, when I'm rhyming up in this booth
I'ma try to rhyme and get through, I'm documenting the truth
Men lie. Women lie. Numbers won't forsaken
The only album flop is the album niggas hate so
A.D. 2, on the way, let's do this
And God willin' niggas gonna triple up them units
Triple up them units, wisdom is improvin'
If no one's there to listen guess I'll put it in the music
Triple up them units, wisdom is improvin'
I'm heading to Vienna since y'all niggas ain't doin' shit!"
Love the Way You Lie Pt. II,Rihanna,"['pop', 'r&b', 'jazz', 'rock', 'alternative', 'hip hop', 'blues']","[Verse 1: Rihanna]
On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie, oh

[Bridge: Rihanna]
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction (Shh)
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths, but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each other's backs 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times, I'm starting to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out, I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
'Cause with you, I'm in my fucking mind, without you, I'm out it
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"

And his partner, the grand wizard, MC Ricky D

And we gonna show you how we do it for '85, kick it live, alright
Because, um, I've got a funny feeling, um
You're all sick of all these crap rappers
Biting their rhymes because, um, they're back-stabbers
But, uh, when it comes to me and my friend Doug Fresh here
There is no competition 'cause we are the best, yeah
Finesse impress which we prove
And y'all will realize that we are on the move
So listen close so you all don't miss

And when we rock up on the mic we rock the mic (Right)
For all of y'all keeping y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
'Cause it's cool when you 'cause a cozy condition
That we create, 'cause that's our mission
So listen to what we say
Because this type of shit, it happens every day
I woke up around ten o'clock in the morning
I gave myself a stretch up, a morning yawning
Went to the bathroom to wash up
Had some soap on my face and my hand upon a cup
I said, ""Um, mirror, mirror on the wall
Who is the top choice of them all?""
There was a rumble jumble, five minutes it lasted
The mirror said, ""You are, you conceited bastard!""
But that's true, that's why we never have no beef
So then I washed off the soap and brushed the gold teeth
Used Oil Of Olay 'cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the files for my fingernails
Due to the night and on my behalf
I put the bubbles in the tub so I could have a bubble bath
Clean, dry was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new Gucci underwear
For all the girls I might take home
I got the Johnson's Baby Powder and the Polo cologne
Fresh dressed like a million bucks
Threw on the Bally shoes and the fly green socks
Stepped out my house stopped short, oh no
I went back in, I forgot my Kangol
And then I dilly (dally), I ran though a (alley)
I bumped into my old girl (Sally) from the (valley)
This is a girl plays hard to get so I said
""What's wrong?"" 'cause she looked upset, she said
""It's all because of you I'm feeling sad and blue
You went away and now my life is filled with rainy days
And I love you so, how much you'll never know
'Cause you took your love away from me""
Now what was I to do
She's crying over me and she was feeling blue
I said, um, ""Don't cry, dry your eye
Here comes your mother with those two little guys""
Her mean mother stepped up, said to me ""hi""
Looked Sally in the face and decked her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong, the kids was gone
Something was wrong, I said ""What is going on?""
I tried to break it up, I said ""Stop it, leave her""
She said ""If I can't have you, she can't either""
She grabbed me closely by my socks
So I broke the hell out like I had the chicken pox, but
She gave chase, she caught up quick
She put a finger in the face of MC Rick
She said, ""Why don't you give me a play
So we can go cruising in my OJ?
And if you give me that OK
I'll give you all my love today
Ricky, Ricky, Ricky, can't you see?
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Oh, MC Rick, my love is here to stay!""
And on and on and on she kept on
The bitch been around before my mother's born
I said, ""Cheer up,"" I gave her a kiss
I said, ""You can't have me, I'm too young for you miss.""
She says, ""No, you're not!"" then she starts crying
I says, ""I'm nineteen,"" she said, ""Stop lying!""
I says, ""I am, go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy, I can't be your lover!""

To the tick tick ya don't quit
Hit it!

Talking to myself but I never listen
'Cause man it's been a while, and I swear that this ones different
That's why I'ma take you anywhere you wanna go

If Rap Gets Jealous,K'naan,['hip hop'],"So good things come to those who wait
Sure, I've waited about pop-pop-pop-pop
That's four cousins shot!
I got grudges, let's discuss this
My music needs no touch ups
I got a long record of fuck ups
Trust me you don't know a past as weird as mine
Or a life as hard as mine
I had to hustle, chop, sell drugs, grind
Whatever you want to call it is fine
But just listen, and don't prejudge
I don't want anyone dismissin' me as another thug
Or some shit like that
No Sir! If I fall I will get right back
I got circumstances, but let me stop dancin' around the issue
And tell you straight forward, I'm poor
A refugee, been in prison and survived the war
I come from the most dangerous city in this universe
You're likely to get shot at birth!

So how can rap quench my thirst
I don't even hear verses no more
I hear jerkin' off punks with lip glosses and purses
I don't see nobody operatin' shit anymore
I see nurses, fuck that! I'm gonna stay alive!
I'd rather do a stage dive!
[Hook]
And if rap gets jealous cause I rock heavy
It don't worry me if m'aa fuckers don't get it
Yo, if rap gets jealous, words that were admitted
I used to be a public enemy don't forget it
And if rap gets jealous cause I rock heavy
It don't worry me if m'aa fuckers don't get it
Yo, if rap gets jealous, cause of where I'm headed
Aggression, obsession, where pain live again

So yeah, basically I gotta realease occasionaly
I gotta let you know what's goin' on with me
And facing me are some tough choices
I got a good side and a bad side
Inside my head, I hear screams, not voices
And I can't lie, ain't got Shit!
I ain't got to brag
I'm hard pressed for some cash to send to my ill dad
You're so superficial!
Of course it's for shizzle
Now my choice is to piss on you boys
Cause my mission is the world
To know my name
My aim is plainly success
But I still gotta come fresh
So, how could rap quench my thirst
I don't even hear verses no more
I hear jerkin' off,punks with lip glosses and purses
I don't see nobody operating shit anymore
I see nurses, Fuck that!, I'm gonna stay alive! I'd rather do a stage dive!

You can't do shit with it, Ha!
That's gotta be Fucked up!, know what I'm sayin'?

Should of known I was being used
But love is transparent, whats the sense of seeing through?
Feels like I need abuse
Beauty views me as a needle-proof fiend
Addictive, Contagious, A drifter that lives in a maze
Lifted from haze, Picturing days when bitches wouldn't give me a hey
Flippin' the page, to sit with the days I visit to get some inspira-
I'm used to the tion(shun), 2nd nature
Heaven made it so I can't escape the sun
Log on, so I can get my blog on
My truth is lonely cause' I speak the Doggone
I'm a loner, followed by loners
People who get publicly abused then apologize

[Hook]
Sometimes I feel like I am
All Alone, All Alone
Ain't got nobody I can
Call my own, Call my own
No matter where I go I
Call it home, Call it home
And if you feel the same then you ain't
All Alone...Cause' I'm right here
[Verse 2]
He was the Outkast, no friends
No window of escape from his zone-age
He gravitated to the music that I made
He was glad I made it, I befriended him
I don't see myself as a star, I'm the sun
I was scared to melt him from afar
But He was cool, our friendship made him popular in school
Not to be confused, he wrote down his favorite songs of mine
I guess to be strong in mind, his insecurity reflected mine
I respect him, why? The bond is real
Sometimes I think he's on my heels
But nah, he uses my songs to heal
Which makes me strong as steel
Why the FUCK would I need mainstream appeal?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The boy said she was too fat
She was too scared to eat in school, Whack
Her father is a lot of broken promises
And her mother's a subject that she don't bother with
Not a virgin, but not proud
After the nigga came, she was knocked down
So she visits my blog to see what I say
The parallels between her life and my day
Wish I could take all of my listeners to space
Where we can hawk loogies, and spit in niggas' faces
Then play with the biggest Sega Genesis
Forget the days we missed, decayed innocence
The game isn't as dope as it looks, its dope
Lookin' for more dopes to get hooked
Before you cross-over
I just hope that you look at the words that I wrote in this book
[Hook]

[Talking]
Somebody hit me on twitter one day and said
That, because all the shit that I been goin' through in public
That I ain't never gonna have no mainstream kinda...whatever
That's the biggest bullshit i've ever heard in my life
I don't know how many times I'm goin to say it
I don't be doin' this shit so I can pop bottles and pour it on models and shit
Even if I have 5 fans, and I save 5 lives
That's what's most important to me
You can't tell me these people don't exist
You can't tell me that, these are f*ckin' celebrities
Disguising themselves as, fans
Just do they can f*ck with my head
I know my music has saved lives
And I know I'm changing the world
You can kiss my ass if you think otherwise
Charles Hamilton, I'm done...Nigga
By the way I ain't never done
Keep on doin' this shit as long as I live"

New double Ds smashed in her blouses
Fuck a hotel, my nigga we rent houses (Houses)
My nigga, we rent houses
So many wedding rings lost in them couches
I’m just a Westside lover
I leave females in my sheets and all my feelings in a rubber
This is showtime, showtime, boy, I hope you set the DVR
Stacking money face to face, this shit look like CPR
‘Ye invited me a seat to sit at the throne
So now I’m snappin’ like yo ass just finished the poem
Does he sound like 'Ye, Jay or Drizzy Drake? (Drizzy Drake)
Meanwhile I’m chillin’ with all these niggas, counting all this money you ain’t
Consider yourself lucky to see a legend before the prime
A killer before the crime, a B.I.G. before the dying
Greet me with a middle finger when you see me
It’s cool 'cause I can’t see yo ass from this side of the TV, motherfucker!

[Verse 5: J. Cole]
Hey, Cole World, make way for the chosen one
What you now hear is puttin’ fear in all the older ones
Downplayed me to downgrade me like they don’t notice him
Your shoes too big to fill? I can barely squeeze my toes in ‘em
Fucking hoes while teachin' niggas to hold your sons
This the rap Moses—scratch that, Mary and Joseph’s son
High as fuck with a cold flow and a loaded gun
Never say I’m better than Hov, but I’m the closest one
Heard you lookin’ for trouble, what, I’m 'sposed to run?
Your bitch invited me inside her, ain’t I 'sposed to come?
Got niggas that’ll blow your tee off, put a hole in one
Now you outside of Heaven’s gate, frontin’ like you know someone
Talking hard, but y’all still ain’t push me
They say you are what you eat, and I still ain’t pussy
Hmm, fuck it, everybody can get it
When you’re this hot, everybody’s a critic
But when you’re this high, everybody’s a midget
All this mean-mugging from niggas that mean nothing
Could it be my position is one that you dreamed of?
Went from quarter to broke to half-past-rich
With my badass bitch
And you don’t want no problems, on some math class shit
So check the young genius out
Fuck the world, bust a nut, and let my semen sprout
I thought that real shit is what you been fiending ’bout
What you been praying for? What you been screaming ’bout?
Ironic, you been sleeping on the one that you been dreaming 'bout"

You just waitin' on the traffic jam to finish, girl
The things that we could do in twenty minutes, girl

Shady Aftermath and Soul Assassins
Here we go!

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Niggas know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn 'cause I don't have to
You could run your mouth I don't care
But if you get too close I'm gon' clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is a last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day (Obie Trice!) (Go!)

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Niggas, when I step up in a bar (uh huh), faggots wanna look (what?)
Like you motherfuckers got Obie Trice shook
Like I'mma stand here as a man and
Let some queer-ass, funny-looking nigga get the upper hand (hahaha)
I got issues, got no time
Got guns that mourn niggas' moms (what else?)
Shoot up clubs and destroy niggas' vibes (come on!)
Everybody running for their motherfucking lives (ahh!)
Tough club niggas, we leave early, cock back surely
Open up your fade your gray brain meets Motor City pave'
Your nervous system still twitch off Jay-Z
O is an animal, skirts get murked
Don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
Don't ever let a nigga tell you to play the bar hard
Trust in God 'cause you's about to get catch a bullet scar
I give a fuck where you from, who you be with
Keep this a secret right by the nuts
A 4-5 that'll light niggas up and this 4-5 high make me not give a fuck

Niggas know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn 'cause I don't have to

It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is a last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
But as long as I'm here I'm gonna grab checks
And make my cash stretch longer than giraffe necks
Poverty'll make your ass bet
My words touch niggas in jail, make them wanna finish they last set
They say you live by the gun, you die by the next nigga gun
If that's the case, then get a bigger one
You don't think I pack the pump 'cause I'm out the hood?
That's a stereotype, like everybody that's Black can jump
I'm in the white mink, the fabric is done
Got rings like Mike, Bird, Magic, and them
Out in Dallas to the Palace where the Mavericks is from
Living lavish I'm established, so the cabbage'll come
I'm in the clouds, you don't see me on the train
I travel first class, you ain't even got a TV on your plane
You should be easy on my name 'cause I ain't going back and forth
Your boss and your captain soft (BITCH!)
[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Niggas know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn 'cause I don't have to
You could run your mouth I don't care

You want it, you gon' get it
Name 'em we gon' hit 'em chew 'em up and spit 'em out
Too much venom and if you roll with 'em
We gon' fuck you up with 'em
I got too much momentum moving in my direction to lose
My shoes will explode as soon as you go to step in them, (BOOM)
You know how we do it when we do
How we do it when we come through
G-Unit, D-1-2 and Obie we all move like assassins
Ski mask and gloves consider this as a warning
Disaster comes faster than you can react to it, just ask Muggs
But we are fizz-ast, fuck your little bitch ass up
We are not killers, my vato will have you shot, though
Dragged through the barrio and fucked like Kim Osorio's
Little sorry ho ass, go ask B-Real
We burn Source covers like fucking Cypress Hill (break it down!)
Did in the '90s, when you was in diapers still
Shady Records, you better believe the hype is real
This is no joke, I don't smoke
But I toke enough secondhand to make my fucking P.O. choke (yeah!)
I'm an OG, you're fucking with a G.I. Joe
Bia Bia, mira mio la vida loc'
I'm a psycho, Mariah ain't got shit on me
When I retire I'll be spitting baby food on people
At San Ysidro Ranch huddled up next to her
With Hello Kitty slippers on, humping her legs
You ever had your cap peeled back or your shit pushed in?
I put my blade in you like a fucking pin cushion
Slice your ear clear off, Smirnoff and Hen, dog
I'll show you how to kill a fucking man like Sen Dog
(Bring it, bring it, bring it back!)
Nobody told you that I'm loco, ése?
I lack every sane chemical in my membrane
I'm Slim Sha-D and the 'D' is for deez nuts
And you can get each one for free so feast up (uh-huh!)
I'll pee in a cup for three months
I'm having an E party for Easter please come
'Cause we gon'
[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
We gon' bring it to anybody who want it
You want it, you gon' get it
You name 'em and we'll hit 'em, chew 'em up and spit 'em out
*Hock-ptui* Too much venom and if you roll with 'em
We gon' fuck you up with 'em
You can do all them push ups to pump up your chest
I got a twelve gauge Mossberg to pump up your chest
Have you gasping for air after that shell hit your vest
Fear me like you fear God 'cause I bring death (goddamn)
Silverback gorilla in the concrete jungle
I'm the strongest around, you know how I get down (woo!)
I watch gangsta flicks and root for the bad guy
And turn it off before it end 'cause the bad guy die (c'mon!)
If you trying to buy guns, I'm the nigga to look to
So what they got bodies on them? They still look new (yeah)
You can raise your voice like you fitting to touch something
When I raise my knife, shit, I'm fitting to cut something
They say I walk like Ron O'Neal, and talk like Goldie
If the bitch think I love her, the bitch don't know me
Hahaha, sorry Kim (Oh, sorry, oh)

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Niggas know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn 'cause I don't have to
You could run your mouth I don't care

Go to Sleep,Eminem,['hip hop'],"[Verse 1: Eminem]
I ain't gonna eat, I ain't gonna sleep
Ain't gonna breathe 'til I see what I wanna see
And what I wanna see is you go to sleep in the dirt
Permanently; you just being hurt
Just ain't gonna work for me, it just wouldn't be
Sufficient enough 'cause we are just gonna be
Enemies as long as we breathe, I don't ever see
Either of us comin' to terms where we can agree
There ain't gonna be no reasonin' speakin' with me
You speak on my seed, then me no speak-a Inglés
So we gonna beef, and keep on beefin' unless
You're gonna agree to meet with me in the flesh
And settle this face-to-face, and you're gonna see
A demon unleashed in me that you've never seen
And you're gonna see this gangster pee on himself
I see you D12, and thanks, but me need no help
Me do this one all by my lonely, I don't need fifteen of my homies
When I see you, I'm seein' you, me and you only
We never met, but best believe you gon' know me
When I'm this close to see you exposed as phony
Come on, bitch, show me! Pick me up, throw me!
Lift me up, hold me—just like you told me
You was gonna do, that's what I thought, you're pitiful
I'm rid of you, all of you, Ja, you'll get it too
[Chorus: Eminem & DMX]
Now go to sleep, bitch! Die, motherfucker, die!
Ugh, time's up, bitch, close your eyes!
Go to sleep, bitch! (What!) Why are you still alive?
How many times I gotta say, close your eyes!
And go to sleep, bitch! (What!) Die, motherfucker, die!
Bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye!
Go to sleep, bitch! (What!) Why are you still alive?
Why? Die, motherfucker! Ah, ah, ah, go to sleep, bitch!

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
We got you niggas nervous on purpose
To hurt your focus, you's not MCs
You's worthless, you's not them G's
You's a circus, you's no appeal, please
Use curtains, you use words Kool Herc slurred
In two-thousand-third: you's perpin'
You's no threat, who's you servin'?
When lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
You fuck with a label overseein' the Earth
Shady, mothafucka, O. Trice's birth
And as I mold I become more cursed
So we can put down the verse, take it to the turf
Cock and squeeze, and he who reach the hearse
Is he who depicts fiction in his verse
And as I breathe, and you be deceased
The world believe you deceived just to speak
You's not the streets, you's the desk
Use not your chest, nigga, use a vest
Before tools choose your rest, you chose death
Six feet deep, nigga, that's the depth
[Chorus: Eminem & DMX]
Now go to sleep, bitch! Die, motherfucker, die!
Ugh, time's up, bitch, close your eyes!
Go to sleep, bitch! (What!) Why are you still alive?
How many times I gotta say, close your eyes!
And go to sleep, bitch! (What!) Die, motherfucker, die!
Bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye!
Go to sleep, bitch! (What!) Why are you still alive?
Why? Die, motherfucker! Ah, ah, ah, go to sleep, bitch!

I'ma stay blazin' New York with the heat (Yeah)
Stalk on the beat (Yeah), walk with my feet (Ugh!)
Understand my pain, the rain ain't sleet (What!)
Peep how I'm movin' (Uh-huh), peep where I'm goin' (Uh-huh)
Shit don't seep, then sleep not knowin' (Woo!)
But I'ma keep growin', gettin' larger than life
Easy goin' with the same one that started the fight
He be knowin' how dog get when dog gonna bite (Ugh!)
Tried to show him the dog shit, it's dog for life (Ugh!)
Grand Champ, and my Blood Line is tight (What!)
'Cause it's all good (Yeah!), 'cause it's all right (Come on!)

Now they got to swallow everything in the sack
Blood Line, and we can go track for track
Damn, dog, why'd you have to do them niggas like that?

The Philosophy of Horror,Jedi Mind Tricks,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues']","[Verse 1]
I was Albert Eiensteins mind, I was Italy's fine wine
I was working with God when he defined time
I was there when the guns first let off
There when they cut King Charles' head off
There when the CIA bottled the crack
And the tradgedy and triumph of Geronimo Pratt
Punch a faggot till his nose bleed heavy
Dead 'em all, then I escape in green Chevy
I merk your wisdom, spit a dart at you to hurt your vision
Put you in the worst position in a Turkish prison
Yeah, and my intention is to waste y'all
And cover your body with stitches like a baseball
I fucking lace y'all with the word of the sword
And leaving you bleeding in a ditch while you serving the lord
You deserve to be mauled by an army of bees
Just another faggot dead in his army fatigues

[Verse 2]
Fuck ya crucifix, your religion and its uselessness
Your propaganda is more wickeder than Lucifer's
Islamic scientists predicted the computer chips
I spit a rap at you to rock you like Medusa's lips
You fucking goons are sick, and y'all can see that
And y'all are my sons like Ebrahim and Eshak
So lets take a walk through the tivest town
I'm the divine science of the light and the sound
I'm the sublime giant with the right to the crown
I'm the divine tyrant and I'm striking you down
So I teach my kin to attack the beast
For trying to hide me from the 4th book of Maccabees
You wack MC's catch a hook to the head
Cause y'all don't know about the Tibetan book of the dead
You don't know about anything that's important
About the Dead Sea scrolls found in Jordan
About the way that you conduct yourself in Satan's wrath
But I don't fuck with you, you walking down the pagan's path
[Verse 3]
I'm a swordsmen, the apocolypse horsemen
What makes me smile is another's misfortune
I like to see your body in flames scortchin'
I like to see a part of your brain auctioned
I like to see inside of your main organs
I like to see inside of your veins pourin'
I find beauty in another's pain
I find beauty in the spirit of God but I don't fuckin' change
I find serenity in torture
My thoughts are too pure for the human mind to author
It's called God consciousness
Its a level beyond the God's marred thoughtlessness
I stay ready for the combat
While the ignorant praying and they wondering where they God at
I stay ready for the combat
While the ignorant praying and they wondering where they God at"

Dear Christopher ""Frank White"" Wallace
Yeah it's your boy Kiss I just want to holla
In your memory I keep the Coogi in my closet
Kangol on the rack, a fresh pair of Wallies
You know I'm still the liquor and the weed child
And still got Branson on speed dial
And everybody's the king now
You ain't gotta be nice getting shot is the thing now
Mafia was doing their best, they separated
Now Roc and Gutta doing a stretch, uh, yeah
Kim is still in it to win it
I seen Money L awhile ago but I ain't heard from Cease in a minute
People in power is queer
I could go on for a year 'bout how it would be if you were still here
The game got cheaper, rappers is more commercially successful now
But the heart's a lot weaker
You know me still got the flow that'll pop speakers
First option on offense the top feature
It's easy BIG all you need is a pro-tool set
And I ain't touch the paper that I was supposed to yet
Everybody that's somebody show respect
Only a matter of time before they notice that (Just a matter of time, matter of time)
I'm an impeccable lyricist
And with the right mechanics, I could take over be clear of this
They well aware of Kiss the light of the city
And I ain't on the label no more but I'm tighter with Diddy
I got my own plan handle mine like a grown man
Long as I know I'm nice, fuck it I'm my own fan
Remixed the joints you had
But, they could never ever duplicate your swag (Never)
Meanwhile I'm a keep it so on my lil' plans
And you might bump into a few of my lil' mans
Up there stepping with God
And down here Mister Cee in BK still repping you hard
T-yanna so pretty, CJ turned into a Lil' Biggie
Just a little lighter but so witty
On your born day, we get the highest
Groovy still the best with the garments, he keep me the flyest
Tonight, Patron is dead
Only right that I take a bottle of Bacardi Limon to the head
And before I end it, I gotta say thanks
Cause not only was your time well-spent, it was splendid (thanks)
Miss you, my nigga
One Love (So we tried to hard to understand)

So we'll just keep our heads to the sky (Drink wit 'em)

As he waving ""Shorty, hi"", you know he showin' his bling out
She got in the car, he drove, he pulled his thing out
His girl caught feelings, she mad, she threw the ring out
How she found out she dreamt the whole thing out
Y'all be going through problems, you gotta work the kinks out
When you go to sleep? What do you think 'bout?
If y'all get a divorce
She gon' take everything except the kitchen sink out
Make it so cold that you gotta pull your mink out
Or grab your roller skates and turn a roller rink out
You now back up in the club, in the club, tryna min-gle
Meanwhile, she out doing the same thing now
Nightmares from your dream gal make you scream out

How you a man waiting for the next man to get rich?
Your plan is to stick out your hand real quick
So if he feed your family and he serve you shit
Then he need that head you get and he deserve your bitch
Since you wishin' cash fall from the sky all your life
Dwellin' on the past when you was alright
When you was getting cash but wasn't too bright
Now your luck down, you feel like bustin' them shells
Nobody owe you, can't do nothin' for self
Want niggas to show you, how to come up with green
I schemed since I'm 14, what the fuck was your dream?
Rental cars, little broads, saying you was seen
With little niggas with a chain, you was doing your thing
How high was I? You the thousandth guy
That came around thinking we can see eye to eye
We on a different echelon
Could've got bread together, now you get skedded on
[Refrain: Sample of Kanye West and Nas]

[Verse 3: Nas]
She had several cars, she had credit cards
A castle, large master bathroom, getting a pedicure
Bellinis by the glassful, said she been meaning to ask who
Who in need of cash who, who could blast tools
And I'm eating cashews, knew she was bad news
But we mad cool, nothin' sexual
‘Cause I knew her since high school
Grew up with my dudes, like one of my crew
She worked for Fox News
One of her mans that she lent her drop to
Won't come back with it, so she want him clapped in it
Says it's important that it looks like an accident
She was snorting and her eyes had bags in it
She was recording, had a wire, askin' shit
Four days before I came by she got bagged with bricks
Crossed the line from her world of news castin'
To a world of entrapment, a good girl gone backwards

Push the pool stick in your new crib

Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?

[Verse 2]
This ain't rappin', this is Street Hop
Now get up off yo' ass like your seat's hot
My live niggas lit up the reefer
Trunk of the car, we got the streetsweeper
Don't start none, won't be none
No reason for your mans to panic
You don't wanna see no ambulances
Knock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup
That's the way you get Timberland'd up
Let the music defuse all the tension
Baller convention, free admission
Hustlers, dealers and killers can move swift
Girls get close, you can feel where the tool's kept
All my just-comin' homies, parolees
Get money, leave the beef alone slowly
Get out my face, you people so phony
Pull out my waist, the Eagle four-forty
[Chorus]
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?

[Verse 3]
I see niggas runnin', yo, my mood is real rude
I lay you out, show you what steel do
Mobsters don't box, my pump shot obliges
Every invitation to fight you punk chazzers
Like Pun said: you ain't even en mi clasa
Maybach Benz, back seat, TV plasma
Ladies lookin' for athletes or rappers
Whatever you choose, whatever you do
Make sure he a thug and intelligent too
Like a real thoroughbred is
Show me love, let me feel how the head is
Females who's the sexiest is always the nastiest

[Outro]
And I like a little sassiness
A lot of class; Mami, reach in your bag, pass the fifth
I'm a leader at last, this a don you with
My 9's will spit, niggas lose consciousness"

My heart thump
Not from being nervous
Sometimes I'm thinking God
Made me special here on purpose
So all the while, 'til I'm gone
Make my words important
So if I slip away, if I die today
The last thing you remember won't be
About some apple bottom jeans
With the boots with the fur
Maybe how I dream of being free since my birth
Cursed, but the demons I confronted would disperse
Have you ever heard of some shit so real
Beyond, from the heart, from the soul, you can feel

[Chorus]
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
But please don't cry
Just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
'Cause I'm ready for the funeral

My mind runs
I could never catch it
Even if I got a head start
God please help me
I am feeling so alone, wait
I don't need to worry
'Cause I know the world'll feel this, nigga
Blessing in disguise, but
I am not hiding who I am, open your eyes, bruh
If I ever met you, I appreciate the love, yo
Girls that I dated, it's okay, I am not mad, yo
Unless you stabbed me in the heart, no love ho
The shit is so ill
Play it back from the top if you recognize real

Now everywhere I go they like HOV come back
Up out the corner office out the cul-de-sac
Where's Iceberg Slim he was the coldest cat
Get your swag back daddy where your focus at
Got to admit a little bit I was sick of rap
But despite that the boy is back
And I'm so evolved I'm so involved
I'm showing growth, I'm so in charge
I'm CEO and yeah glory to God
I'm so indebted, I should have been deaded
Selling blow in the park, this I know in my heart
Now I'm so enlightened I might glow in the dark

But, just when you thought the whole world fell apart
I, take off the blazer, loosen up the tie
Step inside the booth, Superman is alive

C'mon playboys, bring the cars back out
'Cause ya boy Hov is back, you know them broads coming out
Got 'em dancing on the banquette, like they from Bankhead
Fuck Cristal, so they ask me what we drinking
I thought dudes remark was rude okay
So I moved on to Dom, Krug Rosé
And it's much bigger issues in the world, I know
But I first had to take care of the world I know
I'm from the bottom, so I still feel 'em from the bottom

Since I was six, seventeen been getting money down South

Y'all run, we chill still waters run deep

So, I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Saying that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'ed every girl that I'd see-see 'round town
And hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smilin'
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, it makes no sense, I know crazy
Give up all this pussy cat that's in my lap, no looking back
Spaceships don't come equipped with rearview mirrors
They dip as quick as they can, the atmosphere is now ripped
I'm so like a pimp, I'm glad it's night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon, high jump the broom
Like a preemie out the womb, my partner yelling, ""Too soon!
Don't do it! Reconsider, read some liter-
Ature on the subject; you sure? Fuck it
You know we got your back like chiroprac-tic
If that bitch do you dirty, we'll wipe her ass out as in detergent
Now hurry, hurry, go on to the altar
I know you ain't a pimp, but pimp, remember what I taught ya:
Keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Ayy, keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Man, these girls is smart, Three Stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part, play your part""

Fuckin' up the game, bitch, it gets no love

Send her in to outer space, I know he wish he could

Ten and a half in them Airforce 1's, gimme two purr (pair) ugh
I'm from the Lou' and what I do is a Lou' thang
One rapper, two rings and three chains

[Verse 3 - Kyjuan]
Nothing but some ole country boys that ride V-12 horses
(Yee-haw!)
Saddle up and put spurs on my Airforce's
Back porches made for hide and go seek
We got space out hurr, we can ride and chief
Ain't gotta worry 'bout nobody approachin' us
By the time they catchin' up, we smoked it up
And my eyes be red, my lips a lil' dark
The Lou is more than the Rams, Cards and lil' Arch
My dirty's love to spark, and love to sparkle
Love homies *Vokal* coats with matchin' car do's (doors)
We racin down Skinker, see how fast our car go
Granny be like ""Ay-yi-yi"" like Ricky Ricardo
I know you wanna know why we do what we do
You cats ain't got a clue why the Cutlass blue
Brand new twenty-two's on new UV's
With one, two, three, four, five TV's
[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Big Lee A.K.A. Ali]
I'm sittin' on the front porch, writin a hood rhyme
Waitin on my connect to deliver that good line
Wish I would find, one seed in my weed
Sticks and shit, if I do somebody bleed
Pull right here, eight pounds of Chinamen
Two stay hittin some blunts and Heineken
Hidin in the back with the po' po'
Kicked in my do'do', man they some ho' hooo's
They put the gun to my earr, you know the Lord don't fear
Nann nigga, nann ho, let's keep that bullshit clearr
They had me face down in the skreet
Errbody watchin, thinkin I'mma pull the heat
And leave the D-tects with a leak in the skreet
And that - pussy ass nigga that set me up my peeps
Gon' give it to this nigga like NYPD
Beat the K, fuck coke, now I'm back on my granny porch hustlin

[Verse 1: Wale]
I keep my friends close, enemies on a leash like
Me and my haters is literally Siamese
I can define me but if I let my friends do it
They'd tell you I'm some bipolar, hard drug user
The J gets smaller, I'm loving my zone
Though surrounded by an entourage, I feel like I'm alone
A long way from normal, I try to keep it cordial
I made some new friends, meet recorder and touring
Shout out to my nigga, it's now for a nigga
Know some niggas back home ain't proud of a nigga
They don't see my vision, grown man mission
They all see my life from a childish position
I'm the mouth of the District, nobody work harder
My heart is in the monuments, saliva's is in the harbor
So tell me all my followers, am I wrong for barking?
Am I wrong for thinking I was better off in college?
At least I'd be stable, yeah, slightly less popular
But wouldn't be the topic of my few friends talking
A few niggas talk but they do without knowledge
I do self evaluate, yeah, I know I've got some problems
Can't change who I am, I just try to get better
So in the mean time, keep it moving or accept that
And you all will respect that
[Seinfeld Skit]

[Verse 2: Wale]
Yeah
You always say you wasn't ready for no man
But I wasn't having that, I gave you everything I had
Now everything I had are the very things you have
Tricking, king of the court, small forward, Cavs
Where your whereabouts baby? I care about you lady
And I bet you all them letters in your mailbox waiting
And I ain't never plan to be famous
So I'm a take that rubber off, I wouldn't mind having babies
With a home girl, best friend, lover, all that
Ex-boyfriend was wack, she had enough of all that
Look me in my eyes, say if you take it I'm a give it
And if I give it to you, don't you treat me like them bitches
Please Wale, she used to call me 'Le
One day she called me early, to tell me that she late
Fuck you mean?
See my hands start to shake
I ain't looking in her eyes but her face
Cause tears falling down make me ache
We should just ignore it, you know we can't afford it
She said I cannot believe that you say we should abort it
I will not support it, what happened to you courting?
And I ain't want no nigga from the jump, you ignored it
You just had to force it, you had to keep going
Now that little pre cum gone be having me swollen
As we go forward, I came back from touring
The DNA result, congrats ex-boyfriend

[Hook: Tré of UCB] x2
Smiles and handshakes everywhere I go
Girlfriends, groupies, then I'm all alone
So confused, these strange relationships
I think I've got some enemies disguised as friends"

Hit hard like sledge-hammers
Bitch with that platinum grammar
I am a diamond cluster hustler, queen bitch, supreme bitch
Kill a nigga for my nigga by any means bitch, murder scene bitch
Clean bitch, disease-free bitch, check it
I write a rhyme, melt in your mouth like M&M's
Roll with the M.A.F.I.A., remember them?
Tell 'em when I used to mess with gentlemen, straight up apostles
Now strictly niggas that jostle
Kill a nigga for the figure, how you figure?
Your cheddar would be better
Beretta inside of Beretta, nobody do it better
Bet I wet ya like hurricanes and typhoons
Got buffoons eating my pussy while I watch cartoons
Sleep 'til noon, rap Pam Grier's here
Baby drinkers beware, mostly Dolce wear
Frank kill niggas' wives for one point five

I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell
But well, I'm wonderin' what type of shit you wantin'
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman?
Would you drink with a nigga? Do you smoke weed?
Don't be ashamed, it ain't no thing, I used to blow trees
Gettin' lifted, I quit but shit, I might get high with you
It's only fittin' 'cause I'm lookin' super fly with you
A flower, you are powerful, you do somethin' to me
'Cause girl, I caught the vibe like you threw somethin' to me
So I threw 'em back, now all my niggas hollerin', “Who was that?”
“Oh boy, she bad nigga, what you 'bout to do with that?”

I'll be right here in the same bed that you left me in

Therefore you shouldn't judge a nigga off the shit that you hear
Get all defensive, apprehensive, all because my career
To be fair, I know we barely know each other and yeah
Somehow I wound up in your bed so where we headed from here?
Just say you're scared if you're scared
But if you through frontin', we can do somethin'
And you know just what I'm talkin' about

Got a pump under my seat, the sawed-off
Got a bunch of goons, hope they never call off
And them snipers sitting on the roof already saw y'all

Feeling kind of groggy. Stomach toss and turning
She said, ""Was that your belly or was it birds chirping?""
I said that I was hungry. She said, ""Baby, me too
Why don't we go out and get us some breakfast, boo?""
We ain't gotta leave to get no breakfast food
'cuz I'm a lady tamer and a chef too
So I began to cook
Could tell I had her shook
She wasn't ready for the recipe in Humma's book!

She said, ""I love the eggs. What did you do to 'em?
The way they smell and taste really got a girl drooling.""

Fried or fertilized? Baby, I'm confused!
Don't be offended. You got it misconstrued

Back when I was younger
Very ambitious but often blinded by my hunger
Some say I dream too big
And my dream gon' take me under
Beneath the streets of Gary
Would I make it out, I wonder
Could my obituary be the next they read amongst the
Niggas I came up with and fell victim to this dope game
Poverty stricken so our economy is cocaine
Ecstacy, heroin, marijuana ain't no hope man
Absentee fathers and dope fiend mamas
Got my hood turned out to the point that a nigga wanna go and get paid
Fuck sittin' on the bench I'mma go on
To the next lick til I'm goin' in my grave
Then I figured after that I could make a livin'
Off makin' words rhyme it was all in my mind
Everybody in the G went to Finger Roll studio
Nobody had a flow quite like mine
But along with the fame came a whole lot of
Hate from the hood, everyday I would fight
Mama can't sleep cause I'm way to deep in the streets
She would pray through the night
Every rhyme that I spit's real shit
Cause its just another day in my life
Niggas better keep a vest test to my testicles
They be vegetables, they gonna respect the flow 'til I'm gone

See how true your crew is, never new they was frontin'
And I bet a nigga told you, that whatever
You go through, we got your back 'til the end
When I came upon a deal, niggas that I never knew
I could blew, wanna come be my friends
Then the boy got dropped and the friendship stopped
In a flash I was back on my own
Put a strap on my lap and the stash in the back
Cause the fact I was wrappin them stones
Got back to the rap cause its all that
I got in the mid west streets be my voice

All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact
I got one in the front and two in the back
And the bitches keep screaming ""Odd Future is back""
All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact
I got one in the front and two in the back
And the bitches keep screaming ""Odd Future is back""

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Wolf with a T-Rex cock, less talk
While I invest stock in wet rock
Smoke with all the big bitches bumping ""Bedrock""
Sub in the trunk, thumping up against the dead cops
And pop it like I tossed a match in the engine
And go harder than a fucking crack intervention
Clown of the class and the last to attend it
Big Earl make you fags stand at attention
Odd Future, I'm your motherfucking general
Catch 'em where them slap, slash, stab bitch ass niggas go
Girl, you ain't even gotta ask 'cause you finna know
Why this Playboy so sticky in this centerfold
Sticky what my niggas blow, icky Earl finish foes
Hit 'em low, riddle them with Chronicles of Riddick bows
Chronic in the spliff to the dome, got my system slow
So I'm walking out, ask them niggas what they sprinting fo'
[Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt]
All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact
I got one in the front and two in the back

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Black Ted Bundy, sick as John Gacy
Chilling with a possible victim, she was 18
A hitchhiker hippie whore, met her at the liquor store
She frequented to help support the habit picked up in the fourth
Grade A piece of ass, so I plan on screwing it
Slipped a couple Rufilin inside the bitch's juice and gin
Next thing you know, we're on Earl's burgundy carpet
She's kicking and screaming, begging for me to fucking stop it
Look, you know it's not rape if you like it, bitch
So sit down like a pretty ho and don't fight the shit
Or else I'll have to tie a pretty bow 'round your bloody neck
Hide the slices from the gashes given with a dull Gillette
Mop the blood up, put the body in the apartment
Stash it where we hide the marijuana and the condoms
""Hey, what's that?"", don't touch it or even fucking look
You are Fantasia and the body bag's a fucking book
[Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt]
All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact
I got one in the front and two in the back
And the bitches keep screaming ""Odd Future is back""
All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact
I got one in the front and two in the back
And the bitches keep screaming ""Odd Future is back""

[Verse 3: Earl Sweatshirt & Hodgy]
Yo, Vince, let me tell you 'bout these hoes I met last night
They thought I was cute till I asked what that ass like
Damn right, red light, ran right through it
""You don't even have your permit, what the fuck are you doing?""
Well maybe if you shut the fuck up, we'd be cruising
And you wouldn't be sitting, boohooing 'bout your bruises
But, no, you wanna be Miss Fuck-with-the-Music
I'm zoning on Relapse, she's sliding on Blueprint
Three seconds it takes for her to turn blue
With my hands around her throat, her arms stopped moving
Pulse stops too, in the back, look confused
As I turn to tell 'em both not to do shit stupid
Red, white, blue lights in the rear-view, shit
Swerved to the shoulder, tell 'em both no moving
Sit down in the back 'cause the windows tinted
As I rolled down mine to forge a new friendship
""Aren't you a little too young to be driving?""
Look, officer, I'm just tryna get home
""Get out the fucking car with your license and registration""
I ain't getting outta shit, you're starting to try my patience
Didn't have backup, I could tell by the Hummingbike
Reached to the glove, grabbed the motherfucking hunting knife
Stabbed him in his neck and hip, threw him in the trunk and dipped
Back to the fucking crib for some tea and crumpets, shit
[Outro: Earl Sweatshirt]
All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull ‘em like a tutor, in fact
A dead one in the front, dead cop in the back
And two live bitches screaming ""Odd Future is back"""
Shut It Down,Drake,['r&b'],"[Part I]

[Intro: Drake]
Hey, oh-oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, say baby, I had to mention
That if you were a star, you'd be the one I'm searching for
Other girls they, they got attention
But I just always feel like they're in need of something you got
It's obvious you're pretty
Heard that you're a student working weekends in the city
Tryna take you out girl, hope you're not too busy
And if there's nothing wrong, got this little song
For you to get ready to, put those fucking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what you're doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody's taking pictures

[Chorus: Drake]
Shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) 'round (Aye) 'round (Aye)
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) 'round (Aye) 'round (Aye)
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it—
[Interlude: Drake & The-Dream]
Hey, oh-oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you
They ain't got nothing on you
They ain't got nothing on you, Ki-Killa, Killa

[Verse 2: The-Dream]
Uh, girl you the greatest
And if he say you ain't, girl he's out his mind
You the finest (Oh-whoa)
And if he say you ain't, that boy done lost his mind
Hey baby, every time you come around
Shutting it down like computers
Hey lady, step into my heart
And let me put you in them Louboutins
What you want, what you need (Yeah)
I can be (Yeah) your everything
Them other niggas just wanna hit it
But if they had it, wouldn't know what to do with it

[Chorus: Drake & The-Dream, Drake & The-Dream]
And together, we shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
They know we'd shut it down
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) round (Aye) round (Aye)
And they'd notice (They'd know) they'd notice (They'd know)
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
They know we'd shut it down
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)

TMZ, Concrete Loop
You shut that motherfucker down, down
Ice cream conversations, they all want the scoop
You shut that motherfucker down, down

[Verse 3: Drake & The-Dream]
Shooting stars all around her, fire, comets (Yes indeed)
I could bring her through and shut 'em down, Onyx
No, you're not imagining, they're looking at you long stares
Even though she's standing out she look like she belongs here
You feel the hours pass, until ya find somethin'
I feel like when she moves, the time doesn't
Yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin, and your cousin fine
But she ain't got my heart beating double time
You just shut it down girl, who told the cops where the party was?
Why do I feel like I found the one?
What's in these shots that you ordered us?
Damn, I mean you sure know how to paint a town
Ever since you came around, it's obvious—

[Chorus: The-Dream & Drake]
You shut that thing down, you shut it down
Down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You shut it down, you shut it down
Down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You shut it down, you shut it down
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) 'round (Aye) 'round (Aye)
You shut it, oh, oh

You looking good girl, go, go, go get 'em girl
Go, go, go hit 'em girl, go, go, go, go, go, go
You looking good girl, go, go, go get 'em girl
Go, go, go hit 'em girl, go, go, go, go, go, go
You shut it down
You shut it down, down, down, down, down...

[Part II]

[Verse 4: Drake]
The way I’m feeling, things I say
All just happen, when you pass my way, oh
What can I do, to make you stay?
I know it’s getting late, but girl, I don’t want you to leave
You tell me you’re just not the type, you wanna do this right
And I’m not tryna say I don’t believe you
But I refuse to feel ashamed, and if you feel the same
Does waiting really make us better people?
Take those fucking heels off, it’s worth it, girl
Nothing is what I can picture you in
So take that fucking dress off, I swear you won’t forget me
You’ll be happy that you let me

[Outro: Drake]
Lay you down, down, down
I’m tryna lay you down, down, down
You still the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
They'd notice, they'd notice
Let me lay you down, down, down
Tryna lay you down, down, down
You still the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it"
Now I Lay,Joe Budden,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","[Verse 1]
""Pump it up, you came to get it crunk
A dame and shit and drunk, you came to get it on""
That's when it all got started, I mean
Back then I wasn't so cold-hearted
With every stanza came an extravaganza
For every question he got one less answer
I was tryin' to be more than cool
Nah, it was before that, maybe boarding school
That was back when I would want to endanger myself
Maybe it was just to entertain myself
I don't need help, I could change myself
Fuck ya'll, I ain't gotta explain myself
Death's around the corner, I could hear his footsteps
Does he think that I'm the only nigga in the hood left
So tell any listener of mine, for twenty-eight years been a prisoner of the mind

[Refrain x2]
Now I lay me down to sleep, and I
I pray the Lord my soul to keep, if I
If I should die before I wake, then I
I pray the Lord my soul to take, I mean
[Verse 2]
Welcome everybody into the brain of a self-proclaimed sinner
Even when he can't win, that nigga won't surrender
Boones Farm put the wheels in motion
I felt every emotion except devotion
Message in a bottle in the bottom of the ocean
But I can't swim, dammit I can't win
So I don't care how you rate me
It'd take a long time to evaluate me
So if, this be the last time you hear me
Just know I got a loved one near me
Please don't cry, let an eye get teary
A nigga good, finally I'm somewhere care free
Past is frightening but the future's scary
And I'm, gettin' to the point that I fear me
In a class all alone, don't compare me
But I'll, blame God this is where he steered me

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
They tell me that eyes is the window to a man's soul
So what you happen to see a nigga can't control
And I turned a def ear
To anything an anybody that'll get my head clear
Why shake the dice if you never gon roll em
I told em, that the straitjacket can't hold em
I ain't psycho, don't belittle me now
It's just a title cause they couldn't figure me out
If you give a damn when shit hits the fan
Please know anything I ever did a nigga planned
Tryin' to better, high as ever
Since I learned how to lie to a lie detector, still I'm damaged
They say if you stay in that boat long enough you'll see where the land is
So I'm right where I need to be
Please believe it believe it please, let's get on our knees

Giving up my life, keeping up the faith, that's what I'll do because I'm hung up on you (Gonna give you some head!)
I'm gone knock you right up woman

I'm going to give you some head, sugar, I know what to do
I want to give you some head, ah you big fine woman
Woo, I love to give it, baby, 'cause I know just what to do with it
Ah I'm going to give the ultimate love baby, the ultimate love baby
Don't you know I can handle you
Soon, soon, soon I'll be loving you, oh Janis
You're so fine, oh how I love you"
Reservoir Dogs,JAY-Z,"['hip hop', 'alternative', 'r&b']","[Intro: Sheek Louch]
Fuck -- shit is real right here
Roc-A-Fella, LOX, taking the streets over motherfuckers
Don't get it twisted

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Yo, ayo, ayo, ayo
Yo shut the fuck up 'fore I blast and Banned From TV your ass
With no mask, look at the camera like what?
Yeah I did it, like them sick white boys the court committed
To the death of me, I spaz like I'm on Ecstasy
Drop 100 bars for real like I'm looking for a deal
If I ain't hungry, who the fuck is, I'm worse than them African kids
I ain't straight 'til my numbers match the Motorola bids
And walk the streets up in NY like I don't fucking care
If I ain't strapped that means I took 'em off my Nike Airs
Get off mine, y'all talk shit like little children
But wanna ride mine like bitches when I walk up in the building
'Cause I catch tans in the winter, with wild whores
Jet-skiing, while you keep warm at corner stores
I make it hot, flooding your block, the best way
Professionally, they'll find poison in your X-Ray
As I get roasted looking at Biggie posted on my wall
Taking shots of Louie 'til I fall
Nutting to lose, just load the clip up in the groove
And kick rhymes to the poster, 'til I swear Big moved
My team, you would think was on Thorazine
How we floss and don't give a fuck what it's cost-ing
[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
Yo, yo, pressure bust pipes, it's time to apply it now
Pick out a quiet town and tie it down
Make niggas lock it down, y'all know where to buy it now
Beanie Mack, I supply it now
My squad roll deep, in foreign cars with two seats
Couple of 5's, a 6, a few Jeeps
Bag enough coke to last a few weeks
In case niggas wanna test, vest and a few heats
You really wanna test my name? And test my game?
Until you have me, test my aim?
Y'all niggas nuts, like testicles
Hit you up in your apartment building vestibule
Perhaps it's best for you, to keep on walking
Heat from the Larkin, keep on sparking
Platinum prezzie, Bezzie, stay sparkling
Cop off the lot never see me at the auction
Pint of Bacardi darken, when it's hawking
Out on the strip, until I reach the margin
Not trying to meet the Sergeant, at the precinct
Eating cheese sandwiches, down for the weekend
Locked up with dirty white boys and Ricans

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Now if I kill you I probably do ten in the box
Come down on appeal then I'm killing your pops
You feeling The LOX, nigga, why you grilling The LOX?
If this rap shit don't work niggas still in the spot
You bring it to me, I gotta lose your family
Gangstas don't die, they get chubby, and move to Miami
Shit is deep now dog but it gets deeper
Fuck it, the weather's nice and the price is much cheaper
I put it on tape, you gon' buy it, I put it in a bag
You gon' try it, y'all niggas can't deny it
Lot of cats still trying to study my last bounce
Tell you what, get a beat tape and a half ounce
They got me where I can't be without my large gat
Teflon long sleeve, and my hardhat
Don't matter if I'm opening up, or headline
Doing the speed limit or pushing red lines
Six months in the county or fed time
I'ma be the 'Kiss nigga, until it's bedtime
Anything I'm on is a classic
Any nigga ever had beef with, son is a bastard
Anytime I spit, spit acid, L-O-X
Ruff Ryder you heard? We got the game mastered
[Interlude: Pain In Da Ass]
I told you the pain was coming
You wouldn't listen
You tried to play me like a joke?
Now who got the last laugh?
Now take these bullets with you to hell

[Verse 4: Sauce Money]
You motherfuckers is sick, don't think Sauce the shit
So many niggas on my nuts I thought I lost my dick
Picture me falling off, I'm camera shy
Hammers fly, might miss you, but your man'll die
What's the difference? Either way I'm sonning your crew
I fuck to win, y'all niggas coming to lose
Something to prove? Spit it, we can have a spray off
I lay off wack niggas and kill 'em on my day off
Ain't nutting for me to bust a trey off
Murder the whole month of April nigga, just to take May off
Run with more Germans than Adolf, you light crews
Now I concentrate on your camp, like Jews
Flow hot like a heatwave, bitch
Whips fatter than them shits they beat slaves with
I'm a mil stacking nigga who pull quick, still packing
For you Phil Jackson niggas on that Bull shit

[Verse 5: Styles P (Jay-Z)]
I don't give a FUCK who you are, so FUCK who you are
I don't care about a pretty bitch, watch or a car
I don't care about your block and whoever you shot
I don't care about your album and whenever it drop
I don't care about your past if I did I woulda asked
I'm too busy lighting 'dro with a whole lotta hash
Far as this rap shit, I'm ten steps ahead of niggas
Shooting backwards, just for practice
Ride or die nigga, hopping in your casket
'Bout to go to hell with you, blow the L with you
Tell the whole world I'm spitting, let 'em know the shells hit you
I tell niggas quick, suck dick and get a Glock
My name ring bells like Sunday at twelve o'clock
I'm half past seven, bust six then eleven
You know me, slide my man my joint say reload me
I Ruff Ryde and pop a fella for Roc-A-Fella
Screaming (what the fuck), spending mozzarella
[Verse 6: Jay-Z]
I know pop you can't stand us 'cause we cock them hammers
Run in your crib, no prisoners, pop your grandma
Locked in the slammer? Nope, popped up in Atlanta
Crossed up in a drop, I popped up the antenna
Whoa.. watch your manners when my veins pop like Scanners
Like raindrops you hear the thunder when I cock the cannon
Big thang, big chains, ain't shit changed
Get brain in the four dot six Range
Shit mayne, switch lanes
Every town I hit, switch planes, bitch, flip big 'caine
Flow with no cut, you take it in vein to the brain
Muh'fuckas is nodding and throwing up, you know that
You don't wanna owe that man
He'll hit you, get the picture? Kodak, man
Gotta, love for war, I don't floss no more
I just sit on my money 'til I'm above the law
How the fuck you gon' stop us with your measly asses?
We don't stop at the tolls, we got E-ZPasses, nigga
Multiple cars and divas with D-Classes
Iceberg sweats with I.B. on the elastic
Shit, beatch! What the fuck, ya heard me? Hahahaha
Put some more beat on that joint"

Dope shit like that, Jerm
Oh, hi
Welcome back to K.I.D.S., um
Follow your dreams
Yeah

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Wanna get a mansion, a jacuzzi
A theater to watch my movies
Couple whips and lots of fancy things
The kids they call the Goonies
I see the future, crystal ball
Mirror mirror hangin' on the wall
Who the flyest white boy of them all?
Got your girlfriend screenin' all the calls
She bubblin', we fuckin', then you cuddlin'
Like, baby, where the fuck you been?
Don't wanna tell you she in love with him
So, so we ain't sayin' nothin'
You could probably tell she bluffin'
'Cause she kiss you with the mouth
She gave me head with my concussion
Yeah, she blushin', all red
Wanna rush and go to bed
You interrogate that bitch like you the feds
So she says she in love with a rockstar, rockstar
Wanna smoke my weed, so she asks me where the tops are, tops are
[Chorus: Empire of the Sun & Mac Miller]
Oh (Top drawer, haha), oh, oh (Yeah)
Honey, I need you 'round (Haha)
I know, I know (Just some motherfuckin' kids)
Oh, oh, oh
Honey, I need you 'round (Make money, fuck bitches)
I know (Yeah), I know (Pittsburgh, hey, Jerm, hey)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
These hoes is drunk, wanna come and smoke this blunt
Then let me take 'em home and do anything I want
I said, baby, I can ride you, just let me get inside you
I can take you higher if you hit this vaporizer
I got that dope dick, I'll be your supplier
You grabbin' on my sheets and hittin' notes like you Mariah
Obsessed with me
Undress a freak on ecstasy
I'm out and then she textin' me
Like, ""What you doin' next week, next week?"" (Yeah)

[Bridge: Empire of the Sun & Mac Miller]
Hear me now
I'm down on knees and praying
Though my faith is weak
Without you so please, baby, please
Give us a chance
Make amends and I will stand up 'til the end
A million times, a trillion more (Hey)

Hey, homie
Don't be mad that your girl loves me (Don't cut anything yet)
It's not my fault (Yeah)

Going in for Life,Drake,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'blues', 'pop']","[Verse]
I don't think they really ready for my wardrobe
I show up right before the store close
And blow the fee from my last four shows
I do one song and use four flows
She used to be a Christian before
Now, all she wanna do is shop for Christian Dior clothes
Like, ""Baby, those are cute, I adore those""
Me and the salesman build a rapport so
He understand the fact that I'm spending offshore dough
Cash-only transactions, homie
And please, no receipts—the feds like to explore those
They can't audit if they dont know I bought it
Been doing it for years, homie; thoroughly, I thought it...
Through, what it do? I am currently recording on a track
Admitting most of my currency’s imported
But too late now, it's too legitimate to hit 'em with...
A lawsuit, even if those are acts that I did commit
Repeat offender, Anita Baker playing in the whip
As they pull me over, ""my sweet surrender""
I got a Jewish lawyer as my lead defender
A Menschkeit, as they say; he’s a legal bender
And ATF is present, every regal member
The coalition is so efficient
You have to be invited, or there's no admission
We know tradition, we spend money
So don't try to compete if you in no position
I wish you would listen
I take you back to this trial
Where I am about to be home again like New Edition
My foot is just solely fit for this shoe it fits in
Used to record in the basement that Renny grew his piff in
When Pops turned over keys like a new ignition
If Hov is Jordan, I guess I'm cool with Pippen
'Til I mention that I wanna play a new position
No team-playing, no screen-setting
""Because I wanna win games, Coach, I'm through assisting""
The takeover, the break's over, nigga
And I'ma keep killing 'em until the day that Drake's over
The wait's over, the tape's coming
They bullshitting, but I am equipped with great plumbing
The human mentality, so eager to hate something
And try to play it off like it ain't jumping
And it's the predicament that you found Drake in
The condo that I just purchased sound vacant
'Cause I have just been sittin' in this cell
Thinking what I could've done to make my first video groundbreaking
And whenever I'm flowing on the mic
Aside from talking 'bout the D I'm throwing in your wife
I treat this one session as if it were my last
And I pretend tomorrow is the day I'm going in for life, like that!"

Life is just a gap—get some money in between it
Glocks like police, pumps like Finas
This beat getting totaled: Pam, Keisha, Kima

Pistol on my side, paint you like a mural
Digged in my pocket, pulled out a party
Be cool 'fore you get stomped and pulled out the party

Looking for a bad bitch, I give her dinosaur dick

OK, it's Gudda, ho! All about my bills like Buffalo
Your bitch under my sheets, I heard she was an undercover ho (Ha)

Pop, pop, pop, three shots to the head, then I pick up my shell case
Leave 'em with a pale face, yes, I am a Young Money goon
Your girl like a motion picture, she gon’ be coming soon
I do her something rude, I pop her like balloons
I pass her off to Millz, then drop her off to Tune (Ha)
Couple screws loose, you don't want to play with him

We shut down every fucking spot these bitches see us in
You want us in your club? Well, nigga, pay us then

My life is all I have
My rhymes, my pen, my pad
And I done made it through the struggle, don't judge me
What you say now won't budge me
'Cause where I come from, so often
People you grew up with are layin' in a coffin
But I done made it through the pain and strife
It's my time now, my world, my life, my life

Is based on lightin' blunts, loadin' guns
Tellin' my lawyers to get the case gone
I need the bills that the presidents got they face on
So I could switch my residence
Get a truck and a Lex
Fuck a check, I no longer have to wait for 'em
I made a couple ends, lost a couple friends
I light a blunt 'cause never will the struggle end
So you could judge a nigga, but you ain't got it
You ain't in the role, so you really can't budge a nigga
You oughta love a nigga
For the fact that it's my world and my life, but still I'm a rugged nigga
They say, ""You buggin' nigga,"" fuck it, I'm a thuggin' nigga
You talkin' bullshit then kick it with another nigga

And I ain't got friends, I got enemies
So if they with me, then that means they my brother, nigga

But I done made it through the pain and strife
It's my time now, my world, my life, my life

Is a blunt to the head, a prayer for the dead
Run around hustlin', scared of the feds
They said, ""Death is eternal sleep""
But the only thing is you ain't really sure if you prepared for the bed
So often we get murked in the head, instead of big money
They got big mama hurtin' instead
My life is makin' the verse
But the handcuffs, the bullpens, the jail cells is makin' it worse
Tell mommy I don't go to the church
Tell ahk I don't go to mosque
I blow blunts, hold guns, and I'ma be right there when the soldiers'll march
I play my part and my heart seem colder than March
But on the flipside of things, it's still warmer than June
I have talks with the Lord and he'll be callin' me soon, what?
And my life is all I have
My family, my niggas, my flow, my grabs, what?

My life is all I have

Just wanna rap nice, that ain't me - tag
If you wanna be mean, then you wanna be me bad

You can't understand me nor mimic my miracles
All I see is me and I'm a mother lovin' mirror-full
Bein' dope is all in the muscle
It's more than just a pause and a chuckle
I bench press elephants, and bowlin ball juggle

But it's all caught up to me now, karma's in the waters
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
You might think it doesn't creep up on ya, but it all does
You wouldn't listen, man, I tried to warn ya when you started
Now your brain's all haunted 'cause of all the shit you thought of

No, not a-now, not a chance, not today, son

Mace in your face, bitch, cry now, pussy
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth

This must be all that there is, this must be it
Fucking-A, even got a bidet
To wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper
Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off
I can just toss a flying saucer in it, the shit's awesome
Yeah, fucking elevator
Living in a house with a fucking elevator"
Democracy,Killah Priest,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","[Canibus]
Can-I-Bus, wash off the rust
This is prophecy, I ain't just talking tough
Democracy Rules Everything Around Me, D.R.E.A.M
They put me in charge of the new Tiger Team
Illmatic, still savage, still at it
Mechanics build the rhymes, I build the mechanics
Binary language, trinary programming
To copy rap flows nowadays no challenge
Smoke don't rise in the opposite direction
Overhead projectors don't stop till perfection
Gallop over the poles, after the election
The master of impressions, like Zecharia Sitchin
Permission to get crunked up, ask the instructor
Big Brother, nigga lover, want lyrics this summer
We live in tumultuous times, I must be outta my mind
Recording rhymes like I'm soldering wires
Behind giant porcelain tigers with needle nose pliers
They told me I was hired, so I left with those buyers
My shit got less talk, but it's a bit lighter
Tell General Myers I'll fix both fighters
Situation or awareness in all areas
Knowledge is the disease we are all carriers
Of Flownitis, flow the nicest with no guidance
From the Hip-Hop - anti-virus
Sun rises, 30 arc seconds the sun spot crisis
Put fucking blisters on your iris
Ten observations per satellite
The higher masses orbit the rhyme, the faster I write
[Killah Priest]
First let's take away the planets, erase the stars
Delete everything in the solar system and the concept of God
Now it's just us standing in the darkness
I invite you to a contest, its quiet complex
You want light? Use your conscious
You want sight? Create a content
Your diction must create friction
Sparking thoughts as they listen
To enlighten someone confused
Watch it burn down to where the thoughts stems from
It's like a pen when it goes into a gun
From within, explode, then it's done
It lights like the glow of the sun
Imploding the black dot
Then explode or blow to a hole to a black spot
This friction cause a resistance
Which is the cause of all existence
These laws are Scientifics, so pay attention
The method I use, connected by tubes, digest it like food
I complexed it for fools, they can't keep the message or jewels
I left it for you, place the record on spools
Now the speed is 33 seconds per move
And rotation, that's the globe creation
Light up the whole nation as motivation
The sky had streaks of white fire
The angry cloud noise, entices the writer
Mystique alphabet, brightens his eyes up
The syllables connect, his eyes become fire
Like the Messiah, he begins to talk in a rhythm like tension
Grabbing the mic from outta the dimension
He begins spitting, split atoms
The rhythm had 'em in a trance
The rhythm enhance, his sentence advance
Till he begins to look like a lamp
His head grew incredible, impregnable
Impossible, what letters could do
It put me in a pedestal, Priest of Nazareth
I came back like Lazareth
Spread havoc with the magic gift"
Diamonds from Sierra Leone,Kanye West,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'alternative', 'jazz', 'blues', 'rock']","[Produced by Kanye West, Devo Springsteen and Jon Brion]

[Intro: Shirley Bassey]
Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me

[Chorus: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived
'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
""Does he write his own rhymes?"" Well, sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
""Damn, is he really that caught up?""
I ask, if you talkin' about classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Spoil yourself, that's important
If your stripper name ""Porsche"" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is ""Minivan""
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because—
[Chorus: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
Thirty minutes later seein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though: somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say ""Kayne""
Got family in the D, kinfolk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast, I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, you need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then, my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call; you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, ""Pssh, we messed up.""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'til we got messed up
In the studio with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question, dog: ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?""
They pray for the death of our dynasty like ""Amen""
But r-r-r-right here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands
[Chorus: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)

A Message to the Feds Sincerely We the People,Nas,['hip hop'],"[Intro]
Get ready, get prepared
This is prophecy
God is with us!

[Verse 1]
I walk the blocks like whatever god, my message to y'all feds
Who desperate to arrest us young, benevolent hardheads
Abercrombie & Fitch rockin', wrist glistenin' marksman
Hitchcock of Hip-Hop since Big Pop departed
The project logic is still salute the dead, Glocks spit
Pour some juice out for those in Manchester, Beaumount
Otisville, Lewisberg, Fort Dix, Fort Worth, Oakdale
Every fed jail where all my dawgs lurk
War hurts much to gain 'til the day we all say
May your pain be champagne then we all blaze away
At our enemies, may they die easily
Long as they perish forever's what freedom means to me
Blowin' greenery, growing eager to see evil things
Thrown away, zonin' grey, GT, Diesel jeans
Airs and Chucks, solitaires, stones with the rarest cuts
On some Pretty Tone shit, haircut looks airbrushed
And they're aware of us though
And we don't give a flyin' 747 fuck though
Stayin' on my hustle
*beat change*

[Verse 2]
A message to those who trapped us up
From federal guys who backed them up
We never will die, we black and tough
Lead in your eye, we strapped to bust
Half of us been locked up inside the beast
Look at the time we see
Brooklyn to Compton streets, Queens
Even the Congo needs dreams
Our bullets and triggers our enemies
Pullin' on innocent women and children
It wasn't no ghetto killers
Who mixed up the coke and put guns in our buildings
But I'm not gon' cry and I'm not gon' stand, just watch you die
I'ma pass you a .9, I'ma grab your hand
Come on let's ride
A message to those who killed the king
Who murdered the Christ, the same regime
What God has built, you never can break
What God has loved, you never can hate
Man makes rules and laws
You just a ruthless dog, your kennel is waiting
You devils will run back into the caves you came from
Whenever that day comes, forty acres
Plantations, see every race won
Sincerely yours, Street's Disciple, revelations"
Celebrity Remix,Lloyd Banks,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
I just touched down - Ferrari-to-concrete
I ain’t even home when they’re talking about me
Fuck out my ear if you talking about ""free""
Nigga, free don't pay the bills
I'm ballin all-out, B
These rappers don't know me
Nah, I ain’t your homey
If your name ain't Em, Ferrari or Tony
I like my wheel chromey
My Bentley, my Rolly
My Magnum, my phonie
South Jamaica shawty
These slugs I took in the gut, yo
The work's still here, I'm just cooking it up slow
Clear my mind and whipping the truck low
You’re looking for trouble
I pop death
You’re looking to a sun dawg
If rap ain't work, I be pimpin' on some ho
Still eating lobster and shrimp in the Bungalow
I'm back like crack over the drum roll
You know - wherever I go the gun go
[Hook: Akon]
We on the grind
All the time
Ain't 'bout to let a nigga come and snatch mine
I keep a nine
To see the shine
I might let your ass slide this time
While I get this paper
Cause I’m a celebrity
Ghetto-celebrity
Ain't nothing changed nigga

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
The media will test ya, popularity is pressure
Porche Panamera platinum, hammer through the metal
Wreck a booth up, I'm too tough
That inner-city grammar, step your jewels up
They bruised up, I'll sparkle for the camera
Harsh reality's what pulls them
And holding them back from opening
Verbal attack all over these niggas
Push the herd to the back
I'm the kind that they prey on
Spending half of they day on
Lay on niggas for days, the shots spray on
My sound system knock and it pound 2Pac
6 4 jumping like the ground too hot
They spot me, they chase a nigga down two blocks
Two shots in the air for niggas that ain't here
Two tone, two door, grey top, blue floor
Green guap galore, in and out of new hall
That bright light you saw was a paparazzi flash
I’m tryna snap a picture through your Maserati glass
[Hook: Akon]
We on the grind
All the time
Ain't 'bout to let a nigga come and snatch mine
I keep a nine
To see the shine
I might let your ass slide this time
While I get this paper
Cause I’m a celebrity
Ghetto-celebrity
Ain't nothing changed nigga

[Verse 3: Eminem]
There are enough insults in my head to fill up a swear jar
And have it overflowing
So don't get me going: don't dare start
You'll never see me again: Amelia Earhart
I'm popping a wheelie, off to a really unfair start
I'm past grinding, for me - guess I just be grounded up
Like Ground Round or a pound of chuck
Tightly-wound as fuck
'Til the Fire Marshalls come shut
Fire Marshall down and up
I suggest you better shut the fuck up
And stop fucking around and duck!
I ain't playing this time, I told you I'm out for blood
So to say I ""keep it 100"" would probably sound redundant
Like calling a bitch a ho or asking a gal to suck
And blow on your dick cock. Is she up to screwing? Down to fuck?
It's a man's world and I'm trapped in a land of smut
With a thousand sluts strapped and muzzled
Running through a house of mutts
In other words, I'm shutting every one of you bitches' mouths up
And I'm watching my language if I tell you to kiss my fucking butt!
And ain't shit changed, my shit still don't stink, player
My farts may have gotten staler ever since
I became a trailer park celebrity
Maybe my complexion became a little paler
Poster child for white trash
I'm a Garbage Pail Kid sailor, yeah
See me I'm all up on your bitch means I'ma rape her
All I got for these hoes is dick, duct tape and a stapler
So bitch, you better look for table scraps to scrape up
I don't subscribe to the News or the Free Press
But homie, I get the paper!
Fucking stupid"

Starchasers,Charles Hamilton,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop']","[Verse 1]
If no one understands me
Then lie and say that you do
I can make it the truth
Just buy it, save it, and use it to live
We all know I need music to live
But the beauty of it is:
You too can move your fist in the fight
Right?
All you gotta do is write
And if at all possible, we gotta move the light
Make it shine where we want it to
In front of you
I been watching the stars since the days I wasn't under roofs
The stars in the sky are the stars in the screen
A part of me believes I have a heart that doesn't beat
It's ""a capella""
My mind provides the drums
And I don't mind the dumb cause they minds gotta be numb
To not feel what I'm bringing
I might stop
If when I dream I can't see what the night's got
And I just hit the right spot
You like that?
Then come watch
[Chorus]
And you can be my starchaser tonight
Don't be afraid of how fast you go
You can see as far as lasers and lights
Close your eyes and let it all go
(Meet me in outerspace)
Let the good times roll
(I will hold you close)

[Verse 2]
Over your head like a planet
But clear like a bandage
To cover such unclear damage
What you see is what you need to believe
How ironic; I don't believe in myself, I need to get help
Crying out over the beats for myself
The smile in your eyes is nothing but lesions and whelps
But legions have felt what I bring, so that helps
Dreaming of belts
I gotta be the champ
""He's the man,"" is what they must say
What way could I give up, the 'up' way
If I give up, I show love to the sky
When you give up it's like saying ""fuck it and die""
I've had enough of the lies so catch up cause it's time
Fine
My mind will not stop ticking
It's not a clock, stop trippin'
This is a hot written
I'm the one that the stars shine for
I'm more than a leader, I'm gravity times four
So hold me down
[Chorus]
And you can be my starchaser tonight
Don't be afraid of how fast you go
You can see as far as lasers and lights
Close your eyes and let it all go
(Meet me in outerspace)
Let the good times roll
(I will hold you close)

[Verse 3]
The breeze never lies
The disease in my mind needs to recline
Chill, I will be there in time
Where is there?
Here, top of the world
I love my hair, dear
But I'm not gonna curl
If I cut my hair, it's just me comin' off of the top
Someone lost they spot
If I come across as cocky, stop me
I see, 'humble' is the new 'asshole'
Well, I guess I have the worst rap flow
Mad dough was the blessing I've recieved
Blessings are the best lessons everyone recieves
You believe, you learn
I need to learn
To believe
To give beats freezer-burn
We could turn darkness into a large kiss
From God's lips
All pink, that's some Charles shit
Aww, shit
Hehe
Hah
Charles Hamilton
[Chorus]
And you can be my starchaser tonight
Don't be afraid of how fast you go
You can see as far as lasers and lights
Close your eyes and let it all go

Gone with the tide, I'm here for the seasons
Bend yo' ass over bitch I'm here for a reason
Cold breezin', flow freezin'
This ain't spittin' ho, I'm sneezin'
Used to hit South Beach, stay at the Parisian
No fun nigga, low funds was the reason
Old school bed that the hoes got pleased in
Now them Lowes doors, is what I throw keys in
Man, talk about a come up
Niggas see me in the street they talk about 'The Come Up'
Or talk about 'The Warm Up'
Or ""Nigga, when your album drop?""
And why these lil' rappers like to run their mouth alot?
And J. Cole, are you really from the south or not?
I see your jeans, man them thangs, must have cost a lot
Aye do you get a chance to hang out with the boss a lot?
Even them hating niggas like you at the barbershop
Cole.. Yeah, that's my muhfucking name
Nigga couldn't even watch the All Star game
Had to do the whole Valentines Day thang
Gotta play the game, so my lady won't complain
Three or four days, I be back on a plane
Do a couple shows, where the people know my name
Look man, the crowd full of pretty young dames
If you gonna do dirt, then you can't leave a stain, man!
Tiger Woods y'all
He like them white girls, I like them hoods y'all
She got her head straight, she got a good job
She give the best brain, she got them good jaw
I got that good game, that's cause I'm good, y'all
And J. Cole the lil' engine that could, y'all
And yeah I'm coming for the top, like I should, y'all
And bitch I never fall off, knock on wood, y'all

High Plains Drifter,Beastie Boys,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
'Cause I'm the high plains drifter, and I'm the drifter
The high plains drifter, and I'm the drifter
They can’t catch me, they’re never going to find me
They're never gonna know that I'm the high plains drifter
Pulled over to the river, to take a rest
Pulled out a pair of pliers, pulled a bullet out of my chest
Fear and loathing 'cross the country, listenin' to my 8-track
I reached behind the seat and snatched a Kool from the pack
I'm long-distance from my girl, and I'm talking on the cellular
She said that she was sorry and I said, ""yeah, the hell you were""
Check the rear view mirror, check the gold tooth display
Check the odometer, and I was on my way

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'm the high plains drifter, the best that you can get
A strapped shoplifter, a pirate on cassette
Bust a Travis Bickle when I feel that I'm getting pushed
Don't step to me 'cause you could be getting mushed
I'm doing 120 plowing over mailboxes
Radar detector to tell me where the cops is
Spend another night at the Motel 6
It's five dollars extra to get the porno flicks
And then I concoct a black and tan in my brandy snifter
I'm a kleptomaniac K-mart shoplifter
Cash flow getting low, so I had to pull a job
I found a nice place to visit but a better place to rob
I left my car outside and the engine still revving
Takin' care of business at 7-Eleven
And then I went inside to make my withdrawal
I saw what he had had, but I had to take it all
Knucklehead deli tried to gyp me off the price
So I clocked him on the turban with a bag of ice
Cause I'm mo-lello like yo-lello, cool like lemonade
I made my getaway, and then I thought that I had it made
I feel like Steve McQueen, a former movie star
Looked in the rear view mirror, seen the police car
Ballantine quarts with the puzzle on the cap
I couldn't help to notice I was caught in a speed trap
Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry, on the run from Dirty Harry
Stash the cash in the dash, but my gun I did carry
I'm seeing blue and red flashing deep in the night
I got my alibi straight, and I pulled over to the right
The cop knocked on my window and said, ""Boy, where's the fire?""
""You got a mailbox on your bumper and a bald front tire""
""Outta the car, longhair!"" ""Your goose is cooked""
Read me my rights, fingerprinted and booked
[Verse 3]
Making like a DT, driving a Gran Fury
Wherever I hang my hat's my home, and my past is kind of blurry
Every dog will have his day, mine will be in front of a jury
High plains drifter, you know that I'm never in a hurry
Read me my rights as if I didn't know this
Threw me in the tank with a drunk called Otis
With his 5 o'clock shadow he smelled of 3-day old beer
My man turned to me and said, ""Why are you here?""
I said, ""I'm charming, I'm dashing, I'm rental-car bashing
I'm phony-paper passing at Nix Check Cashing""
I went before the judge he sent me to the Brooklyn house of D
He said, ""You behave, or we'll throw away the key""
Houdini'd out the cuffs, kicked the screw in the knee
I took the bailiff's wallet and went straight to OTB
I had a good feeling, easy come, easy go
I bet on one horse to win and your mother to show
And sure enough, that nag came in
Brought my ticket to the window and collected my win
And then I broke into my new car with a wire coat hanger
Hot-wired, hot wheeled and, ""Suzy is a headbanger"""

Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: André 3000]
Oh, yes, I love her like Egyptian
Want a description? My royal highness
So many plusses when I bust that there can’t be no minus
Went from yelling crickets and crows
Bitches and hoes to queen thangs
Over the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen thangs
Like Kilroy, chill boy because them folks might think you soft
Talking like that, man, fuck them niggas, I’m going off
And coming right back like boomerangs when you throw 'em
With these old ghetto poems, thinking it's better for 'em
When they can let they thumb down from hitchhiking
Inviting niggas into the temple they call their body
Now everybody got it, had it, talked about it amongst they friends
Coming around my crew looking Jazzy, wanna pretend
Like you Ms. Goody Four-Shoes, even Bo knew that you got poked
Like acupuncture patients
While our nation is a boat, straight sinking
I hate thinking that these the future mommas of our chill'un
They fucking a different nigga every time they get the feeling to
I’m willing to go the extra kilometer
Just to see my señorita get her pillow
On the side of my bed where no girl ever stay
House and doctor was the games we used to play
But now it’s real Jazzy Belle
[Verse 2: Big Boi]
See what if you was a playa, real playa not no flaw
Having the very best of life: lobster, steak and Perignon
Smoking an ounce of weed
And every single day was personal FreakNik
Tricking these hoes in Polo clothes, life as you conceived it
But your conception, deception, looking into your eyes
I see your weapon and it’s depressing
They're digging up in your thighs, leaving deposits
Keeping your closets open, knocking your boots and drawers
Hoping to get you sprung like bail-bonds
Steadily calling me Antwan 'cause you thinking that you my lady
Bitch, don’t play me 'cause you’re janky
I wanted to hit that ass but me and the Goodie we got danky
So thank thee, for running that Southernplayalistic game
You was the only one to blame, a nigga don’t even know yo name
It’s a shame, you cracking 'em up and fucking a nigga like 2Pac up
I’m leaving these foes to be the flowers and wake don’t get me
See, I gotta be feeding my daughter
Teach her to be that Natural Woman
'Cause you’ll be Waiting to Exhale while you other hoes be Dumb
And Dumber, yeah, you know what I’m saying

[Verse 3: André 3000]
See me and ol' girl in the black-on-black 'Lac Northstar
Windows are tinted so that no one knows who us are
Talk bad about her nigga guaranteed to snap like bra
Straps, sticking together like grandma and grandpa-pa
In this dog-eat-dog world
Kitty cats be scratching on my furry coat to curl
Up with me and my bowl of kibbles and bits
I want to hurl, 'cause most of the girls
That we was liking in high school, now they dyking
[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Having no mercy for the disrespectful ones, some
Be hanging around the crew looking for funds, dumb
Deaf and fine, they be asking me all about mine
How she doing how she be, I know she’s sipping that wine
Behind my back they squawk like vultures
Off and On like Trends of Cultures baby
Hey he faking it like these sculptured nails
But they can go to hell and lay with Lucifer
'Cause they burning anyway, Big Boi use her and abuse her

Especially Brooklyn—shout-out to the Madis

Yeah, this is how I really think

Clusterfuck of fun and enchantment
I promise you some ""generation next"" shit
Speak for the silent who are left with
Parallel levels in a dark, dark place
Tricked all you niggas to a dark, dark fate
And guided you all with a smile upon my face
As the sun kisses us on our foreheads gently
Gentle with the drugs, heavy with the love
And my speeches on stage rock mountains from a club

G4 flights, now we're off to Australia

I hope you understand what you're hearing
Take a minute to roll up for the wondrous
Clusterfuck of darkness and evil
I will paint the Yin and the Yang for you
And my jeans are Dior for the love of skinnies
Upgraded, faded aided to the T
Work hard, making sure I don't become a memory
Hard to press on when the memories remember me
And they always find the perfect moment
High speed, my momentum won't slow up none
Lost in the wind, I've lost all my friends
Maybe they were never meant to be acquainted
Money seems to make everything tainted
Everybody mad 'cause they stuck where I knew 'em last
Took what I wanted and I did it all blunted, oh oh

You can see past, if it's real to you

Depuis, trop d'faux en Karl Kani
Si y'avait plus de vrais on s'battrait pas comme des fauves en cage
J'te dis qu'mes potes guettent les chattes à la sortie des soirées, tiens la tienne serrée
Je squatte devant les boîtes, je shoot dans une boîte vide
""Rentre chez oit' si t'as pas d'thunes"" c'est c'que m'a dit l'videur
Je sais qu'j'représente bien d'où j'viens
Mais faut qu'les autres sentent bien qu'il faut pas m'lancer d'regard
Même si j'suis pas un ancien qui sont souvent ringard
J'en vois plus d'un qui s'prétendait en être un traîner des go qu'on verrait dans VideoGag
Mh, j'en vois une qu'on croirait sortie d'une vidéo d'Raggae
A plus les gars, faut qu'j'la drague

Yeah, yeah 96 fils
J'ai baissé ma garde, dressé ma droite
Déplacé mon poing sur sa face, cassé son nez
Pressé la gâchette, laissé l'ennemi
Dans le sang blessé, démuni d'énergie
Dressé une corde pour lui passer autour de son cou
Hissé son corps dans le vide
Glissé une lame dans ses intestins
Massé les hématomes, pansé les plaies, dansé sur sa tombe, décès
Tu me diras pourquoi autant de haine cousin ?
Regarde autour de toi ici tout est malsain
Le mal s'installe à chaque coin de rue
Du H.L.M. du 13ème jusqu'aux boyaux des tours de béton
Toujours les mêmes scènes : les flics entretiennent la haine
Comme les X-Men j'ai la vision, oublie tes bijoux et ton vison
Surveille ta maison, la plupart des frères perdent la raison
Que vas-tu faire ? Armageddon arrive, Armageddon arrive, fils ...

Cachez couchez vous, les MCs viennent faire coucou chez vous
Et si vous puez douchez-vous
Ici appelle moi Kevin Costner, j'danse avec les loups
Je fraye un chemin, j'écarte les ronces
Pour que mes gars puissent passer, faux casse toi
Panse tes plaies tout seul être gaulois ça m'frait pas gol-ri
Par Toutatis : Patate pour une tasse-pé qui jacte sur les miens
Jackpot ? Fils ça m'bote quand elles se prennent des claques
De ton poste tu t'aperçois que ton slip en a chié
Ça sent pas le Givenchy et t'es dans la deurm
Même si tu prends fuite : on t'piste, on t'tend des traquenards
C'qui me donne la trique, j'soulève ta go comme un crick
Même si j'ai pas de fric, c'est kif-kif j'la nique quand même

Aujourd'hui gars, faut qu'j'me fasse plus de maille je n'blague pas
Les keufs tournent comme les meufs tournent dans les caves
Condé, tu crois qu'on dénonce ? y'a pas d'balance mec
Teuchi en poche j'me fait péchos les stups' m'embarquent
C'est chaud pour moi le dépôt m'attend, quoi que j'fasse
Caillera city, notre monde à nous est pourri

Le quartier grillé faut changer d'atmosphère
Quelques jours de repos pour s'refaire une bonne santé

Si t'es pas d'Paris même c'est que tu sais qui j'suis
Tu me connais, j'suis assez bestial pour de la monnaie
Ils veulent piquer mon flouze et ils veulent me mettre les re-né
Mais non négro, jamais en galère, jamais la pénurie

Est ce toi qui cherches à savoir ? Négro viens pas m'test
D'instinct, criminel festin, lune de miel du rap

Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,Robert Frost,['country'],"Whose woods these are I think I know.
His house is in the village though;
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow.

My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year.

He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake.
The only other sound's the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake.

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep."
Who Will Survive America,Amiri Baraka,"['jazz', 'rock', 'blues', 'alternative', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","Who will survive in America?
Few Americans
Very few Negroes
No crackers at all

Will you survive in America
With your 20 cent habit?
Yo, 4-bag Jones, will you
Survive in the heat and fire
Of actual change? I doubt it

Will you survive, woman? Or will your nylon wig
Catch afire at midnight and light up Stirling Street
And your assprints on the pavement. Grease melting in this
Brother's eyes, his profile shot up by a Simba thinking
Who was coming around the corner was really Tony Curtis
And not a misguided brother, got his mind hanging out with Italians

Who will survive?
The black future will
You can't with the fat stomach between your ears
Scraping nickels out the inside of nigger daydreams
Few Americans
Very few Negroes...maybe no Red Negroes at all
The stiffbacked chalklady baptist, in blue lace
If she shrinks from blackness in front of the church
Following the wedding of the yellow robots
Will not survive. She is old anyway, and they're moving
Her church in the wind
Old people? No
Christians? No
First Negroes to be invisible to Truth, 1944, Minnesota? No
Nothing of that will be anywhere
It will be burned clean
It might sink and steam up the sea. America might
And no Americans, very few Negroes, will get out
No crackers at all
But the black man will survive America
His survival will mean the death of America
Survive Blackman! Survive Blackman! Survive Blackman!
(Black woman too)
Let us all survive, who need to OK?
And we wish each other luck!"

Malice found religion, Tony found prison
I’m just tryna find my way out this fucking kitchen
A birdseye view got me channelling my vision
Turn one to two now the kilo’s got a sibling
Father knows best, wash my hands all is forgiven
We kicking up dust like the colosseum floors
Walls full of safes like they mausoleum doors
Pussy getting wet as she walking through my morgue
Grants, Jacksons no room for George
Yeh, the Fear of God’s in you muthafuckers
This art imitate my life
You WorldStarHipHop fame based off imitation hype
Eliminate the fools gold and imitation ice
My music for your soul, inspiration for your life
Every dime made in his life more disastrous
Help my young bitch see her way through her Bachelor's
Sent my old bitch right back to get her Masters
Same graduation I was clapping in the rafters
The truth hurts everytime it’s revealed
What goes around comes around, this is lifes ferris wheel
Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel as I parrallel park
Kentucky derby on the grill
The fact that I’m free lets me know God is great
Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate
These rappers talk crowns but I’d rather talk fear
Villian like candyman, say my name and I’ll appear
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Hakuna matata, feet up sipping java
Strolling up the totem poll, what’s my only problem
Scrolling through my Rolodex, who shall bear my toddler
So many hands raised as the band plays
I’m here now, watch how many nigga's plans change
[Kanye West]
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin’ for the love of ballin’
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it’s random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative
And sold your dreams, you don’t know who did it
I treat the cash, the way the government treats aids
I won’t be satisfied til all my niggas get it
I need more drinks and more lights
Hot American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
Told to take them glasses off and get in the pool
It’s been a while since I watched the tube
Its like a crip said: “I got way too many blues for any more bad news”
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I don’t believe in yesterday
What’s a black Beatle anyway, a fucking roach
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
But God said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I’m sniffing coke
It ain't funny anymore try different jokes
Tell ‘em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I’m got it
Play strings for the dramatic
And end all of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I’m going after whoever who has it
I’m coming after whoever. Who has it?
You blowing up, that’s good, fantastic
That y’all, its like that ya’ll
I don’t really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls
[Pusha T]
Uh, I let you into my diary to admire me
The making of this man, I let you see the higher me
The self righteous drug dealer dichotomy
I’m drawing from both sides, I’m Siamese
The tug of war opens the door, entrada
Rip me apart and see what’s inside this pinata
And rolling kilos in gymstrada is one saga
One chapter of black magic, I’m Harold Potter
Feels like I’m doomed to dealing with women whom
Relationships with their fathers won’t allow us to bloom
And blossom, I swear this Vegas nights was awesome
But adios I blow my own dice before I toss ‘em, loss ‘em
Some other muthafuckers double crossed ‘em
Tryna snatch my nigga back I blew a small fortune
Russell with the work, we was like the four horsemen
Rick Flair with the flame, I’m muthfucking Gorgeous, wooooooooo
As the gull wing doors lift, Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smtih
Whiter than the coke brush that they paint me with
Sunk leather seats softer than an angels kiss
But the devil red, tires double tread
I’m posting parks up. that gets me double head
Tight rope walking tryna keep a level head
The bright lights blind look what the devil did
Yeah
[Kanye West]
It’s hip hop, this is euphemism for a new religion
The soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing to attention
As long as I’m in Polo’s they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever saw a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn’t sack me
If a nigga ain't running shootin a jump shot running a track meet
But this pimp is, on the top of mount Olympus
Ready for the World’s game, this is my Olympics
We make ‘em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
And I assisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, fans can't resist it
Remember, remind of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever one of the greatest homie, I must have missed it!"
Comment 1,Gil Scott-Heron,['r&b'],"Poem here says, Comment #1
Uh, Comment #2 is dynamite
But Comment #1 is the one we decided
To use here this evening
Because it makes a comment if you listen
Closely on what is now being advertised
In East Harlem as the ""Rainbow Conspiracy"" - a combination of
The Students For A Democratic Society
The Black Panthers, and the Young Lords
And this is my particular comment about that conspiracy, ""Comment #1"":

The time is in the street you know
Us living as we do upside down
And the new word to have is revolution
People don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel
Because God's hole card has been thoroughly piqued
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
The youngsters who were programmed
To continue fucking up woke up one night
Digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys. America stripped
For bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes. The signs of Truth
Were tattooed across our often-entered vagina
We learned to our amazement untold tale of scandal
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault
Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
America was a bastard the illegitimate daughter
Of the mother country whose legs
Were then spread around the world
And a rapist known as freedom: free doom
Democracy, liberty, and justice were
Revolutionary code names that preceded
The bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling
Bubbling in the mother country's crotch
And behold a baby girl was born
Nurtured by slave holders and whitey racists
It grew and grew and grew screwing
Indiscriminately like mother, like daughter
Everything unplagued by her madame mother
The present mocks us, good Black people
With keen memories set fire to the bastards
Who ask us in a whisper to melt and integrate
Young, very young, teeny
Bopping revolt on weekend young dig
By proxy what a mental ass kicking
They receive through institutionalized everything
And vomit up slogans to stay out of Vietnam
They seek to hide their relationship with the world's prostitute
Alienating themselves from everything
Except dirt and money with long hair, grime, and dope
To camo-hide the things that cannot be hidden
They become runaway children to walk the streets downtown with everyday
Black people sitting on the curb
Crying because we know that they will go back
Home with a clear conscience and a college degree
The irony of it all, of course
Is when a pale face SDS motherfucker dares
Look hurt when I tell him to go find his own revolution
He wonders why I tell him that America's revolution
Will not be the melting pot but the toilet bowl
He is fighting for legalized smoke, or lower voting age
Less lip from his generation gap and fucking in the street
Where is my parallel to that?
All I want is a good home and a wife and a children
And some food to feed them every night
Back goes pale face to basics
Does Little Orphan Annie have a natural?
Do Sluggo's kinks make him a refugee from Mandingo?
What does Webster's say about soul?
I say you silly trite motherfucker, your great grandfather
Tied a ball and chain to my balls
And bounced me through a cotton field
While I lived in an unflushable toilet bowl
And now you want me to help you overthrow what?
The only Truth that can be delivered to a four year
Revolutionary with a hole card i.e. skin is this:
Fuck up what you can in the name of
Piggy Wallace, Dickless Nixon, and Spiro Agnew
Leave brother Cleaver and Brother Malcolm alone please
After all is said and done build a new route to China if they'll have you
Who will survive in America?"

My Melody,Eric B. & Rakim,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative']","[Verse 1]
Turn up the bass, check out my melody, hand out a cigar
I'm letting knowledge be born and my name's the R
A-K-I-M not like the rest of them, I'm not on a list
That's what I'm saying, I drop science like a scientist
My melody's in a code, the very next episode
Has the mic often distorting, ready to explode
I keep the mic at Fahrenheit, freeze emcees then make 'em colder
The listener's system is kickin' like solar
As I memorize, advertise like a poet
Keep you going when I'm flowing, smooth enough, you know it
But rough, that's why the mural on my story I tell will be
Nobody beats the R, check out my melody

[Verse 2]
So what, I'm a microphone fiend, addicted soon as I seen
One of these four emcees so they don't have to scream
I couldn't wait to take the mic, blow into it to test
Then let my melody play, then the record suggest
That I'm dropping bombs, but I stay peace and calm
Any MC that disagree with me, wave your arm
And I'll break, when I'm through breaking, I'll leave you broke
Drop the mic when I'm finished and watch it smoke
So stand back, you wanna rap, all of that can wait
I won't push, I won't beat around the bush
I wanna break upon those who are not supposed to
You might try but you can't get close to
Because I'm number one, competition is none
I'm measured with the heat that's made by Sun
Whether playing ball or bobbing in the hall
Or just writing my name in graffiti on the wall
They shouldn't have told me you said you control me
So now a contest is what you owe me
Pull out your money, pull out your cut
Pull up a chair, and I'ma tear shit up
My name is Rakim Allah, and R and A stands for ""Ra""
Switch it around, it still comes out ""R""
So easily will I E-M-C-E-E
A repetition of words, just check out my melody
Some bass and treble is moist, scratching and cutting a voice
And when it's mine that's when the rhyme is always choice
I wouldn't have came to set my name and run the same weak shit
Putting blurs and slurs and words that don't fit in a rhyme
Why waste time on the microphone
I take this more serious than just a poem
Rock from party to party, backyard to yard
Now tear it up, y'all, and bless the mic for the gods
[Verse 3]
The rhyme is rugged, at the same time sharp
I can swing off anything even a string of a harp
Just turn it on and start rocking, mind no introduction
'Til I finish dropping science, no interruption
When I approach, I exercise like a coach
Using a melody and add numerous notes
And with the mic and the R-A-K-I-M
It's attached, like a match, I will strike again
Rhymes are poetically kept and alphabetically stepped
Put in a order to proceed with the momentum, except
I say one rhyme out of order, a longer rhyme shorter
Or pause, but don't stop the tape recorder

[Verse 4]
I'm not a regular competitor, first rhyme editor
Melody arranger, poet et cetera
Extra events, the grand finale like bonus
I am the man they call the microphonist
With wisdom, which means wise words being spoken
Too many at one time, watch the mic start smoking
I came to express the rap I manifest
Stand in my way, and I'll veto all the word's protest
Emcees that wanna be best, they're gonna
Be dissed if they don't get from in front of
All they can go get is me a glass of Moet
A hard time, sip your juice and watch a smooth poet
I take seven emcees put 'em in a line
And add seven more brothers who think they can rhyme
Well, it'll take seven more before I go for mine
Now that's twenty-one emcees ate up at the same time
Easy does it, do it easy, that's what I'm doing
No fessing, no messing around, no chewing
No robbing or buying, biting—why borrow?
This slob will stop trying, fighting to follow
My unusual style will confuse you a while
If I was water, I'd flow in the Nile
So many rhymes, you won't have time to go for yours
Just because of applause, I have to pause
Right after tonight is when I prepare
To catch another sucker duck emcee out there
'Cause my strategy has to be tragedy, catastrophe
And after this you'll call me your majesty
My melody
[Verse 5]
Marley Marl synthesized it, I memorized it
Eric B. made a cut and advertised it
My melody's created for emcees in the place
They try to listen 'cause I'm dissin' them, so pick up your face
Shook off your neck as you try to detect my pace
Now you're druggin', almost buggin' off my rhyme, like bass
The melody that I'm styling, smooth as a violin
Rough enough to break New York from Long Island
My wisdom is swift, no matter if
My momentum is slow, emcees still stand stiff
I'm genuine like leather, inclined to be clever
Emcees you beat the R, I'll say ""oh never""
So Eric B. cut it easily and
Check out my melody"

Uh, what time is it, huh? check my French (My French)
If you got my shit, you better check my French (Motherfucker!)
I'm making moves, sh— check my French (My French)
I speak English, but check my French (My French)
Your ho be on my penis, she check my French
Bitch!
[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator & Hodgy]
I guess I left my dignity up in the cupboard
'Cause every girl I'm digging
When I'm digging in her pussy, I'm never using (A rubber)
But fuck it, I guess I gotta stretch it out like it was flubber
And leave it dripping green and red like double cheeseburgers
Chewing on cum like bubblegum from Hubba
This bitch knew dick like Bubba knew shrimp (Hahahaha)
Yeah
Yo, I'm seventeen, already sniffing blow
I tell my friends it's asthma every time I start to itch my throat
I got a new show for MTV: ""Pimp My Boat""
Because some bitch said my semen was dirty, that silly ho
The most that they can do is fine me
I'm hiding, somewhere where Chris Stokes can't find me
""Oh no, Mr. Stokes, I don't like misters, no""
Don't tell R. Kelly where my little sister go

[Verse 3: Hodgy]
Yo, you little niggas better check my French
I got all-stars, and you can check my bench
Left Brain, Super 3, Creator Ace
Put expressions in the music and create the face
Of the picture—punchline, figured out, ""Ahh, I get you""
No, you don't, nigga, so why don't you go'n' figure?
You seem confused anyway, pressured enough?
You the type to do the choke when the pressure is up
The pressure is the pump, and the pressure is us
Bitches having eargasms, and the pleasure is us
Niggas wanna be O.F. and write letters to us
Competition's competition, yo, you better than us?
Digest what I'm saying? I don't think so
We sick shit, throw it up down in the sink, yo
These Odd niggas are beginning to spill these pink flows
We think sorta odd, so we think so

[Verse 4: Tyler, the Creator]
Crusing in my go-kart at Walmart selling cupcakes
Go 'head, admit it, faggot, this shit is tighter than butt rape
That involve Ballpark Franks and silver duct tape
Pornos, some hormones, and boxes of DiGiorno
You homos is loco, you probably drinking Cuervo
With some vatos, with the door closed, watching ""Zorro""
You homos
[Outro: Tyler, the Creator & Dr. TC]
O.F.
Yes
So, are you dating anyone right now? You know, or...
No, I'm— I'm just playing the field, just for now

My name like honey, got a lot of bitches buzzin'
The neck of the barrel so long and narrow
And it shoot a bunch, you just lunch and it munch, like Pharoahe
Bloodshot eyes on the sparrow
And I stay high, but on point like an arrow
Street nigga, baby, I'm in love with the gravel
Money gives me life, like a man with a gavel

I pop my trunk and made them bitches spread like cattle

Understand, I'm tryna get the chips and the dip
Better know I hold that gun with a Panther grip
My hollow bullets got tips like a dancer bitch
Where my money? Where my money? Need to answer quick
Gotta get back up on my ransom shit
And put you (In the trunk), so you lay on top of speakers
Holes all in you like an old pair of sneakers
Before I do a day on the edge, I will leap first
Bet you any money that I will land feet-first
Married to the Benjamins, battle all my enemies
Riding with Bigfoot, Harry and the Hendersons
Godzilla, King Kong, and if I have to park
I will open up my trunk, and it will be Jurassic Park

Oh, written in the stars
A million miles away, a message to the main, oh
Seasons come and go, but I will never change
And I’m on my way
(Let's go!)

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, you’re listening now
They say they ain't heard nothing like this in a while
That's why they play my song on so many different dials
Cause I got more fuckin' hits than a disciplined child
So when they see me everybody brrrap, brrraps
Man I’m like a young gun fully black Barack
I cried teardrops over the Massive Attack
I only make hits like I work with a racquet and bat
Look at my jacket and hat, so damn berserk
So down to earth, I’m bringing gravity back
Adopted by the major, I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed
Look, I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malorie Blackman
(Where the hell's all the sanity at?) Damn
I used to be the kid that no one cared about
That's why you have to keep screaming 'til they hear you out

Oh, oh, oh, oh  (oh)

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, I needed a change, when we ate, we never tipped
Because we needed the change, I needed a break
For a sec, I even gave up believing and praying
I even done illegal stuff and was leaded astray
They say that money is the root to the evilist ways
But have you ever been so hungry, it keeps you awake?
Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed, great
It feels like a long time coming, fam
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream, I tried to chase it
But I wasn’t going nowhere, running man
I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Tryna change a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyone's a kid that no one cares about
You just gotta keep screaming until they hear you out

Oh, written in the stars
A million miles away, a message to the main, oh

Fight Music,D12,['hip hop'],"[Chorus: Eminem]
This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit for these kids to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass-confusion
And drastic movement of people actin' stupid

[Verse 1: Kon Artis]
I come to every club with intention to do harm
With a prosthetic arm and smellin' like Boone's Farm
Hidin' under tables as soon as I hear alarms
Paranoid thief that'll steal from his own mom
Kunivin' Kon Artis with a bomb
Strapped to my stomach, screamin', ""Let's get it on!""
A lush that love to drink, drunk-drivin' a tank
Rollin' over a bank, cops see me and faint
It's drastic, I'm past my limit of coke
I think I'll up my high by slittin' your throat
Push your baby carriage into the street 'til it's mince meat
Your mens been beat the minute I step onto your street
This is fight music
[Verse 2: Bizarre]
You know why my hands are so numb? (No?)
'Cause my grandmother sucked my dick and I didn't cum
(Oh) Smacked this whore for talkin' crap
So what if she's handicapped?
The bitch said Bizarre couldn't rap
I fuckin' hate you, I'll take your drawers down and rape you
While Dr. Dre videotapes you (Hell yeah!)
Satan done got me on this song, eatin' a hot dog
Readin' the Holy Qur'an while I'm on the john
Tired of wearin' this yellow thong
Take it back, Sisqo, you know where it belongs
Now, here's a gun, I'll put it in your palm
Now go over there and blow up Dru Hill's arms
Fuck the love songs!

[Chorus: Eminem]
This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit for these kids to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass-confusion
And drastic movement of people actin' stupid
[Verse 3: Proof]
Just bring who you gon' bring on
Who you gon' swing on
I'm King Kong, guns blow you to kingdom-come
Show you machine gun funk
Sixteen M16's, one pump
The snub in my paw, shove it in your jaws
Have you runnin' out this fuckin' club in your drawers
We lovin' the brawls; there's nothin' to applaud
But fuck it, it's all good
The hood is up in us all; it's fight music

[Verse 4: Swifty McVay & Eminem]
I'm a nigga that loves scuffles
And won't hesitate to sock you again with swollen knuckles
I'm like that, catch a nigga like bear traps
Blow his head back
Right in front of the precinct (You hear that?)
I slap your freak, bump you and won't speak
If you step on my feet, you get drowned in your own drink
I suffocated my shrink just for talkin'
Came back and fucked up his pallbearers
And made them drop his coffin; it's fight music

[Verse 5: Kuniva]
These beads I'm swingin' is stingin' them
See all these niggas?
When I step in the club I'm bringin' them
If any nigga lookin' too hard, we Rodney King'n them
Malice Greening them
And gasolinin' them with premium
Light a cigarette, flick it at 'em, or spit it at 'em
Hold up a picture of his family and kick it at him
Blast while you right-hookin', right when your wife's lookin'
Fuck fight music, bitch, this is losing-your-life music
[Verse 6: Eminem]
If I could capture the rage of today's youth and bottle it
Crush the glass with my bare hands and swallow it
And spit it back in the faces of you racists
And hypocrites who think the same shit but don't say shit
You Liberaces, Versaces, and you Nazis
Watch me, 'cause you figured you got me in this hot seat
You motherfuckers wanna judge me 'cause you're not me
You'll never stop me, I'm top speed and you pop me
I came to save these new generations of babies
From parents who failed to raise them 'cause they're lazy
To grow to praise me, I'm makin' them go crazy
That's how I got this whole nation to embrace me
And you fugazi if you think I'ma admit wrong
I cripple any hypocritic critic I'm sicked on
And this song is for any kid who gets picked on
A sick song to retaliate to, and it's called—

[Chorus: Eminem]
This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit for these kids to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass-confusion
And drastic movement of people actin' stupid
It's fight music"

What if Arnold woulda just let Tookie get Life?
What if BIG missed the party?
What if Pac missed the fight?
What if you was caged in?
What would you change then?
What if there was no Rockefeller law for made men?
What if the hate ran through me?
And what if Portland woulda drafted Jordan instead of Sam Bowie?
What if you really had to be nice to get a deal?
What if all of these rappers ice was really real?
What if I hit you wit the razor from cheek to chin?
What if Mike Jackson never woulda bleached his skin?

I pull my hoodie down and take a look around
Sounds that shook a town, man, it feel good to smile
So I shouldn't frown when the night is lookin' down
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who the smoothest crook around?
Takin' some dollars and makin' away from Impalas
Shakin' the Jakes 'cause they chasin' the face of a robber
Actin' goofy, absolutely
'Cause my passion suits me, so blast the tunes, please
I see the world with four eyes, hip-hop tour guide
Hear the war cries, rap or die
Wanna get signed, drive a four-door ride
Be more fly, 'til then I'll just soar by with a wave
I'm a bat in the cave
Sit back in the shade when I'm passin' the haze
Misbehave, I'm a trouble-makin' teenager
[?] to please haters
Seat taker, three-term mayor
Gettin' re-elected just three terms later, uh
I've seen greater days, so let the haters play their game
Dreams fade away when you make the predator the prey
The ace of spades can make it's way to save the day
But from the start a club of heart was diamond
Now I'm in Zion flyin' through the skyline
The game on my back, I got five spines
Black cat with nine lives, time flies by
So I got one life to lose it, but how will I use it? Uh
I put it all in the music, 'cause y'all pussy
Fold away before they hand you cards
Broke-ass rapper, now you dancin' with the stars
I'm handlin' these bars like a simple situation
Bassin' on them cats who don't fit in the equation
Patience is a virtue, but fuck it, I want it now
Get my record deal ready, get Diddy up on the dial
Hello. what's up, Puffy? I'm on my grind and hungry
Throw me to the people, they gon' love me, trust me, ha
'Cause these older cats is gettin' a little rusty
It's time for a change like Barack said
And I don't care, hip-hop is not dead
Spit hot lead, but none of these haters get shot dead
They don't bother me, I'll even play 'em for my wife
Kick back, have a laugh while you complain about your life
Grr, you hate Mac and you say you gon' fight
It's all good, bro, you entertainment for tonight
Like I'ma be mad you hatin' 'cause I'm white
Do a lot of cryin', lettin' pain out on the mic
'Cause overall I'm iller than most of y'all, y'all pussy
Never ever goin' for it all, you scared of a little risky coachin' call
What happened? I thought you was a know-it-all?
I stay smokin' well, haze got a potent smell
It take me back to kickin' raps back in show-and-tell
I wanted to show people, all of my bro's peoples
Have a dude come up like ""Yo, I know people""
The need for Dead Presidents, this dough evil
So lethal, police'll always try to beat you
Seat you down, try and have you run your mouth
Bring your mother out, ""Look what your son is now,"" haha
See, my mom, she know her son is well
The youngest child, she been through it for a while
9-1-1 on the dial with a smile
'Cause I'm wild, foul child style, haha
Too focused on my grind to ever catch an ""F""
My heart in it, down eight with five seconds left
I want the best, won't settle for nothin' less
And I always stay dressed in somethin' fresh
So keep your head on straight and show respect to the game

Let me tell you what a dime is
She make me, wanna tear it apart and eat it up like she was prime ribs
She knows just how to grind it
Make them boys lose it and I know just how to find it
Cupid said I'm stupid cause I show you where my mind is
Heads up, shawty lift your legs up
Oh, Oh I'm nasty, I'm nasty
Don't you be appalled shawty I got what your ass need?
Just kiddin I ain't tryna be inconsiderate
But next time you bring your girls with you, consider this

Before Im Gone,J. Cole,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
I hit the weed, I told myself the last time would be my last
I don’t trust my own niggas, now my mind racing fast
Got my foot up on the gas, got a hundred on the dash
If the police run up on me, I ain't stopping for they ass
Boy, you know my L's dirty, if they stop me, I'm goin' to jail surely
I’ll be next to my brother in the cell, no bail for me
""Man, let me out, send me back to bitches that smell purdy""
And all I gotta do is call once and she there all ready
Yeah, buddy, can't you tell I'm goin' through hell?
I don’t even open my mail
I’m in the shower with a soap and the towel, I need cleansing
Bad bitches all on the prowl they need Benzes
Pussy niggas running they mouth and we ain't flinching
They names ain't even mentioned
I got dreams bigger than your whole team
You niggas so broke yet somehow you so green
I guess it's envy, started with a penny now I’m getting plenty money

[Chorus]
Huh, and one time for the city, yeah
And two times for you, hey
And one time for the city, hey
And two times for you, uhh
[Verse 2]
Look kid, it's raining outside boy, fuck an umbrella
Niggas banging outside boy, they guns'll dumbbell a nigga
Tired of telling niggas that's deceased ""Rest in Peace""
We tired of only having just a piece
And fuck policing, they killing niggas, what's the reason?
His daughter starving and she fucking freezing
So no wonder why he fucking squeezing
They out here bussin', leavin' niggas stuck and bleedin' on the flo'
Bullets wet you like a semen on a ho
Breathing slow man, I'm in hell
One day you tryna make rent, next day you in jail
Lord knows he meant well
So I take the pencil and write like a pen pal
Some shit that’s darker than the tints up on the windshield
Uh, welcome to Sinville where niggas on base
Shit is looking like an infield, high as a Sprint bill
What you think? That's the reason why this ink in my pen kills
Phony niggas until they are extinct, bitch I’ve been real

[Chorus]
Huh, and one time for the city, hey, uh
And two times for you, yeah
And one time for the city, hey, hm
And two times for you, hey
[Verse 3]
Them old niggas sayin', ""Cole the wrong one bringin' the city shine
All he ever doin’ is paintin' pictures of crime
Tellin' stories of pain, paintin' pictures of dope""
Bitch if you listenin', I'm paintin’ pictures of hope, huh
That boy in class embarrassed because he broke
Hopin’ today he won’t be the butt of somebody’s joke
See me I lived it all from dirt-poor in a trailer
Worried about my mother and never trustin' my neighbors
To middle-class with a backyard and my own room
To bein’ the only black kid in my homeroom
Academically gifted and followed my own rules
Was runnin' the streets, hey ma, I’ll be home soon
Was out chasin' hoes, was out hoopin'
Them niggas wasn't ballin' but yet they was foul shootin', uh
So meet the newest role model who don't know how to fake this shit
Never sold a rock and look, I made it bitch

[Chorus]
Huh, and one time for the city, yeah
And two times for you, hey
And one time for the city, yeah
And two times for you, hey

[Outro]
Girl it's been so long, I've been gone from you
But you ain't gotta worry 'bout the thangs I do
It's hard but the thought of you would ease my pain
Girl I promise they gon' know our name, uh
Ain’t seen you smile in a while
But I been dreamin' 'bout you

Shit Can Happen,D12,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop']","[Intro: Rondell Beene, Eminem & Kon Artis]
Bitch
Yeah
Shit can happen, shit can happen
Shit can happen, shit can happen
Shit can happen, shit can happen
Shit can happen, shit can happen

[Verse 1: Kon Artis]
That's right motherfuckers, we back
Same slanging, orangatanging, wilding out on hoodrats
They say I act like I'm too famous to say ""Hi""
And tell 'em what my name is but really I'm still nameless
You niggas don't get it yet, do you?
Deal or not, platinum or flop, I still put it through you
With a Luger that'll spit fire
And hit higher than a pitch by a bitch like Mariah
You think for one second since we got a deal
That we won't deal wit you in front of St. Andrew's still?
You gay rappers better learn that
I won't stop until I see 'em turn back
If you don't slow that roll you got
You gon' see these Runyon Ave. niggas that really need some Prozac
Fo' sho' that, ask the others, Brigade'll lay you down
Next to your mother's mother's grandmother
[Verse 2: Kuniva]
You know I'm feeling real rowdy tonight, ready to fight
And half the niggas I give dap to I don't even like
The same cat who never gave a damn about your name
I gives a fuck about it like the next L.A. Clippers' game (Bitch)
I kill you in ways you couldn't even fathom (Punk)
You and your madame, it's really unexplainable how I have 'em
Who call theyself screaming about a challenge (What?)
Nigga we got a gift while you barely making it off mere talent
My skills are deeply embedded even your ho said it (Uh-huh)
She was knock kneed, I fucked her, now she's bow-legged
In the middle of rapping I drop the mic (What?)
And have a stare down and jump in the crowd and start scrapping (Bitch)
Kuniv' and Kon Artis, my nigga we get it cracking
While the paramedics pick you up we on the side laughing

[Chorus: Kon Artis]
Now this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Shit can happen to him and yo' ass
You can be touched, don't think you can't
'Cause niggas ain't fuckin around no more man
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Shit can happen to him and yo' ass
You can be touched, don't think you can't
'Cause niggas ain't fuckin around no more man
[Verse 3: Swifty McVay]
The feds can't hold me, I hold feds
I was born with a dark ass cloud over my head
Raining acid, you can't refrain from getting yo' ass kicked
'Cause you talk too much, you asked for it
I'm on some massive shit, everybody ignore me
They wouldn't fuck with me if I was performing at an orgy
These niggas get confronted (Wha tup now?)
Then they change stories
I cut you and they thinking everything's hunky dory
I even have you pouring me the gasoline for me
Pulling up slowly, cocktailing your homie
You met a lot of niggas but you wouldn't wanna know me (For real)
Yo' ass might not even make it home wit' your Rollie
Don't even try, in your system like E. coli
Trying to beef with me, nigga please, yo' people die
I'm so wicked that my mama gave birth illegally
I survived the abortion immediately, surprise

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Picture me sitting in a jail cell rotting (Shit)
Or barricaded in a motel with twelve shotguns
So when the cops come knocking each hand's got one
Cocked, ready to dump slugs heavy as shotputs
One man army, guns can't harm me
Young and ornery, worse than my Uncle Ronnie
Ever since I got my first gun pulled on me
I can't stop airing out my dirty laundry
Middle fingers flipped at censorship
Your friends just flipped over the swift penmanship
Ever since I spit some shit on Infinite
I've been giving it 110%
'Cause when I vent, most of my energy's spent on enemies
80% of what I invent is Hennessey
20% is from being hungry as sin
10's because I love being under your skin, shit
Yeah, shit can happen so stick to rapping
Quit the yapping or I'ma lift the MAC and
That can lead to another mishap happening
Skip the crap get the can of whoopass cracking
[Chorus: Kon Artis]
Now this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Shit can happen to him and yo' ass
You can be touched, don't think you can't
'Cause niggas ain't fuckin around no more man
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Shit can happen to him and yo' ass
You can be touched, don't think you can't
'Cause niggas ain't fuckin around no more man

[Outro: Eminem]
It can and it will (Nigga, nigga)
Fuck around with Amityville and you die
Insanity spills from the mentality of twelve motherfuckers
In six different bodies with their personalities split
Fucking you up with hit after hit
Sticking you up with clip after clip
Making you suck dick after dick
Dirty motherfucking dozen
The Kon Artis, motherfucking Peter S. Bizarre
Swifty MC Vay, the Kuniva, Dirty father-fucking Harry
Putting you down in a cemetery, you get buried
All you of you motherfuckers suck our motherfucking cocks
We are not playing, we are not playing
We are not bullshitting, this is not a motherfucking joke
All of you motherfuckers get smoked"
Revelation,D12,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop']","[Hook: Eminem]
I don't wanna go to school, I don't need no education!
(We don't need no education)
I don't wanna be like you, I don't wanna save the nation! (daddy no!)
I just wanna live my life, every day a celebration!
(We don't need no thought control)
One day I'mma leave this world, I'm waiting for the revelation!

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
I wanna kill myself! I'm still debating
In front of a Baptist church masturbating, praying to Satan
Think I'm crazy 'cause I smoke crack
Live on B with the mac in a two family flat (fuck it)
Tired of getting hit in the face with a broom
My moms on her period, my dad's in my room (Daddy no!)
I got ten rocks and I need to get out
I sold them in five minutes, at my own damn house (Moms smoke crack)
My poor grandmother, God bless her soul
The bitch got AIDS (aww) she just waiting to die of a cold (hahaha)
There's three things that keep me from being a Nazi:
I'm black, a fag, and my dad's Liberace
[Verse 2: Kon Artis]
No matter how bad the beating, I went to school cheating
My dad whooped my ass at a PTA meeting
Skipping school I had to have nuts just to do it
Got bored and became truant
When I had the gall to go I just couldn't do it
I was lured into corners by the peer pressure shit
How would you feel if you was held by the tip of a barrel
Getting threatened to get your skin ripped to bone marrow
Bet suburban kids never got rushed for their apparel
Like me, outcast, last to class
First to leave, when the teacher called on me
Best believe I had something up my sleeve

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I've been praised and labeled as crazed
My mother was unable to raise me, full of crazy rage
An angry teenager, nothing can change me back
Gangsta rap made me act like a maniac
I was boosting, so influenced by music I used it
As an excuse to do shit, ooh I was stupid
No one can tell me nothing hip-hop overwhelmed me
To the point where it had me in a whole 'nother realm
It was like isolating myself was healthy
It felt like we was on welfare but wealthy
Compelled me to excel when school had failed me
Expelled me and when the principal would tell me
I was nothing, and I wouldn't amount to shit
I made my first million and counted it
Now look at, a fucking drop-out that quit
Stupid as shit, rich as fuck, and proud of it
That's why
[Hook: Eminem]
I don't wanna go to school, I don't need no education!

One day I'mma leave this world, I'm waiting for the revelation!

[Verse 4: Swifty McVay]
I was raised with a rifle and mask
Steadily beating my psychiatrist's ass just for asking about my past
(bitch) I was never on that punk shit; fucking around
Can get your beloved abducted, smothered in blood quick
You couldn't pay Swift to give a fuck
Was crazy like my father, it must've been poison in that nigga's nut
Far as probation, fuck peeing in cups
I violate at any time, let them see the blunt
I grew up steadily masturbating inside of cells
Young as hell, having conversations with myself
You could tell I wasn't lenient, a disobedient
Lynched and slapped teachers, bitch I'm not reading it
You don't know what dogs go through, a little nigga
Sipping liquor with my old dude, what the fuck you gon' do?
I'm quick to curse you, I told my mother that I'mma hurt you
If you ever again mention that curfew
[Verse 5: Kuniva]
Look, my family ignores me and I don't like that
They don't even listen when I tell them I'll be right back
(Yeah whatever) This nice beautiful house ma, it don't mean shit
Cause you know daddy's a drunk and he don't clean shit
And yesterday he hit me like a grown fucking man
I couldn't stand up to him, I just ducked and ran
I'm sick of this, I wish on Christmas
That I can get a loaded four-fifth and put a fucking end to this
(Fuck it) I got no friends and I can't get a bitch
Only thing I have is dirty magazines and sticky fingertips
Nothing to smile about, I'm about to lose my mind
Got me an automatic nine, now I'm wilding out

[Verse 6: Proof]
When school's over, pu-pil are people to shoot through
Kids going cuckoo, with a two-two
Since my friend is this new dude, in this high school
Losing his noodle learn that people don't like you
The football jocks is, spitting on him
Popular kids in school is now picking on him
Burn out youngster niggas now hitting on him
And his teacher in his english class keep flipping on him
And now he's grounded with no allowances
For drinking forty ounces, 'cause he was caught by his counselors
And why the fuck I gotta ride the bench coach?
Already got expelled for wearing a trench coat
All I ever seen is... (Violence, violence...)
Told me to keep silent, stop battin' my eyelids
It's apparent that my parents weren't parents at all
That's why I blow out my brains and slaughter you all (Fuck you!)

They wouldn't have tried that shit if I was with you

Or maybe my prayers would've convinced him to choose another soul

Man, you look so peaceful right now
How can I argue with that?
They say that the good die young

They say that the good die young (die young)

They say the good die young (die young)
That's why I know that we gon' have fun (uh)
In this life 'cause you only get one
When God call for me don't cry, I just went home

[Verse 1: Kon Artis]
I'm sure that everybody heard their momma say there'd be days like this
When you see, one of your friends die in the midst
In the struggle, into the circumstances
A risk that they take, just to prove a point to a friend
Even then, accidents are prone to happen
To any man or woman that's dumb enough to pretend
And huh, God will hold them accountable for sins
That they commit and they try to repent the sins to repent
But I guess that's the way things go
I was blessed to see twenty-four
To wake up to that ""Hi, My Name Is"" video
Motivated me to write what I wrote
And I knew my little brother sold dope
And mom and daddy wanted to move our row
I did it, I still got a lot to prove and show
I just wish we ain't have to lose Bugz to the struggle

I know you used to Bizarre on some silly shit
But niggas in my clique is dying quick (For real)
In Detroit niggas don't party
They pull a fo'-fo' out, snatch off yo Carti's
That's why I keep the pistol under the truck
I'm 27 years old, too old to be getting jumped
And fuck rap, I miss Karnail Pitts
B-U-G-Z, tatted on my wrist
Me and you in the Jeep, listen to screamo beats
It's a shame me and Fuzz don't even speak
I got married, my wife name is Dee
Peace to 31, and 5150 I miss you

[Verse 3: Kuniva]
I think back on that tragic day my phone rung
And Bizarre's voice telling me Bugz was going home
It was like a knife piercing my chest and I couldn't breathe
I didn't wanna accept it, didn't wanna believe it
I swear, at his wake, dawg I cried so hard
Literally, Denaun had to carry me to the car
While I stand in this booth now, it's tearing me apart
But I had to let it out 'cause it was tearing at my heart
'Cause he died over something so petty and so small
A human life is so very precious, I hope y'all
Understand how I'm feeling 'cause I love you Bugz
I wanna rhyme with you, laugh with you, hug you Bugz
But I can't, and you were so close to see your dreams
A coward came along and took you away from the team
So don't mistake this track as just another song
This goes out to everyone who lost a loved one

Forgive what I did as a kid that run blocks
Now my dreams is just screams, cops and gunshots
The fun stops when your homies up in the box
My doody Bo, bless his soul, snuffed by the cops
I used to question a lot, if there's a God around me say something
If you love us so much why ain't you gave nothing?
When he took my homie Snook was only in eleventh grade
Now I hope to see his face at the Heaven gates
It ain't never late in the game, Satan remains
With a grudge to see slugs break through my frames
My heart aches with the pain, and life limits breath
We got to have fun now, there's only minutes left
And in death 'cause stress youngins is sucked in
To get tats for my fallen homies? I ain't got enough skin

When I was younger I knew four brothers that wasn't wise
That crashed and the driver died, my partner on the passenger side was paralyzed
And I'm surprised by the look of that ride, that the other two survived
Nine months later, another one dies
Somebody shot him in his side when he was starting up his ride
Three years go by, I made a hell of a run
And that's when Funky got done, Joey playing with guns
And Tookie over funds, Cardie was my man
And Reggie, I wish that I was with you in that van
And Bugz, if it wasn't for you
You know I wouldn't be standing in this booth
And that's the truth, I miss y'all

Once you call my name out, things will never be the same
They should've never let us get our foot in this game

[Verse: Eminem]
Ever since I was introduced to rap music
I been missing a screw like Bishop in Juice, I could lose it
At any moment, those who know me know it
So they probably told to go with the flow just so that
I don't explode, and- have another episode
Where I let it go as far as the one with Benzino did
I'm waiting for that next beef, I'm cocked, locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad
I'm going bananas, my dick's so hard Anna
Nicole could use it to fucking pole vault with
Oh shit! I mean when she was still bloated
Before they cut her stomach open and lypo'd it (Heheheh!)
Anybody I throw flames at gets a name
It's a game, 'cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame what people do for 10 minutes of fame
Every day it's the same thing, people in this game
Try to buddy-buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us, everybody just wants
To have something to do with that
They all trying to get that stamp, they after that Shady/Aftermath money
It's like a monopoly
They probably just now finally understand ""How to Rob"" fully
50 Cent was like a fucking jackpot for me
And Dre, it's like we hit the fucking lottery
And the damn slot machine at the same time as each other
Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers?
When we rhyme with each other, in time we discovered
That we had more in common than we thought with each other
Both robbed of our mothers, our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault?
'Cause we started thinking God doesn't love us
Two odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence, 'cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica
Queens, I still remember the call up at Chung King 'cause
Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives he's getting dropped from Columbia
Two years later, me and Doc had to come, and, uhh-
Operate, that's when he popped up at number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wondering
Even if I'm under the gun
You ain't got to agree all the time with me or see eye-to-eye
There'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is, if it is, I could give a shit
I'm still gonna conduct motherfucking business as usual
Egos aside 'fore I bruise 'em all
Swallow your pride 'fore I step on it with shoes you call
Nikes, Earthlings, how do you like these?
You gotta love 'em, look at the bottom of 'em, they're like cleats
Stomping, I been romping
Since Tim Dog was hollering ""Fuck Compton""
I was whiling, freestyling
Back when they were still making Maxell cassettes
I wasn't even rap's Elvis yet, that tells us that
Any doubts in your head, that seals the shit

Still with the Diggy Diggy Doc, Diggy Diggy Doc

I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier
Yo...

[Verse 1]
Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'
Willin' to stick out my neck for respect
If it meant life or death, never live to regret what I said
When you're me, people just wanna see if it's true
If it's you—what you say in your raps, what you do
So they feel it's part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real?
In confrontation, ain't no conversation, if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it; if you conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable'll leave you full of bullets, pull it
Squeeze it 'til it's empty; tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze
[Chorus]
(I'm a soldier)
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up

Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble

These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up

Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

I love pissin' you off, gets me off
Like my lawyers when the fuckin' judge lets me off
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
I'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do, bitch, it's news
Pistol-whippin' motherfucking bouncers 6'2""
Who needs bullets? As soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better 'cause instead of you murderin'
You can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops
All you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops
Runnin' and duckin' out the Hot Rocks parking lot
You'll all get shot, whether it's your fault or not, 'cause I'm a—

I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talkin' to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug with a little bit of Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it
You motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit ever been dropped in two-inch
So ticky-tock, listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
And Lord, have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
And put a curse on authorities, in the face of adversity, I'm a—

(I'm a soldier)
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier)
Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
(I'm a soldier)
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier)
Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

Say Goodbye Hollywood,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'alternative']","[Chorus]
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
(Hollywood, why do I feel this way?)
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

[Verse 1]
I thought I had it all figured out, I did
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim
But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
I found myself layin' on my knees in cuffs
Which should've been a reason enough for me to get my stuff
And just leave, how come I couldn't see this shit myself?
It's just me, nobody couldn't see the shit I felt
Knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell
To catch me; the minute shit was heated, she just bailed
I'm standin' here swingin' on like thirty people by myself
I couldn't even see the millimeter when it felt
Turned around, saw Gary stashin' the heater in his belt
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
I just sold two million records, I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
I need to slow down, try to get my feet on solid ground
So for now—
[Chorus]
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
(So, how do you like my life now?)
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
(Hollywood, why do I feel this way?)
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

[Verse 2]
Bury my face in comic books, 'cause I don't wanna look
At nothing, this world's too much, I've swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol, I would
And end it for good, just say goodbye to Hollywood
I probably should, these problems are pilin' all at once
‘Cause everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up
I think I'm bottomin' out, but I'm not about to give up
I gotta get up, thank God I got a little girl
And I'm a responsible father, so not a lot of good
I'd be to my daughter layin' in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood ‘cause I don't know how I do it
All I know is I don't wanna follow in the footsteps
Of my dad ‘cause I hate him so bad
The worst fear that I had
Was growin' up to be like his fuckin' ass
Man, if you could understand why I am the way that I am
What do I say to my fans when I tell 'em I'm
[Chorus]
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
(Hollywood, why do I feel this way?)
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

[Verse 3]
I don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it
For me to have this much appeal like this is sick
This is not a game, this fame, in real life, this is sick
""Publicity stunt"" my ass, ""conceal"" my fuckin' dick
Fuck the guns, I'm done, I'll never look at gats
If I scrap, I'll scrap like I ain't never whipped some ass
I love my fans, but no one ever puts a grasp
On the fact I've sacrificed everything I have
I never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at
This is wack, this is more than I ever coulda asked
Everywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood or mask
What about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that?
It's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt
I'm trapped, if I could go back, I never would've rapped
I sold my soul to the devil, I'll never get it back
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact
Imagine goin' from bein' a no-one to seein'
Everything blow up, and all you did was just grow up emceein'
It's fuckin' crazy, ‘cause all I wanted was to give Hailie
The life I never had, instead I forced us to live alienated, so I'm sayin'
[Chorus]
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
(Hollywood, why do I feel this way?)
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

[Outro]
Goodbye, goodbye Hollywood (Goodbye)
Please don't cry for me (It's been real)
When I'm gone for good (This shit is not for me)
So goodbye, goodbye Hollywood (I'm not a fuckin' star)
Please don't cry for me (No way)
When I'm gone for good (I'm goin' back home)"
Hell Breaks Loose,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues']","[Verse 1: Eminem]
I want you to understand something
That when I come up in this bitch, I want the fans jumping
I want the fists pumping in the air, I don't look like a millionaire
But I feel like a million bucks, ladies won't ya fill your cups?
Shady's come to feel ya up, are you a D or a C cup?
You could even be a B, it's just me and D-R-E
You'll be in the ER, we are strapped with so much TNT
We may blow, no, not even CPR from the EMTs
Could help you to resuscitate, you busters must be flustered, wait
You can't cut the mustard
What's your problem, can't you bust a grape?
(Chkk-chk-chk) What's my name?
Shady came and just crushed the game
It's really not even fair to them
'Cause they pale in comparison
So much they might as well wear his skin
Don't you wish you could just share his pen?
'Cause this shit's getting embarrassin'
The fog is thick and the air is thin
'Cause he won't even let them try to breathe
La-dididi-dadada-didi
He makes it look so easy, girl, you just hit the lottery
[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink no matter what we do
Everywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
This is when shit hits the fan like it just splattered on Stan
This is the only moment that matters, your homie rolled in with Mathers
Now chaos erupts, Em's in back, Dre's in the front
So do what we say at once, this song’s like a seance, it haunts
It makes them stay in a trance, no choice, they have to dance
It's like the playoffs, just making sure that we stay in the hunt
Take a day off of what? Man, you better lay off the blunts
You must be smoking something, you think I ain't smoking nothing, stay off my nuts
Now hit the floor, baby, time to wipe away all the rust
Shake all them cobwebs loose
Loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose
Yeah, girl, shake that caboose
I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse
D-R-E is on the loose
A mongoose when it comes to the chronic use
You know I can't stand to lose
Me and my goons are like animals
We come through like a pack of wolves
And we came here to retract the roof
Yeah, man, ain't that the truth
Girl, your man's back in the booth
Definitely back up in this bitch
And this is when all hell breaks loose
[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink no matter what we do
Everywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know you're feeling discouraged, but, homie, just mark my words
I'm murderin' the flow, liquid courage, I'm finna blow
As soon as we hit the door, power surges head to toe
I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go
We're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows
Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block wit' your ho
With speakers knocking, it's three-o'clock, me and Doc then proceed to drop
E and hop out the vehicle and knock on your door

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, so let us in 'fore we huff and puff and we blow
We ain't bluffing for nothing, we'll knock the stuffing out you
Revenge is so sweet, move 'til you injure your feet
Yeah, move it or lose it, freak, move to the beat
Lose yourself indubitably
Pass up on that little cute chick right there?
That'd be pretty damn stupid to me
Born and raised in the CPT, yeah, Los Angeles, rules of the streets
Them haters hatin' on me, but I refuse to lose any sleep
Keep that deuce-deuce in the seat
Dre fall off? That's news to me
[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink no matter what we do
Everywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse

Wow, we in stereo?

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Question for the ages: What's going on with my rap pages?
Rappers wanna be down, but listen-listen
You got to feel it within your body and your spirit
When you listen to the rhythm, come on
It's the Abstract, Will is on the beat
Women all around the globe, the world, you got to follow me
Change your history, categories
Different people in the same territories
Hip-hop in the form of Black Eyed Peas
So watch it, watch it, be marvelled of the speakers, please
'Cause they gonna rumble and shake the ground
Break atoms, break a sound
Thunder and bass'll pound, streets with the things profound
If you wanna do to help you out
Make it cool around your friends without smoking now
Play the song kinda loud, it can help you out
And you could work it out, yeah you could work it out
It's like that, and a—

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
And I got it like that also
Got a style that's way out like Barstow
You know I'm known to cook a nigga like charcoal
Steady jumpin' round like it's heavy cargo
(Can I kick it?) Yup, really far though
From El Segundo to Toronto
I once hit a girl up in Chicago
But I'd never say who unless my name was Tonto
Yup, you know how the date rape go
Kobe showed the classic example
Now they know the Peas collect the dough
So they knocking on our door like we Wells Fargo
Yup, they see me in a Will.I.Am suit
But I wasn't that cute when I didn't have the loot
And I don't smoke herbs but I'm still real nice with the verbs
So [Fuck] (Hey!) what you heard
'Cause we got it like that

I'm from the jungle, brother, and I got it like that
Yo, my life got me running through a maze like a white rat
I need a shot at Remy  like Mike Rap like to yack is the fights that got me spillin' on the right track
And I like this, Will, so I might get ill
On the mic somebody might get killed
So many dead rappers there's a cypher in heaven
My tongue is a weapon and plus when I bust, its the stuff of Legend
When this Brooklyn MC come after you
You be running like I herd o'cattle down Myrtle Avenue
Where we at ain't nothin pretty that's the attitude
To be at Fight Club, even Brad had to crack a tooth
Stare into the Sun, they try to copy
Let your eyes get used to the light because you gotta watch me
Sneak up on you like Sake
My lyrics get out a split atoms like Hiroshima and Nagasaki
[Verse 4: apl.de.ap]
It's the apl.de.ap in the lab with the rap
Demonstrate how we act, we attack any track
It's the Black Eyed Peas and we back with the facts
Start with the fat skills that rose in the past
We got it like how you know how to beast rocks
Entertain you, see you soon at the next spot
The crew got you bouncing and dropping your eye
Making nah hot shish and be shocking them out
Tss tsss tsss, I'mma roll with the hot
I'mma flow from the soul when you can't hold me back
Ke-ke-keep on keep on rolling the track
I'ma simply, simply always attach
Jeepny music from by apl.de.ap
From L.A to Philippines, we bridging the gap
We got it like that, you know we got it like that
We got it like— like, we got it like that, y'all

[Verse 1: Proof]
Doing a box of doctrine, on stomping oxygen
After 10 put a fork to your optic lens
Hitting wit a sudden force
Leave your boy laying in the same puddle of blood as yours
When I flood his porch
Smuggle a gun in court and shoot the judge
Easily reduce a thug to a future scrub
A double-deuce wit slugs, I'm Proof on drugs
We'll turn you to a rapper that we used to love
How you on medicine cabinet pills
Grabbing the steel, leaping over buildings that haven't been built
I'm not the best yet cause I haven't been killed
I'm laughing at you faggot-ass rapping for deals, you better

I'm disappointed in my dentist appointment
He only gave me the fucking gas for thirty minutes this morning
Went to the hospital to get a chest X-ray
Checked out the next day in a dress with a sex change
I'm having a bad day
My fucking dad's gay, I hate fags, and I'm fucking mad cause I don't have AIDS
All I want to do is die
I tried suicide six times and couldn't even do it right
Collapsed, had a relapse and called three cabs
And had to be dragged back to rehab with bloody kneecaps
Enrolled myself in a twelve-step program
Tripped on the first step and got pinned down in a choke slam
I swear to God, this Pac poster comes any closer
I'm kicking this whole fucking wall over
Two more shots and it's all over
I'm all over this wall, trying not to fall over
[Verse 3: Bizarre]
BLOAW BLOAW!
Shots in broad day
(BIZARRE, THAT'S YOUR MOM!)
The bitch shouldn't have been in the way
Me, Shady and Mike fucking a hermaphrodite
My little sister was a virgin till late last night
High off a kite off of stick of sherm
Put your mother in a full-nelson while my boys take turns
A unibomber trying to escape this country
Tell O.J. he better be coming up wit my money
Bizarre goes commercial? Nigga, you can forget it
Bitch suck my *dick* that is the radio edit
I'm quick to smack the shit out of a foe
I ain't had pussy in a while, I'm too busy fucking assholes
Battle me? You better go eat your vegetables
I'm iller than a Muslim eating a pork hot dog at an African festival
This shit is serious, watch me sniff 'cane
Resort to pain and fuck a bitch barely potty-trained

When the Music Stops,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'alternative', 'jazz', 'pop']","[Intro: Bizarre]
Music, reality: sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
But we as entertainers have a responsibility to these kids
Psych!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
If I were to die, murdered in cold blood tomorrow
Would you feel sorrow, show love, or would it matter?
Could never be the lead-off batter
If there ain't shit for me to feed off, I'm see-saw battlin'
But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
There's too much on my plate
I done came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
What the fuck you take me for, a joke? You smokin' crack?
'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back
I'll get up 'fore I get down, run myself in the ground
'Fore I put some wack shit out
I'm tryna smack this one out the park, five-thousand mark
Y'all steady tryna drown a shark
Ain't gon' do nothin' but piss me off
Lid to the can of whip-ass, just twist me off
See me leap out, pull a piece out
Fuck shootin', I'm just tryna knock his teeth out
Fuck with me now, bitch, let's see you freestyle
Talk is cheap
Motherfucker, if you really feelin' froggish, leap
Yo, Slim, you gon' let him get away with that?
He tried to play you, you can't let him escape with that
Man, I hate this crap
This ain't rap, this is crazy, the way we act
When we confuse hip-hop with real life when the music stops
[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
Ain't no gettin' rid of McVay, if so, you would've tried
The only way I'm leavin' this bitch is suicide
I have died clinically
Arrived back at my enemy's crib with Hennessy
Got drunk then I finished him
I'm every nigga's favorite archenemy
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly, with a Dillinger in the dark, diligently
I'm not what you think
I appear to be fucked up, mentally endangered
I can't stay away from a razor
I just want my face in a paper
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres (Bah)
I'll murder you, I gauge and have me turn into
A mad man, Son of Sam, bitch, I'm surgical
I'm allergic to dyin', you think not?
You got balls? We can see how large, when the music stops

[Verse 3: Kon Artis]
I was happy havin' a deal at first
Thought money would make me happy
But it only made my pain worse
It hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you, dawg
And you ain't got nothin' left but your word and your balls
And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
Beggin' with their hands out
Checkin' for your record when it's sellin'
When it ain't, that's the end: no laughs, no friends
No girls, just the gin you drink 'til your car spin
You think, ""Damn!"" when you slam into the wall and you fall
Out the car and try to crawl with one arm
I'm 'bout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
If my funeral's tomorrow, wonder would they even call?
When the music stops
[Verse 4: Kuniva]
Let's see how many of your men loyal
When I pull up lookin' for you with a pistol sippin' a can of Pennzoil
I'm revved up; who said what when lead bust?
Your head just explode with red stuff
I'm handcuffed, tossed in the paddy-wagon
Braggin' about how you shouted like a coward
Bullets devoured you, showered you niggas
If I was you niggas, I'd run while given a chance
Understand, I can enhance the spirit of man
Death itself, it can't hurt me
Just the thought of dyin' alone that really irks me
You ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
Be smart and stop tryna walk how Gs walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we playin' tug-of-war wit' your life
Fuck a tour and a mic, I'd rather fuck a whore with a knife
Deliver that shit that coroners like
You hype poppin' shit in broad daylight, nigga, you're a goner at night (When the music stops)

[Verse 5: Proof]
Instigators turn pits in cages
Let loose and bit the neighbors, wrist to razors
Y'all don't want war, y'all want talk
In the dark, my dogs all bark like, ""Woof!""
Proof, nigga, I'm a wolf
Get your whole roof caved in like reindeer hooves
Stomp the booth, shake the floor tiles loose
The more y'all breathe, shit, the more I moves
It's Hill Street, this is hardcore blues
Put a gun to rap, check in all our dues, nigga
Or make the news, bet you all y'all move
When the Uzi pop, you better drop when the music stop
[Verse 6: Bizarre]
Music has changed my life in so many ways
Brain's confused, been fucked since the 5th grade
LL told me to rock the bells
N.W.A said ""Fuck tha Police,"" now I'm in jail
'93 was strictly R&B
Fucked up haircut, listened to Jodeci
Michael Jackson, who gon' tell me I ain't Mike?
Ass cheeks painted white, fuckin' Priscilla tonight
Flyin' down Sunset, smokin' crack
Transvestite in the front, Eddie Murphy in the back
M.O.P. had me grimy and gritty
Marilyn Manson, I dyed my hair blue and grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bows
Now I'm in the hospital with a broken nose and a fractured elbow
Voices in my head, I'm goin' in shock
I'm reachin' for the Glock, but the music stops"

Security's gone, I'm trapped in the club
And I'm trying to run and get my motherfucking gun
(Nigga, what about yo' wife?) Nigga, fuck my wife
I'm trying to run and save my motherfucking life
Oh, shit! The shooter's coming
Bitches hollering, niggas running
People, shot all over the floor
And I'm trying to make it to the Saint Andrew's door

Even DJ House Shoes fucked around and got shot
I done messed around, and forgot my TEC
I don't see nobody, but Fatt Father and Hex

I'm trying to slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screaming everywhere and niggas is wylin'
Two minutes ago, we was all joking and smiling
This chick is clinging on to me, sobbing and sighing
Saying she didn't mean to diss me earlier, and she crying
But it's real and it's on and caps is getting peeled
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield and
She got hit, and now she's yelling (Don't leave me!)
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me!
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my .38, I hope it's not too late!

And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes
(Is you hit?) I don't know, but I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitsubishi (Shit, that's the clique we beefing with!)
Man! (I swear!) And I was on my way there
Believe me, I'm leaving a carcass today

All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I never seen no shit like this in my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleeping outside the door, waiting in line still
Trying to get inside the club to see D12 perform
The fire marshals know the venue's too small
People are wall to wall, three-thousand and some odd
Fans and some cum-wad from out the parking lot
Gets in an argument over a parking spot
Decides to pull his gun out and lets a few of them off
Missed who he's aiming for, six feet away’s the door
Into St. Andrew's Hall, now the strays flying all over the place
Grazed one bitch in the face
Another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up at the bar, having a Mazel Tov
Bullet whizzed right by my ear, damn near shot it off
Thank God I'm alive, I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von? He usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute, I think I just saw Bizarre
Nah, I guess not, what the fuck? Oh my God, it was!
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him hauling ass, I think he left his wife
There she is, on the ground, being trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand, but I can't pull her
God damn, there just went another damn bullet
I'm hit, my vest is barely able to handle it
It's too thin, if I get hit again, I can't do it
I scoop Dee, follow Bizarre's path, ran through it and
Made it to the front door and collapsed
On the steps, looked up, and I seen Swift shooting it out
But I can't see who he's shooting it out with
But Denaun's right behind him, squeezing his four-fifth
[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 5: Kon Artis]
Yo, it's Friday night, came to this bitch right
Big ass on my left hand, Desert Eagle in my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight
Although, I can't stay here to fight, 'cause I'm popping niggas tonight
That's right, bitches, I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for trying to check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here, so it's clear that the schmuck
That shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker
So one shot for the money, two is to stop the show
The third's for the bartender (Bitch, bring me a bottle of Mo')
I just wanna know who driving the black Mitsubishi?
He tried to run, so Proof shot him in the knee with a three-piece

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops

Yeah, welcome to Amityville (Detroit, nigga!)
The reason why rappers gotta pack pistols (Why is that?)

Slick criminal wit', the shit I spit chews
Like a bullet came back that just missed and hit you
I say the type of shit parents slit their wrists to
Need an anthem to amp you, then this the shit to
Too many enemies on my list to sift through
Nobody got my back in this bitch but this tool
Sorry officer I don't care how pissed it get you
But I don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol

Ain't going nowhere without my gun
I walk the streets I pack my gun
I go to sleep I got my gun
Don't go nowhere without my gun

[Verse 1: Swifty]
Nigga, we violently active, so fuck with us
See I'm backwards, I slap niggas and punch bitches
Just for asking, they musta been wanting to meet the Lord
When my parents talked to me, they got mean mugged and ignored
They were snooping through my closet, seen drugs on the floor
Shells from the .44 scattered over they porch
Busting pistols in your windows with intentions to destroy you
Tryna break your neck to conversate? Bitch, I'll do it for you
Catch me laughing at your funeral when they lower you
You and your ho, you gots to go, bitches died slow and horrible
There's no tomorrow for any nigga we'll shower you
We young strapped and powerful and I ain't gotta lie to you
[Verse 2: Proof]
Stepped in the door, waving the fo'-fo'
Blazing at po-po, escaping and lay low
They call my tongue ya-yo, but I spit fire
I lit five inside a fucking dick-rider
The clip slider, love to blast a Mag
You a fag, you love being ass to ass
Grab a gun by the nose with the butt to gat-spank ya
Never say that I'm a gangsta (Now that's gangsta)
Y'all niggas sound like Jigga but act like 'Pac
Yo my trigger got the flu and this gat might cough
It ain't nothing to tell, empty shells for the witness
I'm the hot nigga that's gon' put hell outta business
It won't be the same since we touching the game
Make the hardest nigga in your crew, tuck in his chain
Y'all think this shit's a game and I'm bluffing for fame?
I'll squeeze off this TEC until nothing remains

The only time that I'm at peace is when I'm close to one
'Cause I don't know what's waiting for me when my vocals are done
Tote the gun, it's my way of life and it works
These cowardly niggas'll put your fucking life in the dirt
'Cause it was wrong how they left my dog, he was priceless
Alone in the streets, bleeding, staring, laying lifeless
That's why I'm heated, you never know who starts creeping
Waking you up with AK's while you lie sleeping
I'd rather pack the heat and not need it
Rather than need one and not have it, I married this Glock-matic

Nowhere without my..

[Verse 4: Kon Artis]
You know the sound when I'm spinning round
Spitting these rounds from four pounds
While the whole crowd screaming as loud
From they mouths as they possibly allow?
Nothing is parallel to making you carousel
Aerial somersault like ferris wheels to a pair of shells
Denaun carry the nine where I go
Bullets whistle and hit you while I'm shooting at 5-0
Some semi-automatic for static's the motto
Spitting like *Columbine kids* from Colorado

Make all of my bitches tattoo my logo on they titty
Put a statue of a nigga in the middle of the city (Ugh)
Load up the choppers like it's December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts (Ayy)
Told on my partner and helped them crackers give him thirty
I told him I got it, therefore, I gotta do you dirty (I gotta)
Back on my biz, been in this bitch since 8:30
Scoop me a dime, now makin off at 10:30
Goin' on 12:00, go home and tell that man a lie
I got a bake sale, bitch, it's thirty for the pie (Ross)
It's nine for the slice, dummy, that's a Dan Marino (What)
Talkin' quarterbacks, meaning, talkin' quarter-kilos (Ayy)

Oops, I did it again, didn't I?
My shit's harder to figure out than what Britney's tit size is
Ooh, I probably pissed you off again, didn't I, bitch?
So what? Christina Gaguilera better kiss my grits
You know how many shits I give? I wish I did
So I can quit giving these twisted little kids ideas
This just in: Britney just dissed Justin
She just fucked Ben, got tit-fucked and dick-sucked him
If Affleck can get his ass licked, how come I can't?
Shit, god damn, bitch, I'm rich, I can't understand this
Are those pictures I made of us together on the internet
As close as I'm ever gonna get to hitting it from the back?
And shit, when it comes to that, I hit harder from the back

Acid tablets and the magic mushrooms
That's how D12 get fucked up

[Verse 11: Kon Artis]
(""Hey, I like your records"") But my album ain't dropped
(""Dr. Dre's my favorite"") Bitch, get off his jock
Got a backstage pass and I need to get off
Wanna meet the, the Doc
That's how groupies get tossed up

[Verse 12: Bizarre]
Drop out of school, take drugs and molest sluts
Got your girlfriend suckin' on my left nut
Your parents don't like me, but guess what? (What?)
'Cause Bizarre don't give a fuck

[Verse 13: Kuniva, Eminem]
Chokin' your wife all in front of your peeps (Bitch)
She toss a brick through the window of your Jeep
Get back together by the end of the week, that's so sweet
Slim and Kim argue too much

[Verse 14: Proof]
Invite a ho to your house while your bitch is out
Now you got your dick all up in her fucking mouth
Pull it out and then you bust off on her favorite blouse
That's how Clinton got caught up

[Verse 15: Kon Artis]
Steal cars, wreck bars
Get fucked up beyond recognition
Walk in titty clubs like we stars
Our mission every day is just to smoke bongs
And fuck bitches in thongs
That's how Runyan Ave. is cut

[Verse 16: Swift]
When your life wasn't raised up right
Then see your mother coming home with different niggas every night
And then you run into the one you don't like, so get the fuck lost
That's how step-dads get fucked up

[Chorus]
Niggas (Niggas), crackers (Crackers)
Whities, jews (Jews)
This is how it happens to you
That's how people get fucked up
Niggas (Niggas), crackers (Crackers)

Yo, (Kuniva!) the derelict's back
I'm blazing niggas while they up in the Sheraton last
I even sold my therapist crack
You niggas is bitch, straight up, I'm bearing the facts
I love pussy wit' all my heart but I'm married to gats
And nigga I'm top pedigree so don't play wit' me
I'll blow your tattoos all over your baby seat
Kids and all been hit
Peers and all Mossberg will take your back, liver ribs and all
Kuniva the street talker, heat sparker the beef starter
Packing guns when I'm sleep walking
(Bitch, keep talking)
Throwing fire bombs down your chimney
While you eating at Wendy's
I'm in your bushes cocking the semi
Nice with the hands
Never bow down to another man
I was popping guns while you was still popping some rubber bands
Smother your clan
Sever your hands and your legs
Mail your brother your heart and send your mother your head

[Verse 2: Swift]
I'm the only one your bitch let touch her
Type of brother that will fuck your mother
With a fishnet rubber
A belligerent and rowdy motherfucker
That'll dump your body and still fly away to Maui on Atella
When it comes to beefing, it ain't no explaining
I'll change your language with a stainless
I'm contained with an anguish to leave you famous
I'm a deranged pit, I lift an AK and paint your face with
Niggas don't say shit, fuck your hype man
If it's a bystander standing by, I'm fire in at your, 'cause I can
You get squashed like pop cans
I be shooting 7 up in your mouth, man
I'm about to sell your mama bud and lace it
So when she fire it up she's coughing blood
I love to see 'em wasted
I'm made to behave in this case
You try to be brave in this rage and your legs will be replaced

I'm here to talk about little Ray Ray and what I'ma do
Psyche, I ain't gonna mention it, he'd probably sue
Next week, this shit'll be out on DJ Clue (Exclusive)
The first time I had sex... a dirty mattress
No condom... my grandmother... bent over backwards
Bizarre been fucking raw all summer
Let's make a trade, my wife for your brother
Psyche, I'm not bisexual
I'm an intellectual, transsexual, with one testicle (one nut!)
And I ain't saying shit just 'cause it rhyme
I got colon cancer, I'm dying

YAY! YAY!
Rest in peace Jam Master Jay, 2Pac and Notorious BIG
I'm probably the best
God in the flesh
Blow your heart out your chest
And your chest out your vest
Leave your body a mess streets bloody as hell
Study my trail I cut him he fail
A druggy on bail nutty as well
Which such like Buddy Revel
Dead or in jail
Still heading for hell
The ghetto rebels the wrong guy
Hit your lungs, heart
Leave you full of holes like SpongeBob
We can set this from your front door to your CEO office
Got the key to your coffin (So bitch keep talkin')
Greet me wit' offers we taken over
Or get China white mixed wit' baking soda

GET IT CRACKED!

I love getting shit started. I instigate a peace talk
Into a beef talk until police need chalk
To chalk you up. Have bitches walking up
Smacking you in your face; screaming that you talk too much
Tell women you said you fucked 'em
Tell the hardest nigga you said you snuck him
Ran his pockets and stuck him
'Til they gather in front of your crib, guns and long clips
Laughing when they shoot at you over the wrong shit
I lock down your block with lies that's so believable
You'll run and grab your shotguns, Glocks and nines
Walking blind; excite fights until they erupt
Instigate my own death 'cause killing you ain't enough
[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
I don't give a fuck if we beefing or not: I'll squeeze first
I'mma heat up your spot; I'm a nigga that breathe dirt

Liable to leave you strapped with your bible

Egg on fights to plot on the niggas that shot at me

There lived a king who didn't deserve to be
He knew not where he came from nor where he was going

Who loved him with a passion uncontested
For him each day she had a smile
But it didn't matter
The king was looking for the ladder

We'll be cool
We'll be cool if you don't talk while I'm just trying to smoke my weed
Smoke my weed
I'm trying to drink with my niggas; just shut the fuck up
While I'm just trying to get blowed
Spitting to me some mo'.. (hehehe)"
Lean Back Remix,Fat Joe,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","[Intro: Lil Jon]
Stop! It's the motherfucking remix!

[Intro: Mase & (Lil Jon)]
Uhh! Yeah, Harlem is back (TS)
Who in the world want a problem with that? (Fo' real)
I heard Harlem is back (You know we had to do the remix)
Who in the world want a problem with that?
(Yeah! Eminem nigga!)
Uhh! Yeah, Harlem is back (Lil Jon nigga!)
Who in the world want a problem with that? (Mason Betha!)
I heard Harlem is back (Fat Joe!)
Who in the world want a problem with that? (Let's go!)

[Chorus: Fat Joe]
Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back
Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back, come on
[Verse 1: Ma$e]
You know it's deja vu, and the day y'all do
It'll be the day y'all bleed
Wrist minus eighty degrees
King of Harlem, ain't nobody made me leave
Who else could take five years off?
Cold turkey? Come back and fly lears off
Cats front leave them leaning like Smirnoff
If haters wanna hate, then it's their loss
Come up in the Rucker with all my Jake's on
Car grills so big you can cook a steak on
People hear Ma$e call them wanna get their mase on
You hot 16, I'm a very great song
They beating on the DJ booth 'fore the Ma$e song
You play Clark Kent, you better have your cape on
Plenty homes Mansion many rooms
My necklace, 2Xs and three Bentley bulls
Lean back, lean back, lean back
'Cause he's back, come on
Lean back, lean back, lean back
'Cause he's back, come on

[Interlude 1: Lil Jon]
Eminem, what's up! Hey!

[Verse 2: Eminem & Lil Jon]
You don't want no problems with Harlem
You don't want no problems with the boogie-down Bronxster
You don't want no drama with the blonde bomber
Original Don Dada of the blonde bottle
The model from White America
Then Joe, the spokesperson for the Latino
Then we got Ma$e back to re-per-e-sent
E-ver-y-thing else in between
Including the percentages of the rest we don't
The best from each coast, the midwest to the dirty-dirty
Even further to Miami, all the way back to Californ-i-a
It'd probably be best right now if I warn Dre (Yo Dre)
To get on the horn and tell I'm about the storm coming all our way
So tell a pal, grab a gal right now, get on the floor while I wait
Shake that ass a little more my way, but baby, I don't dance
Not that I can't, there's a pistol in my pants, come on
[Chorus: Fat Joe]
Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back, come on
Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back, come on

[Verse 3: Remy Ma]
Ayo, Remy pop but I'm hot like an out of state spot
And anybody think I'm not, you're found in a vacant lot
You don't really wanna run with the one chick
Who smoke dutchess for lunches, da castle hill, I ain't luncheon
Now, it's on it for the Terror Squad
Pun, Prospect, Sunshine, Geddy, Crack and Remy Ma
It's not a chick in the game want it
My 16 so mean, put 20 G's and my chain on it
Quick to flip, I ain't the average chick
I'm packin' a MAC in the back of the forty-five past six
And you know, I got enough goons to crush a country
Any dude disrespectin' Pun, he better play then run C
Bring your mans and then we handle him
Then we gon' Timbaland trample 'em, then we pull the cans in them
Lean back 'cause I ain't never worry
See, I'm forever glory, smackin' up any chick in my territory
[Chorus: Fat Joe]
Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back
Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back
Come on

[Verse 4: Fat Joe & Lil Jon]
No Judas or cowardice or Cain's brother
Abel is able to stop me, nigga, not me!
Got the streets asking ""Damn, who can top P?""
Summer Jam? Killed it, man, I did it all with one beat
I guess I'm bi-coastal now
Took a down south brother to bring your boy out (What?!)
As the wheel keeps spinning
I can hear niggas thinking, ""Crack got one hit, then he out""
Nope! Joey bring them semi's out
Force you and yours to pour a little Henny out
So much rappers acting in the game
I had to tell them put the mic away and run and get your Emmy's out (Uh)
Lean back, motherfuckers (Yeah)
This here's a three-peat, we back at the Rucker
It's Cook Coke Crack, preach it to ya, brother
The Mike Moore rap and preach you motherfuckers

[Chorus: Fat Joe]
Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back
Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back
Come on

[Outro: Lil Jon]
Said my niggas don't dance we just pull out our gats
And say blow your back away, fuck nigga
Lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back
I said my niggas don't dance we just pull out our gats
And say blow your back away, bitch nigga
Lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back
Hey!"
Devils Night,D12,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop']","[Verse 1: Eminem]
I make music to make you sick of fake music
Hate music like devil-worshipping Satan music
So say your prayers, your 'Hail Mary's and Jesuses
Take two sticks, tape 'em together and make a crucifix
Try to stop it but you can't do it
A whole generation of kids blowing out their fucking brains to this
Kurt Cobain music. Students converted to 'caine users
As soon as they heard it went out and murdered and maimed to it
What's your name?

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
Judas
Got my nine with six sharpshooters, now let's do this
I got niggas that shoots to static. You don't understand
How I'm all up in you niggas' TVs like Carole Anne
I'm a poltergeist: lyrically, I'm supposed to strike
Try to snatch this mic, you get cracked with Molson Ice
(Swifty get your own woman!) I want his wife
I'm the type to go to gamblin' parties with trick dice
I rob casinos. Slugs, eat those
You'd think it was the devil feedin' you jalapenos
Now you out of the scene hoes shot at your clean clothes
My fo'-fo', prone to make you niggas breathe wrong
[Hook: Eminem]
It's Devil's Night, it's Devil's Night, it's Devil Night
Cause I came back to rule this time (it's Devil Night)
Cause I came back to take what's mine (it's Devil's Night)
It's Devil's Night, it's Devil's Night, it's Devil Night
Cause I came back to rule this time (it's Devil Night)
Cause I came back to take what's mine (it's Devil's Night)

[Verse 3: Kon Artis]
It's like I'm on the john, trying to shit and get no response
Constipated, bitch; tell these pigs to back off
The mind of a rapist, Denaun never changes
Beat up strangers without a reason; I'm a anus
Walk the street in a ""Beat It"" jacket with a glove to match it
Drop the hat shit; I put my head on opposite and step backwards
A walking zombie that's ornery
Pulling armed robberies on politicians without a sense of camaraderie

[Verse 4: Kuniva]
I can concoct the nine slot, plus I run with the best
Hop on a motorcycle, busting wheelies over your chest
Bystanders standing by, thinking 'oh, what a mess'
Blast through every hickie that them bitches put on your neck
What the fuck do you expect, when the slugs get dealt
And make you feel every ounce of pain that Bugz had felt
A deranged team, smoking ganja greens
This carbine'll make your fucking head shake like tambourines
I pledge allegiance to the streets of the D
And if you think you out cold, catch a piece of this heat
And when it blast, it'll take off every piece of your [niece]
From her barettes to her cheeks to her cute little feet
[Hook: Eminem]
It's Devil's Night, it's Devil's Night, it's Devil Night
Cause I came back to rule this time (it's Devil Night)
Cause I came back to take what's mine (it's Devil's Night)
It's Devil's Night, it's Devil's Night, it's Devil Night
Cause I came back to rule this time (it's Devil Night)
Cause I came back to take what's mine (it's Devil's Night)

[Verse 5: Bizarre]
(Stop taking drugs!) I'm trying
My little boy is dying, he losing too much iron
And if I die, it won't be because I got shot:
It'll be because I tied my arm in a sock and smoked rock
Taking drugs is cool, that's why I buy 'em
Shoot 'em up my ass; let your little brother try 'em
Ten years is what I'm facing
Police breakin' in my house, Lil' Bow Wow in the basement (Jermaine!)
A rapist that'll bust in your mouth
I'll probably be in jail 'fore this fucking album comes out
I'm eighteen years old, still shitting the bed
Beaten 'til I'm red; fed nothing but water and bread
It's me again, fucking dirty jinn
So what if it burns, bitch, when I stick it in?
No medication; I'm out of Percocet
I lost my weed plus my fucking diaper's wet
[Hook: Eminem]
It's Devil's Night, it's Devil's Night, it's Devil Night
Cause I came back to rule this time (it's Devil Night)
Cause I came back to take what's mine (it's Devil's Night)
It's Devil's Night, it's Devil's Night, it's Devil Night

Attention, all you niggas, all you bitches
Time to put down the Cristal
Time to take off the ice for a minute
Time to throw a little mud in this motherfucker
Turn me up some
Yo
Oh shit, who those motherfuckers coming in here?
No, it can't be (Yo)

[Verse 1: Redman]
Yo, give me some room, I'm throwing elbows
Timberland boots, Air Force and shell-toes, who the fuck is them?
If I gotta pay to get in the club
I'ma go pop the trunk and turn the street volume up to ten
I ain't on the guest list, I ain't V.I.P
I snuck in the exit, learned to D-I-P
My dress code is all black when I'm making the moves
Similar to the new PlayStation 2
I can't help it if the club only packin' a G
And the fire marshal wanna shut it down at three
And you ballin' ass niggas, who's dressed to kill
For the hoes showing the toes with extra heels (Man)
I gotta get in, I drove here
With a car load of bitches charged on Belvedere
My niggas hit the cells if the line is thick
So I drive the 500 through the door of the bitch

Ayy, they ain't trying to let you in the club

Yo, security patting my legs and waist
But if I vacate the place, it'll be (Stay down)
All my niggas in the huddle, on the count of three
We gonna bum rush the tunnel with a pound of weed
Cut the light on, you see it's Brick City in here
Blazing like Biggie passed us a semi in here
Don't sleep, stay wide awoke
You dialed doc, not dial-a-joke
Crawl or you'll die in smoke
I keep it heated when the hawk is out
Seated low Tahoe, beat it when the dark is out
I'm outside of the line and I'm acting a fool
Like a three o'clock bully waiting after school (Punks)
I've been in this line for hours
I even killed the time by helping my man pass out fliers
Now all I wanna do is get in where I fit in
Shake my ass with the baddest pigeon with her wig in
Jump, move, crash, smoke, drink
Shake that ass thang, the fuck you think?
Papa Bear at the table, and the porridge is pouring
Since Def is the label I belong in a morgue
I'm walking half dead, acting senile
With bigger niggas from jail than the one on ""Green Mile""
I'll huff and puff, blow the club down
I'll snuff a duck, I'm headed uptown

Do do do do do do, oh yeah

On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the National Trust

Down to the bits that I left uptown

But maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought, see how long it takes to digest
Feelin' good when I should be ashamed
Shit, I really shoulda fell but I stood, see, I came
Like a flame in the night, like a ghost in the dark
There's a ray, there's a light, there's a hope, there's a spark
But when planets collide they'll never see eye to eye
Until they decide to set their differences aside
And this is why only one of us will survive
So children, follow my lead and feel the vibe, because
[Chorus]
I'm only entertainin' you, my
Goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
And take you and I
To a place that you can't see but I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just the man who's on the mic
So let me entertain you

[Verse 2]
My music can be slightly amusin'
You shouldn't take lyrics so serious, it might be confusin'
Tryin' to separate the truth from entertainment
It's stupid, ain't it? I get sick of tryin' to explain it
See, I could sit and argue with you, but it goes beyond
Just being a snot, pointy-nosed bleach-blond
'Cause I came here to uplift, let your woes be gone
Tell 'em to get fucked and just mosey on
Constantly movin', constantly usin'
The Constitution as a form of restitution
Bless the children, nothin' less than brilliant
Let me entertain you like Robbie Williams
I'll be here when y'all are gone, rebuildin'
World revolvin', still evolvin', still Slim
How many kids’ll copy? Prob'ly millions
But I'ma do this as a fuckin' hobby till then, 'cause
[Chorus]
I'm only entertainin' you, my
Goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
And take you and I
To a place that you can't see but I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just the man who's on the mic
So let me entertain you

[Verse 3]
My lyrical content contains subject matter
That sucks up all these fucked-up young kids
At a alarming rate, common denominate
Add it up and you'll see just why I dominate
I try to stimulate, but kids emulate
And mimic every move you make, ""Slim, you great!""
But wait, can't you see I'm only here to entertain?
I gotta be the one to go against the grain
'Cause man, I see it, feel it, live it, but it's inhumane
For me to see you be influenced and pretend you ain't
But they don't understand that I've been through pain
If you get to know me I could be a friend you gain
But you can't just stand there and try to judge
It hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
And it's such a pleasure, every button that I touch
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust, but
[Chorus]
I'm only entertainin' you, my
Goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
And take you and I
To a place you that can't see but I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just the man who's on the mic
So let me entertain you

Respect from others cuz my flow ain't ugly its straight Handsom.Speaking wise words like im talking to my Grandson

On Slim's shit, and start riots like Limp Bizkit
Best throw on ""Guilty Conscience"" at concerts
And watch mosh pits 'til motherfuckers knock each other unconscious (Watch out, nigga)
Some of these crowds that Slim draws
Is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard, when it's packed and full of cars
Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw
Is niggas from Crenshaw, from Long Beach to South Central
Whoa, not these niggas again
These grown-ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again (Shit)
You and what army could harm me?
D.R.E. and Shady with Doggy from Long Beach (Westside)
Came a long way to makin' these songs play

Standin' over you with a 12 gauge about to bust

What if he's right? I'm just a criminal makin' a livin' off of the world's misery
What in the world gives me the right
To say what I like and walk around flippin' the bird?
Livin' the urban life like a white kid from the burbs
Dreamin' at night of screamin' at Mom, schemin' to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me, and people to see
That, somewhere deep down, there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD usin' the fag word so freely
It's just me bein' me; here, want me to tone it down?
Suck my fuckin' dick, you faggot! You happy now?
Look here:
I start some trouble everywhere that I go (That I go)
Ask the bouncers in the club 'cause they know ('Cause they know)
I start some shit, they throw me out the back door (The back door)
Come back and shoot the club up with a .44 (A .44)

You ready to rap, motherfucker?
You ready to sell your soul?
Ha-ha-ha-ha, the rap game, motherfucker!

[Verse 1: Swift]
I'm a disrupted nigga, you made me crazy
You should've slayed me as a baby, behavin' shadier
Than Wes Craven and you ain't even gotta pay me
I take pleasure of layin' a nigga down daily
You face me, drunk or sober, you’ll faint fast
I'm never fucked up to where I can't whoop yo' ass
Your neck'll get snapped with bare hands; fuck music
Is he rappin'? It's cool, but fools, just don't confuse it
What happens: these dudes get rude, then I lose it
I'm scandalous, I'll blow your two kids off the atlas
With a gat that's bigger than Godzilla's back, nigga
You are not realer, in fact, you'll feel the effects
Of a crack dealer, y'all presidents sends me smack
And got a MAC-10 with it, so I ain't gotta rap
But I'm thankful for that, don't mistaken me, black
Or you'll be stankin' in the back of a fuckin' Cadillac
[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'ma get snuffed, ‘cause I ain't said enough to pipe down
I'll pipe down when the White House gets wiped out
When I see that little Cheney dyke get sniped out
Lights out, bitch, adiós, goodnight *gunshot* (Ah!)
Now put that in your little pipe and bite down
Think for a minute, ‘cause the hype just died down
That I won't go up in the Oval Office right now
And flip whatever ain't tied down upside down
I'm all for America; fuck the government
Tell that C. Delores Tucker slut to suck a dick
Motherfucker ducked, what the fuck? Son of a bitch
Take away my gun, I'm gonna tuck some other shit
Can't tell me shit about the tricks of this trade
Switchblade with a little switch to switch blades
And switch from a six to a sixteen-inch blade
Shit's like a samurai sword; a sensei
Shit just don't change to this day
I'm this way, still tell that ut-slay itch-bay
Uck-say my ick-day, 'scuse my ig-pay atin-lay
But uck-fay you ig-pay (50!)

If I'm broke, then I'm breakin' up in the place where you layin'

I look at this, why speak on what I want when I write?
So why should I ever fear another man

I walk in that party and just start bustin'
Right after I hear the last verse of ""Self Destruction""
This liquor makes me wanna blast the chrome
To let you know the time without Morris Day and Jerome (Nigga)
I'm low down and shifty, quickly call Swifty
To do a drive-by on the tenth speed with 50
You're feelin' lucky? Squeeze, I catch you outside of
Chuck E. Cheese with your seed, you be an unlucky G
My lifestyle is unstable: a partyin' addict
They said, ""No fighting in the club"" – so I brought me a 'matic
Coughin' the static, I jump niggas; call me a rabbit
Poppin' the tablet and guns that saw you in half with

Police to help you believe me

I snatch the chalk from the sidewalk and piss on the curb
This is absurd, these street niggas twistin' my words
We finally could say goodbye to Hollywood

We never bow down to be a flash in the pan
No remorse; fuck your stature, dog!
Nothing to do with hands when I clap at y'all
Put your jaw on the ground with the four and the pound
Then I'm gone outta town 'fore the law come around
So we can battle with raps, we can battle with gats
Matter of fact we can battle for plaques

Now they all is dead and I roll as a solo artist
Plus I made the beats and wrote all the raps
Well, I really didn't, but I did according to this contract
I was thrown in the snow with nowhere to go
Freezin' 20 below, forced to join Bel Biv Devoe
My little girl, she shouldn't listen to these lyrics
That's why I glued her headphones to her ear
To make sure she hear it
If rap don't work, I'm startin' a group with Garth Brooks

White America,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'alternative']","[Intro]
America! Ha ha ha! We love you
How many people are proud to be citizens
Of this beautiful country of ours, the stripes and the stars
For the rights that men have died for to protect?
The women and men who have broke their necks
For the freedom of speech the United States government has sworn to uphold… or so we're told
(Yo, I want everybody to listen to the words of this song)

[Verse 1]
I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Who would've thought standin' in this mirror, bleachin' my hair
With some peroxide, reachin' for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this?
I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
'Cause Congress keep tellin' me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumpin' it on
[Chorus]
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get! (Yah!)
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!

Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself
If they were brown, Shady'd lose, Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon, baby (Ooh, baby!) — Look at my sales!
Let's do the math: If I was black, I would've sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back
Give me the mic! Show me where the fuckin' studio's at
When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like
""Fuck it,"" until I met Dre, the only one to look past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got
Was prob'ly his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
Like damn, we just swapped: sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow
I'm like my skin is it startin' to work to my benefit now? It's—
[Chorus]
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit

White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!

[Verse 3]
See, the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise would've never knew these words exist
Whose moms prob'ly would've never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube, right into your livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too, because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
Waitin' to choke, tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this, like, ""I don't like this note!""
All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy
Sponsors workin' 'round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip-hop was never a problem in Harlem, only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom
So now I'm catchin' the flak from these activists when they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say ""faggot"", shit
Just look at me like I'm your closest pal
The poster child, the motherfuckin' spokesman now, for—
[Chorus]
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit

So to the parents of America, I am the Derringer
Aimed at little Erica to attack her character
The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House

Hey, yeah, yeah
Yeah, ah-ah-ah, yeah

[Verse 1]
An old man turned ninety-eight
He won the lottery, and died the next day
It's a black fly in your Chardonnay
It's a death row pardon two minutes too late

[Pre-Chorus]
And isn't it ironic?
Don't you think?

[Chorus]
It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought? It figures

[Verse 2]
Mr. Play-It-Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down
He thought, ""Well, isn't this nice?""
[Pre-Chorus]
And isn't it ironic?
Don't you think?

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought? It figures

[Bridge]
Well, life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
When you think everything's okay and everything's going right
And life has a funny way of helping you out
When you think everything's gone wrong
And everything blows up in your face

[Verse 3]
It's a traffic jam when you're already late
A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the man of my dreams
And then meeting his beautiful wife

[Pre-Chorus]
And isn't it ironic?
Don't you think?
A little too ironic
And yeah, I really do think

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take

Where Have You Been,JAY-Z,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Beanie Sigel]
Damn, how I'ma say this shit?
Ay, ay, Dad
Yeah, it's your boy
You don't remember me?
I wanna talk to you, scrap

[Verse 1: Beanie Sigel]
I remember being kicked out the house 'cause I looked just like you
Said I'd be nothing but a crook—just like you
Even niggas in the hood was shook or they just liked you
'Cause all they said was, ""Little Whitey, look, I'm just like you""
But dawg, I can't see it at all, shit
We never kicked it at all, we never pitched or kicked at a ball
Dawg, you never taught me shit
How to fight, ride a bike, fixed a flat, none of that sorts of shit
Nigga you was an abusive pops, fuck
You left me out to dry, stuck
Gotta teach News to box, gotta teach News to block
And that ain't the half of it man, I gotta teach News the block
It's about time we have a father to son (Nigga sit down)
Sit down let me tell you 'bout your fatherless sons
How they grew to be men and father they sons
Father they daughters—nigga, you left a fatherless daughter
I never follow your orders
Nigga you make me sick, pussy, you could... ooh
How you gon' leave these memories in the back of my mind?
I can see it clear as day, you smacking my mom
I 'member that day you showed me that gat, that 9
Put it in my palm when I was young and said that would be mine
You turned me out, the reason why I hit the block
Reason why I tried to hit them cops
Reason why I started hitting shots
Reason why I started getting licked and drinking syrup and skipping court
Gingerbread Man never think of getting caught
Look at your hands, man—damn you fought
Nigga you left my mom
Left us with no good-byes, you left us out to dry
You left us with no letters, notes, no replies (Nothing!)
No digits, numbers was unlisted
You left us with some of my loneliest nights
Nigga, some of my hungriest nights
Shit, one of the reasons for years (Shit embarrassing)
Damn, we used to think money was white
Yeah you gave us life, like, fruit from a plant
We ain't eat right from them foods from them stamps
And to think, you was my pop, man, I gotta stop, shit
[Chorus: L. Dionne & Beanie Sigel]
Daddy, where have you been?
And when you come home, you got us here all alone
Mommy, where daddy went?
You always take up for him, always said you'd make up for him
Mommy, what happened then?
Who was you cheating on him? Why he's always beating on you?
Daddy, where have you been?
Nigga, you gon' hear me out

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I wanted to walk just like you (Remember?)
Wanted to talk just like you (Word?)
Often momma said I look too much
And I thought just like you (And I'd get happy)
Wanted to drink Miller nips and smoke Newports just like you
But you left me, now I'm going to court just like you
I would say, ""My daddy loves me and he'll never go away""
Bullshit, do you even remember December's my birthday?
Do you even remember the tender boy
You turned into a cold young man with one goal and one plan?
Get mommy out of some jam, she was always in one
Always short with the income, always late with the rent
You said you was coming through, I would stay in the hallway
Always playing the bench (Waiting) and that day came and went
Fuck you very much, you showed me the worst kind of pain
But I'm stronger and trust me, I will never hurt again
Would never ask mommy, ""Why daddy don't love me?
Why is we so poor? Why is life so ugly?
Mommy, why is your eyes puffy?
Please don't cry, everything'll be alright
I know it's dark now, but we gon' see the light
It's us against the world, we don't need him, right?"" (Right!)
Mommy driving 6's now (Yeah), I got riches now (Yeah)
I bought a nice home for both of my sisters now
We doing real good, we don't miss you now
See how life twists around, fucker?
[Chorus: L. Dionne & Beanie Sigel]
Daddy, where have you been?
And when you come home, you got us here all alone
Mommy, where daddy went?
You always take up for him, always said you'd make up for him
Mommy, what happened then?
Who was you cheating on him? Why he's always beating on you?
Daddy, where have you been?

No matter what people say
I'm gon' keep rappin' this way
No matter what you may think
I'ma keep doin' my thing

[Verse 1: Eminem & Redman]
I'm the worst thing since fat bald men
Decided to write songs to teach Mouseketeers to sing (Ahh!)
I stick Britney Spears in a room full of mirrors
So she gets fifty years of bad luck
Causin' terror to Christina Aguilera
When I grab her by the hair and drag her across the Sahara (Come on, bitch)
Beware of this rap terrorist with a therapist
With a hair up his ass like a rabbit crawled in his pants
Got a habit of holdin' Tylenol in his hands
'Til it melts in his fuckin' palms and dissolves in his glands
(So who is it?) The fool who visit the playground
With two biscuits to lay down the school district
Get pistol-whipped with a Mossberg
With a pistol grip, and fed pitbull shits
Sniff glue sticks like I give two shits (Yeah!)
If I get too rich, I just get sued
[Verse 2: Redman & Eminem]
Yo, I leave wit no injure, after I blow four in ya
One handstand on top of yo ninja
Crash it, Doc stir the madness
'Til y'all outta work like Tony Atlas
Walkin', cans in the laundry basket
America's Most, with the army after us
Fuck flossin', we take what's yours
Unload fifteen like an ace and four
I'm outta work, but Doc laid them off
(Shit, the power's out) The tape is off!
Yo, you targeted from arsonists
Papermate pens filled wit arsenic
I got hoes that don't know what Prada is
Doc could shape up, touch your barber, miss (Ts! Ts!)
Fade you with a bloody blade
I turn rap camps into Crystal Lake (Kill, kill, kill)
Fuck bitches face is what I'ma do
'Cause that's what white boy Tano do

So how's everybody doin' tonight?
Hope you're in the mood to get drunk and scream in a fight
'Cause uh, we gettin' down for the fuck of it

Rip your lips off, kiss my ass with it
Slap bitches, Doc. Marshall Maths? (Print it)
Weed, X, and the acid tabs did it
I'm ""What's Happening,"" with no Re-Run
Doc. Rob De Niro when the heat come
My barrel hang out the Camaro
Aimed at the nose of them hoes, it's hard to breathe from
Flash the gat, your town, bogart it
Your wallet, your chain: the main target
Beef is like cold engine: don't start it
Bust in the air and hit a airplane pilot
We clowned you, rap surround sounds around you
From ten-speed and brown shoe
Doc and Eminem, cock the M&M
Blood flows with 2Pacalypse and them

[Verse 4: Eminem & Redman]
It's like, Funk Doctor meets the punk rocker
Got the drugs stocked inside the lunch box (Uhh)
Pop junk like I just got jumped
Popped the trunk and pulled out the shotgun pump
Knock wood, it's all good; thank God for vodka
'Cause with my luck, I'll probably get shot by a stalker (Ckkk!)
Probably got a fanatic waitin' upstairs in the attic
With a automatic callin' me up there (Watch up!)
My man, Stan, with a gat in his hand
Stakin' my house out in a tan, tinted sedan
Pull your mouth out till you can't finish a damn (Yeah)
Ham sandwich, or your can spinach and Spam (Yeah)
'Til you gotta sip through a straw, shoplift through the mall
Pictures of me on my mom's living room wall
Hey, Ma, maybe I'll give you a call
Psyche! You fuckin' bitch, suck a dick and two balls! (Hahaha)
I'm givin' you all my job descrip', which is
To piss bitches and priests off with this (""...Need Jesus!"")
Pop more pills 'til police officers
Arrive at the scene and pull me off of Kim
Teeth off my dick, hands off my balls
But y'all can kiss my ass, pants off and all! (Chm!)

I might as well just be a painting smashed on the floor (Ah!)

Low Down Dirty,Eminem,['hip hop'],"[Chorus]
""I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!""
""Low down dirty even"" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!
""I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!""
""Low down dirty even"" I'm low down and I'm shifty! (Ah!)
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!

[Verse 1]
Warning, this shit gon' be rated R: restricted
You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self-inflicted
Doctor slapped my mama, ""Bitch, you got a sick kid!""
Arrested, molested myself and got convicted
Wearing visors, sunglasses, and disguises
'Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll, disrespectful
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
""Murder-murder, redrum!""
Brain size of a bread crumb
Which drug will I end up dead from?
Inebriated 'til my stress is alleviated
""How in the fuck can Eminem and Shady be related?""
Illiterate, illegitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Jumped out (RRRAH!), killed the bitch and did her
Used to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was littler
Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fucking Bette Midler (Ah! Ah!)
Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler, didn't ya?
Bring your bitch, I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her
[Chorus]
""I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!""
""Low down dirty even"" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!
""I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!""
""Low down dirty even"" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!

[Verse 2]
I lace tunes, that's out this world like space moons
With a bunch of crazed loons dismissin' brains like graze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits
Doing whippets, passed out like sampler snippets
Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it
I'ma let your grandpa hit it
Lace it up with cocaine, so he can't forget it
Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum
But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
So what I'm on is way beyond the rum
Or any alcoholic beverage, losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke and left rich
Walking biohazard causing wreckage, smoked out like Eckrich
Dandruff's making my neck itch, what the fuck? Give me the check, bitch!
You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast (The fuck is this?!)
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
Slap dips, support domestic violence
Beat your bitch's ass while your kids stare in silence
I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen really dust smoking?
If all your shit's missing, then probably one of us broke in
[Chorus]
""I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!""
""Low down dirty even"" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!
""I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!""
""Low down dirty even"" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!

[Verse 3]
My head's ringing, like it was Spider-Sense tingling
Blitzin' like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
I'm out the game, put the second string in
This Brandy got me swinging, bobbing back and forth like a penguin (Allah, Allah)
Delinquent, choking microphones with broken English
Make your mama be like, ""Whoo, this is good! Who sings this?""
""Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I dug it
It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit!""
It was predicted by a medic, I'd grow
To be an addicted diabetic, living on liquid Triaminic
Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing
Panicking, I think I might have just took too much Anacin
Frozen mannequin, posin' stiffer than a statue
I think I'm dying; God, is that you?
Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP
Take me to ER ASAP for an IV
Motherfuck JLB, they don't support no hip-hop
They say that's where it lives, the closest they gon' come is 2Pac
It's politics, it's all a fix
Set up for these white blue-collared hicks
It's to make a dollar off of black music
With a subliminal ball of tricks
(Pssh!) For those who kiss ass and swallow dicks!
[Hook]
""I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!""
""Low down dirty even"" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!
""I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!""
""Low down dirty even"" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!

I like my pussy a little wetter, my drinks a little colder
My girls a little older with her hair past her shoulders
Like my weed a little stronger, my money a lot longer
If Blooding ain't right than I couldn’t be a wronger
I’m a bad motherfucker, be very afraid
Boy this heat'll give your ass a raspberry beret
Been in the building, motherfucker, we ain't never escape
Cash money is the Army, Veterans day
The block had got hotter, the World had got colder
So fuck a diamond chain, we wearing guns on our shoulder
If you want it you can get it, come and sign up
We got choppers that will put that Tony Romo 9 up
Man we so fuck about it, 5-star: count it
Could have fucked the world, but I left it how I found it
Took the game to school now I’m 'bout to cap and gown it
Got a circle of success, you can say I’m well-rounded

Yeah, and by the way my name is Tunechi

[Birdman]
Uptown roller, take it off your shoulder
Tommy’s with the flag, spent the hundred high-rolling
Flipped it off the condo, made it off the corner
Sky scraping condo, top floor aroma
High to the sky when I step up in this bitch
Thousand dollar cologne, no ceiling in this bitch
The marble for the Louie, the bag full of cash
Keep a strap on me, a mill on the tab
Priceless with these numbers, flipping in the seat
Junior doing time, kicking up his feet
A mill on the books, I’m stunting with a fleet
A pretty red bitch we smash every week
Blowing on some good Maybach back seat
The bitch sleeping good, a mill on the sheets
Born rich from the hood YMCMB
Yeah Maybach, brrrap!
[Rick Ross]
I’m that fat motherfucker, young entrepreneurs
Zombies in the street we got them pouring out the sewers
Most controversial and the motherfucking truest
And by looking at my jewels Im still the motherfucking coolest
Waving your flag, you just a fucking blood donor
And this bitch far from bad, who put these fucking Uggs on her?
Took her to California, spent a fucking dub on her
When she walk up in the club now every fucking thug want her
I’m just so fucking special, let's see what's on the menu
Fuck the promoter, my crib bigger than the venue
This the shit I'm into, all-black in the rental
My chopper be making hits: it's such a sad instrumental
These niggas little boys, enjoying their little toys
I’m building hotels off the coast of St. Croix
100 mill, I accept nothing less
Black Ray Bans at Obama’s next address"

Yo, mic-check (My dick)
Testing, one, two, fuck (My dick)
My nuts

[Verse 1: Eminem]
My attitude is worse than N.W.A's was
I'll battle you over stupid shit
And diss people who ain't have shit to do with it
Like Cool J does (My tattoo)
You see me standin' outside of your buildin'
Screamin', ""Puffy is good, but Slim Shady is for the children""
I look at my life in a new light
Fuck it, give me two mics
I write songs for me, fuck what you like
You probably hear me rap half-hearted
'Cause I don't like rap anyway
I'm just tryna get my porno career started (Oh, hell yeah)
Every place and event, been there, done that
Shit, Dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went
Want a deal? Study these five chapters
Lesson 1, throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers
Lesson 2, face 'em and diss 'em (What up, dawg?)
Don't give 'em a demo, kidnap 'em
(Come on, you're comin' with me, motherfucker, check this out)
And make 'em come to your basement and listen
Lesson 3, get a job at a label
Switch demos with Canibus and put yours on the owner's table
(Here, listen)
Lesson 4, know you heard this before
""Hey, let me get your number, I'll call you tomorrow for sure""
Don't act like a fan, you wanna get signed
Get the whitest A&R you can find
Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can (Hey dude, come here)
Lesson 5, get a hook-up at Jive
Dress up like I.C.P. and have them come see you perform live
And that's the key, but when you see me on the street
I ain't givin' you shit, bitch, don't even bother askin' me
Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spittin'
'Cause I'm always shittin' when I'm rappin', like Master P (Ungh)
Got a blowjob from Paula Jones and stuffed it so far in her mouth
My balls broke both of her collarbones
Told Mya this shit was all about me-ah
Gave Alyssa Milano syphilis, mono and gonorrhea
And all three of my main girls said, ""See ya""
'Cause Brandy and Monica walked in
And caught me fuckin' Aaliyah
I splish-splash while I'm takin' a bath
Grab a handful of pills, break 'em in half, take 'em and laugh
White trash, fuckin' your wife in the ass
While you're out siphonin' gas
For your lawn mower to cut the grass
[Chorus: Eminem]
So if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad
(Yo, why you diss me?)
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
And when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you had
(A big dick)
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad (Nurse, nurse)
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad

[Verse 2: Eminem]
What a wonderful day, I should go outside and play
Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
Hi, Renée (Oh, hi)
I was just about to toss a live grenade
In your driveway and drive away (What?)
Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS?
Blood drippin' from it
Rippin' your stomach like a paper mâché
You talk a lot of shit, but you was never ill, though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh
Jumped up, choked a giraffe
Snapped his neck and broke it in half
Wagin' wars, went on stage
And sprayed Cage with Agent Orange
And wiped my ass with his page in Source (Here)
The demon is here, I'm steamin' this year
I rip ********* voice box out and scream in his ear
It's not a gimmick, bitch, it's an image, I live it
Give a fuck? I don't know what a fuck is to give it
""Yeah, I don't think this guy is well""
I'm high as hell, I'll beat you with a live cat
When I'm swingin' him by his tail
I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin', lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nutsack by itself
And bang them shits with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off, then sew your head right back
And leave you like that
You just triggered a prick who just mixed liquor
Who's itchin' to leave you disfigured
And stiffer than Christopher Reeves
I was dealing with strep throat
While your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease
I'm iller than takin' a hammer and beating your knees
And walkin' through South Central L.A., bleeding in jeans
(Am I a Blood or a Crip?)
Wakin' up the next day in breathing machines
Flashin' back to bein' shot and repeating the scenes
On how you just got smoked, and if you do live
You'll be too scared to tell it, like a Biggie and Pac joke
[Chorus: Eminem]
So if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
And when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you had
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad

[Outro: Eminem & Sway]
I know that makes you real mad, don't it? (Uh-huh)
That's right, Slim Shady (Yup)
Sway and Tech, sprayin' wreck (Bitch)
And we don't give a heck (Uh-uh)
Or a damn or a fuck or a shit
So suck my mothafuckin' dick
The Wake Up Show, let me tell you what it mean to me
It mean hard beats, hard rhymes, B-boys

Feel like I'm runnin' 'round, but I'm runnin' in place
We all in the race, I'm just another sprinter
If there's no finish line, then who's the real winner?"
Raspberry Beret,Prince and the Revolution,"['pop', 'r&b', 'blues']","[Intro]
One, two
One, two, three, uh!

[Verse 1]
I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely
Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door

[Chorus]
She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret, I think I love her
[Verse 2]
Built like she was, she had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here, I put her on the back of my bike and-a we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm
I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't too bright but I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks

[Chorus]
She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret, I think I love her

[Verse 3]
The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star
Listen, they say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell you, if I had the chance to do it all again
I wouldn't change a stroke 'cause baby I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then
[Chorus]
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret, I think I love her"
Waterfalls,TLC,['r&b'],"[Verse 1: T-Boz]
A lonely mother gazing out of the window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time, he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep hisself out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me

[Chorus: TLC]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me""
One day, he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading, and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all don't hear me
[Chorus: TLC (Chilli)]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
(Your way or no way)
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
Come on!
I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms
Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray, I pray
All ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries
My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope
With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein?
What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane, and name this day in time
For falling prey to crime
I say the system's got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true
Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you
[Chorus: TLC (Chilli)]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're movin' too fast (Ooh, you're movin' too fast)
Don't go chasing waterfalls (Don't go, don't go)
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
(I know, I know, your way hey)
But I think you're moving too fast"

Last time I seen you, you was a lil old girl
Had a crush, now we grown and you still so thorough
Uh, clap for her, work it 'til you exhausted
I swear ain't nothing worse than a bad bitch that lost it
Brains off the chain, smart mouth with a dumb ass
Goddamn, your ex-man is a dumbass
When you was leaving, did he put up a fight?
Was he stressing you? Wasn’t fucking you right?
Well, one man’s trash is another man’s treasure
One man’s pain is another man’s pleasure
One damn thing you can’t change is the weather
But even if it rain, we get rained on together, huh
It’s whatever, you shine, I shine

Nope, I’m peeking at your ass, winking at your ass
If I don't bag, I’ll be thinking 'bout your ass
For the whole week, no time for cold feet
She too bad to pass, so fine, I'm gon' speak

She tell me I got that flame, ""Your rhymes are so deep""
Damn, girl thank you, shit, you so bad
Know your daddy wish he could still spank you, hol' up

Choking on them white boys make a Black Panther
Love my women with high heels and high standards
And only cheat on my broad if I run out of answers
I got that vicious flow, Moncler winter coat
I ain't superstitious, I make all these broads split my pole
Ha, you dig it, this shit ain't for beginners
I’m something like a fetus, see, I'm not quite kidding
And there's something you ain't seeing like I block y'all vision
Like my Remy with no juice, you a lot like Bishop
Hundred K in twenty-two hours
See, money talks, you muthafuckers is Boomhauer
No check back, in debt, yep
Loud in my J, y'all smoke that Gallaudet
Higher than I need to be, flyer 'cause I need to be
Love our conversation but it’s late right now, I need to beat, haha

Blame Game,Kanye West,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by DJ Frank E, Kanye West & Mike Dean]

[Intro: Kanye West]
Whose fault?

[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Bridge: John Legend]
I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it, you know we both were wrong

[Chorus: John Legend]
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
On the bathroom wall I wrote
""I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else""
I took a piss and dismiss it like ""fuck it""
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fuckin' self
'Til about 2 a.m. and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help

[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
You weren't perfect, but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Grippin' you up, fuckin' and chokin' you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't gettin' this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are, I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be havin' mine
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear about other niggas is strokin' you
Lie and say I hit you, he sittin' there consoling you
Runnin' my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1 a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm callin' your brother's phone, like, what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point, I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money, that ain't right, girl
You gettin' blackmailed for that white girl
You always said, ""Yeezy, I ain't your right girl
You'll probably find one of them 'I like art'-type girls""
""All of the lights,"" she was caught in the hype, girl
And I was satisfied bein' in love with a lie
Now who to blame? You to blame?
Me to blame? For the pain
And it poured every time when it rained
[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything
How do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely
Chloe Mitchell

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure

[Bridge: Kanye West]
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, no, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
[Outro: Kanye West]
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called, it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up, but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing, whole thing, whole thing, whole thing

[""The Best Birthday"": Chris Rock & Salma Kenas]
Oh my God
Baby, you done took this shit to another motherfuckin' level
Now, a neighborhood nigga like me ain't supposed to be gettin' no pussy like this
Goddamn, goddamn
Who taught you how to get sexy for a nigga?
(Yeezy taught me)
You never used to talk dirty, but now you goddamn disgusting
My, my God, where'd you learn that?

Look at you, motherfuckin' butt-ass-naked
With them motherfuckin' Jimmy Choos on
Who taught you how to put some motherfuckin' Jimmy Choos on?
(Yeezy taught me)
Yo, you took your pussy game up a whole 'nother level
This is some Cirque du Soleil pussy now, shit
You done went all porno on a nigga, okay?
And I-I-I-I, I love it, and I thank you
I thank you, my dick thanks you
How'd you learn, how, how did your pussy game come up?
(Yeezy taught me)
I was fuckin' parts of your pussy I'd never fucked before
I was in there like, ""Oh shit, I never been here before
I've never even seen this part of Pussy Town before""
It's like you got this shit reupholstered or some shit
What the fuck happened?
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all reupholstered?
(Yeezy reupholstered my pussy)
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy
And when I see that nigga, I'ma thank him
I'ma buy the album, I'ma download that motherfucker
I'ma shoot a bootlegger
That's how good I feel about this nigga
Ah
I still can't believe you got me this watch
This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted
With the bezel? This is the motherfucker I wanted
I saw this shit, I saw it, Twista had this shit on in The Source
I 'member, Twista had this motherfucker on in The Source
That's right, that's right
Yo, yo, babe, yo, yo, this the best birthday ever
Where'd you learn to treat a nigga like this?
(Yeezy taught me)
Yeezy taught you well
Yeezy taught you well"

Do your hands so
Do your hands so, just do your hands so
And wash it up, do your hands so (whew, somebody smell rank)
Do your hands so, just do your hands so
Say wash it up, just do your hands so (put some cologne on)
Do your hands so, yes no means no (ease up man)
Just wash it up, just do your hands so (need a shower)
Do your hands so, just do your hands so

[Mr. Lif]
You call a lady over with a beautiful grill
You go to give her a kiss and yo she breath smell ill
Chill! That was my natural thought
I'm distraught, but goin for the gold is what I was taught
So I kiss she pon she neck and then I caress she breast
Lower body feelin stressed, we gettin undressed
And she gettin on so lookin fine and grindin
Scratchin, cryin, bitin, whinin
Kiss she pon she belly then I get by she navel
All the sudden notice somethin smellin unstable
Wait! What is that, fishbait?
Unsanitary state ruinin this date
Then I pause for a second and the dils went {*drooping whistle*}
Frustration from a foul sensation
Hey baby, did you ever think of bathin?
Maybe next time before you give an invitation
[Hook One]
Wash it up! A little water and soap
And come along smellin fresh, that would be dope
Wash it up! Before you make me flee
You're smellin like old cheese, set me free
Wash it up! I'm just talkin that real
Don't want the {pussy} if the {pussy} smell stale
Wash it up! Before you make me cry
You look good, smell bad, girl bye-bye

[Mr. Lif]
I'm tourin in your city of my lady of choice
She 'bout to come to the show, she love the sound of my voice
And I'm on stage workin my set real hard
She's in the crowd lookin like she sayin ""Oh God""
Sweat pon she forehead, eyes squint low
I hop off the stage and she said ""Let's go
Lord, it's so hard for me to maintain
Whenever you're performin boy you drive me insane
Control me like you control the crowd""
I'm too hot and sweaty girl, I said not now
Pushed me in the bathroom and locked the door
She cryin for an encore, she wants some more
Put her thing against me and started to grind
Now I guess you know it's just a matter of time
You want it? You got it? Well here it comes
I'm deep in the {pussy} to the sound of the drums
Skirt pon she back with she hands pon the door
Shoes pon she feet with she bra pon the floor
Tellin me ""I love it when you're sweaty and hot
Now give it to me rough boy whether or not, you""
[Hook Two]
Wash it up! You just look so fine
I need to feel your body and me can't waste time
Wash it up! Or just save it for later
Let me taste ya, you're my favorite flavor
Wash it up! Boy you got my knees shakin
Back achin, you amazin Bajan
Wash it up! Well you can wash me too
But not until we're done boy whenever we're through

[Mr. Lif]
Mmm, sometimes you're good to go and sometimes no means no
You know the hand signal for no?
Let me break it down for you

Just wash it up, just do your hands so (whew)
Do your hands so, just do your hands so
And wash it up, now ladies do your hands so (Lord)
Do your hands so, just do your hands so (take a bath nigga)
Fellas wash it up, now fellas do your hands so (smell awful)
Do your hands so (Lord) just do your hands so
Tell her wash it up, and just do your hands so (somebody rank!)
Do your hands so, do your hands so
Wanna wash it up (whew!)"
Friends and Neighbors,Mr. Lif,"['hip hop', 'alternative']","[Verse 1]
Let me tell you 'bout this nigga named Franz
He had lots of plans
Involving pots and pans
With fiends for fans, he was a real mean one
Traded all his fingers in for a green thumb
'Posable
All weight was unloadable
Despite his deformity, all guns are holdable
Had his boys on some soldier bull
They were risking they lives, saying they actions are notable
Torn apart for a Purple Heart
This brother had a strong start
But the kid lacked street smarts
Hey, meet James
He works at Ames
To get a discount on M&M's and video games
He said his co-workers were lames without brains
'Cause he had struck a couple goals for which he had aimed
This nigga used to buy grams from Franz uptown
Before he was bucked down
Connection is fucked now
Six years pass and he still there
Helping this old lady with the mean stare
Shopping in a wheelchair
Her name was Claire, but she changed it to Greta
To help avoid a stalker with a vendetta
The cat sent her ten letters
Saying she was a hag to be bagged in leather
And very soon, in her living room, he met her
Well-dressed nightmare in a cashmere sweater
Blue-collar guy with some death in his eye
Tattoo of Satan high, right leg, inner thigh
He just wanna see how you respond
When he give thrust to a knife from his powerful arm
And finally police chief
Officer Grief
Who received a phone call from the nearly deceased
He lost his gentle side at the homicide attempt scene
Now every single thought of murder is tempting
He couldn't ask for a bigger day
The following week, he spent his time staring at exhibit A
A bloody knife that bore flesh and bone marrow
And just before he headed home to his wife Carroll
Reported suicide on the other side of town
Frantic mother claims little girl had fallen down
He's on the scene seeing paramedics on the ground
Mom and daddy ain't moving
Boy hiding in his room and
His fellow officers are all trying to subdue him
Heads shake in disbelief, saying, ""He ain't human""
Next, I'm assuming that the media is clued in
Displayed on the tube in
The room you're now glued in
Your spirit's absorbed in generators and tanks
Data banks
You're retracing your steps and drew blanks
Look at all these lives to waste
It's a dark space
Adrenaline starts to pump
Increasing your heart pace
You're caught now
Imagination has gone wild
You look into the mirror, then you tell me, ""Who art thou?""
You got to be determined like Ken when he fought Ryu
Your brains may bust open, 'cause this is a hard trial
No answer, just a mental cancer
Before you choke, I hope you get a chance to
Feel fear
'Cause this is a real scare
I'm giving you three seconds to tell us how we got here

The wind speaks to my instinct
With the earth I'm in sync
Sharpening the blade of a spade
With the heart of a lion in combat
Though I'm real slick
The salt in the water help my scars heal quick
'Cause see, I mastered survival tactics
And lasted weeks without sleep
Hunting for prey in white rapids

Fixing mother nature's technical flaws

Now you can blend in
Let's hit the city streets
So we can get your feet accustomed to concrete
Build a strong fleet of soldiers

Devour the sun and make the universe colder

Extol the master
Spinning planets around my aura
Like an orbit
Set a mountain on a shore, twist my fingers
And force mist into a tornado
Raw fatal

Draining clouds into a rainbow

Infused bionics with biology
Police carry shotguns inside a robotic knee
The impact of my psychology can atomically wipe out
And devastate as soon as I meditate

Drop a bomb on Nagasaki just because it's in sight

Is it the legacy they left behind?
Well, this music seems to be mine
It's been nine interesting years in the game
Not too much has changed
I've still got a saw to hack up your frame
Performed at all your favorite festivals
Some cats do one show and blow
My destiny to live on the low
It's got me locked in the basement
In the winter in December
Open window, cold toe
Face down on the futon rocking yesterday's attire
Woke up early feeling uninspired
Staring at my album outline
At this point I've drafted up about nine
New Lif, yeah, it's about time
Maybe you've seen me on stage with Ace, Came to Perceptionists
Or read an article on how my verbal weapon is
Well, regardless how you got here, feel fear
Kick the kick, stomp the snare, goodbye the hi
Watch the rhythm die then resurrect
As I recollect
Ancient black intellect
Erase and redirct

Ipod and Treo addicts gotta have it

Have you heard of Lif?
Well, maybe, sorta, perhaps
Listen up and let me guide you to the point of collapse"
New Man Theme,Mr. Lif,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'alternative', 'pop']","[Verse 1]
Now this is my escape from many things on many levels
I couldn't settle the pedal
These are words of a rebel
Come and dance with the devil in the bloody meadow
The ground is metal from the honor of a soldier's medal
I used to revel in the ways that were before me
Go to school, get a job, come on, you know the usual story
I was eighteen and just about to hit the college scene
On to Colgate, considered it prestigious and pristine
What I mean, I was told
That in life there's a goal and it's gold
Those without it die unhappy and cold
Another unwritten code
A savage story that's told
By the media, the medium by which we're controlled
It doesn't benefit the spirit or the soul
So when I enrolled, I went bold
Here's my list of things I wanted to know: myself
End of list, get the gist?
Professors are pissed
Tally up the classes I missed
But I did read books, opened up my mind, took a look within
Noticed hiphop was oozing through my skin
Cut my demo at the end of ninety-four
After hustling to get loot
Troopin' far and sleepin' on floors
Went to college as an athlete with speed and a fade
And came home as a dread who use his pen as a blade
Did I make the right decision?
Well, my folks don't think so
I let them down, I'm in my room, I'm locking my do'
[Chorus]
(It's a new day)
I'm black, strong
Intelligent man, you ain't steering me wrong
(It's a new day)
I got heart, skill
Follow my calling, drop knowledge and build
(It's a new day)
They can't hold me back
They can't hold me back
(It's a new day)
(It's a new day)
(It's a new day)
(Whatcha gonna do?)

[Verse 2]
My once beloved room became hell
Burning flesh is the smell
The temperature rose
My self-esteem fell
In the morning, I would rise to get some cereal
Then return to my torture quarters for my slaughter and burial
Paralyzed by the tears from my father's eyes
Couldn't even raise my head to notice somber skies
Mom and I would sit and chat about me getting back on track
She'd leave then I'd crawl into my lack of confidence trap
What a vicious format
The system sets parameters for livin'
By using tunnel vision funneled to the money system
Ads are dads
Sitcoms are moms
Dollars are our legs and arms
And our heart is a bomb
Detonate if you hesitate
To slave or matriculate
You'd better participate
Survival's your interest rate
Financing is Manson
Hopes are held for ransom
Power's dancing
Sorrow's the anthem
But let's return to this point in time where I'm
Standing next to my ex-job's ""Help wanted"" sign
You'll find my mind overflowing with adrenaline and energy
I infuriated my enemy with my integrity
Essentially, if you wanna work there, don't mention me
They'll cut in half your pay and punch your face as a penalty
I'm self-empowered, hit the showers, I'm on the go
I'm going to the club, I'm out my crib, I'm lockin' my do'
[Chorus]
(It's a new day)
I'm black, strong
Intelligent man, you ain't steering me wrong
(It's a new day)
I got heart, skill
Follow my calling, drop knowledge and build
(It's a new day)
They can't hold me back
They can't hold me back
(It's a new day)
(Whatcha gonna do?)
(It's a new day)"
Loving You No More,Drake,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","[Intro: Dirty Money]
So hard to breathe this air that we call love (ooh)
Ain't nothin' worse than the hurt we receive from love (ooh yeah)
When you get hurt by the one you livin' for
Pain can make you wanna love no more

[Refrain: Diddy]
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more
I love you more than I love myself

[Verse 1: Diddy]
Hurt with the heart that's bleeding slowly
So many lonely sleepless nights
I'm going through hell to convince she love me
But never her approval no matter how I try
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you
I’m ashamed you can see it in my eyes
Momma always told me to respect the woman
But what am I about to do when her parents do not try
[Bridge 1: Dirty Money]
So many tears I cried
But all for nothin' I’m afraid to say
Oh

[Refrain: Diddy & Dirty Money]
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (I can't)
I love you more than I love myself (no, woah)
Lovin' you no more (I can't)
I just, I can't, I just can’t be loving you no more (no, no, baby)
I love you more than I love myself

[Verse 2: Diddy]
I’ve been so dependent on your love for so long
Punishment for me is tryin' to let go
Give it from your heart is what you taught me
Addiction to pain is what it got me
My life, now it's changed
My life, ain't the same as you are
Heartbroke to the point sometimes wanna end it
If I can’t have what mean most to me

[Bridge 1: Dirty Money]
So many tears I cried (I cried)
But all for nothing I’m afraid to say
Oh, oh, oh
[Hook: Diddy & Dirty Money & Drake]
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (I can't)
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more  (I can't) (Diddy)
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (no, no, baby) (Drizzy baby, uh uh)
I love you more than I love myself

[Verse 3: Drake]
Uh, tryin' not to over think
Only 'cause I drove and I've done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And there’s pieces of ya hair still sittin' in my sink
And you still got underwear that’s sittin' in the dryer
How come every time that you’re suspicious I’m a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And that’s the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn. Tell me what I’m gon' do?
Since everything that I’m trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But uh, you see the same one I’m missing
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same, baby, then we’d be for sure
[Bridge 2: Dirty Money]
So selfishly, you can only show feelings
When you feel yours in jeopardy
Oh, time, oh, time has changed and I’m no longer willing
Can't you see how my heart is bleeding?
I guess I…

[Hook: Diddy & Dirty Money]
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (no, lovin' you no more)
I love you more than I love myself (no, no)
Lovin' you no more (I can't)
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (no, woah)
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more (oh, no)
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (just wanna love you baby)
I love you more than I love myself (just wanna love you baby)"

Alright, um, Wolf Haley, Odd Future, Wolf Gang nigga
You know what, you know, fuck it
I don't even wanna go
I'm gonna let my little brother Earl Sweatshirt get on you niggas
Hey Earl, hit em...

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
So I'm guessing there's questions that need addressing, huh?
Like how we fresh in our adolescence and wrecking 'em
Hand 'em tracks, he destined to make a mess of 'em
Snapping necks and records in matter of seconds, check 'em son
Lost an erection and found it in an aggressive nun
Fucking chin-checking punks 'til he's outta breath and done
No FX, in these doper than sess sessions son
Chilling for a while on a pile of the rest of 'em
Let the crowd choose who can fucking last longer
It's the rap monger, rap monster, Earl Sweat, attack, conquer
Lose least, niggas lost like the last blanca chica
That we picked up at the last concert
Please, get out your seat, get out your seat, verses written with scalpels
He's the junior king standing out shouting on the balcony
How come he's not in counseling? Fucker's loud while he's sound asleep
Heard he was dope as Sour D, nigga, was Courage cowardly?
Stay gold, alchemy, nigga we rap's alpha team
Mr. Teen and Mr. T with a mouth full of powder
And a nose full of chowder, he's chopping up all the doubters see
Now watch him count the bodies like bitches be counting calories
[Verse 2: Tyler the Creator]
Fuck with the Wolves, we starting to bark viciously
Catch us in a pile of bodies where dead bitches be
Box Logo hoodies and goodies from buddies that understand
That Bastard was buzzing like Woody so we get it for free
Had to duct tape the mother goose; the mask was off
I stumbled down a hill then I had Jill jack me off
Harder than my dick when Taylor Swift is in my basement
Cause I've been doing this since Pooh fucked Christopher Robinson
Wolf Gang knitted on my cotton like some smelly
Dirty rotten nigga picked it from a cotton gin
Do not give a fuck I've got the swagger of a virgin's dick
But if I did it would be bigger than Earl's upper lip
Sip sizzurp, Supreme on my shizzirt
I munch a bunch of tacos with Waverly's favorite wizard
The favorite nigga turned into Freddy Kruger
And this that raw shit, dead bodies chopped up in the sewer
From the palms of Jeffrey Dahmer, baby mamas said the kicks
Beat like the brown lip balm that was made for Rihanna
All you fucking bloggin' faggots yappin' up that extra shit
I'll shove Bastard down your throat, regurgitate my excrement
Them 2DopeBoyz is fairies they're Peter like boysenberries
Meka scary, turn his white ass to a Jim Carrey twin
A fuckin' sausage fest will them shaky niggas get married then
2DopeBoyz don't want beef, they're just overweight vegetarians
[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
Fucking faggots
Wolf Gang, Kill 'Em All
Don't give a fuck, litter life
Earl Sweatshirt, Tyler, The Creator
I mean, Wolf Haley
Fucking radical

[Outro: Jasper Dolphin]
Haha Niggas murdered this shit, know what I’m saying
Odd Future Wolf Gang, know what I’m saying
Fuck them dope faggots my niggas
We don’t give a fuck nigga, we a wolf pack my nigga, we keep you up barking and shit nigga
Niggas, little niggas doing it big, know what I’m saying, y'all niggas 40 and shit still in the game
These young niggas come outta nowhere taking out all that shit, know what I’m saying
Give me a iced out motherfucking Odd Future donut chain, like fuck everybody else nigga, Wolf Gang"

I'm nice right now man
I-I feel good
If you have a drink, would you please put it in the air?

[Chorus]
That party last night was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three, wake up at ten
Go out to eat, then do it again
Man, I love college

[Verse 1]
I wanna go to college for the rest of my life
Sip Bankers Club, and drink Miller Lite
On Thirsty Thursday and Tuesday Night Ice
And I can get pizza a dollar a slice
So fill up my cup, let's get fucked up (Let's get fucked up!)
I'm next on the table, who want what
I am champion, at beer pong
Allen Iverson, Hakeem Olajuwon
Don't even bounce, not in my house
Better hope you make it, otherwise, you naked
Time isn't wasted, when you're getting wasted
Woke up today, and all I could say is, um

That party last night was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it (I wish we taped it)

Man I love college (Hey!)
And I love drinking (Hey!)
I love women (Hey!)
Man I love college (Hey!)

[Verse 2]
I can't tell you what I learned from school
But, I could tell you a story or two
Um, yeah, of course, I learned some rules
Like don't pass out with your shoes on
And don't leave the house, 'till the booze gone
And don't have sex, if she's too gone
When it comes to condoms, put two on
Then tomorrow night, find a new jawn
Hold the beer bong, nothing wrong with some fun
Even if we did get a little bit too drunk
Time isn't wasted, when you're getting wasted
Woke up today, and all I could say is
[Chorus]
That party last night
Was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it (I wish we taped it)
I danced my ass off
And had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three, wake up at ten
Go out to eat, then do it again

Man I love college (Hey!)
And I love drinking (Hey!)
I love women (Hey!)
I love college (Hey!)

Put their drink, as high as they can
As high as they can, and repeat after me

Goodnight everybody
I gotta head back to class for a little bit

Was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it (You know what's going on)
I danced my ass off
And had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed (You are all invited)
But my good friends is all I need (Bring your friends)
Pass out at three, wake up at ten
Go out to eat, then do it again
Man, I love college

Do I really have to graduate or can I just stay here for the rest of my life?

But after that
You know what's goin' down
My house and 3 kegs
See you there, you're all invited
Bring your friends, bring your mom

""-Life is too...""
To two one-two

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
How DOOM hold heat and preach non-violence?
Shhh, he about to start the speech, c'mon, silence
On one starry night, I saw the light
Heard a voice that sound like Barry White, said ""Sure you're right""
Don't let me find out who tried to bite
They better off goin' to fly a kite in a firefight
During tornado time with no coat than I caught ya
Wrote the book on rhymes, a note from the author
With no headshot, he said it's been a while
Got a breadwinner style to get a inner child a thinner smile
And that's no exaggeration
The doctor told a patient ""It's all in your imagination, negro""
Ahh, what do he know?
About the buttery flow, he need to cut the ego
Trippin', to date the Metal Fellow been rippin' flows
Since New York plates was ghetto yellow
With broke blue writing, this is too exciting
Folks leave out the show feelin' truly enlightened
They say ""The Villain been spitting enough lightning
To rock shock the Boogie Down to Brighton,"" alright, then
[Break: M.E.D.]
Yeah, check, it's enough
Uh, yeah, now

[Verse 2: M.E.D.]
How M.E.D. hold heat like Clint East is reborn?
Leave you with more holes than a dartboard
Haters watch him, Hennessy double shot drink
Like the answer to the problem's at the bottle's bottom
Uhh, from the bottom, top that homey, pay how you owe me
My niggas take no like Kobe
Even with the the arms of the Hulk, you couldn't hold me
From gettin mines, stogies be rolled, smokin and gettin by
Thanks to rap I ain't got a dime
Got me sneakin' out of checkout lines with bottles by the waistside
Yeah, smack 'em in the face, let 'em taste pride
Face trial, end up washed up like the shorelines
Do or die ride, how the dead return
Street turns, keep me in this dirt like an earthworm
What he spit hits and grows, will brothers ever learn
Worth a word, chat with a nerd, meeting adjourned"

Livin' big time
Yup big time

I promise they gone know who we are
I promise we that gon' be successful
With or without the college degree
Remember old head use to tell my momma
That boy gon' be something that there I promise
So they should not expect nothin' less than to see us set like dinettes, I guess
And we all waitin' for tomorrow
Sometimes without acting you gotta deal with drama
Hey to get these dreams I figure it's gon' take more than Nyquil and pajamas

Yo I remember I used to ride to school with my dog Tone

And it's crazy now cause I do business with them
You know people always ask me like you know, ""Why you ain't go to school? Why you ain't go to college?""
It's like man, I didn't go to college cause...this is what I want to do, you know what I'm saying?
This is my dream
You know the thing is you can go and ask Jay-Z who Big Sean is, you can ask Pharrell who Big Sean is, you could walk into Def Jam offices right now be like ""Who is Big Sean?"" and LA Reid will tell you who Big Sean is
You can ask Nigo who Big Sean man, and they know

Success
This is rock bottom, y'all, I never expected it
In order to be businesslike, you must meet the prerequisite
Leave your culture at home, smile, don't be too proud, too wild
You may suffer, just don't cry out loud
This notion of professionalism is like an exorcism
Forced to give your life away while you're earning a livin'
These thoughts had stopped me from rejoining the work force
But now, the situation I'm in, just seems to hurt more
Maybe it won't be bad, maybe it'll be good
I could use a little structure in my life, maybe I should
Take my suit and tie out of the closet
Try shinin' up my shoes and brush the fuckin' dust off of my wallet
Let's consider the prospects
Make a couple phone calls
Now so many interviews you know I've got next week
I'm strictly going from the bottom to the peak
I'm ready, focused and determined to get back on my feet

[Chorus 1: Aesop Rock]
Daddy had a name tag that said, ""Busy working""
Mommy had a milk carton that said, ""Missing person""
John had a new baseball glove with nobody to learn with
That's oil and water trying to mix on the same surface
[Verse 2: Mr. Lif]
I got a job at a business place I choose not to name
Ask me how did I achieve this so quick?
Yes, you may
Back when I was blind, my efforts had compiled a stunning resume
I didn't value it back then but, boy, it helped today
I'm pushin' every single thought of rebellin' away
I'm workin' real hard, my pockets are swellin' and hey
Can you believe I met the girl of my dreams?
I swear, she's meant for me
We've been together over two years, going on three
We married on our fourth anniversary
Bought a house and turned a room into a nursery
For the bouncing baby boy that we're expecting in June
I sat in that delivery room from noon to noon
Twenty-four hours of labor then the nurse asked me his title for the paper
You know, so the government can trace ya
First name: John, last name: insignificant
I'm smiling like a proud dad, I got the birth certificate
Go to the house and here's why vanity's a sin
I looked around and nothing's good enough for her or him
So my eight-hour days became nine
Nine slid up to ten
A subtle slip up to eleven and then
After a twelve-hour day
I got too little energy to say, ""I love you"" to my lady or play daddy to J
And I thought this was the way to be a husband and a father
I guess I could've looked in her eyes and seen I lost her
But it wasn't my fault, I'm workin' hard, it couldn't be
I've been successfully existing as a member of this family
I was so convinced the household had to always be complete
I didn't realize the only thing that's missin' is me
[Chorus 1: Aesop Rock]
Daddy had a name tag that said, ""Busy working""
Mommy had a milk carton that said, ""Missing person""
John had a new baseball glove with nobody to learn with
That's oil and water trying to mix on the same surface

[Verse 3: Mr. Lif]
There was never any talk of divorce
I can't believe how focused I was in the face of such a huge potential loss
Showed no signs of weakness for the boss
In fact, I was mad at my wife, as if she's trying to knock me off course
But I still visited the florist, to get her flowers
When's the last time I did this?
Hmm, not since our wedding shower
I got home and I was greeted by the fact we'd been deleted
I was someone that my wife and child thought they no longer needed
And before I could say, ""Where's John?""
I looked down and he was clinging to her arm
I realized I'd done them wrong
I blacked out and, by the time I came to, they were gone
But somehow I sat and shook my head and then I carried on
And I still completed three weeks of work before my breakdown
The ambulances came and I got medicine to take now
And it's hard to get a job when you've been treated and released
So both my relationship and my career are deceased
It took years to put myself together piece by piece
And thank God I found a woman that's real patient with me
And I'll never let this happen again
It's not to be
I'm ready, focused and determined to get back on my feet
[Chorus 2: Aesop Rock]
Daddy had a name tag that said, ""Busy working""
Mommy had a milk carton that said, ""Missing person""
John had a new baseball glove with nobody to learn with

The Now,Mr. Lif,"['alternative', 'hip hop']","[Verse 1]
Daddy's got a new life now
A new daughter and a new male child
A new swagger with some real style
New car, new house, brand-new spouse
Little shitty dog named Klaus
New smile on his mouth
Wouldn't say that we're forgotten, 'cause we developed a plan
Once a month, he takes the time to hang with his old fam
Half a day to let you know he still cares and such
You won't grow apart too much from being out of touch
But he wasn't there for him on the daily, yeah, the basis
In order to drop jewels like, ""Stay clear of the racists""
Heavy promises became weightless
Sincerity became fakeness
He's praying for his heart to ache less
Time is passing by, yet his scars remain ageless
He called him on the phone to say, pops
This'll take just a minute of your time
But his wishes were declined
By the disenchanted tone at the end of the line
Hang up, try to look strong in front of mom
Back up, John, stop looking forward to the day you're gonna see him on
Now you're eye to eye and you receive an embrace
From a lost heart that's pumping blood up to a guilty face
He's gonna try to find ways to make up for the last twenty-nine days
Or was it thirty?
I think he heard me
In situations like this, his speech becomes wordy
He's got a hundred million ways to tell me not to worry
But this time, I wasn't hanging on his every sentence
Ears crippled by the pain of negligence or was it vengeance?
He spoke, I couldn't hear a word, I zoned, it looked like I observed
My only thoughts were missing out on love that I deserved
Trying to convince myself I'm weak within the mental
But silence breaks, because a father's guidance is essential
He's lookin' down with a smile
Saying, in the future, we'll be great pals
Yeah, dad, but what about the now?
Johnny, come and leave ya dad alone now
Yeah, it's just you and momma now
Stop the crying now
Just try to smile now
Try to think of other things now
Momma's got another date now
You can get through all the anger and the hate now
Calm down and wipe your face now
I know it seems to be hard but I promise you, we'll make it through somehow

[Scratches]
""And now""

[Verse 2]
Little girl, their firstborn, their sunshine
Never gonna lead her wrong, get it right one time
Here's how it goes
She's off to school then dancing on her toes
At an hour-long ballet class
Then on to the piano
Two hours of repetition
Emulating classic music compositions
Do your homework with precision
By nine o'clock, she collapses in a heap of dizziness
But sleep so tomorrow you'll repeat your busyness
She got straight A's and spoke of her stress
But her Maydays were drowned out by the melees
Of mom and dad trying to blame each other different ways
She'd stop and gaze
Thinkin' how it drives her crazy when their voices raise
This dilemma ruins most of her days
From her, perfection was expected
And it's hectic working hard without receiving any praise
At night, she cries where she lays
Then she wakes up, washes up, smiles and goes along like it's okay
On to high school
There's more intensity within her cycle
She's making all the guys drool
Here come the extra tight rules
No mates, not with college on the plate
Practice hard, study hard, steady focus, keep your head straight
Now she's a nervous wreck, looking to collect
Anything that she can smoke, swallow, drink or inject
When she was mentally gone, she went to the prom
Had dates and actually could sit down, discuss relationships with her mom
But tell me how much pressure can a person take?
Before they break and maybe drugs just aren't a large enough escape?
So one night she turned in but stayed up late
At her desk with a single piece of paper and a Paper Mate
Here's mama for the routine wake at daybreak
What she saw made her knees shake
The death of dear Kate
The note said, ""Here's the future of your fuckin' perfect child
Please be proud, I'm living for the now""
Do your work, clean your room now
Take the makeup off your face now
Eat your dinner now
Get off the phone now
Leave the boys alone now
Saturday night, you staying home now
Go to your room and sit alone now
Katie, with the needle, how?
Look, baby, momma needs you now
Breathe now
God, why did this have to be now?

[Scratches]

Heavy Artillery,Mr. Lif,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","Usually I'm at the bottom of the sea, dormant
But every now and then I call upon the torment
So I emerge, feel the rays of the sun surge with power
Then prepare to tear and devour
And after that's understood I let my sounds blare like Underwood
After this, lightning and thunder could
Crash in the sky and project down to the terrain
The heat makes blood bubble in your veins
Waves of energy channel through your feet in the form of a beat
Rally back your troops, retreat
Abort mission cause you know can't compete
You're weak, fuck a backup plan, delete
Cause after the mega-charge
I grow mega-large
Increase in size so no one survives
You can't believe what you see before your eyes
Yes, the god Lif has returned to terrorize
Armed forces came out ready to brawl
But at a hundred stories tall niggas look small
This is the part where I stomp on Kong
Rip through the city, crush and romp
The [bus sailed]? at my frame but hit the flesh
My eye beam connects, burns shit up and wrecks
Lyrical Teks, slash necks
Blood splatters all over my specs
Body parts are found in tape decks
So visual you can't watch the scene
If you press stop the gears lock and pop your spleen
Then I start to finish em: metaphor, simile
Mr. Lif has broken out the heavy artillery
(I got artillery
Keep aware
I got artillery
Lyrics are ammo
You ready?
I'm always prepared for warfare
Get ready
Time to drop this real heavy)

Release the crack and then summon the gods
I defeated Zeus and Thor, now they want more
I call on the rains so now let it pour
To soften up the ground so I can bury the gore
Book me for a show son, send me on tour
Where niggas are fair game up in the airplane
I'll battle everybody aisles A through Z on the free
But none of them are fuckin with me
Watch how I maneuver this
Hype rhyme past the stewardess
Without her even noticing
Yes, I found an opening
You lost cause you weren't focusing
Now your dome's hot and smoldering
Open up the hatch so I can drop out the cargo
Cause I'm known to blaze stars just like the argo
These rhymes are going far beyond your belief
I'm like the Golden Child: each and every day I eat a leaf
Gimme the wreath, I'll have a feast
Gain knowledge of self then I plan to conquer the beats
And I'll build back your mental piece by piece
Giving brand new life to the mentally deceased
But after this the situation gets truly hazardous
Torturous, disasterous
Imagine this: experiencing hell right after bliss
In this experiment I'm the catalyst
Welcome to the realms where money is God
And they tamper with your brain 'til you're a spiritual fraud
As you focus on these words and enter the mind state
I slow down your pulse then increase the rhyme rate
Fall into deep psychosis, what's the prognosis?
Osmosis: underwater diffusion
Welcome to the realms of liquid illusion
Where stationary things appear to be movin
Look at your speedometer, how fast are you cruisin?
Thoughts race, images flash, you're gonna crash
But maintain your focus and move with agility
Cause Mr. Lif has broken out the heavy artillery
(I got artillery
Keep aware
I got artillery
Lyrics are ammo
You ready?
I'm always prepared for warfare
Bring a bulletproof vest and get ready)"
Get Wise 91,Mr. Lif,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","[Verse 1: Edan]
I be the E to the D-lux, A to the N
For all you businessmen ain't saying it again
I got rhymes galore, much more than your
Rap dinosaur, poor self-claimed connoisseurs
Literature hurts when dealing with short skirts
Never fess technique immaculate and effortless
The top of Mount Everest, yes the best bet
Express non-stop, all aboard to the core
Raw relaxor, for the fact you're
Craving, paving this route just like a tractor
Taking the time, to be making a rhyme
Equivalent to a prevalent shrine
That's dedicated to the utmost elevated
Whether it's off the top or pre-meditated
Listener elixir my words be medicated
The verbs regenerated, the crowd was animated
If you're evaluating me, what would it be?
Number 1, 2, or 53?
Well it really don't make a fucking difference to me
Cause I'll be doing this for eternity
Learn to be the best MC that's steps ahead
Didn't have a plan, so you was left for dead
Didn't have a van so you rode your bicycle
Birth and death is just a part of the life cycle
Watching a ball game you want to be like Michael
But he can't be you, that ain't see through
That's the true facts don't idolize him
Lace up your kicks bust your ass to the gym
Develop your skills, explore and work hard
Know yourself and never desert God
Cause that's the free force, the infinite resource
I used to eat spaghetti with tomato and meat sauce
Now I rock veggies with the sauteed tofu
Demolishing a pimp politician 'cause I'm supposed to
[Verse 2: Mr. Lif]
So here's where it starts, I rip apart charts and break hearts
Balance book knowledge with street smarts
A man from your fleet thoughts he's found he's fucking fickle
Pass the sickle (chill) here's a riddle: now who abuses money from taxes?
Makes a law then seals it from the people to make sure that it passes
Using evil's axis to access to all become fascists
Using our greatest fears to lash us
(Usher?) No another sucker, he's got a bottom lip and no upper
Coming from the state down under
(Texas) Yeah, he had a real good time there with her salt and pepper hair
Sending brothers to the chair
(Bush!) Yeah you guessed it
I could smell the dawn of armageddon when this dick was elected
Anger stored in hangars, weapons and propaganda
Conveyed via camera penetrate the slander
Those who dove into the pot that's melting
But waited eternally in line for a helping
You step before your turn, they bite your fucking hand like the bore worms
Breaking you down with more germs
Disease is corrosive, light is highly explosive
Rhymes are cock and loaded, niggas oppose Lif
I'm wrecking your dome while I'm escaping your focus
So pick your savior nigga: Jesus, Michael, or Joseph
I played when I was younger but those days have passed
(Yo what you do now?) I rip frames and laugh
I'm bombing your set like I'm a poet
Four heads from four feds who got dizzy once they saw dreads
Yeah they represent power
It means that when you come too hard at me I'm going to charge you by the hour
They bonded together and now they're strong presumably
My locks are proof that there is strength in unity
So now it's possible, I'm the son probable I see through all the bull
While you're in the huddle call the audible
Stop and realize you're the captain of a ship that has capsized
Words from a brother who raps wise"
Return of the B-Boy,Mr. Lif,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop']","[Verse 1]
Seconds after I had been swept off my feet
Open flew the doors and in steps the beat
Complete with medical packs and four-fours
Looked at me and said, ""Damn, this nigga needs gauze""
Wars are fought in the street, he got beat
The meek are disenfranchised and left weak
Peep these images I couldn't ignore
Personas of the rhythm who just walked in the store
The snare, Slim, sported a rare grin
Noticing damage within, removed bullets and patched skin
The kick drum, Scurvy, opened my eyes, he say, ""Don't worry""
At the clerk, he fired rounds in a flurry
And the hi-hat, Matt, tapped the hostages with his gat
Told 'em, ""Break the fuck out and never look back""
They had performed like Miyagi for the kamikaze
Then they got me, walked me out past the local paparazzi
""I see, y'all reanimators."" ""Sure, kid, ya jams are flavor
We need a savior and we came ta relay the data
I'll repay you, major situation 'cross town
Our music has lost sound 'cause they had us locked down
'They' meaning sucker rappers—herbs, crabs
Common clowns who be making shitty sounds in labs
They're defacing masterpieces just to blast to pieces what's dope
And hope that we'd accept a wacker thesis""
""Jesus, where's the chamber?
Allow me to become the scum rearranger""
They said, ""Focus your anger
And bring the rhymes that you wrote because these folks'll hang you""
I accepted their concern, turned to 'em and said
""Fuck that written shit, I'll flip these niggas off the head
What about the feds?"" ""Ayo, we left them a decoy
We didn't want the beast to know we brought back the B-Boy""

[Verse 2]
Hip-hop is so wack, the beats are fighting back
And I was sent to attack, so I'm following the map
X's mark the rappers I would soon hex with
Corrosive cadences that'll be leaving their necks split
Step by step, I'm headed toward the set
To analyze a threat and make 'em regret the day we met
I suspect they got a smooth plot, I'm headed to the rooftops
That's where I'll make my stratagem so I can splatter them
They were only half o' ten, five less rappers alive
When we collide, the standard is dope
They didn't coincide, they were sacrilegious and vicious
With dark wishes, which is
To assure the core of hip-hop withers, snitches
I dropped dime on how to travel back in time
So they can melt and misalign pioneers' patterns of rhyme
And I'm furious, seething at what I'm seeing
Soon those niggas won't be breathing
I've seen what I got to so I'm leaving
'Cause I wanna set off the slaughter for the evening
Niggas hopped on my shit list with a swiftness
I'm about to rip this, come bear witness

[Beat changes]

[Verse 3]
Mic check, we had ill static over Illmatic
I reached for it, this nigga said I couldn't have it
So tragic for him to try to counter my magic, I'm rabid
Reached through his fucking face and grabbed it
Nigga, how the fuck did you figure you could interfere with a music so potent?
Then, I gazed at his skull for a moment before I moved on
Then, I heard two songs, distinct flavors
From Wu's Enter the 36 Chambers
I'm about to bring this nigga danger
He was elusive, an Uncle Tom carrying nooses
Strong, yet spiritually useless
I gave him flashbacks of niggas getting treated like lab rats
Beaten with whips and straps
Hit him with conscience, held a mirror up to his face
The motherfucker jetted out of the place
Who's next to get me vexed?
This rapper making idle threats, claiming that he's got concepts
I stepped to him slow, looked deep in his eyes
Seen a prison was within him, 'cause he's living a lie
I grabbed Daily Operation
Told him that man was not meant to rule the earth's population
These thoughts left him pacing
Now he suffers from brain disintegration, no thoughts or information
It started raining, visibility low
This had no effect on my abilities, though
To murder an MC is standard procedure
I looked and seen this cat guarding Follow the Leader
But I'm a cheetah, the abdomen and chest deleter
Primary feature: My intense urge to bleed ya
While his blood's draining, I'm steadily aiming to find the next nigga for maiming
That's when my instincts came in handy
This mega-large nigga tried to brand me
I dodged a mega-blast of energy; then, my mind aged a century
Futuristic data for a complex matter
His power left a crater; I could peep the equator
He smiled, I could see him through the earth's vapor
Looked him up and down as we walked toward solid ground
What? My jaw dropped at what I found
Classics by Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul
B.D.P., P.E. and Run-D.M.C
Low End Theory, Three Feet
Criminal Mind', Takes a Nation of Mill', time to kill
Run-D.M.C., self-titled
This nigga's my arch-rival, survival not liable
Got up close and what I saw, I couldn't believe
My enemy was a genetic replica of me
Battling yourself is the biggest chore
It could leave your digits raw, a truly vicious type of war
So now I'm thrown off, taken back
In fact, I didn't know how to react, I lacked a plan of attack
But his was in full effect, and next, he'd infect my intellect
With thoughts I couldn't accept
Images of my grandmother in that old folks' home became very vivid in my dome
His method is drastic, telepathic
Damaging my mental fabric, hellified, horror, havoc
Crippled, I can't stand it or understand it
Yet my torture was expanded by thoughts that he commanded
Had a vision of my uncle sitting dying by himself
Meanwhile, he's breaking down my physical health
Body blows, several shots to the head
Ninety-eight percent of which were absorbed by my dreads
The other two percent, I accepted just so I can feel the heat again
Had a vision of defeating men so now, I'm back
Strapped and intact, increasing my brain waves to maximum impact
Thoughts were unholy; slowly, he looked me up and down coldly
Like I'm the motherfucking phony, and maybe I am
Damn, I stuttered, dropped the mic from my hand
Saw some open land so I ran but as I jet past past thoughts
My man had blast shots
Blood clots stopping circulation to my knot
My ego split
My humility started to mumble feeble shit
The thug within me had a dream of Desert Eagle clips
So who's me? Maybe this uzi
The cold-hearted steel with a sign that says, ""Use me""
I call her ""Suzy""
Do you like what you see? Usually
I wouldn't let a biter confuse me
So why should this instance make a difference?
So I started to think with the innocence of infants
And since I'm incensed, burn incense, I'm intense
Funny how the powerful scent just dents his senses
Don't even count him in at the census
I sent this razor-sharp tone of relentless
Sequences that leap fences
Leading all humankind to deep ventures
So I shift forward like a Sith Lord with a swift sword
Flipped and clipped his mic cord
Speechless, riddled with weakness, peep this
He tried to use the heat of his desire to beat Lif
Be my guest, take a guess who left the set blessed
And who was left a mess (""Fight fire with fire"")
And at P's request
I summoned the sun to burn a hole in his chest"

I was mad dipped
Butterfly collars and shit
Chains from the slave ship
Dreads with the wave kit
Bifocals and wing tips
Velvet pants and a velour coat
Looked in the mirror
""Damn, I look dope""
Folded up the singles in my loot-clip
Put a sock in my pants on some Uncle Luke shit
Dressed to impress, now I'm ready to go
The club is twelve blocks away and I got no loot, so
I walk ten and take a cab for two
Black duct tape over the hole in my shoe
I've got the hottest dance steps
Running Man, Cabbage Patch plus The Robocop
Then I'll bring back The Wop
Jaws will drop and all the ladies will flock
Brothers thinking (What he got that I ain't got?)
I'll tell ya, fella
It's written in my bestseller
It started to rain
Shit, I got no umbrella
The walking turned to running
Still, I look stunning
Covered 'nuff ground before my taxi was summoned (Hey, taxi)
Got to the spot and hopped out at the front
Tripped over the curb, limping, 'cause my toes were stubbed
Then I tried to give pounds to people I didn't know (Yo, what's up, y'all?)
Like Lucy and Joe
My destination was the back do'
Not because the bouncer told me not to come back
I'm just sneaking in the club, because I got it like that
[Verse 2: Insight]
I remember when you used to be broke
Ignored when you spoke
And people would take you for a joke
You used to go to the club
And look like a scrub
But couldn't afford the admission
From outside, you're looking in
Waiting for a chance to slip by
You slide through the back door
But you wasn't supposed to be there
You'd look like an idiot if you got caught
But you didn't care
Just as long as you got your groove on
It was smooth sailing
They was playing the Thong Song
You're feeling shorty with the boots on
Cutting through the crowd sideways, it's time to move strong
To cool kick it, say something slick off the top
Flash your jewels, fix your suit
Fidgeting with your wristwatch (Mhmm)
But right when you was in the corner acting a big shot
They threw on some hiphop
People got on the dance floor
And a bouncer saw you standing at the corner near the door (Hey, you)
He started walking your way, to muscle you out
Since you refused to pay
So there was nothing for you to say
When he blew up your spot (I told you not to come back here)
And threw you out the front to the floor
Past the bar on the right through the double doors
You mumbled and swore, stumbled and tripped on the pavement (Goddamn)
People in line started laughing
When they threw you hat then
Screaming that you wasn't allowed back in
But that was back then, acting like nothing happened
You patted your Tims off, depressed from embarrassment
It could have been fresh, it would have been lavish
One day you'll make it and won't have to deal with this madness

I'm writing rhymes on a page, I'm goin' off in a rage
Cause I'm out on a mission, a stolen car mission
Had a small problem with the transmission
Three on the tree in the middle of the night
I have this steak on my head 'cause I got into a fist fight

Go on uptown fucking senoritas
In Taco Bell screaming, ""Viva gorditas!""
Bring all your dogs - I give em rabies
They never had a chance like my two aborted babies (WAAAH!)
Got Pope John Paul the 2nd, praying to Satan

On barbituates with that shit that you hit
Smoke my spliffs withcha, cause spina bifida

My nine is lifting ya six feet when I spray rounds
Hit you with twelve shots in mid-air
And four more on the way down
As eight strays graze through a kid's hair on the playground
You lay down on a stretcher (Don't get carried away now!)
No pun intended, just hop out of your whip
And leave it unattended before I whip out this gun and end it
Unless you want it dented with bullet holes any minute

And misspelling you, prank you and put the fear of hell in you
Escaped Bellevue, stuffed the nurse in a purse
Disperse like I added too many words in a verse
Slim Shady, a perverted version of birth
Driving off, leaving a murdered virgin at church
The first person who searching the Earth for the motherfucker
That pulled the plug when they should have alerted the surgeon first (Kill his ass)
Get thrown curves, and hit with your own words
Leave me alone bitch! I get on my own nerves!
And if I don't got two balls and a middle finger to throw up
I'm taking off both shoes and sticking each middle toe up
(Fuck y'all!!!!)
[Hook: Mr. Eon & Eminem]
If you got a bowl of hash better cash it
Got a satchel? Flash it, I'mma take your last hit
And if you spittin wack shit on the microphone
I'mma snatch it outta your hand so fast I'mma detach it
So if you got a bowl of hash, you better cash it
Got a satchel? Flash it, I'mma take your last hit
I'm flabbergasted off two tabs of acid
Threw my baby's mother in the hatchback and latched it

[Outro: Eminem & Mr. Eon]
Any disease out there I'm willing to catch it

All praises to The High & Mighty

My Band,D12,['hip hop'],"[Intro: Eminem]
I don't know, dude
I think everybody's all jealous and shit
‘Cause I'm, like, the lead singer of the band, dude
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me, dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show, because

[Chorus: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
‘Cause once I blow, they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Verse 1: Eminem]
So I get off stage, right? Drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks, and I'm all like:
""Sup, ladies? My name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer of D12, baby""
They're all like, ""Oh my God, it's him
Becky, oh my fucking God, it's Eminem
I swear to fucking God, dude, you fucking rock
Please, Marshall, please, let me suck your cock""
Now by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my a capellas
All the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So, like every single night, they pick a fight with me
But when we fight, it's kinda like sibling rivalry
‘Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude, I just think they're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday, Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
‘Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife-to-be
This rock star shit is the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me, because these
[Chorus: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
‘Cause once I blow, they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

Baby, yeah

Alright, alright, alright, give me the mic, man
Okay, dawg, give—come on
Dude!
Give me this mic!
Ow, dude!

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay & Kon Artis]
You just wanna see a nigga backwards, don't you? (Uh-huh)
ADAT? How come we don't rap on Pro Tools? (God dang)
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van (Uh-huh) and he in a tour bus (Ha)
You don't want my autograph, you's a liar
And no, I'm Swift, ""Oh, I thought you were Kuniva"" (Come on!)
And what the hell is wrong with our dressing room?
‘Cause our shit is looking smaller than a decimal
See, I know how to rap (Uh-huh,) it's simple, but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book (Yeah)
So I'm more intact, tryin' to get on the map
Doing jumping jacks while getting whipped on my back
[Verse 3: Kuniva, Kon Artis, & Eminem]
Look at Em's little punk ass, thinking he the shit
Yeah, I know, man, by himself, taking all the flicks
Hey, I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue?
No, I had an interview, not you two
You gon' be late for soundcheck! Man, I ain't going to soundcheck
And our mics are screwed up! And his always sound best
You know what, man? I'ma say somethin'
Ayo Em! You got somethin' to say? Man, nuttin'
I thought you was about to tell him off, man, wassup?
Man, I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man, shut up
And you ain't even back me up and we supposed to be crew
Man, I was about to talk right after you, I swear
Aww, man, whatever I swear, man!

[Chorus: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
‘Cause once I blow, they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Verse 4: Proof, Eminem, & Kon Artis]
They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Went from sold out arenas to amusement parks
How I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot?
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
(Ayo—) Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear, ""Hey, dude, I love your band!""
We ain't a band, bitch, we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent?
And these guys acting funny every area code
Proof, carry my bag! Bitch, carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?
[Verse 5: Bizarre]
God damn it, I'm sick of this group (Fuck D12)
Time for me to go solo and make some loot (Yeah)
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
'Til Kon Artis slipped me some crack (Take this)
""Lose Yourself"" video, I was in the back
""Superman"" video, uh, I was in the back (Hahaha)
For the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us some questions
Like, ""Who is D12?"" ""How we get started?""
(But what about Eminem?) Bitch, are you retarded?
Anyway, I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big-ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (Hey sexy!)
50 told me to do sit-ups to get buff
Did two and a half and couldn't get up
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm 'bout to start a group with The Real Roxanne

[Bridge: Eminem & Bizarre]
Girl, why can't you see you're the only one for me?
And it just tears my ass apart
To know that you don't know my name

[Refrain: Bizarre]
Man, fuck this

[Chorus: Bizarre]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band (Haha)
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands (Fuck Marshall)
‘Cause once I blow, I know that I'll be the man (Yeah)
All because I'm the new singer—

[Post-Chorus: Eminem & Bizarre]
My band, my band (Your band)
My band, my band (Our band, your band)
My band, my band (You man, you man)
My band, my band, my band (Roxanne Shanté, you lesbian)
Yeah, hey y'all, the hardest boy band in the world, D12!

[Outro: Eminem]
I'm the lead singer of my band
I get all the girls to take off their underpants
I'm the lead singer of my band
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
My salsa, woah, woah, woah
Look out for my next single, it's called ""My Salsa""
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants

Aye!
Thanks for having me
Umm?
My first time here
Good crowd
Hell of a crowd
Im being sarcastic by the way
Yea I had to use the in-house band

[Verse 1: Charles Hamilton]
I was born with more Songz than Trey
Wrote a song a day
No childhood like JonBenét
But it was all in faith
That my thoughts could make
Awesome cake
But ultimately dreams fall and break
No job, No life, Just music
So I could just lose my self
Or just lose it
Bong and dutch usage got my mind gone
My lungs foolish and my feelings so fucked up and useless
I'm ""Shinin""
But deep inside I'm lying
Tryna gain approval
Making moves that may confuse you
Haters, fakers, they just use you
Make you do some crazy things
But all this hatred makes me think
I'm destined for something
But what is the question
So I dismiss all the stress and im left with (Shinin)
[Hook]
Can't you see I'm shinin'
I gotta Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh
To my highest ground
I'm a supernova never dying down
'Cause I'm a diamond
Yes indeed I'm shinin'
I gotta Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh
When my passes on
Im shinin' put your sunglasses on

[Verse 2: Charles Hamilton]
I grew up with more Rimes than Leann
I really am, A musical prodigy
Damn
Can't see Charles player
Im lyrically a beast
And this motherfucking beat is in D sharp major
Wake up
Play a couple cords on my Yamaha
'Til my momma got tight, tell me that I gotta stop
She like, ""Charles, it's 3:20 in the morning
So at 7 o'clock ya' ass better not be yawning""
I said, ""Please mommy
I'm trying to fulfill my fantasies
Bring wealth and honor to my family tree
Add some more green to the branch and leaves""
But lately
When I plan the seed it gets shaky
Gotta face me in the mirror
I'm crazy, a loser, praying for a bitch to upgrade me
'Cause im lazy.. (haha)
So, I better plot for success
To prove that's it not just for sex
I got to be next
Or my hopes and dreams will be gone along with everything I own in a box to the left (Damn)
My best friend's doing his thing in college
I hate it when this nigga try to bring my knowledge
I put myself in the predicament that I'm in
But you won't see me whining
Why? 'Cause I'm (Shinin')

Mirror mirror on the wall
Tell me mirror, what is wrong?
Can it be my De La Clothes
Or is it just my De La Soul?
What I do ain't make-believe
People say I sit and try
But when it comes to being De La
It's just me myself and I

[Hook]
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

[Verse 2 - Posdnuos]
Now you tease my Plug One style
And my Plug One spectacles
You say Plug One and Two are hippies
No we're not, thats pure plug bull
Always pushing that we formed an image
There's no need to lie
When it comes to being Plug One
It's just me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

Proud, I'm proud of what I am
Poems I speak are Plug Two type
Please oh please let Plug Two be
Himself, not what you read or write
Write is wrong when hype is written
On the Soul, De La that is
Style is surely our own thing
Not the false disguise of show-biz
De La Soul is from the soul
And in fact I can't deny
Strictly from the Dan called Stuckie
And from me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

Glory Glory Hallelu
Glory for Plug One and Two
But that glory's been denied
By condescending dookie eyes
People think they diss my person
By stating I'm darkly packed
I know this so I point at Q-Tip
And he states, ""Black is Black""
Mirror mirror on the wall
Shovel chestnuts in my path
Just keep all nuts twistin up
So I don't get an aftermath
But if I do I'll calmly punch them
In the 4th day of July
Cause they tried to mess with third degree
That's me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I"

Joey Talk To Em
Hoping my true motherfucker know this be the realest shit I ever wrote
It's Its That On Top Muzik
I be at the mall, walk up in the store
Glance up at the wall, pick out a few kicks
I need 11′s in these
Matter of fact while you at it bring em’ in a size six
I take shorty’s shoes off
Like here try on these J’s make sure them shits fit
But in my head it gets thick, sayin'
Joey fall back, cause that's not your kid
I don’t know you lil nigga and plus I got a son of my own
But he’s at home and the ways he's being raised I don’t really condone
Naw, cause his pops been gone, fuck it
I'll explain it to him later when he’s grown
Old enough to have a phone
Askin' why mommy hate me
And he got the sneak to call me whenever he’s alone so
You wouldn’t know it but I got a soft spot for you
See, we would shared the same obstacles
Looking from the outside may seem like you neglect him
But when he slips up and calls me dad, I correct him
I protect him, when baby girl start ventin' about you I say, respect him
And though it seems out of order
My own mistakes have turned me into your biggest supporter
Fast forward, you wouldn’t believe
How I could love like mine what I didn’t conceive
Tryin' to help him reach shit what I never achieved
Am I doin' it for him or is it my own greed cause see
Me and my baby moms, we don’t do the conversations
Son cramped in the back, two bedroom shack
With seven people livin' there just congregatin'
So when your child with me, I’m over compensatin'
I’m talkin' eight bedrooms, seven baths
My son thinkin' that’s the shit that only heaven has
Mine's gotta keep it cool, yours get to see the view
White marble around the ground, heated pool
Mine's got to go to The Y
Shit, yours just got to walk outside
And the irony of it all, and it's just sad
Is you walked away yet, I’m the step dad
And then you get on Skype, sayin' how you being, whats the word
And I be on the background listenin' like
This motherfucker here got some nerve
He says, bye Daddy, I love you
I be wantin' to snuff you but wouldn’t want him thinkin' less of you
But, he's perceptive and this shit's wild
He picks up on everything and he's just a child
So through all my resistance
I’m afraid this two-year-old can already see the difference
He sees you don’t provide when you’re capable
Why we never fix things while were still able too
So you’re annoyed, it kinda of hampers me
Get my boy, I always wanted a family
Just to greet when I get to the door
You gon' have to take the L, I can't give you yours
I’ll do all the work, you ain't gotta be bothered
You can be his dad, I'll be his father
I relate though, so I know it hurts
Got to be uncomfortable when the roles reversed"

I'm from the jungle where the snakes is all poison
I am magnificent like Marcus
You might wanna fall back like August
Or ""late September,"" whatever you call it
I hit niggas in the head like Vonage
I am talking to no particular audience
But understand: I'm the guardian
And understand: There won't be no guarding him
You will just get played like an accordion
I don't give a damn if she's bossy
I keep pussy running like a faucet
She better catch like she Steve Largent
Because I'm ""What's up!?"" like Martin
[Interlude]
Hahaha
Woo!
Yeah! See—
I know y'all talking about me
And y—you don't like what you hear sometimes
But um... um, since I'm so bright
I'ma put the spotlight on you, baby

[Hook]
Show me what you 'bout, lil daddy
I know you need to stop, stop hatin'
I know what you not, whoadie
And that is Weezy Baby
Blunts up, now, blaze (Hey), blaze (Hey)
Blaze (Hey), blaze (Hey)

[Verse 2]
I'm working—Yeah!
Tell the world, ""Take six""
Young Dictionary, make words make sense
Then, I make cents make dollars
Make the skinny girl holler, make the fat girl hungry
Make the ugly girls want me, put the pretty girls on me
Make the shy girls horny, make the fly girls corny
And only for me
Because of who I A-M, holla back in the morning
Hey! Now holla back if you own shit
The CEO of the moment
Bullshit: I don't condone it
Aww, baby, just hop on it
[Interlude]
Hahaha
Yeah, ha
You like that
I know!
Marley, what up? Hey! Hey! Hey!

[Hook]
Show me what you got, lil mama
Show me what you got, pretty lady
Show me what you got, shawty
Show me what you got, baby
You rappers ain't safe, safe
Safe, safe, ahh!

Uh, we got the black elite in the house tonight
Rosewood
I feel like I'm at the NAACP or something right now
The Essence Festival
Q-Tip on the beat too, uh, uh

[Chorus: Kanye West]
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
They try to tell me my chain broke the levee
Maybe 'cause it's flooded
Why you walk around with a baby cross's cousin?
My teeth already white, y'all gon' make me floss for nothing
My teeth real diamonds, what's the cause of the frontin'?
Why y'all got all caps on?
Don Cheadle time, get extra black on 'em
Burn, Hollywood, burn
Take too long for niggas to get they turn
Probably be cremated before I get my earn
They try to tell me that aliens built the pyramids
I swear life's a bitch on her period
For every inch they cut the nose off the Sphinx
I make my jeweller add a few more links
You can look at me, tell I ain't fuck what nobody think
And my face always lookin' like somebody stinks
[Chorus: Kanye West]
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Alright, okay
Here we go, like we should
Like we should, like we should
Like we should

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Question:
What color was the skin of the man who beared the cross?
No matter how many lashes, they couldn't beat it off
How many Cassius' will we see in one lifetime?
That's why it's Miles Davis, Kobe, it's Mike time
I keep that GOAT book on the ottoman
And wrote hooks about slaves that was slaughtered
In the 1800s; y'all forget that
I got called ""Nigga"" on Twitter so many times, yo, I lived that
Now I'm just tryna find where to raise my kids at
'Cause they don't want niggas next to where they crib at
Hey, realtor, I'm lookin' for a nice park
Twelve noon, she said my family gon' make it too dark
This is the flow that solar eclipses
So hopefully one day that real soul will eclipse
The bullshit they got us listenin' to, in this existence
Don't give up now, just a little more persistence
I am the day Ice Cube met Michael Jackson
Keep 'em away, hanh! Something might happen
This is the makin' of a masterpiece
So we broke out the chains and told the master, ""Peace!""
[Chorus: Kanye West]
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy

Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Alright, okay
Here we go, like we should
Like we should, like we should
Like we should

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
Some wear a suit and tie, they don't wanna remain average
Some wear a suit and tie like a chain and a straitjacket
My chain heavy, stop in that traffic, coppers harass us
Then DA attack us, want us in chains like B.A. Baracus
So no major factor in my decision to be a rapper
Was rebellion; being anti-establishment was attractive
To a black kid from Brooklyn, flames got the thangs cooking
Land of the juks where them lames get them chains tooken
It ain't lookin' good for you if you're a tourist here
Sometimes I rhymes the sort of frequency that only purists hear
A couple rappers tried to beef with me, nobody's scared
Niggas was so fucking corny that nobody cared
Why I gotta battle rappers? I debate scholars
Question: do it gotta make sense if it make dollars?
Sick visions is living inside of brains
It's like we sadomasochistic, addicted to whips and chains
Figuratively, quite literally, clinically insane
Spit flames and then visit the higher plane
Try in vain to ignore it, don't buy the chain if you can't afford it
'Ye, them lonely-idled whores by the boards, trust
[Verse 4: Consequence]
That old ball-and-chain had me chained up for weeks
So of course I'm off the chain as soon as I hit the streets
And now when we link she saying the game's over
I drove her crazy and she became a chain smoker
Now the new dude she's saying that can stay over
Should be a chain, who goes by the name of Choker
That's what he did when she told him he should play the sofa
So the chains on the door, I'm on the way over
Now when I came over, his only response
Was, ""You must be the owner of a chain of restaurants
'Cause I'mma eat your food for that chain that I wore
'Cause you be running 'round like the chain make the man""
So it's obvious the he don't know the chain of command
'Cause my chain commands, that kind of respect
And it's so chunky that it's a pain in the neck
But it came with a check, I remember on chaining day
It spoke for itself and this is what the chain would say
""Them chain snatchers are hoping that you ain't ready
So don't get distracted, keep your aim steady
Or there'll be a chain reaction since my chain's heavy""

[Chorus: Kanye West]
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Alright, okay
Here we go, like we should
Like we should, like we should
Like we should"

Nah, we ain't done!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I love being hated, it's great, it lets me know that I made it
I wouldn't have it no other way, I wouldn't trade it for the world
Only let's me know that I'm loved
By so many other motherfuckers that ain't you, and it's bugged
'Cause you keep fucking with us, we keep fucking you up
And keep pulling the rug from up under you
And what's even more fucked up, is we enjoy what we're doing
So much there ain't nothing that we love more than ""Pulling Your Skirts Up""
And exposing you hoes so much, people are starting to wonder
What's up with them fucking Wonder Woman underoos?
Do unto others of you will have done unto you
So who the fuck you motherfuckers gonna run to
When someone runs up with a mask and puts a gun to you?
You gon' ask yourself, how come your mans
Didn't empty that last round that he had in Curtis Jackson's ass while he had the chance?
You keep asking us to keep it on wax but we can't
This is past any rationalization
We have captured national media attention
Conversation is senseless, you can sense the tension start building
Soon as we enter the 106 & Park building
Someone's gonna get killed and I swear to God
If someone so much as even touches one of my people
I'll put a million on his head
And you ain't got the funds to match or counteract it
But I'd rather rap than get into this gangsta shit
And it ain't because I'm a bitch
It's because I ain't a bitch, I don't endanger people that I'm with
I'm a general, I ain't Bush, I don't send my soldiers to war
I'm right there in the middle of the shit with 'em, so when I do get 'em
Orders to storm your headquarters, you'll be fucking with a
[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
Fucking with a beef keeper, see you ain't eager to greet this lyrical meat cleaver
That'll eat ya, niggas wanna keep speaking
Like it ain't even that deep
I got heat that'll sweep a nigga's street
See I wouldn't fuck with me neither, only heaven can help ya
I'll be searching for you longer than The Legend of Zelda
Without a failure, there's gonna be hell to tell the
Captain that a basset hound couldn't even smell ya
Body, when I hide ya, I be on that mob shit
You another Hoffa, under the Renaissance, bitch!
You get bombed like Lebanon with my own tactic
I snatch your head like one of Saddam's kids

[Verse 3: Obie Trice]
Motherfucker, I'll handle you, we can have it out on any avenue
An ""Average Man"" flipped into an animal
Shoot out your mandibles, cannons and ammunition
Reload with precision, nigga, know the mechanicals
Break the pistol down, you should see them handles
The street taught the child, no read up manuals
Pushing crack vows, young Nino Brown
Chasing green is the dream, when you're young and brown
Bound to be a problem child, look what I'm involved in now
A 'Dozen Dirty' niggas and they all get down
Resolve any problem that enlarge with ours
When revolvers we said ""all men get down""
(Kuniva!)
[Verse 4: Kuniva]
While you're punching and tackling punks
I'm handling chumps, packing a pump
That's longer than the elephant trunk
On the streets I'm a beast, I feast upon the weak
So speak beef, I'll shoot you and scream ""increase the peace""
A monster, pistol packing, pushing niggas off they Hondas
Stomp you, get it cracking, yanking bitches for they ganja
Sneaky as fuck, I don't think mama beat me enough
When she was sleeping stuff, I was stealing the keys to the truck
Shut the fuck up! Before you end up dead in the dump truck
Or in the streets taking a nap, bleeding and lugged up
""Who Want What?"" like M. Bleek, with this heat if you ten deep
Then fuck it, it will be ten sleeping

[Verse 5: Proof]
Know much'bout Meyer Lansky, don't tussle with my hand speed
Clutch your burner, bust it and watch your man bleed
We ferocious, toast no holsters
Approach us, throw heat straight from the shoulders
We the soldiers, yall the youngsters (ha)
Youngsters lungs puncture, dead in a dumpster
Upstairs the monsters, hand full of drama
You scared of the drama, bomber the monster (Boof!)
I'm back nigga (Proof!), I reappear
Shoot like, homie ain't seeing clear
Blackness, carcass covered with cat fish
We murkers with no purpose other than practice
(Bizzy!)
[Verse 6: Bizarre]
There's three things I hate: liars, fakes and cheaters
Alcoholics, sluts and fucking wife beaters
I guess that describes my life
I don't even know who song this is (Obie Trice)
Bitch, Bizarre don't give a fuck about no hip hop
At my release party in a pink tank top and Reeboks
This Ja Rule beef I ain't getting in
I'll need an R&B singer to sing at my wedding
I'll turn your face into a fucking meat patty
I'll fuck your mommy and go fishing with your granny
I'll Shit on You, I'll pee on R. Kelly, too
This is Bizarre, see you ""Devil's Night 2"""

Hate him or love him for the same reason (fresh)
Can't leave it, the game needs him
Plus the people need someone to believe in (yes)
So in God's Son we trust
'Cause they know I'ma give 'em what they want
They lookin' for a (hero)
I guess that makes me a (hero)

Another chapter of the cleanest rapper, distinguished gentlemen
Crooks & Castle on his back, Maybacher
Exotic lady eye-catcher, holla at ya, call me the chiropractor
Workin' like Muay Thai class, get perspire out ya
And of course I've been the boss since back when
Rockin' D Boy, Fila velour in one-ninety black Benz
Now they shut down the stores when I'm shoppin'
Used to be train robbin', face covered in stockin'—I'm him

Chain gleamin', switchin' lanes, two-seater
Hate him or love him for the same reason (fresh)
Can't leave it, the game needs him

Rubber-grip-holder, reloader
Come at me, I'ma rip your soldiers in half
Silverback ape, nickel-plated mag
Young, rich and flashy; young bitch, I'm nasty
All black clothes 'til ice lay on me so classy
And every time I close my lids
I can still see the borough, I can still see the Bridge
I can still see the dreams that my niggas ain't never lived to see
Tell them angels open the door for me
From nine Berettas and movin' raw
To chillin' in wine cellars, sticks and humidors
That's what I call mature
That's what I call a G, that's what I call a pimp
That's what I call a gangsta, to the fullest, shit
I try to make more cream
By every September 14th, that's my dream
So I can be more clean, as I grow yearly
I can see things more clearly, that's why they fear me (let's go!)

[Verse 3: Nas]
This universal apartheid, I'm hog-tied, the corporate side
Blockin' y'all from goin' to stores and buyin' it
First L.A. and Doug Morris was ridin' with it
But Newsweek article startled big wigs
They said ""Nas, why is he tryin' it?""
My lawyers only see the Billboard charts as winnin'
Forgettin' Nas the only true rebel since the beginnin'
Still in musical prison, in jail for the flow
Try tellin' Bob Dylan, Bruce or Billy Joel
They can't sing what's in their soul
So ""Untitled"" it is
I never change nothin', but people remember this
If Nas can't say it, think about these talented kids
With new ideas bein' told what they can and can't spit
I can't sit and watch it, so shit, I'ma drop it
Like it or not, you ain't gotta cop it
I'm a hustler in the studio, cups of Don Julio
No matter what the CD called, I'm unbeatable y'all, let's go!

Can you shit on me? I just want you to shit on me, Obie

Hey lady, hey darling, hey baby, I'm sorry
(I don't think you really wanna be my girl)
But I can't be, your boyfriend if you toy with
My mothafuckin' emotions
(Fucking with me could be dangerous)
I'll kill you, bitch I'm fucking for real, I'll make you suffer
(You never know what I may really be like in real life)
Like I suffered, if you fuck me, then I'll make you fall in love
(I'm the type, that might flip and get a little bit crazy)

[Verse 1: Obie]
Baby I'm extra large (huge) in magnitude
And Magnums the lubrication that I use
To chose which hole on a ho I abuse
Have 'em confused, can't tell who is who
When I fuck the shit out you, then the next day (bitch)
I'll rush the shit out you off my two-way (ooh wait)
You wanna cuddle, emotional hustle up on Pocono's
Poke ya nose in and outta Obie's own
No, I'm in and out your home
And this in, and out your tone
I ain't the nigga that settles 'em down
Put 'em in nice homes and floss 'em around
I bounce 'em around, camcord the sex
And sell 'em around town, how that sound?
If I was in love with ya, now you wanna clown?
Fuck with them clowns until I pound on your crown
Bust a few rounds and the cops come and get me
Bad mouth a nigga just to convince a jury
You don't want it with me, you just horny as me
You want a nut, nothing but what it should be
[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm internationally known baby but actually
There are few people who know how I am naturally
All you know is that I can act irrationally
When you shove a puppet up in my face on national TV
So they label me this crazed loony rap bully
But truthfully that ain't the truth and if you believe
In that shit then you'll believe anything's true
And you're too stupid to ever get to know me personally
But personally that actually works for me
Cause the last thing that I need's a string attached to me
I'm a bachelor, bitch, and I ain't in no fast fury
To run out and find a new Mrs. Mathers
Cause see, technically me and Kim ain't back fully
But we do still make booty calls occasionally
But be damned if I end up back in that pattern
And we end up back at that god damn tavern
And having another déjà vu, we seeing security
Pass my pussy around like it's Ja Rule's jewelry
I got news for you bitch, your new curfew's early
You ain't home by 2:30, [gunshot], you heard me?

Hey lady, hey darling, hey baby, I'm sorry

See you looking at the life, you looking at the lights
You looking at the ice, you ain't looking at the Trice
You should look at some advice when I say he ain't nice
Despite the fact you think you the feisty type
O love to fight, I love the drama
Love when my bitch get to cussing out Yolanda (fuck you, bitch!)
Find the Obie condom on the counter
Swinging her weave, can't breathe like I can't believe!
Least I ain't deceive and try to mislead
And sell a dream just to get you on my team
I came clean to keep down the beef
Keep down my reach, you can keep all your teeth, sweety

[Verse 4: Eminem]
See what we do under the covers
Should stay between the covers
And the two of us and we ain't gotta be news coverage
On the front page cover of Us as new lovers
But this is when a bitch get to showing her true colors
Cause the truth of it, everything that I do's public
And you'd love it if you could run and tell all your friends
Guess who you just screwed
As soon as me and you've done it
And save the used rubber to show 'em the proof of it
I guess it's do unto others as you'd have 'em do unto you
But you better be careful of who you're doing it to
Cause you never know when the shoe could end up
On the other foot and it backfires on you
Cause you may think you want it
Then you want me, til you get me
Then you got me and you're fucked
'Cause you'll be stuck with me
For the rest of your life cause if I get attached to you
We'll be joined at the hip, I'll be so latched to you
You'll be walking out the house and I'll run up and tackle you
Chain your ass up to the bed and shackle you
You don't think you're leaving this house in that, do you?
Not 'til I brand my name in your ass and tattoo you
And have you walking out this bitch in turtleneck sweaters
Scarves and full leathers in 90 degree weather
Front on me? Never cause we gon' be together forever
Right, bitch? Right, bitch?

You don't know McVay and I doubt if you understand me
Why would I give a fuck about you if we ain't family?
I roll with a chosen few and those of you that's behind me
Witness the most coldest, ferocious niggas that rhyme
These bitches turn they back on you, acting like they ain't did shit
When you rapping never mix business up with your friendship
If you lacking up in this jungle, then what you breathe for?
Niggas's don't love you, you got habits of breaking street codes
Far as static, I automatically get medieval
When I'm after people, then I'll explode you bitches with C-4
These hoes have no insurance, bodies get repo'
Making you vanish even when we ain't got our heat close
Keeping .44's where your hoes are swallowing deep throat

Doe Rae Me Hailies Revenge,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","[Intro: Eminem + Hailie]
Hailie, what do you want to be when you grow up, baby?
I don't know, but I don't want to
Grow up to be like Ja Rule's little dirty-ass kids
Ha ha, yeah, c'mon
G-G-G-G-G-G-G Unit
Hailie, come here, baby! Bring Daddy his Oscar!
We're gonna shove it up Ja Rule's ass

[Verse 1: Swift]
I'm about to get rid of some hoes, it's simple
I'm quick to murder ink with lead
And I ain't talking 'bout a pencil
Look at what the fuck you done got into
I see you found your niche, you just a bitch with a menstrual
Claiming you a murderer, and you spelled it wrong
You put E before the D, ‘cause that's all you on
You on Pac's dick, you a replica guy
If he was still alive, you would never get by
All you do is cry, bitch, keep it real
Life is more than imitating niggas and eating pills
And what kind of motherfucker ruins three deals
That another nigga got you? They didn't see skills
And I ain't playin', you a brother getting cheated
And Ja Rule be prayin' on his cover, ‘cause he need it
And all you niggas hating, shut your mouths!
It's just that real niggas ain't buying that shit y'all put out
[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
Doe, rae, me, but we don't sing, motherfuckers
So Murder Inc, do your thing, motherfuckers
You unleashed on a team
Who expects nothin' less than R&B coming from that regime
""Regime"" is a little extreme
Neck and neck with soldiers, motherfuckin' Marines
Ja sold his soul to sing
Weave eye-witness team on the TV screen, chase the greed
Now that you've embraced the green
Don't fuck with the triple beams
You's a motherfuckin' actor, slash Pac impersonating rapper
Slash Billie Holiday – how it happen?
Artist and repertoire saw him in action
Pac assassination, Def Jam grabbed him
Told him, ""Reenact him, you go platinum!""
They seen it for sure, I know that Afeni Shakur
Don't enjoy Jeffrey Atkins reenacting her boy
So I'm click-clackin' this toy, mash and destroy
Shady slash Aftermath and Detroit, motherfucker!

[Hook: Eminem]
Doe rae me, fa-so-la-ti-da
Don't blame me ‘cause you washed up, lost your spot
Mama-say-mama-sa-ma-macosa
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
Don't hate me, I'm too hot and you're not
Shooting at me, with the only shot you got
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop
[Verse 3: Kuniva]
Now, we can get past the mean mugs and get to the slugs
To the grievance and the crying and the intimate hugs
We don't take you serious, nigga, you shook
You half of a half-way crook; get off X dick, go sing a hook!
Nigga, and you can't replace the late great one
And when you gone you only gon' be the late fake one
Nigga, please stick to the script
Before the guns stick to the clip
And Benzino, you ain't shit but a bitch!
Fuckin' old-ass, ignorant, innocent-lookin' senior citizen
Built up, slap you like Grimace, all sensitive
Wait a minute, hold on: is it me, or do he look like a banana with braids and clothes on?
A bitch-made man; now, how you gonna connect
With them short ass arms, like a Tyrannosaurus Rex
You niggas can scream, holler and curse
Go ahead and respond
And pull that pen and pad up outta your purse

[Verse 4: Proof]
Slim didn't send Proof to get at the wankstas
He told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas
What up, Gotti? And this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the ground for stepping on bush stones
What's wrong? Didn't think we strong with real niggas?
Roll like a boss, in the streets they still feel us
It's real business, y'all ain't caught the concept
You talking nonsense to walking bomb threats
Contact was blown by Benzetta in The Source
Threaten at the boss, you gon' see me on your porch
Now Irv got the nerve to try to serve on us
But Detroit niggas early and ain't scurred to bust
[Verse 5: Kon Artis]
Word to my nigga Bugz, punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscious and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind ya? Cadillac Pac or that transvestite?
That dress like a Lil Kim fox
You're just like a little windbox
Press tight on the trigger of this Glock
Swallow that little shit you got left to help you eat
You knock Pac's songs without love to help you sleep
You got shot in your video trying mock Pac
You Mockaveli; get your own identity!

[Hook: Eminem]
Doe rae me, fa-so-la-ti-da
Don't blame me ‘cause you washed up, lost your spot
Mama-say-mama-sa-ma-macosa
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
Don't hate me, I'm too hot and you're not
Shooting at me, with the only shot you got
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop

[Over hook]
Don't you never say my little girl's name in a song again
Fuckin' punk-pussy bitch! I'll fuck you up, boy! Never!
Don't you never in your motherfuckin' life…
I'll choke the shit out of you little motherfuckin' midget
Hailie'll whip your motherfuckin' ass

[Outro: Obie Trice]
That's right, motherfuckers
Shady records, what you know about it?
Fuck Benzino! Fuck Ja Rule!
Nigga, this Obie Trice right here talkin' to you motherfuckers
Ja Rule punk ass, yeah, fuckin' Soul 4 Real ass
Nigga, that's Soul 4 Real
That the nigga from Soul 4 Real!
Candy Rain-ass nigga, he got a deal, now he rappin'
You don't know what's, faggot-ass motherfuckers
Get money to all my real niggas, man

Xzibit (Yeah)
E-Dub

[Verse 1: Xzibit]
It's that millenium ridiculous flow, I never let go
Niggas gettin' knocked out is part of my show
Let them know who they fuckin' with yo, a rhyme wrangler
Tri-angular push-up the hillside strangler
Dangle a, nigga by the ankle off the balcony
Now let his punk ass go, look out below (below)
It's a tale of two cities, come out when the sun go down
We officially not fuckin' around
Stuck in the ground, fitted with a suit in a pine box
With my fresh pressed khakis and a slingshot
So heatbox all day in a nigga face
And all you bitches see the dick that you should've ate

[Chorus: Xzibit]
Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fucking Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gotta put no extras on it
Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fucking Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gotta put no extras on it
[Verse 2: Erick Sermon]
Yo, I'm in the zone, and lyrically gone
Got the spot blown, (Boom) Oklahoma
Watch the aroma, catch those who love me
My underground dirty cats on dune buggies
I be the type to take your watch and flaunt it
Kidnap T. Lewis and Jimmy Jam on it
Yo, I bang a nigga head 'til his neck pop
Do a KRS-One to a ""Black Cop""
X and Es, out for the cream
Get the money, while you stay broker than Al Bundy
Uhh, give it to y'all, in ""Any Given Sunday""
With J. Foxx name the spot, make it hot
(I hate E so much right now)
Blow it down hooker bounce, come off the ropes like J. Snuka
(X: Two fly motherfuckers) You can't fuck with it
Backed by Open Bar, so y'all forget it

Call it what you wanna call it

Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gotta put no extras on it

J-McEnroe, cam smashin', party crashin'
I eat MCs like a ration
I'm sockin' niggas in their goatees
I leave you stiffer than that fool on my basketball trophies
I'm in the room with 10 Gs, counting ten Gs
'Cause we need a bag of weed (can you smell weed?)
Now we need ten dimes, to blow on deez like wind chimes
Time to close the blinds 'cause you all in mines
I bought a bottle for the session, and did not share it
Drink so much Captain Mo' all I need is a parrot
You took the Alkaholik challenge, and lost your balance
You underground, we under water drinkin' liquor by the gallons

[Verse 4: Tash]
Slurred words, double vision, brain bustin', head rushin'
If I'm too drunk to walk, I'll rock a party on crutches
And still rush the roughest MC who wanna get it
Forget it, it's Likwit, Tha Liks and, Xzibit
Ca-Tash on the blast the final piece to the puzzle
I slap bitches on the ass, I slap pits up out the muzzle
I shuffle with the microphone, bang rhymes consistent
You wack and I'm Ca-Tash and that's the motherfuckin' difference
For instance, ""21 and Over"" set your clocks back (Tick-tock-tick)
Still standin' where the rocks at
Two-thousand-one, we still young guns that's Restless
(Thirty niggas, sixty hoes) and that's the motherfuckin' guest list

Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fucking Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gotta put no extras on it
Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fucking Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gotta put no extras on it"

*Eminem pukes into the toilet*
*Eminem hocks and spits into the toilet*
*Toilet flush*
There I go, thinking of you again

[Hook]
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not kno-o-o-o-o-o-ow
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

[Verse 1]
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem
But off of the dome would probably be a little more
More suitable for this type of song, whoa
I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I could think of
Sixteen bars just ain't enough to put some ink to
So fuck it, I'ma start right here, I'll just be brief, I'm
'Bout to rattle off some of the reasons
I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo
Of you on my arm, but what do I go and do?
I go and get another one, now I got two (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Now I'm sitting here with your name on my skin
I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again
My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim (Shi-i-i-i-i-i-it)
If you only knew how much I hated you
For every motherfucking thing you've ever put us through
Then I wouldn't be standing here crying over you (Boo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-hoo)

You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach

You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

[Verse 2]
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter
But I thought a song would probably be a little better
Instead of a letter that you'd probably just shred up, yeah
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink to, a stupid piece of
Paper, I'd rather let you see how
Much I fucking hate you in a freestyle
You're a fucking cokehead slut, I hope you fucking die
I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye
I hate your fucking guts, you fucking slut, I hope you die (Di-i-i-i-i-i-ie)
But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad
It's not that I still love you, it's not 'cause I want you back
It's just that when I think of you it makes me wanna yack (A-a-a-a-a-a-ack)
But what else can I do? I haven't got a clue
Now I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to
But every time I think of you now all I wanna do is pu-u-u-u-u-u-uke

You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach

Big Weenie,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'alternative']","[Intro]
I don't understand
Why are you being so mean?
You're a mean, mean man

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Verse 1]
Alright, listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
Now I need you to open your mind, your eyes, close 'em
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes, we are going to explore
Into your mind to find out why you're so fucking jealous
Now why did they make yoo-hoo? Pippity-kaka-poo-poo
Psych, I'm kidding, I just wanted to see if you're still listening
Okay, now I need your undivided attention
Sir, I have a question, why do I always sense this undeniable tension?
From the moment that I enter into the room it gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever there's conversation, why am I always mentioned?
I've been dying to ask, it's been itching at me, is it just because...
[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Verse 2]
Alright now I (Shit), I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was, I fucked up
Psych, I'm kidding again, you idiot, no, I didn't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me is that I fucked up, ain't it?
But I can bust one take without looking at no paper
It doesn't take a bunch of takes or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth, okay? You're drooling, you have tooth decay
Your mouth is open, you're disgusting, what the fuck you eat for lunch?
A bunch of sweets or something? What, you munch a bunch of Crunch 'n Munch?
Your tooth is rotten to the gum, your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?
""Yes, I do, sir, what am I on?"" You, sir, are on truth serum
""Marshall, I'm so jealous of you, please say you won't tell nobody
I'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying all these terrible
Evil and awful mean things, it's my own insecurities""
[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Verse 3]
Alright, now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
'Cause that's exactly what your eyes look like, wanna check to see?
Here's a mirror, notice the resemblance here?
Wait, let me put these sunglasses on, now look in this mirror
How 'bout now? What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
You look like I sound like singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you, I know you're not happy
I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying
Curled up in a ball, tweaked out of my mind, dying, there's no denying
That my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
Why are you even doing this to yourself? It's pointless
Why do we have to keep on going through this? This is torturous
My point is this
That if you say mean things, your weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is, you're just as...
[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see

While you in your bubble bath I'll come wash on your back
When you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk
That's the swagger you come with when you come from New York
I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought
Separate me from the rest, I feel like I'm the best
If there's a price to pay for feelin you I pay that twice
I'm as ghetto as it gets girl you know that's right
I ain't got nothin to hide baby I tell you my secrets
'Fore you end up bein 'round long enough to peep shit
I get closer to you, I mean closer than close
I get into you, after I take off my clothes
Girl I been into you, mentally long before

[Intro]
Hey, I got a dollar and a dream
It's all a nigga got so it's about that green
And I'm all up in that spot, hey

[Verse 1]
Yeah, the mental state of a young black genius conflicted
The fast life I done seen on the screen is addictive
Money and clothes I done dreamed about
And all the hoes that I fiend about
Ay, tell me am I wrong for visualizing material shit I never had?
Waving gats instead of flags, the American Dream
Why do we cling to the villains, knowing they kill 'em?
My niggas high enough to swing from the ceiling
Ink from the pen spilling on my notebook
Filled with dreams, this is my hope book
Still the screams from little girls shot and killed fill my head on the daily
At times I question God, can you blame me? They can’t tame me
My voice screech through the streets, I'm a beast on 'em
Oh no, he will not fold, you will not see a crease on him
He will not slip or lose his grip, they got them cleats on him
But never will he run unless you call police on him
[Chorus]
One time, two times, three times
Sometimes I scrap, sometimes I'm throwin' up the peace sign
It's two sides to a nigga though
I said it's two sides to a nigga, yo
Ay look, sometimes I'm feeling high then I'm feeling low
Lord, will I die? Will I survive? Let a nigga know
You say you know me but what side did you get to know?
It's two sides to a nigga, yo, yo, yo

[Verse 2]
Yeah, some pussy niggas pulled out on me and my mans
Wasn’t for the pistol, we drop 'em right where he stands
But still we never ran, foolish pride made us stand right there
Not understanding we could lose our life there
And then it hit us, thinking 'bout the close calls from long distance
Uh, as lil niggas in the 'Ville, we was trippin
Type of nosy ass niggas to watch the fight until it's over
They ran when the gats came out, I moved closer
Foolish, what was I thinking? Wasn’t trying to be cool, it's
Just the thrill of the danger, get so filled up with anger
When a stranger get to violating
He sleeping on me wide awake, bitch I'll annihilate him
I'm tired of waiting on my ticket out this muh'fucker
Hope they don’t kill me before I get up out this muh'fucker
I gotta go, now can I be that nigga I thought I was? I gotta know
Will I make it like I thought I would? I gotta blow
[Chorus]
One time, two times, three times
Sometimes I scrap, sometimes I'm throwin' up the peace sign
It's two sides to a nigga though
I said it's two sides to a nigga, yo
Ay look, sometimes I'm feeling high then I'm feeling low
Lord, will I die? Will I survive? Let a nigga know
You say you know me but what side did you get to know?
It's two sides to a nigga, yo, yo, yo

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I seen Heaven, seen Hell, the two faces of the Ville
One side dreams, the other side's real
One side schemes, the other side deals
What the pain brings, another mother cry still
Why the fuck am I here, God?
That nigga died, why the fuck am I still alive?
I feel ashamed 'cause the good Lord done brought all this success to me
And all I seem to focus on is all this stress on me
Blessed homie, we breathin', cold world got me sneezing
Wrote this when I was broke, so hey, I guess we even
Throwin' blows, fighting demons, tryna stop from bustin' semen
In an unfamiliar bitch, I know my niggas feel this shit
How could I fuck her raw? And I just met the ho
My dick took over, it ain't never felt this wet before
I'm stressing in my mind but its way to late to stop it
Make this shit so bad, I had a condom in my pocket
Lets change the topic, before I go berserk, I’m so alert
Riding down 95, nah, I ain't finna to go to work
I’m headed back home, ain't staying that long
I’m chasing dreams shawty, I'm paying back loans
I’m paying dues that a nigga paying tax on
I'm tryna blow like a nigga playing saxophone
I'm playing daddy to another nigga daughter
Don’t worry, even Jesus never saw his real father
It don’t bother me at all though
Yeah, say it don’t bother me at all
They got me thinking 'bout my mom though
Man, I can't wait to sing this song
I'll be like, I'll be like
[Outro]
Hey, don’t cry, hey, oh no
'Cause we ain't gotta worry 'bout the money no more
We ain't gotta worry 'bout how the bills get paid
We ain't gotta worry how the meals get fed
Don’t cry, hey, oh no
'Cause we ain't gotta worry 'bout the money no more
We ain't gotta worry 'bout how them bills get paid
We ain't gotta worry how the meals get fed
Hey, hey, hey"

Lot of people, you know what I'm sayin'?
That be gettin' misinformed, thinkin' everythin' is everythin'
You could just get yourself a little deal, whatever
You know what I'm sayin'?
You gonna get on, you gonna get rich
And all these labels be tryin' to lure us in like spiders into the web
You know what I'm sayin'?
So sometimes, people gotta come out and speak up

Tommy ain't my motherfuckin' boy!
When you fake moves on a nigga you employ
We'll all emerge off your set, now you know God damn

And Ruff up the motherfuckin' House 'cause I smother
You Cold Chillin' motherfuckers, I still Warner Brother
I'm Ruthless, my clan don't have to act wild
That shit is Jive, an old Sleeping Bag Profile
The soft comedian rap shit ain't the rough witty
On the reel to reel, it wasn't from a Tuff City
Niggas be game, thinkin' that they lyrical surgeons
They know they mic's a phone to Virgin

That's like goin' to Venus drivin' a Mercury

From East, West to ATCO, I bring it to a Next Plateau
But I keep it phat, though
Yo, I'm hittin' batters up with the Wild Pitch style
I even show an Uptown MCA style
Who thought he saw me on 4th & Broadway
But I was out on the Island, bombin' MC's all day
My Priority is that I'm First Priority
I bone the secret out a bitch in a sorority
So look out for A&M, the Abbot and the Master!
Breakin' down your Pendulum

Farewell,J. Cole,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz']","[Intro]
Yeah, farewell
Hey, farewell
All my niggas farewell
Fayettenam

[Verse 1]
Look, some niggas let their dirt out, some just keep it all in ‘em
So when a man dies all his secrets go with him
And fade, a part of history no longer known
Done did a lot of dirt I’ll bury with me when I’m gone
When my story’s told, how will they tell it?
Will they say I was a giver or remember I was selfish?
Will they say I was a sinner or pretend I was a saint?
Will I go down as a winner, what's the picture they gon' paint?
Wouldn’t say that I’m a quitter, that's one thing I know I ain't
Will they tarnish, will they taint? Glorify me, over-think?
Say they know me, say I’m great? Say I’m phoney, I was fake?
Say the things about me that they never told me to my face?
I was loved I was hated, just a nigga with a dream
I’m a liar, I was honest, I was all of these things
When I’m gone let em talk, they discussing who I am
When they bury me just know I wasn't nothing but a man
Wasn’t nothin’ but a man
[Chorus]
This for them niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
Yeah, hey farewell
Yeh, hey farewell
This for niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
I pray you farewell
I bid you farewell
Yeah, hey, farewell
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
If I should die Lord this here is my will
Reincarnate a nigga send me right back to the Ville
Let me relive my younger days just once again
Reenact my memories from every friend to every sin
Keeping demons buried in my closet
But yet I put in work like a deposit on my bank account
My eyes lit while I think about my childhood now I'm blanking out
Those were truly my best days
The only thing I had to stress was how the hell to get laid
Gradually turn into me stressin’ how the hell to get paid
Been making songs so long, now how the hell they get played
Ok, I’m blowing up quickly, I guess the flow is sickly
But yet I can’t forget my past and hope it won’t forget me
Got good grades but A's can’t stop strays so pray for me
Pour liquor for my niggas but hey, don’t wait for me
'Cause I’m trying to cheat death, she out to bury my ass
You know the cliche “life's a bitch” well I’m gon marry that ass
And sign a prenup, think back to when we tore the skating rink up
Rapping and we scrapping, we got older hit the teen club
Gave mean mugs to niggas but we winked to all the girls
Then we went back to the crib thinking we had saw the world
No sir, came a long way from having momma chauffer
It's hard to think these hoes at some point were so pure
But now we play the game, when it's over send me back
I swear I’m not gon change a thing
I swear I’m not gon change a thing
[Chorus]
This for niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
Yeah, hey farewell
Yeh, hey farewell
This for niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
I pray you farewell
I bid you farewell
Yeah, hey, farewell
Yeah, yeah"
Too Deep for the Intro,J. Cole,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop']","[Produced by J. Cole]

[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, ahem
Hey, yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Partially functional, half of me is comfortable
The other half is close to the cliff, like Mrs. Huxtable
These boys got them holsters and clips they pack like Lunchables
Like white boys in grade school, while we ate school-made food
Just eyeing they shit, wish I was trying they shit
Knowing when mama hit the store, she wasn’t buying that shit
No, I ain't crying a bit, man that's just life, that's how that shit work
You reach your hand in fire, you pull it back when you get burnt
Gotta learn when you get hurt, even if it's with Cupid
He beat you and you went back, you's officially stupid
Oh yeah, I understand, that's your man, you had a plan
You been together for some years, you sticking with him for the kids
So you overlook the tears, but we both know that's a bad look
'Cause 20 years from now, your daughter'll probably get her ass whooped
Look, if this too deep for the intro, I’ll find another use
But just in case it's perfect, let me introduce, Cole
[Chorus: Erykah Badu & J. Cole]
Time to save the world
Where in the world is all the time?
So many things I still don't know (Uh-uh, hey)
So many times I've changed my mind
Guess I was born to make mistakes
But I ain't scared to take the weight
So when I stumble off the path (Yeah)
I know my heart will guide me back (Yeah)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Man, is this too deep for the intro? If so, I’ll find another use
But just in case it's perfect, let me introduce
It’s Cole, I had a dream and so I made a move
A ill ass nigga who just so happened to stay in school
Still rap for hustlers and motherfuckers that hated school
Said, ""That's for busters,"" then heard my shit and I made it cool
It's safe to say that I’m gifted as if I’m Christmas shopping
I got gangsta niggas lining up in admissions office
Ayy, possibly 'cause all the hoes a nigga scraped
A lot of shit up on my plate, so you know a nigga late
To my first class, I’d much rather sit up in first class
Should I admit that a slutty bitch was my first smash?
Wasn't experienced, so nah, I didn't wear it out
Always thought my first time would be someone I cared about
But being a virgin was something to be embarrassed 'bout
I used that ass for practice, so I wasn't scared out my mind
You call it rhymes, I call it clearing out my mind
Was just a young boy staring out my blinds
'Til I got free from my mama leash
Running loose through the streets like a stray dog in heat
And we looking for some freaks, can you play? Pardon me
What's your name? Don’t mistake me for no lame, no, not me
She knew I was on the team 'cause she seen how tall I be
In the club dappin’ niggas, eventually, R.I.P
Damn, you win some, you lose some, that's just how it happens
And if a nigga step up to you, then you gotta scrap 'em
Your name is all you got, throwing hands by the bathroom
It's funny, I barely told nobody I started rapping
'Cause see, some niggas was haters that I just viewed as clowns
At fourteen, I knew I was the nicest dude around
I gotta make a move, I gotta do this now
If they don’t know your dreams, then they can't shoot 'em down
[Interlude: J. Cole]
Ha, yeah nigga, hell yeah
I felt that one in my fuckin' soul, nigga
Haha

[Outro: Erykah Badu]
Ooh, hey
I'm trying to decide
Which way to go
Think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere
Ooh, hey
I'm trying to decide
Which way to go
Think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere"
The End,Kid Cudi,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'alternative', 'jazz', 'blues', 'rock']","[Chorus: Nicole Wray]
I’d never do it again, do it again
I’d never do it again
Cuz this is the end, this is the end
This is the end
I’d never do it again (hey), do it again (hey)
I’d never do it again (hey)
Cuz this is the end

[Verse 1: GLC]
My brother told me a long time ago
Don't focus where you been, G, focus where you tryna go
I swear the game make you cold like abominable
Snowman, old man, when you trying to shine like gold
When it's my time to blow partner I'mma know
In the midst of getting dough I was hit with highs and lows
My Melo tried to play me like my fucking eyes was closed
Now I'm sittin here wishing that my guys didn’t know
They love a G, so they despise a soul
What they gon’ do to him, beyond my control
When the reaper calls, it's your time to go
Never play a nigga when you see that he is trying to grow
I'm Benny Blanco when he knocked out Carlito
And Pachanga so I'm watching every angle
Under the moonlight with the devil I've tangoed
Church on the move like Jesus in the manger
Better control the money, it's better to control the anger
So now I watch a friend the way that I watch a stranger
(Chu'ch)
[Chorus: Nicole Wray]
Do it again, I’d never do it again
Cuz this is the end, this is the end
This is the end
I’d never do it again, do it again
I’d never do it again
Cuz this is the end, this is the end
This is the end (uh), I’d never do it again

[Verse 2: King Chip]
Chillin', rolling up something to change my feelin'
Thinkin' about how I came up from nothing while I’m splittin'
This cigarillo, phone rings I get a call
One of my dogs tripping hard talkin about really killin them all
I say slow down, slow down, what the fuck you mean nigga
Just ran in your crib and popped your daughter in the spleen
I’ll be there in 20 minutes, but it only took fifteen
We wasn’t that tight, but cool enough for me to hit the scene
Not knowing this was all a set up, secretly they want me wet up
Jealous of my future cheddar, however
They fastest move was too slow for me
I pulled up, wasn’t no ambulance, there wasn’t no police
Something fishy going on, naive, kept pressing on
Nine gripped, thinking the killer could still be on the lawn
Opened the front door, they shot, I shot, someone dropped shit
The nigga with something to lose just almost lost it
Won't trust him again
[Chorus: Nicole Wray]
Do it again, I’d never do it again
Cuz this is the end, this is the end
This is the end
I’d never do it again, do it again
I’d never do it again
Cuz this is the end, this is the end
This is the end, I’d never do it again

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
Cheese came through at 3
Salute, at ease, C had supplied the weed
Cause IBN had OD'd
It's me with a black rockstar steeze
Real rock tees, 300 a pop for these
Please, bummy? You don’t know me money
Day & Nite got flipped and I got blow for a grip
Sipping on a Heine with my Jamie-boo beside me
That's my fucking best friend
When I'm tweaking she be calming a brother
Like the touch from a mother
I am so damn comfortable I never want to leave it
The feeling is something like a spiritual healer
That could end me, I think that’s the part I find intriguing
A little bit off, I am, I am, I am
I see that I'm caught, I am, I am, I am
It’s something like a spiritual healer that could end me
I think that's the part I find intriguing, I'm fiending

0% Finance,GZA,['hip hop'],"[Verse 1]
I took her off the showroom floor no money down
Near the Chrysler building in the heart of Midtown
200 horse-power under the hood
Junk in the trunk very far from damaged goods
Designer frames with windshields that stay tinted
The most beautiful thing someone invented
Her wrangler had a sticker on the bumper
A sign in case tow trucks tried to dump her
Rear view mirror that of Serena William
Staring was a crime then the look, kill 'em
Brushless showers and the Brazilian wax
Cash in the glove compartment free from tax
Low mileage on the odometer
Graduate with more degrees than a thermometer
Spark plugs for great conversation
She would focus on the finish line and destination
Steering in the right direction
Made sure I wore seat belts had air bags for protection
In her tank she loved to stash my tool
I kept her full, super-unleaded fuel
She had a room full of skirts and rims
The old ones used to swing off ropes that often hung from limbs
A temp at the Ford modeling agency
Suburban area where the Caucasians be
Her great-grandfather was a Cherokee Indian
Explorer and navigator traveling then begin
Sharpening his arrows on Plymouth Rock
Commander-in-chief who raise cattle on the selling of livestock
King of the frontier, rider of thoroughbreds
He was just as sharp as a needle without thread
Legend in truth but known to run the herd
His sons were oldsmobiles who drank thunderbird
Land cruisers sitting on fertile soil
With equipment that ran off expensive oil
Folks bragging said the horse pulled a Volkswagen
They love mustang sally and lollygagging
Fished in Lake Tahoe cooked the barracudas
Hunted impalas with the six-shooters
From a long range with the dog Rover
It was something else to see 'em knock them over
[Verse 2]
Some got caught in the crossfire
Bunch of Mavericks indicating these dudes should retire
One was going bald rocking a sunroof
A gas guzzler in his grill was one tooth
A strong accent, and a beard like Lincoln
Who hated the golf course, but he loved drinking
Avenger, used to pick up chicks
Had magnums that were ram tough but thick
He wore blazers where he used to hide the Ruger
For encounters with the jaguars and cougars
A veteran who could salute and sing the anthem
In accord with the plan he was the phantom
He had a fat lady they called hummer
And umm, she needed body work the whole summer
She had a few friends who used to stay in a pound
Abandoned the parking lots, and junk yard bound
Regulars in rest areas and truck stops
Cassette players, known to make the tape pop
Gold diggers who on the cream like Wells Fargo
In Vegas, they circle around the Monte Carlo
You know the snakes with the fangs and vipers
Bloodsuckers who all used to piss from diapers
Met the Cavaliers at the Outback steakhouse
Chicken cutlets supreme just for takeout
One of them was forced to live in Astoria
Cause at the auction, they had crowned victoria
Since then her friends charged her battery
Had her running off with the sweets of flattery
She kept a loud muffler, couldn't trust her
Police used to always pull over this duster
A pothead who some called a firebird
A foul mouth, who could have used wiser words
Her man used to hustle and ran a crack corner
So insecure he kept LOJACK on her
Creeping with his visors low, high-beaming
Temper would accelerate, private eye scheming
He would check her consoles for rubbers
She would pass the inspection with flying colors
She would turn left if he said right
On her cycle, he would often run red lights
His voiced echoed as she dodged the convo
-----""PROTOOLS""-----

Her previous owner, all he did was bone her
Some drove her crazy, she was just a loner
He had her leaking transmission fluids
Said it was an accident, didn't mean to do it
No insurance with her grill decayed
She sobbed uncontrollably, still stayed
Another total eclipse of the heart
Like the freezing weather that never gave her a start
Plus he had a sidekick in his garage
And if he needed a boost, she would give him a charge
He was sentenced for running an escort service
Escaped from prison but made a few nervous
His baby mother had wifed a BMW
Number one on the list, so he brought trouble to
She done everything to regain her liberty
Tried to be Audi, but went into delivery
Moved to Aspen, survived a avalanche
A different element, inside a fatter ranch
Far away, when she changed the pattern
The distance was like from Mercury to Saturn"
Hell of a Life,Kanye West,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'alternative']","[Verse 1]
I think I just fell in love with a pornstar
Turn the camera on, she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners, do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache, uh
Make her knees shake, make a priest faint, uh
Make a nun cum, make her cremate, uh
Move downtown, cop a sweet space, uh
Livin' life like we won the sweepstakes, what?
We headed to hell for Heaven's sakes, huh
Well, I'ma levitate, make the devil wait, yeah

Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby, we'll live a hell of a life

Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams, in your wildest
You could hear the loudest screams
Comin' from inside the screen, you a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal, or do a gangbang
It's kinda crazy that's all considered the same thing
Well, I guess a lotta niggas do gangbang
And if we run trains, we all in the same gang
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby, we'll live a hell of a life

One day, I'm gon' marry a pornstar
We'll have a big-ass crib and a long yard
We'll have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin' to hide, we both screwed the bridesmaids
She wanna roleplay 'til I roll over
I'ma need a whole day, at least roll doja
What party is we goin' to on Oscar day?
'specially if she can't get that dress from Oscar de
La Renta, they wouldn't rent her, they couldn't take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her, ""Get away""
How could you say they live they life wrong?
When you never fuck with the lights on

[Bridge]
Fuck with the lights
Fuck with the, with the lights on
Fuck with the lights
Fuck with the, with the lights on
Fuck with the lights on

Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby, we'll live a hell of a life

I think I fell in love with a pornstar
And got married in the bathroom
Honeymoon on the dance floor
And got divorced by the end of the night
That's one hell of a life

Love Me,"Obie Trice, 50 Cent & Eminem","['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'jazz', 'alternative', 'blues', 'rock']","[Intro: Obie Trice]
You don't see me in the hood
That's 'cause I'm doin' this, man

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Niggas, I'm still grindin' (Yeah), I still hearin' those sirens
I'm still gettin' chased by those lights
Only the light's lime, and my mic's on
And my time is none, because I'm writin' more
And I ain't here to meet a soul in this business
I'm here to eat, speak, until these hoes feel this (For sure)
And I can't let y'all derail me, man
I got Young Kobie, homie, you gotta let go of Obie
'Cause Obie be back (Going nowhere, man)
We got them craps goin' on and that 'ac goin' on
Soon as a nigga touch down, back from tourin'
It's whatever (Whatever, man), put that on the cheddar, man
But in the meantime, it's Jimmy Iovine time (Show 'em)
Chase cheese, rhyme 'til my voice give out (Show 'em)
This is it my niggas, this what we boast about
Now I'm here, so shut your motherfuckin' mouth
And show me love, bitch
[Chorus: Sample & Obie Trice]
I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life (I don't love you, bitch)
I wanna hold you in the mornin' (Ha-ha)
Hold you through the night (Ha-ha, right)
I just wanna love ya (We wanna love alcohol)
For the rest of my life (We wanna love guns)
I wanna hold you in the mornin' (We wanna love money, ha)
Hold you through the night (We don't wanna love no bitches, though)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
There's a certain mystique when I speak, that you notice, that's sorta unique
'Cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep
And I'm Stillmatic, the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like tryna smoke crack and go to sleep
I'm strapped, it's known any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry, it ain't even money
You can't pay me enough for you to play me, it's cockamanie
You just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clock's cuckoo
I got screws loose, yeah, the whole kit and caboodle
I'm just brutal, it's no rumor, I'm numero uno
Assume it, there's no humor in it no more, you know
I'm rollin' with a swollen bowlin' ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass
You better love me, bitch
[Chorus: Sample & Obie Trice]
I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night (And all the bitches say)
I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night

[Verse 3: 50 Cent & Eminem]
My buzz is crazy in the hood, they holla my name
If it ain't about the flow, it's 'bout the stones and the chain (Yeah!)
If I was you, I'd love me too, I roll like a boss
911 Porsche same color as cranberry sauce (Woo!)
I ain't gon' front, I thought R. Kelly was the shit (Huh-uh)
Let me find out he fuckin' 'round with Bow Wow bitch
Niggas eatin' popcorn right, rewindin' the tape
Now shorty mama in precinct, hollerin' rape
I'm convinced, man, somethin' really wrong with these hoes
I thought Lil' Kim was hot, 'til she start fuckin' with her nose (God-damn!)
I used to listen to Lauryn Hill, and tap my feet
Then the bitch put out a CD and didn't have no beats (Huh-uh)
That boy D'Angelo, he determined not to fail
That nigga went butt-ass, for his record to sell
My back shots'll help Ashanti hit them high notes
And Big been taught Charli B'More to deep-throat (Yeah)
[Chorus: Sample & 50 Cent]
I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life (I love the burners, the money)
I wanna hold you in the mornin' (The bunnies, I just wanna hold you, ha-ha-ha)

I wanna hold you in the mornin' (I just wanna love you)
Hold you through the night (Yeah!)"
Spend Some Time,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Eminem]
If there's any bitches in this room
Then there's somethin' I gotta say
For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way
I've been down that road
And now I'm back, sittin' on square one
Tryin' to pick myself up where I started from

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
I never woulda thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though my penis was deep down in your hole
You should know, between us, we was like mates of soul
Nothin' could intervene us, especially no hoes
You was more so the chalant type I chose
'Til more shows, haunted you nights, I suppose
That's how it go: with time spent, emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinnin', then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches they gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire and—
[Hook: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducin' you to my daughters
'Til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you recall, I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked, I refused to even take my jewelry off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd, but it turned me on
You started gettin' moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who'da even knew that? Who would'a even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them Goddamn darts at me?
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it, it's too hard to see
'Til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life-altering
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring
[Hook: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)

[Interlude: Stat Quo]
Ha, ha, yeah right, bitch
Spend some time on my dick

[Verse 3: Stat Quo]
In most cases, Stat's attitude is, ""Fuck a bitch!""
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was different, thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in pub-a-lic
We sufferin' because of this
Shawty on some whole 'nother other shit
Tryin' to play slick, thinkin' I'ma trick off grip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit
Feedin' you the best of me, I should've fed you piss
We started off closer than close
But who could've predicted to know
Your trifling ways would'a stopped our growth?
And the final result, back in that same boat
I asked myself: ""Do I love these hoes?"" — Nope!
[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
(Yeah) Em introduced us: ""50, this is Tanya, Tanya, this is 50""
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said, ""You have very nice lips.""
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan, on the balcony, stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist too
Why talk, when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Said she's an aspiring actress, she do videos for practice
Yeah, yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit? (Ha-ha!)

[Hook: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine"
