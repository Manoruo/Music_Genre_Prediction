Classic Shit,Stat Quo,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah! Come on! Come on!
ATL! Yeah! Haha! WOO!
If you feel like you've been touched
By our music that is

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Nowadays everybody just wanna poke their nose in our business
What is this some kinda joke?
Man, everywhere I go all I’m hearing is more talk
""What’s up with Jada and Fat Joe?
Doing a song with ol’ boy on a song “New York”
Man, I thought you just did a song with them both?”
Man, the streets wanna know how you gonna go and diss Michael
You should get your ghetto pass revoked
I never had no ghetto pass, you asshole
You really wanna know, when I did live in the ghetto
I kept a trespassing charge up at the railroad tracks
So I suggest you get your facts straight before you go
This assuming to know
I ain't grow up in no trailer park just cause I was poor
Man, this is my testimo...ny to those that don’t know
Me, and feel like they do
If not to feel compelled to go and speak on me too
So this dick goes to YOU and this dick goes to YOU
And if you feel like you want it then you can get it too
And when your through pass it to the person next to you
Ayo, Stat get on the mic and come and spit a few
[Verse 2: Stat Quo]
Motherfucker's so quick, to spit bullshit
Stat Quo, who’s this, Em gave me the assist
Shorty got a full clip, standing in the pulpit
A–Town misfit, repping that south shit
Back four or some years ago, foe was hating, I hear them
My flow is skating across the track, rollerblading
Losing patience, want to get on chasing but this taking all my energy
Tired of waiting, people faking fronting like they kin to me
When they're really enemies, give a fuck what it is
Cuz, this what it gonna be, Shady/Aftermath lately
GMM, baby, young nigga out them projects Thomasville
Grady hospital, Freida’s only baby
Niggas biting my style get rabies
Fuck you, pay me, eat a cock, swallow shit
And plus you ain't fucking with this, so don’t trip, ha ha
Them little boys see it, what an incredible twist
I write incredible script
That fit in with the plot it’s endless
Now testify to this
Let it bang when you hear, this is classic shit"
I Miss My Dawgs,Lil Wayne,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
This is the Carter muthafucka, yeah
And in my building, I must keep it real

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
And man I miss the times
We would shine, you would keep on your side
You would teach me how to ride
And you would teach me how to pride
Then we'd get on the line and go over our lines
We were in the same position
And that's when you changed position, shit
I never changed and I miss ya, and it's strange
But I never forget ya
Though that ain't you with them bitches homie
And I know that ain't you wit that dissin on me, that's why I
Never replied and never will, just let em live phony
If ya ever died, I swear to God, I got yo kids homie
What's mine is theirs, I gotta give homie, and yea
We still a army in this bitch homie
Yeah Cash Money still the shit homie, shit, homie!
What's really real is you feelin me nigga
That Hot Boy shit still in me nigga, word to giggity nigga
And I ain't got time to speak the history
I miss you and I know you missin me, Gizzle, but
[Chorus: Reel]
Man, I miss my dawgs, many nights club poppin
Many nights we were blowin trees, many nights we were hustlin
Man I miss my dawgs, me and you through thick and thin
Me and you through the very end, for only you I'll sin again
Man, I miss my dawgs, many nights club poppin
Many nights we were blowin trees, many nights we were hustlin
Man I miss my dawgs, me and you through thick and thin
Me and you through the very end, for only you I'll sin again

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
And I remember when you came to the clique
I had already made my name in the clique
But you got famous and shit
I got my soulja rag and dangled my shit
I was honored just to hang wit you, shit
And I banged to the boogie-bang-bang with ya clique
And I ain't even from the 3, my hood was angry at me, shit
But I rose to my feet, played the post with the heat
At them shows while you performed and posed
I was waitin for a nigga to jump, see I was patient
But was ready to dump, cuz you my brother, chump
Real Gs never buckle up
But every family ain't filled wit gangstas that's real
And that's real and I would never turn my back
Or turn ya down, even if you turned around, muthafucka
But history is history
I miss you and I know you missin me, Juvie, but
[Chorus: Reel]
Man, I miss my dawgs, many nights club poppin
Many nights we were blowin trees, many nights we were hustlin
Man I miss my dawgs, me and you through thick and thin
Me and you through the very end, for only you I'll sin again
Man, I miss my dawgs, many nights club poppin
Many nights we were blowin trees, many nights we were hustlin
Man I miss my dawgs, me and you through thick and thin
Me and you through the very end, for only you I'll sin again

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
You was my nigga, my nerve, my joy, my hurt
My main muthafuckin man Turk (oh!)
My other, my partner, I was teacher, he was father
I skilled, he schooled, we chilled, we moved
We thug, we hung, we ate, we slept
We lived, we died, I stayed, you LEFT!
Remember how we played to the left?
And we stayed out of trouble 'cause we stayed to our self
'Member Slim and B would leave and hand the keys over?
Tell us not to go Uptown and we went straight to tha Nolia
While I watched you reunite wit yo souljas
And yo mom and brothers, while I lied to the Stunna
Yeah, those were the times my brother
Now I recognize real and I eye my brother
Yeah, nigga, Semaj my brother, the Sqad's my brother
The niggas you left behind is my brothers!
[Chorus: Reel]
Man, I miss my dawgs, many nights club poppin
Many nights we were blowin trees, many nights we were hustlin
Man I miss my dawgs, me and you through thick and thin
Me and you through the very end, for only you I'll sin again
Man, I miss my dawgs, many nights club poppin
Many nights we were blowin trees, many nights we were hustlin
Man I miss my dawgs, me and you through thick and thin
Me and you through the very end, for only you I'll sin again"
Drake - Over My Dead Body ft. Chantal Kreviazuk Traduction Française,Genius Traductions Franaises,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: Chantal Kreviazuk]
How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
Cause you know I'm okay
And still, I ask myself, ""Why do you worry ?""
When you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body...

[Verse 1]
I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man
Fuck it, I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club (mm-mm)
Fuck it, I was wrong though
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes I'm 'bout to take the hint from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again ?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again ?
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again ?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in ?
Man all of your flows bore me #PaintDrying
And I don't ever be trippin' off of what ain't mine
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
Yeah...It's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I ain't even notice I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You say I'm old news, well who the new star ?
Cause if I'm going anywhere, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing dead time
Shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
Oh, you wanna be a motherfucking funny guy ?
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart, boy
Yeah.. it's whatever
You know, feeling good - living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it !
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like I've been here before, huh ?
I still got 10 years to go, huh ?
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right
[Hook]

[Outro]
Three in the morning still going down…"
Annakins Prayer,Jay Electronica,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse - Jay Electronica]
Look at this [bitch]
Smilin' in a nigga's face, I hate her
I can drill a hole at the Earth's equator
Fill it with dynamite and make another Moon with craters
See you later
She ain't know, that innocent shit with Obi-Wan
Behind a Jedi back can turn Anakin to Vader, [bitch]
Your lack of faith in the Force is disturbin'
And if it wasn't Jack Daniels and Parliament
Lights it would have been murder
My eyes is red like ketchup
Tired of playin' catch up
Layin' on the floor starin' at the dresser
Got on my knees and prayed 'till they bleed
Dear God, I'm a sick motherfucker
I even fooled myself I'm a slick motherfucker
I'm sick of the scandulous livin'
I don't think I'm even equipped for a higher standard of livin'
But if you give him one more chance and forgive him
He'll push that negative gene into oblivion
Here's what I'll do:
Put you in this basket and float you down the Mississippi
Twenty miles from the Bayou
Here's grace, here's style
Have faith cause I'mma try you
My momma introduced me to the scripture
The channel 4 news introduced me to that shit that produced Hitler
I was a young lad: Three Stooges, Superman, Batman, The Riddler
Moonwalk, Windmill, Freeze for the picture
My grandma taught me courage
She told me never let the grizzly bears eat your porridge
Or you'll just be a carcass dying slowly in the forest
I could never thank her for it
But I can slay a devil when I see one
Steady practice mastery of self so not to be one
Life is like a re-run, season after season
Bombs on the train, bombs from the plane
Of disgruntled citizens bein' tried for treason
Whatever"
Not Too Far From Nothing,Jay Electronica,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse - Jay Electronica]
There's more than one way to heal a leper
Terrorize the commercialized Thrill the hecklers
You might be eatin' off that wack shit for now
But I interrupt dinner like bill collectors
Hit the lights, cue music, run the real projectors
I was raised on Kool-Aid and Pac-Man
Steely Dan, Gap Band, Michael Jackson
Outside, the fiends was scufflin' for crack
In the same spots where shell-toes was doin' back spins
That's why I spit the otherful, colorful, you a fly motherfucker
You bubble you B.L.O.W
Vision like the Hubble, the trouble
From Lancaster to Manchester, I slam rappers
And keep weak niggas in line like band captains"
Hagler,Jay Electronica,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Jay Electronica]
Ladies and gentlemen
Ladies and gentlemen

[Verse One: Jay Electronica]
I banged a lot of shakers
And no I don't spit scratch rap
Just know that my hands exchanged a lot of paper
I lived a lifetime for most of y'all by twenty-one
Same spades game, different player man, plenty come, plenty go
Twenty-four with gleamers on the Benz
Might thicken up your friends, thicken up your hands
Make you feel like Charles Dickens dippin' with your pen
But you can see like Stevie do by lookin' at your kin
Family tell a story: neglect the ones you love the most
Famine for the glory, lookin' like Robert Horry
Tryin' to hit that clutch with three seconds on the clock
Viewin' things rather poorly
Those that went before me
Tried to school me well but the wisdom only bored me
I never lost yet but if I did it would be sorely
Therefore, I implore thee:
Never come before the champion of men
The beginning and the end
[Verse Two: Hager]
We're the enemy of friend Above the Rim like Leon
My blood color neon, my soul aged eons
My first name will be on the Nobel list
For now I settle for a Grammy on a track like this
I used to rap with the Kool G. lisp
Citizenship is British, red snapper, cook the fish
After grub, we hit the club and walk away with medallions
Came a long way but fuck it homey we back again
Whatever when I made it through he worst
I can die as drops in the hurricane, the rain never touches 'em
You got guts runnin' through your veins
Get freedom, the spook that sat by the door
You ain't even seen him cleanin' guns in the back
Serial numbers, they key 'em
They want half, I only need ten for my per diem
And you don't need no fuckin' wrist band to come to meet them
You can say you part of my band: The Grand Union, yeah"

[Part 2: She's Calling]

[Doseone]
Empty
Things
She's calling
She's calling me tonight
From just inside my lips
And
I'll write her
Betterment of the world through wish
Wish I'd
Fall off, growing distant
I'll write her
And pull my face fresh
From the waxy palms it's kept soft in
[Why?]
There's something
To the fading of faith
My whole childhood
Was the broken guitar
And my sister's silly
Yellow blanket
Now I carry
Slender and sexy curved
Sledge hammers
To break the bricks
I bought
I should have never went to college
But took a trip to Costa Rica
To cut rainforests
To choke myself

[Doseone]
Making up Miss Bobafetet as I go along

[Why?]
And rejecting the truths that I've been served

[Doseone]
Making up Miss Bobafetet as I go along
[Why?]
And rejecting the truths that I've been served

[Doseone]
Fool in
Besides
Tuition for my countenance
Pressed fine in reverse block
Style print
A product
Of cave drawings
Gone automated
With these loafers and a check book
Twisted tightly into... into
I know
A stiletto

[Doseone and Why?]
Do you know how many times
I've thought about writing about the paper I'm writing on?
Do you know how many times
I've thought about writing about the paper I'm writing on?

[Why?]
I lost my liquid tongue for the wet pen
[Doseone]
I have one mortal wish

[Why?]
I don't even know where I've been
(In the basement, hugging the gas main)
Something's been left out of this game
God, did you remember to render everything?
I've seen 1078 Sundays and
7 borders where the liquid meets land
I've even seen stars
Now where the fuck
Is anti-emptiness?

[Doseone]
I'm leaking into stoned and severed existence

[Why?]
I've been consumed by my own breath

[Part 3: A Touching Story]

[Illogic]
Change of face, shapeless
Personality switch, transformation
So impersonation of self leads
Crowds in twos to disintegration
Who's in the basement choking a puppet on the pedestal?
Let a stool pigeon escort those who contort
Three doors down into the left door on the right hand side
My hand slides into pockets
Pull sockets of lead penalty
Orbs of red energy
Entering the orbit of the morbid
Northern and southern hemispheres of play capsule
Place time bombs and rose stems on your axle
Clear case
Hole in faded ozone layer of doom
Sphere of babylon shield
Towering above gravity
Taking up space in a residence of stars

[Doseone]
A touching story of ungrateful velcro skulled boy
With his tored-off face
And the life-sized sacked marionette
He'd thought looked an awful lot like him
(With his time told and mildewed
Baby clothes of a business man.)
Jerk... wackoff slumped
And he's tired, sick with bad posturing
One can't hold in
Oh hell, there's a king of jungle in him yet
Give our young lad middle of America's valise
But spare the gauze, he's losing poet by the gallon
Glory, Glory
Bottom of the quicksand's gonna give him a
Whole lot less to think about
Than change that steel trap perspective would
Perhaps

I ain't a scared no more, to make a' the difference
Stolen heart, and a whole wide world to blame

[Why?]
I've been
Living
In a record
Skipped filmstrip

I'm falling off the side of the boat
And when I hit water
I'm falling off the side of the boat
I fall asleep hoping
Tomorrow tastes like poems and honeysuckle
I move slow cause the sky looks bluer
When you fuck the order of the day
Or the way the shelves were meant to fit
I wish I had a pair of stilts to wear
While I play the flute in some
Light-traffic hallway in my old high school

But these are only threats to the seated self
Maybe Spain is the open-faced smile
From some life I saw in a movie
And always thought I'd live

[Doseone]
Jackpot!

[Illogic]
Congratulations!

[Why?]
Space is potent

Can I Kick It?,A Tribe Called Quest,"['hip hop', 'jazz', 'r&b', 'blues', 'pop']","[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Well, I'm gone (Go on then!)

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Can I kick it? To all the people who can Quest like A Tribe does
Before this, did you really know what live was?
Comprehend to the track, for it's why cuz
Gettin measures on the tip of the vibers
Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afrocentric living is a big shrug
A life filled with fun that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above
If you diss us, we won't even think of
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove?
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
Like a box of positives it's a plus, love
As the Tribe flies high like a dove
(Can I kick it?)
[Chorus: Phife Dawg]
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Well, I'm gone (Go on then!)

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Can I kick it? To my Tribe that flows in layers
Right now, Phife is a poem sayer
At times, I'm a studio conveyor
Mr. Dinkins, would you please be my mayor?
You'll be doing us a really big favor
Boy this track really has a lot of flavor
When it comes to rhythms, Quest is your savior
Follow us for the funky behavior
Make a note on the rhythm we gave ya
Feel free, drop your pants, check your ha-ir
Do you like the garments that we wear?
I instruct you to be the obeyer
A rhythm recipe that you'll savor
Doesn't matter if you're minor or major
Yes, the Tribe of the game we're the player
As you inhale like a breath of fresh air
(Can I kick it?)"

Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)

I’d do a bid, loose a rib, bust a cap, trust in that
Run up to heaven doors, exchange my life for yours

We Nino and Gee Money, man, we all we got
From the stoop to the big dudes, stoppin' us from playin' hoops

But these streets raised me crazy
Product of my environment, nothing can save me
Thanks for letting me bloom, for your wisdom, for your womb
For the roof over my head, for my shoes, for my bed
For the most important lesson in life was when you said
""Strive for what you believe in, set goals and you can achieve them""
Thanks for the days you kept me breathing
When my asthma was bad and my chest was wheezin'
Thanks for the look of love just as I was leaving
On nights you thought that I wouldn't come back, that left you grieving
Thanks for holdin' down the household when times was bad
As a man, I apologize for my dad
When the rent was due, you would hustle like a pimp would do
That wasn’t the life meant for you
You’re a queen, you deserve the cream, everything that gleamed
Everything that shines, everything that’s mine

Don’t follow no nigga, that's ho shit man
Stand on your own two, do your shit man

Can we get much higher? So high oh
Doomsday, Doomsday went and killed your Superman
Hoe's in his red cape, Lois Lane, red face
Around my hometown, so many people know how meth taste
Fiends on my glass pipe ‘cause I got the best tate
As soon as I join the game, headshot, spectate
Wanna try again? Take your best shot, let’s wait
Nothing? I motherfuckin' thought so
I'mma spit fire at ya ice, let it thaw slow
Stopped at your girl’s crib when I was on tour though
Word of advice, don’t even knock if the door closed
I pick her up and all she do is twirl
Find me at the gym, all I do is curls
She want diamonds on her neck but all I do is pearls
And I lose my memory like I never knew the girl
I think I got amnesia, fuck Smokey
Somebody light the trees up
Can we get much higher? So high oh
[Laws/Gorgeous]
I wanna take every whack rapper, shoot ‘em in the face
Bury them while they still breathin', it’s killin' season
I’m trippin', they wanna mention Dillon and he raps like Pippen
Nobody talked about him until he passed but I’m different
Wake up and do some suicide drills
Got your favorite new rapper takin' suicide pills
I got too much heart for your thin chest
I’m based as a motherfucker, no princess
Chicks on me ‘cause I look like reggaeton
Keep your sandbox punk, I'mma play alone
Grass roots, I did it by the book
I'mma build my own castle and fill it up with crooks
King shits, I have to put weight down
My team members doing leg work, James Brown
I got soul and I’m super bad
I will fuck your wife and raise your kids like Super Dad
Haha, now who’s up for the theme park?
I want the whole pie, I don’t need to see charts
We had some D.C rallies but we didn’t bang
Tea party in the clan like Yin and Yang
Tricknology, wake your ass up
Hit ‘em while they leave the record labels, scrape the cash up
If you love real rap, you should raise your glass up
See, I flunked a couple times but I made the class up
Save Hip-Hop but you the enemy
You feel each other too much, MMA
It’s all jokes until my animals kill y’all
I’m a mix of Louie Anderson and Anderson Silva huh
My first mixtape, priceless
You make me wanna do another one, night shift
I make the freaks come out on that night shit
And beat the daylights outta them with my night stick
[Hook/Gorgeous]
Ain’t no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly driftin' away from me
I’m on the edge, so why you playin'? I’m sayin'
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down"
Fix Up Look Sharp,Dizzee Rascal,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Oi
Yeah
Stupid idiot

[Chorus: Dizzee Rascal & Billy Squier]
Fix up, look sharp
Don't make me get the blitz out, get dark
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down, just calm down
Fix up, look sharp
Don't make me get the blitz out, get dark (Woo)
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down, just calm down
I got the big beat
I hear the sound (Yeah)
I got the big beat (Dizzee Rascal)
I get on down (Rolling deep)

[Verse 1]
I've heard the gossip from the street to the slammer
They're tryna see if Dizzee stays true to his grammar
Being a celebrity don't mean shit to me (Woo)
Fuck the glitz and glamour, hit 'em with the Blitz and Hammer (Woo)
Because they're talking 'bout rushing
Talk behind my back but to my face, they say nothing
Stand up in the dance, keep a firm steady stance
Keep the beanies touching, keep the beanies hot flushing (Woo)
Flushing MCs down the loo
If you don't believe me, bring your posse, bring your crew
Feel free to hate 'cause I ain't tryna be your mate
Be serious, you wouldn't last an hour in my shoe (Woo)
It's an Air Force One (Woo)
Trainers by the truck load, trainers by the tonne
Don't be dazed when I catch you by your J's
Chump, best to act like Forrest Gump, best to run (Woo)

I hear the sound
I got the big beat (Oi, woo)
I get on down (Sweet as a nut mate, sweet as a nut)

[Verse 2]
Oi look (Woo)
I stay sweet as a nut, sweet like Tropicana
When the hammer hits, your head splits like banana
You're not ready for this boy
You better send your best soldiers, this is Captain Roscoe (Woo)
More destructive and troublesome than ever
I'll probably be doing this, probably forever
Fellas wanna stop me, they'll probably come together
It's probable they'll stop me, probably never (Woo)
Yo, topboy, topman, or top ah topper
Come to me with an attitude, come a cropper
I'm old school like Happy Shopper
I fight old school, bring your bat and your chopper (Woo)
And a first aid kit (Woo) and some antiseptic, this could get hectic
I'm a don, accept it, you got a bright future
Don't let my gun affect it

Freedom,Clipse,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'alternative']","[Chorus]
Speak, speak of freedom
Sing of amber, all ways of grain

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
With every line written, and all I have given
Music’s been nothing more than a self-made prison
I’ve taken inmate losses at the hands of this one
My pen’s been the poison to family and friendships
Now it’s time to mend shit, time to bring closure to
The clear conscience of Pusha is long overdue
Thinking to myself, what could I be owing you?
They only tell you you great when they're reminiscing over you
Before I Trouble T-Roy, it’s just a D-boy
Let me play the role of a Common on his B-boy
Speaking my truth in rhyme, no matter how bland it is
A heavy heart lightened, that’s just what my ransom is
All apologies, I bear the cross, I wear the blame
We in the same group but I don’t share my brother’s pain
Not to confuse, our sentiments are all the same
I just don’t feel nothing, I’m numbed by the will to gain
Same thing brought tears to innocents
I turned away and didn’t even flinch, yuugh!
The music drove me crazy
Looked up and lost the first bitch I ever wanted to have my babies
Nowadays she can’t even face me, I’m sorry for the heartbreak
I promised you forever my lady, Jodeci baby
Pompous motherfucker, just look what them jewels made me
I’m only finding comfort in knowing you can’t replace me
What a thing to say, but what am I to do?
I’m role-playing a conscious nigga and true is true
Cocaine aside, all of the bloggers behooved
My critics finally have a verse of mine to jerk off to
I own you all
[Chorus]
Speak, speak of freedom
Sing of amber, all ways of grain

[Verse 2: Malice]
This is where the buck stop, here's where I draw the line
I touch the hem, God's work is so divine
I've seen the error of my ways over time
Never to return, Malicious has been refined
Like wine, with time I get better
Napa Valley vintage, my flow is fermented
Now drink of me, as if I bought the bar
Run to these words, as if there's no tomorrow
Never mind my car, careful what you wish for
Behind every curtain the devil and his pitchfork
Jealousy, I ask thee, ""What is this for?""
How was I to know I was happy being piss-poor?
No, whore, that's not love, we was fucking
I was in search of a chickenhead, you was clucking
And I was lusting, we were both out of order
I should've known better as I'm reminded of my daughter
Am I my brother's keeper or for himself every man?
I have been your reaper, there's blood on my hands
Accept me as your keeper, there's been a change of plans
Careful what you speak of, I've come to understand, preach
[Outro: Pusha T]
What else you want from us, huh?!
What more can you ask? We've given you everything
We lost life, we lost love
We lost family behind this shit
This shit you call music, we call this shit life
We gave you proof, they ain't give you shit!
We gave you truth, do I entertain you motherfucker?!
Well dance then bitch!

Un-thinkable Im Ready Remix,Alicia Keys,[],"[Intro: Alicia Keys]
If you ask me, I'm ready...

Ugh, Tez keeps tellin' me he just turned 30
Havin' dreams of bein' single forever, he's gettin' worried
And I'm scared too, 'cause I'm in the same boat
Good women are rare too, none of them have came close
Me I haven't changed much, you know how I play it
Better safe than sorry
'Stead of searchin' for substance at every single party
Baby, bein' part of this life
I feel like I'm bound to end up with somebody that's been with everybody
I need you to rescue me from my destiny
I'm tryna live right and give you whatever's left of me (yeah)
'Cause you know life is what we make it
And a chance is like a picture, it'd be nice if you just take it
Or let me take it for you, I'm just down to ride
Or we can roll around the city 'til you finally decide
I've got more than a thing for you, tattoo and an ink for you
Right over my heart, girl, I'll do the unthinkable
[Verse 2: Alicia Keys & Drake]
Moment of honesty
Someone's gotta take the lead tonight
Who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here
And tell you all that comes to me
If you have somethin' to say
You should say it right now
You should say it right now
You ready?

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys & Drake]
You give me a feelin' that I've never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
I deserve it, I think I deserve it, let it go
It's becoming somethin' that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it
I can't take it

I was wonderin', maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)

I know you once said to me
""This is exactly how it should feel when it's meant to be""
Time is only wastin', so why wait for eventually?
If we gon' do somethin' 'bout it
We should do it right now
We should do it right now
Baby, uh
[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys & Drake]
You give me a feelin' that I've never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
I deserve it, I know I deserve it, let it go
It's becoming somethin' that's impossible to ignore
It is what we make it

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I was wonderin', maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful? Either way, I'm sayin'...
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)

Yeah, yeah
Sing...
Why give up before we try?
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away (fly away)
I can't say I came prepared
I'm suspended in the air
Won't you come be in the sky with me?

I was wonderin', maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful? Either way, I'm sayin'...

Cut the shit nigga, 2k nino neener' tucked away
Smoking gema me and Tina leaning as she hides
In the Plaza parking Lot I bust her ass & slide
I tapped the 'o
I spark a lot it helps relax my vibe
Still ain't giving my heart to no bitch; I owe all that to pride
South side, home of the hardest shit hitting, my eyes wide
Crumble is what you get slipping
Dear hater, I won't stop until you love me
Get this motherfucking money pop bubbley' and do my dougie'

I'll talk, when it's time to get that shoppin' sorted
Oh, this Armani blazer, bitch I got imported
Yeah I like that whip
Because I'm on the bands, only reason I ain't dropped that forty
Hot chicks see me on the street and they stop and call me
Want me to get my willy out so they can toss it for me
Got 'em goin' topless for me
When she pop it for me, really got me horny
Record label contract, my lawyers got it for me
Dotted all the I's and the T's, can you cross 'em for me?
You can try and put your crosses on me
I don't watch hate, I got shooters that'll watch it for me

I'm heavy, I'm colder
Better me? No sir
I could tear apart MC's, but I'd rather read
A book on childcare by Kerry Katona
No niceness, I ran out of it, dumb it down a bit
Ain't somethin' I'm prepared to do
Well I ain't ever gonna run out of lip
Here's somethin' I prepared for you
I tried to relax
But being spaced it inspires me back
When will I be nice to Katie Price?
The day I see a cage fighter in drag, ah
I don't want a tomorrow without friction
Jump into beef both feet first
And make pros eat their words
And sit and watch 'em swallow their own dic-tion

Now, everytime I draw my dates
They're like ""How the fuck d'you afford this place?""
First place, first place, first place
Try act up, dem man will address that, call it
Put a fuckin' man in their place
Bitch I'm great, for goodness sake
I ain't gotta queue cause they know my face
Girls took my watch tryin' to wind up on me
I was like I ain't got time to waste, get it?
I ain't got time to waste, get it?
Try and get hype in my face, regret it
Got a big pitbull and I don't remember
The last time I fed it, so don't upset it

Let me grieve for the beat before I murder it
Don't know my name? By now you should've heard of it
Why, cause I'm murderin' anybody lurking in
Close proximity, circlin'
Will make an example of men when I stride in
Dev's has got a tiny temper
I'm observing this, learning
But now I'm just yearning to burn it, I'll fire your agenda
Lock me up, might high risk offender
Make a man turn on his own team like an Irish defender
I'm a rhymin' inventor that's climbin' up heights you're not meant to

I'm sober, but I'll still kidnap a so called soldier
And bolt in the Rover to Dover
Yeah it's over, the game's over

Put up your lighters, I clash the Titans
Fight the fighters, Mike fight the biters
Spit till my throat got tonsillitis
That's on a Monday mornin', ha
Takin' over, run straight past ya
No warnin', not a real disaster
Harder, faster, stronger, longer
This one here was top of the classroom
Stop the lecture, drop the pressure
Never say never, but nevertheless I
Never say no to experiments
Whether it's tenements, clubs, yards, spittin' with eloquence
Positive sentiments
Havin' a hell of a time and it's evident
Don't question my relevance
I've started on this so I'm back in my element

Uh, I open my mouth, niggas panic
The jewels are liabilities, mmm, I'm the asset
Underdogs are barkin' up, shh hush puppy
My new chain's got red and blue ice man
I call it my slush puppy
Yeah, let me clap 'em with the reminder flow
I was best newcomer, err, time ago
Yeah, you've all passed your sell by date to me
I'm different nigga, I sell out
When you add a venue and date to me

And now it's game over
Kick him out the team, I heard he's snaking, he's a cobra
Could have lived the dream but now your days are done, it's over
Should have never schemed and now your looking for a shoulder, to lean on
To wipe your tears on, it's over
Breathe, breathe
Third Strike
My clouds are black, my shades are black

[Verse 7: Tinchy Stryder]
Let me go, yo
They better let me go, let me loose
I'm frozen cold, my veins are blue
Hell to home, but it's Satan proof
Good as gold, my angels flew
Yo, they can't knock down mine
Cuffs on flows I lock down lines
I am not human, real life mutant
Ask Mick Foley, I'm not mankind
Yeah, look under my eyelids
All red, I bleed through the iris

Clear the way for the prophets of rage
Engaging on the stage, on a track, t ell Jack stay in the back
I was born
Every level I'm on, you're warned
Just in case you forgot, I pump in kilowatts
To let 'em know which direction
To go what's up I wanna know
I test the front row
Forgiven the giving while the living is living it up
So many people are sleeping while standing up
Not dressed to impress or fess it
That's it test to the brain like FedEx
Treated one and the same beause the name of the game
Don't give 'em checks above necks
Some don't realize we're on the same side
Subdity in the city, suburbs or projects
But we're living in a different time
Some speed, some lead while some just pump rhymes
Then again we're all in the same gang
Info to flow and heal all below
Let's go and find the piece of mind that's taken
Or else the black starts breakin'
Public Enemy Number One
Public Enemy Number One
Public Enemy Number One
Public Enemy Number One
Public Enemy Number One
Public Enemy Number One
Public Enemy Number One

Do for Love,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: 2Pac]
Turn it up loud
Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, Pac!
Word up, hahahahaha

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I should've seen
You was trouble right from the start, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin' loud, I wanna stay
But I can’t help from walkin' out just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be your man it just wasn’t me
But now I’m searchin’ for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don’t be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin’
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin' me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin' me to come back, I'm a sucka for love
[Chorus: Eric Williams]
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Just when I thought I broke away and I'm feelin' happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don’t wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I’m back
To makin promises to you, tryin' to keep it true
What if I’m wrong, a trick to keep me holdin on
Tryin’ to be strong and in the process, keep you goin'
I’m 'bout to lose my composure, I’m gettin’ close
To packin’ up and leavin’ notes, and gettin’ ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I’m feelin' low, losin’ control
My heart is sayin’ leave, oh, what a tangled web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin’ calls at the house, guess you cheatin’
That’s all I need to hear, 'cause I’m leavin’, I’m out the door
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
'Cause now I know you’ve been cheatin', I’m a sucka for love

[Chorus: Eric Williams]
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings’ll go away
It wasn’t always a hit-and-run relationship
It used to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I should've seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin’ tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don’t worry 'bout it, we can do it now I’m under pressure
Make a decision, 'cause I’m waitin’, when I’m alone
I’m on the phone havin’ secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I’m a sucka for love

[Chorus: Eric Williams]
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

[Outro: Eric Williams]
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, (Do for love)
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, (Do for love)
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
Do for love, yeah baby yeah
Do for love"

Turnt Up,King Los,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Los]
I'm in that seashell Impala with a pelvic scholar
That can spot a fake handbag and smell a dollar
This my love letter, dear jealous cowards
I'm all the way turnt up like Elvis collar
Drop that fucking top and paint that Lincoln navy blue
Diamond bezel face, my band all white like Blink 182
But don't blink, I maybe view, I might be gone, you might just miss it
Because zero gravity is fly but that's just basic physics
Settle down shawty, hope she ain't your down shawty
How she give the kid some play, it's like she play in house party
How they gon' outsmart me? They need better schooling
I gave your girlfriend the dope dick and left her drooling
My jeweler called me, asked me will I give him 30
To put black ice in my piece, Will.I.Am and Fergie
They say will I give 'em mercy, Why? Niggas can't reverse my fire
Hungry sun, thirsty sky, I'm starving and the earth is pie
Stare you in your worthless eyes, penetrate your shallow soul
Plus I got some fucking swag, that'll make your shadow cold
They don't want me in battle mode, my shit more like war mode
Smack your fucking face and stomp the organs out your torso
Then I'm on my tours, yo, fuck these hoes, get more dough
Till everything in my house Italian, no Jersey Shore show
They can't go where your boy go, got an asteroid flow
Been nice from the get go, and I ain't talking Geico
Squirrel, I'm powered up, fresh to death and showered up
Jump on that hooligan express, scoop your homie out the cut
And they know we out that what where they swing them techs and AK’s
That'll smash ya homie, you know, Danger, Precious, Ray J
Lames just better play safe, they frightened from the fucking truth
Hit these niggas in the head like a sniper on the roof
Uh, I give ‘em cold stares, no grin
See my target, hold my breath, then I zero in"
Over Remix,King Los,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Los]
I'm really on my bullshit, I'm an asshole
The way a nigga shining, I don't even have a shadow
I'm too bright to follow, your boo like to swallow
She come rub my wood first, do like Apollo
You too light, too shallow, who you call fight here?
Any less feeling and your raps would be a light beer
I got ‘em by a light year, and yeah I really got it
You the last day of a period, nigga you barely spotted
I'm murder on a notepad, your favorite rappers toe-tag
And jewelry, Louie V shoe, belt, coat, bag
Fresh off the boat swag, wavy than a motherfucker
My raps Roc (rock) Nations, no Jay-Z in this motherfucker
Okay, nigga get ya weight up, you frail and embarrassing
You ain't nothing like Los, you pale in comparison
Never go against Los, hail him and cherish him
I'm soning rappers, how the fuck I fail to encourage ‘em?
Your garments is awful, try to shop where I shop
Your pockets'll break fast, omelets and waffles
Make bread, break bread, I bring mine to dinner
Hit the Gucci store and cop the spring line in the winter
I buy what you lease out, you dream what I rent out
Basement ass niggas always screaming at the penthouse
Piss me off, I'mma start naming niggas now
And anybody can get it like I'm aiming in the crowd
Put a lion in a cage, you can't tame him if he wild
You can strap me to a gurney, you can chain a nigga down
If a gangster nigga quiet, and the lamest niggas loud
Then a silence on the scope and I'm aiming for the crown
Motherfucker
[Hook]
I see way too many haters here right now
That I didn't see last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few months
They been overlooking me but, I feel I'm better than them all
So what are you doing? What are you doing?
You ain't doing shit if you ain't signing me
‘Cause I'm doing me, I'm on the top right now man
And this where I'm gon be till it's over
Till it's over and your career is over

[Verse 2: Los]
Okay, shout out to my niggas that was really in the feds
That been fucking with me since I ripped A Milli in shreds
When the Glock click, my clique was really getting bread
Benz, cool Range Rov, hit him in the head
When it come to the flow, I kill a nigga dead
Like bears if you catch any gorillas in your bed
I ain't finna get his scrilla, nigga silly in the head
Hit the rap game, make a couple milli then I fled
Then I'm long gone, N-Y, M-I-A, Hong Kong
DC, A-T-L on chrome, no dome
Wherever I ride, wherever I slide
I'm good, I'm great at whatever I try
I'm clever, I'm better forever, I'm fly, if ever you by my side
Just pick up a pen and a pad and I'll leave you some swag
Then you can brag and back up all that talk you got
Telling niggas all that heart you got
You say you the Uno, you know we pull niggas cards a lot
Boy don't even start it, stop, please don't get me started, stop
‘Cause soon as I start it, stop, I wreck shit from start to stop
From the day they left my father shot
Yeah that was my baddest year, my worst and my saddest year
But I am still standing here, now let's get my status clear
Nigga, I am over everything like the stratosphere

They think I’m doing this just for fun
I’m going in, I wanna be number one
Two’s a bad look and one I want
I’m such a G, I wanna be number one

[Verse 1: Laws]
Ay, I don’t want the responsibility
I’m saving a dying culture from all the philistines
And still it seems I'mma have to be the party stopper
They say that once you in the zone, then it’s hard to stop
I'mma A class, ahead of my peers
I’m near the next weight class, I’m aiming for them harder boxers
I used to live in debt, now I resurrect the game
Till we all the living dead, deadly as a cigarette
Smoking while the Nicorette's poking out ya shirt sleeve
These are my trophies, I deserve these
I bet my life savings if you heard me before your current favorite rapper
You diss ‘em and then encourage me
Despite my proper way of speaking, I’m feeling prejudice currently
‘Cause Laws Brown like Murphy so I gotta be number one off my etiquette
Parade with confetti through the land of the confederates
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Look, I’m number one, zero don’t count
Dracula when I bite into this bitch, you see the blood come
I’m on one, you wack rappers y'all on two
Yeah motherfucker I said it so what you gon’ do?
My city, I’m the one in the town
I’m the king, matter of fact, I’m loving the crown
Nigga, it's Top Dawg, we the best is the pound
West Coast motherfucker, know you loving the sound
Now number one that I am, hit your town
Take your bitch down up in the Hyatt
You see some ranches, know that I pull my bulls out
Keep heavy metal like Uncle Jesse off Full House
A train on tracks, heavy on fire, I’m too dope for y’all so don’t try it
I ain’t the one to be dissing, if I’m the one that you dissing
You gonna be missing with them vicious, nigga I’m the one

[Verse 3: Laws]
I want my mama watching TV and seeing me dressed up
Living out my dreams, looking so clean in my pressed tux
And to make it happen, I’ll keep on beating the rest up
Overeating like I’m dreaming of being the next Pun
Or is it the first Laws rather be a trendsetter
Thinking you a boss ‘cause you people steady spend cheddar
The way you fake cats steady put on an act
I'mma have to put on a mask and be rap’s V for Vendetta
You so scary that you scare me to sleep
My voice high, making any comparisons is weak
The second after I drop, I hope your carelessness will cease
‘Cause you’ll have to run it back and start comparing them to me
I wonder if you got a fan that’s not inebriated
I’m the best period, your plans just got abbreviated
For anybody that does not know me as Laws
You can call me Simon ‘cause your song and dance is not appreciated"

Stay grounded but I still reach for the sky though

Shit I know a lot more than I should
The hood stood by me just like I thought it would
Dont act like I'm Hollywood when I probably could
I don't polly, Mohammed Ali of rap, I don't lolly gag

You can catch me anywhere where there's Bacardi at

Get to leaning in the front, get to bouncing in the back
Show my face for a minute, then I'm bouncing through the back

That's what you wanna hear, that's what you gonna hear
If you don't like it why the hell would you come in here?
That's what you wanna hear, that's what you gonna hear
If you don't like it, why the hell would you come in here?

[Verse 2]
Chicken wings, candy paint
The color of my drank is the color of the paint
Don't say you ballin' little homie, when you know you ain't
Your Rolly fake, That ain't a Jacob that's a jake
Got a can of Budweiser don't tell me that I can't drank
You must not know my name
Charles Hamilton Yeah I'm still strange
I got money, why the fuck I need a chain?
What's your name? Where you from?
I wanna cum, so girl give me some brain
She said ""I wanna come, can I bring my friend Loraine?""
I said ""Okay, just put your face between her legs""
She got taste, I got class
I take them to school, put your ass in her face
So I can catch you talking shit on tape
I'm not a loser, I just like to be chased
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Maybe I can get a little bit intelligent
Say some shit the kids will dig because it's relevant
Or maybe that'll blow your high too much
But I don't give a fuck cause I'm screwed up
I'm screwed up (x8)
Maybe if I rhyme ""booty"", with ""cutie"", and ""do me""
I can get a hit record on my iTunes and stuff
But I can't help the fact that my mind screwed up
My mind screwed up (x8)

Say the same shit 50 million times (It's a hit!)(x8)

I'm a new soul, I came to this strange world
Hoping I could learn a bit 'bout how to give and take
I'm a new soul, I came to this strange world
Hoping I could learn a bit 'bout how to give and take

BKS, Craig B., what's up? (It's the Best Kept Secret!)

[Verse One]
They used to call me the future
A month later say, ""Fuck it, I'm growin' used to him""
See they use me, then they the new me
Though I recite it like it Lucifer's loose leaf
But you ain't never pleased, maybe you should leave
And find a Newport and I don't mean no loosies
Nor Desi Arnaz, though many aren't as poetic as this though
Many on-sites claim prophetic, they is
Professing they found one ready as this
So tell me I ain't shit, go and embellish it a bit
But I never break a sweat, it takes effort to conflict
So if they better than the kid
I guess I'm Leftwich 'cause I still get to win
Dig? And what you heard is thunderin'
No Vince Young, I did superb on the Wonderlic

[Wale talking over the Hook]
Go ahead and google the Wonderlic test. Ha ha
Shout out to all the Freshmen. Asher. B.O.B. Scotty, what's up?
Wiz Khalifia. Drizzy Drake. Wale

[Verse Two]
See, most sites will give me three and a half
Four on a good day, but this morning I missed a cab
So let me tell you about this guy
He hit me on AIM, I respond, he replies
Like, ""You sick Wale. Real talk, no shittin'
I love what you're doin'. I'm just hopin' you continue
Allow me to give you couple tracks that I'm pitchin'""
I decline for the moment he unfollows on Twitter
Huh?! Now ain't that a bitch or two
Sideways niggas keep tryin' to make them Bishop moves
Now concentrate until you get the Juice
But I'm done teachin' niggas though it's school
Nigga this class, nigga this cash
And I've been puttin' in work, nigga just ask
Hot 97, Y'all I was just at it
So you can see why they mad, look at they status
New Soul
[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Yeah, I never dreamed of a gift
And I've been uplifting the people I'm with
To speak from the soul and just leave it with them
With an impending mixtape that only seems like a myth
And things seem to conflict
New soul verses the O.G. it seemed as a hit
But it seems like a scene outta flick
It seems to remind me of a scene like this
Analyze and persist
I decided my pride is just why I resist
That's why I conflict with the why, when, and ifs
The Jiggas and the Tips
The Ems and the 50s
And I'm the fuckin' best, never mind if you iffy
So while the world goes Drake crazy
I'm Danny Granger
I'm just workin' with a different Pacer
Speed up, patience, please cause
Slow and steady wins this race
Fuck leadin'

La dictature dans la politique
Ce n'est pas bon. Ce n'est pas bon. Nous n'en voulons pas

[Verse 1-Wale]
Made it out Naija with nothing in the bank
DC cabs got my pops alright
UDC where he met my mother
Couple years later they had my brother
Low income no bills getting paid
Not to mention Wale is on the way
It was just the four of us uptown corners
Peabody street venturing off Georgia
I never hugged no corner
That is not an ice-cream truck that's a coroner
Back when crack was enormous
Moved it to Maryland so that couldn't harm us
Thinking I was OK
Got in more trouble as I got up that age
And I was getting whipped at home in sixth grade
But it made me the man I am today, Thanks
[Verse 2-K'naan]
I was similar, plus I was born in middle of
Kill 'em up 'dishu make gore in the cinema
Steering up, trouble was pouring the villain up
Little nutjobs come swarming the village up
I was small with my skinny butt
Had to D up like all in a titty cup
Pop-pop, hit a mini mug
Shitty but I seeing brain getting splited-up
So they taught me to spray
But more importantly taught me to pray
Oh, mama got a visa
You mean to tell we goin' Um Ricka
Now they want me to grease-up, be less African and get amnesia
Nah! Slumdog Million G's up
My past gives M.C.s a rap seizure

[Verse 3-Wale]
And I'm similar
Critics fall in love when I'm spitting it
Flow unfuckwithable, niggas impotent
Mama was an immigrant, money slow coming in
No benefits still a nigga never hissy fit
This the land of the white man
We don’t plan it to pan out, why fight back?
I just write that right by a mic stand
Write a couple checks sip a couple y'all like that
It's my fact y'all are fiction with diction
Speak with conviction or we shouldn't listen
See with a District Columbia vision
Along with these Yoruba contact lenses
Oh yeah, pops got a visa
Think he regret coming to Um Ricka
Where they cherish gangsters and not teachers
And you believe when a rapper wan' be one
[Verse 4-K'naan]
K'naan and Wale got money in the bank
In the T.Dot I'm a soldier with ranks
Mark from Kingston was a gun runner
Used to call me the African Don Dada
Rap sheet was as long as a Sudanese brother
You ain't more street so go suck your mother
I'm fresh, and yes I rock my fedoras
Amadou & Mariam but still no chorus
I never said ""Oh, poor us""
Though horoscopes couldn't scope my horrors
Rappers please step forward
I'm a magician so please focus
It go 'Abracadabra'
Mixing potion from African forests
Oops, I'm so sorry
Just turned your street cred to whole-wheat porridge
Ha-ha K'naan, Wale

[Outro-Wale]
Aw man, it's been a ride
It's been a hell of a journey for me man
We started off just kinda passing around CDs
With uhh motherfuckin' sharpies written on the CDs
And now, you know, I'm a couple mixtapes in
Had, like, the mixtape of the year
A lot of people called it last year
So you know
You know how Jay-Z said he wasn't going for the charts
On Um, Deaf Auto-tune
Like I wasn't going for like mix-tape of the year
Or like monumental mixtape of the moment
Like, you know what I'm sayin'
It was more so like, I just want to get my rapping on
And with niggas want to get their rapping on
So let's get our rapping on"
Islands,Shakira,['pop'],"[Verse 1]
I don't have to leave anymore
What I have is right here
Spend my nights and days before
Searching the world for what's right here

[Verse 2]
Underneath and unexplored
Islands and cities I have looked
Here I saw
Something I couldn't over look

[Chorus]
I am yours now
So now I don't ever have to leave
I've been found out
So now I'll never explore
See what I've done

[Verse 3]
That bridge is on fire
Going back to where I've been
I'm froze by desire
No need to leave
[Verse 4]
Where would I be
If this were to go under?
It's a risk I'd take
I'm froze by desire
As if a choice I'd make

[Chorus]
I am yours now
So now I don't ever have to leave
I've been found out
So now I'll never explore

[Outro]
So now I'll never explore
See what I've done"
John Blaze,Fat Joe,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Nas]
My stripes show like regiments, military intelligence
Murder game, I leave no evidence, credentials
Go ask my pre-school, even talk to my old principal
He'd tell you how I used to pack a No. 2 pencil
Stabbin' students, grabbin' teachers, Catholics, preachers
In the school staircase, cuttin' class, passin' my reefer
In my own class, operation return, they tried to say
I was incompetent, not able to learn
The tables turned now, got my own label I earned
Like that nigga said in Dead Presidents, ""Money to burn""
Queensbridge, pay homage respect, Nas is a vet
Acknowledge the rep, polish baguettes
Niggas is this and that, I'm just the best
Puttin' all violence to rest
Between Latin Kings and blood, los sangres, blood in Spanish
So many thugs vanish, unite the system
To fight with inner street wisdom to help teach in prison

[Verse 2: Big Punisher]
My crew puff lye, anyone testin' Pun must die
Just give me one try, now you know you done fucked up, right?
Ha, you ain't got no wins in mi casa
¿Qué te pasa? You ain't even in my clasa
I hate a actor that plays a rapper
I'm Terror Squad beta kappa, everybody's favorite rapper
Grand imperial, college material, insane criminal
The same nigga who known to blow out your brain mineral
I reign subliminal inside your visual
Try to supply your physical with my spiritual side of this lyrical
I'll appear in your dreams, like Freddy do, no kidding you
Even if I stuttered, I would still sh-sh-shit on you
Soon as I chitter chatter, your shit'll shatter
I'm the kid out of the Bronx that'll stomp you to death like it didn't matter
I'm even better than before, iller metaphors
Killers bet it all on Pun 'cause one verse dead 'em all
[Chorus]
John Blaze
John Blaze
John Bl-Blaze
John Blaze
Johnny Blaze, ain't a damn thing changed

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Ayo, my attitude is subject to change
I mess around and spit twelve at the driver's side door of your Range
Six hit you, the other six up in your dame
Mafia style, leave you with your watch and your chains
So take heed that not only can I flow, I can aim
'Cause y'all misdemeanor niggas can't stand the reign
Better believe that whenever I see y'all, I'ma test you
Only 'cause I know that faggots respect pressure
Hardcore, like shit you get kicked out the yard for
Kiss ain't the cops, but I lock niggas up
You could meet me in my cell, I soap and sock niggas up
Far as the flow go, you could let your dough show
Put your money on the table, we could battle on cable
Y'all hot dog niggas get Nathan's
Fuck around with Jason, that shorty from The Lox, John Blazin

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
My son cool out (What), don't beef, yo, throw the tool out
Let's run these niggas, kidnap they work, make 'em move out
Crushed hash, hands is like glass, keep the heat in the dash
Did some dirt for some work, caught a gash
The flicker blocker, wicked sneaker rocker footwear
Strike me out, God, stackin' up joints, rack 'em like Footlocker
This is raw, raw like fuck kid, represent here to Crenshaw
Hold my words stronger than a Benz store
Relentless, the anthology consolidated with the quickness
Dress up in the wig and blouse, killer sickness
Lex imagination large, gold cards
Beat the bogus squad brains that connect, put on the Older God
Specialist, iciclist, Woolrich collar
Feelin' the rich, work for every dollar, don't snitch
That's why broke niggas who got heart, God, sign 'em up
Start the wind up, we John Blazin, don up in the line up
[Chorus]
John Blaze
John Blaze
John Blaze
Johnny Blaze ain't a damn thing changed

[Verse 5: Fat Joe]
It's simple mathematics, you gotta love us
'Cause Joey Crack plus gat equals a lotta dead motherfuckers
Just when you thought I was done, I recruited Pun
Terror Squad Enterprise, undisputed don
I'm from the slums where it's worse, bust with guns 'til it hurts
For fuckin' with my funds on the first
And go to church like a mobster
Discuss your death over shrimp and lobster with my Cuban partners
Lucas with the cartridge, twenty shot
Run up on any block, disrespect any cop
Used to run many spots, now I own shops
Gore-Tex with the lock, five sixty-four bills a pop
I'm hot, who wanna get burned?
I fire one in your knot and watch your whole fuckin' head turn
You best learn to parlay, I've had a hard day
Fuck around with the Don and get John Blazed

Johnny Blaze ain't a damn thing changed

Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
'Cause you know I gotta win everyday-day (Go)
See, they really really wanna pop me (Blow)
Just know that you will never flop me (Oh)
And I know that I can be a little cocky (No)
You ain't never gonna stop me
Every time I come, a nigga gotta set it
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it (Woo)
Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta show that
Any little thing a nigga think that he be doin' (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm gonna da-da-da-da (Damn)
Then I'm gonna murder everything and anything
A ba-da-boom, a ba-da-bing, I gotta do a lotta things
That make it clearer to a couple niggas
That I always win and then I gotta get it again and again and then again
And I be doin' it to death
And now I move a little foul, a nigga better call a ref'
And everybody know my style and niggas know that I'm the best
When it come to doin' this and I be bangin' on my chest
And I bang in the East and I'm bangin' in the West
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you could read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next? (Let's go!)
See the way we on and then we all up in the race
And you know we gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
And we strugglin' and hustlin' and sendin' in and gettin'
And we always gotta do it, take it to another place
Gotta taste it, and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne
Better know I gotta have it (Have it)

Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy

Got money on my radar, dressed like a skater
Got a big house, came with an elevator
You niggas ain't eatin', fuck it, tell a waiter

I'm writing you to
Catch you up on places I've been

[Wale-Talking]
To whom it may concern
I refuse to be another being on this earth
I'm breathing for a purpose
I wanna be the center piece of my entire culture
And I've been thinking bout you
Cause you've done such
By doing such
I get a pen and paper
Write you a letter cause you are appreciated
I'm dreaming to be great
While working on my mistakes
You promise that's change
I'm doing the same thing

[Wale-Verse 1]
Dear Mr.Obama
I'm hoping that this letter reaches you
In good spirits
Lord knows you've been busy
But I just wanna know if I speak could you listen
We in the same city I was hoping I could visit ya
If not I'm hoping that this letter could convey how I'm feeling
And you could find interest
First off congratulations on the win
It's time for some change to commence
I gotta question for you man
From an African American stance
Are we expecting too much from your four year plan?
And what about the rappers
That happen to act like a black president
Give us a right to be assholes?
You know
They say your name for attention
But little to no interest after election
Or the too cheap t-shirt sellers
That's making revenue of a name we cherish
As I end this letter
One more thing, I hope you understand your impact on our race
Sincerely Wale
P.S Eh I ain't trying to nit pick
But keep them cigarettes away
[Hook]
I'm writing you to
Catch you up on places I've been
You have this letter

But there's nothing else inside

To whom it may concern
I refuse to be another being on this earth
See I'm breathing for a purpose
I need to be the center piece of my entire culture
And I've been thinking bout you
Cause you've done such
By doing such
I get a pen and paper
Write you a letter cause you are appreciated
Like damn mama the reason I work hard

Not even my favorite rapper
You was bigger than an artist

[Wale-Verse 2]
Dear Pac
I was twelve when the gunned you
Wish you was around now to see what I've become see
You never had a son, In the physical or literal
Years later there's still a bunch of little you's
Never seen you as lyrical
But more as a voice that the whole culture would listen to
Speakin the truth like only you can do
It's only right we lose greatness at its pinnacle
I got a question for ya, little somethin to say
Are you still mad at Biggie ? Are you still mad at Dre ?
And are you happy at the way your legacy portrayed ?
I'm trying to do for D.C what you did for L.A
But music today, it's getting lame for us
They chasing fame rather than making a change for us
They stop being artists, they stop being honest
They want that club shit, ain't no more dear mama's
And you don't know me
But knowin you through music is going to change the world
In the futuren, truly yours , Wale
P.S Hey, How long will they mourn you? Forever and a day

I'm writing you to
Catch you up on places I've been
You have this letter
Finally got excited

So I'm writing you this letter
And I can only hope that you read it if you get it
Hoping if you get it that you won't ever forget it
You won't never forget it
You won't never forget it (x2)

I'm writing you to
Catch you up on places I've been

What you gonna do?

We always knew we were gonna come to this point sooner or later
We have absolutely no option but to move forward
We'll have to set up our own distribution, manufacturing
Run a totally indipendent organization and operation
We still got our connections in Texas, Miami, New York, Chicago
Detroit, and soldiers on the street willing to die
I can't put any cut on the product
I just can't live like that
But from now on if any cops get in our way

Smile in my face and plot to kill me behind doors
I got a new attitude, no trust
Got me in a corner all a nigga can do is bust
It may be you
There's gonna be a lot of dead before I'm through
I'm 'bout to break off niggas who play me and dis' me
Try to switch from side to side like they whip me

You try to dis Chuck, Cube and me

All I ever wanted was a real nigga's praise
But the sad motherfuckin' fact
Is that ain't that many real motherfuckers these days
Game knows game I know too many true players to name
And I can make it in the music or the street game
I still got hoes that'll work, still got crews that'll hit
Still roll with an extra clip
And those who think they'll stop me, doubt it
Those motherfuckers better think about it
You'd best to let me rap
Ice back on the streets?
You don't want that
Cause I break ill
And you'll really have to Body Count the cops I'll kill, it's on

It's on motherfucker you goddamn right
It's on, my royalty cheque, yeah, fool, I write my own
I own my own label put my own shit out
So no one tells me what the fuck to talk about

You need to wake up to my view
I'm fallen off
Ha! Ha! That's a joke!
You motherfuckers are still unknown and broke
And I'm stankin' rich
My fuckin maid lives better than you, bitch
So shut your trap
When it comes to this level of game, you don't know jack
CIA, FBI, IRS
Try those letters out for sweat
But they'll never sweat you son
Cause you're broke and you're dumb and you're no threat to no one
Them fools don't play
I gotta deal with those motherfuckers every day
They'd love to get me behind bars
They hawk a nigga like I'm Carlos Escobar
But in a way I am
Been puttin dope on the street for years and don't give a damn
So I'm thinkin about them, friend
The real motherfuckin gangstas wanna see me end
It's gonna end up in a bloodbath, no doubt
That's the only way I'm going out, it's on

Front in the wrong area, niggas might let it go
Yeah, I love where I'm from all 2.5 million
Sing out

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]Kardinal Offishall
I'm from the depths of Scarborough
One ways of Vaughan Road
Apartments of Flemingdon, shadows in the PO
Every area reppin' the home team
My Italians hold me down, Africans same thing
Portugese get it in, Filipinos rock with me
Nuff Trinis and Yardees holding the block with me
So many faces like we the Winter Olympics
Greatest city ever, after dark you better think quick
Club district, parking lot politicing
We got hotter women than any city admitting
We number 1, check out the figures we gettin
No apologies and never quitting
[Hook]

[Verse 3:]Kardinal Offishall
Regent, Jungle, Vaughan Road, Malvern
Chester Le, Rexdale let the fire burn
If you from Toronto let me see you put a hand up
Born alone die alone, but I'm never on my own
Don't watch no face, stay true is what I was shown
I'm a product of OG's and social workers
3 years of University and Lick's Burgers
Harlem Underground, black owned businesses
Big It Up Hats, and immigrants from long distances
Working class people and some others with some privileges
Any way you look at it we seeing past differences
Yo, I am multiculture
Hand on my ear listening like the Hulkster
And all I'm hearing is we the greatest around
To the grave I'm a rep my town
Yeah"
Murder,Laws,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
Murder, I was your favorite rapper from the future
Now I’m headed back to the past to bring you that murder
Word around the street is I was speaking crucial
To the point that you ain’t have to ask who got that murder
Stop by dead or alive before I put my first word on the pad
I thought about murder, now I’m in the right state of mind
Just to put a flat line on the track ‘cause this is that murder

[Verse 1: Laws]
Why you got those bags under your eyes?
I’m on a grind and I guarantee if you’re fresher than me
Yours ain’t hard as mines, that son still delivered
Damn I should see if I’m as real as my pictures
The Hi-Def ones but I digress son
They wonder if I’m gonna do it for the ladies
My mama Wu-Tang, I'mma do it for the babies
So if you presume I’m outta tune and this is trash
You consume and you got a womb, are you crazy?
Your kids getting gyms from some dudes that’s from Gaise
My mother wouldn’t never let these motherfuckers raise me
And look how I turned out, first show, packed house, look how they turned out
Rap had to die for me to be someone that you heard
I brought it back to life and they accusing me of…
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Laws]
This is that bird, this is that different cat slipping past herbs
This is that Jesse Owens on that bag of crystal, this is that Christ
This is Q and mist, this go right through the gris
You feel it in your bones, the makings of a king
They can see me on the throne especially when I’m grown
You can find me in the zone, market like a Sham-Wow, find me in your homes
I’m official as a guest who consistently hitting these bitches over the fence
Whether I’m kicking writtens or I’m kicking from my head
I’m not offensive but they like did you hear the shit he said?
It’s different, we can distinguish it from top-fold
I’m machine and he’s diesel but he’s not norv
See my skin tone, they wonder what’s my story
As soon the beat drop, they stop talking ’cause this is that…

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Laws]
Pay no mind to you busters, I’m going through it now
I don’t mind roots numbers, being patient saves embarrassment
I rather be a Kweli than a Hamilton
In persons, situations get handled different
But if she swing, best believe I Gucci Mane the chicken
Not violent but my Prada sick, they call it murder
Well if the homicide fits, I wear it but I don’t ever share it
Taking you to school like a parent, tearing in the booth, the truth is apparent
I’m a pirate brushing shit off my shoulder from the parrots
Polly want a cracker? I’m not the type to political rappers
Like Obama, my skin ain’t the factor, I’m covering up murder
You hear me? I’m covering up murder, I said I’m covering up…

Memories,Big Sean,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Sometimes I dream bigger than I live
Sometimes I think better when I’m lit
So go head and light it
Roll it up, ignite it
One time for all my niggas that dreamed it then real life’d it!
I swear I’ve been through everything in life but a coffin
They say sky’s the limit, how bitch? I’m moonwalking!
And my middle name Michael ho
Success is my idol and being broke is my rival
But it’s cool because I got the title ho
See I just want my fantasies in real life
You got everything tell me what it feel like
Muthafuck the radio if I can’t hear mine
They give the wrong niggas more airtime than airlines
Is you feeling me?
If not you feel my energy
See I know I’mma make it, but even if I don’t
Don’t feel bad cuz honestly all these times that I had
Those will be the best memories
[Hook]
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo

[Verse 2]
Are you willing to give up what you love for who you love
Or lose your girlfriend to groupie love
Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs
That's what happens when they need connections and you the plug
How many trends you gotta set til' you considered great?
How many missed calls til' you considered fake?
How many dreams before its considered fate?
I’m eating in a world where I’m considered bait
A workaholic addicted to bills
People addicted to me cuz they addicted to real
My best friend got addicted to pills
I can’t look at him in his eyes, you don’t know how that shit feels mentally!
I ain't trying to rock no shirts that say “in memory”
I’m praying that he make it, wishin' we could go back
Cause honestly all the times that we had
Those be the best memories…
[Hook]
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo

[Verse 3]
Sometimes reality checks are too big to be cashed
Was mailed one when I heard Nique had died in that crash
Seemed like yesterday I just seen him smile and laugh
I’m stressing over little shit
When I should be happy I can
They say my music beating, cause I follow my heart
I always have faith, like who swallows the darts
And with my Mama looking at cribs that we can’t purchase
Houses bigger than a palace
But she a queen, so she deserve it
So I’m focused, they try to throw me off track
But they just hurdles
I’m marathoning to the money and you just running off in a circle
Man, I’m huddled up with my team, in other words my inner circle
Fast forward a few years later
Now we the fucking winner’s circle
Remember the first time I was rhyming for Kan’
Almost as nervous as the first time I rhymed for my mom
Sold out the theater downtown, she said it was perfect
But I already dreamed it
So it felt like I rehearsed it
Much as my grandma took care of me since I was birthed
Sad I used to steal $20 bill right out her purses
No I ain’t perfect, tryna make a gift out of a curse
Life out of a hearse
And if I die, of course I have the memories..

Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories

You see..
What, what sounds to you like a big load of trashy, old noise
Is in fact the brilliant music of a genius: myself
That music is so powerful that it's quite beyond my control
And uh, when I'm in the grips of it
I don't feel pleasure and I don't feel pain
Either physically or emotionally
Do you understand what I'm talking about?
Have you, have you ever felt like that?
When you just, when you just...
You couldn't feel anything and you didn't want to either

Aye man, I appreciate the love you know
But y'all need to back up man
Yo, I don't want them to shut us down, you know?
Y'all dropped a piece of your pay check to get in here fam
Oh, that's how you want it? Alright, enjoy it while it last

[Hook]
I rock, I roll, I get it, I live it, I know
You got problems? See me at my show
Good luck gettin' through the front door
‘Cause we wall to wall action and I can barely breathe ‘em
About to bring it back home, back home, back home
[Verse One]
My stomach rumblin' but I been fed already
I’m seein' 2010 but my vision 20-20
And people question am I’m spittin' or not
Nothin' to lose, I don’t gotta prove diddly squat
This is for Biggie and Pac, Pun, LJ baby
Thinkin' I’m high grade, fuck you, pay me
And now I’m passive, don’t wanna be cursin'
But you made up man, don’t wanna be person
Too many cuts, we gonna need surgeons
We ridin' to the death, we gonna need hearses
Top spot, got my eye on that
I got the first on deck like the triumph track
‘Cause I bomb so atomic, I’m puttin' my fam on
Till the whole room spinnin', I’m gonna vomit
Motion sickness, too many moves made
Get off my Kool-Aid, player, I rock

I rock, I roll, I get it, I live it, I know
You got problems? See me at my show
Good luck gettin' through the front door

About to bring it back home, back home, back home

[Verse Two]
I ain’t tryin' to do the humpty dance
I’m a rock star, give me drunkee fans
And you ask why I rock out and shout shit
Too much power, not enough outlets
Me and Mase Caine go back like Forrest and Bubba
Though we ain’t brothers, got it?
What he say? Man, I’m on it
Caine got a blade like Clockwork Orange
Forget about these mixtapes from these two-faces
They don’t drop jewels, they drop money on jewel cases
Come on son, who’s time are you wastin'?
Takin' the cash just to have a huge bracelet
You don’t move me one iota
You chicken noodle soup on the side with a soda
You bumpin' to a dime or you die just to know her?
But she’s a fan, she’s dyin' to come over little soldier

Yeah

[Verse 1]
Walking my poodles, man it never gets old
When my dog's on the leash I got bitches on the hold
A first A.I.D.S. kit? That's a rhesus monkey
I bust more nuts than a pistachio junkie
I get more ass than a giant donkey stable
Got more lines than Whitney Houston's coffee table
I get more head than grammar school lice
I'm like a walking glacier, I'm so decked out with ice
Did you poop a virgin, 'cause that shit is tight
Jack ain't Black and Barry ain't White
I do drugs in the bedroom
Lie on your back
'Cause I gots the pipe and you gots the crack
And though I'm sexually straight, you're bound to find
I'm mentally gay, 'cause I'll blow your mind
The parents be snickering, ""He shouldn't have written it,""
But I'm constipated--couldn't give a shit

My name is Bo, fo sho, a born Bostonian
Aryan librarian and the wordsmith--sonian

I gave it this little part to give it continuity

And the fellas say, ""Hey moron, pass the gin,""
'Cause I'm an oxymoron breathing oxygen
Give me the bottle, I'll chug two thirds
'Cause you bitches know fractions speak louder than words
And the ladies say, ""Hey fellas, I'm keeping it tight
And if you play your cards right, you can have me tonight
Should I blow you or beat you, brass or percussion
Oh stop, period, end of discussion

Aryan librarian and the wordsmith--sonian

Walking through the garden with food at my feet
Picked up the celery but dropped the beet
And then I picked it up
Yeah
Listen

We're in the hood, I'll take what you give me
Was Einstein's theory good? Relatively
A smart queen's kingdom? It doesn't mix
Illiterate literates, a bunch of Moby Dicks
Get thee to a punnery, oh just a feel yah
Take you with a condom, stainless steel yah
Half a pound of turkey breast, half a pound of chicken tits
Why are only crackers staying at the Ritz?
Poverty, racism, isn't it strange? Only the homeless are begging for change
A shocked Sherlock. What, son? Rosa Parks didn't call shotgun
Here's a bit of irony: a Ford Focus driver's got A.D.D
How'd I come to master all of these things?
Like a tampon thief, I had to pull some strings
I had to pull some strings!

It was a murder
Jake just hit the corner, people swarmin'
Three in the mornin', I jumped out my cab like ""Fuck!""
Niggas is buck, mega bloodshed, the tape's red
I heard some bird whisper, ""Yo, he should've ducked""
I puffed the lila, just before I hit the scene for real-er
I'm all high, it's late, I'm lookin' down at the fella
Shit's pushed in, ambulance placed him on some cushion
His moms had a stare I wouldn't dare second look when I murk
It hurt, kind of took it as a brief reminder
That the street's designed to stop ya life clock, the beast'll time ya
Cell to cell, suspect-ass nigga, you fail
First time locked in Comstock, my mind blocks the frail
Burstin', blastin' at you, forty cal' shells split your dry cell

Dear God, I want the riches
Money hungry bitches infested
Givin' the jealous niggas sickness to witness
My crew dresses in vests-es, feel the essence
Try to test this, scientist, able and reckless
Slaughter, Nautica down, frames look petite
Ten millies, minks designed just for my physique
I keep a low pro' as if I owe, bless the flow lovely
My pants hang while I'm dancin', sippin' the bubbly
Hey, me no worry, hashish keep my eyes Chinese
Rollin' two Phillies together make blunts Siamese
I meant it, I represent it, descendant made of
Early natives that were captured and taught to think backwards
Trapped us in a cracker's psychiatric, it's massive
A Million Man March, alert the masses
Tan Clarks, Armani in small print upon my glasses
Don assassins, Armageddon
The weddin' of a freak and a beat
Seven heads, got the righteous threatened
Life Was Written, the plot curves behind the settin'
Comprehend the grammar, math we own
Are you the type of nigga to shoot a leg to get your name known?
I flip the brain tone, niggas get hit and wrapped in plastic
The mic I strike in vain, givin' the pain of what a MAC is
What you wit'? Lucci or drama?
No sleep means insomnia
No need to check the clock, the streets'll time ya

Finally back in Toronto, it's better here
I just wanna be anywhere but everywhere
I'm being lazy at the crib kushin' it up
I get enough exercise just pushing my luck
Sitting back thinking, damn, where did they go?
They used to be the ones to watch Ricki Lake show
And now I see 'em picking up the pieces
One too many starting over speeches
I guess, it’s back to me like it always was
Me and the OVO set like it always was
A little money on the counter I left for my girl
With a note I’m trying to see the rest of the world
It all looked so amazing when we are growing up
Used to sit back and say I know I’ll get a model one day
But all the money and the rap game slow as fuck
And all the models from the hood, Project Runway
Yeah, it’s whatever
You know, feeling good, living better
But it’s evident that nothing can prepare us for certain moments that you just gotta cherish
Like this young girl had my lyrics tatted on her arm last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with, yeah
Feel like I been here before, huh?
Yeah, I still got ten years to go, huh?
This is the only sound you should fear
Man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?

Uh, uh, let's take it back to basics
When shit gets worse, we converse
How we need a new balance
Before the lines get crossed like Asics
Just look at what we got, if we don't shoot the Reeboks
This is a beat that no flow can detox, so the respect is due
Like my Louie bag, I don't wanna have to check you
I'm Chi as Buck-Fiftys and Pelle Pelle leathers
Some say my beats made the Bulls play better
I say, black on black is the hate that hate made
Sara Lee with the dough, I'm talkin' bout the cake maid
McDonald's with the flow, served over a billion
You've seen the video, words over the building
Uh, I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give you this feeling
And when the Workout Plan ain't work out, man
Me and Common is back on the corners again
On the corner

[Verse 2: Common]
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh-uh, uh-uh
I open my eyes, the corner is like African tribes
The black is subsidized, the black enterprise, the passion arise
The youth fantasize, who got some cash in they eyes
If youth dies, mamas askin' rationalize
Tryna build a spot where ghetto bastards could rise
The ghetto has been bastardized by those that capitalize
Wonder if it's a plan that the master devised
To bring his people to a land where the blacks are despised?

How I’m gon' deal with all the bullshit
Niggas sendin' shots my way
You put a hit out on me, think that I’m gon' stop? No way
Gon' have to kill me, or witness a nigga livin' so filthy
Young, black, and wealthy, nigga for that I’m guilty
Still see all the fake shit, it’s funny somehow
Thought the money could erase it, no matter how
Much dough you got you gotta face it, and to my niggas gone
Hope you in a better place, if I make it I’ll holla…
[Chorus]
See world, huh-uh
You’re no good, uh-uh, hey
Yeah, see world
You’re no good, uh-uh
No matter how I hate flashbacks and rewinds
Can’t escape the pain that be trapped in my mind
Nigga, see world
You’re no good

[Verse 2]
Uh, I got a chip on my shoulder the size of a Golden Nugget
The industry overlook me, for that I be holding grudges
Wouldn’t take a chance on me, suddenly it's, oh you love it
Let's get a Cole feature, that's gon' put you over budget, now
Picture being broke without no pot to piss in
And then suddenly your idols is your competition
Used to be like God to me, slowly losing my religion
As these notes from my composition turn to competitions, then
Put it out and hope the world sing
We sippin’ liquor for the pain that the world bring
We had dreams just to make it up the flag pole
Just to find out that our heroes were some assholes, y’all don't hear me
Maybe I had the world figured out wrong
When these niggas go from singing our songs and waiting on you
'Bout a year later the same ones be hatin’ on you
Every other record these rappers be faking on you
Dog, we sing your songs but we know that ain’t you
We know you gotta make the people pay you
'Cause either you play the game or watch the game play you
And be that broke muthafucker talkin' 'bout “I stayed true”
[Chorus]
Yeah, see world, huh-uh
You’re no good, uh-uh, hey
Yeah, see world
You’re no good, uh-uh
No matter how I hate flashbacks and rewinds
Can’t escape the pain that be trapped in my mind
Nigga, see world
You’re no good

[Sample]
By candlelight, they stood as one, numb with shock and disbelief. A little girl's body, found Monday, is believed to be five-year-old Shaniya Davis, missing since last Tuesday. Davis has been charged with the unthinkable; prostituting her five year old daughter. Security camera’s spotted a man carrying Shaniya into a hotel last Tuesday. This man, police said, is now charged with Shaniya’s kidnapping. Search parties found the girl’s body yesterday a 100 feet off-road, wearing only a t-shirt

[Chorus]
Yeah, see world, huh-uh
You’re no good, uh-uh, hey
Yeah, see world
You’re no good, uh-uh
No matter how I hate flashbacks and rewinds
Can’t escape the pain that be trapped in my mind
Nigga, see world
You’re no good"
Can Anybody Hear Me?,Nicki Minaj,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
If you move, I'll fall
(Davaughn on the beat)
I'm leanin on you, you baby, you baby

[Verse]
I push, p-p-push it, I p-p-push it like I'm in labor
And he'll t-t-teach me to, teach me to love my neighbor
Just w-w-wait up, I'm processin' all the data
Processin' all the data, p-p-processin' all the haters
You was writin' disses, I was takin' pictures
Signin' autographs for all of my bad bitches
And in the nick of time it just dawned on me
I am Nicki Minaj and it's all on me
But hey, maybe I'll never win, maybe I'm settlin'
Can't let the devil in, I'm a comic book heroine
But when the wind blows, I'm so Marilyn
(I'm so Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn)
Yo, write it down, take a picture, bitches, e-mail that
I came to save a thing called female rap
But I hope my ninja powers
Don't fuck around and offend you cowards
You mad at me cause you think I got it easy
If we was in the second grade, then you would tease me
Ya see, you still a lil snotty-nose hood rat
""I love Nicki"" scribbled all over you book bag
I love you too
I just wish your mother would've hugged you too
You know Nicki love the kids
Yellow brick road, lookin' for the Wiz
But when it rains, it pours for real
Def Jam said I'm no Lauryn Hill
Can't rap and sing on the same CD
The public won't get it, they got A.D.D
See Nicki, follow the rules
Go and say your prayers and get ready for school
[Spoken Interlude]
Yeah, follow the rules
Let me say my prayers and get ready for school
Dear God, I am only what you made me
And I appreciate everything that you gave me
But like, I don't wanna do it no more
Sort of lost sight of what I'm doin' it for
Thought that I was doin' somethin' good for the game
Until they all started throwin' dirt on my name
Tell Debbie, I really, really tried
That I said I'm sorry, but I had to say goodbye
Tell Fendi, I'll never forget him
And please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted
(I'll never forget it)
(Please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted)

Wanna blow me kisses, right around the zipper
Down and drop it to the flo’ and I ain’t even gotta tip her
R.I.P. to Jack Tripper, two up in the crib
They say they wanna have my babies then they better get a bib
Here they come

[Verse 5: Diamond]
I came in as a rookie with my pockets on fat
Got a million dollar pussy, bitch, my cat got stacks
Uhh, n-n-n-now that a boss bitch move
If you go against the boss but the boss never loses
Got a house on the water so I can feed the gators
Rasberry Porsche, 32 flavors
My bread so swoll, I can’t fit it in my wallet
My pockets on big, Christopher Wallace

Do it shawty, let me say

[Verse: MF DOOM]
The rest is empty with no brain, but the clever nerd
The best MC with no chain ya ever heard
Take it from the TEC-9 holder
They've bit but don't know their neck shine from Shinola
Everything that glitters ain't fishscale
Lemme think, don't let her faint get Ishmael
A shot of Jack got her back it's not an act stack
Forgot about the cackalack, holla back; clack-clack, blocka
Villainy, feel him in ya heart chakra, chart-toppa
Start-shit stoppa, be a smart shoppa
Shot-a-Cop day around the way 'bout to stay
But who'd a know there's two mo' that wonder where the shooter go
'Bout to jet, get him, not a bet, dead 'em
Let 'em spit the venom said 'em got a lot of shit with 'em
Let the rhythm hit 'em, it's stronger in the other voice
We makes the joints that make 'em spread 'em butta moist
Man, please, the stage is made of panties
From the age of baby hoochies on to the grannies
Ban me the dough rake, daddy
The flow make her fatty shake, patty cake, patty cake
For fake, if he was Anita Baker's man
He'd take her for her masters, hit it once an' shake her hand
On some ol' thank ya ma'am an' ghost her
She could mind the toaster if she sign the poster
A whole host of roller coaster riders
Not enough tracks (Is it?)
Hot enough black (For ya)
It's too hot to handle, you got blue sandals
Who shot ya? Ooh got you new spots to vandal?
Do not stand still, boast yo' skills
Close but no krills, toast for po' nils, post no bills
Coast to coast Joe Shmoe's flows ill, go chill
Not supposed to overdose No-Doz pills
Off pride tykes talk wide through scar meat
Off sides like how Worf rides with Starfleet
Told ya, on some get-rich shit
As he gets older he gets colder than a witch tit
This is it, make no mistakes
Where my nigga go?
Figaro, Figaro
O's beats and my rhymes attack
A scary act, all black like Ms. Mary Mack
Wait 'til you see 'em live on the piano
DOOM sings soprano, like, ""Una, duociano""
My momma told me
Blast 'em and pass her her glass of Ol' E
Not to be troublesome
But I could sure use a quick shot of double rum
No stick of bubble gum
I like ice cream, we could skip the weddin'
Have a nice dream, she only let him stick the head in"
Foolish Pride,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Eminem & Manix]
Yo man, yo Marsh, man
Yo, you've been kickin' all this shit about yourself
What of the homies, man?
Oh you want one about the posse? Alright

[Chorus: Eminem]
Ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride

[Verse: Eminem]
Well, foolish pride has a lot of things to say
You got foolish pride, like you got tooth decay
But tooth decay is another problem
So let's take this ole foolish pride problem and solve it
Now, when I talk about foolish pride
I mean blacks and whites taking different sides
When blacks and whites take different sides
Unity never happens, and we will subside
We will subside and hatred will release
And everything will just crush that peace
But when we crush that peace, you see we start hatin' each other
But remember, you are my brother, and you are my sister
Just like I'm a mister
I seen a black girlfriend and I kissed her
I kissed her, I placed it on her cheek
And she didn't come back 'til next week
Now it was next week and she was back again
Wanting to kiss a white kid
So she was my girlfriend, we started going out
But that's okay because we were black and white
Blacks and whites sometimes mix
But black girls only want your money 'cause they're dumb chicks
So I'ma say like this
Don't date a black girl, take it as a diss
If you want, but if you don't
I'ma tell you like this, I surely won't
Never date a black girl because blacks only want your money
And that shit ain't funny
So I'ma say, ""Look, honey
Why do you do this?
You know, you step up to me like you a Brutus
Then you try to grab my spinach
Because it's green and that's cash
So get outta here, 'cause I don't need your ass""
I said that before, but that's okay because, like I said, you're a whore
Black girls and white girls just don't mix
Because black girls are dumb and white girls are good chicks
White girls are good, I like white girls
I like white girls all over the world
White girls are fine and they blow my mind
And that's why I'm here now telling you this rhyme
'Cause black girls, I really don't like
We don't mix, it's like riding a bike
When you're peddling hard, uphill both ways
You know it's kinda hard and that's why I say to you
I'm giving you a little advice
Don't date a black girl, if you do it once, you won't do it twice
You won't ever do it again because they'll take your money
And that ain't funny
So I'ma say, ""Look, honey""
I've already said that before
But like I said again you're nothing but a big whore
So when Mike catch on the bass line
That's okay 'cause we will not just waste time
I'll get straight to the point, black girls are bitches
That's why I'ma tell you, you better pull up your britches
'Cause all that cash is making your ass drag
From the boyfriend you ganked and that's pretty bad
I mean that's pretty sad when you're dating a black guy
And then you turn around and fuck another big black guy
Now that's pretty wrong, but you're just ganking
But that's okay because you need a god damn spanking
From me, the funky M&M
I'm busting rhymes and I'm swallowing phlegm
I'm busting a freestyle just like this
I say, ""swallowing phlegm"" and Howard gets pissed
But when Howard gets pissed that's okay
Because he leaves and he doesn't show up for two more days
So I'll just worry about that problem when I come to it
I'll cross that bridge when I come to it
'Cause— I forgot the chorus
But that's okay 'cause y'all saying, ""Bust a rhyme for us""
So I'ma bust another rhyme about this black girl
She turned out to be a fuckin' wack girl
A wack girl, because black girls ain't funny
All they want is your goddamn money
They take you for everything you've got
And then you stand with a bunch of snot in your hand
So I'ma kick it to you just like this
How does the chorus go? I forgot
But that's okay, 'cause I'ma tell you in stride
I'ma say, ""Ole foolish pride""
[Chorus: Eminem]
Ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh
Date a white girl, 'cause they got the raw hide"
Fatima,K'naan,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'dance', 'jazz', 'blues']","[Verse 1]
Picture the morning taste and devour
We rise early pace up the hour
Streets is bustlin' hustlin' their heart out
You can't have the sweet with no sour
Spices, herbs, the sweet scent of flower
She came out precisely the hour
Clouds disappear, the sun shows the power
No chance of a probable shower
I fell in love with my neighbors' daughter
I wanted to protect and support her
Never mind I'm just 12 and a quarter
I had dreams beyond our border

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it true when they say all you need is just love? (Is it true?)
What about those who I have loved?
Only to find that it's taken away
And why do they say that the children have rights to be free? (To be free)
What about those who I've known
Whose memory still lives inside of me
[Chorus]
Fatima, what did the young man say, before he stole you away?
On that fateful day, Fatima
Fatima, did he know your name or the plans we made?
To go to New York City, Fatima

[Verse 2]
And after school, we studied the lessons
I ask God to slow down the seconds
He does the opposite that's what I'm guessin'
I better chill and count my own blessings
Fatima, Fatima what is the matter?
How come you ain't come up the ladder?
So we can be like there's no tomorrow
Damn you gonna make me wait until tomorrow
She spoke Arabic and Swahili
She'd say ""Upendo anta Habibi""
You so bright, you shine like my TV
Then one day she never came to meet me

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it true when they say all you need is just love? (Is it true?)
What about those who I have loved?
Only to find that it's taken away
And why do they say that the children have rights to be free? (To be free)
What about those who I've known
Whose memory still lives inside of me

Fatima, what did the young man say, before he stole you away?
On that fateful day, Fatima
Fatima, did he know your name or the plans we made?
To go to New York City, Fatima
Fatima, what did the young man say, before he stole you away?
On that fateful day, Fatima
Fatima, did he know your name or the plans we made?
To go to New York City, Fatima

[Verse 3]
If beauty was in the eyes of the beholder
How come everyone hushed when she walked by
How come girls would look just to scold her
How come the angel wanted to hold her?
Fatima, Fatima I'm in America
I make rhymes and I make 'em delicate
You would have liked the parks in Connecticut
You would have said I'm working too hard again
Damn you, shooter, Damn you the building
Whose walls hid the blood she was spillin'
Damn you country so good at killin'
Damn you feelin' for persevering

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it true when they say all you need is just love? (Is it true?)
What about those who I have loved?
Only to find that it's taken away
And why do they say that the children have rights to be free? (To be free)
What about those who I've known

I don't want you to shed a tear

Travel in your mind explore your sexuality
Melt your imagination and mold it into reality

Like a mother to a son but none of them overrated
They know others due to one our destiny is to make it
Got to thank you just for sharin your world
It's so real and inspirational oh no reason for thinkin I am incapable
Of takin on the duty of makin you interchangeable
The thought is sensational it's perfect bliss
I'm ready to take the Milky Way to your Hershey's Kiss
You know my tongue's got batteries in it
The bedroom we lose calories in it, and start families in it
And don't worry cause the situation is under control
So let me dive in your heart and swim around in your soul

Yo, man, we chilling, just funky fresh jam

Many people tell me this style is terrific
It is kinda different, but let's get specific
KRS-One specialize in music
I'll only use this type of style when I choose it
Party people in the place to be, KRS-One attacks
You got dropped off MCA 'cause the rhymes you wrote was wack

If you pop that junk up in the Bronx you might not live, 'cause you're in

I am a teacher and others are kings
If that's the title they earn, well it's well deserved, but
Without a crown, see, I still burn
You settle for a pebble, not a stone like a rebel
KRS-One is the holder of a boulder
Money folder
You want a fresh style, let me show ya
Now way back in the days when hip-hop began
With Coke De La Rock, Kool Herc and then Bam
B-boys ran to the latest jam
But when it got shot up, they went home and said, ""Damn
There's got to be a better way to hear our music every day""
B-boys getting blown away but coming outside anyway
They tried again outside in Cedar Park
Power from a street light made the place dark
But, yo, they didn't care, they turned it out
I know a few understand what I'm talking about
Remember Bronx River rolling thick
With Kool DJ Red Alert and Chuck Chillout on the mix
When Afrika Islam was rocking the jams
And on the other side of town was a kid named Flash
Patterson and Mill Brook projects
Casanova all over, you couldn't stop it
The Nine Lives Crew, the Cypress Boys
The real Rock Steady taking out these toys
As odd as it looked, as wild as it seem
I didn't hear a peep from a place called Queens
It was '76 to 1980
The dreads in Brooklyn was crazy
You couldn't bring out your set with no hip-hop
Because the pistols would go *gunshots*
So why don't you wise up? Show all the people in the place that you are wack
Instead of tryna take out LL, you need to take your homeboys off the crack
'Cause if you don't, well then, their nerves will become shot
And that would leave the job up to my own Scott La Rock, and he's from
[Chorus]
South Bronx, the South-South Bronx
South Bronx, the South-South Bronx
South Bronx, the South-South Bronx
South Bronx, the South-South Bronx
South Bronx, the South-South Bronx
South Bronx, the South-South Bronx
South Bronx, the South-South Bronx
South Bronx, the South-South Bronx

Uptown in this bitch, don't make a sound in this, shh
Now let me whisper in ya' ear
Every single word your little ear wanna hear
Flip ya' body over, have no fear

And if your pussy stank, girl, you know you better douche it
You're nasty, girl, now wash that stanky, funky, funky pussy, bitch
Stop talkin' that shit and suck a nigga dick for an outfit ha
And I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place 'cause you and your man be planning to hate
I'm so hood
And she likes it, and when we fuck, I'm keepin' on my Nikes
I'll tear that pussy up, I'll tear that pussy up

When I can just bend you over and do what I told ya'
Do what I wanna, do what I wanna
Ya' heard me, I gotta lie, like

She forgets how to walk, I better teach her
I got her walkin' funny, just tell 'em that your feet hurt
You'll probably see her on one of my t-shirts

Make you lose control and all her girls know
That I hit it right at night, I'm a pro

The ice in the watch reflects the light to her
The money quite green and the ice light bluer
The swag might kill her, so I said good night to her
She don't want me to leave, I can see right through her
So we dipped out, burn one, trip out
Get low like Caribbean limbo
Didn't go out like light, baby girl, get right
Head so swole my hat don't fit right
We can cruise in the car or we could take flight
The middle of the night, make your body eight-like
Mike Vick against the Eagles
Call myself a king 'cause I'm regal
To be this hot is not legal
But we don't care—listen, baby, it's a fact that

We can go deep and I can shark attack that

Every anywhere: heights, plains, peaks or valleys
Entrances, exits, vestibules and alleys
Winding roads that test the firm nerve
Fortune or fatal behind the blind curve
The engine oil purr, lights flash to a blur
Speed work through the Earth, make your motor go ""Skrt!""
Tonight at noon, watch a bad moon rising
Identities in crisis and conflict diamonds
Blinding, staring at lights 'til they cryin'
Bone gristle poppin' from continuous grindin'
Grapes of wrath in a shapely glass
Ingredients influential on your ways and acts
Zero tolerance to raise the tax

Lost in translation or just lost in traffic?
Yo, I don't wanna floss; I done lost my passion
And I ain't trying to climb; yo, I lost my traction
They makin' me break, my contents under pressure, do not shake
I'm workin' while the boss relaxin'

Money Chris Paul, (it was) like this short
It was kinda hard to get the whole puzzle working with half a jigsaw
I got mine, let me help you get yours without getting ripped off
I left a trail nigga, follow it
And when it's gone, make a new one, don't remodel shit
Oh!

[Hook: Bryan Adams - Brothers Under The Sun Sample]
We are like birds of a feather
We are two hearts joined together
We will be forever as one
My brother under the sun
[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Make your own motherfucking footsteps nigga, don't follow mine!
Huh!? I got great problems though, my problems are good!

L-Look, look, look

New suit, dude nervous (what else?)
Old case, new judge, new verdict (what else?)
A new outcome like somebody reversed it
(I mean I'm) I feel like I'm a new man, a new purpose
(Oh!) It's like a nigga ain't feeling so worthless
Kneel down and worship, all them years was worth it
So when he opened his mouth, I was stunned
He said, You can't deny man his son. Be clear
So if he wanna be there, you let him be there
Be fair, I mean, I can see he wants to be near
I can see that he cares
I'll lock your ass up you don't oblige, beware. (I mean it)
She stared, she scared
My lil dude always get the world from me
And you want him to have the world, just not from me
Back like I never left, was never forced away
Got nothing more to say. Oh!

We are like birds of a feather
We are two hearts joined together
We will be forever as one
My brother under the sun
[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
When I see you I'm disgusted (nigga!)
Can't believe I was ever in love wit (nigga!)
Must've been dusted, cause you look like shit
All these years, they ain't done you no justice. (Look at'chu!)
I mean you all fucked up, can't get cash
Still bitter over a past you can't get passed. (Huh?!)
Just sad, get mad cause my bitch bad
Ay'day she switch heels, switch bags. (Whoa!)
It's like we living on a dock nigga, big pad
You can't afford a deposit on my closet. (Not even)
Since you, all I ever known was fly shit
Unfortunately, you ain't fitting that logic
Cause you're much less
Sometimes you gotta stand by your failures to recognize your success
Still, I'll be the bigger man and wish her all the best
While knowing she'll never get it
So why would she ever quit it, it's ridiculous

No I ain't never seen money like you got
Nobody got that kind of money in the boondocks
So if you take me up and show me the balcony looking over
The Hollywood valley I'll make your balloon pop
Popstars like you need a dude like me
To appreciate your wealth
I know you got a elevator in your house

Wanna go get breakfast?

Always hanging in Guys and Dolls

And we'd slide to the mall
Yeah I came to the club in a pair of Famous jeans and a DTA hoody
But I'm walking through the party with Rogue Status looking for Beverly Hill goodies

That beautiful behind inspires me
Makes one of my rhymes harder
Your daddy made a fine daughter
Make me wanna turn this wine from water
Keep the party going in the 808 blowing cause Drama made a beat that'll climb the chart up
Money, money, money, money, money
Ain't it funny what a honey in a Lamborghini will do
Some will run into a hundred dollar bill
And drill a dick on any Tom and Harry with a 24 inch shoes
But come and explore this dude
Analyze my swing

[Intro: Sample]
""They stay...
Strange ways...""

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
Wreak havoc, beep beep it's mad traffic
Sleek and lavish people speaking leaking to the maverick
He see as just another felony drug arrest
Any day could be the one he pick the wrong thug to test
Slug through the vest, shot in the street
For pulling heat on a father whose baby's gotta eat
And when they get hungry, it ain't shit funny
Paid to interfere with how a brother get his money
Now, who's the real thugs, killers and gangsters?
Set the revolution, let the things bust and thank us
When the smoke clear, you can see the sky again
There will be the chopped off heads of Leviathan

[Interlude: Sample and MF DOOM]
My friend, they call 'em strangers
Anybody talk to him end up in some danger
""They'll never change...
They stay...
Strange ways...""
Can't reform 'em
[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
They pray four times a day, they pray five
Who ways is strange when it's time to survive
Some will go of they own free will to die
Others take them with you when they blow sky high
What's the difference? All you get is lost children
While the bosses sit up behind the desks, it cost billions
To blast humans in half, into calves and arms
Only one side is allowed to have bombs
It's like making a soldier drop his weapon
Shooting him, and telling him to get to stepping
Obviously, they came to portion up his fortune
Sounds to me like that old robbery/extortion

[Interlude: Sample and MF DOOM]
""They'll never change...
They stay...""
Same Game
""Strange ways...""
Ya can't reform 'em

[Outro: Sample]
...that Mary was goin' around with an old flame
That burned me up, because I know he was just feeding her a line!

But I carried on!"

Aight, it’s time to get in
Now where should I begin?
To run back the ratchetness to 2010
Profound Sounds, ya’ll cut the track up
I’ma get it in, this the 2010 Rap Up!

Now Waka Flocka went hard and got shot in the paint
Kelis went a little harder, took Nas to the bank
All that bread on the monthly, son that’s crazy
Did I mention the fact she only had one baby?
Then the quake hit Haiti and left us in awe
So pray for them and pray you never see the things they saw
We Are The World got made just to donate bucks
No “I” in we though, I just think we fucked that up
Sade came back and blessed the world with a gift
John Mayer went there and let the N-word slip
And Yung Berg got robbed by his peers
It’s not ’09 though, he just seems to do that every year
50 Cent tried to take out Ross
Look like it ain’t work Fif, you might have to take that loss
Rozay, he had some heat
Had everybody from the ‘burbs thinking they was Big Meech
Ross had a good year, that’s fact
But him bagging Stacey Dash?
Mmm, I don’t know ’bout that
Now I might sound thirsty
But Erykah Badu’s video? Wooh, Lord have mercy
And I don’t mean to sound foul
But if I could hit that, I’d dress up like a clown right now
So don’t tempt me
And nobody had one
But we was rapping ’bout Beamer, Benz and Bentleys
Mel Gibson, Spazzed out for real
Idiots of the year? BP, for the oil spill
And Wayne went to jail for his gat
They said he had a music player, where he hide that at?
No matter where you looked, it was hard to miss Drake
But easy to miss 50 when he lost that weight
LeBron made a decision, that move was bold
But he had to take the heat once the Heat got cold
Hey Cleveland, I’ll holler
‘Bron’s the reason a hot dog in Cleveland will cost ya 84 dollars
The iPhone prototype, that got jacked
Shout to rappers that was dumb enough to touch Kat Stacks
I know what you thinking kid
And no, I didn’t touch her, but I know a lot of rappers that did
Kanye had Twitter going nuts
Man y’all funny, since when you cared about the World Cup?
Facebook, talk of the town
And don’t lie, you know you was crying right along with Chris Brown
But in the new year, what I don’t wanna see
Is Montana Fishburne or a movie in 3D
And Swizz wifed Alicia Keys
The volcano cloud had me and Jazzy Jeff stuck overseas
And rappers, they weren’t exciting
But I’d hate to see your parents if you came out looking like 50 Tyson
And Antoine Dodson, that was that was just trife
With all that “Hide ya kids and hide ya wife”
Man, the industry sucks
Cause we started off laughing at both of them
But now they laughing at us
I’m just asking
How Lady Gaga can wear some raw meat?
But y’all call that fashion
And Fantasia, she went the suicide route
Oh, you gon kill yourself? Before your album come out?
Lil Wayne came home like jail was a fad
They sold us big iPhones and they called ‘em iPads
And we all got barraged
By the many faces and many voices of Nicki Minaj
Old girl got it in
And before the year was over she was already beefing with Kim
Lindsay Lohan, behind bars
I guess I wasn’t supposed to notice that a dancer won Dancing With the Stars
The Census came tryna get the count right
And Paris Hilton, well she got caught with the white
And Petey Pablo need a reverend
Dawg, a gun? in an airport? on 9/11?
Obama still tryna do his thing
They caught T.I. with three pills and sent him back to the bing
Miley Cyrus had us at a loss for words
A lot of y’all got addicted to Angry Birds
The miners got freed live on TV
Y’all coulda gave ‘em something, maybe a Double Down from KFC
YouTube views, that could get ya some bread
Ask that lil white boy with the real big head
Usher came back, and still claiming king
He signed Justin Bieber though, can you say cha-ching?
Willow whipped her hair, and hit the perfect score
Rather see hers than anybody on Jersey Shore
Republicans, ha, they still tripping
A Wikileak? nah, where I’m from man, we call that snitching
Raz B and Chris Brown they had some words
I got three for Raz B – You got served!
I hear a lot of Rap Ups getting made for real
Ehhh, he’s all right, but he’s not Skillz
With that being said, I send a R.I.P
To Guru, Gary Coleman and Miss Teena Marie
Apache, Eyedea, and Lena Horne the star
Huddy Combs, Hideo, and Kool DJ Law
May they all rest in heaven
The Rap Up is wrapped up
I’ll catch y’all in 2011"

Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break

With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again, I said

How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to
The place where you said

And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright, alright
And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties, they pass the test
So slide up 'round the belly face down on the mattress one
And you hold me
And we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do, just a little now
Feel myself hovering off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is alright, alright
[Chorus]
And I want something else
To get me through this life, baby
I want something else
Not listening when you say
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

[Refrain]
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Outro]
The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips up into my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
In the place we used to start our lives

[Refrain]
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

Ice and Rain,Wale,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Chorus:
Ice melts into rain
Love turns into pain
Here I go again, falling in love

Verse 1:
She was so stuck, a fool in love with the wrong thing
And then along came the wrong man for her
The former, position of a pimp
He ain't have em on a track, he just had em like that
An uptown cat, Kennedy where he be at
She wasn't hip to the niggas were he be at
And she was from the burbs
And not the black burbs, I mean the white burbs
But that's why he liked her
Fascinated her, discriminated school boy
See, she would complained of the tested nature
Oh how she love the gangstas, they love them green ones
They love misleading them having there beliefs fucked
Since she wasn't really cribbing to his living
Soon as para finite will paralyze her existence
She was persistent on love though omit it
Waited on its arrival but baby but never get it
Chorus:
Ice melts into rain
Love turns into pain
Here I go again, searching for love
Ice melts into rain
Love turns into pain
Here I go again, falling in love

Verse 2:
Yeah months in every night she's in tears
She tried to call home mom dukes ain't care
She like, girl you wrong running away from home
So I guess you think you grown
So go on girl get on
She fiend for attentions
While his fiends for cream well exceeded the dream she once lived for
Oh its over whole time she knows this
Homie will never love her, although he'll probably have a fit
If his bitch insist on getting sick
And tired of his shit and tries to just split
So she just sit while settling for the lesser
A breakdown broad oh she could of done better
A cocaine measurer, part time lover
A full time sex slave, never find another
Couple months under him something in the oven
She says I got news, he denies that young'n
Chorus:
Ice melts into rain
Love turns into pain
Here I go again, searching for love
Ice melts into rain
Love turns into pain
Here I go again, falling in love again

Verse 3:
As she goes through the levels
She feels a baby is the way to save her relationship that ain't nothing
But it ain't change nothing, he getting worser
And she getting bigger so she feeling like she cursed
Time to get her bags get ghost
Hoping that mama would sympathize cause she broke
So she finally gets the courage to tell him on his arrival
Waiting holding her stomach but holmes would never find out
The door crack, niggas all black
Kicked down the door the looking for the cash
They took her by the throat, we front in here for dope
We don't with the jokes girl, where the fuck the notes at
We called your man he knew just what it is
We told him no dough then we go and get your bitch
The nerve of this prick, he said fuck it you can have her
We calling his bluff, so get your nose on this handgun
She just laughs as her life starts flashing back
And there's little to be glad for
I've been living in hell so death can never fade me
Bullets penetrate me, but they can never faze me
I can never face me again, cause I hate me
So tell him I been dead he killed me when he made me
He killed me when he made me, tell him I been dead POW!
Chorus:
Ice melts into rain
Love turns into pain
Here I go again, searching for love
Ice melts into rain
Love turns into pain
Here I go again, falling in love again"
Cant Do Nuttin For Ya Man,Public Enemy,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Runnin' for your life, by the knife
Runnin' from your wife, yikes!
You should've stuck with home
Off your mind to blow your dome
It was you that chose your doom
You built the maze you can't get through
I tried to help you all I can
Now I can't do nuttin' for you man

[Hook]
I can't do nuttin' for ya man
You got all these people on your back now

Flavor Flav got problems of his own
I can't do nuttin' for you man
Go lean on Shell's Answer Man
I can't do nuttin' for ya man
You jumped out of the jelly into a jam

[Verse 2]
Makin' love to wrong instead of right
Not a thief cat burglar through the night
Cop told your girl her name was Shirl
About a rooftop crime to steal her pearls
Uzi down the bullets in the gun
Just microwave themselves a ton
Lord, you tried to help them all they can
But they couldn't do nuttin' for ya man

I can't do nuttin' for ya man
They couldn't do nuttin' for you man

Public Enemy number one
Gotcha runnin' from the gun (Pow!)

Thats What It Is,Immortal Technique,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Green Lantern]
(Invasion)
Ok... let's go... talk to em'... holler
Don't you get tired of hearing niggas say that shit?... all the time?
Why can't you shut the fuck up and rhyme nigga?!

[Immortal Technique]
Yeah... yeah
Used to run around getting my fight in the streets on
Back in the day before Harlem had a green zone
What good is a good education with no direction?
Like the right to vote with no one to vote for in an election
Like a gun with no bullets in the clip for protection
Like a crowd packed in the front without the midsection
Used to live robbing and stealing and being reckless
It took time for my mind to put the ghetto in perspective
I used to live in the back of a holding van
Used to be offbeat like the white girls' shoulder dance
I wrote rhymes a acappella, no beat behind bars
Shed blood to make it, like the story behind scars
I used to be a battle champion in the meanwhile
Before some of you little fuckers learned to freestyle
Prematurely senile underground prima donnas
I was Oliver North during Iran Contra
Cause I never snitched, and that's backed by evidence
I learned it by watching you, don't ever forget it bitch
Cause everybody knows how the government do
They never snitch on themselves, but they want you to snitch on YOU
Evolution from Australopithecus
Primitive commercial shit to hard-core lyricist
Your wax is useless, rappers are dropping like Icarus
Technological revolution... nigga picture this
[Hook]
Motherfucka what?

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I told you what it was, but this is what it is now
Lyrical bullets, packed to the top of the clip now
Treat it like a robbery, I'm shutting this shit down
Fellas put your hands up and the all the women strip down
That's not misogynist you ostriches, cause I could just, apocalypse
Talk politics to the populace
Or challenge what the market is
With militant caucuses
That'll smash the spirit of Hip Hop out the sarcophagus
This is the curse of Tutankhamen, I bring the drama on
I'm sinful, I eat you, broad daylight on Ramadan
Hip Hop, reparations, now we taking back Delucci
Don't tell me you spent it on coke, like Danny Bonaduce
We're tired of being on the outside, looking in
Wondering what the fuck Hip Hop would've been
This is what it is, as opposed to what it used to be
And this is your corporate tax ID eulogy
Dominant species the new breed that won't let you breath
I'll make you die for what I believe
So we got nothing in common
There ain't no comparison
You got beef with niggas, I got beef with Aryans
White power Nazi European Americans
Rapid Poverty pimps, and fake vegetarians
The resurrection, ripping a ball through the record section
Flight connection to the Chechen border for guerrilla lessons
Fuck a middle man distributor, I got a choice now
This ain't Volume 1., I got a grown man's voice now
Toured the country four times over, I'm older and wiser
Poisonous words, you'll find strychnine in my saliva
[Hook]

(motherfucka what?... Bring it to 'em raw)

[Verse 3]

I told you what it was, but this is what it is now
50 caliber bullets, I don't need a clip now
Fuck your private jet nigga we shooting the shit down
Bomb wall street and make the stock market dip down
I told you what it was, but this is what it is now
You the shit nigga? I don't care about shit now
I play the role of Abraham, idols get ripped down
Melt the ice caps, and make all of this shit drown

(No one out there can fuck with me)
(motherfucka what?)
(I speak that real shit)
(to smash the airwaves)
(I don't want to tell you motherfuckers again)

Palmdale,Afroman,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Just like bums, we used to stay in the slums of LA by the way
Gang-bangers killin' each other for rep, sellin' rock cocaine on my doorstep
Had a ball to bounce plus a bike to ride, but my mama never would let me play outside
But when I got enrolled in elementary school, started bangin' like a fuckin' fool
So cool, throwin' up gang signs to the gangster beat, shot an enemy from across the street
Mama came home, said she got a good job. Daddy did too. Now they don't squab
Financially, we improvin'. 2 months later, son, we movin'
No more duckin' from shotgun shells. Bought a two-story house in East Palmdale
(give it to me now.)

Palmdale, come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
(Check it out, check it out, check it out.)

No more rats and no more roaches, livin' next door to football coaches
Now I got a new place to sell me crack. Now I got little white kids to jack
I stopped wearin' blue, wasn't trippin' on red. Too busy squabbin' with the skinheads
Stupid questions, distract the class. Rubbin' little white girls on the ass
I didn't really care if I passed or failed, I knew I was headed for the NFL
Until the playoff game, shoulder got hurt. I thought about my future, layin' in the dirt
I can't jump, I can't flinch. Superstar player, ridin' the bench
Graduate from school? Don't make me laugh. I got an F+ in basic math
(give it to me now.)
Palmdale, (Hell, yeah.) come back to me
I gotta do one song for my neighborhood. Bucccoooc!
Palmdale, come back to me
(check it out.)

I knew I couldn't make it in the white man's world, so I bought me some khakis and a Geri curl
I knew I couldn't make it to the NFL, so I went to East Palmdale and started slingin' yayo
For sure! I was makin' crazy dough. Should've dropped outta school a long time ago
Bought a cell phone, like a nut. Now I deliver like Pizza Hut
I drunk whisky and Bacardi. I sold dope to anybody
Me and my homies sold dubs and dimes, took turns bustin' rhymes just to pass the time
A white man drove up to my spot. He said, Hey, homeboy, what you got?
I put a fat rock inside his hand. About 25 sheriffs jumped out the van
(Get down, punk.)

Palmdale, (Hell, yeah) come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
(check it out, check it out, check it out.)

Can't get drunk. Can't get blunted. LA County, 95 hundred
Crips wanna take my All-stars. Bloods wanna eat my Snicker bars
Them peckerwoods don't want none, but the Mexican's straight own one
Them Ese's, catorces, treces always try to test me
So I jumped off the bed, cause I ain't no punk. Jammed his head up against the bunk
Socked that Cholo in his chin. Black mother-fuckers scared to jump in
Sheriff broke it up when we hit the floor. I kept talkin' shit cause I want some more
Back in town, we get along with the brown. Now I'm in jail, they tryin' to beat me down
Jail is hell, but I'll adapt. Won't hesitate to get in a scrap
Cause I'm down for mine, and that's for certain, sittin' in the hole with my knuckles hurtin'
(Palmdale)
Palmdale, (Hell, yeah.) come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
(check it out, homeboy.)

Now I got a fucked up life. Two bad kids and a naggin' wife
Dead end job at the airport. Check too short to pay the house note
Turn on the TV, then I see different homeboys that went to school with me
Playin' in the NFL. We used to kick back in East Palmdale
Rodney Williams. Lorenz Tate. Zeno plays for Colorado State
I wish my homeboys much success, but at the same time, I still get depressed
Walkin' through the wind with a cup full of gin thinkin' 'bout things that could've, would've, should've been
I wipe my tears, sip my beers, wish good luck to my peers
(Palmdale.)

Palmdale, come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
Cause that's where my heartache began, heartache began

Palmdale, come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
Cause that's where my heartache began, heartache began

Palmdale, come back to me
(Hey, all the homeboys on the football team, where y'all at?)
Palmdale, come back to me
(Hey, wherever you at in the world, I don't care if you in Japan, Africa
Hey, you know how we used to do it, man. Hey, hey, hey.)
Yo, let me get a Palm (Palm!)
Yo, let me get a Dale (Dale!)
Yo, what do we sell? (YELL!)
Yo, where we fittin' to go? (We fittin' to go back to jail!)
[X4]
Dale. Palmdale. (Hey, everybody just clap your hands.)
Dale. Palmdale. (C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. Buci-buci-bucccoooc!)
Dale. Palmdale
Dale. (Where them Falcons at?) Palmdale. (It ain't over 'til the fat man sings.)

Put you out your mind, homie, just rhyme, homie
Kick your little lies, I kick my real facts

Nasty shit, you thought I was boning Renette
You calling Carm' a hundred times, I was boning her neck

When does reality set in, or does it not matter?

Cut me up a lil' bit
This next-level shit

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Two-door Bugatti coupe, I call it ""Katy Perry""
Wiz Khalifa papers, smoking my favorite berries
S65, I call it ""Rihanna""
It got a red top, but it's white like Madonna
Made man—you hear what I said?
Having a slumber party, all my bitches counting bread
Made man, also known as ""Papi Chulo"" (Ugh)
And I’m running straight up in the culo
My wrist always on frío, call me ""Chilly Chill"" (Ugh)
Super head from Superhead, and I really will
Californication, motivation in my pocket
Got on my blue Dickie, shout out my nigga Roccett
Still smoking sticky, it ain't no other option—
Not for made niggas, and I’m never stopping
I raised the bar, I set the standards (Ugh)
My yayo Usher Raymond, that bitch just keep on dancing

Made man, I’m screaming, ""Dollar bills""
Pop the trunk on the Porsche (Ugh)—there they go, dollar bills

Spending tomorrows money, I call it ""Mañana""
Off the rack just ain't my style, I call it ""designer""
One of my baddest women ever, I call her ""Rihanna""
But that's 'cause her name is Rihanna
I’m in the condo just posted, watching Miami kill
I might just walk to the arena and watch it for real
Ashes to ashes, me, Rozay and Khaled
Smoking bullriders, shit moving slow as a ballad
Tattoo on your ass—it’d be nice if you show me
I’m buying bitches furs: Mike Tyson, Naomie
I’ve got the right to do it, it’s only right to do it
Love me some head, and I love a woman that likes to do it
Still love my team, ain't no other option—

I got some bad news: Jabar back in the feds
Facing twenty, he just did a dime
Been out a year, look like he finna ride
Genocide, these people killing time
Throw you in a hole, you must be penalized
Soon as you see success, haters reinvest
Miami guns drive, half a million, nothing less
Raised the bar, I set the standards

I got a hundred squares—if you scared, call the feds
Made man, I’m screaming, ""Dollar bills""
Pop the trunk on the Porsche—there they go, dollar bills (Ugh)

[Outro: Rick Ross & Drake]
Ugh, yeah
Ugh
Yeah, made nigga, got made niggas with me

Stand Up Nucca,Joe Budden,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Joe Budden]-talking
Uh-huh
I just want everybody to kinda be clear
Of what's takin place right now
It's not an introduction, it's more like a beginning
It's like the calm before the storm
I guess you can sorta call it, the rebirth
Or the birth period... it's the growth
For all my real niggas... real people in general
It's never one-dimensional, it goes out to everybody
If you can though... just kinda take some time out
Relate to it

[Rap]
For all my mans that died, with grams at they side
Plans just to ride, gun jammed when he tried
Ballers who never made it out the hood
Cats who owed, but never made it out the hood
If they offered you pleas and you went to court with it
My dawgs doin time cause you got caught with it
Or if you need cheddar, blast heat whenever
And run from the cops cause you know the streets better
Dope niggas who rich cause they know connects
Or dope niggas who spit but got no connects
If you pitch to pay rent, but get no business
Life in the state pen but get no visits
Fend for yourself cause you ain't got no boys
Ride or die, really you ain't got no choice
If your alibi's straight when you're wanted on the stand
Soldiers that take they football numbers like a man
Hustle O-Z cause your product rich there
Hood know you snitch but you gotta live there
You held your man shot, you don't know where it hit him
And you tryin to buy guns, you don't know where to get 'em
If you strapped in the streets with your palms all black
Young G's that gotta see they moms on crack
Pop can't be found, hand me down
When you the oldest out of five, hold the family down
If you caught a body and your wiz hid you out
If you slept in the park when moms kicked you out
Or if you gonna die, you gon' leave with a slug
Idolized your big bro, but he was a thug
If you squeeze your leather first cause it never hurt
Street cats that never work cause it never worked
Or if you got your shit snatched, gripped, clipped the mack
Too small for the kickback, but gotta get your shit back
Killed niggas playin, but you was only boxin
Accept twenty flat as your only option
Calm in the jungle in between the system
If you high on parole and gotta clean your system
If you told 'em to stop, cause soon you'll lose it
Pull up your pants leg, bullet wounds to prove it
Or if you grabbed the liquor, swallow it hard
If they drive-by on you but you follow the car
Full clip cause your foes is lurkin; or the D's at your door
With a picture, ""Do you know this person?""
If you dead broke, but forced into extortin
Cause your girl pregnant and she don't want a abortion
Got charged before, strap a gun anyway
Took the state's lawyer, but you won anyway
Stand up cats beat the odds by far
Real recognize real, R.R.R
Don't mistake a amped up nucca.. for what?
For a stand up nucca.. I won't
If you a stand up nucca.. then what?
Then stand up nucca.. R.. R.. R

Basically, that's about it
Hope you people get a better understanding
And roll with me... geah!
Let's get into it"
All For Me,XV,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Audio BLK & Omen]

[Intro: XV]
Vizzy
Emo, haha
You be the judge, haha
Uh

[Verse 1: XV]
Can someone tell me who this is all for?
And why I’m on the mirror’s edge, running on walls for?
20 biddies, one of Vizzy, this shit is uncalled for
But that girl with the ponytail should run with the dark horse
And I deserve it, all my life I worked hard for
Them other cats ain’t going in, that shit is soft porn
I overcame obstacles like parkour and if I get off course
It’s only ‘cause my banking is off shore
Now I ask for dutches, they give me double like jumping rope
Never been a virgin ‘cause I was always fucking dope
Doing something different, I’m getting top in convertibles
And I don’t spend a thing so why do I feel vertigo?
I be in the cut, tell them girls let’s get surgical
Fahrenheit 451, that paper we just burning through
Create money from me to cremate money, I earn it too
Do this look like work to you? Nah…
[Hook: XV and Erin Christine]
Looking at the lights like is all of this for me?
Everyone at night is here, all of this for me
Hands in the air, yeah all of this for me
Bottles over here, all of this for me
All of this for me, all of this for me
Life fast, lights flash, all of this for me
All of this for me, all of this for me
Models bringing bottles, yeah all of this for me

[Verse 2: CyHi The Prynce]
You for real? All of this for me?
Pussy, alcohol, and weed, all of this for free?
We ball hogging like we balling for the Heat
I did it first for passion, man this shit at least cost a G
Warner Brother T.I.G, turn this bitch to Dawson’s Creek
Papa John’s with the bread ‘cause we in here tossing cheese
Used to be broke as hell so I had to drop the streets
Till I got saved by them bells like I walk the hall with Screech
Come and get your bitch ‘cause your dog is off the leash
‘Cause we know how to party man, they call us Boston Tea
Plus I’m in an outfit that’s as sharp like Jaws’ teeth
Snuck my rosay out the club, what you think these bottles cheap?
With a model that call me baby more times than Monique
Niggas say I’m outta shape ‘cause my pockets is obese
I don’t care that’s your girl, all these broads in here are freaks
Don’t make me pull my arms out like I’m flexing my obliques
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Vado]
Hermes belt with a H buckle, beige bubble
Stopping at her waist as she waits for you, stray bubble
But her quiet storm like a tre muffle, age double
No forgetting money and straight hustle
Fake muscles get you a off day, denim shirt be from All Saints
Sleeves rolled, I’m in beast mode, don’t get your boys spanked
30 and your broads think they got money from all banks
Check clear okay, we leave and tell ‘em all thanks
Baking a tall cake, I'mma need a wall safe
Mansion got four gates, three pools and a small lake
Quick to get it on time, I never call late
Shorty crashed the car, she called me before Allstate
R-U-G-B-Y, Seagull when you see me fly
Helicopter’s Petey Pab, Aston Martin DB9
We balling, can’t you see?
Different cars at one time, I’m like is all of this for me?

[Hook]

[Outro: Erin Christine]
Now wait a minute, raise your glass
Let’s toast to the, toast to the past
Lights flash, let’s be honest, you did all of this for me
Yeah, this shit was all I knew, you and me only
You did this all for me, baby don’t you see? All of this for me"
Blood Sweat  Tears,Lowkey,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Klashnekoff]
As lightning strikes and thunder pounds
Over the grey skies of East London town
Prophecy K returns from the underground
Signified by the peoples crying, trumpet sounds
Yeah the system it tried to shut me down
But I been on my ting before Onyx was flinging guns around
Blood, sweat, and tears for years
It feels like my careers been in the dumping ground
Yeah, this is how hunger sounds
And I'm the hunter now, 'Lash the lion heart
A.K.A. the man behind the iron mask
For ten years straight, I've been raising the iron bar
Tryna breathe the life back into this dyin' art
So why try and par? When you'll meet the same fate as that lion Scar
This game is fake; full of two-faced lying ras
Who would sell their soul and arse just to climb the charts
Yea, but me, I put in too much time in the graft
Refinin' my craft for labels to sign me for a minor advance
Picture K'Lash, mimin' on Trance
Now picked a Dr. Dre beat, 'Lash rhymin' with Starks
It's all fate and I got mine in my grasp
They're all snakes, let 'em die in the past
But who knows what the future holds?
These N.W.O. soldiers will probably shoot me cold
All because the truth was told
You should know I did it from the heart
[Hook: Lowkey]
I’m still here, pushing after several years
I’m still here, standing strong, never in fear
I’ll be still here after the dust settles and clears
I’ll be still here after the blood, sweat and the tears

[Verse 2: Lowkey]
I don't do this for the happy ravers or the aggy haters
I do this for the warriors and the gladiators
Do this for those whose lives you never cared about
Can't pronounce their names, their origins or their whereabouts
Those brought up around tragedy and sadness
Who adjusted and found normality in the madness
Fight the power 'til I'm out of breath like Malcolm X
You empower the powerful, I empower the powerless
They'll play you on the radio if you rap about a Gucci belt
But rap about the government; you might as well shoot yourself
Industry fairies say I rap about conspiracy theories
Just to hide the fact that they lyrically fear me
Got that eye of a tiger, the heart of a lion
The mind of a lifer, my stance is defiant
I rise like a phoenix, immediate from the ashes
My existence is inconvenient for the masses
Though we are equal, I despise an imitation
I live for my people and die for liberation
I stand as a visionary; some have got plans of killin' me
To literally vanish me physically like Aborigines
Hannibal with the mask, an animal with the bars
I'm grappling with my shackles, I channel it through my art
Feel it in the ambience, champion, heavyweight
My life is nothing but my pride is somethin' that you can never take
They think I'm elusive or think I'm a nuisance
I swear these major labels must think that I'm stupid
Keep your 360's you're convincing these dudes with
Like I'll give you the blueprint for pimping my music
I say that like K’Lash, he’s another lion
Every hardship from getting scarred to my brother dying
Spit all of it with or without a big audience
Through the Blood, Sweat & Tears I stand victorious!"
Torture,Method Man,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
You know? Through being humbles
True Mast' on the track
Like that, you know?
Been in this rap game for like the past..
Four bullets now, you know? Doing bids, yeah-yeah
I done peeped a lot of cats come through
Courageous cats, stray cats, ha-ha
Top cats with top hats, you know what I'm saying?
But it all boils down to this, we talking lyrics
Rhymes, line for line, numero uno
Who the best? I don't know
Check it

[Verse 1]
Flame on, I rain fire when Johnny Storm
I'm shocking like live wire, you have been warned
I prolong this next chamber to make it strong
And prove all them doubters wrong
Killin 'Em Softly with this song, adding on
Let them toes get they tag on, dead men run no marathons
On my shift, shooting that gift, knowin' he snitched
On the telethon, running his lips, sinking the ship
Give back what his mother gave him, mother made him
And now she can't even save him, Johnny Blaze 'em
Send him to his final resting
Back to the essence, Faces of Death, the final lesson
[Chorus]
Torture, torture, torture
Motherfucking torture, y'all niggas know

[Verse 2]
Who got John Blaze shit? Sucking my dick to get famous
So I switched Blaze to Dangerous
Welcome to my torture chambers, torture chambers
Where John Doe's remain nameless, hear me?
I know it's Def Jam, but think clearly
I made it possible for y'all cats to come near me
Keep your enemies close and your heat closer
I slam just like my culture on all theories
Dead that, straight off the meat rack with this one
You get burned playing Nix-on, Hot biscuit
Stand back, don't make me spit one and paint pictures
On the walls of your mental with hot lead from out these pencils
Iron Lung since I was young and not knowing
Where the next meal was coming from, been troublesome
To all those posing a threat
If I go, everybody got to go next, y'all niggas know
The code of the street soldier, I'm watching time
And time watching me colder, Grim Reaper
Breathing death on my shoulder
Waiting for the day to take me over, take me over
[Chorus]
Torture, torture, torture
Motherfucking torture, y'all niggas know

[Verse 3]
That you can never touch my flow, go ahead and hate me
Still tryna fuck my ho, Johnny-come-latelies?
Got me in a world of shit and now I'm pissed
Mama said there'd be days like this
This the season for ducks and my pen's bleeding
Leaving kids barely breathing for sneak-thieving
Famished from lack of eating and lack of teaching
Banished from Rhyme & Reason for high treason
Can it be, that the kid with the knock knees
Got G to make a grown man cop plea, for this track
I got a Lovebug like Starski
Blow back until I drop Tical Part 3
Ain't no stopping when you start me, John Jay
Pulling your card, mayday mayday, niggas owe they life to God
And now it's payday, take it how ya wanna take it
Fully clothed or butt-naked, I learned the hard way
Ain't nothing sacred in this world, time to face it
Johnny Basic Instinct, I'm sure to make it
While others fake it, fuck the spotlight, G-O-D already got light
Say what you like, just spell my name right
No doubt, this one goes out, to all you trout-fish
Cake niggas, keep my dick up out your mouth

Torture, torture, torture
Motherfucking torture, y'all niggas know"

Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground

I sold my soul to the devil: that's a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a Happy Meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery
Get away from me loneliness
Get away from me fake bitches, I can’t take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
I’m an only child lost in the World
Where do the lonely kids go when the bell ring?
It's feeling like Hell rings
Bringing me back down
Checking my background
Its ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didn’t have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I’m spaced out Dogg, I be on that moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moonwalk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophomore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we ain’t finna change, so we’ll never agree again
Till then I’ll be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed

And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground

Adriana for Giselle
Let's exchange Angels
Photoshoot at my crib
Lets exchange angles
Rockin nothin but them Tom Binns bangles
My heart so anxious, gettin' anxiety
Begging one of these fuckin fashion houses to hire me
They say I’ve been an asshole
I said if you acquire me
I can be a quiet me, call it verbal dieting
Give me your herbal chai tea
I’ll be calm as Tai Chi
With a bad white bitch like Ice-T
I’m not right dog, I’m slightly off
I’m paranoid; like bonin’ raw dog
And wakin up with a slight cough
Yea, that’ll make ya dick quite soft
Plus my neck hurt too lemme take all this ice off
Never meant to hurt you, I should’ve took nights off
But it cost too much to live and I never took the price off

Yes, I’m the hardest here, break out the band for me
I’m 'bout to rock out like it’s ‘99
Labels wanna sign me, fine
Swag of Dre and Mighty Eye
Watch me redefine the grind
Simply went in search for the best production that I could find
Scribbled the sickest, most disgustin' lyrics I have designed
Teaching ‘em how to fear

And nah, we don't wear diamonds, we rock comets
My money came illegally, fuck it at least I'm honest
Finally 'bout to leave all the bullshit behind us
So right now death is the only thing I can promise
40's and the llamas
We hitting everything except the shorties in pajamas
Shooting in the Miami heat, like Chalmers
Slugs make you feel like you rocking leather bombers
Somebody call the coroners, I'm a hustler did numbers in the drought
You at your moms crib for the summer on the couch
A lot of niggas suck, nothing to figure out
They put themselves in the hole, want you to dig 'em out

Come Winter,Drake,"['hip hop', 'blues', 'jazz', 'r&b', 'pop']","[Part 1]

[Intro]
Yeah, this dedicated to Canada man
The whole up North
A lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the Winter
But listen

[Verse 1]
I met this new girl late June or early July
I called her a bunch of times but she barely replied
Now it's December, I'm driving, and she's like ""Where's my hi?""
It's weird that I never called you cause I rarely get shy
See that was a segue, I believe the matter
Is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter
Where the Timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up
Drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up
Where girls become exes from Summer's caught ho'in
The winter cars come out, the summer cars go in
And some places is breezy, and some it start snowin'
And if you planning family vacations you better know when
But some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city
Instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity
Cause mom stays up late, she seen them videos
Where Cancun college students pouring water on their titties!
[Interlude]
Yeah man
It's a funny thing going through the winter up here man
A lot of girls y'know, wanna get close
You might think they the one
But just wait, nah mean, take it slow

[Verse 2]
Forget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach
She lives just West of my street, and so we destined to meet
Since I'm driving, I ask her how to get to the suite
She doesn't answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat
She throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat
She's bold but I roll with it, I'm impressed cause she's sweet
Then she says ""I heard your song and I'm obsessed with the beat
I mean, the lyrics are good, but I'm obsessed with the beat
I love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good
There's a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat""
Off this I'm kinda taken back for a second
I get her number she tells me to call her after this session
And so I do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch
Until we end up sexin' and now my heart attached
I'm thinkin off I should've been more Southern
And realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho!

[Interlude]
Yeah, uh
I told ya'll I had a story for you right
Uh, ya man, it's what it is
[Verse 3]
And now, I'm proud to have her like Montreal to the frizzench
She love to play hurt like Carter did on the bizzench
But, my boy say I'm actin different, because I lay downtown
And I still I rush to pick her up from work and fizzench
She tellin everyone I'mma hold here down
Tell everyone I'm the prince up in this cold clear town
And stupid me I just listen to her
Instead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round
But then Spring shows up, and it's Dallas in this bitch
The weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed
When we were together, it seeming like way back when
Ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in
See she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa
Instead of saving for marriage, she saving for caribana
And it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime
I guess, I lost another one to the wintertime

[Outro: Eva Cassidy]
I miss you, most of all, my darling

[Part 2]

[Intro: Drake & Marlena Shaw]
Give me a second to gather my thoughts
Strolling in the park (Ho)
And watching winter turn to spring (Such a beautiful day man)
Yeah man, you know we had to switch it on 'em right?
Strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing
I'm still standing on two feet, even after this tragic loss
Man, but I got something to else to tell ya baby
[Verse: Drake]
I remember them encore PMs, breakfast and the wake up
Now Drake's committed we waiting on the breakup
So we can get back to them cognac nights
With dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right
And I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild
The winter came and blew his cold air through
Back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her
By the end of the week I would know that crew
And we'd assembled a trio, a whole new scene
With three ladies in the shot we never broke routine
At the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin'
We had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen
But this Summer is different it's a two man operation
Granted the fact that we one man short
Got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation
Cause handlin' crack is a one man sport
Instead of dress-up, I walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin'
I find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin'
The face, the breast, the bras, the toes
I'm still solo and a long night draws to a close
Cause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside
We'll never talk again, scary and true
That song Special I recorded with Voyce well it's like a classified
It's what I'm lookin for to carry me through
Yet I can't seem to find it, every girl that possesses it
Only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit
And when they talk about they past and lovers
And you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others
Yet you find peace with yourself, now least there's some room to ride
There's also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive

[Outro: Marlena Shaw]
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring

What if not the derivative will keep us warm?,Ben Lerner,[],"What, if not the derivative, will keep us warm? The tragic interchangeability of nouns?
The breastbone? Two vanguards sharing a bathroom?

When I first found the subjunctive, she was broke and butt-naked
Now she wants half. She wants her own set of keys
And bullets designed to expand on impact

A pamphlet of sparks? The National Book Award?

Meaning is a child of my third marriage. A marriage of convenience
A wartime marriage. We had plastic champagne flutes and no champagne
A staple instead of a ring. A dialectician in place of a priest

A butter substitute? Rogaine for women?

Consider the rain my resignation. I regret having founded Cubism
I regret the lines I broke by the eye
And the lines I broke by the breath

The hair around the vulva? Proust in translation? September 11th?"
I Remember Dedication to Whitey Ford/Everlast Diss,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Your mother.. you fuckin' faggot
Ayo, this next song is dedicated to the memory of Erik Shrody
Rest in peace, we ain't forget about you, you fuckin' homo, we still remember

[Verse 1]
There once was a man who liked to jump around
But he got too old to jump up and down
So he put the mic down and picked the guitar up
Started singin the blues like there was no tomorrow
Left his boys in the House of Pain
It was the wisest decision he ever made
But the dumbest thing he could ever do
Was try to buck a .380 on those that act shady
Tell me now what you gonna do

[Hook]
Cause I remember all those years, how it was when you were here
I remember how it was, how it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now
Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more
[Verse 2]
I remember back when you had the Knack
And I remember when you had your first heart attack
I was right there laughin when I heard the news
I just wish the cardiac woulda murdered you
Maybe Ice-T's right, you are a bitch
You come around when you're broke and you leave when you're rich
But the dumbest thing you could ever do
Was try to buck a 380 on those that act shady
Tell me now what you gonna do

[Hook]
Cause I remember all those years, how it was when you were here
I remember how it was, how it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now
Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more

[Verse 3]
Remember back in '94, like right before Ms. Everlast was Whitey Ford
Before his heart attack had him on life support
When House of Pain was outta fame like someone doused the flame
And they became destined to never jump around again
Or even further back, when I first had heard ""The Knack""
And you were down with Syndicate, I went to get your shit, man I was into it
But then you went and took your style and switched the shit
Now you sound ridiculous, you dickless piece of shit
How could you diss me, bitch?
I liked you, thought you was alright for a white dude
Remember Sway and Tech when I came up and sat beside you
Started rhymin, then you left the room and didn't say goodbye or nothin'?
Like you mad that someone else was white and tried to rhyme or somethin
I'm sorry man, I wasn't tryin to steal your light or nothin
But you're a homosexual, white rappin Irish (Muslim)
Man I wish I was Irish, I could be a *Muslim* too
Then I'd be confused as you, and I wouldn't know what to do
What's up with you? I never fucked with you, why would you fuck with me?
Knowin' I could rap circles around you, what, are you as nuts as me?
Plus I can sing better than you and I don't fuckin' sing
And probably play guitar better, and I ain't never touched a string
But I ain't mad at you, I'd hate me too if I was you
I'm what you used to be, shit you was me in '92
So everytime I write a lyric, I'mma think of you
And maybe that will help me know what it's like to sing the blues
[Hook]
Cause I remember all those years, how it was when you were here
I remember how it was, how it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now
Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more

[Outro]
You fuckin' punk pussy, you fuckin faggot, sissy fuck
And by the way, a .380's a fuckin' sissy gun
If you're gonna shoot somebody use a fuckin' real gun, you little bitch
Next time say my fuckin' name in a song, don't be subliminal about it
You wanna fuckin' diss me, diss me you fuckin' faggot
You fuckin' punk pussy, you fuckin' little bitch, fuckin' cunt"

Where the bar at?

Okay, okie dokey Obie's here
No more Focus Hobo's got a career
And I like your brassiere and there's a party in here
And I'm ready to talk naughty in Veronica's ear
She erotic and it's hot, saw Heineken beer
Put it to the side and invite her to ""Cheers""
Pull up a chair, nigga swear no drama
Prepare for a player who's working with a monster
I ain't got time to waste, let's vacate the place
Shut blinds and drapes, grind to your face in a grimy state
Concentrate, you will find that your bound to get
But we found what's fate
We can watch two incredible mates masturbate
Why settle and wait
Let's escalate to the nearest Super 8
And see your rear is on the mirrors and they smearin' booty cheeks
C'mon
[Chorus]
And this is my favorite song
Now sing along when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth
And this is my favorite song
Now sing along when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth

[Verse 2]
Okay holy moly derriere
Look around the club booty everywhere
She caught me starin
And my homies darin' me to approach Karen
She's model material, but she got a venereal
Tons of baby fathers', baby bottles and cereal
She holla cause I got a lot of dinerio
The DJ's playin Obie song on the stereo
And she's impaired and she wants to be headin' home
With the real thing not the dildo clone
And I know I don't wanna be headin home
With some double Ds full of silicon
Ten hoodrat chicks surround me outside
Found me outside, clown me outside
'Til I pop the trunk and they found me outside
Cussin at the bitches screamin ""off to they rides!""
[Chorus]
And this is my favorite song
Now sing along when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth (uh huhh)
And this is my favorite song
Now sing along when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth

[Verse 3]
Okay rolie polies everywhere
Gotta find a slim chick's atmosphere
Obesity's glarin' and she got me fearin'
She's gonna come over here and try to eat me literally, like a box of Cheerios
Cherry cupcakes and chocolate Tootsie rolls
I'm outta order cause I gotta big girl disorder
So better cover up that blubber or I'll split
(feet running away noise)
And I ain't got time to play
Let's investigate another place today
Ladies less in weight and the dress they shape
Dresses pettite, no window drapes

[Bridge]
Word to mother, they god damn Okra and beans
Got ya Oprah in jeans
Seems to me a little lean cuisine
Wouldn't hurt much, hot don't touch

And this is my favorite song
Now sing along when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth

Now sing along when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth

Is it, money or women to funny beginnings, tragic endings
I can make a million and STILL not get enough of spending
And since my life is based on sinning, I'm hell-bound
Rather be buried than be worried, living held down
My game plan to be trained
Military mind of a thug lord, sittin' in the cemetery cryin'
I've been lost since my adolescence, calling to Jesus
Balling as a youngster, Wondering if he sees us
Young black male, crack sales got me three strikes
Living in jail, this is hell, enemies die
Wonder when we all pass is anybody listening?
Got my, hands on my semi-shotty, everybody's listenin'
Please God can you understand me, bless my family
Guide us all, before we fall into insanity
I make it a point, to make my peep bumpin' warlike
Drop some shit, to have these stupid bitches jaws tight

Now since you're crying for mercy I promise
My success'll be the death of you
Lo and behold you sold your soul

Look in the mirror, ask yourself who are you?
If you don't know who you are, how could your dreams come true?
Motherfucker, I sat back and watched
You pretended to be 'Pac, you pretended to be hot
But you're not (now) - I see it so clear
You can't take the pressure, you pussy
I warned you not to push me
You see me and chills run up your spine
God made men the same boy, but your heart ain't like mine
Press, they look at me like I'm a menace
I was playing with guns
While your momma had your punk-ass playing tennis
I'm a nightmare, you see me when you dream
Wake up, turn on your TV and see my ass again
You cowardly-hearted, you couldn't make it on your own
Fuck The Source, I'm on cover of Rolling Stone

Rock to it, a freak freak to it, to the beat to it this is how we do it
Rock to it, a freak freak to it, to the beat to it's unique music
Rock to it, a freak freak to it, to the beat to it this is how we do it

[Verse 1]
Shad concocts plots and perfects clever scams
You can't find a Better Man in an Eddie Vedder jam
MC's can't see the flow, unbelievable
We set records even when the needles broke
Don't need the dough, asking more bang for your buck
The only landed Canuck that can't handle a puck
Played penalty killers skillfully pass and poke-check
When black flows jet there's more cash than OPEC
Or Exxon ex-cons exploit the oil fields
Of the inner city some day I hope the soils heal
I toil building a dream where my future can stay safe
A place where I never have to move it or vacate
Physically, I'm not in great shape cause I placate
And don't consume greens besides whatever grass my steak ate
The fakes keep fronting but I just don't care
Wearin' Forces is the only time I put on airs
I spit a hard-hittin' verse, when I'm spittin' it hurts
I never shift into first, yet alone put the whip in reverse
My free-styling's like a gift and a curse
So sick with the verse, they gotta think I’ve written it first
And plus my skills and sounds thrills the crowd
I can fill my mouth with Prozac pills and I'd still get down
[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
Now whether on stage or in the studio space
We schoolin' in cats to the game it's just the usual case
I'm like you wanna learn to flow homie move to the bass
And if you wanna make dough homie move to the States
I see suckers in style and musical taste
Plus, when we step on the stage and flash that beautiful face
It makes the honeys' hearts beat above a suitable pace
Showing the super stylistics very few could replace
I'm that ill rap scholar never sweat the finances
Just takin' out a bank loan as big as my campus
These MC's need to stop taking their chances
Why scrap when you know my arms stronger than Lance's
Touring France with these mad rappers locked in their stances
They thought they had a move until I blocked their advances
I'll be low-key chillin, rhymes filling the whole sheet
Feeling down loading on sizzlon so seek
Students slash rapper so I'm dealing with no sleep
I'm still a cold thief when I'm stealing the show peeps
Get out this young brother with daps
My tongue smothers the whack
The dub never uncovered the traps
So I'm tryin' to give light through these mic devices
Not that I'm perfect only Christ was viceless
But there's too many dealing with the lightning crisis
All I want's a warm home and a wife thats righteous
We gonna get there y'all we gonna rock to it
We gonna rock to it, we gonna rock to it
[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
Now like the Biz Mark I write rap tunes in the bathroom
My influence is a Black Moon and Pat Boone
I roll with a whole platoon of phat goons
Who keep the hair on their backs groomed with a Vidal Sassoon
Pick up the phone just to get the tone
My bicep claim I gotta leg ups, so when I walk the talk I high-step
As a fetus I kick rhymes upon their scans
Even back in '82 my ultra-sound was the jam
I just rock to it never get forced into nothin'
But words like a mullet-cutting short on the front end
Y'all life's more than cake, no offense to the ballers
But we all pay too much attention to dollars
Brainwashed now I'm still learning how to be me
Worth millions, I'd rather be free, uniquely
No, I may never know myself completely
If I make it home maybe then I'll peep me
Just a capital B-Boy like meat street and DC
Rock to it while I take it easy

[Refrain]"
The Town,Bobby Fischer (Rapper),"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Verse 1 [Bobby Fischer]

I ride passenger side while Rick whip the 400
Staring at these bitches, I can tell they all want it
Me and my crew come through all blunted
Trying to stack our money up tall as Paul Bunyan
I swing axes on your wick-wack shit
The fact is, I could drop classics for practice
Done with the hood rats, trying to bone an actress
Riding in a limo through Manhattan under black tint
I spit crack shit, I got that heat rock
On Insurgency beats or with a beat box
Still smoking even though I'm out the weed spot
Real high when I pull up, like knee socks
Look at me Pops, I'm really doing it
Survive or get ate alive, I'm not new at it
And I'm proving it, bitch I'm a monster
Standing on top of this world, I'm blowing ganja!

Chorus
(Yeah) We coming! (I swear) We coming!
Dead Mic, we coming! Insurgency, we coming!
L.E.J. we coming! Bristol, we coming!
And I'm becoming everything I ever wanted, uh!
(Yeah) We coming! (I swear) We coming!
(Yeah) We coming! Your girl, she cumming!
Dead Mic, we coming! Insurgency, we coming!
And I'm becoming everything I ever wanted, uh!

Verse 2

Motherfuck any cop who tries stopping me
Even if he find a pound, I will never cop a plea
I'm just trying to find a dime who is poppin' E
Like Reggie pop the 3, put her up on top of me
Come and rock with me, I rock Lacoste cologne
Try to talk on the phone, and you'll be walking home
My home town with me though I'm far from home
My whole town follow but I walk alone
And shouts out to Louie if he clinked in the box
He thorough and he know to never mingle with cops
I call my connect and then I bring him a knot
Fuck with me girl, I'm young, fly, single and hot
Plus I'm the King of the Cock, go and ask my ex
If I give you a piece, I'll put that ass to rest
If my beef is yours then you pass the test
It's expected like the Pats when they smash the Jets, WHAT?!
Chorus

(Yeah) We coming! (I swear) We coming!
Dead Mic, we coming! Insurgency, we coming!
L.E.J. we coming! Bristol, we coming!

(Yeah) We coming! Your girl, she cumming!
Dead Mic, we coming! Insurgency, we coming!

Verse 3

Who else sick of hearing dudes that don't bring it?
I'm laid up in the lab sipping on some Old English, ha
I write hooks good, but I don't sing 'em
And if your sisters listen to Fischer then don't bring 'em
Cause I'mma get it in, yeah I'mma get it in
My life is so crazy girl, where do I begin?
Someone like me will never come again
I'm lighting shit on fire every time I touch a pen
So they wanna fuck with him, but then I fuck her friend
She wishing it was her when she heard I stuck it in
I tried to tell her there's plenty of other men
But she ain't wanna listen, so then we fucked again
And no I don't pretend, cause this is how it is
It was once a dream, but now it's how I live
And I can still return and post up on the corner now, ha
What up Bristol!!! I do this for The Town!"

So rescue me

Everybody need to drive before we break out like hives
Gotta learn to put this shit we call
Pride to the side, I ain't no player
Without you I’m not OJ
Viva la vida now she wanna give me coldplay
Once you find you can’t keep it
You broke my heart into million tiny little pieces
And now its purge on you
Never put hurt on you, talkin’ to your girlfriends
Tryna find dirt on you
Damn, is this what we have come to?
When he was cheating I was the person you run to
Guess it’s for another time this is what I’ve come to find
Should’ve seen this coming but Stevie Wonder
Love is blind

Hey, and you ain’t leavin’, I'lll be right here

The way I always felt with you
Thinking that true telepathy

The right would become the wrong thing

This is the autobiography of Nicki Maraj

[Hook: Nicki Minaj (Shawn Wright)]
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected
(The more I cry, the more I try)
(Can you hear me? Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Daddy was a crack fiend, two in the morning
Had us running down the block like a track team
When you burnt the house down and my mother was in it
How could I forget it? The pain is infinite
She's my Queen and I ain't even British, she's the only reason
That I went to school and I finished (yeah)
She told me that I had talent, got on her knees
And prayed for me when I started being violent (okay)
She saw something in me that 'til this day
I don't know if I could be that (yeah)
But I'ma die tryin' and when I'm done cryin' grab the iron
And black out like I'm retiring (kyuh)
Nightmares of you killing my mother
The reason that I sleep with my head under the covers
And they should've thrown a book at you
'Cause I hate you so much that it burn when I look at you
[Hook: Nicki Minaj (Shawn Wright)]
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic (I'll keep trying)
My voice projected, my life reflected (keep, keeping on)
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected
(The more I cry, the more I try)

[Verse 2]
Damn, I wanna run to you, hold you and kiss you
And tell you how I miss you (I miss you baby)
Thought I would have a son for you but now it's official
It's over and I can't let you go (oh)
But I gotta let you know, all the shit I did made me feel like
I'm dying real slow
'Cause no one understands me
They don't know what to do when I'm hurt
And when I'm angry (kyuh)
You was my friend and my man and my daddy
You was there when that bitch tried to stab me
Anything I ever needed, knew you had me
'Cause of you, all them chicks couldn't stand me
So why I hurt you? That's the question
It took this long, for me to learn my lesson
'Cause now all I want is peace and get drama
Finally understand the true meaning of karma
[Hook: Nicki Minaj (Shawn Wright)]
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic (I'll keep trying)
My voice projected, my life reflected (keep, keeping on)
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic

(The more I cry, the more I try)

[Verse 3]
Please baby, forgive me, mommy was young
Mommy was too busy tryna have fun
Now, I don't pat myself on the back for sending you back
'Cause God knows I was better than that (kyuh)
To conceive you, then leave you, the concept alone seems evil
I'm trapped in my conscience
I adhered to the nonsense, listened to people who told me
I wasn't ready for you
But how the – would they know what I was ready to do?
And of course, it wasn't your fault (no)
It's like I feel you the air, I hear you saying
""Mommy don't cry, can't you see I'm right here?"" (yes)
I gotta let you know what you mean to me
When I'm sleeping, I see you in my dreams with me
Wish I could touch your little face, or just hold your little hand
If it's part of God's plan maybe we can meet again

Tire marks, tire marks
Finish line with the tire marks
When the relay starts I’m a runaway slave
Ugh, walking on water and running on waves
God MC, oh my God, you gotta see
There’s never no I's in me
Of an Odyssey, I’m a block away
Fire marshal's moving in
Marshmallows inside my pen
Sweet sixteens
Got a sweet sixteen and they deadlier than sin
I’m so appalled
With the prototype with a godly protocol
You an amateur, they wanna pro to call
I damage ya on camera, in Compton, in Canada
I don’t care where ya are
Just blink twice and I’m there where you are
Like a shadow in the dark, you a paddle in the boat
In an ocean full of sharks bout to come up short
Water in the pot, flow crack rock like Bam Bam nigga
Have two grams nigga pay up or blam blam nigga
Had a black Camry, bumpin' Dipset, Killa Cam nigga
I had been around niggas, killas, pimps
You ain’t been around shit but your momma and your bitch
Shoved off the porch when I was like six
Uncle Bobby got the house raided back in 9-6
Kick in the door
K9s all in the kitchen way before I even heard of Mike Vick
Momma in the bathroom poppa at work
Happened on Sunday we shoulda went to Church
Look at my shirt, Polo on it
It’s gon' sell if my logo on it
I fear no opponent
A demon come near and I might throw a spear at the omen
You looking at the 2010 Romans
Empire, Hiiipower HP, in ya face like HD
And I spit like a HK
I’ma shot like a H3, H-U-B-C-I-T-Y, A-B and Y-G
Problem and Hootie nigga
Tell the government come shoot me, nigga
Cause I’m going out with a fist raised
And a fist full of money give it to the fifth grade
Drink a fifth of Hennessy and then take another fade
With a democratic politician from CA
They don’t wanna see a B-L-A-C-K
Making some scratch like a hall of fame DJ
Give us some free J’s put us in PJs
Now we in the county jail calling for a three-way
God-Damn, y'all cold
Mark of the beast wear your god damn bar-code
Stuck in the street where it's dark like Harpo
Black man tell me where your God-Damn heart go
Although I’m in the land of milk and honey
Nobody never gave me shit, when I got my first chain
All the niggas tried to take it from me
I had to fight back and shit
Take it back and shit
And you rap niggas looking funny tryna talk back and shit
Like he back that shit
Acting like you real or something
Nigga ain't popped no steel, ain't popped no collar
Go pop some pills or something
You trying real hard to appeal to someone
I’m being myself, my BFF is a BM-dub
With your BM in it and your stash box glove
And the medicine a doctor gave a nigga won't help
I’m at the limit where I be amazing myself
I bet I finish on a level with a Black belt
I bet I hit it where every rapper get killed, like
Bla bla bla bla where the knife at?
Cut cut cut where your life at?
Your careers over, he’s slumped over
And if I'm off beat know I’m un-sober
That's a new flow
Pl-, Plus Q gave me some Kush and some Nuvo
New dough for the new year and I sumo on a rap peer
Not a rapper, I’m a raptor
That's a T-Rex in a V-neck for the rapture
I’m a factor and your facial
I will fracture to a fraction
No one-half and I hate math

Took me mighty long to get here

When you've got so much to say
It's called gratitude, and that's right

Good times gone, but you feed it

Addicted to the Game,JAY-Z,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
My first brick did it
I knew I was addicted when I flipped it to four
Then I whipped it to more
And it's like the streets call you:
""How could you leave me after all I done for you?
Who else would employ you? I made you feel royal
All it took was some oil, some water
Some baking soda to make you Hova""
My first taste of power, I'm numb off the feeling
I'm done off, niggas, I can't stop dealing

I'm addicted to the game
The shit keeps calling my name
I need to shoot

Ain't you afraid to go to jail? God
Well use your brain, are you sane?
But like Dale Earnhardt, the game is racing through my veins
And I crash every time, but like I never hit the wall
I need the K's like Pedro so I'm back pitching raw
And when the bases are loaded and cops try to squeeze play
The game ain't cold enough to ever freeze Jay
And I, need the green like fiends need yay'
And they, say it ain't right but it's the game of life
[Chorus]
I'm addicted to the game
The shit keeps calling my name
I need to shoot

[Verse 3]
I rap now, I eat good
I smoke good, drink good
Multi-millionaire but still I think hood
Belly full, I can't shake it
The hunger in my belly has been replaced with other forms of starvation
I guess it's just the need to be heard
I need niggas to say, ""I can't believe ya words""
I'm just an addict, addicted to music
Thoughts is sporadic, I gotta unconfuse it
Sort of like a Rubik's Cube is
Every album's a color, but I fuck up the other, color
Ha, I guess I'm more like
A bitch with a belly but her ass is right, haha
Y'all don't understand me still
I'll never enjoy my success but my family will
And I'm alright with that
So the rap Jerry Rice is back
To fulfill the need, though I lead the league
I pray everyday, I travel at God's Speed
Not a minute slower 'cause the minute you Hova
Everybody's praying for your spinach to slow up
It's sad but it's true, but niggas ass gon' turn blue
Holding your breath 'cause the force that's controlling my step
Won't let me lose it, 'til I'm undisputed
Until I'm one with the music
'Til I'm dead and gone, in search of the perfect song, mon mon
[Chorus]
I'm addicted to the game
The shit keeps calling my name
I need to shoot"

All you gotta do is just (live), live now, we spending
Not under the ground yet, we enjoying every second yo
Live now, don't forget to bro, yeah
Cause I promise you you'll regret it bro

[Nas]
Picture my last days will be so grim
My daughter at my bedside, respirator in me
Eyes dilated, looking skinny, trying to smile, trying to say something
Whole room will quiet down just to hear my last words
Tears fall down my facial, why fear anything, it's now too late to
I'm dreaming of a time I was silked out at the peak of my career
But I always choked out, leaving mad money on the table at crazy amounts
I would hit the scene for a second and bounce
Admit I did live a little bit, sweet pickle dick
Freaks licked on it, lips I dripped on it
Sex, I shot pearl necklaces on necks and tits
Traveled half the world, wish I traveled the rest of it
From QB to Mecca kid, so if you knew me
You'd be proud to say I left you with enough memories to resurrect me with
So live now nigga

It's been a long time since you came through to see ya sis
You know I love you, I've been a fan since Genesis
God, I respect you cause you never tried to smash
Since we met a while back, and your style was mack
Now I see that you a man after all you been through
A stand-up dude, held me down after Sekou
Need more brothers like you in the hood, would have wifed you if I could
But the white cells in my blood were no good
Said I had it ten years, but I was just a carrier
I thought, ""Me a victim?"", could never be my character
It's ill Se' passed the way he did, didn't know how to tell him
Just happy it didn't get in our kid
But all the things I did was the flyest, experiences were priceless
Remember days of diamond cuts
Nugget rings, clubs in Queens, Jetta cars
Used to love them things, Barbados, Belize
I stayed over seas, shopping sprees, credit cards
Pockets of Gs, left the hood, phattest cribs
To platinum from silver, came back, bitches calling me the black Liz Taylor
Imagine that, Rob me? My nigga would kill ya, they knew the rules
All the planes I flew, niggas I ran through
Lot of unprotected sex, don't know where it came from
Grimy niggas, rich niggas, damn it ain't a game son
From the Cayman Islands to the Virgin Islands
Gucci suitcases (coughs), a chic did it, eff the screw faces
Critics and fans, they need to get a life
You doin' the right thing, settle down, get a wife now
I grew with you so you know you make me proud
And most of all you gotta live now
[Hook: Scarlett]
Live now nigga ain't no promise of a second time around, put it down, would you
We'll just live now, there's no reason why you shouldn't, everything is up to you
All you gotta do is just, live now, keep spending
Not under the ground yet, keep enjoying every minute yo
Gotta live it up to the limit yo
Cause I promise you you'll regret it bro

Restless, standing tall like a soldier
We thick like the first Motorola brick cellular phones
Cut to the bone, celebrating ""Dre Day""
Love it or leave it alone
Just consider me the heir to the throne
The lifestyle of the savage and well known, protecting my own
Rolling stone, bringin' it home, time for transition
Don't talk too loud, you might find yourself missin'
Look into my eyes, all you see is will to survive by any means
Retreat to the Philippines
To meditate, liftin' train like a heavyweight
Hit you and run with a California license plate

Eatin' on pierogies, goose mixed with Sobe
Smokin' on a OZ, pimpin' like a O.G
If you never knew me, then you probably never know me
Blade on me homey mask on like Shinobi
Ball so hard, got a MVP trophy
Smoke so much kush, I forget the hoes that blow me
Thick white bitch, slurp a nigga like Kirby

And Goodyear niggas, sip malt liquor beer
They gave me sixth man of the year, came off the bench for Tha Liks
Shot the lights out at the championship
Big chips, big trips, new fits, my money clip
Full of green cheese, my other pocket got green weed
Rap niggas, we different individuals
Elevate the level of the music and the visuals
It's do or die, I need a Priest, call Soopafly
Whatever we discuss when we meets between you and I
I'm truly high, red-eyed for the red-eye flight
Five hours, eight drinks, I rode all night, shit
Everyday, every night's a saloon

It ain't hard to look hard, snatch up a catalogue
Mad dog to niggas that walk up your boulevard (Yeah)
But one day, you gon' feel it (What?)
I'm a firm believer in the theory if it bleeds, I can kill it
A hit man for hire (Yeah) caught up in the crossfire

(Whatchu want me to do?) To get spic and span
Man I'm glad you came and got me from that old white man (Good looking)
He took me to a spot in Long Beach, hooked me up with four pumps
But everybody in the hood can't jump
And I change colors when the sun hit me
Fix me up, now my owner wanna slang me for 50?
Bling bling, now I belong to a Japanese
And they was quick to throw me in the magazines
I make money (Huh?) I never broke down, fools tripping
(Check it out) How many cars you see in Seoul on streets dipping?
(None) Afraid to get that ass caught slipping (Why?)
For me it was an easy task
I kept an engine on my ass with heat under the dash, fool (Peep game)

I'm a hustler all they down to the bone
Terrorists everyday rhyme with that bomb
Stay on the day from night to the morn'
I ain't gonna server you nothing under a song
No fucking favors don't ask for no loan
Shop with your dogs then trynna get on
Call on my spot don’t be calling my phone
Nigga you ain't trynna shop, leave me alone
Grinding for days I haven't been home
Don't plan on going on til it's all gone
Mainly strong whatever you want
""Gotta get right"" Well fuck it what's wrong?
Shots of Patron whole lot of storm
800's on but you know what I'm on
Your bitch wanna fuck now she know that I'm on
On motherfucker I just want some dome
Play with me nigga, I got that tone
Need no help I can handle my own
I tear on your sqaud but I ain't from the Bronx
One in the back, still play with that drum
Just no that I don't play the radio home
No radio-play every song that I'm on
Case you ain't know I'm Rocko the Don
Zone folk Hamilton, low on fun
Gucci my hat, Gucci my drawers
Gucci on my ass-cheek cover my balls
Gucci my pant, Gucci my shirt
Gucci bookbag while I keep on that twerk
Gucci bandanna on top of my shirt
Gucci boots on, gotta travel in the dirt
She around me everywhere I go
G Code, G Code that's all I know

Bring Me Down,Kanye West,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Kanye West and Jon Brion]

[Chorus: Brandy]
I always knew that one day
They'd try to bring me down
Way down, way down
One day, they'd try to bring me down
Always knew that one day
They'd try to bring me down
Way down
They'd try to bring me down

[Verse: Kanye West]
We goin' to Mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say?
I have to say, since Pac passed away
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me
You see, if you ever wanted to ever be anything
There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
'Cause when I was barely livin', that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some leeway on the ""He say, she say""
Your girl don't like me, how long has she been gay?
Spanish girls say, ""Yo, no hablo inglés""
And everybody want to run to me for their sing-le
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg, if I was you, I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg, if I was you, I'd kill myself
Made a mil' myself and I'm still myself
And I'ma look in the mirror if I need some help
Now I'll speak from the heart, y'all all frontin'
Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel something
[Bridge: Brandy]
What you calling?
I let all in for getting what some get will get ya
What kind of dream we found?
See, I'm often catching crosswinds
Forgetting where the hell I met you
And try to bring me down

[Chorus: Brandy]
I always knew that one day
They'd try to bring me down
Way down, way down
One day, they'd tried to bring me down
Always knew that one day
They'd try to bring me down
Way down
They'd try to bring me down"
Somebody Gotta Do It Pimpin Aint Easy,Ice-T,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
My lifestyle's crazy, I'm luxury lazy
So much gold that jewelry don't faze me
Cordless phone, eight or nine homes
Girlies on my Jammie with an Ice-T jones
Bank account boomin', fast-lane zoomin'
Known around the world for my high post groomin'
Mac like a preacher, love like a teacher
Got a girl who lives in Paris
When I want her I beep her
Too many clothes, got a ragtop Rolls
1,000 Watt system and my speakers are Bose
I kick it like a champ, I thought you knew it
Pimpin' ain't easy but somebody gotta do it

[Verse 2]
My thumbs are tired just from countin' cash
No more room in my diamond stash
Filin' my nails is such a tirin' task
Gold knobs on my Benzo dash
Five freaks just to comb my hair
Monograms on my underwear
Bodyguards around so please don't dare
You're takin' a chance if you just stop and stare
Livin' my life is just so hard to do
Makin' deals a million one or two
Buyin' new cars for my entire crew
Matching Ferraris, E's black, mine's blue
Can't swim a lap in my pool because it's just too long
Could never go broke because my bank's too strong
No matter what I do I simply can't go wrong
And I'll make money I don't need from this damn song
But somebody's gotta do it

[Verse 3]
When I walk in a joint, punks always look at me hard
Because I wear enough gold to tie a dog in a yard
Cold maxin' in my mansion so big it's silly
Got a butler named Humphry and a maid named Milly
Mink sheets on my bed, that's what I said
Gourmet chefs in my kitchen so that I can get fed
So tired of sailin' on my boat I might
Just helicopter to my jet and catch a midnight flight
So many girls in my book, it weighs a ton
Gotta leave the damn country just to have some fun
Private suite at the track to watch the ponies run
And there ain't nothin' in the world
That me and ""E"" ain't done

But somedody gotta do it"
Sekou Story,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Nas]
Uh, I knew a few pharmacists, fuck frozen
They kept pneumonias on their arms and wrists
The main dude, Sekou, face look hard as shit
Remember like yesterday, they were the kings of ecstacy
Kept sellin' it, he blends in everywhere, has a mixed heritage
Bitches let him hit on the reg', waterbed seats in his car
All red Ferrari, Florida where we met at a redlight
Homeboy bumpin' my old shit
They wildin' with some freaks from the islands
Piled in behind him, limosine, Benz
He shouted, ""Nas, roll with us""
I'm bored so I followed him
Nikki Beach, here's where the scene begins
He put me on to Dawn, nice ass with a set of mean twins
Had a pocket full of cash, Sekou wasn't lettin' me spend
I was there for the weekend, packed and prepared for anything
Then he brings me to his castle in Coconut Grove
War stories about dudes both of us know
Never heard drunken words spoken so slow
A year go by, the nigga was fly
Prada shoes, a lotta jewelry, stayed high
Got a call, he's in N.Y
Needs a couple of G's 'til tomorrow, I dips by
For a season where he's at
Greets me with a smile, told him ""Here keep that""
Next week got a call from his wife
Said somebody done took son life
*beat changes*
She said
[Nas as Scarlett - repeat 2X]
""Who gon' hold me down now? Hold me down now
Tell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now?
Who gon' hold me down now? Who gon' hold me down?
Tell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now""

[Nas as Scarlett]
Forget about them other dudes, they talkin' to me rude
Cause I always knew the truth, they hated Sekou
H2 full of holes, the drove him off the road
Left him there on Biscayne, clothes stained with his brain
My soul shattered, my man's toe's tagged up
Arrangement's a closed casket
See now a ho has to, maintain with his fake gang
Sheddin' fake tears, I won't have it
Look, this kid's Jamaican -- half Hatian, half Asian
Brag about how the streets needed a changin'
Son, you the only one a bitch could call
You remind me of my dude, help me get them all

Nas: ""Di-sci-ple"" *scratched by DJ 3X*
Scarlett: ""You remind me of my dude, help me get them all""
Nas: ""Di-sci-ple"" *scratched by DJ 3X*

Let's lay down and let's get some sleep (Word)
Bobby.. come here baby
Lay down, let's get some sleep

[RZA]
One two, yo, 280 grains of gun powder stuffed inside the cartridge
Split ya wig, drive you off the Geothal's Bridge
Wild like a fiend of Herkimer
Scholastic type brain like Ivan van Sertima
I've got wolves that'll murder ya for a veggie burger
Spaghetti heads, meet the heavy burner
I put a oodle up in ya noodle
Then I head to the dread spot for a bag of that doodoo
Black photographic, I don't know no magic
But I know how to hold a 4 automatic
Add a nickel to it son if you have to add it
Better make sure ya kevlaar is steel padded
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, I've got beaucoup cess
Get pupu from best bitches plus I shoot through vests
Drive Fast Cars, crash bars at 5 AM
Stash jars of hash inside the backyard
[Hook]

[RZA]
I can't sleep like a child on Christmas Eve
Like a tender head girl in a shop gettin' a weave
Like a woman in labour about to produce the seed
Or Method Man with PlayStation and an ounce of weed
Some say it's hard to distinguish, my form of broken English
When spoke, the light I provide it cannot be extinguished
Or eclipsed by a 1000 moons, I stay in tune
And praise the Most High past the day of the doom
I squeeze black rubber grip 22 D's on the rims
Squeal out, leavin' black rubber skids, other kids
Couldn't match to the old Pistol Pete Rock, beat stop
The heat pops, you better get your mother kid
This is Bad News Bears, like Eddie Munster
I keep a dragon under my stairs
Plus a gun in my hat, ain't no runnin' from that
Ain't no runnin' with that pack
The Poison Apple, dunn, I crush Kings

(They say, they say)
They don't know

[Verse 1: Common]
They say a nigga lost his mind
But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme
The thin line between love and hatred
I'm the black pill in the Matrix, the saturated life
They say life is what you make it
So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it
As high as the stakes get when paper get low
I be tellin' Derick, ""Tell Cara get us a show""
Little Com, I make righteous bitches get low
The richest man ain't necessarily the nigga with dough
They say ""You ripped"" ""Wow..."" Yea, that's what they say
My niggas couldn't tell it was me, like Jamie in Ray
Paintin' a day, wit focused crime, broads, and good wine
They say ""Dope is sour so it's homework and hood crimes""
I stood mine, for forever and a day so goodbye
They never could say - tell 'em, J

Ah, the sweet taste of victory
Go head and breathe it in like antihistamine

Fuck you expect? I've got a history
Groupie love now, gotta be them wheels!
Haters back down, gotta be that steel!
I know they can't wait till ya outta ya deal!
Look how they did D'Angelo, ask him ""How do it feel?""
My best friends worry bout me
'Cause they know when you famous
And you had made cash
The media aims at us
And you be up so high
If you ever fall off, it feel like a plane crash
But God don't ever give me nothin' I can't handle
So please don't ever give me records I can't sample
So I could vacay where it ain't no channels
But it's quite okay for a gangsta to wear sandals
They say because of the fame and stardom
I'm somewhere in between the church and insane asylum
I guess it's messin' with my health then
And this verse so crazy when I finish
I'm just gon' check myself in, again

We say the facts and if, they lie (Uh, ha!)
We comin' back for them
They might say, but they don't know!

[Verse 3: Common]
They say ""Dude think he righteous""
I write just to free minds, from Stony to Rikers
Amongst the lifeless, in a world crazy as Mike is
On my paper, whether its weed or Isis
They say ""life is a game,"" so I play hard
Writin' for my life 'cause I'm scared of a day job
They say ""Sef kept the hood together""
I tell the young, ""We can't play the hood forever""
Play my cards right, they say I went too left
They showed me strange love, like I was Mr. F
Played chess in this game of, pawns and knights
Now I claim ""King"" like Don, or Frank White
They say my life is comparable to Christ
The way I sacrificed, and resurrected, twice
They say ""The crochet pants and the sweater was wack""
Seen the corner, now they say ""That nigga's back,"" uh

Hope y'all make it through the storm
You know what, though? I love the rain, man
Love the rain
A lot of you cats is runnin' your mouths (heheheh)
You're runnin' your mouths crazy
Think y'all got to ease up, though, you know?
Ease up 'fore somethin' happen, man
We don't want that, at least you don't
Be easy, man
Tell you how it feels to be on top of the world
But y'all niggas better take it slow

Dedicated to the ""Fuck Nas"" coalition
Touch my dough, I'm lettin' .40 cals blow, nigga
Not cows with four legs
But cals with more lead
That add up more dead
It's on nigga, I'ma bury 'em
Niggas don't want beef, they vegetarian
Scared of pussy, you climbed out a caesarean (woo!)
I push ya grown ass back in your mother's womb
You need 9 more months
Your crew's 9 more punks
You rhyme on stuff and claim I ain't sign y'all up
If I sign y'all, I'm on dust
Yeah we from the same hood, but nigga, what?
When y'all was tryna rap, y'all was makin' me proud, man
Now you fucked up, down on your luck, runnin' your mouth, man?
Why don't you be a real man? Say you need a lil' help
And I might help your ass off the shelf
But no, you're bein' disrespectful

I am De Niro after Am.Ex. commercials and The Fockers
With Martin Scorsese after Gangs of New York had rocked us
Back together with the master plan
The rebirth of Langston Hughes, I'm that man
I'm in the streets like old graffiti
I'm hearin' wankstas talkin' greasy
Whether broke or rich, my friend
Nasir bring that career to an end
And I'm bored with you MCs, B
Y'all beneath me
And my raps bring horror like a board of a Ouija
Of course I'm the king, get my shine on
Then I blind y'all 'cause they call me The Lord of the Rings (It's nothin')
Pinky heavy man, big stones in the wedding band
Smell the brimstone, back from Hell again
Next verse gets worse, from God's son to Devil sent

Joe too street for him
What's next? I guess it's for Nas to Ether him
Y'all awaiting a MC burial
This is ethereal, FM stereo to XM radio
What does it mean, ethereal? Hmm.. either heavenly or spiritual
Extreme, delicately light in a way that seems too perfect for this world
Man that is righteous, faithful and keeps law
Will surely live, declares the sovereign Lord
And you are none of the above
So you a sucka for death, if I'm a sucka for love
And y'all wanna know why I ain't gotta answer niggas?
'Cause I truly understand these niggas
Scared of me, so they talk about family members
Like I can't point out your grandma to niggas
Damn, you was my man like crew, dog
Don't make me change your body frame to blue fog
The Q is the borough of true Dons
Any disrespect, nigga, we choose arms

I get the drop, if you can duck ya luckier than Lady Luck
Look, nigga, don't think you safe 'cause you moved out the hood

My heart bleeds for you, nigga, I can't wait to get to you
Behind that twinkle in ya eyes, I can see the bitch in you
Nigga, you know the streets talk
So there'll be no white flags and no peace talks
I got my back against the wind
I'm down to ride till the sun burn out
If I die today I'm happy how my life turned out
See the shootouts, I done been in 'em by myself
Locked up I was in a box by myself
I done made myself a millionaire by myself
Now shit changed, motherfucker, I can hire some help
I done heard about the 50 grand you put in the hood
But ya shooter finna get shot, it won't do him no good
With a pistol I define the definition of pain
If you survive ya bones'll still fucking hurt when it rains
Oh, you a pro at playing Battleship? Well, this ain't the same

See the losers end up in shackles and motherfucking chains

And now you standing there, holding out our promise ring
You’re crying but you feeling not a thing
‘Cause it dawned on you like a new day that your man’s not a king
He a parasite and your life’s really got up in
And all you got is him but he got everybody
You a working woman and he a busy body
You had big dreams but he had a little hobby
And you had the feeling you could change him, it was silly probably
And now here we are, dinner table flipped
Cell phone open, text message six, on the floor like the Tell-Tale Heart
She ask do I wanna be this? I’m like oh hell start
‘Cause I’m at the point of giving in so we can begin again
Fresher than the prince in them Bel-Air parks
But I can tell by the look that I get from her eyes
I took everything she had and now she empty inside
I try to reverse roles, if it was me in her place
I’d be putting someone in hearse mode and I don’t feel like a stranger
She looking at me like I raped her, all of the sudden
The memory of what I used to be drifting through the air like a vapor
And it breaks her, she don’t got nowhere to go
We don’t even know the neighbors so I tell her…
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Laws]
Now I was never one to fight but we would argue
How I would never be the type of guy that her mother likes
What do I do? Go and prove her mother right?
I’m too embarrassed, I don’t even want the rights
Show up at her door with flowers like poor me
What I do? And then I’m blocked at the doorway
I could see her in the kitchen with her head down
Wishing she could put it all behind her and call me
We was too close and it’s been too long
And the memory of what we had is too strong
She had some genuine feelings but they was used wrong
And now the only decent thing to do is move on, as she watched me
It took her every ounce of willpower not to stop me
And accept my apology, all of a sudden, heard some footsteps from behind me
Think she wanted to hold me but she only told me…

[Hook]

Run away, run away, run away
Run away, run away, run away
Run away, run away, run away
Run away, run away, run away"
Family Affair,Wale,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Yeah this shit got me feelin' Robert Beck
Rather than Robin Thicke
Ho's, got a list, but I gotta pick
I'm gettin' bitches to strip
Leave all they clothes on, baby this ain't so hard
See, I'm a nigga with no flaw
No wrinkles in my game, this is Botox
And spoke of
I make them ho's strip
But keep on your clothes
Leave your inhibitions here
I breed 'em like I'm going to war
I tell them killers they ain't figure what they fightin' for
This is your Vietnam
Via my strength
So your arms can't reach me
Believe me I'mma be your God
See, involvin' yourself is to be a part
And when you fuckin' for the night, you don't need a heart
You now on the premises
Where rules get followed
My pretty works stalk ya
Once guarded like the jail assistant
But now invisible cells around your brain
It's much different
It's much stricter
Believe me
And even when you crabby, obey all seasons
Whatever issues you have
Now speak them
Anything you need
Now you gotta come to me for it
Squeeze you tight
Forever you my bottom bitch
And not a fear as long as you know who your father is
[Hook]
Cause you love me, call me Daddy
Why me
Because you need me
Why me
You need to breathe me
Why me
Cause I'm your family, you too weak to leave me
Cause you love me
Why me

[Verse 2]
I'm more Karrine Steffans
Than Corinne Rae
I see the honesty, he told me that he needs me
You see he loves me cause he beats me
Because he kiss every wound that he leaves me
From the womb, my newborn child
Although the route's foul, we need Similac powder
Hold on
Simmer down now
It's momma's new job that provides temporary housing
And I'm sorry that I brung
You to the world
See your father's in the clouds
And daddy's in the Cadillac
I better get my gown
I'm running out of time
Thirty x's on that calendar
You see I gotta go to war
You too young and you don't know what I'm fightin' for
This is my Vietnam
You are my strength
And the reason that I'm going
See, with you, I never see it wrong
So I'mma leave you with the sitter
And every time I spread 'em
I'm dreaming 'bout
Us with millions
See me with a husband
No government assistance
Turn my back on the game and I ain't never gonna miss it
I kiss you on the forehead, baby just listen
Times I ain't with ya
No I am still with ya
Forever I am with ya
And never should you tear
And never should you fear
Not when momma's right here (me)
[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
You got me feelin' orphan Annie
More or less
Than the muse of a family
Shit, is it money that my momma want?
Or is it somethin' deeper, and this is momma front?
I know my daddy gone
It's such a lonely world
Is this the reason for you leavin'
Do you feel a void
Do he make you feel important than how you felt before
Do he kiss you on the forehead and keep you warm
Shit, if I was old enough to speak
I'd tell you that no money can be a mother to me
And you ain't gotta go to war
Especially if you don't know what you fightin' for
You stuck in Vietnam
You see him as a God
And I don't know who told you, but I don't see a mom
I see a young teen
I don't see a problem
We're livin' wrong before your God see a proverb
Your little cub
One day a bed
One parent above, the other live scared
She need love
That's why I can't have it
She can't be my mother
She's always with daddy (me)

I Will Not Apologize,The Roots,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: Dice Raw & Talib Kweli]

I will not apologize, I will not apologize
I will not apologize, I will not apologize
This for all of my peoples who understand and truly recognize
Some won't get it and for that, I won't apologize

[Verse 1: Greg Porn]
I'm so sick cause I'm infected but, but I don't need a medic
Need a liquid anesthetic, let me show you how I get it
I don't got it but I bet it, I don't worry, I don't sweat it
You can bitch, you can dead it, you can take it there like FedEx
Nothing sweet, diabetic, big dog, can't pet it
Pack an L then I wet it, then I fill it 'til it's pregnant
(Take the high back) Face it, everybody got a favorite
I embrace it like I date it but my grandma think I chase it
(Like oh yeah) I told her that her baby moving slower
Cause the world is on his shoulders then I woke up out that coma
(And got right back) At it with a little black 'matic
Lay you down, Craftmatic, then I'm gone, black magic
(To the hideout) You don't wanna gamble with the devil
Especially when them chewy blueys got me on another level
Cause my teacher think I'm slow but my momma think I'm special
But even she know I'm coming back like an echo

[Verse 2: Dice Raw]
For the statements I'm about to make, I will not apologize
Niggas talk a lot of shit, really need to stop the lies
Jewels rented, cars rented, homie that ain't authentic
Acting tough on TV, but to me you seem a little timid
Don't blame the nigga, blame America, it's all business
Acting like a monkey is the only way to sell tickets
Shit, I can dig it, niggas gossip silly digits
White kids buy it, it's a riot when we talking about pimping
Or sipping on Olde English brew or whatever they think we do
Spraying double Uzis cause you know they think we live in zoos
The problem is with this, everyone seems to be real confused
The niggas on the streets to the old people that watch the news
And watch BET, and the crazy shit they see
They associate with you and do the same shit to me
When you look at me, you see just a nigga from the projects
But can't understand this nigga's mindset, but still

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Yo, a revolution's what it's smelling like, it ain't gon' be televised
Governments is hellified, taking cake and selling pies
I ain't got a crust or crumb, to get some I'd be well obliged
Murder is commodified, felon for the second time
Never was I into chasing trouble I was followed by
Facing trouble with no alibi, had to swallow pride
Vilified, victimized, penalized, criticized
Ran into some people that's surprised I was still alive
Look into my daughter's eyes, wonder how can I provide
Got to get from A to B but how can I afford to drive?
Messed around, tried to get a job and wasn't qualified
Had to see a pal of mine, got to get the lightning rod
Now I'm in a black Impala looking for the dollar sign
Palms get to itching, man I gotta get the calamine
'Fore I fall behind, guess the grind will be my 9 to 5
I will not be conquered by, I will not apologize

Certified cylinders, thirty-five mil'
Jumpin' out planes, Doc's the name
Cock the flame, back to relieve the pain

That I got that thing with me and anxious to let it go
I'm tryna mind my business though, 'til I hear this nigga say yo
""They ain't nobody, fuck 'em!"", I'm thinkin' I'm finna bust 'em
Wait, look up and see these police’s lookin' at me
I tell C, he tell Doug, they tell Jay-Z
When you see him, surround him, then call to squirrel me (Whoa)
Pick a perfect spot and make sure that they girl see
My man offered dude a drink, he said: ""What? What you think?""
Then coughed; from then on, you couldn't see nothin' but bottles
Remy Martin to the noggin, better bust it wide open
And his bitch standin' here hollerin' while he lyin' on the floor, shit
Why you feelin' sorry for him? He asked for it
Listen, y'all, here come the moral of the story (Listen, hey!)

You swear these niggas is dangerous, the gangsta shit they be sayin' (What?)
Lock 'em up in the booth with a half a ounce of that cannabis
Sit back, and watch the outlandish shit they portrayin'
But soon as you see 'em, they freeze up like in museums
Them statues, you like: ""Is that the dude
That said he was gonna …"" (Pmmm!)
Niggas get runnin' before you finish your sentence
And then they back to riffin', when they off at the safe distance
You like, you was just here, you disappear like magicians
In thin air, I'm like damn, nigga, at least keep it consistent (Nigga!)
I hear you baitin' me lately
I been doin' my best just to stay hater-free
Still watch what you say to me
Sooner or later, I take you up on your offer

Find out you is at the awards or was the code in the streets

See, all that whisperin' is lame, I ain't one for the game
If I say fuck you, then it's fuck you, nigga, simple and plain
I say no problem, it's no problem, pimpin', you do the same
Now you just swallow your pride 'cause you know I'm off the chain
Try to refrain from being violent but you come out your face

Yo, explode, my thoughts were drunken from quarts of beers
Was years back, before Nasir would explore a career in rap
As a music dude, I mastered this Rubik's Cube
Godzilla, fought Gargantua, eyes glued to the tube
Was a long time ago, John Boy Ice
Geronimo po-lice jumpin' out Chryslers, e-z wider paper
Pops puffin' his cess, punchin' his chest like a gorilla
Outside was psychos, killers
Saw Divine, Goon, and Chongo, Lil' Turkey
R.I.P. Tyrone, 'member no cursin' front of Ms. Vercey
Big Percy, Crazy Paul, the Sledge Sisters
My building was 40-16, once in the blue, hallways was clean
I knew all that I'd seen had meant somethin'
Learned early to fear none, little Nas was huntin'
Livin' carefree laughin', got jokes on the daily
Y'all actin' like some old folks, y'all don't hear me
Yo, I'm in my second childhood

Yo, dude is 31, livin' in his mom's crib
Ex-convict, was paroled there after his long bid
Cornrows in his hair, still slingin', got a crew
They break his mom's furniture, watchin' Comicview
Got babies by different ladies, high, smokin' L's
In the same spot he stood since '85, well
When his stash slow, he be crazy
Say he by his moms, hit her on her payday
Junior high school dropout, teachers never cared
They was paid just to show up and leave, no one succeeds
So he moves with his peers, different blocks, different years
Sittin' on different benches like it's musical chairs
All his peoples moved on in life, he's on the corners at night
With young dudes, it's them he wanna be like
It's sad but it's fun to him, right? He never grew up
31 and can't give his youth up, he's in his second childhood

Baby girl, she's always talkin', name droppin', hangin' late
Drinkin', smokin', hates her baby daddy, craves shoppin'
E poppin', ecstasy takin', won't finish her education
Best friend she keeps changin', stuck with limitations
Lustin' men, many hotels, Fendi, Chanel
With nothin' in her bank account frontin' she do well
Her kid suffers, he don't get that love he deserve
He the Sun, she the Earth, single mom, even worse
No job, never stay workin', mad purty
Shorty, they call her the brain surgeon
Time flyin', she the same person
Never matures, all her friends married, doin' well
She's in the streets yakkety yakkin' like she was twelve
Honey is twenty-seven, argues fights
Selfish in her own right for life
Guess she's in her second childhood

Is it fair to say that I am stressing out
I'm stationed in Iraq and they won't let me out
My homies said I was stupid for even joining
My counselor said that my decision was disappointing
How she had good slate for good state colleges
And with my good grades it wouldn't have been a problem
But they don't understand just the power of significance
More than brilliance and certainly more than dividends
And if you ask me now would I repeat it
Would I fight in a war I don't believe in
Well the answer is it's not me where the cancer is
They been doing this before Jesus of Nazereth
And after all this time it is still deadly hazardous
And Bush isn't really being all that inaccurate
When he says we're winning the war cos its staggering
But thats cos we're killing everybody that we see
And most of us soldiers we can barely fall asleep
And time and time again I'm feeling incompetent
Cos my woman back home, we're constantly arguing
And I must be crazy cos all I'm obsessing with is
Her myspace and facebook and who's commenting
I swear to god if she's cheatin' I'm doin her ass in
I can tell with one look
And it came to me sounding something like a song hook

Heaven, is there a chance that you could come down
And open doors to hurting people like me
People like me, People like me
People like me, People like me

[Verse 2]
Meet Sarah, the proud mother of young Sebastian
Suburban professional went to college in Ashton
In self pity she suddenly cried
Would my life be important if I suddenly died?
Neighbors saying what a nice women she was
Keeping mostly to herself ever since the divorce
And with the company downsizing and the fall and all
She really shouldn't take it that personal at all
It wasn't her boss who had his eyes on her thighs
And got a rise from her rising off the desk though
And despite remembering saying no plenty of times
It was still a damn surprise being let go
And now stuck with a mortgage she can't afford
And too educated to blame the corporate world
She got on welfare and hated it case work a power trippin
And generally being degraded if
Nothing else she was treated sick
And ineffective which is the worst thing
That she'd been left with
Damn, no magic from David Blaine
No painter to paint this pain
No Morgan Freeman to narrate the shame
So she took refuge in prayer
Kinda like finding god in the phone book
And it came to her sounding something like a song hook
[Hook]
Heaven, is there a chance that you could come down
And open doors to hurting people like me
People like me, People like me
People like me, People like me

[Verse 3]
I guess I told you about myself to a degree
Just by telling you about people like me
But people like me they speak politely
They don't start no beef for a piece of white meat
Everybody gotta eat but everybody doesn't
Which is why I want to tell you about my favorite cousin
He and I grew up where the sun shines
And we both partook in the gun crimes
And we both liked American rap rhymes
Even though we didn't understand one line
If you remember my liner notes in my last album
I talked about a close call with a grenade
I think we both must have been about 7th grade
But don't panic we both survived without damage
But we developed a bond like we survived the titanic
So when the country became frantic
My mother tried to get us out, planned it
To the last detail except the plan got derailed
Cos there wasn't enough money for the plane tickets
How bitter when my mother had to choose who to take with her
So my cousin got left in the war and that's just hard to recall
But now I take refuge in prayer
Kinda like finding god in the phone book
It came to me sounding kinda like something from a song hook
[Hook]
Heaven, is there a chance that you could come down
And open doors to hurting people like me
People like me, People like me
People like me, People like me
Heaven, is there a chance that you could come down
And open doors to hurting people like me
People like me, People like me
People like me, People like me"
Krazy,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: 2Pac]
Throw me a cigarette, dawg!
They got me feelin' crazier than a motherfucker
I got Bad Azz in this motherfucker
Makaveli the Don, representin' the Outlawz
Bad Azz representin' the LBC Crew
So whatcha wanna do? Y'know how we do it

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Puffin' on loud
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
Oh yeah, I feel crazy
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
Oh yeah, I feel crazy
(Tell 'em about it!)

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Last year was a hard one, but life goes on
Bumpin' my head against the wall, learnin' right from wrong
They say my ghetto instrumental detrimental to kids
As if they can't see the misery in which they live
Blame me for the outcome, ban my records – check it
Don't have to bump this, but please respect it
I took a minus and now the hard times are behind us
Turned into a plus, now they stuck livin' blinded
Hennessy got me feelin' bad, time to stop drinkin'
Rollin' in my drop-top Jag, what's that cops thinkin'?
Sittin' in my car, watch the stars and smoke
I came a long way, but still I got so far to go
Dear Mama, don't worry, I'ma watch for snakes
Tell Setchu that I love her, but it's hard today
I got the letter that she sent me, and I cried for weeks
This what came out when I tried to speak – all I heard was…
[Chorus: 2Pac]
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
I feel crazy
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
I feel crazy
(One, two, three, four)

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I see Bloods and Crips runnin' up the hill
Lookin' for a better wayyy
My brothers and sisters, it's time to bail
‘Cause even thug niggas prayyy
Hopin' God hear me, I entered the game
Look how much I changed
I'm no longer innocent – casualties of fame
Made a lot of money, seen a lot of places
And I swear I seen a peaceful smile on my mama's face
When I gave her the keys to her own house, this yo land
Your only son done became a man
Watchin' time fly, I love my people, do or die
But I wonder why we scared to let each other fly
June 1-6, '7-1, the day
Mama pushed me out her womb, told me, ""Nigga, get paid!""
No one can understand me – the black sheep
Outcasted from my family, now packin' heat
I run the streets, a young runaway, live for today
When he died, I could hear him say… (Thug Life, baby!)
[Chorus: 2Pac]
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
I feel crazy
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy
I feel crazy (crazy)

[Verse 3: Bad Azz]
God, help me out here, ‘cause I'm possessed
I need the root of all evil for my stress
‘Cause money's like a strong prescription
Drug, it's got me addicted
To the pleasure and the pain it inflicted
Somethin' about the paper
With the pictures of the president's head
Damn, it's like a motherfuckin' plague that spread
It's epidemic; forgotten, forgotten it got worse
I keep my head on straight, makin' money ‘cause it's cursed
Makin' money makes a difference day by day
So I gotta stay paid, no doubt, day in and day out
This life is like a vicious cycle called fightin' to live
No matter how hard you try, it's in death, you gotta die
A lot of my peers didn't make it to the years to come
Did life do 'em right or did life leave 'em dumb?
Who has the answers? I wonder, I turn to my elders
They aged and experienced, but they can't even tell ya
Or tell me, that there'll be light at the end of the road
(Why?) ‘Cause they don't even know
A million things run through my mind
You ain't gotta be in jail to be doin' time
(You ain't gotta be in jail to be doin' time)
[Chorus: 2Pac]
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
I feel crazy
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy

You can call me daddy, uh
I'll be ya daddy, that's right, uh
Just like daddy
Fo' the ladies
Hahaha

[Chorus: 2Pac & Singer]
Come with me and in time we'll grow
Dedicate slow jams on the radio-oh why
Know ya happy, I can feel ya passion
Lookin' out for ya just like daddy, come on
Sunshine turns to rain
Baby, I can take away ya pain
If ya trust me
Close ya eyes, feel the magic
Never leave when ya need me
I'll do ya just like daddy
[Verse 1: E.D.I. Mean]
I met her when she was younger
Real daddy died when she was younger
Her moms let her do what she please, an' seen no one loved her
Her eyes shined of love, a diamond in the rough
The kind that you could love; not yet touch, but so much, potential
Youngster let me guide ya mental
And to a place, with a sourness of pain you'll never taste
By God's grace, you was born with that face
Nothin' but pure beauty; so for an eternity, I feel it's my duty
To be a souljah (souljah) yeah, baby got plans to mold ya
In the coldest nights is when I hold ya
Like I'm supposed to, as we roll closer
I'll take yo' hand gladly, anything you need, ask me
Supportin' my baby girl just like daddy

[Verse 2: Makaveli]
To alleviate the stress, spendin' time wit' you, I feel blessed
When you gone, feel the pain so strong deep in my chest
When I got arrested, came so close to goin' to jail
Throwin' blows at the po-pos breakin' ya nails
Screamin' loud goin' all out, damn I did
You stayed locked down at moms house, watchin' the kids
Through the whole bid in the V-I, I see ya daily
While my fake homies try to fuck you, you run and tell me
That's why I stay committed, I thank God every time I hit it
Hopin' you'll forgive me for all the times I bullshitted
Me and you against the world, we untouchable
Screamin' like you dyin' every time I'm fuckin' you
Ya never had a father or a family, but I'll be there
No need to fear so much insanity, and through the years
I know ya gave me your heart, plus
When I'm dirt broke and fucked up, ya still love me
[Chorus: 2Pac & Singer]
Come with me and in time we'll grow
Dedicate slow jams on the radio-oh why
Know ya happy, I can feel ya passion
Lookin' out for ya just like daddy, come on

Baby, I can take away ya pain
If ya trust me
Close ya eyes, feel the magic
Neva leave when ya need me
I'll do ya just like daddy

[Verse 3: Yaki Kadafi]
Boo, would ya die for me?
Down holdin' my pistol, gettin' high
With mean sounds tougher than bristles
But when you cry I'll be ya tissue
Back in the county written letters, how I miss you
Givin' you credit, apologetic how I diss you
Kiss you for thinkin' like a mona and on a level
And sometime daddy ready to wine ya and dilation
For a total twine ya, we right behind ya true
Life just me and you, no tellin' what we could do
Gettin' high between the sheets, make the shit right here discrete
Puttin' hickeys on ya belly while we fuckin' on the beach
I love it when ya nut up and grab me
I feel for ya badly, baby girl just like daddy
[Verse 4: Young Noble]
Shorty I lend my hand out ta help ya, lost soul lookin' for shelter
On late night accept it, treat ya good, won't disrespect ya
My age is young, out of place bitch days is done
From a trixy to a missy, you know I raised ya hun
Placed her under my wing, showed her how we swing
Now she rolling blunts for her king
One day labelled thug misses, the essence of my ghetto sisters
Hugs and kisses, that's just for me to be a father figure

Nothin' but love for you, my sister
Might even know how hard it is, no doubt
Bein' a woman, a black woman at that, no doubt
Shit, in this white man's world
Sometimes we overlook the fact
That we be ridin' hard on our sisters
We don't be knowin' the pain we be causin'
In this white man's world
In this white man's world
I ain't sayin I'm innocent in all this
I'm just sayin', in this white man's world
This song is for y'all
For all those times that I messed up, or we messed up

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Dear sister, got me twisted up in prison, I miss ya
Cryin', lookin' at my niece's and my nephew picture
They say don't let this cruel world get ya
Kinda suspicious, swearin' one day you might leave me
For somebody that's richer
Twist the cap off the bottle, I take a sip and see tomorrow
Gotta make it if I have to beg or borrow
Readin' love letters; late night, locked down and quiet
If brothers don't receive they mail, best believe we riot
Eatin' Jack-Mack, starin' at the walls of silence
Inside this cage where they capture all my rage and violence
In time I learned a few lessons, never fall for riches
Apologies to my true sisters, far from bitches
Help me raise my Black nation, reparations are due
It's true, caught up in this world I took advantage of you
So tell the babies how I love them, precious boys and girls
Born black in this white man's world—and all I heard was

Who knows what tomorrow brings
In this world where everyone's blind?
And where to go, no matter how far, I'll find
To let you know that you're not alone

Only thing they ever did wrong (yes!, yes!) was bein' born black (no doubt), in this white man’s world. All my ghetto motherfuckers, be proud to be black if you proud to have this shit like this, 'cause ain't nobody got it like this (all my little black seeds, born black in the white man's world). All these motherfuckers wanna be like us. They all wanna be like us, to be the have-nots: all hail. God bless the child that can hold his own, no motherfuckin' doubt.

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Bein' born with less, I must confess, only adds on to the stress
Two gunshots to my homie's head, died in his vest
Shot him to death and left him bleedin' for his family to see
I pass his casket, gently askin', is there a heaven for G's?
My homeboy's doin' life, his baby mama be stressin'
Sheddin' tears when her son finally ask that questions
Where my daddy at? Mama, why we live so poor?
Why you cryin'? Heard you late night through my bedroom door
Now, do you love me, mama? Why they keep on callin' me nigga?
Get my weight up with my hate and pay 'em back when I'm bigger
And still thuggin' in this jail cell, missin' my block
Hearin' brothers screamin' all night, wishin' they'd stop
Proud to be black, but why we act like we don't love ourselves?
Don't look around, busta, (you sucka!) check yourselves
Know what it means to be black, whether a man or girl
We still strugglin' in this white man's world

Who knows what tomorrow brings
(Born black in this white man's world)
In this world where everyone's blind?

So, tell me why you changed to choose a new direction
In the blink of an eye?
My time away just made perfection
Did you think I'd die?
Not gon' cry, why should I care?
Like we holdin' onto lost love that's no longer there
Can you please help me?
God bless me, please keep my seeds healthy
Makin' all my enemies bleed while my G's wealthy
Hopin' they bury me with ammunitions, weed and shells
Just in case they trip in Heaven—ain't no G's in Hell
Sister, sorry for the pain that I caused your heart
I know I'll change if you help me, but don't fall apart
Rest in peace to Latasha, Lil' Yummy, and Kato
Too much for this cold world to take, ended up bein' fatal
Every woman in America, especially black
Bear with me, can't you see that we under attack?
I never meant to cause drama to my sister and mama
Hope we make it to better times, in this white man's world

I seen them come
I seen them gone
Seen the weak defeat the strong
Seen the ones that finished quick
To the ones that lasted long
I’ll pass the bottle and the bong for those
Who understand this song
Forgive me when I’m wrong
And don’t forget me when I’m gone

But if it’s on then it’s on from dusk till red dawn

And while you rats get fat I’ll be aiming for swine

It's your knife in my back

So fuck it you get the smack

Or the pity it lacks

Spraypaint  Ink Pens,Fort Minor,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Refrain: Lupe Fiasco & Mike Shinoda]
Uh, spray paint and ink pens
I use to write in every color I think in
To paint a picture with every rhyme that I speak in
Yeah, the gallery is the beat then I... I... I... I
Yeah, ladies and gentlemen, we have a special guest for you this evening
Ghost, you ready?

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, I verbally paint pictures, I'm the hood's best storyteller
This about a young boy dealin' with the older fellas
Promised him the lives he seen on TV
He ran packs across town like rhyme CDs
And big chains, new clothes, Nikes and Reeboks
Stackin' too much loot to squeeze in a shoe box
Saving, he promised his Mom a crib in Atlanta
And his pops got killed through debt, he was a dealer
So he staged jazz, fox jump off the suit cases
No more cross-town, now he's crossin' them states and
Seeing new faces, not knowing who to trust
So when the door kicked open they screamed, ""This is a bust""
""Is it a set up?"" it seemed funny, a scuffle broke out
He got hit, dropped the cases spittin' blood out of his mouth
He walked four blocks to die, trying to survive
And now all that's left is his mom screamin', ""God why?""
[Refrain: Lupe Fiasco & Mike Shinoda]
Uh, spray paint and ink pens
I use to write in every color I think in
To paint a picture with every rhyme that I speak in
Yeah, the gallery is the beat then I... I... I... I
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Let me begin by sayin'...
Shut the fuck up!
Let my begin by sayin' I don't think this man knew what he had in store
He opened the door and found the bag under the floor
Not a peep while he's workin' the lock
Get the flame, aim, pop open the box and take off
Out the back of the pawn shop
Scoping the lot, hoping the cops hadn't seen the plates on his car
He felt like he been hustling so hard
Like a demon he pumped a cold heart
Play it cool like Humphrey Bogart
Put the rings on his chain attached by both parts
He did the drop, one ring in a bag
Envelope, all the money he had
Left the money and the ring in a slow exhale
Two weeks went by, got a box in the mail
In the box was a bullet made of gold
Melted down from the ring, recast with two rings and a band
And he stared at it, sitting in the palm of his hand
And sat down next to a picture that sat on the nightstand
It was his wife in the picture on his side
With the ring on the finger on the week that she died
As he looked in the reflection at those eyes so red
He put the bullet in a gun and put it right in his head
Like that
[Refrain: Lupe Fiasco & Mike Shinoda]
Uh, spray paint and ink pens
I use to write in every color I think in
To paint a picture with every rhyme that I speak in
Yeah, the gallery is the beat then I... I... I... I
Yeah
Yeh
Fiasco!

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
He knew that he didn't have enough power in his thrusters
To muster warp 5
Plus if he pushed it the fuel cells could rupture
Then they would die
Then the galaxy would suffer but he knew he had to try
But he couldn't risk it
Put the cure in the escape pod and kissed it
And told her goodbye
She started to cry
But he knew if he could distract 'em, he could buy her some time
And she could make it out alive
Turn the suit around and got prepared for the stand off
Space mine had blew one of the hands off
Damaged laser cannons and he got the system jammed
And he faced the whole fleet, blood seeping through his teeth
The final saga in the Seven Planet Wars
Unsheethed the sword and then he charged forward
His eyes flashed behind the cracked cockpit glass
He let out a laugh and then all she heard was a blast like...
[Refrain + Outro: Lupe Fiasco & Mike Shinoda]

How they propose to deal with my perfect present?
When I unwrap The Gift & The Curse in one session
Ain't no livin' person can test him
Only two restin' in heaven can be mentioned in the same breath as him
Seven straight Summers, critics might not admit it
But nobody in rap did it, quite like I did it
If you did it I done it before, you get it I had it
Got mad at it and don't want it no more
And that goes for everything from flippin' that raw
Flippin' whores, flippin' vocal chords, don't get it twisted
Get it right, did different, did it better, did it nice
Did the impossible then did it twice (get it right)

Yup! Hovi's home, the global phone
The world is back in order, the number one rap recorder is back
You cats over-felt yourself
You couldn't help yourself, now witness the real for real
In my absence cats get, absent-minded
Now it's time to rewind and remind 'em
Why I'm in the position that I am
Changin' the game, my game could nail Madonna
Well after I'm gone, they'll honor
History in the makin', Pistol Pete
Leave competition shakin' without missin' the beat (woo!)
Chasin' the hi-hat all over the track
The snare is scared of the air in here, BOOM!
And plus I get paper dog, don't let me forget
The watch face so blue like it's holdin' it's breath
Can't see me skill for skill or check for check
It's the bow-tie flow dog, I bring it to your neck
Live and direct, I will bring it to your set
I got now, I don't care who got next
Rapper slash Exec., Kordell Stewart
Your flow all y'all using is mine, you're all useless
You ain't a factor, who are you foolin'?
You all are faggots, you takin' us backwards (takin' it backwards)

Who was gassin' 'em? (Fuck outta here!)

They lowlife pigs who get it how they live
They daddies in them court houses giving out bids
Chopping niggas on blocks and leaving wickedness
Man they embroidered the land, then they smallpoxed the witnesses
Raping babies using ladies as they mistresses
Causing chaos and disorder
That's why the Glock on hold, the block on swole

Woe to the hypocrites and infidels screaming niggas can't handle
The wrath of the son of man black pandemonium

I crush any MC who feel they must
Try me, the smallest flea on the dog won't get by me

Hit a nigga up, leave him right there in his mess
This penicillin I'm spilling leave hair on your chest you feel me
You can't beat me, kill me
I'll be back in three days disguised as a gardener with my kicks filthy
Told you I was nice like Christ the rap angels throw down ice
I shine like jewelry in light
I can make a true believer out a curious dyke
She'll be wearing hijab singing 'hamdulillah!'
I'll be slinging dice humming songs on the ave
They'll be saying ""Man, he going off the path""
But that's on the low though
Beating cats with no glow, tryna play me like a ho
But this ain't rooks and pawns or tic tac toe

For crooked cops patrollin if the red dog rollin all the dope
I'm throwin, fuck a jail, I ain't goin tonight
Quick to pull a fo'-fo' in a fight
Under the street lights rollin the dice
We were so enticed, by niggas like slick money and ice
We figure prison it just come with the life, along with losin your life
And there was no way we thought
We'd go to jail for e'ry case we caught
For all the yay we bought, not a dime did we say we borrowed
Bought damn near every pair of J's at the mall
Had our way with the broads, hit the rink but we ain't skatin at all
Seem like every other day we'd brawl, that A.K. on call

I remember every day was a party
15, 16, was dreams of bein cocaine bosses
In pursuit of that we made so many terrible choices
Like the time we made away with that millenium
From the dealership before our day, wasn't we killin them?
Late nights, gun fights, high speed chases
So close to the good life, we taste it

We started small time, dope game hustlin that cocaine
Interstate traffickin, high feelin no pain
Numb to the fact that we was poisonin our own kind
I ain't give a fuck, he gettin his so I want mine
Young'n with that attitude, somebody finna give me that
I ain't give a fuck, how I got it, it was real as that
So if I had to peel a cap, somebody was dead then
Since I'm a killer that's the condition my head's in
Can't work too hard to get my money, I refuse to
Slave for the next man who raised nigga, fuck you!
These streets are 9-to-5, you want it we can get it for ya
And even though they steady changin this is still a hustle
Still got them same rules, may not be the same game
We done found some brand new money, still we maintain
The same integrity we upheld in the street light
Livin a motherfuckin dream nigga singin like

Ohhh! Oh-ohhh!
I remember walkin (walkin)
Didn't have a dollar in my pocket (in my pocket)
Now I'm watchin stocks like what's the options (options)

Yeah, it’s Young Khalifa Man
Taylor Gang over everything
Champagne, paper planes, bitch taking off her wedding ring
Leave with us you’ll never be the same
Making money in major ways

[Hook – Wiz Khalifa]
If I got it then I'mma spend it if I want to
And pick you up anything you want too
And nah, I ain’t gotta say nothing about it, it's right in front of you
I do all of that shit them niggas don’t do
Pop another bottle, Imm’a roll this weed up, I’m so G’d up

[Verse 1 – Wiz Khalifa]
Big-face digits, whips ain’t rented
Walk inside the bank bitch I’m Ben Frank friendly
Big cake piled up on my plate shit endless
Throw it in her face watch the bitch make wishes
Walk inside the club, bottles of that liquor
Groupies actin’ up, dying to get a picture
Rose and Patron, Kush be my cologne
Shorty get to keep her weed them joints already rolled
All my diamonds clean, all I count is cheese
Walking on a dream while you tryin’ to intervene
On top of that money, them haters in-between
Smoking sour seem you can smell it on her weave
Smell it when I leave, niggas catching feelings
OG Kush prescription keep me way over the buildin’
Riding in my ride, banging in my system
High as Whitney tryin’ to find a way to get a million
[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, know I’m smoking sour you can smell it down the hall
Learned this as a youngin’, what you sell could get you far
Captain of my team, tell you how to ball
Ain’t a game I put that on my marijuana jar
Breakfast on the plane, smell like alcohol
Diamonds in my chain, muscle in my car
Live a movie scene, hundred-dollar jeans
Pocket full’a Benji’s give them 20′s to my broad
Always on my job, been about my business
Killing all these rappers off now can I get a witness?
Lying to the judge, flying to the club
Chopper play the barber came to line a nigga up
Heavy in the game, still ain’t had enough
We takin’ all your bitches and buying all the drugs
Couple thousand for the Louis lining in my tub
G’d up from my feet up
Roof to the rug

He want a wife, he just lookin' for the right type""
Yea right, I be ridin' through the city lights
My hat bent, gettin' high behind the 'lac tint
I'm chilllin' with Brazilian women, heavy accents
They black friends translatin', got'em all ass naked, adjacent
Have relations wit'em many places
Leavin' semen in they pretty faces
Make'em kiss they partners with it in they faces
Young pimpin' sprung women 'cross the 50 states
Got young ladies requestin' ""What's Yo Name"" on 50 stations
Askin' me what's a pussy popper, want a demonstration
But I ain't waitin' til the second date, I'm so impatient
Relieve'em of they aggravation, take'em rollerskatin'
On them Dayton's, tell'em ""Baby, stick with me, you goin' places""
Go replace 'em, dro erase 'em out my memory
Moist panties and wet sheets when they think of me

And the nasty ones like when I talk to'em dirty
But I'm breakin' the ice, got'em laughin' and flirtin'
They be, removin' they skirts when they hop in the 'burban
Once the flick start playin' and the E start kickin' in
Her girlfriend lickin' and she beggin' me to stick it in
That's why, I like chillin' with women who like women
Lightskinned... Asians, Jamaicans and white women
Indians, Italians, Haitians and Puerto Ricans
They be itchin' for they chance and waitin' in me to freak'em

Now so while for while we talkin', I'm fillin' yo cup
We killin' the bottle, wake up in dirty linen tomorrow
But tell me would it trouble you if we ended up at the W-
Sippin' on a malibu pine apple juice and a blunt or two

We gon' really get to know one another
All you gotta do is put your hair down, get your mind right
Knahmean? I'm here for you, yo

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Relax yourself, let your conscience be free
You now rollin' with them thugs from the R-O-C
Ain't no place on the planet that you'd rather be
But in the blue flame, bitch you're new to the game
Cross over to the Roc, make yourself hot
The topic of discussion in every nail shop
It's a secret society, all we ask is trust
And within a week, watch your arm freeze up
Brassiere get right, A to a D cup
Weave get tight, pedicure your feet up
Ears get iced, gear get spiced
From hoodrat to superstar, there's your life
Fuck with Hova, he can take you out of your hell
Say bye to Reebok, say hi to Chanel
Say hi to Gucci, Prada as well
Take a look in the mirror, be proud of yourself
[Chorus: Rell & Jay-Z]
Get your mind right mami, get your mind right
You gotta play your part when you're rollin' with the R-O-C
Get your mind right mami, get your mind right

Get your mind right mami, get your mind right
I need a gangsta girl, who can ride in my passenger seat
Get your mind right mami, get your mind right
And I need gangsta girls, for my gangsta family

Yo, I'm young Memphis, used to play the apprentice
Now I'm like the teacher, c'mere, let me teach ya
How to play them benches, hold this work in your dentures
How to play it cool when police come to pinch us
Relax mami, let the Belvy flow
Inhale the 'dro, exhale it slow
I could teach you how to roll, teach you 'bout fly kicks
Teach you how to keep your nose up out of my shit
When the beeper goes off, please don't reach
Like you put a ring or spend cheese on Bleek
Get your mind right baby, goin' through mine crazy
When I'm in the shower, *69 me crazy
Track my last call, contact my broad
With a bitch or two, had physical contact in the mall
You got issues {*inhales*} problems you need to iron out
I will, holla, for now you on time out

P-I-M-P-ology
I play you and you pay me
Believe me when I tell you girl I know you a freak
For fuckin' with me, that ain't all you can be
Just put your mind to it you can go real far
I know times gettin' hard on the boulevard
They say, pimpin' is dead (What?), man, pimpin' ain't dead
These hoes just scared and they blind tryin' and dyin' to be led (Mm)
But who's to lead 'em? Talk shit to 'em and beat 'em
Get they mind right and feed 'em
Now I don't need 'em (Uh-uh), but I can do that there
Put on a three-piece suit and Shirley Temple my hair
So I can, feel like a player when I walk in the place (Place)
Got yo' bitch all on my line, and now she up in my face
Is this yo' bitch? Is that yo' bitch? 'Cause if she's not, she mine
She falling for a nigga and I ain't even dropped a line

We use the word everyday
Now we don't know the capacity of this word
Are we headed for conflict or not? (Yes sir)
Because we did not break down the capacity
Of the same what (the same word)
Brothers and sisters, this is why we hung up the consciousness
We've been taught wrong

[Verse 1]
Find a room to lock yourself in and close the door
It's some heavy concepts that we gotta explore
We gotta, strip the word down rugged and raw
The rhetoric of Martin King just ain't around no more
Du Bois ain't here, James Baldwin neither, they all were leaders
But they ain't help me get this Porsche two seater
A lawyer left the hood, he never looked back
To be a Fortune 500 CEO, it took rap
So what if my pants sag with my hat turned back?
The same swag got our merchandise flying off the rack
Marketing companies is hiring blacks
Fresh hip-hop lingo for your campaign ads
Controversy surrounds who could say it and when
Some niggas are full time, some play and pretend
So fuck that, no apologies on the issue
If it offends you, it's meant to, it's that simple
[Chorus]
Tryna erase me from y'all memory
Too late, I'm engraved in history (I'm here my niggas!)
Speak my name and breathe life in me
Make sure y'all never forget me ('cause y'all give me life!)
'Cause y'all use my name so reckless
Whether to be accepted or disrespected (and I love it!)
And I love it, especially when y'all do it in public
And I'm the subject, 'cause y'all my niggas

[Verse 2]
Yo, I was thinking a little bit
What would it take to authenticate my nigganess?
Ball ridiculous? 26 inches when I call up the dealership?
Aww, that's some nigga shit
We only out for our own benefit?
We having too many kids? We Claudines? Welfare recipients?
The infamous free clinics is the sickest shit
Make me think what the hell they clean they syringes with
Everybody bleeding, the cops are the demons
Courtrooms full of goons, jail buses leaning
Handcuffs squeezed too tight on youth life
If you fight, they just give in, people used to do sit ins
They got Nigeria and Niger, two different countries
Somehow Niger turned to nigga, and shit got ugly
The problem is we started thinking like the colonists
'Til Noble Drew Ali started dropping that consciousness
[Chorus]
Tryna erase me from y'all memory
Too late, I'm engraved in history (I'm here my niggas!)
Speak my name and breathe life in me
Make sure y'all never forget me ('cause y'all give me life!)
'Cause y'all use my name so reckless
Whether to be accepted or disrespected (and I love it!)
And I love it, especially when y'all do it in public
And I'm the subject, 'cause y'all my niggas

[Verse 3]
My father was not a banker, neither was my neighbor
When it came to getting paper, who the hell was gon' train us?
Oppression couldn't escape us through the ages
We changed the basis of derogatory phrases
And I say it's quite amazing
The use of ghetto terms developed our own language
No matter where it came from
It's celebrated, now people are mad if they ain't one

[Interlude: sample]
Every word we use, it has a capacity
And if you don't understand the words you're using
And understand the capacity of it
You are using words that is creating a destiny for you
That you don't even know, or even conscious of

Tryna erase me from y'all memory

'Cause y'all use my name so reckless
Whether to be accepted or disrespected (and I love it!)
And I love it, especially when y'all do it in public
And I'm the subject

Tryna erase me from y'all memory
Too late, I'm engraved in history
Speak my name and breathe life in me
Make sure y'all never forget me
'Cause y'all use my name so reckless
Whether to be accepted or disrespected
And I love it, especially when y'all do it in public
And I'm the subject, 'cause y'all my niggas"

[Verse 1]
I spit it for my block—it’s an ode, I admit it
Here, the city code is ""lock and load,"" any minute is rock-and-roll
And you rock and roll and feel your soul leaving
It’s just the wrong dance that'll leave you not breathing
I’m not particularly proud of this predicament, but
I’m born and bred in this tenement; I'm sentimental—what!
Plus, it’s only right to represent my hood and whatnot
So I’m about to do it in the music; in the movies—Cut!
To the chase, pan across to the face, I'm right there
Freeze frame on the street name—oops, wait a minute
This is where the streets have no name and the drain of sewage
You can see it in this boy how the hate is brewing
'Cause when his tummy tucks in, fuck, the pain is fluid
So what difference does it make entertaining through it?
Some get high, mixing coke and gunpowder, sniffing
She got a gun but could have been a model or physician
[Hook: K'naan]
So what you know about the pirates terrorize the ocean?
To never know a singe day without a big commotion?
It can’t be healthy just to live with such a steep emotion
And when I try and sleep, I see coffins closing
So what you know about the pirates terrorize the ocean?
To never know a single day without a big commotion?

And when I try and sleep, I see coffins closing

[Break: K'naan]
Yeah!
Yeah!

[Verse 2]
We used to take barbed wire
Mold them around discarded bike tires
Roll 'em down the hill on foot, blazing
Now, that was our version of mountain bike racing
(""Damn!"") Do you see why it’s amazing?
When someone comes out of such a dire situation
And learns the English language just to share his observation?
Probably get a Grammy without a grammar education
So fuck you, school, and fuck you, immigration!
And all of you who thought I wouldn’t amount to constipation
And now, I’m here without the slightest fear and reservation
They love me in the slums and the Native reservations
The world is a ghetto, administering deprivation
But mommy didn’t raise no fool—did she, Hoyo?
I promised I would get it and remain strictly loyal
'Cause when they get it—then, they let it all switch and spoil
But I just illuminated it like kitchen foil
A lot of mainstream niggas is yapping about yapping
A lot of underground niggas is rapping about rapping
I just wanna tell you what’s really crack-a-lackin'
Before the tears came down, this is what happened

She told me when I come to her town, to hit her up and it's going down
She e-mailed me this old picture before she had her baby boy
I was ready to pay her a visit, she used to look like Ke-Toi
But, one too many Almond Joys, I went and seen this girl in person
But when that big {bitch} opened the door I damn near started crying and cursin'
(Damn) Just too many Megabytes and not enough Roadrunner
But big girls need love too, so I beat it up like Royal Rumble
Sheeeit, lil' momma looked like a whale she broke the scale
I told her baby I gotta bail, I won't tell if you won't tell
What the hell, the first minute I got in range of the nearest Dell
I changed my screenname and my number, this internet pimpin still prevails

[Paul Wall]
So I log on to the Facebook, I'm tryin to find me a good look

18th Letter,Rakim,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse: Rakim]
What, uhh, yo
Just when things seemed the same, and the whole scene is lame
I come and reign with the unexplained for the brains 'til things change
They strain to sling slang, I'm trained to bring game
History that I arranged been regained by King James
Go to practice, with tactics, when the track hits, theatrics
Women that look like actress the status of Cleopatra's
Stacks of mathematics to feed yo-asiatics
As I find out, what the facts is, for geographic
No time to sip Mo's with hostess, never mind what the total gross is
I rip shows, stay focused, and split cheese, with soldiers
While you hit trees and coast I spit flows that be ferocious
And with these explosives, I split seas for Moses
Shine permanently only my mind's concernin me
Fire burns in me eternally time's eternity
Followers turn on me they'll be in a mental infirmary
Determinely advance technology better than Germany
Since the first days you know of, till the last days is over
I was always the flow-er, I made waves for Noah
From a compound, to the anatomy, to the breakdown of a atom
Some of my rap patterns, still surround Saturn
From the ancient hieroglyphics, to graffiti painted pictures
I study I know the scriptures but nowaday ain't it vicious
Date back I go beyond, check the holy Qu'ran
To speeches at the autobahn, now we get our party on
So being benificent, I bless em with dialogue
They expectin the next testament, by the God
I roam through battlezones with chrome for chaperone
Blast beat with saxophones one of the baddest rappers known
Every country city and borough, sidestreet and ghetto
Isle and alley and meadow, theories thorough enough to echo
When it was one mass of land, with one nash' of man
And the whole mass was ran under one master plan
Since the world's metamorphis, and the plan is kept in orbit
Turntables we spin awkward but needles never skip off it
Rhythms we expressin similar to our ancestors
It'll answer your questions if you understand the message
From the days of the slave choppers, to the new age of prophets
As heavy as hip-hop is I'm always ready to drop it
From the mind which is one of Allah's best designs
And mines'll stand the test of time, when I rhyme
The 18th Letter, the prophecy professor
I stay clever, long as the planet stay together
Bring up praise from Mecca, make a phrase for the better
In new days to remember, always and forever
(repeat 2X)

Clipse, ""Hell Hath No Fury"", B
Let 'em know, daddy, Mr. Lee, haha

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Fear him, as soon as you hear him
Upon my arrival, the dope dealers cheer him (Got it for cheap)
Just like a revival, the verse tends to steer 'em
Through a life in the fast lane, I German engineer 'em
No serum can cure all the pain I've endured
From crack to rap to back to selling it pure
For every record I potentially sell in the store
It's like Mecca to the dealer that's selling it raw
So many deceive ya
I'm more in touch with the keys, move over Alicia
I force feed ya the metric scale
Rap's like child's play, my show and tell
Within each verse, you see the truth's unveiled
They manufacture proof as they lie to themselves
Puppets on the string like a yo-yo
Bouncing like a pogo, they praying I never go solo

The wool's removed and now I see (Yeah)
My leg was pulled, the joke's on me (Haha)
So heartbreakin', like lovin' a whore
Might hurt ya once, but never no more
It's like tryin to fly but they clippin' your wings
And that's exactly why the caged bird sings
Who can nickname it? The shame rings true
Seems to me reparations are overdue
I done been to the top, I done sipped the juice
And with that being said, bird crumbs'll never do
Even on my last, not a penny in the bank
I'ma stand on my own, so thanks, but no thanks
Keep the pranks as I bid farewell (Uh)
I gotta answer to Marcus and Jennelle
And to little brother Terrence who I love dearly so
If ever I had millions, never would you push blow, never (G-g-got it for cheap)

I'm the best since he died, and he lied
The spirit of competition, one verse could start jihad
CPR Pusha, the flow tends to revive
Pullin' the covers back, I expose what you disguise
My presence is felt, the pressure is on
A 4'11"" Cuban helped us weather the storm
Pyrex and powder, it was back to the norm
Through all the adversity, the fury was born

[Verse 4: Malice]
Niggas don't get the picture, it's written in scripture
Even ask your mama, she'll tell you that blood's thicker
And I don't know how them other niggas built
And I don't know if ever they feel guilt
Or maybe niggas just too high on they stilts
But this one's on me, I'ma view it as spilt milk
Grandma, look at me, I'm turnin' the other cheek
It's the R-E-U-P G-A-N-G (G-g-got it for cheap)

Ride Around Shining,Clipse,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: Pusha T]
All I want to do is ride around shinin' while I can afford it
Plenty ice on my neck, so I don't get nauseous
Float around in the greatest of Porsches
Feel like a chuckwagon 'cause I'm on twelve horses
And the three behind mine (Uh), they be the clique
So much ice in they Rollies, they shit don't tick, man
Winter through the summer (What?), care less what it cost me
While I'm shoveling the snow, man, call me Frosty Lover

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
This for the hundred-thousand dollar kitted German drivers
With big rims and low-pro tires
Fuckin' with college bitches with innocent looks like Mýa
Corrupt they mind, turn 'em to liars, I groom 'em well
Dior whore, Christian Lacroix
Keep guns stashed under the floorboard
Enough to start World War
Paradise in reaches, home next to beaches
Hair pressed, blowin' in the wind, shit 'bout long as Jesus
Hostilely speaks the gospel, so match this
Pusha push John P. Kees with these sounds of crackness, uh
The Black Martha Stewart, let me show you how to do it
Break down pies to pieces, make cocaine quiches, uh
Money piles high as my nieces
Hefty bags full of cash, cars full of ass
Rolex presidential, bitch, feel the glass

Hah, it's that look that astounds
Life's a circus, I parade the six through these clowns
The crown is vacant, I'm takin' the proper steps
I'm takin' them Poppa steps, they prayin' for my downfall
Is it the bling? The king, conquistador
That my jeweler made the face blush on the Franck Muller
The R shape peculiar, it's awesome, laying over dark skin
Lookin' like arson when I park in the left, it's constant
Minute hand is like Parkinson's
You a fish where the sharks a-swim
In that opaque linen with the odd-colored stitching
V12 on the Modena, you can see the pistons
HREs on it, mami, see it glisten
When I— make all of her twist like Dickens
It's feelin' like parts is missin'
Top stole, push soul, gotta drive it like pole position 'til my soul is risen

Welcome to the world of Rollies
VS diamonds and that fifty-thousand dollar showpiece got me shinin'
First nigga holler, ""Show me""
Let that nine millimeter turn a fella ghostly
Hell, I'll even grant amnesty to those who owe me
You fuckin' faggots, you need to raise your glass and toast me
Niggas can't figure the format for hustler criteria
Not chrome, chrome rims with stallion insignia
Listen, youngin, you've only just begun
""You'll understand when you're older,"" said father to the son
Who would've thought such riches stem from ill rhymes?
Canary yellow diamonds size of yield signs, slow down
And proceed with caution
Carousel of horses with dual exhaustion, 'fess up
Youngin, you'll always be next up
Go against I, forever play catch-up, nigga
[Chorus: Pusha T]
All I want to do is ride around shinin' while I can afford it
Plenty ice on my neck, so I don't get nauseous

Hello New World,Clipse,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Pharrell]
Straight crushing you

[Chorus: Pharrell]
Hello, new world, here we come
On them Twinkie trains with the hood screaming, ""We on our way""
Can't forget where I come from
So I extend my hand to my man, screamin', ""I'm on my way""
Yes, I rap, but best believe
Them things still get wrapped by papi, screamin', ""It's on its way""
Can't wait for the next nigga
From my hood to say, ""Look out, world, I'm on my way""

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
I listen to the beat and the rhyme is wrote
See, I was sixteen, eyes full of hope
Baggin' up grams at the Hyatt, though
The news called it crack, I called it Diet Coke (Oh)
At the same time, hidin' from mama, dodgin' the drama
Fuckin' plenty bitches while duckin' a baby mama
I found poetry, excuse me, Floetry
Say yes, niggas hear the ""yuugh"" and they know it's me
Make 'em sick to they stomach how they supposed to be
Sippin' on a fifty-foot yacht, nigga, motion free
Ocean in my backyard where it's supposed to be
Funny how my neighbors don't think it's where I'm supposed to be
They think I'm cuter in jail
But the only time I'm boxed in is when the roof's on the SL
And that even come off, so that would mean I'm visiting
New world, I hope y'all listenin', envisionin'

This goes out to my A-alikes who hang out on them corners
Who rock Air Nikes, live a hustler's way of life
In white tees, constantly duckin' from D's
Pumpin' that D arm readily, waiting to squeeze
Who stay cookin', stay lookin' over they shoulders
Holdin' them boulders, tryin' to avoid central booking
I ain't coming at you, quote-unquote famous rapper
Who turn positive, try to tell you how to live
But this information, I must pass to the homies
If hustlin' is a must, be Sosa, not Tony
We can all shine, I want your wrist lit like mine
Neck and ears, I want it lit like mine
Foreign cars, stick shift, six gears like mine
Anything that keep mama from cryin', visitin'
You behind that glass while you await sentencin'
'Cause the judge is sayin' life like it ain't someone's life

Just want y'all to know it's 'bout time for us to come up and make a change, man
They keep tryna keep us down
But that ain't the way to be, man
It's 'bout time for us to get it together, man
Everybody else put they shit together
Why the niggas can't get together, put their money together?
Hustlers come together with hustlers, know what I'm saying?
This ain't just for the players in VA
This for players all over the world, this is Grimey

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Time's a-wasting, niggas doin' so much hatin'
Free your heart and show your greatness
I, like you, had to come from up under the basement
Just like you, had Satan tryin' my patience
Still, you look at me through jealous eyes
I wish to see all my niggas rise up
Get that money, put the nines up
Piggyback from out the ghetto 'fore time's up, niggas rush

Drinkin Henn and acting like it do something to me
Hope this indecent proposal make you do somethin with me

The game needs me, cause I'm drama
I got problems, I can't resolve 'em
It's no beefing, I can't call 'em
We riding, surviving
Tryin not to die then, look 'em in his eyes then

[Verse 1]
Remember me? The hype man that came in to blaze shit
Brought in by the white man like I came on a slave ship, in chains
Good old master done turned his back on the only rapper
Can match him and burn him on his own track with him
No going back wit him, cause holmes acting
Like he's got Capone backing him, why? He's gone platinum
Wow, I'm hurt cause now it's words
Cause now he's famous 'bout as down to Earth as Uranus or worse
My value will grow with my next release cut the check
I suggest you invest in extra ink
My next album should raise the brow of every man
Woman and child, and today I gotta get paid
Cause you gotta sign on your door that says keep out
I can't find you no more I can't reach out
You truly know more later after you learn
My last favor to ask you is where, don't do me no more favors

Soon the New Day,Talib Kweli,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Norah Jones]
And nature's game once more begins

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
Here we go like, yes yes ya'll
To the beat ya'll
Ain't no sleep ya'll
To the break of dawn
Five o'clock in the morning
We keep rockin' on
The workin' people runnin' like the stop clock is on
We got it poppin' in the meat market
Chicks take a seat, park it
By the bar so they can meet the vic with deep pockets
And them dudes buy them cars and turn 'em in to sweet objects of desire
Big rims and them tires
We finna drop it like it's heavy as hell
The Clan of the Cavebear
Used to use the club to hit and drag her by the hair
Still use the club to get her a martini or a beer
Try to get her home and put the smell of sex in the air
Come through like the Cable Guy
Get 'er done
That 'ole hit 'n run
Turn 'em into bitter ones
Tonight is catch me if you can
You can taste the ginger bread
Ain't nothin' like wakin' up with a stranger in your bed, nope
[Refrain: Norah Jones/Talib Kweli]
Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow I'll be like
Where am I, what's your name
Gotta go, I'm glad you came
But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe you're the one
Soon the new day breaks the dawn

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Putting on some Airs
King For a Day
Hard to face your fears we wear the mask like Cory McKay
You have a ball today
It's all a masquerade
Shorty paint her face like a clown but can't take away the frown
Found under the make-up
I asked her, what's your passion
Answered, what's the paper
She sleepin' and they don't want her to wake up
Maybe then she'll realize her own beauty
Baby, you a star and not just a star on some dude's home movies

[Refrain: Norah Jones/Talib Kweli]
Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow I'll be like
Where am I, what's your name
Gotta go, I'm glad you came
But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe you're the one
Soon the new day breaks the dawn
[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
Steppin' out, I got my best outfit on
Gotta get it in
I'm slippin' in the darkness like most of the day is gone
We up all night I wonder if can hang
We used to hang from a tree, now we hang behind the rope, we V.I.P
We do it B.I.G
Ain't no need to see I.D
The entire scenery shrouded in mystery
Clouded with greenery
Six girls to every three dudes
So you have half a chance if you ask to have a dance
The ones ready to freak off don't need no romance
They belong to the sisterhood of the traveling pants
They got them hungry eyes you know sensual trance
At a glance the alcohol got you sexually advanced
The truth is so boring you gotta pretend a little
The antidote is more colorful the rainbow that end in Skittles
And the quest to trap the cat
The game is your Tender Vittles to get the bruce to say the sky's fallin
Like you Chicken Little, come on

[Refrain: Norah Jones/Talib Kweli]
Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow I'll be like
Where am I, what's your name
Gotta go, I'm glad you came
But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe you're the one
Soon the new day breaks the dawn"

Swear it ain't me in the P.E. Logo

Vil, one shot, one kill
Spotted him, got his off the top, done deal
Spill your guts, they say they said the Don dead good
You could ask the dread in your hood or John Ed Wood
The truth is in the verse not on the bottle bottom
Black devils is the worst, first you gotta spot 'em
Ain't never get stuck on their boats
And don't give a fuck if he gettin' their votes
At most he may exchange pleasantries
Really don't go for the sex change energies
Or Ben 'n' Jerry's berries
Friends with make pretend fairies who take men's cherries
Just don't boycott his shit

Swish, twenty-four, that's Black Mamba
Snoop Dogg, he’s a dope rhymer

In a yellow six deuce with the purple plates
I dip and dodge
I hit three and roll
Fish and chips
Bounce pass down to Pau Gasol
We don't give a damn about the big three
LA Lake show we bout to three-peat
And you can bet, that's on the set
Ron Artest about to get wet
I'm on the flo’ and thats a fact
Sittin’ next to uncle Jack blazin’ up the purple sack

Blow it in the air boy, know they gon feel that

Kobe Bryant,Lil Wayne,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Kobe Bryant]
I want to be the best
I want to be the best, simple and plain
That's why I play the game
And to be the best you have to win
And that's what drives me

[Intro: Stephen A. Smith]
He's the best player in the game
It's just that simple
There's nothing that Kobe Bryant can't do
He will defend your best player
He will shoot from the perimeter
He will get all in yo' mug
He will do whatever it takes
He is the most complete basketball player
In the game today - bar none
He has an assassin's mentality
I said this week, I said this when the trade went down
And I will repeat it again
Who's starving more for an NBA World Championship
More than Kobe Bryant
There is no one
This guy is highly motivated
What separates Kobe from the pack
More than Kobe Bryant, there is no one
[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Kobe doin' work, 2-4 on my shirt
He the greatest on the court, and I'm the greatest on the verse
Going for the fourth ring like it was his first
Gotta get the gleam, do it for Kareem
Two-four so nice, my flow so mean
Catch me at the game sitting next to Goldstein
Kobe Bryant Nikes, purple gold strings
Kobe in the game, dunkin' on the whole
Black Mamba, attack, conquer
Basketball beast, rap monster
Crossover good, or turnaround jumper
Or just drive the lane and dunk on dunkers
You know where it's goin', it's goin' down, yo
This is the Lakeshow, but don't drown, though
I call him King Bryant, now let the crown show

[Interlude: LeBron James]
I'm definitely, I'm just lost for words
I mean, he's amazing

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Pass me the damn ball
I don't need a pick at all
And don't worry 'bout my shot
Cause I'ma get that off
Yea, I drops 40 on your double team
Then I drop 81 on another team
Yeah, you better guard me with caution
And watch I work 'em like a auction
No such thing as exhaustion
No time for resting
Cause I don't take breaks
I just break records
And I prefer the ball with three seconds
And I bet we gon' win it all in three seconds
Ya dig
That is a guarantee
Apparently
And please tell your defense
Don't ever man to man with me
Double team, triple team
Your defenders sick of me
But, I never let 'em get to me
Literally
Step back and give 'em a three
Ain't no defending me
[Interlude: Reporter & LeBron James]
One guy certainly envious of the way Bryant's playing lately, LeBron James
I've been quoted saying that
He's definitely the best player in our league
Um, to me, in my eyes
The best scorer in our league
And there's not another guy in our league
That can accomplish some of the things
That he's doing

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Never take a day off
Catch you at the top of the key
And get a J off
Baseline face time
Tongue out like two-three
Even two-three gotta love how I do me
Practice while you sleep
Practice in my sleep
Straight outta high school
Tha brackets ain't for me
I will be jumpin' over you
Like I got a mattress at my feet
And all is Phil Jackson say is you
Better be passin' it to me
I put the master in the piece
Attack you like a beast
And I am starvin' for victory
And that means I'mma eat
And when they ask you who's the best
Then the answer should be me
[Interlude 3: Elie Seckbach/Mikael Pietrus]
Seckbach: Who's the best player in the NBA
Mikael: Um, I'll say Kobe Bryant
Seckback: Really? Why
Mikael: Because you never know what you're gonna get!

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Call me Mr. Clutch or Mr. Automatic
I can post 'em up, or Lamar go get the alley
I'm going for the ring
I'm going for the ring
I went to Beijing
And came back with the bling
Who they want
They want Kobe
And what he want
He want the trophy
The victory
And the glory
No Shaq
No Robert Horry
Now break 'em off, Kobe break 'em off, yeah
You better be where that Laker don't, yeah
Just give him the ball and he take it off, yeah
Or he properly dishing it to Gasol, yeah
Or give it to D-Fish on the wing, yeah
Or just let lil' Ariza do his thing, yeah
Cause I'm great, and so is my team, yeah
[I thought you want to be the greatest]
Uh, do it for Magic
It's your time baby
I see nothin' wrong with doin' it four times baby
I'm the best yes
And he the best yeah
Don't worry LeBron - get 'em next year
Now what's defense
To an assassin
Killer instinct
Murder the basket
Then steal the ball back
Hold it for ransom
It's more than a game
This is a passion
Been a all-star, been a champion
Free throw line, you hear 'em chanting
MVP, MVP
Kobe Bryant aka MV-me
In knee deep, smash any D
Whoever he is he can't guard me
He can't guard me

Fight night (Sho' ya right)
The dumb and dumber, my cats pack thunder
And I got mo' (w)raps than Mumm-Ra

Sing a love ballad, then toss each other's salad

Hoes in the ozone, cell phones and clones it's on
Busta Rhymes said, ""There's only 2 years left""
So nowadays I'm playin' russian roulette wit' a tech (ha)
Ghetto holocaust survivor, everyday
From the S.S stormtroopin P.D. in L.A
Tellin me bein' black on Saturday night is a felony

Holy are you
Holy are you
There is no God but you
There is no God but you
Praised be the Lord

[Verse 1]
For those who find it hard to believe, and it is
Why they call me the God MC the lyricist
Trace this style to the roots from Genesis
The world wonder, I'm still standing like pyramids
Design so vivid, every brick it got a story to tell
My rhyme flow different like a hieroglyphic
Mind prolific, infinite, like mathematic
The first language, now add that and add graphics
Then go let the blocks know it's the gospel
Life's new manual so watch close
The new Michelangelo and Pablo Picasso
Prepared to show you the cosmos and rock flows
Even my lyrical metaphysical
What this'll do is help you get to your spiritual pinnacle
You find your mind too far-fetched for it to fathom
I bring the darkness to the light, split the atom
It's like watching the big bang theory emerge
I take titles, bond them to reveal new words
They want a clear view
From the farthest and the darkest corners of the universe
To a corner near you
A pharaoh in ghetto apparel, stay blinged up
Fort Knox display, a modern day King Tut
Wrapped tight, rap like I've been preserved in time
Spit the holy water, then touch it and turn it to wine
It's the God
[Chorus]
Holy are you
Holy are you
There is no God but you
There is no God but you
Praised be the Lord

[Verse 2]
We were children of the most high, so we fell
From paradise to holy hell
Probably descendants of the Holy Grail
Another part of history they won't reveal
Times'll only tell
You waiting for Judgment? It came
In the form of a thug in the game
To create a strong position, there's blood in my vein
The chemical is identical, we one and the same
With seven letters in all three of my government names
Walk on water? Nah, neither did Jesus
It's a parable to make followers and readers believers
From Egypt to Budapest, Rakim is the truest left
Understand the Scriptures like the minister Louis F
I told you who God is, you ignored me like most the prophets
Jesus, Solomon, Abraham, Moses and Muhammad
I showed the scholars, we'll fulfill the broken promise
I spit this truth to predict the future like Nostradamus
Like Revelations, I'm hoping my quotes reveal
The seven spirits of God when I open the seal
Interpret the holy Quran, these flows will guide you
Translate the Torah, and decode the Bible
Warn the elders in the mosques, masons, and the law
The seven churches, the synagogues, it's the Renaissance
Skin is bronze like the Messiah
Rakim Allah's about to reveal the biggest secret in time: Men are God
[Chorus]
Holy are you
Holy are you
There is no God but you
There is no God but you
Praised be the Lord"

Now in my younger days I used to sport a rag
Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag
G'd up from the feet up
Blue'd up from the shoe up's how I grew up
Loc'n, smokin' and drinkin' til we threw up (until we threw up)
At Leimert Park, taggin', hittin' fools up
Ditching my class, just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up
But don't sleep, young niggas quick to shoot you
Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I maneuver, dope like Cuba
Got 'em jumpin Disciples to the Hoover
[Verse 2: King T]
I'm coming ""Straight Outta Compton"" with a loose cannon
Smoke big green, call it Bruce Banner
Watch your manners, at last another blast from the top notch
From way back with the pop rocks, I pop lock witcha
Picture this, Dr. Dre twisting wit Tha Liks
And Hittman bought a fix
Don't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch
Here it tick tick tick tick *boom*
Wait a minute it's on, I tell it like a true mackadelic
Weed and cocaine sold separate, check it
From sundown to sunup, clown and run up
The Aftermath'll be two in your gut, nigga what?

[Hook: Knoc-Turn'al & Kokane]
We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way in L.A.!

[Verse 3: Hittman]
Gimme that mic fool, it's a West coast jack move
They call me Hitt 'cause I spit like gats do
Cock me back
Bust caps for my Macz Crew, at Fairfax
Who used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true
But I grew up where niggas jack you, harass you
Blast you, for that set you claim (where you from?)
Mash on you for your Turkish chain, C.K. B.K
Blue'd up or flame, I ran wit a gang
I helped niggas get jacked for they Dana Dane's
My pants hang below my waistline
I look humble wanna rumble? (yeah yeah)
I bang though, like Vince Carter from the baseline
Don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, AK's and 9's
One-time's, sun-shines, and fine-ass bitches
Hawaiian Thai, drive-bys, six-fo's on switches
[Verse 4: Xzibit]
I was raised in the hood called WHAT-THE-DIF'
Where the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin' on us can suck a dick
If I catch you touching mine you catch a flat-line, dead on the floor
Better than yours, driving away gettin' head from a whore
It's AvireX-to-the-Z
Fuckin' with me might get you banned from TV
Cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time
Multiply, we don't die, the streets don't lie
What, so neither do I, I'm bad for your health
Like puttin' a pistol up to your face and blastin' yourself

[Verse 5: Defari]
Five in the mornin', burglars at my do'
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
Let 'em come in BOW, he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggas, who buy fifths by the fo'
And brews by the case
Slap you in the face with the bass, Dr. Dre laced
Likwit Kings with Sedans and gold rings
Haters scope the style, but can't find no openings

[Hook: Knoc-Turn'al, Kokane]
We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat

Everything is now on the Internet
Lil B

[Verse 1]
The age of information
I grew up and never blew up
I'm knowin' one day I'll be the big dog
Colombian cocaine white
With lavish women surrounding me and in my carriage
The only time I call a chick now is Bloody Mary
It's in the mirror
I'm feelin' like I'm a champion, lookin' like I'm a mannequin
Cannabis residue is on my seat from breaking down again
I'm on computers
Profusely
Searching on the internet for answers, given to me
It's like I'm married, I'm watching the the bloggers heavily
TV is ran by money, how am I supposed to be?
The truth is near me, I can hear it and I can feel it
But are we dumbing down for technology and the cost of living?
I just forget it, continually smoking heavily
Thinkin' about the melody
Thinkin' of what's ahead of me
We comin' further than ever to live in space and
Somebody got the weapon that's controlling the human race
[Hook]
It's the age of information, the age of information
This is the age of information
Everything is on the Internet now
Data
Yes

[Verse 2]
My desktop is made to sedate me
Thinkin' illogically
On my laptop for hours like I'm in college, B
Honestly asking Google 'bout things that I should learn about
Can't even get lost in the navi
Inside, cell-phone overtaking
Got a car so never walkin'
They took away places where it's only the forest
I'm jogging in peace
I got my iPod slappin' these beats
I'm on a mission to find peace and precision
The cost of living is taxes and jail time without time to find your passion
I'm askin' the older people how you make it to your status
They laugh, because they see reflection while I'm askin' questions
And the best gift is to listen
Learn math to count your blessings
Used to catch a bus on AC transit, dark nights
Look like 20/20 lens-out of focus
Waitin' outside of stores
Askin' elders to buy Swishers and they come back with fifty cents
Now I'm buyin' liquor
MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter
Youtube often showing porno off to the average human being
I'm watchin' people in Japan naked G's from overseas
Chatroulette
I used to be on the corner where it's drug roulette
So pick, obviously
The information like art, it hurt the race
Because we judge before we classify
It's like a cage, human race has failed
Even though we in space we still hate ourselves
The age of information is hell
[Outro]
When I said that information has hurt the race
This age of information has hurt the race, and you know why
Because all we do is judge
All the movies, all the Internet, all we do is classify people
Now I feel the Internet has ruined the human race
Even though, you know, we can fly, and cars and technology has gotten better
I feel the the human race is not progressed as much as we should be
How come the human race isn't progressing as fast as technology has
Yeah, we gonna be staying on the moon
But there's still gonna be racists
So, in the end, are we really winning -- these nuclear bombs, nuclear war
What's going on

Sit Down Man,Das Racist,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Heems]
I'm from Cop Killer, never killed a cop though
More the type to burn a spliff and eat a bag of nachos
More the type to read a novel, maybe bout Navajos
On a sunny day I'm on the block in a poncho
Venomous, extra sick, tell me how my bars feel
Talk shit, tell me how the floor of the bar feel
Young cocoa butter, I'm fresh as new car smell
Cynical lasagna loving cat, call me Garfield
Graffiti goes legit streets spray tags for soup cans
I paint Marine Green Newport packs, now who down?
Three brown, the slim thang I need a brand new van
To tour so they can make enough funds to send a Sudan
Spraying copyright symbols on yoga mats until I'm high enough
To type a bunch of rhyming words to tell you how I'm fly and stuff
Writing racial rants, Craigslist, start the race war
High as space dog, wild as three caged boars
Mom Dukes never told me to go to my room
A wild juvenile, she threatened to send me to Dehradun
That's in the motherland, her lover-dad hit me with a broom
Black and blue, at school where white kids call me dune coon
I'm still living this shit, something like a pigeon and pissed
Scribblin' some lip words to a script, literal shit
Belittled, we get hit quick, your little dick
Kicked in just for giggles and shits
Seriously...
[Verse 2: Kool A.D.]
Aright, what's up?
Papa watch me on Google Alerts, hi dad!
I'm at the Whitney with DJ Spooky, on an iPad
Shotgunning Schlitz in a woman's can
And catching some catch as you can
Key bumps from the bug-eyed man fan
Can, can, can you do the smarty-pants can-can?
So you think you can dance? Here is your stinking advance
Back ends, tap them, stack ends
White people, play this for you black friends
Black people smack them
Moose spoonin' with candy flippers
Whomever the edible panties fit
Gets the candy glass brandy-snifter
Shake hands with fans that demand a picture
Like ""Hey man, hey man, are you Himanshu, or Victor?""
Soul dudes, show crew, home brews, call Kool A.D
Living contradictory since '83
Arkansas street, like a block from the projects
HP some more blocks from some other projects
To Alameda so we not by the projects
Now look at me, getting nods from my projects
The brother's logic is stop when you got it
But I don't got it yet, so I'm not gonna stop it
Street freak-a-leak, socialize with the fetally
Meek shall inherit the earth, Earth shall inherit the meek
You can stare at the street but the street stare back at you
Talk greasy, somebody take a crack at you
Act the fool, somebody finna laugh at you
Like ""dude, I don't like your fucking attitude""
[Verse 3: El-P]
Gangster computer god, mind slut's my pseudonym
Fuck anyone giddily, giggle, simply misery
Feelings whittle bitch pitches, but where the juicy tag
First to always be the great choosy Brooklyn or Lucy Brown
Harbinger of the bum rush plus oozin' away a ton or more
Buddy cops kiss each other Pederast priests fuck whores
Let's set the moral compass to something a little sacrilege
I'm Pirate Jenny this whole town Black Freighter, I'm maggin' this
Nobody sleeps tonight, keep your car alarm evening
Perpetual garbage truck, annoying ice cream truck jingling
(Hey young world) conscious got donkey-punched by aristocrats
Maniac, brainiac, fist-fucked in a dunce cap
Looking at it from space, you can see the race is just one lap
The tranquility now is just future anarchy unhatched
I'm on a new drug plus alternate reality
Some dimensional shifting It's hidden from all the cowardly
Gypsies read the palm and they vomit
They give me back my dollar, hollerin ""Oh God! Get out you monster!""
Mumalo covered a song and it's a running joke
My comedy is common is as greymatter converted into runny yolk
I'm not in the mood (stop) A lot more to rue (raw)
Hot rod of intoxicants (roo!) Gobblin your food (gone)
Applaud to the truthiness, truly I'm a lost boy
Half-man, half-smoke, no joke got it on Locke boy
Take your little sad poopy-pants to the corner toy

Break her down till she can’t sleep without the valium
Rhyming only when the cameras come
I'mma boss, M. Bison and Ganon in one
I write my life story and be everyone’s idol
But what’s the point? We already got one bible
Shout out to Lennon, my sound not dependent
On what they did yesterday, I’m not remembering
You wanna take it back? Well I’m good
My backpack got an axe to cut my own path through the woods
As long as that’s understood, we can sit straight
I just changed my life off a free mixtape
Let these kids hate, I let the drummer drum
Me and the beat going one on one

You got me like ay yo, I don’t got time to play so
I’m waiting on your say so you know I’ll hold you down
And y’all got me like ay yo, what more can I say though?

I gotta enough charm that Jacob could take a day off
All I do is take charge and make songs
And I got a modern play list without the radio station paid off
Your buzz kinda like Webster, it couldn’t grow
How it feel to sell your soul ‘cause I wouldn’t know?
Yeah, that check’s nice but you need to put in O’s
Six for example and I think we might be good to go
Maybe I can make it work, maybe I can flip the script
Maybe I can be the best, maybe I can give a shit
Maybe rap’s finished and I'm not trying to resurrect
Maybe I’m a zombie, give me brains to the death
From B-Boys and windmills to decoys and cheap thrills, destroy and rebuild

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Laws]
I’ll hold you down about to rap’s go to sound
Your manager gonna throw two towels and these kids sleeping on me
First period, homeroom style, this is serious, don’t you smile
I'mma show you how to rap rough but be friendly, what do it mean?
My fam shocked ‘cause they like me as a human being
I gotta stand out, me being a new MC
So I could bring the game to its knees, true indeed
You would be honored just to make my acquaintance
I been exercising my patience and my patience so strong
When I say that I'm patiently waiting that the game could take a vacation
I’ll support y’all, watch me strong arm all these fakers that’s hating
With a style so secret like I take after Masons
See, my sound's so sweet and my grace is amazing
Rap charity, make a donation

Hahahah, ladies and gentleman
You are now about to witness the strength of Aftermath
Straight out the mothafuckin' streets of Compton
Put your hands together, for Game, bitch! Hahahaha
Yeah! Yeah, mothafuckas!
Compton's back on the mothafuckin' map
Aftermath in that ass, bitch
Game, let's go

[Verse 1: The Game]
Me and Marshall ain't start shit, they listen to our shit
Then talk shit about us but that shit is foul when
I'm tryna feed my son and drop multi-platinum albums
Make my mother proud that her son made it out
But it's hard when they hate us, and think Em a racist
They say shit but fuck them, Shady one of the greatest
Like Biggie and 'Pac was, we saw the throne was empty
And decided to chase it, me, him and 50 racin'
This rap shit is basic, I followed that Jay shit
Think of what I wanna say, step in the booth and one-take it
How could I not sell a million when I'm rappin' on Dre hits
Then spit that classical L.A. N.W.A. shit
The media is bullshit, now we can't even say bitch
They accusin' Michael of touchin' kids in the wrong places
At first they embraced him, had a couple of facelifts
Now people wanna place him with murderers and rapists
They comin', I can taste this, swear to God I ain't racin'
Put the clip in and waste 'em before I go out on that fake shit
I'm so sick and tired of this black shit, this white shit
So I sit here and write shit, Em they ain't gon' like this
So they callin' us
[Hook: The Game, Eminem & Dr. Dre]
We ain't goin'
Nowhere, so fuck you
We ain't goin'
Nowhere, so fuck you
This day, the game, will never be the same (we ain't, goin')
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
The game just isn't the same, it's changing (we ain't, goin')
It's a new game! You're now about to witness the power
Nowhere, so fuck you

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Only Dre can judge me for the mistakes I'm making
If I'm faking, I'm Clay Aiken
You ain't 50 and you ain't Game, you lame, you're tame, bitch
You're mild sauce, you ain't ready to make that flame switch
You'll end up in the same situation, same shit
Different day, just with different gangstas in your face, which
Way do you wanna face when your brain's hit pavement?
Think of what you'll say to Pastor Mase and save it
For the day that they got them affidavits waving
In my face, looking for answers, rap sensation
Eminem battles to ward off accusations
That he had somebody blasted, the mask of Jason
Was found at the scene of the task with masking tape
And the victim's penis up his ass, a basket case
And they ask him to clean up his act, you bastards wasting
Too much time, me no kiss ass, and if that's the case then
We ain't going!
[Hook: The Game, Eminem & Dr. Dre]
We ain't, goin'

Nowhere, so fuck you

[Verse 3: The Game]
Lo, get Dre on the phone quick
Tell him Em' just killed me on my own shit
I'm walking through 8 Mile, startin' to get home sick
I'ma do Shady numbers, I'm ridin' my own dick
Yeah the chrome sick, the window's tinted
If Eminem is in it, body armor under the Pendleton
These niggas is killing it, take a minute to listen
Turn down my Jimi Hendrix, I'll throw your demo out the window
For telling me it's hot, when it's not and you got
What you got from them rocks, on the block, you just stopped
Telling Dre you got shot with a Glock, that don't fade me
I'm crazy, why the fuck you think I'm rhyming with Shady?
I don't care if the radio don't play me, I say
What I say when I feel like I'm feeling today
And get hard when these bitches see my car in the streets
I can't even take my son to cop them G-Unit sneaks
So I'm gone, bitch
[Hook: The Game, Eminem & Dr. Dre]
We ain't, goin'
Nowhere, so fuck you
We ain't, goin'

Your bitch be at the bar and she thinking I'm finna spoil her
‘Cause I be in the car with the fins and the spoilers
When it come to models, I can never make the wrong decision
She five-ten but I'm really good at long division
I ain't that nigga talking what he will or probably might do
Call it like a shark bitch, girl I'll probably bite you
Left me in the jungle, didn't think I'd make it out it
Popped up out that bitch, rocking a alligator outfit
Burgundy coupe, maroon roof, shitting on the world
Like they gave me a moon suit and some prune juice
So bitch niggas act right all day, I dare the sun to come out
We'll have night all day, the next day they'll talk about that night all day
I shine bright, they don't know whether it's night or day
Fuck that shit, what it really do though?
Back in the building with a silly new flow
Ain't a limit to the place that I'm willing to go
And my swag too high for any ceiling you know?
Don't my flow disturb y'all? I be in your girl wall
She want me to hit it so she pitch it like a curve ball

Brought cake to make cake welcome to the bake Sale

Theres only 1 me I know 37 yous
And groceries from the trunk whenever I go help
Remind me my chain heavy like 2 gallons of milk
And every track I'm on I'm movin in stealth
And if you get in the way then you just killing yourself
I got plenty bitches, but even more hate
'Cos they all know im super all I need is a cape
And my favorites don't bug me

I'll keep living through my fans because I gave my heart to them
And if you do get up the heart to throw a challenge my way
I will gladly eat your heart and call it Valentine's Day
Homie, you need to see college just to see how I devoured this
I'm a rapping scientist, philosopher, theologist
You make so much shit up, you should be a cosmetologist
Your bitch ass should be on the cover of Cosmopolitan
But Los, you're the pretty boy, you could of been modeling
Nigga, shut the fuck up, get the door and let the models in
They say they go hard as me as if they want a problem then
They decorating bathrooms the way they throwing towels in
Homie, get your swagger up about another mile or two
My flow is a Molotov, you don't possess the molecules
I could say if I was you but I can not fathom that
That would mean I'd have to take my dreams of having Phantoms back
And my bitches go so hard, I told ‘em they could share me
Now they so close, it scares me, shout out to Katy Perry
Nobody likes you when nobody’s like you
But I'll be damned if I lose to some nobodies like you
Homie, I will write you some shit that's so right you
Wish you had the rights to but you won't have the right to
My left tied behind my back, just time out, tie my right too

I swear that Lambo and that Bentley look like they be bout to fly
Tell them lames soon as I cop ‘em, come and take me out the sky
I'm in love with your girlfriend, I'm crazy about her thighs
But she ain't pregnant by me 'less she having babies out her eyes
Think about it like damn, every time we do it
I just let my fluid go all over her two lips
I don't give her roses, I just give her new dick
She let me beat, I make her sing and sound like I produced it
Who you got me confused with? Yeah, I'm on my new shit
My two thousand and ten flow sound like three thousand and two shit
No need to introduce it, your bitch know bout that Zero
I let her blow my whistle and she let me shoot a free throw
Bitches like to meet Los in V.I.P and be close
I tell ‘em it's all gravy baby, chicken, rice and meatloaf
Plush colored Chevy drop, seats look like weed smoke
Ocean blue watch bezel, face look like a speed boat
Better have my C-Notes, bitch if you don't pay me
I'm Sha-nay-nay with that chopper, have folks screaming you so crazy

Freak me like Adina said, fuck me good, suck me great
Pin me to the bed, take this to the head and suffocate
Grab her chin, fuck her face, never show a slut respect

I'm on the come up they don't like how that sound
But I been killing rappers
Why you think they underground
Kids about to have posters torn down
Replaced by pictures of Em with me sneaking up in the background
Restart, Reboot, Sharper than a shark tooth
Spit flame, Spark Puke, Great White part two
It's not difficult
Trust me it's easy
Girls blow
Why you think they called breezies
Back stage Tom Petty-ing that super mary
Girls outside the door like secretary
I heard em utter my name talking so dairy
Say he extra cold like the 29th of February
It never vary
Extra long no leap year
Know I got beauty with me probably cause the beast here
Snitches know I wouldn't snitch I'd rather need air
Wouldn't cry wolf even during a sheep scare
Why you fucking with me man
Its just absurd to see you ain't heard the word'd be
The ones that's talking the most certainly ain't never said a word to me
And inside like Burglary

""What you mean, babygirl? I got homes!""
Different cribs, new whips
And I'm feelin fly, fly like a G6
Fly, my swag hit on ladies unknowingly
Pleased to meet ya, its a pleasure knowing me
Back when I was poor I used to pull em with my poetry
Tick that yes or no for me, I guarantee she go with me
But the only thing I need to know right now's
What a pretty girl like you doing in this part of town
With a city girl swag and a country girl smile
I mean, you demoralizing bitches with your style
Wow, well how about now?
My jewelry so loud, my girls so wow
I mean, I mean swag so loud
I guess thats the reason all the concerts sell out

Sometimes we try to find the road to the riches
Need roadside assistance
Blisters on my knees, from beggin' for forgiveness
Ain't no dollars on my trees, but mileage on my feet
'Cause I been climbin' to the peak, and runnin' from the bullshit
I'm tired of playin' the same song, who told the DJ bring it back?
Dead Presidents, bullet in Abraham Lincoln hat
Starin' at big poster, I swear that he be winkin' back
Cut school, sell crack, sorry I'm just thinkin' back
Call me crazy, I've been called worse
It's like I have it all, but what's it all worth?
Ha ha, I'm probably better in my afterlife
I should cherish life, but this just ain't paradise

The weekends, man, the Stan Smith Adidas and the Campus
Or playin' guts on the cruise, Hermès boat shoes
The Izod bucket on, I'm so old-school
Yellow wrist watch, Gucci flip flops
Six top model chicks, who is this hot?
J-A, ladies, help me say it now
Y-Z, mami, why you playin' with me?
Ride with me, get high as me
It's how it's supposed to be when you rollin' with G's, Hov
Back up in this bitch like woah
Jigga get this whole shit jumpin' like six-fours
[Chorus]
(Hov), V is I, and I am him
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga)
Slim with the tilted brim on twenty-inch rims
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga)
And if y'all got love for me, I got love for y'all
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga)
And if y'all go to war for me, I go to war with y'all
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga)

[Verse 2]
Hov, and so I breeze through, jeans is Evisu
She's respondin', top is C. Ronson
We in Luan (Woo), gettin' our groove on
Buyin' out the bar, on our way to Spa'
She never seen a hundred on the wrist before
Never seen twenty-twos on the six before
I am killin' 'em out there, they needin' first aid
'Cause the boy got more sixes than first grade
The crib got killer views and square feet
You have to film MTV Cribs for a week
So sleep if you need to, mami, I will leave you
Right where you stand, nah, I don't wanna dance (I'm good)
I just wanna see what's in your Frankie B pants
Waist is low enough to let your waist show
Top like a rock star, I got a fast car
We can cruise the city doin' a buck-sixty
[Chorus]
(Hov), V is I, and I am him
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga)
Slim with the tilted brim on twenty-inch rims
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga)
And if y'all got love for me, I got love for y'all
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga)
And if y'all go to war for me, I go to war with y'all
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga)

[Verse 3]
He did it again, haters no like
But they gotta fuck with it, 'cause the flow's so tight
Gnarly, dude, I puff Bob Marley, dude
All day like Rastafaris do
Now I'm stuck to the point I could hardly move
You fuckin' up my high, don't bother me, dude
But Red Rover, send your hoes over
She can do whatever, sip somethin' with soda
She can leave whenever, sip somethin' with Hova
We can play however, slay bed or sofa
And the prognosis, sex is explosive
Left her with wet bedsheets, nigga, I'm focused

[Chorus]
(Hov), V is I, and I am him
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga)
Slim with the tilted brim on twenty-inch rims
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga)
And if y'all got love for me, I got love for y'all
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga)
And if y'all go to war for me, I go to war with y'all

A nigga been focused since I said hi to thirty (What up?)
Young niggas, y'all can't hurt me

Now run along with your little-ass hits
Read my rap sheet, nigga, three classics
Shut your bumba', I got A-Rod numbers
All you muddaskunks get buried in the trunk
When I blast the pump, I leave you relaxed
In the hospital, lookin' at M*A*S*H for months
Then I dumps dough on the D.A. desk
And I flee scot-free and pee-pee on the steps

Justify My Thug,JAY-Z,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by DJ Quik]

[Intro: JAY-Z]
Uhh, this feel right right here, Quik
It's like it's supposed to happen this one right here
Young! God damn
Let me justify my thug on this one right here

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
It goes one o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, Roc
Five six seven o'clock, eight o'clock, Roc
11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, the party 'bout to pop
Then, Roc-A-Fella y'all, it's your boy S. Dot
And I ain't never been to jail; I ain't never pay a nigga
To do no dirt for me I was scared to do myself
I will never tell, even if it means sittin' in a cell
I ain't never ran, never will
I ain't never been smacked; a nigga better keep his hands
To himself or get clapped for what's under that man's belt
I never asked for nothin' I don't demand of myself
Honesty, loyalty, friends and then wealth
Death before dishonor and I tell you what else
I tighten my belt 'fore I beg for help
Foolish pride is what held me together through the years
I wasn't felt which is why I ain't never played myself
I just play the hand I'm dealt, I can't say I've never knelt
Before God and asked for better cards at times to no avail
But I never sat back feelin' sorry for myself
If you don't give me heaven I'll raise hell
'Til it's heaven
[Chorus: Sharlotte Gibson]
Justify my thug for you
My thug (hoping)
My thug (praying) for you
To justify my thug
My thug (hoping)
My thug (praying) for you
For you

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Now if you shoot my dog, I'ma kill yo' cat
Just the unwritten laws in rap, know that
For every action there's a reaction, don't have me relapsin'
Relaxin's what I'm about, but about mine
Don't be actin like you can't see street action
Take me back to Reasonable Doubt time
You see my mind's on the finish line, facin' the wreck
I put my muh'fuckin' faith in the TEC, tell Satan not yet
You understand I am chasin' my breath
I am narrowly escapin' my death, oh yes
I am the Michael Schumacher of the Roc roster
Travellin' Mach 5, barrel in my apparel can stop God
God forgive me but I can't let them deliver me to you
Until, I won this race, then eventually
My engine gon' burn out, I get whatever is meant for me
However it turns out fine, red line!
[Chorus: Sharlotte Gibson]
Justify my thug for you
My thug (hoping)
My thug (praying) for you
To justify my thug
My thug (hoping)
My thug (praying) for you
For you

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
They say an eye for an eye, we both lose our sight
And two wrongs don't make a right
But when you been wronged and you know all along that it's just one life
At what point does one fight? (Good question, right?)
'Fore you knock the war, try to put your dogs in his
Ten-and-a-halfs, for a minute-and-a-half
Bet that stops all the grinnin' and the laughs
When you play the game of life and the win ain't in the bag
When your options is none and the pen is all you have
Or the block, niggas standin' tight as lemons on the ave
Tryin' to cop a shop - call theyself cleansin' in the cash
But can't put they name on paper 'cause, then you on blast
Mr. President, there's drugs in our residence
Tell me what you want me to do, come break bread with us
Mr. Governor, I swear there's a cover up
Every other corner there's a liquor store, fuck is up?

Justify my thug for you
My thug (hoping)

As I Flow On,Grand Daddy I.U.,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","(It's time for the U to flow again)
(On and on and on and on) --] Grand Puba

As I flow on, I get a mellow mood set
And you ain't heard a MC this smooth yet
So act like you know
Lay back, pump the track and watch the mack flow
And yo, I always give you something dope to swing to
Lyrics I bring you, sing to and cling to
So pass the mic, let the U flow steadily
That means a ( ? ) combined with a melody
My vocal tone is smooth, just like Barry White
I don't bite, but Tom, Dick or Harry might
They always usin wack tracks and strange lines
Fiendin to find a smooth way I arrange mines
But it's all in your brain
So I maintain while I left the remains unexplained
You thought the U fell off, hey yo, brother, you're wrong
Sit back and take notes as I flow on

Let the U flow on
(Flow on, flow on)
Yo, check the flow, you gots to know there's none smoother
The real mack is back with a dope stack manoeuvre
What I provide's bonafide, sheer artistry
Now who can take r&b and make it as hard as me?
No sap who rap achieved such a slick task
Crabs try to last, get that [edited] blast quick fast
Cause this ain't soft, watered down or diluted
U's undisputed, gift swift when I shoot it
So erase your thoughts, I ain't about sellin out
To me pop is chop, and I don't give a hell about
The media, press, whoever don't like it
Rhymes hype, just give me a mic and I strike it
Eff crossin over, I stay on the real side
Some guys in the field tried, but then the appeal died
So I sticks to this and stays in my own yard
Track is r&b, vocals are bonehard
Search the words, nothin soft in the contents
And none of that 'Baby, I love you' nonsense
Straight up hard rhymes, down to the last verse
Chumps pop junk, but my pump always blasts first
I bust caps while saps take naps
There's no haps, I write raps that burn like claps
Thought the U fell off, hey yo, brother, you're wrong
Sit back and take notes as I flow on

Let the U flow on
(Flow on, flow on)
(It's time for the U to flow again)
(On and on and on and on) --] Grand Puba

I make suckers look soft as whipped cream
And play low pro' while the hoes on my tip scream
So brothers ask how it's done, but actually
Bein swift is a gift that come naturally
So you can break your neck tryin to imitate
But weak rap acts on a track don't stimulate
There's only one Daddy U (Daddy U) (Daddy U)
They don't believe me, I ain't the brother to step to
Come with your all and the U's still standin tall
In a brawl I'm hittin harder than a canonball
With Kay Cee on the mix
Stickin the chicks, vics, and droppin like tons of bricks
So bring on the army and send for the coast guard
And still get scarred cause the U's hittin most hard
You suckers ain't sayin nothin
So I'ma wet up your whole set and let the Kay keep cuttin
And stack packs on tracks on wax, here's the facts
I chop new jacks and so-called macks like a axe
You thought the U fell off, well yo, brother, you're wrong
Sit back and take notes as I flow on

Let the U flow on
(Flow on, flow on)

Blast a New Asshole,Grand Daddy I.U.,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[ Verse 1: Grand Daddy I.U. ]
Yo, I'm terrorizin the slums
Beatin niggas like drums for large sums
As five-o comes, I fill they ass full of dum-dums
So play the rear or get blown back
The U's a stone mack, I'm burnin your chest like cognac
I feel no remorse, the boss is blood-thirsty
Laughin while you punk niggas beggin for mercy
Don't even waste your breath, just face your death
I kill off crews with no clues or traces left
All you find left behind is a death sign
And 12 dead niggas hit up from the Tec-9
My brain is diseased with tendencies of homicide
Last punk who tried to bring the drama, his mama died
I got a plan to kill the motherfucking pope
And send his body parts back to God in an envelope
Niggas say when you sin you got to pay
But I don't give a fuck, cause I'm goin to hell anyway
Wet shit like Machine Gun Kelly
I blow a nigga guts straight out his motherfucking belly
As I carry the hit out, watch the Tec spit out
2 in your fucking chest, blowin your whole shit out
The one in your head tearin your brain out the case
At point blank range rippin the veins out your face
I laugh and leave your ass layin dead
With big-ass chunks of meat hangin out your motherfucking head
Punk
[ Chorus ]
There's no time to waste
Gotta go, get the cash flow
Bitch niggas fuck around
Make me blast a new asshole

[ Verse 2: Big Snow ]
Yo, take all caution, cause Big Snow's known for extortion
I take what I want, and what I want is large portions
So cough up your money and your jewels
Your shirt and your shoes, punk motherfucker, you know the rules
I take mine at just one glance at the waistline
Niggas be wishin they heard my name through the grapevine
Face to face, hesitation is unknown
Once spotted, you're lookin down the barrel of my chrome
(Yo Snow, leave that alone) Nigga please
Cause if a nigga sneeze I'm blowin his ass into smithereens
No time for talk or walkin around
Lay that ass on the ground
Cause that's the way it's goin down
Cause in this day and age a nigga gotta pay his dues
God bless the fools if a nigga refuse
Cause I chose either life or death
And even Jesus Christ paid the price cause ain't no disciples left
No exception, protection's the way
No discrimination, cause even mama duke got to pay
I'm playin you for keeps, so we will live in a torture
Will cost ya, from Big Snow, the Steady Flow enforcer
[ Chorus ]

[ Verse 3: Kid Capri ]
Ease off, you bitch niggas, please get off my back
It's the number one Kid, Tape Master mack
And bitch niggas that step up, they gettin wet up
Head up, I'm fed up with the fake nigga set-up
It's easy to die, fuck around and you will
Quicker that you ever thought you would, for real
I come thick like a shake, bitch, don't forget
Step to niggas real quick, cause I ain't scared of shit
So test this, I leave your fucking face in messes
Then snatch your fuckin' hoochie and I tickle her breastes
A five day blow-out all up her ass
She'll be missin for a while cause that ass wouldn't last
To beat her punk man up, so bad he couldn't stand up
I woulda did it sooner, but he ran when I ran up
I'm stompin through the '90s with my 94 Timbs
Rollin in a Benz with the chrome-dipped rims
And niggas wanna talk shit, fuck the whole congregation
I'm number one, so there's no need for aggravation
Let it be known, Kid Capri is on
Tell a friend on your motherfucking telephone

[ Chorus ]
[ Verse 4: Taheim ]
I put rappers into trauma from my microphone drama
I'm new on the block, but got the skill of an oldtimer
My posse deep, niggas sleep and catch mad rounds
Homicide call my crew the Black Bloodhounds
The wick-wack step back or catch a mack slap
Tryin my hands, pussy cat get your skull cracked
I never fronted, never stunted, never will, paw
I rip rhymes so fucking bad they made a mic law
But what the fuck, I'm still buckin diesel like a truck
I'm slidin skins across my sheets just like a hockey puck
So wanna-be-me's try to see me, but I'm too outrageous
On the d-l, shit I do be makin frontpages
The black sheep, I'm in deep like it's a life thing
Cause since I was born, goddammit, I was ghetto-trained
Matter of fact, check this track and tell me what you found
Big Taheim is beatin pussy motherfuckers down"

Know you 'preciate it, baby, lingerie La Perla lacing

There never was a city kid truer and bluer
There's more to me than you'll ever know
And I got more hits than Sadaharu Oh
Tom Thumb, Tom Cushman, or Tom Foolery
Date women on TV with the help of Chuck Woolery
Words flowin' out just like the Grand Canyon
And I'm always out lookin' for a female companion
I threw the lasso around the tallest one and dragged her to the crib
I took off her moccasins and put on the bib
Wheelin' and dealin', I make a little bit of a stealin'
I'll bring you back to the place and your dress I'm peelin'
Your body's on time and your mind is appealin'
Starin' at the cracks up there up on the ceilin'
Such and such will be the bass that I'm throwin'
I'm talking to a girl, telling her I'm all-knowing
Well, she's talking to the kid (""Who?"" to the kid)
I'm telling her every lie that you know that I never did

Hey ladies, get funky
All the ladies in the house
The ladies, the ladies

Well, me in the corner with a good-lookin' daughter
I dropped my drawers and said, ""Welcome back Kotter""
We was cuttin' up the rug, she started cuttin' up the carpet
In my apartment, I begged her please stop it
The gift of gab is the gift that I have
And that girl ain't nothin' but a crab
Educated: no, stupid: yep
And when I say stupid, I mean stupid fresh
I'm not James At 15 or Chachi in charge
I'm Adam, and I'm adamant about livin' large
With the white Sassoons and the looks that kill
Makin' love in the back of my Coupe De Ville
I met a little cutie, she was all hopped up on zootie
I liked the little cutie, but I kicked her in the booty
Cause I don't kinda go for that messin' around
You be listenin' to my records', a number one sound
Step, step to the rhythm, step, step to the rhyme
I've got an open mind so why don't you all get inside
Tune in, turn on, to my tune that's live
Ladies flock like bees to a hive

Hey ladies, get funky
Hey, hey, hey, hey, ladies

Hey, hey, hey, hey, ladies
One more time, ain't it funky now
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, ladies
Ain't it funky now (You know that)
[Verse 3]
She's got a gold tooth, you know she's hardcore
She'll show you a good time, then she'll show you the door
Break up with your girl, it ended in tears
Vincent van Gogh, go and mail that ear
I call her in the middle of the night when I'm drinkin'
The phone booth on the corner is damp, and it's stinkin'
She said come on over, it was me that she missed
I threw that trash can through her window 'cause you know I got dissed
Your old lady left you, and you went insane
You blew yourself up in the back of the 6 Train
Well, take my advice at any price
A gorilla like your mother is mighty weak, man
Suckin' down pints 'til I didn't know
Woke up in the morning with the Won Ton Ho
'Cause I announce, I like girls that bounce
With the weight that pays about a pound per ounce
Girls with curls, and big long locks
And beatnik chicks, just wearing their smocks
Walkin' high and mighty like she's number one
She thinks she's the passionate one

[Chorus]
Hey ladies, get funky
What's that?
Good god
Good god, dance
Good god

I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie

[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah yeah
[Verse 3]
It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love, the city, she loves me
Lonely as I am together we cry

[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way

Yeah, yeah yeah
Oh, no, no, no, yeah yeah
Love me, I say, yeah yeah

Under the bridge downtown
Is where I drew some blood
Under the bridge downtown
I could not get enough
Under the bridge downtown
Forgot about my love
Under the bridge downtown
I gave my life away, yeah
Yeah yeah
Oh, no, no no no, yeah yeah
Oh no, I said oh, yeah yeah
Here I stay"
Californication,Red Hot Chili Peppers,"['rock', 'alternative', 'r&b', 'blues', 'jazz', 'hip hop', 'pop', 'metal']","[Verse 1]
Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
And little girls from Sweden dream of silver-screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication

[Verse 2]
It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the East, at least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin: is this your chin or is that war you're waging?

Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication

[Verse 4]
Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station?
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication

Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Well, everybody's been there, and I don't mean on vacation

And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration

Yeah, One Enterprises, Viper Records
Presents Akir, Immortal Technique
And this is ""Treason,"" bitch! Uhh

[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
I'm not down with the conscious rap, or the Sambos
My flow is cancerous milk, like Monsanto's
Sold through the hood in a package of murder
I'm like white people, get fired and back with a burner
Gauge 5 semi, with the infrared beams
So fuck the Ku Klux and the Combat-18
I put bullets in your spleen, sendin' you to the grave
And through all that, a mothafucker still get paid
And ‘cause of that, some niggas can't stand me, man
But that's the curse of the slave, like Candyman
House niggas that traded they soul to get ahead (jiggaboo!)
And then fucked over for placin' they faith in the feds (Snitch!)
So while the government talk about a mission to Mars
They leave the hood, stuck in a position to starve
Capitalism's a religion that makes Satan a god
And teaches self-righteous people to embrace a facade
{*DP One scratches*: ""Say what?""}

[Hook: Akir + Immortal Technique]
It's a cut-throat business the way that we live
Born in the hood, tryin' to see a better life for the kids
It ain't wrong to make money, legit or illegal
But it's treason when you turn your back on your people

{*DP One scratches*: ""Say what?""}

[Verse 2: Akir]
Yo, yo, they be manipulatin', politicians delegatin'
Task of perpetratin', sounds like Satan
Makin' racist statements of abomination
Niggas pray to somethin' sacred
Waitin' for that force to save 'em, instead of savin'
Movin' destinations, property papers
Waitin on your 40 acres, 'til you old and ancient
Swole or achin' while the hole is gapin'
To cake to make your way in, I pray to God
But all the amen's in the world'll never make your aim win
Famous celebrities could fall off like leprosy, they tellin' me
So I pay attention, fuck the envy and the jealousy
Y'all niggas could save, Akir's a latest rave
Saw me chillin' on The Source page, fanbases span race
Complete with shorties that blaze, be revered in my old age
From rippin' the stage, and even then from above when I wave
Throwin' flowers on my grave, burnin' sage
Saying, ""Thanks, Abe, who made ways for freein' the slaves.""
[Hook: Akir + Immortal Technique]
It's a cut-throat business the way that we live
Born in the hood, tryin' to see a better life for the kids
It ain't wrong to make money, legit or illegal
But it's treason when you turn your back on your people

[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]
Immortal Technique, Indian chief, Lord Sovereign
Bear claw necklace and the puma moccasins
Legal money, motherfucker, you could bring the coppers in
‘Cause I'ma take a shit on 'em, without Johnny Coch-a-ran
Spittin' Prometheus fire, when I speak to a liar
I'm the last of the Essenes that'll teach a messiah
Rip your heart out with the technique of a Maya
‘Cause only snitches and Kanye speak through a wire

[Verse 4: Akir]
Freshest attire, speak with desire, close to the passion
I fall from Elijah, size up the evilest liars
Who think they conspire
Music qualify as paranoia, mental occupiers
Tight, like a pair of pliers, brain's fried up
And so I aspire to erase the pride, usin' amplifiers
To inspire my people, we should hire
Like a lion fightin' vampires, tired on his way to Zion
Never expire, only retire when they call me Sire
[Hook: Immortal Technique + Akir]
It's a cut-throat business the way that we live
Born in the hood, tryin' to see a better life for the kids

Anytime, anyplace, anyway

But this girl worth the gossip

The tattoos now, forever she very guardless

Ain't nothing wrong bringing the old me back
Little mamma knows my body so trophy glass
She worth it, bring me some Chloe bags
Like damn, can I be yo' police badge?
Pull it up, get a little cozy and
Woman is sort'a like a oldie jam
Record some shh on a playboy cam

But still she's got fanatics

Look for me!
Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway
Doin' what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
‘Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B holla
[Chorus: JAY-Z & Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin'
If ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh, no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh, no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect
Nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' that Hermès Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens
Six hundred drops, hercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep
[Chorus: JAY-Z & Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

[Verse 3: Beyoncé (and Jay-Z)]
(Talk to 'em, B!) If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me (That’s right!)
Yeah-hee (Break it down for 'em, B!)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend (One more time!)
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend

[Chorus: JAY-Z & Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I'm Tyler, Mr. Green Hat
Pro-abortion, anti-clean rap
Fuck your blog opinion and your feedback
My self-respect I leave that, in the lost and found
Where the black girls get their weaves back
Awesome I achieve that mini, blasting ""You're a jerk""
In some fucking yellow skinnies looking like a fucking faggot
Bouncing 'round the house trying to find an easy way to rape Minnie
Bet you thirty dollars you find her like Cartman found Kenny, dead
I like my girls smart, skinny
Kinda pop tart, when I bite into them red
I'm a self-racist, you should tape this, ask Sarah, I'm the rapist
I'm a fascist, fuck fashion, Gucci belts is for them faggots
My hat is by Jabbia, and if you got a fucking problem
With the future, you can get a death wish just like Atiba
Fuck the biz apparent, Odd Future errant
I'm watching the Berrics getting head from someone's parent
A lot of fucking hate inside my heart, guaranteed
That I'm sharing in the force with the cyclops staring
I'm flying on a beaver, you're a disbeliever
So don't ask for no mothafuckin' ride when you see us
Swim right past you, the shit-list said that I'm nutty such a cashew
'Cause I jack off with dish soap and smell gas fumes
Permanent brain damage similar to tattoos
The shit, you can mention me if anybody ask you
Kill the jungle, let the cats loose
You didn't see me here if someone ask you

I want to feel her in every way
Mary Jane keeps me high like every day
Bong, vaporizer, in the sack now
Stuck in my high, afraid of heights, I'm trapped
Buy a swisher for a dollar or two blunt wraps
Roll it up and ensure that everything's fat
She ain't got time to try and relieve ya
But she'll get all in your head, Sativa

I'm good but y'all don't want me like vegetables
I'm all in front of you zeroes like decimals (woah)
Let's take them high like the decibels
So we get them high, get them high like cholesterol
In a overweight mother-lover, my tracks is filled with blubber
That's fat, who needs another producer?
Chica-Go-Getter from Odd Future, used to ride solo
'Cause I ain't really care what the rest say
Type of nigga to jerk off to his own sex tape
Best stay away when the door closed, I show up with four hoes
Best believe I'm leaving with more of those
And I got a girlfriend so I'm a keep lying til the verse end, FIN

We grind, these niggas asking for some promo
We sit back, observe, stacking hella box logos
Square circle jerks starting O.F. moshpit
Preaching to the poets, I'm an O.F. prophet
No less profit, fiened when we drop shit
Convertible coupe, bitches scream when they tops split
It's that crack, give you something to sell
Put these bitches on lock down, something like jail
Thought she hot I swear, probably rougher than hell
And she ain't gay, but the only thing she like is fucking Chanel
Light skinned women, all sex everything
Think we can fit ten in, bowls packed with everything
Everything that we call flight, living life
This is everything that they call hype
I'm everything that they call nice
She in colors and shit, she off that northern lights, right
Intimidated by niggas you can't be
I'm a G, and this is something you can't see
Top ranked, number one my son
And she looking for them trees, baby we got some
And stay focused on the women and you get less done
It's ironic cause I always hear you talking about one

Come home and still blow cats for me
Pump crack, stabbing all them hoodrat shorties
A live gunslinger well known, born to dance
When the heat is on, Stapleton days, shot himself in the groin
The gun went off, it looked like a flick
When he fell to the floor, holding his nuts, screaming ""God damnit
Shit I put one in my balls, what the fuck y'all looking at me for?
Call the police, do something
Motherfuckers standing around, watch when I get better
All hell's gonna be terror
Death to you, you,"" he pointed at Red

Instead of fussin’ and flippin’ out
I did my thing and figured it out
Security trippin' I ain’t puttin' it out

Can you drip, drip, drip
Drip drip, drip, drip for me mami
Can you drip, drip, drip"
London Tour Freestyle,Drake,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Man, fuck it I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at the strip club
Uh, uh, fuck it I was wrong though
Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it’s six figures when they tax me
Oh well, guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout to all my Asian girls, Dim Sum
Shots came I don’t know where they descend from
Probably some bad hoes, I’m 'bout to take your hemp from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you ain't the only the real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy, but I’m just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking about me going platinum in a year again
Don’t I got that shit the world, wanna hear again?
Don’t Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows just bore me, paint drying
I’m never tripping over anything that ain't mine
I’m hearing the shit that you say through the grape vine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
It’s been that way from the beginning
I just been playing I didn't notice I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
And the kids wearing crowns over here and everything is alright"
Tribes at War,Nas & Damian Marley,"['hip hop', 'blues', 'jazz', 'r&b', 'pop']","[Refrain: Damian Marley]
Tribal war, we nah want no more a dat
Every man deserve to earn
And every child deserve to learn, now
Tribal war, a nuh dat we a defend
Every man deserve a turn like a flame deserve to burn
Tribal war, a nuh dat we a defend
Each and every man deserve to earn
And every child deserve to learn
Tribal war, a nuh dat we a defend
Every man deserve a turn, like Babylon deserve to burn

[Verse 1: Nas]
Man what happened to us?
Geographically they moved us from Africa
We was once happiness-pursuers
Now we back stabbing, combative and abusive
The African and Arab go at it they most Muslim
Used to be moving in unison, disputes would end
Bounty hunters and grape street get cool again
Sub-standard housing, got the young running rampant
Wilding, for a Phantom he can style in
Mask on his face, grabbing his Ruger
Saying nobody move or I'll shoot you
Man you're expiring, catch 25 and he does it like a man
He sides with black, white pride and Mexican
Survive the best he can, strap a shank to his thigh
Why do we all collide? Why do the young die?
Extortion, murder and burglary, tattoos his chest
Says his enemies don't deserve to breathe
[Refrain: Damian Marley]
Tribal war, we nah want no more a dat
Every man deserve to earn
And every child deserve to learn, now
Tribal war, a nuh dat we a defend

Every man deserve a turn
And every child deserve to learn
Tribal war, a nuh dat we a defend
Every man deserve a turn, like Babylon deserve to burn

[Verse 2: K'Naan]
I drink poison then I vomit diamonds
I gave you Mandela, black Dalai Lamas
I gave you music, you enthused in my kindness
So how dare you reduce me to Donny Imus
Timeless in case we never been acquainted
Flyness who made it, it gets duplicated
Mindless violence, well let me try to paint it
Here's the 5 steps in hopes to explain it
ONE: It's me and my nation against the world
TWO: Then me and my clan against the nation
THREE: Then me and my fam' against the clan
FOUR: Then me and my brother we no hesitation, uh
Go against the fam' until they cave in
FIVE: Now who's left in this deadly equation?
That's right, it's me against my brother
Then we point a Kalashnikov and kill one another
[Refrain: Damian Marley]
Tribal war, we nah want no more a dat

[Verse 3: Damian Marley]
Man a war tribal over colors
Over money, over land, and over oil, and over god
And over idols, and even lovers
Over breakfast, over dinner, over suppers
Over jungle, over rema, over buckers
Over Brooklyn, over Queens, and over Rutgers
Over red, and over blue, and over chuckers
Over red and over blue and under covers
Tribal trouble, the drive-bys double
Cause the youth dem nah go war and go fight with knuckle
The two sides scuffle
Vietnam nah go a war with no more kung fu nun chuckle
Missile and shuttle
And the Queen of England and Uncle Sam
Dem a flex dem muscle
The tribal hustle, blood diamond puddle, survival struggle"

But hey, pretty girl, I'm feelin' you
The way you do the things you do
Reminds me of my Lexus coupe

Mac-10, 32-shot clip in my snorkel (Uh-huh)
I might smile and say, ""What's up?"" but I don't fuck with you niggas
My rap money slow up, I'll run up on you niggas (Woo)
I'm on the edge, I'm just waiting on a nigga to push me
Put my hand on my strap—what you looking at, pussy?
We ain't buddies, we ain't partners and we damn sure ain't friends
So much chrome on my Benz, you see your face in my rims
If your bitch wanna roll, I'ma let her get in
I don't play, but I'm a playa 'til the motherfucking end

Backseat of my Jeep, fuck 'til I fuck up her makeup (Uh-huh)
Take her to the Diamond District, introduce her to Jacob (Woo)
Tell her if she like me, she should keep me icy
My game fuck with a bitch brain 'til she think she wifey (Yeah)
Spent her life savings in a day, 'cause she likes me
Committment from me, uhh... nah, not likely
Went out Vivica, I thought I was onto something

Look into the windows of my soul, the eyes never lie (Uh-huh)
They blood shot red, it's ganja in my system, I'm high
First it's pain when you lust for love; then, it's smooth and calm
Feel the rush, like a needle's in your arm (Uh-huh)
It's a cold world, baby girl, loving me is not enough
Find out when you fucking broke, love won't get you on the bus (Yeah)
Man, you should see the pretty bitches that be sexing me
They suck cock; to make 'em hot, I just let 'em stand next to me (Woo)
Hundred percent thug, freak, too, I'll taste your love

Better known as the Yin and the Yang, the True Master
Isham, DJ Skane, the True Robocop comin' through
Scientific Shabazz, my motherfuckin' man Wise the Civilized
The Shaolin Soldiers, Daddy-O and Popa Ron
Comin' down from the motherfuckin' South end of things
Killa Beez all over your fuckin' planet
Thirty-six chambers of death
Three-hundred and sixty degrees of perfected styles
Choppin' off your motherfuckin' dome

The Wu is comin' through, the outcome is critical
Fuckin' with my style is sort of like a miracle
On 34th Street, in the Square of Herald
I gamed Ella, the bitch caught a Fitz like Gerald-
-ine Ferraro, who's full of sorrow
'Cause the ho didn't win, but the sun will still come out tomorrow
And shine shine shine like gold mine
Here comes the drunk monk, with a quart of Ballantine
Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone!
Let's get on this mission like Indiana Jones
The GZA, one who just represent the Wu-Tang clique
With the game and soul of an old school flick
Like the Mack and Dolemite, who both did bids
Claudine went to Cooley High and had mad kids
So stop, the life you save may be your motherfuckin' own
I'll hang your ass with this microphone
Make way for the merge of traffic
Wu-Tang's comin' through with full metal jackets
God squad that's mad hard to serve
Come frontin' hard, then Bernhard Goetz what he deserves

Clan in da front, let your feet stomp

No response while I bomb that ass
You ain't shit, your wack-ass town had you gassed
Egos is somethin' the Wu-Tang crush
Souped-up niggas on a stage get rushed
I don't give a goddamn on the shows you did
How many rhymes you got or who knows you, kid
'Cause I don't know you, therefore show me what you know
I come sharp as a blade and I cut you slow
You become so Pat as my style increases
What's that in your pants? Ahh, human feces!
Throw your shitty drawers in the hamper
Next time, come strapped with a fuckin' Pamper
How you sound, B? You're better off a quitter
I'm on the mound, G, and it's a no-hitter
And my DJ, the catcher, he's my man
In a way he's the one who devised the plan
He throws the signs, I hook up the beats with clout
I throw the rhymes to the mic and I strike 'em out
So it really doesn't matter on how you intrigue
You can't fuck with those in the major leagues

Say a prayer for me
Stay in the air for me
You say you care for me and you're staying there for me
In the air, I will be there shortly
Every prayer is my airport and tears are the leer for me
The golden sun glares for me
Somewhere for me someone stares for me
Just zones out seeing nothing but the thoughts I project
Lost in my steps such tears are hard to bear for me
But as I walk the Led Zepplin paved steps
My destination may take your breath away yes
Keep your balance don't [fall from heaven]
Though it's a long walk it ain't far from [heaven]
Angels are the stars
I'm Batman in the dark night
'cuz that man has to stand with his dark plight
But a pink blur C-H illuminates the sky
Using the stars, connect the dots
My heart's right
[Hook]
If I could be a fly on the wall
To hear what you really think about me
I wouldn't be flying at all
Believe what you believe about me
I just live how I live
Forget how I live
My angels come back and hold me down
Then my angels come back and lift me up
And remind me that I do deserve the crown

[Verse 2]
This ain't a love song
This is my way of saying what's wrong
With people who believe that all the love's gone
People would rather greenback so much that their heart is black
Romance is something for them to scream
But that ain't what the issue is
Even angels fear love when they don't know what their mission is
I wonder if God has to tell 'em to chill
Cause they'd still be in heaven even if they were never revealed
If at one point you'd end up falling
You wouldn't even be the one that God would be calling
Fall is for Autumn
The season changed
Replenished but finished like Autumn leaves and rain
Some would repeat the degrees of pain
While the rest just spring from pain
To receive the wings of fame
So chill like the season ignored
Freezing for sure cause we don't wanna grieve anymore
[Hook]
If I could be a fly on the wall
To hear what you really think about me
I wouldn't be flying at all
Believe what you believe about me
I just live how I live
Forget how I live
My angels come back and hold me down
Then my angels come back and lift me up
And remind me that I do deserve the crown

[Verse 3]
Angels have free will too
They not God's yes people
Forced to say ""You got it will do!""
They can defy but they know their lives
Is a sure-fire way to fall away from the sky
So as real as I am in my songs
I am a man that can stand to say damn it I'm wrong
It's being real
People feel I need to chill
Burn some weed drink some tea
And have some pizza, still
I sit still
Not me, I mean the word ""still""
On an earthquake, see how the world feels
And when it comes back speechless
I will ask you to tell me every last one of your secrets
I reach in my soul to fight my inner insecurities
And we both get strong with each beating
Putting together all the pieces, believe it
I don't want eternal happiness, I need it
[Hook]
If I could be a fly on the wall
To hear what you really think about me
I wouldn't be flying at all
Believe what you believe about me
I just live how I live
Forget how I live

Then my angels come back and lift me up
And remind me that I do deserve the crown"

Fusion of the five elements, to search for the higher intelligence
Women walk around celibate, livin' irrelevant
The most benevolent king, communicatin' through your dreams
Mental pictures been painted, Allah's heard and seen
Everywhere, throughout your surrounding atmosphere
Troposphere, thermosphere, stratosphere
Can you imagine from one single idea, everything appeared here
Understanding makes my truth, crystal clear
Innocent black immigrants locked in housing tenements
Eighty-Five percent tenants dependent welfare recipients
Stapleton's been stamped as a concentration camp
At night I walk through, third eye as bright as a street lamp
Electric microbes, robotic probes
Takin' telescope pictures of globe
Babies gettin' pierced with microchips stuffed inside they earlobes
Then examinated, blood contaminated
Vaccinated, lives fabricated
Exaggerated authorization, Food and Drug Administration
Testin' poison in prison population
My occupation to stop the inauguration of Satan
Some claim that it was Reagan, so I come to slay men
Like Bartholomew, 'cause every particle is physical article
Was diabolical to the last visible molecule
A spaceknight like Rom, consume planets like Unicron
Blasting photon bombs from the arm like Galvatron

United Nations, gun bias style patient
Formulating rap plural a capella occupation
Conquer land like Napoleon, military bomb fest
We want sanitary food, planetary conquest
Thug peoples on some hardco' body shit
Get your shit together 'fore the fuck Illuminati hit
Dreams is free and escape is sleep
For a fool peep jewels, keep tools for tough time
The rule of rough mind, elevate, stay behind
The sun gotta shine, keep on, cremate
The whole Babylon, times up, move on
Kings on your pawn, checkmate, no fakes
Supposed through the gate, case closed things get froze
When it comes time, chosen ones will hold the guns
We take flight with no fright
And attack, never fear 'cause our words is clear
What's been done can't be undone, son, we can't care
'Cause the last days and times are surely here
Snakes and flakes get blown, by the righteous ones
Divine minds bind, we unified as one
Half of black folk, we half broke, smoke a bowl of weed shit
Our everlastin' essence stay flyin' over Egypt

With his last bit of energy left, told me rock it with respect
I opened it, seen the God holdin' his kids
Photogenic, tears just burst out my wig
Plus he dropped one
Oh shit, here come his Old Earth with no shoes on
Screamin', holdin' her breasts with a gown on
She fell and then lightly touched his jaw, kissed him
Rubbed his hair, turned around, the ambulance was there
Plus the blue coats, Officer Lough, took it as a joke
Weeks ago he strip-searched the God and gave him back his coke
Bitches yellin', Beenie Man swung on Helen
In the back of a cop car, Dirty Tasha tellin'
But suddenly, a chill came through, it was weird
Felt like my man, was cast out my heaven now we share
Laid on the stretcher, blood on his Wally's like ketchup
Deep like the Paul assassination with a sketch of it
It can't be, from Yoo-hoo to Lee's
Second grade humped the teachers, about to leave
Finally, this closed chapter comes to an end
He was announced, pronounced dead, y'all, at 12:10
[Outro: Raekwon]
Now what my man is tryin' to tell y'all
Is that across the whole globe
The murder rates is increasin', and we decreasin'
So at the same time, when you play with guns
When you play with guns, son
That causes the conflict of you goin' against your own
You hear me? So let's pay attention
Straight up and down, 'cause this is only a story
From the real"

I heard he, work hard in the therapy on the curve
On the curve he, yes, indeedy! I'm the BEST of 'Pac
I'm the BEST of Biggie, dress extra spiffy

When I'm grindin, niggas might see me as dressed a lil' bummy
Got a bag of rubberbands that wrap money like I'm wrappin mummies
(YEAH!!) Let's Google a new word for wealth in the computer
I'm friends with the guy that designs the way money looks in the future
Then I dispose of niggas in a trash bags full of losers
You think ya money big nigga, then my money's SUPER DUPER
While I'm on probation my peeps carry the rueger
Then I laugh and stash cash in pretty places like Aruba
Then I dive for deep sea treasures and take lessons of scuba
There's more money nigga step to the rear
I'm Grand Puba on arrival, your highest title, numero uno
When I stuff money in all my pockets I look bigger than sumo
Wrestlers so go freshen up, I got a towel for ya

Queens! That's where the team's form
Count money so long it got a green thumb
And my hundred shot cali got a mean drum
I rock cases of that stuff and I don't mean rum
I get alot of bread, you ain't gotta wonder
I don't make it rain, I make it thunder
After the thunder then comes the monsoon
This is real life homey not a cartoon
This is Black Hand, we run alot of blocks
I done stuffed a hundred grand in a Prada box
Trust me homey you don't wanna start this
And it's real look like Mean Marcus
It's the Prinz, I'm the one they stealin fam
Stack money from the floor to the ceilin fan
When it comes to birds, I flew alot of those
That's why the bank accounts is like a box of Cheerios

Represent,Grand Daddy I.U.,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Intro/Chorus: Lumberjack and Steady Flow

(Represent yo!) You know I represent (aight!)
(Represent yo!) Yeah, you know I represent (aight!)
(Represent yo!) I got to represent (aight!)
(Represent yo!) Daddy U represent

[Verse One: Grand Daddy I.U.]
Yo make way it's the U comin through with the one two checka
The mic wrecka rippin mad hoes with the pecker
I crush punks to rubble, chop em like stubble
Give any MC trouble, Hittin Switches like E Double
Word to father, hot just like lava
Blowin up spots like Japs did Pearl Harbor
Refuse to pay dues I use da ooze
And kill off whole crews like Hitler did Jews
Now who's next to flex, bring it on
You figure my skill's gone then you dead wrong like child porn
I'm game tight, so never take my name light
It's fright night, tearin that ass out the frame right
I flow steady like the sands in the hourglass
Droppin mad paragraph after paragraph
My staff is called Steady Flow
The Grand Daddy U, Kay Cee, Easy Rick, and Big Sno
And yo I get flam Hobbes word to grandpops
When my jam drops, you nibble my nuts like Lamb Chop
The scamp stops nevers, I demand props forever
Whatever's clever, cause I got my shit together
[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Lumberjack]
Drop your mic, shut the fuck up, and don't make a sound
It's the Lumberjack rapper choppin wack niggas down
Snappin necks with the vigor, break backs on the tracks
Got a punk nigga's blood on the blade of my axe
I tear off limbs, stompin like Tims, blendin in sendin in
Smokin punk motherfuckers like stems
Step up, act like you want it you can get it in three ways
On the mic, with the hands, or from the twelve gauge
Ready to flex on all you wannabe ruffnecks
What's next, I'm givin your girlfriend rough sex
Like Underground I Get Around
And yeah I like SWV but I ain't tryin to go Downtown
So come meet the Grim Reaper, the Crypt Keeper
Got force and just like Bo$$ I gets Deeper
I'm sick of hearing you actors on wax
Claiming you're breaking backs, you niggas is fakin jacks
I lay you dead in the ghetto streets, your head and my metal meets
You scream like steam when the kettle heats
So kid you better play the rear
Or like that five thousand dollar love seat
Your ass is Outta Here

[Chorus 2X (second time without Steady Flow)]
[Verse Three: Grand Daddy I.U.]
Aiyyo the only remains is bloodstains spilled brains and broke bones
You step in my face with the games you get smoked homes
I come out blastin, doin your whole ass in fast and
It's Daddy U the smooth assassin
My name spells defeat to punks on the street
I pack nuff heat, my rhyme flow is fatter than cellulite
I got a master plan to blast a man
Faster than niggas can plea, it's disaster and
Mayhem and havoc on the scene
You see what I mean, when I bust the sixteen in your spleen
To get the third leg hoes beg
The skills are nastier than a fart after eatin a bald egg
And yo to be quite precise I'm might nice
I got more high priced hookers than Heidi Floess
Kid you better check my rep
Or quiet as kept, you catch a hole in your neck, so watch your step

[Chorus 2X (second time without Lumberjack)]"
All Your Love,K'La,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Its hard loving someone else
When you barely got enough to love yourself
And its hard trying to ease someone's pain
When your own hurt is more than you can take

[Verse 1]
Its hard loving someone else
When you barely got enough to love yourself
And its hard trying to ease someone’s pain
When your own hurt is more than you can take

But how the hell can we be lovers
If we don’t even love each other?
If we’re down for one another
We gotta find a way to cover
Each other’s backs
Instead of tracks
I wanna make you smile
Instead of make you mad
And I won’t act like I’m all that
Cause if you left, I’d take you back
Cause I don’t care what you done done
I just know I want your love
[Hook]
So can we just smoke
Instead of arguing all the time?
I know you got a lot on your mind
And I know you think its un-lady like
But boy its been a hell of a night, so
Turn the lights down low
It’s time to let it all go
You can send your worries up to God above
So you can send me all your love

[Verse 2]
It’s hard trying to shut my mouth
Especially when all this shit keep coming out
(I don’t really mean it baby)
And its hard letting problems go
Especially when I already told you so

I gotta look over your shoulder
To make sure you do what I told ya
You swear to God that you don’t know her
But we just keep getting all over
Each other’s backs
Instead of tracks
I wanna make you smile
Instead of make you mad
But I won’t act like I’m all that
Cause if you left I’d take you back
Cause I don’t care what you done done
I just know I want your love
[Hook]
So can we just smoke
Instead of arguing all the time
I know you got a lot on your mind
And I know you think its un-lady like
But boy its been a hell of a night, so
Turn the lights down low
Its time to let it all go
You can send your worries up to God above
So you can send me all your love

[Rap]
Hard on the surface, soft on the inside
Cause inside I cry, every time you say bye
I man up and take it, but it take time
Cause whenever you’re here I feel like I’m still on the safe side
Danger, danger, he just left me hanging
Wish I could walk out of love I don’t know which I door I came in
Its such a shame man, he got me blaming/ everybody but him for the shit that he been saying
Who am I playing, that’s a changed man
And I just want to check his days out like the days inn
He got me praising, God just for his presence
And I could never give him back, I would just regret it
And I could not forget it all the shit that we been through
High school , new dudes, and a couple baby blues
I never got to choose, but I never really had to
Before they ever checked you out, I already bagged you
[Hook]
So can we just smoke
Instead of arguing all the time
I know you got a lot on your mind
And I know you think its un-lady like
But boy its been a hell of a night, so
Turn the lights down low
Its time to let it all go
You can send your worries up to God above
So you can send me all your love

All your love, all your love
So you can send me all your love
All your love, all your love
So you can send me all your love
All your love, all your love
So you can send me all your love"

It was all good just a week ago, niggas feel theyself
And that Watch the Throne drop, niggas kill theyself
What niggas gon' do, Hov?
This the new crack, on a new stove
I'm in the two-door, true that, niggas telling me, ""You back!""
Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch, huh?
And if life's a bitch, bet she suck my dick, huh
And I bet she fucked the whole clique, huh
By the way, nigga, you should fucking quit, nigga
Just forget it, you talk it, I live it
Like Eli, I did it, joke's on you, motherfucker and I get it, haha
No paper, ho, but you can have some more of me
Or-a-gy or are we speaking metaphorically?
Historically I'm kicking bitches out like Pam, nigga
Going HAM, nigga, me and Jigga
And a nigga still young, wanna have no kids
But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit
Had a few white girls, asses flat as shit
But the head's so good, damn, a nigga glad he hit
Got 'em jumping out the building, watch out below
A million out the door
[Chorus: Kanye West]
I'm about to go HAM
Hard as a motherfucker, let these niggas know who I am
I'm about to go HAM
Hard as a motherfucker, let these niggas know who I am

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Fuck y'all mad at me for?
Y'all don't even know what I've been through
I played chicken with a Mack truck
Y'all motherfuckers woulda been moved
I swam waters with great whites
Y'all motherfuckers woulda been chewed
I hustled with vultures late nights
Y'all motherfuckers woulda been food
Fuck wrong with these dudes? Try to walk around in these shoes
See the shit I saw growing up
Then maybe you could take a peek at these boos
Niggas fantasize about the shit that I do daily
Like these rappers rap about all the shit that I do really
I'm like, ""Really, half a billi,' nigga, really?"" You got baby money
Keep it real with niggas, niggas ain't got my lady money
Watch the throne, don't step on our robe
Bad enough we let you step on our globe
When my nephew died, daddy dead
Nigga took the price on my uncle's head
Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled
So I feel like I would like to know my uncle's bread
Bow down, brother, pay homage
Don't spill hate all on my garments
Comme des Garçons, fuck yo' fresh
Head shots, nigga, fuck your vest
Fuck the pig, no pork on my fork
Peace, God, 'cause you know a nigga just went

Dreamer,K'naan,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro:]
Uh, yeah
Believe it or not
What kept me alive
Is my Dreams

[Hook:]
I'm a dreamer, but I ain't the only one
Got problems but we love to have fun
This is our world, from here to your hood
We alive man, it's okay to feel good!
I'm a dreamer, but I ain't the only one
Got problems but we love to have fun
This is our world, from here to your hood
Lively up now, it's okay to feel good!
I'm a dreamer

[Verse 1: K'naan]
I got a friend named Flow
Who got a friend named Blow
With a finger named Clap
That'll leave you on the side like a Kangol hat
He ain't have no choice he was born this way
These streets pull your number like a phone display
And you gotta be defensive with your life
You gotta be like Bush and take pre-emptive strikes
And ""The boys from the hood are always hard""
Let alone in Mogadishu it's a mastered art
If you bring the world hoods to a seminar
We from the only place worse than Kandahar
Man that's kinda hard
But we still like to party and Hardy-hard
Something good happens we say ""Mashallah""
Something bad happens, ""Que sera, sera""
I close my eyes and all I can see, is you dancing with me
[Hook]

[Verse 2: K'naan]
It's okay to feel good
It's the truth!
Ayyo, and check it out

What would it take for a boy about my age
To hear cheers in his head upon that stage?
And the cheers they would drown out the tears from my brown eyes
C'mon backstage
You see the screams ain't the screams from gunshot screams
In my dreams these screams are from hot teens
And I'm barely thirteen and pack a dirty
Ol' Russian firearm that shoots thirty
Just then I hear the bus engine
I'm transcendin'
I'm crowd surfin'
I can't see the time burnin'
I'm not hurtin'
With my mahogany pen
""I'm on a world Tour, with Muhammed and them!""
And we be overseas, and not in these streets
Where my peeps stay alive, like the Beegees
And the likes of Jay-Z would say my steez
Say he handily brought, hip hop peace
[Hook]

Sometimes we just like to have fun, man we like to forget
All the fighting, all the guns and the tires burnin

[Verse 3: K'naan]
Back on the verse
Imagine crack wasn't birthed
Imagine that Earth wasn't hurt
Imagine no Homeland alerts
Imagine no record locator
So I wouldn't have to get a criminal waiver
Imagine the piece wasn't in my briefs
Instead peace could stretch across the seas
So finally we could we could just rest in the East
No Refugees
And you, well you could dress in a book
And I could read your body with less than a look
I got a dream girl in my mind, that's the hook
An intellectual, sexual and still can cook

And I feel good right now...I feel good right here
You feel good right now? You feel good??

[Hook 2x]
[K'Naan speaking to end]
We not down and out...just because the times are hard
Uh-uh...uh-uh...yeah...shout out to the strugglers
In my country...the hardest place on Earth right now
But still...I still know how to get down
I still know how to vibe out
Still know how to talk to a pretty girl
Take it easy now...YEAH"

Make her hips SWING - and - look - just like you
But come to think about it, I think this club is crowded
It's kinda hard to do your thing when everyone's surrounding
So let me form a circle everybody step back
I heard somebody yell ""Savage where the chorus at?!""
[Chorus: Savage]
Oh shit, shake that ass ma, move it like a gypsy
Stop, woah, back it up, now let me see your hips SWING
Oh shit, shake that ass ma, move it like a gypsy
Stop, woah, back it up, now let me see your hips SWING
Now drop it looooow and let me see your hips SWING
Down to the floooor now let me see your hips SWING
Now drop it looooow and let me see your hips SWING
Down to the floooor now let me see your hips SWING

Ok, it's time
I know y'all thought y'all was doing somethin
Might as well just get it over with
SUICIDE!!!

[Hook: Fabolous]
For all of y'all, know you feeling yourself
Going against me is like killing yourself
It's a, suicide it's a suicide
It's a what? Suicide it's a suicide
It's a what? Suicide it's a suicide
It's a what? Suicide it's a suicide
It's a suicide, It's a suicide

[Verse One: Paul Cain]
For all of y'all I know you feeling yourself
Going against me is like killing yourself
You've seen hot cars, you ain't never wheel 'em yourself
You've seen money, but never took a million yourself
You've seen things stole, you ain't never steal 'em yourself
You've seen drugs sold, you ain't never deal 'em yourself
You've seen men die, you ain't never kill 'em yourself
But you the realist right? Nigga you ain't real wit yourself
What I spit, I don't do it for a deal or for wealth
The fans dig it, when you spit what's real and your felt
Trust and believe that, they know when he raps
It's trill talk, he really lived it if he speak that
The hood favorite, they could all relate
They really saw me walk the pavement, the dope boy that made it
So all the bragging and your tough talk, save it
Spare me the details, I'm not in amazement
Dick, I've seen better done more shit
I really seen cheddar slung raw, I did the things you just saw
Your net worth, shit I made that on one tour
And this is back in '04, what I got to front for?
Nigga that's no lie, no joke, no game
No fabrication, last name must be Cobain
Must be on cocain, cause for you to ride
Along with those stupid guys, against us is suicide
[Verse Two: Freck Billionaire]
If I get bucked, cause a nigga testify
Same nigga might as well swallow pesticide
West Philly Freck, I'm a Street Family member
AKA Torquise Blue Lamby spinner
Yeah I ball with no roof like a stadium
Preferably I been seen with a lady friend
And the hoes know Freck, I'm only out for sex
I cum first like ""A"" up in the alphabet
When I hit the shop, the niggas seen me spend it all
I make them hating ass niggas wanna end it all
Just face it playa, you ain't got to clout yet
You might as well stick a fork up in a outlet
I got the stacks so high I could barricade
Got the stock on deck like Ameritrade
You hating ass niggas should just share a blade
Suicide music, this is just a serenade

[Verse Three: Fabolous]
When I die, fuck it I wanna go to hell
Cause I doubt the man upstairs would let you blow a L
Don't make sense walkin in Heaven like ""what's goodie?""
Dressed in black, with black Tim's and black hoodies
So, your boy back like I'm revenge or something
Lock yourself in the garage with the engine running
Or you could sky dive with no parachute
Play Russian Roulette with a .9, don't be scared to shoot
Use your chain to strangle yourself
You faggots in the closet, coat hanger yourself
They said ""try me"", bitch they musta told you wrong
You rather fuck Magic with no Trojan on
Whoever said you got a shot is tryna load you wrong
I'm a battlefield that you don't send a soldier on
Word to mama, they call my flow Osama
Your future look as bright as a suicide bomber
My co-defendants names are DJ Drama
Kobe, Cain, Mr. 10-Digits-and-3-comas
And my nigga Rojo, respect my congloma'
Sleep is the cousin of death, and y'all got on pajamas
Nigga you gon sow just like you reap
The old folks'll say ""you look just like you sleep""
No TLC, I just like to creep
The black box in the plane look just like my jeep
Yeah, I be where the crash at
My Twitter location is ""Where The Cash At""
Niggas get camera shy when you flash that
Stop recycling rhymes and just trash that

Ill Still Kill,50 Cent,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: Akon]
Oh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothing changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I don't want to, nigga, but I will if I got to
Kill, if niggas get to fucking around
If niggas get to fucking around

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Yeah, respect come from admiration and fear
You can admire me or you could catch one in your wig
You see the Testarossa, the toaster's right on my lap
So if a nigga get out of line then nigga get clapped
I got an arsenal, an infantry I'm built for this mentally
That's why I'm the general, I do what they pretend to do
Front on me now, nigga, I'll be the end of you
Forget your enemies and think of what your friends'll do
I drop a bag off, then let a mag off
The Heckler and Koch'll tear half of your ass off
I'm not for the games, I'm not for all the playing
The hollow tips rain when I unleash the pain
Get the message from the lines or get the message from the nine
Paint a picture with words, you can see when I shine
Put my back on the wall, nigga, watch me go for mine
I let twenty-one shots off at the same time, yeah
[Chorus: Akon]
Oh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothing changed, still holla at my homies

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Yeah, where I'm from death is always in the air, homie
Nana love me so you know she say my prayers for me
I come creeping through the hood wearing Teflon
Hit the corners, motherfuckers get left on
Niggas know, if not, they better check my background
Try and stick me I'll fill your back with MAC rounds
Ask Preme, nigga, 50 don't back down
I kick it funky like fiends in the crack house
Cross the line, boy, I'ma air ya ass out
Screw your face at me I wanna know what that's 'bout
Nigga I know you ain't mad, I done came up
And if you are, fuck you 'cause I ain't change up
The O.G.'s wanna talk, but I don't know these niggas
And I ain't did no business with 'em, I don't owe these niggas
A minute of my time, I get it cause I grind
All across the globe like the world's mine, yeh

Oh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothing changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I don't want to, nigga, but I will if I got to
Kill, if niggas get to fucking around
If niggas get to fucking around

[Verse 3: Akon]
Konvict
Now tell me have you ever looked off in the distance
And seen a MAC aiming at your head, man?
Before you know it life is flashing, reminiscing
And your body is dripping and full of lead, mane
I done been there, I done copped that
It ain't never been a question, I'm bout that
Don't go there, you get clapped at
And if you plan to fuck around and re-route that
You'll never catch me riding around on these streets
Without a couple metal pieces under my feet
Fully automatic weapons unloaded will unleash
Stash up under the carpet like a can of sea breeze
50 don't make me ride on these niggas
'Cause I will kill, dip and hide on these niggas
50 don't make me ride on these niggas
'Cause I be long gone like The Ripper so

Oh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothing changed, still holla at my homies

Lying here with no one near

How we stop the Black Panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that? What Gil Scott was hearin'
When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland
We invested in that, it's like we got Merrill lynched
And we been hangin' from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we, cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it
Sell it, the fiends cop it, nowadays they can't tell if
That's that good shit, we ain't sure, man
Put the CD on your tongue—yeah, that's pure, man

From the place where the fathers gone
The mothers is hardly home
And the maricons lock us up in the Audy Home
How the Mexicans say? ""We just tryin' to party, holmes""
They wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood, it's a different type of chemical
Arm & Hammer baking soda, raised they whole quota
Right when our soldiers, ran for the stove 'cause...
Dreams of being Hova
Went from bein' a broke man to bein' a dopeman
To bein' the president—look, there's hope, man!
This that inspiration for the Moes and the Folks, man
Shorty come and see his momma straight overdosin'
And this is the soundtrack
This the type of music that you make when you 'round that

Before the feds give us these days and take our daily bread
See, I done did all this ol' bullshit
And to atone, I throw a lil' somethin'-somethin' on the pulpit
We took that shit, measured it, and then cooked that shit
And what we gave back was crack music
And now, we ooze it through they nooks and crannies
So our mamas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies
And we gon' repo everything they ever took from granny
Now, the former slaves trade hooks for Grammys
This dark diction has become America's addiction
Those who ain't even Black use it

Lookin' for these better days

[Chorus]
Better days, hey!
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey!
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days

[Verse 1]
Time to question our lifestyle, look how we live
Smokin' weed like it ain't no thing, so even kids
Wanna try now, then lie down and get ran through
Nobody watches 'em, clockin' the evil man do
Faced with the demons, addicted to hearin' victims screamin'
Guess we was evil since birth, product of cursed semens
'Cause even our birthdays is cursed days
A born thug in the first place, the worst ways
I'd love to see the block in peace
With no more dealers and crooked cops, the only way to stop the beast
And only we can change
It's up to us to clean up the streets, it ain't the same, too many murders
Too many funerals, and too many tears
Just seen another brother buried, plus I knew him for years
Passed by his family, but what could I say?
Keep yo' head up and try to keep the faith
And pray for better days
[Chorus]
Better days, better days
Hey! Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey!
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days

[Verse 2]
Thinkin' back as an adolescent
Who would've guessed that in my future years I'd be stressin'?
Some say the ghetto's sick and corrupted
Plus my P.O. won't let me hang with the brothers I grew up with
Tryna keep my head up and stay strong
All my homies slangin' yayo all day long
But they wrong, so I'm solo and so broke
Savin' up for some Jordan's, ‘cause they dope
I got a girl and I love her, but she broke too
And so am I — I can't take her to the place she wanna go to
So, we argue and play fight, all day and night
Makin' passionate love 'til the daylight
Plus we about to get evicted, can't pay the rent
Guess it's time to see who really is your friend
Tell me you pregnant and I'm amazed
So many blessings while we stressin', lookin' for them better days (For better days)
[Chorus]
Better days, better days
Hey! Better days
Thinkin' 'bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey!
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days

[Verse 3]
Now, me and you was real cool, hell on them square fools
Since back in high school, we was true, me and you
Hardly parted or separated, we stayed faded
Affiliated with gang-bangers and still made it
Up in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him
Still dressin' like grown men when rollin'
Out in the dark, smokin' Newports, gamin' marks
Got a place in my heart, homie, stay smart
Locked you up in the pen', and gave you three to ten
I send you letters with naked flicks of old friends
Hopin' you well, I know it's hell
Doin' time in the cells, you need mail when you in jail
And me, I'm doin' cool
I settled down, had a family, workin' a night school
Every once in a while, I reminisce
And I wonder how we ever came to this; I miss the better days

Take my hands out my pockets you can see my thumbs

Memorized by the glory, word life
Cut off niggas who killed good but couldn't do nothing for me
Shout 'em out every once in the blue
And kid yo, I never rocked with
Long as they keep away, we cool
I devised my own stimulus plan, I'm nigga-rich
I'm tired of eating those crumbs and black licorice
To free my mind on Friday, I cleanse in the mosque
Let the imam pray over my head and wash
Thoughts, sterilized, purified, Godly
Watch his gift manifest the green like barley
If that shit happen I'll feed his whole army
Talking 'bout the angels and peeps in Somali
Try to stay humble and swallow my pride
In God I trust, not talkin' 'bout the ones on your five
Crisp dollar billing, catch me in a little hut in Benin
Village style, feeding the children
Big pots of jasmine tea with Mandela
Africans chanting me on like Coachella

Wishing they could bury me next to the prophets

""Am I a fool?"" (We'll see)

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
The Lord takes me, gathering speeds before winds
High currents, distance, places be forming wings
Kings offering, thrones was there
Man with the seven crowns on his dome was near
Feet walked over rose petals sold from the ghetto
Face froze in gold like the pharaoh
Adorned in glory, robe of light, a power for his cherub
As He passed the path, white doves crossed the eyes of thugs
Eternal heartbeat and the dark fire in his blood
Seven hundred books were opened
Embraced to write, then threw the crooks in the ocean
Skin brass hair like it grew from goatskin
The chosen has spoken, tablets were broken
The smoke hand grabs an omen
Gravity grabbing me gradually, dragging me through Hell's cavity
This is blasphemy, I fell where the jackals feed
God felt bad for me but cast me in the Caspian Sea
Satan gave the dragon his key, Wu-Family's the faculty

He used to sling in the stairwell
Fast to put the rap on a thinking cap, ignite your hair gel
No such thing as the fair sale
He'll put the bullet out same day, delivery airmail
And on this level a thug will sell your garbage
No refund, the only exchange from the cartridge
But the users just kept coming back with their life earnings
Ready to make a deal, soul and pipe burning
The outcome tragic, the household dramatic
Living rooms for heating spoons, basements for addicts
Support from a bean, hit the courts from a fiend
Who betrayed one, who had lit the torch for his team
So he sent them gifts, body parts per diem
In a box that held prints but too dark to see 'em"

There's a lot of peer pressure growin' up as a young teen

Because it's gonna catch up with you in the long run

Their life is twisted, and most of them are quite gifted
In other words, they got talent
But they'd rather sell cracks, and bust gats
And run the streets actin' violent
To them it's all about hittin' skins and makin' some easy green
'Cause that's all they show you on the TV screen
All they care about is a buck or bustin' a sweet nut
They don't give a (What?) 'cause they're street struck
[Chorus]
You better listen to L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention to L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time

[Verse 2]
Before the rap contract, I was sellin' crack
Stay strapped with a Mac, I was into all of that
I started rappin' and got nice as hell
If it wasn't for this, I might be doin' life in jail
And some of my peeps are still in the game selling 'caine
If that's what you gotta do to maintain, go head and do your thang
But with the cash profit, make an investment
And try not to go to the grave like the rest went
'Cause you can be rich with crazy loot, own a house and nine cars
What good is that if you're dead or behind bars?
Ayo, it's not even funny
I've seen a lot of my peers give up their careers
For some fast money
They could've been boxers, ballplayers, or rap singers
Instead they bank robbers and crack slingers
Ayo, they used to be legit kids, now they corrupt
They had dreams, but gave 'em up, 'cause they're street struck

[Chorus]
You better listen to L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention to L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
You better listen to L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention to L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
[Verse 3]
I still chill with my peeps in the streets
But most of the time I'm in the crib writin' rhymes to some dope beats
Or either callin' up some freaks to bone
But word up, I try to leave the streets alone
But it's crazy hard kid, in other words, it's spooky
The streets be callin' me, like the crack be callin' Pookie
It ain't a dumb joke, listen to this young folk
'Cause where I'm from, you can choke from the gun smoke
Stay off the corners, that might be your best plan
Before you catch a bullet that was meant for the next man
Or end up with a deep cut
Or relaxin' on a hospital bed from bein' street struck

[Chorus]
You better listen to L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention to L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
You better listen to L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention to L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time

[Outro]
Word up
Ayo take it from me, the Big L
'Cause I been through it all, you know what I'm sayin'?
Stay off them corners, and stay out of trouble
And I gotta say rest in peace to all the casualties of the streets
I'm outta here"

The bridge is over, the bridge is over, biddy-bye-bye
The bridge is over, the bridge is over

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
You see me coming in di dance with the spliff of sensei
Down with the sound called BDP
If you want to join the crew, well, you must see me
You can't sound like Shan or the one Marley
Because Shan and Marley Marl, dem a rhyming like they gay
Picking up the mic, man, dem don't know what to say
Saying hip-hop started out in Queensbridge
Saying lies like that, man, you know dem can't live
So I tell them again, me come to tell them again, gwan
Tell them again, me come to tell them again
Tell them again, me come to tell them again, gwan
Tell them again, me come to tell them
Manhattan keeps on making it, Brooklyn keeps on taking it
Bronx keeps creating it and Queens keeps on faking it

Di-di, di-da, di-di-di, di-da, di-day, ayy
All you sucker MCs, won't you please come out to play? 'Cause
Here's an example of KRS-One (Buck)
Here's an example of KRS-One
They wish to battle BDP, but they cannot
They must be on the dick of who? DJ Scott La Rock, 'cause
We don't complain nor do we play the game of favors
Boogie Down Productions come in three different flavors
Pick any dick for the flavor that you savor
Mr. Magic might wish to come and try to save ya
But instead of helping ya out, he wants the same thing I gave ya
I finally figured it out, Magic mouth is used for sucking
Roxanne Shanté is only good for steady fucking
MC Shan and Marley Marl is really only bluffing
Like Doug E. Fresh said, ""I tell you now, you ain't nothing""
Compared to Red Alert on KISS and Boogie Down Productions
So easy now, man, I me say easy now, man
To KRS-One, you know dem can't understand
Me moving over there and then me moving over here
The name of this routine is called ""Live At Union Square""
Square, square, square, ooh
What's the matter with your MC, Marley Marl?
Don't you know that he's out of touch?
What's the matter with your DJ, MC Shan?
On the wheels of steel Marlon sucks
You'd better change what comes out your speaker
You're better off talking 'bout your wack Puma sneaker
'Cause Bronx created hip-hop, Queens will only get dropped
You're still telling lies to me
Everybody's talking 'bout the Juice Crew funny
But you're still telling lies to me"
8 Miles and Runnin,JAY-Z,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Jay Z]
Geah
Renegades is back
Em, the beat is sick
It's Young
Freeway
8 Miles
Let's go!

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Eight miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin'
And my eighth album comin', feeding a thousand growling stomachs
But I can rewind the calendar back, back when it was now or nothin'
People said I would amount to nothin', that I had talent for nothin'
Said I would succumb to violence or be silenced by a gunman
I could just hear the folks now: ""He got what he had comin'.""
Now that my eighth album's comin', everybody's smilin'
Wanting somethin', claiming that they done somethin' for him
Got their Jay Z pompoms and their Hov uniform
Claiming they been runnin' and tellin' everybody, like Martin Lawrence
'Bout how hot my rap performance was before I was who I was
Claiming that they threw it up before I threw it up—you what?
Where was you before I blew this up?
I didn't see you in the courtroom when everybody was suin' us
I didn't see you in all black when everybody was suitin' up
Back on the block, getting it in—it wasn't no you with us
[Hook: Jay Z + Freeway]
Eight miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin'
And my eighth album comin', feeding a thousand growling stomachs—Free!
Six miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin'
And my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs
Eight miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin'
And my eighth album comin', feeding a thousand growling stomachs—Free!
Six miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin'
And my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs

[Verse 2: Freeway]
Six miles and runnin' in the Pontiac six thousand eighty six
Trans' might shift while the engine run
Anyone, tell your honor: ""Give me one more chance""
And them smokers screaming, ""One more gram!"" so I'ma bring 'em one (Geah)
Only son to my pop, stick close to my mama
Keep toasters for drama, make Salat with my son
My son growin', and he learnin' a lot
That's when them toasters, when the burners will pop, brain on your, um–
'Brella, nigga, tell 'em niggas, that's like the Biblical scripture
Look back, turn to salt, like the sinners
Most of you heartless and self-centered like Meshach and Mesha
Set up your brother ‘cause you jealous, nigga
The heat back (Ugh), like you never left, I ever rep
Cops watch every step, six miles and runnin'
Dodgin' every trap, the rap gingerbread man
Cherish every precious breath, State P, the second gat
[Hook: Jay Z + Freeway]
Eight miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin'
And my eighth album comin', feeding a thousand growling stomachs—Free!
Six miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin'
And my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs
Eight miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin'
And my eighth album comin', feeding a thousand growling stomachs—Free!
Six miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin'
And my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Back when nobody would find he had talent, nobody would sign me
Nobody believed in me, nobody but Mommy, blindly
But how can she deny me? Me being the youngest runt
To come up outta her tummy, she got nothing but love for me
When niggas would one me, the industry shunned me
That's why I'm taking all the industry's money
Revenge is sweet honey, we run this
Young is the illest, Free is the future
Beans and Bleek is right now, we can see y'all, eight miles, nigga

RED,Wax,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse: Wax]
Got beans in the pot, hot dogs on the griddle
Five dollar merlot, we call it Merlittle
I spend time tripping when I'm red wine sipping, b
Me? I think I came to an epiphany
Got beans in the pot, hot dogs on the griddle
Five dollar merlot, we call it Merlittle
I spend time tripping when I'm red wine sipping
Red tint got things looking different, check it
My future's never been bright nor clear
So I don't wear shades, I just buy more beer
Every January first I say this is your year
As I stare at the medicine cabinet door mirror
But this year, the face looking out
Had a little smile on the side of its crooked mouth
And I knew it just as soon as I had seen it
That this time this motherfucker really did mean it
So I took it to heart and played my part
And made the right moves for the forward progression of my art
So now without no shame
This time next year I'll be a household name
I'm serious, I'm about to travel around the world spitting
Getting nastier than having anal sex while the girl's shitting
You just pictured that visual? Didn't you?
Isn't that proof that what I spit was true?
I take your brain further than it ever thought of going
Mixing a Christopher Nolan vision with the art of flowing
I never thought of blowing up overnight
I sit at home and write with a smoking pipe just to cope with life
So don't ask me why I ain't got signed yet
Ask yourself if you've opened up your mind yet
Ask Apple if they've invented the iPhone 9 yet
Ask Stephen Hawking to explain why we haven't traveled time yet
The future's wide open, a fact that combats any suicidal notion
The Rap Book for Dummies? I just threw inside the ocean
And replaced it with the basic rules of making music
Strictly by the most internal, instincts I got
Compose things verbal that my circle within thinks are hot
Besides music ain't much more that I got
That's why I'm writing and recording a lot
Man, cause I don't know how my life's gonna end, brah
Probably sipping Svedka in a Sentra
I don't pretend to be something I ain't
Til the picture of myself is a saint
Ain't a picture that I paint
The red dripping down the leg of an artists's easel
The blood flowing through the brains of the smartest people
The apple Eve bit from that started evil
A darker hue of the fish guts for the sharks and seagulls
In the haystack, I'm the sharpest needle
You were left way back, we are far from equal
Attaboy, you're kindergarten repeating
I'm Adam, boy, I'm in the Garden of Eden
So tell the devil that the apple ain't enough
Unless he puts something in there to get me really fucked up
MDMA in the core of it
And I be fucking Eve til she can't take no more of it
First time for everything, every single orifice
And she be trying to keep the noise like there's an ordinance
Set the coordinates, hit the gas, punk
We ain't gonna stop unless the order is from NASA
It's like me and Herbs filled out a form to get the cash, brah
Money for knowledge, you would of sworn it was FAFSA
Get your student loan believe
We at a level most humans won't achieve
We doing shit that people do in only dreams
And I ain't talking bout the pretty shit on the screens
I'm talking about actual self-fulfillment
Dreams you imagined manifested into real shit
Dreams you feel with the core of your soul
Dreams you've had since you were four years old
Dreams you've had that kept you warm when it was cold
That one glimmer of hope that good fortune's down the road
My father wanted an abortion I was told
All he left me was this dream and I've morphed it into gold
There ain't a fucking thing in life that I can't accomplish
There ain't a fucking mind on earth that I can't astonish
The promised land is not really a land that's promised
To get there you got to bear hug anacondas
Swim through a pool full of sharks and piranhas
We get there? We gon' bubble on some Scantron ish
To summarize what I've said
Self-doubt's only something in your head
So when it's all over and I'm dead
Write my epitaph... in red"

Feels like I'm dreaming, but I'm not sleeping

""Hello, I’m Dean Stockton of Eastern State University in America, and I am prepared to offer you a full science scholarship.""
""Viktor used the college—used its modern scientific equipment to conduct strange, forbidden experiments.""

[Verse: Viktor Vaughn]
Somewheres out in cop-killer Queens
Where bo deans stop limousines and niggas flee the scene
Somebody on his back bleeding vest all cracked up
""Freeze clown officer down request for back up""
Listen dude don't get me misconstrued as a sniper
It's V Vaughn, not to be confused with V, La Viper
Or either Peter Parker, or either Peter Piper
A seed the type to pee the diaper blame it on the wiper
""It's really not your concern why I got the knife, sir""
He suggest remain calm, let's not get -- ""No!""
Slash his windpipe, he had them type of eyes
He might be still alive, how you get this thing to hyper drive?
Oh, give my props to the shooter
Prices at a all time low in the future
Something like fourteen, they must be on horse pills
OT and zero-three to re-up on force fields
At that cost, deal, he plotted the coordinates
Two thousand three winter time upper west side, more or less
This thing be buggin' like a celly frontin'
Who the hell is honey with the slug in her belly, stuntin'
You ain't have to tell V nuthin'
Trust him, it really ain't no time for discussion
He'd be back in '93, press of a button, and they busted in
His first impulse was to smack the dirt
All four wore plain clothes and lumberjack shirt
Recognize one face from school six degrees ago
He'd snuff him in his braces just to switch the station to BGO
He kept a punch line every lunch break, lunch time
And this is no time to pump fake, it's crunch time
The same split second, they let off the toast
That's when he hit the speed dial and sped off, ghost
I know those cats don't like V
And if they took my head off they'd get off most likely
And probably thought the time gizmo was my wallet
And hit the hills, no, forty more times on some foul shit
Pick a crime, he was out in the nick of time
To get paid another day and live to kick a sicker rhyme
For iller, it's like Miller malt liquor time
Up town finery where it's probably not best to flaunt
Everyone's your best friend, V steps into the restaurant
""My friend,"" he said, ""You must be psychic""
""What's the price of- ""Fourteen! It’s good, you like it!""
Huh, be back tonight
The fourteen G pack was really packed tight
But back at the lab he found the Sleestak was right
Not only was it three cracks light, but too white
The test show lactose, anbesol, lecithin
Five types of aspirin and other kinds of medicines
Next time I'll bring my men who speak Mexican
And let the Techs spin, make 'em contact the next of kin

Nitrous kick, wanna trip, this some new shit
Real deal like Cody Field
There's no telling if you ride like Mike, you just might
Rock like doubie drop, doubie drop tight

Take flight like Nike kicks, the new tricks and make quick

Got to stay focused and hope it don’t affect my salary

Got to help my partner’s in the pen 'cause they living broke
This ain’t no joke, on parole and I can’t smoke
No sticky indo, roll down the window
'Cause if I breathe the tac it's back lights like Nintendo
Got to play the game like a professional
If you ain’t having money I got to let you go
I need to let you know the rules before you infiltrate
Rule number one, partner, never should you pimpatrate

Now it’s time for these game-hungry niggas to get fed

Move On Remix,Slaughterhouse,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Joell Ortiz]
YAOWA What's up my nigga
You say your name is John
Joell Ortiz
Yeah yeah I know I'm familiar with the interview shit
I know what you gon' ask
I got you, don't even stress it

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
No I don't respond with answers that fit a script
So the repetition'll make a nigga flip
We in the game of smoke and mirrors, those engineering a bigger spliff
Blowing circles out they mouth, getting praised but the shit'll shift
I never lived a myth, if I said it I did it
Never alleged, word to dead I grip the fifth (boom!)
I made my housing tenement a strip, movin' medicine and nicks
When I seen 'em comin' I jetted from them pricks
And still to this day, though she clean, I wish my mommy never sniff
But the hurt is makin' me better with this gift
I'm live with this ink you could, die in a blink and
Y'all got the nerve to ask me why do I drink and
Motherfucker, sometimes I cry when when I think and
Y'all ain't there when them tears bein' dried by the sinkIt was cold in the winter, my community centers who gave me dinner
I ain't mind, my table chairs gave me splinters (haha!)
Set up to be loser but was made to be a winner (look)
If they paint Hip-Hop I bet my face be in the picture
If they wrote a rap bible bet my name be in the scriptures
If shorty say I'm her idol bet her face be in my zipper (woo!)
I came a long way from the staples in my scrilla
Stains on my pants, hardly had a gut
The ladies ain't wanna dance so house parties would suck
All my friends on the wall, I'm in the hall with a couple
Nah I ain't complaining, just tellin y'all what it is
So if y'all going through it now just know that another kid
Made something outta nothing, well I'm fronting, I was never nothing
Older ladies used to tell my mother ""Ain't he something?""
I look at a lot of you cats and laugh
Cause I'm the shit man, and y'all ain't even passing gas
When I spit I'm the definition of mastered craft
And all y'all ask about is Aftermath
Motherfucker move on!
[Hook: Iyana Dean + Iffy]
I'm tryin to be, more than what it is you see
For every take, do it just like eternity
But I won't let it hold me down, I turn it all around
I'm movin on, oh-ah, oh-ahhhh, yes I'm movin on

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
L-look, look; I gotta give my own interview
Since niggas that do my interviews focus on whatever's miniscule (like!)
Or paint me as a cynical, but the canvas'll limit you (dawg)
You can't go beyond what there's no limit to
If I think Hip-Hop is dead I think it's being revived
And that comes from me being inside
Where the demons get by, see 'em good-bye
If I'm vehement here's why, come from hearing and seeing venomous lies (oh!)
So the beast in me cried, cause when it's all you hear
Shit get overbear, just when the obey near
And so I try to think straight cause when you stare in the rear
Rest in peace Stewart Skakir, nigga yeah
I'm on another label, not that other label
That mean it's no longer my problem, it's theirs
Some say it's a conspirac'
I say if e'rybody's on the throne, that just more motive to kill the heir
Ask me 'bout ""Pump it Up"" and I'mma think you sheep
Or you must not know I'm deep
I'm so off of music so y'all could SoundScan every week
Me, I just got my lil' man every week
Jersey City loves me despite y'all beliefs
Cause they was baby stepping, I showed 'em how to leap (ohh!)
Ask me about swag - I'mma change the topic
To lyrics in them raps, plus look at you like a fag
I love e'rybody, don't ask 'bout who I beef with
They burned the bridge but they was standing underneath it
I'm on my grind, Benjamin hunting
Was old since I was young, call me Benjamin Button
And stop using slang just for you to be cool
Cause I go BACK to when it was cool to be you
I'm a hero (nah), no I mean I'm Hiro from Heroes
Y'all chase zeroes
Muh'fucker I just got finished hating ME feelin like a zero
They played De Niro, never been there though
So before your next thought, understand
Know it's MUCH more to me than the man
Either that or move on

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9""]
It's, it's Nickel
My rhyme's the reflection of Scarface and Prem' soul
Before Jordan was wearin fo'-five; I just look like this, I just seem old
But I had to bleed the blood of a dirty motherfucker
To suffer clean clothes and touch what a king holds
The real estate market is harsh, everything goes
From fo's to who you was doin' everything for
But I cut 'em off and move on to the new checks
New friends. chasin' my new ends with new threats
Watchin' my dreams fold, like a stack of bills
In the pocket of who ain't tryin' to push up daffodils
But we the supergroup, you couldn't
Handle this shit if you was standin' before us carryin' a pooper-scoop
You dealt with shady shit, I dealt with shady shit
But I'm the only one can truly say I dealt with Shady's shit
I mean that with all respect to Paul and Shect
But Ryan and Marshall is all you get
My flow's superb, I love Paulie Rosenberg
What I say in a track, those just words
Baby boy forgive me, I'm just street
Cause I can change into anything niggas want me to be like Mystique
I don't gotta dig deep
To realize Slim bought Big Proof a big Jeep
Because he deserved it, how could I mourn
The same way Shady did over him when he knew him when he attended Osbourne
Marshall I'm sorry, I knew it went left
I ain't into fuckin' my family like incest
If you remember Ice used to be my life's interest
Tell Hailie my wife just had a princess
Since I made up with Em it's nothin'
Else that I could move on from so who wants some
Like a jar of Grey Poupon
You gotta ask anybody in any car, one of them move on
[Verse 4: Crooked I]
Yeah, yeah; when fans picture my interviews
They think I'm in a swimming pool with women who been abused
So they turn into strippers makin' they livin' in the nude
One in the middle blowin' my inner tube
While the interviewer's getting ridiculed
Is this your vision
Cool; let me give you a little jewel
Any dude who wanna sit in my tennis shoes is missin' screws
Don't get it misconstrued, don't get this shit confused
I'm two seconds from prison fool, I'm a different dude
Pistol in my reach man, still in Long Beach man
Hoping if my grind don't help me get out my speech can
I been in the streets longer than Yao Ming's wingspan
You can be MTV, I'll be C-SPAN
I deal with politics, bandanas and hollow tips
Half you rappers follow these role models can swallow dick
Was stressed out over cash flow
Hip-hop used to console my soul, now it's a bunch of assholes
Rap about a dance while I'm targeting cops
Spit some shit for Oscar Grant, hit the sergeant with shots
Make him a Ghost like he part of The Lox
I won't stop recording 'til I'm makin' songs harder than Pac's
If it don't happen, at least a nigga know he right there
Every memory under my Dodger hat's a nightmare
As a kid I had to steal breakfast
And now the best question you have to ask me, is this a real necklace
Where's your beat from Dre; your feature from Cube
These things leave people confused
Cause they know I leave speakers abused, I eat the EQ's
I eat through the beat, what's the secret, I think it's the shoes
Back in Cali niggas blaze and stress
Waitin' on Detox to save the West
Even if the shit is dope it ain't givin' you niggas hope
Unless your signature's wrote on a check from Interscope, nope

Move on, move on
West, Coast, nahmean
West Coast move on
And all that shit in the past about me being on Death Row
Move on, or get moved on
Ha ha, Slaughterhouse, biatch"
Trife Life,Mobb Deep,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Havoc  & Prodigy]
Check it out now
Word up, son, shit is ill, kid
Nahmsayin'?
Bein' that we livin' the motherfuckin' trife life
Still have another day, right?
It's only right
Let me put you on to what happened, son
You ain't gonna believe this shit
Kick that shit

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
It's just another day, drowning my troubles wit' a forty
That's when I got a call from this brown skin shorty
She asked me where's my crew at, said we could do whatever
She got a crew too and said that we should get together
I said, ""Aight, just call me back in a hour
So I can take a shower and gather up the manpower""
Then I hung up the horn
And I thought to myself that it might be on
'Cause this trick ain't pick up the phone to call me in years (Why?)
Ever since I left the ho lonely in tears
Ain't no telling what her friends putting up in her ears
Ideas of setting me up I'm not trying to hear
(Check it out, son) So we take the gats for precautions
Plus, this trick live in Brooklyn, home of the coffin
She might got a whole battalion of Bucktowners
Waiting for us to get up off the train and surround us
Or maybe, I'm blowing this shit out of proportion
But this shit do happen to niggas very often
So fuck it, a nigga gotta do what he meant to
My crew got my back, 'Fuck the world' is my mental
We put together five soldiers
The bitch called, my blood curdled
Told me to meet her on Myrtle
Got to the plaza, we're waiting for the G train
We put a plan together, just in case the beef came
Now we Bed-Stuy bound
Far from home and on unknown ground
But together we six deep, with five heats, nothing sweet
First nigga fronting getting lifted off his fucking feet
It took eternity to reached our destination
My heartbeat is racing like a cardiac patient
We finally got to Myrtle, outside the train station
I saw not a soul, told my peoples to be patient
But hold up, that's when a black caravan rolled up
My legs didn't froze up, I grabbed my pound
Told my man, ""Eyes open 'cause it might go down""
Said he don't like the way the shit is starting to sound
Every angle of the car was smoked out and tinted
So we couldn't tell if the enemy was in it
It might have been TNT, I wasn't trying to wait and see
We jetted through Marcy 'cause D's ain't bagging me
Word, son, they got us on the run, dunn, see, yo
[Hook]
Check it out, check it out, check it out, yo
Trife life got me thinking like an animal
No doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt, yo
What can kill you is what you don't know

[Verse 2: Havoc]
OK, check it, you're on your way to your girl's crib
But the bitch live in the 'Bridge
You ain't really sweating it
'Cause little do you know, the niggas in the 'Bridge be setting it
You thought you was safe
And tried to walk the back streets without heat
On the 41st Side of 12th Street
The side where niggas don't give a fuck
The side where if you come through fronting
Kid, you getting bucked
On your way, to apartment 3A
With a phat herringbone, let him slide? No days
Son, get the heat, 'cause I'm about to stick him
(Fuck that shit, yo, if that nigga front, yo, hit him!)
Aight, bet, so just hold it down
While I cock back the long three pound
You're upstairs boning, not knowing that I'm scheming
Just the right time, kid, it's twelve in the evening
You're leaving out the building as you kiss your girl goodbye
Thought you was safe and got caught by surprise
""What's going on?"" as I reply
""Shut the fuck up and don't make this to another homicide""
He tried to play tough so I put one in his brain
Even though I took his life, all I wanted was his chain
Come through truck without heat, how you figure?
When you in the projects, keep your fingers on the trigger
But fuck that, we juxing
If you got what we like, it gets tooken
Put you on your back, send you on your way, yo, good looking
Now we catching a cab to Halsey & Lewis in Brooklyn
Getting tore up from the floor up, hit the dress store up
Got the 80 auto in case a nigga wanna roll up
Get your motherfucking shit swoll up
Now it's back to Queens to serve fiends
Making G's by any means, my eyes on my enemies
Sipping Hennessy, with my mind on some crime shit
One-time searching me, but never ever find shit
It's the everyday, get the loot then breeze
Though my goal is to leave outta state, push ki's
But all this bullshit holding me down, I can't leave
Fuck a 9-to-5, I get the loot with ease
Don't even need a degree to earn a six-digit figure
I get mines slinging on the corner with my niggas
Pulling the trigger when the drama appears
'Cause a nigga worse enemy is fear
So, yo....

And I want you to tell me, exactly, what you want me to do to you

Your body whispering from under the sheets

But it's your mouth I want to tell it to me

That you want my hands right here and my mouth right there
Girl, don't play shy, show me how bold you can be
Open your mouth and tell me where you want me

And this is Zero, uh, so you gon’ need some nula
I would say fuck the world but I get tired after two nuts
Inspired by my father’s death to hit harder than Tarvis left
A bit harder than brick walls, I missed all of them pit falls
Puffy like that referee that missed all of them big calls
Because the bitches and big cars'll blind you
I get called the best rapper alive just to remind you
And I ain't trying to shit on you but if the shoe fits on you
You just gon’ have to wear it, walk in it amidst the ridicule
The winners do the strangest things, we don't hibernate
Our pupils dilated, we up for people to violate
I tie a snake in a knot, you sly fox
From The Wire better known as the home of the pine box
Behind gwap, get found behind rocks, there's so many crimes
Over your many blinds and watch so-so many times
I heard so many kinds of shots and at any time
Get robbed for any shine you got, Zero
I spell it Z-E-R-O, push horses like we be Zorro
Go harder for the dinero, hoping that we see tomorrow
These verses free to borrow, flow colder than East Chicago
God dag, if I stood up on my swag, I could see Toronto
I need that cheese like pronto and I ain't making pizza
Been known to carry beef, I ain't Jamaican neither
A million laps and running, I never take a breather
These rappers a bunch of girly actors, hey Kadejah
Regine, Max and 'Claire, I'm going in
Call me a house with the Tootie out, just call me over ten
Gifted, it's Mr. Kringle, the shit that make bitches tingle
And never ever took the radio, a living single
Sit calm and cool, y'all sitcoms comical
I start at S and skip the T, nigga I be on to you
But you don't get it, you super slow
I'm just a regular nigga that got a super flow
They study me super hard, you should call me Super Los
They know they can't fuck with me so they just claim they super close
You got a groupie ho, I got a group of hoes

No bullshit, she love my style
I only pull her jeans up when she's upside down
But why frown
You should be glad
Sent her home with new handbags, who could be mad
Cocoa guts, marshmallow whip
And I'm stirring up trouble with a hot chocolate bitch
If I'm not the shit you must of got me twisted
Don't a dog leave his mark on every spot he visit

Neck on Antarctica, wrist is on Vegas

'Sho 'nuff, hit the Bank and thrust
Wu Nauticas Jamie Sommer got trained on the tour bus
We upgrade, swallow raw eggs, read the label
Hitting white-label, left the Winnebago unstable
Smooth sailing, walked in, my Earth start kneeling
Started stealing, I'm too ill, see we're grilling at the parlay
Kicked up, mack, max motion
Michael Bolton magazine quote, I'm too potent
Louisville mix pain kill rap
Fuck benadryl the violin in 'Knowledge God' sounded ill
Tremendously obnoxious, no blotches
My telephone watch'll leave bartenders topless
Dead arm the prosecutor, smack the juror
Me and my girl'll run like Luke and Laura
We sit back on Malayan islands
Sipping mixed drinks out of broke coconut bowls, we wilding

[Chorus: Raekwon]
Sit back jollyin' (ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha)
Sit back jollyin' (ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha)
Sit back jollyin'
My team be gamin' like three card Rolly an'
Drug Somalians pollyin'
Sit back jollyin'
My team be gamin' like three card Rolly an'
Drug Somalians pollyin'
Sit back
[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
Deep meditation sound orientated, war the blizzard
Rap paramedical the wizard
Cappadonna, never catering to none
My microphone and three verse weigh a ton of slaughter
You order five thousand back across the water
My laboratory story keep me flowing with the glory
Acapella or deep dirty instrumental
I could blow the sky like the stormy wind blew
One gallon of wilding, Park Hill profiling
I cut your face a Buck 50 sure why you smiling?
For violating my position
I leave you smoked like a crackhead on a mission
Two tokes of mic dope, one stroke of elegance
Rated like the movie graphic told intelligence
Person to person, it'd be hard for you to take a trophy
You better off to get somebody out to try to smoke me
Cause I'm PLO TKO every day
Dancehall General, Party Fanatic Colonel
Cappadonna son'a old school Disco Inferno
Veteran for rapping with the new set of Wu the hard rapping
Ninety-six jive, I keep the live crowd clapping
When I bow, all praises due to Staten Isle
I spark the mic and Shaolin spark the methtical
Every evening, I have a by myself meeting
Thinking who's gonna be the next to catch a beating
From my mental slanging, bitching rap twist the point of warfare
I brutalize, all competition catch hell here
Chance him, that's what they said, threw up a ransom
I jacked it, stripped the beat naked and packed it
Gimme my rewards
[Outro]

You better hurry up or get left behind
Like your hairy derriere where the sun don't shine
Tom Slick on the track but the streets are mine
And thanks to Einstein I got beats to rhyme
Designed like a porcupine, untouchable
I'm a four-course meal, you're a Lunchable
This beat will self-destruct
In five, four

[Andy]
Diz, hold up!
Goin off like a cuckoo clock
I was kickin' with the beat 'til my shoe flew off
As I rock with better timing than a metronome
To set the tone, looking for respect, alone
On the throne putting in work like Solomon Burke
To take over the world like an Ottoman Turk
Butterball's unlikely to rock shows nightly
To wow and excite, then I'm out like Spike Lee
[Dizzy Dustin]
I run through your city like a bullet train
And blow the roof off like a hurricane
I'm sick so sick I got my own disease
The doc said I had a case of flow with ease
In a hundred degrees, I blow my nose and sneeze
I'm so cold they call me cool breeze
You're going downhill like an avalanche
And you're full of more bull than a cattle ranch

[Andy]
Yup, you. The cat who said that we were through
Too old school, need to do somethin new
You're slippin like I threw out a banana peel
On the ground or you can kneel to the man of steel
As I speed through the sky with the bird's eye view
And you must be high like a nerd's IQ
Do ya homework, press rewind
You better go back before you get left behind

[Hook]
Left behind, you get left behind
Left behind, you better hurry up and get left behind

I spit quick like a lizard's lick
And slick as if I was the Grandwizard Rick
A hit with the fans, me and Diz Mark man
To split command, cause panic like a shark's fin
When the beat starts, stop beatin hearts
Teeth extremely sharp, comin at your meaty parts
Makin a mess out of discotheques
The crowd crazed like I got Gizmo wet
[Dizzy Dustin]
I dibbled and dabbled on roads less traveled
I kicked up dust and kicked up gravel
No Sleep 'Til Brooklyn as well as Seattle
Young Einstein with the funky piano
And I'm on the mic like Mick Jagger's lips
Cause U.D.'s all that and a bag of chips
You can't get with this like you might slip a disc
Better take it as a warning like I slit my wrists

[Andy]
Like Heavy D, Steady B, rappin is my pedigree
People lookin dead at me, rhymes roll readily
I hold it down like a paperweight
To make 'em happy like I baked a cake
See I can take a break and mold it to shape
Cause when I'm rippin and my word is like an iceberg, here's the tip of it
A little message, I hope we enthuse
So you move like a fetus in the fallopian tube

[Dizzy Dustin]
I'm full strength like a cyclops eyedrops
I got support like high tops
I keep the mic hot 'til you turn the lights off
Then I'm nocturnal like a nighthawk (CAW~!)
Swoop down when I search for prey
You better run and hide from the words I say
I keep it tighter than cornrows
And I'mma stop rappin when the horn blows

You are completely transperent to me

My boy just found his mom dead
Days after she got her palm read
She's 'bout to drown and what made me a jarhead
Not a marine but I'm in army fatigues
Ready to flip with an undoubtably dubious demented demon dip
Stuck to my face till my lungs embrace the death
You see a crowd of souls choking on and smoking my breath
Flat tire, no fire, stuck out in Dippyville
You know you gone when you see blood vessels in your peripheral
My eyes are two planets of maggots that all stare
And whoever speaking to me, I am not there
She left me to go fly in the mist
She slipped and sliding in piss
Psych-major, I was fucking my psychiatrist
Brother thinks he poses a threat
I was defocused and wet, only my dog when you stuck your nose in my shit
She's needy, greedy, made it to my CD
I hope you get VD, you can stand in front of my TV

She's See Thru, for her to see to
Hand on your throat never seem to reach you
Let's play sane again, and we'll drown in a puddle of purple rain again
I wish today would end
Probably couldn't see it through all of the haze I'm in
When the world divides and opens up, taking me calmly
You can keep the last word, it still be looking down on me

[Tame One]
My ex broad used to smoke wet raw, till something went wrong
Off a dime, sugerdraws lost her mind
Flipped out and had the detox, up in the hospital
Went to see her after 40 days, ass got little
Perm grew out, sherm blew out
Her motor functions had her spazzing and scrapping, over nothing
Said the voices in her head made threats that sound way evil
Kill people, she don't know how to act, like Vin Diesel
I'm looking at her through five inches of glass
Going through changes, tears in my eyes cause her stare was aimless
She'll never be the same again, asked me two times, what was my name again
I'm like ""Damn, that Purple Rain again""
""Visiting hours is over"", the nurse said and touched my shoulder
Sugerdraws attitude just got colder
Orderlys had to restrain her, I fought back tears to stream hot
Cause I'm knowing 'bout them Thorazine shots
[Hook x2]
She's See Thru, for her to see to
Hand on your throat never seem to reach you
Let's play sane again, and we'll drown in a puddle of purple rain again
I wish today would end
Probably couldn't see it through all of the haze I'm in
When the world divides and opens up, taking me calmly

Low Key,Grand Daddy I.U.,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Ogash
Mister U Dad pon di case
.45 along di waist
Police, snitches gwan get shot in-a dem bloodclot face
Ya see I mean?
O-o-ogash
Watch out

Yo, I'm on the down low, cops wanna know how I'm gettin paid
So they send snitches wired up with hidden tapes
Steppin to me to make a purchase
But I ain't sellin jack, so the trap is worthless
Doin what I do, waitin to smoke me
But I'm all about dough, that's why my flow is low key
You see me today, I'm in a slick black Benz
Tomorrow a hooptie with mitch-match rims
And windows tinted and dark-ass glasses
Drivin around collectin money in masses
When I make my runs, it's done on a q.t
That's how it gotta be when I'm out gettin lucci
I keep it on a quiet storm, word is bond
Makin sure that nobody's informed
You ask is my business legit?
Flip 'low key' around and see what you get
I'm low key, y'all
Yo, I'm in it for the fortune, let the next man have the fame
For 10 long years I been down in the game
I slung when I was young runnin block to block
Sellin cooked up rock, and ain't never got knocked
??? when I used to sport Lee's
And I thought G's how to transport ki's
But one thing I learned from the day I got on
That's when you start tryin to play large you get up gone
Either in jail or your head laid to rest
But I was game tight, cause I learned from the best
To never tell my dirt in the street to no bitch
And don't trust a friend, cause he could be a snitch
I hustle from Hempstead to Queens and Delaware
Cops takin out my spots, but I'm never there
From state to state I sling ki's and g's, and
Blow like the wind and keep on breezin
Take the money and run like a bandit
Leavin the chick I was with at the hotel stranded
Off on a midnight run, fully equipped
A full tank of gas, and a extra clip
Bullet-proof vest, a ski hat to match
Briefcase full of dough, and no strings attached
I'm low key, y'all

Yo, a kid makes a drop, then bounces
With a package that's short 'bout 4 1/2 ounces
So I made a few calls
Now he's scrapin his balls off the projects walls
I went to make his girlfriend bleed
And found her in the alley in the back of a crackspot, o.d.-ed
I shot the bitch anyway
So what if she dead, if I ain't kill her, her ass still gots to pay
And yo, that's word to Miz
Whoever get fast gettin blast, and I don't care who the fuck it is
It could be Jesus Christ
But if he violate, I'm tearin down the gates and shoot his ass twice
I ain't takin no losses
So I'm out to get mine and don't care what the cost is
Yo, I show no affection
I snap necks and then flex in every ghetto section
From point A to point B flippin ki after ki
And then watch the cops watch me
I see em lookin dead in my face
From a third-floor window in a project staircase
But they don't know that I'm aware
See, I knows the drama, and I ain't tryin to get caught out there
So while they actin like spies
My troops is at the backdoor, ready to organize
I tell em wait for the cue
When you hear the horn blow, then go head and do the do
I wave and let the cops know I see em
Flash a mad fat knot, and then hop in a B-M
Now the troops know what's on
So I give the cops the finger and smile and blow the horn
And watch the troops bumrush the door
Ready for war, guns in hand, headed straight for the 3rd floor
Spill they guts all on the steps
The papers read '3 feds found dead and no suspects'
And I'm still in the mix
Slingin mad bricks, puttin chumps in a 226
I wink, and my heart is stone cold
Do whatever it takes to get papes, that's how I roll
And yo, I'm low key, y'all"

Who else really try to mess with Hollywood Cole
Treating Birmingham like my Hollywood shows
I'm tryin' to tell you something that you prolly should know
This that slumdog millionaire Bollywood flow
And ahh, my real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose
I don't get shit confused
I'm not with different crews
We walk the same paths, but got on different shoes
We live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to lose
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls is down to roll
We hit the strip club, and all them girls find a pole
Tell your girl to tell her friend that it's time to go
Tell me today's weather
I know they say they good but trust me I'm better
I sound like the coldest Miami night ever
I'm cold but still hot you can't decide on a sweater
Really this whatever and I am murdering and this is so amusing
If there's a sight to see I am an illusion
I tell you I'm the man baby, what is the confusion
And if they still sleeping on me someone hit the snooze then
Keep sleeping while I sell a couple million
I'm headed for the moon, I ain't bout to hit the ceiling
I'm about to hit the club, women tell me I'm appealing
But fuck what they say, let me tell you how I'm feeling
I'm drinking, these London street lamps got a real glow
Drizzy playin' driving fast but it feels slow
And ask your man, he's a hater baby he don't know
I could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal

I'm what Lebron was to St. Vincent-St. Mary's
But I ain't playin' high school games

The Kids,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
And everyone should get along
Okay, children, quiet down, quiet down
Children, I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day: his name is Mr. Shady
Children, quiet down please
Brian, don't throw that! (Shut up!)
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute while Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia (He's got AIDS!)
Good luck, Mr. Shady!

[Verse 1]
Hi there, little boys and girls! (Fuck you!)
Today we're gonna learn how to poison squirrels
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?)
Say hi, Bob (""Hi, Bob!"")
Bob's thirty and still lives with his mom
And he don't got a job 'cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his twelve-year-old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks (Ahh!)
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said, ""Knock it off!""
But Bob wouldn't knock it off, 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a doctor
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as he chopped it off her
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana
And what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want it—it's bad for you
[Chorus]
See, children, drugs are bad (Come on)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (Ask him, man)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (That's right)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will)
So kids, say no to drugs (That's right)
So you don't act like everyone else does (Uh-huh)
And there's really nothin' else to say (Sing along)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

[Verse 2]
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?
Fuck, no! You ain't seen it! It's the size of a peanut (Huh?)
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
Ecstasy—it's the worst drug in the world
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached, or it'll attack every bone in your back
Meet Zach: twenty-one years old
After hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
And decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys
And the peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Suddenly, he starts to convulse
And his pulse goes into hyperdrive
And his eyes roll back in his skull (Blblblblblb)
His back starts to look like the McDonald's Arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal, barfin' (Bleh)
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
""Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!""
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing
Except maybe wasting their money
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels, class, 'cause it's bad for you
[Chorus]
See, children, drugs are bad (That's right)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (That's right)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will)
So kids, say no to drugs (Don't smoke crack)
So you don't act like everyone else does (That's right)
And there's really nothin' else to say (But umm…)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

[Verse 3]
And last but not least, one of the most humongous
Problems among young people today is fungus
It grows from cow manure; they pick it out, wipe it off, bag it up
And you put it right in your mouth and chew it
Yum-yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em
And sometimes, you see things that aren't there (Like what?)
Like fat women in G-strings with orange hair
(Mr. Shady, what's a G-string?) It's yarn, Claire
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?)
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops, did I say 'magic mushrooms?' I meant fungus
Your tongue gets all swoll up like a cow's tongue
(How come?) 'Cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!)
See, drugs are bad, it's a common fact
But your mom and dad know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!)
But don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and you go and OD
They're gonna come for me, and I'ma have to grow a goatee
And get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my fault
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 'cause I'm bad for you
[Chorus]
See, children, drugs are bad (Uh-huh)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (Put that down!)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can ask)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (And she will)
So kids, say no to drugs (Say no)
So you don't act like everyone else does (Like I do)
And there's really nothin' else to say (That's right)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

[Outro]
Come on, children, clap along! (Shut up!)
Sing along, children! (Suck my motherfuckin' dick!)
Come on, clap along
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!)
So don't do drugs! (Kiss my motherfuckin' ass!)
So there'll be more for me (Hippie! Goddamn it!)
(Mushrooms killed Kenny!)

Now I drop guap just to bop in the cab home

Llamas, commas
Catch me watchin' hella Telenovela dramas
With dizzyin' effects and bright colors
Roll around town with a bright crew of brothers

Uh-huh SLAB Ent, boy Good lookin' out Chuck
Pulled up to the hand car wash like blaow
Just the outside my nigga gone wipe me down
Know I gotta couple dollars for you when you done
Roll the window back up, roll the blunt, cut UGK back up
Cut the AC back up, gettin' kinda hot in here
Benihana leftover, weed smoke, and I'm in here
Let me volunteer to get you niggas minds right
Getcha funds up instead of chasin' after limelight
But since I'm all good I might go and see what's good
With these pretty girls for one night
So I whipped around to the spot I knew was poppin
Parked then we hopped out and hopped in, no problem
Soon as we got in eyebrows raised up
I'm Mr. Taper Fade Cut whip the Escalade truck
In the party lookin for Ms. Not-Too-Bougie
With a booty and know how to roll doobies and do me

Bitches think I'm living out my car
All these shoe boxes and shit
Don't confuse it boo, this stuff I just bought
Before I came to scoop you
Coulda dropped it off, but I wanted you to see it
Confident but not conceited
Yeah, I like my grapes and my weed seedless
Gettin pussy with my fathers features, believe it
If you missed it, then I bet somebody out there seen
It, TwitPic my outfit, bitches stalk my comments
Jets fool
What they say I can't do first on my list of things to do
If the broad got wireless at her crib I fall through
Got e-mails to read, as she break down my tree
Reach my cell phone, turn the TV down for me
It was kinda ironic, cause I had the papers
She had the chronic, the Hornets beat the Supersonics
Inhale the vapors from the smoking volcano
I'm thirsty need some Waterboy, Captain Insano

Aye, in this lifetime you only get richer or not
So hoes jump for my balls like they tipped off the rock
I get it from my dad, guess I'm a chip off the block
Now I'm up in Cleveland to grab Chip off the block
Now whip off the lot with a bad bitch, ass thick
And tits so I slipped off the top
Yeah, Bitch I'm the man, forever gettin' chose
I party everynight and it's never gettin old
The story of your life is probably never gettin' told
Them tickets to your show is probably never gettin' sold
I might just cop some shit from Somerset
New York to LA, I beat the sunset
Your girl show me L-O-V-E I dropped the O and E and just took the LV

I go ""Hard in Da Paint"" you can tell that on sight

I Was Stabbed By Satan,K'naan,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
One two, one one two

[Hook]
I was stabbed by Satan
On the day that I was born
I was promised lovin'
But instead I was torn
Na, na, na, na, na, na
My heart bled tears
Na, na, na, na, na, na
My eyes shed tears

[Verse 1]
A poor black ghetto child
He can't shoot and he can't go run a mile
There's no school and the kids go runnin' wild
The police and the courts wanna run him out
He's so cold and the po po hate 'em all
He ain't seen his daddy since back in '84
But oh well, so it be, now he's in jail
His mother's stressin' just to get him out on bail
Now sing it out
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
So the story goes on
There's no glory
And the worry takes a toll on
His whole body
But his buddies wanna roll on
It's all bloody
When the cops come to a stop
The police with their big Glocks pull 'em out
They say ""freeze"" but there's only one comin' out
There's two dead with a legal gun to his head
It's stupid, he shoulda played ball instead
Now sing it out

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So why do kids cry when they born?
Ever ask yourself that?
Well, it is said that Satan stabs a child at birth
As an introduction to pain
You know, welcome to the world right?
So one day when it's all said and done
My life will be the bluest rap song ever sung
My verses will be curses to the rich
And all sorts of authority will cease to exist
My daughters will be free of wars in my honor. Your fist
Will raise in the air
Like the silence of revolution
My face will appear
Like the vision of a prisoner with his last beer
This song is a poem and this whole poem is a tear
Dropped to your ear

Hey, Kyu!

It's a broke day but everything is okay (It's okay)
I'm up all night but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretendin' I belong here (Belong here)
It's a broke day but everything is okay (It's okay)

One day I plan to be a family man, happily married
I want to grow to be so old that I have to be carried
'Til I'm glad to be buried, and leave this crazy world
And have at least a half a million for my baby girl
It may be early to be plannin' this stuff
'Cause I'm still strugglin' hard to be the man, and it's tough
'Cause man, it's been rough, but still I manage enough
I've been taken advantage of
Damaged and scuffed, my hands have been cuffed
But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff, or plan to give up
The minute shit hits the fan and erupts
I'm antein' up, double or nothin'
I've been troubled enough and I'm sick of strugglin' and sufferin'
See, my destiny's to rest in ease
'Til I'm impressed and pleased
With my progress I won't settle for less than cheese
I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call
Way before my baby is able to crawl
I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates
To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
I see the golden gates to Heaven on Earth
Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you're steppin' on turf, Kyu

It's a broke day but everything is okay (It's okay)
I'm up all night but everything is alright (It's alright)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm goin' for broke, gamblin' and playin' for keeps
Every day in the streets, scramblin' and payin' for cheap
Prayin' for sleep, dreamin' with a waterin' mouth
Wishin' for a better life for my daughter and spouse
In this slaughterin' house
Caught up in bouts with the root of all evil
I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
And make 'em do shit illegal for these Grants and Jacksons
These transactions explain a man's actions
But in the midst of this insanity, I found my Christianity
Through God and there's a wish he granted me
He showed me how to cope with the stress
And hope for the best, instead of mopin' depressed
Always gropin' a mess of flyin' over the nest
To sellin' dope with the rest
I quit smokin' cess to open my chest
Life is stressful inside this cesspool
Tryin' to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel
My little brother's tryin' to learn his mathematics
He's asthmatic, runnin' home from school away from crack addicts
Kids attract static, children with automatics
Takin' target practice on teens for Starter jackets
I'm usin' smarter tactics to overcome this slum
I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
It's cumbersome, I'm tryin' to do well on this Earth
But it's been hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth
[Chorus: Eye-Kyu]
It's a broke day but everything is okay (It's okay)
I'm up all night but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretendin' I belong here (Belong here)
It's a broke day but everything is okay (It's okay)
I'm up all night but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretendin' I belong here

Ah
It's okay
Yeah, it's alright
Even though I can't sleep
Ah, yeah
It's okay
It's alright
I can't sleep

Or maybe it's that 'tron cause I sure do have a buzz
Baby either way I'm throwed and I am on a mission
So if your ears a virgin I'd advise you not to listen
Cause this shit isn't kosher and this shit isn't Christian

Whatever, something
Not just about money

Been on the battlefield

An other session, I accept it

Similar to rams
We interlock, I penetrate
Seems it can happen to any men, to violate
The violence, we shouldn't tolerate
I get, annihilate all of the petty shit
Be wide awake

The vibrations
We always show respect
And be on the down low
Altough some come for test

Follow me down

On every continent there is an other tradition
Never wanna strain in a corrupt prison

Brother, brother, brother, Lucien, you're like no other
Listen very close 'cause I don't like to boast
Instead, I'll tell the tale of a French who prevailed
Through the Mr. Crazy Rabbits who were always on his tail
We ain't on sale, your rumor starts to wail
Get caught with stolen goods and you will go to jail
If you go to jail, then who will pay the bail?
Deport you back to France on a ship with a sail
Escargot, Lucien, you eat snails
(Hey yo Tip, what's wrong with snails?)
From the Zulu nation, from a town called Paris
Came to America to find liberty
Instead of finding pleasure, all you found was misery
But listen, Lucien, you have a friend in me
Oh, luck-luck will drive your butt batty
Next time you get some wheels, make it a Caddy
In terms of doing good, I know you wish you really could
But listen, brother man, I really think you can
Succeed with the breed of the brothers on your back
It's the creme de la creme, and you can vouch for that
It'll take a minute, rice, so take my advice
Trust in us, and thus you trust in your life

Sold you a paper bag, guess he saw you comin'

Only had 20, he was livin' like ya slummin'
Gave him the money, well, I thought that was somethin'
Lookin' like a kid who was lost in crumbin'
Don't worry about a thing, I won't get specific
This is a song that is long and prolific

You try too hard, is that the answer to the riddle?
Instead of doin' so much, why don't you do just a little?

In fact, it would be nice if we understood him, right?

I'm just saying
Wipe your feet off before you step in the door
Been banging since '94
You didn't but now you know
Them bitches hitting the floor
Them switches hitting the floor
Them swishes is good to go
And that purple off in your throat, so, yo
You ain't noticed, this how we ride
And we can take this liquor outside
Recognize

Where to Now,Drake,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Drake talking]
Okay...
There comes a time...
When you gotta be like
You know, I've come this far on my own, done a lot for myself
Where to now, you know?
But I just—I just tell myself this one thing

[Verse: Drake]
It was worth it, it was all worth it
And by this time, I understand that I ain't perfect
There ain't a pair of Louis shoes I ain't purchased
And I was on some shit, but they served they purpose
And I got verses, I got verses
My sixteens should be arriving in hearses
They get bodied, you see how I murk this
I switch flows much as my girl switch purses
Yeah, Heartbreak Drake, I'll put it on your wife
If I put it in a verse, then I put it on my life
Liquor that's over ice and denim that's overpriced
And tryna make all my goals for the future come overnight
Go—Go—Go—Goddamn, how time soars
I'm tryna get that house in Toronto with pine floors
Come over, watch a season of Flight of the Conchords
And I try to put some lotion all over your contours
But ugh, tell me you surfing, let me know you on board
You can't seal up the bottle once all of the Dom's poured
Yes, I swear to God, girl I put it on Lord
I'm tryna show you life through the tint on these Tom Fords
Ethiopian girl, Ethiopian girl
With your long, curly hair and yo' big ass boo-tay
Reading all them pro-Black, pro-female books
Just let 'em, let 'em know that you ain't no groupie
You need a prescription, a vision correction
I'm young and successful, I'm living perfection
And man, if '09 is when I'ma see mine
Being cool ain't enough, homie; I'ma freeze time, like that!"
A Better Tomorrow,Wu-Tang Clan,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'jazz']","[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
Yo, this goes for all my brothers and sisters locked down
For all my peoples incarcerated, for those who ain't make it

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
Yo, in the housing, thousands seen early graves
Victims of worldly ways, memories stays engraved
All my live brothers is locked down with high numbers
The young hunger, blind to these lies, they die younger
In this New World, the Order slaughter men, women and children
Ten feet gates surround the building, keep us sealed in
The projects, lifeless like a Vietnam vet
Constant war, except for threats of enemy conquest
Crooked cops comb my building complex that's in the rumble
Streets are like a jungle, can't let my cypher crumble
Vivid thoughts, Devils resort to trick knowledge
They kick garbage, lust for chicks and quick dollars
I know the pain the game bring, I did the same thing
Spaced out in the staircase, performin' a sting
It's hard to keep control, I bless those who seek a scroll
Tryin' to reach a whole nation and break the sleeper hold
Not a role model, I walk a hard road to follow
I sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels
The gospel was told, some souls it swallowed whole
Mentally they fold, and they eventually sold
Their life and times, deadly like the virus design
But too minute to dilute the scientist mind
[Chorus: Inspectah Deck and Masta Killa (Both)]
You can't party your life away, drink your life away
Smoke your life away, fuck your life away
Dream your life away, scheme your life away
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
A voice cries from the wilderness of the North
A representation of the families that lost one
All victims of incarceration
Or other divisions of the family structure
Youths are injected with serums that leads to skin irritations
Babies being born with disfigurations, experimentations
On their faces, there bear worry-ations
Of mothers that carry the pain
Of blood stained streets where sisters mourn and wail
Fifth brothers been slain from hails of gun fire
It lightly begins to rain
Screams of terror are hidden by the passin' trains
This can't be little Hussein
His uncle cries as he drops to his nephew's side, holdin' his cane
Just give me a name
Of who has inflicted this bitter sickness, and left us to witness

[Verse 3: U-God]
Yo, curses from war, innocent blood spills for days
Soothe in godly ways, hands, solemn in praise
Tree of life, more precious than rubies, golden game
The wise shall flourish inherit, Halls of Fame
Crime visions in my blood got me locked in prison
While we die, hard-livin' people whine about religion, vision
Blow, spin, and sin and killin' what's revealin'
It's a never endin' battle with no endin' or beginnin', listen
Zero process, progress, become the hunted
America's most wanted, good life, flaunt it, want it
Some love the speed, some satisfy a need
Some wanna be down, young gun seed, jungle breed
The strong must feed, someone die, someone bleed
One flew astray, and it caught my little seed
Can it be? The ice savage, trife life, made me grab the knife
The righteous man was beat with many stripes, pipes
Take in my energy, breath and know the rest
'Cause the good die young and the hard die best
[Chorus: Inspectah Deck and Masta Killa (Both)]
You can't party your life away, drink your life away
Smoke your life away, fuck your life away
Dream your life away, scheme your life away
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way

[Verse 4: RZA]
Y'all bitches love dances, and pullin' down your pants
While your man's on tour, your spendin' up his advances
Your friends ain't shit, all they do is drink, smoke, and suck dick
The whole projects is trapped in six
You either high school drop-outs, one to three cop-outs
Fifteen years old, shorty ass and top out
Ninety-nine cent beer drinkin', pussy stinkin'
Fuckin' so much, your ass and titties start shrinkin'
New World Order slave trade, minimum wage, Medicaid
Can a devil fool a Muslim nowadays?
Inside my lab, I'm goin' mad
Took two drags off the blunts, and started breakin' down the flag
The blue is for the Crips, the red is for the Bloods
The white's for the cops, and the stars come from the clubs
Or the slugs that ignites through the night, by the dawn early light
Why is sons fightin' for the stripe?
[Verse 5: Method Man]
As we dwell through this concrete hell, callin' it home
Mama say, ""Take your time, young man, and build your own
Don't wind up like your old dad
Still searchin' for them glory days he never had""
So many bad want to scheme for American dream, no more kings
The cash rule everythin' now, we goin' down
These babies lookin' up to us, it's up to us
The Million Man March MC's, get on the bus
But envy, greed, lust and hate separate
Though the devil mind state blood kin cannot relate
No longer brothers, we unstable
Like Cain when he slew Abel, killin' each other

[Chorus: Inspectah Deck and Masta Killa (Both)]
You can't party your life away, drink your life away
Smoke your life away, fuck your life away
Dream your life away, scheme your life away
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way"

Domicilium,Thomas Hardy,[],"It faces west, and round the back and sides
High beeches, bending, hang a veil of boughs
And sweep against the roof. Wild honeysucks
Climb on the walls, and seem to sprout a wish
(If we may fancy wish of trees and plants)
To overtop the apple trees hard-by

Red roses, lilacs, variegated box
Are there in plenty, and such hardy flowers
As flourish best untrained. Adjoining these
Are herbs and esculents; and farther still
A field; then cottages with trees, and last
The distant hills and sky.

Behind, the scene is wilder. Heath and furze
Are everything that seems to grow and thrive
Upon the uneven ground. A stunted thorn
Stands here and there, indeed; and from a pit
An oak uprises, Springing from a seed
Dropped by some bird a hundred years ago
In days bygone--
Long gone--my father's mother, who is now
Blest with the blest, would take me out to walk
At such a time I once inquired of her
How looked the spot when first she settled here
The answer I remember. 'Fifty years
Have passed since then, my child, and change has marked
The face of all things. Yonder garden-plots
And orchards were uncultivated slopes
O'ergrown with bramble bushes, furze and thorn:
That road a narrow path shut in by ferns
Which, almost trees, obscured the passers-by

Our house stood quite alone, and those tall firs
And beeches were not planted. Snakes and efts
Swarmed in the summer days, and nightly bats
Would fly about our bedrooms. Heathcroppers
Lived on the hills, and were our only friends"

Yeah, Scott Storch

[Verse 1: The Game]
Yo, I'm hopping out a Phantom with a iced out medallion
Stallions on both arms, rocks on both charms
My Dominican chick looking like Scarface sister
Red and curly and she wake me up early
Cause hustlers hit the block when police change shifts
New York, California, different toilet, same shit
In Brooklyn I rock Timberlands, still toast cinnamon
Been gangster way before he dropped Many Men
Liquor in my system, voice raspy
Who I sound like? Don't ask me, that's my nigga, we classy
Him and Montega Jada our style superior to haters
You can catch me in the latest Marvin Gaters
Ralph Lauren suit tapered up, fly cause I'm papered up
Why these niggas keep hating on my Phantom?
I be out in Atlanta and body tapping, I'm probably strapped
Toast it up niggas
[Hook: Chrisette Michelle]
All my hoods on the real dark side of the track
No sunny skies, just really black
We live real down here, Lord let us live
No playing around here, Lord let us live
Don't hate my hood, just hate my shine
We coming out, we on our grind
We live real down here, Lord let us live
We coming outta here, Lord let us live

[Verse 2: The Game]
Now who the fuck want war with the human gun store?
Gangsta rap is where I live just knock on the front door
Niggas stunt more than Jackie Chan, what the fuck them faggots saying?
Nothing when I walk in the club with the gat in hand
Take 'em back to '94, shooting out a Astro van
Banging was the blueprint, money was the master plan
Duffel bag full of Grants and Franklins
Rob niggas, take they money, shoot straight to the bank then
Head to the barbershop to get chopped up
Hearing war stories who dead and who locked up
Who snitching, who pitching and who knocked up
Fuck niggas in Black Wall Street I trust
Black hoodies and black Asics standing on the pavement
Hustlers don't sleep nigga we work the grave shift
Fuck that long money, nigga, get paid quick
And don't save shit
[Hook: Chrisette Michelle]
Ohh, all my hoods on the real dark side of the track
No sunny skies, just really black
We live real down here, Lord let us live
No playing around here, Lord let us live
Don't hate my hood, just hate my shine
We coming out, we on our grind
We live real down here, Lord let us live
We coming outta here, Lord let us live

[Interlude: Chrisette Michelle]
Lord knows that money don't matter
Lord knows that status is badder
Lord knows about the hood I live in
Keeps taking away but he's giving
Now don't give me these cars (Lord let us live)
Don't give me these mansions (Lord let us live)
Don't hate me, just let me ride
Lord just give me light

[Verse 3: The Game]
I don't hate Mobb Deep or M.O.P, that was a phase
I was caught up in the beef like a rat in a maze
And my legacy will never be that of a hater
Lyrical rhyme slayer, wack niggas say your prayers
It's the return of Gandhi, Criminal minded city behind me
Put it on my face to remind me
Of all the shit I been through my physical presence, my pen too nice
My first album sent you life
I shoulda put down the mic when Rakim left Dre
No cleanup hitter so I was stranded on second base
I had to steal third, motherfucker that's my word
Then some Queens niggas try to put me back on the curb
I was Ultimate Warrior to you bully ass niggas
I will come through the hood with the fully AK's niggas
Like Snoop or Suge, I'm in the coupe, I'm good
Mothafuckas make way

Ohh, all my hoods on the real dark side of the track
No sunny skies, just really black
We live real down here, Lord let us live

Helicopters flying cause niggas аrе dying from semis busting
Mу nigga Hawk told me gο in thе house at ten o'clock
He ѕау ain’t nο future іn thе streets dog this shit is hot
Lot οf niggas don’t advance in life because they dumb as fuck
Onlу one thing on they mind is coming up
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Rіding down St. Clair
High as fuck I don’t care
Floating through thе hood аt night
Crack thе window bless the air
Only puff the best in here
Take away the stress no fear
Niggas sure get mesѕed up here
AK Smith & Wesson yeah
Niggas learn thе lesson here
I'm wiser than the rest appear
I fuck wіth thеm professors here
Want O.G. gеt thе message see it
That's that type οf shit that be
On mу mind while I bе
Zoning rolling blowing trying to percept this reality
Ladies look аt mе lіkе I сουld take thеm tο thе fantasy
I take thе tο thе liquor store tеll thеm get some Hennessey
Then we to the crib see what she can do and all that
If she got a cold swag baby I’ll call back
I don't trust these hoes they set you up fast jack
Niggas at your head thеу find уου where уουr stash at
Best thing to do is chunk a deuce when I roll through
And try to stay true cause that's what real niggas do

Slaughter,"Royce da 5'9""","['hip hop', 'r&b']","I'm from a grimy city from a bunch of miles away
With no regard for the laws, I'm from a sovereign state
From a murderous block, swirvin' in a convertible drop
Making sure you heard my proverbial plots
I'm tryna take over the world like Pinky the Brain
My dream mistress is a bitch like Pinky with brains
Or Roxy Reynolds, I'd stick dick into her
She suck cock for a living, tongue kiss with Murs
But I don't feel anger
So like the frame of the nickel plated chrome 4-5
I'mma still bang her
Original renegade niggas still afraid
More niggas follow than Ashton Kutcher's twitter page
Chowder time, ya'll write, I sprinkle powder lines
If Kelly beat his case, my lawyer gon' swallow mine
So put your nines on the crap table
You life gambling I'm Patrón sippin', signed to Black Label
Champagne wishes become realities
Bad bitches fly minus the travel needs
My dick is the biggest thing on my anatomy
I diss niggas for nothing like why you mad at me?
Nickel is definitely still reckless
The last nigga got killed and made me feel threatened
Who really cares what a rapper talkin'?
The only feeling that ain't familiar is after losses
I shoot Edo G in the head and go back to Boston
With a trunk full of white, we call it Asher Rothin'
Feel honored if I talk about your ass often
You should wanna sleep in the bed I was jacking off in
It's a reason these muthafuckas is backin' off him
He Floyd Mayweather, Paul Williams, and Chad Dawson
All rolled up in one his money trash talkin'
Amongst bosses chillin' out in the cash office
Nigga, you testin' the one, nickel second to none
I'm hotter than Texas at three, I'm affecting the sun
I don't just sound raw
I'll disconnect your shit have you walking around with Bobby Brown jaw
And then Whitney say crack is wack
And it offended me like, Fluzey why you dissin my music?
And you can ask Proof, we come from Chopper City
Minus the wack suit, and the beef with Ness
Forever in hell and the smell of that sweet success
That calico talkin', sayin, ""We the best!""
I'm a fair teaser
This bitch said, ""Who the fuck died and made you God?""
I said ""Jesus.""
I'm in the zone I feel like a star
And nigga you know what to do if you feel like a fraud
Go on jump in that traffic, you playin' Frogger
I ain't no blogger, I'm Mister Rearrange Your Aura
Niggas thinking all I got is internet soldiers
'09 is the fear year, respect's over
The OG's taught me how to do it one way
So I ain't down for no games unless its gun play
Niggas'll murder judges, over murder grudges
I don't put money on heads I just refer to cousins
I drop dope records that's hot like a furnace
The needle on that record player is hypodermic
Receive food from a intravenous tube
Kill your ass in private between me and you
I'm sick enough to go up in your house
Sickening rhymes, I spit 'em and throw up in my mouth
You fuckin' round with the Slaughter House conglomerate
Like catching your parents fucking, I'll leave you traumatized
A beef live till the drama dies
My daughter could get struck by lightning if I ain't down for homicide
You don't believe in me you a atheist thug
My bitch pussy delicious as the Flavor of Love
Fuck what they say
I'll tattoo your face, Danger but it ain't for the love of Ray-J
I got her card hard, I call my penis ""Dicky""
Before I let you bullshit me, I let Serena kick me
And she got thunder thighs
I could just be so heartless and give you the business but I ain't from the Chi
A product of the Borris where Barry Gordy records
I'm talking A.1 Yola, that's totally pure
I flow bodies of water, dead fishermen haunt me
I got the temper of a trigger, the dick of a donkey
I'm a Soulja Boy, yeah I'm the last breathing
No need to turn on my swag, come on, I'm swag sleeping
Ya'll niggas flows is old ya'll sound like last weekend

I'm very instrumental, to any instrumental
You ain't on my level my nigga, even a little
You at the bottom, not even at Malcolm in the middle
You homo ass nigga, (shh) go-N eat some skittles
Now hop up on the rainbow try to reach where I hang though
I'm a little further up then and near the angels
So at your highest point you still wouldn't reach my ankles
You are what you eat but that ain't true cause im anal? (eww)
And the people show love like a bear hug
I'm here to last, they temporary call em' haircuts
Fair enough I stand behind my balls like a felon does
If you a boss, meet the executor and when it come to paper, meet the editor
A little better brah you need to step, step it up
I'm on my business that's my forte, you?
You beat around the bush like foreplay
And they anticipating me like a court date
So for the bars Im'a charge like the court say
And if the court say they know I did it like OJ (what?)
Then im in the next city like a tour date
There ain't no I in team but it's in I in win
Ain't no ""I"" in lose but there's an ""I"" in him
Meaning me meaning moi, so beat the repertoire of the upper echelon
That's high, high in the sky, high to the point that I almost saw God. (Wow)
I stand out from the rest like Yao
But ain't gotta play ball to have you cheering
Perform so well I might as well take a bow
Shitting on these niggas' like a movement from my bowels
People wanna know how if feels in the clouds
But I guess they'll never know cause im never coming down
I started with a dream, added a little faith in
Mixed it with adversity and let it marinate
I put it in the oven for a while and let it bake (yup)
Call it food for thought, put it on your plate
A friend of mighty Motown, home sweet home
Where I roam like a phone in the unknown zone
My niggas roam like a phone in the unknown zone
And we condone a tone a money hoes and clothes
And my record sell like a boat load
Fam you couldn't fill my shoes like bozos
And im solo, cause I herd that what hoes really want is a ring like Frodo. (no)

Why they local like they old schools
I should beat them like pro tools

You Must Learn,Greenhouse,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse One] [Manifest]
Most time's ? changes
It's hard to think straight
I struggle with humbleness to become great, yes Fest is me
Take it or leave
Got to get it to receive it
We always say it but do we really mean it?
When the concern for self goes beyond the concern for health
I'm no better than the next man in my pursuit of wealth
And this desire is a part of me
And I got a have it when life decide to charge a fee
Understand, until I'm comfortable, it's all about Fest
Scheme after scheme, my mind will never rest
What a terrible burden to hold dear
But I'm way too bold and proud to show fear
Not that rap is an answer but it damn sure helps
To deal
React when more hands are dealt
And there's
No doubt in my mind I'll survive it
It just may not be when I'm alive, think about it
Never stop movin' up, pushin' on
I aim to be appreciated before I'm gone
Hit the lab everyday, try to write, compose the perfect song
I want the worlds to move a world, for that can I be wrong?
[Hook] [Blueprint]
Life is terminal from start to finish
Forget to watch your back, you'll be quick to get it
Then every turn you take, will be a turn for the worst
You. Must. Learn
This rap music is a part of me
No different than an arm you see
Keep swords sharpened
Radar on for targetin'
You. Must. Learn

[Verse Two] [Blueprint]
Something's wrong
With the way that we live
These gas prices make me wanna stay in the crib
It ain't my fault, it's something that the president did
It's dangerous now, you can't even go play with your kids
These terrorists is wild
Flyin' planes into shit
So what's next?
I heard they wanna take out a bridge
Payback's a bitch
And America got it comin'
What comes around goes around
You can't run from it
Can't fly, can't walk, can't drive your car
Won't bend, won't budge, won't fight in the war
I'll pull a Cassius Clay
Before you ever see me enlisted
Cause nobody Arabic ever called me a ""nigga""
Or made my people live their lives out in fucked up conditions
Looked upon suspicious cause the color that their skin is
But in these other countries it don't make a difference
Cause television got 'em thinkin' all Americans is ignorant
Meanwhile
Back at the ranch
I try to stay out the grasp
Of the unseen hand
Constructing plans to touch these fans
The thing I know I can control is if my music got soul
The Bible says the meek shall inherit the earth
The positions of the rich and poor will be reversed
And I believe that to be true for what it's worth
Because the terrorists is takin' out the rich people first
[Hook]

[Verse Three] [Jakki the Motomouth]
I look around
And all I see is war, disease and hate
Still wonderin' what we tryin' to achieve in space
Tryin' to settle in a spot I can't breathe awake
Ain't even been to Cali yet, why should I leave this place?
For another planet or station
I watch how our secret government panic the nation
And scheme with fate
Terrorist plots
You don't have to care if you not concerned
Don't mind me
You cattle, you don't got to learn
I got concerned when 9-11 came and went
The Pentagon was hit but never showed a plane and since
Then, I never showed the same resentment
You'll never know the pain I live with
I never display it
Only He's who's higher than me know what's goin' on inside of my soul
And that's who it's gonna stay with
We on high alert, I know why now
Cause there's terrorists in our country
And a lot of 'em in the White House {*echoes*}"

I can't believe the weak rhymes, I see get credit
Sounds like some of my shit before I make edits
Fuck makin' it off of idiots that don't get it
And writers who don't understand my life and how I live it
If I said it, I meant it
Unless I've been drinkin' and I'm talkin' to a chicken
But even then I don't act different
Because I don't gotta tell lies to have her let me hit it
You know the lo-cal
South Phil resident
My people pump crack right in front of their parents
A lot of fake dudes died tryin' to be real niggas
I don't have to rap about the streets cause it's a given
My people said, ""Al, you gotta stay off the block
Cause you get good grades and your jumper is hot.""
So I did the knowledge
Went to college
Got a job and then quit that shit
Now I'm back to where I started
Be careful bout what you copy off television
You might C Walk your way into an ass whippin'
Out here it's just fashion
It's real out west
You can wear black and white when you laid to rest
I'm from the O state, no pro football teams
The only thing we only hate is The Wolverines
Shit for them?
Get slapped and you won't do a thing
But mumble under your breath and look at me mean
You punk bitch

Whatever happened to motherfuckers gettin' booed off stage man?
Throwin'-throwin' like, tomatoes at cats
We gotta bring it back to them days
We gonna try to come up as the new New York
On some ole' Apollo shit
And if you wack, and you on stage you gettin' yanked off
Mic cords is gettin' unplugged and all of that. Two thousand and live

[Verse Two] [Blueprint]
Uh ha
See, inside I hear a voice
Tellin' me to stay patient and stand strong
You're destined for greatness
But sometimes
It's so hard to take it
I feel like Ruben Studdard in a world full of Clay Atkins
My heroes started out on some real shit
Got they feet in the door...
Then switched it
But tellin' me to switch it up to make riches?
That's like askin' Picasso to paint stick figures
See
I don't care about rap that much
And in general
I think most of it sucks
But at least I can do the type of music I want
Because I'm always bein' me I don't gotta front
What?
To many guys guys are preoccupied with sounds...scan
But me
I'm worried about my sound...man
And how he got my beats soundin'
We need a lot more bass
So it's poundin'
Slap you in your bumbarasta
My comp got nada
Even my interviews are hotta
I ? man is headed
Cause he told me to drop science, so I had to dead it
Now I drop English and math until you get it
My B-sides and guest appearances are extra credit
I even teach at night for no extra fee
Shit, you paid for the lesson

Tell me of the pleasures of being a normal citizen
Cause all these fittins' at Vivvienne's keeping me from fittin' in
Why do I feel safer on stage than in my own living room

Yeah, no, yea - are we done yet?
Questions you've asked me hundreds, now can you grant me some rest

No way should reflection be mistaken for glorification
Now, I remember so vivid, me and my niggas was livin'
Sub-standard condition, still handling business
Still laughin' and trippin', still having the bitches
I'm rapping now, reminiscing, and goddamn it, we did it
From trappin', standin' & pitchin' with rich we stand in the kitchen
Splittin' it eight ways, flip it in eight days
Thought that wild and unruly was just the way to behave
Kept the weight and the yay', but most the paper we made
In all dimes, I ain't lyin, the pleasure was all mine
Had big work to move, but we served the small time
I always outshined the niggas with small minds
Who woulda thought we'd be arguably the greatest of all time
'Round here? we develop such a sound down here
Been duplicated often, still, can only be found here
Only listen to Gs, that other shit I don't hear
Shit, they so far in the rear, why would I even care?
I'm too busy a player, steering niggas careers
Been talkin 'bout it for years, and now we finally here

Take a look at what I did, but can you imagine what I'm about to do?
The places I'm 'bout to go and the money I'm 'bout to see
Gave Bill Gates some binoculars and said, look out for me
Exceeded expectations, even at Def Jam
Cause I married the streets and Atlanta has been my best man
My momma quit her job and now she works with six figures
Cause I'm a self-made, nappy-headed rich nigga!
Private planes help me travel in peace
To four cities in one day and four countries in one week, 'cause I
Work for myself and no one else cause I'm too smart to
Put one of my partners right through culinary art school
Now he my personal chef, so that bread, he get it
Put 'em all in houses, cleaned up all of my friends' credit (true!)
And now they witnessed all the glitz and the glamour
Catch us eatin' at Straits Atlanta with women with table manners
Ordering Singaporean lobster, celebrating coming from nothing

Cause I'm standin' on top lookin' down at it all
I know from down there to y'all, it seems like I got it all
Homie, I ain't get enough, we still tryin' to triple up
That's why we got StreetCred and Akoo building up
Say I'm doing too much, shit I say I ain't did enough
Remember sayin', ""Damn, if I could just get to a million plus""
And now I'm like, ""Shit, what the fuck is a million bucks?""
Tripled that on my bond thanks to Biggs and Run
But never mind what I been through, just look at what I become
All this shit I've avoided, what I done for my sons
And daughters and momma, just call her, I sold dope
And dropped out of school, seems that's all they can see
They don't notice none of my family did that since me
I broke that cycle, now my family live a life of
Mandatory minimums, but not when the judge sentence 'em
Cousins in college, where you think they get tuition from?
Just from standin 'round wishin, huh?
And while you standing 'round lookin' dumb, I make it happen
Takin' action, over time, got damn good at it

No. 1 Stan,StillAware,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[StillAware]
My vision's rare, warped like reflection in silverware
Seeing through a mic screen everywhere I go, I'm StillAware
With a positive Vibe, till I'm asked, ""Where ya lyrics at?""
Always in my back, pocket dropping only lyrics that, mirror back
My spirit trapped, sitting back with the simple task
To write some chicken scratch
More than just my two cents, I'm throwing my nickel sacks
Like skipping stones, in your dome that'll ripple back
If you're thinking that we get only one opportunity
So many think Eminem is not what he used to be
But stop the scrutiny
Follow Ghandi's advice; and ""Be the change that YOU wish to see""
Because even till this day, Eminem still inFLUences me
No matter what I do
Or in what I pursue
I'm not a secretive dude
And I never mean to be rude
I'm Aware of the drip, and the skin they stick the needle into
It's easily proved even the truth can be injected intravenously through
I'm high, above the bar - I raise it up, I'm saving up, it may be tough
I pay my dues like my debt, but it ain't enough
If you ever feel so low (solo), realize you're not alone
Above the ground is not my home
Underground I often roam
I'm dropping poems, even if it's written, it's still off the dome
But saying freestyle when written is forbidden and not condoned
I'm not an angry fan I ain't a Stan, I'm more like Shady man
Choosing to use this music to prove this' just the WAY I am
Aiming for the same profession
Especially when we're staying in a dang recession
And the path I chose is looking like a dead-end so I'll change direction
Main objective to win but second to gain attention and losing ain't my intention
I make a mark and break apart from the pack with my rap
Try to catch my train of thought but my aim is off of the track
Through higher learnin' I've determined, when I spit in the booth
It might be curtains, it's time we're certain but we're still missing Proof

Futuristic bow-wow
Leader of the pack
Wild dog

Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat?
Just the dog in me
Nothin' but the dog in me

Why must I chase the cat?

Dog in me, dog is in me
Talking dogs, dog's in me

Do the dogcatcher, dogcatcher
Do the dogcatcher
Do you wanna do the dogcatcher?
Well, baby, why don't you do it again for me
Dogcatcher, dogcatcher
Do the dogcatcher

House-trained dogs
Wild dogs
Say it again
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat?"
Its Funky Enough,The D.O.C.,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Y'all ready for this
Rastafara Sonna Madda Fa
Drop the lyrics, a'ight

[Verse 1]
One, and here comes the two to the three and four
Then I drop the beat I have in store
Lay dynamics on the top like a rug
Make it sound smooth and later make a dub
Enunciate well, so that you can tell
I am not illiterate, no not even a little bit
Nothin' like an idiot, get it
You want the record, cool, I'm with it
Let the rhythm take you, shake it cause it makes you
As I turn the knob of the door you escape through
Go in like a knot, don't be a puff
And I let it play cause Dre's getting funky enough

[Hook]
It's funky, it's funky
It's funky, it's funky
It's funky, it's funky
It's funky, it's funky
Dre makes the beats so fun-fun-funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
Watch the smooth lyrics that take place
[Verse 2]
If you want another reason why it must be funky
Yo, I am not a jackass meanin' not a donkey
So I will play the game like it should be played
Drop the funk into the mix so the place will never fade
Ship it to the stations in your jurisdiction
Brothas say I'm dope, and the others think I'm bitchin'
No crowd can avoid the D-O to the C
When I'm P-E-R-F-O-R-M-I-N-G
On the stage, see the simple fact is I am dope
And known, I rock a funky beat without a cord so
It is my conclusion you will enjoy the fusion
And I will ascend with the style that I am using
Knowin' that it's tough and it's not a bluff
I think I'll let it play cause Dre's hittin' funky enough

[Hook]
It's funky, it's funky
It's funky, it's funky
It's funky, it's funky
It's funky, it's funky
Dre makes the beats so fun-fun-funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
Dre make the funky hip-hop music so check it
[Verse 3]
Listen to the kick, drop in with the click
And with no rehearses I'm dropping funky verses
Stupid with the bit that you think you are relying on
You love it when it rattles is the fact that I'm buying on
Suckers never come close cause of knowing
There is no stopping the D.O.C. when I'm flowin'
But in the event that someone will try and juice this
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
I don't give a damn, don't think that I am jokin'
'Cause I don't think he is funny when you're messing with my money
Yo people tell me this, yo Dre, you must stop him
But with no frills, so I just drop him
Continue with the rhyme and make sure I get mine
With no static 'cause I sold an SMG to get my nine, but
Lessons have been learned now all kidding have been fronting
Let it play when the people say, Dre yo, you're getting funky enough

[Hook]
It's funky, it's funky
It's funky, it's funky
It's funky, it's funky
It's funky, it's funky
Dre makes the beats so fun-fun-funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
Deal with the D-O to the C
[Verse 4]
I need a break so I can check around
See who the hell who is sittin' down
I want all chairs off the floor
And if he stands to the wall, show him the door
And I'll kick in the beat to give you something to rock to
To go nonstop to, not have to look at the clock you
Perceive, but can't believe you're being taken
By a beat so cool you start shaking
And shivering, 'cause I'm delivering the answer
Heaven sent if you’re a hellified dancer
You tried sittin' but it just won't work
'Cause the beat is so fresh
Don't even tell it won't be funky enough

[Hook]
It's funky, it's funky
It's funky, it's funky
It's funky, it's funky
It's funky, it's funky
Dre makes the beats so fun-fun-funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
And with the help of the Dr. Dre, kick it

[Outro]
It's getting funky on the mix now, right
It's getting funky on the mix now, right
It's getting funky on the mix now, right
It's getting funky on the mix now
Put it in the needle, and drop it on the one, boy"

What the fuck
I tried, man, I'm back
Peace talks this song (Fuck the drive!)
(I done gotten in trouble again)
Yeah

[Chorus]
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, gonna change
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, gonna change

[Verse 1]
Now the singer Rob calls the police on me
Y'all niggas ran out and copped the CD
See what I discovered is y'all snitch lovers
I might speak, but I don't fuck with nobody
See what Doug, Jimmy & L.A. don't know
These young'uns crossed the line with Hov', I'm letting it blow
Had the papers writing stories like: ""Didn't they know?
This what happen when they made that rapper CEO""
I know, its just a matter of time before the steady hate
Starts to overflow, then the levee breaks
And my conscience go, ""You escaped the RICO
Why throw everything away over ego?""
You paper chasing, they paper hating
Billionaire Hov', you on the pace to make it
Fuck that, exclamation, comma
Quotation's ""I love drama,"" period

I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, gonna change
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, gonna change

[Verse 2]
Smelling like Patron, singing dirty rap songs
Tip-toeing in the crib like six in the morn'
Every day it's the same, I said in Blueprint
That I'd never change, it's just a part of the game
Respect me I'm a thug, I might cool out for a sec
But expect me to bug, it's in my blood
But if my chick leave me she gon' leave me for something
She gon' leave me cause Halle, she ain't gon' leave me for nothing
Picture me getting up with something sleazy
Something, something, so easy
You could take out of Speed like nothing
Soon as you finish cutting, you like, ""leave me please""
Not me, I need Angelina Jolie-zy comfort
So I ain't gon' make a move unless I got a Plan B
That'll happen the day I have a baby by Free
Not to say that anything is wrong with Free
Just to say that ain't nothing wrong with me
If my hand's in the cookie jar, know one thing
I'ma take the cookie, not leave my ring
If my hand's in the cookie jar, know one thing
I'ma take... (*laughs*) y'all know what I mean
[Chorus]
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, gonna change
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, gonna change

[Verse 3]
Unh, you lil' niggas ain't deep you dumb
You niggas ain't gangsta, you gum, I chew lil' niggas
Hock-too, spew lil' niggas
I can only view lil' niggas like lil' niggas
But in lieu of lil' niggas tryna play that boy
I *phew, phew* lil' niggas with the latest toy
Unlike you, lil' nigga, I'm a grown-ass man
Big shoes to fill, nigga, grown-ass pants
Probably hustled with your pops, go ask your parents
It's apparent you're staring at a legend who
Put a few lil' niggas in their place before
Tryna eat without saying their grace before
Blasphemous bastard, get your faith restored
You're viewing your version of the Lord
God MC, lil' nigga, applaud, or
Forever burn in the fire that I spit at y'all
I rebuke you, lil' nigga, the meek shall perish
I'll roof you, lil' nigga, I'm a project terrorist
Cute, you lil' niggas think you in my class
Substitute, lil' niggas soon feel my wrath
I mute you, lil' nigga, you a lil' nigga
I child abuse you, lil' nigga, I'm a ill nigga
Now shoot, you lil' niggas, go somewhere and play
'Cause the day I lose to you lil' niggas, no day
[Chorus]
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end
We're all the same, all the same
I pray to God, Father forgive a nigga
I'm never gonna change, gonna change
I try to pretend that I'm different but in the end

You know Fiya (mhm) there's so many dumb dance songs out here
I figured if we took the dumbest thing we can think of, (yeah)
And put over a hard beat, (mhm) and we still spit real (yeah)
Then people would love it! (mhm, but you go first!)

[Verse 1: Brail]
I turned on my radio and didn't like one track
I haven't seen a bigger ""thriller"" since Mike was black
I mean where the talent at? Only me thats staring back
Cuz I got Aquafina verses and these rappers all tapped
When I come to hear you rap and souljaboy does Tae Bo
Then they wonder why I come and ""Rosa Parks"" at they shows
Cuz I'm a rider, and a writer and they're neither supposedly
I'd rather hear my own eulogy than black eyed peas
Cuz I'm steady doing runs on beats, but I see 'em run out of good songs and get ""weezy""
But I'm rocking while you stopping getting low like where you jocking, its going down, cuz the game is so sleazy
But its unattractive everything thats new I mean
Cuz dancin like a cool actress, well that just ain't cool to me so (Halle Berry!)

Really rippin' writtens I'm spittin' just like ""big willy""
But I'm free from the bull, whip-pin mc's
No empty scripts a full clip...watch me squeeze
(YAAAH!) Get out my face before I turn your swag off
Your dougie ain't fresh if your dead and gone
Give you a ""Tip"" facing me ain't a game
Cuz you ""marco polo"" brothers are blind to the fact that your lame so

Cool Beans,Fiyablasta,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Verse 1:
Pick up the hot-n-ready masterpieces (pizzas) of the Little Caesar with a Napoleon Complex
Yep Full Control Castro Flow to get you shaking like siezures
Sieges with granduer greater than Alexander
Plus my noggin is never Stalin (stallin') not a common
Neglector of lectures got good Marx (marks) in school
Where it's cooler to ruler cuz you learn
About my feats unless you're Beuller
You Nerd! is what I heard but I twist the word
Never Ending Rapping Dario (NERD) ain't amateur
Most concur and prefer to play my records
Cuz you wreck less than the best yes it just occurs
I'm the current record holder of the most wrecked currs
On a record and that's without a curse word
Ain't that foul. (fowl) I'm flyer than ya'll bad hens
No match just fried by the dragon Cool Beans

Verse 2:
I takes intellegence and cleverness to make an old phrase relevent
In the present while making prevalent he's hard like sediment
Cuz that sentiment has to get in it while it's wet cement
Or it won't be evident like a mute person's impediment
So he'll embellish it while wrecking it effortlessly while you're checking his
Method of leaving a mess of emcees breathless
By constantly besting them and testing them to bring their freshest
Cuz profressionals aren't getting him to start sweating them
It's next to impossible to stop the dude cuz any obstacle
He's popping through he'll knock a fool right out of they socks and shoes
Just like shocking news he's gotten views around this rock so blue
And green he's stocking too cuz he ain't flopping soon
He's just dropping tunes that you're bobbing too fly like robins do
Or a cockatoo kill it like a rock'll do
So let me offer you this option to use this opportune
Time to autotune in or out. You Choose Cool Beans
Bridge:
Oops I'm spilling it bet ya'll feeling it
Cuz it's that food for thought
And I know you hip hop heads get what I said
Cuz Cool Beans what I drop

Verse 3:
I drop Knowledge like the endings of ebonics for my fix
Hook on phonics since I found it increased my economics
And for kicks that be fien'ing. My love for hip hop is they drug
Plus the world would give the Ke$ha (Cash up) once they unplugged
From the Matrix playlist and I'm just the one to do it
But the foolish mixed up saying I'm too Neo (NE-YO) with the music
""So Sick"" when I ""Buss it Baby"" if you ""Come Closer""
You'll go to bed ""Mad"" fast Life's over
So ""When You're Mad"" you'll say, ""It's All Because of You""
And if you make that rubbish and touch this, you're through
Ew! My illness got you terminal
Felt ""Superhigh"" till them flu-symptoms let you know that you're turning for
The worst cuz you're already departed
And now arriving to your final destination: Uncharted
But My art stays on top like the Sistine
Cuz I drop beans Every hot sixteen

[Bridge-2x]
Oops I'm spilling it bet ya'll feeling it
Cuz it's that food for thought
And I know you hip hop heads get what I said
Cuz Cool Beans what I drop

Cool Beans from the Humean (Human) Being
Cuz it ain't humane what I do to these lames

The rest know I'm hot. You can't hold these fresh flows"

Boom Skwad in the house

I lower da boom when I do the cypher dance
With naps and saggy pants as I romance the plants
I take puffs on stuff, rough enough to give a buzz
To my cuz, even though he don't touch the stuff
See this blunt in my front, some say might stink
But yo the skunk helps me think
I'm a boom smoker joker with the knack because I'm gifted
Some say misfit, but fuck it let's get lifted
I get a box of 50, get nifty with a spliff G
And tick tackle new jacks who tried to diss me
I've walked through the rain for dimes at the sess spot
Not hot with cops, cause I'd hate to get popped
I'm a terror to a trey bag, son you'll soon see
But I gots to get, higher, lower the boom G

Lower da boom, you got to lower da boom

*inhaling* Ahh, I just catch the fumes
I consume, bend the room, with the Nubian tune
Spark another L for the cypher
Sit back and light the, five inch adventure that's alrighta
Lower the boom, for the sess bags thicker
One's a flight to Phillie, while the other one's the liquor
Off to the weed spot, the bags better be fat
Or else you catch the speed knot, and holmes you don't need that
Spark the indo or the L, sniff the weed
But I never get splits mista cause Tame's been hip ta
The baby of the blunts, so I'm down to catch the contact
Here's the rap chat, it's a fact that I react
Smooth from the boom consumed a zoom zoom a zoomin
MC El the leaner cleaner thoughts dials tune-in
Into, the matter roll the blunt bunt batter
Pass the shit quick, don't flip, with the chit chatter
I never puffed cause once my lungs got jammed
My man said it wouldn't kill, but I choke, god damn
The sess starts to cloud the room
The Artifacts, commences ta, lower the boom

Ohh I hope I live to see the day they make it legal
So all the people can see what I'm smokin ain't evil
Stop callin me a pusher cause I take pulls and take tokes
Cut snakes, cut breaks, and I hate fake folks
So pass the cheeba senorita cause I need a
Fat fuckin Phillie just before I funk a freaker
Creatin from a milk crate with hooks and riffs
I can lift em, and shift em makin jams like this
With the blunt in my left hand and the Phillie in my pocket
MC El, at my right, with the mic so I can rock it
Sess makes my eyes red, but shades only cost three bills
In Hooterville, so I'm chill
See the bigger the blunt, is how I feel about my indo
Because my moms would never throw my shit out the window
I puff herb til noon, chill and watch cartoons
Yes once again, I lowered the boom

[Both]
Are you weeded?
[El Da Sensai]
Nope see, I'm doper for the session
Catchin wreck, check the tec, cause I'm sober for the sketch
If I'm caught smokin blunts, I catch a bad one from my clan see
I'm higher than a messiah so you know I'm handy dandy
Legalize it holmes cause the zone's gettin bigger
From the whites, to the Ricans, cause
They learned it from the niggas
So who's the first to kick it real, for the, cypher
Eight Phillies so you know you gots to pass the other lighter
Pass the incense gents, it smells out in the hall
My growth was never stunted cause I'm six feet tall
No need for the sheepa cheeba cleaner than, Beaver Cleaver
Though I'm down to pitch, with my skit like Tom Seaver
Either, or my jaw speak of true features
I must be, the freaker of the sober class teacher
So pass the Visine, so you can keep your eyes clean
Look to Looney Tunes, we lowered, the boom

Take what you want, take what you want
Take what you want, take what you want
But, you gotta share it with the world"
The Presentation,Drake,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced By Rich Kidd]

[Verse 1]
Shake up the world, that is what I'm about to do
And homie, you ain't even on my altitude
I'm tellin you, I got enough cloud for two
And like a nigga turned Blood, I came out the blue
They like, ""Damn who's Drake, where's wheelchair Jimmy at?""
On my Chris Brown shit, I'm still here, gimme that
I'm cutting lights out like it's bedtime
These other rappers lukewarm like red wine
The truth hurts so please don't rub it in
I'm not signed yet, so I'm still budgeting
I'm like Jeopardy, I'm still buzzin in
Every city that you got a nephew or a cousin in
I miss cake these days
I can't even afford a mistake these days
All of my favorite girls miss Drake these days
Please don't take offense to my ways
Cause I need drug money Who got drug money?
I am talkin ""white Phantom sittin' on dub"" money
I am talkin ""cold champagne at the club"" money
And no I ain't emotional, but baby I love money
To all these A&R's that's playin' stars
Why you gotta act dumb? (dumb)
Your girl know how I beat it like a flat drum
And spit dirty like I'm chewing on black gum
I fooled y'all, ain't shit for me to come back from
[Interlude]
Oh! Yes!
I'd like to take this opportunity
To formally welcome you to this extravaganza
That I call Comeback Season
Hope you enjoy your stay
Drinks are on me, by the way, yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
How the fuck Jay and Dame gon' break up 'fore they meet Drake?
I'm sure it can be resolved, I'm just hopin that they make up
I'm perfecting my craft using more cess
Tryna make some cheese off a single is a process
Get it? Kraft, single, cheese, process
Sit back and admire the talent that I possess
Top notch, no less, oh yes, I'm known in the city
But need to bust out like a model that show chest
Cause you deal with agents from check collections
I'm keepin' it cleaner than Little X direction
And baby girl, if you don't like me, it's prolly due to the fact
That you are les like NextSelection
The city is mine, I control this, you know this
Cause you are nothing like it and I'm so this, the coldest
I'm in Jamaica, docked at the bay, what up Otis?
I'm back with the form like Obus, I go, yeah
And I'mma teach it so you learn right
You can't come on this ride, you need to earn height
With no hydro bill, I let the lights burn out
And after that I take 'em back like returned flights, yeah
You can't miss the boy
Me and Rich united like van Nistelrooy
Bar Mitzvah kid, get your hits destroyed
Cause I keep it under wraps like Christmas toys
No witnesses, no mistresses
This the present and I'm a show you what gifted is, mayne
Keep it real, no other youngin's as hot as me
You a Gucci groupie, my nigga, and I'm a prodigy
What I'm direct for, cause I'm who they check for
I waited for connects while you was playin' Connect Four
You was playin' Uno, I was doing you know
Whatever us rappers do to develop a new flow, I promise

Shoutout to Keepaway

[Verse 1: Heems]
I ain't wavy, man, I'm an ocean
Basic unit of life, Heems is a photon
I'm Don King, I gets my promote on
I'm smooth, you rappers need lotion
I'm amazing, people laugh at my jokes
And hand me they smoke with blunts in the same bag
Pre-rolled, they roll, that's how we roll
All 'cause we rap about weed
I don't do that, dog, I rap about me
And I ain't splashy, I am the sea
I spark grapes, I am the tree
I'm stickball, manhunt, salugi
I'm fourteen, puffing on loosies
I'm nineteen, smoking on loosies
I'm twenty-four, burning these loosies
Used to play basketball, then we started drinking
Used to be thinkin' like a young Dave Dinkins
Like a young Abe Lincoln, in a cabin, I be singin'
You can't smell me? I'm stinkin'
I'm Hindu Kush, I'm Hindu Thug
I'm drugs, I'm drums, I'm dubs, I'm love
So catch the vibe, ride with it
Kids do like fences with our shit: they pick it
Get it? Stick it to the man
Riding with a caravan a mans that's from Pakistan
[Verse 2: Kool AD]
I'm in the future in Hawaii ghostwriting for your favorite rapper
Eating red snapper with grouper
Hanging with Mr. Cooper, opening credits, hopin' you get it
Oakland is proud, look at the dark clouds
Hard, loud, soft and bulbous
Faster mascara snake wet generous
The kid could share a lake, Ellen DeGeneres
Type rug, munchie with a scrunchie
Lotta haters wanna punch me, like a donkey
I’m Eddie Murphy in Shrek I’m complex
I’m Kanye in whiteface on the cover of Complex
Magazine, is Lady Gaga a drag queen?
I'm Sage Francis on the cover of Beyond Race
Pee on face of any R. Kelly groupie
Type-rage against machines on a spooky night
Kookie light do the right thing like Mookie might
Yo! MTV Raps cards on the spokes of my hooptie bike
Others is dookie type, me, I’m loopy type
Living the juicy life; Howser, Doogie-like
Younger brother, I’m in the jungle, mother
I’m in the jungle, Mama

[Hook: Kool AD]
Yeah
It’s really happening
You can see me rapping and stuff
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Break: Lakutis]
Kutis!
With the old Nautica jacket from '96 or something
This shit is fly though
I got the—the white racing stripe only on one side
Get 'em, 12-year-old me

[Verse 3: Lakutis]
All cross color scheme, all across colors teams
Jerseys, you heard me? Timbos all butter bean
Butterface, but her waist move like a snake do
Chetton Hill, salad, three steak dude
I don't wanna snake you
I just wanna copy and paste you
Take you and bathe with you, taste of you
Wait, are you able to give of the flesh like Abel do?
Not able? Cain'll do (True)
Under dig, a feign'll do
(Just like, pretend you know what I'm talking about, you know)
Rock, yabba-dabba doo, cut, swagger dagger do
Swing, Vance, Bagger do, good, pig, that'll do
Captain of this Kangaroo
OG commander of the starship, Pike before Kirk
Life before birth
Light before night, sight beyond sight
Eye of Thundera
Fire burn better, Negra Modela, cardiac arrest-ah
Best of the best, of the best, of the best, of the best-ahhhh

Jesus Christ I'm good please don't cross him
How rude, Stephanie Tanner
You don't gotta watch me but please watch your manners
And the girls I be meeting be Planters, nuts
Saying I should lay down green on a ring like lantern
I been on it for a while, trying to get my spot
Had a lukewarm buzz back when Luke was hot
I been bumping Pink Floyd, all I wanted was my recording label deal
Trying to escape like Cuba Gooding with the flow
First CD out, sold at Sam Goody
Sold out shows, girls trying to get a glitz
Good Will Hunting, got up out of the hood
Now he's coming to America cause that boy good
Now tell me what got two thumbs and knows how to spit rhymes

Tell em open wide when they see how I'm flossing, ching
Cooler than a peppermint
Wayne's World excellent
Party on Garth, shwing
Work ethic harder than a Mexican
That's why I can walk up into any restaurant and close the whole thing
See even G couldn't F with it
Semi colon dash parenthesis, text messaging
That's a side smiley face cause I'mma make the best of it
I assume you should make room for the elephant
Boom, where I come from is irrelevant
‘Cause my glory is all that I revel in
Plus I'm hotter than the pasta that the devil sent
And y'all can just deal with the rest of it
Now tell me what got two thumbs and knows how to spit rhymes
Two thumbs up, you gon point em at this guy

I'm mind shocking, body rocking
Earth shaking, money making
Sitting high, looking fly
I'm drinking on the best wine

[Verse: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, bitch, I fucked your friend, yeah, you stink ho
I seen her on the elevator, honey grabbed my Kangol
She put me on to mega shit, 'bout to slap the bitch
She shot crazy verbal, I leaned back like I'm rich
It took place late night on February 17th
Hands flooded like ink, my face on her magazine
Just got back from Honolulu, pockets stacking beaucoup cash
Girlfriend sipped the Yoo-hoo and laughed, yo
While I was on tour, whore, you went to work
Quick fast, had a nigga dick in the dirt
You couldn't wait just to kidnap the bait of my sperm
Where was you at, ho? ""Pinky house, she put in my perm""
That's all you ever said to me, thought that could hold me
Remember when I long-dicked you and broke your ovary?
You crab bitch, chicken-head ho, eating Harold's
I'm the first nigga that had you watching flicks by De Niro
You gained crazy points, baby, just being with god
Taught you how to eat the right foods, fast, and don't eat lard
I gave you Earth lessons, I came to you as a blessing
You didn't do the knowledge, what the god was manifesting
You sneaky fuck bitch, your ways and actions told it all
I fucked you while you was bleeding, held you down in malls
Sexually, you worshipped my di-dick like a cross
I had you freaked out, broke out, for a month you fell off
You was my main shit, my peeps showed you love on the strength
You saw how I got down, the way I thought had you tranqued
But you had to fuck this lobster-head ass nigga
I should've slapped him, but the gods said, ""Chill""
That's your wiz fault, god, handle that in the lab
I'm wondering how many times your hot ass got stabbed
You dumb bitch, horny hot fuck from out the mountains
Your clientele is low ho, catch you next show, bro
I got jerked, gave away my pussy, that shit hurt
It feel like somebody died or shot your old Earth
But, fuck it, I fucked you on a chair with three legs
Broken tables, had you screaming while you was biting on my cables
We slid to the washing machine and threw it on spin
If your pussy dry, spit on my dick and put it in
My dick's the bomb, baby, marvelous hot steak
Plus, I'm conceited, Starks make the biggest ho call rape
I'm God Cipher Divine, love my pussy refined
That means clean, a FDS smell with a shine

Word up, respect that, ho"
Hell Awaits,Jus Allah,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Jus Allah]
I am deadly
I am into death heavily
Desperately
I am dead presently
Death has bested me
I've accepted Death as destiny;
I have been blessed excessively and effectively
I'm with death indefinitely; I don't have a requisite expectancy;
I don't have a preference or discrepancy
I have dealt with death and its complexity
I have dealt directly with its excellency
I'm selectively in ecstasy

I live in a cramped cell where ants dwell, where the land swells
It's a handy man's hell, damn well!
I don't care for Samwell or Amstel: I like maximum amounts
Half an ounce, blackouts, and Maxwell house
I don't like jazz or Smash Mouth
I don't like playing cat and mouse
I'm a mad house
I am never badmouth'
I am either passed out or dragged out
I am either the couch or the cat house"

Woke up with 50 enemies plottin' my death
All 50 seein' visions of me shot in the chest
Couldn't rest, nah nigga, I was stressed
Had me creepin' 'round corners, homie, sleepin' in my vest
Shit, I'm like a hostage on this troubled block
Call the cops, a thug nigga screamin' Westside
Bustin' double Glocks, hittin' corners in my Chevy Suburban
Liquor got me drivin' up on the curb
Hand on the steerin' wheel, swervin'
Bless me, Father, I'm a sinner, I'm livin' in hell
Just let me live on the streets ‘cause ain't no peace for me in jail
Gettin' world-wide exposure
With a bunch of niggas that don't give a fuck, ridin' as my soldiers

Ask Yak, he'll tell you that it's hell down here
Stale down here, too many jails down here
Why you act like you don't hear me?
Young Noble, Outlaw 'til these motherfuckers kill me
I'm still breathin'

Now, we was raised ""fuck this life,"" my wrongs, my rights
Holdin' on a tight grip, with death in my sight
And the dark is my light, I'm cynical, sleep walkin' as a true
Walk around town with a pound full of bitter food
Came a long way from my born day
Dead away where there's war play
Fuck friends! I'll say, rather die for my A-K
With these fag ass niggas, see-through-glass ass niggas
Only-ride-my-dick-and-the-skin-of-my-mash ass niggas

Talkin' 'bout a bad day—I live a life like that
It's severe, and I'm losin' my hair, bless a hooligan
Catch me, I'm fallin' out flat yo, I'm ruined and
Breathin' in sewer stench, no one give a fuck about me

In the belly of the beast, that's where the fuck we come from

Why you wan' share your food with these niggas?
We don't share food in the recession
Bite these niggas like you bite the microphone

Living legend inside of a Smith & Wesson sliding out of the barrel
I'm fire, don't try me 'cause I am hot
Police cars with they sirens come by when I'm rhyming
Saying they got a call that somebody 'round here done fired shots
MAC-11's in order, the flow is like water
Each quote's a quarter of blow, the chorus is followed by the dot
Goons, goblins and creatures and monsters'll bounce ya
And beat ya and stomp ya and eat ya
Don't get swallowed by the block
I pay a shrink every week to basically tell me
""Lay here and speak to me"" just to say how psychotic I am not
I'm too fly with the viral and physical copies
Niggas sloppy, look up what you under, I'm what you tryna top
I'm scared and compared to no man
I'm like the big hand on Big Ben
I get in and I'm hitting my numbers 'round the clock
I'm 'bout to give it back to my nigga Bus-a-Bus
And have a seat, it's convenient I'm already copping a squat

Take him, gut him and take out his organs and smorgasbord him
The more important he is I'm toe-tagging his beat
Turn him to chicken chowder, dip him in some sniffing powder
Season him with gasoline and throw his ass in the grease
Mention my name in a record, I'ma come get you lyrically
Individually, I'ma take it back to the streets
Cannibalistic mentality, rappers hating
Decapitate him, rap 'bout what I naturally happen to be
Flow is superb and you heard us forget it, two verses
Two murders acquitted, personally it's a wrap, capiche?
Fingers snapping and tapping they feet
Clapping what happened the street
'Bout to happily bring it back to the D
Niggas claiming harder that all of this time
Niggas believe him until I see him and then slap him and see
I ain't having it, havoc is average to me
War's normal, only thing I'm having is having a feast

Royce Da 5'9"", you my dog and I'm your dog
Being that I already sicced you on these mothafuckas
It's your turn to sic me on they ass, let's go

Every time that I marry the rhyme and the beat
I go hairy and grind in the street, then I'm fucking up everybody
Pulverizing shit like we gorillas and peeling your skin
Like we banana peelers, it's hazardous if you copy
Don't you know that I'm one of the coldest, courageous
The boldest contagious, ain't no one can phase this thing that I do
Well, you know since I report the latest
That niggas can't fuck with me
'Cause I'm the greatest, my shit is sick like the flu
You see I'm animalistic, the cataclysmic events
That'll happen whenever I grab the mic and talk
Indeed I'm back and specifically
That I'm hickory-dickory-dock of this rizzy
The diddy bop in my walk
Now I'm the messenger to set the temperature, nigga
Whenever the heat will be needed to hot the block up, I'm saying
I got the Dillinger, Harry Kissinger with the ratchet
The fact is, I'm back with the clack and the click, see I ain't playing

Yo son, whatcha think about those Peas, though?
Yo, yo, I don't know, them dudes just be on stage, dancin' and stuff...
They on some old Las Vegas bullshit
They move too much, man
I can't take them fools seriously
I mean, they ain't talk about no 6-4, no Impalas
They ain't shootin' nobody (Shootin nobody)
They ain't talkin' about clothes
You know what I'm saying?

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
Yo, my man, I got a plan to do it all (What kind of plan you got?)
I got a plan that none of y'all ever
Talked about 'cause underground niggas don't be thinking
I'm going continental like Lincoln
How can you make moves when you're always strapped under
I plan to read the scriptures, tell you more about the thunder
I wonder what really makes the world go round
Not thugs, 'cause thugs go 'round the brain of a brother's down
You be in it for a quick blink, but when you start to sink
You be deeper than you was, when you should've stop to think
About your consequence, your actions don't make lots of sense
Brothers use the wicked life 'cause of lack of confidence
The devil jacked you for your sense now, you can't pay your rent and
That's no accident, you let us slip so we win the rest of your development
You should've took time to prevent the confiscation of your monument
Now ya, wash up, and a nobody
No one blame but your body
You livin' life, had thick and uneasy
You chose to be involved with no deals and crises
In a hole 'cause of lust and greed

We proceed to give you, what (What, what)

Yo, everybody's goal is to win
But others getting caught up within the line of committing sins
And everybody seems to wanna rule
It's so ridicule we gotta find the right cure
We approach to penetrate equivalent and strong
To wash out individual with evil forms
Conquering battles in these fields of greed
Dark faces all around me makes it hard for me to see
Who's got my back and who will backstab
I'm ready for foes and hoes who tries to grab
My currency, if I ain't got none
The shit crip to runs to the ones who got some
The war billows to those who makes action
The main caption is to bring satisfaction
If you like that content you see
How you suppose to call yourself a real MC
So what's the definition of a true MC?
Someone who rocks swell and put my soul at ease
Lyrics went entertaining capability
Now that's the realest, see, all around 360 degrees

Hey, witness grief through startin' material
You are blinded by lights, had an ego ratio
God bless you with the gift of only show
Business but you a careless professional
Is where your failing will show
Over indos and end only cash flows
Makin it big, but yet, you never know
You will pay in your dues bringin' on sorrow
Here today, easily gone tomorrow
Feel the pain and I never borrow
From another man, instead I'm making grand
Watch the Peas as we make a stand

And they'll smoke your ass if you wanna come and chat
That's why some pigs and the kids come sweating they follow
A hollow point shell's hard to swallow (hey)
Why wallow when you come to roll on?
I put the clip in the .45, bring your ass on
Left kicking dust as you hear the gat bust
My cribs surrounded, I'm about to get rushed, I brushed with death
How many shells stuffed in my closet where my big chrome things kept

[Hook]
When the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready (you better be ready)

[Verse 2]
I told the boys get the sawed off Glock and the rest of the gats
As I strapped on the bullet-proof vest
BOOM, I think I caught one to the chest
Hot damn I didn't want to kill a man, shit
I still stand tall with the hill clan y'all better stand back
Niggas bout ta fall, I'm coming out blasting like Yosemite Sam
Got the cheese and the bread for the ham
[Hook]
When the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready (you better be ready)"

They all wanna talk shit but wheres the proof at,if I don't respond than it ain't true
But then that makes you a fool cause I toss and turn and I turn to rap

Real nigga, you can find me where the X is
Whippin' in the kitchen, both hands, ambidextrous

The Most Beautifullest Thing In This World,Keith Murray,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Erick Sermon]

[Verse 1: Keith Murray]
Y'all mythological niggas is comical
The astronomical is coming through like the flu bombing you
And embalming your crew too
With the musical mystical magical, you know how I do
With word attack skills and vocabulary too
Come to hit you with this Edition, it's all brand New
You're through, I'm interplanetarian like Doctor Who
(Who? Who?) So who? (Who?)
Born to get tripped on, word is bond
I'm kicking rhymes 'til the A.M. vultures swarm
Not Quincy, but I'm back on the block and not selling crack
Accompanied with the fat funk flows and tracks
So what you saying black with all that yackedy yack
My artifacts can't be beat with bats
I'm saying, I eat everything up on the menu
And bend you and send you swaying, to be continued

[Hook]
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
[Verse 2]
Spur of the moment opponents is suspects
Caught up in precipitation reign of the tech-
Niques, I speak my concepts freak
The ichi ni san shi funk figures of speech
Now that shit is in the open, I'm open, hoking, scoping
Waiting for the next nigga to get opened on
And break him down like an organic compound
That's the way of the world as the Earth goes round
Now, how the fuck you sound
I represent my clique like a four-pound
You better pack your levodopa medication for the shaking
Meditation from the Earth, that quaking shit that we be making
Never faking I gets down for my crown clown
Shaking the membrane of Encyclopedia Brown
Freaking the funk in any throw down
While you sustained to the sounds, up in you

[Hook]
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya

[Verse 3]
I comes down breaking ground
So back up off of me and sit your ass down
Now when I'm on the microphone I roam through zones
But don't be trying this shit at home
No matter what race, creed, color him or her
I comes cleaner than Jeru and Damaja amateur
As chronical facial disorders occur
I'll assassinate your character's caliber
I channel my anger from the double edged banger
And turn into the microphone strangler
So stop tryna see where your eyes can't follow
Say goodnight to the world and goodbye to tomorrow
You rave and cuss so it's a must you get bust
We're not to be fucked with, Toys Ain't Us
For eternity, through infinity
I internally, get in you

Fantastic Voyage Timber Mix,Coolio,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Come on y'all let's take a ride
Don't you say shit just get inside
It's time to take your ass on another kind of trip
Cause you can't have the hop if you don't have the hip
Grab your gat with the extra clip and
Close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it
Kick it, kick it, yeah, that's the ticket
Ain't no bloodin', ain't no crippin'
Ain't no punk-ass niggas set trippin'
Everybody's got a stack and it ain't no crack
And it really don't matter if you're white or black, I
Wanna take you there like the Staple Singers
Put something in the tank and I know that I can bring ya
If you can't take the heat get your ass out the kitchen
We on a mission
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide slippity-slide
With switches on the block in a '65
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide who-ride
No valley low enough for mountain high
I'm trying to find a place where I can live my life and
Maybe eat some steak with my beans and rice, a
Place where my kids can play outside
Without living in fear of a drive-by
And even if I get away from them drive-by killers
I still got to worry about those snitch-ass niggas
I keep on searching and I keep on looking
But niggas are the same from Watts to Brooklyn
I try to keep my faith in my people
But sometimes my people be acting like they evil
You don't understand about running with a gang
Cause you don't gang bang, and
You don't have to stand on the corner and slang
Cause you got your own thang
You can't help me if you can't help yourself
You better make a left

Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide slippity-slide
I do what I do just to survive
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide who-ride
That's why I pack my .45

Life is a bitch and then you die
Still trying to get a piece of the apple pie
Every game ain't the same, cause the game still remains
Don't it seem kinda strange, ain't a damn thing change
If you don't work then you don't eat
And only down-ass niggas can ride with me
Hop-hop-hop your five quickly down the block
Stay sucka-free and keep the busters off your jock
You gotta have heart son, if you wanna go
Watch this sweet chariot swing low
Ain't nobody cryin' ain't nobody dyin'
Ain't nobody worried, everybody's tryin'
Nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin'
If you wanna have something, you better start frontin'
What ya gonna do when the 5 roll by
You better be ready, so you can ride
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide slippity-slide
When you're living in a city it's do or die
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide who-ride
You better be ready when the 5 roll by
Just roll along- that's what you do
Just roll along- that's right
Just roll along- that's what you do
Just roll along- that's right
Do you want to ride with me, do you want to ride with me
Do you want to ride with me,do you want to ride with me
Do you want to ride with me, do you want to ride with me
Do you want to ride with me,do you want to ride with me"

Unaccountable amounts of dirt, death becomes all niggas

Is that nigga Snoop alright? Ayo what's up with the crew?
Is them niggas in jail, or are them niggas through?""
I said, ""If you ain't up on thangs

'Cause I drops bombs like Platoon
Walk with me, hold my hand and let me lead you
I'll take you on a journey, and I promise I won't leave you
I won't leave you until you get the full comprehension
And when you do, that's when the mission
Or survival becomes your every thought
Keep your eyes open 'cause you don't wanna be caught
Half stepping with your weapon on safety
Now break yourself motherfucker 'fore you make me
Take this 211 to another level
I come up with your ends, you go down with the Devil
Now roam through the depths of Hell
Where the rest your busta-ass homeboys dwell, well

Open and release them guts

Examination of What,Digable Planets,"['alternative', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Butterfly]
One day while I was sipping some groove juice I realized
That in the span of time we're just babies
It's all relative, time is unreal
We're just babies, we're just babies, man

[Verse 1: Butterfly]
Check out, check out
Every man's a planet and the props are there to get it
Insects roll together with the spirit in our orbit
Life, it comes & goes and you do not punch a clock
I don't take shit for granted, I think of Scott La Rock
Also of Tyrel and the battles at the borders
My cousins in the joint and the homeless gripping quarters
The forests are all shrinking, this deepens to my thinking
Don't cover up the nappy, be happy whatcha kinking
Dwelling, yes, you're dwelling as the norm is itty-bitty
Figure eighty-fitty for a smidgen of the city
In the Serengeti, get ready for a box
But beware of the shanks and the pistols and the Glocks
If your peoples don't getcha, you still ain't off clean
The politicians mask is worse than Halloween
I write the funky scripts so you know I got to kick em
Now tell me who's the vics and tell me who's the victim
[Hook]
What is really what is really what is really what
If the funk don't move your butt
And if the box don't make you hot
And if the cats don't dig the raps
If your life ain't got no spice
Or if the guns just wreck your fun
Or if some shouts ain't in the house
Or if your crew ain't down with you

[Bridge: Ladybug and Doodlebug]
Peace, this is Mecca the Ladybug and I'm saying though
What is really what if I can't even get comfortable
Because the Supreme Court is like, all in my uterus
Peace, this is Cee-Know the Doodlebug and I wanna say
What is what if you can't walk through your hood without Bert, Ernie and Sesame Street mosse
Trying to give the Snuffleupagus

[Verse 2: Butterfly]
My father taught me jazz, all the peoples and the anthems
Ate peanuts with the Dizz and vibed with Lionel Hampton
Now I'm swimming deep in the hip-hop with eclectics
Now do we gots the power or is it getting hectic
Scribble swings the paddle at the mantel where I placed it
Hip-hop grew from roots but some emcees never traced it
The old-jacks buckwild and some babies bore their fists
But the crew from outer space is here, shit
We grew up digging styles of the fabulous fifth Freddy
And scoping out for days crazy legs and rocksteady
Now bleach is in the laundry, the same old beats is handy
The label may okay it but radio won't play it
The censors are about so watch your mouth close your drapes
The legs that's in the boots is on the corner, with your tape
Making papes off the crust, for money and for lust
You're playing out the planets get slammed, trust
You think it, see it, run it and slam it
They peep it, hear it, lynch it and ban it
It just ain't the haps if they know they can't control it
Your grass be in the joint but they licked it and rolled it
So what
I'm saying what
[Hook]
What is really what is really what is really what
If the funk don't rule your cut
Or if the streets don't dig your beats
Or if my man ain't fifty grand
Or if the hoods don't think you're good
Or if your church don't really work
Or if the pigs wanna knock your wigs
Or if the jeeps don't roll with beats

All I did was rob and mug on campus
Sliced, rolled dice, got shiest on campus

But one cat said Cam you better recoup
Before you back on your block, baby, dead on the stoop

Until you really, really know
Show me you're right, shine your light
I wonder when will I know

I came up here, finna come down and get me something to eat, take me a bath, know what I'm saying?
Bubba walked over to the phone booth, askin' 'bout the blue flame
I told 'em they ain't got nothin' but some big booty hoes down there
Alright
Ain't no drug transactions being made, I don't sell no drugs
So, so where did he get the crack from?
Boy, I could not tell you that! If I had some crack, I would be smoking it, I use drugs, I don't sell no drugs
Okay, so we gon' take this little 30 dollars then book it into evidence
We ain't got to do that, brother! I sit down and told you I ain't sold that man no crack, I don't know where he brought that crack from!
I had them same 30 dollars that I had when I walked over there, 'cause I'm goin' in my pockets to get my money out and make sure I had change to use the phone!"

Simple as that for your simple ass
Ask about that, pretty simple man
I'm dreaming on good for a sicker plan
Sicker than any other nigga could be thinking, and
I can't be a loser, could've figured that
I can't be a lame, I'm cooler than that
I feel I love the fame, then I hate it back, hmm
Thinking now what I should be Twitterin' (1-2-3)

Dear God, me too, I like the hot bitches
I'll be the underdog, all along, 'til I'm gone

Simple way I wish you would've called it how it should've been
They try to tell me they don't get it, they don't underdig
Now I'll be damned I came this far to let a fool live
I gotta terminate the hate, spread the positive
Without it being wack and cheesy to the little kids
So I curse like a sailor and I smoke weed
I am exactly who an older rapper's kids be
And who they love, hands to the universe
Probably think they drug addicts if they spit a Cudi verse
Mad lil' mama switch to Converse without a purse
Long as the booty lookin' juicy and he stylin' on 'em

So intense he cannot tell his dreams from reality

I'm the motherflippin' Rhymenoceros
My beats are phat
And the birds are on my back
And I'm horny, I'm horny
If you choose to proceed
You will indeed concede
Cause I hit you with my flow
The wild rhino stampede
I'm not just wild
I'm trained, domesticated
I was raised by a rapper and rhino that dated
And subsequently procreated
That's how it goes
Here's the Hiphopopotamus
The hip-hop hippo

[Verse 2: Jemaine]
They call me the Hiphopopotamus
My lyrics are bottomless...
[Verse 3: Bret]
Sometimes our rhymes are polite
Like thank you for the dinner Ms. Wright
That was very delicious, goodnight
Sometimes they are obscene
Like a pornographic dream
NC-17
With ladies in a stream of margarine
Haha yeah
Some margarine

[Verse 4: Jemaine]
They call me the Hiphopopotamus
Flows that glow like phosphorous
Popping off the top of this esophagus
Rocking this metropolis
I'm not a large water-dwelling mammal
Where did you get that preposterous hypothesis
Did Steve tell you that perchance?
Steve

[Verse 5: Bret]
My rhymes and records they don't get played
Because my records and rhymes they don't get made
And if you rap like me you don't get paid
And if you roll like me you don't get laid
[Verse 6: Jemaine]
My rhymes are so potent
That in this small segment
I made all of the ladies in the area pregnant
Yes, sometimes my lyrics are sexist
But you lovely bitches and hoes
Should know I'm trying to correct this

[Bridge: Bret & Jemaine]
Other rappers diss me
Say my rhymes are sissy
Why, why, why?
What
Why exactly
What, why
Be more constructive with your feedback, please
Why, why

Why, because I rap about reality
Like me and my grandma drinking a cup of tea
There ain't no party like my nana's tea party
Hey, ho

That feeling that you giving really drives me crazy
You're dope, have a player 'bout to choke

You lookin' for a girl that'll treat you right?
How you lookin' for her in the daytime with the light?
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night
You expect me to just let you hit it?
But will you still respect me if you get it?
All I can do is try, gimme one chance (Chance)

[Verse]
I’m from the hood where grandparents are 35
I don't bang, I hustle but still I’m certified
Last nigga who shot me, homie, I heard he died
Cause my address is 187 East Murder Drive
All the pain in the my past I gotta verbalize
It can’t stay on my head, I gotta circumcise
My tears drop on the song, they don’t prefer the eyes
A chick left me for that but that was her demise
Money cars and jewelry that shit had her astounded
She searched for the essence of me and bounced when she found it
I’m a complex figure, I’m a never ignorant getting goals accomplished
Grew up in a lot of projects, Loch Ness, hot mess nigga
On a conquest to digest liquor
In a contest to progress quicker
Than any in 2011, by making my thought process sicker
Bigger, stronger, faster
Homie tell me is it a fact
Through negative thoughts you can make yourself a prisoner
If so I call them thoughts some unwelcome visitors
Music is therapeutic, I’ma get help from listeners
I told you on ""Sober Up"", I don’t need therapy right
America’s nightmare carries a mic
And I stay far away from snake fake character types
I vow to never fuck with you like I married a dyke
Keep it real when I make a joint
Streets tried to break me, couldn’t find my breaking point
The other night I had a dream
I seen God he was a beam of light
His physical form was human being like
He gave me a couple of warnings in order for me to keep my life
Can’t tell you what but I can say that he was right
I dream 16's homie, I don't need to write
Pick up a pen in your session, I’m just trying to be polite
Cover my genius up cause rappers are envious
When I say I finished my verse they like “is he serious”
5 minute lyricist with an emphasis on a structure
Plus the details I describe in the sentences (ahh)
Mind you my timing better be live from the Genesis
I bet metaphors and one liners are limitless
First I’m on the West on some menace shit
Then the spit'll be in Italy in a gondola, on some Venice shit
Bars beyond bars has its benefits
I’m Favre, busted chin, fractured ankle
I don’t know when to quit (never)
And old rappers when you see me, don’t say ""Hi""
They call me cause I’m fucking with Shady
I say ""OK Bye!”

This my last letter right here
Fuck this world
Let's get the fuck outta here

[Verse 1]
I put my soul through the ink
Bless a pad with thoughts, add my faults, before I grow extinct
My back-bone disowned by zone
Why roam? Called home, but now on I'm all alone
Just Proof, no shine, no friends, just fans
No wonder my hands tight where the Internet ends
I take back most of the flack
The stress smokes press me close to the crack
Like my pops, the ghost of my past
Thyme and Mudd, Jay Dee and Stuckey
Lately I'm lucky, I don't hate me to touch me
Maybe I'm ugly inside but smilin' to make it
I love y'all, dawg, and that's however you take it
The fame is an illusion, I'm still losin'
In this game, with the rules and I feel clueless
The streets with the hills blueless
Cops knockin' at the door, got me lookin' real foolish
But I still do this, like I love it
Even though I thug it, keep flossin' lights in public
The subject y'all don't know
Stars won't grow, wounded dreams with scars to show
Minus the MTV videos with Slim
""Up in Smoke,"" D-12, and many shows with Em
It's still me, dawg, no change for change
It's strange, when it pours it rains; I take it back
[Hook]
I wish I could take it back
I wish I could take it back, but it's too late
I wish I could take it back
I wish I could take it back, but it's too late

[Verse 2]
Always talkin' to Snook, hopin' he speak back
Wishin' my first son was here to reach at
Feelin' detached; my brother Earl, and Wayne
That bail money for jail, y'all can keep that
I've been deep before, ask Stillman
My heart's meltin', tell the truth I need help, man
My heart's big, but my sins bigger
Fuck the world, I don't feel like I can win, niggas
It's like I'm lost and I find only demons
I wanna quit, it's like I'm tired of breathin'
So my stress confess to a famous song
Em, I love you — don't let this money change us, dawg
First born, when I'm gone, grab Nasaan
Leave Naeem with the cream and his mom
And dear Momma, I used to hate you
Now I relate to everything you did to make Proof
I love you! Take it back…

[Hook]
I wish I could take it back
I wish I could take it back, but it's too late
I wish I could take it back
I wish I could take it back, but it's too late
[Verse 3]
All y'all see is Free from 106 & Park
Y'all don't know I risk my heart with this apart
From the streets, the groups, the friends, the foes
The jewels, the dick lickers and the hoes
What about me? Sheltered with no guidance
Look at the finest, royal highness on some hot shit
Still livin' with the liquor and bud
Sometimes I wish for my demise, so I can kick it with Bugz
I wish it was real between us all
In the past, you should've seen us, dawg
I'd die for Em and save Hailie
Brave maybe, but just let them tears roll off my grave, Shady
Kuniva and Swift, how live does it get?
I meant to teach y'all niggas to survive in this bitch
If we die to be rich, that makes me happy
And on another note, shit, don't hate me, Pappy
It's just that we look the same; you let the game take you
Your son came along and took the game
Since I took my own life, y'all feel a killer for sho'
Bizarre, on the real, you the realest nigga I know
Strappin' and bustin' ain't real, just tell your mans the truth
And that's why you've always been friends with Proof
Answer to all, I've always lied with truth
And before I pull the trigger, Denaun, I'm proud of you

And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes
I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
With trays in both hands, place an order I can cater, uh
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my speech slow
Peep though, when I get fed up, it’s sped up
Riding through the streets, just reclining in my seat hoe
Uh, them city lights is looking brighter, its 3 a.m. in the morning An' the pen is like a lighter
I’m just a writer flaming pages of a notebook, my Rachel McAdams get At ‘em when I ignite her
Yup, soon as a couple plan a trip, you smell gasoline I’m burning All up and down the strip, strip
I done said it, I give you the unleaded, just tip me, if your tank Is empty come get me
[Hook]
Yo, the city is mine  (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!

[Verse 2]
Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard
Mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power
Tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip
And it's a trip, my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections
And it's nothing that I created on purpose
There's people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface, uh
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but
You got a debt and you choose not to pay that
I'mma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh
It ain't a problem of concern bruh
I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
This ain't last year, money like a cashier
So hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line
And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of
And if anybody hatin' on me, I deport 'em, the city is mine boy
[Hook]
Yo, the city is mine  (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!

[Outro]
After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down
After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down
After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down
After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down"

""Who in the hell teaches you kung fu?
Your master must be an ignorant idiot as well!""
(Uncle Ricky, would you read us a bedtime story?)
Nah, kid, but I'mma give you one them old Raekwon crime joints
Feel me? We will, we will
We will, we will—here we go

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Well it was late one night, walking through the park
With my leathered down coat and Wallabee Clarks
Getting my step on, big shit, big six, big wrist
So much excitement in the air, I was crisp
Money suitcase, Louis joint
(yo, Rae, I'mma get some shit just like yours!)
Go make it happen, black God and get rich
Saw the D's fly by, in a New Yorker, yup, tints and shit
They made a right on me, them last two dicks
Know I seen 'em, Max loaded, jog right back to the car
They spun around again and blast their shit
I dropped a Backwood, a puff and then a 6-4-5
You'se a live nigga, you almost smashed your shit
I'mma don my way out the bitch, moving through the car
Nice and slow, two hoodies on and a golden pit
Nigga had a white eye, they both blacked down
What's the clown shit for? The dog jumped in the whip
It was a trained one, wops pointed at me (yo, nigga, freeze)
[Verse 2: GZA]
I told the Chef Raekwon, pump the brakes
Slow it down, you know these C-Cypher Punks scanned your plates
Release the seatbelt off the shoulders, a mile ahead
Then the vibe got a lot colder when the marksman said
""Black niggas in the Jeep, get the fuck out the car""
Put your hands where my eyes can see or suffer a scar""
He was a veteran, who kept, pepper spray in the canister
Donut shop lounger, thirty eight brandisher
On top of that, the blunt smoke just rang a bell
Of his bloodhound who had an acute sense of smell
Beef tripping, saliva dripping from razor sharp teeth
That was pointy as the daggers of the Indian Chiefs
Same cops known for extorting pimps and booking whores
Aimed Glocks at me and Rae, cause they was looking for
A few MCs wanted for a string of break-ins
Last seen, wearing long minks and snakeskins

[Hook: Slick Rick]
We will, we will, rob you
We will, we will, Glock you
We will, we will, what? who? (not you)
Here we go

[Verse 3: Masta Killa]
You know my Clan done ran from Japan to Atlanta with stamina
Peace to Chef, Mr. Meth
Move it on your left, with the Iron Lung breath
Ghostface Kill', U-G ill
Deck so real, Dr. Ason Unique, the medic
Ahh, Allah Just, The Abbott, y'all niggas can't forget it
You might catch a Cap if your shit ain't Street
Allah Mathematics make the cypher complete
See knowledge is the foundation of existence
To know starts the spark of the flow
Wisdom activation of the Nation moving
Wise words, show and prove or understand the 13 letters
And the Masta, culture be the way of life
Freedom is reward, who will pay the price for the power
Spending hour after hour, preparing his self
For the hour, now look how refined
When the mind and body is one, every part of me
Supreme equality, manifest the nature of self
G-O-D, now build and add on to the truth
Destroy the bullshit, born incomplete"

As a child I was foul
Ma, I couldn't understand them things that came out your mouth
(Daddies ain't shit)
You would fuss, cuss 'til your blood pressure was up
Then give up and slouch on the couch and drink your liquor
(""Fuck you boy"")
A hard-headed nigga I was, quick temper
Short attention span not attending class
What a dummy, I would run over you honey
You confront me and say ""Obie you no longer have a Mommy
Don't use my phone, don't even eat my food
Matter of fact, don't speak"" and it was just me and you
In the house, with that mouse and them traps and that gat
Waiting on the day for you to pull the trigger back

Ma you're not feeling me, the beef is not that drastic
""Weed blasted bastard, you're lying (You're lying!)
You tuck plastic freezer bags with dope inside of em""
She knew, but she hated that it was true
""I done raised two boys, I can do away with you""
The locks changed, and the nights got colder
I'm slanging boulders, looking like a boulder toker
But fuck it, I'm the Obster, I'm down for mines Ma
She ride by my corner like, ""I'm not gonna cry
I would not reap the pain of watching my youngest man
On the corner slanging 'cane, I'm calling the cops""

Don't come down things will always work out
Don't come down things will always work out
Don't come down things will always work out

[Verse 3]
Ma, even though I left the house wrong
Seventeen years old on my own, using these streets as my home
There's no need to prolong this beef dear, I love you
Ms. Eleanor Trice I place no one above you
You the reason when I hustle, I knew to stack
The reason when I opened up mics I knew to rip
The ethics you enstored in this hectic young brother
Rubbed off after all, now look at your boy
When they ask about me now you won't just put your head down
Straighten up Ma, you can smile now proud
Everything's kosher with the boasterest Obster
Let's get closer, so regrets never approach us

I ain't with the leaning and rocking
That ain't even seen as a option...

[Intro: Crooked I (K-Young)]
You're nothing without (Focus...)
Woo.. Long Beach (Lay your seats back)
New Jersey (Turn your speakers up)
Brook-lyn! Detroit!

[Chorus: K-Young]
We-we, we lyrical murrrrrrrrrrrderers
Welcome to the Slaughterhouse
(What you talkin 'bout?)
Where we bring them verbal llamas out, blaow
We-we, we lyrical murrrrrrrrrrrderers
Man, we own these streets
And the freaks they love us
We ain't worried 'bout you fuckers (Slaughterhouse)
[Verse 1: Crooked I]
Lyrical murderer, blame Rakim
I'm a sniper shooting my way into your lame top 10
Pistol at your head if I ain't next to Eminem
Then I bust in your face like I'm fucking Lil' Kim
Niggas better pray to the lyrical lord
That I fall off like the umbilical cord before I fill up the morgue
This is how a killer record
With the double-edged triple syllable sword
I'm iller than ordinary, see I'm a literary genius
Bury niggas with words, a cemetery linguist
Most rappers are comedy gold
They like they boyfriend's sodomy hole - they full of shit!

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9""]
Now you could walk through the shadow of death next to that shady street
Where the verbal cocaine business and 80's meet
Where them niggas is backwards
I'm riding with my daughter in the front with the A.K. in the baby seat
We them copycat killers, unleashing venom
Commit them lyrical murders and then we re-commit 'em
Lyrics be high quality
Bitches be giving me brain, my dick be deep in they heads like psychology
Independently penning the best words that were ever said
The mixture of Leatherhead and Everclear
You can't hide, we everywhere
Now, picture a grizzly standing next to a teddy bear
[Chorus: K-Young]
We-we, we lyrical murrrrrrrrrrrderers
Welcome to the Slaughterhouse
(What you talkin 'bout?)
Where we bring them verbal llamas out, bloaw
We-we, we lyrical murrrrrrrrrrrderers
Man, we own these streets
And the freaks they love us
We ain't worried 'bout you fuckers (Slaughterhouse)

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Yeah, hello hip-hop, I am here, you dying yeah and I'm aware
A beast so at your wake I'll cry lion's tears
And that's no disrespect to the pioneers
If we ain't who you trying to hear
Something either wrong with your eyes and ears
I came in this game screaming Jers'
Ain't an MC in our lane to try and merge
Try and run with our wave
But I'm cool with being Eddie Levert seeing my son on stage
Gun gon' blaze, act up in this joint
And I'ma be Nate Robinson and back up the point
Your run's over, run with us or get run over
I'm here to save this shit, and I brung soldiers

[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
This is lyrical murder
Me and every track have a physical merger
When I stab it in the chest I'ma bit of a curver
So it bleeds to death, like the middle of a unfinished burger
Or sometimes I wrap my hand around his throat
'Cause he think his kick is slick or his little snare is dope
Shoot the bass in the face but sometimes I carry a rope
To hang the piano keys when they hitting every note
I'm what no beat's able to withstand
If you suffer from writer's block and your label got big plans
Listen to this fam
Slide a little dough out that budget, and hire the instrumental hitman
[Chorus: K-Young]
We-we, we lyrical murrrrrrrrrrrderers
Welcome to the Slaughterhouse
(What you talkin 'bout?)
Where we bring them verbal llamas out, blaow
We-we, we lyrical murrrrrrrrrrrderers

2010, that's right, we in the future: Atlanta, Georgia
Millions of albums sold, millions of moneys rolled
I see why +Everybody Hates Chris+ - YOU LIGHT-SKINNED BIATCH!!
SING ALONG WITH MEEEEE... {Cannon...}

[Hook 2X: Ludacris]
Say, ""FUCK you, Luda!"" - (FUCK YOU, LUDA!)
Say, ""FUCK you, Luda!"" - (FUCK YOU, LUDA!)
Say, ""FUCK you, Luda!"" - (FUCK YOU, LUDA!)
Yeah, I guess that's why +Eveybody Hates Chris+

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Hey! Okay now, this is for the Gs' and this is for the hustlers
This is for the diamonds and the WATCH all clustered
Spread 'em like mustard (yep!), canary yellow
Now women in my face like ""HELLO!"" (Waddup!)
Yea, I'm sort of a big deal (deal)
These Giovanni rims are sort of a big wheel (wheel)
This five course dinner is sort of a big meal (meal)
This Bentley GT can make Luda disappear faster than David COPPERFIELD, mutha-FUCKA!
...Hahaha
I'm talkin five star tellys, and Penthouse Suites
Yea, I'm just a Playboy between Penthouse sheets (okay!)
Hit the club and go and party with some Penthouse freaks (say what?)
Party with Britney, Lindsay and Paris together
Get in line and buyin bottles that's taller than Chris Webber
And makin haters sneeze from diamonds and sick leathers
Cause my ice gives 'em cold as if they under the weather (cool!)
But my women keep me warmer than a POLO sweater - they better
I guess that's why +Everybody Hates Chris+

Hey, now I stay fresh to death draped in gangsta fits (okay)
Over twelve million sold, I drop gangsta hits (yes sir!)
Live in mansions and drive around in gangsta whips
You would swear I'm 'bout to get into some gangsta shit
Oh no! Here comes trouble, my vision is skewed
I can only see in doubles, two models, two bottles
That'll pop like bubbles, and when I get home {Two...one...zero..}
The girls' tops lift off like air space shuttles (Liftoff {*rocket flies*})
And I guess that's why +Everybody Hates Chris+
It's sixty seconds 'til BLAST off!
My car got a face lift and took its mask off
Tint so dark it look like I took the glass off
The body was white for eight weeks befo' I finally decided to take its cast off (whoo!)
Now it's blacker than a bottomless pit
You talk shit you'll end up, wit bottomless lip (Blaow!)
I hit a nigga so hard, I'll make him swallow his spit (Blaow!)
Then I be with Bobby V. on that +Anonymous+ shit - you hear me?
And I guess that's why Everybody Hates Chris

Hey... (Let's go!) I go for BROKE like TLC
The hottest nigga on the mic - yeah, I believe that's me (Me, bay-bay!)
Now all the ladies wanna give a lil' T.L.C. (C'mon, girl)
Cause Luda was set for LIFE after three LPs (Ching!) - Yep!
Still counting, still climbing the charts
And rappers still talking shit like they was rhyming in farts (Waddup?)
I cross the finish line twice, they still trying to start (Nope!)

I always judge a book by the cover, never the page
I never judge a murder by weapons, only the rage
That he felt when he dealt with the physiological phase
They say that I never cease to amaze
While half my mental belongs in a cage
The ape is a beast, tranquilize that bitch
If you niggas selling dope then you selling my shit
Selling my assets
I'm so damn illegal that I need to be arrest
But then they'll get my mom for 18 years of possession
She showed me affection like a drug dealer using her pocket for my protection

I bet you've never seen a pig fly
Well you ain't been looking through my eyes

I bet you've never seen a pig fly, nope
Right next to the fat lady hitting high notes
Went to sleep at seven never woke up from the dream
Wore my wings and my jeans but my hat is from Supreme
So I guess that's where I hide my things
Caged, and the wonder is seen
Middle finger missing so I can not give a fuck
I can hear the bells ringing off the nice dream truck
So I'm chasing the dreams, no realities
Hoping that maturity won't be too mad at me
But if so, I'll take the scorn, indeed happily
Long as I can feel my heart tap like Happy Feet

Fatherless kids, orphans like me and Domo is
A fuck that we will never give is like our pops

I'm an odd fellow, the opposite of mellow
The therapist said hello but my mom would wonder

I was a kid like Michael Jackson when I started to be bad
But cleaned it up in 2000 like lever, either you can hop around
Hating all throughout your town
Or you can turn this up loud and take a glimpse of how I put it down
Finally found my sound, Helen Keller
And I'm taking that food out up your mouth like Old Yeller
Satisfaction's overrated, I don't agree with failure
So I just kept making heat up in the basement like a cellar
Well uh, pipe down like Drain-O
Just roll into a ball like Kano ‘cause they know
I'll die on these tracks chasing perfection like a rainbow
Walking out the bank, smiling face L-M-A-O

Brilliant, filling it the game left space and I'mma fill in it
My dream is to get a team that I could do some millions with
Everyday the MySpace plays, get a million hits
And I walk in the space and show my face, they take a billion pics
For my dream, I'm already for it
Trying to see everything like a city tourist
I'm eating all these rappers food, show me where's the porridge
Somebody sleepin' in my bed and I swear she's foreign
So I advise you not to knock
I give her the business like she just bought out all my stock
I became all the things I was taught not to mock
And when you got your eyes on the green, you’re taught not to stop

Tell them free Willy if your thighs are thick
And your ass if fat and your head is right
And your dough is good, we can smash tonight
Right here in the car, ma, at the light
If you ask for cash, oh I'm mad for life
Kiss ass, you dyke, and I'm fast to fight

Start A War,XV,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Colin Munroe]
Hey little miss creature, nice to meet you
Shall we start a war?
Light it up and let my world collide with yours
Hey little miss creature, the perfect match you'd make
On paper it's so wrong, but it's so right, it must be fate
Never gonna take it back, never gonna let you down
A war like this could turn the world around

[Hook: Colin Munroe]
This time no need for missiles to start a war
No one's loved like this before
No need for missiles, I'm sure
This love is enough to start a war
To start a war, to start a war, to start a war

[Verse 2: XV]
Ay, she said baby, let's make love, I said nah, let's make war
Then I started playing in her bush
But she screwed me out my seat, so I guess I'm Gore
Ha and all that I ask that
If I take you home tonight, I'm planting that flag
‘Cause you done made peace with my heart
But the whole world feeling there's bombs over Baghdad
N-n-n-n-now let's get oil rich
Enough to make all your ex boyfriends sick
And even though you wind me up
And I march to the beat of your heart, don't toy with this
And I just had to find a way to let you know
That if this blows, off the world we go
[Hook]

Never gonna let you go, never gonna let you down
Never gonna lose a war, never gonna turn around
Never gonna let you go, never gonna let you down
Never gonna lose a war, never gonna turn around

Mista Bob Dobalina, won't you quit?
You really make me sick with ya fraudulent behavior
You're gonna make me flip and then an army couldn't save ya
Why don't you behave ya little rugrat?
Take a little tip from the tabloid, because I know I'm not paranoid
When I say I saw ya tryin' to mock me
Now you and your crew are on a mission tryin' to hawk me
But it isn't happenin' ya fraudulent foes
You used to front big time now I suppose
That everything's cool since the style of apparel you adopted
You used to make fun of but now you wanna rock it
So you gotta kick it with the homies

Friends can be fraudulent, just you wait and see
First he was my moneygrip then he stole my honeydip
Mista Dobalina is a serpent, don't you agree?
The little two-tima resembles Aunt Jemima
With jeans and a dirty white hoodie
Seems like he wouldn't be a snake or would he?
Disguises come in all sizes and shapes
Notice the façade of the snakes
They all catch the vapes, even though last year they was GQ
Took a lot of time before the D-E-L could see through
The mask, all I had to do was ask Hemperor and Kwamé
And my man responded they would bomb a
Fraudulent foe with the strength of Hercules
The way ya on my dick must really hurt ya knees
You need to take heed and quit being such a groupie
Ever since I did a little show in Guadeloupee
I neva saw a groupie like you
But what is funny is ya wanted to be down with my crew
But D-E-L is not down with any clowns or jesters
So I would suggest that you try to impress Uncle Fester, Dobalina
Because ya don't impress me Dobalina
The style of dress is not the key Dobalina
It's all in the mind and the heart, so you should start
By remembering ya gotta pay a fee Dobalina

Hey, over there
Please forgive me if I'm coming on too strong
Hate to stare, but you're winning
And they're playing my favorite song
So come here, a little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear, a little question
Wanna know just how you feel

If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight

Hey, you might think that I'm crazy
But you know I'm just your type
I might be a little hazy
But you just cannot deny
There's a spark in-between us
When we're dancing on the floor
I want more, wanna see it
So, I'm asking you tonight

Is This Really What You Want?,"""Jesus Christ."" (the indie band)",['alternative'],"I understand that what I did was wrong
But I think that you should forgive me
I only did it because I have severe commitment issues

There's something wrong with you
There's something wrong with me, too

Is this really what you want? (echo)

What's wrong? Are you okay? Is this really helpful? Don't freak out! Why can't you just talk to me? Do you want this to be over? I just feel like we don't communicate. I wish you would just listen. This isn't gonna work out. Maybe we're just not compatible. Ohmigod, you always do that! You have to be serious! Please talk to me. Everything I say -- What do you wanna say?)

After a while you will go home
And you won't call
And I won't either
And we'll forget each other
And after a while I won't like you any more
And we'll forget each other
And after a while you'll be beautiful and alone inside of your coffee
And I'll be cold and alone inside a coffin
And we'll forget each other

I like the all-white, high-top strap with the gum bottom
There's somethin' about 'em, now dirty that's why I got 'em
I leave 'em strapped and laced and come up out 'em
The last person that touched 'em I damn near shot 'em

[Verse 2: Kyjuan]
Now if you look, and see lime-green Forces; it's Kiwi
You couldn't get this color if you had a personal genie
You know I keeps it hip-hop; may niggas flip-flop
Yeah, my Force Ones in tip-top (me) now form a flip flops

Me? I like the limited edition in khaki and army green
Patent leather pin stripe you should see how I do the strings
Size twelve with the strap, red and white with a Cardinal cap
All flavors but it just depend on when and where I'm at

Don't get me wrong, man
Now Murphy Lee ain't dumb, man

I keep it real dirty, dirty you know how I do
Purple in gold with the Lakers, the Broncos, the orange and blue
I like 'em floppy with ankle socks
Lows mids and high tops, which the clear sole
But it's Timb's and fat laces when it's cold
But when the winter go (burrr) and the hot summer flow
Then it's back to the all purpose wit' them lil' dots in the toe
Ain't nothin' stopping this dough that I'm spending fa sho'
On dem Nike Air Force, ""NE"" behind the ""O""

[Verse 7: Kyjuan]
O-kay Lee, I treat my shoe like my ride
Chrome on the fat laces and put wood on the inside
Spray candy on the swoosh, with electric roof
Since I put a kit on the sole, I got a wider shoe
You see that low-mid Skittle purple coupe I'm drivin in
(Kyjuan, were you getting dem colors, are you dyin them)
Ten is my size in dem, no point in tyin dem
Ain't no point in tryin these on, they know I'm buyin dem

[Verse 8: Nelly]
Now don't nothing get the hype on first sight like, white on whites
Them three quarters, them lows, they all tight
The only problem they only good for one night
Cause once you scuff 'em you fucked up your whole night
What's my basis? The look on store owner's faces
This kid's outrageous, he's buyin them by the cases
Cause once I cop 'em, I gut 'em and switch the laces
They all purpose, ya heard me, kinda like my Daytons

I wore spurs at first now there's tape on dem
Damn, when those came out? So I write the date on them
These Louis Vuitton ones, you gotta wait on dem
I had to get em early so I spent more cake on dem

Look I'm tryin to keep it up like a one minute man
While Ali on the Kawasaki two head bands

Now sometimes I get em free and some time I gotta pay
Walk in the mall and they now what I'm bout to say
Gimme the black and the platinum, and leather gray
Ones in the back and (yo) the pair you got on display (check)

[Verse 12: Ali]
Now in the box is where I keep mine (keep mine)
You should peep mine (peep mine)

If Youre Into It,Flight of the Conchords,"['hip hop', 'jazz', 'r&b', 'blues']","[Bret]
If you want me to
I could hang around with you
If I only knew
That’s what you’re into

[Jemaine]
You and him, him and you
If that’s what, you’re into
Him hangin ’round, around you
You’re hanging ’round, yeah, you’re there too

[Bret]
And if you want me to
I will take off all my clothes for you
I will take off all my clothes for you
If that’s what you’re into

[Jemaine]
How ’bout him, in the nude?
If that’s what you’re into
In the nude in front of you
Is that what you’d wanna view?
[Bret]
If it’s cool with you
I’ll let you get naked too
It could be a dream come true
Providing that’s what you are into

[Jemaine]
Is that what you’re into?
Him and you, in the nude?
That’s what he’s prepared to do
Is that the kind of thing that you think you might be into?

[Bret]
And then maybe later
We’ll get hot by the refrigerator
In the kitchen next to the pantry
You think that might be what you fancy?

[Jemaine]
In the buff, being rude
Doing stuff with the food
Getting lewd with his food
We heard that’s what you are into

[Bret]
Then on our next date
Well, you could bring your roommate
I don’t know if Stu is keen to
But if you want we could double-team you
[Jemaine]
How about you and two dudes?
Him, you and Stu, in the nude
Being lewd with two dudes with food
Well, that’s if Stu’s into it, too

The things I’d do for you
If I only knew
That’s what you’re into"

I don't need you or your brand new Benz

I don't need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
Get sleazy

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
We started out so cute in our baby pictures
That mommy shot for our daddy so that he wouldn’t forget you
He forgot anyway, but hey, one day he’ll remember
If not he’s human, I’m human, you human, we’ll forgive him
God gives him his ultimatum, can’t see how momma hates him
He’s such a cool ass guy, then wonder why she date him
I’m only eight, I’m not old enough, guess it’s complicated
Two-parent dwellings and spellings have gotten so underrated
I only say this in cadence so it don't get negated
I was gon' save it for later, but later look like maybe
This crazy lady named Kesha is guessing my Mercedes
Would be all new and through through, but it's the 1980′s
But now that we are cool cool, she sippin’ Irish Baileys
She say “Stacks, you’re true blue?”
I say, ""Naw, or maybe...""
I call her Keisha, she like it because it's hood to her
She call me Andre 6000 'cause I’m good to her

You can't imagine the immensity of the fuck I'm not giving
About your money and manservants at the mansion you live in
And I don't wanna go places where all my ladies can't get in
Just grab a bottle, some boys, and let's take it back to my basement and get sleazy
Sick of all your lines, so cheesy
Sorry, daddy, but I'm not that easy
I'm not gonna sit here while you circle jerk it and work it
I'ma take it back to where my man and my girls is

B-b-but your money's not impressing me, it's kinda weak
Th-th-that you really think you're gonna get my rocks off
Get my top and socks off by showing me the dollars in your drop box
Me and all my friends, we don't buy bottles, we bring 'em
We take the drinks from the tables when you get up and leave 'em
And I don't care if you stare and you call us scummy
'Cause we ain't after your affection and sure as hell not your money, honey

Wanna get on it like that? Well, then shout!

You could never capture the Method Man's stature
For rhyme and for rapture, got niggas resignin', now master

Yo! I come with that ol' loco style from my vocal
Couldn't peep it with a pair of bifocals
I'm no joker, play me as a joker
Be on you like a house on fire, smoke ya
Crews be actin' like they gangs, anyway
Be like, ""Warriors, come out and play!""
Burn me, I get into shit, I let it out like diarrhea
Got burnt once but that was only gonorrhea
Dirty, I keep shit stains in my drawers
So I can get fizza-funky for ya
Murder, taste the flame of the Wu-Tang
Rah! Here comes the Tiger vs. Crane

Keepin niggas in a headlock
Undress em, press em down in a full nelson
I hit jacks off six packs of the crooked one
They slip and I'm booking em
Fuck fingerprints, gimme from their fingertips
Chips to the neckline cos I got a Tec-9
Check mine like a pimp-main ho

[Verse 1]
Yo, I bought a brand new album today
Decide to take it home kick off my shoes relax and play
And spin it for the whole joint, 'cause I like to get the whole point
Music is everything to me and I refuse to rock the piece
Cause you're my favorite emcee
All I want is what you would ask of me; Hi Kwelity
And some Definition
Wonder why we bootleg like it's Prohibition
It's difficult it's dismissing
I got suspicions that your ears to the streets where we're whispering
Are you listening?
I took your LP to DC, where some youngins
Gave me the LD on how it should be
Make sure the beat knock 'til the trunk pop
And everybody pause when you cruise down the block
Roll down your window and they ask what you playin'
But don't nobody care what you're sayin'
That's what they told me, y'all
[Hook]
This is a message for our people chasing benjamins
With real rhymes and skills they believing in
Keeping them bad tapes rolling like Michelins
It don't matter, 'cause niggas ain't listening
They ain't listening, they thinkin' bout their Timberlands
They say the shit we talk about ain't interestin'
We got a better chance of blowing up in Switzerland
Holla if you hear it 'cause niggas ain't listening

[Verse 2]
Music was my sanctuary so I take a long listen
To hip hop living out my life in songs wishin'
My parents I could get along with them
So I would go inside my room and dig deep inside the strong rhythms
Back when fresh was the word, and ""Raw"" was on Prism
Marley on the boards, plus Kane was long livin'
G Rap and Ace spittin' murderous
Bought Long Live the Kane sat down and learned every word of it
Sneakin' my walkman in the homeroom playin' it
Listen for punchlines delivery and cadences
But nowadays it's like niggas wanna play with it
They hear some good shit but don't stop to savor it
Like one night we was out in my whip
With some broads just chillin' playin' demos and shit
Asked 'em how I sounded rockin' the mic
One chick told me all she listened to was beats, thank God for 9th
Trying to get pressed on vinyl
'Cause muh'fuckers buy your CD, but turn around don't even know your song titles
Like track 2 is hot, and track 6 is long
Ain't even listening, I'm hoping I get through to y'all

Asparagus rosemary chips for all my nice niggas
We roll through niggas masked in vengeance
U-Haul emcees chasing Brown Sugars
And you thought that it would never happen
Thought that it would never happen
My clever rappin' keeps my celery growing
Judy Jetson up in Elroy's thought he was home
With the Gold Bond Armor-All fatigues on
Rosey in the pantry with Velma and Shaggy gettin' they lean on
He sweeter that a Willie Hutch track hittin' them high notes
And Alex Keaton always frontin' like he high post
Screaming on Justine when he flippin' the script
Tony Danza left a playa celibate
Rippin' rhymes for the hell of it
Check all these bitches on my Soul Glow city
Walkin' round with Madagascar titties
Imported for my Cole Train leaves ya elephant niggas

Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hoping that it gets me by, got a nigga going crazy

[Verse]
Some niggas wanted to kill me, got locked up and never found me
So my goal is to catch a charge in that same county
Picture me gettin' bumped for a silly hand-off
The bullpen's fucked up, just ask Willie Randolph
See I could pop a few nickel plated Glocks too
It's easier to kill niggas than it is not to
I let the pot brew, then the plot grew
It the labels job to label you don't fit it and they'll drop you
Finally made a move on something, I been saw
Sometimes you got to lose the fight
If you tryin' to win the war, I'm focused on tomorrow
I'm done seein' my friends in the rearview, thinkin' we really closer than we are
Fuck the record label
No relation or correlation all my admiration just turned aggravation they say
How you sit so long when you spew classics
I tell niggas I can't understand that's, that blue magic
The rap game as is either you on some snap shit
Or plan ol' stuck in a different decade like the brat is
I hear niggas joints and take it personal WHY
Now everybody want to spit about their personal lives
Before that was non existent
Me I'm an addict with an addition for anything that seems to cause friction
Maybe I'm in a relationship with bad Karma
What her past the somber maybe I attract drama yeah
Undoubtedly my life is on some VH1 shit
Just adding some salt and pepper to reality while
Other artists is obsessed with more toys
Like Lex coup, Beemers, and Benzes -- they're lost boys
Un I kept brushing off my shoulder till the chip was going
Left the benz at the dealers till the kit was on
I don't feel niggas songs
So while ya'll at the awards
I'm loading up on ratches that's the tip I'm on
Flow is on acid, I swear I would have the game mastered
If I wasn't so busy carrying baggage
Calling god a bastard
Calvin look way different in person
Then they had him looking in his casket
I'm looking in his casket like he had no face
I was at a lost for words like Fiasco gate
So I figured I say a prayer for em got on my knees quick
And realized ""I DON'T EVER PRAY UNTIL I NEED SHIT""
My soul achin trying to stay low maintenance
I'm stuck in hell waiting on, blessing with no patience
I done made the Ave hot, been had to stab shot
Waiting on my jackpot, always been a have not
Always been an under dog little guy still try
Cause I think I'm a cash cow they treat me like I'm milk dry
Juggling nickels and dime I'm walking a fine line
Sometimes you got to just breath maybe give time, time
Give me a sign kind of shock he won't
See I want another baby but my pockets don't
Normally that wouldn't bother me
Til I wake up and get the paper and
Read that some rich nigga won the lottery
Young black and shameless
Shorty keep beefing about the same shit
Almost like yelling her second language
Why do I entertain it
Listen we been arguing about everything for ages, do it ever change shit?
Wind up igging each other for the whole week
It's a lot of men in this world baby you chose me like I chose you
We been rocking for years you signed up
You not a victim, you a volunteer, it's weird
I'm not a cheater, on occasion still fuck a bitch
Who knows why, maybe just to feel coveted
I'm me, she's her, we both had enough of it
But won't leave, we the only ones who put up with it
In all areas its like my stocks crashing
Wishing all these old motherfuckers would stop rapping
Tryna be tasteful, not mad or rageful
Upset or hateful, not complacent, I'm grateful
And I don't wanna resort back to my old ways
There's no stairway to heaven less you the..."

What we have here is the alpha and the omega, I spit it
Bear witness to the greatest and the latest
They try to hate us, yo

[Verse 1]
Witness the evolution of spitting, it's wicked and it's decadent
Revolutions per minute every time the record spin
Retribution for cynics like a stick-up kid with weapons
In Brooklyn they say I run it, the 'Natti is checking in
No matter the terminology, blood splatter artistically
It's looking like a Jackson Pollock painting, it's a mystery
Really should be brothers united against the industry
The african diaspora scatter with shattered history
The game missing me, rap is so repetitive
Although I ain't your blood or your cuz, it's all relative
I got a gang of rhymes, and Tone's beats is banging
We moving through the streets like we slanging dimes
It's magical, how the track so classical
To cats who got gats tucked in they sweats like Plaxico
I'm back from my sabbatical, voice of the future
Black radical, keeping all the damage as collateral
[Hook]
Listening to instrumentals
Thinking bout all the things I've been through
The music just a peek into my life as a window
It's so Hi-Tek and it's all so simple
Even if I'm knocked down, I don't stay down
Even if I get down, I don't lay down
Hotter than the tar on the city playground
Hotter than the tar on the city playground

[Verse 2]
Aiyyo, I'm taking all bets, I'm settling all debts
A giant leap for man begin with the small steps
From a sword to a set, to my people on the picket line
Who sick of getting treated like them aliens in District 9
I juxtapose my business mind with my spirit
What, I'm just supposed to keep you comfortable with the lyrics?
I know the flow disturbing, I know for certain
Just because you know all about the artist don't mean you know the person
You don't know me, I run labels
These unstable rappers so phoney
I try to listen but they as boring as missionary position
So I'm shitting on these niggas like dysentery conditions
I'm sitting on the throne, you dreaming that it's empty soon
Nobody feeling you, you screaming in an empty room
The tree that fall in the forest, nobody hearing you
Even though you fall the hardest, don't get me started
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yo, I build up my defenses when I'm left to my devices
Time gets suspended more than DMX driver's license
My music's steady, not affected by the higher prices
People having sex in the streets like Dionysus
You know what my advice is? Fuck my advice, live your life
Stop tripping like everything a minor crisis
I'm making sacrifices, my history is black as Isis
I don't think that I can trust you if you lack in vices
I never miss a beat, the liquor make me slur
They takes my words, try to twist 'em like a Swisher Sweet with sticky herb
American History X, your teeth will hit the curb
It's easy cause I'm ill with the wordplay, I still flip the bird
Like Jeezy, we stripped it down, now it's exposed
I suppose my flow is ""The Emperor's New Clothes""
Although I'm always by myself, I never ride alone
The music on, then I'm right at home, zoning

[Outro]
Yeah, it's the pavement, word is bond
Don't be scared to think man, don't be scared

But don't be scared, scary ass niggas, ay!"

F.L.A. (South nigga)--5x

[Verse 1: Grill]
Nigga F.L.A. the best place to stay
Where the woman stay half dressed
And tattoes on they back, and they thighs, and they breast
And every nigga grilled up with bald heads and dreads
The land of the Florida Gators
And trying to live it up in ""The Sunshine State""
Got a thousand Tony Montana's from Jacksonville to Miami
And best believe my niggas bout they g's
And home of Disney World but don't think its Mickey Mouse nigga
You be splittin blood from ya mouth
You better watch for that Sanford, Tampa, Miami exit
Nigga fuck up and ride in swamp land
You better roll 'em up and lock the do's
And every corner packed up with thugs
Sitting on some dubs
Nigga still smoking out of Swisha Sweets and Phillies
Whole lot of y'all niggas don't know about that Florida krypit
First hit girl got 'cha like a hippie
And if you ain't from the south don't come down here wit that S on ya chest
Think these niggas country, I hope that S, hope it's a vest
Come on nigga put this muthafucking double barrel to test
[Hook: 2x]

[Verse 2: ???]
Nigga doubted us for a long long time
Na the South on the map na this our turn to shine
Y'all wit it, let's get it
Coming down on the South you gone get it, best believe it
Y'all got hoes, we got hoes
Y'all roll dubs, we roll dubs
So what make ya better than us
Talk that shit if you want
Bust yo brain think we won't
For always fucking with us
Muthafuck that shit-- nigga this is where I stay
Muthafuck that shit-- Sarasota, FLA
Muthafuck that shit-- You don't like what we say?
Muthafuck that shit-- Then don't come down our way

[Hook: 2x]

[Verse 3: Grill]
I wouldn't stay no where but FLA, home of the Magic
You play wit Orlando boys you going home in plastic
And my city is like a jungle, It's all about survival
Stop around and ask for directions!
Come up out that Lexus, give me yo rolex's
Get out of here boy
Then they got a nigga fighting in the parking lot
You might here shots
And every city got a Gotham City
But FLA got the best beaches
Every spring break college kids come from all over
It's no limit in FLA
Despite all the haters, you got to love our Florida Keys
Miami niggas all about stacking g's
And still no love for the police
In Liberty City, to College Hills, to Mercy Drive, to Compound
Project niggas still run the streets
Respect that South, niggas running the block
And respect the South niggas with a mouth full of golds
I told ya nigga listen to me boy
[Hook: 2x]

[Verse 4: Grill]
Can you picture living in FLA
Where them south ballers play gungi sessions all day
Shit greener than the palm trees
Project block packed up with thugs
Coastline niggas cleaning up them dubs
And little homies in the streets saying ""Coke Dawg show a nigga luv""
Nigga rock the show for my thugs
And every where I look I see flip-flop paint
Gold sittin on chrome
'Cademy Manor nigga's got bar-b-que's
Probably don't stop till its dark
And niggas on 25th cleaning up the rides
And J niggas coming thru swerving on dubs
Thug niggas shouting out nothing but weed
Telling Coke Dawg nigga I'm showing ya love
And my nigga JD told me nigga keep ya finger on the trigger
Watch for them hating niggas, can't fuck with this nigga
Fat boy and I'm screaming...

I'm out this bitch, so
That's what I claim
Got my Glock and my clips, now, I'm back in the game
It's exactly the same as
When ya man left
Straight from the scene of the game Grand Theft
Now the same last breath'll be the one that'll save ya
Angel dumb blast all the rest of ya fables

Don't call my bluff

I've been grinding on 'em lately
Lining up the ladies
Looking at these labels where they findin' all these maybe's
Fade me
Naw, they don't even wanna try
Let them boys piss me off, put the bullet in the dot
Been a fooler than a rock, jump off in the pen
To the free on the streets
That's the cost for the wind
Not the boss, but the man that could make this shit happen
They gon' sit and blast til I say, ""Quit cappin'
Actin' a fool
Do what you do
Slow down, screw,"" put my shoe on the fool
Thought you knew on the crew out the Houston, Texas
And soon, I'm a prove how them dudes is reckless

Now it's not like you don't know
How it's 'bout to go
Smash that trash, kick they ass up out the door
Get the stash, I got the flow, puttin' paper in my pocket
Dunkin' on 'em, somethin' like a player from the Rockets

Meanwhile, I'm spittin' while your girl on top of me
Got to be, crazy

Stranger in Moscow,Michael Jackson,['pop'],"[Verse 1]
I was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feeling insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittling me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me

[Chorus]
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

[Verse 2]
Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was dogging me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a beggar boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came and again, and again, and again
Take my name and just let me
[Chorus]
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

Whos Gonna Save My Soul,Jay Electronica,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Love is conditional
I never knew that Mary'd put a hole in my fishing boat
I got to tripping more, she went to bitching more
The court of Universal Law said it wasn't permissable
She went to forte, I stayed pianissimo
Then I went to forte and she went to physical
Should I go should I stay and withstand
The additional attacks on the mental and the physical
It's gone get dangerous
Why waste time in these child-like exchanges
Why waste time with these child-like games, it's make up to break up
Crying all the time baby messing up your make-up
Try and scratch my face up
She said ""I need communication Jay but you dont say much""
I know it ain't okay but
I from where niggas keep they mouth closed and the gate shut
It seem like only yesterday that I was just a kid
In Christian Dior velour, ballies and a shape-up
Spinning on cardboard and trying to rip a break up
Life comes at you fast, I went from sleeping in class
To sleeping in the streets forgetting where I wake up
When I was hit with trial, I went in to survival mode
And did a lot of shit a nigga wasn't proud of, so
When I be sittin on the couch with a blankhead
I be at the homeless shelter jefferson and bankhead
A Jack sippin dankhead
Making sure niggas don't steal my clothes
Trying to make a path so I fufill my goals
Trying to take a bath so I can heal my soul
A little bit of laughter to conceal my woes

Wooin' some fancy clown

Put your sister on the phone
Yo, it's Viktor

[Verse 1: Viktor Vaughn]
I knew you was ----ing around
Playing all innocent and ho'ing since the foundation
Don't make me have to pound his tin crown face in
And risk being jammed up like traffic, inbound from spacing
There's been a place for you in my heart since we first met
A teenage love that didn't feel no hurt yet
My boys warned me you was poison like BBD first cassette
And still I put my chips on the worse bet
Gave up the skirt, now I gotta hear it from the street
How dare you drag my name in the dirt and cheat
You could've broke it off, ended it and dipped
And if you spoke soft, we could've still preserved the friendship
Now you apologize, that's what they all say
You wasn't sorry when you sucked him off in the hallway
But have it your way, raw— no foreplay
That's you if you want a dude who wear a mask all day
And just to think, I used to be proud of you
And you had some real good power...
[Hook]
[Sample]
You've been trippin' around, uptown
Wooin' some fancy clown

No, it wasn't- it wasn't nothing like that
Well, my brother, you didn't tell me you had called
I wasn't at home

[Verse 2: Viktor Vaughn]
Probably kissed her later that evening, I should be hurling
Matter fact, gimme back my bracelet and my Shearling
I rather waste it or give it to your girlfriend
She did let me stab it last week while you was workin'
Remember, our vacation out to Maryland?
I dooked the maid Carolyn, she made me throw the towel in
Like all foul men, the time I hit your moms off
I told her knock it off, but she had to set the rocket off
Ain't enough room in this ----ing town
When you see tin head, tell him ""be ducking down""
I'm not rompin' around, he better be
Ready and prepared to be stomped in the ground

Once he got pinched, coincided with law
Same homie say he lay it down for the bul
Brought game squad around ours
How could it be? Been homies since Superman drawers
Only phoniness never came to par
He had us, a true neighborhood actor
Had his back with K's, now we see through him like X-Ray's
Cuffed in that Adam car
No matter, his loss, we at him, it's war

Been on these corners, sellin' like anything on us
Knowin' Heaven has shown us bein' devil's minors
But that ain't got shit to do with the tea in China
We gon' keep the grind up 'til death come find us
Meantime leanin' in them European whips reclined up
It's eye for an eye for the riders
We ain't tryin' to get locked up, we sole survivors
Po-po's is cowards, it's no you, it's ours
We vowed this, mixin' yayo with soda powder

So he move to a rural area to keep cool

Nowadays your circle should be small as hell
Ain't tryin' to meet new faces, this don't interest me
Even if we bubble slow we'll get it eventually
No penitentiary, there'll be no clemency
You will meet the Lord, snitch, in givin' us a century
These cats is rats now, the streets need D-Con
That's how they react now, weak when the heat's on 'em
Stop snitchin', you asked for the life you're livin'
This act is not permitted nowhere on the map
It is forbidden to send a nigga to prison

Still pushing base like an African drum
The only other hands that it touched before Young
Was a Guala out of Dallas with shag like Tum Tum
Back to the hood where niggas started detoxing
Till I hit them corners with that motherfucking sheet rock
The rollers back bitch, the seal's on the back bitch
The six-three highlights the difference like an asterisks
Yes, the re-up game never dies
Soda makes the brick multiply
Push tons of monster with the pie
Keep water from the villain
Remember what it did to them gremlins?
Oh God, street wars when the heat warms up
In summertime niggas know what's up
Heavy armour, heavy drama, heavy karmas
We the reason haters scared of us fucking their baby mamas

[Hook: Block McCloud]
Soon as this product hits the street
You know they will be strung
They'll be dancing to the beat of this drum
Listen, It's addiction hey
You know we got em hooked like fiends
They open like a trunk
They'll be dancing to the beat of this drum
Listen, It's addiction

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, I told Pusha, I told Mal
Vinnie move more white shit than a snowplough
Everybody knew the Guinea was so foul
The SKS with the bayonet, oh wow
I'll rob everything and leave you with a hungry gut
The hollow tips leave you looking like you got a Gumby cut
You think you fucking with the God then you's a funny fuck
Rambo knife cut your stomach like a tummy tuck
All you see is darkness when the gun bursts
The G36 melt your brain like a Pun verse
I act wild but I handle my funds first
I'm drunk all the time, blood quenches the son's thirst
I don't talk about the money I got
Because if money want my money then money gets shot
Rap shit don't work? Then I dumb on the block
With Pusha and Mal cooking up the jums in the pot

Still with the coke man, same as it ever was
Re-up gang, we the shame of America
Eighties hysteria, the 'caine be my legacy
The feds got our names, they hang us in effigy
Best believe it come back like it never left
I write rhymes but I'll bet I'd make a better chef
They can't wait for it to dry, they like it better wet
And I'm heavy with the D like Eddie F
I whip it good, real good then I let it rest
Then I scrape the sides then I let em test
Yes, I got weight like Creatine
A gym star hit that chopping block like a guillotine
Know what I mean? Sitting on chrome rims
Not only paper, we stack brick like Stonehenge
Go against us? Haters got no wins

And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray

Why you acting like you more trouble than Tony Starks, 'n'
You need to just 'walk away' like Kelly Clarkson
I know, we was free to sleep around town
But I figured you said that cause how I get down
Not cause you was out there, messing around
I would of told you, once you go Ghost, you never go back
Try g'ing me, like I don't know how to mack
I'm a don - top of the line, I stay flying
Stop trying, to keep covering the lies and
Using my credit cards to buy diamonds
We need to straighten this out, get to the bottom of it all
Let's go, before we start the war
Begin with two reasons why we need to talk
And stop popping up in my cribs all over New York
And, that's stalking, you such trouble and no good
Them fighting words in my block, when we in the hood

I told you, I was trouble

Temperature's so hot, the heat just rise with you
Let me ride with you, talk about your mistakes
You cheated yourself but these are the breaks
And it never be the same again, cause of old boy
But oh boy, together we make so much joy
In the sands and oh, what a web we weave
But you played me, so I had to roll up my sleeves and
Hunt you down, holding the next man's stacks
Now you sorry, tryin' bring that old thing back and
Act like we can rekindle that flame
It's a shame, how you can't get me off the brain
Hear that lame? You love how I bring the pain?
Got the rug burns stinging and you saying my name
Say my name, that's right, I'm high post
Get the champagne, love, word up, we gon' toast

Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you're on the seat
Lick your lips, as I soak my feet

Yo, get the bath and body works, pumkin and spice creams
Together like Cheech and Chong, we make nice dreams
Fight scenes, I take the good with the bad
Cause you give the best brains that I ever had and
Anything worth having is hard to keep
I love you like my coffee so hot and so sweet
So let's, stick it out, so we never regret it
I could forgive the past, but I never forget it

Thirty-six a thousand times, I'm doing somersaults (Somersaults)
Do it right, and you can live your whole summer raw (Yeah)
I'm out my mind, yeah, a nigga seeing double, y'all (Double, y'all)
Tell me, what's the chance of Jizzle fucking both of y'all? (Both of y'all)
She said, ""Long as we can do it with your ice on"" (Ice on)

Why y'all trip? (Tripping) I'm just fine (Fine)

Couldn't get it all week, time to unwind ('Wind)
Drink like a tank (Tank), lose my mind (Yeah)
This shit crazy (Crazy), way too bad (Bad)
Rosé, babe, waste two stacks (Yeah)
Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine
Can't spell sober, lost my mind (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Do I love these hoes? Mmm, kinda-sorta
I got 'em drinking Sangria like it's fucking water
Some Miami women, tanlines showing
And they really 'bout whatever, shit is mind-blowing
Fuck what they talk, do what I say
Bust it open, girl, and send it my way
You say you like it like that, I think I like it, too
Half a million in a week, it's only right I do
All-seeing eye—my, I seen it all
I talk a lot of shit, I swear I mean it all, yeah
One-oh-three
And both fingers to the haters tryna front on me, ahh!

Why y'all trip? (Tripping) I'm just fine (Fine)

Drop the top, no bra, got the titties out (Titties out)
Mention my name and bring the whole city out (Yeah)
Doing what I do best: d-boy stuntin' (Stuntin')
New car, old money, d-boy stuntin' (Yeah)
Step in cleaner than a new Glock-40 (Forty)
My nickname in the A: ""Strapped-Up Shawty"" (Yeah)
You know my nerves bad, trigger like a toothpick (Toothpick)
Line wrapped around the corner, boy, too big (Yeah)
G-Code, black shades and my black chains (Black chains)
Look, you wouldn't understand, it's a black thing (Black thing)
You know we drink that Rosé til we black out (Black out)
Wake up, drink some more, pass back out (Yeah)

[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
Why y'all trippin'
I'm just fine
12:45, 'bout that time

[XV]
Look at the beats that I done buried
Tell me I can’t bless this like five Hail Mary’s
Dead is so grateful that I'mma have to tell Jerry
Clearly, I’m still going unaware of the unwary
Yeah, haters stay imaginary as five fairies in the library
Eating on snozzberries, say, I rarely got the city on my back
You Lisa Simpson niggas need to get off my saxs
I rep that deuce one. Blackjack
Riding and I’m lifting up my hood like a hatchback
Whipping in my hot wheel, ain’t riding on no snap track
I’m after Slum Dog Millions, you after Kat Stacks
Better wear a condom and a hazmat
Bitches waste my time I wouldn’t give ‘em in a flashback
Rappers fill they flash drives with whack tracks
Couldn’t break a record with a glass plaque
Motherfucker, that’s that, I bag hunnies like MCM nigga
Championship ballin like Wimbledon nigga
The dudes that talk big, I never envy them niggas
They been lying since forever like MGM nigga
It’s hard to quit the bull, they be on some Jordan shit
’Cause when you really do it, you don’t choose it, you were born in it
So I do it for my FAM and you, Florida shit
And I'mma kill a nigga on some Dexter Morgan shit
I promise mama that college just wasn’t for the kid
‘Cause I’m after the trophies you don’t box up in storages
Nobody ever sing my praises
Amazing now I’m hopping up on stages where they all singing my choruses
Said fuck a job, now all I do is fucking work
Like a naughty secretary or a slutty nurse
Got the last laugh on people who acted funny first
Hungry like the homeless but I never spit a bummy verse
Signed with Warner, now I got that Bugs Bunny smirk
What up Doc? Seven's Spock and I’m a younger Kirk
Stay with hard lines like a Modern Warfare perk
And always throwing up my city until my tummy hurt
Dynamite life, let’s have a blast all over these bars, put it on my tab
Gunning for the roses and I’m strumming like Slash
I don’t toot my own horn, I brought the whole brass
Put my bars on the graph, everything’s proportion
‘Cause I never spit no trash, these are worth a fortune
‘Cause niggas throw me ass cap, they need Aflac
Conceited about my good tracks, I always get a bad rap
I plot my winds just like it to wear a gas mask
And my gear is high end like giraffe ass
I’m after that dollar, almost four quarters
And Warner's about to put me in the last half
Now watch they stock just go up
Your album dropping soon, tell em hold up
Vizzy lifting drinks, tell em pour up
My Willy Wonkavator bout to go up"

Smoke but don't choke on, it's the shit

From less than a toke of it's... the bomb

For those who think life is unfair
'Cause I blow my smoke in the air
As if no one is standin' there

With a fistful of your girlfriend's hair
Yes, she'll blow one tonight, for your sorrows

Daddy Fat Sax back on the scene
Went and shot two or three movies
But everything's straight like 9:15
It's back to the time machine, I believe
Back to the rhyming, back to the spit
Back to the hi-hats, *tsst*, kick, snare
Y'all niggas dare to think that was it, we everywhere (Biatch!)
Like the air you breathe
Got 'em stuck like Chuck in the web we weave
Like a lace front wig stuck to the forehead
Best believe I'll change your steeze, take the lead
Change the speed, slow it down just for the sport
Nigga, one of my favorite rappers happens to be Too $hort

Now go get yourself a handgun, you fucking with a great
Put it to your mouth and squeeze it like your morning toothpaste (gunshot)
Kill yo self, like Sean Kingston, suicidal for a title
My recitals are vital and may be needed for survival
Like the Bible or any other good book that you read
Why are 75% of our youth reading magazines?
'Cause they used to fantasy, and that's what they do to dream
Call it fiction addiction 'cause the truth is a heavy thing
Remember when the levees screamed, made the folks evacuees?
Yeah, I'm still speakin' about it 'cause New Orleans ain't clean
When we shoutin ""Dirty South"", I don't think that is what we mean
I mean, it mean the rough, the tough, the dangerous, we reign supreme
Can slaughter entire teams with the ink that my pen bleeds

Don't want no girlfriend
Just need my dope (I just need my dope)
Won't front on the world when
I'm behind in my smoke (I'm behind in my smoke)

Take another huff and puff
And choke and toke on icky, stinky, sticky
Stuff a bowl and pack a pipe
Twist a blunt, roll and light a joint

Some good shit, yeah
Lean back and puff slow"
Broken Glass,Talib Kweli,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
This the story of - Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds
Ask her why she crying, she wanna live, she got no time for dying
Was a science, dreams too big for a small town
She gotta get to New York and watch a door fall down
Hopped off the Greyhound, gotta make her way now
She sleeping on the park benches in the playground
But cash burn quick, don't wanna have to turn trick
Ready to quit 'til she met the super pimp
Flashing his toothy smile that drove little Lucy wild
She quick to hop up on his dick straight Hoopie style
She let the fella hit but she sang she sell-a-bit [celibate]
He ain't buying that, she ain't selling it
She looking for love in all of the above
Believing videos, trying to back up all on a thug
Who wanna - put it in her, withdraw like a Citi card
But now she shake that ass for tips at the titty bar

[Hook: Talib Kweli] (Pharrell)
Broken glass - everywhere! (IT'S LOUDER!!)
Louder - than a bomb shattered in in the air (IT'S LOUDER!!)
Try to hold back your tears baby! (IT'S LOUDER!!)
Wait a second, what happens here baby? (IT'S LOUDER!!)
Broken glass - everywhere! (IT'S LOUDER!!)
Louder - than a bomb shattered in in the air, yeah
(How many of y'all think you can do what we do?!)
Yeah! Wait a second (One! Two! Three! C'mon!)
[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Dreams shattered like broken glass
Press ignore it and your hopes get broken fast
You complain for the life you supposed to have
But when you try to make plans, God is known to laugh
Throw a song on the phonograph, and Lucy start wilin
The trick start smiling, watch the loot start flying
The Gucci start pilling up, she live designer plush
Start lining up the coke so she could find a rush
Time's up, she's about to turn 33
Her shit started to sag, she got surgery
Now cats are used to drive past her like a Church van
Acting on thirst, 'She Wants To Move' like a N.E.R.D. fan
Bigger house, 10,000 dollar purse fam
She let you in, she wanted rent by the 1st man
She the ring leader in a clique of birds
And they shadowy, like the silhouette behind the curtain

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
She was a small city girl with big city dreams
Niggas try to figure how to get up in them jeans
Put her in them scenes, get her on the team
Hit her wit the cream 'til they figured out the schemes
Now she all up in the club looking for a new love
Really like Huey Lewis looking for a new drug
Cause coke's getting old, started free basing
Graduated to crack, smack on occasion
Not catching the bus, but back at the station
Back and forth pacing, acting all impatient
Last hundred dollars, she got to 'Get By'
Now gotta make a choice, go home or get high
Mommy and daddy miss her, she left for the fame
Now what's left is the dirt that's thrown on her name
She need a ticket home if it's the right course
Instead she bought a ticket to ride the white horse

I ain't lost and this ain't shipwrecked
I feel small in this big wide world
And Mummy ain't said ""Honey, I shrunk the kids"" yet
I ain't Jesus, but I'm walking on water
There's no bombs here, there's no war, 'cause
I can break out of jail with a lighter
So is there any point in making laws, blud?
This ain't Atlantis, are you sure?
I nearly suffocated when I touched the shore
No rain, condoms it poured
And up the road, you'd never guess who I saw

Uh, uh, uh, it's K-A
Look, skip on the beat like Ali in the gym (Yeah)
Honey, I'm home this is where I wanna live (Yeah)
Just found it like Nemo on the D-low
I don't know if it's greener, but it's green though
On the other side of the fence, bye to the ends
Look, no feds, no stress, no rent
No superficial shit, this real flow
Where the women look hot, but the beach cold
And the speech goes like, ""Hi, little lady
Sex on the beach, wanna try for a baby?""
Word in the village, I'm a little bit crazy
Swagger on a hundred degrees, no eighty
Look, if heaven had a VIP
Uh, this is it: white sand, blue sea
But I don't know who they are
And I'm damn sure they don't know me, but I come in peace
[Verse 3: Bashy & Kano]
Cool! White flag! White flag!
Uh-huh, no war! No guns! No corps!
Just life, just love, no hype, just fun
No ties, just me and my mind
Just me and my wife, but tell me if I'm dreamin'
'Cause I don't wanna wake up till the evenin'
And I don't wanna be left sleepin'
From all the diseases that I breathe in
Look, respect the island, no stealin'
And don't bring religion here, no three kings

The Prophecy,Immortal Technique,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
So you're the motherfucker they call Immortal Technique
What the fuck make you so special, nigga?
Huh? What the fuck do you do?

[Verse]
I calculate planet alignment like Mayan astronomy
Discoverin' atrocities
Worse than Aristotle subjectin' children to sodomy
Your theory of the galaxy is primitive like Ptolemy
The truth about the universe dug up like Aztec pottery
Unpredictable results like experimental psychology
I stomp the streets with emcee's beneath my feet in colonies
But presentation and spirit revolve around autonomy
Searchin' for monogamy
And cuttin' fake bitches out of my mind like a lobotomy
So obviously I'm not gonna be here to play games
Walk the top of the world and leave the arctic circle in flames
Battle the beast and false prophet predicted in the King James
I give a fuck about your emcee name, I don't admire you
Only by dental records will you be identifiable
'Cause the future is not reliable
Remember when rap was not economically viable?
Comparable to what motherfuckers think of me
I might be nobody, but wait 'til I'm together like a symphony
Resoundin' sound that will continue infinitely
Angel of Death punishin' all those who live in infamy
And shine so far away from you
You'll never get a glimpse of me
Attempts to extinguish me don't even bother me none
Like retarded kids throwin' ice cubes at the sun
A victory against Immortal Technique will never be done
Just degrees of losin' it every second you're addin' one
Some niggas dream of pushin' kilos, but I drop tons
With more facts and formulas and philosophical logic
Then a basement full of scientists puffin' on chronic
Dip the mic in potassium cyanide and liquid bubonic
And use it as a sonic wand to find the spawn of the demonic
Screamin' like Onyx is of absolutely no consequence
The poison is dense enough to clog up your arteries
Mercy is not a part of me
I cause you bodily injury permanently
Because simply verbally murdering me
Is inconceivable 'cause of the unbelievable evil injected inside
The blood stream of my people
And redemption is not located under a church steeple
The feeble and the meek in soul just like the technique
Will inherit the Earth, but the Earth will be weak
Mother Earth in her decrepit terminal illness physique
The year 3000 is bleak, no happily ever after
Just death following the Fourth Reich disaster
A legacy of bastards, with plastic explosives
Your future's been eroded, 'cause you forgot that when your free it's multiplied indefinitely
By the struggle that be, the struggle I see
To socialistically unite the Third World countries
Expose hypocrisy in America's democracy
Sloppily obsessed with stoppin' me 'cause I speak prophecy
Trample and dismantle your capitalist philosophy
The same way I stomp the conquerin' rap monopoly
And I'm not a fuckin' prophet… but that's the fuckin' prophecy"

Big-face hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named ""Cinnamon,"" more chips than Pentium
""What you gon' buy next?"" Whatever new trend it is
I'm tryna spend my stacks, and I'm so broke

I always had a Ph.D: a pretty huge dick
Ladies tired of getting ripped off by guys like this
And giving head is like a whale that's using a toothpick
Well, I'm in the club for a limited time
Act now and get some action for a free-ninety-nine
Later on, I might charge for ménage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss
But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it ain't gon' cost me because
She my caddy 'cause she grab my golf balls in the club
And I'm still acting calm than a muh'
She asked, ""Can you drive me in the hundreds where my Altima was?""
While we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man

I blow past low-class niggas with no cash
In a four-dash-six, bitch, you can go ask
So when I go fast, po-po just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash
Whatever comes first, I'm prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second, I'll be there with my weapon
Pulling up in the Lexuses, one on both hand
So I guess them GS'ses was ambidextrous
Could've sworn her breasteses was sending me messages
""K, I need a free hand-mammogram
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam""
So, say my name like Candyman
And I'ma come and fix you up like the handyman
But if you don't need a fix, girl, you gotta leave
You can't take that all at one time—you gotta breathe!

Yeah
I'm on my way home

[Verse: Common]
They say home is where the hate is, my dome is where fate is
I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles
Rubber band together in cashless bundles
We wear strugglin' chains, divided only hustle remains
Makin' sense of it, we hustle for change
Revolution ain't a game, it's another name for life fightin'
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson
Hypes fightin' for hits to heighten they hell
Don't he know he could only get as high as he fell?
Show money becomes bail, relationships become jail
Children are unheld
I wish love was for sale, ""Behold the Pale - Horse""
Got me trapped like R. Kel', I bail and it—
[Outro: Gil Scott-Heron]
Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again
I'm on my way home
I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone
Home is where the hatred is; home is filled with pain and it
Might not be such a bad idea if I never
Never went home again"

Stop all your blood clot cryin', I was flyin'
Made it to school with barely enough time to sign in
Yeah, I hear the alarm, yeah, I hear you, Mom
Yeah, yeah, I don't wan' be broke when I'm thirty-one
They said the best classes go to the fastest, sorry, Mr. West
There's no good classes, and that's what yo' ass get
Not even electives? Not even prerequisites?
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds?
Now I'm in the shop class or the basket weavin'
With all the rest of the motherfuckers underachievin'
Man, this is an insult
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Will I make it from the student loans to a Benzo?
Like old folks pissin', I guess it all depends, oh, oh
[Refrain]
Little girl (A-ha-ha-ha-ha...)
Please stop your crying (Stop your cryin', baby)

[Chorus]
I'll be late for that, baby, I'll wait for that
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that
I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right
I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that
I think I was made for that
So I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right

[Refrain]
Little girl (A-ha-ha-ha-ha...)
Please stop your crying

[Verse 2]
You know when you be late, you miss all the lights
That's right (That's right), that's right (That's right)
And when you get back she gon' start up a fight
That night (That night), that night
Baby, it's too late for that, lately, I've been takin it slow
Try and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close
With the freshest hoes, the professors know
We about to get real unprofessional
Like them Eskimos, what would you do for a Klondike?
Or two dykes that look Christina Milian-like?
Hmm, I'll be on time for that
I ain't thought of no line that could rhyme with that
Yo, I'll be there in five minutes, five hours later?
""I'll be there in five minutes,"" go 'head, ride with it
I'm so live with it, look how I did it
Been bullshittin' but I finally arrived with it
I know it's late and I took all year but
You can stop complainin' 'cause I'm finally here, yeah

Somebody told me Deltas brown-skinned, AKAs light-skinned
And they supposed to be bougie, so they got white friends
First day of school, I'ma take you sight seein'
Show you what we do on weekends for excitement

Last year, a nigga hit her, and now she only date white men
And if a nigga even wave at her, it's frightenin', but

The night fallin' over Brooklyn where they murder for change
The converter remains faithful to the drug dealer priestess
He in search of the word of fame, you heard of the name
Kweli the truth like I'm comin' out the mouths of babes
One foot in and one foot out the grave
Niggas want they reparations

Her tenement, yo, is rat infested
Her heart is like a gold bullion because she went and protested
'Cause her best friend's man got popped

Whether crime or rhyme, I heard the rebel pays
On the scene, tryin' to get green like everglades

And niggas wit' thangs ain't afraid of karma

What do it mean when you dream that you ballin'?
What do it mean when you never dream at all then
And you don't really know 'cause you can't recall them?
It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to

Maybe you could pull 'em up outta your dreams

There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no YSL that they could sell
To get my heart out of this hell and my mind out of this jail
There is no clothes that I could buy
That could turn back in time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back a piece of real life
Real life, what does it feel like?
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like? I ask you tonight

What does it feel like to live real life, to be real?
Not some façade on TV that no one can really feel
Do you really have the stamina?

For everybody that sees you to say: ""sign an autograph""
For everybody that sees you cryin' that say you oughta laugh
You oughta laugh

Back when I was livin' at home and this was all a big dream
And the fame will be get got
And the day I moved to L.A., maybe that was all my fault
All my fault to be a real boy, chasin' the American dream
Chasin' everything we seen up on the TV screen
And when, uh, the Benz was left
And the clothes was left, and the hoes was left
You talk the hoes to death thinkin' the money that the—

Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this!""
And I refuse go to the grocery store
Without some ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the American dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things

She's all about sex, pardon, check your facts
And the track record, I'm all about plaques
Shaking my ass half-naked, lovin' this life
Waitin' for Kim album to drop, knowin' it's tight
Standing center stage, closin' the show holdin' a gat
Since you opened up, I know you're hoping it's wack
Niggas screamin' my name on record, straight wildin'
Maybe I'll answer back when you reach a hundred thousand
This is ladies night, and the Mercedes tight
When I'm coming home? Maybe tonight
Leave my food by the microwave, kiss the baby goodnight
It's my time to shine, it's playtime tonight
'Member tryna stand my ground, know when I fall
I left your ass home alone, hopin' I call
[Chorus: Method Man]
Who got the illest pussy on the planet?
Sugar walls comin' down, niggas can't stand it, the Ill Na Na
True Absolut Vodka, straight shots
For the has-beens and have-nots, dollar, dollar
Bill, and it don't stop, we movin' up
First the mansion, then the yacht, sound proper
Straight cash get got
Bloodhounds tryna hunt down the Brown Fox, the Ill Na Na

[Verse 2: Foxy Brown & Method Man]
No more sexin' me all night, thinkin' it's alright
While I'm lookin over your shoulder, watching the hall light
You hate when it's a ball, right? Ladies, this ain't handball
Nigga, hit these walls right before I call Mike
In the morning when it's all bright, eggs over-easy
Hope you have my shit tight when I open my eyes
While I'm eating getting dressed up, this ain't your pad
I left some money on the dresser, find you a cab
No more, sharin' our pain, sharin' our maid
It's time to outslick niggas, ladies sharin' our game
Put it in high gear, flip the eyewear
Nas ruled the world, but now it's my year
And from here on, I solemnly swear
To hold my own like Pee Wee in a movie theater (Uh-uh)
Yeah, I don't need a man's wealth (Yeah)
But I can do bad by my damn self (Self), and, uh
[Chorus: Method Man]
Who got the illest pussy on the planet?
Sugar walls comin' down, niggas can't stand it, the Ill Na Na
True Absolut Vodka, straight shots
For the has-beens and have-nots, dollar, dollar
Bill, and it don't stop, we movin' up
First the mansion, then the yacht, sound proper
Straight cash get got
Bloodhounds tryna hunt down the Brown Fox, the Ill Na Na

[Pre-Chorus: Method Man]
Uh, vodka
Not, not
Dollar, dollar, stop
C'mon, c'mon, yah
It's the Ill Na Na

[Verse 3: Foxy Brown & Method Man]
No more waitin' to exhale, we takin' deep breaths
Ladies take this all from Fox, repeat this
Love thyself, put no one above thee
'Cause ain't nobody gon' love me like me
If he don't do the right thing like Spike Lee
Bye-bye, wifey, make him lose his Nikes (Uh, uh)
Hit the road (Yeah)
Mommy told me in order to find a prince, you gotta kiss some toads
[Chorus: Method Man]
Who got the illest pussy on the planet?
Sugar walls comin' down, niggas can't stand it, the Ill Na Na
True Absolut Vodka, straight shots
For the has-beens and have-nots, dollar, dollar

Fast Life,Kool G Rap,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","The time has come, we gotta expand, the whole operation
Distribution, New York, to Chicago, L.A
We gotta set our own market, and enforce it

[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
Champagne wishes and caviar dreams, a team that's gettin' cream
With sales of fishscales from triple beams
I gleam, livin' the life of Riley, packin' fifty calis
Rockin' lizard Bally's while we do a drug deal in a dark alley
Up in casinos, just me and my dino primo
Pushin' beam-o's, then parlay in Reno with two fly Latinos
Nas, he runs the whole staff, we count math from steam baths
We've seen Half-a-Milli Jackson out there on the Queens half
Three major players gettin' papers by the layers
And those that portray us on the block get rocked like Amadeus
Fakers get used as shootin' targets soon as the dark hits
Front on the drug market, bodies get rolled up in a carpet
Those that cheat us, try to beat us, we got hookers with heaters
That'll straight pop and put more shells in your top than Adidas
The leaders lookin' straight charmin' in our Giorgio Armani's
You wanna harm me and Nas?
You gots to come get through our whole army
The cee-lo rollers, money folders, sippin' Bolla, holdin' mad payola
Slangin' that Coke without the Cola
Me and black don't fake jacks, but we might sling one
It ain't no shame in our game, we do our thing, son
[Chorus: Kool G Rap]
Livin' the fast life, with fast cars
Everywhere we go, people know who we are
A team from outta Queens with the American Dream
So we're plottin' up a scheme to get the seven-figure cream

Everywhere we go, people know who we are

So we're plottin' up a scheme to get the seven-figure cream

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yo, I got guns from Italy, smoke trees considerably
Mid-state and Green, it seems, is where all my niggas be
The ghetto misery; shootouts and liquor stores
A perpendicular angle of the clout war
Police searchin' up my Lexo, but who's petro?
My tech blows straight off the roof and tests yo' respect, though
But dough don't respect me, it got me handcuffed
The rough life, I just be up nights, breathin' with scuffed Nike's
Pour my beers for my peoples under the stairs
These years, I got they names in my swears
Poppin' Cristal like it's my first child, lickin' shots Holiday style
Rockin' Steele sweaters, Wallabee down
Twenty-four carats, countin' cabbage like the Arabs
The marriage of me and the mic is just like magic
Elegant performance, bubble Lex full insurance
Guzzlin' Guinness, shootin', catchin' cases concurrent
It's Nas, seven hundred wives, King Solomon size
We on the rise, me and G — ghetto wise guys
The Luciano, Frankie Yale, Bugsy Siegel
Green papers with eagles from a trade that's illegal
[Chorus x2]
Brother, you've got to make it happen
Yeahhhahh yeahhh, get this money, yeahhh
Brother, you've got to make it happen
When you're livin' in the fast life, heyy, yeaaaah, yeah

[Verse 3: G Rap & Nas]
A-yo, our lifestyles' exquisite, yayo like a blizzard
Esquire attire, standin' on ground with one pivot
Two players rockin' silk blazers and diamonds like glaciers
Lands with name-brand seats, reclinin' like it's spacious
Bodies on ice, livin' trife, rollin' fixed up dice
Gamblin' Grants, handlin' stamps, moves are sheist
My bankrolls got the cops comin' in plain clothes
Tryin' to arraign our gang 'cause of our fame
That's how the game goes (True)
Right out the slammer with the fame and glamour
Cookin' up grams with Arm & Hammer
Supplyin' scramblers in Alabama
Rub out faces and leave no traces
My aces got mad body cases, preserve spaces at the horse races
Servin' us Dom, Veuve Clicquot
Dimes look magnifico, puttin' a cut inside perico
Heat for foes, shoppin' sprees with my fleet for clothes
In Caribbean suites deep, rippin' beats with flows
A-yo, we went from standin' on blocks without some socks
Sellin' rocks, to pickin' up stocks in boat docks with Glocks
And got poppy seed fields with million dollar bills
Packin' all the blue steel, we keeps it real inside the battlefield
Yeah, so here's a toast to the funds and things
Gun smokes in rings, graveyards is buried with kings
[Chorus: Kool G Rap]
Livin' the fast life, with fast cars
Everywhere we go, people know who we are
A team from outta Queens with the American Dream

Wordy,The Grouch,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","You gotta know the, um exact way to get your point across
(If you say so, if you say so)
You gotta have some game, some gab
(Well if you say so, if you say so)
A way with words, some shit

Well as I stand back and peep you
I'm seein things that the weak do
Words you should never say
Go on and save it for another day

Twenty-four years on the bullshit planet
Complained every day but boy cannot stand it
Harder than granite just to make ends meet
Harder than that to hold your tounge when you speak
One ""fuck you"" and you might get beat
One ""What's your sign?"" and your game turned weak
Names get ruined real quick when you slip
Wrong words lose jobs and fans from your dick
Oops I didn't mean that, they love it when I'm humble
Gotta make attempts to run it back after the fumble
Stumble on words and people think that you're stupid
If you do it too much then they may be correct
Well she gets respect cause of what she just said
And he gets head cause hes quick off the head
So much I've seen it, studied it, and mean it
Every time I speak, first I think
Well as I stand back and peep you
I'm seein things that the weak do
Words you should never say
Go on and save it for another day

Well as I stand back and watch you
I'm seein things that I gotta do
Words that I must say
Shit I wanna bust today

Bein somewhat cool it all comes from the mind
Knowin what to do is really how ya shine
When people act stupid then its just a cover-up
Nuthin else to think about, scared of fuckin up
Well know when to stop and how to analyze things
Learn about reactions different actions bring
Fuck bein with people who get me into trouble
`Cause when strangers get heated, then words count double
I bubble off silence, movements, and presence
Sometimes I lose it and use the wrong sentence
Then comes repentance, can you talk your way out?
Walk your way out without defenses
Tenses and timing, alliteration, rhyming
Gestures to go with the speach keep me constantly finding
New ways to be me
In my own place to be and how to function
In this society
Well as I stand back and peep you (you can be smart)
I'm seein things that the weak do (have no game)
Words you should never say (or you can have game)
Go on and save it for another day (and be stupid)

Well as I stand back and watch you (both of those don't work)
I'm seein things that I gotta do (reshape your shit)
Words that I must say (get it together)
Shit I wanna bust today

Well speak up and speak out
Don't doubt your own mouth
Hone what you can get together be a man
Well all you really are is what you really have to say
Don't let a day pass away without livin your way
Givin it your all well that will get you started quick
Learn from what you saw that will make you raw as this
A jewel for flawlessness, and rarely ever miss
I barely ever piss off a person watch the wordin
Every time I'm servin straight sense not a burden
Learn till its curtains and the world stops turnin
Fuck what they earnin we yearnin for real answers
Tryin ta build cancers and still make advances
Too little time not to be about shit
So I'm always on the grind, relateable when I spit
Well as I stand back and peep you
I'm seein things that the weak do
Words you should never say
Go on and save it for another day

Well as I stand back and watch you
I'm seein things that I gotta do
Words that I must say
Shit I wanna bust today

Well as I stand back and peep you (watchin you fool)
I'm seein things that the weak do
(shit is so stupid what some of y'all are doin)
Words you should never say
Go on and save it for another day (save that shit!)

Well as I stand back and watch you
I'm seein things that I gotta do
Words that I must say (gotta say some shit)
Shit I wanna bust today

Got hella shit to say
Tryin to say it right
Open right shit
Use the right words
Right body language and all that shit

Categorize your own thoughts- I'm gonna freestyle my life
Step where I like and make a print
I'm an inch away from bliss try to catch me but they miss
I'm like otherwise, on some other shit
You can't pinpoint or define this
Just highlight and underline this
I masterminded it
Don't expect me to say it for you
Show you through the door you can walk now
BFAP show me how, I have mighty strong legs
Extend them long ways, farther than the song plays
Deeper than a hard drive, brain is not a mega hertz
It mega-works, irks the unstable
Try to top my table but you didn't have the centerpiece
I dine on China, fine bone collection
Invite my folks to the supper serve perfection
Now we're all full
Awfully lawful to our own codes of honor
You sold out for a dollar
Somebody else named you a scholar
I had to holler during his moment of silence forgive me there's no science
Defiance? Defy what? Am I a free man?
Shouldn't even question myself- let Grouch be man

You can't take from me what you can't touch
You can't break from me it means too much

You can't break from me it means too much

This freedom's way too rough, it's way too tough

[Bicasso]
Freedom is a road seldom traveled by the multitudes
It comes from attitude
Bout ninety percent and the next ten percent wanna say it lies in talent
I mean- the ability to really do what you want
Everyone wants to come off fresh, don't front, but will you?
I'm talking about that dream in your head- that thing in you
In your heart that you said you were gonna do when you were like tennn
That's right, stop, think, and remember that shit again
Don't lie cause it's gonna show up, when you try
Freedom is a road with no toll, with no bull, no push and pull
Just a mastery of the let go
So are you experienced or have you ever been experienced?
For a lot of y'all- that's no
But show for yourself, and prove for your move but soon switch
Quit labelin this freedom I got like you thought it was some music
Biatch..

[Nebulus]
Open, let it all soak in
What's tight, and what's not so
What's right, and what's happenin
Got loaded get grounded
Soon was astounded by the big picture
The all, totality, full range between opposites- duality
Man I'm juiced off that shit and how it applies to me
For the fact that I'm always intact
Can't separate mind states and the way they interact
So with that, shackles disintegrate off the brain
Floodgates open, tasting the joy and pain
Some stay scopin, tryin to live through my escapades
Tryin to categorize, analyze, and put grades on that which simply is
And ain't trippin
Adaptin, flowin, constants will keep flippin
Follow the feelin, dealin with the hearin now
Ready to experience what life will allow
While ignoring the bickering from dudes who document
What I do contradictory, causing an air of agitation
Instead of seein what I'm beein in a situation

Look, look..

Now old Mr. Patterson
Had us in his front yard
Explainin' all the reasons why his life so hard
I took a seat on his porch, right side of his hammock
He told tales of mishaps, somebody ever had it
That way it made his strong he said
I could feel him
Destiny shuffled up his cards and had to deal 'em to him
Straight up, no second round
Second time around
No time to half step
Man, you gotta put it down
What he said made sense
He told tales of war
Conflicts with men
Money, the whores
And the women he came across
Times he fell in love
The children who abandoned him
Promised that they would love
Him
Forever
But they never visit
Benefits dwindle, holiday visits so spread apart
So sparse
Loneliness and ghosts of heart wrench
But no one, the darkest days start
Which enable him to remark
His days of the past
His old army buddies
The trenches
The blasts
Explosions of memories sent shrapnel to my psyche
Explainin' my youth
He said, ""You started off just like me
Got a hard head like me
Prepare for mistakes
But focus on your future
And you'll make it through the gate.""
The gate
The gate
The gate

[Luckyiam.PSC]
Building with a man who lived a life I want to grow upon the shoulders of an older stone, I claim to carry
Started with a smoking session, in the Arizona desert
I deserved a fact, I insert the habits killin' me slowly
To prove I'm old at heart
To native beings to this continent
And compliment
The dreaming sequence is seemingly constant
In a Living Legendary pattern
That's tattered and broken down, his name Willcro
The title (?) a blow to the ego that helped me and shoes
And intact, I lose to think I choose my destinal track
In simple terms he explained the way I function is wacked
The way I think attacks, my true purpose here on the green planet
Which is to share this wisdom, game in this life
I live under the name of the crow
I must know, I be stoked
Ancestry dating to ancient times waiting to die
I replied ""that's not my function""
""In life"" he retorted ""there's no room for assumption, no room for a puncheon, your not a violent person, silence is not the way to stay in the shadows
There's many battles
That have to be fought, the man's math is a tight ass way to be caught
Salem's lot, death is the gateway to the next plateau
[The Grouch]
Life life
Almost everything I know and have known I was shown
Learned how to innovate but never would have grown
To be 23, goin' on 24
Knowin' on many more occasions
I need to stay in the right mind state
To make my impressions felt
Like a lesson learned from being punished
Blessin' in disguise though really
Not wise, so silly to think
That momma didn't know what's right
So when I show I'm tight
She gets props
And when I deal with a fight correctly
Thank my pops
He would check me on the art of
Being a man
And when I thought I was smart
I really didn't understand
I really couldn't see the plan
Working
Kinda like Dan thought Miyagi was just jerkin'
Him around
While he painted while the sun went down
When truly it was knowledge he was lucky he found
I'm on
Solid ground
Put a dollar down to learn
If you got something to share
Go head voice your concern
Cause who am I to be the U.N.I. Verse (universal)
Alright, respect the dark to the light
And the young to the old

Come on, lets go

Welcome to the United Snakes
Land of the thief, home of the slave
Grand imperial guard where the dollar is sacred and power is God

Lets do this shit for real, come on now

[Verse 1]
Smoke and mirrors, stripes and stars
Stolen for the cross in the name of God
Bloodshed, genocide, rape and fraud
Writ into the pages of the law good lord
The Cold Continent latch key child
Ran away one day and started acting foul
King of where the wild things are daddy's proud
Because the Roman Empire done passed it down
Imported and tortured a work force
And never healed the wounds or shook the curse off
Now the grown up Goliath nation
Holding open auditions for the part of David, can you feel it?
Nothing can save you; you question the reign
You get rushed in and chained up
Fist raised but I must be insane
Because I can't figure a single goddamn way to change it
[Chorus]
Welcome to the United Snakes
Land of the thief, home of the slave
The grand imperial guard where the dollar is sacred, and power is God
Welcome to the United Snakes
Land of the thief, home of the slave

[Verse 2]
All must bow to the fat and lazy
The fuck you, obey me, and why do they hate me? (Who me?)
Only two generations away
From the world's most despicable slavery trade
Pioneered so many ways to degrade a human being
That it can't be changed to this day
Legacy so ingrained in the way that we think;
We no longer need chains to be slaves
Lord it's a shameful display
The overseers even got raped along the way
Because the children can't escape from the pain
And they're born with poisonous hatred in their veins
Try and separate a man from his soul
You only strengthen him, and lose your own
But shoot that fucker if he walk near the throne
Remind him that this is my home, now I'm gone
[Chorus]
Welcome to the United Snakes
Land of the thief, home of the slave
The grand imperial guard where the dollar is sacred, and power is God
Welcome to the United Snakes
Land of the thief, home of the slave
The grand imperial guard where the dollar is sacred, and power is God

[Bridge]
Hold up, give me one right here
Hold on
You don't give money to the bums
On a corner with a sign bleeding from their gums
Talking about you don't support a crackhead?
What you think happens to the money from your taxes?

[Verse 3]
Shit the Government's an addict
With a billion dollar a week kill brown people habit
And even if you ain't on the front line
When massah yell crunch time, you right back at it
Plain look at how you hustling backwards
At the end of the year, add up what they subtracted
Three outta twelve months your salary pays for that madness
Man, that's sadness
What's left? get a big ass plasma
To see where they made Dan Rather point the damn camera
Only approved questions get answered
Now stand your ass up for that national anthem

Welcome to the United Snakes
Land of the thief, home of the slave

Uhh, Tesmoney, all about the hunnies

And ya bitch said she want me like a Christmas gift
Mistletoe on my briefs miss, kiss this dick
You get dumped, I dismiss chicks

Uhh, gettin money like I'm 'posed to
You goin' postal, I'm goin coastal
Did you catch him on the seashore?
What did he whore? Louis V draws
Down to the socks, crackstones in my watch
Center ass niggas, when I ball you wanna block
AK*, And I ain't talkin bout a nickname
A-K They Spray like the room stink
Stay inside every sneaker, shoestrings
You talk, you watch, I do things
You hypothesize, I prove things
Gucci, Louis, Soothes me, ooweee
I get hoes on E don't fuel me
Shouts to my locs gettin money that's blue cheese
Your dreambroad is my R
I'm so fly, I'm so far
I buy shots, I buy bars
I ghostwrite, nigga you buy bars
Jesus peice, Oh My God

Below my draws, you broke like laws
Y'all niggas ain't hard, Y'all niggas just flawed

She wanna cuff but I'm like N-O
You know I play girls like Nintendo
Tesmoney bitch, I got the best flow

It goes however I want it to
These bitches never say ""can’t""
I just call her angel, she look like heaven in pants
Big house, couple rides
Call that shit Neverland Ranch
Tre Pounds, shoot fast, call that shit Kevin Durant
You niggas beneath me
Now go get fucking stomped, son
Know I run this city, I am Brooklyn’s Nucky Thompson
If they make me go in
I’m-a go right away
My fly ass can’t be stopped, no flight delay
Got a crew of bad bitches
Call 'em the Nice Girls
Yo bitches look scary
But she ain't no Spice Girl
It’s 9 AM when you clock in, you’re an office-worker
It’s big Ben's in my pocket, I’m a Roethlisberger
Coconut Cîroc and pineapple, easy order
Now I got this chick showing me what Yeezy taught her
Welcome to the funeral, pay respect
Me and your girl, unibrow, may connect, wait a sec
Let it breathe
{Deep breathing}
I said, ""Let it breathe""
{Deep breathing}

It's goes getting more money
It come with more problems
I used to be Mac-ing, but now I’m Steve Job-in’
See, you got two choices
You can stay broke or grind
Life is a bitch, and I’m just tryn-a Oprah mine
Gettin’ more money, it come with more problems
Man, I used to be Mac-ing, but now I’m Steve Job-in' man
Got two choices
You can stay broke or grind
Life is a bitch, and I’m just tryn-a Oprah mine

[Verse 2: Paul Cain]
Always been a squeezer, I’ve been on the hollow niggas
Always been a leader, no Twitter, I don’t follow niggas
Fuck a glass, drink Rosé out the bottle, nigga
I promised to keep it 1,000, you know my motto, nigga
Don’t just talk it, be about it
You talk it, but we about it
We do it, you read about it
Leave 'em, don’t speak about it
We live it, you dream about it
How could you even doubt it?
Couldn’t get a quarter round here
Unless we allowed it
This is our city, our town, our turf
We eatin’ and y’all thirst
Don't shoot back, bomb first
Get 'em gone first
Let 'em fire, arms burst
Regardless of size or status
Stuff 'em in that long hearse
I think I’m Malcolm X, Huey Newton
Marcus Garvey, I’m surrounded by my army
Dare a nigga try and harm me
Fuck what a hater think
How could niggas try to rob me?
If I’m out in Abu Dhabi, Ferraris and Maseratis
Fleets pulling up in Nobus and Ciprianis
Or that F1 race track, good luck tryn-a find me
Wherever I’m at, I’m smoking some Bob Marley
Seven-star hotels, you can see the ocean from the lobby
Riding in the ghost, riding to the coast
Believe the great deal of stress
I’ve been through the most
Changed my whole way of thinking, got a new approach
Fly private if it ain't first class, I’m through with coach
Street Fam for life, this we all owe the 'Los
Whole gang, bottles in the air
I propose a toast
We done seen the world
Partied with emirates
We all come from nothing, always remember that
So you should be thankful every time you spend a stack
For the all classy restaurants we ate dinners at
All the cars, Audemars with the different straps
But always strive for more, never be content with that

I rock a beat like wooh, other chicks kboo like they at the apollo
I get it crazy for you baby, been rapping since y’all was lil' babies

Déjà Vu,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'alternative']","[Intro: Matthew St. Patrick]
DMC, we have a mid-thirties male found down, unresponsive
Possible overdose, substance unknown
Pulse is 60 and thready
Respiration is eight
He's intubated and we're bagging him now
Uh, BP 90 over palp
Patient is cool, pale, and diaphoretic
Has aspirated, uh, GSC is 3
Will update en route, ETA: ten minutes

[Verse 1: Eminem]
As I fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime candidate for the gene
To receive the drug addict trait
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of NyQuil then I salivate
Start off with the NyQuil, like, ""I think I'll just have a taste""
Couple of sips of that then I gradually graduate
To a harder prescription drug called Valium
Like, ""yeah, that's great""
I go to just take one and I end up like having eight
Now I need something in my stomach 'cause I haven't ate
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
And you'd think that with all I have at stake
Look at my daughter's face
""Mommy, something is wrong with Dad I think
He's acting weird again, he's really beginning to scare me
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat Doritos and Cheetos
And he just fell asleep in his car eating 3 Musketeers in the rear seat""
[Chorus: Eminem]
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do
But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know that's a lie
'Cause I don't and why, I just don't know

[Verse 2: Eminem]
""Maybe just a nice cold brew, what's a beer?""
That's the devil in my ear, I've been sober a fuckin' year
And that fucker still talks to me, he's all I can fucking hear
""Marshall, come on, we'll watch the game
It's the Cowboys and Buccaneers""
""And maybe if I just drink half
I'll be half-buzzed for half of the time""
Who's the mastermind behind that little line?
With that kind of rationale, man, I got half a mind
To have another half a glass of wine
Sounds asinine, yeah, I know
But I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch, look out for the wall, aim for the couch, I'm 'bout to fall
I miss the couch and down I go, lookin' like a bouncy ball
Shit must've knocked me out 'cause I ain't feel the ground at all
Wow, what the fuck happened last night? Where am I?
Man, fuck, am I hungover, and goddamn, I got a headache
Shit, half a Vicodin, why can't I?
All systems ready for take off, please stand by
[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu

But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know that's a lie
'Cause I don't and why, I just don't know

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So I take a Vicodin, splash, it hits my stomach, then (Ahhh!)
Couple of weeks go by, it ain't even like I'm gettin' high
Now I need it just not to feel sick, yeah, I'm gettin' by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if DeShaun didn't die
Oh yeah, there's an excuse; you lose Proof, so you use
There's new rules, it's cool if it's helpin' you to get through
It's twelve-noon, ain't no harm in self-inducin' a snooze
What else is new? Fuck it, what would Elvis do in your shoes?
Now here I am three months later, full-blown relapse
""Just get high until the kids get home from school, homes, relax""
And since I'm convinced that I'm an insomniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep, so I take three naps
Just to be able to function throughout the day, let's see
That's an Ambien each nap, how many Valium? Three?
And that will average out to about one good hour's sleep
Okay, so now ya see the reason how come he
Has taken four years to just put out an album, B
See, me and you, we almost had the same outcome, Heath
'Cause that Christmas, you know the whole pneumonia thing?
It was bologna, was it the methadone, ya think?
Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos?
Your VCR tape cases, with your Ambien CR
Great places to hide 'em, ain't it? So you can lie to Hailie
I'm going beddy-bye, Whitney, baby; good night, Alaina!
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door
And wake up in an ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor, damn
[Chorus: Eminem]
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do
But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know that's a lie

Tobacco Road,Common Market,"['alternative', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: RA Scion]
I guess it has been a minute
And the south paw ain't felt right without the pen in it
Sent for incentive and sittin' submissive
But nothing bringing Jimmy back, you know that praying is a waste of wishes
I made a decision carry on, honor lives in the deed
Though the muse moves in decreased speed
Due to the wait, my dude lose patience with me?
Favor the Blue, you knew what I was training to be
I came for the taking of something they ain't seen back in Henry
The proximity to Knox's Fort's not given any but
Cause to envy Lord when have we fought the enemy?
With more that afforded, we're storming the port of entry
In memory of the James Clan, my symphony of the
Flames fan to conquer, when the song come on pay the band
Send a percentage back, Oldham owed, factor in estate tax
Or waive it if it goes to pave Tobacco Road

[Hook]
Some memories I kept
Others left, others I must have let go to protect
Hold a check for the row I set ready? No, not yet
Well lemme know and I'll return to collect
They never found me cause Valerie's boy had a different rhythm to play to
And he gon' use his tools to break through
Mindful of the nights in that state, who they say life is what you make it
When really life is what makes you
[Verse 2: RA Scion]
Paying homage, with a big nod to Aubrey
The schools failed me, thank God the farm taught me
The value of a calloused hand, how to work and plow this land
How even a modest crop will make your pop the proudest man
Harvest of a thousand fans, sans a gram of seeds broadcast
Through loud speakers, in the weeds I was born last
Profound effect on my volume, plus the readiness to fill it
In the field you should hear what they call 'em
Regardless I should have spent another year on the bottom tier
Instead of trynna dodge what it was I thought got 'em here
89 the number, 84 lumber another summer
Fightin' for cash to mash on the likening
Of cycles I've seen those not keen on college
Lost direction or went to be correctional officers
No opportunity was offered us, I had my sights on
Being gone before they cut the lights on, Ryan's song
Right or wrong, tie it tighter, I'm tired of buying into
Guidance gone awry, my father fought it with firearms and
Died in the trauma the violence spawned a child of drama
No wonder he's prone to wander, knowing his home is haunted
Praying that over yonder they still know
How much I love 'em I just had to go, had it with the status quo
They're asking me if I'll be back when I'm old
In fact, no these are my last tracks along Tobacco Road
But I'll forever call it home
And I feel it whenever I call home (X4)"

Then how come Independence Day
Is just a holiday

I get the feeling that this boat
I feel this boat
Is about to sink, cause it can't float
It can not float
And I get the feeling that we're close
I feel we're close
To the end of the pain that we all know
That we all know

Well excuse my expression
But I don't give a fuck today
So there's not much to say
Well I went to my bed
But crazy thoughts kept running through my head
I need some Sudafed
Well if you were my mirror
Then you would see a very sad look on my face
The life of Bobby Ray

[Verse 3]
Well if I gave you a few words to show my most genuine emotion
They would not describe the way I feel inside
Actually you would have to experience an explosion
So I, just learn to control em
Keep my spirit high to keep my kundalini flowing
Through the the seven-point chakra system
From my toes to the top of my head
And in between my shoulders
If you don't know than you probably can't focus
On nothing but the TV
So your mind ain't yours
You're getting lied to and you don't even know it

Eyes on Success,Buff 1,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: Buff1 & David Dallas]
We got our eyes on success, mind on our goals
Making ends meet that's how the money folds

We gotta stay level headed yeah, vision in the clouds
So world wide so we make our cities proud
Yeah we make our cities proud
And we want the finest things we allowed

[Verse 1: Buff 1]
Got a lot on my mind, need a lot in my pocket
Mike E gave me a shot and I shot like a rocket
Now I'm popping with models no sir rocking my bottles
My main thing so grown she be rocking my scado
You're just toddlers that follow whatever rappers say
Well I'm a rapper I say go to school and graduate
Hey if it's an ends to a means
If you got another plan man stick to your dreams
I know we all can't afford tuition in a school system like the ? fool wishing
But just know that success comes in the mind first
Shoot for the stars with guns blazing like Wyatt Earp
No matter the turf or the country that I rhyme
In that like mind this shine like high priced diamonds
And if you're realising what the nice life is
You can get us in the city for the right prices

My head to the asphalt, sipping on Jack though
Impressing chicks that ain't ever been to a rap show
She's trying to be down, she saying I got a mad flow
I see right through her I ain't trying to be sad though
It's all good though, we don't discriminate
She bumps George FM on the dinner dates
Dates swear deuces all into Real Estate
But this shit right here they can't imitate
It's the Bad Boy thing like Puff and B.I.G had
Can't You See, didn't Total sing that?
Really off the hook and I ain't gonna ring back
This retro classic's something to bring back
Always on that '80s shit, that some ladies shit

From them hard streets of Norfolk (Stop fucking around, man)
Motherfucker, to New York

You bitch-ass nigga, watch what happens
Check the shit, yo, ayo, ayo (Get on it man, for real)

They found his head splashed, caught him by the side of the building
He had a mask on, four-five, ""Why did you kill him?""
It was supposed to happen, clicked the shit back
""Yo, this is the deal, you get on the floor and lay in the grass""
Had me handcuffed, take two puffs of the kush
""I see you out here, your name's real, can't let you get touched""
He had a team, Japanese fiend, all of them greened down
Cheeba lit, blood on his Adidas was thick
One second homie, walked over, weapon was boney
Long-nose joint, ""Hold him"", grabbed the nigga head, broke his Roley (Damn, nigga)
""Where the blow shorty?""
Shorty start smiling, ""Y'all niggas is puss""
""Yo, Lex, these niggas, ain't vets, they gush"" (""Fuck that!"")
Chunk of meat flew off his cheek bone, broken teeth
Had a hole in his 'Lo shirt and took all his weed (""Gimme that!"")
Untied him, he fell, legs weak, and son wouldn't tell
Now it gets deep, son start falling asleep
They woke him back up, smacked him with the Mac, ""Where ya slut?""
""I heard you copped a new Beamer and them glasses is rough""
They was the Furla joints, eighteen karats, bought 'em right in Brazil
He had the steel on him, niggas went savage
They had him spread out, T position, opened his jeans up
(""Oh shit, this nigga had a gun on him!"")
Shot him in the leg-bone, he rose up like Kung Tut (""Ahh!"")
Still riffing, this why for real my niggas'll still get it
All of us yelling, ""He ill wit it""
Mouth bloody, muddy Gucci joints on
Them shits was nine hundred
Couldn't wait to kill him, his sons wanted it
Champion hoodie was gone
They broke his neck in like five places
Pushed him down the rail and then skinned his face

Bright moments, bright moments always come back vivid
The fifth grade was epic city-wide test pressure
The pre-crack era
Mr. Schumer, what a prick
Attitude match his wardrobe, uglier than sin
This is Bed-Stuy eighty-two
Ninth floor, three tiny rooms, one view
Bucktown, Roosevelt House
Their green grass is green; our green grass is brown
Shots rang, my phone wasn't touch tone
Were heavy beef in the street, E.T. had to flee
Great heavens, good grief
Hungry bellies, bright gold on their teeth
The windows on the Ave look like sad eyes
They fix their sharp gaze on you when you pass by
And if you dare to stand, you can see 'em cry
You can watch 'em scowl, feel 'em prowl
While they're steady sizing every inch about you
Fast math measuring what you amount to
The laughter, the screams
The numeral, the song of songs, the book of dreams
Ends don't meet where the arms can't reach
Mean streets, even when it's free it ain't cheap
On-going saga, terminal diagnosis
Basic survival requires super heroics
No space in the budget for a cape
Assume you gotta fly by night to save the day
Crash-landings routinely happen
Some survive, others never rise from the ashes
Watching asphalt and observing the Sabbath
Creates an Ecstatic and there you have it
From teenage love praying in tongue
Strange fruit, batty boots and native drums
From hence I come, so here we go
Signs and wonders all along the road
Some lies open, some lies closed
Some stretchers role with no lies at all
Some riders don't know what they ridin' for
Hands on the wheel and their mind is gone
Wherever you ride, whatever your lane
This road called life is a beautiful thing
And we are alive in amazing times
Delicate hearts, diabolical minds
Revelations, hatred, love and war
And more and more and more and more
And more of less than ever before
It's just too much more for your mind to absorb
It's scary like hell, but there's no doubt
We can't be alive in no time but NOW
It's just another shot to the heart
It's just a sure shot in the dark
It's just another place in the stars
Wonders on every side, life in marvelous times
Life in marvelous times
Hey! The Ecstatic
The temperature's rising everywhere
All over the world, you can feel it
All over the world, feel it
Spirits rise everywhere
It's just a sure shot to the heart
It's just a sure shot in the dark
It's just another place in the stars
Wonders on every side, life in marvelous times
Life in marvelous times

Pull up in a Porsche
Pull off in a Dino

Rise, and shine too

How I deflected all praises be
To the most higher I admire
Never will I abide by you
Cause you're liar and you’re not my sire
Can't buy me I just ride by you
And I won't bye-bye you
I'll buy ya lighter and set it on fire"
The Cause of Death,Immortal Technique,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Immortal Technique
Revolutionary Vol. 2, yeah
Broadcasting live from Harlem, New York (Yeah)
Let the truth be known

[Verse 1]
You better watch what the fuck flies out of your mouth
Or I'ma hijack a plane and fly it into your house
Burn your apartment with your family tied to the couch
And slit your throat so when you scream only blood comes out
I doubt that there could ever be a more wicked MC
'Cause AIDS-infested child molesters aren't sicker than me
I see the world for what it is, beyond the white and the black
The way the government downplays historical facts
'Cause the United States sponsored the rise of the Third Reich
Just like the CIA trained terrorists how to fight
Build bombs and sneak box cutters onto a flight
When I was a child, the Devil himself bought me a mic
But I refused the offer, 'cause God sent me to strike
With skills unused like fallopian tubes on a dyke
My words'll expose George Bush and bin Laden
As two separate parts of the same seven-headed dragon
And you can't fathom the truth so you don't hear me
You think Illuminati's just a fuckin' conspiracy theory?
That's why conservative racists are all runnin' shit
And your phone is tapped by the federal government
So I'm jammin' frequencies in your brain when you speak to me
Technique’ll rip a rapper to pieces indecently
Pack weapons illegally, 'cause I'm never hesitant
Sniper-scopin' a commission controllin' the president
[Chorus]
Father, forgive them, for they don't know right from wrong
The truth’ll set you free, written down in this song
And the song has the cause of death written in code
The word of God brought to life, that'll save your soul
Save your soul, motherfucker, save your soul
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I hacked the Pentagon for self-incriminating evidence
Of Republican-manufactured white powder pestilence
Marines Corps flak vest, with the guns and ammo
Spittin' bars like a demon stuck inside a piano
Turn a Sambo into a soldier, with just one line
So here's the truth about the system that'll fuck up your mind
They gave al-Qaeda six billion dollars in 1989 to 1992
And now the last chapters of Revelations are comin' true
And I know a lot of people find it hard to swallow this
'Cause subliminal bigotry makes you hate my politics
But you act like America wouldn't destroy two buildings
In a country that was sponsoring bombs dropped on our children
I was watchin' the towers, and though I wasn't the closest
I saw them crumble to the earth like they were full of explosives
And they thought nobody noticed the news report that they did
About the bombs planted on the George Washington Bridge
Four non-Arabs arrested during the emergency
And then it disappeared from the news permanently
They dubbed a tape of Osama, and they said it was proof
Jealous of our freedom? I can't believe you bought that excuse!
Rockin' a motherfuckin' flag don't make you a hero
Word to Ground Zero
The Devil crept into Heaven, God overslept on the seventh
The New World Order was born on September 11th
[Chorus]
Father, forgive them, for they don't know right from wrong
The truth’ll set you free, written down in this song
And the song has the cause of death written in code
The word of God brought to life, that'll save your soul
Save your soul, motherfucker, save your soul

[Verse 3]
And just so conservatives don't take it to heart
I don't think Bush did it, 'cause he isn't that smart
He's just a stupid puppet takin' orders on his cell phone
From the same people that sabotaged Senator Wellstone
The military industry got it poppin' and lockin'
Lookin' for a way to justify the Wolfowitz Doctrine
And as a matter of fact, Rumsfeld, now that I think back
Without 9/11, you couldn't have a war in Iraq
Or a defense budget of world conquest proportions
Kill freedom of speech and revoke the right to abortion
Tax cut extortion, a blessing to the wealthy and wicked
But you still have to answer to the Armageddon you scripted
And Dick Cheney, you fuckin' leech, tell ‘em your plans
About building your pipelines through Afghanistan
And how Israeli troops trained the Taliban in Pakistan
You might have some house niggas fooled, but I understand
Colonialism is sponsored by corporations
That's why Halliburton gets paid to rebuild nations
Tell me the truth, I don't scare into paralysis
I know the CIA saw bin Laden on dialysis
In '98 when he was top ten for the FBI
Government ties is really why the government lies
Read it yourself instead of askin' the government why
'Cause then the cause of death'll cause the propaganda to die
[Outro]
Father
Forgive them

Grandma or grandpa watchin up above

[Verse 4: Tha Trademarc]
Thanks momma, for all that you was
You a strongarm lady baby crazy with love

And taught me how to rebuild when the order collapsed
And right now I'm blessed no stress no less
And thanks hip-hop for givin me back focus, huh
Yeah John, what can I say?
It's all love from day one, you showed me the way

Love has healed my broken heart

We Do It For Fun Pt. 2,Tha Joker (USA),"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Every morning while you go to Starbucks to get coffee
I be at the bank like, get this cash off me
My car so new, but my money so old
My grill iced out, so my barbecue's cold
3-2-1: blast off, you bastards
Spaceship doors, my garage is NASA
Hedgehog game: I am much faster
You are a lizard, I am a raptor
When I hit the club or the stage, I party hard
Witness hoes naked, like everyday was Mardi Gras
See, I'm 17, and I have an accountant
You're 17, but you get an allowance
When I see pussy... I'm poundin'
What else would you expect from Tha Joker, clowning
Bankin' over here, what you want to drink honey
Blow stacks so it's like I give head to my money
I'm a studio geek, Urkel, Ned Flanders
Car sits low, chameleon salmander
Joker beats, lock up sell 3
White girl trunk stand Marshall Mathers LP
Even my haters, secretly they felt me
Last name West, there's nothing you can tell me
I am super sexy in my white tee or my wife b
Burn so many trees, Smokey Bear doesn't like me
Let's be honest, who really wanna fight me?
You can throw balls but I bet you won't strike me
Look into that future, see me in that Bentley
Check my bank account: don't I have plenty?
My hoes won't hump you, they're so stingy
I would acknowledge you, but I'm not friendly
Boys N The Hood flow, South Central rhyme
Godfather delivery, Scarface mind
Basically what I'm saying is I'm one of a kind
If you thinkin' 'bout battling me, ya thinkin' 'bout dyin'
Fakes, phony, please stop trying
I parade my gangster, what are you implying?
She can feel my bone all on her spine
Orgasm, back spasms: she straight crying
I fuck with ladies, I won't even watch whores
Don't shake hands, cause you prolly didn't wash yours
This shit is easy, I could do it in my slumber
And I make so much money, I should have a PIN number
Dumb and Dumber; where is your hunger?
Veggie eating bitch, here's my cucumber
Close your mouth, listen to me thunder
I am a pirate, I'm throwing my plunder
Black Pearl gangster, south side legend
You gonna need a notebook for all these lessons
Teacher, preacher, deacon, reverend
Whole damn Kenmore in my bezzle
I am the greatest there will ever be
Me to the rap game, is like fatback to peas
Chopper, semi, cocking, blasting
I flip birds: bluejay gymnastics
Street cred test? I motherfuckin' passed it
At least 20 grand in one of these elastics
I really don't like when haters throw sodium
I am the shit, please pass the Imodium
A-D, play me, you couldn't do it safely
I control the Roc, call me the new Jay-Z"
Chunk Up the Deuce,Lil Keke,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: Lil Keke]

Boys talking down, don't make me pull out the choppa
I chunk up the deuce for the south and the north
Boys talking down, I'll leave 'em on the streets dead
I chunk up the deuce for the south and the north
Boys talking down, I got them diamonds in my mouth

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
Well it's that grain gripper from Houston, Tex
That barre sipper, that barre, no plex
I'm straight up outta that Swishahouse
Where G. Dash write all the checks
So check the neck, check the wrist
I'm balla status from head to toe
My jewelry shop sell more grills than George Foreman
Baby now you know
That ain't a igloo, that's my watch
And that ain't snow, baby that's my chain
That's not a ice tray, that's my teeth
And that's not a snow cone, that's my ring
That ain't Kool-Aid up in my cup
I stay sipping that purple oil
I stay flipping the slab on fours
'Cause I'm a hustler 'til I'm in the soil
My wrist game is one of a kind
Patek Philippe worth a 100K
My work schedule out on the block
It's mash all night and grind all day
No 401K for a hustler
Just bleed the block and stack that paper
M.O.B. when it comes to hoes
And a .40 cal when it comes to haters
We authentic playas not counterfeit
Got a 600 Benz with a fog kit
Got hoes at the HK turning tricks
Outrunning the track, trying to make me rich
I'm too legit to quit, stacking up that paper 'til I'm gone
So I'ma be working wood wheel and catching splinters
Riding twenty inches or better in chrome
[Hook: Lil Keke]

[Verse 2: Lil Keke]
Don Ke! Houston, Tex, got the streets burning
Popping seals with them fours turning
Rookie boys, they still learning
Losing cash, I'm still earning
Get my bread when I shake the fed
Keep them dimes in and out my bed
Jump in the drop to convert the top
And let 'em bop on candy red
Leather seats with that wood out
They don't know what my hood 'bout
Tryna take the young don's spot
I'm platinum balling and still hot
Haters off in my mix again
Pimping broads plus pimping pens
Multiplying, I gotta win
Keep that ice looking clear as gin
Out the roof still chunking deuce
Riding slab and hopping juice
Diamond grill with plenty of skills
Just pass the mic and I let it loose
Independent still chasing bucks
22s on Porsche trucks
Model chicks with them big ol' butts
Killer clans with them big ol' nuts
Hit the club with my game tight
Hoes bopping my fame right
Did her thang the same night
Boys talking, it's all hype
Cut the check when I run my mouth
Rolling in green like I'm playing golf
Texas boys be going off
Representing the north and south
[Hook: Lil Keke]

[Verse 3: Pimp C + Bun B]
I'm from Port Arthur, Texas, represent it 'til I'm dead
Pimping almost died in the 80s, boys was scared
Bitches was on crack, and the 'Lac wasn't rolling
But the game done been revived cause now the south side is holding
Pockets stay swollen, what do we do with all this cash?
Drive '84 Biarritz with TVs jumpin up out the dash
Pistol in the stash even though I'm on parole
Nigga try me Try me with that fuck shit, bitch I'll leave your body cold
From the land of grain, dripping paint, 84s and a chrome grill
This Texas baby, dirty south, P.A.T., you know we real
We pack the Ks, Desert Eags, ARs and them 38s
We serving nothing but Chyna Whyte, playa we don't sell that dirty weight
Big Bun Beater, hold it down, rep the town to the fullest
Whether it be on the mic or in the streets busting them bullets
Don't put it with me, I won't pull it on you and leave you ventilated
UGK is back on the block and you marks is finna hate it

A military mind mean money (You knahmean? Talkin' that shit)
A criminal grind, nigga

[Chorus: 2Pac]
We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes
We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now can your mind picture, a thug nigga drinkin' hard liquor
This ghetto life has got me catchin' up to God quicker
Who would figure that all I need was a hair trigger
Semi-automatic MAC-11 just to scare niggas
Pardon my thug poetry, but suckers is born everyday
And fear of man grow on trees
Criminal ties for centuries, a legend in my own rhymes
So niggas whisper when they mention
Machiavelli was my tutor, Donald Goines, my father figure
Mama sent me to go play with the drug dealers
Henceforth, we thug niggas and we came in packs
Every one of my niggas strapped sippin' on 'Gnac
In the back, my AR-15
Thuggin' 'til I die, these streets got me cravin' thorazine
My lyrics are blueprints to money makin'
Fat as that ass that honey shakin'

I bust a trey-trey, buggin an' shit
They call it overthuggin' and shit
But I was just a younger nigga, gettin' older and lovin' this shit
But what was I doin' in this place?
To the fakes without a pistol in the first
Facin' termination in the worst
But I figured to play the wall; to watch all
These playa hatin' niggas position for I could see 'em all
Made it up out of there, lucky to be here to tell you
But it'll never be a repeat, people, I'm tryna tell you

Considered a BG, but I'm off in this game something deeply
My eyes only see G's, that's why I'm young and burnt out
Learned the know how, well how to do now, by 18 turned out
And wide open, to ridin' and smokin'
Collide with foes in the worst place

I breaks them off with this gangsta war story tale
Stacking loot up in the coupe that I protect with a Mack 12
Slap my clip in the chamber; fool, your life's in danger
No one will remain when I come through dumping insane
Call me Bo Loc Major Pain, gun-slang and moving 'caine
I be the nigga that's pulling the trigger
And dumping the hot ones up in your brain
More bigger balls than RuPaul, Thug Life fade 'em all
We bucks that ass up against the wall (up against the wall)
Havin' no sign of a man [?] call
We bucks them down on the way to the ground
Ain't nothin' but the hog in me

My whole family been raised on shit that ain't okay
Ain't nothing on this earth will make a nigga like me stay
I'm reminiscing, and catchin' flashbacks when niggas ran up
In my house and I was too young, to try to blast back
What happened then? No one would tell me since I was three
Heard that God took my peoples, now they living somewhere free
But fuck that, you got what's mines and I want that
Never drop my guard, been on the squad, since ways back
And now I'm sitting, holding in anger because my parents missing
Thuggin' Immortal when got some war stories for you

Never gave a fuck 'cause I was nobody's daughter
Outlawing from my tits to my clits, don't try to figure

Would you try to trip with my finger on the 9 milla

Sink slow sips of bourbon, etching out a dream
A page out of your notebook, images on a dusted screen
And lord knows I’m right in front of you
Mouth shut but I’m not gonna move
I won’t be here for long but that’s just how shit goes
Welcome to the Terrordome
D’evils knocking on my door but I’m never home
Papa was a rolling stone and he let ‘em go
So now, you understand why I’m better known
And any list they made, don’t try to write ‘em off
Any chick that I played, gonna fight ‘em off
Love the fireworks, yeah, let’s light ‘em off

Visions of grandeur, rolling across state lines
Midnight fit for exit, navy skies, perfect time

How my life don’t apply, don’t walk it out
And I don’t know what you want me to say, yo
But being ahead of my time kinda pay slow
And I pay no mind to these new cats
‘Cause I was doing this a few back
Ask the labels who said no, they knew that
Scared to market me, cut me down but I grew back

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
For ten months, I’ve been running from under-covers
I’ve been hunted by the hunter from the Winter to the Summer
From slums of underground to the youngest of the brothers
I’ve uncovered what they muzzled and tried to keep from public
Check it, I hear ‘em coming, couldn’t catch me if they wanted to
They want me under ‘cause they know that I’m the one to prove
That what they do is rob and loot and keep us under rule
And anyone who wonders why want to fall asleep in soup
You must have mistaken me, unshaved in face
Places me with all the other thieves
I keep discreet, only peeking up just to breathe
Eating when it’s needed, feeding mainly on my freedom
See, each heartbeat reminds time is unwinding
I could own up all the diamonds but still couldn’t buy it
So I’ve decided I will use my time wisely
Fighting to enlighten, yeah, clashing with the titans
Check it, with no fingerprints and no leads
I’m known as any slick, yeah no I.D
Police be on the scene and I’m motored to believe
In only a broken home and piece of debris
I’m leaving with the breeze just to choose ’em from my people
All there’s left to check is a note that reads…

[Hook 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Lush Life,Outasight,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Outasight]
Sitting back on my MC status
I ain’t good at math but I’m above average
This got a ring to it, no rush to marriage
Or ride the horse and carriage
But I am truly flattered, don’t make me blush
Grab my hand when I walk in but what’s the rush?
What’s up with my life being lush?
If looks could kill, watch the crowd go hush
Out the club in the morning light
To the diner for some grub, got an appetite for destruction
Who fronting on this real cool brother?
One of a kind style who don’t sound like another
Don’t hate me for being a life lover
I came from the bottom and look how I got ‘em
All in a frenzy, acting all friendly
Now where’s my umbrella Mr. Bentley?

[Hook]
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey
Welcome to the lush life
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey
Welcome to the lush life
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey
Welcome to the lush life
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey
Welcome to the lush life
[Verse 2: Outasight]
Put words together like I’m playing Scrabble
Triple word score, now make ya trunk rattle
Any new kicks? Yup, I got to have those
Dutch’s, we pass those just like with Tabasco
With anything I grub on, this ain’t no love song
Now everybody stop and say hey
And pretty young thing got me off the wall
Last shot of the night, this my curtain call
But I’m sticking around for the encore
‘Cause I got a little something but I want more
Hmm, makes ya think anything possible with a couple of drinks
Now everyone at the same time, say ho-ho Jinx
Knock on wood, the boy gon be good
Been long enough on the brink, think…

[Hook]

[Verse 3: XV]
Welcome to the life of mirages
Photo garages, Pablo Picasso collages
Hoes in my closet ‘cause wifey is home
Let ‘em out if they got it and my wifey is home
I’m talking gumball machines in the lobby
Hallway filled with Murakami by Kakachi
They say it’s hard out here for me, no Jirachi
But I just hear the crowd drowning out everybody
Shit, mama thought it never made sense that I could get boss
Like the soap at the Macent, this is my exodus
So which do they say exits it?
I don’t plan to ever exit the entertainment
Niggas came with, come out of divorces
Like dudes in gang support groups, they don’t claim shit
Until my time is up, welcome to the lush life, I see ya sign is up

As long as someone's there
I don't wanna be alone
It don't matter anymore what happens
From here on out, nice

With the same ol’ two step
Bounce around town, know what you doing
Ain’t the jealous type seeing how the fellas like
Running game all day, yeah, I let it ride
Damn, let's cruise, lost all my energy and blew a fuse
If the rules include what you do
The news for me to choose, a bruised ego is cool
What a fool, the man don't learn
Bought bags, bought jewels
Canceled subscriptions but then renewed
I don't mean to be rude, penny for a thought
So what a few stacks gon do or two?
Tied my noose, told me to hang loose
Swoosh, nothing but net, I guess I can shoot
[Hook]

So we doing real nice, a piece of advice
I’ll take the whole slice, I ain’t hear no bells
Don't throw no rice, blazer off white with a navy pinstripe
Right out Miami Vice, don't seem like the type
But damn that’s the life and I didn't choose it
It’s too confusing, use your illusion
Guns and Roses, flash Juxtaposes
35 millimeter black and white poses
56 and lotus as an added bonus, tell me if you on this
Even when I lie in bed, I'm being honest
Say good night and see ya in the morning
Wherever I’m roaming, looking for love ‘cause I can’t be alone man

Failure,Diggy,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Diggy Simmons]
I know you’ve all been waiting patient
The game’s been needing some stimulation
Too much faking, all the visual simulation
I’m all natural, y’all made from concentration
We are not adjacent, ladies say that I’m cute, haters say I’m a fluke
They try to ruffle my branches but never get to my roots
Don’t compare me to niggas that’s in my age group
If anything, compare me to people you’re giving praise to
Yawa, Jesus, y’all are all hateful
All the heat I gave you, y’all should be grateful
Stop treating a nigga like I’m in grade school
Spitting like a post grad, I don’t need a notepad
No jeweler but I be dropping gems like a topaz
I hear ‘em talking but I let ‘em rant
’Cause I’m a young baller coming up, Kevin Durant
Yeah I live with my parents but I bring revenue in
I don’t curse but your favorite words are two shorts
Lyrically, my aim’s to kill you lames like Newports
You can’t get me ‘cause I’m not even living
I’m dark matter, energy trapped in the physical prison
And my side you’ve been waiting for is finally risen
After the B.E.T Cipher, now you finally listen
There’s a few still hissing like an alley cat kitten
I’ll have you scallywags bitten from my lyrical composition
Yeah, I am he, yeah, let that breath
The underrated, underdog, underage, underestimated
But I will never be underpaid ‘cause I oversee ‘em, overpower, overthrow ‘em
Had to run for a minute but now it’s over for ‘em
I can run with the best of ‘em, shun the rest of ‘em
Oh that’s your idol, watch me make you think less of ‘em

Made You Look,Diggy,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Diggy Simmons]
Yeah, it’s been debated and contemplated if Diggy’s overrated
But what the haters have stated never penetrated, I’m so creative and innovative
And I stay motivated by the concept of famous and I ain’t even made it
The flow I cater is something major, an indicator of what happens later
It’s greater than you’ve anticipated, some people love it the way I does it
That’s why I leave them buzzing’ cause they calling me sick
Something like Robitussin, I hear you coughing, I treat you often with freestyle
And as I’m walking, the people talking, they see now
And I know rap for my age like Lil Bow Wow
Son of a king so why would I ever bow down?
Young lyricist uh, nigga be killing it
You hearing it the words out of my mouth, fresher than spearmint
It’s no experiment, independent appearances the way that I’m appearing
I did it without my parents but I’m still God-fearing
Filled with the holy spirit so I fly like an angel and none of y’all even near it
Life is just like a whip and I’m old enough to be steering
And now I’m born in Queens so Nas gave me the clearance

[Hook]
Flow stupid, I made you look
Y’all are slaves to a page in my Macbook
They didn’t know I could rap, I had them all shook
Yeah I’m a fashion nigga, here’s a new look
Flow stupid, I made you look

They didn’t know I could rap, I had them all shook
Yeah I’m a fashion nigga, here’s a new look
[Verse 2: Diggy Simmons]
Yeah I got ‘em looking so pardon me as I check my fresh
Manifest success and end up truly blessed
They hearing guesses about the ventures I’m doing next
Is there a problem? Just trying to be the best dressed
Well I’m just aiming to be the greatest and nothing less
Entertaining stadiums, radios as I progress
On my whole tribe, on the quest to be the best
So I came in the whole Q in the tip, living with no regrets
No stressing is evidence of my confidence
Cutting down arrogance but still being monstrous
Part of the problem is it’s all about the politics
And most of what they posting on the blogs ain’t as hot as this"

They know me this, yo I spit like a little kid
Rap thinks I’m a dirty hippie, icky
Harry Potter, don’t you try nothing tricky
Muggles befuddled by my wizardry
Pancake misery of all any beat
I am instinctively syncing my energy with the high heavens
Secretly developing a brand new pedigree, specialty, a better me
I essentially must defeat what is left of me
The evil me, may you rest in pieces
Recently deceased, I believe that world peace is easily in reach
If religion is decreased, eh geez
I don’t believe in Jesus, does that mean that I am a demon?
Couldn’t God and Allah have the same meaning?
Giving someone something to believe in?
'Cause these days between the TV and what I read
I don’t foresee a brand new way of living in the US of A
Do us a favor, I think we need to smoke some weed (Cannon)
Yes, excuse me waiter, where are my capers?
For real, I don't wanna be a pain in the ass
But I wanted some capers on this salad, yeah boy
And we act like they know but it’s clear that they don’t
So we bitch and we moan it won’t switch till we vote
And pick a new leader for the new year
Yes we can, did you hear? That’s the new cheer
2012, did you hear? That’s the new fear
So oh well, roll a blunt, get a new beer
Ash be the truth, sorry yo, I’m new here
Did not introduce me, I am so rude
Arrogant shoes, hell yeah, they be a new pair
You're pretty pail, hell oh well, tell me who cares
Who dares to play musical chairs with the fair-skinned Farrah Khan of hims?

They call me a terrorist 'cause I can embarrass the top ten

To my dogs.. wherever you are

[Verse 1]
Whattup Big? You know shit is rough after you slid
You in God's hands now, keep a place for me kid
Ain't nuttin' changed, still Party and Bullshit
We used to fuck R&B Bitches and see who rhyme sickest
For every hit you made, more rappers afraid to come out
Machine Gun Funk, from Queens I came through to smoke blunts
You came to my hood, we was broke
I wonder if we stayed that way, would there have been gunsmoke?
Still on the block around fiends numb from coke, I guess so
'Cause now with paper, shit is still ghetto
But fuck it black, you livin' your life, through your loved ones
Peace to your daughter and your newborn son
It used to be fun, makin' records to see your response
But, now competition is none, now that you're gone
And these niggas is wrong, using your name in vain
And they claim to be New York's king? It ain't about that
It's more serious, I plan to toast it up with you
Joke with you, happy we on top, the most official
Ain't too many real ones out there, I feel some but doubt they're
Capable to take it where you took it to
I missed your wake not 'cause I'm fake
'Cause I hate to see somebody so great in that way
I woulda stayed so long with so much to say
I had to put it in writin' to keep me and Brooklyn from fightin'
Tellin' me to pay my respects and move to the side
But I probably wouldn't have got off my knees to let people by
You can't kill nothin' that's Ready to Die
You was like God to us in the form of Allah

Still somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?

Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive

(Thug Life never die..)
Dear 'Pac, every thug sheds a tear drop
And use teeth to bite off beer tops and Pour Out a Lil' Liquor
You was more than just the wildest nigga
2Pacalypse, I understand your style, nigga
It's goin on the third year, since you've been gone
On the East and West Coast the same shit is goin on
The industry be talkin', offendin' me often
They don't believe you dead, wanna see you in your coffin
I can relate, shootouts and court dates
All Eyez on You, niggas in your face invadin' your space
You asked if I could trade in your place, how would I hold up?
How long would I ride before I fold up?
How did you know through your rhymes it was your time to go?
You predicted it in every line, all in your flow
There could Never Be Peace I have to quote
Can't believe I heard my name on ""the realest shit you ever wrote""
We had words 'cause the best supposed to clash at the top
But kept it brotherly, when we seen each other and stopped
In NYC, at MTV, people watched
We was both deep, after you left, I got no sleep
Think about how us real niggas would be
If we united, a nation of thugs, who could fight it?
You was caught in a wild homicide, or were you crucified
Like the son of God, when Lucifer lied
And make the world think, young blacks should be extinct?
But Thug Life'll never die, we stay high and just link
Will there ever be another MC as nice?
Will you return to us like the resurrection of Christ?

Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive

[Verse 3]
I wonder what the Commodores went through on tour?
Did Smokey Robinson, have to shoot his way out a war?
What has Al Green seen, that made him religious?
Was it the drugs, put an end to the music business?
If so, should I put out the indo right now and write down
A plan and pursue my dream, turn my life around
'Cause I'm bound for the movie screen, cuties that scream
I'll need a extra Uzi ridin' through my own hood in Queens
It be the ones you always knew, that want it on
Tellin' everybody it was him, that you fronted on
Thought we walked a million miles it was just twenty
Not used to walkin' in the path of legit money
I thought I made it but we only took baby steps
Up the success ladder, where they pay me checks
To my clicks when I got it I said ""Baby bless""
That was the 80's, but now look at this crazy mess
We in the 90's and finally it's lookin' good
Hip-Hop took it to billions, I knew we would
A lot of ups and downs in the game
Could lose or gain a couple pounds tryin' to maintain
One day you here, the next you not; when you around niggas, check 'em out
Some is 'bout it, most individuals plots
And run the spots, some choose to stay to theyselves
While others have no cares and stay in jail
More than 50% of us endin' up with holes through the chest
Through the head, through the gut it shows
The future for us young shooters and old killers
Who become rich as dope dealers?
Nothin' left for us but hoop dreams and hood tournaments
Thug coaches with subs sittin' on the bench; either that or rap
We want the fast way out of this trap
Whether it be 9 to 5 or slangin' crack
To my deceased Gods wishin' I could bring you back
But life is a dream and y'all taught me that

Uhh, yo
Yo

[Verse 1]
As the night close down on the Earth like gray dark rings
Light of cities in the nights, destination for Kings
With big dreams, like Castro, overthrew Bautista
From Cuba, and pointed nukes toward the U.S
About to shoot us for revolution; that's how you gotta move
A lot of rules, some locked in solitude
Curse the day of they birth confused, who's to be praised?
The mighty dollar -- or almighty Allah
I'm like the farmer, plantin' words, people are seeds
My truth is the soil; help you grow like trees
May the children come in all colors, change like leaves
But hold before you one of those prophetic MCs
With blunted flows, seven hundred souls in me
Each channelin', from past to present times, heaven shines
Light on those, innocent to how the world grows
Some men become murderers, and some girls become hoes
And you accounted for, everything that you heard
Do not speak to fools; they scorn the wisdom of your words
My heart is wise, bloodshot eyes, the saga never dies

Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners..

[Verse 2]
Yo we gotta be God's children, habitats in tall buildings
Rats crawl in filthy hallways, incinerators
Sinners who faithless, still there's hope, pray it's answered
Dreams turned real - what's a wicked nation?
One with blind men - not takin' charge of the situation
Empty arguments and real conversations needed
The world'll need it, to hear it
Evil tries to weaken my spirit - it's chronic herb
This hurt come from the honest word
I now try hardest to serve my maker, what I learned
Find it's way on the paper, so I could dictate it
Articulate it, luckily - I was put on one of the ships that made it
Through strong currents and winds that left the others stranded
To sink in the Atlantic
Satan jigs the planet, not to get too religious, but
Who decides when and if your life is finished?
If Christ is in this, for the sake of your name, oh Lord
May we break away from the chains abroad
[Chorus]
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners.. get up, wake up, rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners..

[Verse 3]
You wanna buy time? I'm the seller of minutes
I give you every second low-priced, if I sold lies; the truth is
Time waits for none of you, in fact
He can't wait for the date to snatch the ground right from under you
Small visions of better life if cheddar was right
Lurk in the mind, of young ones ahead of they time
Trapped in the slums, beggin' for nuttin' but takin'
Headed for nuttin' but the state pen, where they cousins be waitin'
Judges is not relatin' to pleas, guns bustin' where the kids play
Richochet off lamp poles and leave damp holes
In bystanders, get cancelled, D.O.A
Around the way where we from
Hope the future reduce the rate of those buried young
Life is every man's kingdom, a dyin' man's past
And a newborn's, first time to be here at last
And shouldn't have to grow up fast, and suffer our pain
Hustlin' harder than the generations here before he came
Goin' through the same bullshit as our fathers
Readin' history, but who's the authors?
For some the game is easy, for most of us the game is much harder
But never lose faith; through the years just get smarter
Ghetto prisoners.. ghetto prisoners..

Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners.. get up, wake up, rise

I'm the most wanted baby father, save the drama
We toast when I wine and dine ya -- all you need is me
I won't stress you but bless you
Mentally and sexual, we both intellectual
Can't forget how I met you;
You thought I was a boxer Prince Naseem
But I'm the mobster -- Nas from Queens
And when I gotcha - you riding with me
You keep asking, ""When do you have time for me?""
I'm never free always on the move, business oriented
Lifestyle expensive, attract women
You wanna search my pockets, and act all wild
Say I hurt your heart - ask how could I smile?
Wanna call back all my numbers - star 6-9 me
Check my car for rubbers, but quit trying
Before you find what you looking for and get to crying
You always saying what you gon' do if you catch me lying
[Chorus: Aaliyah (Nas)]
You won't see me tonight
You won't see me tomorrow
I'll be gone by daylight (doubt that)

But you won't see me tonight (you don't believe that)
No you won't see me tomorrow

Caramel kisses of Jezebel's sister
I feel no guilt when I twist ya
Turn the other cheek when I see the next freak witcha
You got your name on his lease, copy his keys
That's your lil' spot where you rest your wig piece
Go 'head and live baby, I know you his lady
You page me, when you got the day free
But I be out with my peeps in them system Jeeps
You wanna lay up in the sheets of presidential suites
Like I'll massage you while you massage me, mami
But can you hang with a young man who's doing his thang?
Speak up, I wanna know if you can keep up
Timberland boots for girls, with the tree stump
Baggy sweatsuits, mystery what's underneath them
They for my eyes only, you call me when you lonely
But I like to make the baddest girls wait, I got G baby

Thinking of me, you getting the chills
Like a rush through your body when you think how it feels
Give me a call and my voice give you butterflies in your tummy
Tell your friends you in love with Nas, not his money
And I'll prove I'm a man of my word - handed you furs
Iceberg, everything on this planet Earth a woman desires
You make a good wife to most men
I know I got you open
But -- you just my close friend
Get it baby

The 99 to 2-G computer shutdown, what now
Extension on Earth, human cutdown
Niggas play with PlayStations, they build a spacestations
On Mars plottin' civilizations
Dissin' us discriminatin' different races
Tax payers pay for more jail for Black Latin faces

Fake black leaders of puppets always talkin' 'bout the city budget
The news got it all confused lyin' to the public

Water floods predicted, hurricanes, twisters

People reverse the system, politics verse religion
Holy war, muslim verse christians

People in power sit back and watch them slaughter us

Now, that's for anyone asking, give me one, pass 'em
Drip-drip-drop—there goes an eargasm
Now you cumming out the side of your face
We tapping right into your memory banks (Thanks!)
So click it or ticket, let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattling, like two midgets in the backseat 'rassling

Turning left, turning right, are they looking at me?
Well, I was looking at them, there, there, on the dance floor
Now, they got me in the middle, feeling like a man-whore
'Specially the big girl
Big girls need love, too—no discrimination here, squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
And let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak
Skinny-slim women got the cameltoe within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them
Give them something to remember
Yell out ""Timber!"" when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep breath and exhale
Your ex-male-friend-boyfriend was boring as hell
But let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail: on the low, ho

Spark It Up Intro,Jay Electronica,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Fresh out the gate its the Asiatic
Fanatic back at it
Spitting black magic
Create a world outta black fabric
Sparkled the life
Spark it with light
God stay visible
My du-rag create sound waves I'm Jay Pivotal
Spun the cypher running with Christ plus I'm a sniper
One with the dice one with the mics and nobody's nicer
I payed the price-ah
And now I'm heating up the rostrum
Sucker emcees get struck to they knees playing possum
Rap gods insane
Lyrical Messiah, Jesus baptized in a flame
Sanitize they brain
What's the origin
Ten thousand sons up in my squadron
We break down then build back up to form an organ
The flows natural
The inner-glow is celestial
The physical mold that's just the clothes for the astral
Extra-terrestrial
Emceeing supreme being
All eyes seeing
Master the seen and unseen
And what year was that when the atom was cracked
In the materials of darkness she laid on her back
She knows all about you
Because the womb of the mind is the wo-man
That x chromosome came up out you
My rhymes like sperm cells thoughts for tales
Reproduce like sperm whales sharks and snails
Hit your gray matter
Then they excrete the data
And gestate for nine months above the bladder
This the most mathematical style that you heard of
And every verse I spit bitch it kicks murder
And like Roberta Flack
I'm killing you soft
Drawing you up in the fire midst revealing your thoughts
When Allah and his Christ bust through the ceiling with hawks
In the face of the earth meet the tip of the drills with a spark
That's the judgement
Its grievous man
This population face to face with this Jesus man
Came to his own but they mis-perceived the lamb
Four-hundred years of slaving for the seeds of Abraham"
Roasted,Curren$y,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Trademark Da Skydiver]
It's been a minute let me get with it, as I roll up
Niggas been waiting on trade like whats the hold up
My only mission in life was to blow up
They ask what I throw up
You know what I rep and I'm one of the best
Supervillian in the building I'm clearly a threat
Been doing this here for a minute considered a vet
A lot of niggas want me to fail cause they know that I'm next
That's damn near impossible this game ain't got rid of me yet
I fell of and I crawled and regaining my steps
This time around I'mma give all till im gaspin for breath
I stay silent on a lotta shit quiet is kept
But I dont know too many niggas with silent success
So I write it all down to get it off my chest
The weed we break it all down to get off the stress
Niggas hate, fuck 'em, cause they know that we the best
It ain't my fault I do this shit without breakin a sweat

[Chorus: Trademark Da Skydiver]
I'm just laid back chilling posted, living like a villian mostly
High off this purple shit, no lie I'm flyin I'm so roasted
Money, bitches, Testarossas, Veuve-Clicquot, few mimosas
Bring them thru my ups and downs life is like a roller coaster
[Verse 2: Curren$y]
The more I smoke the smaller the doobie get
They takin shots at the jets on some John Woo movie shit
All blanks I'm unscaved untouched on my way to the bank, what the fuck?
For tryna play Spitta you shall forever remain
Without a name, lames know what I claim
Upset they all throw up my set from the sunroof of my car
Seats butter baguettes
Bitches crumbling nuggets I'm feeling lovely and blessed
Tribeca at Bubby's I'm enjoying a lemon press not that Minute Maid crap
They squeeze these lemons they selves
The hearts of women melt when Trilla lyrics are felt
Olympic swimming in bitches Micheal slash leon phelps
High bread weed money tree slang for dummies
Get it crackin like lobsters ice vodka and the bong's bubblin'

[Verse 3: Young Roddy]
Me with a record deal yea they said I couldn't get it
My homie Ferris told me you couldn't hustle for a living but
That Richard Porter money had a nigga driven
And word to my nigga Stan I was bugging for a minute but
Look how the tables turned, they still spinning
The homie flew me from Kenner to N-Y city yea
My uncle told me let the sky be your limit
I was cool with a kid in the kitchen who was a chemist yea
And far as bread, mama told me make plenty
So it's money in my bank account and money in my denims yea
In high school them girls used to blow me kisses
But it's money over bitches, Roddy all about his Benjies
Shout out to Spitta, they wear us out like Fendi
Let's hit the Chi where the weather much windy but
But me I'm from the dirty, the dingy, the south
Where everywhere we at we smoke it out

Nobody seems to care we so complacent with the vacancy
See, the love is gone with one another, it's hard
Nobody rep for the skins, they busy cheering them stars
It's ironic, it's the same for the artists
Rather than buy our songs, they busy cheering the stars
A lot of drama, a lot of beef
We have so much in common, starting at the feet

This why I hate it here, though love it, I made it here
We all here, from the dealers to the kids
To the squares to the fly, one thing we are aligned with
Black on black Nikes that represent the lifeless lives
And it reflects the plight of those fighting so
If we ain't right and always at the throats
Of one another at least we got our Goadome Nikes
A metaphor, for the insecure
If you ain't wearing no color, can't nobody say nothing
One can never be judged when he dress like his brothers
Melancholy we are though we all learn to love it
Pessimistic we are, carry odds like luggage
And thru all our troubles, we still walk around walk around

Don't even know her name until I know her taste right
I said my game tight My game tight
Don't even know her name until I know her taste right

Passion that she's asking for Her man always slacking, no?
That why when he outta town I make sure she is not alone
That's when she gon hit my phone and tell me what's been goin on
Tell me whats been on her mind and im inclined to know some mo'
Tired of the normalcy, 9 to 5 is all it be
Cubical small as shit and coworkers is talkative
Burnout phone, don't call the crib boyfriend on that jealous shit
He fathers her only kid that's why my homies let him live
But Friday night she gon make him babysit we gon blow that haze a bit and get away from all of it See it's not right but it's okay you see our love is just not the same cause any woman lacking love deserves is entitled to a get away

Good love then I can do that for her
I can do that to a nigga and make a pool on her
It's temporary lust you need an in showing
And for the time being lets me in love with the moment
Okay you dancing drinking on your last one
Im just tryna poker face that's why I got my hand in
Grown man shit tonight no romance shit and you should make this bedroom like Monday night at magic
Like a (Gigi mcguire?) now let me up inside
I give you that massage, good hygiene is required I don't want no dirty junk
I just want a girly girly that own a rack of Jordan but don't sport em cause she love her pumps
Give my love to no one else kiss that cookie til it melt I am going underwater...micheal phelps

Hey... hey! New Boyz

[Verse One: Legacy]
I remember when Pharrell used to rock the tight jeans with ice creams
While riding his skateboard it was like sightseeing
To lames who was afraid to change
If my middle finger could speak then I'd say the same
Nigga I must state my name, call me Legacy bitch
Mrs. Sweetheart, a.k.a let me see tits
Doin too much like a Marvel backflip
Jeans stay skinny like I starve my fabric
Where the haters at? Hello I found you
No I don't give a F word about you
I do me, leave us alone
Why don't you do you and go hump a clone, get it?
Ai, another damn thing
You'll never see me care about another man's jeans
I don't even know, like all through the years
Seem like everywhere I go the only thing that I hear is

Da-da-da-da New Boyz, Da-da-da-da tight jeans {*2X*}
""Oh my God, why they jeans so tight?"" (Oh my, oh my)

[Verse Two: Ben J]
Look, I'll scoot back let me give y'all your shot
Now get money, best believe I'mma get mine

Why y'all niggas hatin on my skinny jeans?
Fresh kicks like I copped a magician
You must be missin the simple fact I'mma get it
And you ain't with it, baggy clothes n outfits
You like this, brothers actin stiff like cactus
They comin' off hard but they soft like fabric
They lyin', sayin they the best like Khaled
They chose me, it's obvious I'm meant for the best
Skinny jeans sag low and I know y'all know the rest
I'm Ben J fool, why these dudes wanna trip?
Even though I like to flash, get it jerkin' in my kicks

Bright colors is here, New Boyz is near, ha!

Ha! Get tighter, as the ghost of Mike rises
Tight jeans, naw nigga, I don't get hyphy
So you think you can dance in them fake Nike?
Lock your old ass down, lil' Ron Isley
I've been icey since minute maid made Hi-C
Telling me she Pisces, don't do signs, do check signings
Tyga tyrant, I'm with the power, with the diamonds
The fame will blind ya and bitch yeah I'm fuckin blind
See no evil, below the zeroes
More funds to free throw, house got the strip pole
Leave your jeans at the door girls with the speedos

I'm grown I don't do those, New Boyz with new dough

State of Clarity,Guru,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Common]
My mind blows decisions, at times indecisive
I think about the paradox that life is
Keep my head to the sky and understand what Christ is
Turn off the news 'cause every day is a crisis
Lifeless *niggas* on the couch weeded out
It's certain types of *niggas* in my life I weeded out
I believe in the route of soul before paper
No gold before labor, truth told with no glaziers
Days are getting darker quick
I was told it was written, I'ma author it
Wanna go the same place that the martyrs went
The black figures on the wall in my apartment
Like LaDainian, y'all, I be charging it
Touching down with the people from my town
It's the Chi that be giving me my ground
Dug in the crates of my soul and I found… clarity

[Chorus: Guru and (Common)]
Be yourself (ah, and be so clear, come on)
Ayo, just be yourself (and be so clear)
So just be yourself (y'all be so clear)
C'mon, just be yourself (and be so clear)
Be yourself (yeah and be so clear)
Ayo, just be yourself (and be so clear)
So just be yourself (y'all be so clear)
C'mon, just be yourself (and be so clear)
[Verse 2: Guru]
Toiled in the trenches, faced judges on benches
Betrayed by some that I fed, not to mention
Standing here now in the best condition
Up outta the dirt so I suggest you listen
See, money can't make you or me
Protect my mind with nines 'cause it shines more than jewelry
Used to do things that weren't too productive
Now I breathe life into mics for your comfort
I see past the groupies and golddiggers to fine women
How I'm living? Doing me and not savagely driven
Taught the game of fortune and fame
So I'm not playing no more, I hold the torch with flames
I've lost and gained at the same time
MC's biting and swagger jacking still commit the same crimes
Once you see past the surface
That trash is worthless, with me you get a lasting purpose

[Chorus: Guru and (Common)]
Be yourself (and be so clear, come on)
Ayo, just be yourself (and be so clear)
So just be yourself (y'all be so clear)
C'mon, just be yourself (and be so clear)
Just be yourself (ah, and be so clear)

Center of Attention,Wale,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: Wale]
I call a spade a spade
What you want me to say
Say I’m destined for fame, well I am very afraid
Do you know what fame is?
If you did, you wouldn’t want to be famous
Everybody finger point in your direction
Everybody seems to misread every sentence
Better or worse, the center of attention
Gift and a curse, the center of attention

[Verse 1: Wale]
See I wouldn’t wish success on my worst foe
You see the devil is alive but he work slow
And yea I should’ve seen the signs by my first quote
Before you sign, you’ll be blind if you’ve been broke
And true I’ve seen better times cause I’m getting dough
But my vision has inclined to some Interscope, and its home
This country has an obsession with celebrity
But, who is to blame when we let them in on everything
From B’s wedding ring, to beef meddling
Ironic we on air, but they never let us breathe
We all make mistakes, why you wanna make an issue?
If I don't diss another nigga you dont get that issue
I don't really get you, see what the problem is
Keeping up with Khloe and Kim, not the Obamas is
You tryna find where Rihanna is
To be honest you ain't minding where Osama is
And its not a big deal, its a small affair
Fuck Barack’s change, we’d rather talk Milian’s hair
And if the sky fall tonight, we all be alright
Just tell us where all the stars is
[Hook: Wale]
I call a spade a spade
What you want me to say
Say I’m destined for fame, well I am very afraid
Do you know what fame is?
If you did, you wouldn’t want to be famous
Everybody finger point in your direction
Everybody seems to misread every sentence
Better or worse, the center of attention
Gift and a curse, the center of attention

[Verse 2: Wale]
Nah, I wouldn’t wish fame on my enemy
Paparazzi like a life time sentencing
No comma, no pause, no anything
Just know fame has a price, lose everything
DC has never seen such progress
So bitches on the scene seem quite stalkish
They like talking, its like gossip
How little hugs can turn to draws offered
Though uncalled for, they gon drop them
And your girl's cousins tryna get her other options
And now your best friend's having kids
They two now, and haven’t seen their godfather yet
Don’t let me talk about the deal ones
Mommy found out I’m paying everybody bills
Big said it, more money more ills
So I spend it real fast, cause I’m tryna sit and chill
A lil, signed, sealed, delivered
Before a nigga signed I had a healthier liver
Shit, now my lips liquor-ish
As my record label nitpicks at this
[Hook: Wale]
I call a spade a spade
What you want me to say
Say I’m destined for fame, well I am very afraid
Do you know what fame is?

Finite,Tom Scott & Chris Marco,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Tuesday December 15th, 2009
I flick past it's page on the photo album of time
Like its another day gone, flushed down with the slime
Another day my Dads drowning in wine, out of his mind
And I wonder if Albert would mind, that he was bugging out
.. but really I'm no one that time gives a fuck about
I'm nobody that history knows, just another dude spitting his flows

At the traffic lights picking his nose
And todays another day of normal business
Another day that time gets killed. with no witnesses
Another tree that falls in the woods. with no listeners
There isn't no significance and this is what existence is
Its really just the luck of the draw
Like plucking at straws, or digging out a bucket of balls
While one dudes scrubbing the floor, nothing at all
He's looking at another dude that's framed up on the wall

It's all kinda like a fluke, it randomly happens
It's really nothing more than some scattering atoms
That started with the crash of two masses of gasses
With no reason, but that's the reason that it matters
Cause if there isn't even a reason for being born
That makes life even more important than it seemed before
So I don't needa be adored or even ever seen at all
Either or, I'm gonna be, without somebody keeping score
So it don't trouble me, I pour another cup of tea
Turn the news on and watch another cat up a tree
Its real life puppetry, I'm just another bumblebee
Getting money for some honey, buzzing, but it doesn't mean
It doesn't mean nothing, cause at the end of it all
I might be finite, but so is the great wall
Shit even the sun stops beaming its light
So I love my meaningless life
It's like that"
Saviour,Lights,"['alternative', 'pop', 'r&b', 'blues', 'jazz', 'hip hop']","[Verse 1]
The night is deafening
When the silence is listening
And I'm down on my knees
And I know that something is missing
Because the back of my mind
Is holding things I'm relying in
But I choose to ignore it
Because I'm always denying them

[Verse 2]
I'm a bit of a manic
When it's not as I plan it
'Cause I start losing my head
And then I get up in a panic
Remember when we were kids
And always knew when to quit it?
Are we denying a crisis
Or are we scared of admitting it?

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to know
[Chorus]
I just want to run to you
And break off the chains
And throw them away
I just want to be so much
And shake off the dust
That turned me to rust

[Post-Chorus]
Sooner than later
I need a saviour
I need a saviour

[Verse 2]
It won't ever change
If you want it to stay the same
I really hate it, but I know
It's hard to choose if you're chained
And when it's all you control
'Cause you got nothing else to hold
You're getting tighter and tighter
It's getting harder to let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to know
[Chorus]
I just want to run to you
And break off the chains
And throw them away
I just want to be so much
And shake off the dust

Sooner than later
I need a saviour
I need a saviour

Stand me up
And maybe I won't be so small
Free my hands and feet
And maybe I won't always fall
Save me

I just want to run to you
And break off the chains
And throw them away
I just want to be so much
And shake off the dust
That turned me to rust
I just want to run to you
And break off the chains
And throw them away
I just want to be so much
And shake off the dust
That turned me to rust

Pacman, how in the fuck you think we gon' do that, man?
Riding round Old National on eighteens without no gat, man

Me and my nigga, we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times, swung hard when it was fitting
But now, we tapping the brakes from all them corners that we be bending

You know, how to work bread, cheese, and dough from scratch
But, see, the catch is you can get caught
Know what you selling, what you bought, so cut that big talk
Let's walk to the bridge—meet me halfway
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
It's them poor babies walking slowly to the candy lady
It's looking bad—
Need some hope like the words ""maybe,"" ""if,"" or ""probably""
More than a hobby
When my turntables get wobbly, they don't fall

Made it describe how I push hard in
Through the streets, and at the same time I was pushing the margins
So far to the left that I ended up writing on my desk
Yes, I'm from a concrete jungle, that'll make your set look like bush gardens test
Who wan' touch the Juan Don, Von Dutch
Niggas want none trust, please believe
I don't give a damn how gassed up or eager he is
It started won't stop, who don't
Want us to blow like bomb squad well fire on guard
It's Lupe touche
Coup de Grâce, now put them in the trunk like the roofs are our cars
Yeah, rappers is like Sonny
When I'm in the booths with my bars
A mind full of poison, a mouth full of flu and a lung full of SARS
Fresh from the mayonnaise jar
Prepare to break it down, get your razor blade's paw
[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
But it wasn't easy to crack it, we wasn't fly
Had to get it off the ground pedaling
E.T. was in the basket, now it's sick
1st and 5th on the come up like the last bullet in the clip
Click, a few didn't survive
It triggered something inside that gave me power, got a grip
Like the floor of the shower, now I hit
Anything that I set my sights on, no lights on
Silence is my 5th plead the 5th
I don't need a Japanese flag, Vash the Stampede of hip-hop, straight from the hip
Bang, no matter how the enemy bolsters I'm going to hold us down like the holdsters right up on my shoulders
Clappers, why don't you wait some more
Fire, it ain't safe no more
Cocksuckers pull backwards
I pull faster it's master
I haven't turned into guns like MegaTron
You just brushed upon the upper echelon, gone

[Verse 3]
Pops said they won't follow ya if your points is hollow
So it made vocal, the ad-lib I bring focal
To bad kid, shed light on troubled youth
Fed, egg rice and noodle soups
Explain all their rules and roots
But not enough to incriminate
Just enough to demonstrate
Why they're confused as youths
Are easily amused and consumed with hoops
Spar greedily for cubes and refused the truth
Followers, easily subdued by flutes
Swallowers, of anything the bandwagon hands them
Well listen to me, telling them to listen to me
Refuse my rules is ? scoop
I'm finna take you to my zone
Take you to my home, please remove your boots
Not the spook who sat by the door
But Lu' who slept on the floor
That you stepped over all these years
Waking up, coming back for yours"
On the Real,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Marley Marl]

[Sample]
On the real, all you crab niggas know the deal

[Intro]
Yeah, finally up in this nigga
Let's pay homage to Illmatic
Let's put the crown where it's at 10 years
Never been done this real by nobody

[Verse 1]
To my seed, may I lead you into no greed or evil
In the categories of stories I breed my sequel
You know the money, blues, blunts, broken 22's
Monkey see, monkey do, shorty sipping sunny dew
Now it's V.S.O.P. in a Phantom, mad smoky
Murder trees, cruising gat in the stash so it won't poke me
Up in the Trump Plaza, Suite 3010
Don't make no noise cause we dirty, tell 'em hoes hurry in
We got the room lit up with perfume and mad boom
And there's video taping blooming asses on the zooming lens
Rollin on you nondescript niggas, you're marked for death
Like Colombians with bad coke that gyp niggas
Tilt the dutch, twisted up the uwee if you're skilled enough
In Will we trust, salute the dead the nine mili busts
[Interlude]
That verse is ten years old, nine and half years old
Street's Disciple, the rebirth comin at you this year baby, it's on baby

[Verse 2]
To the hood, may this be the day that we pop them bottles
This is mandatory, what if there's not tomorrow?
You know the murder rate, jealousy, you heard 'em say
He say, she say, I'm 'bout cheddar, he don't deserve to make
Sipping clear liquor with niggas, that talk sideways
Listening close, to every word in case they violate
Up in the projects Apartment 5D
Spark a lea' it's 'bout the reed, counting everything the block see
We 'bout to need to take the corners from them cowards
Get it on so y'all can move more coke powder, by the hour
Hold in case we gotta rip niggas, loaded
Teflon coated projectiles'll flip niggas
From ninth grade to lightweight to grams to my mans with guns in hand
Police vans, they missed the summers again

[Verse 3]
Yeah, power to the people, death to the phonies
This beast to the mic one two check, y'all fed-e-rallies on me
And they look like you approachin me like how you, homie?
The F.B.I. see only one problem, they try to slump me
After the young black male cause he makes a lot of money
So hustlers make crack sales cause they deprived and hungry
My country hates that I could run free state to state with hunnies
While making cake with real golded plate rims on Humvees
The bush stroker, the kush smoker, nigga
Just when you thought it was over look over your shoulders
I'm 30 now, baby sip drinks and sip 'em slow
Motto no stress, smoking less than I did befo'
You see the kid was broke 'til I spitted vivid expressions
Of hard living ghetto children, of a lesser God
Religion was fast women, expensive cars
Y'all witnessin over 10 years, the best of Nas"
Star Wars,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Large Professor]

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yo, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
For niggas up in they mom's crib listenin
To this unadulterated Nas shit wishin it was them
Instead of, me on this track on this beach with palm trees
Drinks with umbrellas straws telling it raw
Jungle of concrete killers and snakes I was amongst that
Bundles of crack through this funnel that's black
I want you to vision through my telescope see the hell I wrote
It's Reynolds when I Wrap it like a envelope package
And they was into dope back then
Numbers, pimpin and robbin, well they still robbin and pimpin
But it's small change compare to hip hoppin
And did I mention millions because of lip poppin
Trips expensive gift shoppin whip drivin
Benzes, Jeeps, see, them and they bitch got one
It's shockin you thinkin naw it's just rhymin
But all this time it's like organized crimin
For instance, there was a time when there was a line
Between streets and business, but now peep how it's mixed in
The beef is now sickenin, everybody got paper
Words of power, because of it the cops hate ya
The government watchin all of those who thuggin it
They wanna lock us up cause they kids are lovin it
Not knowin that most rappers are straight ass
The shots ring out, whenever we clash it's Star Wars
[Chorus]
We call it Star Wars
What happens when the shots ring out, Star Wars
We call it Star Wars

[Verse 2]
Caviar never, I rather the Cajun blacken
Catfish no snails simple nigga to please
Met a bad bitch dimples in her cheeks
She remembers Busy Bee battles when it was peace
Caught myself driftin in thought, cause now it's different I thought
Niggas was raised off the shit I record
Like I was brought up off that Planet Rock
Kurtis Blow, James Todd Smith, Shan and Scott LaRock in the jams
Why would they fuck with a don, Jehovah witness
Him and his co-defendants, I eat 'em like Lucky Charms
With two percent low fat milk, five percent pro black built
It's nothin mother had a motherfucker
I don't think about it niggas talkin there's a lot of gossip
That I'm a prophet or I can't go back to my projects
Can I? Does a plant grow from a pot? Yes
Do trees grow from a forest MC's y'all are clitoris
Y'all niggas roll with any click that's winnin any crew
Doin whatever's trendy, even they leave me too
Ain't enough room in this town
What is beef between ghetto word spitters with crowns, Star Wars
[Chorus]
Cause this is Star Wars, shots ring out everywhere, Star Wars
Cause this is Star Wars, shots ring out

[Verse 3]
This ain't, no Oscars or MTV or Joan Rivers fashion police
Not what you read in tabloid seats
These are MC's that live by the code, it's hard for me to spit it
Because the game was supposed to be sold, we live it
Came from the streets we the voice of the youth
America's nightmare was given a mic booth
Nike boots, leathers and jean, jewelry, cribs and cars
Rappers not dependin on your nine to five jobs
Entertainment, this is our world this is our language
Different regions speakin east and west gang shit
You got your positive shit like, Common Sense
But even he had drama with the Don Mega Cube
Acknowledge the words get twisted at times it's rules
What you think is different from the block whenever we feud
Fuck your pictures and your plaques your tours and autographs
Don't trust bitches and niggas who tell you your all of that
Cause, they'll be in your enemies face, sayin it's safe
To run in your release party sprayin the place
Or catch you when you least on point, putting your keys in the door
Behind you with your seeds in KB Toys store
Maybe the words get disrespectful now your niggas check you
You 'gon let that nigga play you, you know we 'gon rep you
Next mornin every news channel and front page
Headlines another rapper was slayed, this is Star Wars"
Nas Is Coming,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Dr. Dre]

Motherfucking Dre (Ahh), whassup my nigga?
Sup Nas?
Chilling, God
Niggas is up in here hittin' some of this chronic, nigga
Yeah and this chocolate over here, they mixed this shit up
Nigga, hit some of this shit, nigga
Yeah, lemme get that
I'm tired of these niggas, niggas stealin' beats
And niggas is stealin' your whole techniques and shit
Niggas wanna take everything from a nigga, man
Yeah, yeah, yo, Nas, it's like this, man
Niggas can't do it like I do it, d'yaknahmsayin'?
Just like niggas can't do what you do
Right, right
You know, can't nobody fuck with this
You know, all these niggas out here just
Talkin' this East coast/West coast bullshit
Niggas need to kill that shit
And make some money, y'know
Word
Fuck it
What is it, what is it, God?
Let's get together, make some fuckin' music
Right, that's what I'm sayin', that's what I'm sayin'
And get paid, and just, let that be it
Right, right
All these niggas talkin' all this bullshit
Better sit back, and watch what happens
[Verse 1: Nas]
The Golden Child chop that ass up, you was holding out
Let the streets be the court and corners hold the trial
Fatal, not fictitious
I rock the cable '86 shit
Foreign cars young with crazy bitches
Mad smoke makes me able to quote
Soliciting ill editions of that Murder I Wrote
A provocative plan can bring a knot to my hand
As the pyramids that stand on the top of the sand
In the heat of the moment
Like Farrakhan said, we need atonement
Bulletproof glass, S-classes
Chrome kitted up, calicones lit it up
I didn't get touched checking my nuts
I stood up and lit a Dutch
Clutching gats, quick to bust
But knowing how these niggas tattle
I sneak move, get the drop, one shot without the gun battle
So when you run, the lead travels
I come through, it's taboo
Ninety-six ways made to clap you

[Chorus]
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming (Nasty Nas is coming)
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming (Nasty Nas is coming)
Nas is coming
[Verse 2: Nas]
In the black limo, Jack Daniels through the cracked window
I spot the fake, red dot his face like a Hindu
Snatched the symbol, tied his hands to make examples
Substantial amounts you owe to the fam'
Crew, Firm affiliation, paper chasing
Chips glossy, rich Pablo Escabano
Sophisticado, blazing hollows like Saddles
Rap apostle, nacho cheese, I'm Castro
Compared to these niggas who swear to be real
But impostors to Hoffa, Nas plague kills
Counting bills to send to all my jail niggas who fell
From New York to LA, QB to CPT for GP
A hundred G cars, Garcia Vegas cigars
Kani shit, mad jiggy
The clout - murder material, serial scratched out
My name's passed out like it's something venereal
But back in stereo

[Chorus]
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming (Nasty Nas is coming)
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming (Nasty Nas is coming)
Nas is coming
[Verse 3: Nas]
From childbirth to hearses, flow like the Nile cover surface
I bit the fruit from the Serpent
Apocalyptic, get bent, stay splifted
Control the rap game? You got it twisted
Dr. Dre way, the 'Bridge say ""Shake dice and kiss it""
Sip Cris', push the six with biscuit
Jeep full of chickens, pull up beside, have a listen, y'all
Nas, y'all, fly gangsta, wavy hair, teeth chipped in
My shit bump, in the courtroom drunk
Links truck, rocky bracelet, cognac kernel, never chase it
Rap hero, black DeNiro
Federal Bureau tapped my line and got zero
Rap pro, diamond Role, hustling low
Pro-file white gold style, raking bloody dough by the pile
Shot down, still alive, he struggling for the phone, fo-fo blow him
When homicide comes, these three words are sung

[Chorus]
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming (Nasty Nas is coming)
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming (Nasty Nas is coming)
Nas is coming

Check this out, it's Nasty Nas and Dr. Dre
East meets West
That's how we making it happen
That's how it goes down for the nine-six
Ayo Nas, let's get this money, let's get paid
Sit back and watch all these motherfucking clowns out here
Riffing and beefing about this bullshit
Yo, while they doing all that
We just gon' kick back with these honeys
This Cristal and party to the year 2G

Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming (Nasty Nas is coming)

Ok then, chilling, chilling, minding my business (Word)
Yo Salt, I looked around and I couldn't believe this

The brother had it going on with something kinda uh
Wicked, wicked, had to kick it
I'm not shy so I asked for the digits
A ho, no that don't make me
See what I want slip slide to it swiftly
Felt it in my hips so I dipped back to my bag of tricks
Then I flipped for a tip, make me wanna do tricks for him
Lick him like a lollipop should be licked
Came to my senses and I chilled for a bit
Don't know how you do the voodoo that you do
So well it's a spell, hell, makes me wanna shoop shoop shoop

Like Prince said you're a sexy motha-
Well-a, I like 'em real wild, b-boy style by the mile

Million records sold nigga still selling cook up
Pusha, you know what the flow like
The hook-up, you know what that snow like
Got seven dwarves on the corner like I'm Snow White

Keep the heater on my waist for them cold nights
Protect my chain, chest lit like it's Lite Brite

A horse is a horse, of course of course
323 of 'em in that Porsche
Get a load of this, lifestyle of the rich
And I don't even race her, I baby that bitch

Cats ain't got a clue as to what real cash is

Who backyard look like it's a scene from The Masters
And what I know about a 9-iron
The only iron I know is the 9 I was firin'
Now everywhere I look it's me they admirin'
30 years in age, contemplating retirement
Could it be, the jewels or the drop
Crib so huge that I call it Camelot
Or could it be that 50 carat watch
Or me on the red carpet, cooling with Carrot Top
Trust me young'n, I will show you the meaning
In that Porsche 911, with the engine screaming
50 grand don't even feed my demons
My life like a fairytale, pinch me I'm dreaming

Uhh.. (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Q.B. since 1933 (No doubt)
To nine-six (Nine-six, motherfucker)
Check the shit

[Havoc]
Nine-six, Escobar 600

[Verse 1: Nas (Havoc)]
Check the shit
My mind's set, son got wet, I'm vexed really
They snatched off his Rolex, smacked his bitch silly
Why niggas actin' illy? Word to Will, he 'bout to feel it
I feel it, he shoulda been dealt with it
Them niggas sour, they put to much flour in they coke
And got the nerve to wonder WHY THEY BROKE
While we was gleamin', niggas was schemin'
Seen the ill Bimmers beamin'
Triple-beam and doublin' cream had 'em fiendin'
To get they fingers on the dosa, I called Sosa
""Sosa, these niggas hit the God, bring the toaster
Meet me in the 'Bridge, I'm bout to go loca""
Left my rat beggin' me to stay and stroke her
He came through with two fly bitches, Venus and Vicious
With two MACs inside the Volvo
What up, God? I'm still sober
I need some Henn' to bend me over
My nigga Hav' gotta soldier
It's gettin' down, it's goin' down, kid (I got this, I got this)
I heard he might not live, I'm holdin' back tears
Told these broads to put it in gear
With two females that don't smile, diggin' they style, yo
What up, son? These niggas done started somethin' wild
You know the clique well, Rhamel with the gold in his grill
Tried to get a name, holdin' the steel
I paid attention to the females
Maintained bitches when it get real
Sos' pulled me close and told me the deal
He said both hoes'll peel
Spray shots and reload and still handle the wheel
Point 'em out, smoke a Phil' then chill
I laid back, Escobar status
Knowin' The Firm got it cornered, we on it
Shit we was born with
[Chorus: Havoc]
Spark the lye, Q.B.C. yo, it's do or die
In this, business of trifeness
I finesse this, Boyardee, we chef shit
Perfect shit, Albert Einstein minds connect wit'

Lift you up, bless you with a shorty then we set you up
Spark the lye, Q.B.C. yo, it's do or die
In this, business of trifeness
We finesse this, Boyardee, we chef shit
Perfect shit, Albert Einstein minds connect wit'
Dangerous sons, step back, let the TEC lift
Lift you up, bless you with a shorty then we set you up

[Verse 2: Nas]
Hold it right there, pull over
That nigga right there inside the Rover
I knew he'd be right here, I told you
Let's get him now, look at him smile, ice Bulova
Polo pullover, big links and rockin' boulders
He's stuntin', after he left my man like that
Without a fair chance to fight back, but I'll be right back
He never seen us, Sos' gave the MAC to Venus
And Vicious, lookin' delicious, handle yo' business
And step to him, shake your ass, try to screw him
Do what ya gotta do to get to him
A tight Parasuco with young faces
Can turn niggas Buttafuoco of all ages
They was amused by the way they walked, way they talked
Only if they knew these girls had sprayed New York
If they had to, heard him ask Venus, ""Could I have you?""
He jumped out a Jeep, heard her tell him ""Don't grab, boo""
(What up, boo? What up? What up? What up?)
They started chattin', was only 'bout a minute, flat when
They jumped in the back of the Jeep laughin'
We followed him pollyin', he thought the hoes were Somalian
Probably when they hit the Holiday Inn
I grabbed the phone and called the Mobb and 'em
We laid low about a hour or so, these bitches movin' too slow
We both holdin', what if them wild hoes started foldin'?
Sosa said ""Say no more"", we started rollin'
Before we got in, they must have shot him
Security wildin', there the girls go, hurry up, we out in
The 940, me, Sosa and two shorties
The punk niggas got murdered in the orgy

Spark the lye, Q.B.C. yo, it's do or die

I'm trying to get up OUTTA here

Not that White Star!
[G1] Ha hah! Word, where the real niggas at?

[JoJo Hailey]
Listen.. to reason
Pretty baby, baby, listen

[Verse 1: Nas & (JoJo Hailey)]
A young, wild, beautiful love child
You like 'em thug style, link rocking, then mink copping
Hit you on the sink, a hundred dollar drink popping
The head'll make you take 'em shopping, a foul doctrine
Reminiscent of my first time up in a chick
You was innocent, but now you rent-a-dick, wear the tightest shit
Chanel, looking real, airbrushed nails
Hit the gym, hit the scales, heaven-sent but negligent (So fine..)
To see ya prophecy, your ebony tone is locking me
The way you moan make me daydream of you on top of me
Wishing I could be the one man
But you juggle way too many Willies all in one hand
You wanna run up in clubs, getting rubbed on
Niggas pull your hair, shake your fat rear, get your fuck on
Following week, you back there, but what you stuck on?
Weed, clowns and cars
Puffing with some lil nigga, husband not knowing she's out
Could you believe Eve, Mother Earth of the seas
Niggas thirst you, you just let 'em hurt you and leave
What up, ma? Fronting like you naive
Push your man's whip, calling police when you flip
Can't understand it, yo, it should be a throne for us
But for now, that's a whole different zone from us, word!
[Chorus: Nas & (JoJo Hailey)]
Diamonds all shining, looking all fine
Pretty little face, get a little high
Young girl struggling, trying to survive (Trying to survive)
Mother of the Earth, she made you and I
Just tired of playing the same ol' games
Messing with my mind, emotional thangs (Messing with my mind)
(And there goes.. a black girl.. lost)

[Verse 2: Nas & (JoJo Hailey)]
Like Isis, he got your heart broke and felt lifeless
Grow up, girl, instead, you want revenge so now you act the nicest
To who'sever getting down and trifless
To get his mind, all you do is give him something priceless
'Cause in time, he'll realize the thighs is all he needs
More than weed, then you hit him off with lies and greed
(Deceit, yeeeahhh)
There you go again, starting wars, making me more yours
Seem to get a kick out of keeping me on all fours
Face glistening, I'm addicted to you
Original, Wisdom Body got me picturing you
Igloos of ice tricking on you
You never listen to this nigga spending Franklins on tennis anklets
Must've had a bad deal in the past, though
Can't even keep it real with a nigga with cash flow
Say men are all the same, what we need to do is break this chain
You got a job part-time and school's your night thing
With dreams to settle down, it ain't far from now
You getting interviewed, but your boss is into getting screwed
Typical day that the black girl sees
Coming home wanting more from a college degree
[Chorus: Nas & (JoJo Hailey)]
Diamonds all shining, looking all fine
Pretty little face, get a little high
Young girl struggling, trying to survive (Trying to survive)

Messing with my mind, emotional thangs (Messing with my mind)

[Verse 3: Nas & (JoJo Hailey)]
Where are you focused? On legit niggas and where the coke is
Nice and Thug Life niggas, yo, you seem hopeless
Your value - too much to be measured, I wonder how you
Could ever be played, your pussy worth gold amounting to
More than the world, but not knowing nothing about you
You leaving the crib, taking all your kids out to
Drop 'em off, letting some nigga knock you off
So hot and soft, that's the same thing that got you lost
(You should be ashamed)
Growing up seeing it, it should remind you, you being lied to
Everything that move be inside you
Sacred as you are, left with these wannabes to guide you
I watched you, hard to knock you, I tried not to
They spot you out dancing topless in your drawers
Damn, look, there goes a black girl lost
[Outro: JoJo Hailey]
You should be ashamed of yourself
The way you carry yourself
The way you hang out all night long
Doing silly things that is wrong
Black girl lost"
Nasty Mind,D12,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
{​*girl giggling*}​ Stop!
You want me to do what? What are those?
You want me to stick those in your what?
{​*Bizarre laughing*}​

[Chorus: Bizarre (Truth Hurts)]
What is on your nasty mind? (nasty mind, nasty mind)
Don't you wanna get fucked from behind? (from behind, from behind)
Then treat me like a dirty slave (dirty slave, dirty slave)
And beat me like I won't behave - I just wanna get freaky, baby!

[Verse 1: Swift]
I'm too Swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
You don't know me, see I ain't gotta front or play the role
I'm a KNOW-G, I KNOW when you being phony
See, you probably boning them officers just to pull up on me
That's why sixty percent of women is lonely
They get in my mix only, then try to creep slowly because they nosy
I ain't listen to what, my momma told me
I fuck them and pass to my homies (right)
Then he fuck them and pass them to the homies (take her)
I'm a nasty-ass macaroni; you flashing fast money
You can pass a Roley, FUCK a alimony
If you want me, and ain't out screaming about your monthly
I'll be sticking your pretty ass until you turn ugly (damn!)
You suddenly see stars when fucking me
Ain't no menages, I want 'em in threes, release your garments (trick)
It ain't even me to hold back, I fucked your mom quick
Have her running around this bitch screaming ""That's my dick!""
[Verse 2: Kuniva]
Yo, I know I'm dogmatic, but your pussy walls done had it (that's right)
It's evident that you've been fucking like a jackrabbit
But I stay focused, so I acted like I didn't notice (mm-hmm)
And fucked her with no baby lotion and bust in the soapdish
Ho, you can quote this - your breath is smelling like
You done sucked a senior citizen's old dick in goat spit (god damn!)
You gon' get choked quick, talking all that ho shit
All aggressive asking for a slow kiss, no bitch! (the fuck outta here)
You like freaking, see you every night creeping
Sucking off the nice deacons, slut you made his wife leave him (cunt)
So keep slurping I'll be down to the fullest
But forget it bitch, your nipples look like AK bullets

[Chorus: Bizarre (Truth Hurts)]
What is on your nasty mind? (nasty mind, nasty mind)
Don't you wanna get fucked from behind? (from behind, from behind)
Then treat me like a dirty slave (dirty slave, dirty slave)
And beat me like I won't behave - I just wanna get freaky, baby!

[Verse 3: Kon Artis]
I'm tearing down whatever you built, your marriage is through
Cause I answered your wife's door naked wrapped in a quilt
Hoes say ""Kon Artis got a dick so big!""
Man, I can persuade any bitch to have eight of my kids, shit
Bitch, I should be locked up for having honeys' legs cocked up
In the back of my pops truck
I'm not fucked up, I just got a fetish for shooting
Cum in coochie till the pussy is pooting it back out
I 69'ed this one bitch and she bled in my mouth (shit)
Kicked her out, cleaned the couch out, and beat up my crouch
I don't gotta creep in hotels, I cheat at my house
See I'm a dog, I don't need to keep a secret hideout (nahh)
[Verse 4: Bizarre]
All night I've been snorting {​*sniffs*}​
Your age and where you from - it's just not important (nahh)
You look like one of my mistresses
On welfare, ten kids like the rest of my bitches
Dreams of fucking a handicapped bitch
Suck my dick while your teeth start to grit (whore)
And a slave, that's how I want you to treat me
I ain't into S&M, but I love when you beat me (ahhh!)
I told you I was a horny-ass freak
While I'm beating my meat, your daughter acting like she asleep (yeah right)
My love is like thunder and lightning
After it's over, I'm looking like I got my ass kicked by Tyson

[Chorus: Bizarre (Truth Hurts)]
What is on your nasty mind? (nasty mind, nasty mind)
Don't you wanna get fucked from behind? (from behind, from behind)
Then treat me like a dirty slave (dirty slave, dirty slave)
And beat me like I won't behave - I just wanna get freaky, baby!

[Outro: Bizarre]
I just wanna get freaky, baby!
I just wanna get freaky, baby!
I just wanna get freaky, baby!
I just wanna get freaky, baby!
Freaky baby, he he
I wanna get freaky with you

Silent Murder,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Live Squad, Lo Ground & Top General Sounds]

[Chorus]
{*whispered*}
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder

[Verse 1]
It's sort of like the conclusion to Color Purple
Niggas is losing, confusion, with one-time on pursuit moves in
Grabbing niggas up in this movement to rule shit
Cop versus the block, shorties is schooled quick
Lesson number one: If you're arrested and hung
Where niggas is from, gotta keep a lid on your tongue
It's like silent murder, I hit blunts hard like Ray Mercer
The violent words of a Prince in a Palace of Persia
The cognac plurger, plus the trees
But who's the foul one to make his nose take a freeze?
And got enough gall to rock ice in all hype
Used to be a general, but just lost his stripe
Pipe dreams and white fiends and all-nighters
Collect calls from lifers, Astoria wars with Cypress
Since I got a problem with the law-writers
I kick some more items just to explore horizons
The palm lady dreamt of this day
So I'mma play the crib close, smokin' with the big toast and lay
[Chorus]
{*whispered*}
Silent, silent murder

[Verse 2]
They say the arms of Nicky Barnes would be enough to blast
A lot of rich niggas fell and started pumping gas
Was it the mind of CIA that bumped off Malik Shabazz?
Fuck what they teach in class, I'mma reach the mass
Strap up, no back-up, it's jungle tactics
Living practice, out-of-line niggas get smacked backwards
So wear it if the cap fits, folded up money and mad clips
Are stacked right under my mattress
To smoke a nigga like a Hughes Brothers motion picture
Niggas getting open, crews roping older niggas
April fools, they laugh, the jokes on the benches
Seeds outside, my nigga spoke on his sentence

[Chorus]
{*whispered*}
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent
Silent, silent murder
[Verse 3]
My right-handers never play too close to cameras
It's night time, scandalous, circle the loud gamblers
Peace-making niggas pep talk
The Beast making niggas walk off the hot avenues with they brew
Time to get this loot countless
'Cause, son, it ain't no youth fountains
Niggas take cash and shoot, bounce and
Pakistanians are took hostage
Locked up inside a linen closet, known for spending pies up
What's the flavor when your neighbors do jake favors?
Locking real niggas down and letting fake players
Roam around the projects, it's lyrical logic
I dilute, then we can inject the right composite
When plotting on murderous schemes
It seems, I'm ghostly called by the essence of Queens
The palm lady dreamt of this day
So I'mma play the crib close, smokin' with the big toast and lay

[Chorus]
{*whispered*}
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
Silent, silent murder
[Outro]
And Cain killed his brother Abel
When God accepted Abel's offering and not his
Abel's offering showed that Cain was not giving his best to God
And Cain's jealous anger drove him to murder
Drove him to murder"

See no evil, fear no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil
If you don't bring that shit around you
You ain't got nothing to worry about (uh-huh)
Yeah (yeah, uh-huh)
Know what I'm saying?
Yo, yo yo yo

[Verse 1]
Carolyn from Maryland, she Lady Heroin
She elegant, her apparel in the M-Class caravan
Keys of dope, loving cats to ski in her throat
She fuck killers in her condo, her Benz and her boat
Her ice fro, ass is curvy, 40 years old
She passing for 30, Gucci framed glasses from Purvy's
Madison Ave., shopping when she not, copping bricks of that shit
She hopping on dicks, riding Pony's who trick
At my man's wake, she said the eulogy
After that I usually bumped into her shopping for jewellery
Her bodyguard screwing me, I gave her my math
Ain't nothing new to me, blowing backs out, six-pack Stout's
Wide fat mouth, the evil look with a bow-leg
Yo niggas said, ""Shorty's a pro, she blow heads
She push the fo' red, she know Feds, Feds know her""
A code red, maybe she's out to slay me, this bitch is crazy
She blew the celly up, meet me at the telly to fuck
She knew about cats from way back, we smoke the haystack
She never coughed once, blunts was her hobby
She said I knew her man probably, no doubt, '96 he tried to rob me
I jetted though, sometimes you never know
He snorted all her work, now she need me to do her dirty work
[Chorus]
It's a small world (""It's a.. small world.."")
Nigga you reap what you sow
What goes around comes around, if you sleep you don't know
A very small world (""It's a.. small world.."")
Where beef could never end
At the time you least expect it, I'ma see you again
It's a small world (""It's a.. small world..""), you get away with it now
Soon enough it catches up to you, someway, somehow
Yo it's a small world, watch what you do.. (""It's a.. small world.."")

[Verse 2]
Snook from Red Hook was grimy, did 5 years, glad to be home
From Attica, known for keeping chrome calibers
Smooth like a Wallaby shoe, he's out to get it
5 years planning to blow soon as he hit the bridicks
Had a girl in Woodside Queens, thought he was low
Played the crib for a month and deaded his P.O
Started robbing niggas ‘til he caught a whole kilo
He had a bunch of starving niggas he owe, he never paid though
Got large, sign on his door, ""Don't knock hard""
Laying with his bitch, 'niggas is rich' is what he told her
Played the block, holding cracks inside the baby stroller
Here come his crazy soldier, 6 shots it's over
A year went past, Snook went flossing fast
His old man had crossed his ass for the laws of this fast cash
[Chorus]
It's a small world (""It's a.. small world.."")
Nigga you reap what you sow
What goes around comes around, if you sleep you don't know
A very small world (""It's a.. small world.."")
Where beef could never end
At the time you least expect it, I'ma see you again
It's a small world (""It's a.. small world..""), you get away with it now
Soon enough it catches up to you, someway, somehow
Yo it's a small world, watch what you do.. (""It's a.. small world.."")

[Verse 3]
I seen death, seen thugs cry, it's bugged why
We let the slugs fly, enter your brain through your skull
Another thug died, pitching your soul into that infinite
Black hole where many souls go cause of a .44 blast
Snook was one of ‘em, so many more
Even that Fendi whore got niggas hit up, yeah let that Henny pour
Carolyn, paid-up bitch, made bitch, stay rich
Heard her bodyguard took Snook to God
Carolyn when she needed him, he took the job
He was close to her ever since she took him inside
When his moms died, dope fiend OD'd, '85
He went crazy, stuck up banks to stay alive
He was live, do niggas even know the things that he tried
Robbed armored trucks, incidents where police died
He stayed in lower Eastside, peace God, he stared at me hard
Two of his mans with him, I got to hit 'em
I'm reaching for my Roscoe, cocked it back on
And get my blast on, at the gas station, bunch of Arabs racing
Out the way as my Taurus spray
Jump in the whip, hit the highway
You know how I say, the game that I play
It's real tendencies, when you feel your enemies
But can't figure out whose who, keep it true
Shit is cool now -- put the tools down? Never
'Cause everyday is on, livin this life, out for this cheddar
[Chorus]
It's a small world (""It's a.. small world.."")
Nigga you reap what you sow
What goes around comes around, if you sleep you don't know

Hell yeah
Check it check it check, check check
Yo, when it come to sex advice, I'm the one to call
If you a virgin with blue balls or you tear down walls
Not Dr. Ruth, call me Dr. Knockboot
Pimped out hats, rock fashionable suits
A class for the youth, Sex Ed for your head
The do's and don'ts, that should happen in the bed
First, DON'T: run up in her raw cause you get burned
For sure, fuckin' with the typical whore, because
DO: rock a Rough Ryder, whenever you inside her
Your local bodega is your supplier
And DON'T: take the pussy, if she fightin'
Cause you saw what happened to 2Pac and Mike Tyson
'Specially if you large, some hoes is trife
Get you on a rape charge, have you servin' your life
Yo, DO: get a yes confirmation before penetration
You wind up in a police station
DON'T: get with no young bitch and hit it
She PG-13, you rated R, she not permitted
DO: check for ID, whenever chillin' V.I.P
With fly shorty P.Y.T
Yo, DON'T: lie about the cars you got
Or who you hang with, frontin' when you borrowed your watch
Yo, DO: play your game right, if the G's tight
Then you can fuck shorty the same night
Yo, DON'T: trick when you don't have to
You think you ballin'? You turn your back they laughin' at you
You don't gotta keep repeatin you a thug, she heard you
In fact, she attracted to your man that herbed you
DO: spend a lil' dough, only if you know
The bitch gross a lil' somethin' too bro
DON'T: eat the pussy the first night
Maker her bless you, we call that shit gesundheit
DO: set the mood right, Bailey's with ice
A cup of Thug Passion'll make everything right
Yo, DON'T: pop shit like you Daddy Longdick
When you come fast like Fed-Ex and bust too quick
DO: hit positions she will find interest in
DON'T: hit the pussy if that shit's blisterin'
Hope you're listenin', turn up your transisterin'
Hot 97, KISS-FM or B-L-S, with your hand up her dress
Chillin' with your girl while you thinkin' 'bout ya ex
Not too easy not too complex

Problems or questions, I can answer them best

What what, straight like that

[Verse 1: Nas]
You a killer or a hustler, dealer or customer
Gangsta or buster, youngster or old nigga
A weed head, a coke sniffer
You rich or a broke nigga
Know you all relate to this shit that I wrote niggas
Lots of my mans trapped up in a max
Penitentiary, sending me letters I answer back
That eventually, we all be Bentley'ed out
Throwing campaigns, fuck it I'm running for White House
My niggas control Senate, pipe seats, Jeeps tinted
Mad Lewinsky chicks, some kinky shit
Did dirt now I knew it would come back one day
So I'm on point, strapped, prepare for gunplay
Stared at one face, thought it was beef he looked familiar
Ready to blast, nigga gave me daps said I feel ya
Can't believe how my life changed
From the hood, the first time in my life
I can say I did the right thing

Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it
No matter what it takes my nigga, we gon' take it (uh)

You wanna joke nigga? Laugh when you get blown up (come on)
See how funny it is when your kids ain't got no father
Cause you played it sweet now you floating in the harbor (for real)
Shit is hectic so respect it for your health (what)
Didn't think it was right, you should've checked it yourself (come on)
Life is too short to get caught up in some dumb shit
Wake up one day, 40 years old on some bum shit
Time flew by, you was too fly to see the light
Everyday it's getting darker then comes the night
Now what? (what) Realize that you ain't got shit (uh)
Not long ago you was the man on some hot shit
So just peep the flow yo, 'cause you already in this
Make sure your shit is right kid and handle your business (uh huh)

Make history before you go
Fuck the misery, you living po' we gettin dough
Except the dollars other reasons why I'm living yo (why?)
Time is valuable
Low and behold the young, black, and powerful
Got to eat yo, everyday my daughter feet grow
You wack and cheap with the doe, my heat could blow
Paying doctors when I'm born, a preacher if I'm buried
That's why cash is needed for my kids to inherit
Gotta pay just for living, tax life is a bid'ness
If you catch a bad deal, watch your life diminish
Deals made by God and the Devil, and we in it
Pawns in the game, can't complain or say shit
Just strap up and hold on, hope for the best
Prepare for the worst, no fears no nothing on earth
No tears if I'm dumped in a hearse, I won't be the first
Nor the last, nigga, let's get this cash, nigga

The dope fiends is at
And killers crawl
And snitches call police
On these niggas, and street
Corners everybody's like
Smokin' marijuana and
Snuffin' niggas in faces and startin' drama and
Shootin' niggas, cold blood, just kill 'em, so what
With the fo' pound go nuts
Better slow up
Before you get your ass sewn up
Nigga never gon' grow up
Drinkin' the Henny
But he know he gon' throw up
Tryin' to make crack sales
What it look like? Future for a black male
Don't want to make my momma cry
On a front page for a homicide
Fly whips, all I wanted to drive
Where chicks get blunted and ride
Do 105 in the fast lane
And a fast pace, chasin' the papes
Spendin' chips on big chains
And the dimes that give brains
That was a 80's and 90's thing
Now I'm into big things

Nah, I ain't fuckin' with you
Now I'm into big things
Gotta get my life together man

Do I know where I'm goin' to?
Can I forget when I came from?

Another style I'ma flow for you
Can I make somethin' wild
I can throw for you, flow for you
Make it bi-coastal
Take it to heights
That some of y'all can't come close to?
Some of y'all
Want to talk like hoes
Worse than bitches
And when y'all niggas see me blow
Bet it hurt like stitches
No competition
I stop and twist 'em
Hit 'em like a mafia proposition
I rap and y'all stop and listen
Thinkin' back to when I had not pot to piss in
Look up at a nigga, now
Rocks that glisten
Can't stop my mission
Make another LP drop
I'm hittin' with the new shit, exclusive
No time to get caught up in a crime
I ain't have shit to do with
Used to chase the hoes
Now I chase the dough
Is y'all bitches gonna help me get paper?
No!

Chuck and gunnin' for dough

It was me that introduced you to wealth
Crossin' me is like shootin' yourself
Wanna blow so fast, now do it yourself
You ain't shit now
You was so ill, why you never came out?
Where ya clique now?
Where you sit now? In the back seat
Mad 'cause I flip styles and I pack heat
Make you run laps like a pro athlete
And I done that
From my experiences
I appear relentless
Take more time
Just to hear my sentence
I'ma tell you what's real
And what could stop you from makin a mil'
You could prevent this
When niggas don't see eye to eye to you
Lie to you
Wanna get high with you
Want to eat food off of your labor
And take food off your table
'Cause they don't see your vision
Don't understand your mission
Is to make history
While you here
How long you plan on livin'?
Not forever
At least to 140
Pray for me, I'm tryin' to eat
Like the niggas who bought
Motown off Berry Gordy
Good God

Nigga I'm tired of games
I'm into big things
Gotta get my life together man
'Cause now I'm into big things
Tired of talkin' small talk
'Cause now I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things
Man we already did that
Now I'm into big things
No time to get sidetracked
Now I'm into big things
Get money now besides that
Some more big things
I'm into big things

Strange
Real strange, real strange
An overdose, a nickel bag of funk
Now move on, move on yeah
Hey man, are you ready to go?

[Verse 1: Butterfly]
Boogie jive and rap is life where I'm from
Where I'm from, Ahmed play with Izzy where I'm from
Where I'm from, it be like run your coat black
Jupiter, keeps her fat beats by the pack
Where I'm from, nappy hair is life
We be reading Marx where I'm from
The kids be rocking Clarks where I'm from
You turn around your cap, you talk over a beat
And dig some sounds booming out a jeep
Where I'm from, cocoons hide the youth, swoon units hundred proof
You want some beef, they will cut you some where I'm from
The beats is infinite where I'm from
Voodoo, ashubani, gangsta lean where I'm from
I'm interplanetary, my insect movements vary
It's kinky if it's hair, G where I'm from
The fire hoses blow
It's purple when it snow
I do a hit and go, split
It's hip, what's hip
When hip is just the norm
'Cause Planets pledge allegiance to the funk in all its forms
The kinks, the dance, the prints in all the shirts
My grandmother told my Mama that it's Africa at work
On vibes, we freak, them universal beats
You find it at the spot you hit at ends of every week
We twist, exist, to spin the maddest hits
Up here funk is our neighbour so we paid her a visit
The lip we sip can't house the nine zips
For rock we can't do nothing, for this we come equipped
Off disc, off tape, rap blasting til from eight
The really truly fat the fly on the flip
Cocoa gotta know, how Planets gotta roll
Speak the mega cool, get funky as a goal
It's calm, relax, we're only some new jacks
That acts from the funk but don't play the role
Where you from
[Verse 2: Doodlebug, Ladybug, & Butterfly]
Weekend Dig Plans got T's where I'm from
Where I'm from, it's Clarence 13 where I'm from
Where I'm from, brothers took the beats and got fly
(Why?) That's most asked by 85, where I'm from
Faking the funk you get did
Projects, tenements, pyramids where I'm from
We living off the boom boom crack
It's that hip-hop rockers, jazz when I max
Peace be the greeting of the insect tribe
Pestilent forces can't catch the vibe
We live to love and we love to rock mics
We speak in ghetto tongue 'cause ghetto's the life
Food for thought so get a buffet plate
The lyrics are so fat you might gain weight
So just watch me step alone, into the sunset
Left foot right foot 1-2 mic check
Brewing funk inside my soul kitchen
So pull up a chair, here's a bib, have a listen
Of hardhead intervene, damn I know you're fluent
Yeah, 'cause Doodle ain't having it and Butterfly knew it
Where you from

[Verse 3: Ladybug]
Venus acts a fool at the square right? Yeah
Doctors engineer in a pair right? Yeah
Hip-hop made a point last year right? Yeah
But Planets is the joint this year right? Yeah
Planets got the dubs and live to grass-hop
Duck out from the fuzz, that sweat the hip-hop
Rising like we foam, get it from the dome
I'm from where the fat beats stretch for mad blocks
We can get a kit, without no thread
Feeling funky beats go straight to the head
Fall into a club, dig on what we love
It be past six before we reach bed
Butter freaks on relics we say those are fat
Doodle, Mecc, and Silk, the quad where it's at
We need to stack a sack, for rap to take us dap
So we treat our clips, just like busting caps
Rip it till dawn, kick it till dawn
Hip-Hop is the fix or else we be gone
People thought they canned it
Rap is not by bandits
Digable Planets got it going on
[Outro]
Everywhere, every everywhere, everywhere
Everywhere, every everywhere, yeah
Everywhere, every everywhere, yeah
Everywhere, every everywhere, yeah
Everywhere, every everywhere, yeah
Everywhere, every everywhere, everywhere
Everywhere, every everywhere, yeah

Put It In Your Mouth,Akinyele,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Kia Jeffries]
My baby left me
Left me sad and blue
I didn't know what to do...
Without my baby baby baby baby
And then I met his best friend
And he took me to his house
And I said... I said...

Here let me tell you what I said

You wanna go down, why not?
I be like Herbie and Hand-you-a-Cock
And tell you that my name is Ak'
Get on your knees, make like the breeze begin to blow
But don't give me no Ralph Lauren grin if you're not down to go low deep in my mouth
I'm all about mouth-fuckin'
Only if you down for dick suckin'
If not, B.J. and the Bear...keep truckin'
And fuck chapsticks
I'm comin' ashy as hell, wit chapped dicks
For your chapped ass lips down in my mouth
Creamin you'r teeth like dentists as I'm rubbin' them
With an erection like injections, fuck it I be druggin' them
Numbing up your tonsils, like Anbesol anesthetic
Cummin' down your throat like chloraseptic take it out my mouth
No time for apologin.. girlfriend if you..
Swallowin', garglin'
I'm givin' bitches permanent beards
Put your lips here and catch these damn facial hairs
In your mouth

Put it in my mouth
Put it in your mouth
I said my motherfuckin' mouth

You can eat me out

[Verse 2: Kia Jeffries]
Well, you can lick it, you can sip it, you can taste it
I'm talkin' every drip-drop, don't you waste it
Baby, slurp it up, it's enough to fill your cup
It's finger-lickin' good, and I wish a nigga would
Go down kinda slow or even fast
I'm always sprung once I feel your tongue in the crack of my ass
Yes, I need a nigga goin' out like that
Boy, I'm packin' such a tasty treat
And you can eat me out

But put it in your mouth

The kind that you meet in a bar?
You think you can get whatever you want cause you some kind of star""
No, I'm a comet; I just want you woman
Hey, if I were you then it would be me that I'd go home with
Three, the one and only, one thing you ain't considered
I heard you when you told your girl, ""Ooh, he can get it"" - admit it
You did it! Let's hop a cab, and split it
I'm kiddin! We both goin' to where you livin'!
Eh-HAH!! I got you giggling like a piglet - oh, that's the ticket?
I hope you more like, Anita Baker, than Robin Givens

Nigga Couldn’t Know,Big Tymers,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
This is where them niggas die fast, sell bricks and buy bags
They dodge class to hit the block and go find cash
If you try to pass, take my advice: drive fast
Cause, my man, ain't no escaping when shots blast
You wonder why the cops keep circling, niggas murdering
I ain't never saw 'em before, tonight we twurkin' 'em
Niggas wearin' masks like glasses
Niggas got on tank tops and a pair of Reebok classics
Pants to my knees cause the Glock make it slouch
I can't talk right now, I got three rocks in my mouth
And, woadie, when we enter niggas freeze up like it's winter
And if a nigga whisper, pistols eat him up for dinner
Seventeen representer, you don't like it, do somethin'
And I'll bet you'll see a nigga outside 'bout two-somethin'
And we like to dress in all black up in my residence
Ain't got on no suits cause we ain't tryin' to be presidents

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Birdman]
Nigga, we done moved more coke, than a nigga could know
More money, more cars, than a nigga could show
And more ice cheap price, than a nigga could score
And hit blocks with Glocks, make 'em get on the floor
Nigga, we done moved more coke, than a nigga could know
More money, more cars, than a nigga could show
And more ice cheap price, than a nigga could score

Nigga waking up to alley cats and rats
Project bitches that tote gats
Niggas kicking the dope, but the crack done smack back
Lil' niggas runnin' through the hallways
While other niggas playin' ball made a court in the driveway
Things ain't the same where I use to play
It's guns and broads
New cars, neighborhood superstars, and hoes smoking cigars
Lil' ones sitting on the car
Watchin' the bus hollering, ""Them people comin'!"" When that blue car pull up
I'm tired of catchin' cuts, and bendin' corners
I got that work got youngsters on all four corners
You got the quarters, and you got them halves
I got the quarter ki's, and Fresh got the slabs
Ten a ki is the price if you want a brick
And if you don't know that, nigga, tax the bitch

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Birdman]
Nigga, we done moved more coke, than a nigga could know
More money, more cars, than a nigga could show
And more ice cheap price, than a nigga could score
And hit blocks with Glocks, make 'em get on the floor

It's the return of the click-clackin' downtown pistol packin'
Y'all remember me from back in
The '89 era when killers use to wear mascara
And run through the court causin' terror
Random riot gunshots, government-issued Glocks
That's bakin' soda added with that odor now you got clatch pots
Niggas went from [?] to frozen cups
To catchin' cuts, to big ol' nuts
Shorty, I been on missions
Jackin' niggas for Balley competitions
Stickin' guns in bustas' backs
Everybody, come out your Polos and your Zodiacs
But that was back in the days
See, niggas done changed they ways
Went from snug-nose-38's to hand grenades
Now it's a must that niggas bust back when they get cussed at
Or fussed at
Nine-millimeters, Glocks, pumps, riot guns, niggas can trust that

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Birdman]
Nigga, we done moved more coke, than a nigga could know
More money, more cars, than a nigga could show
And more ice cheap price, than a nigga could score
And hit blocks with Glocks, make 'em get on the floor
Nigga, we done moved more coke, than a nigga could know
More money, more cars, than a nigga could show
And more ice cheap price, than a nigga could score
And hit blocks with Glocks, make 'em get on the floor
Nigga, we done moved more coke, than a nigga could know
More money, more cars, than a nigga could show

Y'all got to understand
We got this shit on lock, woadie
If you ain't makin' money you ain't doin' what you suppose to
I understand niggas kickin' in doors for 20-inch momo's
Whatever it take, lil' daddy
And it don't matter
If I get caught up in a struggle, I got to take mines
If you get caught up, you better believe it
That that iron gon' get your mind right, dog

Smoking kush nuggets the size of fucking tarantulas

And that nigga Short tell that nigga Jasper swag me up
Swag me up, swag is us, who can tell me how the fuck
Our number one fans is faggots that used to laugh at us
Tell me who's as rad as us and the answer was
""Um, y'all dope, Wolf Gang just the damper dust""
Yeah the dapper dogs take your head chop it off
No father, fuck being proper bitch, we're popping off
And to top it off I'm dropping monster monologues
That's hot enough to piss your local arson off
That's me spitting this fucking garbage toss
As you niggas, niggas get familiar with the art of loss
Switch swag on you little dick fags
You fucking dead bitch chips, I'm on my fifth bag with your bitch ass

People love Hodgy I hate you though
I don't precipitate bitch, I H2O

Thoughts, cause you're an outsider tryna get in brain
I like girls but I don't fuck with tramps
I'm elephant tusking and they succulents
I'm shaving off my boot hairs deciduosly
Break jaws Mr. Vigora, rigorously
I'm hot breeze, snot sneeze
I cop weed for less of a percentage than I fucking plot seeds
New racist, too vacant, mutations, natural selection
Bitch I got my swag card, natural protection
Pocket with a cash full of bashful weapons
I brandish and I flash tools and I have fools stepping
I'm a geophyte, move under the ground til I can see the light
Feed niggas shells like my motherfucking beach is nice

When I say ""Wolf Gang"", you say ""Fuck that""
Room full of wolves, inhalers and used blunt wraps
Fingers in the middle of bitches bodacious buttcracks
Enough fucking atheist rappers to get a nun slapped
This is fuck music here, let a couple sluts use it
Show their boobs, and I'll hop out the booth when I'm done pooping
Grab a couple (gats), stuff 'em in the backpack
Then take them to school for show and tell day screaming ""Fuck students""
Backing up a bunch of fatherless kids and a pack of dust
Could fucking splat and show you the fucking Iraq in us
A bunch of fucking wolves and rats having niggers the size of Shaq
Backing up, like juvenile biggest fan was a moving truck
Killing these niggas off quick
Don't believe me? Then watch me empty out a full clip
Trigger being pulled, niggers in a ditch
That wasn't bullets, that was copies of Bastard, you bitch

To His Coy Mistress,Andrew Marvell,[],"Had we but world enough, and time,
This coyness, lady, were no crime.
We would sit down and think which way
To walk, and pass our long love's day;
Thou by the Indian Ganges' side
Shouldst rubies find; I by the tide
Of Humber would complain. I would
Love you ten years before the Flood;
And you should, if you please, refuse
Till the conversion of the Jews.
My vegetable love should grow
Vaster than empires, and more slow.
An hundred years should go to praise
Thine eyes, and on thy forehead gaze;
Two hundred to adore each breast,
But thirty thousand to the rest;
An age at least to every part,
And the last age should show your heart.
For, lady, you deserve this state,
Nor would I love at lower rate.
But at my back I always hear
Time's wingèd chariot hurrying near;
And yonder all before us lie
Deserts of vast eternity.
Thy beauty shall no more be found,
Nor, in thy marble vault, shall sound
My echoing song; then worms shall try
That long preserv'd virginity,
And your quaint honour turn to dust,
And into ashes all my lust.
The grave's a fine and private place,
But none, I think, do there embrace.

Now therefore, while the youthful hue
Sits on thy skin like morning dew,
And while thy willing soul transpires
At every pore with instant fires,
Now let us sport us while we may;
And now, like am'rous birds of prey,
Rather at once our time devour
Than languish in his slow-chapp'd power.
Let us roll all our strength, and all
Our sweetness, up into one ball;
And tear our pleasures with rough strife
Thorough the iron gates of life.
Thus, though we cannot make our sun
Stand still, yet we will make him run."

All up on each other winding real freaky
I'm plottin on how I'm gon take 'em home with me
Maybe her cousin, maybe her girlfriend
I just wanna get them both up out of here
Fast as I can on them dubs to the crib
Start off with my game and pop a lil bub
And have 'em dance for me like they danced in the club
Oooh they so freaky and both of them on me
Shots of Tequila puffin dro and now they ready
Her girl hollered out with her best friends
And then I hollered out ""y'all look like twins""
Ain't no competition, y'all a couple of tens

All up in my tub, steady poppin bub
Who is she to you when she reply first cuz
Man I can tell they so naughty, naughty
The way they took me down like a forty, forty
One in the bed and one in the chair
One might suck my toes while one braid my hair
In the prop spot like two fo these players
In the car lot like two of these players
Haters say ""damn, how he doin this player?""

Double Up

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
I'm back up in the VIP, in a cloud of smoke
Be poundin', surrounded by all my folks
Give me another shot, damn the music loud
I'm bout to mix it up and blend in in the crowd
Whip, slip, slide by the dance floor
Baby grab me by the hand say she wanna dance, oh oh
Is that your girlfriend peepin' me out?
Sho' nuff, it must be cause now she freakin' me out
She get behind a nigga, grindin' on a nigga, touchin' on me
Whisperin' in my ear, damn it sound lovely
I'm infatuated, we evacuated, now we at the crib
It's two for the money, that's the life I live
Kiss me, kiss her, now kiss each other
It's a trip the way I make these chicks twist each other
Take your shirt off, now I'ma take hers off too
It's double or nothin', baby, that's how the boss do
[Chorus: R. Kelly (Snoop Dogg)]
Step up out the club with a dizzy head
I got two chick that got dizzy legs
I'm 'bout to double up (one on each arm)
You know I'm 'bout to double up (I keep one on each arm)
Hop up in that Phantom with the doors suicide
I got a freak in the front and a freak in the back
I'm 'bout to double up (one on each arm)
And you know I'm 'bout to double up (I keep one on each arm)
Double Up

[Outro: Snoop Dogg (R. Kelly)]
How bout that?
Snoop Dogg and Kells (Chi-tizzle)
We lead the league in this here man (Believe that)
You know what I'm talking about? (Yeah, hell yeah)
That's forty toes man, add that up, forty toes
That's like twenty points and twenty rebounds
That's a double double (you a fool)

Now, I've never been one to knock the next man for gettin' his
You know what I'm sayin'? (Right, right)
And I do realize that Hip Hop is now a form of showbiz (Uh huh)
But this has always been somethin' with which you have to be true
So in the year of 1992... (Now, this is how we do!)

[Verse 1: Large Professor & Neek The Exotic]
At the age of 19, heard the scene
A lot of MC's that do not come clean
Frontin' on dealin' hard times in rhymes
You see 'em in the streets and you see no signs
Of the hell, and they get on stage and tell
Some old cornball war story, ring the bell! (Word!)
You're fakin' the funk
Talkin' that extra hard junk, you're probably a punk
And I'mmma let you know
That this way, you just don't cut with the artificial flow
Neek the Exotic breaks backs and necks
When fakes try to front, they get smoked like blunts
My rhymes penetrate like skunk
Aiyo, word up, I think they're fakin' the funk
You're fakin' the funk! (You're fakin' the funk!)
[Hook x6]
Yo! You're fakin' the funk! (You're fakin' the funk!)

[Verse 2: Large Professor & Neek The Exotic]
You do a song about a current event
Get on television and seem hesitant to represent
And that's what we call (Fraud!)
You can't kick the streets with a ""Look, I sold out"" award (Word!)
And everywhere has streets
That's not tryin' to hear the same wack rhymes
Over the same stink beats
'Cause times are real and I can't feel
Puttin'... down on the reel to reel
Now, I'mma let you know
With those weak style of raps, it's time to go
I eject rejects that step
I'm a vet' ready to snap your neck
I shine and rise at the same time
The mastermind of the sport called the rhyme
Now it's my time to dump chumps that front
(Aiyo, Professor, what's up?)
You're fakin' the funk! (You're fakin' the funk!)

[Hook x6]
Yo! You're fakin' the funk! (You're fakin' the funk!)
[Verse 3: Large Professor & Neek The Exotic]
The era of the wack MC, is gettin' shut down
When the Main Source stomps through your town
'Cause we just don't play the role of a clown
And keep things jumpin' with the real, rap, sound
So, to all the people stealin' beats (You're fakin' the funk)
To the crossover rapper with the pleats (You're fakin' the funk)
To all the chumps that's claimin' the streets (You're fakin' the funk)
Frontin' incredible feats (You're fakin' the funk)
To the girl actin' like a prostitute (You're fakin' the funk)
Wearin' that hooker type suit (You're fakin' the funk)
To the rapper with the big space suit (You're fakin' the funk)
To the artist that doesn't pay dues (You're fakin' the funk)
'Cause, Exotic and then you're torn with the hyper tone
I can't be blown because my rhymes are hard like stone
So, prepare for the scare 'cause I'm you're worst nightmare, punk
'Cause you're, 'cause you're...

My first mission runnin' through the head to smoke jack
With memories poppin' in my head recall that
Late night creepin' through the alley with six deuce
Strapped up everybody focused no mixed views
A sawed off pumped in my hand with two shells
The other four holmies on the scene with cocktails
One nigga lookin' for popos and foes hell
Someone lookin' through windows the door bells
Goes off followed by the punk you gas bomb
Adrenaline pumped up still I remain calm
House lit up you could see it for eight blocks
Runnin' through the hood run in front of the fade cops
The game chase but they couldn't cover the streets up
Rolled out ran into the spot to meet up
Strapped down covered up the tracks and back home
Laid low earned me a stripe perfect no

Slugs fly thugs die moment ya fell down

No thoughts barkin' just hearin' the hellhounds
Burn you with the heaters spittin' out twelve rounds

Runaway,Devlin,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Devlin]
Listen, yeah
A lifetime of dreaming, visualising paradise
I woke up, rolled over and told my girl we’re leaving
It’s time to sacrifice a lot
Cause you ain’t happy with your job
And round here it’s like nothin’ seems appealing
So let me know you feel the same
Throw your life into a case and we'll depart from Victoria this evening
And then embark upon a path of rediscovery
Searching for the fruits from the lost garden of Eden
I’m wondering if I runaway and came back another day
Then would the young men who roll with metal put the guns away
And would the devil have took charge or would the slum be safe
I pray the latter’s right for everybody’s mumsy’s sake
And if I dissappear for years and reappear
Would my natural intuition still be crystal clear?
Or would I have lost clarity?
In this trivial pursuit we’re walking through so casually

[Hook: Yasmin]
I gotta leave, I gotta go
There’s nothing here for me no more
I gotta be free, I gotta be
Somewhere that I can just be me
And I run run runaway, run run runaway
Run run runaway, I runaway
[Devlin Verse 2]
We share a last cigerette, then walk into the station
Purchase two tickets to an alien destination
Board the train and witness pain on all the faces of multi-cultural races
But not me and my girl we’re breaking free
Like an escapist, cause we need to escape this
And I for one have got my mind made up
Even if where we stay is make-shift
I can’t remain in this domain of semi-ape shit, because all I see is hatred
I wonder if I dissappeared how many men would miss me
Or would they all forget like I erased my name from history?
I’m still trying yet to make a break within the chain of pain and misery
And vanish off the planet like a mystery
And if I did return and things were the same or worse?
You'd see the gear stick shift and then the whip reverse and I’d be straight back on my travels
Burning rubber over gravel ’til we see the English Channel

[Hook: Yasmin]
I gotta leave, I gotta go
There’s nothing here for me no more
I gotta be free, I gotta be
Somewhere that I can just be me
And I run run runaway, run run runaway
Run run runaway, I runaway

[Verse 3: Devlin]
As the carriage pulls away, I pull my lady closer and I tell her she’s okay
‘Cause if we never broke the barricades today we’d always be afraid
And left to feel threatened in this dark and deadly maze
But now I’ve come of age, and as the train starts enterin’ suburbia a smile comes across my face
The unwinding of eternal rage, that was locked up inside just like my mates behind prison gates
If I could runaway and come back another day
I’d let the song play, on the summer’s longest day
Kick back and just enjoy the raves, with a lager and a spliff to blaze
If I ever contemplate returning to this crazy place
I’d leave it long enough so they don’t recognise my face
I’d let the song play, on the summer’s longest day
While I roll upon the roads along the motorway
[Hook: Yasmin]
I gotta leave, I gotta go
There’s nothing here for me no more
I gotta be free, I gotta be
Somewhere that I can just be me
And I run run runaway, run run runaway
Run run runaway, I runaway"

I will be gone before you wake

Carry on whinging and whining
And get left to regret what you said
I'll be out the door in a sec
Like Usain Bolt, I'm quicker than lightning
I'm tired of rowing
And hours on end of bickering, fighting
I blame my surroundings
A relationship defined in violence
It blossomed, and it bloomed
Now it's rotten and all blue
And even though I still love you
I can't go through with the doom and gloom again

Even though I love you to bits
I'm done with the pain that we both inflict
Upon one another
It don't make me happy to watch you suffer
Run back to your mother
And tell her I turned out the same as the others
I don't know how to handle ya
All you do is make me angrier
Till I wanna manhandle ya
I'm contemplating whether to kiss ya or strangle ya
But I can't put my hands on ya
Like a burning flame in the burning flames
In hell with a dibs I'm walkin away
I can no longer stand with ya

You sold your soul with lies you told
And now it's time to ride alone
The lights will guide me home

Now I'll be gone before you wake
Cos I just can't ignore my fate
Forget the day you saw my face

In the blink of an eye

With the stars in the sky

And you're askin me why

[Verse: MF DOOM]
Scared of a bunch of water? Then get out the rain
Order a rapper for lunch and spit out the chain
Then kick a lungie off the tip of his Timbo
And trick a honey dip into a game of strip limbo
Odd, he couldn't find no remorse
A wink is as good as a nod to a blind horse
Of course his technique was from a divine source
Never knew the price of ice or what swine cost
One guy tried to bite the heat
That's when he discovered the other other white meat
Ohh! The one they hate so well
He sure keeps it psycho like the old Bates Motel
They came to ask him for at least some new tracks
But only got confronted by the beast with two backs
Knock. Mouse is a made man
Villain laid it down like the best laid plan
Bell the cat, who the hell is that near the middle?
Got y'all but it's not all beer and Skittles
Prepare the vittles, got riddles and spittles
Crystal clear to the jot, or the tittle
Sssst! It's hot off the griddle
Came to take the cake whether it's a lot, or a little
Kaboom; DOOM is nervous large
You could tell by his blooming room service charge
Dark and tall to boot
The only thing was wrong was he was bald as a coot
Used to rent a van from Peter Pan, the red and tan
And keep the human foot for his dead man's hand
This was when the mask was brand spanking new
Before it got rusted, from dranking all the brew
Stanking too, pew
Kept all his earnings in the bank and his shoe
Spat what he knew, energy for true
To all fake rappers, twenty-three skidoo
Excuse you, any room in the class front?
For a blast of the blunt, shrooming since last month
DOOM a human in the Mask, born to stunt
Danger zooming past mad fast on the hunt
Keep your streets, we got the city neatly conquered
Discretely with the CD till they be completely bonkered
The fans demanded it, handled it, swallow it
His own brand of shit, if only he could bottle it
Hmm, nah, shit could get messy
The feds tried to torture him for the secret recipe
He said it's no use, I only know half
No speaka de english, I only do the math
BZZT! Felt no pain
His brain was saturated with cocaine and Rogaine
He said, ""Try scam, no-thing, three-card, dead
Fly man go for bling, he got bled
I jam over sting, see spots red
I am 'Sofa King, We Todd Ed'""
[Outro: Aqua Teen Hunger Force & Carl & BillyWitchDoctor.com]

Confirmation of your worst fears
Ever since his first years, had a thirst for beers
Back from the future, it'll make you more sober-er

Catch 'em up at Bob's show, stall him with a troubled caller
Bastard, who could make G's faster
Than a newly remastered while being truly plastered
There's four sides to every story
If these walls could talk, they'd probably still ignore me
Contemplate war over a cup of warm coffee
It's really getting gory, tell your problem to Maury
Don't bore V with the ""glory, hallelu-ey""

I knew he had new G, who he? Viktor Vaughn
He had a new sicker song, I think he call it ""Lickupon""
Umm, but, uh—he study rhymes and patter-ins
Climb so steep sometimes the beat don't be matterin'
Sounded like a half-dead from Scurvy band rock
A programmed, computer bio-grafted Herbie Hancock
Maybe next life he'll try harder
Died a martyr at the hands of the fire-starter
More scripts ripped available for via barter
Transport a stack to the lab via charter
On the microphone he came to daze and amaze ya'
What a guy, practice bangin' flies with razors
And watch out for the robot, he got eyes with lasers
Tell 'em when they come with more topics besides blazers
Enough with the guns already, they all toys and lames
The joy's in the aim, he asked him, how's ya' poison game?
Do you bust your crossbow? Also, more so
Accurate body blows to torso, thought so
These flows you won't find in no ""how-to""
If the blacksmith doubt you, he smack the shit out you
Make nuttin' gone, let nuttin' twitch
Just don't be near the mic when the on-button switch
V bring the beef like a trucker to Fuddrucker
Delivery to all y'all motherfuckers and bloodsucker
Coppin' more pleas than when a rap nigga bicker on
And that's my word is bond, I think he call it ""Lickupon""
Umm, he wrote this one with a fever, sick in bed
With his dickhead inside a chickenhead
No, a dead chicken's head, he said it help his nausea
If he lost ya', wait till he tell you about the flyin' saucer
Dag, the kickback'll leave your wig ragged
For a big bag of good grizzle and some Zig-Zag
Survival, keep a rival in denial
And bust what he got just for comin' out his pie-hole
Die calmer than a suicide-bomber
V just the type to do a hoo-ride with Momma
Said to James Bond, my name is Viktor, Viktor Vaughn
Told the chick the quickest way to get on, lickupon"

When niggas get wrapped up in image and actin'
Niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic
Zipped up in bags—when it happens, that's it
I've seen 'em come, I've watched 'em go
Watched 'em rise, witnessed it, and watched 'em blow
Watched 'em all blossom and watched 'em grow
Watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough

You'd probably move to a new house on a new hill
And choose a new spot, if niggas wanted you shot

I ain't no bitch, neither
It's either my life or your life and I ain't leavin', I like breathin'

Brutalize a sound check, ripple through the intermission
Rap's under siege, held tight like a squeeze
Forced in the world 'Donna nuclear freeze
Do the damage to the wannabe Flip Mode and Def Squad
Ruckus a whirlpool in the rap entourage
If you dare to test thirty-six, chambers of strangers
Not word of mouth, or song, real wigs might peel
Livin large and in charge branch out Bon Voyage
Twenty-four diamond government named God
Alias Daryl Hill bring thugs back to kill
Circle around my son, Daryl Jr. never eatin lard
Auntie Dauntie sixteen holdin me down
AIDS of rap music may be contagious to sound
Verbal the slang pushed back to create pronoun
Method forcin J-Love to Bring the Pain from underground
Realizin food for thought is self-compromising
Shaolin cut the crack into a triple-O sizin
Blue do what he do to keep that currency risin
Hopin I catch a deal so we can catch a four-wheel
Instead of catchin bodies, niggas not keepin it real
I dirt bomb niggas that steal cake from stores
That's my type of niggas I be wanting on my tours
Can't help it, my styles stay fat like Roseanne
Ruckus in the square I stay rough like the Clan
Panther on my arm, pen and pad in my hand
Punk motherfuckers better beware of the Shaolin
Defy interactive project Children of the Corn
Gats on my man keep em bustin till ya gone
Style so ancient it sparks just like the unicorn
Donna come through everyday my uniform
Changes and switches, I came to make ladies out of bitches
Crackhead niggas get stitches
So what up with that kid, danger when I attack, kid
Watch how the slang hits you just like a bat, kid
Form another pyramid, look how we slid
All over Park Hill, Stapleton politic
On a twenty dollar bill all in it together
You can't fuck with the stormy weather, yaknahmean?
[Hook: Ghostface Killah]
To the year Born God all the Gods strike hard
Fast from the swine hold down your boulevard

My Mom,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay!
Alright, a'ight, a'ight, a'ight, a'ight (Yo, yo)
Yo, yo
Alright, I'ma lay the chorus first
Here we go now!

[Chorus]
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom!

[Verse 1]
My mom, my mom, I know you're probably tired
Of hearin' 'bout my mom, oh-ho, whoa-ho
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty
And how I became hooked on Va-aliu-um
Valium was in everything, food that I ate
The water that I drank, fuckin' peas in my plate
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
So every day I'd have at least three stomachaches
Now tell me, what kind of mother would want to see her
Son grow up to be an undera-fuckin'-chiever?
My teacher didn't think I was gonna be nothin' either
""What the fuck you stickin' gum up under the fuckin' seat for?""
""Mrs. Mathers, your son has been huffin' ether
Either that or the motherfucker's been puffin' reefer""
But all this huffin' and puffin' wasn't what it was either
It was neither, I was buzzin' but it wasn't what she thought
Pee in a teacup? Bitch, you ain't my keeper, I'm sleepin'
What the fuck you keep on fuckin' with me for?
Slut, you need to leave me the fuck alone, I ain't playin'
Go find you a white crayon and color a fuckin' zebra!
[Chorus]
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom!

[Verse 2]
Wait a minute, this ain't dinner, this is paint thinner!
""You ate it yesterday, I ain't hear no complaints, did I?
Now here's a plate full of painkillers, now just wait
'Til I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes
You little motherfucker, I'll make you sit there and make
That retarded fuckin' face without even tastin' it
You better lick the fuckin' plate, you ain't wastin' it
Put your face in it 'fore I throw you in the basement again
And I ain't givin' in, you're gonna just sit there
In one fuckin' place, finnickin' 'til next Thanksgiving
And if you still ain't finished it, I'll use the same shit again
Then when I make spinach dip, it'll be placed in the shit
You little shit, wanna sit there and play innocent?
A rack fell and hit me in K-Mart and they witnessed it
Child support, your father, he ain't sent the shit
And so what if he did? It's none of your dang business, kid!""

[Bridge 1]
My mom
There's no one else quite like my mom
I know I should let bygones be bygones
But she's the reason why I am high on what I'm high on, 'cause—
[Chorus]
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom!

[Bridge 2]
My mom loved Valium, now all I am
Is a party animal, I am what I am
But I'm strong to the finish with me Valium spinach
But my buzz only lasts about two minutes
But I don't wanna swallow it without chewin' it
I can't even write a rhyme without you in it
My Valium, my Vaaaaaa-liummmm, ohh!

[Verse 3]
Man, I never thought that I could ever be
A drug addict, naw, fuck that, I can't have it happen to me
But that's actually what has ended up happenin'
A tragedy, the fuckin' past ended up catchin' me
And it's probably where I got acquainted with the taste, ain't it?
Pharmaceuticals are the bomb, Mom, beautiful
She killed the fuckin' dog with the medicine she done fed it
Feed it a fuckin' aspirin and say that it has a headache
""Here, want a snack? You hungry, you fuckin' brat?
Look at that, it's a Xanax, take it and take a nap, eat it""
But I don't need it — ""Well fuck it then, break it up
Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up""
Alright Ma, you win, I don't feel like arguin'
I'll do it, pop it, gobble it and start wobblin'
Stumble, hobble, tumble, slip, trip, then I fall in bed
With a bottle of meds and a Heath Ledger bobblehead
[Chorus]
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom!

[Outro]
My mom, I'm just like her
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my momma
Me momma, I like-a da momma
Haha, sorry Mom
I still love you though!

Fuck Off,Kid Rock,"['country', 'rock', 'hip hop', 'metal', 'pop', 'r&b', 'blues', 'alternative']","[Verse 1: Kid Rock]
A shimmy shimmy go go motherfucking pop, bitch
It's the K-K-Kid Rock with the K-K-Kid Rock shit
I'm on top bitch and rock for tricks
Hella whips and nips and flip trips for whips
I get all the money pussy falls like rain
Been getting laid and paid that's why I never complain
If I ain't in it for the money I'm in it for the P
It's 1998 yo and you still can't fuck with me
You don't be fucking with the blue eye
Fucking with my 2-5 up your fucking ass like my shoe size
I got a new vibe, kinda like Voodoo
You do what we say and we'll do what we want to
We're fucking up your city and we're fucking up your program
Fucking all your bitches we can fucking give a goddamn
Twisted Brown gets down with no assistance
We won't quit until we're banned from existence
Persistence pays if that holds true
Then I'm gonna buy this fucking planet before the time I'm through
I was praised and raised on the thoughts of no fakings
So let me get what I got coming and the rest I'm taking
I'm shaking like Jerry Lee Lewis and shit
You act like the motherfucker's brand new at this shit
But I've been true to this shit giving my heart and soul
Been shining like a diamond but getting passed as coal
So fuck off
Yeah
[Verse 2: Kid Rock]
With my pants half hanging off my ass and shit
Bowl filled hash pockets stuffed with cash
I be the mushroom tripping sipping shots of Jack
Cause the kids don't listen getting lots of flak
I be the do wah diddy up and down you block and
The 10 karat Kid with my triggers cocking
The K the I the D R-O-C-K motherfucker and you still don't know me
So blow me bitch I don't rock for *cancer*
I rock for the cash and the topless dancers
Don't have no answers so pass the joint
I'm just paid in full and made in Detroit
I ride like Senna in the Indy 5
And get live with that which get's me high
Strive for perfection, this much is true
We do what we say, you say what we do
Kid Rock, I couldn't be no Bozo
And I get too much P to ever *be no homo*
I rock from SoHo to Arizona
I'm an easy rider dreaming of Winona
I roam the country like a Greyhound bus
Put faith in lust and in God I trust
I'm not Peter Pan I don't fuck with fairies
But I bust more rhymes than virgin cherries
And Harry Caray couldn't call my game
Fucked so many hoes I'm in the hall of fame
And I show no shame from coast to coast
I don't mean to brag, but I like to boast
Fuck off
[Interlude: Kid Rock]
Yeah, right in your mother fucking ass, bitch
With that Detroit city shit ain't shit swift we're on the same script
Nothing new since '76, Kid Rock
Yo, Slim Shady come break these motherfuckers off

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yo!
Tell the world to hold their breath, they're breathin' the wrong air
This planet belongs to me and this hippy with long hair
Two white boys who spike punch and light joints
Hang around drugs, loud music and like noise
Slim Shady and Brown Trucker another bunch of motherfuckers
Who hate the world just as much as each other
And I ain't leavin' this party tonight
Till I see some naked bitches dancing around drunk touchin' each other
Rum and Pepsi got your whole perception of me sketchy
'Cause when I stage dive people are scared to catch me
'Cause all I do is curse and fuck
So when I do shrooms you all better give me two rooms
'Cause I'm fuckin' the first one up
So when you see me on your block, you better lock your cars
'Cause you know I'm losin' it when I'm rappin' to rock guitars
This is for children who break rules
People that straight fools and every single teenager that hates school!
Fuck off!"
Love One,Common Market,"['hip hop', 'blues', 'jazz', 'r&b', 'pop']","(RA Scion)
And if you got one, love one…
You’re lucky just to have just one…

(Ra Scion)
One mother, one sister, one daughter, one wife
Once lost in the darkness; blessed by sunlight
Once blind to the bounties of livin’ – Lord, surround me with four women
To symbolize life; I’m born twice
For forty days and nights weathered the storm’s tug
My mother’s fear of the water taught me how to swim above
I fought waves as she prayed and never gave up
Her faith saved me, and I just wanna say “thank you for your love…”

(Ra Scion)
My memories of childhood are like dreams
I’m a drifter – thinkin’ of my sister’s like scenes
Of a movie; me screamin’ “you’re not my mom,” set to swing
You holdin’ me yellin’ to me “I’m the next best thing”
Six years of separation’s damn near a generation
But you never stopped trying to understand my motivation
And you always had my back when push came to shove
We’re the same blood, through the rain’s floods – “thank you for your love”
(Ra Scion)
I’ve said it before, I’ll say it to my death
I will never fully comprehend just why God left you
In my hands, when I could hardly stand, I guess
It was significant that you and I would take our first steps
In stride – me as a follower, you as a guide
Revealer of the way as you explain I play the scribe
Leader of the tribe – reason that Abeo came alive
My name, my pride, I take time to “thank you for your love”

(Ra Scion)
Who would have ever thought we’d come this far?
Two renegades who finally made their way to the stars
Built a bridge over the river of doubt and made “sound”
The foundation on which we would build this house
And ain't that what matrimony’s about; a shared vision?
We draw on the strengths of intellect and intuition
You’re the symbolism of liberated women, the definition of
What a companion does – “thank you for your love”

(Ra Scion)
Thank you all for your support in my times of need
Your belief in me empowers me to lead
And they wonder how I stand this firm to transgressions
Y’all taught to me the lessons every man must learn
Mother showed me how to fold my hands and thank God
Through my sister’s eyes – compromise was not hard
My daughter teaches me honesty and honestly
My wife teaches love for my mother, now my cipher’s complete
(That’s one love…)
(Ra Scion)
One mother, one sister, one daughter, one wife
Once lost in the darkness; blessed by sunlight
Once blind to the bounties of livin’ – Lord, surround me with four women
To symbolize life; I’m born twice
And lucky enough to have known a love like this
My dedication – the inspiration to write this
We’re consolidatin’ the family ties – we’re drawn tight
Knowin’ things are gonna be alright.."
Motherless Child,Ghostface Killah,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Yo, yo, guzzlin' forties (Let's get it on, fella), no doubt
The Wallabee champ comes back
Iron Man strikes back (Lou Diamonds, Tony Starks)
Raid your whole empire, no doubt

[Verse 1: Raekwon the Chef]
Rich man, poor man, read the headlines
Niggas gettin' murdered for spots and bigger dimes
Droughts and drug wars, living by gun law
Jail cats come home and want to take yours
As a young one, growin' up broke, me and my peoples
Had to sell coke, I guess we all in the same boat
Thinkin', plus drinkin' that ninety-proof
Layin' on the roof sayin', ""We need a next man to shoot""

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child (Yo)

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
I know a rich kid who got hit for three bricks
Showin' off his 850 plush, what a nice whip
Young blood guzzlin' forties, hustled in the rain
Old Earth, shootin' dope in her veins
He never had it all, the kid loved basketball
Had a favorite song, ""I Miss You"", written by Aaron Hall
Now back to the original neighborhood criminals
Clockin' dollars by the hour like his digital
Styrofoam silencers, he rolled around with the
Wildin'-est niggas peelin' caps, known as the Islanders
From Staten, where crazy clips be clappin'
Slept in expensive gold spreads, threads made of satin
Labeled as the cow, he had crazy beef
Seen him at the flicks, he pulled out on Duke, Hez and Latief
But he fucked up, he shoulda kept it real and went for kill
'Cause if he don't, these niggas with black barrels will
But shit never calmed down, one day downtown
He dropped an ounce off, money had slept like a nightgown
He rolled up in the Albee Square, relaxed like he lived in there
Two kids was beamin' him, them niggas from the movie theatre
One had all Guess on, lookin' like he had a vest on
The other Pelle Pelle tucked with a firearm
Movin' slow, baseball hats crazy down low
Word life, God, this bookhead nigga gotta go
Oh, shit, bookhead just bought a five G head
A King Tut piece, about the size of Little Maurice
We got to get him baby, yo, cousin, count to ten
I'm runnin' in, my first instincts is they're returnin'
The time is now, walked in and pulled out
Remember me, the nigga from the UA and you pulled out?
Don't move, don't even flinch, fix 'em up
Drop the head, don't want to get blood on the Tut
He burped, I shot him, bitch screamed out, I'm robbin' him
Had to hit him ten more times, make sure I got him
Told the owner lay on the floor, shake the comedy
Granny came out blacked down with a half a shotty
I laughed, grab the King Tut head and the cash
Granny shot my man in his ass and broke mega glass
Damn, had to go out with a blast
I shot my way up out of the Albee, fast
[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child (Oh shit, what the fuck? Shit was horrible)
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child

She call me Daddy, and never short with Daddy money

I'm never broke, never have a cast on me
Always paid, always got cash on me
I gotta feed, the pockets in my pants hungry
I'mma Phantom hauler, a shooter, not a brawler
And your girlfriend's a determinded Carter caller
Control a bitch and let a nigga hold a bitch
I put her on the corner shit, I let her make a porno flick
She will play the role again, whenever she roll again
Pop a pill, then roll again, now we on the road again
Yea, I work her, work her, tell her be my slave

It was a long days work, you could finally cool out
And relax, and kick back, and look on to the perks
Of that nine to five, you stayed alive and strived
Each day, to make it happen up until you reach pay
Now its time, deposit your grip and grow
That dream that you've been having since a minute ago
With miles and miles of smooth road jogging dials
Lots of options, you eating fish, no crab or lobsters
Not an issue, god is with you
You've done good, your voice power under the hood
Is amazing for blazing trails into the uncharted
Part of life that everyone under the sun is startled by
The beating of the heart don't die
Cause I'm multi, sharper than a suit and a bowtie
Still, you got to get back to seal the deal
Yeah, you know that you've got to work
But you know that also that (You gots to chill)

Your cold feet up, you worker read up
Things is good, shit is selling like hot cakes
You the king of hood
Everybody got dough from slinging pot to blow
The block is a goal, and no pocket is low
Time to fall back, get out of this
Do remain anonymous
Don't let the greed got you into a lot of shit
That's the good word, my man, just acknowledge it
Time will make every dirty dollar legit
Its a shame you had to go that route, but you can throw that out
You got low, now you can go back out
Enjoy the fruits of your labour, from scooping all the paper
That wasn't nailed down, fuck hanging around
Till the boys come taking you away for that poison
Locking you up, letting you out when you like forty-something
Your empire's already built, you getting all the bread, yeah
But you that one day (you gots to chill)

Look at you, looking all nutty like a cashew
Running around, man, somebody goin' smash you
Frightened or not, you need to slow down
You moving too fast like a Rubik's cube, all mixed up
Got your chest poked out, boy, you Mr. Bigstuff
Just the other day you were talking 'bout shits tough
In the hood, where you be at
But now, where you be at
Around all them biatches, acting like biatch
A wise man told me I told you so
You be handsome, leave your pay for your children so
Our God is the greatest whatever date it is
On the slate kid, I put time like a state bid
Now I'm home free, at the door holding the key
Opening the door, that these ain't home for me
Still the one real, ice cold Brooklyn wheel

Just finished tearing a house down in Tampa
These newscasters saying my dirty laundry filling up hampers
I keep filling up stangers with feelings of satisfaction and anticipation
Like every Laws man, can’t keep ‘em waiting
But in the meanwhile, I just touched down like a pedophile
Too soon? I think not, this is so much more than hip-hop
This is my big shot, yeah, know this is
I ain’t a show business but you better show some…
Spinning lime backwards when the wifey here
And she my hypest critic, I really want her to like my lyrics
I know I might lose if my range is broad
But I did it last time, it got me this far
And the past wasn’t living to the fullest, life set me free like a bullet
No Cobain, my style is so propane, so I’m going for the Grammy
I’m going for the Pullitzer, might as well throw me the noble
I’m still swinging, I ain’t hear no bell, I’m so ill
But I have no patience, waiting is aggravating

And I’m giving him daps, all I got is my life story and I’m giving him that
I got his hands raising like a pastor praying
I’m trying to have them saying…

New Crack,Wax,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
We got a million views
'Bout to drink a billion brews
In honor of the millionth view of this New Crack video
Three years ago I put it up there
I had to do a little recording

[Verse 1]
Yo. coming to you live and direct from the belly of the Sentra
It's big Wax, Dunny, and I'm at it again, bruh
I park when I spit not to press my luck
'Cause I ain't got no insurance and if I wreck I'm fucked
But when I ride beats, you couldn't deny that
'Cause you could use every syllable as a high hat
Rewind that and you'll find that the rhyme that
I just spit was perfect
Reverse it, half it, double time that
Anyway you want it, fam
Ask my mama, man
You could see a mic in my sonogram
I got my first tooth in the booth
And I wrote my first hook in a coloring book
And back then, my rhymes was outside the lines
And still are, Phones lose reception when I kill bars
I heard your shit, my ear's still scarred
Should've turned it down like opening a pill jar
Fuck Jake, we gon' wake and bake
I make papes when I battle all you fakes for cake
But now it's time for a station break
We wilin' out
[Verse 2]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, ayy, yo
Hey yo, spitting lyrics over this music, that is my calling
Rappers stepping to me, eventually they be falling
East coast to the West coast, U-hauling
King of San Diego, last name should be Stahlman
Ballin'
Now I reside in Hollywood
Your girl call me milk 'cause your boy did her body good
Yeah, she got the calcium
But she really couldn't tell cause her mouth be numb
She like
[*Onomatopoeia of a girl attempting to talk whilst
Her mouth is numb from dick sucking*]
She's always down
She reminds me of the teacher from Charlie Brown
I'm just a musical genius with a beautiful penis
And magical balls
Ticklin' them vaginal walls
Ladies, sit back and applause
Right after you cum, I spit tight, lick right
Call me Dracula tongue
Ayo, it's mind blowing when I'm flowing
You couldn't find no one who be showing the skills that I'm showing
Mind throwin' like a boomerang
Come back with stupid slang
That you couldn't understand. call me Pootie Tang
Yeah, I might as well say sadate
Mexicans give me props I'm like, de nada, güey
YouTube search, when you come across Wax
You'll see that I'm fire like Taco Bell sauce packs
I gloss tracks with high frequency audio polishing
When you hear it you will all be astonished
And your thoughts of what an MC should be
They will all be demolished
And from then on you will call me the hottest
Motherfucker that you've seen at a show performin', I'm the
Sole cause of global warming
My shit is like aw ish, aw ish
You're shit is just *snores*
For real,  the crowd's getting sleepy, B
But when I'm on stage is like they're on PCP
They like, do that thing, do that thing
My favorite genre of music is New Jack Swing, fucka
Whatever happened to that?
I used to like hearing motherfuckers rapping to that, you know?
I'll take you little fools way back to middle school science class
Bunsen burner, blaow, I'll fry your ass
Don't try to pass me like Monopoly go
I'll show cats how to properly flow
Ayo, let me explain
Wax is the nickname
Back with the spit game
Classic as Rick James
Back when he sniffed caine
Smacking the shit stained
To the mid frame
Of you bastards that spit lame
[Hook]
God damn, shit's still going out to my brother Herbal T
He's back from Rio, but let's go
Check it out, yo

[Verse 3]
The way that we be packaging this flavor in bars
You'd be like, ""Wax, do you work for either Quaker or Mars?""
I work the bass and the treble like the faders in cars
And won't stop spitting sick until y'all haters get SARS
Y'all think I'm dumb as shit
Just 'cause I spit strictly for the love of it
I already gave up on the government
Not trying to change the world, just making fun of it
And I ain't scared of the terrorists
Fuck all that, illegal immigrants?
I love y'all cats, come on over
Take a plane, walk, take a boat
What the fuck do I care, fam? I don't vote
There's two things that I care about, love and rhythm
And the people that I meet, and the love within 'em
And the beat goes on from the winter to the summer
'Cause time, it ain't nothing, but a go-go drummer
And the feeling in his wrist make you nod your fist
Make you realize God exists
'Cause if he didn't
Then how would we have this rhythm?
It don't make no sense to me
The way that we split time up so exactly
Without some time of stop watch technology
And I'm just saying, fam
The shit that I vow for
Fuck Iraq, hip hop, I die now for
So if you mad that I'm styling on you
Be glad if the Cal is on you
'Cause you gon' have to kill me before I stop wilin' on you
Like this"
HAM Remix,Busta Rhymes,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Busta Rhymes]
Excuse me
Tell me, who you really really really think is more lyrical?
'Cause everytime I go somebody gotta see the medical
And everytime I come, I’m eating everything that's edible
And if you ain't already know, then who be more incredible?
They wanna call me crazy like I’m borderline cynical
'Cause how I do it and I kill ‘em and I get incredible
And magically do it like this was another miracle
And if you don’t like it then you can suck up on my genitals
Ta-ta-ta-tal ta-ta-ta-ta-tals
Do it little bitch and get up off your little pedestal
And whenever you see me, you better salute the general
'Cause I will break it down to every single little mineral
(Slurp, slurp, slurp, slurp)
Suck up on my testicle again when you see me counting money
Move the decimal again
'Bout to cop another diamond out of Senegal again
Everybody saying that he's uncomparable again - okay
Killing everything I think we ’bout to have a funeral
A lot of you niggas be doing whatever you be doing
And I don’t even know what to call it, just sound terrible
Lower down the coffin, see we have another burial
These niggas that be rambling and babbling
I ain't hearing them
And everybody know that I be handling my B-I
When it come to other rappers niggas know that I be scarin’ them
Chop, chop, chop chop
Chop another beat up
Now you see the way I heat up, everybody wanna meet up
Just to come inside the building and witness another killing
Then I relax and throw a shot back, put my feet up
Every beat that I'mma touch I’mma lace
I’mma never stop even with a muzzle on my face
When I'm finished with this sissy, I'mma leave without a trace
Nigga kneel down better say grace
I go HAM!"
Motown 25,eLZhi,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: eLZhi]
I end careers, years, pierce ears fierce with spears
They say I'm gifted, get lifted like the beers in Cheers
Catch a thunder bolt, pockets stay lump from hundred notes
Stunning quotes make you run your coat while the sun's afloat
Prehaps, my skill is real as G Rap's, it feel as ill
As concealing drills in the knee caps
Your funny style get three snaps in the circle
When off the purple and greens
I'm higher than the jeans on Urkel, then I murk you
Bust tecs, the lead sparking now who be my next head target
I lift up, roll out like the red carpet
Say my name three times in the mirror and if I hear you
I'll appear clearer, extend both arms and pull you nearer
Pound for pound, I'm pretty live on the mic
And keep it flooded like Mike on Motown 25
Put your soul on ice and sold it for a whole known price
I'm nice, keep a knot swole on dice
Grin is sarcastic, the way my pen'll spark acid on the bar
Whether in the crib or the car, blast it
Son is a, prob' rob funds from your publisher
While his dogs put his guns to you like the Punisher
Or the Terminator, flow is harder than a German major
Midtermin' paper, the kid burns the saber
Striking cats, how you want it, gats, spike or bats
I know you liking that, I stay sharper than Viking hats
Exhale, blowed mist, served you with a cold dish
Niggas vomiting, bowels moving, they can't hold piss
EL and Royce, double team, hotter than a cup of steam
Club your spleen and bury you, just as deep as a submarine
Flawless, should be that very reason you applaud us
You saw us laying down a law just as raw as crawfish
You met your death and although, I took away your breath
And I ran, I still left with a grand like Theft Auto
[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9""]
You little niggas can't touch me, baby
Okay, maybe JAY-Z or maybe not
Pardon if I sound lazy, I've been puffing crazy
Writing Puff's shit, so, motherfucker, fuck you, pay me
Or lay down in your feces, my guns talk, I'm speechless
My pen's that Teller, I bends that fella, now peep this
I eat you and then wash you down with who you eat with
Me and eLZhi, yeah, we split, he's sick, I'm sick
I'm sick of how sick he is, he's sick of how sick me is
Me, baby me, sickest in the D, since the Shady LP
I can fuck, that's what ladies tell me
'83, I was fucking, I was six
Head in my momma's daycare, yeah, that was nothing, I'm the shit
Back into my rhyme again, niggas call me arrogant
That's because I'm confident, I found it when I found a pen
Three deals later, three meals later, tryna win
About to be signed again, that's right, I'm 'bout to clown again
Knock-knock, who is that? It's the cat that'll snap
Throw cheese in the trap, on your homie, you a rat
Ha-ha-ha, I'm back, matter of fact I've never left
Those who say they ain't expect it, can't accept it
Haters left this boy no choice but to blow
Fuck another ho from on another pole, fuck a show
Fuck a flow, I'm about getting money fast
While you rapping or perhaps you hustling sucka-slow
Ice glow, sticky green, Bush on sicky team
Capone, put powerful White Boy Ricky cream
Get him straight if he leans, fifty fiends in a line
Nickel Nine, been around, niggas you would kneel around
From Milan to Iran, I'm a don, now when I'm around
Niggas calmin down, eatin like it's Ramadan"
Friend Zone,Mickey Factz,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Mickey Factz]
My good friend, my secret crush
The girl that I want but don't see enough
Burberry scent, just the sweetest Touch
And when I see her strut, gives me a rush!
I can be the guy that can tell her she's the hottest
She's a pilot coming out her closet
I can be her confidant, show her that I'm honest
Serving to the queen bow down to the highness
Beauty fades but she's timeless
Apple in my iris, I see paradise
I'm tryna find the right words miss vanwrite
I wanna buy a vowel, hoping my cash is right

[Hook: Redd Stylez & Lundon (Mickey Factz)]
I got what you want but you don't see it yet
I want you in my arms but you just put me, in the friend zone
(You got me stuck, you got me stuck, can't get out)
In the friend zone
(You got me stuck, you got me stuck, can't get out)
[Verse 2: Mickey Factz]
If you're sick I'm your doctor
I talk to you better than a teleprompter
Let's take a ride high in a helicopter
And see the city from the eyes of a bird when it flies
I can be your second shot of ketel vodka... Right?
I got your feeling nice, I want you in my life
Tell you your jeans' fitting right when you put em' on
I'm the one that you're looking for
I can be, everything that you need
The air that you breathe
The mirror that you see, when you're staring back at me
I'm your shoulder, lean on me closer
It's good that I tell ya but it's better if I showed ya

[Verse 3: Mickey Factz]
Let me show you what I mean, I'm a tell you what I'm about
I, prove it everyday so that you'll never have a doubt
I'm the blood in your heart from your roof to your house
You don't EVER gotta ponder; hear the words from my mouth
I, can, be, what the others weren't
I ain't judging em baby girl but what's the verdict?
Captain to your ship, set sail, rest well
Take a little breather, I'm waiting for you to exhale
That's the breeze of a new life
Watch it flick your hair, let's take a picture there
Darling, they say your photo's a thousand words
Well the conversation crown is heard

Baby if you, just... Try me
I'll show you how good... I'll be, yeah..."
Skyscrapers,Mickey Factz,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","People asking where I've been at
Had to see the world and put food where my fridge at
Tours all over the place, brother I did that
When I was a little cat, didn't want a car
Used to look at skyscrapers like ""that's where I'mma live at""
I dreamed this, can you believe this?
It's so surreal how I'm living my achievement
It's 3 AM riding slow in my V6
Thinking why the hell it took so long to release shit?
Left turn, lanes start forming
Hit a red light as the rain started pouring
Open the sunroof, let the water come through
Leather getting wet, I don't care, cause it's just you
That's what the mirror say, I could be gone tomorrow
But since I'm here today, you're gonna hear me say
I'm changing, that ain't really fun
Change is good, though, ask any bum
Ask Obama, that was his campaign
All I'mma do is give you my last name
I'm losing friends for pursuing my career
When the music ends, will they truly be here?
I do pretend if I'll make it through the year
We can be cool again before a funeral appears
The beautifullest smear when the eulogy is near
Cause when they die, you talk them through the air
Annabel, I wish that you was here
I didn't see you go, cause I knew it wasn't fear
I go to church every week, looking stupid in the chair
Cause I'm taking enough space, I be waking up late
Walking in like I own that placing my faith in the grave
Next to you, I'm crazy like Mas-on Betha
Under mad pressure
Me and God ain't talk, cause I'm scared of the lecture
Now my mom is happy I'm not bummy
I'm on, so I automatically got money
Now she attached to me, she's stressing me out
Ayo, Jay this what success is about?
Wrestling doubt, call me Hulk Hogan with this dope flowing
They all hoping I'll drop, but I don't know owing
I got too much heart for them to bypass
Can't be touched, I ain't a iPad
My feet talk to the concrete every morning
I run the streets, doing push-ups on every corner
They think I'm lazy cause my content got smaller
When I've gone farther than my father, why bother?
I was touring, recording and interviewing
But to my fans I was interluding
Typical long day, leave me alone, mang
Even right now, I'm invisible on AIM
Ducking people, tired of trusting people
Damn near had enough of people, vice versa
I felt like a funny-style groupie
Came to her, threw the word ""love"" around loosely
Four-letter verb had her strut around droopy
I fuck around usually, it's nothing now to me
I shut it now truthfully cause
Cause I want a a wild cutie with a subtle round booty
But it's something about beauty it lasts for a little bit
Cause if the chick dumb, not even good brain could fix the shit
Lately I want a baby, that's crazy
Maybe I'm a three-legged chair, my thoughts shaky
So I get the box then I simply watch
Me pulling out quicker than a New York City cop
Deep shit, I don't sleep, kid
Cause some of y'all think my word don't mean shit
I put on these Y-3 kicks, cruise around 96
Straight with my leased whip
Looking at the skyscrapers
Upperwest-side chaser, you can't stop my grind, player
Changed the cover of this mixtape
Almost changed the title but I can't be rivalled
That's that, scratch that, that's Factz
Soon y'all gon' be downloading the Black App
Me and my pops made up for his last act
I'm his Kid, but I don't Play, I ain't a Class Act
Team player, trying to win Steve Nash rap
If you don't assist, then I'm past that
Got my eyes to the heavens watching birds skateboard
On the clouds, like the legend Tony Hawk when he skidding
Aiming for the top of the building while I'm living
I'mma get it; I'm moving on, I'm moving on
I did this, I did that, still doing more
Battered soul, what the fuck, I been through it all
When the things gonna change? Talk to me, y'all
Trying to get a skyscraper
Dying to get a skyscraper
Got both of my eyes on a skyscraper
I'mma get it, skyscraper"

It’s the number one push up
Put you rapps in the facts
Gonna for a second now I’m back for a while
You can ..my little cousin
He’s as bad as a champ/child
Now he’s at college with a cap and a gown
And that made me proud
He showed me I can make it
He told me I’m the greatest
Cause he knows I wasn’t faking
I was only being patient
I’m still in every second
A murder would take time
I’m killing every rapper
These lyrics are my weapon
If I aim them at your head
You’ll be brain dead
I’m married to the game
These rappers is k fed
Trying to eat off what I did
That's word to j sledge

Up from the bed
I’m looking to the mirror
Today I’ll be better than you
Look what I’m wearing
Got my pride on my shirt
My heart on my sleeve
My thoughts on my kicks
All this love in my jeans
And you know how it seems
That when you getting green
They think being Bruce Banner
How its supposed to be
We’ll see I was told
Don’t let the money change me
Get in of my way and
You won’t like me when I’m angry
They say it’s truly as dough
Im lou ferrigno with this music shit bro
Got that crucifix flow
I'm carrying my cross
I’m headin’ up the cavalry
Looking for the lord saying

[Verse 3: Mickey Factz]

Factz
I’m back
They said I wouldn’t last
They told me break a leg
But they wouldn’t sell my cast
They pray for MF DOOM
But I didn't wear a mask
Jus a pair of frames on
Seeing life through the glass
My bank accounts sad it's
Running out of cash
Bills coming up the ass
And my mama want a bag
I got a free car
But I don’t give free gas
All that says is
Nothing up on this life’s gon last
Is that the legacy you lead
So please all remember the memories You breed
And never will I be what I said I wouldn’t be
But I am legend so I tell them what I see me

If she can't stick to the script, stick to this dick
How she acting off of the fifth? Ridiculous shit
We don't need conversation, just crowd participation
If you here on vacation we got, rules and regulations
Separate myself from y'all, segregation
Trying to stop Xzibit and Dre? Humiliation
Pure elevation, got me some inspiration
Two bitches in bubble baths, a beautiful invitation
Got a live occupation, live for the moment
I'm faced with an altercation manhandling my opponents
I got eyes in the back of my head
I never sleep so they bloodshot red
Yo we so far ahead of our time
If we can stop life and press rewind

Your shit ain't selling? Fuck it, get Dr. Dre on it
You got a budget? I'll get down, give me half of it

Who can invade who nigga, and who can do who the worst
Warning from the Surgeon General
Watch out for fake hits and bullshit that sounds identical

This is dedicated to the people that spoke too soon
I think I'll stop shooting you niggas and shoot for the moon
Motherfuckers turn respect on and off like a light switch
I'll never be seen, like Farrakhan fucking a white bitch
Jump I won't flinch, dump I don't miss
X holding this, I'm never losing faith or focus
So say what you gotta say, every day a holiday

Dirty Diamond,Snibunny,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]

This is how I work on the Dirty Diamond
Nail them one by one with precise and timing
Going all out when I toe the rubber
Put them all in a slump thrown in the gutter
I get all the bats whipped like a bowl of butter
It's like I put a hole in one, I don't need a putter
Put their mind in a clutter
Batter steps up see the coward shudder
Then I mutter without stutter under my breath
""Next victim please"" put my skills to the test

[Verse 1]

Pitch number one is my bread and butter
Inside or out, it's the fastball cutter
I put two seams at my finger tips
Offset one side through the air it rips
So accurate
Right to the mitt
Outside corner so hard to hit
Solid so I get the grounders late in the count
Sticky situation roll them over and out
With the two for one
Getting my job done
Everybody knows double plays are fun
But as for me I'm all about the k's
So when the counts 0-2 I throw it in above the waist
Grip four seams so it's hard and straight
It ain't cutting away so they take the bait
But by the time they bite already too late
Now he's chasing at the up and in
Sit on the bench again
""Next victim please"" the next challenge begins
[Hook]

[Verse 2]

Next on the list is my signature pitch
My screwball makes working lefties a sinch
The way it breaks away you can see them flinch
Two strikes already? Now they're on the bench
Cause screw baby breaks in the other direction
And adjusting mid-swing is just out of the question
So have a nice seat in he strikeout section
When fix my grip to my curve's reflection
But throwing it to righties is a different sense
Leave it over the plate they'll leave it over the fence
Gotta keep it in and make them chase
Or slam the back door with a tread of the lace
So I just save it for lefties to put the boys in their place
""Next victim please"" I'm in the strikeout race

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

My curve is so gross I'm making maggots sick
I'm defying physics like a magic trick
Drops top of the mountain down the viper's pit
My go to pitch for the strikeout
In the zone and it's lights out
Without a doubt
Locking their knees up it's like gout
See the break freeze them out
Make it so they can't swing
Right at their face and then I pull strings
Like a marionette
Then I'm burying it
Just above the knees and I'm willing to bet
The ump ringing you up and it's the closest you get
To getting a hit
Cause if it starts at the belt you'll be swinging at air
Have it hitting the dirt before it even gets there
Bounce in front of the plate
Now you and bench have a got a real hot date
""Next victim please"" I'm the ace on the mound that you love to hate"

Got my name all in your mouth
I should have been a dentist
Yeah, everybody done did it
Everybody's a critic
I'm like ""Whatchu talkin' bout"" like everybody's a Willis
Man, they say they love you when the block on smash
Since they so in love, tell 'em they can kiss my cash
Wait a minute you don't like me, Well I don't like you
These fakers sayin' that they real but I see right through
The old me, that was the realest person I knew
The new me probably the realest person times two
[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
So when you feels like it's everybody for themselves
And the place where ya living is'nt far from hell
And they keep tellin' you ""you were born to fail""
And everybody say they real but it's too hard to tell
So until I die, I'mma always grind
I'mma be ok, I'mma be alright
If they say I fail, that would be a lie
But there ain't no such thing as a tie
They only love ya when ya on

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Hold up
You got to be out ya conscience
They ain't got no sense, that's why they call it nonsense
How they gon talk about what you never accomplish?
Like they dun done something thats worthy of my responses
Look at the tags, I'm showing 'em how to stunt G
Candy and papers plates, it looks like I got the munchies
It's so ironic they couch got money in 'em
But y'all always on the couch and never get any money
Where's Cupid, they only love ya till ya next hook
But I don't check the gossip blogs
I check check books
Ask Lebron they say winning is the best look
Every move I make is right like I ain't got a left foot
To keep it real a record deal couldn't stop me
I'm bootlegging bullets, you can still get a copy
Lucifer is in a pair of heels in the lobby
I don't dance with the devil call it trilluminati

So when you feels like it's everybody for themselves
And the place where ya living is'nt far from hell

I'mma be ok, I'mma be alright
If they say I fail, that would be a lie
But there ain't no such thing as a tie
They only love ya when ya on

Northside where ya at
Northside let me know you got my back

They only love ya when ya on

Southside where ya at
Southside, let me know you got my back

They only love ya when ya on
Westside where ya at
Westside let me know you got my back
[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, I'm a get money nigga, on a daily basis
Road to the riches, potholes in the pavements
Thats why I follow every rule and regulation
Making rap money off this game I've been laced with
Uh, and you can blame it on black sam
Blame it on Crenshaw and Slauson Ave
Fly wit' bad bitch with a fat ass
Bail money, big pistol and black mag
That's how we play it, we living with the fast cash
To all my haters, consider this the last laugh
I've been the greatest in my city, now I'm past that
It's all money ASCAP, broke bitches bag back
Please, Louie notes, Louis back packs
First class seats like a pillow top mattress
Uh, we can't take it to the casket so I'mma spend these rags
Just to laugh at your reaction

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
So when you feels like it's everybody for themselves

Bulletproof tuxes, knuckle games is clobbering busters
Eighteen niggas is bringing the ruckus
Flamethrowers on our backs and shoulders
The rusty joints still work
The trey-eight'll blow one of your dojos
When there's mad heat, I'm mad calm
Walk around, gold collect, 36 O before G bomb
My inner strength flowing, I mastered Qi-Gong
Y'all Planet of the Apes, standing next to King Kong

Beer-drinking, Cuban Linking, new way of thinking
Got me thinking, ""Meth, break the handcuffs, run out the precinct""

We rock fitteds, drop kid-id, I lived it, it's not, quit it

Behold the pale horse, off course (off course)
Follow me, Wu-Tang gotta be
The best thing since Starks and Clark Wallabees
African killer bees blackwatch
On your radio, blowin out yo' watts
From Park Hill, the house on haunted hill
Every time you walk by your back get a chill
Let's peel, who want to talk rap skills
I spit like a semi-automatic to the grill
Elbow grease, and elbow room
Baby play me, baby fall down, go boom
Party people gather round, count down to apocalypse

And I'm the motherfuckin Hot Nicks pass the blunt
My nigga don't front
You had it for a minute but it seem like a month
Now I'm chokin, smokin, hopin
I don't croakin, from overdosin
Hey, kid, walk straight, master your high
Wu and Meth got you open (open), let's ride
Can't stand niggas that floss too much
Can't stand Bentleys they cost too much

Kid wanna stick up then kid get stuck

The world's greatest, Las Vegas, paid as rock
Skin painted on my face look ageless
Perfect combos, Ghost bang out condos

Bancos, stank hoes in plain clothes
Change those, bang those, same old, same old

I'm taking all bets, move all best, who want the dram' next
You all stank, we got the bigger bank
Bigger shank to fill your tank
Still the same kill you for real, while you crank
Slide, do or die, fry to bake
Admire the greats, on fire wit a heart of hate
Bitter shark, every part I take, heavy darts that quake
It's okay, all fakes, get caught by the dropkicks
You know the thrill, yes it's Park Hill

Yeah, uh
Barrel full of powder, ship full of tea
Closer by the hour, bringing sick to the seas
Bellies full of barter, thick with the thieves
Once they hit the harbor it's a wick in the breeze
There goes another one (whoa!), right out from under 'em
Different seashore, same thirty stores
There goes another one (whoa!), right out from under 'em
Worldwide mining town, steal it up, sell it down
And not too long ago, mom and pop owned this shop
Prognosis progress, the Dow owns the block
Here to sell 'em salvation or elevation -- sort of
Signal disorder, it's Celebration, Florida
They got the medicine to fix your mood
Till you learn to mind your place and eat that Sysco food
You crave the arrogance the rich folk ooze
Take life, waste life just to get those jewels

[Chorus: P.O.S]
Uh huh, uh huh, heads will roll
Low light low life, recite that untold
Keep with the goals, rehearse for the eleventh hour
It will be arrow after arrow after bullet after sunflower
Uh huh, uh huh, heads will roll
Low light low life, recite that untold
Keep with the goals, rehearse for the eleventh hour
It will be barrel after barrel after barrel of that gunpowder

[Verse 2: Dessa]
It seems we've fallen out of favor, the era ended on us
Now the money's just paper, the houses all haunted
We had a hell of a run before it caught up
For all the corners cut we got an avalanche of sawdust
Life of the party, we're the death of the novel
The glass is half-empty so pass the next bottle
It's flight of the salesman, death of the bumblebee
Nothing left for the attorneys and the tumbleweeds
They say that God's on the right, so goes the rhetoric
But I think that cross is a kite that left a skeleton
And I think that Russell was right, but that's irrelevant, friend
For all I know there'll be nothing left to defend tomorrow
Sugar in the gas tank, nothing in the cashbox
Thought that we were so sick, looking like it's smallpox
The bullets are still on the shelves
But when the armory empties, we're melting down the bells

[Chorus: P.O.S]
Uh huh, uh huh, heads will roll
Low light low life, recite that untold
Keep with the goals, rehearse for the eleventh hour
It will be arrow after arrow after bullet after sunflower

Keep with the goals, rehearse for the eleventh hour
It will be barrel after barrel after barrel of that gunpowder

It's the end of law and order, Dick Wolf
Aware in America, rocking a cheap sheep suit
Pulled wool, weave through
Stay on course till pulled over by that pulled pork
Cops keeping the peace/piece... cocked
Catch and release like a sportsman, see 'em in the court then
Piss poor paying them a portion, huh
Funny how they distort extortion
Never better, P.O.S. dance to the rhetoric
Lean to the left, call me terrorish, rock with it
Dance fever got 'em peeping out the prints on the floor
True believers keep they eyes on the horizon
Catch me sizing up the silent, check the crooked grind
Watch me 50/50, keep the balance between the coping and the feeble mind
I hope the broken folk rewind
Nothing much for token jokers here, skate off, we doing fine

Kinetic responses were heard frequent in the past
When speakin lashes to the tongues of father's demons semen
Somehow catered to the whims of later stood
Check the youth, shoot like stormtroopers theorizing Darth Vader hood
Gave a good thumbs up type of scream
To symbolize the arrival
Cause we've arised from the dream
With a red beam that fastens to my chest
Wearin' a string of beads of sweat
Decorating this helmet that shelters and protects my laptop
The brain contains the game
And the fast talk
More traffic than the average vagrant's favorite crack spot
Last stop
To catch a breath for twenty miles
Cause this field is filled with more snakes
Than MC's that fake their freestyles
Your optimism, is far from natural
Caught the label of asshole
Cause I'm twice as tight as the rest, this rappin's vaginal
Stand clear, cause when my shit comes, the big fun
Pushin' up in and out of your bitch system like a piston
Glistening, in the twilight, hill top, with his ability, stablility
And shoot my spunk on your soliloquy
The children see right through the smoke screen
The mist around your own soul provoking, your own choking

And one that likes to lounge on
Overcrowded spots so I can find someone to clown on

With a lot of shit in my cottage
Come to my store, tryin to fight
Get fucked like Marcellus Wallace

Blah blah, that's all I'm hearin
From the opposition. Just a buncha cocky dissin, ya kiddin
Wanna battle, huh?
Last two times
Mc's were found dead
In a fast food line
Mash you, I'mma mash you (who them?)
Yeah that crew
Separate the bitches like a capsule cause they fragile
Knock em off the saddle
Make em flip to the leaves
And they'll wake up paralyzed like, Christopher Reeves
Take a breath, here quick
Take one more
Before you finally realize that ya layin' in the morgue
This is the core, of the underground
Listen cause I'm sayin' somethin' now

You understand me boy?
Watch, watch this, you you, come here, come here
Come to me, come to me, witness this

I'm kind of conservative when it comes to this rap shit
Cause when I glance across the surface all the words is written backwards
And actions speak much louder than your heavy rotation
I'll rock a crowd that's never heard of us, on any occasion
No longer patient
You got my cranium Achin
Prepare my awareness
And start to measure up these square pegs
To figure out which crescent wrench it's gonna take
To beat this stake into my skull
To numb, and dull this headache
Fiberglass rappers leave with cracked brains
Shattered names line the hallways of all the ways I came
Contained under lids, locks and a two headed dog, with a sawed off
Is where Ant makes the breaks to get your rocks off
Molotov tossed into the ring of lost causes
Formerly known as MC's (southside lost provisions)
Cause it's more cost-efficient to kill the bad apple and save the core
Then to let nature run it's course, of course
You cross me, spread my wings and leave you stranded on this planet
(Cross me, spread my wings and leave you stranded on this planet)
Cross me, spread my wings and leave you stranded on this planet
Dungeon after dungeon, dragon after dragon after dragon

I am not a pattern to be followed
The pill that I'm on is a tough one to swallow
I'm not a criminal, not a role model
Not a born leader, I'm a tough act to follow
I am not the fortune and the fame
Nor the same person telling you to forfeit the game
I came in the ring like a dog on a chain
And I found out the underbelly's sicker than it seems
And it seems ugly, but it can get worse
'Cause even a blueprint is a gift and a curse
'Cause once you got a theory of how the thing works
Everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first

Rocking every stage in every place that it brought me
I'm awfully underrated, but came here to correct it

Nigger Experience,Goodie Mob,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Yeah, better believe that slick
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha yeah
I Thought you said you was the G-O-D
Sound like another nigga to me, ha ha, yeah
I thought you said you was the G-O-D
Sound like another nigga to me, shit
What a nigga do, what a nigga does
And a nigga is what a nigga was
And a nigga done read history but yet his eyes didn't see
The only reason you a nigga is because somebody else wants you to be
Well a nigga uneducated, intergrated, singin' ""We shall overcome""
A nigga trying to be white is what a nigga seem like have become
And when they call me a nigga to my face'
Can't do nothin' but walk away
But here it is niggers call other niggers niggers each and every day
Dividing and conquering
When they say the lighter shade of black is okay
After the middle class and they passin' by
The project laughin' at where we stay
Since a nigga had got grown, had a little bitty of nigga of my own
Should've known I couldn't show 'em no better what I was showin'
Shit, I could've hit the club as fresh as I could be
Really, all for another nigga to see
You know how a nigga get when he see another nigga outfit
Don't want nobody to have what he ain't got
Somebody get drunk, get mad, and get shot
That why the property value ain't no good in a nigga neihborhood
A nigga could overstand if he only understood
I'm sick of lyin' I'm sick of glorifyin' dyin'
I'm sick of not trying, shit I'm sick of being a nigga
Destiny sent me to this dread and she said she felt led
To offer me some wisdom from this notebook she read
And it said that right then the black man's downfall
Was not know that we were not ever niggers at all, hmm
And she looked deeply into my eyes and said brother don't you know
You complain about being black
When they mad coz they can't be black no mo'
So many black men out here trying to be niggers
Keeping it real to the point that they dying to be niggers
When in actuality the fact is you ain't a nigga because you black
You a nigga cause of how you act
But, you don't want me to tell you the truth, so I'mma lie to you
Make it sound fly to you huh, huh
You don't wanna hear the truth, so I'mma lie to you
Make it sound fly to you, shit
The nigga experience
The nigga experience
Has been stated, it was created
The nigga experience"
Live It,Paul Wall,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook - Yelawolf]
I deserve to play, it's been a few days, ain't showed it all
I go outside and breathe, roll down my sleeves and have a ball
Still got these bills to pay and a family, I'm workin hard
But I got a life too, so I throw on my shoes and I live it y'all

[Verse 1 - Paul Wall]
I'm fresher than a peppermint and cold as a cough
When I pull up in that foreign and I break boys off
Super ballin is a product of a hard knock life
No more Ramen noddles spread, no more struggle and strife
From a Buick to a Beamer, ambitions of a dreamer
Motivated by Mob Figaz and Andre Nickatina
I'm gettin paper while you're in the shade drinkin Zima
I'm a schemer, you just waitin on your check from FEMA
Been evadin the subpoena to appear in court
Different hustle every season like I'm playin a sport
""Life is Too $hort, wouldn't you agree?""
See, the best time I ever had in my life was free
My best friend wasn't real, he came with a fee
Reduced time for your sentence come with a plea
Livin in the free world and I'm blessed
Paper chasin is my quest, I grind with no rest
[Hook - Yelawolf]
I deserve to play, it's been a few days, ain't showed it all

Still got these bills to pay and a family, I'm workin hard
But I got a life too, so I throw on my shoes and I live it y'all

[Verse 2 - Raekwon]
I'm not an actor, a role model with soul or clapper
I work hard, a good gangsta nigga, blow a stack up
Time still movin and shit, stay on the grind, it's just excuses
Girls lookin at you, you useless (word?)
When everything is wrong, it look like it'll fall
I'm on the job feet first with direction and all
I like coca and then gotta come home and stroke her
Take time, clean my rims and go loc' her
Just wanna lay up, damn
I need two minutes to rest, go 'head and take the Lex' out, scram
Then it's beef in the jump off, cause I needed one off
It's like you drew your gun on me in a gun off
Shit won't change, so move with it (move with it)
This is my life, I'm only livin it, so don't go and ruin it
Words from a legend, keep your dome up in the sky
Listen to Paul Wall and Chef Fly (get high)

[Hook - Yelawolf]
I deserve to play, it's been a few days, ain't showed it all

[Verse 3 - Jay Electronica]
Dear Mr. President, have you seen FEMA?
Have you seen the lower 9th Ward, post Katrina?
Niggas scufflin tryin to find something tangible
The impedes is treatin all the youth like animals
Then wonder why the cops gettin rocked like Mosley
Why niggas on the TV in the spot like cozy
Now Houston got a problem, Atlanta got a problem
Dallas, Alabama and Miami got a problem
Niggas wildin out, livin free, yellin sovereign
.38 revolvin, crack rock ballin
Tats on they face that say Uptown New Orleans
Blastin on sight, fuck fightin, fuck arguin
Meanwhile boat loads of cash go to Israel
Soldiers in Iraq pray to God for a miracle
Sam Cooke said that change was comin
If not, you can bet your ass, danger's comin

[Hook - Yelawolf]
I deserve to play, it's been a few days, ain't showed it all

Hurt,T.I.,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba
You pussy niggas finna make me kill one a y'all

[Hook: T.I.]
Ain't a damn thang change
I still keep that thang right up under my shirt
Betta tell 'em I ain't playin'
Because it's all fun and games until somebody get hurt
Ain't a damn thang change
I still keep that thang right up under my shirt
Run up on him where he hang and BANG!
Cause it's all fun and games until somebody get hurt
Boy you finna get hurt, murked, put him in the dirt
Boy you betta catch me first
Boy you finna get hurt, murked, put him in the dirt
Boy you betta catch me first
Boy you finna get hurt, murked, put him in the dirt
Boy you betta catch me first
Boy you finna get hurt, murked, put him in the dirt
Boy you betta catch me first
[Verse 1: T.I.]
Alota pussy niggas talk like broads love runnin' they mouth
That is til I run in they house
Put the gun in they mouth, tell 'em ""Nigga talk shit now""
You'd think they know the gun go BOW!
I ain't scared of the law
Naw I'm about to go to war what it is nigga win lose or draw
I'll never get caught murkin' y'all cuz it ain't what you do
The question is: Who saw?
Shawty I'm way too raw
Catch me any day you want you could think I'm a play if you want
But the fact still remain if I got a AK and you don't
Well then playa you gone
Don't get me wrong there's some niggas wanna kill me too (Well where they at?)
But this ain't bout shit cause it's well known where I'm at
They could catch me in the booth right now if you really like that
Naw nigga let they ho get him in the whole shit, the 44 spit they holla ""Oh shit!""
Protectin' her and you both hit
You betta check ya girl cause you be so sick
If the choppa leave you with no dick
Or a plastic bag holdin' yo' shit
Leave 6 in you, a couple more in ya bitch
And I don't miss cause I'm focused nigga

[Hook: T.I.]
[Verse 2: Alfa Mega]
(I got you Tip)
(I'm finna ride homie)
Fuck niggas might talk loud, act real, but they don't really want this here
Pussy niggas betta act right, lay low, we know where ya family live
Trust me you don't want me up in ya crib with a ski mask on duck tapin' ya kids
You can pray all you want but I don't forgive
Ya shoulda been doin' that before ya did whatcha did
I ain't gotta spell it out pimp you know what it is
I'll rest you case for ya real man you know what it is
Plus I got a hundred goons with me, dressed in black
Fifty at the front door, fifty at the back
Half got K's, half got Macs
Bring 'em out, bring em out, show me where he at
We can do him right here, we could catch him in trap
Run up on his 'lac put a hole in his hat
With his brain on the dash, and his thoughts in his lap
And dump 50 more on him and tell him to hold that
Lights out, no hasta mañana, hasta la vista, sayonara
Y tú no tomorrow, no remorse and no sorrow
And the next one a y'all niggas try me like that
I swear to God man I'm really gon' snap

[Hook: T.I.]

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Right now I'mma give you somethin' that a make a nigga beg ""Please""
When a bullet wiz by, he'll probably feel a little breeze
Drop to ya knees, see the big barrel of the chrome
Fifth triple grip handles in the squeeze
I keep a couple of those for the niggas who talk shit
When I go to Jacob and cop that ring
If you try to see me I'mma cock that thang
And I'mma pop that thang, and the shots gon' sting (really?)
The nigga ride inside the truck with me (and) for the most part the nigga stuck with me
And tell you somethin' if you really were smart and you knew
Better people probably tell ya don't fuck with me
Front if want motherfucka you can catch it
Smile on my face even though I got a ratchet
Pop off (police) pull me over believe I got a compartment if I gotta stash it
Must I just remind y'all niggas when I come through
Know that I'mma find y'all niggas, take two (break through)
Bust so many shots gun powder probably blind y'all niggas now (Okay, okay let's go)
See you don't know really wanna feel that Mossberg blow (naw)
Clap up a nigga then I cap up a nigga
When I finish it'll turn into an absurd show (listen)
Then you better observe yo
Feel the sizzle from the bullet of the Glock burn slow (ssss)
Shit'll probably twist you up just a little and have your body leanin' lookin' like a quarter past four
Stay down betta (lay down)
Checkin' for a nigga, come and put your body in the dirt
I don't play bitch, you really need to go the other way
If you ain't know I got it under my shirt

On My Way,Outasight,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
I’m on my way
I’m not sure how the rest goes
Soon as I do, I’ll let you know
I’m on my way
I’m not sure how the rest goes
Soon as I do, I’ll let you know

[Verse 1: Outasight]
Beat skipping like we throwing a stone
Party start jumping ‘round one in the morn
Two turntables and one long night
Morning come quick but stopping ain’t right
And I’m hopping this flight on the road less traveled
Did my dirt, got stuck in the gravel
Bright lights, big city, face of the apple
Grazed in the pastures, placed with no masters
The face of disaster could stare right back
Johnny walker black for a long nightcap
Yeah, I roll like that so if you rolling with me
It’s a long haul, the straight nitty gritty
Bad luck won’t stop so please no pity
Be home real soon, come back in a jiffy
Rain against my window like I’m talking to missy
If I’m gone tomorrow, will they ever really miss me?
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Outasight]
And they say you never miss something till it’s gone
Spent my early 20’s sitting high at home
Going to school and playing the course
Heard a million times you can do better off
Losing your ambitions, messing ‘round is fun
Wake up ‘round noon, dropped out 21
And I didn’t say any of this is an achievement
Meaning I don’t need no nod of agreement
Hard headed, stubborn to a fault
180’d those in the way, a true summersault
‘Cause it’s hotter than July when the pressure start to melt
Every emotion on the sleeve and every lyric felt
Any melody sang comes out like a belt
Heard all across the world and I’m highly compelled
To figure out this story that I have to tell, I wonder if I will

[Hook]"
Twenty Something,Outasight,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
I say I’m done, never again
I say we're lost, never can win
I say what can you do when you’re twenty something and...

[Verse 1: Outasight]
Days feel the same when you get older
Feel the weight on your shoulders
I can’t explain but I don’t know what I want to do with my life
And all my friends miss being alive
All tied up in nine to fives, good bye
Get your degree, a nice piece of tree
And head right to the back of the line

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Outasight]
Bored as hell so I went out for a ride
Past by a bar with college kids outside, smoking cigarettes
Trying to make sense of the world and seem more mature
Stopped myself as I rolled up to the light
A convertible with a old dude driving pulled right up to my side
All the sudden I began to realize
We all trying to be twenty
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Outasight]
All this time, I tried to find
An answer to what I was supposed to do and now it’s clear
I faced my fears of gaining years
Age is just a state of time, not of mind

[Hook 2]
I say I’m done, never again
I say we're lost, never can win
I say what can you do when you’re twenty something and…
Twenty something and twenty something and…
Twenty something and why does it have to be so difficult?"
These Worries,Kid Cudi,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Yeah, the crazy, the wizard
So much whiskey all in my liver
I really like the punch it delivers
Makes me warm while I high-five sinners
All alone, trying to hide from the shadows
Ain't no use, it seems everywhere, they follow
They know where I be at
Infect my mind, tryna get me

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & Kid Cudi]
These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My pride, it won't let me fall victim no more (no more)
These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My pride, it won't let me fall victim no more (no more)

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
Life is like that
Beat me up, and I'll fight right back
Poof, poof, be gone
I see the devil linger on
Yeah, stuck in my hell
Lied to my mom, and I ain't doing so well
Lord, let me in
I feel like He's my only friend
[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Yeah, the rager, the menace
Hate me now, then hate me when I'm winning
Work so hard to not go insane
It's a full-time job to not lose my faith
Okay, I've been here before
Alone for the umpteenth time or more
I'm tired of motherfuckers saying that they worried 'bout me
When, in fact, they probably never gave a fuck about me

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & Kid Cudi]
These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My pride, it won't let me fall victim no more
These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My pride, it won't let me fall victim no more

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
Yeah, life is like that
Beat me up, and I'm fighting right back
Poof-poof, be gone
I see the devil linger on
Yeah, I wanna win
As long as I can do the work within
Lord, let me in
I feel like You're my only friend
[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & Kid Cudi]
These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My pride, it won't let me fall victim no more
These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My pride, it won't let me fall victim no more

Yeah, the rager, the menace"
