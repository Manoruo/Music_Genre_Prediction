Home Run,Juelz Santana,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Ai , im baaaack
Wake up in the mornin with one thought
I gotta get it
Then I hop up in the shower, had my bitch already in it
While she wipe me down, I stroke her breasts
Hopped out the shower soaking wet
I’m already fly and I ain’t even put my clothes on yet
Cuz
They get fly (they get fly), I am fly (I am fly)
They get fly (they get fly), I am fly (I am fly)
They get fly (they get fly), I am fly (I am fly)
Aight, ya niggas know me!

[Lil Wayne - Hook]
Now I got money on money, and bitches on bitches
Bring my chopper to the office, let it handle all my bidness
I got money on my mind, and I’m thinking all day
Keep a bad bitch to fuck me when I had a long day
Cuz my money make money and my bitches get bitches
Bring my chopper to the office, let it handle all my bidness
I get baseball money, check my home run average
Take over the game and let my homeboys have it
[Juelz Santana]
Uh, aight
Ok I’m up to the plate, homerun is gone
You know what that means, time to bring that money home
Brown paper bags still talk that money
And my money make money I don’t touch that money
I got money mad at me yeah upset money
I got money over money thats bunk bed money
Crib so spacious, whip so matrix
Keep chicks with me, and they [their] hips bodacious
Nigga like me move quick, no patience
Rockstar life, everyday clique wasted
Everyday’s a long day, I get money the long way
Go to sleep then wake up with it, bed full of naked bitches
They know I got that juice and they just want a taste, a sippin’
I be battin’, they be pitchin’, Barry Bonds the way I hit it
Listen, they get fly (they get fly), I am fly (am fly)
Aight, ya niggas know me!

[Hook]

[Juelz Santana - Verse 2]
Uhhh

Swag on Easter, that wrist on freezer
That bitch on diva, waist on heater
Lungs on reefer, pockets on pizza
And when it come to gettin dough I’ma roll like Pita (yup)
Coke on the scale, Libra
Hail Mary niggas, no Mother Teresa
Aight, I’m forever on my grind (grind)
Cuz you can freeze the watch but you can never freeze the time (no)
You pop shit, I show shit
You got shit, I own shit
That fly shit, I’m on it
I’m hot shit, you novice
Man, ok I’m up to the plate, homerun is gone
You know what that means, it’s time to bring that money home

[Juelz Santana]
Wake up in the mornin with one thought

While she ride me down, I stroke her breasts
Hopped out the shower soaking wet

Cuz
They get fly (they get fly), I am fly (I am fly)(x3)
Aight, ya niggas know me!

[Verse 1: Outasight]
See, this is the part where I let it go
Never been one to ever-ever fuss and fight
The spotlight's on, now it’s time for the show
Where everyone except me seems to be alright
Oh my-oh my future is in the hands of you
No lie-no lie, it seems to scare the shit out of me
The fact remains the truth’s the toughest pill to swallow
Do you have something to drink that I can borrow?

[Hook]
See you hear you, don’t you let go, oh
Feel you don’t quite get me, you never do
I only hear what I want to hear
So tell me something good now that I’m here
I said ten-four and over and out
Copy, I get what you’re talking about
[Verse 2: Outasight]
See, this is the part where it let it go
Never ever been one to agree to disagree
Didn’t sign up to watch from the front row
I thought the world revolved around me
Damn this dialogue get’s so confusing
Not understanding, I feel like I’m losing hope
For every word that you scream or utter
Goes in one ear and out the other
Motherfucker won’t fight for long, used to argue just to argue
See the odd truth that I liked it
Later on, I moved onto a different ensemble around truth
Hmmm, despite shit seeming like it never gon change
So far gone but really lack range
Not all the pitfalls come with fame
Being regular is hard enough, so pick a side, ala carte
Do you listen to them or do you do what you want?
I may be stubborn but unlike many others
I don’t get offended when people act above us, I say fuck ‘em

First thing’s first, I heard that
Everyone thinks they deserve a little fame and fortune
They want it all, have it all
Lastly that I find, I am bout to go for mine
I can’t explain it, I want it, I have to have it all

[Verse 1: Outasight]
Back from hiatus, let me be the first to say hi haters
Tailored slacks, raw labors
Substance, style, we all lust for the papers
School of hard knocks, no majors
Everyone’s on ya tip, no waiters, still partying, no favors
Got Bacardi and some bitches but no faders
And now you feel me and now you don’t
I don’t care, I lost my mind with my wallet
So I got no ideas, years of raising the bar and breaking in glass cheers
Who knew it’d be so stressful to be successful?
But now that I’m here, revenge is a dish best served cold
So use it as an F-U to those who test you

[Verse 2: Outasight]
I want a house in the hills, not worry bout bills, I want it all
I want the flyest clothes and the finest hoes, I want it all
Don’t care about greed, gimme what I need and so much more, I want it all
And you shoulda known better, oh you a go-getter, I go get it
Wanna be as big as Zeppelin but escalade to heaven forever
Kinda like infinity and beyond, I’m Buzz Lightyears ahead of 'em
They gas, I unleaded them, if they good, I’m better

Daytona, I want the fame and the fortune
The range and the Porsche and 34 ceilings in the penthouse apartment
To spend the fortune on clothes from Ralph Lauren
Oh, with the new girl, gee Dorsey
And who he involved with? You can check till you teeth
I mean I should be eating portraits on seas of San Champez
85 degrees and blue oceans where accents are green
The passion to see in life without a wall or a need
It’s like falling free, don’t it seem like everyone’s dream like your current dream?
Yeah, I can now see it in front of me, I won’t let what’s become of me
Become of me and get it all taken from me, at the snap of a finger
June turns December, the end of it and nobody can remember

And now everything that always glitters ain’t gold
You listen to hoes and all the sudden mimic the flow
Visions of dough and how you look exquisite in clothes you can’t afford
That ain’t the cause but you ripping these hoes, right?
You want the cover of GQ, centerfolds and seafood
Diddy got it, why not me? You can drive a Bentley, fly on private jets
And dive all night, now you wonder why you in debt
From models and poles, put models in shows
When I was in fold, you be the greatest famous marvel they know
Grace the stage, bouncing from state to state, no longer day to day
Living in graded space, no wonder, you got it major flossing
But in reality, there ain’t no major boss men
You living with your mama and your baby’s toilet
So why you fixated on the fame and fortune? Get a job nigga"

In three in the morning, it's time to cut
Sometimes she like it soft but not as much as she like it
When a nigga straight beat it up

What?
You heard me you dumb fuck, there's no coke
What the fuck do you mean there's no coke?
I've been up and down this ship
I've been in every fucking room
There's gotta be coke
There is nothing, nothing.""

Help PLEASE!

Help me!
*gunshot*

[Chorus: Masta Killa]
It's assassination day, I stalk

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
I move through the Third World, my third eye's the guiding light
Invite the fight, we all die tonight
The life I live's a 25 to life bid
Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive
Cream is short, Cee Cipher Power stalk, plus the fiend talk
3 Gs the cost in Supreme Court
White lies and blackmail land me back in jail
We're all for sale, a stolen goal but it fail
Stranded on the front line, I shine to the dumb and blind
It comes time I take back what was once mine
Crunch time in the first quarter, from the worst slaughter
Devil's poisoning the birth water
The earth daughter rest her head on my chest
Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest
While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blasting
Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened
Trapped in deep water, gasping
I clash with the titans for my half on the action
[Verse 2: RZA]
I stop producers careers, the weak spot was the ears
Scorpion darts hits the mark, pierce the heart with silver spears
You're bewildered, my unsaturated, low filtered
Devils still feel this so you're living built tilted
MCs upon their axis, their body hazard tactic
Lactic acid, desert dry cactus, practice
You can never match this invincible, Wu-Tang indispensable
One nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice
The mic is in my clutches
Thugs who bring ruckus leave in crutches
Unforgivable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel
Decapitates the head, makes the projects more livable
Interchangeable, caution: flammable
My chamber is 99 plus 1  unnameable angles
And strangles, microphone cords start to dangle
Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal
We creep through your doors
Seep out like sweat through the pores
Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
First of all before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon, don
Spread it out like Grey Poupon
Splurging, merging in the suburbs
Using this just like an adverb, action word, flowing like a blackbird
God came in, aiming like Terry Bradshaw
He hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God, his shit is smashed, Pa
You handle this just like algebra, UFO spot 'em like Galaga
Holding like bullet-proof Acuras
You so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high, yo, Bobby
You hear how I'm shooting it like they blue tops
No, you won't play me like your lady
Pay me 380, spit it at you like a baby, final destination, Hades
[Verse 4: Masta Killa]
War's extremely serious and it saddens me
To have to take things to deadly measures
And have you measured and shot for no pay
It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey
Tranqued by deceptional sounds that deceives
And lures MCs to the lair
With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed
Temptation tempts my victim to proceed
Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
You'd rather pursue death than admit defeat
Now who's best to describe for what I specialize in
Murderous rhyming, constantly inclining
My mind spits with an enormous kickback
Your brain then absorbs the impact
Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback

Tecca Nina'll reach her if I gotta double back to Eureka

Wait a minute I think this bitch is trying to kick a hole through my speakers
Get my gun then I open the trunk and said

From Swope Park, that's where I'm 'bout to go dart, let her know art
For the evil bitch and the brainless witch with no heart, it got so dark

[Interlude: Newswoman]
Police are still looking for 21 year old Crystal Nelson
Who has been missing since last Sunday
Friends and family told police that they thought this was
Yet another one of Crystal's weekend excursions
But after all this time, they're still worried sick

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
It's been fun momma, fed her my catalog like Adderall
Fucked up in the trunk with rump is how I had her y'all
In a ditch, walked back to the trunk, wicked is how I sounded
Whispered, ""Bet that you love Tech N9ne now, bitch""
(Threw her in the trunk!)

[Outro: Police officer]
I think I've found the missing Mercedes here in Swope Park-uh
In a ditch near shelter five
It's kinda appears the car is still running-uhm
Music playing, I'm approaching the car now
Let me turn down the music
(God damn [?])
I'ma go ahead pop the trunk
There's an African-American female [] been shot up and appears to be delirious
It could be the girl that's missing from last week
(Tech Tech Nine Nine Tech Tech Nine Nine)
(Tech Tech Nine Nine Tech Tech Nine Nine)
(Tech Tech Nine Nine Tech Tech Nine Nine)

Now if I give you all of me, what'chu gonna give me back?
Your body is calling me, got me feeling like a fiend on crack
Boy you gonna make me fall in love, now why you wanna go and do that?
Now if I give you all of me, tell me what'chu gon' give me back?

[Verse 1]
Let's start with the moon and the stars, whatever you into
The money I acquire, mama, make it all simple
Flashback '03, paparazzi flashing flicks
I moved away, hustle hard, now I got a sick stash
Tell me you miss me, baby come here and kiss me
Mwah - it just happened so quickly
Feels like I hopped off a bus and got in a Bentley
It's gangsta my music, even when it's the smooth shit
You can hate me cause I hurt you, but I ain't mean to do it
Em predicted it all, I don't know how he knew it
He said women from Hollywood, they liar-liar-liars
You fuck 'em they, get you heated, deny you like Mariah
Fast forward to '06, I'm still on fire
The world is still turning, my records are still earning
Dough come quicker and quicker, flow gets sicker and sicker
Straight up and down, baby, I'm a special kind of nigga
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Life is short, baby, be a part of my dreams
I own Ferrari horses, my Lamborghini leans
So mean, I have niggas hating on me
God gave me a gift, I'm supposed to be rich
I'm supposed to ride through the hood and make niggas sick
When my homies put in work, they supposed to get hit
With a piece of chain thick and go and buy 'em some bricks
I ain't make that up, this is how it's 'sposed to be kid
You should feel like a lifer that get back that time
When I smile your smile should be as big as mines
Girl to know me is to love me, I'm one of a kind
Even when you hate me you love me, forever you're mine

So I say, ""What up?"" (What up?)

Tryin' to find my way back home
So I say, ""What up?"" (What up?)
Just tryin' to keep my head up

[Verse 1: Alyssa Marie]
I know it's hard to imagine every bar that I’m rappin'
Is all the facts when y’all are acting like Jafar in Aladdin
You want the power, so you sacrifice your free will
I’m doing me still, I got an appetite to satisfy, to be real
If three meals for me'll mean you're starving, I'mma eat still
It's kill or be killed, and I may be walkin' up a steep hill
While everyone else is coastin', they never will gain or flex
All the muscle I'm building, trudging the hill, whatever terrain is next
I’ll be ready, and they gonna rest while I’m cruising
While the rest of them are snoozin', I'm on the move
Each second I’m gettin' I’m gonna be using
I guess time will prove it, they'll have to believe me
They’ll see that I’m happy to lead when those in back of me need it
You have to see it to believe it
I batter and beat every beat that I happen to rap on, in a manner of speakin'
I'm actually happy to be it, the rapper people expect to fail
You held your breath for what's better, well, I’m the best, exhale

[Verse 2: eNVy]
Well I be, rollin' up outta my bed and get to passin' up the time
Smokin a dub then rollin' another, just to crash and then rewind
Like, what? I don't know what's up nowadays
Really? Ya blame me for keepin' away? Man, the people are shady
So deep in the game and they leavin' their brain to go cheat with the fake
So I leave 'em to play, while I deal it as mean as an ace
But I feel a bit cleaner today, let's hit the scene for a drank
I feel like a million dollars with only fifty in pocket
Still I can cop a Twixer of vodka, just gimme a holler
(What up?) to all my folk in the B
From the coast of the V, we flowin it freely over the seas
You know what that means? Man I got the globe on its knees
Smilin' like a doughnut, y’all know its a cold slut
I'm foul and shit? Well, so what, only young once pal
So I'mma say ""Shut the fuck up, clown""
If I call ya phone and say ""What's up now?”
Better be knowin' the damn saying, ya ""must come down""

Stand up or get on the floor
It's on tonight, I know what you like
I know just how to break you off

[Verse 1]
Good evening ladies, I'll tell you from the start
I'm hoping you enjoy my amusement park
There's lots of activities, fun things to do
And I'll find my pleasure in pleasing you
Some rides go fast, some rides go slow
You fear heights when I'm high, hell yeah I'll go low
It tastes so sweet that sticky cotton candy
We get carried away, we be starting a family
It's a perfect time for a magic trick
Girl, you know it's no fun without the magic stick
Now watch me as I pull a rabbit out a hat
Then you can use the rabbit all over your cat
Applause now, that's the first half of my act
I started out a pimp, now I'm more like a mac
I don't need your paper, just don't fuck with my stacks

Explosions, Trojans, all in the hotel
Put me to the test, girl, I don't fail
I work it out without a doubt
There's plenty water rides, I'm sure to get you wet in the park
Have your lusting seductions considered an art
Throw a hoop around the bottle, I'll be your teddy bear
Whatever color you like, you know I don't care
I really wanna thank ya for attending this affair
Now go encourage your friends to come have fun here
I smile when I speak, but I'm being sincere
And your pass is valid all summer, my dear
So at your convenience you can always return
There's so many tricks to the trade you should learn
Suck that, lick that, swallow that lollipop
Forget that, grip that, ride it nonstop

It seems like everything I do, you're used to it
And I hate hearing stories 'bout who you've been with
That's when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside
So you still think I'm confident, and damn
Is this gonna last?
You're up on a pedestal, are we moving too fast?
Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I gotta ask

This here is something personal
I highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside
So I don't ever question you, and damn
I can't even find the perfect brush
So I can paint what's going through my mind
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind
That's why I gotta ask

Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new (Brand new), brand new (Brand new), brand new
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?

Late, late, late, late

Did he give you loving just like this?
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date?
Tell me baby, am I too late?

Creation  Destruction,Immortal Technique,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Yeah
Haha
Se ha cabado la mierda
Bout to drop a def' cut
Yo, yo, yo, huh

[Verse 1]
Immortal Technique disintegrates mics when I spit
I cause more casualties than sunken slave ships
Full to capacity, I bring tragedy to rap without my man Khadafi
The government took Nazi scientists from Germany
To design nuclear rockets and ways of observin' me
'Cause their pathetic attempts didn't work to murder me
When this country was conceived, these bastards never heard of me
But now I hold the souls of slave masters eternally
Bleedin' internally, burgundy during surgery, verbally
'Cause I'm a spirit to which devils are incompatible
I've been around since the planet was inhabitable
I spit in the ocean and created microscopic animals
Which evolved into two species, the righteous and the cannibals
But until then, I had alien women suck me off
When God said (""Let there be light"") I turned it the fuck off
And that's the reason Earth is only five-billion years old
I made the sun shine, and permitted time to unfold
The surface was lava, but when I stepped down, it became cold
Fuck what you've been told!
My spiritual form became a swarm of molecule sickness
Manifested liquid trapped inside a mountainous region
Until the sky started rainin', continuous seasons
Immortal Technique, at long last, reincarnated
Undebatably reinstated to leave you decapitated
Je suis fou, but my crazy words make sense
I'll split every pound in your body into six pence
I'm sick of simple similes about The Sixth Sense
I'll leave your body drenched in the blood from all your ancestors
You'll never be at peace, like the souls of child molesters
I'll cut you and bless your festerin' wounds with alcohol
Drown you in a clogged toilet, in a public bathroom stall
I'll rip you down, take a chunk of you home, like the Berlin Wall
This is the final call for all rappers that wanna brawl
Immortal Technique, the wrong motherfucker to diss
'Cause I allowed God to let you motherfuckers exist
[Bridge]
Hahahahaha yeah, real oh
We about to crash somethin' now, yo
Yo, yo, yo

[Verse 2]
I'm the stronghold on your neck that doesn't let you breathe
Stronger than the fake image of God in which you believe
More dangerous than your ignorant ass could ever perceive
A European virus mutated in Africa, overseas
Transported by mosquitoes and fleas to where you live
So lock yourself in your house with your wife and your kids
You're such a bitch, somebody probably made you out of a rib
My arrest record just scratches the surface of what I did
My bid locked me up and brought my life to an end
I was forgotten, abandoned by my bitches and friends
You don't want beef with people like me, so don't pretend
I'll resurrect your aborted baby and kill it again
You get no props in hip-hop like feminine men
I'm iller than any plague God gave Moses to send
You wanna make amends 'cause I'm the reason that the earth shakes
Buryin' your fam like Central American earthquakes

[Outro]

Lyrically damage ya

Top of the Food Chain,Immortal Technique,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Immortal Technique]
Immortal Technique, Poison Pen
We the top of the food chain motherfucker
Stronghold in it, yo
MC's are just figments of my imagination
They don't have to be dissed
I just stop thinkin about them
And they cease to exist
Don't get me pissed pussies

[Hook: Poison Pen]
Desolate easy Jesus, while they squeezin' heaters
You better, then please defeat us
Ladies is teacher squeezers, they pleased to meet us
Top of the food chain, still roll with bottom feeders
My tongue new in late modern English, I'm from the side with heaters
Always comment on your side as beepers
It ain't no joke, baby the bell is broke
Just holla out the window if you tryin to reach us

[Poison Pen]
Poison Pen for you ballers and bammers
Walk up in the spot, metal detectors went bananas
Stronghold, it's Bronx swingin', give me dap 'til my palm's stingin'
Grab your bitch and make a porn feature
Come out your mouth, that's a nice shirt to bleed on
They only use yo' ass to fuck and roll trees on
It's on, your block, your street
Niggas so puss and they don't speak, they queaf
When you run shit, Stronghold shit
I need a chain I can jump rope with
And Bed-Stuy got 'em, word I'm like Zeus without the eye problem
Some neck without the pearl spot, or it ain't rockin the most
Chicken spots, even if tots got they eyes on your necklace
My life is this flick, and y'all are extras
I double more blocks than Tetris, we perfectionists
And wouldn't have it, any other way, yeah
[Hook]

[Poison Pen]
Pen Pen nigga look good
My flow's a couple of retarded niggas too dumb
With an impact on hip-hop
Like LL walkin into Def Jam screaming out BOX

[Immortal Technique]
Immortal Technique, top of the food chain
I'll split your wife's head open, just to get me some brain
I spit venomous thing with Poison Pen
Destroy the sun and in eight minutes you'll never see day again
Pray for your friends but me and God'll just laugh at you
Tell you to shut the fuck up, and rain acid on you
Break down your molecules and spiritually damage you
Haven't you got the picture yet, motherfuckers like you
Are easy to disrespect, cause you're only a thug
When you on the internet you can't compare your dialect to Tech'
Because you lack the chromos'
I'm a Neo-Sapien, but y'all are still actin like homos

[Hook]

[Poison Pen]
If you talk {?} high, you get your mouth punched in
Stronghold is my house nigga, greasy apartment
My legions are foul, you eat he crapped out
Ain't never seen no trees in my mouth
Poison Pen magnitude eight-point-three
The hottest shit this side of the Gaza Strip
Alongside many gangs in rap arouses
That point and click without red browsers
Look out it's the 80's all over again it seems
Long hair, denim suits and big tanks, and glitz
We don't look for hoes so they scoop us
Tell your bitch to bring nothin to my crib but, pussy and a toothbrush
And a camcorder, y'all could all relate
They treat my nuts like imported grapes
That's how it is at the, top of the food chain
Poison Pen, Technique and - all y'all better take turns sleepin"
The Illest,Immortal Technique,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Jean Grae]
I burn my bridges with a blow torch
A rebel born from verbal holocaust
Dirty and never try to cleanse to get the drama off
Swiftest stealth assassin snipe you from balcony shots
A terrorist position, professional from the opera box
Rhyme documents infamous like the Bill of Rights
Illa tight, havin' niggas open like the thrill of dykes
Jean Grae, Yakuza mass murderer
Friends who got the dirt on her
Foes who never heard of her
Wild Style, my mouth bomb the train up
I spit Krylon in five colors, when I speak I spray my name up
Split your wig up like Denny Bruce
Splash your remains and brains out
On the street like Henny and juice
Noose your neck and loosen your spine from back
Shift your spleen, rip 'til it's just obscene
From downtown swingin' it, New York, illest who rip it
Ever, flow like a river, fuck your girl like a nigga, what
[Scratches]

[Verse 2: Pumpkinhead]
I've been through hell and back, scars swell on my back
I spit bars, y'all spit repetitive raps
I'm a street dude who decided to rhyme, with lines that'll crack the disc between your mind and your spine
That's why y'all wanna bite my design
And that's why usually I hold the mic like a 9
Pistol-whip you on the side of your eye, watch it pop out
We knock out cats and wipe the floors with their rocks out
Shocked now? Like you drivin' in a lightning storm
With the top down, we got this locked down
Like convicts on the run, gettin' shot down for phone time
We gainin' yards in the whole nine
See, me and Tech, we steadily building
And we about to blow like the Oklahoma Federal Building
And all them niggas get mad when we step in the building 'Cause we make the crowd jump
And hit they head on the ceiling, what

[Scratches]

[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]
I spit heat like the deserts of Saudi Arabia
Bury competition like Mesopotamia
Emanatin' radiation, pissin' liquid uranium
I bring the rock like European drunks in soccer stadiums
I'll split your cranium with perfect symmetry, lyrically
If you're not the illest, then you don't deserve to spit with me
OBS-obliterating bastards sacrilegiously
I sacrifice niggas who talk shit, ritualistically
Meticulously makin' all my rivals suicidal
Like white suburban kids on acid, readin' the Satanic Bible
My arrival is genocidal like Christopher Columbus
Exterminatin' races of wack MC's that walk among us
I've just begun to bust, I'll make this place open candela
These racist cops wanna lock me longer then Nelson Mandela
Pissed off, I'm makin' hella paper, East to West Coast
And I treat the law in this country like a motherfuckin' joke
'Cause if I'm willin' to smoke the President
While he's sniffin' his coke
You know it don't mean shit to me to cut a fuckin' cop's throat
[Outro: Immortal Technique]

{Sh, sh, sh, shit on the whole industry}"
Locked Up Freestyle,Immortal Technique,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Yo, you're not as cold as me, motherfucker, stop pretendin'!
I'll murder you in front of your crib like John Lennon
Rip the tendons out of your muscle to cut the tension
I'm beyond your comprehension
Like related subatomic particles and fifth dimensions
Suspension in your breathin' is what I'm leavin'
'Til a legion of demons whisper the meaning of life in your ear
Right before they make your motherfuckin' life disappear
But just 'cause you hear the multi-syllabic grammatical
Don't compare me to rappers that are on sabbatical
'Cause I never did business in Little fuckin' Italy
I play checkers on triple-decker tour buses in Tripoli
The way that you typically bicker with me inexplicably
Is a mystery that pisses me off ridiculously
Because I'm lyrically beyond your level scientifically
Specifically spittin' out the spic in me prolifically
I'm the majority of America futuristically
After I die, fuck my music, you'll feel me spiritually
Darker than Sicily rippin' above the averages
You hold no weight, like bitches after miscarriages
And your label produces no kids, like gay marriages
I'm disparagin' every fake thug rapper in sight
That's why your faggot-ass will never make it into the light
I'll crack your skull when I smash your face into the mic
And now you know what I'm like
I'll Suge Knight the industry
I feel like the spirit of Nat Turner got into me
You're infinitely hopeless
You sound like shit when you spit live, like Jennifer Lopez
I'll massacre a rich rapper and all his broke friends
And go to Club Cheetah, rockin' some blood-soaked Tims
Party-crashin', animal-fuckin' model bitches
Leavin' their stick-figure anorexic pussy in stitches
My verbal blitzes have outshined your offense
You're watered-down nonsense, and I'm two-hundred proof
Chokin' the local youth in this home-made vocal booth
You're a fuckin' incompetent killer like Rae Carruth
And I'm Technique, the rawest nigga ever produced
I spit nastier than regurgitatin' period juice
So burn your fuckin' rhyme book
Stay warm, and put it to good use
I'm about to drop like frozen airplane shit through your roof
And I'm sick of fake hustlers tellin' lies to the youth
You never robbed Dominicans
And you couldn't sling rocks if you was Palestinian
You broke motherfucker, you cats don't burn rubber
You niggas can't even get a fuckin' cab like Danny Glover
You ain't hardcore, I'll smack the shit out of your mother
You wanna be gutter? I'll leave you laid out in the street
Signed yours truly, the motherfuckin' Immortal Technique"

They're just as good as dead""
Jedi Mind Tricks, Canibus
Let mee do it like this y'all

[Verse 1: Canibus]
I grab mics, bust the raw, take flight, adjust the yaw
I break your bicuspids with your own jaw
Metaphors started menopause in your moms before you were born
Technically you don't even exist, god
A flick of the wrist and you gone
Lost in limbo like pink shit camouflaged in a pig farm
I'm an enigma I rip bars, a burning star with 5 points
Plus the mic I ripped thus far
I start from your forehead, peel the top of your fucking face off like an orange then eat the carnage
My God that sounds horrid
Eating MC's is like eating garbage, they make me vomit
Discombobulate prostates, re-hydrate dry lakes
Wipe Ammonium Nitrate across the side of ya face
Anthropomorphologically speaking, I'm out of your league
Who can match the bottom of my top speed?
Scourge of the earth, verses immersed in the dirt
Heart monitors flat line due to data read error
Sentences go through re-synthesis
I leave em looking bleaker than Memphis is without Roc-A-Fella membership
Don't be an optimist and try to rock with Bis
You end up in an iced-out sarcophagus
[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
Every rapper better fear me, 'cuz Vinnie Paz is a beast
And y'all steady screaming for war but want peace
You trying to walk through the fog with sun leaks
You trying to walk two dogs with one leash
You can't overstand the mathematics
How I rip bars, walk through walls, perform magic
Tibetan Black Magic, I'm a warlord
Ill stab you through your fucking temple with a floorboard
I'm a born lord, I was baptized
To see the universal through a cats eyes
Here come the black skies, it's all darkness
I breathe life into Jesus Christ's carcass

""Have you ever heard the sound of bones splitting""

""End you with the murderous medley""

[Verse 3: Canibus]
As I duct tape ya to the front of a Mack Truck's fascia
Drive through a brick wall, pull the parking brake up
Ask you for you proof of registration, say what?
I can't understand a word you saying, you fuck
Peel you off till you drop on the floor, drag you to the manifold
Make you put your mouth around the exhaust
Squeeze your neck harder when you start to cough
I bet you never thought this could happen just for pissing me off
I'm in for hardcore Hip Hop, the surrogate father
Protecting Rap like the exoskeleton of a Lobster
I'll moonwalk on water, harpoon jackers
And drag em back to the harbor for the local photographers
Now point four fingers and watch through binoculars
Look at what Harry Potter did to Andrew Galotti, kid
Bitter enemies exchange negative energy
But you can't forgive and forget with an elephant memory
Cause You-Know-Who snatched the mic from You-Know-Who
But lets keep that between me and you!
Me and JMT, Rippers that'll rip your ass
I got an empty mag, get em Vinnie Paz
[Verse 4: Vinnie Paz]
I get a bloodlust when I see a slug bust
Hit your mug with a .38 snub and watch the blood rush
Nothings above us, ya'll better back off
Cos you a devil like the Canaanite in Sackcloth
We busting Gats off, it's a clean kill
It doesn't seem real when your spleen spill
So listen to what I'm spitting at y'all
La illaha, il Allah il Allah
Come on y'all, your getting hit in the chest
Cause Vinnie Pazienza and Canibus is the best
Ripping the rest and all y'all seek is ashes
I love reading Qu'ran in pitch blackness
I love reading the psalms to bitch actors
I love reading the palms of bitch rappers

To blow a nigga up, with my Five Fingers of Death

If he frontin, on any man down with the Clan

For my brother, I even kill a Pope, word to mother
Serial, killa, style from the Isle of Stat

Shit's gettin deep in here, I mean like thick
Niggas lookin all in my face like they want dick

Because they got the finga on the trigga of a biscuit
They don't know I'm wicked, when I start to kick it
With the raw sound, wash it down with a Mystic
Better yet a Snapple, nigga want the juice
But he don't want the hassle
Thought they trying to overthrow the castle
Better yet the temple, I'm comin to your town
Black down, the rental, car, the pistol

Not sayin Ason, is like a duck of disco
Or a disco duck, I'm strictly hip hop
Yo, Ason, what's up? I can't stop...
Wu-Tanging, flipping the script and
You could test my skills, but niggas must be trippin
Coked up from sniffin, you're the one who's riffin
I'm not Opie, save that old shit for Andy Griffith
You start to flip, now ya slip, cuz you're slippin
While you sleep I be the God on point, like Scottie Pippen
As I, jump on stage, cold flip a rip a show
Strip or rip a ho, ready like Bo
Jackson while I'm still taxin, I'm maxin
Relaxin, sittin backs and, laying tracks and
Again and again when I rock this jam
I wanna see 'em up in the air, throw up your hand
Introducin, the one-man band
A child that's wild, now with the style, couldn't stand
Niggas wanna jump, then stepped, to the center
Of the rhyme inventor, MC tormentor
You get jacked and slapped, across the MC map
I laugh at ya ass, on a horse shack
Come on through I black and blue your whole crew

But somebody needs to be a little concerned about me, it's like I'm standing on the edge of a high tower balcony
Ya'll are rootin me to jump, nobody stoppin me
It's like a drug filled rock n roll documentary
Just wait till the world knows what's inside of me
Cause you ll be sorry when I'm gone, and I'll be gone so very soon
If the pressure on my diaphragm keeps resisting
If the feds keep my brothers stompin up and down prisons
If you can't understand my offerings and deep mission
No label is willing to see my unique vision
If metro housing keep threatning my poor mother with eviction
You'll be sorry, (you'll be sorry)
You'll be sorry if I stay so poor I can't afford my own medicine to cure my ulcer
And get vexed at every rich person that walks passed, that won't blast, just yet I don't even have enough gas to pass the exit, so don't laugh, (don't laugh) I think a smile is a charity, but fuck don't laught my anger, (resulted) from pressure, (exhaustion) my boys be (orphans), my voices, (is all bent), I'm tired (I'm coughing) my daddies, (divorcin), my momma (is hopin), my eyes be (so open), for chances, (I'm walkin), I'm walkin an

It's just about your ability, but see it's like an enigma
An insomniac singer, a dream a figment of your imagination it seems
It'll never be succesful, please protect your neck before they squeeze
I'm your biggest hater you suck, and even if you don't
You know your luck you'll probably get runover by a truck before your first label meeting
Meeting is the issue you prick, yo yo you really make me sick, no no you make me sick
I can't stand this argument, see this is what happens when my mind starts to dwell
And my strenght starts to fail
And I get an anxiety (resulted) in panic attacks (exhaustion)

Look at it, your better off, (without me), I mean even I (doubt me)

Lullaby your stupid ass, ROCKABYE BABY
The Funkadelic Devil hit your ass with a level from the new school
And still holdin' my jewels!

How Ya Like Me Now,Kool Moe Dee,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","""All aboard for the night train""

[Verse 1]
I throw my tape on then, I watch ya
Three seconds later, I got ya
Shakin' your head, dancin' instead of sittin'
The rhymes kick, the beats hittin' you
Just like a home run, slammin' like a slam dunk
Riding the wave that James Brown gave funk
It happened to James like it happened to me
How you think I feel to see another MC get paid
Usin' my rap style
And I'm playin' the background meanwhile
I ain't with that, you can't forget that
You took my style, I'm takin' it back
Comin' back, like ""Return of the Jedi""
Sucker MC's in the place that said I
Could only rock rhymes and only rock crowds
But never rock records, how ya like me now?

[Chorus]
How ya like me now?
How ya like me now?
[Verse 2]
Now brothers are riding me like a pony
I'm no phony, I'm the only real mic-aroni
Playin' the mic like it's supposed to be played
New jacks, you all shoulda stayed
Out of the business, what is this
Amateur night at the Apollo?
Get off this stage, I'm in a rage
I'm like a lion that's been trapped inside a cage
I'm the real king, rap is a jungle
I never understood, how could one go
To a party, watch me, stand around and jock me
Become a rapper, then try to rock me
Schemin' like a demon, you're screamin' and dreamin'
I'm from the old school, I used to see men
Die for less, but I'm not living that way
I'll let my mic do the talkin'
And let the music play

[Chorus]
How ya like me now?

[Verse 3]
Rap is an art and I'm like Picasso
But of course, why else would you try so
Hard to paint a picture, and try to get ya
Self in my shoes, but they won't fit ya
I'm bigger and better, forget about deffer
Every time I rocked the mic, I left a
Stain in your brain that will remain
Stuck in the back of your brain till you see me
Again, respect, I come correct
The rhymes I select are nothing short of perfect
Vernacular's pure and I can ensure
Life or death with my breath, my voice is a cure
I heal life from the words I spread
I'll make a sick man rock on his death bed
Sucker MC's, I'll make your girl say, ""Ow""
And she's jockin', now how ya like me now?
[Chorus]
How ya like me now?
How ya like me now?

[Verse 4]
It irked my nerve when I heard
A sucker rapper that I know I'll serve
Run around town sayin' he is the best
Is that a test? I'm not impressed
Get real, you're nothing but a toy
Don't ya know that I'll serve that boy?
Just like a waiter, hit 'em with a plate of
These fresh rhymes and
Make sure that he pay the bill
And leave him standin' still
When he's had enough, hit him with a refill
And for dessert it won't be no ice cream
I'm just gonna shatter and splatter his pipe dreams
Make him feel the wrath, beat him down, and laugh
And when I finish, then I'm gonna ask him
""Who is the best?"" And if he don't say, ""Moe Dee""
I'll take my whip and make him call himself Toby
Whip him good, then I'll make him sweat
Always talkin' about battles and never had a battle yet
But if we ever did, how could you beat me?
You're so petrified, you're scared to even meet me
My word's the law, that's why you don't beef
You're nothing but a punk, track star, and a thief
So I'm puttin' you on punishment, just like a child
Never touch another mic, how ya like me now?
[Chorus]
How ya like me now?

[Verse 5]
I could continue, there's more on the menu
But I'll relax 'cause I'm so far in you
You had enough, I know you're overstuffed
And if I keep going, you'll be throwin' up
Old rhymes I used to say way back in the day
When you used to come to my parties and pay
Nobody's ever gonna rock me and this I vow
So all I wanna say is how ya like me now?

[Chorus]
How ya like me now?
How ya like me now?
How ya like me now?"

Yea I'm up in the range rover, Parked like Yosemite
Blow like a champ, dog. Smokin' like a chimney

Haters don't matter, Bitches drink my energy
I'm fitted in the front, I Cat Daddy
Then come up swing my arms, Cat Daddy
Baby I'm thuggin'
Every weekend I'm clubin'

Green on me, every day St. Patricks
Ever since the day I was born I been a star, Patrick

You can smell the residue and the fumes from next door
Ouh, turf superstar, microwaves and pickle jars
Portable digital scales, custom-painted muscle cars
Pimpin', where the razor blade? Use a safety pin
""What they goin fo'?"" Nigga what you trying to spend?
When it's a drought, I just sit on my dope and wait
For the prices to skyrocket and rise like real estate

Well, down in the Dirty, South, to be exact
Gettin money with white girls is a well-known fact
I like 'em black, brown, Puerto Rican, or Asian
But nothing bring the bread back like a Caucasian
Whether, winter or fall, summer or spring
A white girl's always down for doing the damn thing (Fo' sho')
Put her on the highway, she ain't no punk
Got a white girl drivin with white girls in the trunk (Hol' up)
I ain't lying, it's the best thing going
When my white girl's around, it's always snowing
Momma can't stand her, telling me to switch
Sayin I'ma go to jail fucking with that white bitch (No shit)
Always around to keep me paid
With some white girls on my team, I got it made

I keep a silk broad when I'm fucking with the hard
'Cause they never get stopped by the motherfucking cops
Bootch look hard but this bitch is a fraud
Don't like to see me ball, want me to go rock-for-rock
Move around, bitch, you need to get out the way
I keep a young Suzy when it's time to move 'yay
You need to learn the game before you try to play
'Cause like Cal-Gon, them laws will take you away
So I keep me a snow bunny, riding in the front
With a triple zillion head and a platinum cunt

One, two, one, two, the High Chief
Yeah... yo... so alone... baby

[Pre-Verse: Inspectah Deck]
I'm just lookin' out of the window
Watchin' the gunshots blow-ow
Thinkin' how we all was turnin' out
Keepin' my head above water
Got to make a weight when I can (cuz I can)

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
Temporary lay off, cop pay offs, daily rip offs
Informer tip off, clips lick off
The judge got hit off, boss got knocked off
Worker made a come off, cash got dropped off
Buildings got burnt out, sisters got turned out
Work out of the yard up North, tryna burst out
Pissy elevators, dirty cop favors
Tongues hiding razors, minors turn majors
Wave the bigger tools, shootout inside the school yard
The game ain't' changed, niggas done made their own rules
They buildin' plans, let's pull a million dollar scam
Watch for taped conversations, Jakes and dollar vans
The black market, labelled the movin' target
Dwellin' in the heartless projects
Evil eyes hawkin', the BBS rims flossin'
The beat walk in, harassin' the street walkin'
They keep talkin', like the Rebel might slow up
They set me up to go up, the witness didn't show up
[Pre-Verse: Masta Killa]
They got their drugs on em (slippin')
Bare approach the look out

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
Be off the block by ten, the kite was sent
Then all those who dare to oppose were sent back
Chained to the train track, protect ya jaw
These silverback niggas eat their oatmeal raw
Cee Allah sawed the shotti, 'Preme went down for a body
He killed Poppy, dusted in the lobby
Toxy off shocky, cops be harassin'
Tryna stop cashin', the episodes pass
I flash back to guns and crack stashed in grass
You movin' savage, please warn him of his ways and action before I blast him
Then the homicide was justified when I arrive
Black tints on the glass with the stockin' cap mask
It's all official, steel pistol style whip you to the gristle
While my team be stompin' you out after the whistle

[Verse 3: GZA]
I went from the slums of Hell to paradise in Heaven
From a slingshot to a wall of Mac-11's
I drank with the Devil and ate with the Reverend
We talked numbers and I told 'em that mine was 7
The total amount of hits behind the collapsed building
That had exploded in a frenzy of killings
Bodies lay near tons of twisted metal
Of a structure and atomic force, it leveled
From the tale of the tape, the product failed in comparison
The weight, the height, the reach was not a year within
Sight, the significant, difference was the ammo
Wrecking y'all individuals in the nano
Second by second, heat blazed through the night
Leaving a dazzling array of neon lights
The primary reason of mission for them spitting
The fire that kept hitting them ducks that kept sitting
But the informants x-rays gave off electrons
Within a few next days, entire sets gone
Clinical precision's used to remove the eyelids
Those responsible for my brothers with high bids
Life in the hood is an award winning film
Lived out by savages who can't escape the realm
A place where the young meet and greet with guns
In the park they interrupt the pure innocent fun"

I’m jumpin' off the ledge with my arms out
I’m not scared of the drop, know what I’m talkin' about?
See me in the air and pledge allegiance
These legends lookin' at me like thank you Jesus
Off co-signs and loans, I could find a home
J. League made a crown and designed a throne
We both up-and-comers but y’all sleepin' in musician shit
My first album gonna be some real musician shit
Benny and the Jets, y’all still in 16’s
Y’all ain’t ready for me yet, I'mma do a 32 with a 20 bar intro Check your parents’ vinyls, find out what I’m into
I refuse to chuck and job, I refuse to minstrel
Got nothin' to be heated 'bout, let me keep it simple
People wonderin' if I’m that bad on the mic
You wanna know? Go and ask Khalil, Cannon and Knight
And then go and pour a little Moward for these dead poets
I got these critics ravin', I Edgar Allen Poe it
There some things that money can’t buy
Not a guest in your ear but respect from your peers
And I’m standin' on the start of somethin' great
So if you think I don’t deserve the fortune, come debate
And tell me how your man got a tape
And his flow is the best you’ve seen
It keep you high like it get you green

Just wait until my next two things
I got to do it with a legend and my picture in a mag
Soon as you make comparisons, I switch it on your ass
Who I sound like today? Eenie-meanie-minee-mo
I got presents like X-Mas, I’m the shit, Heidi ho
I don’t know any living human being breathin' oxygen
And put it on the line and have his shine be a constant thing
Because my money on my mind
And these shawties wanna back it up
Because I’m on my grind, when inspiration hit me
I'm get rich or die tryin' 50
I been dope since I was writin' squigglies
I couldn't form a sentence, was never on my period
Always was told stop but I was never hearin' it
I tuned ‘em out, kept writing so severe
Kinda like a yacht, too pricy for my peers
I made ‘em all believers through radio receivers
My skill was never ever debated on my features
I'mma sure bet ‘cause one line did ‘em all
Rest in peace Punisher, my one mic settle scores
Bars like javelins, criticize never more
Opportunity’s hammerin', think I need to get the door
'Cause y’all Batman and I’m Rorschach
When Laws on, think Paul and John four track
The kid’s got variety like all that
Sicker than a bald cat, overgrown ball cap
Hospital gown, get well soon balloons
But on a lighter note like the room’s gettin' smaller
Maybe I’m gettin' bigger, took over the net in two months
How you figure? Got these other spitters barely hangin' on
Like the clothes of a wigger
And my live show crowd's throwin' bows in the center
I’m callin' up my mother, she knows her son is a winner
Tellin' me to change the world but be home for your dinner
And rap was my lady but she would never take it slow
Well now she needs savin', well I ain't Captain Save A Hoe

He said trip Dogg, ya better get right, Crip right
Eyes open cause niggas get stuck on seez-ight
It ain't no motherfuckin' problem - pop-pop, tick-tock
Never flip-flop, 20 crippin' til I drop
[Hook]
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
Su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
Su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop
Ca-rip

[Verse 2: The Game]
Is I, in the motherfuckin' S-5
With the red bandana double knotted 'round the rearview
Niggas see clear through, they know that it's Game
Cherry red Lowenhart's let 'em know that I bang
So bang, like Snoop in ""Deep Cover""
I got the seat reclined, fo-five under the white-T, smothered
Dippin' down Green Leaf, I ain't got no enemies
Been shot five times, now I bleed Hennessy
And bang for my niggas locked up, they can't stop us
It ain't a gangsta party 'til we go and dig Pac up
I'm Dr. Martin Luther King with two guns on
Hughey P. Newton with Air Force One's on
I gangbang but I'm the opposite of Tookie Williams
Red Lambo', red bandana print ceilin'
Me and Snoop got the West Coast locked
Red and blue rag tied in a knot
With all my motherfuckin' homies yellin' out
[Hook]
Su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
Su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
Ca-rip

[Verse 3: The Game]
I ran outta gas in Long Beach, I'm stuck
Ain't no Bloods and all I see is blue Chuck's
Hopped out the '6-trey, nowhere to go
Til' Snoop pulled up in that Pittsburgh Steeler '6-4
We just dippin', one Bloodin' one Crippin'
I'm on that Bulls shit, throwback Scott' Pippen
Moral is, my bandana hangin' from the left side
So if you ain't a Crip or a Blood, just throw up Westside

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
(What up Blood?) Yeah cuz, we just tippin'
Me and Game doin' thangs, switchin' lanes, Hurricanes on my feet
Stop, and C-Walk to the beat
Game, take the wheel and turn on 21st Street
Eastside LBC, gun in my hand
It's the turf by the surf but we don't play in the sand
We just - slip and slide out, we rip and ride out
Let it C known, nigga welcome to the Thunderdome

I Get It In,King Los,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Los]
Okay, I'm serving these niggas like a waiter with a tray
Tell me how the fuck you want it ’cause I'm catering today
Big diamonds in my bezel, hit them haters in the face
Never run behind pussy, it's the paper that I chase
I done lapped these niggas, I done made enough space
To take a nap on niggas, catch ‘em later in the race
Hot like Hell, tell Satan to his face
And I'm cutting these bitches like Jason when he chase
White girls on the movie, white girls so groovy
White pearl Cousys like oyster shells
Hoist a perpetual Rollie ‘cause your holder be moist as hell
Too cool to raise my voice and yell
Whisper in your bitches ear like Abracadabra
My swagger grab her, then she disappear
This my year, two-oh-one-oh, I owe one to the four-one-oh
Go for the goal, go for it like two seconds left on fourth and goal
I'm scorching cold, freezing hot, my temperature rise, degrees'll drop
It's odd to have an even shot, when sleeping, I don't even stop
Big L, Biggie, Pun, even Pac would agree to me angry at these
Lazy A and Rists, I'm so crazy, they embarrass me
With all this fucking foolery, who can't rap about jewelry, cars and bitches?
But y'all ridiculous, is rappers as cool as me?
You losing me, come find me, I'm a genius, bitch, rewind me
Every day my fans remind me, there's no way they can deny me
God damn, how that dagger feel? Like G.5 then the Swaggerville
I'm like eight miles ahead of rappers, feeling like B. Rabbit feel
Yo, hold up, wait, he had a deal, who said he cannot get a deal?
That shit was only half a mill, it's time I need a bigger deal
Hit the store, ship a mill, treat the coupe like Uncle Phil
Because it's getting sick of wheels, Zero is the shit for real"
History,Yasiin Bey,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Kweli say, ""Everybody act according to the season that they born in""
Some are the night, some are the morning, some at noon
Some in winter, some in June
It's our code, it's the natural
The science is a jewel
For me and mines, yours and you
Let's move, tell you a little bit about mine, yo

[Verse 1]
I was born in a season where the world was quiet and cold
Celebrations were going on
Some were happy, some were sad
Some felt bad from being good
Some felt good from being bad, feelings pass and change
But they never leave, they here to stay
Holiday, holiday, happy birthday
Teenage love, the first cut run deep
Soul on flesh, this is the Brooklyn streets
Year of the Ox, seven and three
M.D., the history (come on)
Every soul got one of these (yes)
It's where you been and where you be
And without understanding you cannot proceed
Complete, the start and the end
Then it just go round again
[Hook]
Again and again, brand new
Again and again, so fresh
Again and again, newness

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
I was born in the decade of decadence where they worshipped what they have
Ford was president, do the math
The war was ended when the North Vietnamese stormed the city of Saigon
We was like, bye; we was gone, let bygones be bygones
I'm gone, spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
Where they hug you with the firearm, try it on
Like new school clothes, Black Star official
Smash when we do a show, it's facts, no mystery
I'm down with the crew like Mussolini in Italy
I rock with the Roots like the Giving Tree
Powerful, bigotry at work, me and my people got history
These rappers dumb it down considerably
We get it poppin' like a hit chorus
The flow is historic, they can't get rid of us
Ubiquitous, and we lay the law like Leviticus
Ten years ago we made history so they missing us

[Outro]
And don't call it comeback in particular
We will never blend into ephemera or
Fade into peripheral, transition of the minister's original
We're broadcast clear without diminishing
Black Star so tight, burning soul temperatures and ministers
Alkalines, aminos and minerals essentials
Served over Dilla time signatures
It's miracle material, remember it's right now foreverness"

We 'bout to start a epidemic with this one
Y'all know what this is (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
So So Def

[Verse 1: Nelly & Brandi Williams]
Got thirty down at the bottom, thirty more at the top (Uh-huh)
All invisible set in little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white rose, traditional gold
I'm changin' grills every day, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (Oh) in my white tee (Oh)
Or on South Beach (Oh) in my wife beat'
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see, my grandmama hate it, but my lil' mama love it
'Cause when I...
Open up your mouth, your grill gleaming (Say what?)
Eyes stay low from the chiefing (Chiefing)
I got a grill I call penny candy, you know what that mean?
It look like Now and Laters, gumdrops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave you for nothing, only a crazy man would
So if you catch me in your city, somewhere out in your hood
Just say...

I got the diamonds and the ice all hand set
I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath (Already)
My teeth gleaming like I'm chewing on aluminum foil
Smiling, showing off my diamonds, sippin' on some potent oil (Baby)
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
Twenty carats, thirty stacks, let 'em know I'm so for real (For real)
My motivation is them 30 pointers, VVS
The frontage in my mouthpiece simply symbolize success (That's right)
I got the wristwear and neckwear that's captivating (What?)
But it's my smile that got these onlookers spectating (Hah)
My mouthpiece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad (Come on, man)
My teeth are mind-blowing, giving everybody chills

Lights gon' hit and make you woozy in your head (Hey)
You can catch me in my Too $hort drop
Mouth got colors like a Fruit Loop box
It's what it do, in the Lou', ice grill, country grammar
Where the hustlers move bricks and the gangsters bang hammers
Where I got 'em, you can spot 'em on the top and the bottom
Got a bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham
I ain't dissin' nobody, but let's bring it to the light
Gipp was the first with my mouth bright white (That's right)
These hoes can't focus 'cause they eyesight blurry
Tippin' on some 4's, you can see my mouth jewelry
I got four different sets, it's a fabulous thang
One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain
And the other set the same, got my name in the mold

Dre, I see dead people
Modern vampires of the city
Hunting blood
Blood
Blood
Yo, Dre
Thought I was dead
West Coast
(One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood)

[Verse 1: The Game]
I'm the Doctor's Advocate, nigga, Dre shot you
Brought me back from the dead
That's why they call him the Doctor
The 'Math gon' drop him
And 50 ain't rocking with him no more
It's okay! I get it popping
Whole club rocking, like a six-four Impala
Drink Cris', throw it up, call the shit hydraulics
Then piss in the cup, call the shit Hpnotiq (Brrrrat!)
I bleed Compton, spit crack and shit chronic
And you new niggas ain't shit but new niggas
Bathing Ape-shoe niggas, I'm talking to you, niggas
Bouncing in the six-four, throwing up Westside, man
Sell another five million albums? Yes, I am
Fresh like ""Damn, this nigga did it again
A hundred thousand on his neck, L.A. above the brim""
Inside the Lambo shotgun with Snoop
What would the motherfuckin' West Coast be without one Crip and—
[Chorus: Junior Reid]
One blood
One blood
One blood
One blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood-blood-blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood-blood-blood

One blood

[Verse 2: The Game]
I'm from the Westside of the six-four Impala
Where niggas say ""Where you from?"" We don't never say ""Harlem""
Bandanna on the right side, gun on the left side
Niggas in New York know how to throw up the Westside
Word to Eazy, I'm so ill, believe me
I made room for Jeezy
But the rest of you niggas better be glad you breathing
All I need is one reason
I'm the king, and Dre said it: The West Coast need me
I don't know why you niggas keep trying me
Everybody know that I'm the heir to the Aftermath dynasty
And I ain't gotta make shit for the club
What DJ gon' turn down the thirty-eight snub?
You 38 and you still rapping? Ughhh
I'm 26, nigga, so is the dubs
On the '0-7 Hummer, hop out, no bodyguards
When the chronic smoke clear, all you gon' see is—
[Chorus: Junior Reid]
One blood
One blood
One blood
One blood

Blood, blood, blood, blood-blood-blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood-blood-blood
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood
One blood

[Verse 3: The Game]
I ain't got beef with 50, no beef with Jay
What's beef when you getting head in the six-trey?
And the double Game chain, I keep 'em on display
Black T-shirt, so all you see is the A
Turn on the TV, and all you see is the A
You niggas better make up a dance and try to get radio play
Keep on snapping your fingers, I ain't going away
I don't regret what I spit, 'cause I know what I say
And niggas talking about me, they don't know when to stop
I got the Louis Vuitton belt buckle holding the Glock
No beam, no silencer; I know when to pop
Wait 'til Lil Jon come on and let off a shot
I had the number-one Billboard spot
Niggas stepped on my fingers, and I climb right back to the top
I'm B.I.G., I'm Cube, I'm Nas, I'm Pac
This ain't shit but a warning 'til my album drop

One blood
One blood
One blood

Long time coming
Listen!

[Verse 1]
I think they want the new P.E. now
Ice Cube, Nigga With An Attitude now
They want a dude who's immune to the rules
Short fuse, aiming at Q, Bishop on the roof now
They want me to say; Fuck who in the game
If you the best rapper alive, then Reks insane
I think Preme's insane, best producer alive
Me up on his track is like needles to the veins
Like burners to the brain, suicide chess, playing suicide king
My aim when I came was to bring back the Gang Starr audio reign
No longer R-E-K-S, it's R-E-Cocaine

Rock-a-bye, pop rapper to sleep, heavenly conscious
Melodies monstrous, R's one hell of an artist
Syllable dart smith, lyrical bars pimp caution
Beware of close proximity cause conflicts
Even through all this garbage nonsense, media sponsors
I'm gonna spit the raw shit regardless
My thoughts in cockpits, steering passengers through the darkness
While nerds be writing blurbs in office
I am return of the legendary, duck through the cemetery
Soul of the GOATs in my bones, so I never worry
UHH, I think they want the new Makaveli
I can really feel the pains and the strains to my belly
Hunger gettin' deadly, ain't a killer, don't tempt me
Fill the booth 'cause the youth mental fridge on empty
Opinion on my rap, the flow's ether, the soulseeker
Born leader, R-E-K-S, remember the name

Yeah, I think I wanna kill Bill O'Reilly
187 G-Dub, peel wheels on Denalis
Mommy, I'm sorry, but when these dudes rap
I be thinkin' that I should pull a Shyne in the party
Nickel nine in the audience of weak rap shows
I never needed guns, but as my stress grows
Need that East swag back, a new West Coast
80 percent of the new South rap shit blows
Now the Midwest shinin', respect their grindin'
But turn up my face to bullshit rap whinin'
UHH, say goodnight to the industry, DJ Premier sentenced me
To prepare something lethal for the ears
Here it is for the people, compare me to no other artist
I swear no equals, I hear their public opinion

You gone take them 5? Or you gon' take them to the trial?
And go get denied?
By that probation and you just got, caught with that fry
That alibi ain't gone work
Ain't it somethin' how them niggas from out that three be doin' that dirt?
Score a quarter from oh-oh, rock it up by four-four
Then you can go in them hallways and smoke that fire all day

Tonight is the night that we ride
Thirty camouflage hummers with niggas inside
With choppers, doin', surgery on bodies like head doctors
Be quiet, 'cause they mad tonight, we gon' act a ass tonight

Niggas who know me good in my hood call me a dumb out

Can't tell that this a hit until the MAC-10 blow
I got 32 shots, I ain't got to aim
I'll wave this bitch in your direction mayne (Ha-ha)
Beams, clips, and grips, it's a sticky situation (Yeah)
Adrenaline rush, I squeeze, my heart start pacing

Same Glock, same block, same chain, same watch
Same six-four drop, same nigga on top

Well they say that birds do it, bees do it. [do it]
Time to freak, Money B gets to it
Not a heavyweight, but I go twelve rounds
With a jab and a stick, I'm goin' lick for lick, so
Give me the helmet, I'll be the stunt man
Just relax, and I won't front
Like Anita, I'm givin' you the best that I've got
And I'll be takin' it slow, never missin' a spot
Yes, caressing your back we're chest to chest she's kissing on my freckles
I nibbled around your ears before I suck upon your neck
'Oh Money B,' yeah, that's what you'll be screamin' and creamin'
But it's not a wet dream, it's the real
The freaky dog, dark nasty, never lettin' a kitty-cat get past me

Takin' it on home and pleasin' it

Nobody else is seein'
And the freak that you're wit' is in front of you
Bendin' over naked, and she's leanin' on the dresser [Ooh yeah]
You're lookin' at her from the rear [Yeah]
She looks just like Vanessa [The right stuff]
Uh uh, not Vanessa with the singing career
But the X-rated video queen
Know what I mean? [Uh huh] A'ight, here's the scene:
You're lying on you're back with your head on the edge of the bed
The booty's two feet from your head:
Should you: A, take the time to find a condom
B, you walk right over and you pound 'em
C, tell her that you want her love
Well the answer is D, [D], all of the above
So you're freakin' [freakin'], the furniture's squeakin' [squeakin']
She's tweakin', sayin' that she's weak in the knees
Cheek to cheek, and pound for pound
You're taxin' it and waxin' it and workin' it around
'Til the booty starts makin' that clappin' sound
Which is cool, but your friends are chillin' in the other room
The clappin's getting louder, you don't want them to clown you
In this situation, what do you do: [What?]
A, you, plain and simply, back up off her
B, you hit it just a little bit softer
C, you take it out and put it in het butt
Well, D is what I do, so, yo, listen up:
I put a towel on the floor by the two inch gap under the door
Now they can't see me any more
Check the locks so they can't clock, but they can listen
There'll be no bargin' in and there'll be no dissin' [Dissin']
Gettin' back to my mission, break out the whipped cream and the cherries
Then I go through all the fly positions:
My head under her leg under my arm under her toe
She says, 'I like it when you scream, baby let yourself go.'
I hit it and split it, lick it and quit it
After the ride, put my clothes on and walk outside
And before anybody gets a chance to speak
I say, 'Yo, don't say nuttin', I guess I'm just a freak!'
Cause we're the freaks of the industry
Aw, you's a freak, G. Yo, you worse Money B
The freaks of the industry
And when you see us backstage, be prepared to G

I seen you with that girl at the hotel after
That show last week
And what about that time out there in the park?
Shhh, don't tell nobody]

It's like this:
Now if there's a cure for this
We don't want it, we'll run from it
And if there's a remedy
We don't need it, we just eat it

The Warning,Lowkey,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","You are not the grime scene saviour
You sly weak hater
A little pop tart that owes Wiley favours
And doesn't really understand these shystie majors
They sell your pop songs to these nice teenagers
And don't get me wrong you might be famous
But they buy green acres
You buy neat trainers (Nikes)
You were more real as an ID faker
Make enough love songs and you might see paper
When you see 1, the label see a hundred crispy bills
That is what happens when you sign 360 deals
Give this chump a little chance, punch you in his heart
Got signed for a chump then bumped for his advance
Getting hyped cos some 12 year olds felt your song
But what you gonna do when all the little girls are gone
You'll be as frail as the songs you got wealthy from
And be a tiny little dancer for Elton John
You ain't even worth the ink in my fingertips
Does this little midget really think he's a lyricist?
To drink from my flippin sink is a privilege
Copy Jay-Z and make your fingers a pyramid
Keep making soulless music your fans buy
But jam your hype and hang tight with your damp rhymes
Hearing you is sad like watching ants die
But people know the truth behind your hand signs
Am not telling anybody to get hostile
This is just a hobby I feel sorry for this lost child
Chipmunk chipmunk chipmunk chipmunk
Lyrical skill isn't measured by your income
They tell me leave the kid alone
He's faker than silicone
My lyrics expose reveal the soul of this jigga clone
Little jigga minnie me, didn't sleep just twitter beef
Still its peak for this little meek in his skinny jeans
Should I snap fingers, end all tweeting, take off my slipper and give parental beatings
Sword razor tongue, means your days are done
This yute is big headed in more ways than one
You diss vex but you spit wet Little Princess
Sony is searching for the next bigheads to pick next
You're not hard, little pop tart, think you got bars
U might top charts but lyrically u flopped hard
Silly voice pretty boy that shaves his eyebrows
Grime scenes very own amy winehouse
Your loopy lately, could you be crazy
What kinda man calls a rap song ""Oopsy Daisy""
I'm a real mc they won't forget me
Fill up your bank account your soul is empty
If u getting vexed ask yourself what you represent
You can't get respect you took a bite of the devil's bread
And the money u made will mean nothing when you're dead
So think when you get that deep thought through your pregnant head
If u get depressed you can pay for next tattoos
Or phone up your mandem JLS to back you
Pick the wrong option, it's likely you got problems
You can't try me I'm not Wiley or Dot Rotten
Not the hardest MC far from the best rapper
Not in this scene but maybe on X Factor
Hide inside your house cos we're sick of your wining mouth
Every sentence will slay the secrets under Simon Cowell
Stay calm fool when the napalm fools
All the youths on your ends call u Hey Arnold
Gutless diva with a tough demeanor
How does it feel to be the UK's Justin Bieber
If you're a lyricist stop coming with them poppy bars
Talk is cheap u can't walk the street without your bodyguards
If money is nothing why is an issue why you rhyme
Money is nothing can't take it with you when you die
Make another track that says how much cash you get
It can't buy u skill credibility or happiness
[Outro]
I don't wanna see people talking about ""Fuck Chipmunk"" after this. It's not about ""Fuck Chipmunk"", this is just a warning, yeah

If you keep acting like a boy, people are gonna keep treating you like a boy. If you act like a man, people will treat you like a man. Just because you got more money and, you got a machine behind you.. doesn't make you a better lyricist than anyone, what makes you a better lyricist is lyrical skill and, right now you need to choose what you are

Are you a lyricist? Or are you a popstar? If you're a lyricist, do your thing
Say the word..

Humble yourself"

A victim of a man
That substitutes his mouth for his hands
So when he talks, you hear a blam, damn
See, my father figured that
My mom should be the father figure
And he'll leave with some bottled liquor
But my mom never stopped the nigga
Until he'll pop for a quickie
Then she'll call for the cops to get him

Cause y'all ain't feeling the song
What I'm feeling is wrong
Hey, Dad, you ain't still in the wrong
But a young man's aging and you still ain't called
I'm so stressed that I really need a black
And I cherish my mom, and it's thanks to D-Black
I'm sorry, D-Black, you might have lost your mom

See, now on a different note, she's singing
But I'm hearing different notes with every different quote
I'm tryin' tell her I love her but she don't listen
And when I try to spend time, she ends up missing
The only thing that's stopping me from cheating
Is the only thing that's stopping her from leaving (love)
But I don't know if that's there anymore
Cause I find myself staring at whores
And she finds herself closer to doors
So how can that work?
But this ain't even the song
This is just for you to hear what's wrong
That's what I'm telling my mom
But she knew all along (why can't we all get along?)
Stuck on a ""He said, she said, I said, you said""
I'm so confused I think I did say it
Got a tight grip but I might slip
It's funny how life hits
Cause Cupid just might miss like

I'm at a point in my life
That the main issue is trying to have a joint in my life
They point at my life and laugh
See, I got two jobs and I'm still broke
See, I got bad asthma and I still smoke
The doctor tellin' me that my breathing getting worse
And soon I won't be able to spit a verse, now I'm feeling cursed
No turning to my dad cause he's too far to look for
So instead I look forward, but I don't look forward to seeing him
At nights I still have bad dreams of being him
People say, ""You look just like your dad
You got his laugh, you got his walk, you got his talk.""
But I don't got his heart
No, I'm much stronger

Bloody and violent individuals (running down your area)
People who are bound to eat your children in a fit of rage
And then smile in your face

Cipher unknown, phone home
From boom box nationals
Scratch demonstrator attach that to dedicate
This involves all total all city caught up
Caught up all city kid nurtured in the game understands
In a place where you live
In demand a saturated burn mega radio dyed eccentric kid
Add a frequency to sifted intelligent biped lid
To combine rent

You want to pop shit and get popped in the top lip?
I shoot the five and on a good day I bite bullets
We use bear traps to catch weasels
Metal mouth's diesel and the bite's lethal
We in the catacomb, nappy headed never used a comb
And built with the forces that blew away Dorothy's home
I grab the mic like, ""Are you experienced?""
But I don't play the guitar, I play my cadence
And if I exhaled arguments only to hold my breath
I would die, and I ain't talking hair color

Spitting paperweights

Can't tell the residents
Residents, I be NYC

Now this environment's a product of me
Function sloppy identity copied
With a rhyme scheme so ill we change rap to con artists
I'm honest to a fault and it's my fault I'm that honest
I guess it's the dimension I climb out
And flow like arachnids on water spouts
The circle is never seen and seldomly heard about
They put me in a cage and Mega will break me out
[Verse 5: Vordul Megalah]
Broke out the cage and blazed an ice cold bowl of sage
Patrolling the maze with four Os and blades
Spit flows straight off corn rows and braids
Light bones and strike domes with
Words I spray automatic vinyl accapell
Separate your soul from the shell
Trapped in the belly
Find me spitting these raps on the celly
That's Mega popping as-salaam lecture
Send a message for those starving in the Mecca
Cooking up measures, stressing the po
Mixed in the vein cold trying to escape
As the pain grows with insane flows
Fit for those wanting to oppose copyright division
Leave you leaking on a stretcher
Puffin on the o, pop you with a biscuit
Fucking with the o plus the x
Bust with effects head blow
Shine these cats divine spit with lines
That go straight through spines
Witness animals robbing armored trucks
And escape with nines
Cause tragedies, crack clavicles, rap classical
We're at 7th Avenue, New York, the city of crime
In the city sublime
Wrapped in subliminal thoughts of criminal ways
While critical times got my mind locked in a physical maze
Trapped in another noose guzzling two Kahlúas
Pop through your bubble goose with raps (takes time)
Pissy, still this all day flow mic jiggy
Rep that NY City, trapped in the shitty, we gets busy
On Mike Nitty, stay twizzy, wrap phillies
And crack dutches, live in the rap function
Flows often bananas off the nut crunches
Salute profanity with middle finger fuckers
Live for you duckers, suckers

The mind plays tricks on the fighter who wishes
Kindness is right and both sides win (Yeah, yeah)
Push the limits of stubbornness to
Finish up above the stubbornness of silly limits (Yeah)
Run the ring around your finger
And build the ring around to bring it, bring it

Georgia Nights,Dolla,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus]: A rainy night in Georgia x2 Oh it’s a rainy night in Georgia! Lord I believe it’s rainin all over the world

[Verse 1]
I feel the rain on my window pane
Wakin up in cold sweats Havin dreams of goin out with a bang
My papa died by the gun
I’ll die by the gun
And if I ever have a son he probably die by the same Pray to God I don’t curse my seeds
And my baby don’t come out with some kinda disease Due to my bad deeds
Every breath I breathe and every step I take
The clock tickin’ bring me closer to fate
Papa died at 25 so he must’a been great
They say the good die young; I must be on my way
And if today that day, then I’m-a die like a man
With a smile on my face knowin’ I never ran
Tell my girl and my niggas I did all I can
Came up with a plan, at times got sidetracked
Enjoyed bein young and rich and you ya don't give back
Tell them crackers kiss my ass, I was proud to be black Yeah

[Chorus]: A rainy night in Georgia x2 Oh it’s a rainy night in Georgia! Lord I believe it’s rainin all over the world
[Verse 2]: Have a party at my funeral celebrating a life
When I died a baby was born that very same night
As It took its first breath, I took my last
Life flashed before my eyes; what I did in the past
You know, my first piece of ass The jokes and the laughs
And the silly shit we did for the love of the cash
Kicked doors, fist fights, Wild parties and shit
All the cars a nigga drove, you know, Ferraris and shit Then I felt the warm feelin from my head to my feet
I couldn’t move, tried talkin, but I couldn’t even speak
Heard a familiar voice, ’son come here to me’
I tried viewin who it was, but I couldn’t quite see
But I know I feel comfortable, soul at peace For the first time ever nigga felt stress-free
If I could rewind the time, [I’d] do it all the same
I’m lookin down over Georgia as it’s startin to rain, hey

[Chorus]: A rainy night in Georgia x2 Oh it’s a rainy night in Georgia! Lord I believe it’s rainin all over the world"

And I ain't gotta tell y'all who I be (why?)
Cause these hundred hundred dollar bills are like Baller ID
And I get under niggas skin, they should call me IV
But if you try me nigga I will be your caller ID
And that means I got your number, please don't make me dial it
That could land your fly ass on the ground, just like a pilot
So just do me a solid, y'all stay in pocket like wallets
Cause you can't see me, closed eye lids
Huh, nighty night
I'm with a model chick, Tyra thick, Heidi's height
Body suits, body tight
Yeah, I clean up nice (nice), catch me on a tidy night
Might be Gucci'd down to the tighty whites
Okay it's Loso, everybody know so
My son is the heir to the throne, Prince Joso
So daddy need money (money), mami need new Trueies (Trueies)
Baby need shoes, preferably the new Louis'

She tried to pull my fly south, I ain't want the bird
Cause I've been killin these hoes, these niggas just drop dead (dead)
In the drop head, all we do is bop head (yes)
To the side like Busta in the Pepsi ad
With my Colombiana mama, yep she bad (she bad)
She in the latest shoe that Giuseppe had
Blow game like the late Dizzy Gillespie had
That's some good jaw, pop quiz, good score
She call her pussy meriene, that good raw
For you little cheap fucks, hood whores
You niggas soft in the middle, call 'em hood smores
Everybody on the block goin cuckoo
Phantom doors open like the clock that goes ""cuckoo"" (cuckoo)
Birds poppin out (yes), sittin on the hood
Check my bird droppings out, I'm shittin on the hood

Knock You Down,Keri Hilson,"['hip hop', 'pop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Keri Hilson]
Haha, not again
Oh, this ain't supposed to happen to me

[Break: Kanye West]
Keep rocking, and keep knocking
Whether you Louboutin it up or Reebokin'
You see the hate that they're serving on a platter
So what we gonna have, dessert or disaster?

[Verse 1: Keri Hilson]
I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you, my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race, but I already won first place
I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did (As hard as I did, yeah)
You got me thinking 'bout our life, our house, our kids, yeah
Every morning, I look at you and smile
'Cause boy, you came around
And you knocked me down, knocked me down
[Chorus: Keri Hilson]
Sometimes, love comes around
(Love comes around, love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes, love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
I never thought I'd hear myself say (Say, mmm)
""Y'all go 'head"" (Oh)
""I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today""
(Kick it with my girl today)
I used to be commander-in-chief
On my pimp shit, flying high (Flying high)
'Til I met this pretty little missile (Oh)
That shot me out the sky (Oh, shot me out the sky, uhh)
Hit, so now, I'm crashing (Don't know how it happened)
But I know it feels so good
Said if I could go back and (Make it happen faster)
Don't you know I would, baby, if I could? (Oh)
Miss Independent (To the fullest)
The load never too much, she helping me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life (Oh)
I swear to you, the pimp in me just died tonight
Girl, sometimes, love...
[Chorus: Keri Hilson, Ne-Yo]
Sometimes, love comes around (Ayy)
(Love comes around, love comes around)
Oh, it comes around
And it knocks you down (Hey, hey)
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Ooh, when it knocks you down, oh (Hey)
Sometimes, love comes around (Ooh-ooh, yeah, comes around)
And it knocks you down (Oh, whoa)
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
(When it knocks you down, knocks you down)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Tell me now, can you make it past your Caspers?
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams
That seemed to only date the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that always kept you laughing
We were never meant to be, baby; we just happened
So, please, don't mess up the trick
""Hey Young World,"" I'm the new Slick Rick
They say I move too quick, but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask someone that's only average for advice?
OMG, you listen to that bitch?
Woe is me, baby, this is tragic
'Cause we had it, we was magic
I was flying; now, I'm crashing
This is bad, real bad—Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad—Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'ma ask him
[Verse 4: Keri Hilson]
So you gotta take the good with the bad, happy and the sad
And let it bring a better future than I had in the past
Oh, 'cause I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again
(Whoa, whoa) Mmh-mmh, I'll admit it, I was scared to answer love's call
(Whoa, whoa) And if it hits better make it worth the fall
When it comes around, hey

[Chorus: Keri Hilson, Ne-Yo, Both]
Sometimes love comes around
(Love comes around, love comes around)
Comes around, whoa
And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Get back up when it knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around (When love comes around)
When love comes around
And it knocks you down (Eh-eh, oh-oh)
Just get back up when it knocks you down (Eh-eh, oh-oh)
Knocks you down
Knocks you down

[Outro: Both, Keri Hilson, Ne-Yo]
Won't see it coming when it happens (Eh)
But when it happens (Uh-huh)
You're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love comes and knocks you down
Oh, no, when it knocks you down
Won't see it coming when it happens (Oh oh)
But when it happens (Ooh)
You're gonna feel it, let me tell you now (Tell you now)
You see when love comes and knocks you down

Bassment,Kano,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Kano]
Look, Method to the Maadness, attitude maverick
16's malice, inflict Damage
KA's land is, who the fuck is Alice?
Goodies and baddies, city's too savage
Married to the game one calls for a family
And when we get together it's like Hussain... No
Vodka and cranberry, rave in a Mandy
House and garage, kid and candy
Prince in the Palace, siblings and families
Jack moves and police, put your hands up
Foul mouthed rappers, no fucking manners
Cockney rhyme and slanger's, sweet
Anti celebrity, anti Britney
Anti anything, anti me
I'm something like a phenomenon
Got rappers eating like it was Ramadan
Got that bass, call me bu-bum-bu-bum
And take 'em down to the bassment
Windows painted, dark Rum wasted
118'ed, barbecue bass it
Floor vibrating, neighbors complaining
Right till the sunshine, 8am shit
And take 'em down to the bassment

I ain't rapping for no MP
FYI I'm a dope MC
And records don't sell, but I LOL

Endangered rappers, we're a dying breed
Song get captured, circus actors
Radio, radio, please play me
Did the video kill that radio fiend?
I'm Lil Wayne and I'm going in
Straight to your brain, break through the Cranium
Simpler than plain, Big Daddy caning them

This Tech N9ne baby
And I don't just do one thing
I'm everything
If I did one thing
All y'all would agree
But you don't
So y'all want me to do some madness
Y'all want the crazy shit
But I just wanna kick it sometimes
Drink some fuckin' Caribou Lou; KC Tea GODDAMN!

[Verse 1]
They want madness, Anghellic and sadness
Fans relish when gladness is damned in devilish and ashes
But I like this cash, this massive magazine ad gets crackin'
Attractive chicks passin' this rap and actresses them asses
They want the clown, the paint and the evil frown
The drink and, the needle now, the taint and no feeble sounds
But I need your pounds, your pesos, your people down
With this label and I be so bound for that halo when I be low ground
They want that black magic, that savage with bad habits
And grab at and stab rabbits, the maggot that has cabbage
But I'm at that fast status with swagger that's past average
My glasses and rag matches don't mean flag and it's no blast added
They say bizarre he went, they love him in dark he vents
Toppin' the chart, he sent naughty shit to everybody's tent
I wanna be at the party bent listening to Parliament
Sorry this part of me's a gnarly gent, they call me (Harvey Dent)

Ain't a hit can I get
Back what I started with

Back what I started with
Want my, want my old shit, buy my, buy my old albums
Want my old shit, buy my, buy my old albums (Harvey Dent)

[Verse 2]
They want the demon, the animal that spread the semen
The cannibal sign of the heathen, who's eatin' meat and no vegan
But I get my fees, and I'm reachin' for the decent skeeze
And a piece of the be frequent beats, and the freak can be hit them cheesing
They want the dark knight, they want a bar fight
Hard bites, art is the smartest thing, in this scarred life
Women, that's our vice, they starin' at our ice
Matter what's at the tar lights? But I hit in the car twice
They want that killer clown, they want the milla sound
Gorilla that pill ya for scrilla, but I hold the villa down
I'm chinchilla now with Makzilla
I tap chillas you rap niggas you hate but it's still a crown
Just call me Two Face
On the right side; I got healthy pearly whites
On the left side I got a tooth ache
I'm Asmodeus, but then I'm Master Farah?
Black people think I'm a devil, and the white people think I'm a god

Only Time Will Tell,ILL BILL,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Necro]
My religious beliefs are to kill snitches and any bitches that beef
Your grill in stitches, get buried inside a ditch in your briefs
Life is enslavement and suffering, crazy snuffings, attacks
Overdosing like David Ruffin, craving, puffing some crack
Hell is endless and friendless to the Hitlers, Mengeles, and Himmlers
Mangled, ripped to pieces by characters like Pinhead, no forgiveness
Reincarnated as God and Satan, logical psycho sadist
My cadence hits like razorblade tips or when Vader invaded
Corresponding with demons, bonded in blood
Like the Ugandan president Idi genocide like Rwandans in bondage
Divine comedy, mind lobotomy, do the math like Ptolemy
A bloodbath, you're split in half, dichotomy
The honorable, horrible, incorrigible, adorable death oracle
Beautiful like a funeral floral, you heard the stories: Murdering for glory
Sent to purgatory for doing something perverted and gory

[Hook: Everlast]
When your heart won't beat, your eyes go black
There's a light in the tunnel and you can't turn back
Your friends can't save you, your family's gone
You're waiting on your judgment at the foot of the throne
Will you beg for some mercy? Will you cop some pleas?
Will you stand on your own or get down on your knees?
Will your angels release you from where demons dwell?
Will you make it into Heaven or go right back to Hell?
Only time will tell, only time will tell
Only time will tell, only time will tell
[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I fall upon my knees like, ""Lord forgive me""
Out of the commandments I've broken ten out of ten now
Blasphemy passed to me because now Satan's my pen pal
Part of me Asmodeus, the other side is an evangelist
God gave me melodious but I'm sick, psycho, and scandalous
Outbursts like bismillah, hallelujah
On the other hand I lust for flesh in my quest for gouda
Shaboobalaboopy time, I choose and the coochie's mine
My booze through the nine and I ooze at a groupie dime
I threw B-signs, but the Cs got more patnas
Everything dead, blasting at peep ma poor patois
Trying to bring you peace but the beast brings forth kaka
I really feel like I hate you but it's eep opp ork ah-ah
You don't know what that means, then ask Jet Screamer
Trash that lingers will cause the enemies to blast that femur
Only time will tell if I crash between her
God forgive me, I'm torn because I'm an angel
With a crass demeanor

When your heart won't beat, your eyes go black

[Verse 3: Ill Bill]
For whom the bells toll, it's the clock, tick tick tick
The truth is the future is now
How many lifetimes have I taken you through in this hour?
I trust nobody cause Babylon destroyed my uncle
So many lessons I've applied to my life that taught me to function
In this hell on the earth the dark clouds have silver linings
Until the lightning strikes down upon the unrighteous and frightening
The non-believers like eighty year old atheists on their death bed
Crying and begging for forgiveness from God
Atrocities committed against mankind
Monstrosities that span time leaving impressions of hatred in man's mind
Don’t let time trap you, it’s vital that you realize that there's a new beginning
At the ending of the hour of reprisal"
The Birth,RZA,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: RZA & Daddy-O]
Yeah, you know what I mean?
'Cause yo, this right here this is called Knowledge of Self
When you apply that to yourself, you know yourself
You know what I'm saying?
Yo; it's gonna get your third eye open
You can see things for what they are
And not what they appear to be
When the God gave me the knowledge
And pass this information to me, it's just-
Whatever, the God right there
Yo Peace, Born Knowledge, Peace God
Peace what up Bobby?
Yo, yo, don't even call me Bobby no more, man
What I call you?
My name is Prince Rakeem, you know what I'm saying?
What's Today's Mathematics?
I see Today's Mathematics is being wisdom
Let me explain like this to you God, how I see it

[Hook: sample]
Ever since my Birth (don't worry!)
I've had no one to care (worried all I know... yeah!)
[Verse 1: RZA]
They say wisdom, is the wise words spoken
By a brother attemptin' to open
The graves, of these mentally dead slaves
Who've been lost on a cross, for decades
And centuries, lookin' for the liberty
But receive nothin', but misery
And hard times, and things of that nature
By the devil in a genocide caper
Little Boy Peep, has lost his sheep
But I found 'em, in a deep long sleep
Nine thousand miles away from home
Livin' the life of a modern-day Flintstone
We the people, supposed to be equal
But the men who wrote that, they was evil
Slave owners, who did not include us
They just used us, and abused us
First they trick you, then mentally kill you
And use technologies, to rebuild you
This whole plan was a perfect scam
See that's why they called it, the Six Million Dollar Man
Six is the limitation of the Devil
In the Million square miles of land that he settles
Put you in a three piece suit, give you loot
Chemicals in your head to make you look cute
They use you as a fool to deceive your own people
And fillin' my children head with pins and needles
But I'll take out the pins you inserted
And I'll avenge all my mothers that you murdered
And brutalized, by this modern form of slavery
To speak the truth it takes bravery
And no man could stop my flow
Because I know what I speak and I speak what I know
[Hook: RZA]
What, becomes of a broken family?
Dreams are crushed and there's no more family

[Hook: sample + RZA]
Ever since my Birth (don't worry!)
I've had no one to care (worried all I know... yeah!)

[Verse 2: RZA]
Yo, as a life can be slowed down 20 frames per second
Seen through Panavision
The inner light inside my mind's shines expands the prism
A man of wisdom, victorious and the glorious
Sight beyond sight we stand up as Divine Warriors
Who smite with the mighty right hand of God
Yield the holy sword, swings the holy rod
Then bathe in the pond of Nirvana, escape the realm of Karma
Allow the true grace of God to shine through my persona
And build the reconstructional terms that's constructive
As we destroy the negative germs that's destructive
Productively, sincerely, we uphold the righteous banner
With the gold touch of Midas, mold the righteous hammer
And anvil, to the sound of Man-drill
Ignite to the speed of light cause time to stand still
Rewrite the script of Egypt, who made the Holy Bible
Or Koran, how long ago, who made the Holy Title?
Of I Self Lord And Master, who control the vital
Parts of your heart, who wrote the wise recitals?
Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah, Arm-Leg-Leg-Arm-Head
Still puzzled like the jigsaw

Camo shorts go with anything I wanna wear
They let me in the club, fuck a dress code
Me and all my niggas rollin' up the best smoke
OG Kush from the West Coast
Oh you down to fuck? Shorty let's go
Diamonds in my chain, niggas trying to steal my lane
Chronic in my brain bitch, I’m reppin' Taylor Gang
Smoke 'til I’m insane, drinking til' I’m throwing up
Only papers if you Taylor’d nigga throw it up
High socks, low cuts
Smell that good weed, then you know it's us
That yellow car pulling up
Them niggas ain't high so they ain't close to us
Down to fly, yeah, two fingers and hold em up

Topic of discussion, talk shit cause they bitches love us
Plus them niggas suckas, I got that in living color
All my cars are different colors, all my broads are different colors
All I do is fuck 'em once and I don't call or give ‘em numbers
Ro-lex, more, sex
Good, weed, no, stress
Run my town, arms, chest
Lift, weights, Bow-flex
Throw your set up, what you rep when you twistin' ya fingers?

Get your Taylor on, hold for whatever you rep
Throwin up the gang, 4800 still reppin' a set

Purple Rain,Beanie Sigel,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Caution Do Not Mix With Alcohol
May Cause Drowsiness Keep Out of Reach of Small Children

[Verse 1: Beanie Sigel]
I roll a bat, crack a dutch, have a sizzip
Get introduced to this drink that I sizzip
Promethazine with codeine that's my twizzist
It might lean me to the left or make me izzitch
ProMeth with the Tuss', some like the mizzix
Cording to they fixes and how they wanna dizzip
But be careful it ain't your ordinary liquid
First time you sip it, you might get addicted
Matter fact, I know you gon get addicted
Cause it's so sweet like licorice, plus it's good for your sickness
I used to watch my uncle sip it
Going through his act in my grandmother’s kitchen
Head in his lap, grandma bitchin
Pocket full of scratch, plus scratchin and itchin
Back when they sip Broma, and smoked cheeba
Took Doors and Fours and chewed ceebas
This one is for my real mud-mixers
Who get screwed up, my thick juice sippers
Shout out, to my man Lil' Flip
Big Mo, Project Pat and the whole 3-6
Yea I know about them Texas boys
Who keep a liter in the cup, and a heater in the tuck
Think a Xanax and indo sack make me slack
Cocktailed or V'ed up, get swiss-cheesed up
[Hook]
Please don't blow my high (blow my high)
When I'm sippin that purple rain
Said don't blow my high, blow my high
When I'm sippin that purple rain
I know it may sound crazy, keeps me lazy

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Way back in '94 Screw still had his gate up
He called over to his house and he poured me an 8' up
I asked him what it was, he said Bun, get your weight up
This is lean, them white folks call it promethazine
Shit, but we gon call it drink dog cause that's what we be doin to it
Now take this Big Red and pour about a 2 into it
I said 2's and 8's, that the fuck is you trippin on
He said man thats an ounce of the cough syrup that you sippin on
So shit I poured it, I sipped it, then I tipped some mo'
I fired up a green monster, and I hit that ho
Started relaxin, shit and to my surprise
I was noddin' off, looking at the back of my eyes
They tried to wake me up, but shit I just kept yawnin
I fell out in my chair and woke up there the next mornin
God Bless my nigga, cause since then I been spoiled
On my white mud, a cup of Texas Tea that Oil

[Hook]
[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel] + (Bun B)
I roll a bat, crack a dutch, have a sizzip
Get introduced to this leaf in my splizzif
No stem, no seeds, no stizzicks
The ultimate, experience, like Jimi Hendrix
I like to roll up, cowboy tradition
Or burn a peace pipe and cyphe like the Injuns
Or burn a big spliff, Bob Marley Style
""Buffalo Soldier,"" Rastafari style
We smokes on pizurp (we sips on syzurp)
Get it by the 8, by the pint, (or by the Quzart)
Some might take a Vic, or a Zan or a pizzurk
Whatever you can stand, floats your boat (make ya' twizurp)
Yes I fucks wit' ya' if you smoke on green (or sip on lean)
Yea whatever, clique or team (strip or scene)
Nigga burn your spliff one time
(Say Beans, swing your big body Benz and I'll swing mine)

Reverse Pimpology,Immortal Technique,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Immortal Technique]
Hypocrites, hookers, sex offenders
Y'all niggas wanna be pimps and players?
This ain't 1997 nigga

[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
I'd rather be rich and unhappy than broke and miserable
Cause the game don't give a FUCK if you lyrical
And that's pitiful, so my position is pivotal
You can hate me all you like but you worship the principle
I inspire revolution, the government's not invincible
Vietnam to Venezuela, trick knowledge, they pimpin you
All up in the hood like McDonald's and liquor
Selling AIDS medicine, when we know you got the cure nigga (woo!)
You leery of conspiracy theory but hear me
From a business perspective, it makes more sense clearly
Cause moreover, that's what we go to war over
And numbers don't lie unless we do Bush and Gore over
Free markets make money disingenuously
But I invest in agriculture, biochemistry
Smart nigga from the hood, pussy, what type of crime is that?
But exec's are like, ""You from Harlem? Where your diamonds at?""
Stupid
[Chours: Mojo and Immortal Technique]
Can't dodge the game
If you lookin' for the money or the fame (oh-ohh)
The players and the rules ain't changed (oh no)
But see we tryin' to leave a name
So we're turnin' out
Yeah, this is how pimps get pimped and players get played
Rich people get robbed and, broke niggas paid
New York, London, Chicago, Philly and L.A
Miami, D.C., B-more and out in the Bay
We're tearin it out of the frame
See we deserve to stake that claim
If we didn't it's a cryin shame
What we're concerned about is how to turn it out

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
Show me a pretty girl, with the world stuck to her
And I bet you there's a brother that's tired of fuckin her
Lots of niggas girls is someone else's one night stand
I probably made some bitches nervous listenin with they man (ha ha)
And if that offends somebody, I'm sorry, fuck you!
What you think, revolutionaries don't like to fuck too?
You just gotta beware of dangerous coochie
Cover ya head like a kufi, some rappers think that they live in a movie
Until they get herpes or clap from a groupie
And I don't need to shout you out, nigga you know who you be
Look, most people are only players cause they got played
And have not, let go of that, shit since the 7th grade
Yeah you got your heart broke, life sucks, doesn't it?
But you shouldn't fuck up someone else's life because of it
Someone did your mother like that, that's why you fatherless
Before jail or racist cops, that's what the problem is
[Chours 2: Mojo and Immortal Technique]
See who's the one to place that blame
We getting trapped in cycle of pain
With a generation headed down the drain
That's how we're turning out
This is how pimps get pimped
And players get played
Beautiful women get cheated on
And gangsters strayed
Jersey, Detroit, Denver, Phoenix, Atlanta
Texas, Vegas, Seattle and fuckin Louisiana
Regardless of the money you're paid
You spend it on a watch and a chain
But can't offer your children a thing
What the hell is goin' on in your brain?

[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]
Yeah, I'm not a crack rapper, I'm not a backpacker (ha ha ha)
I'm not a wack rapper, moonlighting as a bad actor
I treat labels like the projects, cause I'm a hater (what!)
Go to the Sony building and piss in the elevator
Cater to hustlers, crooks and cheap smugglers
Bootleg my own album, to reach customers (yeah)
Every city, state and country, the hood love me
Even Aborigines, in Australia bump me
They say underground fans are all the color of talcum
But who the fuck you think buy 50 and Jay albums?
Who the fuck you think made Snoop and Dre platinum?
Call up any major record label and ask 'em
But there's some, devils in disguise in hip-hop
That belong at Republican fundraisers with Kid Rock (bitch!)
I hope one of my fans has one of your kids shot (bitch!)
And blames it on Acid, Prozac and Slipknot
You a pussy actin hard like a bitch cop
I'll drop you to the floor like a reverse wristlock
Eat your food and shit on you, like a highway pit stop
And make, revolutionaries out of kids that used to flip rocks
The government, pimped 9/11 to go to Iraq
And history, repeats itself right on track (how?)
First as a tragedy, and then the comedy begins (why?)
Cause it's funny, motherfuckers don't see it come around again
[Outro: Mojo and (Immortal Technique)]
Where, can we be free? (FUCK we gon' be free man?)
We only wanna live our lives
Live our lives, with our eyes open
Open your eyes open your eyes
You stupid motherfuckers - you stupid motherfuckers
Open your eyes, before you die"

In the back of a Pontiac that was parked in a laundromat
Pimping’s not easy

Shouts to Bishop Brigante in Toronto
I’m a mercenary, squeeze it double quattro
Cover your meat with the shells for the cheese like a taco
I go straight to your crib if you pushing weight
When you get home I might be the reason that your bush’ll shake
I pop out, my Glock find a place to put your face
White tee bloody as an apron around a butcher’s waist
Like them baby back joints stacked on top of each other
Ribs are touching, no stopping a brother
Strip nigga, now go lay on top of your mother
A sick nigga, it was a hobby to rob me a sucker (yeah)
I’m about to ride around to Biggie’s “Ready to Die” shit
With one of you maggots tied up in the trunk, now that’s some fly shit
My heart dark as the inside of your eyelids
Bitches try to gas me, Crooked I’s too hybrid (ow)
Yeah, I spit like a Long Beach Pharoahe Monch
Keep your eyes on the sparrow when the double barrel launch
I’m g’d like a character from Robert De Niro’s Bronx
Tale, hell, tell me why the hell I wear a watch (huh)

I can tell you ahead of time you need some better lines

Seventy-seven times better than whoever rhymed, never mind

Loud Pipes,Lil Wayne,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Mannie Fresh]
I put piss stains on private planes, cause it's my jet nigga
Money ain't shit cause my Rottweilers drink Moët
Diamond baguette bracelets for my lovers
Player, I use Cristal to lubricate rubbers
Who got shit on his wrist that cost three nickel
Who got the project on lock when that nigga slanging pickle
Who got a Benz, a Prowler, playboy, and a 'Vette
Tell the truth -- who fucked you on the same night when we met?
Now, who got baby mamas from the N.O. to New York
Who got every bitch's attention in this motherfucker when he talk
Now who the fuck we talking about, look -- y'all dont know?
I'll give you a hint: see that bitch you with?
He fucked that ho
Now look here, y'all ain't seen my watch, it's like 'Harlem World' video
White diamonds, red rubies, blue baugettes, I don't know
Shorty, when the next time I'mma be up in your bed
I love you? You love me?
Well go 'head on and gimme some head

[Chorus: Juvenile]
Loud pipes big rims
Wodie that's our life
When we pull up at the club
Sorry that's our night
I know a lot of haters out there saying
That that's not right
But our diamonds are much bigger
So that's our life
Loud pipes big rims
Wodie that's our life

Sorry that's our night

I told 'Soul' I need something
With some hell of a ice
Nigga came back with a hell of a price
That ain't nothing, these hoes doing hella wrong
Calling these niggas on our cell phone
Bitch riding Benz on 20-inch chrome
Give me the key, the car, ho, and the alarm
For my Prowler, my Jag, my Benz and my home
Bitch you'll never ride 20-inch chrome
I love to shine, that's why the chopper's mine
Hit my block in my Benz, ho, with stretch tires
Bought a new car that I couldn't drive
Bought it to tunes before a nigga could drive
When I put the Bose system right behind my eyes
With the VC's and TV's so a nigga could shine
Let my ice bling bling like a 9 to 5
And tell all my hoes they don't need no job

Loud pipes big rims

I ride the best, from a Benz, to a Jag, to a Beamer, to a Lex
Might fly first class on Delta, helicopter or a jet
I'm a stunter, I'm a repper, Geezy like to shine
Drink Don, Moët, and Crissy, see that's the finest wine
20 inches is the only thing I sit my shit on
Don't bring yo bitch around me cause my dick she'll wanna sit on
And I ain't gonna tell her nothing different, that's your issue
But after she come back, your best out is not to kiss her
Whole city sayin damn, look at Fresh pinky ring
Look at B.G. watch, that bitch bling-a-ling-a-ling
I'm a ice wearer, trust me, you will never
See me sporting nothing that ain't 20 G's or better
Me and Wayne take the left, Juve and Baby take the right
It's dark in the room, we hold up our watches and it's light
Cash Money Millionaires living a hell of a life
Like my nigga Weezy said, we surrounded by ice

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Now I'm shinin' beamin' glossin', Big Tymin' stuntin' and flossin'
Lamborghini sitting on broaders with two more in my garages
Plus a blue and black ferrari with Nintendo and Atari
Man I swear the car is awesome, vroom! Sorry, we lost 'em
I'm back, I pull up smelling like dime sacks and cognac
I leave in the Hummer, hour later I'm flying back
Whoosh, private jet's about to land
The women fall out when I let them touch my hand
I get out the plane into a Mercedes Benz van
TVs all over with chrome 20-inch fans, damn
Goddamn, man, I am, L-I-L, Weezy, off the heezy
But still in awe, ice floodin' on my watch
And in my grill and all, Porsche Box', front blocks

Friends  Family,Talib Kweli,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Talib Kweli]
You are now witnessing the demise of the music business
I say demise of the music business cause people always gonna need music in they life
You know what I'm saying?
I can't do music with people I'm uncomfortable with
You know what I'm saying?
I can't be on stage with you pouring out my soul if I don't like you
So with that said, shout out to Strong Arm Steady
Shout out to Jean Grae
That's my Blacksmith family, you dig?

[Verse 1]
I just heard a song that reminded me of times when you was finding me
Rhyming in Greenwich Village circa 1993
Yeah, those was the salad days, my career's appetizer
The main course a casserole, a jambalaya
Of different influences that led me where the music is
A student is only as good as his teachers' tutelage
Paying for college, not learning was straight foolishness
So I stopped going to school but this was
Hard to tell my parents -- sat them down, tried to get through to them
Started flowing daily and traveled to different places
Freestyled with Clef and Forte in the Booga Basement
With Rubix and Juju on Flatbush, my hood amazing
Platinum Island recording with Duro and Just Blaze
And that was right next door to Rawkus -- what's up, Jarret and Brian Blackshaw?
And Matt Fingaz; Kendra Ross, you got the soul of a Stax singer
I love how you always bring it back, sister
You and Reesy making every record
I got classics with Hi-Tek and Mos Def that are so respected
Shout out to Corey Smyth, shout out to Dave Chapelle
I went on tour with The Roots, they played so well
Writing rhymes with Myka 9
Me and Pharoahe Monch were Soundbombing
Me and Lonnie Lynn got a lot in common
Mystik Journeymen introduced me to Top Ramen
On the bus, Kanye West would never stop rhyming
Ain't no mountain high enough for him, he never stopped climbing
That's why when the homies win, I never stop smiling
See I'm smiling right now
[Hook]
Nothing else matters more than friends and family
No doubt, that's how its gotta be
This is my odyssey, it's just the God in me
Friends and family, yup, they all a part of me
Cause I would die for them and they would die for me
Friends and family, that's right, and plus I love my fans
Love when you throw your hands up, it's like you all my fam
Friends and family, like you considered kin
Got me through thick and thin, thank you for listening
Nothing else matters more than friends and family

[Verse 2]
It started with a blast, now I'm a iconoclast
Promise to be honest in my craft and make the promise last
I do this for myself, but the song for you
Once I put it out for sale then it belong to you
This for Amani Fela plus Diani Eshe
Your daddy love his girl, your mother never far away
This is for Eque, this for Kierra Paul
We wanna ride like Ciara and we will never fall
HeadCquarterz and Guru is love forever y'all
Make it plain cause its too strong for a metaphor or simile
Your legacy will always be remembered for forever or
Til the end of time whichever come first
Big love to my mom and dad -- you could have done worse
Jamal and I the way we are cause you put your sons first
Many black parents lose they sons to the gun burst
Mommas drowning in they own tears til they lungs burst
Voice cracking like Michael Stipe cause everyone hurts
[Hook]
Nothing else matters more than friends and family
No doubt, that's how its gotta be
This is my odyssey, it's just the God in me
Friends and family, yup, they all a part of me
Cause I would die for them and they would die for me
Friends and family, that's right, and plus I love my fans
Love when you throw your hands up, it's like you all my fam
Friends and family, like you considered kin
Got me through thick and thin, thank you for listening
Nothing else matters more than friends and family

[Verse 3]
First record was with Mood back in '96
In fact, it was pretty fresh, Google that, find that shit
It sound good; I was showing you what timeless is
You couldn't catch what I was saying without rewinding it
Believe me, every fan is special
You hear me now but I got fans from Lyricist Lounge and ""Manifesto""
So much wack rap, I know its hard to tell the difference
But when I heat it up I make the garbage smell
I'm resurrected but I'm no savior
I know the game, I can ball a little bit -- I'm an OK Player
Double meaning cause the flow is layered
We love to say it but its easier than it sound to ignore the haters
To snap back like the jaws of gators"
The Woman with the Tattooed Hands,Atmosphere,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","I used to know this woman who had the most beautiful
Tattoos on the top sides of both of her hands
She was forty-three years old and as far as I know
Had never yet been with a man
It's not that she wasn't attractive;
She was beautiful, but it was the way that she interacted
She was aggressively passive to the point where she
Would've intimidated any mitt that ever tried to catch it
On the right hand she had a tattoo of a nude girl
She claimed it is what God resembled
But on the left she had a mirrored image of the same female
And this one she explained looked like the devil
I remember once watching her touch her own breasts
How the tattoos smiled as they stared down her stomach
As if anticipating when they'd be allowed to caress
The sweet flower that they both seemed too hunger (sweet flower)
Now maybe I was high but it felt so right
Heaven and hell both take to this woman's womb
It didn't make sense how she could commence
Touching herself with me wide awake in the same room
But if I've learned anything in my years (my years)
I learned I no longer believe in surprise (in surprise)
But what happened next damn near stole my tears
The tattoos came alive right in front of my eyes
They both slowly stood up and climbed off her hands
And showed me why she never took some time with a man
They climbed deep inside of this woman's garden
She closed her eyes and she gently bit her bottom lip
I stepped I left and I don't regret leaving
And I'd never forget all the things I saw that evening
A glimpse of religion a piece of coming closer
To understanding more about what intrigues me most
I didn't get turned on I just got turned
I wasn't as aroused as I was concerned
For each one of em I've hurt
And every time I've been burned
I've got a lot to teach but even more to learn
So now I keep my eyes open hoping to take in all I can
About woman taking in all she can
And for as long as I breathe I'll save a seat in my memory
For that woman with the tattooed hands
[Chorus x5]
There's good and evil in each individual fire
Identifies needs and feeds our desire
As long as we keep our spirit inspired
She can bite her bottom lip all she wants"

A Dream,Common,"['hip hop', 'jazz', 'r&b', 'blues', 'pop']","[Hook x2: Will.I.Am] (Sample from Martin Luther King's ""I Have A Dream"" speech)
(I have a dream) I got a dream

(That one day) We gonna work it out
(That one day) We gonna work it out

(I have a dream) I got a dream
(That one day) That one day

(I have a dream)

[Bridge: Will.I.Am]
My dream is to be free
My dream is to be...
My dream is to be...
My dream is to be free

[Verse 1: Common]
In search of brighter days, I ride through the maze of the madness
Struggle is my address, where pain and crack lives
Gunshots coming from sounds of blackness
Given this game with no time to practice
Born on the black list, told I'm below average
A life with no cabbage
That's no money if you from where I'm from
Funny, I just want some of your sun
Dark clouds seem to follow me
Alcohol that my pops swallowed bottled me, no apology
I walk with a boulder on my shoulder
It's a cold war, I'm a colder soldier
Hold the same fight that made Martin Luther the King
I ain't using it for the right thing
In between lean and the fiends, hustle and the schemes
I put together pieces of a dream, I still have one
[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 2: Common]
The world see me lookin' in the mirror
Images of me, gettin' much clearer
Dear self, I wrote a letter just to better my soul
If I don't express it, then forever I hold
Inside, I'm from the side where we out of control
Rap music in the hood play the fatherly role
My story like yours, yo it gotta be told
Tryna make it from a gangsta to a godlier role
Where it scrolls and stow slaves, and Jewish people in cold cage
Hate has no color or age
Flip the page, now my race became freedom
Write dreams in the dark, they far but I can see 'em
I believe in heaven more than hell, lessons more than jail
In the ghetto, let love prevail with a story to tell
My eyes see the glory, and well
The world waiting for me to yell ""I Have a Dream""

Fighting Trousers,Professor Elemental,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro] (Spoken)
Ah, Jeffrey, what's that you have in your hand boy? Pass it over. A telegram? Oh dear. Seems someone has been biting me. Fetch me my trousers at once! No, not those, those are my time-travel trousers! Those are my tea trousers? Got it, those ones, My fighting trousers!

[Verse 1]
Dear Sir, regarding your recent foray
Into the rap business and the scene you portray
See I don't normally approve of war games
But ""He's biting you"" is what they all say
And by Harry, they might be right--
This is hip hop, not an Elvis night!
Shelve this Professor impersonation
Let it end now, it's impertinent waiting!
You seem a reasonable chap, what you need to do is rap
But not parody chap hop
Cause that's not proper, just not cricket!
Put away your ukulele or I'll tell where to stick it!

[Chorus]
I - Don't like your tweed, sir!
Will - Teach you the professor's ready!
Not - Let's see who strikes the loudest!
Lose - Put on my fighting trousers!
[Verse 2]
I've got super producers and fans that play me
You've got a granddad's mustache and a ukulele
Don't look around sir, I'm speaking to you
Roll up your shirt sleeves, Queensbury rules
Never test professors with the cleverest wits
Let's settle this like gentlemen: armed with heavy sticks
On a rotating plate, with spikes like Flash Gordon
And you're Peter Duncan; I gave you fair warning
When this George Formby clone is performing
Audiences go home before he begins talking
A new career might be more rewarding
I'm a bright Brighton peer, you're rap's Piers Morgan

[Chorus]
I - Don't like your tweed, sir!
Will - Teach you the professor's ready!
Not - Let's see who strikes the loudest!
Lose - Put on my fighting trousers!

[Verse 3]
I'm not seeing you at ciphers or workshops with kids or gigs
Dear sir, you're not worthy of this!
Sold out to Coca-Cola
Used for a trend
And that means you're banned
From using a pen
Hope it's safe to assume you won't do this again
Set foot on my stage and get ruined again
Be out, Mr. B, I've set the egg timer
There's not room in town for two gentlemen rhymers
Leave town by the end of this instrumental
Yours, et cetera, et cetera, sincerely, and so forth
Professor Elemental
[Chorus]
I - Don't like your tweed, sir!
Will - Teach you the professor's ready!
Not - Let's see who strikes the loudest!
Lose - Put on my fighting trousers!

Dahh, sorry, I'm sorry Geoffrey but it-it gets my goat, gets my dander right up! Bloody told him. No, no jazz solo, this is supposed to be a diss song! Geoffrey, get off the drums!"

Three 6 Ma-fi-UHH! (whoahh-ohh) Good Charlotte (Dead Executives!)
Hypnotize Minds, Dead Executives (wooo!)
Some real shit man, let's drop it
Let's go!

[Hook: Good Charlotte]
You know I can't live my life, working no 9 to 5
No matter what they say, I'm doing it my own way
Cause time ain't on my side, and they don't understand
Forget what people say, I'm doing it my own way

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
So many shysters in my ears fool, trying to pop it
On my new fame, they will put new hands in my pocket
Standing in the rain buck in hand man, about to cock it
I take another one they wanna be up out the rocket
I can't understand why they even wanna see me broke
(whoahh-ohh)
Wanna see me choke off my own blood from cutting my throat
I always wanted the money; fame wasn't worth my while
That's why I wore a mask on the front of ""Mystic Stylez""
(doin it my own way)
But one night in March '06 my life changed in a sec
Whether for better or for worse I can't answer that yet
But I'll go to the pen before I lose my ends
Murder one, one of you hoes tryin to get me for my Benjamins
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Real talk!
In the field, it's real, slip up, get killed
Get robbed, get stung, get messed off in a deal
These kids are gone, on meth, and pills
That's why, I pack, I carry, the steel
I'm posted, in the hood, got green, I'm good (whoahh-ohh)
Trap house, no doubt, is where, I stood
Got guap, got hot, 'til shop, got popped
These snitches, time cuts, it won't, ever stop (doin it my own way)
The times ain't gon' change (change) long as cocaine ('caine)
Goes up the nose (nose) fries a nigga brain (brain)
See 'em in the morning time trying to catch a drain (drain)
Back out on the block (block), doin the same thang (thang)

Ix-nay on the bullshit, man
When I roll back to Cleveland
I can't believe them
Sounds of the nonbelievers
Outcast 'til I'm in dirt
Before it did hurt
Now I can overstand how
You could dismiss or front on
Ask me how I
Feel about the ones with closed eyes
My words how I feel exactly are ""Fuck that""
I don’t give a damn 'bout nay one hater
Talking down
Don't be afraid at all, y'all
All I ask of all y'all

How you're thinking often
And it's startin'

Look at what I made you
Guide to teach you
Honest but insecure, cool

Sometimes you got to do it
Sometimes you show the tough love

Uhh, check me out yo

[Verse 1: Masta Ace]

Y'all don't wanna hear the shit I got
Kid I got the hot shit - did I stop?
Hell no, gotta stay bent like an elbow
Sell more than those other niggas trying to blow
I'm dying to flow
Got tricks like I'm buying a ho
Fuck around and you dying a slow...death
Move shit from right to left
North to South, nigga put his foot in his mouth
All I need is a place to stand, Ace the man
Bought rims and we laced the van
Kitted it up, fitted it up, made it look good
Swallowed your words now you spittin it up
Bought a crib with a pool in the back
Write a verse and I'm schooling the wack
Taking it there, you know me like a relative
Like your Auntie, but making you want me
Flaunt me in your CD like The Symphony
How we used to, when we was Juice Crew
Who's who? Don't nobody care no more
Stare no more, get out their chair no more
Scott LaRock ain't here no more
No Biggie, no 'Pac - gotta keep on, don't stop
[Hook]

Y'all cats wanna bounce? (Spread it out)
Or puff like half an ounce? (Spread it out)
With the cash in your hand like half a grand
Cause you know what it's all about (Spread it out)

Gotta do what you hear me say (Spread it out)
When you back that up gon' hear me shout
Cause you know what it's all about (Spread it out)

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]

Chain with the piece stoned out
Car chromed out, and then we roamed out
To the club where we zoned out - all night long
It's on, hope a nigga play my song
Cause we come then we go just like the quick cash
Whiplash, niggas always tryin to flash
Middle of the club, be on the cell phone
Nigga that busy, he need to stay home
I done been a few times here
Plus I met a few dimes here
Show more love than lights in Times Square
Every time I see one, stop and stare
Copped a beer - a few rums'n'cokes
Nuns and popes pray for us
Every single day for us - trying to find a way for us
Y'all don't really wanna play wit us, c'mon
[Hook]

Y'all cats wanna bounce? (Spread it out)

[Verse 3: Masta Ace]
Watch.. I'mma turn life to art
Play the part, watch how I climb the chart
Look for the beef and it's bound to start
Little bit of money tear niggas apart
Figure you're smart, figure you'll spit the game
Get the fame, gold plaque with the frame
Five years later though, shit the same
Niggas still really don't know your name - look
M.A., behind the wheel
Find a real label then sign a deal
And don't give a damn 'bout the mass appeal
That's the real, the world just has to feel
What I drop, when I drop, can I drop -
- more hot shit, then I cop the blue 5
And go up to 1-2-5 - you drive
I just wanna stay alive, a-ight?

Yo, yo yo move out of the way
We got Missy Elliott coming through
Girl that is Missy Elliott she lost a lot of weight
Girl I heard she eats one cracker a day
Oh well I heard the bitch was married to Tim and started fucking with Trina
I heard the bitch got hit with three zebras and a monkey
I can't stand the bitch no way

[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]
When I walk up in the piece
I ain't gotta even speak
I'm a bad mamajama
Goddammit, motherfucker, you ain't gotta like me
How you stuntin' these hoes
Need to talk, what you know
And stop talking 'bout who I'm sticking and licking
Just mad it ain't yours
I know y'all poor, y'all broke
Y'all job just hanging up clothes
Step to me, get burnt like toast
Motherfuckers, adios, amigos
Halves halves wholes wholes
I don't brag, I mostly boast
From the VA to the LA coast

Bitches wanna talk shit
I'm driving, I'm glad and I'm styling
And these motherfuckers ask, ""Did you see it?""
I'm gripping these curbs
SKRRT! Did ya heard?
I love 'em, my feathers, my furs, ahh!
I fly like a bird
Chickenheads on the prowl
Who you tryna fuck now?
Now you ain't getting loud
Better calm down 'fore I smack your ass down
I need my drums, bass high
Has to be my snare, strings, horns, yes
I need my Tim sound, right, left

I don't go out my house, shorty, you just waiting to see
Who gon' roll up in the club and then report that next week
Just wanna see who I am fucking, boy sniffing some coke
I know by the time I finish this line, I'ma hear this on the radio

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Yeah, uh huh, okay
Once upon a time in College Park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Chris
Nobody paid him any mind, no one gave a shit
Knowing he could rap, no one lifted hands
So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD and then he hit the block
50 thousand sold, seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone, three years later
Stepped out the swamp in ten-and-a-half gators
Now all around the world on the microphone
He leave the booth smelling like Burberry cologne
Still riding chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen, never home alone
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect, you'll give me
Ludacris, I live LOUD like Timmay
Fuck, have to clear these rumors
I got a headache, and it's not a tumor
Get up on my lap and get my head sucked tight
Sprayed, so I never let the bedbugs bite
Hard to the core, core to the rotten
Jump down, turn around, pick a bale of cotton
Yahh!

Or move as far as sold Michael Jackson 43 million
Shoot, errbody have the zipper jacket
And half of these thugs have the glove to match, ya feel me?
Yo, it's ok though, if you wanna be hard and ice grill
And Harlem Shake at the same time, whatever
Let's just have fun, it's hip-hop man, this is hip-hop!"

""When you were over in American Samoa, what surprised you the most?""
""I guess what hit me the most was the condition of the factory that the workers were in
The factory was surrounded by a fence and barbed wire on top, and on the bottom
And they have a chain linked fence around the whole factory, and military compound
The gate has a guard shack where the guard sit there and control... the worker movement
In and out of the factory, the factory made of tin panels, tin roof, it's really hot
The temperature over there is regularly ninety degrees, and inside the factory
It reach way over a hundred degrees""

[Verse 1-Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, it's a contemporary form of slavery, they call it slave labor
But they don't prosecute them cause it's how they make paper
When you rocking that fly shit that's made in China
By an eight year old child trying to feed his mama
He exposed to contamination and disease
And only fifty-five percent of them will get degrees
And the women have to try to placate the boss
Because of sex discrimination in the labor force
The slave master only let them speak in sign language
And they suffering from lung disease and eye damage
Fourteen hour shifts, seven days a week
Two shitty meals a day, very little sleep
Human life only worth three cents an hour
All human rights lost, no sense of power
Working for a hundred years in the grave passes
Only the improved cleverness of slave masters
[Hook]
Is life worth living if you living in Hell?
When the mind is confined to a prisoner cell?
And the lies they devise and the system, it fail
But I expect the system to fail
Is life worth living if you living in Hell?
When the mind is confined to a prisoner cell?
And the lies they devise and the system, it fail
But I expect the system to fail

""Many Chinese workers are forced to sign secret agreements
Known as ""Shadow contracts"" before they leave China
Severely, and in some ways, illegally restricting their activities while on
American soil
Workers are forbidden to participate in any religious or political
Activities
Or to ask for a salary increase, or even to fall in love or get married""

[Verse 2-Vinnie Paz]
It's 1.6 million people locked in jail
They the new slave labor force, trapped in Hell
They generate over a billion dollars worth of power
And only gettin' paid twenty cents an hour
They make clothes for McDonald's and for Applebee's
And working forty-hour shifts in prison factories
And while we sit around debating who the wack MC's
They have to work when arthritic pain attack the knees
Slavery's not illegal, that's a fucking lie
It's illegal, unless it's for conviction of a crime
The main objective is to get you in your fucking prime
And keep the prison full and not give you a fucking dime
But they the real criminal, keeping you confined
For a petty crime, but they give you two-to-nine
And ain't nobody there to protect ya
Except a bunch of incompetent human rights inspectors

Until she became pregnant ... says she refused to have the abortion
And has now been barred from entering the factory""
""Allowing them to bring that onto US soil is a very big concern

If that shiesty bitch don't kill me, then the cheddar will
You think like a man with no hands, we could never build

The sly fox, cyclops
We locked in an idiot box
The video slots broadcasting Waco Davidian plots
They own YouTube, MySpace
When this ignorant shit going to stop?
They monopolizing news, your views
And the channel you choose, propaganda, visual cancer
The eye in the sky, number 5 on the dial
Secret agenda, frequency antenna, Dr. Mindbender
Remote control, soul controller, your brain holder
Slave culture, game's over
What's a fox characteristic? Slick shit, censored misinformation
Pimp the station, over-stimulation
Reception, deception, Comcast digital Satan
The fox has a bushy tail
And Bush tells lies and fox-trots
So, I don't know what's real (what's real)

Watch what you're watching, Fox keeps feeding us toxins
Stop sleeping, start thinking outside of the box
And unplug from the Matrix doctrine
But watch what you say, Big Brother is watching
Watch what you're watching, Fox keeps feeding us toxins
Stop sleeping, start thinking outside of the box
And unplug from the Matrix doctrine
But watch what you say, Fox Five is watching

The Fear Factor got you all riled up
O'Reilly? Oh really? No rally needed, I'll tie you up
Network for child predators, setting them up
MySpace, pimps, hoes and sluts
Y'all exploit rap culture, then y'all flip on us
And you own the Post, and y'all shit on us
What is their net worth?
They're going to try to censor my next verse
Throw them off the roof neck first
While I'm clicking my cursor
Reading blogs about pressure they put on Universal
It gets worse
While I'm clicking my mouse, while they kick in my house
They figured us out, why a nigga go south?
It's either he caught a body
Don't sleep, they're watching
I watch CBS, and I see BS
Trying to track us down with GPS
Make a nigga want to invest in PBS (see BS)

But what about Grindhouse and Kill Bill?
What about Cheney and Halliburton?
The back door deals on oil fields?
How is Nas the most violent person?
Y'all don't know talent if it hit you
Bringing up my criminal possession charges with a pistol
I use Viacom as my firearm
Then let the lyrics split you, who do you rely upon?
Then shoot shells at Leviath-o-n
I'm dealing with the higher form
Fuck if you care of how I write a poem
Only fox that I loved was the Red one
Only black man that Fox love is in jail or a dead one
Red rum, political bedlam
Don't let the hype into your eyes and ear drum
Murdoch owns Fox, not A-Team with Baracus
And he hates Barack cause he march with the marches

I pledge allegiance to the fair and balanced truth
Not the biased truth

No revolutionary gets old or so I'm told
You're left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free
Oh, it's a matter of days before they try to take me
I heard gun shots rang; his bullet's got my name
I ain't see 'em take aim, I dreamt this day came
'Cause I stood in the face of damnation
Satan spat at 'em, flat out disgraced 'em
He want my blood, why me?
Why not the fake ones who deserve death, man?
Fuck it, I'll take one, 'cause stop me
But can't stop a whole nation of millions who feel you deceived them
They believe in reparation makes it even
So I'm deadly now because of one reason, they listening
In Budapest, Japan, China, and Switzerland
We getting it in son
Another bullet pass by, missed me
Wondering who plotting to get me?
Alphabet boys still plotting against me
To hush me and stuff me in the pockets of history
You won't remember why they came to clip me
When time go by you'll soon forget me
They say he was the king of bling, jewels, and Bentleys

Got a swell life, tell me will I lose mine?
Every time I turn around somebody new dying
Let's start living, À la carte, Escargot
Escobar, invest my millions
Mansion for the wife, the rest for the children
Knowing that they coming anytime
But until then, i'm at large till they shoot me
Million dollar stones in my camouflaged Gucci
Giving you this crack like Pookie
To question the system, be the resistance
No matter what color you are, everybody niggers
Or you can stand by or watch or you can march on with us

Cause I got more rhymes than a five pound bag of rice
I'm hitting hard, oh word, I'm gon' rock it
Once the shit drops, that's dough to the pocket

You couldn't deal with Scoob if we was playing cards
But if I got beef then it's time for code red
My gun is like a ho, it be taking mad niggas to bed
So hurry up and skedaddle
Even if you join the army, you still couldn't battle
So where you from? England, you somebody great?
You burning Scoob, ""I don't think so mate""

Win lose or draw, I'm booking whores, anyway

Sucking and lucking, hey, niggas I'm ducking, nay
Nada no never meaning ain't no motherfuckin way

Or else get hit with the ultimate, too legit skit

What I just shown ya, real lyrics doggone ya
Look inside my rap book at every text my man
And see that I got, more essays than the Mexican
The Messiah that's feared great, leaving rappers in a weird state
Scared straight, for their prepared fate
Strong as an elephant, intelligent, compelling and elegant
So well in it with every single element

Yuh, my beats are funky and my rhymes are spunky
Sometimes I'll be like ""Well god damn what's the recipe?""

She says ""Go ask your goddamn father!""

Gun on my dresser slang I use upset college professors
More knowledge than Webster dictionary, obituary column plus sign 'em
The first fake rapper murdered for rhyming
The jig is up, gut 'em like fish, Swiss cheese 'em up
My wrist is freezing up, sick of these ducks on my hiatus
Poking out their chest like they tall as sky scrapers
But they small as a shanty in a African village
Soft as cotton candy, we assassins and killers
Let shottie off in club floors, pellets spray your familia
You screaming like you love war

And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get dropped

Killers fuck with killers you sleeping you getting stuck up
Not me, you're not ready I'm low but I be watching
We all connected so your man know my man
Your man knows my fam' they was cool when they was locked up
Beat cases and now niggas back on the block, what
Brothers is taking secret routes when they drive
Tinted windows ears to the street stay on their job
Peep niggas that got prices on their head so high
Their main niggas'll take the contract, surprise
So we play a mental game, intimidation
Got pussy niggas getting pressed up on and paying
I wish these niggas would step up wait for the day and
Since I'm famous they thinking assault rifles won't be spraying
Who ever thinking coming to my vault or the safe
I got some niggas with acid, get it thrown in your face
Play dirty, catch your moms in J-30
Whatever whodie we all crazy we all 7:30 now

Losing My Edge,LCD Soundsystem,"['rock', 'dance', 'alternative']","Yeah, I'm losing my edge
I'm losing my edge
The kids are coming up from behind
I'm losing my edge
I'm losing my edge to the kids from France and from London
But I was there

I was there in 1968
I was there at the first Can show in Cologne
I'm losing my edge
I'm losing my edge to the kids whose footsteps I hear when they get on the decks
I'm losing my edge to the Internet seekers who can tell me every member of every good group from 1962 to 1978
I'm losing my edge

To all the kids in Tokyo and Berlin
I'm losing my edge to the art-school Brooklynites in little jackets and borrowed nostalgia for the unremembered Eighties

But I'm losing my edge
I'm losing my edge, but I was there
I was there
But I was there
I'm losing my edge
I'm losing my edge
I can hear the footsteps every night on the decks
But I was there
I was there in 1974 at the first Suicide practices in a loft in New York City
I was working on the organ sounds with much patience
I was there when Captain Beefheart started up his first band
I told him, ""Don't do it that way. You'll never make a dime.""
I was there
I was the first guy playing Daft Punk to the rock kids
I played it at CBGB's
Everybody thought I was crazy
We all know
I was there
I was there

I've never been wrong
I used to work in the record store
I had everything before anyone
I was there in the Paradise Garage DJ booth with Larry Levan
I was there in Jamaica during the great sound clashes
I woke up naked on the beach in Ibiza in 1988

But I'm losing my edge
To better-looking people
With better ideas and more talent
And they're actually really, really nice
I'm losing my edge

I heard you have a compilation of every good song ever done by anybody. Every great song by the Peech Boys. All the underground hits. All the Modern Lovers tracks. I heard you have a vinyl of every Niagara record on German import. I heard that you have a white label of every seminal Detroit techno hit - 1985, '86, '87. I heard that you have a CD compilation of every good '60s cut and another box set from the '70s

I hear you're buying a synthesizer and an arpeggiator and are throwing your computer out the window because you want to make something real. You want to make a Yaz record

I hear that you and your band have sold your guitars and bought turntables
I hear that you and your band have sold your turntables and bought guitars

I hear everybody that you know is more relevant than everybody that I know

Jigga, Roc-A-Fella y'all
Never sprung huh?
Yeah, peep the repertoire
Pa-Pause, feel me on this one
Pa-Pause, feel this
Never sprung huh? Know my style

[Verse 1]
I love bitches, thug bitches, shy bitches
Rough bitches, don't matter you my bitches
Gold diggers witcha eyes on my riches
Can't knock your hustle for real, it's a'ight bitches
I'm game tight, see it all through the platinum french frames
With the french name in the same night
Pull you and your tight friend
Lift your little dress like light wind, hah, then I slide right in
You know the whole repertoire, U.S. to the U-S-S-R
Sexin' in a Lexus car
Match wits with the best of y'all, the rest of y'all
Is like vege-tables in my presence, check it
Reminiscin' to nothin' you ever heard
Iceberg Slim baby, ride rims through the suburbs
Funds come in lump sums never ends deferred
Get money like I'm down South, Wednesday the third, it's on
[Chorus]
More, dough to get, more shows to rip
I suggest you all roll with the clique, who you wit
Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick
More O's than you know exist, bitch who you wit

[Verse 2]
Can't scheme on 'em, Roc-A-Fella got a team on 'em
Chicks dream on him, trick cream on 'em
Lose it when dudes think it's just music
Lean on 'em, flash green on 'em and diamond rings on 'em
Sexin' around the way girls down to miras
I'm something every girl gotta have like Levi's
Chiquita, mi amor, see how raw
You can love me or hate me, either or
I'ma stay winnin', rock the custom drop Bentleys
Never eat at Denny's and party like Lil' Pennys
Can he live? Trick or main chick but if she leave
Just as quick, Indian give, ha-hah
Now what I look like? Givin' a chick half my trap
Like she wrote half my raps, yeah, I'm havin' that
You be the same chick when you leave me
The bankbook and the credit cards
And take everything you came with (it's on)

Yeah, here's somethin' niggas gon' find, not at all funny
We takin' all ya bitches, takin' all ya money
Jay-Z rated A.G. baby that's All Good
I sink this ball in your hole, I'm Tiger Woods
If the money was the grass and your ass was a tee
When I hit it with this club love you comin' with me
Grip you right up under your ass, put your back on the wall
Kinda tipsy, seein' triple, so I'm fuckin' y'all all
You remind me of this dream I had the night before
I'm kinda hopin' the condom break to have a reason to go raw
I'm playin', hit the showers, hit the money spot
Where all the models play and big money is dropped
Drop the top, let her feel the moonlight it entranced her
She jumped all in my seat like some private dancer
I tell you somethin' new, if you don't hop down off that
Butter soft shit with your shoes, I'ma step on the gas
She laughed, put her ass back in the proper place
She said, 'I played my cards right and look, I got the ace'
I told her *beatboxes*, 'slow down baby'
You dealin' with a baller, who, hold ground crazy, it's on

Slaves,Kano,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook 1: Why Why Peaches]
We could sit around and talk for days
About all the things that we would change
But we never thought we never thought
That we were the slaves

[Verse 1: Kano]
Ah, Runaway runaway underground deep
Release me from these shackles around feet
Old masters they don't own me
Treat artists like sheep
But they don't know me
Rap star rap star, have you any tunes?
Yes sir yes sir, three disks full
One for the radio and one for the states
And one for my people who live down the lane
Can't fool me born free M.I.A
But kill us over time, Ali Boombaye
Puppets on a string, insignificant
As people we've come a long way
But it ain't that different
Money makes the world go round Dead Presidents
Something like a spoon full of sugar to the medicine
Necessary evil, slave to the sterling
They run the world that we all just work in
[Hook 2: Why Why Peaches]
We could sit around and talk for days
About all the things that we would change
But we never thought we never thought
That we were the slaves
We could sit around and talk for days
About all the things that we would change
But we never thought we never thought
That we were the slaves

[Verse 2: Kano]
Look, pawns in the game
We don't make the checkmate
Front line of defense
Thats the modern day slave
Used for consumerism so we get pad
And give it straight back the boomerang play
Win-win for them
Come on folk lose-lose
Programmed like robots
Do what we're told too
The whole worlds singing
The same same song but changes ain't making them
Bracelets blinging
Gold chains swinging
Face tattooed up Lil Wayne tear dripping
Still in prison in this world we live in
So wade in the water children
No master
Escapism through music with no capture
Except the moment because I'll be on a Prince Protest
Before I become a slave bro
I'll be the artist formerly known as Kano
[Verse 3: Why Why Peaches]
After listening to the preacher
It seems that all they ever teach us
Is how to fear and fear it all
Till you fall

[Hook 3: Why Why Peaches]
We could sit around and talk for days
About all the things that we would change
But we never thought we never thought
That we were the slaves
We could sit around and talk for days
About all the things that we would change

Rubber burning, paper rolling, why y'all kill switching?
All about my capital, hold it down, shift keys
Miss me, let’s see, I'm Dr Evil, I'd done ball forever
Take it easy ‘cause these niggas will draw on whatever
And rest in Peace to Aaron Hobson and the nigga ain’t violent
But I carry options ‘cause these niggas be wilding
Believe me bro, cold ass flow is three below
And I got it made without a cleaning ho
No freestyle but this joint is a freebie yo
I dead mic's, no CB4, I'm dead nice
You meanies Joe, where do all the heroes go?
The g-est thing about you is your email bro
CC me with dough that you will forward and I reply with the details yo
But everything else is just considered spam
Throw it in the can when I land ‘cause a nigga going ham

Heroes amongst men, hand me any mic
But have your army manned ‘cause you know I go ham

Going ham, heroes amongst men, yeah, that’s what I am

Skinny denim jeans and a fitted low, brim action
All white vans, you would think that I'm kidnapping
Lyrics cut deeper than my blades in my hands wrapping
Call that flow Hugh Jackman back when I was boom bapping
Shawty came to say is you moving ’cause you packing?
What we need to go ham? A handy cam, a few napkins
Don’t go slower than dancing to a ballad
Up in chains like Alice, getting dressed up by a stylist
And Mr. Chows giving my order, the whores who doubt it
Like I heard you blowing up, Vizzy tell me all about it
Well I got a Caesar, hit a thousand islands and blue cheese
Can you please at least put some dressing on my salad?
Confess and someone tell Clark Kent I'm ‘bout to steal his frames
Flash Gordon shoes and Professor X's plane
Dare Devil sunglasses, Spider-Man first week is what I'm trying to do
When I hit the streets ‘cause my album go ham

[Verse 3: XV]
Yeah, Year of the Squarian, zeroes that's prepared to win
Heroes we keep burying, burn up the charts, this is Nero on the violin
Betting on X is like seeing the whole card deck before buying in
So get your money up, the new cat that be running rap was like a runner up
Guess directions fucked him up, I'm four words that make you
Bring the track backwards on my tape and repped him in
So heavy that no other sideways so 316′s up but I be 619′ing

VERSE 1
It’s the land of top chef recaps and best new party game
I’m on it all the time which could explain why I’m partly lame
I’ll be hittin refresh until the day is over
Cause I need to know what the fuck is up with topher
Even though they don’t get references I make about Tony Romo
Still the best media blog in the world (no promo)
Tell my girlfriend I’ll be late and tell my boss that I am sorry
I spend all day making comments with my friends, what are we?

Don’t let the trolls hurt you
Got mad upvotes for notsewfast and werttrew

Keep your books on the shelf
In don’t matter cause the world is gonna end in 2012

One of my personal preferences
To make a song and fill it up with all inside references
We Monsters

My gifs are so hot that the animation’s got you stunnin
Take you fools for a ride like Jeremy London
I’ll keep taking all my EGOTs on the mantlepiece they shine
Until the day that I retire like Amanda Bynes
I’ma keep posting every single day without rest
Cause you know I gots to win that caption contest
Week’s best comment you know I want to be on you
Time to photoshop more pictures of that sad Keanu
Or make a goop reference because we know that Gwenyth’s lackin
Find a picture of a puppy and then post in on the back end
Keep disrespecting Ke$ha for way long after this track ends
Open up my wallet’s filled with pictures of all of my black friends

CHORUS

Put more posts on this thread
Keep going till it’s filled, yeah that’s what she said

All of you haters out there who want to call us fake and gay
I’m up like Alvin greene shouting “no! Go Away!”
You say you don’t love us but that’s just to be mean and
You’ll probably end up singing along just like keenan
And we can take one for the team like joe mande
While gabe sits there gumming on a butterscotch candy
Get your sad don drapers cause that shit comes in handy
Winning the internet is our modus operandi
It’s dandy how you bring the latest in memes
Combing through detritus on those interweb streams
I depend on Godsauce to be so witty
And I expect Steve Winwood to say that “she’s pretty”
I read y’all so much that I it feels like you’re right there
A day without commenting, THAT is my nightmare
Without y’all I don’t rise like bread without yeast
Yeah I’m a Monster… like mothafuckin huckabeast

-Obviously we have a rapist in Lincoln Park. Lincoln Park
-You are the man now, dog. You are the man now

Sing through the fire
Till the burning is over, is over
Sing to recover
Till the healing is over, is over

[Verse 1: Kano]
Look
I guess I've been homesick
I been on a roadtrip
I've been gone a long time
Lately I've been lonely
They think that they know me
They just know the old me
Stronger than steel, they can't shape me or mould me
Higher than a dope fiend
I'll be floating over
Over the game like Yoda, wiser and older
Hip hop went from parties, to political to vulgar
Vulgar to soulless, money's taking over
So we did it over
Whole new culture
But it went from art, to the hearts, now it's broken
Now we're picking up the pieces
But the thing is when you love it, you can't leave it 'cos you need it
Patient 'cos I treat it, kind of like my treatment
Musical therapy helps me with my healing
When my heart feels heavy or my tears they froze up
I put on a 12 inch and sing till it's over

Sing through the fire
Till the burning is over, is over
Sing to recover
Till the healing is over, is over

Look
Dark Days, hard times
Heartache, can't find
Medicine for my pain gained on the frontline
Battle scars, fight the power
Twenty-four seven, Jack Bauer
Fairytale, save the world
Superhero, Kryptonite
Devil on my shoulder
Don't listen to the voices
Infect you with the poison (the, the, the poison)
Sing through the fire like Chaka Khan, rejoicing
Girls sing, boys sing
Everybody join in

Sing through the fire
Till the burning is over, is over
Sing to recover
Till the burning is over, is over

Said I was your nigga that let you see it all through the fog
Said I was your mans and them

Don't seem to understand that I'm just that bad
The underground rapper who be wrecking
Whatever ya want yo, whatever ya like
[Verse 3: Jus Allah]
Ominous, leave your brain matter painted on your Stainmaster
Game of Death motherfucker, we draft ya, semi-autograph ya
Keeping L's lit, sending pellets through helmets
Shells hit, you and the fag you share a cell with
Taking niggas out their element, rhyme fighters
Divine writers, time travelers, Sliders
Pale niggas act jail lifers
True tale is that they nail-biters with the trails in they diapers
Shoes never walk nor land, explore land
I expose my scrolls and code it in Fortran
Bullets graze your wig kid, brushes with death
I let the iron clutch grip the bones in ya flesh
Playing on ya wrist like strings on a violin
Dying in a blood pool, wrestling Leviathan
Fucking with gods, Jedi Mind Tricks
Y'all suckers, like niggas born without dicks"

Another sacrificial lamb, that died at the hands of Hologram
Send him into the dungeon and bludgeon his fuckin' clan
Holy lamb, Who spit the live shit
The do or die, Illadelph, Jedi Mind shit
The hot shit, live raps crack your jaw
Like who's the avenger, and who's at the center of war?
I left a scar, so your crabs would overstand
Mental will dent you and send you to a holy land
Lawnmower man, sharp blades slash your vitals
Recitals will fight you and entice you to burn bibles
Homicidal, A Hologram burn churches
Murders by stickin' a crucifix through your cervix
Divine purpose, for the Remy that's in my thermos
Greatest evils stick you with needles that's hypodermic
You heard the verdict, I'm with Allah 'cause he chose me
Broke into the Vatican, strangled the Pope with his rosary
What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what...

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]
MCs face terror wherever my sound's audible
Man from third world portals, battle mortals, and slaughter you
Seen inside the visions of beyond
The dwellings of the Om, Existing in Islamic pantheon
Flows drop degrees, all my clothes got the scent of trees
I lay back and blow sax like Kenny G
Power blast, wack on my path, devour fast
I leave you with the grain of sand in life's hourglass
Devise a spell, make demons rise out of hell
Grab you by your lapels and rob you of your outer shell
You feel the ill dire, messiah in hellfire
I launch writers, put your jaw in a gauze wire
Jedi swordsman, give rappers a foul fortune
With science to contortion your body into a coffin
Insane damage is done, you fuckin' with the army
We beat your skull into the shape of a wet bag of laundry
What, yeah, yeah

Yo, the gods are rhymin', they're dramatizin'
You feel the poetic blow of the titans
We like a fuckin' bolt of lightnin'
The three wise men, we at levels that defies men
Watch out for fake heads deviled disguised men
Arriving from the dawn and spawned with ill forms
That'll leave you laying dead in the womb like stillborns
The mass'll here it, the ominous, the master spirit
Can't understand the language of rappers with bad lyrics
Ikon the python, rappers are left strangled
I overlook the Earth 'cause I see it from sun's angle
Above the clouds, we sit high and we dazed
Write a page, on how you enslaved to worldly ways
Islamic marksmen, seein' the squadron
Could be a fatal mistake
Like the first sins of Adam in the Garden
You feel sorrow, I'm projected as god Apollo
Explore rhymes, you're left too confused to follow
Invite your town to absorb the sniper rounds

Stayin' underground, What!

New Ghostface!

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Yo deep in the trenches
Wig, young black green beret
Chrome laser guns blazing at spades
Wallabies, cherry noose, kool-aid
10 niggas call it Tai-Chi
Black blades, one hundred dollar seats
Hold up, we at the opera, Queen Elizabeth rub on my leg
Had ketchup on her dress from a whopper
Chunky ass necklace, must be her birthstone
John Paul cop the biggest stones outta Rome
So Charles, eyes up on her prince, fucking with Diana
Two rows across, Dirty giving hickeys to Vianna White
Fingering Pamela Lee, we on the balcony
Dare one of y'all to Malcolm X me
Somebody might catch a Kennedy
Yo let me adjust my lens through these binoculars
I paid 5 g's sliding off like Kid Vitamin
Viking, patriot of Broad Street
Bet you think I'm laying like a hyphen
[Verse 2: RZA]
Tony Starks make the narc's dogs bark
With the Benz parked, up against the boulevard
Starks had the bone sparked
One cop tapped the window glass like a cymbal crash
""What the fuck son! You trying to break glass?""
He flashed his badge; ""License and registrations""
At that moment, his fat partner started chasin'
Chicken heads they was racing wit' they hearts pacin'
For snatching gold, trying' to dip into the god's basement
Our location, lead steel shed spread
Cracked shorty head, left sweetie there for dead
Ghetto poodles, fingers sticky from cheese doodles
Starving' for a 50 cent bag of Oodles and Noodles
Neighborhood sick wit' it, Clinton 'bout to cut WIC
Maybe one ya'll rich rap niggas need to politick
Reach for the sky, they throw bleach in your eye
Don't teach you why, you be keeping 'em high
Dipped like an Oreo cookie in cold milk, bold silk
Gold-filled cap, Wu wear hat, low tilt
True Islamic, we speak verbal rhyme phonics
Why ya'll trying to change this hip hop to technotronics?

Don't go against the grain (the grain)
Don't go against the grain (the grain)
Don't go against the grain (the grain)

Girl, because of you I'm hurting
Within my, within my heart
I know it's not right to be flirting
But a relationship has to start
You're the one that I'm clocking
It's time for you to start jocking
Don't want you to see me cry
This is why this is why this is why

[Coda: RZA &  Ghostface Killah]
I met this girl named Rhonda from way down yonder
Hey yo god don't fuck with her
I met this girl named Liz she was all in the biz
Hey yo lord don't fuck with her
I rocked a ho named Tina from the heart of Medina
Hey yo kid don't fuck with her
Yea that girl Kit Kat, she got the good poody-cat
Hey yo nigga you better fuck with her!"

Just to get some work, ain't no telling where I'm gonna be next
Out there doing dirt, now my momma need a Kleenex
Could have been me, I hit the reset
Still, the meals from a deal leave me appealed
Out for Will Smith money that I can leave in my will
My nigga Kareem in jail, I hope he get his appeals
That's a reset button for real
And I'm still
Seeing the glass half full, they notice it
Eviction notices, soon as I put my two week notice in
My boss working like, ""I hope that you blow up then""
If not I hit the reset button...go again
Scared of your goals, cause what if you don't achieve it
So college is where you go, but one day you got to leave it
The Grim Reapers feeling, one day, you're going to meet it
So just live everyday like that day you're going to see it
Me and this dude I knew well
Skipping school, trying to be cool
Two losers so we're rolling up two l's
Never got on board to our dreams going into full sail
So you know what to do well

My rhymes make you pay attention like you're Ritalin
There's a thin line between a savage and a gentleman
I never tire, hit the road like a Michelin
And if I stop, then I begin again
Making a profit because I'm cutting out the middleman
I'm giving him a ticket because he's loitering and littering
He got the game messed up
All twisted and contorted, so it's more important who you consider fam
I used to want a deal
But now I want my freedom
These industry motherfuckers, I don't fucking need 'em
Matter of fact, they need me
The problem with their business model deeper than the scratches on your CD
I see these rappers still sleeping, I call them Ambien
Consider me a beast, the epitome of a champion
This the World Series
I'm Mr. October

Ex-girl tripping
Next girl wishing that she could do everything that my ex-girl didn't
My next girl trying to tell my next ex something
They both got that reset button
The first taste of fame
I splurged on a chain, like a 1,000 DVDs and a car in my name
A bunch of friends, a bunch of haters, it all is the same
Once I watch it all go...never saw when it came
Dang
But I don't wanna get into that
Thinking back to my crew when I first started spitting raps
Drugs put us up and real stuff, I wish it didn't black
Reset and let me get it back
My son growing up
Seeing him calling me daddy
Through all the opposition I can still look at him proudly
And tell him all the things I wouldn't be without him
Brought those sunny days out me when they swore it would be cloudy
Can't wait to tell him stories about, me and his mother
And how I'd only reset to get his twin brother
What would he have to like? I wonder
But live's good, I never want another
And never hit the reset button

Just hit the reset button
Hit the reset button
Just hit the reset button

Tighten up, your team starting to let up
Assembly need to get it together
I remember there was days I wasn’t able to change clothes
Now I never wear the same clothes
Same goes for my bad bitch, rich and her accent thick
But her ass ain't, she’ll carry my last name
Still a step I’ll never miss, I’m on this cash chase

Tu estás actuando en una manera muy mala
Bien mala y no me importa ya, yeah, so I gotta let you know
Let 'em know. Here we go, dígale a la gente, B
Gotta let you know for real. Son drop that

Siempre me encuentro con la mujer equivocada
A superficial mami con la alma comprada
Yo I'm sick of stupid chicks que hablan de nada
Let's go to my house conversación acabada
Yeah we can fuck but you gotta go after mañana
You walking bowlegged porque te deje clavada
Don't ever talk shit about niggas and get enojada
There's a reason that you never been properly amada
Cause you fuck niggas and suck dick como si nada
Para la porquería and save the drama
Don't come to the fucking club con una actitud mala
You've been drinking too much Bacardi and smoking lala
Escúchame señorita, if you don't respect yourself
Don't expect respect from anyone else
Don't expect an hombre to support you with wealth
Go to college and be successful, do it for delf
Nunca vas a ser shit without knowledge of self
Mamis with cultural ineptitude are bad for your health
That's the type of mujer that I put back on the shelf
And go back to the packed crowd to look for somebody else
Adiós, check it

We keep it moving properly
No me importa lo que haces, ain't no way of stopping me

I'll sacrifice a puto cabrón for running his mouth
Carjack and kidnap you in front of your house
And while you tied up riding shotgun while I'm driving down south
I'll push the pedal to setenta and kick you the fuck out (Fuera)
Solamente to look back and have something to laugh about
I doubt you really want Technique as an enemigo
Fuck with me I'll make your people turn up desaparecido

And the last shall be
First to immerse in the pass out heat
Face in the mud where the moxie melt
'Till he woke up drowning in tchotchke hell
More in a cave with a torch on the wall
Than a window arrangement of porcelain dolls
On a brand new day, saw what he saw
Property owners who crawl to the mall
With a bad toupee and a face like he author the law
Pace like he mourning a loss
Right hand on a can of worms
Left full of gold he will trade for turf, I mean
That's ok, you got to answer to you at the end of the volatile day
But a model of mercy and might, no way
Marionette who will clap and obey
Dude, look, all that noise
Call that flight of the water boys
Meet and greet and they all slap five
Cheek to cheek when they colonize
And a grown-ass man shall abide as he wish
Walk that path with a dime and a stick
Walk that path with a diamond and wine
Walk that path to the firing line
Just walk, pay no mind
To the new recruit with the play-doh spine
Let's be friends from opposite ends
Wave to the kid don't hop on the fence
Play to the radius far and away
Orbit wide don't park in his space
One little martyr who talk in his face
Make one little Weathermen sharpen the blades

And the last shall be
First to the curb with the mad cow meat
Face in the bars of a regular cell
When he woke up high in collectible hell
Boom town kid who was taught by the binge
That a man who expire with the most shit win
That's warpy American nonsense penned by the rich
Not a routine friend in a pinch
Still not used to the stench
How it throws off otherwise lucid events
In the case the afraid observe
I got a Pro-Keds box full of layman's terms, it goes
Hey, peace, pray for the plagued
Major relief and capacious rains
But just cuz I don't want to war with you
It don't mean go warm up the barbecue
I'm like pardon you, sawed off limit
My high noon is a quick little minute
I don't wanna spend it sitting with a critic
Who simply isn't going to ever really get it
This HQ is alive and alone
No driveway no sign of a home
No dial tone, no line for the phone
No world's tiniest violin song
And I might just lie to them all, lie in the morgue
With a deep breath hiding and bored
Fighting a smile, highly annoyed
When the timing is right I will rise and record
Call for the monster beats and Blockhead got
Animal drums like he's doctor teeth
It goes red light green light 1 2 3
One large coffee, fuck you, peace

Purple and Gold, homie let the story be told
It’s the city where you shoot your favourite television episode
And you can hit the strip, Sunset Boulevard
But you gotta have a Low-rider car
With the skirts dragging, with the plaque in the back flaggin’
Or put it in the back of the Chevy Wagon
That’s how we represent it though
Birthplace of Chevrolet ’64
Yeah I love showing it out
First things first my nig’, you better know where you at
You in…

LA, Sunset boulevard, Pacific Highway
Out to the walk of stars now you in Cali
Don’t go ‘less you go hard
Go ‘less you go hard

Hollywood, Downtown and back
Life is always good
It’s not an act we so fresh, so hood
You knew that it never would
Knew that it never would

Riding on the 405
On my way to pick up baby
85 in the winter time
Man, this place is crazy
I love it, love it, love it, love it
Southern surfer Cali

[Snoop Doog - Verse 2]
Rollin’ down Fairfax
Just left the Nico, bust a left turn on Pico
Gotta see the Bishop, he got me some gator shoes
I’m rollin’ to Hollywood, I’m doing the house of blues
About 9 o clock stop by the record shop
And get that new Snoop Dogg, now we bouncing ball
Life is a mystery, my life is like history
Stop by my dispensary
Give me some kush and pusha
Put it in the trunk, smelling like some skunk
But it’s all legal in LA
Everybody taking a hit from the politicians
Athletes and even the teachers
My dentist even hit it, Dr Beecher
He say “Snoop Dogg I really wanna meet ya”
Yeah, I love showing you now
First things first, my nig’ you better know where you at
You in…

Out to the walk of stars now you in Cali
Don’t go ‘less you go hard

Beer cans and cigarette butts cover the floor day
Half gone, he sleeps scared pregnant teen in the doorway
Watching him sleep clutchin' her belly, little feet kick
To send the teen back to the toilet, spent her last week sick
When little Billy feed her ground up Jesus powder
Would've beat her louder if it would've pushed the fetus out of her
Father in the making, crooked M.P. forsaken
The military cop that sells H to bring his cake in
She shaking, praying her labor kicks in before
The doors kicked in for them brown bricks on the floor
I mean, she could tell you exactly how the gutter taste
Father to her kid in custody right when her water breaks
Snitched on his compadres for a few more runs
And the irony in giving a stuffed rat to his newborn son
Dishonorably discharged, no jail time in court
Told to pack his family up and go the fuck back to New York

[Hook]
Fuck Bill Murray, not the actor, the deadbeat dad that smacked her
Then left her with rats after he snapped her
The bastard inventor that bent her backwards in winter
With her back against the wall, she can hear death singing in her
With her back against the wall, she still head death singing in her
[Cage]
She's scared to leave him, convinced somehow she really needs him
Back in New York her prison of pain and Billy's freedom
Holdin' her baby, he'd say crazy shit to break her
When she fell asleep, he'd escape her wit's end and wouldn't wake her
He'd sneak out to wallow in it role model to shit
That put his Christian scientist father in debt
Gave him his first stroke, he refused his medication
Cause it went against his religion, he'd rather his lord take him
Through stroke number two and start withering his flesh
Then lay the emaciated world war two veteran to rest
Left his family debt turmoil and wreckage
And his grandson to scatter his ash over the U.S. Intrepid
Then little Billy plummets to his knees, still numb from it
Held his kid by the arm with a shotgun to his stomach
When threats to destroy what he created get tucked away
When he looks in his son's face to see he might grow up to say

[Hook]

[Cage]
Needle through the skin again, inject the rust and cinnamon
Pull off the tourniquet, load up the shotgun and sentence him
He knows that there's a bed in hell waitin for him
But he ain't been sane since he started huffin chloroform
With his shit decorum, he lets off shots, the neighbors say shooters
Into the phone to Middletown police and state troopers
While every family member on the premises runs from death
Greeted by dozens of officers with guns and vests
His suicide by cop sweater on get low
Is told to the crowd watching him shoot thru the window
His son clutched in his mother's arms, unaware it's the end
They bring him out in handcuffs but never to be seen again

When I was a little kid, my mother told me not to stare into the sun. So once when I was six, I did. The doctors didn't know if my eyes would ever heal. I was terrified, alone in that darkness. Slowly, daylight crept in through the bandages, and I could see, but something else had changed inside of me

[Verse 1: Mr. Lif]
I'm the fire bearer, holder of the sun
The earth and the universe combined as one
An everlasting energy taking all forms
Blue skies on sunny days, terrible storms
The one who tears down what you adorn
And curses the material things that you mourn
But look up in the sky because I am the dawn
And the light that empowers your flesh as you yawn
Strong, undeniably so, Lif better known as a society foe
The deity glow reach into my center
I bet you feel pleasure and pain as you enter
The tormentor, pleaser, embracer, squeezer
As your skeleton crush, your physical turns into gelatin, plus
Due to over stimuli, you liquify
I send you back to the earth soil to quench the turmoil
When the ground splits to swallow of corporations and cops
Give birth to rocks so we can have solid ground on which to walk
Stand strong and talk and write down theories in chalk on the side walk

My style orbits round nine planets of forces
Ominous metaphorics envision a devil corpses
Lion hoarder, mad scientist slash author
Present the type of horror that boils your holy water
Get warped with the knowledge that folds the holy father
Hard boys become toys inside the real saga
So why bother, my whole floor alliance is harder
So bring the drama, we all know that science is smarter
I set off crowds, style wild like a circus
I seek new souls when I walk past churches
Allah praise you, stay true to a devout purpose
Seeking out the wise wherever the God searches
Flows that I embark on leave your squadron shadow dodging
Lyrics assault men like slugs that fill harkness
No option, narrow odds
Fucking with gods is straight gambling with your tarot cards

Open the gates of Midian for the fangs like the flesh
Three cyborgs who Bang like Ladesh
We hang the best, spit venom until your face burn
Yet the critics are parasitic like a tape worm
The hate burn, scathe the nerve of a Buddhist
Snake turn and fake yearns; the kiss of Judas
We take lives with knives steady abusing you
With the vicious intentions of denting your uvula
Bruising you with text of a Harvard class
Ikon will smash into shards of glass
To reform into a whirlwind of sand
Then reborn into the world Hologram
A solemn man with plans to entwine matter
Minds splatter from the grind of my divine hammer

I built with Alexander the Great, he told the Persians they should stay gone
Then he told me about the Oracle of Ammon
He gave me no clue where it is
Men feared time yet time feared the pyramids
He gave me more jewels
He told me that Amenhotep was immortal
I can't overstand hieroglyph
So I called Killah Priest and he taught me how to follow it
I walked through the Valley of the Kings
With a white robe, white rose and Muwali rings
And your whole team Judas
My road thin, gold skin like Zeus'
I speak the dialog of the dead
I practiced the same war tactics in King Arthur's head
So let the swordsmen kill the beast
It's a Legacy of Blood with Vinnie Paz and Killah Priest

Red ink from saint blood, nigga you ain't thug
Stare into the face of a king's mug, crushed grape fill the wine jug
Ill thoughts build from the mind of rhyme, rose off the tongue like fine rugs
Let me walk you through this for the clueless
I'm Shakespearean with gray earrings
Speak like Tiberius, write novels
Spit it like Aristotle, face half Pharaoh
And half owl, I took the path of Cairo
Came back with the Dead Sea Gospel
Now known as the Dead Street Apostle
We see them Feds, shoot them hollows
Bullets spread till they meet Diablo
Stars in alignment, Priest meet with Jedi Mind Tricks
Reach them climates where you can't breath
Stay high off that dead weed
In the mind is where I plant seeds to grow fruit
Of king's so brute of army troops, mighty men in celestial suits
You need healing, my mic give you incredible boost
Where I use satellite dish and stare at my alphabetical soup
Plus I use the Big Dipper to take more than one scoop
It's Priesthood

You don't wanna see desert eag' heat pop you

Walk back to the sand of Iraq and let the prophet breathe
We turned all our water into toxic seas
And walk in war with armor that I copped in Greece
Then I shot the beast with a long arrow
Studied Imhotep to be a strong Pharaoh

Compel the skeptic when Kamachi unveil the epic
It's needed and requested
Brought to you like Elijah in the message
A jury of ancestors was sequestered
To decide my fate, for conductors of viscous vespers
Candlelight death is extras
Is usually hollow point flesh presses
Until they skin caress stretchers
I'm the best to finesse textures
My rhyme fabric, is elaborate, scrolls kept in a gold cabinet
Open the book to the chapter of this old soul magic
Juju tongue to voodoo come, behold this untold havoc
Up north grab it, then I hit the south pole with a magnet
East and west avid, now my name on all four points of the square
It's firmly established, the language is lavish
First to rock Roshashannah's and African pajamas
Swear before I die to be there with the best of the rhymers

I burn leaf with Ikon and the Chief nigga
This next bud is not for you
Watching you made me land a clenched hand to your nostril
Stopping you from giving the god cold stares

None are prepared when the holocaust begins
You'll have the roach smoked down to the sole of your Timbs

They say the odds against me are crooked and impossible
Like I was born with a hole in my heart as an obstacle
I was left to die by the doctors in the Children's Hospital
But I never lose hope, success is psychological
The world is volatile and the street is my education
Shapin' the nation, like the blueprint of a Mason
While Shawshank record deals get you raped on occasion
So I'm focused on my economic situation
I'm like the little kids on TV that dig through the trash
I hustle regardless of the way you talk shit and laugh
A lot of niggas drop science, but they don't know the math
Because their mind is narrower than the righteous path
It's funny how on the block niggas will kill you for cash
But never raise the gun and cry out, ""Freedom at last!""
The cold war is over, but the world is still gettin' colder
Atlas walkin' through the projects, with the hood on my shoulders
I would like to raise my children to grow to be soldiers
But then a general will decide when their life would be over
So I work hard until my personality's split
Like the Black Panthers, into the Bloods and the Crips
They said I would never be shit, but now I sit and reminisce
Like Yeshua ben Yusef flippin' through Genesis
Ignorance is venomous, and it murders the soul
Spreadin' like a virus, runnin' rampant, out of control

So if the solution has never been to look in yourself
How is it that you expect to find it anywhere else?

Immortal Technique in the streets, back on the hustle
‘Cause three strikes will get you life for stuffin' cracks in a duffle
Upstate, behind steel gates, attacked in a scuffle
Razor blades stuck on the side of pencils hacked through your muscle
But the emptiness is what bleeds you to death when it cuts you
And it's the lawyers, not the inmates, schemin' to fuck you
Tryna fight the system from inside eventually corrupts you
But that's what you get when you put a corporation above you
And it's the people that love you that seem to hurt you the most
Sometimes when they die, you find yourself cursin' their ghost
But you make success, nobody delivers your fate
Sometimes you give and you take
Since prehistoric vertebrates crawled out of the lakes
And that's the truth about life
Or to do it to ghetto and your car, rims, and your ice
'Cause even though we survived through the struggle that made us
We still look at ourselves through the eyes of people that hate us
But I'm going to make it regardless of the trumped up charges
And semi-automatic barrages that empty the cartridge
Post-traumatically scarred kids that try to be brave
Because niggas backstab each other just to try to get paid
Turn cannibal, like knights during the crusades
Afraid of responsibility, addicted to greed
Beatin' their girl, purposefully losin' a seed
As if we were bound to the destiny we used to receive
[Hook]
So if I should ever fall and get caught in the hustle
Let them know that I died while I fought in a struggle
From the hoodrats to the rich kids lost in a bubble

The mind of a child is where the revolution begins
So if the solution has never been to look in yourself

I Am Hip Hop Move the Crowd,Deep Puddle Dynamics,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Sole]
Well it's 7:45, oh yeah, we'll see who's the bigger man
Other dead men walking- 4 PM, I heard a dead man talking
He said it's inconsequential, forget it- it's nice
I'll always get into harlots Ville with this knife, get away
I don't want to buy you a drink, forget to piss on your pride, little girl
Yeah stepped on your feet, you want to eat that dirty white how what ya looking at
The cap bartender, tender me some sex on the beach
Before I reach out and impediment your speech
Once I get 'em in my reach, unprecedented impeach
He saw a double crossed dance illuminated by disco lights
Unseen unspoken in a scene provoking a thought provoking scene
In a smoke scene interrupted by intervening disco lights
Ain't nobody dancing, ain't no music everybody still
I can only see one man, he looks good enough to kill
So I must muscle my way through dustless of imposers
10:30 to ten feet away, five fingers surround the object of intrusion
I don't need to see his eyes, I feel his jacket, then his shirt
Then his skin, then his kidneys, then out
Then blood ,then blood, then blood
Then neck, then blood, then blood, then blood
Chest, then I see his girl watching over him
Like she is gonna cry his little ass back to life
This is my only way I know, so I must remove the knife
We eye to eye now, goodbye to his life
Fool, I told you I would get my five dollars back tonight
[Verse 2: Slug]
Another night (night), another dollar (dollar)
Another crowd I've enlisted to make holler (now scream)
Another I really wish this crowd was a little bit larger
Excuse me mister promoter, could I bother you for a couple of bottles
Of premiums placed on the stage for me and my brethren?
You know beverages, intoxication balance and leverage
Guessing this is that point where I grab the mic and make my point
Kick my flow make 'em say hoo (hoo!), blow the lid off the joint
Ahem, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
And then they befriended, I love it when this situation happens
This the type of crowd that build self esteem
Come 10:30 is was I finally felt that sting

[Interlude: Slug & (Doseone)]
Yo yo yo yo (he's got a knife)
Yo what the fucks going on right here
Calm the fuck down calm that shit down (that's blood)
Check check get 'em up get off get off

[Hook: Slug]
I shed another blood, you knew I would, I feel you should
Adapt can't run forever, trapped death stepped up
To shed another blood, you knew I would, I feel you should
Adapt can't run forever, trapped death stepped up to
[Verse 3: Doseone]
Sorry, just alcohol
Thanks, anyhow- its just been one of those days- alcohol only?
How can you not sell fucking cigarettes at a bar? (Excuse me)
But I wonder where those two wild women are
I've gotten off one minute they're all ears and big eyes
Then they're wandering off
To bark up the next man's tree (Excuse me!)
Thank you Jesus Christ this place is...
Now that's a foxy young lady
If she'd only put some clothes on, (excuse) enough
I’ll stay put and just vend in the meat market hmmm hmmm hmmm
Who are these?- that shit's pretty dope
But I can hardly hear his vocals and the bass is too loud
Actually this kid's nasty
Too bad I can't hear the words (excuse me!)
Damn like he couldn't have just walked pass- oh and the stare too
See everybody want to show you
How big their and how little they think
I be if- that's the chick Jim was trying to get on- she's alright
Man it's hot as balls in here, why did I wear this?
(screaming) He's got a knife, is that blood
Oh my God I've never been this
That's blood he's dying, gone

[Verse 4: Alias]
Oh my God, twisting and turning, what's that sensation of burning
Yearning to witness some spoken words but now I'm learning
That I can't step into the outer limits of my abode without
Kids acting hard staring glaring, yes I'm in the daring mode
My girl debated me going out at this nocturnal time
She said I should just chill, stay in the house and write a rhyme
I disagreed and ventured out, totally against all of her wishes
Stated that if I went to this particular venue, I would later be needing stitches
But my manhood in the need to ease my mind has forced me out
To check and see what this up-and-coming lyricist is all about
Arrived at the show at 9:45 and they're saying these kids are live
Waited in line to pay my fee to take my entrance to this dive
Already performing up on stage, these kids outside smoke deuce
The rhymesayer had the crowd by the balls while up in the DK booth
Final manipulation is complex in the body of its sound
Mesmerized in higher elevated on the shoulder, I feel a pound
My right side and his right side connected accidental
He's staring in my vision and taking, said something about knocking out dentals
Then strided out slowly, I paid no attention to his words
Cuz pursuing any challenge by forth at this point would be absurd
I saw no familiar faces in the sea of goatees and baseball caps
Which is fine with me, cause this ocean is filled with mindless saps
Just then I heard a scream behind me, there was quite a commotion
I felt something tap my back once, then repeated in this motions
Oh my God twisting and turning, what's that sensation of burning
Yearning to just witness some spoken word but now I'm learning
I should have listen to my girl when she spoke up and debated
If I had then, my body and soul would not be separated (oh my God!)
[Hook: Slug]
I shed another blood, you knew I would, I feel you should
Adapt can't run forever, trapped death stepped up
To shed another blood, you knew I would, I feel you should
Adapt can't run forever, trapped death stepped up
To shed another blood, you knew I would, I feel you should
Adapt can't run forever, trapped death stepped up
To shed another blood, you knew I would, I feel you should
Adapt can't run forever, trapped death stepped up
To shed another blood, you knew I would, I feel you should
Adapt can't run forever, trapped death stepped up
To shed another blood, you knew I would, I feel you should
Adapt can't run forever, trapped death stepped up
To shed another
I feel you should"

Yo, son, I just seen five fiends around a nigga, son

[Intro: Raekwon]
It's the remix, son
Can it be, act like you know
Check it

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, check what happened out of state
I'm knocking off a half-a-cake, cash rule, flying at a fast rate
I smoked the black dust, kept my hands clutched, I'm falling in lust
Spoiled plus I played my hand like a royal flush
Baggy jeans, Wallabee Clarks, pretty women
I put it in 'em, shot up in 'em, deadly venom
I hung around the big time bosses
Illegal force to exchange thoughts, showing love to all my sources
Spades tried to bag me, like Cagney and Lacey
Chef had that bitch Stacey slippin' in Macy's
I doze off, catch a flashback on how I got trapped
And got licked like Papsy in a mob flick, I got hit
Stumbling, holding my neck to the God's rest
Opened flesh, burgundy blood colored my Guess
Emergency trauma, black teen headed for surgery
Can it be an out of state nigga tried to murder me?
I should've stayed in Job Corp, and now I'm a outlaw
Ray Catena, carry a four-four, nigga

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah & Raekwon]
Can it be that it was all so simple then? (Dedicated to the Gods and Earths)
Dedicated to babies who came feet first
Can it be that it was all so simple then? (Dedicated to up north and down state)
Dedicated to rich niggas who sell weight
Can it be that it was all so simple then? (Dedicated to projects with black kids)
Dedicated to man who build pyramids
[Interlude: Raekwon]
Word up, what the f— yo
We taking you on another chamber
Word up, son, you know how we be on it
Yeah, it's real
Show these crabs how to rhyme, man
I think it's time to bless them, word up
Bulletproof
First chamber (Hit 'em, Chef), yo, yo

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
It started off on the Island, AKA Shaolin
Niggas wilding, old folks scream, ""Stop the violence!"" (The violence)
True, laying up, yo, watching these crack niggas
Play enough crap games for what? See
Back in days, crime pays in mad ways
Sporting Tommy Hil' with caves, three-sixty waves
And no searching for loose ends, now I flex 300 Benz
Mad Timbs with mad diamonds
Now that's the life of the good life, sometimes niggas act trife
I paid the price throughout my hood life
Remember, I got blasted, now that's in the past kid
God forbid I lay in the casket
But now I'm all about G-notes, no time for weed mixed with coke
I wash my mouth out with soap
And got my act together, 'Lo sweaters and better
And phat leathers, so whatever, bring it on
[Chorus: Raekwon]
Can it be that it was all so simple then? (For real, murderous material stacked up)
Can it be that it was all so simple then? (Peace to mazes, for real)
Can it be that it was all so simple then? (Meditatin' off life)
Can it be that it was all so simple then? (Go)
Can it be that it was all— (Word up, y'all, crazy fly dedications to my people)
(Word up, peace to all my brothers)
—all so simple then? (That I ain't gon' see no more)
Can it be that it was all so simple then? (Peace to all the brothers on the Island, up north, word up)
Can it be that it was all so simple then? (Straight up, love you, boy)
Can it be that it was all so simple then? (It's on like that, word up)

[Outro: Raekwon]
Peace to man, woman and child
Word up (We got you covered, baby)
Projects (We're here for you)
Projects peoples, one love
Keep your head clear, we outta here
Move in silence
Bad boys creatin' the murderous stacks for your headpiece
Bald heads, braids (For real, though)
Blowouts (The Island)
Yo, fly chicks
It's the remix, y'all, for real, the real side
(The RZA, check it) Razor blade sharp
Peace to the Clan
No other producer can compare, boy
Word up
Bring it, battle, beats, all types of shit
For real, y'all"

Yo, straight out the ghetto, I'm damn hood
I stack a dollar like a whole rack of canned goods
Baggy jeans, no Timbs, ACG boots
Livin' in the crack spot, bangin' that Sheek Louch
The narcotics is far from garbage
Whether it's cold or it's late August
My shit is fresh cuz I catch the hottest
My little cousin bubble swatches and carry a couple oxes
Keep a deuce deuce by his ankle and get it poppin'
You know, we be the boys clockin' the graveyard shift
Big bubbles, countin' the cream, burnin' the lazar spliff
My man jumps out the whip with the AR 5th
And we ball from plenties of parties, 'cause we start shit
Parole holes, six months in the box
My little sister got her head shaved off
She made it home from shock
We sellin cartons, Pampers, Similac formula
Anything you take because the paper keep callin ya
Gangsters keep ballin fosho, we want more
We make it rain from the tech and the wop
The next coroner priests don't have enough cups for us
To slow us up, they hit us with dusk
Then they rush-bust, my man Big Ron will break the cuffs
300 pound nigga, po-po has to fuck him up
They say that my projects should undergo therapy
We never voted, we votin' for Oprah, Obama, and Eric B
[Verse 2: Solomon Childs]
Guns imported from Duval
Wheelchairs and shit bags
Peach Snapples and pretty scalpels, renaissance
I'll stick a pick in ya gut at the chapel
I'll blow a nigga for a box of Huggies
Cop-killers with a box of dummies
Dummies, stuck to the project floors
Niggas is suited up and we ready for war

It's the Broad Street Bully and the Killah with no Face
My mac bullets burn like tequila with no chase, yeah!
My knife work like the guillotine sword, cutting niggas
Stop frontin' for my killa bee swarm, something
Empty out the whole clip and reload
Shotgun barrel leave it smoking like a broke stove
Yeah, and I'm all about that bullshit
The casket, the hearse, and the pastor in the pulpit
I kill a nigga at the drop of a dime
Just imagine what I'd do for a quarter
Ain't no tellin what I'd do for a dollar
Pop a nigga right in front of his mama
Son a nigga right in front of his daughter
And I'm nothing like your father
You couldn't come from these nuts I got
And C. Baltimore sucked this cock
I know most of y'all wouldn't understand
Get it? Understand?
Yeah some niggas will and some niggas won't
Like some niggas kill and some niggas don't (uh-uh)
You's a fake-it-'til-you-make-it of nigga
I'm a straight-up-take-it type of nigga
Pistol-whip-a-nigga-'til-I-break-it type of nigga
I'm hard on chumps, most of these dudes is fags
Put the guarder on pumps, push the broom up they ass
Or the knife like American me, American Sig' is Muslim
So I ain't feelin Bush overseas
I think with the wisdom of Malcolm, got the soul of a Panther
So by any means is the anthem

I wake up early in the mornin', mind state so military
Suckers fantasizin' pictures of a young brother buried
Was it me, the weed or this life I lead?
If daytime is for suckers then tonight we breathe
Out for all that, knowin' that this world bring drawbacks
Look how they shiver once I deliver these raw raps
Meet me at the cemetery, dressed in black
Tonight we honor the dead, those who won't be back
So, if I die, do the same for me, shed no tears
An outlaw thug livin' in this game for years
Why worry? Hope to God, get me high when I'm buried
Knowin' deep inside only a few love me
Don't rush me to the gates of Heaven
Let me picture for a while, how I lived for my days as a child
I wonder now, how do we outlast?
Always get cash, stay strong if we all mash; hold ya head!

These felonies be like prophecies
Beggin' me to stop ‘cause these
Lawyers gettin' money every time they knock us
Snatchin' pockets lyrically, suckers flee when they notice
Switched my name to Makaveli, half the rap game ghost
Exposed foes with my hocus-pocus flows, they froze
Now suckers idolize my chosen blows
And mo' money mean litigatin', mo' playa hatin'
Got a cell at the pen' for me waitin'—is this my fate?
Miss me with that misdemeanor thinkin', me fall back?
Never that, too much Tequila drinkin', we all that
Make them understand me? Hell nah, this ain't my posse
Everyone with me is family, ‘cause everybody's got me
Watch me paint a perfect vision, this life we livin'
Got us all meetin' up in prison
Last week I got a letter from my road dog, written in blood
Sayin', ""Please show a playa love""—hold ya head! (Hold it!)

You got to hold ya head!

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
God bless the child that can hold his own
Indeed, enemies bleed when I hold my chrome
Let these words be the last to my unborn seeds
Hope to raise my young nation in this world of greed
Currency means nothin' if you still ain't free
Money breeds jealousy, take the game from me
I hope for better days, trouble comes naturally
Runnin' from authorities 'til they capture me
And my aim is to spread mo' smiles than tears
Utilize lessons learned from my childhood years
Maybe Mama had it all right, rest yo' head
Tradin' conversations all night, bless the dead
To the homies that I used to have that no longer roll
Catch a brother at the crossroads
Plus nobody knows my soul, watchin' time pass
Through the glass of my drop-top Rolls; hold ya head!

Verse One: Ghostface

Wally champ so amazin, the suede shoelacin
Up in the Sheraton, just got hit for five years probation
I got a dental appointment at two o'clock there go my gold ring
Much later catch a flick or go hoeing
Yo there's somethin heavy on my mind from last night's crime
Spoonface shot Gel in the back with Kiv's nine
It was two men, tighter than a hiker with Tims
Like blood brothers, problem was they lust each other woman
For instance, Gel seen Spoon in DeMoore
He wet his whiz(tle), got his seed an headin towards the door
They came out of eye, face to face, they embraced
Gel blew a kiss and looked Spoon girl in the face
Her face lit up, and grinned with a smile like what?
That sneaky f--k, same bitch that got my man hit up
Out in Brownsville, where the thug life live to kill
Where bodies is worth two for five cause it's real
Fast life...
Fast life, cause there's nowhere I can go
Fast life, that's the only thing I know
Fast life, cause there's nowhere I can go
Fast Life, that's the only life I know

Verse Two: Andre Rison

Yo my man got more power than gunpowder with ammunition
Blowin up the fireworks and the n----z ambitions
On the come up, she gettin done up, behind closed doors
Doin freaky s--t, on elevator floors
I want her, like Sonny wanted Cher
She was his diamond piece, sex wasn't for lease
Rest in peace, somebody came up deceased
R.I.P. on that grave of the slave of infatuated ways
God couldn't save
F-A-K-E, L-O-V-E
Fake love you see
Never lasting through eternity
Living life in the fast lane
The fast life... it's the fast life
Fast life

Fast life, cause there's nowhere I can go
Fast life, that's the only thing I know
Fast life, cause there's nowhere I can go
Fast Life, that's the only life I know

And though the words sound steady, something empty's within them
We say yeah, with fists flying up in the air

'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear

I thought it felt right, but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on
And I don't even know what kind of things I said
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
So, I'm picking up the pieces now, where to begin
The hardest part of ending is starting again
[Outro: (Chester Bennington) Mike Shinoda]
(All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got)

This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot, rocking every revision
(I'm holding on to what I haven't got)
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
Though the words sound steady
Something empty's within them
We say yeah, with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
(Holding on to what I haven't got)
'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we get it, forget it, let it all disappear"

I'm cold like a midnight
In Aspen
I am the President
And the assassin
Cameras on
Big lights, ""Action""
Welcome to the show
I am the main attraction
Money in the mattress
Money in the attic
Money on my mind
Money is my habit
Stay on the grind
Until money's automatic
Bitch, I love money
I'm a fucking fanatic
Always strapped, gripped-tight, graspin'
Say what? Who, me? (Click-clack) Blast 'em
Chrome 24's, tires thin like napkins
Got to ride big 'cause I am like a captain
You know I'm a boss; chillin', relaxin'
Probably in my office, doing my taxes
You little niggas so not in my bracket
And I don't even have time to practice

Ice
Ridiculous price
Your camera has never saw a picture this nice
Hm, I'm fishin', and the bitches will bite
It's probably 'cause my game is Fixodent tight
Right
I'm fucking every bad bitch twice
And if she doesn't wear panties then I fuck her on sight
I'm nasty like spice
I know what she likes
I can make a black woman
Scream like she white
I can make a white woman
Scream like Mike
But before she starts singin'
She got to check my mic
Niggas just hatin'
And I done lost sight
It's like I don't see 'em
I only see the light
Talking that shit
But you boys just hype
I hope you bring a gun to the fight
A'ight?
Louis V tennis shoes
Big brown stripe
You think you fresh?
Shit, nigga – I'm ripe

OK
Brand new coupe
Driving crazy than a mother
Sittin' low in the seats
With the burner sittin' under
Got my tank top, top down
It probably ain't summer
But I ride like that 'cause I'm hotter than the others
Damn, there's no keeping up with the brother man
I could spell my name in burnt rubber
I'm gone!  Leave me alone
Now the dog is at supper
You could wash my plate and put it back in the cupboard
Ahem, I'm so far ahead of them suckers
I'mma have to start rappin' in numbers
I promise, the flows don't stop
They come rapid like thunder
I bet you hide under your covers

Wu Banga 101,Ghostface Killah,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: GZA]
Yo, too advanced, Digi' stance, made the CD enhanced
I move with the speed and strength of ants
Identical in form with the Bees they swarm
Hold up, the cold current appear warm
My first verbal brawl, started on some yes yes y'all
To the beat y'all, break your windshield, your jeep stall
Mr. Traffic, dumbin' shit, from ecclesiastic
Cashier, holdin' out, fine, cut off the plastic
See the logo? A monument in Hip Hop
Carved out, in the giant landscape, of broken rocks
Whether heard in herb spots, jukebox or malt shops
Uncut live, drop eighty-five, in one shot
Spotlight hits the metal mic, majority stare
Heard the Wu snare, while my iris cut down the glare
Walk a road the great length you find too long to measure
My Clan'll make me rhyme like D. Banner under pressure
No surprise, double disc touched five
Those elements, kept environments colonized
With the high flyin' death-defyin' flow like the Rebel
Right there, but you're one light year, from my level
[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Uh-huh.. yeah.. yo.. check it.. yo..
Bottles goin' off in the church, we broke the wine
Slapped the pastor, didn't know Pop had asthma
He pulled out his blue bible, change fell out his coat
Three condoms, two dice, one bag of dope
Oooh! Rev. ain't right, his church ain't right
Deacon is a pimp, tell by his ice
Mrs. Parks said, ""Brother Starks, meet you at the numbers spot
Heard you got red tops out, and I want a lot""
Shirley fainted dead on the spot
Two ushers slipped eighty dollars right out the pot
Oh shit!

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Egyptian, brown skin brown suede Timbs
Masqueradin' X-rated throw blades, all occasions
Round nozzle touchdown, Haagen-Dazs goggles White House
Gucci flag on the roof, call us rock groups
Mere intelligent, buy Neiman Marcus out
No doubt, all we saw he bought, Lori mom's all blow
Was simple, blamp instrumentals run camps the stamps get you
The way we lamp, fans come and get you
Play, fullback strapped like a fuck, war at
The black, Carlo Gambino's stash house in Hackensack
Pack capsules, Green Bay 'em lay 'em down like wax do
It's all actual we build, like Crash Crew
Coconut, incense, one sentence, aiyyo
Control the holy flinch hit this, new whips
Roman numerals, sun splash them niggas like, Tango and Cash
Alcatraz cats roll out fast..
[Verse 4: Cappadonna]
Wu thousand nuthin' but hardcore
We tryin to get land riches and more
Ghost put me on to it
We just do it, floss or whatever
Take care of the business, there's too many roughnecks
Give two of these to Flex, tell him it's real rap like Ghost
Had to beat niggas with toast
'Cause we got clientele, we lay it down flat
Pulled out on y'all kid, now where your mans at?
Fakin' the real like, ""Damn I can't stand Cappa'""
Then my wardrobe flooded the next chapter
Y'all heard about us like we heard about you
Bless the mic with reality, hit you with the virtue
Calm down not tryin' to hurt you, burst through
Fat shit, fatter than all y'all nigga’s outfits
We the glitch like Y2K
Catch the ball when it drop, guns pop, y'all have a nice day

""Doctor Kanabuta, Iron Man, he is invincible
His remarkable armor is supreme!""

[Verse 5: Masta Killa]
Yo, sometimes I'm liable to spaz and break fool
Grab my gun, select one, snatch son
Put the barrel by his face, blast one by his eardrum
Piss run, you drop thinkin' you're shot
Screamin' like a bitch, kicks to your face
Shots to the body that shake like the bass
I'm Ghostfaced up, military style down
Nuff ammunitions of rounds across the chest
[Verse  6: Ghostface Killah]
Skip to the intro, rap through post
Smashed a fresh ball of wax Caesar
Flashy penthouse that overlooks the vista
Wally Moc' half tied, swimmin' trunks
Three chunks of ice sit in Johnny Walker for advice
Catch the moment, fundraiser at will, work with the homeless
Polish diamond edge, Flintstone shit, sealed in a comb pick
Carefully, swing the B seven series Christmas lights
Too bright, Ghost is comin' y'all fix the mirrors
Relax like pudding, confidence strangle my man couldn't
Exile he no longer in the hood
Bless the kid that max the most
Me I turn a wedding into hoax
Roses tied to bombs on posts
On commercial breaks, piss in the apple juice
Rasta nigga rock the big do's
Jiffy Pop it's only chant Wu"
Shaolin Brew,Wu-Tang Clan,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Method Man]
Oh, yeah, comin' through with my Shaolin crew
2 Cent for a Kase, gimme St. Ides brew
In the midst of broken bottles and crushed up cans
Meth Tical's in the jam, oh, how dry I am!

[Verse  2: Raekwon]
With St. Ides in my system
Crack another, I'm blessed, let's go get the next one
And get over, the object is to stay sober
Lay on the sofa, better yet, dial my chauffeur

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
Call me the Wallabee Champ, stressed out, could never be, son
Ricochet daily, hit the deli for a cold one
Naturally blessed, yes, my rap is like a laser beam
That blows in the bushes, St. Ides fill the canteen

[Verse 4: U-God]
Crack the bottle of the St. Ides
Sippin' to those who don't realize
That drinkin' ain't only to be drunk
You can't drive, keep my peoples alive
And if the Saint don't know you from a can of paint
[Verse 5: RZA]
It was hot on the spot so I jetted up the block
I saw Akh with an Ides, I could tell by the dot
On the back he be buildin', not that charcoal filtered
Ice cold bottle tilted, to my cup and spilled it
Ahh, St. Ides, St. Ides ..."
So Ambitious,JAY-Z,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Pharrell Williams & Jay-Z]

Ay, this a special dedication, thank y'all
Hey! I wanna thank you for the fuel, no really thank you
Hey! Y'all gotta hear this shit!
Hey! Hehehe, hey!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I felt so inspired by what my teacher said
Said I'd either be dead or be a reefer head
Not sure if that's how adults should speak to kids
Especially when the only thing I did was speak in class
I'll teach his ass, even better's what my uncle did
I pop my demo tape in, start to beat my head
Peeked out my eye, see if he was beating his
He might as well say beat it, kid, he's on the list
It's like I'm searching for kicks like a sneakerhead
He gon' keep pushing me until I reach the ledge
And when I reach the ledge I'll tell 'em all to eat a dick
Take a leap of faith and let my eagle wings spread
Spread, spread
[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
The motivation (word up) for me (fuck y'all)
Is them telling me what I could not be, oh well
Hey! Hey!
I'm so ambitious (hey!)
I might hit two sisters (hey!)
Hey, I'm on a mission (hey!)
No matter what the conditions (hey!)
Forget personal issues (hey!)
When you go what I been through (hey!)
Hey, if you believe it (then be)
Then you could conceive it (you, see?!)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I had to lace up my boots even harder
Father is too far away to father
Further-more all the kids either smoke reefer
Or either move whites, there's few writers in my cipher
So they made light of, my type of
Dreams seem dumb, they said wise up
How many guys-a, you see making it from here
The world don't like us, is that not clear? Alright, but
I'm different, I can't base what I'm gon' be
Off of what everybody isn't, they don't listen
Just whispering behind my back
No vision, lack of ambition, so wack!

The motivation (word up) for me
Is them telling me what I could not be, (fuck off) oh well
Hey! Hey!
I'm so ambitious (hey!)

No matter what the conditions (hey!)
Forget personal issues (hey!)
When you go what I been through (hey!)
Hey, if you believe it (then be)
Then you could conceive it (you, see?!)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Had a couple of meetings no offers yet
Maybe I ain't good enough for these offices
Back to the drawing board ducking officers
It's all good 'cause the streets is A&R'ing this
So with or without any of your involvement
We coming for all of this, respect my conglomerate
I went from pauper to the President
'Cause every deal I ever made set precedent
Niggas probably thought I'd fall without old buddy (hehehe)
Oh buddy, what I do is make more money
Dear Teacher, you're probably somewhere near a speaker
I'm balling outta control, can you hear my sneakers
Fuck y'all

Long as no one break in my crib cause they ain't gettin out it
Leave it at that, I keep it peaceful
Cats'll run up on you like ""What you fuckin with me fo'?""

Fall Out The Sky,XV,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: XV]
I know I’m the shit, tell ’em they gonna say it
I know I can spit, tell ‘em they gonna spray it
I be sitting, writing piff and the metaphor’s thick
I’m like that line is hella dope, ain't it?
And two minutes after that, I’m looking back at the rap
Telling Pat that I won’t play it even when I know I one-take it
I’m Neo trying to jump in the matrix, won’t make it
Wish you could see it through my eyelids
When I’m playing my shit, everybody silent
I don’t even wanna nod, the yes man’s love it but fuck it, that’s they job
And then I’m walking out the mall and I’m almost at the door
And that’s when I hear Hoff, I knew that was you, please sign my arm
Square in the Circle’s all I bump in my car, that’s when it gets hard
To not feel like a star when they know who you are, I stay modest
And honestly, I’m appalled that I’ve gotten this far on the shit that I’m on

[Hook]
I know sometimes I feel so high and then I fall right out the sky
And then I fall right out the sky, I know sometimes I feel so high
And then I fall right out the sky and then I fall right out the sky
[Verse 2: XV]
She say I’m cute, she say I’m cool
To all of her friends, I make my move
I’m feeling like I’m that dude, don’t gotta spit game
I’m already that smooth, I leave my pessimism in the stands
As soon as I shoot, my conscious yell boo
As soon as I walk up to talk all of my stuff, I honestly can’t move
That’s my insecurity like a mall cop
But I’m trying to leave with something like a car lot
Pick one, pick two but they all hot and I’m trying to get you up to my spot
She know my name, she trying to play it off
I seen that ring, she trying to take it off
And I wanna approach but my thoughts ain’t helping me flow

[Hook 2]
I know sometimes I feel so high and then I fall right out the sky
And then I fall right out the sky, I know sometimes I feel so high
And then I fall right out the sky and then I fall right out the sky
I know sometimes I feel so high and then I fall right out the sky
And then I fall right out the sky

[Verse 3: XV]
I know they telling me how I’m mad dope
Star Wars XV, I’m the last hope but I hear them keys
And I just say, ""please don’t end on a bad note""
And that’s probably why I tip-toe, champagne, say toast
And then I sip slow, trying to get they attention and then I get no’s
And then I get known just to make them stop and go
This is all I got, no trust fund so don’t shoot me as I fly, duck hunt
Everything I expect, I accept and every dude that I pay, I collect
And everything that I say I'mma get, I'mma get
Take a twit pic and floss on my ex, yeah for a minute, I was high
Then I saw her new guy and I fell out my jet

Thugz Mansion 7 Remix,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: 2Pac]
Shit, tired of gettin' shot at
Tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free
And you gotta be a G, at thug mansion

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my mama's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a finally spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye, I see this place the players go and pass it
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion
[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me: ""Home is where the heart is.""
Dear departed, I shed tattooed tears
And couldn't sleep good for multiple years
Witness peers catch gunshots; nobody cares
Seen the politicians ban us, they'd rather see us locked in chains
Please explain why they can't stand us
Is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains
‘Cause all the rest dead; is there a spot for us to grow?
If you find it, I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream ""Peace!"" while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love, when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin' drugs, in thug's mansion
[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Dear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinkin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little Latasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand
Only God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in thug's mansion
[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton & (2Pac)]
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky (In thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky (Thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise, in the sky (In thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky"

Ayo, the flyest ma'fucker in the room, yeah, you know it's me
Bitches hatin' on him 'cause he started out here locally
Hopefully, I'll be at the top soon
For now, I'm at my house on the couch watchin' cartoons
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget when you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothin' when you stop and just say, ""fuck it""
'Cause you walkin' out in public and you hear 'em talkin' rubbish
I just wanna ride, ride through the city in a Cutlass
Find a big butt bitch somewhere, get my nuts kissed
That's the way it goes when you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick that used to brush me off in high school

Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?

Style come with excellence and money make benevolence
Irrelevant for the fuckers who never been intelligent
I kill my Henny, break the bottle for the hell of it
Tell a bitch that she better bring her friends
And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah, the party never end, this life is what I recommend
And if you got a ho picked for me, then she better be a 10
I ain't picky, but these girls be actin' tricky
When the situation's sticky and the liquor got 'em silly

Everybody wanna know about who I touch

Some of y'all think I squeezed by with luck
But that ain't stop, that's from buyin that new Porsche truck
Yeah, I said Nas, y'all sick of SARS
Got the big house, cars, and garage

If you don't leak it, maybe you can eat it
Fendi bags, Prada lenses
LV Trunk, boo I'm expensive
My girls know who I be (true)
My girls like VIP (true)
And they like Hpnot-I-C (Que)
And they ain't tryin to show you ID (True)
Lookin like a queen from Karnival
Niggas try to talk to me on the low
I ain't really catchin cause I'm on slow
And tryin not to scratch my Manolo
Blahnik, used to smoke chronic

I pops it boy
I pops it big

It all started off with the doctor tellin' my momma push
On July 5th, one-nine-seven-oh, Mac Dre hopped out that puss
I've been soakin' game since Rock 'Em Sock 'Em and Hot Wheels
Not never the chance to pass me, I keep 'em jockin', I got skills
And when I'm on the mic, styles I got so many
Drink Privilege Hennessy when I ain't fuckin' with Rémy (Rémy?)
M-A-C D-R-E, that's me
Like 'em freaky like Janet, not Jackson, but jack me, yee!
To all my niggas in the manor, to Alabama
Rodrigo blowin' only homie, don't fuck with bammer
I plan to have a ticket and kick it in The Bahamas
Watch your hutch and don't trust your baby mama (Nah!)
'cause I will get your scrill when I kill, all in them guts
Don't give a fuck, when you give a crippled crab a crutch
But they respect it, if not they get rejected
I'm M-D, the MC, that's not to be corrected
[Hook 2x]

Ichi, ni, san, shi. Uno, dos, cuatro (Cuatro?)
I'm sicker than ten J-cats that be gone off that vato (Ugh!)
Most sexual intellectual, with at least six figures before the decimal (Scrilla!)
Warm, hot, and respectable, but I'm nothin' correctable

I fucks with high rollers, shake highway patrollers
Quick to pop the trunk, but will come from the shoulders (That's right!)
Got the cuddie named Dubee, he spit more raps than loogies
And when he hand it to me, I'm funky like Mtume
“Do me. Baby, do me.” is all them hutches holler
I was breakin' bitches when phantom tops was on Granadas
More game than keno, gamblin' trips to Reno
Sippin' cappuccino, eatin' Italian cioppino
C-note stacka, pack a P89 (P89)
Love group sex, take 'em three at a time
And boy I be outta line, when I'm full o' that Tanqueray
Quick to grab the choppa, cock 'er, aim, and spray
Urban guerrilla, warfare extraordinaire
You know about my mackin', but boy I'm more than a playa (That right)
Resurrected, double R elected
Haters get ejected, I'm nothin' to be corrected

[Hook 2x]
Pistol packin' playa, gangsta mac for reals (For reals)
About my scrill, got to pay my bills
Boy I'm in it to win it, if you weak and timid
Better watch how you spend it, I'll take yours like gimmicks
Bustin' out like titties (titties?), in a bra that's too small (Ha-ha)
Grew up off Too $hort, stackin' scrill too tall
Mac Drizzay, all damn dizzay
I keep hoes dizzay and the one-time bizzay
Been rappin' before they called Mac Mall Grimace
Romp in peace Mike Robinson, son of Dennis (That right)
I'm in this, too deep like Tim, Jim, and Johnny
Much love for my cuddies Jay, Ray, and Ronnie
Rapin' pockets I get mine, however it come
Boy I get dumb, about my income
Mac Furley, up early, sippin' X-O
Nothin' correctable. Nigga, you know!

Extra, extra, what's that all about?
I'm wishin' the position of my loving's sorted out
I shed a tear 'cause I'm hearin' nothing new or particular
Status once parallel, now it's perpendicular
And everything is just as clear as day
Realistically explicit in the things you say
I guess a ""bitch"" in the batter's gonna make the flavor fatter
But you gots to keep it for real
Forget about your jewels and gems
You won't be needin none of them
The tool'll fix the era
My mellow used to wear a namebuckle, now he chuckle
'Cause he earn a dime Quicker
Talkin bout a burner, sippin' on some malt liqour
And all these kiddies wishin' they were supa emcees
But to earn my ""s"", I had to learn some less
About a crime'll make million, a dime'll make a call
I'd rather hop on the line and drop a rhyme to Prince Paul

Hey kid, what's the word?
Man, it's all about mind
Keeping focused on them self-mechanisms of rhyme
So no longer stand erect 'cause your thoughts are drained
Walkin' round, manifesting attributes of shame
Used to squabble for the mic but now accordingly
We act unless a club can't afford the fee
We act so name that any best man to put us under
Created from the ground yet know nothing 'bout the under
Take a glimpse at them pimps playing record exec
Adding up all your OHs so's to cut you a check
Saying why the blunder wonder could've G'd today
So you can put up some swings for your seed to play
But a swing ain't that important when the park's around the corner
Filled with life causing death, greeting victims for the morning
It was the moment I feared
Nah, the moment I steered upon the right path
To know the right math to overstand

[Chorus]
It's a dog eat dog competition (no doubt)
I'll be gone like you're wishin' (and I'm out)

You know, some niggas really out there bad
You know what I'm sayin'
Some niggas is forced in positions where they gotta do things where they don't wanna do it
You know what I'm sayin'
So some niggas forced to dope, sell dope
Some niggas forced to pimp
You know what I'm sayin'
But you got some niggas out there that
Just lazy, you know what I'm sayin'
Niggas ain't forced to do nothin'
Niggas got other options they just choose not to do 'em, you know?

Sittin' in the back of the police car position
Your mission is forgetting and denying the existence
Thinking of different ways to keep from submitting
And continuing to not to mention
...like that
Grand Marquis Police Interceptor edition
With the wall so you can barely fit in
Knees is touching the front seat, shifting
Cause your handcuffs is cutting your wrist and
Your wishing that he would drive faster pleeease
But he slows through the hood as he drives past the free
It's cool but you tripping:
The quicker you get there
The quicker you sit there
Cuffed to a bench and
They playing good cop, bad cop
One of the them pretending
So you rewind yourself
To your uneasy recline in the back of the police car
Hand-cuffed and the seat belt
Nah, you ain't gotta quicken the pace
That just give me more time to sit and erase
Alibi and alias, switch and replace
Think about then, forget about an escape
Thank God that I'm up in the states
'Cos if I was in Russia who knows how they'd do a hustler
Wait, I ain't a hustler, I'm straight
I'm damn near a buster, no laws I break
Money I never seen, guns I didn't hold
Drugs I never sold, calls I didn't make
Nigga this is a waste of your time and mine
""Is that uncomfortable?""....""I'm fine""
A case? This ain't even a fine
You ain't find nothing, homie, not even a dime
Not even a dime that'll drop dime on me
I know you was dying so you put a dime on me
I know that's a crime, you supposed to fight crime for me
Protect and to serve
Prosecute, correct and return to the homies
And thats gonna send them direct to the curb
So you can put 'em back on me

[Verse 2]
He's sitting in the front of the police car position
His mission is bending, pinning charges on niggas
Even if they didn't
He's sitting in court lying
Testifying against defendants
...Like that
And he love to choke niggas
He don't trip with the rich
He just like the broke niggas
Probably did more dirt in the street than most niggas
Even the old people don't like him
'Cos of the way he approach niggas
Nigga, you ain't no better than me
Just a hustler with a badge
Confiscate the dope money
Put it with your retirement boat money
You ain't building no playgrounds
In the poor for some cash
That ain't a pension
That's a shoe box stash
With a Glock to protect it
We both undercover, check it
Thinking that the good we do
Gon' out weigh the sinning that we do to collect it
Saying ""it's for the community""
They don't value us
Only around because the property value up
And they gotta clean the street before they put the houses up
Knock them Section 8's down
Put them 200,000's up
Feel he don't get paid enough
To kick in doors, to raid and cuff
So he use what niggas get on the street
To supplement the wages cut
So he gotta keep just enough niggas out there hustling
To keep his paper up
...Like that
Maybe he should be in the handcuffs

Hatchet in his head
We'll roll him up in a carpet
All's well that ends well
Carry him up the staircase
Wu-Tang, Black Knights
Holocaust, Skeleton Lode,
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
West Coast
The flyest shit ever, Yo, Yo
Smash a roach in a pipe and smoke it

[Holocaust]
A bloodstained diary, snakes in the bathtub
Run through the meadow laughing with revolvers
Mean man Skeleton Lode, insane
Will scream in pain, sometimes it does rain
Cannonball trees, Uzis and flamingos
Dead men mumble, grab me when I stumble
Swig on whisky, actress tried to kiss me
Blew it from across the room but it missed me
Now at the Bombay chat house with pistols
Might tip my hat, whistling in the graveyard
Shells on the street, Holocaust is cold
Now known as Skeleton Lode, Devils fold
Blue socks fancy red shoe
When it rains the flowers drip candy
Couldn't understand me, pistol on the dresser
Never was lesser, Lay you on the stretcher
Slit his wrist with the piece of a broken record
Music from the Sun, lonely hitchhiker
In the darkest corners of the city
In the darkest corner
[Hook: Holocaust]
The planet gets priced for what it gives us
A beggar taxed for a corner to die in
The crooked priest has his fee
Who doesn't live trust and
We bargin for the graves that we lie in
While at the Devil's booth all things are sold
Each ounce of junk costs it's ounce in gold
Knowledge to the poorest comer free and lavish this summer
Makes myself quit shucking and jive'n

[Holocaust]
The light in the distance, Spider crawling on marble
Lay in an empty pool with a pistol
Wu-Tang Official, whistle like a missile
White House with black walls, Come correct
Music in Iraq, Kiss you in the darkness
Whisper to the daylight, Circus at the gravesite
Fe-Fo-Fum where is Francesca, A shovel fell over
Sitting, Smoking yeska, Bloody fiesta
Man without a name though
One zombie went out over to touch the rainbow
Gun in my coat, the bar just closed
A white owl biting a rose sat froze
Winding back roads, swerve in a garbage truck
Of all things I've lost, I miss my mind the most
Big West Coast, heavy smoke
A well dressed skeleton slowly cuts your throat
Emcees find themselves falling down
Lost in the sound, drink until you drown
The funny old man and his wife stay on the mountain
We guzzle wine, La-La-La-La
[Hook]

[Holocaust]
A hand in the darkness, Bats fly in the rain
We play where the dead man hang, A spiked brain
Coffee on the table, skeletons in the walls
Wander down the cobwebbed halls until you fall
Deep in a coffin, look at the wooden crates
My pistol changes shapes, bullet holes in your drapes
Soap in the dirt, plates in the lake
The clown with the tearaway face is selling cake
Roaches in a shoebox, mice in the guitar
Just through the woods and over, it isn't far
Drink up the bar, pour bullets into a shot glass
Stomp through the attic, blood smeared on the window
A purple rose from Cairo
A match fell down the tunnel in slow motion
Walk at the bottom of the ocean, with a notion
A man selling pictures, lonely on the road
Mean man Skeleton Lode, from the cold
When he walks through the crowd, their heads explode
Stand in the doorway, came from California
Headdress short a few feathers, face the music

But good luck couldn't be bought, see
Many a fights had to be fought, G
For a nigga to ride these Vogues
Oh so close to the sidewalk to be gawked at
Watch your side my nigga cause we got gats
The first nigga to buck is gon' be the first nigga we attack
Don't want that, but it comes though, most of the time when you don't know
Stickin' together like flour and water to make that slow dough
We worked for everything we have and gon' stick up for
Each other, like we brothers from another mother
Kind of like Mel Gibson and Danny Glover
Strictly for the Caddy lovers
And never the nut huggin' punk motherfuckers
So quit spreading them rumors

Why when I'm not high, does my life feel like it's missing something?
I know that I must be high
So that I can function
Why, when I'm not high, does my life feel like it's missing something?
I know that I must be high

[Verse 2: SPM]
I'm a use my three wishes, I'm very superstitious
No matter where I go I meet a bunch of horny bitches
Burn a few bridges, feed a few pigeons
Fuck em so good they wake up and wash dishes
The food was delicious, bacon, eggs, and biscuits
No French kisses and no hippopotamuses
I'm picky, if you strictly dickly, you can't get with me
As I represent Houston like the damn Whitney
I'm a get em when I get em I loved em and I fed em
Lived in peace, I ain't gonna let em when I see em I'm gonna wet em
Shut em down like D-Town and the homie Ackavelie
Peace to Happareli and my nigga John Freddy
My drink is thick as jelly, I love my shit muddy
Four of us in this bitch and we gonna do them boys ugly
Ready for the rumble, leave em lying in a puddle
Y'all don't really want no trouble with the lord of the jungle

[Hook: Russell Lee]
Why, when I'm not high, does my life feel like it's missing something?
I know that I must be high
Why, when I'm not high, does my life feel like it's missing something?
I know that I must be high
[Verse 3: SPM]
I walks in the club, all grabbing on my dick
Is the police officers pattin' down my click
They say my bandana breaks the dress code
Every fine fucking bitch I see is my ex-hoe
I'm hoggin' and I'm doggin' creeping and I'm crawling
Believe me this my calling it's time to do you all in
Everybody jump jump, boys trip what what
Let my double barrel shotty go barump-pa-pump-pum
Slanging slam or the rocks up in no man’s land
Burnin off in my ""Smokey and the Bandit"" Trans Am
The rope around my neck is just dangling and jangling
Sometime I smoke the rain and get wetter than a penguin
Aunt Jemima sipper, hoes like Jack Tripper
Peace to Big Dipper, what the deal my nigga
Hook like ""Johnny” Tapia, it's Dopehouse living prosperous
I tip my waitress and she can't stop saying 'Gracias'

Daytona 500,Ghostface Killah,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Force MDs]
We are the G-O-D's
And we came to rock the spot like Ironman Starks
They be the illest emcees in the world today
Cappa, Raekwon, and the R-Z-A
So listen to them clear, and put the box right near your ear
Light your blunts and down your beers
'Cause you could never fuck with Wu-Tang Killer Beez
""From where we at to my man's cell
From where we at—""

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Say peace to cats who rock MAC Knowledge Knowledges
Street astrologists, light up the mic, God—acknowledge this
Fly joints that carry two points, Corolla Motorola holder
Play it, god, E-pack over the shoulder
Chrome tanks, player like Yanks, check the franchise
Front on my guys, my enterprise splash many lives
Repel all fakes like reflectors
He had sugar in his ear in his last crack career
We can can him, manhandle him, if you wanna
Run in his crib-o, get ditto, skate like a limo
And jet to the flyest estate, relate take a break
Break down an eighth and then wait, drop it like Dre
Thugs they be booing and screwing, we canoeing
Claim they doing the same shit we doing—fuck the union
It's the same style, RZA’s train aboard, jump the turnstile
On the island, he tried to challenge God for the new Bal's
Especially that, aluminum bat in the Ac'
Relax, lay back, sell a grenade a da—it pays, black
The Mac-10 flex wipe cats like Windex
Index finger be sore busting these fly scripts
The Wally kid count crazily, grands revive lands
Laying with my bitches and my mans in Lex Lands
We losing 'em, jet to the stash in Now Jerusalem
Abusing 'em, rocking his jewels, like we using 'em
Low-pro star, seven thick waves rock Polar
Roll with the older Gods, build with the Sun, Moon and Star

Mercury raps is roughed, then god just shown like taps
Red and white Wallys that match, bend my baseball hat
Doing forever shit like pissing out the window on turnpikes
Robbing niggas for leathers, high swiping on dirt bikes
Voice be mellow like Vaughn Harper, Radio Barber
Murder sleep-away camp, the fly lady champ
The arsonist who burn with his pen regardless
Slaying all these earthlings and fake foreigners
In the Phillipines, pick herbal beans, bubbling strings
Biochemical cream, we burn kerosene
The conviction of my tape is rape, wicked like Nixon
Blonde heads, inscriptions with three sixes in
Kiss the pyramid experiment with high explosive
I slapbox with Jesus, lick shots at Joseph
Zoom in like binoculars—the rap blacksmith
Money's Rolex was rockless, Chef' ragtop is spotless
I'm Iron Man, no die-cast metal, I'm steel-alloy
True identity hidden inside secret tabloids
Breathe oxygen, both sides of my jaw carry oxes
The track hit like the bangers in hundred watt boxes
Yo, jostling these cats while Little J be deli'ing
Sip Irish Moss out of Widelians

Killer bee stung, guess who back home son
My technique of slang camp won, third platoon soon
Cristal bottles, cages of boom, Papi wardrobe
The mad-hatter big dick style, beware goons
Smuggle balloons, Lorna Doones in fat pussy wounds
Let the Gods build, pull up the grill, check out the mad skills
Top-secret technique, too hard for you to peep it and keep it
Jiggy style of rap and watching knock our slang, sweep it
Out of order tape recorder can't record my slaughter
Spoil the rotten, Donna, too good to be forgotten

Parental Discretion Iz Advised,N.W.A,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","One, two, three, kick it

[Intro: The D.O.C.]
Aiyyo Dre, what's goin' on man? What's goin' on?
Ay what ch'all gonna do for this last record?
Nah tell me what cha'all gonna do?
Okay, you want me to do the intro? Aight!

[Verse 1: The D.O.C.]
Parental discretion is advised for the moment
While I'm getting candid, now understand it
Ain't too typical in any way, though the pro
On the mic is the D.O. to the C., this is an intro
I know The D.O.C. makes you want to take a Valium
So buy a bucket cause upcoming is my album
And for the record, meaning my record, check it
Listen to the single and you'll be like, yo, I gotta get it
But in the meantime, listen to the rhyme
Of the Dr. Dre played with N.W.A
Yella's on the drum roll, rocking the beat
Aiyyo Dre, where's you gonna take this shit man?
[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Aiyyo, let's take it to the street (WORD UP!)
Let 'em understand perfection
Let knowledge be the tool for suckers to stop guessing
Cause I don't give a fuck about radio play
Observe the English I display
Lyrics for the adults, children have been barred
And scarred from listening to something so motherfucking hard
Dope, pumping that's so my shit will never falter
Yo it's Dre so fuck the ""Mind of Minolta""
Psycho like no other motherfucker
So step to me wrong, G-O for what you N-O
But be warned, never will I leave like a regular
Cause I'm a little better than the regular competitor
I use to see 'em on stage
Earning money like a thief, but without a gauge
Until I got full, of clocking the lame getting pull
(They said you wasn't gon' get paid)
Nah that's bullshit! They like it stylistic
And I enchant the crowd like I'm a mystic
(C-C-C-C) C-C-C-cameras are flashing when I'm in action
A photo, or fresh with a flair for fashion
Pure simplicity -- see, it's elementary
You hear one of the hardest motherfuckers this century
Try to comprise a word to the wise and the guys
Parental discretion is advised
[Verse 3: MC Ren]
Ren is most extremely high performance
The black hat cause I worn this, cause it's like enormous
Some shit I don't take it, not even in a toilet
And shit from a sucker, put in a pot and I'll boil it
Turn up the pilot as it burns
And maybe the motherfuckers will learn
I'm not a sub, cause I speak sensible
Not considered a prince, cause I'm a principal
I'm engineering the shit that you're hearing
Cause when it comes to power, I'm power steering
Silly you say, I say you're silly when you say it
Rushing to the eject, to put my shit in and play it
It's like Apollo, but I'm not an amateur
And I'm not giving a fuck while I'm damaging ya
It's for the record; so Ren's lyrics is gonna spin it
And if there was a trophy involved, I'd win it
Possession is mine and I'm the holder
Cause a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck cause I'm older
So for you to step off would be wise
And say fuck it, parental discretion is advised

[Verse 4: Ice Cube]
I be what is known as a bandit
You gotta hand it to me when you truly understand it
Cause if you fail to see, read it in Braille
It'll still be funky -- so what's next is the flex
Of a genius, my rapid-stutter-stepping if you seen this
Dope, you hope that I don't really mean this
But if Play made a greater high-top fade
It's not my trademark when I get loose in the dark
You guess it was a test of a different style
It's just another motherfucker on the pile
Driving your ass with the flow of the tongue
You hung yourself shortly after knowledge was brung
To your attention, by the hardest motherfucking artist
That is known for lynching any sucker in a minute
Stagger 'em all
When I start flowing like Niagara Falls
Ice Cube is equipped to rip shit in a battle
Move like a snake when I'm mad; and then my tail rattle
I get low on the flow so let your kids know
When I bust, parental discretion is a must
[Verse 5: Eazy-E]
Little did they know that I would be arriving
And it's surprising, rocking it from where I been
But it's the E here to take, no mistake to be made
In the trade where funky ass records are being played
Fuck the regular, yo as I get better the
Bitches wanna trick and go stupid up on the dick
So I get 'em hot, thinking they're gonna get it
As they sit, rubbing their legs like a cricket
To you it may be funny, but
There's no service of beef without money
So slip the C-note, and you can choke
On a wing-ding-ding-a-ling down your throat
Foreplay to me ain't shit
When you spread 'em I'm ready, then you can get the dick
Of the Eaz, if you can deal with the size
But if you can't, parental discretion's advised!

I'm sure we speak the same language
Fuck you bitches, pay me

[Verse 1]
Wait a minute, came to go get it, ranger fitted
Whenever it come to paper, better know I'm major with it
Make it rain a major blizzard, leather alligator lizard
I Talledega race any challenger; name a digit!
Even if on the slightest, you take a smidget
Or dare touch my revenue, I'll slice you with the razor, quit it!
Icy till I make it frigid, burr
The laws of physics says it's getting cold
My money taller than a hall of midgets
I get up all up in it, kicking down the door, who is it?
Bitch, I be the crew of bill collectors, pay them all a visit
After cleaning bank accounts you questioned
If I gave a shit, if not I tell the truth
So you could tell 'em that the player did it
It's OK, I say a prayer, it's the mayor bitch slayer
Giving you another layer of the data trick

Critical, it's pitiful, I'm cynical
How I deliver lyricals and take these other niggas paper
Topsy-tervy controversy, I'm so thirsty, got no mercy
For some of these bitches, I collect my money now and later
Keep it moving with the clique
While making bitches hit the strip
Cake up everyday I wake, I rate the way my money flip
I want it's mine, borderline, call it crime
All the shine I'm taking it, ain't no mistaking it
Nigga, what's yours is mine
No need to second guess it, check it, I'm the gloss and grind
The gritty and the floss, the profit and the loss, all intertwined
Because I profit from your losses
You don't want it, you should get it

Hey sport, here's a thought from the old school crew
A serious situation we all go through
It deals with your feelings, so hear what I say
It's like a day where nothing seems to go your way
Bust this, two people, they really like each other

Boys, yo that's my woman, and girls, yeah that's my man
This person brings a certain warmth to ya heart
And everything seems so great at the start
For she loves him, and he also loves her
And it's hard to turn back to who the person you were
But later on, problems start to occur
And the bond, which combines y'all turn into a blur
For the feelings were the same, now here's the score
You love 'em too much, and they don't love you anymore
Due to your attitude, a number or because you're not being true
Or maybe they're just plain sick of seeing you
Word, now it might seem strange
You better take hints quick, and make the right change

See just when you swore, the ball was rolling
They're gone, and part of your heart's been stolen
Get back on your feet, with a hop and a skip
But no, you'd rather go with this dead relationship
Hanging around, and buying him stuff
You seem him every darn day, you don't see him enough
You follow them around, and they claim ya hawking
When conversation comes, you do all the talking
Not to mention, attention, we all need a bit
Behind your back they're saying, yeah he's all on my...
They're getting sick of you, and quite annoyed
And if you had plans for the future, they're now destroyed
You saw what was happening, and you still let it
And if you ever let him make love to ya girl, you can forget it
Sweetheart, you been caught
It'll spread around town faster than ya thought
And break up time, and you receive the words
Yo, this is from the heart, and I know the part hurts
Get over it, from now don't take short slick
If it's not true love, you shouldn't deal with it
Just think of your future, and what is to come

If a coward ever ran then it wasn't me
I'll be on the curb movin' dubs and d's
And if you ever bought a dub then it was for me
I ever get caught then it was to be
I'mma just make bail by my cousin E
Back on the Porsche with the mobile phone
Like eleven in the mornin' them hoes to go home
Trynta score and get this shit off quick
You ain't from the hood, y'all don't know bout this
[Hook]
But if you feel me, throw your bows up (Star Trak)
Try to set up shop get glowed up
Hey, I'm the candyman, I got mo' than frozen cups
I got your chop top sour diesel roll-ups
Fam! we can roll up (Star Trak)
But Fam! don't try to roll up (Star Trak)
Don't make me pull these motherfuckin' fo's up
Cause it's like that

[Bridge: Kelis]
Aww shit, this is the part when the fight just start
When the fists get to swingin' and the four-fifths spark
And then the bitches get to runnin' and the bitch just scream
And we spin off in Rolls and it's so damn clean

[Verse 3: Fam-Lay]
I stand on my block, the cam on the spot
My hands in my pocket, both hammers is cocked
Waitin' for a nigga to just act up
My right hand big six, got my bait back up
Niggas lookin' all jealous, lookin' mad as hell
Actin' like lil' girls, like tattle-tales
Mad cause my right hand bad as hell
I would've kept shootin', but I had a sale
See, I'm a crime boss three sixty-five
Lookin' for a Nina Ross, she just can ride
Picked up my cash and slide all sweet
Nigga tried to snatch ass, knocked his heart off beat
Nigga talk trash like the shit all sweet
Won't'cha all take the cash dogg, not off me
Hustlin's in my veins - you cannot stop it
Walkin' on the block with life in my pocket
I'm trynta score and get this shit off quick
You ain't from the ghetto, y'all don't know bout this
[Hook]
But if you feel me, throw your bows up (Star Trak)
Try to set up shop get glowed up
Hey, I'm the candyman, I got mo' than frozen cups
I got your chop top sour diesel roll-ups
Fam! we can roll up (Star Trak)
But Fam! don't try to roll up (Star Trak)
Don't make me pull these motherfuckin' fo's up

We spray ya'll way (pop and you lay down)
So don't walk our way (get from round these parts)
Cuz we puff our way (fuck around and get shot in the dark)

[Ruste Juxx]
Aiyyo, recognize my Boot Camp Clik out of N.Y
Living legends in the game, niggas been fly
Think back, when we first entered the stage
Let that Brook-nam rhythm and rage out the cage, nigga
How Many MC's screaming U Da Man
Buck 'em Down with that Black Smif-N-Wessun in my hand
Champion hood fatigues, all black chuckers
Where the soldiers walk tight than a million muthafuckas
I don't give a fuck, I've been jumped a hundred times
Stabbed alot of niggas, committed a hundred crimes
Bitch, I ain't buying that, give you a raincheck
Gladly pay you Tuesday for seriously brain that
Sound Bwoy Bureill, chi-chi man funeral
Headz Ain't Redee ain't ready to shoot, niggas salute
The elite generals of the street and gun play
Ruste Juxx, Boot Camp, BK all day
[Hook]

[5 Ft.]
The streets are hard knocks, where police swarm blocks
Where every other soldier keep they firing arm cocked
Gorillas on that grind, it's a Brooklyn state of mind
Make money, take money, a famous motto of mine
When you find the hardest nigga, tucking in they shine
They know the rules'll get 'em, if you blink one time
So it shouldn't be a mystery, the man that gangsta history
The general, the fever, blaze ya out another victory
All you niggas running ya mouth, and don't mean shit to me
Leaving your body numb like Pepsi Twist mixed with the Hennessey
Got a shell for every single one of my enemies
Brooklyn pumping blood through my heart, to the death of me

[Buckshot]
This is the original Bucktown bullies
From the same block where they bust shots at police
Like, blow, everywhere I look
Somebody shook when they lost in the city of Brook'
And umm, ya'll know every block is danger
If you not on point, somebody came up
Fuck the stranger, beware of your neighbor
Cuz when he broke, that's when he change up to bring the banger
Finger on the trigger, as we look closely
At the car when he ride slow, cuz we don't really know pa
Ya'll know how we do around here
Who we screw around here, if we new around here
[Hook]

[Tek]
You hear my gun ball go in, shotgun toting
Heavy pitch blowing, nigga back the fuck up
Who you know fucking with the U.G.P
Underground prince of hood H.O.P
I'm a world wide hustler, Brooklyn gangsta
When the east is in the house, ""OH MY GOD"" danger
Did too much dirt to wipe my hands clean
And I love new money, so fresh and green
See the borough I'm from, we be on that bullshit
Fuck ya baby mama, hit you up quick
We play with whole bricks, nigga, get that weight
Respect my grind, 718, the great

[Steele]
Use caution when you crossing that Brooklyn Bridge
Don't get caught up out here with them Crooklyn kids
Real gritty, that's just how we live
Fitted '59 fitties over Scarface grills
Bedstuy, to the East, to the 'Ville
We get hype when we eat, give you fights for the thrills
We in the house, in the place getting field
Fights live through the breakout, the chain, get peeled
Girlfriends bang out with airbrushed nailis
Snatch your bitch weave right out
Her hair ain't real
You from the projects, your man ain't real
Getting house forced objects, it's like that? Yeah
[Hook]

[Rock]
Fuck your gun talk, play 'No Doubt', you 'Gwen' 'don't speak'
You ain't shooting nothing but air, you Nintendo Wii
Fuck the industry and fuck being in those streets
I'm from the low down, you can't even go in those peeps
It's an animal hunt, think I damage your hunt, your man in the front
Get snap shot without a camera, son
The animal's hunting the animals, the pigs is the worstest
Well, not to the rats and the bird niggas
Fuck them, they can't stop you from getting your food ate, they just
Make it hard to eat like toothaches
Pause, difficult to eat like toothaches
I be having myself and I like shoelace

Daps and Pounds,Kid Cudi,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Yeah baby
As he transforms to a whole 'nother being
Super duper
Nice

[Chorus]
I am the one that you might see around town
Giving up daps and pounds
So high up but I'm holdin' it down
Screamin' what up? What it be?

[Verse 1]
Step up in the place just me and my buddy
Everywhere I go they screamin Kid Cudi!
Launching away from the helipad
Running out of bud, re-up before I'm hella mad
Hella like my dad in the sense of my ignorance
Now I give a shit bout less more than a little bit
One hell of a kid, and I kick it
Lord willing pure feelin' to the tenth power
Mash on the pedal, float above gravel
Weave through the city streets
Seize what the people seek
Please come follow a dude haters in the media call rude
How do you conclude to intro the interlude?
The game runs dry, bringin' the lube
Skinny as a fuck, still eatin' the food
Hard to kill Cudder like Steven Segal yeah
Haters applaud and they are appalled cause I see y'all
Can't hide in your closet, stop it
Be a boogie man, go do nothing beautiful
Sorry, I'm an honest man, fuck it
To my enemies: please squash it
You don't want Cudder to transform to a maniac
Kinda like Pat after plenty gin and tonic
Say I'm not a lyricist you fuckers need to figure out the logic
When I'm in rap mode it's nothing less than brolic
Don't run on beats motherfucker, I frolic
About...
Around...
[Chorus]
I am the one that you might see around town
Giving up daps and pounds
So high up but I'm holdin' it down
Screamin' what up? What it be?

[Verse 2]
I'm lost in the kool-aid, I made my own flavor
Hawaiian super kush for everyone
Givin' free blunts to the ones who wanna dig
More than a man, super duper they feelin the kid
Let us get it in and get out
Exhale, inhale, eyes on the road seen foes
They linger ahead
Not really there, really here
Nor here, nor there, not really scared
But oh well, I'll still be where what they might see as the wrong path
Embrace bad with the good, keep doing the math
Trying to get it right so I can eliminate the pad when I scribble
Beer pong, I dabble; Shrooms on occasion, depending on the persuasion and who I'm with
Ask Ron Price, I was nice when I was younger
Yeah you was a Killer- ""When You Were Young""
Though I'm 25 like I'm 16, first time high

(""Yeah, I tried telling them, I'm something totally different, honest. Hahaha."")

Freedom of Speech,Immortal Technique,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Heh heh heh
Freedom of speech, motherfucker!

[Chorus: Pinocchio sample & Immortal Technique]
I got no strings to hold me down (Okay)
To make me fret or make me frown (Somethin' for the kids, hahahaha)
I had strings, but now I'm free
There are no strings on me

[Verse 1]
Step into the club smoothly with a L in my hand
Bitches know that I'm a freak like the Elephant Man
Intelligent plans, fuck a record deal
I want development land with my benevolent clan
And that's the reason that I only trust my fam
40,000 records sold, 400 grand
Fuck a middleman, I won't pay anyone else
I'll bootleg it and sell it to the streets myself (Haha)
I'd rather be that than signed and stuck on a shelf
And because of this, executives try to diss me (Fuck y'all)
Racism frozen in time, like Walt Disney
And now they say they wanna get me signed to the majors
If I switch up my politics and change my behavior (Huh)
Try to tell me what to rhyme about over the beat
Bitch niggas that never spent a day in the street
But I repeat that nobody can hold my reins
I put the truth on tracks, nigga, simple and plain
[Chorus: Pinocchio sample]
I got no strings, so I have fun
I'm not tied up to anyone
They've got strings, but you can see
There are no strings on me

[Verse 2]
I guess to America I'm a disaster (Oh no)
A slave that was destined to own his masters
Independent in every single sense of the word
I say what I want, you fuckin' little sensitive herb
This is America, I thought we had freedom of speech
But now you want try to control the way that I speak (What?)
And O'Reilly, you think that you a patriot? (Yeah right)
You ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' racist bitch
Full of hatred, pressin' a button tryin' to eject me (Hahaha)
But I ain't got no motherfuckin' deal with Pepsi
No corporate sponsor tellin' me what to do
Askin' me to tone it down during the interview (Never!)
Tryin' to minimize the issue but I'm keepin' it large
I love the place I live but I hate the people in charge
Speakin' is hard when you got strings attached
So I'ma say it for you 'cause I don't got none of that
And if you didn't understand what I spit at your brain
Ayo son, let this little nigga explain
[Chorus: Pinocchio sample]
I got no strings, so I have fun
I'm not tied up to anyone
They’ve got strings, but you can see
There are no strings on me

[Verse 3]
Come on, son, y'all niggas know the way I do
Immortal Technique dot com live for you
And I know sometimes it be makin' you nervous
The way I snatch puppet rappers that belong in a circus
You motherfuckers just can't compare
Lookin' for a fanbase that's no longer there
I know that you're scared and you're hidin' up in the cut
But this is freedom of speech, nigga, tell 'em what's up

[Outro]
Word, nigga! Fuck John Ashcroft!
Nigga, fuck Fox News! Fuck those snake-ass bitches
Tryin' to manipulate your opinion, tellin' you what to think
Word the fuck up, nigga
Like, ""We invaded niggas ‘cause we want to free them.""
You racist mothafucka!
You don't give a shit about those people
You can suck my dick! (Hahahaha)
Relax, Tech, relax
Another rum and coke at the bar, nigga!
It's my day off, word up!

Crossing the Boundary,Immortal Technique,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Danger! Beat Bandits, nigga!
Yeah, Harlem to Chicago to LA to Toronto
Philly, motherfuckin' Rio De Janeiro, nigga
Cape Town, South Africa

[Verse 1]
I never make songs to disrespect women
Or to judge people about the way that they livin'
But the way I am is based on the life I was given
Like them white boys, losin' my religion
I used to be a Christian and a political pawn
The Bible is right and all your native culture is wrong
Next thing you know you tellin' me 'bout makin' a song
Come in the studio, and tell me that I'm makin' it wrong
Pissed off 'cause reality is makin' us strong
Like the ghost of Timothy McVeigh makin' a bomb
Ayo, Marvin Gaye, what the fuck is goin' on?
These rap niggas made propaganda out of your song
But it's the Gong Show, amateur night at the Apollo
My dick is like my music but harder to swallow
So, children, follow me, like the Pied Piper
And sing the chorus in the air, with your blunt and your lighter
Sing that shit, nigga, right now

[Chorus]
You played yourself thinkin' you down with me
I end your life, nigga, don't fuck around with me
And if you kids can't listen, then you bound to see
The way you get shot for crossin' the boundary
You played yourself thinkin' that you down with me
I end your life, nigga, don't fuck around with me
And if you kids can't listen, then you bound to see
The way you get shot for crossin' the boundary

Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
The second verse is worse than the first in this respect
Scripted specifically to keep people in check
Harlem to Boston, real niggas spit with me
But Landspeed, you ain't fuckin' shit to me
And underground labels, know that I don't trust you
You only independent 'til you major, so fuck you!
And if you're pissed off 'cause you think that I dissed you
I'll rape your moms and we can make this a personal issue
Dance with the Devil, remember that you're not on my level
Stupid, you're not ready
I won Disypher, Bragging Rights from Rocksteady
And practically every battle that they got in New York
And I'll still murder rappers on the street for sport
Doctor Guillotine cuttin' you short, little man
But you don't give me props, 'cause I never won at Scribble Jam
Well, fuck you! I hope someone you love dies
So fuck your crew! And fuck your family too!
Technique said it, bitch, what the fuck you gon' do?
[Chorus]
You played yourself thinkin' you down with me
I end your life, nigga, don't fuck around with me
And if you kids can't listen, then you bound to see
The way you get shot for crossin' the boundary
You played yourself thinkin' that you down with me
I end your life, nigga, don't fuck around with me
And if you kids can't listen, then you bound to see
The way you get shot for crossin' the boundary

[Interlude]
Yeah, wrap it up on these niggas, man!
Wrap it up, yeah!

[Verse 3]
Immortal Technique incinerate degenerate fags
Burn Trent Lott wrapped in his Confederate flag
I got the Beretta with my face wrapped in a rag
So put the African slave jewelry in the bag
Motherfuckers tell me that a diamond is forever
But is it worth the blood of Malcolm and Medgar Evers?
House niggas, get your head severed, tryna be thug
You don't concern me, I'm tryin' to hurt the people you love
Word of mouth is I'm in the club, bein' sneaky
I'm like the body snatchers, and your girl is gettin' sleepy
I murder you indiscreetly, right at the source
Like the Roman legionnaire that stabbed Christ on the cross
This is about you, though, it ain't about Jesus
And you shouldn't fuckin' talk about telekenesis
Nigga, please, movin' shit with your mind
Try movin' your moms out the projects with your rhymes
And next time, I'm comin' after cualquiera
Profanity, fuckin' carajo maldita mierda!
Roll up the hierba, y pasala, para la izquierda
Put the price up to listen to me pop shit
'Cause I got Martha Stewart givin' me stock tips
Underground money with honeys up in the whip
Bangbus.com, nigga, fuckin' your bitch
[Outro]
Yeah, played yourself, nigga, fuck all y'all!
You don't know shit about me
Why open your mouth and discuss who the fuck I am?
I thought I told y'all niggas on Volume 1
I wasn't fuckin' around, you just slept
'Cause you sold a few thousand units in the golden era
When niggas would buy anything on the shelf
Those days are through, and you are through with them"
Revolutionary,Immortal Technique,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","*Men talking*

Yo load the fuck up (locked and loading)
You too (locked and loading sir)
Remember break that window when that cop comes in
And blow that motherfuckers head off
--multiple gun shots-- (Got him)
Yeah load it up again cause these motherfuckers
Are gonna come back for us. (We're ready)
We gotta be prepared in this day and age, we gotta
Be prepared for whatever comes the fuck at us. (Word up)
Cause we are living revolutionarily. (Definitely)
You cannot second guess yourself in these days and times
They're gonna throw whatever they can at you and you gotta
Be prepared for it, you gotta be prepared for anything

[Malcolm X]
""It's liberty or it's death
It's freedom for everybody or it's freedom for nobody!""

(Hook)
No matter what the fuck life throws at me
I continue to make it through indefinitely
Immortal Technique defeats the odds repetitively
Until there ain't shit ahead of me competitively
Surviving the tough times is imperative to me
Looking at the whole world revolutionarily
[Malcolm X]
They don’t want to hear you old Uncle Tom
Handkerchief heads talking about the odds

Technique will force you into strategical retreat
Because I dominate guerrilla warfare in the streets
There ain't no way to picture me without a victory speech
When I reach higher positions
Without the recognition of pissed on competition
Cause I conquered their renditions
In a systematic form like a religious tradition
My mission is to take you, lyrically break you
Lyrically assassinate you
Lyrically incinerate your body and recreate you
To destroy the power that mentally incarcerates you
Cause even though I rip it better I could not forsake you
You're my people with the same oppressors so how could I hate you
The revolution of the mind that bring me generates you
But when you come original people impersonate you, start to hate you
Cause the conflict is building within the ultimate sin
Is to be ashamed of your skin
My rhymes are like Jamaican over proof I make the room spin
Intoxicated flow I bleed vodka and brandy
Don't make me choke you down like Jon Benét Ramsey
Something demands of me to rip this fucking shit uncannily
God commanded me to be a technological disease
And psychologically do battle with the best emcee's
Upper-case the 'T' in Technique
Cause I'm the capital of revolutionary nation that's infallible
Aztec; Lecter, Hannibal
Rip your heart out of your chest and feed it to the cannibals
Your just a fucking animal but I'm the Neosapien
Cause my original civilization was based upon creation
You know theirs no escaping even though your heart is racing
I'll put your best disciple on academic probation
Fuck the litigation, fuck the best rapper nominations
And fuck the president I voted for assassination
I'm saying fuck the federal bullshit investigations
Fuck the cover up of ghetto radiation extermination
Using my people for experimentation
And if doesn't play hip hop then fuck your radio station
(Hook)
No matter what the fuck life throws at me
I continue to make it through indefinitely
Immortal Technique defeats the odds repetitively
Until there ain't shit ahead of me competitively
Surviving the tough times is imperative to me
Looking at the whole world revolutionarily

[Malcolm X]
Revolutions overturn systems, revolutions destroy systems! (crowd cheers)

Yo what the fuck happen to reality spitting rhyme slayers
These days everybody trying to be a thug or a player
Where did all the real motherfuckers go in the game
Bring back the break dancers and graffiti writers with fame
I remember hip hop before the mic gun clapping
Cause I used to drink forties with more flavor then these rappers
Lyrical ego trips doesn't make fortification
Your not dope enough, spit self glorification
So don't jerk me around cause my name ain't masturbation
Life is hard it'll leave you scarred cause I been through shit
If you consider rap a job I suggest that you quit
Don't you understand the audience will listen and dance
In the club, crib or car or whatever they get the chance
To be emancipated start debating justice in the cipher
Why do you think project rooms look like the cells in Rikers
I'm explaining the significance on the reason behind it
They're preparing your children for the prison environment
When you don't amount to shit prison becomes retirement
But I refuse to be took in to central booking in chains
Cause sleeping on the floor in cages starts to fuck with your brain
The system ain't reformatory, it's only purgatory
Close to hell but I rebel as begin to spark an L
And tell my people how we fell into the trap that we live in
Because they locked us up in ghetto's and began to rape our women
So I leave the system Unforgiven like Eastwood
Cause I was bless with lyrical strength to do whatever I could
You should of seen it coming long ago when you were very young
My word is through the father, holy spirit and his fucking son
Cause when I grab the mic device in front of Christ and start to rip it
I'll make Jesus turn around and say ""yo pop this nigga flipped it""
So talk about whatever and be what you wanna be
But don't mistake the way I break the faith for simple blasphemy
Cause through the highest frequencies in the NYC
I'm crushing 97.1 percent of MC's
(Hook)
No matter what the fuck life throws at me
I continue to make it through indefinitely

And you think that that's your baby (You don't know)
You a good guy that's living a lie
But she told 'em where your safe be (It's what I know)
If you cool and she satisfied
How come that bitch just paged me? (You don't know)

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Last time I saw you
You was brewed up, booed up, ready for a new fuck
Last time you saw me
I was P.I. to the mothafuckin' M.P., what?
And lately I heard you's a broke bitch
Livin in the lower class suburb
And lately the word is I live in a suburb
And I don't fuck with birds
She used to pump on the block
Sell a nigga rocks, bail a nigga out, but
She tried to plot on a nigga
Vacant lot one shot bitch died go figure
He used to pay this bitch
Gave her lots of shit, fuck's wrong with this nigga, man?
He used to bring her through the hood
Treat the bitch too fuckin good, my opinion
We used to blaze with the bitch
Faded off the lick she x-rated the clip
This nigga bought braids for the bitch
Louis Vuitton kicks and tricked on some sucka shit
Meanwhile in the hood she drivin around good

We had to ride on a nigga, watch him
For the right time to get richer
We decided when the hit was
Run up on him, 45 in the ribs, what?
This nigga screamed like a bitch
Showed us where his shit, hit a hell of a lick
But the bitch, who told us 'bout the bricks
Exposed us to the nigga, he knew that we'd come
But meanwhile in his hood
His niggas is suiting up and Timbed, looted up
Rims and new trucks your man livin' it up
Then a van with no hubs suddenly pulled up and erupt
Shot a nigga the fuck up, just my luck
The bitch got us both touched, it's like a rush
The bitch who blushed and smoked blunts with us
Turned out to be nuts, switched up
Mixed up with the wrong slut
Got my frame zipped up in the bag, it's all bad
My niggas got my back, in fact
They caught on her Ave, flossin in another nigga cab

One love to nobody, stupid doo doo dumb
We at the party, unnh, let's kill em off
Dre & Mall make a bitch cough

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
It started on a bright morning in 1997
I was in my SS Chevy y'all, I-80 doing one-eleven
Barking on my faulty phone, fresh new fit Maurice Malone
Burning tongue, feeling hella numb
Stupid doo doo dumb off 151
Honking at every ho that pass me
I'm hella nasty, boy, I need chassis
I'm the type of brother that'll fuck your mother
With a Magnum rubber and leave it on the cover
I won't love her, aw naw
All a nigga want is long jaw
It goes down where I'm from
How we come?
Stupid doo doo dumb
[Hook: Mac Mall]
When your chassis getting nasty playing with her pearl tongue
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Four fingers in a pussy, cuddie, gone use your thumb
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
When you're hitting it from the back and you smell sometin' sometin'
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Or when she's slurping on my dick and she starts to hum
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb

[Verse 2: Mac Dre]
This is a brief description for those who don't know Dre
I'll go bad on bitches like that nigga OJ
Dick down broads and get blew at the telly
And don't see nothing wrong, like that fool R. Kelly
I serve cock like Julian St. Jox
Asshole naked getting blew in my socks
I'm the type of nigga that do thangs to thick dames
A super freak like that man Rick James
Adina Howard couldn't Freak Like Me
When I was in the pen, I used to beat my meat
But now I'm on the street hitting hella skins
Fuck a bitch so good she got to tell her friends
Tearing shit up making noise'n, with d-Con, that hoodrat poison
From city to city, town to town
Stupid doo doo dumb is how we get down
[Hook 2: Mac Mall]
When you're in your own hood and they ask you where you're from
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Dick longer then my Caddy off 151
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Another hit of this shit and you gon' bust your lungs
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
When the babby hella flammy, can't make a playa cum
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
I'm hotter than fish grease, slicker than thick grease
A chump on the strap, I'll serve him a six-piece
Slick with this shit like spit on a gold tooth
Stupid Doo Doo Dumb, when I spit it's the cold truth
Crestsider, hoo rider, servin' on suckas who try to

And I'll make snaps when I shake craps
Straight caps and lots of Bay game
'Cause it's a Bay thang with young Mac Dre, mayne
I say thangs that make your brain trip
Refrain from lame shit and some can't hang with
That game I bring and slang on dope tracks
I lace the lame and tame with ho slaps
I'm so fat, when I'm on the microphone
Stupid dumb making' em leave the mic at home
[Hook 3: Mac Mall]
When you off dog food and your nose start to run
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Fuck your sister so good that your mammy got sprung
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Headers when I first met her, all teeth, no tongue
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Crestsiders in the house, punk bitch, we on one
Stupid doo doo dumb! Stupid doo doo dumb!

They wanna know (All you have to do)
Know how I do
Maybe you don't (All you have to do is call me... call me)
Why you playing, why you playing?
I be going like two and two
With some more hot shit ready to spit for you
With the songs that you love just to get you through
Ma

[Verse 1: Talib]
Back in effect
I'm back to collect
Got the respect
Which will turn into the cash or a check
You can, pay me with fear, you can pay me with love
You can, pay me in tears or you can pay me in blood
Spray me with slugs, and the revolution live, I never die in vain
The writer might be dead but the piece remain on the train (yea)
The music help you be true to yourself, accumulate wealth
So what I spit is the embodiment I do for self
As a teen it was kinda hard to find a job
I took over my writer's block and ran it like a spot
I'm Pimp C in this game nigga, I'm a hard
But I'm never feasting on it, keep speaking on it God
That's what they say when I'm building, I keep my dialogue street
But still spiritual like we deep inside a mosque
Or the synagouge that don't preach or go where the sinners are
And keep the fire burning like a slum lord in the Bronx
[Hook: Talib and background singers]
Of course I will 'cuz you know how I do
Maybe you don't (All you have to do is call me... call me)

Rhyme writer from nine to five
It's the 25 to lifers with the balance of the acrobatic high wires
The pain of the slave with his back feeling like fire
'Cuz the whip talking to his ass like Knight Rider
Most of these rappers nowadays be sounding like liars
Got visions of guns in they head like the Pied Piper
When I bust they start to disappear like my lighters
'Cuz they shit is faker than the dreads on Mikah Phifer
The industry is in trouble
Plus these industry niggas is fake, so they tend to be in a bubble
So I hit the block where they're known to thicken the plot
Sticking up cops, kids be pocket-picking they Glocks (my man)
Balling outta control, don't be forgetting that niggas is broker than dishes at a Greek wedding
They might try to run up on you, take your life quick
It's like this when you walk the strip up on the night shift

[Hook: Talib and background singers]
Let 'em know
Of course I will 'cuz you know how I do
Maybe you don't (All you have to do is call me... call me)

[Verse 3: Talib]
This right here the bare essentials with no extras y'all
I kept it raw from the school of thought where less is more
Brooklyn is cooking and I blessed it with the special sauce
I got the soul of a prophet and never take a loss
Fresher than kicks out the box, the kids on the block
That is street hungry trying to get that sweet honey out the rock
Crack in the socks when they click the row thicker than sour sop
Listening to my black power rock
Music, of this hip hop we be rocking to it
I'm a river, you a valley, watch me run right through it
You wanna learn how to do it, tell the truth in your single first
Lil' Kim went to jail for what you do in every single verse (free Lil' Kim)
Lyrics is perjury, your beats is more plastic than surgery
And we in the United States of emergency
One of the main reasons none of you lames worry me
Is I change lanes like I change planes and change currency

They wanna know, tell them (All you have to do is call me)

Pockets on swoll cause I move the O's
My neck, my wrist, my ears is froze
Come get your bitch, she on me dawg
She musta heard about the dough
Not Captain c'mon and Save-a-Ho

Number one on the chart all the time mane
When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dancefloor packed that's without a doubt
But shorty shake that thang like a pro man
She backed it up on me I'm like ""Oh man""

Boom
Now me love fi see the schoolers them a graduate
A-study hard, and save the party for the holidays
Diplomatic with them diploma and them bound fi great
Because them nah pick up no 'matic and a-perpetrate
And then I love the energies, what them a-generate
My generation, it so special, it will make a change
Because the elders sow the seed and it a-germinate
So anytime them see the progress, them a-celebrate
Because we rising up despite of the economy
And then a-we a-star the show like the astronomy
And how we keep on breaking through is an anomaly
Because we keep remaining true without apology
The mission have fi carry through and finish properly
Say Gambia to Guadeloupe, Paris to Napoli
Say Zambia to Honolulu, back to Tripoli

[Verse 2: Nas]
Can you blame my generation? Subjected gentrification
Depicting their frustrations over ill instrumentation
'Cause music is the way to convey to you what I'm facing
Placing my life in front of your eyes for your observation
Now if you can't relate then maybe you are too complacent
Athletes today are scared to make Muhammad Ali statements
What's up with tomorrow? Will you lead? Will you follow?
Improve your values, education is real power
I reach 'em like Bono, so get rid of your self sorrow
Add some bravado, get wealthy like Wells Fargo
It's truth that I am you and I am proof
Surviving through, we do what we gotta do
Yo, we could break the cycle, let nobody lie to you
Then maybe put our sons and our daughters in private school
'Cause there's a mission, we gotta finish before we leave
This generation is destined to do historic deeds

My generation will make a change
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
This generation will make a change

This generation will make a change

If you weather that storm, then that rain bring sun
Been a long time coming, I know change gone come (We're makin' a change)
Man, I gotta keep it moving to the beat of my drum
Last night I set the future at the feet of my son
But they thinking that my generation gotta die young
If we all come together then they can't divide one
Don't worry 'bout it, just be about it
Got a message from God: ""Heaven too crowded""
But I say, ""Hey, young world, you never looked better
And I heard change start with the man in the mirror,"" uh
This generation, I'mma represent
A generation led by a black president
Now how's that for change? Who knew that can change?
I don’t even look at the flag the same, heck
Uh, so when you finish reading Revelations
Thank God for my generation

If You Ever Hear Me,Crooked I,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]

The world lost a luminary recently
It's name Hip Hop
And it drowned from to much **** and champagne
What the hell happened to you Hip Hop
Artist with names like, Terminator X and
Furious Five And Ni**as With Attitude(NWA)
Once preached about social awareness
And political enlightenment
When did fight the power
Become ""Wait til you see my D***!"" (Laughs)

[Verse 1]

I started off in this game, heart full of high hopes
Young and naive, Notebook full of fly quotes
Critically acclaimed, they say Crooked I's dope
Doper than white coke, walking a tight rope
Trying not to fall, this industry you see it got traps
Record executives rape you with those paper contracts
Got my first deal and they pulled out my arteries
Shot me in the heart I mean they killed the best part of me
Ask me to be a gimmick shitting on my artistry
Ain't nobody hard as me! Fuck being RnB!
Told you crooked go hard, told you it’s a G thang
Told you fuck that auto-tune shit unless its T-pain!
I like Lil Wayne, cos he's Lil Wayne
I like the game cos he's game and we ain't the same
You need a little variety on your spice rack
AnR’s want me to change so I don’t like RAP!
Ask me for ringtone song homey I might snap!
And treat my automatic weapon to life snack!
A lot of rappers let it slide but I fight back
Cos 99% of hip hop is quite wack!
So you can hate me or get back on the right track
Either way I don’t give a fuck! and its like that
Yeah its like that, used to be a nice cat
Last year I was sick of this music now Im twice that!
[Hook]
Do you remember the first time
You heard P.E.?, NWA and B.D.P.?
Do you remember the last time
You heard Kool G, Big Daddy Kane, Rakim & Erik B
You ever hear
2Pac and B.I.G
You ever hear
Big Pun and D.O.C
You ever hear
Big L, Eazy and Ice T
That's Where we will be
If You Ever Here Me!!!

[Verse 2]

You like rappers in shoot-outs I really been through em
I swear to god I could have did the 50 cent to em!
A little guidance from Dre, let Jimmy mentor em!
Instead my enemies witnessed my semi spit for em
I could have did the Snoop, im from the beach homey
I could have did the Eminem
Im a beast homey!
Look at the word play I use in the chorus
The verse way, over your head I confuse a thesaurus
Im worth cake! Making moves in the torus
You smoke weed?
I got so many tree’s you’ll be abusing the forest
We serve weight
While executives in music ignore us
In the first place
Fuck! Fugitive warrants!
Id rather have a lucrative future in touring
On my first date stupid supporters
May I first state my news to reporters
Yo, ill call a press conference to say FUCK rap!
Then go to the radio station and let the GUN clap!
I spit like a hundred Kanye’s and 3000 Andre’s
Still im stuck HERE! Where the thugs at!
Magazine covers tell you were my buzz at
Everything you do to get a big deal I done that!
[Hook]

[Verse 3]

Yo
I give rap stars a blind folded cigarette
They kick me off they videos sets
Because I'm a bigger threat! (fuck em)
Hate it or love it I thought nothing of it
My nigga chuck tried to bring me to the mainstream public
But its back on the block where the Glocks be poppin
Selling Orange county’s ya’ll call em oxy cottons
Selling purple syrup and kush, while the cops be watching
Hit the studio with guape we clocking off the boulevard
I wanna live legal buts its so expensive being the leader of the underground!
Shine when I come around!
Standing in the VIP with Russell and Jay- Z in Vegas
And didn’t do it from selling a CD! (no)
Everywhere you rappers go, you gone see me!(yo)
A hood star with or without the TV!
Play me in your whip im so Ill you’ll get car sick!
Now Id rather spill my pain over guitar licks!
Flying a mosh pit, something like a star ship!
Rap till your heart skip a beat, but on some dark shit!
You AnR’s wanna trap me in this hood life
Some say its my past affiliation with Suge Knight
Me and Suge parted ways along time ago
Didn’t think you labels would react so vagina though!
I don’t know
Maybe im a big flop
Maybe I should end this nightmare with a quick shot
Maybe I should join Eazy-E, Pac! And Big Pop!
Maybe I should say FUCK HIP-HOP!

Verses of the Bleeding,Jedi Mind Tricks,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Allahu Akbar, everybody just be calm
That's the word passed down from the imam
It came from the Qur'an, it can't be wrong
It's only measured in time of God's eons
So I suggest you follow Allah way
Or turn into a bitch inside the jungle's the raw way
That's what the law say, you ain't ready for that
You better bring a bulletproof and machete for that
And nobody want to be there
They stick you with dirty motherfuckers up in the tear
Now it's back to the topic at hand, I'm rocking your fam
And fight against the army with a rock in my hand
A Glock in my hand, divide your body into two parts
Exchange entire theories of God by spitting two darts
But I just want people to build
And did imam Al Husayn know that he would be killed?

[Hook x2: Vinnie Paz, Des Devious]
We coming for blood, in the name of Allah
We coming for blood, and we ain't playing with y'all
We coming for blood, we destroy and rebuild
We coming for blood, if you ain't loyal, you killed
[Verse 2: Des Devious]
I got a vice grip on the mic spitting my shit
My balls and arrogance alone be the cause of these hits
Easily split your wig with the flick of a wrist
Send a block, your body dragging you into the abyss
But that's some sick shit I only do when I trip
Or when I'm tailing motherfuckers running they lip
That's when I start the procedure of body beating you to a seizure
Your crew is standing there staring looking like non-believers
I felt 'em standing and staring, that's when I pulled the heater
My ratchet cooking these faggots, I make 'em all see the
Fact of the matter is, if you don't back down
This ain't no slap down, you getting clapped clown
So don't be running 'round, talking all this and that
That's female shit, type of shit that get you trapped
Into a dark corner, rope pulling on ya
Tried to escape, head shots left your ass a goner

[Hook x2: Vinnie Paz, Des Devious]
We coming for blood, in the name of Allah
We coming for blood, and we ain't playing with y'all
We coming for blood, we destroy and rebuild
We coming for blood, if you ain't loyal, you killed

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
I'm ready to blackout, crippler cross-face tap-out
Coming through the fucking door with the gats out
Let the blood rain down and drip on your skin
Let the slug hit your crown and rip from your limbs
I'm the illest fucking rapper alive
Give me sixteen shots, I can crack you in five
I have to survive, have to get my money and shine
Have to get everything that I used to promise my mom
I got to do it for everyone that I promised something
For everyone who thought I wouldn't be alive or something
Come on money, that's some cold shit, wishing me dead
So I'm beating they mid-section till they pissing in red"

And I think there's been enough said
Cause your body's gonna leak like a mothafuckin dust-head
Burner love to see the blood red
And you pussy-clout rappers can't sleep until a thug's dead
But I don't plan to die
Until it's my time
So just keep playa hating from the sidelines
It's divine rhyme

Wanna lie anymore

This is war rap similar to Jacob's ladder
Walk around like Thor with a sacred hammer

Burn when the sun's out
Y'all are traveling the bum route
Talking 'bout whips, standing on the strip with your thumbs out
But that ain't me
I don't care about a whip
Y'all are fake money just another counterfeit
While y'all are on the block thinkin bout your pipe dreams
I'm Slick Rick style thinkin how my ice gleams
Thinkin how I'm gonna make this money
Take a visit to the Bing and embrace my dunny
I guess this is just a part of God's plan
Beware of the beast undercover in the marked van
If you a smart man
Use your voice to sing
Cause that's the only fucking way to avoid the bing

Forget what you knew
Welcome to the muthafuckin' battlefield

I two-step with Lucifer, and ever since I started dancin’
I’ve walked a fine line between Einstein and Charles Manson
Starvin' in this famine with my stomach growlin'
Like someone shoutin'
A hundred thousand times louder than thunder poundin'
Fuck around and I’ll punch your mouth in
I’m king of the mountain
With my life in this project like it's public housin'
Countin' on the fact I firebomb entire songs
And won’t stop 'til the world's inside my palm like Viacom
Diabolic, I’ll supply the higher wattage via fiber optic wire
Until you acquire some kinda knowledge
'Cause life made me grow wiser than old-timers
Hot-headed like the ghost rider behind a slow driver
Sole survivor, flowin' lava’s second nature
So don’t test, it's best to save your breath like respirators
I’ll throw a punch at your ribs that gives your lungs asthma
And has you pourin' out your guts faster than Dutch Masters
Drunk bastard, past the point of no return
Like Denzel trickin' Ethan Hawke into smokin' sherm
Judgement overturned, holdin' court like Mordecai
Immortalized when I make statues bleed and portraits cry
I’ll go to war for mine, Rebel Army guard the border
I’m in the trenches, barkin' orders like I’m Sergeant Slaughter
Pray to Jesus H. for mercy, and plead your case
'Cause on the frontlines you’re dead
The second that you see my face

This is the frontline, this is the dead zone
Barely alive or in a box is how you head home
This is the frontline, this is the life that I chose
I thought I told you muthafuckas to lock and load

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
They said that the success of my music was theoretic
But my revenge is sweet enough to murder diabetics
Eugenics Procter and Gamble credit racial science
Couldn't produce a more aggressive intellectual giant
Nephilim, bury 'em with the bullets left in them
My heart is blacker than the children of Thomas Jefferson
Blacker than back in the days of tar and featherin'
A cancerous endocrine, the eagle that's American
The hatchet and the sticks, the fascist emblem
You could call it conspiracy theory, I don't give a motherfuck
You could get your mother fucked
National security's a code-word for cover-up
Hold that down, I look at character, never let the color get to ya
I got white Revolutionaries like Muslims in Chechnya
Percussion thumpin' like the Russian Mafia over ya
But even they know what it's like when you fightin' for Svoboda
So whether Slavic or Islamic, vodka/gin tonic
Drunken fantasies are cool, son, but here's the grim logic
You niggas wanna play industry and starve to be rich
Until they fuck you for millions like Paul McCartney's bitch
My lions live inside a box like Jumanji
Sikh niggas that'll stab you up like Indira Gandhi
So never desecrate the space on which I meditate
My thoughts rip through tank-armored metalplates
And start to resonate
To the spot where Moses caused the sea to separate
The place that the Prophet Muhammad started to levitate
The exact moment that Jesus rose dead awake
And Siddhartha became the Buddha that regenerates
Half a bar over, but I bring it home colder than dead soldiers
Soul controller, holder of knowledge, so fuck Dianetics
I'm like the whole library in Kemet with Annunaki genetics

This is the frontline, this is the dead zone
Barely alive or in a box is how you head home

War Is My Destiny,ILL BILL,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
They killed my entire family
Murdered and tortured, raped and pillaged
I was only five and I was the only surviving witness
My entire village burnt to the ground
He wore a serpent in his crown
Happily committed murder with a frown
In an army of black-hooded fiery-skulled generals
And a sorcerer that could cast spells that’ll change your genitals
Held me in slavery till I turned eighteen
Killed my slave master, five years later became king
And I slain dragons and ate steaks during famine
Had the seeds of war planted in a dirty tavern
Had the seeds of presidents killed in a burst of anger
And had their parents bleed to death on the floor of a dirty bathroom
I watched their palaces burn, I seen the ashes of my comrades
Returned to their family in an urn
While a proud child remembers his father that died
The cycle continues with vengeance alive in his mind

[Hook: Max Cavalera]
Refuse, resist, war is my destiny!
Disorder unleashed, war is my destiny!
Chaos, A.D., war is my destiny!
Under a pale grey sky, war is my destiny!
[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
Yeah, yeah, I was an angel before a third of the stars fell
Cast with the sternum from Satan into the pit of hell
Our beloved leader forced to be a bottom-feeder
The great deceiver that promised victory over the monkey lovers
We took a vote to restructure and traitors fell upon him
We ripped his skin off and crowned a new son in the morning
A new president to lead our corporation
The vengeance on God and Heaven’s domination
But I seduced the daughters of man and made the Nephilim
I demanded human sacrifice from the rest of them
I became the spirit that tortured and protected them
And I built them the tower of language that connected them
And then the Lord cried, water falling out from his eyes
And my children died drowning in the tears from the sky
And it was then that Satan crawled back to me with a plan
A design for the ultimate corruption of man
See back then we used to set the chosen ones on fire
You really think God only sent a single messiah?
And so we allowed the birth of many prophets on earth
And since the followers were human they were born with a curse
They began to claim superiority to their brothers
And for eighty-five thousand years conquered each other
And when they prayed before battle they were praying to me
Killing in God’s name cause war is my destiny!
[Hook: Max Cavalera]
Refuse, resist, war is my destiny!
Desire unleashed, war is my destiny!
Chaos, A.D., war is my destiny!
Under a pale grey sky, war is my destiny!"
Put Your Hands Up,Jadakiss,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Turn the fuckin beat on!
Ha!! Yeah, we back! S.D.!
I had to switch back to Dom Perignon in rap baby!
Cock-and-run to stay in the business
Son of a bitch! Double R, look at me now motherf..
Two-thousand-and-one, ""Kiss the Game Goodbye"" - let's get it on!

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
It's the J-A-D-A, I got beef with the feds and the D-A
I got footage of the game, press replay
I got bitches in the club all over me, ma take it ea-sy
And y'all scared I can tell
That I'mma get Bucks like Milwaukee, cause like Sam, I ca' sell
I'm that nigga y'all know that
Bang you in tha yard then slide off on the early go-back
In the streets I flash the cannon like Kodak
And I spray threes, so say cheese
I already told you I'm lookin for enemies
Double R, so of course it's better
I love cornrows and Farrah Fawcett feathers
It's a message in a glass bottle read the letter
Money in the bank, membership, Visa sweaters
And we ride or d-i-e together
[Hook]
Uh uh, come on, put ya hands up
Nah, fuck that, put ya hands down
[Ahh] Come on, put ya hands up
Nah, fuck that put ya hands down

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Y'all know I got the master flow, fast or slow
Y'all wanna know who the best is? ask ya ho
The honies don't lie they love it
And they cop for real, so trust me dogg, the thugs will dub it
'Kiss hit you with consecutive hot shit
Therefore nobody ever gon' spit like I spit
Get money just to walk through, off the books
So when you mention my name, shit is off the hook
Shirts is off, titties is out
And you know when I'm there, hardest niggas in the city is out
I'm in the club, ice over the thermal, waitin' for you to try me-
When the lights get low I'mma burn you
Start with straight shots, and then pop bottles
Flirt with the hood rats, then pop models
You gotta slay two or more, ma, that's our motto
And y'all might get down with the team if y'all swallow

[Hook]
[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
(Muahh) Kiss the game goodbye, the game is mine
You thought wrong? change ya mind
I'm the nigga that'll pop the king, and scoop the queen
And take over the town with a ruthless team
New S-Type wagon, future green
Gun heavy, pants saggin, I'm used to cream
Who you know can make a million dollar bail on cash?
Never did a day and got the jails on smash., K-I double
I move the perico quick, and let the manteca bubble
'Kiss been a boss, y'all just start workin
Now put ya hands up 'til ya'll arms start hurtin
And don't put 'em down 'til I tell you
Whoever wanna be hard headed'll find out what the shells do
Now you can put 'em down if you want
But soon as the hook come back put 'em up!

When you think of me you think of a problem
Who? What? When? and how you gonna solve em
Automatic or revolving
The K I double S and, Here's the lesson
Most beams is infared, but mine's is flourescent
No matter where you go, I'mma spot you
No matter how many people you put me in front of, I'mma rock you
And if you try to be the hard top, I'mma drop you
I got to, treat you like the clutch, and pop you
Creep threw, in the 4-20 with your honey
Cuz you ain't nuthin' but a playboy that turned bunny
And the only the thing left to discuss is more money
In these bullshit games these chickens, try to run me
Ya'll know ya'll can't touch us, I flow luscious
It's so real I make her hop out, and get the dutches
I'm sittin on a thousand birds, and I hide from the cameras (why?)
Cuz a picture's, worth a thousand words
Since ya'll herbs, ya'll get what ya'll deserve
Ya'll do the catering, while we just get served
And you got some nerve, for P-Hing
Jason, do you have any idea who you facing?
Just something about my shit, you'll never figure out
It's too hot, burning my mouth, that's why I spit it out
It must be, real hard for ya'll to listen
And it's sad, niggas is to broke to pay attention

Chilling, sittin' on about half a million
And all my niggas, all my guns, all my women
Next two years I should see about a billion

Hey yo, niggas know the line of work, Bullet proof designer shirt
Rolling with a China Doll, She'll be reminding ya'll
Don of the underworld, every block monitored of course
Jadakiss and L-O-X boss
A pro cause I grow off the shit that I absorb
You just another so and so, trying to flow, going broke
You trying to buy property, set it up for growing coke
Niggas making a movie, so I came to edit
Wiping everybody out, right before the credits
I'm a hard guy to get along with, get on a song with
When shit be going right, I flip into the wrong shit
The prime artist, expect me to rhyme hardest
Slash con artist, gonna get mine regardless
I ain't even big and I size niggas up
Cuz they eyes give em up, look at em and see they butt
I'm 22 with 10 ends so there that go
You hear that flow that drove the underground wacko
Every since 12 I've been spittin like tabacco
Relax though, Pop the tape CD and the wax though
They wonder how, but the thing about ours
We open up 24 hours
Niggas don't sleep with eat so when they speak it mean power
So you should keep quiet, you a coward
About to be layed out flat, and pushing up flowers

Chilling, sittin' on about half a million
And all my niggas, all my guns, all my women
Next two years I should see about a billion
All for the love of drug dealing

So long my lovesick youngsters
Goodbye my used to be friends
I remember each vacation
Each day we wasted
It felt so different then
So long my Casanova
Farewell to my long lost friends
I remember all the kisses
The hits and misses
I never knew a love like this

[Pre-Chorus]
After all the boys that I thought I loved before
I didn't know what love was
Til you knocked on my door
After all the boys that I wished had loved me more
I didn't know what love was
Never had this feeling before

Say you love me, love me, love me
You love me, love me, love me
Didn't know what love was
Until you loved me, loved me, loved me
But yeah, you love me, love me, love me
Oh yeah, you love me, love me, love me
Didn't know what love was
Til you knocked on my door

So long my travelling soldiers
Reminisce about the boy cross town
Peace to the wide eyed genius
With Hollywood dreams
Said he was never one to be tied down
So long my high school teacher
Damn, I had a crush, but I couldn't reach ya
Remember all the guys
They were never right
I'm so glad I found you this time

Oh, when I didn't know
I didn't know
'Til you let me know
And I didn't see
I could ever be
This happy
And I never loved
In a way that I do today
Oh, I'll never be the same
Since your loving came my way

Oh, say you love me, love me, love me
You love me, love me, love me
Didn't know what love was

I Believe,Lowkey,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","I believe...

[Verse 1- lowkey]
I believe in equality, freedom & honesty
I believe that I'm a born leader so follow me
I believe in respecting others
I believe that sons should learn from their fathers and protect their mothers
I believe that you reap what you sow
And people won't believe if you don't speak what you know
I believe the jewels are sacred and I'm gonna be the greatest
But I'll leave this place before I'm fully appreciated
I believe in choosing your path but to improve in advance
You have to understand your roots and your past
The future is ours, there's room for our Tunes in the charts
And we'll become superstars if my crew gets the chance
I believe life's a lesson, we're all students in class
I believe that MC's are confusing this art
There's lies on the telly but there's truth in my heart
Do you believe in yourself or is that stupid to ask
Cause I believe...
[Hook-Eden rox]
I believe my future's gonna bring me greater things
I believe in getting anything it ain't impossible & easy to achieve
Ain't nothing wrong you can change your dreams
Make your moves and take the lead
I believe... we can do anything

[Verse 2- Lowkey]
I believe I was placed on this earth for a specific reason
Numerous close shaves, but still I'm flipping breathing
And I believe all oppressed people should be given freedom
I believe you saw them kids starving, you just didn't feed 'em
I believe in love, I believe in peace, I believe in God
Somehow, some way; we're gonna beat the odds
I don't believe in black or white (no), only wrong or right
I believe there's other life forms up beyond the skies
I believe you can't judge a book by it's cover
We're still brothers even if we don't look like each other
I believe it's up to you to find the life you'd like to live
I believe God guides my hand when I'm writing this
I got other purposes besides just rap
I believe I'll probably die before I relax
But if Muhammad Ali won his title back
Then I can change the world when I write a track
Cause I believe
[Hook- Eden rox]

[Verse 3- Lowkey]
I believe in miracles
I believe the spirit goes to a peaceful place when you leave the physical
I'm privileged to have a opinion that people listen to
Hope this song can ease your mind if you're feeling miserable
I don't believe in fiction, facts make better movies
I cry freedom for Steve, Beco and fela kuti
They can never move mee even if they execute me
Listen to my words and every sentence cause I meant them truly
I believe that Marley, Marvin, Martin and Malcolm did
Become an alchemist with this evil I've been surrounded with
However is Mount Everest standing on the mountain stick
I'm not about to live on my knees with cuts around my wrists
I believe it's essential I represent my peers
Please let go of your fears and your sentimental tears
If Mandela got free after 27 years
Then I can change the world with this record that you hear
Cause I believe..."
IV My People Freestyle,Tony Talk,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","We live the mean streets’ life that’s meant for crime
Since my Boy’s Life, I’ve tried to live the dreams of mine
Only one life, and I gotta live by the schemes of mine
How to super size my pockets and spray cream of mine
I’m spending the most of my days, Rodining
How to get grands and champs and ride till the end
One formula to get by “take your life how it is”
But if you take it like a bitch, you’ll end up holding dicks
Hats off, I’m the wild man, this rap of Bear Grylls
I ain’t God or Jesus but they tryna test my skills
They all still run after a better life in a hamster-wheel
While I gon’ make bread of stones, they gotta share every meal
Jews would think I’m the Messiah that finally came
I written The Ghetto Testament, bringing bible to the game
I’m on the chapter that the world let the Armageddon begin
You oughta treat my words as a bird that fly to your hand"
What Your Life Like 2,Beanie Sigel,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
C'mon, let's try this Guru

[Verse 1]
When I was five years old, I realized it was a road
But at the end, I ain't seen lots of pots of gold
I seen a long cell block, the box, the hole
Six hundred fenced in - some innocent, some rotten souls
Some men with men - stop it, whoa
I ain't runnin' up in shit but a broad or a bank
Tryin' to cop a small hammer, move out like Shawshank
With Redemptions, I got my mind on revenges
They tryin' to kill me at the same time keep me alive
I'm movin' out like Adebisi on Oz
With my skully on tilt, two whacks in my palm
Posted up in the yard, everyday I think of pokin' the guard
Throw a crack a nigga turnin' me in
Tryin' to crack a nigga, turnin' me thin
Food soakin' in lard, news fools get opened in cards
For deputy drapes, in this prison life, what you livin' like?
[Chorus]
Can you tell me what you live like?
Can you tell me what that bed like, what's that cell like?
What's livin' in hell like? Tell me do you eat right?
Do you even sleep right?
Yo, tell me what your life like
Tell me do you sleep nights, tell me what that life like?
Gettin' no kites like, no flicks like
Make you wanna quit life

[Verse 2]
Them four letters is a motherfucker
That's forever like a motherfucker
Without a letter from a motherfucker?
It ain't even 'bout the cheddar from a motherfucker
Write a kite, some flicks from a motherfucker
Some drawers, some socks, some kicks from a motherfucker
I can't believe I'm doin' this bid for you motherfuckers
I'm down for another joker case
I was dealt this hand, and I'ma play it with my poker face
On the block ready to POKE a face
I got an L goin' around with a smokin' case?
You steal the deodorant out of CVS, you locked for retail theft
I got it body half a block stolen DT vest
My rap sheet read three deep breaths
Dangerous, duct tape daughters
I take to the street, like a duck take to water
Get your duck game in order
My bust game in order, I fluff 'caine with water
[Chorus]
Can you tell me what you live like?
Can you tell me what that bed like, what's that cell like?
What's livin' in hell like? Tell me do you eat right?
Do you even sleep right?
Yo, tell me what your life like
Tell me do you sleep nights, tell me what that life like?
Gettin' no kites like, no flicks like
Make you wanna quit life

[Verse 3]
That's fucked up, you 'bout to take your longest trip
And can't do shit, but suck it up, be strong and shit
Handcuffed, ankle to wrist, in back of the bus
Flashbacks of you back in the world
Can't fuck now you thinkin' bout who in back of your girl
Got her ass up (kill this bitch), playin' your crib
Thinkin' bout who raisin your kids
Shit was all good a week ago, 'fore they came and raided your crib
6:30 in the mornin', they kick your door in
Feds pour in, snatch you out your bed while you snorin'
You unaware of what's goin' on and
Come to find out, clients you had for years, turned informant
Told the law about the drops you make
How your clientele first started to escalate
Givin' him keys to your crib, was your next mistake
At that dinner table, breakin' out that extra plate
You can't turn a career addict off his coke habit
Put him on post with the toast that promote static
Back to the operation, they got you locked at the station
Fuck your back time, you worryin' about what you facin'
Heart racin', situation gettin' scary
Old clients are showin' up, at the preliminary
D.A. tryin' to bury a nigga to Neveruary, 31st
Goddamn, that gotta hurt"
Stranger Than Fiction,Outasight,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Outasight]
It’s sometimes stranger than fiction
But the weird things seems to be that
The storyline never stick to the script
And the characters involved don’t match the description
We all tied up yet we still tripping
Over the small things which seem to all bring me
Back to when I started, a hopeless romantic left broken hearted
A bright eye teen seemed to disregard
Any advice given about my future plans
I had to go and make things hard
Was told to go to school, was told to be a man, damn
But I didn’t grow up or be the lucky winner on “Who wanna blow up?”
And that’s fine, shit happens
All the trouble makes for a better storyline

[Hook]
And I tried…
I tried to make something out of nothing before
I tried to leave the past on the cutting room floor
But the story runs until the credits roll
But I do know that I tried
I tried to put the blame on everyone else
Looking for excuses rather than some help
I know that feeling when you don’t fit in
It’s stranger than fiction
[Verse 2: Outasight]
Play your part in the scene, never knowing lines
A beautiful backdrop, role undefined
September nights where breezes brushed across my back
Staring at the sky, fading in the black
Scratch the fingernails ‘cross the storyboard, I’m bored
I may need to be woken up from years before
And when the plot begins to twist and turn
I’ll try my best to keep myself on the road and learn

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Outasight]
Quiet on set, lights, camera, action
Take one, one take, no mistakes
Cut, check gate now roll the tape
Separate the real from the fake
Put the score on the board and it sounds great
No dialogue force on, course the break
Take five, try and enjoy the day

[Verse 1: Outasight]
How you gon find peace in this world?
When you can’t find peace in yourself
We all after a piece of the pie
Broken dreams, pieces in mind
And when freedom gon to be free?
Is this the price for being me?
I’m not sure what I’m supposed to see
No one get too close to me
‘Cause I can’t help it, always feeling wrong
What you selling? Oh, I’ll take one of everything
Take everything I got, it’s nothing much, it’s worth the shot
I’m not focused, I’m always tired
Can’t get my shit straight, cross the wires
Take two of these and make those doses higher-higher oh
[Hook 2]
Oh-oh-oh I can’t help myself from myself, no-no-no
Oh-oh-oh I can’t help myself from myself, no-no-no
No-no-no, I need a little bit of help

[Verse 2: Outasight]
And every time I play the fence, nothing is green on either end
Walk a mile in my shoes, tell me what you got to lose
Likely to move a whole lot slower
I know nothing of a best foot forward
She may bring you down, they may never grow up
Anything less of one thing, you probably need more of something else
And I can get a hold of any problem that you know of
Tell me when and where to show up, yeah, come for help

[Hook 3]
Oh-oh-oh I can’t help myself from myself, no-no-no
Oh-oh-oh I can’t help myself from myself, no-no-no

I'm tryin' stay over
And just stay my ass in school
Ain't many choices to choose
And this rap game I can't refuse
I wanna win don't want to be the one to loose
My pistol my only friend
Cause busters try to bring the blues
Leavin brains with no clues
Spin the ben in black clothes

Leave my folks on the front row
Bury me in providence
Heavy weight that rose
They wanna steal the B.G

I wanna be a role model for my lil' brother
And buy a fifteen room manison for my mother
Settle down wit' a solid ho
And drop a tight seed
So I can raise another uptown B.G

I'mma give 'em what I wish had, a dad
He goin' be smart and bad nigga
Throwin' up a solga rag
This world is kurupted
The police is crooked
My boy was runnin with a BB gun
His young life they took it
The judges is rotten
Everyday it get's colder
They throwin' away the key
Sendin' the soldiers to angoula

With they hand on that iron

Ain't to good in my neighborhood
Uptowns my partner
I ain't lie I'm tryin
To go the right way
But the night flight way
Just ain't the right way
I wan' be a gangsta but also wan' live
So I choose to be a uptown HotBoy hard to kill
Sittin' behind the cruiser wheel
Can't even see me I'm so lil'
And you expect me to give this
Just to switch to positive
As hard as I'm tryin' do it I just can't make a shape
School I'm tryin' go through it but I just can't make a shape
Gettin' in beef that resultin' into serious gun slangin
Do good I want yeah but on half I just keep hangin'
I'm lookin for a change but change ain't lookin for me
Will I remain a B.G
Or a A student
We'll see

Back on to blackness from which we came

Off to the weed spot to ease tension off my knot
Twist up the choc-o-lot, and the Fronto to make the brainz blo

Switch up park the truck pull the six up
Almost had to smack some bitch up (for what yo?)
Opening the door I'm tryin to get my dick sucked
Ain't no mix up as I spark the spliff up
In the club I can't be on the low
Cause some ho from some show

Prolific hard-core shit I gotta spit it
The hardest admit it put my heart in it
I ain't trying to see broke all wanna do is see notes
A few mill with an ill speedboat
And I quote Buck ain't daily good
Fuck words, I spits shots till you feel good
Love rap & I love mc-ing
Shit but still love killing every nigga in sight
No reason, we in duck season, watch out
Elmer bud, smoke the fuss pull the Glock out
Jack in box two shots pop out
Still money on the dow pitch stock out

The kids that only deal with that type of nonsense
You can't get wit, D.K.S. self evident
Adolescence, reign the supreme court, in any, every, meant

The time was approximately eleven forty three
When the D called me, and told me, we must be
Lyrically, the best that he says, the
K N O C K, and S and K, it's spray
Comin' away, the B.T.J., it be they
I'ma hold it down, with sounds
Like clowns, walk the trey pound
Now in the underground, B.T.J. just entered
Remember, the S comes last like December
Once shit cock it's time to Rock like the Monsta
In reality, B.T.J., is lyrically responsible for all difficulties
[Verse 3: El Sha]
My lyrics oppose a threat to the best M.C. yet
And appears nightmares for those who slept
Also the biters, claimin they writers
They need to think about what they talk about
When you exposin' your dirt, that's when you dummin' out
Dwellin' in the PJ's, all day, hangin' out with nothin' to do
Them rebellin' niggas is mad, 'cause I'm tellin'' the truth
Hittin' yo with mind craftin', flows to molecular cord graphin

[Verse 4: Lil Knock]
Aiyo one day it was me and the D
Walkin' down the street, some niggas stepped to me
Said are you Lil R-U-T-I-Z
He said I heard you nice on the muthafuckin' M-I-C
Battle me, battle right here, and let's see
So we kicked a verse that didn't hurt
So I hit 'em worst, to let him know I don't play those games
Save 'em for the jerks, D. Verbs said ""Son, let me get some""
I said ""No, 'cause he's a victim, and he probably in my premises
You know when I open my book with my lyrics I'm endin' this""
(No question) All this shit he poppin' in my ears
Fuckin' ejected, he can't hang with my style
Look now, here's man fillin' it, back to like what I was sayin
I start extortin', I'm not playin'
You want Lil Knock? I come on your block
Cock and then start sprayin', lyrics
So don't start what you can't finish
'Cause I will be sure to end whatever you created
[Verse 5: El Sha]
Mentally you can't function
Physically you dead with the push of this button
Explosion be corruptin', from the expert of execution
I met Lil Knock at the junction
He was talkin' about walkin', to the tree spot
We took the L to New Rox, we got stopped by two cops
Talkin' about ""Where the two Glocks?"", we doo wops
How was I two Glocks? Man, it's too hot
And I'm cold, so let me go, I never hold
Whoever told you, that I do la?
Lil Sha, fuck a do or die
Nigga die, because of what they do
I do what I do with my crew
Po-po was hype, they was like ""You bite, stick with the mic device""
Drivin' off, said ""Have a good night""
Personally I might, and all that shit I said was a psych'

Cigarettes give you cancer, woo-woos make you dull
While I sip the purple harlot, thick as my Southern drawl
Put me on the ocean floor with a mermaid with no drawers
They got bats up in the cave, upside-down
Blood rushing to they head, they reacting off sound
As I stand on the mound, pitching for the crown
Uptown-bound, face painted like a clown
Reciting scriptures from the chapters, Proverbs, Leviticus
Old-ass rappers complaining what the business is
'Bout the state of hip, sounding like some bitches
Hop your ass up off a rich nigga dick, it's ridiculous
The new school, nigga
What you need to do is become a resident under conditions
Get your ass up off your ass, and get your ass up on a mission
Become some competition, like Federer and Nadal
Young Money, nigga, we ball, like Kobe or Chris Paul
Forgiving a wack cracker, still sipping Cristal
Waving the lifeline, since life's a bitch, y'all
Raising up the skirts of Jezebels for no cash
Like, ""Bitch, gimme that ass""
Or pulling up to the lot, like, ""Gimme that Jag'""
No, pulling up to the lot, like, ""Gimme that Lam'""
They study me, yeah, they cram, like I'm a final exam
If I hit you in your back, you'll need a spinal exam

Irritating you pussies like chlamydia, yeast

Nikes on they neck, they like, ""Let me breathe""
""I'm sorry, but I can't—this is how we feed"" (Gangsta Gri-zillz!)
This is why we hot, this is how we freeze
Too fast to follow, this is why we lead
And the money in the pocket isn't why we G's, see
This is how we shoot, and this is how we leave (Gangsta!)
You know we tote steel, this is how we ease
You can get the steel if you try these thieves
Now, pass me the Swisher, let me climb these trees

Chamillitary mayne!
You know I had to do it
Mixtape Messiah 5, that's right
Somebody need to give me a solid definition of what swag is
Is that when ya bank account get built up so high
That everybody come out tryin' to sue you so they can get their piece of the pie?
Is that swag, huh?
Or maybe it's when a major label call you and ask you when your next mixtape droppin'
Cause they know you gonna have the streets on smash, is that swag?
Or maybe it's just a whole bunch of punchlines
Braggin' about how ya ball with no purpose at all
You already know I could do that, I could do that
Chamilli! uh! (uh, uh)

Let me start like this
Tried to put on skinny jeans and couldn't zip my zip (haha)
Nah, let me be blunt real quick
I don't wear skinny jeans cause my dick don't fit (woo!)
Always keep a Maggie close to me like Lisa
Known to keep a lot of cheese on me like pizza
Hakeem, y'all backwards like Meekah
Y'all better keep your eyes on me like features (like features)
Never be mislead
I don't care what any side switchin' fickle fan said
Yeah, still Street like Greg (Greg)
Hit you with a speaker they gon' call you ""bass head""
Bought a motorcycle cause I'm normally one deep

Kickers in the trunk trying to do the Chun-Li
Yep, yep, bet the wallet do the Gumby (woo!)
Stretchin' my green, stretchin' stretchin' my cream
Cash Rules Everything, I'm the Meth of my scene (yeah)
Come to Texas, we can bet that I'm king
I'm the best in real life and nothin' less in my dreams
Cars got the screens that they have in homes
Cribs got the same size pillars that they had in Rome
Traveled way to Rome just to grab a phone (okay)
I ain't even turn it on, haha
Paris Hilton got a man named Benji and she loves him
I'm in Paris with the benjies man and we hustlin' (uh)
Meanwhile I'm in customs
Chain so big, we lookin' like we munchkins

On a whole 'nother level, plus I'm eatin that's fact (that's fact)
Matter of fact you can take swag back
That's a word rappers sayin' when they know they can't rap (can't rap)
But your confidence higher than a stewardess
Just wanna laugh when I ask you who your jeweler is (haha)
H-A-L-M-OH!, so humorous
Been gettin' paid (been gettin paid) don't believe me, you can Google this
Got a major deal
Went and bought some green diamonds, why'd you waste your skrill?
I buy a green diamond, it's a baseball field
Nothin' Little League about me, I got major bills
Money like Mutombo (yeah), tall like this (yeah)
Money got a mumble and it talk like this (haha)
If money talks baby, pardon my lips
Ben Franklin always with me like he part of my clique
And I don't be in the strip club every night (right)
But I tell her keep the tax like you're Wesley Snipes (Snipes)
Even the white girls tryin' to get the pipe (why?)
All up on the nuts like a Nestle bite
The industry ain't somethin' that I feel is fair
Don't care if you well rounded, they just fill the squares
So I don't care unless it about a million shares
Standin' on a million, lookin' up like ""it's a billion where?""
And I am so sincere
I'm the baddest rapper here, let's just get this clear
And I wish a major would kick me out my deal
Cause I'd be the richest independent you should fear

But I won't tell ya how many and incriminate thee

You'll burn if you step, believe me, come see me
I'll make you see moons in the break of day
And make sure that your body slowly starts to decay
It's gruesome, I had to add my two cents
The next movement in rap guess who's sent
Outerpsace nigga, and we demand we eat
And if not we gonna leave a bloodbath in the street nigga

[Interlude: Vinnie Paz]
They asked me, concerning the spoils of war
Such spoils are the disposal of God and the apostles
So fear God, and keep straight the relations between yourselves
Obey God and his apostles if ye do believe
I'm so confused, take the world away
[Verse 2: Crypt the Warchild]
I'm a maniac, you need to watch who you war with
You in the land of stars when the block is enormous
Squash rocks with my hands, my palms is enormous
Flow the hot lava that I drop when I scorch it
Droppin candy rappers that get chopped up and snorted
Newborn kids they get chopped up, aborted
Planet warchild, when we pop up report it
Committin riot acts so we constantly torch it
Illest Puerto-Rock this whole process is morbid
Equipped with slaughter blocks, you get the picture-a portrait
If it ain't monetary, what's your reason for touring
All that shit you pop, to be honest it's boring
Been rockin the mic since before it turned corporate
You need to sit back and let your conscience absorb this
Before you ship that demo to them dudes in the office
Come test your skills for real in hell's fortress

[Interlude: Vinnie Paz]
I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth
Holding the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the earth
Or on the sea, or on any tree
I saw another angel ascend from the sunrise
Having the seal of the living god
He cried with a loud voice to the four angels
I'm so confused
To whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea
[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]
Immortal Technique, I live life strangling death
I walk through the land where the fallen angel is kept
But I will never bow down to a Pagan habit
Like Roman gods that were faggots named after the planets
The connotations of Revelation taken for granted
Mark of the beast, government microchips implanted
I'll be branded a maniac for speaking the truth
And I'll be murdered as soon as I hit the street with the proof
Illuminati trying to raise the devil at any cost
They probably cloned Jesus with the blood off of the cross
And I know that it's the same mother fuckers I see
That genetically engineered HIV
Controlling the population according to mathematics
Generated by Masons and the military industry
Sponsoring terror, creatin the profit margin that'll last forever
The crusades and Vietnam sand-blasted together
And you believe in ""whatever"", even a Federal promise
But the spawn of Shaytan could never be honest
And poor people pay homage and pray to a god
That the Vatican themselves don't really believe in
Cuz they'd rather worship money and the physical demons
Without biblical reason I execute em for treason
I don't need an alibi, cuz my place in history is the book of Malachi
Motherfucker
[Outro]
Immortal Technique; Harlem, New York and North Philly
The Angels of Death are here you motherfucker
We'll turn your cities to salt, nigga
Y'all ain't shit, and none of your peoples are shit
None of your children are shit
You'll all be dead tomorrow, you fake motherfuckers

Trinity,Jedi Mind Tricks,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: L-Fudge]
I metamorph phrases to glaciers
Have 'em come together in liquid stages
Then turn down the temperature and have 'em frozen into a solid foundation
Now added to that this well produced amazement
The crash is enough, to have the world tipped off it's axis a notch
It'll take the likes of, Jedi Minds to construct new longitude lines
In order to get around but now, you're askin' for too much
When minds put together
I'm like an alternative source of energy like, electricity generators
Separators of the wack rap, to the world reknownst individuals
Played in deuce parts life's nara-rators
Rhyme gladiators, is what we're referred as
Food for thoughts tooken offa ya plate instead you're served trash
Ikon and Logic serve as my accomplices
And bring our own form of trinity to show y'all onto this
Rhyme patterns come across as astonishing
So I have all right to feel myself to the point of genetalial fondlin'

I spread around me a viral infectious faculties
Applied chiropractically so rappers cannot come back to me
Simply outta respect, or suffer the consequence
The effect of which is that of absent father neglect
Wreakin' havoc, on egos speakin' magic
Castin' the curse on fashion emcees Parisian fabric
Send 'em wandering through the labyrinth
As far as cuttin' careers short on mics
I'm what the NYPD is to entrapment
The epitome of half-bent, yet schooled
Engineers peep the structure of my mind
Now they wonder how the math went
L was made to ascend, which is evident by my descent
Spreadin' east to west like European settlements
Sequence, but even, I'm captured
Self-destructive explosive devices react before my mind is ever mastered
Which makes me a Trojan horse of sorts
Drainin' your plasma till your rhythm section hardly contorts
My stats in the orators sport
Draw more foolish queries, than the Warren Report
And the single bullet theory

You fuck with me and won't survive
Ikon been live since eighty five
Monosyllabic havoc that’s tragic will crystalize
Hit them guys, in they eyes with fuckin' shrapnel
Bomb they castle, set fire unto they chapel
Wrap my lasso, 'round rappers who wanna battle
Hologram with two bare hands crush you to gravel
Evil raps'll, reverse time and bring diseases
Christians will worship Allah and Muslims will worship Jesus
Kill all ya leaders, with my savage lyrical thesis
Rip out my fuckin' heart and eat it before I'm defeated
The one who's seated, on the throne within a forcefield
Ya'll get tossed I'm the boss like Holden Caulfield
Raw deal, rappers decipher that schism
Followed Solomon and prodded him at ya baptism

Oh no!
What's happening to my brain?
I can't believe this is happening
Again!

[Verse 1]
Lava on my lips I flips, wake up think I have a cramp
I'm trying to shove the lava lamp up my father's ass
I think I'm out of gas, man, I need another mask
I'd ask my mother, but I think she's laughing at the plants
A half a gram of graham crackers and some Van de Kamp's
I think I'll eat some Ambiens like they're candied yams
Cut a couple cadavers up and have a little snack
Abra-fucking-cadabra, motherfucker, look who's back
Just like a pendulum, Satan's pentagram swings
I accidentally dented it and bent the damn thing
Shit, I think I might have did it when I was dancing
While I was chopping one of my legs off when I pulled a hamstring
First I Re-Up, then I Relapse
Go to rehab then I Detox after I see Doc
And I'll be back with the sequel, repeat the cycle
'Cause I react like the She-Hulk when I see NyQuil
[Hook]
Oh no! (Oh no!)
Here we go again (again)
Don't know (Don't know)
When it's going to end (When will it- stop?)
Uh oh! (Uh oh!)
Where did it begin? (When did it begin?)
So long ago (So long ago)
Maybe way back when (Maybe way back when) (Relapse!)

[Verse 2]
Into the well, baby Jessica fell, she may have wetted herself
Quit playing, get her some help
Mary Kay Letourneau was sending me letters from jail
Every day in journals, saying how she wanted to smother me in lettuce and mayo
I'm the medicine man, my medical marijuana
Was prescribed by a doctor, shove a typewriter up Per-
-ez Hilton's ass, shit, almost forgot that
He's always shoving something up his ass, so why not that?
And fuck it, while I'm venting, let's shove a vending machine
Up his rear end when he's bending over, pretending that he
Didn't say anything that would be offending to me
Stick his head in a blender, begin blending in G
Where should I put the pink sissy with the fluffy hair?
Put him under the stairs? People are already under there
Hmm, I wonder where... wait, I think the cupboard's bare
Stuff him up in the Tupperware and shove him up in there

Here we go again (again)

So long ago (So long ago)
Maybe way back when (Maybe way back when) (Relapse!)

[Verse 3]
Vicodin's like a nitrogen hydrogen vitamin
I bite into five and then I get high as a kite again
I like it when I get in my zone on the mic again
Who'm I kidding? I couldn't quit this shit if my life depends
I relapsed twice after I came outta Brighton then
Yeah, rehab's nice, I had my name up in lights again
You see that's why I can't decipher what life I'm in
I might pull a knife on your wife and slice her then dice her then
It sounds so enticing, isn't it nice when I'm hype again?
On nights when I'm like this, no time to write this, just type it in
If I could get my pen to slow down, what'd I write just then?
Man, I'm 'bout to hyperventilate, I just have hypertension
I have the type of mental state you couldn't comprehend
Unusually stupid of you for you to think I'm your friend
I usually do what I do and suffer no consequence
I offer no mercy, the controversy is once again

And it's kept on a ninety degree tilt
For me and my, diggy D-O-G's, doing dirt with ease
Should've got with that, niggas can't fuck wit deez (can't fuck wit deez)
Bitches straight pimpin'
Ain't no simps, and so the gang ain't simpin, it's a bitch thang
And step to this one how I figure
From six feet deep you push daisies and that ain't no maybe, nigga

Then you wonder why it's yo' ass that I'm comin' to get
Cause what I got I simply took a crook that takes it to the limit
Life's already a bitch - without me in it
I commence to make dollars and sense, pump lead
Only evidence, another ditch another nigga dead
If you a homey cap peeled if you play homeys
Never stay homeys long anyway, fuck it

Running and running and gunning and comin' to getcha
Running and running and gunning and comin' to getcha
Running and running and gunning and comin' to getcha
Running and running and gunning and comin' to getcha
Running and running and gunning and comin' to getcha

Celebrate,Bootleg,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Find the culprit who's snitching me out (all right)
Follow that bastard and learn his route (uh-huh)
I wanna know who imparticuler he's talking to
Kill 'em all and kill the bitch who let him in my crew

Type a letter to the bureau of investigation
Tell them hoes that they can't infiltrate my operation

Keep C-4 mounted under my establishment
Wait for you hoes come inside with no evidence

This shit is bigger than Mafia hits
Dapper don with the ensemble of killers and shit

Leer jet ready to take off to the Costa Rica
Blunt smoking and Dom sipping when my hookers seat ya'

Soldiers quiet, but I'm still angry when the plane lands
Members greet me Italian suits with a light tan
Goddamn!
I know it's time to see the big shot whose got
Buildings and yay yo and guerilla armies on the spot

Moments later we pull up into a secluded jungle
My crew was behind us but got lost when we turned in a tunnel

Sunshine, sea breeze, golf tee's, palm trees
This shit's unreal but my man is living it with ease

Waiter brings me cappuccino
His name is Nino
Retired enforcer for the New York based Gambino

Godfather comes out and takes a seat across from me
5 foot 9, medium build, look about 63

He said I heard you catchin' pressure
J'oo feeling the heat
We hear you're mobbin' in the streets

You got to set it off!!!

(Telephone conversation)
Boss: Hello?!
Bootleg: Hello boss I hope I'm not disturbing you
Members of d'cappo told me to notify you this morning about a shipment that's
Coming in
Boss: J'yea, I heard there's a drought out there in Michigan where j'oo at
I'm gonna send j'oo a thousand kilo's of cocaine
I want j'oo to sell it all
And j'oo send me my money
Bootleg: Well lets get paid
(conversation ends)

Fuck what you doin' now I'm boss!!!
Sippin' on Remi
Making reservations for the weekend Korea
Drug keeping over see a

Dedication and loyalty
Is the key if you wanna get paid like a G
Promotions cross oceans
Big bank keeping up with dope policy

Now when we
Step off the plane
Keep cool and don't offend me
Never speak unless you're spoken to
This man has keys to send me

Take a wolf pack
Stay strapped and ready to attack on these coast guards
No mishaps!
Perhaps
You'd rather take a train with the 'caine I'll arrange that
Are you with that?
When you get back
Contact Texas and our L.A. staff
Never let that
Cocaine get out of your sight
Whole keys don't fuck with halfs

Now if you get stopped at the gate
Theres one thing you must promise me
Before you cross me
Just think about death before dishonesty

Don't call me
Unless theres an emergency to attend to
I'll send you 10 niggas with fully automatics
To defend you

In a few days that shipment should arrive
Better send some scouts out
Keep a look out
Send two or three niggas on the coast
Standing post with they Glocks out

No problems
Just follow instructions everything comes out lavishly
We'll solve 'em
Our mission is to make money fast
And to make money flawlessly

Start stashing
When the coc's all home
Contact money paid workers and separate

Pimp action
20 steps from the club
And we cool, bring cheese to

My satelite trippin', I watch TV at your girl house
My homies fell through, we had a smoke-out at your girl house
Dropped ashes everywhere, burnt holes in your girl's couch
Put a pillow over it
I was gone before she noticed it
Just a glimpse into the daily happenings
Of one of them flyest to ever try his wings at this rappin' shit
In love with the rap hustle, I never turned my back on it
I run after money that's why them bitches run after me
Whack rappers on a dope beat: simple battery
Hot Spitta on any beat: that's a fatality
Vicious how you do it? I don't know it just comes naturally
Spitta Spicoli, Zig-Zag rollin' with my Cali homies
My patience for middle men has run out
Take me to the boss like the Mike Tyson code on punch out
I'm really on my grind
You just lookin' for a ride
Like you standin' on the side of the road with your thumb out

[Hook: Currensy] x2
Spitta is chillin'
The Planes in the buildin'
The bitches like us cause they say we different
From all them other niggas say they just not with it
Smoke and make music, I'm a modern day hippie
[Verse 2: Currensy]
Still on my New Orleans shit, asthmatic
Spitta keep a bag of Dodi and some Primatene Mist
I'm as vicious as it get
This is rap with rabies
I got a fetish for Chevy's created in the 80s
And you say you riding old schools too, you all mistaking
That's a 190E, just a old ass Mercedes
Know a lot of niggas hate me cause my pockets getting cakey
These fuck boys can't see the paper that The Plane see
Bumping Paper Planes by M.I.A
I'm partying in M.I.A
My bitches looking for me say I'm M.I.A
They trying to spy on me like the CIA
Call Cheaters on me, I just pay homie
To send his crew the other way

Ooh, you're...

Yo, I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot
Jump on top of my dick and work them hips until I bust a shot
It doesn't stop, I'm only beginnin', I'm bonin' your women
While you home all alone, I'm blowin' up in 'em
Sendin' them back to you, mad at you
Don't catch a motherfuckin' attitude
I'm just showin' you how this rapper do
Capital Punishment, when I'm up in it, suckin' it
Bustin' it out—nice blouse, let me unbutton it
You're fuckin' with King Papi Chulo when knockin' culo
Pop your mulos out the socket tryin' to ride with the sumo
You know my rise is high, word, I be drillin' 'em
Bitches be tryin' to ride, but the curve be killin' 'em
Fillin' 'em with the cash, my cheese premium unleaded
Come get it, first work the tongue, then let the Pun hit it
Split it in half, watch the gat, baby, take a bath
Be good, I might put away the wood and give you the mustache

I bang a stranger in my torture chamber
Feed the locas chocha pinga
While I force my finger where my bolas linger
I bring the pain like Method when I flex and flip the coochie
Puerto Rican to the core, but no Boriquas eat the pussy
'Scuse me for bein' blunt, but I've been eatin' cunts
Since pimps was pushin' pink Caddies with the fish tank pumps
Bumpin' and grindin', simultaneously grindin'
Climbin' up the walls, with my balls bangin' off your hymen
I'm a diamond in the rough, (ugh) bustin' in your face
Taste the sweetness of my dick, rip your fetus out of place
Yo, bitches already know the repertoire
Step in my car, let's start the ménage à trois, like Escobar
By far, I'm the best at all sex positions, forget the kissin'
I'm skippin' the tongue-twistin', TS Tradition

Some chick in back of me, bought me a daiquiri
Told me meet her in back of Zachary's
'Cause she heard I was packin' meat
I bagged the freak and hit the telly
Got the Phillies, lifted her belly
And ""Put it in Her Mouth,"" like Akinyele
Far from ugly but they used to say I'm too chubby
But since the money the honeys got nothin' but love for me
So rub my tummy and make a wish, I'll make you rich
Take your kids to the flicks, come back and fix your favorite dish
(Not!) You crazy bitch, I ain't with that, I'ma hit that
Split back to the shack where my other chicks at
Now can you dig that? I'm the mack, doin' my thing
Pullin' your strings, makin' you feel like you in a dream
It's the king of the Hip-Hop Quotables, givin' you multiples
Just by the tone of my voice in the vocal booth
I notice you doin' your thing with your crew
Is it aight if I come down there and sing to you?

Fast Living, fast women
They like to dive in that money, look she back swimming
She back grinning

And I can introduce you to good living and lavishness
Establishments, flashy whips
The baddest bitch, baby the man’s a pimp
YB, rockstar in the flesh
She never knew she had rockstars in the west
I never knew Marciano could make a perfect dress
How do you make it look like that? You're the best

You know I’m famous, so I put her in the spotlight
Let's hit the night spot then I hit the spot right
Get in that thing and just go, no stop lights

Got her choice of any drug, she say I’m her favorite though
Proud enough to go around, but know she like to face it though
Talk just like a lady, drive Mercedes, got your own
So how can I be a bad influence, Miss we grown
You sending me pics with nothing but them Vicky’s on
Sidekick sex, we iPhone bone
Love to taste it, so she take it all the way down her throat
I’ll make you famous, call you Miss blow it by the O
And if ya nigga got a problem, tell him see us, see us
She smell our aroma, sweet as California
Calling me her medicine, higher than she ever been
It was better than the weekend with the stars
Well, you can have it all, get the dream house with the car
You and your girls, day spa, getting foot massages
Lot of rock n roll, sex and the drugs

I do my thing from the Range to the planes
I can’t say that since I got money I’ve been the same
Sushi dinners, Miami summers
New York Winters, I’m a big spender
I get Louie delivered, Gucci flown in
We flew out, got our iPhone roaming
You knew how I did her, nigga just check her twitter
I bet a million she say the rockstar with her
Yeah, lets hit Sunset before the sun sets
She ask what’s next, well, baby I love sex
Rough sex, wild sex, hot sex, loud sex

We in the fast lane until they pull the car over

I'm hardly ever impressed by my competition
God given vocal chords that can open doors
Alot of pressure being this deep like a ocean floor
Ocean blue coupe seats feelin' soft and cool
She feelin' soft and sweet, Me? Philospohical
Heh.. take a second, I know that fucks you up
But to think on my level they gotta buzz you up
Fuck is up suckas better get your vision clear
You shadow me, I'mma son you to make you disappear
Listen here, I raise the bar with this bar shit
Somebody free Wayne, I got nobody to spar with
You niggas shit is weak, why should I salute?
You say shit like ""fuck you, pay me"" - prostitute
Zero - now that shit classic
I have every facet of this rap shit mastered
Bastard, backslash - all caps
W-W-W dot fall back, slash y'all slack
Dot smash y'all track, dot
Never calm down til they off my ball sack
So, if you still feeling like a female
Jot that shit down and send a nigga a e-mail
Hottest rapper ever, when they gon' learn it man?
Diddy had to drop me, I would've burnt his hand
Boy you should stop, what usually shocks
Reduce ya plots, just use your pops
Your past is dark, you future's not
Your music hot but abuse has got your fuse to pop
Abuse is not the answer - Fuck 'em
I whip they ass until my haters screamin' how we love him
I love killing these non-believers, they need they proof
I leave a fuckin' blood bath in the DJ booth
No pun intended, just punishment
I'm one-hundred with every nigga that I'm runnin' with
Cuz I don't run my mouth, I just run this shit
Why would I run from you when I'm the one you run and get?
And I stay in awe from the way these A&R's
Haven't found a way to call or even look my way at all
But as they play it off, I just say it louder
Boy I'm on it like a short-stop play a grounder
The way I found a life that I got from a dark time
Put a little bit of shine in my hard time
Put a little bit of grind in my wall climb
And I'm so full time, niggas part time
I don't partake they don't really wanna start mine
Shout out to the haters and debaters cause the way they
Makin' statements gonna make me the greatest of all time
And I'm all kinds of crazy - deranged
And I may be insane, well maybe this pain
Made it's way in my veins, so maybe just lately
When they sayin' my name, they can't guard the emcee
And Jay-Z would claim, it's like they gave Tracy McGrady the lane
And Baltimore the rocket
Uh - but minus all the bad tension
Best thing smokin' like a Bentley with a bad engine
It's point two - and I ain't stopped yet

That 24 Deep, no sleep, much stress, nigga
Nigga must be livin' up in hell
And here I am, same muthafucka that got my nigga sicc
Tryin' to kill myself but slippin' more deeper into the siccness shit
Guess what daddy's bringin' home for supper
Nigga nuts and guts and slabs of human meat, muthafucka
Now eat! Cause daddy's workin' hard for you nigga
Killas run around everyday that's why I'm hard for you, nigga!
Now eat!"

Uh, Wolf Haley, Golf Wang, go

[Verse 1]
I'm a fuckin' walkin' paradox, no, I'm not
Threesomes with a fuckin' triceratops, Reptar
Rappin' as I'm mockin' deaf rock stars
Wearin' synthetic wigs made of Anwar's dreadlocks
Bedrock, harder than a motherfuckin' Flintstone
Making crack rocks outta pussy nigga fishbones (Haha)
This nigga Jasper tryin' to get grown
About five, seven of his bitches in my bedroom (Hey)
Swallow the cinnamon, I'ma scribble this sin and shit
While Syd is tellin' me that she's been getting intimate with men
(Syd, shut the fuck up)
Here's the number to my therapist (Shit)
You tell him all your problems, he's fuckin' awesome with listenin' (Haha)

Uh, Wolf Haley, uh, Golf Wang
Uh, Wolf Haley, Golf fuckin' Wang
[Verse 2]
Jesus called, he said he's sick of the disses
I told him to quit bitchin', this isn't a fuckin' hotline
For a fuckin' shrink, sheesh, I already got mine
And he's not fuckin' workin', I think I'm wastin' my damn time
I'm clockin' three past six and goin' postal
This the revenge of the dicks, that's nine cocks that cock 9's
This ain't no V. Tech shit, or Columbine
But after bowling, I went home for some damn Adventure Time
(What'd you do?) I slipped myself some pink Xannies (Yeah)
And danced around the house in all-over print panties
My mom's gone, that fuckin' broad will never understand me
I'm not gay, I just wanna boogie to some Marvin
(What you think of Hayley Williams?)
Fuck her, Wolf Haley robbin' them
I'll crash that fuckin' airplane that that faggot nigga B.o.B is in
And stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus
And won't stop until the cops come in
I'm an overachiever, so how about I start a team of leaders
And pick up Stevie Wonder to be the wide receiver? (Cool)
Green paper, gold teeth, and pregnant golden retrievers
All I want, fuck money, diamonds, and bitches, don't need 'em
But where the fat ones at? I got somethin' to feed 'em
It's some cooking books, the black kids never wanted to read 'em
Snap back, green ch-ch-chia fuckin' leaves
It's been a couple months
And Tina still ain't perm her fuckin' weave
Damn

Uh, Wolf Haley, uh, Golf Wang

Goddamn goblin
Wolf Haley, uh, Golf Wang
Uh, Wolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah

[Verse 3]
They say success is the best revenge
So I beat DeShay up with the stack of magazines I'm in
Oh, not again, another critic writing report
I'm stabbin' any bloggin' faggot hipster with a pitchfork
Still suicidal, I am
I'm Wolf, Tyler put this fuckin' knife in my hand
I'm Wolf, Ace gon' put that fuckin' hole in my head
And I'm Wolf, that was me who shoved a cock in your bitch
(What the fuck, man?) Fuck the fame and all the hype, G
I just wanna know if my father would ever like me
But I don't give a fuck, so he's probably just like me
A motherfuckin' goblin
(Fuck everything, man) That's what my conscience said
Then it bunny-hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead
Now the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement
Actions speak louder than words, let me try this shit

All Summer Long,Kid Rock,"['country', 'rock']","[Intro]
It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

[Verse 1]
Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man, I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

[Hook]
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
[Verse 2]
Catching walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

[Hook]
While we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long

[Verse 3]
Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think man I'd love to see that girl again
(Man I'd love to see that girl again) Yeah

[Hook]
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow

Westside!

[Verse 1: Mack 10]
Microphone check 1-0
From the West Coast bailer and teller, I cuss like a sailor
When you see her, she’s a goner, moved to California
Blew the bitch up, and put the gangsta twist on her
Sunny Southern Cali, it never snows
Niggas yellin' ""HEY’S!"" and ""HO'S!"" (Woooo!)
We jumpin’ outta 6-4's
When it comes to the gun play, we vets (Agh!)
It's West Coast for life; no crews, only sets

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Well, it's the dog! Breathin' out the smog
I'm a hog of this gangsta shit, Don of the clique
All you suckas wanna diss the Pacific
But you busta niggas never get specific
Used to Love H.E.R., mad ‘cause we fucked a
Pussy-whipped BITCH with no Common Sense
Hip-hop started in the West!
Ice Cube bailin' through the East without a vest
[Verse 3: WC]
Now, as I look to my riz-zight and to my left
I see motherfuckers starin' like they wanna step
So I'm grabbin' my rusty screwdriver
In case I gotta cut ya deeper than Vanessa Del Rio's vagina
Find a-nother crew of niggas who can fuck with this
Lyrical bully givin' verbal bruises to crews, fool
You must be on dick, dope and dynamite; how you figure?
Speed on before you get peed on, nigga (Yeah!)

[Verse 4: Mack 10]
Fool, what side is you? Red or the blue? (Who?)
Wild as the L.A. Zoo, it's round two
I ignite, grab the mic tight, strike like a rattle (Ahh!)
Bring your rhymes and 9's to the muthafuckin' battle (Woo-ooh!)
So sun-down to sun-up, run up with my gun up
All brakes get to pumpin', you know a nigga dumpin'
You dread like a Rasta when I lock like a terrier
Mack 10 — that nigga with the heat that'll bury ya

[Verse 5: Ice Cube]
(Oh-I, oh-I) Do a walk by, and watch everybody die
Niggas into gangs, thangs and narcotics
Freak bitches, riches, and hydraulics
Pull heat! Knock you off your feet!
Clear the whole block, both sides of the street!
Even Crips and Bloods hear my thuds
Fee fie foe fum! Ay nigga, where you from? (Westside!)
[Verse 6: WC]
Fuck all you niggas, I'm yellin'
This is M.A.A.D. Circle to the fullest, everybody 187 (Yeah)
Toones play the piano, fuck a battle
I'm sockin' rappers like mad man Santiago (Arghh!)
‘Cause you niggas ain't impressin' me
Plus you signed to Big Red Records
So nigga, fuck whatcha tellin' me
Sit down, junior, you couldn't see me if you wanted to
Look ya'll — it's Mack 10, Cube and the ""W""

Ice Cube: Westside’s on the map!
Mack 10: Niggas rappin’ since the ‘70s and still never went gold!

[Verse 7: Mack 10]
I just had a scrap for the neighborhood Inglewood stereotype
Gotta deal with the hype
Known to kick back with the fat sack, fuck that!
Where my gat at? These niggas trippin’ off my Bulls hat (Oooh!)
About to let loose with the chrome trey-deuce
Fire shot and I, put holes in your bandana
I push a Benz, you still rollin' G's
Nigga, miss me with that set trippin’, start slangin' keys

[Verse 8: Ice Cube]
When I say gitchy-gitchy! Niggas get bitchy-bitchy
‘Cause they heard of the natural born murderer
I'm like Frankenstein, it's spankin' time
Layin' in the sunshine with only one nine
So who wants to bust with the never-rust?
Doin' platinum plus every time I cuss
So fuck the whole world, black! (Fuck ‘em!)
Niggas better hope I don't grow my jheri-curl back
[Verse 9: WC]
Step up, murderer! Steppin' out a Chevrolet
Sportin' a beanie like Marvin Gaye
Stalkin', walkin' in my big black Chucks
Standin' tall in your freestyle session, holdin' my balls
I'm peepin' game like a ref in '95
‘Cause niggas be foul and bitin' other niggas' styles (Ugh!)
But if you're bitin' this, you better bring a dentist
‘Cause suckin' these balls'll give your ass lockjaw, fool (Woo-oooo!)

[Verse 10: Mack 10]
Which way shall I go? Nigga, what should I do?
Should I bang with the red, or should I truce with the blue?
Should I rock dope beats, and grab the mic and stay down?
Or should I shoot outta town and flip this pound?
Shiieet! I never thought that my nuts'd get bigger
Checkin' major figures, I'm hangin’ with platinum niggas
It's Mack 10 and I'm Inglewood swangin'
No time for bangin', but still got my khakis hangin'

[Verse 11: Ice Cube]
Fuck one love! It's the bloody glove, killin' honkey hoes
Leavin' blood stains on Broncos
In a Hertz rental, I drive on the 405; is he dead or alive?
Mother-fuck court, took another snort
Jumpin' over chairs as I run through the airport
So I can catch a flight away from the drama
Number 32, chillin' in the Bahamas

[Verse 12: WC]
Aww! Shucky Ducky, quack quack!
Niggas ain't knowin' how to act
Sucka ducks play the back
Niggas used to diss, but now it's turnin' around
And like Brandy, motherfuckers wanna be down with this
West Coast rap game, I can give a fuck
If you wasn't down at first, you can buck these nuts
Transformers get stole on (BOOM!)
Get the picture — killa Cali; home of the body bags, nigga! (Ugh!)

Oh my god! look at that turn it up please
Poor Nancy Kerrigan's sweet little knees
Somebody took a black thing and went thump
That's terrible! We heard about it for months
What about that one nobody guy that they found?
Dead in the grass with his, dick in his ass
Plus there was more but you won't recall
Because Michael noskcaJ squeezed up on some little kid's balls
What you consider...Drama
Ain't all that, it's just that you're whack
We can intergalactic satellite data compress (Yes)
But we can't feed the homeless (Oh)
And then OJ's whack story unfolded
And everybody watched that while Oklahoma exploded
900 good reasons why this world really don't care
That's what it costs for a wheelchair!

Lordy-Lord we got a protest that (What?)
Some rock & roll ninja bit the head off a rat
Let's march in his concert, and chant him to hell
Cos he's so fucking terrible
Meanwhile his records sales double and triple
Cos of you worryin' about him rubbing his nipple
Religious? Shit, you helped them bands
Instead of helping them poor people eating out of them garbage cans
When you're done with them bitch, come protest me
Shit, motherfucker I could use some money
The whole world was crying when Kurt went co-bang!
When Eazy-E died though, it wasn't no thang (Nope)
Rapper dies of AIDS but you hardly mention
Rocker blows his face off and becomes a legend
Heroin and a shotgun, a hero is made
Maybe I should do that shit so J can get paid

Beat on and murdered and stuffed in their graves
You put a slave owner on the one dollar bill

Catch me running to the money until my feet lose feeling
Stack it wall-to-wall 'till it's leaking through the ceiling
Man, all fucking hundreds so whats that like a zillion?
Working graveyard shifts cause were finna make a killin'
Went from intern to the owner of the building
Bustin nuts counting money like: ""Oh what a feeling!""
To be seeing what I'm seeing
After I've seen what I've seen
It's like acting out a scene from a dream of my dream
I got a dream that's worth more then my reality
And pride that's worth more than a salary
And a text from the girl I love I stopped calling
Quote: ""I hope it's worth all it""
Sometimes I feel I'm working just to work harder
And then work harder then who worked the hardest
Man the life of a work-a-holic
You either on your work or just working on it

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Man fuck it kill'em all we gonna need a ton of flowers
And if you need impossible give me 'bout an hour
It's time to turn a Polaroid into a portrait
Rocking street clothes getting money like I'm corporate
Youngin' getting it isn't life gorgeous?
Bet the crib on 'em and you'll end up with a fortress
And Ima need that new condo, town home, brown stone
Should I fuck with the Dow Jones?
Or maybe I'll put money on the block instead
There's no need to save
I could get change off the street next to the meter maid
Cause I need a main house with a piece of shade
Butler doing such a good job that they need a raise
Bad chick with an Angel ass and an Aalyiah face
Tryna show a little TNA
Hell yeah I'm tryna see the day
Man, life is so bright when you don't see the grey
The new school appointed me to lead the way
A real nigga to the DNA
Me, Mike, Grace, and Dilla
Sticking to the script
And what's-her-name still licking on my tip
Go ahead and tell these bitches who they're fucking with
Man to get where I'm at I'll make her suck a hundred dicks
Man to get where I'm at I'll make her suck a hundred dicks
Her mouth lookin like Dannon
Because of me and Cannon
And to get where we at she had to suck a hundred dicks
[Outro: Big Sean & Don Cannon]
Man I got on Versace shades, Versace belt, Versace shoes
I might've fucked around and been the freshest nigga in the world today
You dont understand man I came from nothing
This what I dreamed about, this what we dreamed about..boyyy
B.I.G. Sean Don nigga, G.O.O.D. Music
Finally Famous in this bitch.. Errything...Detroit what up though?
Ayo Big, Motherfuckers always askin' me like:
When you gonna lend somebody else eat
When you gonna pass the baton on to somebody?
My response is: Fuck I look like Carl Lewis?
I feel like Usain Bolt, I got it running these streets
Who else do it better than me?
So you can cut all the chit chat out right now and just know one thing:
We're finally famous motherfucker"
Giant,Slum Village,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Elzhi]
The Moment of truth, from the flow in the booth
Is it a classic to blow through the roof
Just ask 'n let me show you the proof
We stronger than ever along with the pressure
Longer then lesser, we bonded together
Like a song belongs with a measure
We pawnded ya treasure, a thing I won't do for the chips
And this be speaking from my heart, so I ain't using my lips
Like a ventriloquist, and as I stand killing this
While this rain, critics won't admit, how I can and still exist
Its a introduction, discussin the info
Stuck in my mental window, thats meant to function
Let the people be the judge
We know and expect it, you holdin the record
Way before the needle even budge
The most hated on, and I stayed alone, was rated wrong
And its a headache, like yankin domes with a straightening comb
When our bread brake, articles of artists who aren't as hard yo'
Partners by fathers, regardless they are a star you know
Soon as it politics, with dollars become a prince
Be honest,if not I promise, I'mma just switch the style of it
With possibly what the game needs,with the same greed
You fakers is with,making a hit like when you playin we...indeed
[Hook: Elzhi + T3] (2x)
We areeeeeeeee
V- Villa, V-Villa

[Verse 2: T3]
They say a nigga fell off when my nigga [Dilla] exited
3 albums later I kill 'em gotta represent
2 albums back [Baatin] had left
Kinda threw me off balance, put a limp in my step
But I pray for my nigga you know it's one love
But let me tell you some shit that's kinda fucked up
Besides the tempting, it wasn't the empting
With the bling bling like Mr. Ching a Ling
So we didn't get a second single, or a video
So I say fuck 'em, get the dick like a pretty ho
I guess we didn't need 'em, thanks for the freedom
And every time we see 'em, we let the finger greet 'em

Family Reunion,Joe Budden,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Killah BH (Joe Budden)]
Uh-oh (uh), it's that time again
It's been too long, it's family reunion (Mic check, mic check)
We gotta school y'all to the game
(One, two, one, two)
You know what? Let's talk to 'em
Let's go (let's go, the wolves is out, nigga)

[Verse 1: Ransom]
Ain't nobody tryna rap or play me
I'll be at they crib with a couple hammers and a black old AV
Black gon' pay me, still get the smack off Baisley
'Cause I'm touching more diesel than Shaq old lady
Boy, you did it, I done it, I get it, I punish
The shit that I come with'll seperate a rib from a stomach
I'm the boss, when I spit it, you love it, matter fact
I'm a Viking, I need a whole village to plumage
Yeah, the nigga is here, the city is scared
You got the throne? Then I think I need to sit in your chair
We could really get physical here
And the sky's the limit nigga, I put your whole clique in the air
Baby, so quit playing, 'fore the clips spray 'em
And have his ass M.I.A. like Nick Saban
His whole shit caved in, my whole clique cavemen
Hard bodied nigga, my whole shit pavement
You can't spit if you dead in the ground
In the woods, where you had to be found
And it's good that you getting it now
In the precinct confessing it now
I can't fuck with the rest of you clowns, [?]
[Verse 2: Hitchcock]
I am the silence before the storm, Lincoln Park, the Audubon
Slang rock on the same block that the water on
I be more than gone, run and get your order form
Next time I record a song, gon' put my daughter on
'Cause she realer than most niggas, I tote triggers
For you broke niggas and gold diggers with no figures
That why I palm the heater, for all you non-believers
I'm on your ass like white on Rice, I'm Condoleezza
Better con the preacher, you tryna get on a feature
Better get your casket bastard, I'm gon' eat ya
We ain't in the same weight class, your fake-ass
Couldn't stop a nigga with brake pads, I'm way past
Anything that you ever did, I'm better kid
And we never sweat a bid, it's easy to get a SIG
In the bing, I'm like Ving Rhames, I bring pain
I sling 'caine off the wing like I'm King James
Y'all doubting who
When I spit the whole lead, they be calling Code Red like Mountain Dew
'Fore I count to two you could get your back blown
'Cause your gimmicks out of minutes like a TracFone
Get back homes, I'm back on my shit
I don't mingle, I'm like Pringles: stacking my chips
Clapping my fifth, you the test me type
Coming out with a Blade to get Wesley Sniped
So the cops could arrest me, right, it's not happening
You ain't ever gonna get on, so stop rapping
H20 coming this summer, so stop asking
All heat like Wall Street, ya stock crashing
Now the Feds want to read his rights
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ, I got passion
I'm Black and all my niggas getting this 'feti
We in the Chevy and ready to pop tags
[Chorus: Joe Budden & Fabolous]
So whatever you try and do lil niggas
I already done (Done)
And since you wan' live by it lil nigga
Then die by the gun (Gun, hol' up)
So whatever you try and do lil nigga (Like we always do about this time)
I already done (Done) (D-d-damn)
So how the fuck you gon' win little nigga? (Yes)
I've already won (Won) (Let's go, uh-huh)

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Ayo, money is the root of all evil I thought
But when I'm broke is when I usually have the evilest thoughts
That's when the arms come out, like sleeves when it's short
With more bullets than your favorite wide receiver has caught
And that Randy Mossberg, ya Steve Smith & Wesson ya
The shoes pop up like Instant Messenger
You've got mail, nah, nigga, you got shells
And my MAC, you can't use for iChat
I've got that, confused that with lie flat
And my gat is on leg like thigh tat
I that nigga, who you dudes?
Some broke niggas who tryna get some YouTube views
So 'less you want a point blank, boy, you're too close
Bail's in pocket, this is Lawyer Lou Los
I'm pretty sure more hotties seen me in that four door ridey
Double pipes like a sawed off shotty, nigga
[Verse 4: Joe Budden]
I flow sickly, riding, bumping old Biggie
Roll with me or lose weight, Nicole Richie
Fuck plat', if I don't reach diamond fame
I treat a nigga face like that old Simon game
Figured out why men try us, 'cause we O.D
On rims and thin tires, for that we Len Bias
All it take is a punch, he ain't brave, he a punk
I'll put his family in boxes, meet the Brady Bunch
How y'all feel yourselves? Should kill yourselves
Us Cowboys don't need you, you Bill Parcells
And you ain't gotta empty your pockets when the K's out
Whatever you holding is mine, we my PayPal
See I don't get how this guy is a threat
I make his life inept for a pie to the neck
Ride or die, I do both nigga, ride to the death
I a cappella the whole left side of his chest
Not retiring, still got that pension pending
Tryna pop the hood and see the engine missing
Double barrelled shotgun, how your men get missing
She got pretty brown eyes and she in mint condition
Oh, the SIG in the car, you dissin' moi
Take the ratchet go home and just Chris Benoit
Tell a bird like it is, you promise the broad
I one line her, you Isiah Thomas the broad
I could send a clique cartridge at a nemesis target
And catch a R.O.R. on some Jena 6 charges
Nah, I'll put this thing away, I don't even need a
Whole hairdo to clip 'em, all it take is one finger wave
Been in the [?] for days, show you how I'm real
Come home to the truck with the Optimus Prime grill
Handed out crack, got the scene poppin' off
They not sleepin on 'em, the fiends is nodding off
All real, tell me how you a thug and you Superman
I just seen you in the club doing the Superman
A bunch of clowns homes, all I
Need in this world is the pound chrome, Huxtable brown stone
Major paper, cake by the layers
If these dudes is live, I'm the Create-A-Player
They callin 'em Kings when they so so hot
Something's wrong with that picture, must be Photoshopped
I don't promote violence, but when sparkin' the flame, blame
Arms start waving like the Carlton Banks dance
When them tools go pop, it move whole blocks
Come around with your dog and get Kujo shot
These MCs is lame, I try to be a MC with brains
These niggas is MC Brains
Being nice, rappers is far from being nice
I'm on the rooftop recording, niggas is being sniped
It's like

[Chorus: Joe Budden]
So whatever you try and do lil niggas
I already done (Done)
And since you wan' live by it lil nigga
Then die by the gun (Gun, hol' up)
So whatever you try and do lil nigga
I already done (Done)
So how the fuck you gon' win little nigga?
I've already won (Won)

[Verse 1: Prince Po]
Pain, stress, my brain
Can’t even rest, it’s hard to maintain, the pressure
On my chest, excess frustration strikes!
Blood rushes my head when I come across roads with dead
Mics and wack promoted shows, it’s hard
But with the presence of God, I’m true to the game, so I’m back
Black, to take charge and recapture
The time, wish it could never be wack.  I’m pure
I insert my lifeline into the track, the energy in me
Is a poison with no unrevealed remedy
I’m spreading like leprosy throughout the record label
‘Cause mines put me and Monch’s career in jeopardy
Can you come see me in the ghetto where it’s dark?
Bullets are real, lost peeps lurks in the heart
Lord knows it hurts, we kick the Hertz to the curb
Execute first things first and put blunted minds to work
My herd’s tight and my fans supports, so I’m a-ight for
The time being, seeing peace but taking no shorts (No shorts)

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
You will now
Consider me the apocalyptic one.  After this
Rhyme, henceforth, there is none
No more will exist when I emerge from
The mist in whence I was born into, scorned
Most of you can’t even comprehend what I am saying to you
Even in my human form the message I’m relaying
Why do you choose to mimic these wack emcees?
Why do you choose to listen to R&B?
Why must you believe that something is phat
Just because it’s played on the radio 20 times per day?
My perception of poetical injection is ejaculation
The immaculate conception
The hall-walker who stalks bodies in Central Park
Soon, emergency services’ll outline that
Body in chalk, then I begin to walk away and spit
Then when I walk away, I talk shit!  Huh!
A jogger sprayed my face with mace, she didn’t
Know that I enjoyed the taste of radioactive waste
When I’m in the backseat of your mid-town
Taxi, don’t even ask me for the cash, G
The four cabs before didn’t pick me up
Now ask yourself: who the fuck’s gonna stick me up?

E.E. cummin' on her face, now that's poetry in motion
Yeah, Gambino make it work, I'm the boss, move somethin'
Yeah, this cool fuckin' suits me, swag two button
Yeah, these girls be actin' crazy when they're dancin': Black Swan
I ain't fuckin' at the club, put your clothes back on
Yeah, this beat is a disaster, 9/11 this track
Rappers wanna battle me, I have to mail their heads back
And my clique make that dinero, so it's time to meet the fuckers
I am runnin' this bitch, you are just a dog walker
Leavin' with your girl when we last seen each other
Yeah, you fuckin' with the baddest like we tag team Rihanna
Fly girl on her knees, she don't wanna come near me
Yeah, my dick is too big, there's a big bang theory
Got her picture in my iPhone, what do y'all think?
While y'all niggas masturbate, I'm in that Ariel Pink
If I am just a rapper, man, you could've fooled me
I'm the shit, when these dudes talk, they talkin' bull me, ah

Yeah, rah, rah, okay

Alright, I'm down with the black girls of every single culture
Filipino, Armenian girls on my sofa
Yeah, I like a white girl, sometimes we get together
Need a thick chick though
So it's black and yellow, black and yellow
Love is a trip, but fuckin' is a sport
Are there Asian girls here? Minority report
Put your team on the map, Blake Griffin on the court
Niggas bitin' off my tracks, need a knife and a fork
We the illest, need a nurse, here's the check, grab your purse
Unless we fuckin', then I'll pay for all the food on the Earth, man
I got some pussy that was insane
So insane, it's an enemy of Batman
I'm dominant, niggas call me faggot 'cause they closeted
I'm hot as shit, comin' out the backside of a rocket ship
It's monster shit, you dudes are the opposite of Loch Nesses
Respond to this, we can squash the beef right now like sausages
Chillin' with my n-words, say it like a white kid
Yes, your booty's big as hers, say that to my white bitch
So she don't get embarrassed, my dick is made of carrots
Bunnies wantin' to be fed it, I meant honeys, oh, forget it
I have worked all winter, I will not fail summer
In the back of a bush, like Gavin Rossdale's drummer
Yeah, my stinger's in her flower, I hope she let me pollinate
Workin' hard as shit, yeah, this beat is made from concentrate
Nigga, can't you tell that my sample of Adele
Was so hot, I got these hood niggas blowin' up my cell?
Swag out the ass, I'm the man, fuck chico
Took the G out your waffle, all you got left is your ego
Think about it for a second
Man, we eatin', where's your breakfast?
Man, you hungry, have this sandwich
Got my wallet, cheese, and lettuce
An elephant never forgets, so my dick remembers everything
Green inside your wallet is that pussy open sesame
Runnin' the game, fuck am I sayin'?
Runnin' the Earth, give me a month
Told all you niggas I'm in it to win it

Wake Up Reprise In The Sunshine,Brand Nubian,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Peace to the Gods, Peace Allah
A-yo, there go that brother Grand Puba
I heard that brother got knowledge of self
Yo, true indeed brother
Yo, let's have that brother come over and add on to the cipher

[Hook]
Sunshine, everybody looks for sunshine
Folks, get down in the sunshine
My life, my life, my life, my life!

[Verse 1: Grand Puba]
A-yo, knowledge this
The attribute Hagi
Helper-to-Another-God-In-need/He-Allah-God-Islam
As I proceed to civilize the uncivilized
Word of wisdom to the groove from the wise (Speak on it, God)
I guess I'm like the Verbalizer for the fact I'm movin' Blackwards
This Asiatic black man is a dog spelled backwards
The maker, the owner, the cream of the planet Earth
Father of civilization, God of the universe
Manifestin' thoughts with my infinite styles
Makin' sure this travels twenty-three million miles
The other six I set the crucifix
Because the heart of the problem is this (Speak on it, God)
Preacher got my Old Earth puttin' money in a pan
For the rest of the week, now I'm eatin' out a soup can
He has a home, drives a Caddy through town
Has my Old Earth believin' that he's comin' from the ground (Jesus)
Slain are those who fought for what was right
Slayed are those who fell victim to the pipe
A drug controlled substance contained in a vial
Set up by the devil as he looks and he smiles
Good at the game of tricknology
But I have knowledge of myself, you're not foolin' me
You see, the answer to me is black unity
Unification, to help our bad situation
I wrote this on a day of Wisdom, Power
All being born to myself (God!)
I won't diss the next brother to be paid, that's not my trade
It's just the plan that is designed by the colored man
Now our babies are born to think this is the way of us (The way of us)
That's the way the devil wants it, so it is no fuss (It is no fuss)
It's just that sad old song, ""Self Destruction""
To stop our reproduction
[Refrain]
They put our Wisdom before us (Murderer!)
That makes it Wisdom, Knowledge (Murderer!)
But we need Knowledge, Wisdom to bring forth the Understanding (Murderer!)
Culture, Freedom (Murderer!)
Power, Refinement (Murderer!)
Equality, God, Build, Destroy, Borns our Cipher (Murderer!)

[Pre-Hook: Grand Pupa & Sincere]
(Can a devil fool a Muslim?) No, not nowadays, bro
(Do you mean to say the devil fooled us four hundred years ago?)
Why-Equal-Self, a trader made an interpretation
Sayin' that we'd receive more gold for our labor in his nation
(Did we receive more gold?) God, Now-Cipher!
It's time to drop the bomb and make the devil pay the piper
(True indeed, God, true indeed, God) Why Equal Self
(True indeed, God, true indeed, God) Why Equal Self
(True indeed, God, true indeed, God) Why Equal Self
(True indeed God, true indeed) Why Equal Self

[Hook]
Sunshine, everybody looks for sunshine
Folks, get down in the sunshine
My life, my life, my life, my life!

[Verse 2: Grand Puba]
The solution: Knowledge of self to better ourself
'Cause I know myself, that we can live much better than this
Nothing's changed, it's just another sequel
The devil's still causin' trouble amongst the righteous people
Drugs in our community (That ain't right!)
Can't even get a job (That ain't right!)
Poisonin' our babies (That ain't right!)
Lyin' who is God (That ain't right!)
Well, here's some food for thought
Many fought for the sport, and the black man still comes up short?
It's time to motivate, build and elevate
Blind, deaf, and dumb; we've gotta change their mind state
So I dip-dip-diver, civilize a 85'er
Gotta let him know the devil's a conniver
This is the plan from the brother man from the motherland
Now it's time to take a stand
I keep strivin' to do my duty to awake 'em
To the universal family, I say As-salamu Alaykum
[Outro]
Yeah, now I'mma do like this
Nuff respects to the brother Jazzy Jay, nuff respect
Nuff respects, to my Brand Nubian brothers
Bust it, Lord Jamar, God Allah
Derek X is on the flex
Alamo is good to go
Sincere, the God is in here
So move on, black man, move on
We gotta move on, black man, move on
Move on, black man, move on
We gotta move on, black man, move on
Now, before I motivate, I'mma just say like this
Please-Educate-Allah's-Children-with-Equality
Move on, black man, move on
You gotta move on, black man, move on"

Bet my young ass show him money he ain't never got
Told him like this ""I don't care, do you give a fuck?""
Hit a few liquor stores, you know I ain't paying nothing

Ten stolen cars and I run like Troy Aikman
Make the hood hot cause I'm bringing back profit
OG's said B you know you gotta stop it
So I went harder, it really ain't matter
I'm like a girl scout but I ain't have no cookies
I had a real goon that'll tie up your family
Cut the thing down, put 'em right in his sock
I'm up all night cause I'm finna go plat
Caught the BART train to the East Oakland spot
Hit the dirty 30's with my dope fiend partner
He buying up dope, I'm just watching
He said he sniff rocks, it don't make me different
Make me go hard when I'm on a dead mission
I'm on the back seat of a pimp caddy-caddy
We driving around with dope in the baggie
Pressure, he'll do anything off the powder
And his goal was to put the pipe like clam chowder
I'm in the lick for the money shit and the power
A young skinny nigga, so I couldn't be a coward

I get in a nigga shit, with a mask on my face and some bo on my lips, nigga

And so kiddies... death for all, right right?! RIGHT RIGHT!!

[Verse 1: Cage]
I'm Against the Machine like Rage; bitches say, ""I hate you Cage!""
After circle jerks, I wash my hands off and do dirt
Sick with a smirk, plus happy disturbed
Fucked the first two bitches like dogs and I jacked off on the third
I'm obvious oblivion but that's my science
Fuck your head up like corn rows put in by blind giants
Haven't been with it, since the last corpse
Kidded, wore a blood stained smile, and told the cops, ""He did it!""
Of course the most raw throughout the 9-1-4, 1-0-9-4-0
Got you beasts shook like Doc Moreau
Pour beer out for yourself because you're walking dead
I'll burn your house down like a fucking Talking Head
And get high like fuck, and pick apart my brain
Dissections may mentally cause infections
Break you with inventions, sick intentions
Leave most MC's lost in my sentence
I'm strictly Beyond and Back, come and get me
Hemotobin, left from a lip like a hickey
Leak smoke got me ready to murder a rookie
Killers on your block tuck in they dicks like Tootsie
Come and witness what your shit missed
Watch the Glock kiss, Little Sis' wet her like a Baptist
Inconvenience; dilemma, like sitting on, Venus
With no shuttle, treeless
Try and pick apart some Agent Orange perception
Catch frontal lobe damage and not manage correction
I smell leak smoke, left by the anonymous
Beats brought back to life die when I'm embalmin' this
Come around and get yo' ass shot to clusters
I'mma play the Injuns with the arrows you be Custer's... back
I ride up on you, divorce your head and neck then scalp it
Rip off all your flesh and make a outfit
[Scratched Hook]
People said his brain was infected by devils

[Verse 2: Cage]
I survived abortion; got mushed in that canister-shaped coffin
'til stolen from the garbage I was tossed in
Instincts, snatch your cream like links
Blow shotguns through the sky, making E.T. eyes chink
See me twisting leak with my peeps from psychiatrics
Get high, run up in your crib and fuck your moms backwards
Lost in the dust, don't give a fuck about dangerous
I'm in it for the whip, plus the cream and the head.. rush
Ready to bust any trick that talk slick
Know a crew of devils in my head that force me to walk..
With, Death in my pocket for the curious
At your execution see twelve faces of Jesus in your jury this
Orange Agent, shit on a vagrant
Caught you in the alley by yourself and left your head vacant
Dare you sample, some of the stress in my life
Give an MC brain surgery with butterfly knife
For all you cunts that try to spit with your bitch clique behind ya
Wake up in the morning with a horse head beside ya
Ma Dukes is just a cherry on top
Spending G's on quacks to try and fix my Clock
I caught the quick lock, buggin' in the institution
Whatever sanity was left, caught the execution
Psychological pollution, they stickin' me with Thorazine solution
Shooting at the sky looking for Godly retribution
And I can almost see clear
I start buggin' like a insect and lay larvae in your ear
Agent Orange stomping on MC corpse slim circle body part
Call murder scenes abstract art
Split your sweetbreads it's the horror show in infra-red
Boots get planted in chest there for the misled
Lay it down for naps in the dirt, just like Clockwork
Undress your ghost while your brain's taking a squirt

We've done what they thought we couldn't
As bad as the odds were looking
Push yeah we kept on pushing
And every time I nearly hit the ground
You were my cushion
There's evidence that proves

You were there at my defense

Rock and a Hard Place,Ludacris,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Hell yeah
It's an everyday struggle
Trying to get out, trying to get out, trying to make it
Check this out nigga, what

[Chorus]
I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place
Bad luck is what results from my paper chase
I keep looking but it ain't no goals
So I don't wanna look no mo', what
I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place
Bad luck is what results from my paper chase
I keep looking but it ain't no goals
So I don't wanna look no mo', what

[Verse 1]
I need to get away to another day or place and time
And find where reality can ease my mind
And shine on me like the sun to the Earth
For what it's worth, my turf is rough and rugged so I gave birth
To a dream where cream lies between
All the dirt and the gravel, so I battle to achieve my green
And still try to move forward at a steady pace
Cause bad luck is interfering with my paper chase
So I erase the crime, lies, and sad cries
With sore eyes and keep mines on an up rise
But it don't work cause I'm steady getting jerked
By my neighborhood, up to no good, where bad niggas lurk
They irk me, leaving effects that's too negative
So Ludacris is looking for a better place to live
And I can't stand it, it's really got me bugging
It's like I'm in a war and I just keep on tugging
Cause I'm

I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place

Bad luck is what results from my paper chase
I keep looking but it ain't no goals

[Verse 2]
I try to find a way out of this maze, it's got me crazed
I'm in a daze, so many ways to boost into a different phase
But I can't think I can't do nothing, you think I'm fronting
You hear me grunting Lord, you ain't even saying nothing
I need some currency before there's an emergency
Forget crimes, I won't let my mind get the best of me
It's not gon' happen, I'm trapped in two worlds
On one side I see diamonds, on the other I see pearls
It's a whirlwind disaster with two damn sides
So I'm gone with the wind then come right back with the tide
I keep my eyes on the skies and my head in the clouds
And when my mouth is shut up, it makes my thoughts get loud!
Just like a crowd in a stadium, mills I be craving them
Money making schemes locked up in my cranium
Cause I need out of this critical situation
My mind's in jail, I don't know the time that it's facing
Cause I'm

Bad luck is what results from my paper chase
I keep looking but it ain't no goals
So I don't wanna look no mo', what

[Verse 3]
I'm sick of knocking, I'm sick of clocking
I'm sick of dropping in a hole, never reaching my goal
It's got my soul separated into pieces, it just increases
I'm hit with anger like a cook's hit with hot greases
So if you understood my attitude
Maybe you'd feel what I'm feeling
And it'd start appealing
To your intellect and aspect of dreams and aspirations
Death by temptations, even got my heart pacing
So I'm tracing a line where I can find a better path
And make it last, sit back and laugh before the aftermath
The tragic flaw is what makes it raw
So let it thaw and I'll get through it even if I have to crawl
My way, I see the sun and there's no delay
I'ma pray, cause the Lord'll make a brighter day
Or will he keep me in this holding cell?
But enough with the questions, the only story to tell is that I'm
[Chorus]
I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place
Bad luck is what results from my paper chase
I keep looking but it ain't no goals
So I don't wanna look no mo', what

Bad luck is what results from my paper chase

Hey Bobby,Sage Francis,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","By the time the flags rotted off of their antennas
They were questioning who the real threat is
Big Brotherly love is the 21rst Century's plague
No matter how bloody the glove, question evidence displayed

Don't forget what two plus two equals
Don't let them upgrade your math no matter what they have as proof of evil
Remember when they went after the Jewish people?
You don't recognize that same black mask as see through?

Attack of the eagles. If they don't fall dead
Before they reach me, I'll be damned if I don't shoot one in its bald head
Fuck what we're force fed. All I ever wanted
Was a warm bed and a house that wasn't haunted

I'd rather die for a cause than to die just because
We exhaust natural resources forced into wars
Restoring wasteful ways, keeping other countries poor
""Monkey see, Monkey do"" I wonder what those fucking monkeys saw

Keep rethinking the still-frames in your mind
And guarantee they will change with time
Your outline is pixelated with poor resolution while
Downtime is simply wasted. You were born execution style
Head first in a trial. I'll second the motion
'Til the jury's bored to death and puts your neck in a notion
The situation's volatile. A naked problem child
Is trying to find the right clown costume to make his father smile

So he bombs while he tries to tell jokes
This ain't a false alarm, can't you smell the smoke?
You're in the line of fire where they buy and sell votes
Our sense of liberty doesn't ring true, stupid, that's why the bell broke

Trench coat Mafiosos propel rocks
At recruitment officers and rebel against cops
'Til they hurdle infinite circles in small cell blocks
Turtle upon turtle 'til they're all shell shocked

This so-called president got elected in a court room
With the war efforts of pops he inherited a fortune
We ""talk, talk, talk..."" so the veterans of war assume
The revolution stopped. This ain't a protest tune

""Hey, Bobby...the Masters are back. They're up to no good just like the old days
They played dead when you stood over their grave, Bobby. They played dead when you stood over their grave
""Hey, Bobby...them bastards are back. It's our turn to stand over their grave
I'm a do it right this time...I'm awake...I'm a wait until their fuckin' skin decays.""

You can't roam a lost land as the last existing dinosaur
There's no escaping ass kickings in these times of war
Replacing apples with hospitals...where doctors are hostile
Killing two pterodactyls with one fossil
I got you. If they don't fall dead
Before they reach me, I'll be damned if I don't shoot one in it's bald head
Fuck what we're force fed. All I ever wanted
Was a warm bed...and house that wasn't haunted

Thumb through novels to have your fingerprints match
The description of criminals committing innocent acts
Of compassion for tired civilians crawling with pistols
While we fire million dollar warning missiles

Force the issues in the back of your head where eyes roll
Brainwash yourself out of that mind control
Or act a fool like you're told
But we won't see no type of justice 'til that bitch removes the blindfold

This ain't a ""Love it or leave it,"" it's a ""Change it or lose it.""
I'll never sing the anthem of a nation who never faces the music
Chasing an ever-elusive caveman
In space ships that makes trips to the futures that are name-brand

Faking progress...but we ain't advanced
Enough to change the posture of our ape stance?
They've got the key to the city but they prefer the break-in entry
Duck and weave, I'm shedding light in their shadow box to make it empty

""Hey, Bobby...the Masters are back. They're up to no good just like the old days
They played dead when you stood over their grave, Bobby. They played dead when you stood over their grave
""Hey, Bobby...them bastards are back. It's our turn to stand over their grave
I'm a do it right this time...I'm awake...I'm a wait until their fuckin' skin decays.""
Attack of the eagles. If they don't fall dead
Before they reach me, I'll be damned if I don't shoot one in its bald head
Fuck what we're force fed. All I ever wanted
Was a warm bed..

There's nothing scarier than the human stories I tell ghosts
Chilling accounts with my tongue frozen to bed posts
The catharses of carcasses whenever threats are close
Shows a heartlessness that doesn't register on stethoscopes

Sell your hopes for a homeland security chart
'Til your sense of self is broke and no man's pure in the heart
Preventive detention for the folks who never left home
Tensions have grown into a 24/7 red zone

Scare tactics...have got you under control
The fear factors of a color code. The uppers know
They can't hold you down without having anchors attached
""It's all the same."" Nah, balls and chains on ankles don't match

So drag your torso back to the off road
We may have lost the fashion battle but we ain't lost the wardrobe
Go window shopping for your next free meal
Cuz when we start the revolution all you'll probably do is steal

""Hey, Bobby...the Masters are back. They're up to no good just like the old days
They played dead when you stood over their grave, Bobby. They played dead when you stood over their grave
""Hey, Bobby...them bastards are back. It's our turn to stand over their grave
I'm a do it right this time...I'm awake...I'm a wait until their fucking skin decays."""

[Evil Thriller laughter]
(Get him!)

[Verse 1]
Want me to get him? Well, I got him
My mouth is an Uzi and I shot him
With the hundreds of rhymes and rhythm designed to make him rewind
This time I draw the line
He's mine, just chill
Don't nobody touch him 'cause I'ma get ill
The boy's phony as a three-dollar bill
And this time, I shoot to kill
Just like a sucker, you took the bait
Now you're like a dead fish on my dish, too late
So party people kick your feet up, I'm about to heat up
You're hungry for a battle, now it's time to eat up
Boy, I'm gonna chew you, 'cause I knew you
Was talkin' that junk, punk, now I'ma do you
The way you should be done, call you my son
Make you say, ""Daddy, I don't want none""
I've had enough of you actin' tough
You huff, puff, grab your stuff, you cream puff bluff
Talk about a battle, but you don't wanna do it
You got yourself into it, you blew it
You egomaniac, I'm a brainiac
You came back with a stone cold plain attack
Your rhymes are weak-wack, how can you speak that?
You need to sneak back to the drawing board Jack
The Ripper, down with my zipper
You get paid to be a Moe Dee tipster
Trying to knock the way I rock, get off my jock
I'ma knock you out the box, let's go

Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Let's go!
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go

[Verse 2]
Put up or shut up, get up, yeah, what up?
Huh, get on the microphone and get cut up
Talk about how your records went double platinum
With those lyrics? Huh, I laugh at them
So, you got paid, take the money you've made
Bet it on yourself, are you afraid?
Money talks, B.S. walks
When I stalk like a hawk, a victory is chalked
So put your money where your mouth is, you don't know about this
Battlin's for real men, and I doubt if
You can even hang or give a run for the money
You're just a sucker, and it's funny
How you never ever had a drop of juice in New York
And now you go on tour and try to talk that talk
You try to act like you're a big man, but you're a big fan
Stridin' and hidin' while ridin' my big man
You ain't got a chance in the world
Your records were smokin', but you sound like a girl
(How you like me now? I'm gettin' busier
I'm double platinum) Hold up, is he a
Man or a girl? What in the world?
You sound like Cheryl the Pearl
And you wanna battle me on the microphone?
Leave that crack alone
Let's go
[Chorus]
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Let's go!
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
I said let's go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Come on, boy, let's go!
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Better than me?

Picture that with a Kodak
I don't take no shorts and you know that
I roll hard, run the rap yard, put up your guard
I don't get even, I get odd, Todd
Always one up on ya
And I tried to warn ya
You slept, you took a back step
Ruined your rep and wept, you should've kept
Your mouth shut, you know what?
You gotta say you're sorry (I'm sorry) So what?
You call me a punk, you wanna see who's soft?

Look what you got yourself in
Just usin' your name, I took those L's
Hung 'em on your head and rocked your bells
Now, here we go, blow for blow, let's throw
Rhyme for rhyme, yours and mine, and yo
When it's time to battle rhyme, I know
How to make it flow, so let's go
To the ring, rapper's sing and swing
Words and verse, see who deserves to be king
Serve a blow to that ego
As if you didn't know, let's go

How can you say you're the best?
Get put to the test in front of a million and fess
Tried to withdraw because you saw
The juice I gots not like before
Huh, I'm formidable, unforgettable
You're submittable, you look pitiful
Yeah you're headstrong, but you're dead wrong
Wanna survive? Stick with the love songs
Take off your shirt, flex and flirt
And leave the real hard rhymes to the hard rhyme experts
If you don't, boy you'll get hurt
Feel like dirt and have to revert
To comin' on stage butt-naked
To make up for what you can't do on record
Open your eyes twice the size and realize
I'm on the rise and you're on the demise
Ostracized by my reprise
Step in my face and watch how that head flies
I mean business and I'm serious
I ain't sellin' out and now here he is
Frontin' and fakin' and talkin' about makin'
The money from money, now don't you know they can
Use your support 'cause you got caught
Signed, sealed, delivered, sold and bought
A puppet on a string with no heart
A fool and his money will always part
You used to be a rapper, turned into a businessman
Loafin' on the job and cheatin' the fans
I'm too potent, powerful and spiritual
Mental, emotional, physical and lyrical
You wanna beat me? It's gonna take a miracle
You've got a lock on my jock like a pitbull"

Masterin' my temple man, tryin' to expand
But when they think you simple, man
They'll try to play you out like you a simpleton
See what I'm sayin'
Niggas want pain not mercy
I'm writin' in my Moleskine on the train to Canarsie
Stand clear of the closin' doors
The people are in constant fear of a Trojan War
The vehicle that's supposed to free us is just an whore

Won't be that illest nigga that you never knew his name
I'm looking at these fake A&R's like, ""You a lame
That boy a genius and you ain't even listen, man, you insane""
But you'll see though, just what the hell a nigga 'bout to be though
So give me one year then play this back like TiVo
'Cause boy I'm finna blow, I'm a motherfuckin' torpedo
The music's in my blood so watch these niggas turn mosquito, uh
I play the villain and the hero, some grow man shit
Feel like a goddamn kid, man I'm Pac and Big (What up?)
""Up"" is something that I can't give
Won’t see me disappear like the old Aunt Viv'
'Cause even on a slow jam, I'm so damn sick
Man I even spread a virus to a program, quick
I gotta focus on my flow and get some dough, man, shit
No dollars got me actin' like I got no damn sense
But peace to my broham's and to my ex-lady
Yeah we been complicatin' things with the sex lately
Maybe I'm being selfish, but nah, I can't help it
'Cause girl we go back like a throwback Celtic, Jersey
Regardless of where God lead us
Just know that I was Martin and you was my Gina, uh
But I'm through living in the past, Lord
No more thinking rewind, I'm more fast forward
Less rear-view mirror and more dashboard
I'm visualizin' cash and stamps on a passport
That CLS with a full tank of gas for it
Cop my mom a whip, nigga, and she ain't even ask for it
Wise enough to know that money can't buy you happiness or lovers
But it's gon' get my mama out the struggle
Wise enough to know that money can't buy you happiness or lovers
But it's gon' get my mama out the struggle
Said I'm wise enough to know that money can't buy you happiness or lovers
But it's gon' get my mama out the struggle, nigga

Been There Done That,Dr. Dre,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook (x2)]
I been there, and done that
You got guns? Ayo, I got straps
A million motherfuckers on the planet Earth
Talk that hard bullshit cause that's all they worth

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
No question, it's all about the D-O-E
So if money is the root I want the whole damn tree
Ain't tryna stick around for Illuminati
Got to buy my own island by the year 2G
Since way back, I've been collectin my fee
With the 48 tracks and the M-I-C
Got a palace in the Hills overlookin the sea
It's worth eight, but I only paid five point three
Worldwide, like the triple beam I slide
Listenin to your demo in the stretch limo
Is how I ride, cartel style, vaults stacked to the max now
A million dollar style, niggas wonder how
""Dre Day"" every day
Trips to Montego Bay with more chips than Frito Lay
Floss jewels and attire, ain't nothin' flyer
Straight or illegal, it's still the root of all evil, cause
[Hook (x2)]

[Verse 2]
Young black Rockefeller, hella swiss and mozarella
Pockets sweller, gettin money like a bank teller
Cause a fool and his dough soon split
So when you come across a fool get all that you can get
Ladies, get your paper too
Don't expect for no man to support you, keep it true
Cause most niggas erase hoes that's out for the pesos
My woman's independent, makin dough by the caseloads
I'mma keep buildin', make a killin'
Kick back relax, and grow old with my millions
That's where it's at, you got drama, I got the gat
But we both black, so I don't wanna lay you flat
Instead let's get paper, while it's paper to get
Private jet, 600 Coupes, then I run Vettes
I'm livin on another level that y'all ain't been yet
Spend a mill', no sweat, water the lawn with Moet

[Hook (x2)]

[Verse 3]
This is for the millionaires, throw a stack in the air
And watch niggas start plottin, bitches start to stare
Cause game is money, and money is game
And broke niggas make the 45 flame with no shame
Now many people die over these dead green guys
Ignorance and greed take they ass by surprise
It's the root of all evil and sins
Yet and still it makes the world go around like my 20 inch rims
Moolah y'all, platinum plaques cover my walls
Grindin, diamonds shinin, without one flaw
Get the cash, the grass, the ass and bounce
Luciano in all amounts, that's all that counts, cause
[Hook (x2)]

[Outro: Dr. Dre]
Uhhh, yeah, uh
Yeah, uh, yeah, uh
That's right, ha
All these people out talkin about who they are, what they got
Heh, it don't even matter
Been there, done that
As long as you true to yourself, gotta be true to yourself
I was always told
If you don't stand for somethin you'll fall for anything, ha ha
Yeah, that's right!
The Aftermath, beatin up on your eardrums
Heh, gotta say whassup to King Tee, and my man Nationowl
They up in here, gotta say whassup to Chris the Glove

Milky, and I'm back
My ace in the hole was this brand new track
I'mma slow it up and speed it up and now you're gonna eat it up
Listen to the funky beat, my tongue is gonna beat it up
I did it, but the devil didn't make me
I did it for the suckers who tried to shake and bake me
Proving a point that I'm a serious joint
You can roll me up and puff me, and then I'll anoint
Your head with oil--lots of oil
Make it run like water, watch it boil
Cause I made 'em play it, made 'em say it
Made 'em okay it, made 'em obey it---HUH
Prince of the growl is on the prowl
How You Like Me Now punk? You living foul
Here's what my game is, kill is what my aim is
A washed up rapper needs a wash up, my name is--

[Chorus]
Jack the Ripper
Jack-Jack-Jack the Ripper
Jack-Jack, Jack-Jack, Jack-Jack, Jack the Ripper
(King Hercules!)
[Verse 2]
Back for the payback, I must say that
I heard your new jam, I don't play that
It ain't loud enough punk, it ain't hitting
This year you tried, next year you're quitting
Last year you thought I was dying out
But again, and again, and again without a doubt
It's the gangster boogie, the earthquake sound
Pump it up and play it so they hear it all around
I do it up rough, tough, I don't bluff
And this is an example of funky stuff
When you wanna make hits, you make 'em like this
They ain't like this they don't hit, they miss
It's a strong record, a record for the strong
For those who appreciate real rap songs
Listen how I won't allow myself to go off track
Stay back, I got the power, I'm--

Jack the Ripper
Jack-Jack-Jack the Ripper
Jack-Jack, Jack-Jack, Jack-Jack, Jack the Ripper

[Verse 3]
Jack the Ripper, a man, not a myth
A-k-a James Todd Smith
Hard like penitentiary steel
Breaking necks while I flex my sex appeal
Homegirls in the house, c'mon
Homegirls in the house, give it up
You gotta want to get hotter
Moving and grooving, and always improving a lot'a
People don't know how nice I am
He was sleeping, so now I gotta slice my man
Like ham in a pan, wrap him up in Saran
Kidnap him and slap him up inside of a van
While you're doing your dance I want you to make moves
No one out there thought you could do
You know my name and my game and what I'm here to do
Party people, lemme see if you can dance to--

I'm double platinum, I'm watching you get dizzier
Check out the way I say my, display my fame, my

I love to ride the groove because the groove is smooth
It makes me move and I'll improve
As it goes on, as it flows on
When you see me, don't ask if the show's on
How that sound? Don't came around, playing me close, brown
Pull on my jock to be down
You need to stay down, way down, because you're low down
Do that dance, the prince of rap is gonna throw down
Aiming to please while I'm killing emcees
I'm gonna keep on hitting you with rough LP's

I'm a beast on the microphone, a night stalker
A killing machine, a savage street talker
Jason with an axe, but I put it on wax
To eradicate the suckers who thought I had relaxed
The prince of Hip Hop, straight from Queens
Kicking it mean, keeping it clean
And you've never seen anybody rock the party
All you funky beat-aholics, this beat's Bacardi
I go to the show, and terrorize emcees, don't you know
Moving my hand like I'm playing the piano
Don't touch the dial, don't change the channel
Don't let me hear you say I ain't debonair

On and on, and my Glock I'm palming
Take two shots, and call me in the morning
You ain't gotta see P. Diddy, to get a warning
Or go to Big Poppa, to ask him who shot ya
I'm the doctor, this lyrical surgery
The truth in the booth, while y'all committing purgery
I'm a star on these tracks G, go and ask P
With the flow, water's the only thing that can match me
Apply pressure, that'll knock off your shoulders
I'm finna to do away with these, knock off Hovas
Spit a sixteen, end your careers
Since you can't see me, tell somebody lend you a ear
Now they listening, the picture's clear
I'm in the top spot, whack raps can't get you here
And that's the reason, why I got this nice bling
With these Bathing Apes fits, and this kicks by Ice Cream
[PJ]
Six in the morning, back on the block
With a big black Glock, and a pack full of rocks
Back on top, out of the FED's
Outlaw nigga, back getting his bread
Straight from the hood, that's all I know
Sell grams of this dro, or grams of blow
Hustler fa sho, the O.G.'s told me
Trust no nigga, do my dirt by my lonely
Most niggas fony, fraud as hell
Rap or the trap, got bars for sale
Niggas be hating, pay em no mind
Keep fucking they bitches, stay on my grind
Hate to see a nigga shine, mad and shit
Niggas act like, they never had shit
PJ nigga, G fa sho
Just hit a nigga up, when you need that snow

My flow is hell-a-vicious, your's is repetitious
I's a playa spread the word, go tell them bitches
They just mad at me, and hate me gladly
Cause I ain't they baby daddy, pushing that baby caddy
See I'm that nig, they call C. Wig
That pump more oil, than a fucking oil rig
I got a style, that the whole world can dig
And I can make any track, snap like a twig
Even though my flow, is kinda hard to catch on
You gotta do like Lambo doors, and latch on
On my hip like a phone clip, the strap is attached on
If you disrespect the kid, leave half your back gone
See all my life, I done rolled with G's
Thugstas hustlers, and I roll with thieves
You niggas, is pussy
You need to check yourself between the legs, to see if you got ovaries
As for me, my pockets stay overdosed with these
And I got more dames, than churches got rosaries
Yeah-yeah I'm C. Wiggity Whoadie Weez
With a attitude, that can take on four of me's
I got goals, for the future
And one of them is to sell c.d.'s, overseas
I mean I'm to the point, where I'm trying to weigh my own salaries
Hundred percent fat, plus high counts of calories
You know, I get in these hoes head like allergies
And have em bidding over the dick, like they at those galleries
These new rappers, don't flatter me
Even though they say imitation, is the highest form of flattery

Thank ya but no thank ya, dick riders

The Boss is back, the Boss is back
I told P let a G, G talk to that
You wanna be like the Boss, it'll cost you black
Saw a lot of good years, I'm a flosser black
Whether rap or crack, the money the proof
A straight hustler from the youth, nigga that's the truth
When y'all was shooting hoops, through the nets and loops
I was standing on the block, or standing in the booth
Like I'ma get it, like Nino or Snoop shit
Either or, but fuck being poor
I'ma walk up the block, till my legs get sore
Spit hits in the mic, till my throat get raw
Run the streets, if it's peace or war
If I gotta squash beef, shoot the heat some more
We're here this evening, for one reason
To keep the streets bleeding, this Outlaw season
The light green, for me and my dream team
To be scene from Queens, to the streets of Bejing
So clean when I hit the scene hot new drop
New bop on the block, picking up a new knot
Got the number one spot, records sell or not
Nan nigga wanna see me, in that parking lot
Nan nigga wanna see me, when it come to the diamonds
I'll blind him, you crazy I'll out shine him
Rock in the pinky ring, cost mo' than your set up
Chain so heavy, I can barely hold my head up

This one for my niggas on the grind, moving rocks on the corner
Laws on watch, streets hotter than a sauna
Hustlers getting paid, always keep the heater on ya
Cause them niggas start to hate, when your paper gets stronger
My paper getting longer, your paper getting shorter
My grind mo' stronger, I hustle mo' harder
I'm way mo' smarter, than them other rap dudes
With them bad attitudes, cause they broke and confused
I'm at peace, no beef with no crews
But if I battled on the beats or the streets, I won't lose
I'm a motherfucking winner mayn
Every contest I enter mayn, way back since I was a beginner mayn
By far, I don't bar the war
I take the top off your car, and fire up a cigar
Niggas bitches, need to wear panties and bras
Niggas snitches, and they don't even know who you are
Just talking, for the spotlight
I ain't hard to find, you can catch young Slim Thug out nights
Up in the town, fucking around
Having fun at the same time, clutching a pound
Face a clown, wanna do a show
The fo'-fo' blow smoke, like a nigga blowing pounds of the killer dro
They act hard, but them niggas know
Come playing with the Boss man, and get you bumped off man

These hating ass niggas, love to see you doing bad
That's why I grab my pen and pad, and do these niggas bad
Stay fresh to death, till my body out of breath

Stick to the G-code, real with this game
I done been through it all, and I'm still in the game
Selling cocaine, gotta get it how I live
Might blow a nigga brains, gotta get it how I live
Pull up on the scene, everybody freeze up
Thugging like a motherfucker, staying G'd up
J's on my feet, with a fresh white T
I'm a Outlaw bitch, you ain't gotta like me

Chick-a chick-a I'm, chick-a chick-a on
Chick-a chick-a my, my, own shit
Like an entrepreneur, that stepped in manure
Man I'm newer than a Jack I went up the hill with Jill
And Jack Jill's big bootay
We did the booty up, I told the Bitch she Betta Have My Money
Or step to the AMG
You know Com Sense, oh yeah him be
That nigga that be making all the bid-by-by-bye sounds
But since then, Common calm down!
I'm on some calm shit watch Com get complicated
Simple motherfuckers say the way that Com communicated
Was too complex, I got a complex not to complain
On my brain no complain and so will my community
And I prefer compliments
So I complement at an angle of ninety degrees
It's the nineties and music got known for the grease
I got a sense of direction and a compass
Com passed emcees with no compassion, though I heard the screams of
But I ain't shy, so why shall I comfort?
Com should have been at the fort with Jeff I'm so ill
But I chilled in my compartment with no company and no meals
Now Com could get the penny, but I want my own company
And Com is on a mission not to work for commission
It's a common market and it's so much competition
But to me, competition is none
To my comp I'm a ton I get amped like Watts in a riot
My compact disc is a commodity, so buy it
Instead of competing with Pete
Com compromised, Com made a promise
Not to commercialize, but compound the soul
With other elements, compelling sense into Communism"
Endangered Species Tales from the Darkside,Ice Cube,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Female News Reporter & Ice Cube]
""At the bottom of our news tonight, there's been a new animal aimed at falling off the face of our Earth. Yes, young black teenagers are reported to be the oldest, and the newest, creatures added to the endangered species list. As of now, no efforts have been made to preserve the Blacks. When asked why, a top law official adds, 'Because they make good game'""
(A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown)

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Peace? Hahaha, don't make me laugh!
All I hear is motherfuckers rappin' succotash
Livin' large, tellin' me to get out the gang
I'm a nigga, gotta live by the trigga
How the fuck do you figure
That I can say ""Peace"" and the gunshots will cease?
Every cop killing goes ignored
They just send another nigga to the morgue
A point scored, they could give a fuck about us
They rather catch us with guns and white powder
If I was old, they'd probably be a friend of me
Since I'm young, they consider me the enemy
They kill ten of me to get the job correct
To serve, protect, and break a nigga's neck
Cuz I'm the one with the trunk of funk
And ""Fuck tha Police"" in the tape deck
You should listen to me cuz there's more to see
Call my neighborhood a ghetto cuz it houses minorities
The other color don't know you can run but not hide
These are tales from the darkside
[Interlude: Chuck D + sample]
All of us are endangered, damn!
(A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown)
(A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown)

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
You wanna free Africa? I'll stare at ya
Cuz we ain't got it too good in America
I can't fuck with them overseas
My homeboy died over keys
Of cocaine, it was plain and simple
The 9mm went (buck) to the temple
(Buck, buck, buck) was the sound I put the bitch down
And ran to the schoolyard bathroom
Looked in the trash can, yo it had room
So I ducked my ass in it for a minute
Covered with trash I had to lay back
Mad as fuck, thinkin' about the payback
Tonight the crew gonna have a little fun
I went home and cut the barrel of my shotgun
It's gettin' critical - I stole a 5.0
I let it go - drive real slow
I yelled out ""Ice Cube, sucka""
The shotgun kicked, and it murdered motherfuckers
I told you last album
""When I got a sawed-off, bodies are hauled off""
Its a shame, that niggas die young
But to the light side it don't matter none
It'll be a drive by homicide
But to me its just another tale from the darkside
[Segue: Sampled guitar riff]

[Verse 3: Chuck D]
Standing in the middle of war, the minute we flex
When we die, we won't make Jet
Ebony can't see to the light side
The term they apply to us is a nigga
Call it what you want, cause I'm comin’ from the corner
Same applies to a Ph.D
Who's black - don't wanna roll - sells his soul
Watch his head go rollin’
Who the fuck are they foolin’?
Nobody knows, but I suppose the color of my clothes
Matches the color of the one on my face
As they wonder whats under my waist
(Standin' on the verge) of them gettin’ brown
That's a fact, got a fear of the bozack
Run, run, run, their ass off, they can not hide
Yeah Cube, they can't fuck with the darkside!"

I know that's your friend, but you first need a man
And regardless to what I do
I'mma stay on my grind, bust my heat and make sure there's food
When we can't stand the rain in the rolex now
And we feeling like a shell jammed up in a barrel
All we gotta do is talk this out
Now you tell me who that man that got hard who set foot in this house
Girl you must not know bout me
That shiny thang in the room gon pluck a tree
And don't make this the reason I ain't touch you in eight days
I thought you was on your friend, thanks, he was leaving you mad late
You pulling out your hair, you scratch my face
Rip my rhyme book's wilding, and you trashed the place
This is unjustifiable

Cus I ain't gotta lie to you
You're irreplaceable (Irreplaceable)

Why you niggers coming at me funny like I owe you?

Keep the peace, keep the peace, I keep my eyes underneath

Headed to Detroit blazing tree until I'm brainless

Dont Hide It,Lowkey,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Logic]
My name is little Jake
My mum calls me the big mistake
Birthdays come and go, I’ve never seen a cake
Most days I’m locked in my room, at least then I’m safe
Without her
Other times I gotta do housework
My mum and dad fight, mum loses so she hits me
She even put me in hospital, they had to fix me
And my mum and my aunty get lit cigarettes and stab me
Oi mum, why did you have me?
To treat me bad?
You left my dad, he used to save me
He used to ask you why do you hate me
And lately my mum makes me fight my brothers a lot
My mum and my aunty watch laughing
I’m hungry I’m starving
Cold beans and bread
My future ain't good I’ve seen ahead
And I ain’t got friends
I’m 9 years old and will I get to see 10...
I don’t know
[Hook]
Don't hide it(x4)

[Verse 2: Lowkey]
My name is Chelsea, you could swim in the ocean of tears I have cried
When I was three years old my dad died
When I was six my mum got married to some guy
Three years later my mum died, but why
Did her husband have to get custody of me?
Since I was 9 he’s been doing stuff with my body
And I need to be rescued
Coz this strange man is touching me in places that I know he isn’t meant to
I wish life could be the way it was before
Now he comes in my room, turns off the light, and locks the door
Now I can’t sleep waiting up for another day
One time I got the courage to run away
But that was very dumb
Coz he found me and told me he’d kill me if I ever told anyone
I gotta go, yours truly Chelsea
P.s… please help me

[Hook]
Don’t hide it (x8)

[Outro-->Lowkey]
This one is for all the children suffering abuse as we speak (yep)
All over the world
This one is for you; if you relate to this song
This one is for you

Signs in Life,Kano,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook 1: Kano]
There are lots of signs in life
Some that you may not like
You could be living this minute …
The next minute you're gone away
So hold up your hands my brothers
And be conscious my sisters
And by your worst, you will get paid

[Verse 1: Kano]
True, you can move food on the street
Did a bit of that, got bored of that
Didn't move the brown or the crack
Use to pick up for the fact
I could make more back by breaking down to scores and that
Stack to buy out the stores and that
Didn't give a shit about loads of that
But I did give a shit about getting locked up
Or get boxed up, sentenced you'll get about 4 for that
Crap, you ain't so rich now
I bet you feel like a prick now
'Cos where's all your fancy shit now
Where's your whips, chicks and your bits now
Shit, you should have fixed up
Fuck drugs, the mic you should have picked up
And it was all for the big bucks
Now you're sitting in a cell doing sit ups
Blood I told you this shit's fucked
The ghetto lifestyles too much
If I bust, be proud of me
You can't take it out of me
So I'm a bit stuck
But, I got too much to lose now
Love my life, and I don't wanna lose out
I'm still about, I'm home sweet home
In the ends, like I don't wanna move out
I'm too bad
[Hook: Kano]

[Verse 2: Kano]
Look, you can do moves on the street
I'd rather spit bars on the beat
I'd rather that than lick cars every week
But jack is when I split scars with the heat
So I'm so low like the guitars and the beat
But this rhyming shit is for me
I live this, drink this, eat this, shit this
And I've even writ bars in my sleep
But I ain't on hype, I've had enough phase
Ghetto's probably inside, hope he buss case
That undergrounds like road this, a tough race
You can be living this minute, then gone again like mum you was right
And I was wrong again
But I'm strong again
Still moved on again
Ten more minutes and I writ another song again
If I can do it, you can I'm a true fan
Up and coming MC's big up you man
The doors open but I ain't through man
I'mma ball through like a cue Dan
Watch me, ain't gonna let no-one stop me
UK I'm gonna break you properly
And if you ain't gonna watch me do that, move back
Who's that? K-A … I knew that
And I know its not easy, and I know what you're feeling
Just believe me
[Hook: Kano]


[Verse 3: Kano]
That's why I don't feel I'm safe
I fear I'm bait, but I can't put my skills to waste
Because if you're living by the gun you surely will get blazed
I still don't blaze, refuse to smoke my life away
Refuse to die before I try then put the mic away
This life of K, is just one big hype for praise
Write, night, record then start to write again
But I'm just saying, back on hype of Kane
But only I'm to blame
Today I saw the signs again, and it's not a good look
But ""that's life"" they say, crime pays
And I'll stop crime whenever this grime decides to pay
But grime ain't making me meals
So I'm picking up a 9 today
And spitting ain't getting me deals
But this shits just getting real

This shits just getting real... [x2]"

I heard the same shit, money drive a burgundy whip
Keep a low fade, license plates engraved ""PAID""
Where's the cat from, think he's from New Jerusalem
Pretty Rick did his thing for him, but he was using him
Boss Sun's younger physical, you know the God
He go with Tip, the one who called Lover of God
Why Equality Self, I know the Master Allah Now
It's time to get the God U and blow like mines
But on the low I heard he got Born Original sent
Back in a drive-through Kentucky Fried shot up his Ac
We got to get him dunn, aliens is snatching our bread
UFOs moving in with bigger plans than Feds, yo
Knock on Daddy-O's door get the scope
He's not home, he took Ishmael to Park Slope
There go the the dreads yo, swindle two bags of that skunk
That get you crashed out had you laid out like bums
Peace Kiana, what's up with your girlfriend Wanda
She drive a cream Honda, with legs like Jane Fonda
I just left her, she took Regine to Pathmark then
Jetted to Canal to get her man some Clarks
She should be back in ninety minutes, Ghostface
God forbid she safe, BCW was watching the kids
[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Two hours later, scheming like DeNiro in Casino
Son better have more coke than Al Pacino
Kiana ain't telling no lies, last year she did a sting and a half
With Tymeek bought him a aircraft
But anyway, yo, Daddy-O home, we need the shotties nid-ow
When we get back, throw you a thid-ou
Later that night, stay mesmerized yo
Go get the green 5, meet you on the corner of Now Why
You ready, you got the E&J and the machete?
We going upstairs, I hope one nigga is heavy
We walked in, both of us, looked like terrorists
Masks on, second floor, dun yo, I handle this
Kick in the crib, the whole shit looked graphical
Natural, fucking a white bitch, actual
Fiends chanting, ""Do your thing Chef, handle it""
I shot him in the neck, it ricocheted and hit Carolyn
Ran to the back analyzing, much disguising
Surprise is coming in their eyes and tranquilizing
Bugging, throwing the twin cousins at his nugget, fuck it
Meet shottie waddy slug body hobby
Where the drugs, where the ounces you be bouncing
Fake cats announcing on the block, you lounging
Where the blow at, I ain't got shit, stop fronting
(Yo Chef, throw the joint in his mouth, money'll stop stunting
Bitch, hold that pit, before I push your wig back
Chef stop waving that, show him where the paper at)
Come here Valerie, you know the God he need a salary
Put down the pipe here's two tickets to a coke gallery
It's in the kitchen in the ceiling

Only found a white block of cheese from New Zealand

Yo Chef, where that shit? What? What? Aiyyo...)"

Rippin' the label off the 4-0, based on the fact
I got respect for my dead folks, props for my nigga locs
187's in the hood, I can't say shit
One-time thinkin' it was premeditated
I could eat a view from the deuce-fo' block
40 in my mind, makin' me think I'm gon' get shot
In deuce-fo' deep, the nigga with the sickness
A nigga with hella enemies, always cool and 86'd

Fuck it, created the X-Raided, now I'm tryin' to get rich
Ain't that a bitch? That snitch, nothin', nothin'
Motherfuckers mad cause they can't make tapes
And I gotta get paid, so I can buy my 4-0
To live the atheist life that I was brainwashed to know
Niggas run up every day, wantin' to get some
I told them who runs the motherfucker flow and then some
Win some, lose some, like a nightmare
I got enough shit on my mind, I just can't care
I'm on the run, runnin' from who's-ever gun is aimin'

Tryin' to survive in the hood is hard enough
Cause them niggas already thinkin' I'm claimin' Creek Mobb
Trippin' on gettin' snuffed by the view, smoke in the Gardens
Stayin' out the creek, cause it's hot and hella hard to get
A dub up without gettin' caught, and them niggas know it

And don't feel it, that nigga, that nigga that raised the shit
Raised a Crip, but really can't fade the shit no more

Pack me some ammo and a futhamuckin' 4-4
Can't pack a piece too often
End up having another sucka's guts hanging off 'em

And as I creep, I peep mista locsta with the gun outta his holster
Thinking he supposed to point it at me
But now everybody loves a cop killer
Just about as much as a young cap peeler
So what I did is grab my nine BUT-
Before I put the clip in-
All I heard is pop pop pop, what, I'm trippin'
My body's leaking blood, I can't call it
One time murdering a young alcoholic
I'm on the ground with a 40 spilled on my chest
Bullet holes and it supposed-to-work bulletproof vest
Caught slipping, my niggaro's

Kicking it with them fellas drinking 40's on the block
Talking about what my dice will do when they drop
Then all of the sudden- Damn, I think saw a gun
After I heard the bam that made everybody run
I'm trying to run but I ain't 'cause I'm falling
My body's getting numb, I hear my mother calling
My heart stops but it don't feel like I'm dead
And now I'm seeing black, puzzled and surprised
My worst start nightmare was now realitized
And—I didn't even get me a chance to say goodbye to my mommy
Ambulance covering my body
Put me in the truck, closed the door, stuck a tag on my toe
And put me in a drawer, case closed
Another innocent victim victimized
In the wrong place, at the wrong time
My story was wrote, the book read
Now I might be laying here dead
But I'mma walk to my funeral
(Mia Bruce)
(Can you feel me)
I want to know why don't you just listen to me
Why don't you listen to me
(Can you feel me)

(Brotha Lynch Hung)
10 o'clock at the set Lynch crept
Some nigga rolled up in a mob wanted a cigarette
Nuttin, ay, now I'm smoking on some indo
And on that note, he stuck a gauge out the window
Break yourself for that dank and your cash
Foo try to take my grip and then mash
I'm like whattt, heh, I'm not going out, fool
I bust 'em out ol' school, and swing my thangs real cool
So what up? I'm not tripping off your gauge, what up?
Ain't even packing, you the brotha with the gauge at my gut
So bust
He start loading me full of them shells
There wasn't no way I was dropping, I'm bloody as hell
6 holes in my body and I'm trying to walk
Graveyard straight callin' me, I'm living off a nerve shock
And on my tombstone 1990-deuce
And I go but I'mma strike to my funeral

[Outro]
Yeah in the mothafucking house my nigga Shades, you know
Thanks for accompanyin' me on this mothafucka, you know
And we gon' do some damage, you know, in the 9-deuce
You know, so I'm going out like that

Pull off in the Regal Man, rollin that reefer
Holdin a lethal, felony piece in my pants

Stashin the mask with the cash Bumping that Beanie Sigel

I put you up nigga, don't trip
You did your dirt for that mark
And he left you in the dark
Sky-divin' in a bullet-proof parachute
No remorse, left you hangin
Easy aimin, lock down shoot
The Glock sounds tootin
One minute til' I'm in it
Got a business, still they ass to death
And get my scrill up in the corner, none left
Shots out to my nigga in the pen
Didn't switch, didn't act bitch
Try to stop a nigga from gettin rich
You could dig a ditch, but you won't find shit
Left you in flames, kept the roach
You can smell the shit when I approach
I be off that stanky sack of indo-nesia
It's a evidential
I leave you hungry, eat yo cheese up
Heard you was sweet, like a Almond Joy
And I know you heard of me
Cause I'm a West-Coast Bad Boy
And I'm a sick nigga, ""Sicc made!""
It gets real as I pull the pin out this grenade!
""Body Parts"" like the movie
Old school Uzi
Rip yo arms out from the elbows
Nigga I smell those green leaves
The six thieves
A twenty-sack of green weed is all I need
I make you bleed, I take yo cream
I know you got it from the ""Ice Cream Man""
Before you make that transaction
I need the cash in my hand
And if you don't, we can do the murder-man dance
Under any circumstance, I'ma have yo hands

The new code for halfs and wholes is t-shirts and tennis-shoes
From the yay, I got the sneakers
Sixty-five for a shoe nigga, if you got the tweakers
Meet me down-south, New Orleans we bumpin
I get this bitch jumpin, you got the money
I got the g's, flip the ki's, and the o-z's
We could blow some weed
And talk about this shit smokin some trees
But watch yo back, keep yo handle bar cocked
Too many Federal Agents pretend to be hustlers, but really cops
Send it across the border, nigga like Taco Bell
Put it in a plane, a boat, UPS, nigga I could get it there
I'm surrounded by cocktails, I mean hoes in mini-skirts
Ain't no free dick out here, it's time to put in work
Put these hoes on a Greyhound, fool if it's goin down
And make 'em bring it back, from my hood, to your town
And it's all good, nigga it's like wax
And we could slang these records like motherfuckin crack
And if they bumpin, we gotta keep 'em jumpin
Cause it's all about the cheddar, the cheese, and the money

A criminal tatted front-to-back
Always 'bout my jack
Doin a dope-deal, forget to bring yo strap

Who cursed, my dope and money life
A Eagle with blood stains in the scope
Be my wife, live yo life
Til' death do us part
Start my gangsta bounce
Thirty-six ounce, to a ki
Got this T-O-D in ya face
Now tell me the fuck else you got free
A thousand pounds of that skunk
Ready to jump, smokin everything I can, huh

Let me serve some dick to these niggas with they tongues out
Eighty-five in the south
Twenty-four in the east
See my scrilla, blow like yeast

And you can dub it all in high speed and watch that bitch nigga scream
And it's nothin' it's no thing I hit the corner
You was lucky and nosy nervous at the corner
I woulda grabbed the body stabbed the body
Then cut the body up like meat and eat 'em ganja leaves
Grab the shotty and get away got away scott clean
So you grab the body I'm in the Mozarotti
Smashin' down I street, all the way from the jail house
Gave it a chance and then I had to bail the hell out
Tight shit but I don't wanna go through that

So many demons out to stray me
The wrong way but I ain't gunna let them take me
Out of place, out of time
If I stay out of sight I'll be out of mind
If I lose my head, I'll lose my focus
Rather lose my dough before I lose my soul
Asking me questions I don't know
I don't know if I coming or I'm going
They think they know me but I don't know them

Staying sane is my main concern

And everything seems much closer than it is
Up front so put your brave face on

Now there was just one day that I will never forget
I got jailed for something that I'll always regret
It was twelve o'clock, midnight and I wanted a snack
So I headed downstairs, thought the fridge was packed
But when I opened the door, what did I see?
The back of the fridge staring right at me
I thought to myself I could almost die
Then an image appeared, a pizza pie
So I put on Adidas, headed out the door
As I pictured myself eating more and more
But the store was closed, I busted into a rage
So I went to the crib and got my twelve-gauge
Ran back to the shop, busted down the door
And all I saw was pizza galore
So I stuffed my face, I couldn't even walk
I couldn't laugh, smile, shake, giggle, wiggle, or talk
So I fell asleep with my face in my plate
And the next thing you know, I was headed upstate

Well, Kool Rock is my name, last part is ""-Ski""
And I have the worst case of any MC
But listen to the story cause it's kind of strange
When I had this sort of hunger pain
Walking down the street with the bass of my box
With my stomach growling like a hungry fox
When I saw this scene or was it a dream?
A big restaurant sign called Burger King
So I went inside, started stuffing my face
Didn't even think about the things I ate
But when the bill came up, boy, was I shocked
I said, ""I don't pay for nothing, I'm the King of the Slops!""

Now I'm sitting here alone looking at the wall
Just thinking about how I took the fall
I thought I was cool, I thought I was slick
And now I'm writing letters of being homesick
I lost my freedom when I heard the door slammer
And now I'm breaking rocks with a big, heavy hammer
I used to drive the streets with my big car
And now I look and all I see are bars
(In jail) Everyone's the same
You only survive if you play the game
You don't have knives, you don't have guns
And now you remember you're your momma's son
You made her cry and stay up all night
Coming home high, just leaving a fight
You always made her feel that you were better
But now you're a little boy just waiting for a letter

Tooken Back,Ghostface Killah,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","""Take me back, take me back, take me back...""

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo, yo, aiyo you brought me on Jerry just to take you back
After that bullshit you put me through a couple months back
That wasn't right, call the cops on me, and told them I had it like
""Yeah, pop the trunk, he got dope and guns""
Check for warrants, that son of a bitch on the run, I know
Three of his niggas got life, he use to roll with
And told 'em I bodied an upcoming basketball star
Once I heard that, I fell out the cop car, real hard
You bugged out, and thugged out, wanted me to take you back
That could never happen, I'm sorry
No disrespect, but you a psycho, honey
Got that S.S.I. money, and you start actin' funny
Shrimp's every night, ordering steaks
Them jumbo joints, them shits cost a buck 50 for eight
And when you told me your Merlot, need more grapes
I said ""Honey, you never had wine before!""
And if you did, that's not how you act at all
And no... that's not how we rock in Theodore
[Hook: Ghostface Killah (Jacki-O)]
Please, babe, I love you
(Take me back, I'll never do it again)
Always want you
(You know that you my lover and my best friend)
Yes, darling, it's true
(Come on, home, where you belong, let's get it on)
Please, babe, I want you....

[Jacki-O]
Back to them days, when the yay' was bein' frontin' to you
Hundred thousand dollar shopping sprees wasn't nothin' to you
When three was a crowd... but I dealt with it
And your sex wasn't wild.... but I dealt with it
I always felt shitted, you should of take me back
The girl that introduced you to boy, and helped you open your stacks
I got you in South connects, for the hard grind
That's why I took mine off the top, for the hard time
You know you need me in the streets, to help you run things
And if you catch a case, you got it wrong, I'mma pawn rings
I'm your lady boo, that's what I'm suppose to do
I know when you was coppin' my Coupe, that you was coppin' two
I know when you got me the red one, that she got the blue
But the way I chew on you, you should of got me two
Now you got me in the kitchen, with your fryin' on
Tell me that you gon' move with me, I know you lyin', dog
Who loves you baby? Nobody like Jacki-O
Cook, clean, break up your weed, and I give you nasty throat
What you actin' for? Get back in the door
Come on, home, where you belong, let's get it on
[Hook]

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, you know I always love you, I never meant to hurt you
Even the stress'll work you, I miss your old perfume
Promise never curse you, I want you in my circle
Honey right by my side where I keep my herbals
We both agree on no more fighting, we'll just have a verbal
The man'll treat you like a queen, I will bird you
Mother and father birthed you, if I have to hit you
Then damn, I might as well leave, cuz I don't deserve you
Watch from you face, when you sleep, let the heat disturb you
Fiendin' from the magic wand, when she 'nique and serve you
Take me please, take me with ease
Take me back, God damn, and scrape marks on my knees
'Member the first time you made my key
You was drunk, you went behind a tree and pee'd
I miss shit like that, and all of the times
We played cops, I'll arrest you in bed
Police brutality, I'll leave the side of your ass red
God damn it, is sex for real girl? Girl, we in special ed
Uh-huh... fuck that, take me back, pretty please, with you on top

[Hook]

[Outro: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, yo this goes for everybody all across the world
Whether you got fired or your lover dropped you and all that
Youknowhatimsayin? Everybody wanna get tooken back
Youknowhatimean? Don't be afraid to ask, if you wanna see--
Yo, take me back, fuck it, everybody wanna get tooken back and shit
This is your man, Big Ghost, your host, signing off and shit

Yeah first of all don't make me burst and brawl
Image is nothing you fronting see the thirst in y'all
Think it's fucked up now, it get worst for y'all
Assassinate your best friend now a hearse you call
Run up on your block with dough and I curse you all
The fuck out, want to wet duke? Squirt your four
Since birth I been raw hot like surface core
Kidnap your baby's mom straight earth the whore
See I do rhyme and crime so I can purchase more
If you ain't in it for that what the purpose for
Act like you don't give a fuck though
Good so I buck fo' shots from the roof
And my man Rock catch you up close
Never give a fuck about niggas y’all not Nutso
Hype off of carbonated water and some fructose
Straight buck foes when the nigga Ruck pull the snub nose
Wait Ruck chill, what the deal it's all love though
Look into my eyes and you can tell there's something changed
Running gunning things knocking niggas out like Clubber Lang
The gun I bring is straight for fucking beating you down
Heating you down leaving you six feet deep in the ground

It's some real motherfuckers gon rock tonight
All your jewels and your cash getting got tonight

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]
I'm the motherfucking ungrateful
My heart is hateful, my tongue ripped
Licking on the blade that slayed you
You faggots act as bitch as RuPaul
You niggas share one milkshake with two straws
You're trapped with no doors, four walls tighten
Seeing the roof fall, feeling the floors heighten
Crushed in shit, your bones and blood siphoned
And put into a jug we sip before fighting
I'm raw lightning; my power extends
In the planet and out through the opposite ends
Black man travel through the universe and back
While cavemen still though that the earth was flat
But we kept the sacred plans, now we carry
Throughout the ancient lands
Before the separating of the sands
When God saw the power I create in my hand
He banned my gene strain from replicating in man

I'm tasteless; there's beauty in strange places
I find beauty in razors
I find beauty in blood dripping from ya faces
I find beauty in the Qur'an and all of its Aramaic equations
I find beauty in twelve gauges
I find beauty in teaching you what the definition of pain is
I find beauty in stainless
Steel that can kill and reveal the front of your grill
You're brainless
Y’all don't wanna test Vinnie Paz patience
I crack jaws and swing swords of the ancients
Y’all pretended to overstand the matrix
Without attempting to overstand its basics
We dedicated to cats that's been thugging
Vinnie Paz got more hoes then Jim Duggan
Y’all been ducking for quite some time now
Vinnie 'bout to teach you how to write some rhymes now
We aim beams in between your eyebrows

Black Zombie,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Uhh, yo, you believe when they say we ain't shit, we can't grow?
All we are is dope dealers, and gangstas and hoes?
And you believe when they be telling you lie, all on the media?
They make the world look crazy to keep you inside?
Why you listen when the teachers at school
Know you a young single parent out struggling, they think you a fool
Give your kids bad grades and put 'em in dumber classes
Killing shorty future, I wonder how do we last it?
Underground in they casket, ancestors turning
I'm learning something every day, there is no Lazarus
Words like God is Greek or Latin
So if you study Egypt, you'll see the truth written by the masters
My niggas is chilling, getting high, relaxing
Envisioning ownership, yo it can happen
What do we own? Not enough land, not enough homes
Not enough banks, to give my brother a loan
What do we own? The skin on our backs, we rent and we ask
For reparations, then they hit us with tax
And insurance if we live to be old, what about now?
So stop being controlled, we black zombies
[Chorus]
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)

[Verse 2]
Ayo, we trapped in our own brain, fucked behind bars
We've already gone insane
We've already gave up, cut our own heads offs
Stab our own backs and dream too much
Without fulfilling reality; too greedy and
Can't have one or two chains, we need three of them
Can't have one or two guns without squeezing 'em
On our own people and, fuck black leaders
'Cause whites ain't got none leading them, the rhythm is cosmic
Nas is divinity, the deity's prophet
Let's all get down and get up
Victims walking 'round with Down's Syndrome, all stuck
Fainting, shouting, catching Holy Ghost in church
Scared to do it for ourselves 'less we see somebody doing it first
We begged, we prayed, petitioned and demonstrated
Just to make another generation - black zombies

[Chorus]
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)
[Verse 3]
You scared to be yourself, 'cause you in a trance
Feel free, hear the music and dance
If you cared what they think, why wear what they wear, just for you
Dumb niggas with long beards like they Arabs or Jews
Or from Israel, Bismillah al rahman al rahim
Islam's a beautiful thing
And Christian and Rastafari, helps us to bring
Peace against the darkness, which is ungodly
So what's the black man's true religion, who should we follow?
Use your own intuition, you are tomorrow
{*roaring*} .. That's the sound of the beast
I'm a Columbia record slave, so get paid
Control your own destiny, you are a genius
Don't let it happen to you like it did to me, I was a black zombie

[Chorus]
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)

[Outro:]
Wake up! Black zombies in a spell for more than fo'-hundred years
Ghetto niggas won't have it no mo', can I get a witness?
Why listen to somebody else tell you how to do it
When you can do it yourself; it's all in you, do it, do it
Do it niggas.. c'mon, uhh, peace..."
Dead and Gone,T.I.,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: T.I.]
Ayy, let me kick it to you right quick, man
Not on some gangsta shit, man, on some real shit
Anybody done been through the same thing
I'm sure you feel the same way
Big Phil, this for you, pimpin'

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]
Oh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And oh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ever had one of them days wish you woulda stayed home
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on?
You walk by, they get wrong
You reply, then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one, then rush him
Figure you get jumped, hell, that's nothin'
They don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin' you
To the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you hit four times, bullet hit yo' spine
Paralyzed waist-down, now you're wheelchair-bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think, it all started, you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday, all over bullshit
Dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be ‘cause of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when
Their back against the wall, so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow, I guess
From Bankhead up to yo projects
[Pre-Chorus: T.I.]
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make
Mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets, I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]
Oh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)

Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragic situation
Coulda been dead lookin' back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments, hangin', smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit, next thing you know, we cappin'
Get locked up, then didn't even get mad
Now think about, damn, what a life I had!
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit, still look back, get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his jaw, cost me more
I'da took that ass-whoopin' now for sure
Now, think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripes
A nigga put his hands on me, alright
Otherwise, stand there, talk shit all night
'Cause I hit you, and you sue me
I shoot you, get locked up, who? Me?

No more stress, now I'm straight

I turn my head to the East
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the West
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the North
Swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone
But the new me will be alright
I turn my head to the East
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the West
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the North
Swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone
But the new me will be alright 'cause

Forced to use the fo-fifth, leavin 'em layin' in Ol 8 English piss
Got me all stressin' and sick, pickin' up bodies 'n draggin 'em, body baggin 'em
Try'na get it all done before the wagon come stashin' them
Aye put Scarface on the T.V, put the volume up to ten and a half
That way when the police come, Al Pacino bustin' caps
I got away with a killin', it was self defence
Had to rinse niggas off the hallway walls, send my hate out to all they dogs
Yellin' like a psycho when I pulled it
It was cuttin' every bullet plenty of full clips
Fuck em, feed em tef' tips
Got a tool kit, filled of kill em up shit
I be puttin' niggas on the ground wid it, fuck niggas who ain't down wid it
They can hit the back door, see I'mma handle this
I'm so scandalous, like a preacher to teach ya of this crip shit
If I gotta trip, I'ma heat ya and eat ya
I swear I'm serious, herious, feriously hittin' chest plates
I hit them niggas up quick and have it all cleaned up by the next day

See I was shootin' through the hallway
Try'na hit everything in sight

Gotta hit that one right, when I hit that one left

Night after night, I had another thought of destruction
Until this evening, couldn't believe it ran up in my home with the heat, buckin
My baby's watchin' it, front row seated, with the chrome to the neck momma
No pain right now, but later on down the line with the head drama
Didn't expect this to happen to me but this evening was heated
When I walked outta the bedroom, witnessed 'em flash by deep and all black eye ...[?]
I mean five or six of 'em, strapped, with the nine-milla to my face
I bent the hallway, backed up, and ran to the closet for the 12 gauge
What could I do right now beside let it all surface
Then come fuck up your shit on purpose, I got your whole system nervous
But you lied to me compulsive, hit me the hardest like explosives
Into your underground Black Market recordin' shit, get focused
This Siccmade, can't nothin' possibly take that away
But if you make me mad, I get that rage
Inflict pain, then make arrangements
Labelled the most wanted, the most dangerous
Wake up out of a dead sleep, walkin' to the murder
Then flamed the rush

See now it's two weeks later, I had to cut like a cheese grater
Did in all black like a Raider and hit niggas up like a pager, red beam laser
My trust got all fucked up so now I'm watchin' the lights behind me
Tuckin' the metal stuff, try'na get that shit behind me
Testin' my ghetto luck, in the streets Zigg Zagg, my crimey
We lookin' for that prime meat we lookin' for that man
That plotted the crime to try to tie my life span
Splatter my pipe dream, leave you stiff like a mic stand
Yeah I'm the Burbank titan, whether you likin' it or not
Grew up right out of 24th street, yeah some call it the blocc
And when they first hit the locks, see I was shot
All I saw was chrome and niggas in black ski masks, comin' in my home
They try'na take my money, they try'na get paid, so I don't blame 'em
But I wish I had the chopper to put the flame to 'em
But I didn't, just a hand pistol, same doin', bone gristle
Came to 'em, dumpin at shadows, and I was havin' shoot-out battles

Put you niggas in tortillas cause I grind my beef
And I poke her face just like I'm playing poker
Chilling like a villain painting faces like the Joker

Now picture this just a rapper tryna' get it in
If he 'ain't got a pen 'n pad, he's got it in his head
You catch him doodling at night, because this music is my life
And through this mic I shed the light until my studio is bright
But still life is dim
'Cuz I'm still living bent
And my skills with the pen 'ain't paying bills or the rent
But that number one spot
I'm coming, I promise not to stop
'Cuz I can't sit and watch while the wrong nigga got the spot
I remember everything, broke, living poor
Lock myself in my room and write until my wrist is sore
Always bickering with the LORD like what the fuck am I living for?
'Cuz the genie couldn't give me what the fuck I'm wishing for
Like cleaning up the hood and getting my family out today
I could really you use a wish, I need some candles on that cake
'Ain't got shit to smile about, so get them cameras out my face
Fuck with an MC, and them Hammers come out to play
Coming in the game 19, like Biggie did
'Tryna be Diddy Big in the lab, no guinea pig
All these other niggas on that swag and pretty shit
Now rap 'ain't working, but I'm rap's main circuit
I put in my work, man I should be balling in this game
Drop bombs on every song, Pearl Harboring everything
I made that wish with all my heart, and it never came

I got plenty money, and all you niggas know it
[Hook]
What's in my pocket dawg? Big face hundreds
Just left the mall, bought everythang that I wanted
I kinda mad with you haters, I'm real disappointed
Cause what you didn't tell the people is I got plenty money (Okay)
I got plenty money, I got plenty money (Okay)
I got plenty money, I got plenty money (Okay)
I got plenty money, I got plenty money (Okay)
I got plenty money, I got plenty money (Okay)

[Verse 2]
Next month, guess what? I'm buyin' rappers
I'm startin' to feel sorry for you lil' bastards
I'm pretty hot, yo' career a disaster
I control you niggas, somethin' like yo' master
Sixty-five grand, that's 'round the bezel
Stay from 'round me if you don't like to smell cheddar
I ain't fuckin' with that ho cause she a dick hiker
Wanna know who I'm fuckin'? My money, I just married her
She been good to me, I might five-karat her
Ran me out the sto', I bought too many plasmas
Count so much money, breathe like I got asthma
The old sayin is ""the mo' money, the merrier""

[Verse 3]
I don't know why I bought the Bentley when I had the Maserati
What I paid for the goon chain? 140
Scared to keep money on me cause I will blow it
My strip club name is ""Mr. Will Throw It""
Keep fire on deck and I will show it
Fuck with me and get whacked and all you niggas know it
Scared to dance in the club cause my fire loaded
If you won't use it, guess what? Then don't tote it
Mo' money to most niggas mean mo' hoeish
Mo' money to me, it mean keep goin'
Haters gettin' tired, my money still growin'

Yeah
For all my real ATL niggas, that’s right
This the dope boy anthem
Come on

Money, hoes, cars and clothes
That's how all my niggas roll
Blowing dro, 24's
That's how all my niggas roll
Money, hoes, cars and clothes

[Verse 1]
I'm in a drop-top Chevy with the roof wide open
My partners looking at me to see if my eyes open
Cause I've been dranking and I've been smoking
And flying down 285 but I'm focused
454 SS, I race Porsches
White leather seats, as fresh as Air Forces
I say, I'm doing 'bout a hundred but the track still bumping
Number 8 on N.W.A, ""Straight Outta Compton""
Pull up at your apartment sitting on 20 somethings
And the dope boys hollering ""What's happening?"" the kid running in
The cliques start dancing and the broads start choosing
And the cars been parked but the rims keep moving
Sign pictures, buy an onion of good and throw the deuces
I ain't Hollywood, I come from the hood, I'm used to it
So if your rear view shaking and your seats vibrating
24 inch Dayton's got the Chevrolet skatin' makin'
[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I make a million and I'm satisfied, I'll get the rest
Underaged civilian in the tightest ride, I want the best
I refuse to get a 9 to 5, Imma flip my keys
Been paying my dues since '89, tryna get my cheese
Diamonds gleam when I'm on the scene, they know it's me
Ain't no dream or no fantasy bitch, it's T-I-P
Broad busting, like a baby do a binky
Five karat VVS's on my mothafuckin' pinky
Half of Hennessy and Belvedere's what we drinking
Pimp squad send for broads, what the hell you niggas thinking?
Young nigga spending weekends on the islands in the fall
24 inch rim shining when I'm riding cause I'm balling
I'm calling out shots like a pool shark
My tool sparks in the dark when I fool marks
Y'all fools hearts in the wrong place at the wrong time, I got a strong mind
To grab my chrome nine and shoot at your ass for a long time
But I'mma get that ass hauled off, fuck around with the clique
They'll be looking for your dick with a stick, nigga y'all soft
So y'all lost, I'mma ball out at all costs, spit game to a dame
Make her ride on this thang 'til she falls off and sucks balls off, I got the

[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
I'm not boucing little shorty, I'm relaxing right now
I'd probably still be trapping if I wasn't rapping right now
Bragging about pistols at the house, well who's strapped right now
Keep on talking folk, I'll lay you on your back right now
Want to act right now, get smacked right now
I'm a buck mothafucka, I don't know how to back down
Clown down here fakin', frontin', talking ‘bout what you making: nothin’
I'm 21 and 10 years deep, that shit to me ain't nothing
I'm raised by the niggas getting head from the jays
Lose your leg when I spray, end up dead from the K
Stay ready for the raid, paid heavy from the yay'
I told my class: kiss my ass, I make 11 everyday

Summer Wit Miami,Jim Jones,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Jim Jones & (Trey Songz)]
You see rap music is subliminal
But the music for us is like our own diary
Something like a confession
They tell me life is a bitch (That's a summer with Miami)
She somethin' like the seasons just like mother nature
She comes and go as she please
Thats why they get their period once a month (Yeah)
I say that to say this if you think that bitch
The summer is yours (That's a summer with Miami)
She could be cheating on you
Ya heard

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
It's got me feelin' like opium
I'm tryna dance with the loaded M
Open a bottle and it goes around
I'm leavin' drunk 'bout 4 A.M
And watch me jump up in a Dolce Benz
Top down with the pokey rims
And now I'm swervin' so you know I'm bent
I lost count, who knows what I spent
I recall nine Cliques
Bitches steppin' on my Nike sneakers
With one hand in the sky and the other hand was on her thigh
I was grindin' to the beat with my hammer on my side
Now the G's only as we speed to the Rolex
And three or four G's is what we sneeze at the Rolex
Playing some, glance at my Chopard, it's 'bout 6 A.M
You think the night is over but it just begin
They say Club Space like Bad Boys 2
You can see the snow bunnies doin' what bad girls do
Thats ecstasy weed that had girl to
Scoop the bitch that had keys that sellin' fast off blue
Now I'm speedin' to the telly got the Porsche behind
Tryna get in her belly the only thought on my mind
Like damn, not tryna be pushy or nothing
But since the strip joint girl, I should have been fucking
[Hook: Trey Songz]
Spendin' my summers with the drop top low
Throwin' my 100s at the top notch hoes
And we smokin' on the top notch dro
That's a summer with Miami
Bottle in the air, livin' without a care
Shawty beside me, blowin' through her hair
Hold on, no
That's a summer with Miami

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
I can't keep it long anymore
I be with my girl when it starts to snow, I get bored
And when you love three women, it's hard to keepin' up with the lies
You see spring's my first love, I started creepin' with July
Used to say I had some shows, catch a plane to M-I
Then I started trickin' dough and bought a Range for July
Mama said I'm love sick over this hot ass hoochie
And I first seen her when I told Nas I'd slap off his kufi
We don't play disrespect but that was the day that me met
Summer jam '02, I hit the stage with my set
But her man, he was from Brooklyn she still slipped me the number
She said he's on vacation, so get with me this summer
Then I been flirtin' with her over the past two years
Now she hates seein' me in the winter, ain't gon' last through the year
So now I'm lookin' at winter like life's an adventure
And then when June comes, I'll be gone 'til September
Now would you hate me for that?
I know your heart's cold could you wait 'til I'm back
I'm just a sucker for love
But a nigga hold you down if you wanna fuck with a thug
[Hook: Trey Songz]
Spendin' my summers with the drop top low
Throwin' my 100s at the top notch hoes
And we smokin' on the top notch dro
That's a summer with Miami
Bottle in the air, livin' without a care
Shawty beside me, blowin' through her hair
Hold on, no
That's a summer with Miami"
Payback,Immortal Technique,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Diabolic]
These fuckin' snakes, man
Fuckin' up our lives
I'll take a piss in your oil fields
I want some motherfuckin' payback so, yo

[Verse 1: Diabolic]
I wanna run for president, and the focal point when I'm campaignin'
Is to put FEMA to work on a plantation at Camp David
Demand payment for New Orleans with the best of swordsmen
Launching missiles at the White House while Tech's performin'
On the lawn and I just let 'em burn till death's confirmed
Laid to rest with worms cause otherwise they'll never learn
I'll form a coup attempt, put anthrax through the vents
From out a package I got in the mail that you just sent
But I got a better punishment for these Republicans
I'd let 'em live so they can see us overthrow the government
Let's fuck with them, have the first lady beat me off
Till my semen's launched, then I skeet across her face like Peter North
And I won't leave a doubt what we about when I cream her mouth
Or leave her trout bleeding out on Condoleezza's couch
I'll seek this route without regrets, and drink a brew then think of you
Cause if it's the last fuckin' thing I do I'll...
[Bridge: Ras Kass]
Yeah, Immortal Technique, Rassy
Nigga, I never forget nothing nigga

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
Fifty-one percent of the World Bank is owned by the U.S. treasury
Robbing third world countries out all they resources and equity
When Afghanistan was fighting the Russians
Reagan and Bush gave Bin Laden weapons and told him get to bussin
We even called 'em freedom fighters
Financed the cost with CIA imported cocaine
That whole Iran Contra Scandal, niggas took the blame
Started a war on drugs
Meanwhile Russia's defeated, America thinks more oil for us
Take over, set up a puppet government, Arabs ain't bearing it
So the same freedom fighters, George W. call 'em terrorists
Poetic justice, payback's a bitch, these fuckin hypocrites
Like Bill O'Reilly, right-wingers deserve what they get
Rush Limbaugh, drug addict, Giuliani, sex scandal
I wanna thank white supremacists then show you how my tech's handled
My neck's nano-technologically designed
It spits SARS to all you stupid ass execs that capital resigned
I am vindictive, faggots

[Bridge: Immortal Technique]
Yeah, I got something for you motherfuckers haha
You want it, here you go
[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]
The first payback that I would accomplish
I'd draft children from the Senate and Congress
Pompous religious right made suicidal
When I exposed Josephus for ghost writin' the Bible
Making nuclear silos, bomb the world with hydro
Chinese dragon sized blunts in Maracaibo
Huh, and everyone flashing a gun on a DVD
I'd make them niggas shoot it out with NYPD
And every fucker that didn't buy my CD
I'd stab the revolution in their neck with an IV
See me, own the world, I'd give it back to the poor
I'd give a last name to every single son of a whore
Hard to the core, fuck what the game is
Niggas pop on they block but they globally nameless
I'd show the hood real gangsters and make 'em famous
Langley Virginia, where my connect for cocaine is
I'd make everybody fuckin have the world darkening
I make rap about lyrics, not beats and marketing
Replace every raped virgin's broken hymen
Holding De Beers reclining, while they choke on they diamonds
My designing's like Francis Ford Coppola rhyming
Building a universe inside solitary confinement
I'd reverse Rockefeller laws and bring Mumia home
And serve the President freestyling offa the dome
[Outro: Immortal Technique]
A message to the outgoing president
I got a great idea nigga, kill yourself
You know it's so funny, I thought about it the other day
You should probably kill yourself
Why don't you kill yourself?
Ahahahahahahaaa!"
Best Is Yet To Come,XV,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: Colin Munroe]
I been here long before
I’ll be here long after you’re bored
Goodbye, I’m moving on
Goodbye, the best is yet to come
Goodbye-goodbye-goodbye-goodbye-goodbye
The best is yet to come
Goodbye-goodbye-goodbye-goodbye-goodbye
The best is yet to come

[Verse 1: XV]
Look here, who appear
Me oh my, well-well
Story of the Kansas boy
Everybody tell tales
I’m so vocal, could have worked at T-Mobile
Cause I got so many bars
I could probably sell cells
My city follow me cause I will never fail whale
Word is bond man
I could probably bail jails
I am back in black, Hells Bells
Team full of winners, nigga we can’t even spell L’s
I came to entertain and I am doing damn well
Y’all phoning in
Alexander Graham Bell
Hang it up like twelve nails
Ff you can’t tell
This is that wrapping up orchestra music, farewell
[Hook]

[Verse 2: XV]
I know it all comes to an end
That’s something I can’t deny
So I ain’t even gonna try to lie
But I can put on in the end and the outcome’s a lion
So I just live my life like the outcome is dying
And it is but I can’t count my days like a Mayan
And my home is like my own little island
Try to go outside and search to find my own little Zion
But I don’t really like what I am finding
To make sense of why I’m still trying
I guess it’s called grinding
Hunting for the stars
You can call me Orion
Well I ain’t trying to sell what everybody else is buying
I just find comfort in the fact that I’m arriving
To the conclusion of who wins when you went through every hoop
They threw at you like you hula-hooping and this is all I wanted
Go to Kansas and tell them I have done it, I love it because

[Hook]

[Verse 3: XV]
How is he who he is
All I know is these is trying times
And dying rhymes bring the life like de-fibs
Holy moley gee whiz, school of hard knocks
I’m sitting where the Dean is
You wonder my feet is
I came to exercise the game like a Wii Fit
Tell everybody wave till the whole stage is seasick
We are the champions
Now tell me where my queen is
Life versus living but I visit where my dreams is

She wanna turn me on, breakfast in the morn
And she said, ""Daddy, let me take ya home, papi, let me take ya home""
And I said, ""Mami, you can take me home if you let the whole crew get on"" (Bitch)

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
I got this chick from Cali, profilin', she's wild and
She's gangsta, she knows that she's got it like that
We was drivin' on Crenshaw and cruisin' for food when
She pulled up beside me sat off in a 'Lac
And I said ""Damn, girl, you actin' like you don't know, never seen me before?
Episode of Cribs on MTV, video, what you think TS stand for?""
She said ""Terrific Sex"", yeah that's who and the diamonds is no facade
Used to be a broke nigga from the BX, now I'm rich, got the world screamin' Terror Squad

Seems like every other night I got a different chick beggin' me (Let me take you)

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]
I was up in the club, right? Had some Remy in my cup, right? And that's when I peeped him
He was lookin' so fresh and so cleaned up, from his fitted down to his sneakers
I really do mean this, I ain't never seen this, there was some people standin' in between us
Had to go over there so I could meet him, I had him, pimped up in the cut near the speakers
If he got a girl I know she's heated 'cause right now I'm all he needin'
If he crush me, then trust me, it's a guarantee that he's not leavin'
Told me that he heard of me but don't know me and I liked him for some reason
Invited him to my place, sat on his face and I ain't got a man so it ain't cheatin'
Think about it now, I don't gotta stress, I don't never really gotta press, they always say yes
It seems like every other night I got a different nigga beggin' me (Let me take you)

You's a big girl, eat it up
Now tell ya friend to hold your hair while you eatin' up
A little hot, little drunk, little weeded up
We in the truck and freakin' off while the speakers bump
I'm steady speedin' up, swervin' the bumps
I'm tryna fuck, but I ain't tryna fuck the 23s up
So I ease up, drunk and focused
Tryna watch the road but, yo, the back seats heatin' up
And so I'm keepin' them, wish you could see them
I know you hear them breathin' like you been possessed by a demon
I know you heated
Wish you was here but, gotta go now, have a good evening
Hang up the phone now, have a good weekend
Shorty just cold jumped over the front seat and
I think she's about to go down for sheez and
I know the horn ain't beep for no reason
Three in the morning and actin' indecent
She so horny, damn, this shit seems like
Every other night I got a group of chicks beggin' me (Let me take you)

One Call Away,Chingy,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: J-Weav]
Yeah yeah, DTP, how we do, call you, you can call me
Whatever you want to do baby, come on

[Chorus: J-Weav & Chingy]
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my lady)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one love away (and you was my lady)

[Verse 1: Chingy]
It was weird how we met, huh?
She was with her mom at Bank America
With my son cashin' a check
So I asked out of respect, uh
Would she like to explore the world of I, we can fly in my jet
Her reply was yes (Can I ask you something?)
I seen it in her eye, mama looking like all I wanted was sex
Then moved to the next (That ain't true)
But it was something about this girl's style that make me feel no regrets
We started off casual, walks through the park (Park)
Candle light dinners by dark (Dark), I'm thinking smart (Smart)
Afraid she might think I'm in a rush to touch, crush and be up
But baby I ain't on that stuff
Dropped her off and told her call me up (brrring)
We could talk, conversate about political subjects, whatever thoughts
So I zoomed off
Thinking 'bout her, my phone rang
It was her in the shower (What she say?)
She said I couldn't do without you
Then I say
[Chorus: J-Weav & Chingy]
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me

[Verse 2: Chingy]
Yo, yo
The next day I'm with the fellas at the cage playin ball
Here she come with her friends they posted up on the wall
Now I'm showin out, tryna dunk, tryna dribble
Break fast through the middle just to see her smile and giggle
Game over, I approached her with a kiss on the cheek
The homeboys looking at me saying, Lil' Howard you weak'
But you know how that go
What I got they want, what I got I flaunt
Ever mess wit' it? Please don't
Told her I'm goin' home, she asked can she go too
I'm like, ""Yeah boo, I can't see me without you""
Got there, I took a shower, jumped out she in the bed
With a see-through thong set, I looked at her and said
[Chorus: J-Weav & Chingy]
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you wanna roll, just)
I'm only one call away (and you was my lady)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one love away (and you was my lady)

[Verse 3: Chingy]
Girl recognize game before game recognize you
You dealin with a playa, true, now what you wanna do
We can kick it and go puff on a blunt
Oh you don't smoke? Grab a pint of henn and we can get drunk
Its up to you, I'm the man but baby just let me know
Cause if you got a attitude then I could treat you just like a ho
If ya rollin with me baby hop in its enough room
We can gaze at the stars and shine like the moon
Give me a chance to show ya and a chance to know ya
Just be true and theres nothing I won't do for ya
Some women like to play it foul
But them the kind I put in a place of a child
Don't worry be happy and smile
[Chorus: J-Weav & Chingy]
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)

Bitch Look at Me Now,Childish Gambino,"['alternative', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
I do not talk, I am just a rapper
Sick boi make moves like a chess piece
And that move real quick like Nestle
Let me make it clear for a second like Pepsi
I was never worried 'bout my wallet being empty
Cause when it was empty, I was still happy
Walkin' with my Walkman, freestyle rappin'
High school bullies like what the fuck happened
Nigga off the hook like I fuckin' shot the captain
And this is me relaxing, rappin' is my hobby
I did this in my bedroom where I separate my laundry
Watchin' old episodes of Shining Time Station
You are now listening to my mouth on vacation (ation)
Why you doing this, what's your motivation?
I am just a rapper, I don't need the paper
No Will Smith, went off without a hitch, man
C-H-I-L-D is the ISH man
Do sixteen bars no wristband
I'll always be childish, call me Maggie Simpson
Run the track like my tongue's an Olympian
I've always been this good, you just weren't listenin'
[Verse 2]
I'ma try to make my street cred stack up
I mean I'm rapping over Grizzly Bear, what the fuck?
Gather swagger up, before I take it all
You started rapping when you wasn't good at basketball
I started rapping cause I fucking need some Adderall
I can't do one thing, I'm just too good
I can't do one thing, I am Tiger Woods
I make your iPod hotter than a lighter would
Picture me in sixth grade, overweight, overbite
Got my fake Adidas on, whiting out the fourth stripe
Kid named Vincent got it out for me, I hate that guy
Frodo from Chicago, really small and shy
You better recognize, cause I know better now
Cause I was always sick, my life's a hospital
And that's some funny shit, that turd is Apatow
That female dog is blind, well bitch look at me now!
I'm wearing tight jeans and nobody's laughing
More pussy than recycled sanitary napkins
Bitch sitting shotgun in my Tracy Chapman
I did exactly what you niggas said would never happen
I'm doing me so big I can hardly walk
These rappers need ER like they're Charlie Park
Stay hard like my suit made by Tony Stark
This kind of music make your balls drop, Dick Clark
Yes I'm grown and sexy and I'm worth the wait
Girls act like I'm the only dude on earth to date
Put these words on your head and let them percolate
We need to separate, nigga church and state
I used to have to pay for gas in my mama's Saturn
And now I'm paying for a mortgage as a working actor
If living my life is what you say you're chasing after
Nigga stop talking shit and just be a rapper (Be a rapper)"
I Went From,Brotha Lynch Hung,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Been a hard road
Still walking this walk you know
From over there to over here (still smokin')
And its nuthin'..

[Verse 1]
I went from selling dope to selling weed and CD's
And doing little dirt for my BG's for green leaves
I went from knee-deep, from stateline to stateline
I had to make mine so I wouldn't have to take mine
I went from playtime to robbin in the nighttime
I went from daytime to mobbin on the bayline
To Alcatraz it was taking chunks outta my ass still I
I went from empty to a full tank of gass
I went from filty to clean when my momma passed
I changed and went from doing good things to drama fast it's strange
I went from pain to gain I went from game to game
I went from grain to grain, and went from the past
To the present I went from artist to the president
CEO Siccmade musicc is my residence
I went from broke to fiendin' for dead presidents
I went from no hope to king its all evident
So everybody rise with me
Realise with me
You don't know whats on my mind
Shots out to Sicx when I spit this rhyme
Sloppy off the X when I writ this rhyme
I'm all up in the cut when I hit this dime
Tomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time
(Tomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time)

[Verse 2]
I went from hospitals to funerals to graveyards
From Hell's Kitchen like Mel Gibson in Braveheart
I went from they yard to my yard
I went from having light scars to bulletwounds tight cars and silverspoons
I went from the southside to the north to the eastside
I let the meat fry, stress from eating pork
I went from me ride to I ride
I went from livin it up to writing notes that talk suicide do or die
It's been a hard road I went from slamming cardoors to 6-4's to 2004's
I went from blued out in clothes to never booed out at shows
Who doubt the foe led toast
I went from homies to enemies I went from gold weed to indonese
I couldn't stop needing
I went through every season I went through to every reason for nothing
Plenty reasons to be touching the remedies
So everybody rise with me
Realise with me

I went from next to nothing to pressing button and black keys
From 15 to 23 walking the streets
From OE to no weed I'm paranoid
They all tell me they love me, it's all null and void
I play with toys, you know, shots to big Zo
I went from 40 to 0 just to get hydro
I went from him to him thats how the story goes
Tearing from limb to limb touching the 44's
I went from Sac to Chicago just to promote
200 dollars in my pocket looking hella broke
Did the show and made 15 g's
And don't you know I smoked 15 bleezies
I went from I don't got enough its nuthin
I went to damn I got it rough, where's the luck at?
I went from hell and back I went from ballin in black to smelling up the
Back alleys with Maui Wowee, I been telling you that
Everybody rise with me
And realise with me
That you don't know whats on my mind

Catch ya wit yo pants
Catch ya wit yo pants down, and maybe while you sleepin'
Don't matter what you saw, death is what you reepin'

I remain real like my cousin E-Mil
Packin steel
It's the Southside whorida
Can't fuck wit these othasidas
Eastside, Westside
This situation is dirty like chopped up nation
So I stay wit the best side
Nigga let's ride (Fuck that!!)
I stay solo like a black cat
Fuck a bad wrap
I seen it happen to my cousin
I'm like the Dirty Dozen
Wrapped up in buns
""He said he was buzzin""
But you know he wasn't
Cause if life was free I would say fuck money
You can douse me in monkey blood
Fill my pockets wit drug money and duck from me
You was a fuck homie only wanted the plug nigga
Cut yo shit off like smud nigga
I gotta say fuck niggas and buck niggas
And wit a passion and keep smashin'
Get away before the task bend the corner
On a mission for rippin niggas up like toilet tissue
Wit the German issue
Now yo family gone have to miss you
I'm sicker than racism
It's everybody killa
Hit you wit the fully issue
Like PG&E lit you
See me in 3D git you
Hit em up git rid of
Did em up like dirty draws
He was a jealous mothafucka
As the story was told 29 years old
350 Gs in the bank but nobody knows
I guess it's just that season I thank
When niggas be hoes
Fuckin em in the cheap mo mos
Leavin em dead in the bath tub wit no clothes

Since you was talkin that shit
You was hard on the Boulevard
Now I'mma buck this clip
On your self I make you shit
When antagonized if you don't realize
You must be the type that like surprise
I'll rise out the hood on chrome skates
Pull a top notch bitch and fuck her ass hard on the first day
Throwin it at me wit no debate (none)
But I ain't the one to be trustin em
Ain't finna get me for rape
Punk bitch tried to hand me a case
Until I dropped her on her face
Bitch!! Take that shit and skate

These niggas ain't neva fake
Dope dealas and killas
Whateva product could lace
One time I always shake
See I'm hella fast on that ass get away clean

Major figgas my mind is up on
Gold diggas I'll shake em

That real nigga from the fake
Cause real nigga look at a fake nigga
And they always tend to shake
Crossed me at one time
And I told you I'll be buckin at your wake
Cause when I tell yo ass one time it's all it takes
How many rhymes i'mma have tell a cat

So watch yo back cause I'mma be in all black theivin like Gary Payton
Chorus [4Xs]:"
Cold Heart,Dom Dolo,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","I always been the type to put you first
Even if it seemed like you ain't deserve it
& I know that sometimes I made you hurt
But I swear I ain't do it on purpose

The problem was that you would hear me
But respond based on only what you were feeling
Which led to frustration that sparked the
Beginning of... the ending

(just hear me)

I never been the type to give all my love all my love
Last time I found love I lost my trust
In the heart of a battle I always won
(but, but) you know my dumb ass gave all my love
Knowin' that the outcome would probably just
Be the same old shit that it always was

& I fell so hard that I left my guard back where I first met her
Anything that was keepin me safe got lost when I read that letter
Its like I dove from a rock into a deep ass lake & my feet would touch the
The sand at the bottom ice cold
But im warm cause im next to the core that deep in love
Man I never know that lookin at the stars could be so fuckin downing
Whys it so damn hard to move on from your past shit
& everything be all good some breaks up be easy man I think they all should
I said man I think they all should
Im like man I think they all should
Some breaks up be easy man I think they all should
Damn it I just lost love

I will see you someday
I hope maybe one day
We can go back to the way
The way that it used to be"

Yeah, uh, yeah
We finally made it
Celebration in order, happy belated
This what you waitin' for, you know we make it raw
London City, we love you, that's who made it for
In my heart you will remain, hope that this trip makes for picturesque change
And we on a jet plane, platinum dreams gladly go
This that Beatles feel, remember Abbey Road?
Show out with the words, what a antic
And we got the Wi-Fi, Virgin Atlantic
Turbulence can't disrupt my pen
And I swear it's my time, say what up Big Ben
I'ma up this trend and live it up as a teen
To go to the palace to say what up to the Queen
Hit up Westwood, do interviews probably take calls
University of Cambridge, May Ball
Get your tickets ready, it's Chiddy Bang in London
They can never bring me down, I'm always up to somethin'
Contrary to your beliefs I'm still the same dude
Only difference is the pilots' talk and plane food

I'm the raft if ever your bridge is fallin' down
Drive on opposite I take those roads, I play right
I'll prob'ly take her to Shakespeare's Globe
If the world get cold then we numb to the reality
I break life into pieces, let's hit the gallery
My, you're platinum, baby, you're not sterling

Walk This Way,Run,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Rev Run, D.M.C., & Both]
Now there's a backseat lover that's always undercover
And I talk 'til my daddy say
Said, ""You ain't seen nothing 'til you're down on a muffin""
""And there's sure to be a change in ways""
Now, there's a cheerleader that's a real big bleeder
As far as I can reminisce
But the best thing of loving was her sister and her cousin
And it started with a little kiss, like this

[Chorus: Rev Run, D.M.C., & Both]
See-saw swinging with the boys in school
And her feet was flying up in the air
Singing, ""Hey diddle diddle with the kitty in the middle""
And they swinging like it just don't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a lady who was ready to play
It wasn't me she was foolin' 'cause she knew what was she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to
[Chorus: Steven Tyler & Rev Run]
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way (She told me to)
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
Well, just gimme a kiss
Ooh, like this

[Verse 2: Rev Run, D.M.C., & Both]
School girl sleazy with a classy kind of sassy
Little skirt hanging way up her knee
It was three young ladies in the school gym locker
And they found they were looking at D
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
'Til the boys told me something I missed
That my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
And I gave the girl a little kiss, like this

[Chorus: Steven Tyler, Steven Tyler & Run-D.M.C.]
See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing, ""Hey diddle diddle, with your kitty in the middle""
I was swinging like I didn't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin' when she knew what she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to
[Chorus:  Steven Tyler & Rev Run]
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way (She told me to)
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way

It's the muthafucken Lynch and I'm back on a X tracc
'Bout to tell you niggas how to keep a ho stack (what you do?)
What you got to do, ta have your bitch clockin
Just put her on skirt, (then what?) sit her on stock then fish-net stockins
Tight around thick jock, make it look good, to the normal nigga eye
That bitch'll make a killin even if she ain't fine (what?!)
Cuz a big ass and some titties is a gold mine, deuce-nine dollars
A nut, two nuts is 58, an extra 4 if want the ho to masturbate
A blow job is 24 bocks a hit
But it's worth she see the ho swallow the gooey shit
And when I come through she be comin to see daddy
Like a O.G., you know me, I'm sittin in the Caddy, kick back
Look at the ho like ""Wow!""
Bitch your my slave, what should I make her do know?
You can't treat a bitch good, you know (no)
What good is a nigga who ain't slappin his ho
So peep, let 'em all know that you don't play
And every bitch gotta price to pay
That's real, you bitches, fuck hoes mayn
They got all off crack, tryin to make you scratch
That's realer than real, shots to that nigga Nefarious
He put down the original game, nigga just need to bring back some doe
Slow me, uh, productions

[Verse 2: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Who's the ho? A bitch named {silence} was the trick
She gave up the poo-poo for not one cent
She didn't pay, fuck it I kept the ho
Every morning at 6 A.M. she was leavin out my window
The close homie probably hit 'em too
I thought I gave her fuck but she probably fucked the whole crew
I can't lie, I hella liked the bitch
But like X-Raided said: ""Once a bitch, always a bitch""
So why try to change her?
I rather be by myslef, fuck a ho I strangle her
The only woman I respect
Is my muthafucken moma, disrespect I break yo neck
It's hella easy pullin hoes (hella easy pullin)
Half cuz I got game and half cuz I'm in the store
Dumb bitch you, you get's no play (24 street)
You got a price to pay, fa sho

Fuck these all muthafucken

[Verse 3: Brotha Lynch Hung]
That's that bitch givin up the cash
I know a ho, who would straight up jack yo ass
You might go to the mo-mo and get you some

She made you cum then your ass went to sleep (then what hapend?)

Big spider web, yo ass got caught
You went in her that night loc

I can’t be bothered with paying homage to forefathers
See the future like the car show floor models
Both feet in the snow, so that my core follows
We don’t mourn for the dead nigga, we pour bottles
Drown sorrows, ocean blue Murcielagos
Started with similac powder in a baby bottle
The formula is warning ya
Crack kills offerings to the coroner
Kill my eldest brother? Nigga, I’ll be damned
Gator at my momma’s house, welcome to zombie land
A hustler’s paradise, a lucky pair of dice
Down 40 but a streak will have you square by night
Didn't bat an eye I at it, kept the poker face
Cause the batter I add had the coca base
When you get to heaven’s door they won’t hold a space
If you numb like the flesh on a smoker’s face
There’s no feeling like your bitch chin chilling right
You in Italian leather and you're four wheeling right
You know you’re up when you count a quarter mil in white
And if you down you can slang it like a pillow fight
I’m a wizard at it, nigga here’s the magic
Make a small town feel like I throw a blizzard at it
Get the green from the scale like a lizard had it
Bear witness as I unveil this instant classic
[Hook]
Yes! My God!

[Verse 2]
The Second Coming is in the second verse
The first coming still here, so I’ll need a hearse
I got a voodoo doll every time I pen a verse
Not only do they say they feel it but say it hurts
No pain, no gain, nigga
They say I’m heating up, welcome to the flame, nigga
No matter the success, still the same nigga
I only change when the new body came, nigga
Aerodynamic, roof panoramic
My credit score let the dealer take full advantage
Paid over sticker price, cash under handed
The 012 a year early, I’m a time bandit
Gotta time manage when you heaving snow
Able to drop it all at 30 and be free to go
Only deal with divas on a need to know
And what you need to know is when you need to go
They’ll be no waiting, I have no patience
This is the end for all my unrecognized greatness
I’m here now, nigga, pardon my lateness
You can hear in every bar and every cadence
It’s the new god flow, ain’t it
The last supper for you niggas now repainted
Take position on the chess board and rearrange it
Face to face with the truth, get reacquainted

Open Your Eyes,Immortal Technique,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","We're here because of you
We're here because you were there

We've arrived from every corner of the planet to this nation to seek the fulfillment of a promise of America. We were promised a better life in our home countries, where we were told that privatizing water and electricity will make things run more efficiently. Instead the quality remained almost the same and the price was increased until it became an unaffordable luxury. Some corporations are more efficient than government, but their motivation is not the health or the well-being of the people; it's only about profit. Everything else—their image, their human resources, their public relations—only exist to protect the reality behind it. Once upon a time we were told that nationalization would prevent growth by limiting competition, that our countries were nothing without the companies that invested in us, and so they privatized everything. Everything in our country was owned by people that had no connection to our culture, by those who never had our interests at heart. They didn't care about our survival or well-being—they just wanted to turn a profit by raping our land, by exploiting our people, our industry and our resources. They took everything we built and made it theirs, first by creating racism to justify slavery, building the capital for capitalism, and then when they gave us what they call liberty, everything we had was still owned by them. Our governments told us that socialism was the real enemy, and that we would have freedom, but the foreign powers and corporations were the ones with real freedom, the freedom to take all the wealth generated by our work and our land and gave us only a small percentage of the scraps from the table. Their lust for power and their greed drove them to betray not only us but themselves and the word of their own God

(Open your eyes before you die)

And while some used missionaries and donations to off-set this abuse, other countries and companies were blatant with their crimes, using war, disease, and sanctions that killed millions. They supported corrupt governments that were almost like the old slave masters in their oppression of the people, because their loyalty was to those who enabled them, and stored them and kept them in power. They became the bastard children of American industry, kleptocracy, governments of thievery. They protected the corporations and went to war against their own people to preserve those profits. The puppet rulers were given billions of US tax dollars to fund civil wars, right wing death squads, execute political dissidents, sympathetic clergy, and even overthrow democratically elected governments. And so the age of revolution began again. They painted it as godless terrorist versus the free world and the free market. But the free market has never been free, because the market does not regulate itself. It is manipulated like a puppet, and it survives because of its image. Destroy the image, and the enemy will die. Such is the same in the rap industry. But the major label super powers treat the underground like the Third World. When they need new assets, new artists to prostitute a side-ins, and put on a shelf to use their songs; when they needed new concepts, music and publishing to steal from the producers, they came to the underground, to the Third World. They took our culture, our property and our industry and our resources, even using our own people to help them exploit us. But behind the mask of efficiency, they claimed that we need them to succeed. They're no better than us. Their economic advertising was always a lie. A few got rich, but most were given an illusion of wealth, almost as if it was designed for failure. Opportunity comes at the price of the soul in the music, so remember what they are underneath the fancy architecture, glittering rented jewelry, the cars, the IMF loans, the seeds with suicide genes, 20-year contracts, and oil blood money. Build your defenses, my independent brothers and sisters. They’ll stop at nothing to get what they want. They paint the Third World underground as savage and backward. But the super powers are no less corrupt; they've just learned to disguise it better, ‘cause they fix elections too, they embezzle tax money, they go to war for resources, they fund terrorism for their own benefit. And when there's enough at stake, history's taught us that they'll even assassinate their own presidents

(WAKE UP!)

All at the rooms in the Sybaris
From this jacuzzi water, can you cleanse us?
Can you please unfog my Cartier lenses?
God sends signs sometimes only in glimpses
For me I almost died, falling asleep in them Benzes
It’s something about this beat that get me tranquilized
And when I play it at my shows I feel sanctified
And He gives me direction when I can’t decide
He is alive
How can you tell me that He ain't when I said
[Chorus]
(Jesus walks)
God showed me the way, now the devil can't break me down
(Jesus walks with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(I want Jesus)
And now I think there is something that I can say now that'll right my wrongs
(Jesus walks with me)
I finally talked to God, I ain't afraid cause His love is so strong

[Verse 2: Common]
Open your eyes, there's smoke in the skies
The Beast is holdin' a lies
Everywhere we move, motion denied
Emotion derived from posters of pride
Of African, cultures and tribes
Who live when we suppose they die
Laugh when we suppose they cry
The pain we holding inside
Cause all we really know is survive
Use that to remember we're kings
That's why we so addicted to diamonds and rings
And cutless supremes
Seen Diana Ross remember that my sisters is queens
The Lord is coming -- for now, he visit in dreams
For every mission it seems impossible
Speak to the gospel to remind me what God can do
When it's not logical
To those in hospitals and prisons
Low-income living
For them I say a prayer keep giving
Learning to receive
My heart is burnin' to achieve
Even when it's hard to breathe, I still believe that
[Chorus]
(Jesus walks)
God showed me the way, now the devil can't break me down
(Jesus walks with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(I want Jesus)

[Verse 3: Mase]
Before you take my name, take my fame
While you at it take my shame
Take my flaws, take my blame?
Feel my dirt, conceal my hurt
See my bruise, do this and you will walk in my shoes
You wasn't there when I was in deep thought
When I had two choices: kill him, or either leave New York
But I'm a truth teller, that's why I say what I'm saying
And the only thing the radio playing
Is cause you be paying
It ain't about who really hot no more
Beats wit knock no more
So who cares who flop no more?
I realize that most labels pay you for lies
And only law dudes can disguise
That your favorite artist (shhh)
I know you hear that (huh?)
You wanna fear that? (what?)
Your worst dream is that you was gonna hear that
Icon to rap is like John the Baptist
Prepared the way for what I came to say today
They deceived us, having thinking Jesus
Really didn't need us, when He loved the old days
He loved them boys in the hallway up in Broadway
Even those who re up for dope, every four days
To the strippers in broad day up in Norway
To the Detroit player gators in Marbres
With me, it's not just bars of music
I walk with God, I got the scars to prove it
[Chorus]
(Jesus walks)
God show me the way, now the devil can't break me down
(Jesus walks with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now

[Outro: Mase]
Everybody out there
Just lift your hands right now
Just say this with me
Father, I thank you
For forgiving me of everything I've ever done
For Jesus walking with me
For dying for me
Raising for me
And all my sins have been forgiven
I'm a changed man
I'm healed, I'm delivered, I'm rich
And it's all because of Him
Now walk with me
Walk with me, walk, walk, walk with me
Walk with me"

On the corner lookin' out for the one time
And these niggas from the othaside tryin to take mine

Make bullets chase niggas and erase fake niggas

Cross the line of the mastermind mothafucka I wish you would
Got niggas in every hood and ready to go to war

Waistin time thinkin bout mine you should be gettin yours

Punch ya homie in the mouth with a handful of rings

Nobody know I done it, cause I left no trace
I'm a bad motherfucker, Chi-town my home base

Do what I say, lay lay lay, my knuckles on ya jaw
You won't never get a witness sayin' what they saw
I ain't tryin to be no victim, you wanna cross that line
I leave a bitch leakin' blood, like it's period time
Got that old school in me like Tampax
You can't leave home without my CD like Air-Max
I throw them bows left to right
I'm So So Def-a-like, legendary like Like Mike, bitch

Look, if you really wanna get it poppin'
I can act like I ain't got a album droppin'
But, you the type to talk shit quick
Get ya ass whipped
And then go call the cops
Lose ya jewels in the process of gettin' stomped
You file all type of reports sayin' you got robbed
Now that ain't gangsta and you ain't gangsta
Matter fact, your whole motherfuckin' crew is wankstas
I'm tellin' you, you don't really want it with me
I don't know how to act, Remy'll o-d
I be camped out, waitin' at ya J-O-B
With my hair in two braids, face Vaselined
And my squad know the plan before we start thumpin'
Even if I'm winnin' we all gon' jump in
Talkin' wreckless, no hired protection
And I'm still walkin' around them metal detectors

Bombin' up the streets like I'm a terrorizing things

I form barriers with my thick rhymes
When I'm on the mic, all i do is commit crimes
It ain't my fault, it's just a habit
I throw cards like I'm fuckin' Gambit
See me all the time, jumpin' around like a rabbit

And how the saying go, things change
Skinny dude, but the flow is the size of Ving Rhames
Pennies for my thoughts add up, I hope you bring change
I know these haters ain't want me to see my wings raised
Flowin' shoes polishin', rappers I demolish it
I done lost my mind, in need of a psychologist
They could care less back when I was still in colleges
And now the boy be in London, Theophilus
It's tough try and end up on the paid route
The flow is medium rare, now bring the steak out
This is my medium, here, see how it plays out
They all buggin' me, I gotta pull the Raid out
Using it sparingly, forever will they cherish me
Before I black out, introduce my moment of clarity

I'm not the same, style change
But I can't leave the game
Now I'm right back to my old ways
I take life so slow
Every minute gotta go
Now I'm right back to my old ways
We only here for a little
So I'm somewhere in the middle
And I'm right back to my old ways
I'm not the same, style change
But I can't leave the game
Now I'm right back to my old ways
[Verse 2]
Let's take 'em back to days when we had no radio plays
And we had to change up our ways, 'cause success breeds
Difference, try to keep it clean while they litterin'
Snakes in the grass, they try to slither in
The rose that grew from concrete, not witherin'
And this life so fast, the lights keep flickerin'
What goes around comes back, and that's the karma truth
I log onto my closet, that shit is Karmaloop
So I get a little fresh
My teachers used to hate me, but now I could pass the test
Got confidence, subconsciousness
Makes me overlook all of my many accomplishments
But, see I get it like nobody else did
I found a deeper meaning of what sense of self is
And I'ma die of old age
And stay true I reverted back to my old ways

[Chorus]
I'm not the same, style change
But I can't leave the game
Now I'm right back to my old ways
I take life so slow
Every minute gotta go
Now I'm right back to my old ways
We only here for a little
So I'm somewhere in the middle

B.A.R.S. Vs. Da Hustla,Cassidy,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]

[Verse 1: Da Hustla]
You just a performer, I was on the corner grinding the packet
I'm a Ryder, If there's drama I'm palming the ratchet
And you could find me in traffic, I'm in the streets
10 years ago I was moving like 10 a week
You just a family man, tryna settle down
You on parole so you scared to hold the metal now
You moved away from the hood, I'm in the ghetto now
Yea, I grip pipes, I just like how the metal sound
I got the metal now, nigga, I ain't never scared
How the fuck you run Philly and you ain't never there!?
And I ain't never feared nothing but God
You went to jail, came home, and ain't do nothing but hide
But fuck it, I'm a ride, I might start sparking the H
I send rap cats to God like Mase
And like the car accident, I'll put another scar on your face
But when the 5 clap, you ain't gonna survive that
Nigga
[Interlude]

[Verse 2: BARS]
Oh, you ruthless, the record I'm a Hustla was stupid
Cause Jay made more off the record than you did
And Swizz made more off the record than you did
So you did something for nothing you doofus
I'm too sick for, any nigga with 2 lips
And 1 tongue in his mouth, I talk too slick
You only got a few hits and a couple fans
And I could prolly get you bodied for a couple grand
I caught a murder attempts, I had a couple man
But I could knuckle man, and knock you out with a couple hands
Every bar I spit raw like a couple grams
You the Hustla, but I'll show you how to hustle man

[Interlude]

[Verse 3: Da Hustla]
Look, I'm a give this guy an applause
But It's a lotta lies in a lot of his BARS
Cause I'm a hustla, I sold pies of the raw
Plus, the hustla gon' ride if it's war
But you the type of boy that'll hide if it's war
You the type boy that never come outside if it's war
So, you a nut to me, you know you can't fuck with me
And BARS you was locked up on protective custody
You like my son, but I don't want custody
You a mutt to me, I'm a pit, And you a pup to me
You in the street cause you beat the case luckily
But you ain't tough as me, I'll burn you like a dutch of trees, nigga
[Interlude]

[Verse 4: BARS]
You a snitch, you a rat, you'll sing, you'll hold the note
I sold the coke, and smoke weed 'till I'm comatose
I live by the rules, I was schooled by the older folks
I was showed the ropes by the cats that was holding toast
Lord knows even goons get the Holy Ghost
Yea, I believe in Christ, but I'll still squeeze a pipe
And I don't even need to write, or switch the flow
You niggas know I ain't Murder Fluke or Cicero
I'm way sicker yo, so who ever supposed to be nice
Get two choices, the toast or the knife
And if you think you a hustler, then you the one smokin the pipe
Cause you ain't never sold no coke in you life, trust me!
You must be giving money away
If you got 20 strips all doin 20 a day!
Cause you ain't worth shit, you went gold on your first disc
And I'm a Hustla sold less then your first shit, nigga

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
I don’t worry ’bout paper I passed up
I focus on money my hands touch
If that right there don’t add up
I gotta let you know your math sucks
You don’t ever talk to a calculator
You don’t get caught with an ounce of paper
Every convo is about a favour
Had to get a mansion without the neighbours
I ain't meaning no bad chick
When I say they don’t have a dime
And I ain't meaning no Gold watch when I say “I don’t have the time”
My hustle is the reason I’m known to shine
It’s like I’m in my own World
Cause these boys out here pillow talking
And texting all my old girls
You call that your homegirl
I call that my dome girl
I call that my errr
I’m not home leave a message after the tone girl
I go to places they rap about
But girls only love you cause the cash you got
See all these hoes is chasing stars
Growing up to be cashtronauts
Can’t be mad, I asked for it
Living life in that airport
Y’all ain't even get off the ground
Y’all stuck in that chair-port
I know they wanna see my cash short
But only thing I ask Lord
Is please don’t let me run out of nothing but pages in my passport
And I know

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T]
Been through a lot just to get this far
Whip that car, grip that grain
Rev these pipes on the lights
Went from broke, to having things
Catching planes out of state
I got dues to pay, I got moves to make
Folks to feed that depend on me
To keep the lights on, food on their plate
Hit the slab, push it to the max
Expensive taste, I love poppin’ tags
Fucking hoes, I love hittin' the lab
Spittin’ bars that reflect my past
What you know ’bout sold out shows
Promoting country shit everywhere I go
Putting on for the third Coast
'Sippi land, give a damn, what you think of them my folk
If nothing else I gave them hope
If they could follow dreams of their own
Be successful and ride clean with the chrome
If it ain't past leave it alone
Ignore that hate, embrace that love
Most niggas talk down just because
I’m putting my faith in the man above
About my bread, playa be about your’s
Be ’bout chores, stay on course
I make my mark everywhere I go
I spit that trill every time I flow
I get my own, cause it’s all I know
It's all I show so when I toast to the life I live
I’m taking off like a laser beam
Rather not wake up, rather get my cake up
While I’m out here living the dream
This my world!

A different city in the night life
And they be going so insane
I repping for my city right, right
So you should be happy that I came
She say she want to spend the night right
And I don’t even know her name
(Don't even know your name)
Just sit and watch me as I fly high
Yeah, she wanna be my Lois Lane

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
Fresh off the plane, straight to the Rover
I can’t complain, tip for the chauffer
When I hit my room, its over
Floor that I’m on, high as a toca
Funny thing is this girl is sober
But she gon be drunk when she hit the sofa
You stay the night if you acting right
The views that we looking at thats a sight
You really be living that rapper life
It they ain't made it where I’m at than they ain't rapping right
She me and KRIT got dough appetites
You couldn’t see us if with a flashing light
You could die, than come back to life
You still couldn’t see us in the after life
And you know…

And I don't mind when we fall out
As long as we fall back into it
I hope we never put an end to it
Even though you not that into it
Heaven, have you ever been to it?
Cause you look like you never been
You're more of a Hell's Angel
And for you, I'd rather sin
Broken heart, love you with a broken heart
For you I'd jump off Noah's arc
Love is blind and hope is dark
Why does pain feel so good?
Love is science live for you
Die for you, and I'll die smiling

[Verse 2: Bruno Mars]
Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live
Oh, take, take, take it all but you never give
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open, why were they open?
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
Cause what you don't understand is
[Hook: Bruno Mars]
I'd catch a grenade for you, throw my hand on a blade for you
I'd jump in front of a train for you, you know I'd do anything for ya
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby, but you won't do the same
No, no, no, no

Black, black, black and blue, beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said, hey, when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman, that's just what you are, yeah
You'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car

You tossed it in the trash, yes, you did

Hop up on top and start jicky-jicky-jerking
Slow down for me, a-you moving too fast
My fingers keep slipping, I'm tryna grip that ass
Keep being hard-headed and I'ma make you get off me
Got human enough disguise but my face is a doggy
If you loving my bark let me bury my bone

[Vast Aire]
Yo, I ain't superstitious but these niggas is nice

[Verse 1: Alaska]
A lot of cats pop shit, I pop apocalypse
Topple propaganda force fed to the populace
My thoughts run the gamut from outstanding to preposterous
On top of this I move posteriors
From impoverished to posh areas
My process: accomplish through perseverance
Every man's not my brother regardless of appearance
Apprehension clouds the spirit
Tension prepares us for ascension
Man at his best is when he breaks chains or conventions
A convenient covenant coveted for conception
We're all from the same mold: spores and bacteria
Told we're inferior, others ignore hysteria
A claustrophobic neurosis
In this masquerade ball of fake glasses and big noses
Alaska splashes explosive flows
To expose Pinnochio's growing nose
Composed of compost compositions
Those clothes are getting a little close fitting
I'll stomp this shit, add a over confident
Script's compliments of my frozen mic dominance
A passively aggressive testament that's how I'm repping shit
[Verse 2: Vast Aire]
Watch Vast murder the track effortless
Like God's on my side and he answered my Christmas list
After the first couple of bars I start to smell fear
That's when I take them there so they can breathe air
You're so secure with your insecurity
Perfect world of piety I swat flies when they bother me
Some say I touch hearts like Kano
Now every time you see a mic you just say no
Some write with words, I write with metal
That's my soul is rust free, raps stay dusty
In the coldest winters we thought husky
They be like, ""I don't know his name but he aim like Wayne Gretzky""
That's funny, cause I don't play hockey
I play horse on the mic and watch them all copy
Left hooks left them shook like etch-a-sketch
Give me an inch with mine
I'll take a mile if you let me
I'm not a bum, I'm a nomad, off dome
Thoughts have no home, the page is ours to roam
Cats be on some fantasy shit like Cinderella
Well we'll see if the shoe fits after the accapella
Never made sense claiming something you wasn't
What's the penalty for that? He might never come back
And the atomic pressure won't lessen
After you've learned your lesson
Miss the sense in a track? Yeah that's a buck fifty
Like a farmhand cutting a little piggie
If I'm the author I'm also the farmer stupid
I shoot a arrow at you and my name ain't Cupid
[Verse 3: Cryptic One]
Yo I'm honest with this art
With a William Wallace heart and it's brave
And a blade that's well polished and sharp
Intent ain't to reinvent the spinning wheels of time
Just to enjoy the bumpy rides and improve upon its design
I take time, every plate circle's complete, love it
I've learned even tardy birds come to eat from it
Early bird gets the worm but the early worm finds a spot
In early bird's stomach and can't escape from it
Idiot box jocks are live stock
Graze amongst our mind crops
Beast of burden, murdered, their mind squashed
Primate nations leave these regions unexplored
Liberty torch protrudes through sandy floors on beach shores
Tour the atomic wastelands, desolate
Definite situations of complex Oedipus
Mother nature broken, fucked by offspring's reckless negligence
Destructive corrupted residence of earthly bound pessimists
Found willingly bound in the back of yellow cabs confessing it clearly
Fear the anti-Mobius Strip theories
Dennis Leary, Miller, and Menace cynicism visions
With a depressed Beth Gibbons position on life's mission

[Verse 4: Vordul Megalah]
Now listen, how sick is these niggas?
Atoms the illest, cap peelers
And don't tote guns, smoke onions
Crying with no funds no fun trying
To get by but we still do it and rep music
'Til death do us wet your noodle
With raps in the pot hard boil the rap gargoyles
Stoned at night on top of buildings Gothic
Like Bruce in the blue suit let's get it popping
Watch it drop out of the sky in the rotten
Apple, where some get tackled
Hooks that grapple right on your Adam
Got you choking off the rhyme potents
Stay focused while you villains stay joking
We serious on the mic get ignorant
Delivering rap vocals for the new millennium
We're from Harlem marching in atomic garments
Bombing all the nonsense
Yo, you cats ain't ready for this, heavy abyss
Thoughts that travel through the tunnels of crypts
My mic holds one in the clip and fours packed under the dick
Spit rhino acapells gun in your shit
Get rap plug's stuck in your whips fucking with this
Over these El-Pro percussion hits
We love to rip, love to sip, love to rep Jux to Def
Yeah, Atoms"

I got mad styles for days your styles been played
And I every thing you rock today I did yesterday

The lieutenant get all his orders from the Captain

Sent to the army of Brooklyn, those bastards
Fallen soldiers my homies lay in caskets
They couldn't survive the Heat just like the Mavericks
And I don't buy Wolf tickets from niggas
But niggers be wolfin so I walk around with my Clippers
Some of my people was alive for my struggle
But didn't live to see my success
They wanted to see me make it but got stripped naked
And laid in the morgue cause of death
So yo now that I'm successful how could I celebrate it
They died early so in their eyes I never made it
I ain't gonna give you my life you gotta take it

Swept my feet and I didn't even spit on the broom
What I'm tryin to say is I'm not superstitious
Akon what am I? (I'm a Ghetto soldier)
My right hand itchin' been had money kid
I even opened the umbrella in the crib
Bought my girl some shoes she didn't walk out of my life
No bad luck I skipped the Po twice
No superstition just wise intuition
On the battlefield, get killed to do the killin
By the way my good luck charm is a biscuit

And have smoke comin out of your chimney
I can see straight through your plot and your trickery
It don't mean shit to me
I'm tryin to get to the bottom of it
But I lost a whole lot of my energy
Tryin to get to the bottom of a bottomless industry
Nowadays all I got is my pride and my dignity
You ridin with sympathy they say misery needs company
Why keep them company you kiddin me?
When I can grab a weapon and put him out of his misery
Send shots at you to tell you I'm not playing

With you, with you, with you, with you, with you, oh
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Only with you, with you, with you, with you, with you, babe, yeah"
Meat,Brotha Lynch Hung,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Alarm clock, I hate alarm clocks

Hey, babe, I gotta get up
Real shit ya'll

[1st Verse]
I only got enough money for some hamburger meat
But I still ain't tripping that's the shit I like to eat
But my son he like daddy this is all we got to eat
I'm like son I'm about to sign big time
I'm downloading beats and I'mma start writin' to em
And if the fans don't buy em I'mma kill them in they sleep
Bring the extra cheese
We gonna eat somehow like the Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese
Gettin' dirty meats, make me some fuckn' stacks of G's
With the AR, automatic Uzi machine
All you gotta do is wash it off and then put it in the freeze
And then we good for another couple of weeks
When you get older like me you'll be tuckin the heat
And if not you, you'll be stuck in the street
I wanna say ya mom love you, but that's up to she
But we gonna do what we gotta do and that's get the meat
Strange Music got my back fade hopefully
But if not, see there really ain't no hope for me
That means you going through the same situation
That means we gone keep going through the same shit you hatin'
[Hook]
Meat, we gotta find something to eat
Even if we gotta go do it on the street
Even if we gotta go shootin' with the heat
Even if we lie to dude we gone get the meat, (meat,meat)

[2nd Verse]
I only got enough money for top ramen noodles
My son lookin' at me like he don't wanna come to close
He saw me in the bathroom cryin' it was too late
I couldn't even keep a straight face, like 2 face
All the mother fuckas around me they was to fake
I ain't got an album out now they call me too late
Bar b q yesterday, where the fuck was I at?
A football game where's my mother-fuckin' hi at?
I remember lizz moore drive even after that
Starin at my strange chain, thinking I ain't goin' back
I got a new life, I'mma get a new wife
I'mma get a new 9, I think it was due time
No matter who's wrong or who right
Life's like shakin' 'em up n rollin' 2 dice
Thin slice, and my old school homey like where you been ice
Just marinatin, stomach aching shit ain't been right

[Hook]
[Background vocals]
Real shit ya'll.......real shit ya'll......meat
Hey, Kev wake up, fading off, meat [Fades Out:]
Yo Kev wake up

[3rd Verse]
Lil Kevin wake up its school time, get ya clothes on
Don't nobody love you like me
We in the O zone, twilight zone
All we got to eat today is bullshit
Time for you to pray, but I don't pray I carry full clips
You can't be like me cause I'mma fuck up
And if we both fuckn' up you gone be just like me
It's gone be a tight squeeze, we can get through this
You my 'lil nigga so nigga we gone do this
Shit, I can count it on one hand
Old as I am I can still count it on one hand
We both Kevin Mann
We both gotta stretch it out like a rubber band
I got another plan, I got a million of em
I'mma still come with em, I'm still run wit em
We gotta keep it goin, then I'm done with it
That's it, I'mma wipe my hands
I'm hella broke but I don't dance

[Hook]
[Outro:]
“Alright son, what time you get out of school?
What 2:30?
Alright you meet me down the street where we usually meet at
I’m, I’m gonna get some money
You just get your fucking ass into fucking class, man
Alright, I love you”"
Did It and Did It,Brotha Lynch Hung,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","(Lynch):
I feel my nut sacs loadin' up
Get off the freeway at Broadway with saccage like a muthafucka
Gots to parlay, I was off that Alize like everyday
I was on stuck, hoes ain't shit
So I fucked that bitch in the back of the cut and got the fuck up
Saw my nigga Phonk Beta, picked him up
He had a fat sac of bomb and a blunt, I was like 'roll it up'
Now I'm twisted, with a pit's grip on the Alize
And two miles away from a top notch I met the other day
Groom yourself, I'm on my way over
In my brother's cocaine white Nova
Shift kit, high rise intake manifold, 350 motor
Now you know this wasn't no bitch
She had a nigga nuttin' quick and she could suck a good dick
I was all up in it, situation was faulty
Had to report back to the captain, and she told him she never saw me
No matter what you saw about that ho
She said 'meet me at the mo-mo' and she told you she didn't go

Chorus:
Once upon a time, once upon a time
And we did it, and we did it
Once upon a time, once upon a time
And she said it was cool
(Phonk Beta):
Cuz she's a bitch, whatever would I love a ho for?
I bust a nut and then I'mma cut right out the back door
Didn't know she had a funky rotten pussy
They could be strapped at the sideshow, check it out
Nowadays you better be strapped before you tap that ass
If not she'll have you pissin' out broken glass
Ain't that a bitch, she got you stuck with a shot in the butt
Was it really worth a nut? Check it out
What about that dummy, that one that got hooked on marijuana
Got her budded, and she nutted, we both was in the sauna
One nigga mobbed to the store for ya Donna
Well clean the wax out ya ears and hear the drama
Cuz I'mma tell it the way it couldn't be told
Sold it the way it couldn't be sold
Nigga who you talkin' bout? Bout these young sweet hoes
So tick tock, it don't stop the hustle
Donna went down lip locked on my love muscle
I'm JB the Beta manipulator, let me begin
If my dick is in your mouth then my balls is on your chin
Balls is on your chin, the pubic hairs is up your nose
I'm that nigga that gives and you that nigga that blows

CHORUS

(Brotha Lynch):
Around the corner from me
Light skinned, packed, she stood
Muggin' like a maniac in a straight jacket
It was on and crackin'
Knowin' I shouldn't be late night fuckin' with that shit
But I was off this Perry Mason bout to act like Jason
It was Friday the 13th, my day to work meat
A pack of Blacks, and a half a 20 sac of the Thai and some O.E
You know me, I fuck long and nut long
Hit you in the face with some of that silky
Hot and sicc and make you mind strong
Grab your knees and let me lean back
I'ma grip your clit with my lips
And motivate, coordinate 'g' shit
Speak Japanese up in your shit
Watch it all ease up out your shit
And we did it, and did it, and did it......
CHORUS"
On My Briefcase,Brotha Lynch Hung,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","(Lynch):
Now on my briefcase was some crumbled weed
A pack of Saravegas and a 24 ounce O.E
Might as well skeez these couple of hoes
In my 69 Malibu sitting on Trues and Vogues
For days you might have seen me in my cinnamon cut chrome shoes
With some you-can't-see-me tint on the windows indo syndrome
Smokin' it up, not givin' a mutherfucking fizuck
Sold the cut, my ex-ho said ""that nigga's sqattin' what?""
Got at the homie Carl, and got me some of that bomb
Had me so fucking high I got off like Vietnam
Dead bodies and bitches clits simmerin' in the crockpot
And the shit don't stop until my motherfucking chronic or high drop
It's just that insane type of thing, let the MAC rain. Guts in the drain
Siccmade niggas, they make the world go round
And if you fuck with Siccmade Music you can get your ass gunned down

(Phonk Beta):
I had a homie who stayed up in Alaska (what he used to do?)
Used to transfer flights over Nebraska
And flew me back about a ounce of that Alaska indica weed
And out of the whole zip possessed one seed
Had it wrapped real tight all up in cellophane
Can't have the K-9 dogs smell it, man
If only you saw what I was seein', the buds was almost pure white, but not green
Had to be one of those one-hitter quitter dome splitters
It's the type a tweed that makes you wanna fuck your babysitter
I roll a fattie, when I roll this fattie
Niggas'll be all 'noid wondering why they lookin at me
Bitches have the nerve to say my shit ain't bomb
But it'll have your lungs burning, like you're puffing on napalm
(Zagg):
I wipe that sweat up off my forehead, I'm off the kush
Lay back and take a comfortable hit, with a Q-tip, it's splitting my lips
And my dome stays split off toothpicks
I hit a lick with a quickness, dumping dead bodies in ditches
Appreciate the fact, so come correct, cause I could be vicious
Suspicious, comin' up on recognition I'm creepin' up from behind
With a 12 gauge, non-fiction, I'm all prepared to go for mine
So step in line, a couple of hits, dome split, I be lit on a for real basis
With a machete I'll slice your neck just like them Jason cases
Murder traces, but I ain't pinned cause there's no evidence
Slight scent of that purple kush plant, and I can almost sense the essence
What's the lesson? Get tested, don't come if you can't come correct
It's that West Coast shit for life. I don't know what you expected
I'm reckless, nevertheless I'm a pimp in a bulletproof vest
Putting it down, pound and pound, you need to take a step down
.50 caliber rounds, I'm running through your whole town
Buckin' em down like Doom set on deathmatch with the BFG-9000 cartoon"
Heataz,Brotha Lynch Hung,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","(First Degree):
The evil that men do got me servin' heaters
Morphin' them body bleeders into believers
Had these bitches bringin' me cleavage and cannibis-sativa
Big leaguers, wide receivers, we quivers off malt liters
So lead us to the cheap shit, got more close so I could reach it
Need it in the jungle, humble man gone too soon, wasn't ready for the rumble
So I disperse my seasoning, pleasing when I get to reasoning
Like soul cleaner, when did it, when did it get to heatin' up?
Fuck, fuck, another fuck, fuck the bitch and they stuck
Fuck till they brains stuffed, then changed they demeanor
After sticking in vagina
Turn a perfect stranger into my part time personal rump ranger
Workin' the night shift, temporary employment, ya mind says fight it
But your emotions is delighted
And thats what runs you sensitive bitches and niggas
Get ran for a loop, my heat is a muthafuck, First Degree
Oh First Degree so bound to the city
Sittin' high lookin' down next up to the climax
Stayin' deliciously loaded, quit my fry, Mr. Hot burnin' flesh
Got that THC marinatin' in my chest, that stays I guess
So I'm approachin' this light shit, and heatin' it beautiful
I'ma tokin' this wide stick, hittin' plentiful
Huh, huh, huh, tryna make my dollar
(Polo):
I got somethin' for your mask
This shit here is hard to swallow
Could be hazardous to your health
Fully equipped to leave your insides hollow
Ziplock lips and listen
I'm on a mission, switchin' positions
In case of accidental consumption
Dilute with 2 cups of milk and contact your physician
Heated and hanged, who am I? Trigger Man, suspect number one
I let loose, do not induce vomiting, or you throwing up your lung
Dialing 9-1-1, it's flammable, uncontainable
You die by the superfly when I spy, flip and grip, changeable
Specially formulated to have all costs regulated
And also the ones that participated in playing bitch games
And plain playa hatin'
5 foot 6"", sick hogg and all about mines
Dead bodies don't talk, kill 'em, tape and chalk
So if you fall short....flatline
Nigga, when you near give me adequate ventilation
Avoid physical contact and inhalation
Facial premeditation can lead to skin and eye irritation
Does that exlude a bitch, Boot town boot up, shoot up shit
Never water based, straight laced to your face
With no nurse or first aid chase, no after taste
Now brace yourself for the hand that rocks the cradle
Nigga them conversations lead to sticky situations that sometimes turn fatal
Hogg translation: Blew yay up straight with this heated association
Illustrations
Picture yourself in a body bag wearin' them closed casket decorations
I got a house full of heaters and liters of gas to light up that ass
And it's mandatory, too short for long conversation
No pre-animation, no nuts, no glory, no witness, no story
Makin' derogatory statements with my stainless
Slugs with names signed in blood, individuals stuffed up the anus
Dangerous, aimin' for your body
Almost definitely pull that for hand to hand combat karate
It's some a that southern young fool
(P-Folk):
Now what's up? I look in the rearview mirror
Chevy Astro van's suspicious
Usin' my brain, beware of the game
Suspects might be thinkin' I'm fakin'
It's a habit to be caught with and without
Reachin' up under my seat to grab my piece
And the chamber done gauged a round
Turn a beat down, put it in first gear, slow pace
Thinkin' that I might be paranoid
Effects from the filthy re-chronic blunt that I just smoked with my boys
Sped ahead, hogg check, all red til' I'm dead
And I'll be damned if these niggas try to make me, P-Folk, brake bread
I'm tied up to it, I'm dread
Like it said 'you live by the sword, you die by the sword'
These niggas don't know they got a one way ticket home to the Lord
So bullets will spray, be up and out the situation
And since it's a jack move, my objective is I gotta take 'em
Roll 'em outta the mainstream
How they warped thinkin' they been ejected all up in my section
Make a left down Elkhorn, toward northern direction
Viewer discretion, preparation for a justified homicide
These niggas know they ain't no friend of mine, (check they self)
Caught up at a red light
Grippin' this trilli, thug from Highlands with nuthin' to prove
Come here ruge, enemies hoppin' up out the low, P-Folks refuse to lose
Split ones wig with the zig, evidently he didn't see my third eye
The second suspect tried to hit P-Folk from the blind side
Exchangin' round for round, look like a match, the lead sped out the strap
One enemy down, two enemies gone, hollow point penetration to the back
The villain defeated, the driver retreated and his partna leaded
Jack got cracked in the mask, for sho' I'm heated
(Lynch):
They told me to get my heat, so I got mine
Them muthafuckas done made they hit
Now we only got the mini Mack in the trunk, sawed off pump and the .45th
Confident that we handle funk like muthafuckin' g's
So all you bitches and snitches get ditches when my trigger finger itches
It's viscous, for some reason I'm still in that season
All them other muthafuckas done left, smother muthafuckas to death
Other muthafuckas done slept long
Hit off the kryptonite and get gone
Hit 'em up two in the dome, visit your funeral home alone
Had love for them once when this shit got grim
Killin' me softly, it's costly, check the chin, hit the Henn and then bend
One dial 1-800 Old Gold
And you picture me surrounded by fifty pounds of brown meat
Grade A beef, it ain't cheap
I got that shit that'll make them weak minds upchuck
Upchuck your guts and I'll have your nuts, wassup?
You was locked down, so I fucked your bitch
Gave you that syphilis dick, looped the music, made slick throats slit
Trump tight murder on sight, split ya dome, hit ya home at night
Move in the dark with infer-red light
You die, then I'mma do your wife
I'ma leave you hangin' on your doorstep
Have your wife ass butt naked, razor blade razed from the ass to the neck"
Feel My Nature Rize,Brotha Lynch Hung,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","(Lynch):
Feel my nature rise, blood shot red eyes
Waitin' in your back seat, catch you by surprise
Situations and circumstances make you take them dangerous chances
Leave you in your front seat with your neck slit, then I'm hittin' fences
Now I'mma talk about the same dirty situation
Shit you hatin', that's why your casket is waitin'
Shine your ass up like a triple gold Dayton
When I'm in your town you better cut like Walter Payton
Studio man keep tapin', I got that bitch, she peratratin'
Show your whole family, leave you on your front porch hangin'
With a note that's saying: 'sincerely, Swartzaniggaz'
Put your hands in your pocket, give it up
I demand I need my tweed, potent refer, man
Bandstandin' with the hand cannon
Split my face, muthafucka, gimme your scrill
And that Rolex in your hand, understand?
Yeah, you gots to feel my nature rise

(C.O.S.):
I can feel my nature rise
Starin' at the marks that I despise
Through evil eyes, hostile thoughts turn homicides
You gots to die, for tryna ride and get me
Got some off, but none of them hit me
Now on a payback tip, with a pitch black mask
On the grass with a 50 caliber weapon
Hangin' up over the door of the Chev and causin' slaughter
Sid's Malt Liquor be that motive when I be loaded off that water
Saw the situation heavy rollin'
Shotgun and a Chevy that's stolen
Strapped up and ready in case these niggas wanna get deadly
We can go there, I know there's a place for busta niggas like ya'll
But I heard it's pretty deep down so you niggas better watch your fall
Too late for that 911 call, this murder's already in progress
Home invasions like Asian got me obsessed like a Vietnam vet
As I kick through the front door, blastin'
And Lynch kicked down the back
Operation: Peel-a-cap, you fools shoulda already had your gats loaded
Cuz it ain't no tellin' when we comin'
Back streets, sacks of weed get blazed as we gunnin' with the engine still
Runnin'
Cuz real killers make them real quick get aways
Spray the whole place and skirt
As quick as we can, we does our dirt
Whoever gets hurt, that's business
So please don't take this personal
It's just that murder's in my nature
So four years now, that's what I've been searchin' for
Cuz doin' dirt grows old when it's the same old thing
That's why I try to take my murders to the highest extreme
Make everybody scream, open up some spleens
Still hearin' the blood spillin'
It's just a little dream that I be havin'
Man, I love killin'
(Brotha Lynch):
I got a hard dick for killin'
Southside villain
Protect your wife and your children
Feel my nature rise

(Sicx):
Not quite knowin' about this nigga?
Check your metro sections
Then cross reference murders by streets and dates
And how many times niggas' hoes' got raped
Mr. No Prints, the reason one time runs out of yellow tape
Fuckin' with a half deck, havin' niggas on hush
Smokin' a bowl that I re-dust
Open up your chest when I bust
So suit up, cuz it's kill a nigga night
Ain't no tellin' when Triple 6 gets to shootin' up
Movin' up your death date, with a Tre-8 special
It's way too late to wrestle, as I nestle the sword stoppers
Split your ass open like pinata
Loadin' up like a Rotweiler
Lining up like Tyson snortin' cocaine powder
Pure dank sniffer, some like a lot of fluid, but I beg to differ
One wiff of that shit and I'm on cloud nine
Nigga, don't trip if you ain't got no nuts
Cuz I brought mine all buffed and shined
Untouchable when I'm fuckin' full of that nitrate wine
That's when I bust on nineteen times and up
Cuz I'm nuts, goin' out my mind
Few, there's no luck, you fucked for life, for sho'
Get your ass up on the floor
Tryin' to catch me at that lateral, slippin'
By my lonesome, but I'm on some, so who wants some?
Fresh out the gates, ain't no room to make mistakes
Try to make my tapes, but I feel the ho hate
Tuck my dick inside in the O-8
Must of been the way the clip mate with the .45
No body, no case
Taste the meat, can't wait to eat
Keep the street dirty, keep sturdy in your face
(TallCann G):
Ya'll niggas don't wanna feel my nature rise
Cuz I get dirty, shoot up shit with my Clint Eastwood
Leave your neighborhood lookin' like a ghost town, nigga
You standin' on dangerous grounds
When we come to Sac, better have your automatics on loaded status
Cuz me and my niggas be on the savage, leavin' no prints
Not givin' ya'll niggas a inch, cuz I'mma lynch you
Fry your guts like Sizziline
Have your homie reminiscing' about your gangsta lean
Nigga, it ain't no fuckin' with my clique
You can dial 911, but it ain't no rescue
Man, I hope the dear Lord bless you
Next to this nigga, ain't no one's nuts bigger
Clutch your guts nigga, fuckin' with this Swartzanigga
Cuz I done lost it, taggin' niggas like a pit bull with rabies
Gone off 40 ounces of O.E
Creepin' up on you, like doin' my Magnum P.I
Lazy Eye with Lil' Blacc Mile
Smokin' a hard dick for killin'"
My Love,Brotha Lynch Hung,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","(Lynch)
I know, you remember Holiday Inn
Had to hit it from the back drinkin OE and gin
I used to eat pussy up, I can't lie
That's really real, really real, really real
See I met you through the homies
That homie was like cuz, won't you jump up in the cutlass
Come and get you some butt
Came through swervin off OE like I always do
Same two straps in the trunk cuz where you at ain't coo
I was like boo hold up its midnight and I got the eyes tight
Knew it was on just as long as I rub the thighs right
Next thing you know, we disrespecting the couch
Feel the pressure in my nutts
Its about to come out
You was like inside, whoride, I don't give a fuck
We can fuck untill I throw up all the way to sunrise then cut
And thats what happened
It was crackin like an omlet
Got you hittin that bomb shit
And you don't even enhale the chronic
Stupid ass biiatch
(Pook)
I used to love da ho, I can't lie
Bitch had me stuck
25 years later the fuck so many haters Now the pussy tore up
Bitch you need to grow up
You already know what side I throw up (Westside bitch!)
Given our game back to weak niggas to help them niggas blow up
But shiesty bitch you know what
You gon get back , you gon feel it nigga
I heard the FBI tried to shut you down said you done been the nigga
Said you Promoting violent thoughts
And youre a thug wannabe, followin
Doing more than lickin the pussy
They smellin a tastin, bitin, swollowin leavin the pussyhole hollow
Heard the pussy picked up a forth the Henessey bottle
Now everybody thinkin They can fuck, Even them whiteboys in Colorado
But fuck it, let a ho be a ho is my motto
Can't let it rest
Gotta get it off my chest just to express my sorrow
I guess your pimp had you impressin Whore stories
Actin the sweet, said fuck ya man
Got a plan to get yo ass of the streets
Gave you the fame without the fortune
Get you under the sheets
Bitch if you always on your back, then you can't get on your feet
I used to love this rap game!
(Shotgun)
I bet you didn't know that she used to be my main ho
Back in the days
When I was runnin up in houses with socks on my hands tryin to get paid
It was like Courvoisier and Alize
Most couldn't fade, cuz we fuck till we both gain 5 6 times a day
How could I walk away from something that seems it's meant to be
You neva trip with me
When I took charge it was just the pimp in me
You was either quick to flex with it
When niggas and they bitches got fat
But look at us now, you ain't around huh
And never in my mind did I think you turned bitch on me
Skip one day and the next
Plottin licks on me
See yous a phony, I ain't fuckin wit you no more
Like Ice Cube said
You da ex-bitch, you gotz ta go
You know the motto, so fuck a ho
And puttin the bitch before the hustle thats a no
Because they have you comin up short
Spendin my last dimes, wastin all my time in my life
There's only group of one love and thats the grind biiatch!"

I wanna give a big shoutout to Da Riffs! (Shoutout to Da Riffs!)
Keep producing that fire!
Let's go!

[Hook]
Cause when it all begins
My eyes on the prize so it's on again
I refuse to loose I ain't gon' pretend
I thought I told you I was born to win
Everybody loves a winner!

Victory I choose
Ain't no turning back cause I paid my dues
I tighten up my laces when I tie my shoes
Born to win, I refuse to lose
Everybody loves a winner!

[Verse 1]
My adrenaline rushing through my veins
Next stop is victory, it's rushing like a train
I'm determined to win, cause there's nothing like the pain of defeat
I refuse to remain incomplete
Gotta lot of stamina cause I train for some weeks
Got my strength from the vitamins and the grains that I eat
All obstacles overcame, I'm unique
I started from the bottom, see I came from beneath
The sky's the limit so I'mma raise to my peak
Winning is everything, let me explain what I think
Practice makes perfect, so when working I dont relax
I practice a lot, therefore I'm perfect and that's a fact
Been through some hard times while the burner was on my back
It was rough, but I was determined so I adapt
Gettin what I'm deserving, holla back
Game over you lost like a person with outta map
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My competition said I wasn't ready to face him
My teammates said 'I think we need to replace him'
All the haters used to say 'Boo we hate him'
I wanna thank y'all for the inspiration
Waited a long time for my time I'm anxious
Something like a doctor, cause I got patience
May the best man win, the worst man lose
Last man no choice, the first man choose
I was born as a leader, that's what I gotta be
I don't follow rules, I let the rules follow me
I'mma focus man on the lose, animal out the cage
An ambitious and vicious champion with a rage
What's the difference between a champion and a challenger?
A champion already conquered his caliber
You trying to become, a champion became
I got more wins then a hurricane

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
That's why I eat finer foods
Complete wiser moves, I'mma retire you
No remorse for these tired dudes
Let's celebrate the victory, I won like three minus two
Its only what you make it thats what we gotta remember
But deep down inside everybodies a winner
You gotta work hard January 'til December
Finish what you start and you can be a contender
Watch the man in the mirror, look into your inner
Self, maintian health and never be a quitter
Gotta shine like the sun, flow like the river
You see a chance to win then take it like a picture
I ain't tryna preach to you don't feel bitter
I'm just tryna tell you what it take to be a winner
He's a champion cause it's impossible to stop him
Victory is a option

Mother, mother. Who are they
To judge us? Mother, mother
Simply cause we wear our hair long
Mother, mother Oohhhhhhhhhhhhh

[Verse 1]
Im gonna take ya'll back on this one
Mommy make me some oatmeal
The mailman outside he bringin' mo' bills
Daddy driving in his raggedy automobile
Papoose got the cooties he killed a roach ill
""Mommy Toya' keep kickin' me with them old heels""
""Boy stop trying to make a mountain out a mole hill""
I grew up in a shack just like O'Neal
Born and raised in the ghetto where it was so real
Back in the days when K' was on cold chill
We lived on the first floor, I'm from down the hill
We had to duck on the floor, they shooting off steel
They use to have shoot outs over them dope deals
They say ""If he's so nice why he got no deal?""
I say my talent is something these labels won't steal
I'm doing this for them rappers up out of Brownsville
Who never went platinum they had a bad deal

Oh, make you wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler

Yo momma so fat when she walk her booty claps
Need gloves to eat a tootsie roll, she so black
You actin' like your Mom's all that
She's so cross sighted that when she cries tears go down her back
Who ever stepped on the lines, yo' mother drink wine
Who ever stepped on the cracks, yo mother smokes crack
We told mother jokes as if we took them for granted
Drinking sugar water and eating a syrup sandwich
We threw rocks at lots, the buildings was abandoned
Father sinners was teaching, but we ain't understand it
Pissy mattresses, we was on the block flippin'
Needed some school clothes so we went shoplifting
Triple fat goose first deal big difference
Chasin' the girls, seven humps, eleven kisses
You slap box better than me, then I fought you
Smacked you in yo' face, and then start screamin' ""I caught you""

Oh, make you wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
[Verse 3]
I was borned to rappers back then, I was nice kid
Had them red and black lumberjack just like Big
Osh Kosh B'Gosh and flat tops
Battled the human beatbox stuffed wax and skelly tops
Used G's favourite pants, Tyson was the champ
Started small time hustlin' tired of them foodstamps
Back then the dreads use to have all the weak spots
Niggas were scared when they used to say ""what the blood clot!""
But the hood got tired of that you hood gunshots
Niggas started to get gun butted and what not
Tomahawks, faceheads, low lives
The ceptic cards, black spades, lil wives
GP, SSP, HBO, those are some of the new york gangs I knew
Man I'm daydreamin' off the haze I blow
I just caught a flashback, I smoked too much dro
Flashback, Flashback, Flashback"
Cant Cry,J. Cole,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Yeah
Need y’all niggas to feel me, yo
Feel my pain
Said soft niggas can’t last hard times, yo
Believe that shit
Yeah (yeah), aye (aye)
Real niggas don’t cry
Look, yo

[Verse 1]
Was just a youngin’ with that fresh fade
Bird chest, legs skinny
That hoop dreaming had me tryna be the next Penny
Fresh Pennys on my feet
Momma paid for everything I’m wearing
At the fair staring at girls, not a care in the world
Aw nigga, but shit done changed since Mane was my nickname
A little nigga chasing things, tryna kick game
Now I’m a man worried about my fam
Let me explain
It’s like my pockets stay broke, and if not them shit’s sprained
And so I rap for my niggas trapped in the struggle
You feeling like the world’s on your back so you stumble
In the field like a quarterback get sacked, then you fumble
Jobs don’t call a nigga back, so it’s back to the hustle
Niggas praying for they moms, the same time they moms pray for them
Ask the Lord to stay with them, guide them on they way
But damn a nigga been a lost faith
It hurts on the usual
The only time you catch me up at church is a funeral (damn)
[Hook]
Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga
I don’t know if I’ll see tomorrow
But I won’t cry, no, I can’t cry
And in this life, times getting hard my nigga
But fuck that, I’m aiming for the stars, my nigga
I won’t stop, try ‘til the day I die
And I won’t cry, no, I can’t cry, no
(ay, ay, ay, yea)
(listen, yo)

[Verse 2]
I sit back and watch the news every now and then
Either get depressed or mad from watching the world just crash
Even the weather’s bad
It be the same shit, got my brain twisted
Like, “Damn it’s ’06 and niggas still up on that gang shit?” (that shit old, dawg)
Yesterday this kid got his whole frame split
Only seventeen, he was finna graduate in like three weeks
Some stupid niggas got him for his chain
But he fought back, they blasted him and left him on the pavement, uh (rest in peace)
And now they telling me this little girl just got raped
Some dude snatched her, she was standing at the bus stop
Wait man, she was eleven!
What the fuck is up with this world?
Got these grown niggas fucking with girls?
Plus the cops harassing us
Every week be blasting us, on accident, or so they claim
Reporters sympathizing like they truly know the pain (right)
They killed her only son
Now she wanna blow her brains out
Change the channel man, I can’t watch this shit
[Hook]
Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga
I don’t know if I’ll see tomorrow
And I won’t cry, no, I can’t cry
And in this life, times getting hard my nigga
But fuck that, I’m aiming for the stars, my nigga
I won’t stop, try ‘til the day I die
And I won’t cry, no, I can’t cry, no

[Verse 3]
Take a ride through the city man, tell me what you witness
Poverty, richness, crooked cops, and misfits
Violence, hatred, real devastation
Neighborhoods looking like there’s still segregation
Welfare, single mothers, no jobs
Tryna get a piece for yourself, but they hogging up the whole pie
Fiends in the street so high off of that crack shit
This nigga thirteen with a gat under his mattress (bang!)
White folks got the road to success mapped and that’s all good
But why don’t blacks got that same atlas?
I asked the same question a million ways
And it seems like I done prayed for a million days
But still the ills remain, just bills and pain
Shootouts in project buildings, children slain
Skies filled with rain and I just sit and wonder why
It's enough to make a nigga wanna cry, but I can’t though
[Hook]
Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga
I don’t know if I’ll see tomorrow
And I won’t cry, no, I can’t cry
And in this life, times getting hard my nigga
But fuck that, I’m aiming for the stars, my nigga
I won’t stop, try ‘til the day I die
And I won’t cry, no, I can’t cry, no

[Outro]
Yeah, shit dedicated to my cousin Ricky man
Hoop dreams cut short man
Learned he had a baby on the way
Nigga wasn’t even a senior in high school
Hold your head man"
Wavin Flag Young Artists for Haiti,K'naan,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: All Artists]
When I get older
I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom
Just like a waving flag

[Verse 1: K'naan]
Born from a throne, older than Rome
But violent prone, poor people zone

[Nelly Furtado]
But it's my home, all I have known

[Sam Roberts]
Where I got grown, but now it's gone

[Avril Lavigne]
Out of the darkness, in came the carnage
Threatening my very survival

[Pierre Bouvier of Simple Plan]
Fractured my streets and broke all my dreams
[Tyler Connolly of Theory of a Deadman]
Now feels like defeat to wretched retreat

[Pre-Chorus: All Artists]
So we struggling

[Kardinal Offishall]
Fighting to eat

[All Artists]
And we wondering

[Kardinal Offishall]
If we'll be free

[Jully Black]
We can not wait for some faithful day
It’s too far away so right now I’ll say

[Chorus: All Artists]
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back

[Verse 2: Lights]
So many wars, settling scores
[Deryck Whibley of Sum 41]
All that we've been through and now there is more

[Serena Ryder]
I hear them say love is the way

[Jacob Hoggard of Hedley]
Love is the answer that's what they say

[Emily Haines of Metric]

And then it goes back
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back

[Verse 3: Drake]
How come when the media stops covering
And there’s a little help from the government
We forget about the people still struggling
And assume that its really all love again, nah
See we don’t have to wait for things to break apart
If you weren't involved before, it’s never too late to start
You probably think that it’s too far to even have to care
Well, take a look at where you live, what if it happened there?
You have to know the urge to make a change lies within
And we can be the reason that they see their flag rise again

[Chorus: Nikki Yanofsky]
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag

[Matt Mays]
And then it goes back

[Justin Nozuka]
And then it goes back

[Nikki Yanofsky]
Then it goes back

When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back

When I get older, when I get older
I will be stronger, just like a waving flag"
Salvation Barmy,MC Paul Barman,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'alternative']","[Intro, Female sing-song]
I am a pretty little dutch girl
As pretty as pretty can be
And all the boys around my block
Are crazy over me

[Verse 1: MC Paul Barman & The Black Italiano]
I was walking down the street looking at boobs, asses, faces
Went in the salvation army for some used glasses cases
Next to the doorway
The cashier in cashmere held up an old map of Norway
She flipped it over and the message read ""you're gay""
I looked at her anxiously, two lip rings looked like fangs to me
I said ""hope my sperm'll get under your thermal
Underwear, because you're cuter than Nermal""
She said ""go get a hair cut!"" so I showed her my bare butt
Pulled down my Carhartts, put my moon in her star charts
And to make stupid stupider, I slapped a ring on my ass
Said ""Now my moon's Jupiter"", Fucking asshole

[Male sing-song]
She has a boyfriend Fatty
He comes from Cincinnati
With 48 toes and a pickle on his nose
And this is the way the story goes
[Verse 2: MC Paul Barman & The Black Italiano]
Clicky clack, who's at the rack with the jackets
It's Black Italiano looking black cause he's backlit
Hey what's up with these fucking Chinese looking street gang jackets?
We started to slow dance, I said ""no chance for romance""
If I have to wear condoms cause they feel like snow pants
But I couldn't stay calm because she revealed the bra
Made of two yarmulkes, I said ""you're hella great
Let's celebrate!"", we took the freight elevate-
Er to continue our back and forth shagging sports
In the room with the Davenport where men become cuckolds
She chuckled, I felt her knuckle above my belt buckle

[Male sing-song]
One day when she was walking
She heard her boyfriend talking
To a little girl with a strawberry curl
And this is what he said to her

[Verse 3: MC Paul Barman]
My pissed off jimbrowski turned three colors like Krzysztof Kieślowski
I said a handjob's a man's job, yo' job's a blow job
That porn snob, that corncob with a doorknob
Is a born slob, but not blameless
Every penis wants to be famous
It's a good way to stay misogynistic and aimless
She said ""I'm glad you explained that
My name is Jane Pratt
Before you jerk off on my head
Please pass me that rain hat.""
So I did, you know? What can I say?
I'm a lonely male who won't settle for any phony in a ponytail
[Outro: The Black Italiano]
Come on, bring your woman over here
So I can show her a real Italian man
I got the best of both fucking worlds here
Fucking black man's dick and an Italian man's brain
*Prince Paul breaks into laughter after being heckled*
Fucking assholes
*Laughter from the booth*"

Thought shit den calmed down
""Gang-bangin'"" den played out by the years since I den been around
Ain't talked to nobody from my block
Cause all my niggas is locked up
And it's been all ever I seen wit a guillotine
So I was in the ""Cut Supreme""
Fifteen grams and some ""greenodine""
Ain't seen a block nigga since
But now I be off that killa green
(Mothtafuckas ain't got no love for me)
(Niggas wanna put some slugs in me)
So I'm 007, murder redrum wit my three fifty seven
Brotha Lynch Hung, but the bitches call me Kevin
They try to make me think they close to me, but Neb'in [never]
You know I gots to (say high) stay high, keep recipts for alibis
And the meat they ate from them drive-bys ain't mine
Cause mine's a supe' desguise
As I swoop the skies high off that buddha
Tah mixed the cusche and the purple hairs
And it got me high
(Now I'm rollin on the river)
Labeled Mr. FedEx
(Cause them bodies I deliver)
Got to get to my next plot
Unlock the freezer get the meat for the ""rocks"" [rotweilers]
And heat the heat cause it's the ""nine-neb'in"" ['97]

And a pound full of James Brown

Fill my pockets, hit 'em up everyday, gotta have my pay
The ganjay got me high now I'm paranoida den these booches
Filthy rich, I'mma take the loot
And the dig a ditch, tell your neighborhood bitch
To miss me with that ho shit
Cause I'mma get this nigga when he surface
And that's on everything I love, I gots to split his wig
Opened up the little blue packet, stung him like a yellow-jacket
Rib cage heavily padded, hit him with the automatic shells
Send him to hell express from his mailing address
We got his name, for sho', then we went to the house and did that shit
I know I said I do it alone in the past, everybody in the neighborhood knew
Somebody betta jack his ass up like a six-four impala
You floatin' on dirty water
Pack your shit up nigga like it's on only you and your ?woda-goda?
Track your ass down, smoke your last pound

And I was late gettin' home, intoxicated
Fight with my old lady
She was comin at me unreal, hit the blunt now she's animated
Motivate through you like a foggy mist
You can hold me in your chest-plate like that nitro hit
First Degree told me if the weed can talk
It'll talk some shit, gotta get me an underspot
Make me a Hemp Museum like B-Legit
I'm tryin to bump my head on the moon
Live so high up in the mountains eatin' snake meat, fried raccoons
With a attitude I need food to eat up
Smoke a fat blunt on my couch with my feet up
Top notch programs, DOS mode Windows 95 upgrade siccmade

Cant Get There From Here,Spose,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Cam Groves]
Everybody throw your hands up right now
And make some goddamn noise
Hailing from the state of oceans and lakes
Get ready for those good rhymes and metaphors
The state of Maine changing the game
Make music good for your brains
So open your ear lobes, this here's Spose

[Verse 1]
With no rims on the whip and no collagen lips
I rip through the state of Maine with the halogens lit
I'm not Rick but I spit Slick
I'm rapping and making the fakest of rappers who're thinking they're sinking my ship quit quick
All aboard!
From the state where they think we all mate with our cousins
With no indoor plumbing, Moose by the baker's dozen
We got lakes, ponds, deer on lawns
Puff upon chron', rockin' long johns
Spat verses over-purchased thirty racks of beer
Made peers laugh and cheer
Throw a hand up in the atmosphere
‘Cause everybody knows my name like the cast of Cheers
But they say I shouldn't rap from here
I made it finally
Puffed all kinda leaves
Wack rapper, time to leave
Rhyme's sick, Lyme disease
Pine trees, skate rails
While mostly white trophy wives rock fake nails at bake sales
And all the haters say, Spose
[Hook]
Are you out of your brain!?
Rapping from Maine!?
You must be insane!
‘Cause you can't get there from here
Or delusional
Please quit the beats
And retreat to the cubicle
You can't get there from here
You must've lost your mind!
I mean, those rhymes
They were fine for the time
But you can't get there from here
You're from the eastern-most, northern-most, boredom-soaked state
You can't be great
You can't get there from here

[Verse 2]
I'm from where teenage moms and their babies dwell
Where people downgrade from cocaine to oxy pills
Where the wives get beat and no one hears them yell
And it's not Compton or Brooklyn or ATL
We spend most times weeded
‘Cause the coastline's scenic
But the chances of succeeding are slimmer than a bulimic
Still I put my life in rhyme form and recorded it
On my debut and stayed true to my coordinates
No, never aborted it
Ask my subordinates
Since back when my weed had more seeds than tournaments
I'm going for the gold (as if that wasn't obvious)
And stopping Spose? That's like tryna handcuff an octopus
Woke up every morning wrote a new verse
Even if I wasn't winning I wasn't a loser
Look, if you want to excel like huge shirts
Doesn't matter what your zip-code is, just do work

Are you out of your brain!?
Rapping from Maine!?

But you can't get there from here
You're from the eastern-most, northern-most, boredom-soaked state
You can't be great
You can't get there from here

[Verse 3]
They say you can't get there from here without magic
Well POOF! I Google Mapsed it, I'm there, maxin'
I-I I seen 'em laughing now I'm the main attraction
And when I die, they'll pour out all their Pabst in my absence
Steered off course, fuck your path, I'm the captain
Crunch time all day, serial with my actions
No need for lucky charms, just a bit of passion
To make it from where frosted flakes fall to relaxin'
Yeah I fooled fools, used tricks on silly rabbits
Did it just for kicks when I started out rapping
And I grew up in Maine so they said, ""it'll never happen""
But we got the alphabet too, and I'm nasty:
Coming to kill it abilities
Some of the illest they ever did see and they love it
They haven't a crumb of my skill
And I'm sonning the dumbest of villains, I'm cunning
I stomached the summit, no vomiting from it
Above all the beef and the killing and bluffing
I'm bigger than something to bump when you're drunk and you're puffing your stuff, call me Spose!

Bino on that hood beat, yain't know he had it in him
Came on this beat, I ain't even buy it dinner
Slide inside the party late, leaving with the baddest ho
Whiskey shots and doin Asian bitches is the status quo
The future's always coming, whether clitoral or vaginal
Always in that pussy like my jacket made of calico
It's on, I made this shit for New Years
Play this shit at midnight, like TV shows with boobies
My asthma status chronic, you can get an ounce of that
Real G's only

Attracted to an awkward bitch, but mostly cause we're opposites
Blew up in 0-10 like tick, tick boom
No drugs at the club, I'mma slip shit through
Came hard on this bitch, and my dick did too
Here's a list of the shit I'm addicted to

It's on, it's on, yes-yes, it's on  It's on, it's on, Let me tell you how it's on

[Verse 2]
Who the fuck you think this bitch is leaving with?
Cause one of us is famous like 'She and Him'
Wasn't cool in high school, but that's expected with geniuses
My music goes hard, bang shit like gay penises
My DJ be Sosupersam
She Asian, fuck that Klu Klux Klan
I love these clothes, that's who I am  My name mean fashion, Gucci mane
We are not exclusive, I hope she understand me
Chris Brown pussy, it won't make it to the Grammys
Finally met your girlfriend, that is why her knees hurt
Been to hell and back and all I gots this fuckin T-shirt
Laughing while mackin these hoes
Vastly these rappers are slow
Asking to get back in the know
When they lacking a passionate flow
Trust in Gambino, he has never failed us
Cause I have got ""S"" plus what a dog's tail does
Read your blog, it says fuck that fag
I'm like LOL, hash tag rap
DC be spittin Jigga
He white, but he my nigga
My shit be grown man
Your shit be kitty litter
I always do it bigger
I always do it bigger
[Chorus]
What ya'll really want,  What ya'll really want, now
Black guy on Mad Men. I'm telling ya'll it's goin down
Ring around the Ros'e, these bitches love to fall down
Sober girls, broke niggas, tell em that they're not allowed
It's on, it's on, yes-yes, it's on  It's on, it's on, yes-yes, it's on
It's on, it's on, yes-yes, it's on  It's on, it's on, Let me tell you how it's on

Thank you guys for 2010
Try to do it bigger in 2011
Thank you"
Untouchable,Childish Gambino,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Childish Gambino, yeah, my voice is annoying
So I don't talk, I let the streets talk for me
Yeah, these girls crazy, half got children
I hate their ex-boyfriends, call 'em Scott Pilgrim
I'm fucking girls I really shouldn't be fucking with
But if we get caught, we just hand it off to our publicists
Plus, I hang with some of their ex-boyfriends
What can I say? I make bad choices
Culdesac dropped, day one, five figures
Fish fry, nigga, fry mine bigger
Still unsigned, fans saying ""What's the hold out
When every show you've ever done's been sold out?""
I always wondered what this Hollywood would do to me
""Who's that rapping—Yo, it's Troy from Community!""
""Fuck that man, dude, you lying like a muh'fuck!
Besides, the beat's real good, but the lyrics suck.""
Well I made the beat too, yeah, soak it in
I'm a phenom, nigga, where the fuck you been?
People say that I should be more humble
And I hope they understand that they don't listen when you mumble
And it only takes a lie to make a dynasty crumble
That why I catch feelings and these other dudes fumble
I'm not playing, this music's something that I care about
I take your shit to the streets, watch me air it out
Get the check, deposit the shit at Maxfield
Feeling myself, I don't even need an ex-pill
""I wish he'd do a funny rap, like SNL did.""
If I don't take myself serious, who the fuck else will?
And to the critics with reviews that were more than sour
Is it strange having jobs I can do tomorrow?
You bitches don't like shit, and it's kinda sad
I like food, sex, clothes, watching Breaking Bad
I’m something that these cool kids never really had
That's why these nerdy kids come find me on the internet
I wanna be different, I wanna do it good
Not another actor-turn-rapper in movies 'bout the hood
Niggas say they want the real, but get mad when they hear the truth
Please forgive them, father, for they're not knowing what they do
I make this music so these younger dudes don't have to choose
Trying to hate me means you really hate you
[Hook]
Life goes fast and I'm holding on tight
I let things go when I'm holding this mic
And it's six in the morn', I've been writing all night
If I keep on going, I'm hoping I might be
Untouchable, untouchable, untouchable

[Verse 2]
My dad called saying, ""Son, are you okay?
I just listened to ‘The Last’ on your mixtape.""
Dad, I'm fine, you just need to understand
When I'm rapping on a track, that's exactly who I am
And all my smart friends saying, ""I really liked your album, dude
But you could be the next Mos Def if you wanted to.""
Dear friends, I respect your responses
But my life is a dream, so I rap unconscious
I'm sorry guys, I hope I didn't let you down
I rap what I know, I hope the fans will work it out
Not conceited, but sick of trying to lay low
No drugs, I'm just tryna tell 'Ye ""yo.”
Online dudes shouting out that they better than me
I'm doing three other jobs, bitch, you better be
Cause if you're trying really hard, that's embarrassing
I won't stop until I'm fucking running everything
The more I rap, the more I'm harder to follow
I get a text from Questlove, I gotta call ‘em tomorrow
Coming harder than other dudes, it's harder to swallow
That I'm blowing up; 13 Mission: Apollo
Fuck niggas who doubted me, eat your words, it's a feast
I used to hear ""Nah's"" all the time like Kelis
Fuck the old Donald Glover, yeah, I'm glad he's deceased
Cause that sad weak being's been replaced with a beast
[Hook]
Life goes fast and I'm holding on tight
I let things go when I'm holding this mic
And it's six in the morn', I've been writing all night
If I keep on going, I'm hoping I might be

Creepy crawling, in your crib
We're comin' to kill
Catch you while you sleep
Wake up to a gun in your grill
Doing Satan's business
Tie you up, hang you, strangle you
.22 cal bang, bang you
Mephisto with a pistol on methadrine crystal
Give me all the money
To me you're less than shit stool
Juxed 51 times, women screaming
Blood everywhere
Bound and gagged, in fear in your stare
Beg for your life
Break the gun handle on your skull
Take a jagged knife
Then like an animal indulge
In non-stop stabbing trife
Puncture pregnant bitch, rupture arteries
My horrific cult of vultures
Butchering, no remorse, bludgeoning
Slit your throat, gushing like a flushed toilet, now your hunched
My infamous psycho posse
Tagging 'pig' up on the door in blood
You can't stop me from
[Chorus]
Stabbing and stabbing and stabbing and stabbing (Until you die) Stabbing and stabbing and stabbing and (My cult keeps)
Stabbing and stabbing and stabbing and stabbing (Viciously!)
Stab you to death! {*Gunshot*}

[Verse 2]
Face down on the bed
Pillow case over your head
Lamp cord choked
Leave everyone in the place dead
Knife to your chest, your colon flexes
Slashing the word 'war' in your solar plexus
We're piranhas get you prepped for embalmers
You're pleading, bleeding profusely in your pajamas
Attacking my prey like a starving hawk
Jux ya buttocks with an ox and a carving fork
Senseless crime, no motive
Sacred deed
Shock the world, make 'em stand up and take heed
Needle tracks on my arm
Influenced by Beatles tracks
Doing your fetal sac harm
""Patty, do something witchy later""
Helter skelter in blood on the refrigerator
Exit, me and my vicious accomplices
Hitch-hike back to the ranch
Mission accomplished
[Chorus]
Stabbing and stabbing and stabbing and stabbing (Until you die) Stabbing and stabbing and stabbing and (My cult keeps)
Stabbing and stabbing and stabbing and stabbing (Viciously!)
Stab you to death! {*Gunshot*}

Be about your paper nigga take it
Everyday’s a hustle, got these haters at my neck
Suckers tryna get a check
Boss dogg does it, hoes wanna call it what it wasn’t
Tryna kiss a nigga all in public, bitch, is you crazy?
I preach pimping not pussy, shit I heard it all before
I ain’t no motherfuckin rookie
I’m a long beach, grown twenty? playa ’bout his g’s
I ain’t tripping off these walls
You know these rats is after cheese
Messing with my focus, the locust on his grind
They be focus on this dick and keep your focus off my time
Stay in the lane that I made for you to chill
Until then it’s been real, I gotta handle business
And you I know we’re in it, see tripping gets you nowhere
Cause bitch i’m on that

I don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch all on me

We used to rock to the rhythm that didn’t stop
Now you telling me I need to be getting out and go find me a bitch
Cause it’s over and through
But why do I need a bitch when I got you
I don’t mean it like it sounds, but we used to be a team
Yo, we used to have a dream yo, we used to put our things together
Now it’s dividing, hiding, bottled up negative feelings inside
These bitches, they come a dime a dozen
Fuck one that once sucked my dick and find another (bitches)
I don’t need ‘em, don’t buy ‘em nothing to drink, I don’t feed them (bitches)
Never mind them, I stay in front, I used to chase behind them(bitches)

The recipe for danger, phone checking, the recipe for anger
I’m from a gang but I don’t wanna bang ya
And I can tell how you tell all your friends about my Benz and my ears? bitch
Really I’m the perfect stranger, which turned you to the perfect stalker
Body like miss parker, maybe get little darker
But I’ma have to pass on that ass you was too much in the first place
Never understood when it was work day
And then she all up on your boy in the worst way
You need to detox, bitch see Dr. Dre

Watch me bail, nigga but you don't see me though
Cause I'm rollin' fat sacks in the back of my vehicle
But takin' a puff of the dank stuff
And enough that double O-A-E dooz me
I'm slowly loadin' up the UZI
Well now who's he?
Well, it's that dead motherfucker doe
Well, whatcha know, comin' through with that murder mo
And I heard you know, now whose been bustin' up on the garden blocc
You either give up the information

Anymore sacks to roll up, we need that high back
So niggas done load them nines and pull them hijacks
And lie back in the cut and roll another fat one up
Tack one up for loc to the brain
Them niggas that really don't give a fuck
Around and get buck-shotted up and dumped in a truck and left in a cut
So nigga now whatcha gon do with a mini MAC-10 ten at yo gut
Plus niggas nuts and guts is what I rips for
Creepin' up in a six four impala
Mobbin' a loots all up to make you vomit from the raw gut cause
Know what I do is let my nine do the talkin'
Leavin' you walkin' to your funeral, loc
Diggin'? yo smoke from the mack 1-0

See cause have of the city of Sac still ain't accepted

Cause my O-T told me why Jesus got to kick up some dirt
And I'm tired of warnin' a motherfucker about a nigga like me
When it's hard to believe
The nine millimeter comin' out my pants gonna make you dance
See that's the city and it's making a motherfucker stress
Gotta watch your back like 24-7

Opening Titles,Braintax,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Skinnyman]
...We both came from the city of Leeds
With all those wicked as theives
We halve the apple for the man to proceed
Now we, come to blaze it all across the map
We know where we're coming from so we know where it's at
It's Braintax and Skinnyman blazing a track
Biro Funk for all the rap junkies to pack in a sack

[Verse 2: Braintx]
First of all for all the heads who don't know by now
I'm gonna start from the top and break it all right down
My moniker is Braintax when I'm spitting on wax
Or when I'm making a track but when I'm sending a fax
I sign J Christie on a licence contract cos I'm on my own label
And it's called Low Life
Putting records in the shops since '92
A lot of people don't know and think this here's brand new
I gotta shout out Destiny from Catch A Groove days
For buying in my records trekking round in a haze
Through the West End, back then me and my best friend
But now Braintax is a one-man scheme
And all my friends contribute to this solo team
I know I mean what I say plus I know what I mean
Do you know what I mean? This is Biro Funk
And it feels like a giro and a henry of skunk
See I - got the beats from Harry Love I do shows with
And me and Mystro got flows and now you know mate
I've been rapping since the Toxteth riots
So you new jack, American-wannabees need to stay quiet
I'm mad at life cos I don't really wanna be here
My Benny Live track will make you see clear
Like The Grip - Jehst beat - politics, know the dark shit
Low Life is depth, dopeness we start shit and show paths
Not in it for the laughs
And looking after business though I still hate maths
But I love cash, every 20 note's a brick
In my house in the sun that's why I'm up at half 1
I swore to stop writing punchline nonsense
And now it takes longer but I penetrate your conscience
(Who's this?) No-one else sounds like Brains, you get me?
North plus South, and my mood? Well, it's tetchy
[Hook] {repeats}
""Everybody, everybody, everbody""
""C'mon""

[Braintax]
OK, we're just starting now
Stay with the Biro Funk
I gotta give shout outs to people on the album, made it what it is
And goes like this (Braintax) that's me
Harry Love hitting on with funky beats
(Mystro!) flows to make you feel complete
Skinnyman too for analysing my shit
On the cut shorty blitzen, the shit don't stink
I'm banging for that SP shit
(Like what?) and Benny Live with the different vibe
And Jehst, one of the best - a true scribe
I ??? for the funk life
Taskforce music from the corner this year
A Shepard's Bush traffic for my atmosphere

That's how we set it off
Braintax, the finest shit
One more time fore the weed heads at the back!
La da da da dat dat
La da da da dat dat..."
The Grip,Braintax,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[President Franklin D. Roosevelt] {​​1937}​​
""It ought to be inconceivable that in this modern era
And in the face of experience
Any nation could be so foolish and ruthless as to run the risk
Of plunging the whole world into war by invading and violating
In contravention of solemn treaties
The territory of other nations that have done them no real harm""

[Verse 1]
From the furthest point East to the wildest West
Powers travelled round the planet on a bloody conquest
European kings and priests with omnipotence
Soldiers freakin out in foreign lands killing citizens
And worse still spreading germs and plagues
Now is so much a result of those bad old days
From the town hall, to inner-city architecture
From the money in Surrey to sweatshops up in Leicester
Casino alcoholics in the Mid-West
Junkies in Brazil feel the effects of mass death
The urge to learn killed by a greed for piles of gold
And churches justifying lives being sold
Though the culprits change, control rarely shifts
Only China comes close to even fucking with this
This world we call Earth and the system I diss
A lifestyle full of work where we barely exist
Look at Chile now - decimated native populations held down
The rich, white powers holding on
With British backing like Malaysia's arms buying
The same gang's running the show
And I'm trying to see through this and not become a lone hitman
Out to kill that bitch Maggie Thatcher with a sick plan
Sick bitch, supporting Pinochet in extradition
On telly, she put my brain into a strange position
So can you come to terms with devilish ways?
Or do you try to escape, run away or start to pray?
I try to think about the positive things
One Love, no queen, one god, no king
[Scratches]
""The Grip""...

[Verse 2]
I wish I had the will to fight back
Be at the World Trade Centre all dressed in black
Me and an angry pack
Instead I just rap and give back
And see a rich life and think 'I still want to live that'
It's so subtle how they muddle us
Now life is so complex we let the small things trouble us
And revolution? Forget that for the one fact
We don't have the arms to even try to compete
It's even easier to keep your head down and stay asleep
And while you're lying there counting see your face in them sheep
And that's deep but not as deep as losing a child
Seeing his teeth crushed by the rifle butt by your village hut
Pure grief, thanks to far away beef
Fried in messed-up religion half-baked with belief
So I won't stop rapping 'til you get my drift
That we're held in the Grip getting sorely dissed
Capitalists are we, we pretend we're not
Buying better trainers each year, connecting dots
We go from first job to next job, to mortgage to kids
Make it harder to be happy 9-to-5in' to live
Me I'm striving to give but I'll hustle like mad
Just to get ahead in life
I need money so bad, yeah I'm pissed now
So do you get my gist now?
If hell existed, half the world's already in the lift down
In the grip!

Show guru buys hammer movies and goes on

Turn the page over, British brain overload
Killing ???, rape case, church, falls asleep - here's your cell
Not quite the Paris Hilton steeze??
Terror swoop, that's 2 wives in one house up for
Mortgages, mortgages, property feature
Loyalist shamed?? perve, catch that creature!
It's a whole load of gossip
Called up against two strikers, Henry's lost it - I don't care
15 years for bank gang - I don't care
I Guess I should care, but really - I don't care!

""You can't see us

I'm like an underground news channel
Most music out is just an ad break, from real-made ??
A hodgepodge of consuming, non-thinking parasites
Comparable with Channel 5, coming out your satellite
A sad state of affairs, lots of people in the world un-aware
People say it doesn't matter, I'm like ""Yeah.""
It's kinda like a crime indeed
The stuff TV producers ignore and what they feed us instead...
It's all celebs and what they doing in bed
They could be making people think instead
Just to sit back and hold up your hands is no excuse
Feed us brain-dead crap - it's turning(?) our mouth to abuse
They say ""What about the ratings?"" (I say ""What about morality?"")
They say ""I'm tryna keep my job"" (I say ""Check your mentality"")
So concerned with a move up the ladder
Where your salary and your life is all that really matters
A career in the media, a nation in tatters
From your fierce bred?? and trivia, and tabloid patter
You beleive what they can 'til you give em a change
Checking the range of channels man, it's funny and strange
You got a whole load of choice (Really nothing is on)
The content of these papers (Man something is wrong)
It's no coincidence white vanman in middle England
They're talking about immigrants tits and peodophilia
While steady killing the world, not recycling
The agenda that the media's setting is kinda frightning
And no one got done over ???
But they don't put it on the front page, I guess it's really not surprising
My rage is far from staged like Big Brother
I'm the real reality - put Joey Brains on your cover

She was Beyoncé, I could've got my Hov on
And when she hang up on me, I tell her hold on
Quit that shit, I don't use force
Today is a bad day, we've been divorced
What I think about stress, I don't really need it
But this is plagiarism, 'cause my shortie just cheated
And shortie conceited
(She out of her mind, I wish she had Louis and a card in decline)
She had school with no aid, no HIV
Hope you don't get in the club with that fake ID
Why would you hurt somebody that you called your man for?
And I hope you get evicted by your landlord
But, she be messin' with me
And I'm hoping she lose my number indefinitely, so

Everyday oughta be a bad day for you (Yeah, uh)
Everyday oughta be a bad day for you (That's right)

Your emotions on a roller coaster, no fun fair
You were happy on the phone, but hate me when I come there
Xaphoon, let's cut it down to a drum snare
Yeah, yeah, just like that
I hope, I hope you go deaf so you can't hear shit
Yeah, I hope, I hope you go blind

And, I know I could have did more
But I'm never home, I was always on tour
I could be anywhere in the world, had one wish
To be with you until you gave that dude a tongue kiss
And this is hard for me to say like a tongue twist
My heart don't beat for you so let the drum hit
And, you know I just got promoted
Now I be the boss and I hope you get demoted
Happiness is a warm gun, live it fully loaded
And shit got worse when I exploded, boom
I wrote it soon, I hope you brought a cab pay
And I hope you get detention on a half day
I wish I could use your blouse for an ashtray
'Cause for you, everyday should be a bad day

You lookin at your own worst enemy

When you alone, everybody talk to theyself
Sometimes it's the only way to get across to yourself
You ever wanted to do somethin but thought to yourself
Or didn't wanna do somethin but forcing yourself
You ever did somethin good and been glad for yourself
Or did something fucked up so you mad at yourself
Thought about something funny and laughed to yourself
Or kept that to yourself
You ever met another person
Who reminded you in the past of yourself
Why y'all so much alike you asking yourself
Y'all so much alike y'all clash cause it felt
Like he was trying to be you when he act like himself
Really deep down inside you mad at yourself
Pull the gun and blast at him you blast at yourself
Ever knew something was true and then nodded to yourself
'Cause you can't take the truth stop lyin to yourself

It's like the mind fight the heart
Some niggas mind so sharp, they fight what they feel
And do the wise thing they so smart
But other niggas do whats in their heart
React off emotions they black out and get so dark
They hold it in and never talk
But get old and die of heart attacks
They get attacked by their own heart
Some niggas get too conceited and fill theirself
Try to be somethin they're not but reveal theirself
Some niggas get insecure they grill theirself
Put a gun to their own head and kill theirself
You ever found yourself looking out for everybody else
So much that you don't look out for yourself
If you a stick up kid in red, drug dealer in blue
A rapper with a mic, salesman with a shoe
Don't let nothin get in your way just do what you do
'Cause the only person that can stop you is you
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Thats why I say ""who am I?""
You say ""what a stupid question"" but who am I?
Think before you start talking
You forgetting where you came from
Remind yourself
Life is like a dictionary
Define yourself
Are you a gangsta?
Well lets define that word
I'mma try but it takes action to describe that word
A gangsta takes care of family, he's never afraid
Death before disrespect, a gangsta is brave
Are you a thug
Its like a gangsta but more gully
Money before bitches and honor before money
You a baller?
Then you cop a house before a car
Fortune before fashion play monopoly y'all
Are you a rapper?
Then you must invent those songs
They dont gotta like you
But they gonna respect your boss
I named my son Papoose
He reflecting me
But he way better than me
Man controls his destiny

And me I’m so fly, I swear I came in a plane then landed on a lot
Smooth like grease, laughing at the pop you should choose like teeth

And it’s only gon be worn once like a wedding gown
Somebody tell the town Short Dawgs in the annex
Pistol on my hip and I pop it like a Xanex
Got the niggas tripping cause we got the hoes dripping
You see I’m balling like Jordan you just a Scottie Pippen
Catch you slipping

And the tint dark as coffee, a nigga feeling bossy
Pulling hoes like a tooth and it’s hard to get em off me

The Louie V rag got me chequered with the matching kicks
Grinnin’ at your chick, the surp got me leaning like ten after six
Therefore I tell her, go on bust it open, go on bust it open
They call me Short Dawg but no I ain't from Oakland
My money so tall that you gon have to climb it
If she know how to rewind it, trust me I’m gon change the climate
And then I get behind it like I’m tryna do the heimlich
She heard that I be rhyming and I’m balling like Kirk Hinrich
She’s looking for some love, but over here she will not find it
So get down on your knees, you’re int he presence of Your Highness

See I step up in this bitch like a gamma, get your cameras
Money on the table bitch, respect my table manners
Young Money the shit, did you get the memorandom
And these other niggas think they flying the Atlantic
Haa, What you doing
I’m throwing money, they take too long with the ones
Fuck It, I’ll start throwing hundreds
Y'all niggas ain't spending shit

Feel this, I'm fearless, now hear this
Tackled it after Lupe killed it

Stumbled upon the rock like a pilgrim
Made money, money made power
Unstepped on as it came off the Mayflower
I come from graffiti'd halls
Now the X marks the spot on my graffiti walls

The double entendres remind you of Andre 3K
Make you spin it back like a DJ

From no business, to 50-50 deals
Joint ventures got the fans screaming ""Clipse, we missed you""

Nothing stops Malice from driving off the lot

Cut You Off To Grow Closer,Kendrick Lamar,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Tae Beast]

[Intro]
Ali, you thirsty on Twitter!
You boo-boo, you T'd
You turned down, you thirsty
You boo-boo!

[Verse 1]
Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna find myself, I'm searching deep for Kendrick Lamar
I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God
They say he the key to my blessings, and if I speak the good
Into existence, that instant my dreams will unlock
Money flow like water, I'll just wait at the dock
And by the way I'ma start, finding more light to shed
Like a small garage in your backyard
I'm back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine
But I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
Always hollering who she don't like and who she kick it with
Who she wanna fight, who wearing a weave
Who Dooney and Bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys
To the car she drove last year or who fucking on who
And who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves
But before your negative energy curve, bitch I'ma cut you off
[Chorus 1]
'Cause every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up... hoe
Every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say...

[Verse 2]
Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me
Or at least inquire similar desires
To do what it T-A-K-E just to reach the T-O-P
I'm talking ideas, motivation
It's more than making, enemies, my nigga
Oh, that's not ya memo? Then tell me why you constant stressing
On how you well connected like centipedes, my nigga
I function with you and you flaunt your pistol
Every second tell me how you pressed 'em at the Monte Cristo
Where so and so from, and what neighborhoods beefing
Who baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend
That shit is mad depressing, bringing me down
Speak on somethin' with some substance that can get us both paid
Rather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style
Or his rims ain't bigger, pussy nigga, I'ma cut you off
[Chorus 2]
'Cause every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up... scary ass
Every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say

[Verse 3]
Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star
I'm tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa
Studying art... now paint that picture
Life behind bars, remember the very day I got caught?
I murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?
See what I was taught, family is all I need
But indeed them too can run me right up a tree
Constantly talking shit 'bout the next relative
Wanting me to take sides, but I'd never give in
Ever since grandma died, everyone parted ways
Argue on holidays, left my uncle in prison
For 15 years, no one paid him attention but moms
Yeah, my momma as loyal as any sister would come
Come to my house just to yap about your own people
Dang, and if your blood wasn't running through my veins
I would prolly cut y'all off too, yep
[Chorus 3]
'Cause everytime y'all come around
Y'all be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say, oh my God, shut the fuck up
Keep it running, Ali
Every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say

What is HiiiPoWeR?
HiiiPoWeR is the way we think, the way we live
See it’s known today that the human race is nothing
No morals, no standards
What we’re about to do is raise the level of expectations
No, you don’t have to have a lot of money
You don’t have to be rich
But you will be rich in mind and spirit
Some say it’s as big as a crew, some say it’s as big as a gang
HiiiPoWeR, we stand for it as if it’s as big as a religion"

Bitch I'm whipping in a piece of crap car
But I don't give a fuck cause I spit it mad hard
You could inspect my lyrics never find a bad bar
I'm in my backyard rolling chronic, rap rollick
Artist like Jack Pollock, drop shit so sick I need an antibiotic
I'm an otter and I'll crack you like the shell of a mollusk
Oh my God, it's Webby With a machete
Ready to go after both Jason and Freddy
I am deadly like a black mamba, sipping Odwalla
Mixed with vodka running shit like the Godfather
So call me Corleone, I'm rolling with 40 homies
And you could hold the camera, come watch your shorty blow me
My first is in five minutes like off of the brains
So ask anybody bitch they'll say I'm off of the chain, ay

Get it? Cause if a pet got evicted
It, uh, wouldn't have a leash on... Man, shit, forget it
I'm twisted, roll it up, hit it
I'm so fucking dope They should put me on exhibit
Cause you know I rip it every day spitting more and more
Magic than any Slytherin or Gryffindor
Dumbledore's stepping in, feeling like the principle
Don't need a body guard, Webby's invincible
My life is inimitable, but I'mma push 'em to the back
Like I hired 'em as actors, I'll put 'em in a cast

Crushing Keystones all night get silly
Let's throw down at beer pong cause bitch I'm illy
Hit six cups, then I re-rack 'em like Willy
I am a Gremlin and I rhyme never ending
Stay getting high got no time for descending
People give me praises any time I get mentioned
Even though my skin's whiter than the belly of a penguin
I need an intervention before I go brain dead
With a pencil is the only time I aim lead
But me and your girl gon' wake up in the same bed
Wiping her mouth claiming she never even gave head
I'll murder K-Fed and hit Britney up
Oh, you got two kids? I don't give a fuck
She said hit me one more time so I hit it up

Rollin' deeper than Bikini Bottom pick 'em up and drop 'em

Hit em' so hard that nobody could revive 'em

And it's true, I'll knock you outta your socks and your boots
Eat you like an animal, I'll put 'em in a sandwich dude
Damage you when I put it on wax man
A dirty mothafucker, I just hopped out the trash can
And pussy?, I'm gettin' that fam
My dick's been in more holes than my brain's got in a CAT Scan
And battle me son? you don't really want it
Comin' back with my shield or I'm coming back on it
A Spartan to the heart, I will knock you unconscious
Flyer than a pilot, but no relation to Pontius
A toxic avenger, Into the Twilight Zone bro and I'm comin' back never

I am who I am and nobody can change it
And I'll keep doin' me till I get myself famous

And make myself money off a mastery of language
The portrait's been painted

Pick up the mic and kill it because I'm that raw
And the next person to compare me to Ash Roth
Is getting every feature on their fuckin' face smacked off

Diplomats, huh
Juelz Santana, Jim Jones, Freekey Zekey
Hoffa, Dash, uhh
Killa, uh

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Y'all niggas dreamed it, I've seen it
Body warm, heart anemic (I really mean it)
Coke, a nigga steamed it, fiends I leaned 'em
Beamer leaned it (I really mean it)
Guns, really beaming, rarely miss, what's really good?
Bikes, wheelie and creaming (I really mean it)
I'm a, genius, Papadopoulos, never lenient
On your Zenith (I really mean it) Killa
Bag me more mutts, they actually all ducks
Caddy more trucks, it's Daddy Warbucks
And you Orphan Annie, ma, take off your panties
Seat soft and sandy (I really mean it)
Yeah, let's get lost in candy
I got lofts in Boston, Austin, flossing, of course, Miami
Reno, Nevada, sip piña colada
Mama, I've seen all the Prada (I really mean it)
I rock, Mauri, Fennix
Road to glory, seen it, you seen it (I really mean it)
The game: abuse it, it's pain in music
But this year, wrist wear remains the bluest
I get lame and lose it, beef? Came to do it
Aim and shoot it, flames turn your brains to fluid
Y'all just kids, see what I just did
Take a couple bars off, let Just live
[Interlude: Jim Jones]
Yeah, now that's powerful music man
You need to pop something and roll something (I really mean it)
Killa, we did it man, I got your back forever
Dipset (I really mean it)
And them lames, we pop them sideways and drag them faggots
(I really mean it)

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Okay, we back in, mami listen (I really mean it)
Ayo, lock my garage, rock my massage
Fuck it, bucket by Osh Kosh Bgosh
Golly I'm gully, look at his galoshes
Gucci, gold, platinum plaque collages
From collabos, ghostwriting for assholes
Wanna use my brain, they give Killa mad dough
It's all good, increase Killa cash flow
Increase my fame, that's why Killa smash hoes
You'll get side swiped, look at my life
First movie ever, merked out Mekhi Phife
And papi got jerked out of pies twice
Dipset, we working with five dice
Cee-lo and craps, C notes and stacks
I send bodies with ""read this note"" attached
""Ya young'n fucked with boys in the hood""
Gave her a son like Ricky from Boyz N the Hood
On the couch bloody, old lady sighing
Wifey screaming (I really mean it)
Pissy little baby crying, fucked up man
Shit, there you seen it (I really mean it)
Fam, man, you terry cloth, that mean you very soft
Gravy Mercedes, add the cranberry sauce
Killa
[Outro: Jim Jones]
Yeah, gangstas ride man
Flex we got you, guns up (I really mean it)
And all my ladies, man, the ghetto's a saditty
I need you, I want you (I really mean it)
Oh, pop something, roll something
Get twisted, that's on Jim, nigga (I really mean it)
Harlem! Man we here to stay
It's nothing left to say man (I really mean it)
Eastside, and as for that lame man, Nasir
I ain't even gon' say your last name

In the middle of the club blowin endo
Rolling up a swishers sweet, fat as Mr Winslow
Cause right now only family matters
And all these other niggers pissed cause they got little bladders
I came to shatter haters dreams kill they self esteem
Don't try to make up now my niggas this ain't maybelline
You have made it seem no body like me
And now I ain't gay so I don't care if niggas like me
Bitches know I'm cooler and I rock like Mikey
I, I, I rock things way out of your price range
We don't look at price tags never will never have
Just ask for they forgiveness later on
When you see my chick you see a chick that you will never have
And that's a concept you will never grasp
I'm the shit fertilizer in that greener grass
I'm bout to eat Ramadan, watch these niggas fast
Now puff puff pass now and pour another glass

My momma asked me is the bragging really necessary
I say no but this shitt is gonna make me legendary
And I apologize for cussing, but when it come to rap I don't apologize for nothing
Disgusting nigga yuck to the maximum
These rap niggas rerun I'm yelling what's happening
Even if they get me they fucking with closed captioning
When you niggas dis me you ain't gettin no reaction
Cause emotions is for women and niggas who just be sittin when they pissin I ain't asking for permission
I'll just ask for they forgiveness later on
After I take the throne and bring it back to my home
No we on like the opposite of off, come from the same cloth
With TI get some Andre, Hov, and some Kanye
So how can they make saying Donnis ain't the illest where even the hottest niggas consider the boy a menace

Decapitation vaccination Big John ain't no mental patient
Been on medication ever since the day I could talk
You want a sedative you can drink the blood from my heart
We magnificent glistening banging bitches while we christening
You kelters and helters we here to body you cowards
My occupations slaughtery for wack rappers who try and bother me
You not as hot as me, Big John it gotta be
Exceptional technical poison pumping through my ventricles
I'm fresh in 0-7 those battles pseudo-intellectuals
Y'all faggots get smashed quick, for rapping that wack shit
Chop with the hatchet throw it in the trunk of a black whip
You can't imagine my passion combined with rapping adaption
And with the comic book caption reads I'm the bombest kid rapping
I smack cliques with wack writs cause really they that bitch
Big John, Giancana stuff bricks in the mattress
Fuck with R.A and I'm leaving you backless

Brim of the hat to the nose piece the chicks on him
Some wild hoes, in wild style clothes
They download and videotape 'em like Al Po
The wild road facing the chair if the trial blow
That's with the best friends and the sounds Tical knows
Know that killers come with calm faces
Shakes and hugs ace with gloves
Hate from love the traits of thugs

Who the master in the rap game? Thorburn last name
Reigning smacking attacking ya brain aiming back with the flame
Attract pain and learn from the best murdering burning the rest
We ain't no GQ rappers like Pharrell or Kanye West
I'm an abomination, I'm bombing a nation's population
You just a chick with a dick without no operation
I'm barely eating badly beaten, beaten badly in the precinct
I'm the hardest that God ever gave the privilege of speaking
Frantically banning me, Rugged Man'll panicky that'd be fantasy
Loaded hammer he handing me blabber the bragger be
A man who'd be damned if he happily married with family
Splatter ya mammy mammary gland insane insanity anarchy
Swagger the rapper the biter biting his flattery
Beating buzzing you battery agony back to reality
Bring it back you deliver that pitiful pitter pat
Pull the trigger snitch hit a rat you wick-wick-wack

Lookin 4 Ya Jedi Remix,Big Boi,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
Hey, just touched down, been gone for awhile
Tryna find you, where are you now? I've been looking for you
Come through, get you, riding out, we'll do
Soon as I can find you, I've been looking for you
Hey, just touched down, been gone for awhile
Tryna find you, where are you now? I've been looking for you
Come through, get you, riding out, we'll do
Soon as I can find you, I've been looking for you

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Let me give you one to grow on
Me and you have been digging each other now for so long
Like an archaeologist looking for our bones
We used to do it to the slow songs
Then our hormones would mix up from the sweat
'Cause I feel it drip drop from my pecs to your chest
I send a text from the jet, just to get you slippery
Memories of you soaking wet
That's the only time I might slip
Then I slide between them thighs, she keeps it tight-lipped
Like a vice grip, it's so private
Mum's the word unless I'm knee deep inside it
Three's company not crowded, I get
Cake, eat it too and apple pie
Slices with the ice cream, icing, à la mode
She inspires and excites me now you know
[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
Hey, just touched down, been gone for awhile
Tryna find you, where are you now? I've been looking for you
Come through, get you, riding out, we'll do
Soon as I can find you, I've been looking for you
Hey, just touched down, been gone for awhile
Tryna find you, where are you now? I've been looking for you
Come through, get you, riding out, we'll do
Soon as I can find you, I've been looking for you

[Verse 2: André 3000]
(On some cool shit)
Well here's a revolutionary idea
Why don't we both stay home and if the doorbell goes ding-dong
We can act like we not here
Put them house coats on and take them right back off
As a result, like we work at Ikea
Test every piece of furniture to see if it is stable
You wanna take it out on me then do it on the table
Mmm! Blow to the head, it's fatal
Wait 'til, you get a load of me
I ain't joking, Dark Knight, Batman
And I'm poking that pussy-cat, woman
Poke-it-man, baby gon' push it back on me
Hoping that maybe you'll wake up in the morning
And forget about it all, I hate to see you sad
So if anybody call, tell 'em that you'll let em know
When we fall back to earth, go berserk, baby
[Bridge: Sleepy Brown]
(I've been looking for you)
Come on in, I've been looking for you
Baby, where you been? (Where you been?)
No more wasting time, let's gone and get it in, get it in
And I won't stop, don't stop, 'til I make that leg drop

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Yeah, they wanna follow in my footsteps
But I'mma go something like the Boogie Man, never forget that
You musta fell down and bumped your cranium
Been moving crowds, rock halls and stadiums
Maybe I'm one of the best you'll ever meet
The Greatest Show On Earth, B.I.G
And I'mma make you remember me
I stay colder than December, B
Mr. Freeze, only want to see her on her knees
Throat pregnancies, are at a all time high, keep it sci-fi, wi-fi
Always connected to muchacha, watch out bwoy
The time flies by as the Cadillac glides
It's the Return of the Jedi, niggas know better
Antwan and André together
Dungeon Family for the W, I-N
Like Khaled, all we do is win, win

Hey, just touched down, been gone for awhile
Tryna find you, where are you now? I've been looking for you
Come through, get you, riding out, we'll do
Soon as I can find you, I've been looking for you
Hey, just touched down, been gone for awhile
Tryna find you, where are you now? I've been looking for you
Come through, get you, riding out, we'll do
Soon as I can find you, I've been looking for you
[Verse 4: André 3000]
I-I-I be on it, in and out it, in and out it
In and out it, in and out it, went about it
Like I owned it, dog it
Gone it, dog and pony show
Said my name repeatedly, repeated me
Like Tony Toni Toné, Tony, Tony
I know, I know, I know I said two too many Tony's
I go, I go, I go, I’m not usually a morning
Person, but certain skirts can makes me
Pull back the curtain and let the sun burst in
She searching for her Ken, Barbie
Her skin makes my Berlin Wall fall down
To the ground, now touché, hardly
A one night stand, number on nightstand
She ain’t gon’ never leave me hanging like an old white man
But she don’t understand that I’m a fan of Steely Dan
And she like everything that’s on the radio and I demand she change it"
Shouldve Been a Cowboy,Toby Keith,['country'],"[Verse 1]
I bet you have never heard ol' Marshal Dillon say
""Miss Kitty, have you ever thought of running away
Settling down, would you marry me
If I asked you twice and begged you pretty please?""
She'd have said yes in a New York minute
They never tied the knot, his heart wasn't in it
He just stole a kiss as he rode away
He never hung his hat up
At Kitty's place

[Chorus]
I should've been a cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
Wearing my six-shooter, riding my pony on a cattle drive
Stealing the young girls' hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singing those campfire songs
Oh, I should've been a cowboy

[Verse 2]
I might've had a sidekick with a funny name
Running wild through the hills chasing Jesse James
Ending up on the brink of danger
Riding shotgun for the Texas Rangers
Go west, young man, haven't you been told
California's full of whiskey, women and gold
Sleeping out all night beneath the desert stars
With a dream in my eye, and a prayer in my heart
[Chorus]
I should've been a cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
Wearing my six-shooter, riding my pony on a cattle drive
Stealing the young girls' hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singing those campfire songs
Oh, I should have been a cowboy

[Chorus]
I should've been a cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
I'd be wearing my six-shooter, riding my pony on a cattle drive
Stealing the young girls' hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singing those campfire songs
Oh, I should have been a cowboy

Yeah, I should've been a cowboy
I should have been a cowboy"
Jay 50 and Weezy,Dee-1,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Yea, so picture I had this dream right
That I walked into this office building
And the receptionist came downstairs and said:
”Dee-1, your party is ready upstairs.”
So I hop off the elevator, and I see Jay-Z, 50 Cent, and Lil Wayne
Sitting at a round table

I hope they hear meeeeee!

[Verse 1]
What up Jay, what up Fif, what up Weezy, I’m Dee
I ’preciate yall for having this conversation with me
I know that I’m the brokest person in the room yo
But money don’t matter here, because I’m rich with ideas (Ooo!)
First off, I grew up listening to all of yall
From Tha Block is Hot to Get Rich to Blueprint, I bought it all
I paid twenty for Tha Block is Hot at Peaches, Wayne
And Hov I bought Volume 2 because I loved ""Money Ain’t a Thang""
Fif, you had it locked in high school, huh
You’re the reason I stopped buying Ja Rule
But I graduated from that train of thought
So that’s why I’m here today, not to fuss but to talk
Here we go, look
[Verse 2]
50: You’re a marketing genius and you’re stupid rich
Let’s come up with a scheme and give the game a super fix
I seen you slaughter the careers of other men
But they were all brothermen, so that’s just another win
For the other team, entertainment is what it seems
But black on black hatred is the underlying theme
Paid, powerful, and popular, you got it all
Use that to fight the real enemy and make em fall
Other rappers might not understand, but so what
The game probably got em bending over doing a toe touch; it’s raping em!
So Fif, I know you got a heart, homie I don’t doubt you
But trust, the movement gon' move on with or without you

[Verse 3]
Lil Weezy, flow off the heezy
But we don’t feel your presence down in the Big Easy
Shouting out New Orleans at the Grammys, that’s cool
But how bout donating some cash money to help the schools
Wealth is cool, but not if you’re a selfish dude
(""Get at him Dee!"") Nah, let’s help this dude
Every statement that I yell is true
So take heed to it Weezy, this ain’t coming from no jealous dude
I know you’re smart son, you went to McMain
Now everything you say and do got kids trying to be Wayne
Friend or foe, it all depends on how you manage your talents
So what you gon do: Step up or step down from the challenge
[Verse 4]
(Hov!) Young Hov, Jigga, H to the Izzo
It’s truly an honor for me to meet you my nizzle
It’s impossible to belittle your impact on the game
You got the hottest chick in the world wearing your wedding ring (That’s right.)
You know most of these lil rappers are wack
They spitting poison, they hurting the culture, they’re holding us back
But I’m trying to see how you feel, cause when you speak, people listen
Do you agree with me, disagree, or you feel indifferent
With all that you done sold, now you can afford to be
Lyrically, Talib Kweli
But truthfully you ain’t gotta rhyme like Common Sense
Just be down for the cause and don’t ride the fence, ya heard

[Interlude]
Eh man, but hold up, while I got yall here right fast
Let me umm, let me look through my notebook
Cause see I was writing a rap about this same topic
I just didn’t know yall was gonna show up to the meeting to day ya know
I know, I know yall busy. Hold up, hold up Wayne, hold up
But uhh, let me just, cause I’m still unsigned
So let me at least rap this for yall
Eh, but my stuff’s on iTunes tho… Alright here we go…

[Verse 5]
Picture this, we got the blind leading the blind
Man, how stupid can we get, I just couldn’t let it slide this time
Besides, my people need this
And I ain’t on a major label, so they can’t delete this
Ha, let’s go in:
Now every rapper needs to lose their deals and earn em back
Most of em done let the industry take em and turn em wack
I be spitting from the soul, so they feel ya boy
I want your EAR and your HEART, like Amelia, boy
Stop Snitching. That’s the dumbest thing I ever heard of
That’s why nobody spoke up when my dawg got murdered
Everybody trying to stay true to the rules
Forget the rules if the rules was devised by fools
Most rappers is puppets, that can’t be avoided
Being used for their stupidity, then getting exploited
By a man with a different color skin
But homie we grown men, so that’s why I blame us and them
Me and you, we’re David; the industry’s Goliath
I’m here to fight it, & all that trash, I don’t buy it
When I was lost, I used to look up to these cats
Now I pray for these cats,; How you love that
A young, dumb, desperate, money hungry rapper
First a label sees him, then they go in for the capture
Precisely what they’re after, another pawn
Talking bout the people you killed, pop pop pop pop… Hold on
They also like it when you talk about your drugs
How much you sell em for 18.5, oh that’s what’s up
I’m trying not to point, but I hope you get the point
These cats ain’t running the game right, I’ma get the point
Fight him, battle him, the media stay instigating
To us it’s real beef, to them it’s instant ratings
Then when somebody get shot, it’s such a problem
That same media’s now saying we should stop the violence
Ancestors of ours are screaming from the grave
Cause physically we’re free, but we’re still some mental slaves
Ancestors of ours are screaming from the grave
Cause physically we’re free, but we’re still some mental slaves
So what yall think?"
If I Was Santa Claus,Atmosphere,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Slug]
If I was a rich man, I'd buy you some shoes
Tall boots for all the dirt you walk through
What would that do? Enable you to deal
Without schooling you on how to touch what's real
And if I was a smart man, I'd tell you everything that I knew
And give it to you every time you need a talking to
But what would that do? Teach you my guidelines
So you can be a cheerleader at your game on the sidelines
And if I was a driver, I'd keep my headlights on
To see the difference between right and wrong
I'd wear my seatbelt even when I'm in park
Cause I don't trust the other fools that cruise through these parts
And if I was a better cook, I'd hook up a feast
Set a table full of food for the children to eat
I encourage the nourishment so we can breathe
With the knowledge that we got something accomplished

[Hook]
And if I was Santa Claus, I'd fight for the cause
Wouldn't expect nothing in return
I'd give you everything you want, I'd be everything you need
So you can take my hand and I can take the lead
And if I was an honest man
I would stop writing songs
I'd break for a nervous breakdown for breakfast
Tell everyone I knew to stay away from making music
It ain't nothing but a confusing mess (confusing mess)
And if I was you, I wouldn't hear a word I said
Wouldn't trust nothing to start it up inside my head
I'd make a conscious effort to live instead
Of trying to kill the monsters that reside underneath the bed
And if I was a hurt man
I'd find a way to put my faith
Into a woman that could take me from today, maybe
I need somebody that could save me
From the parts of myself that keep making me crazy
And if I was a wise man
I'd climb to the top of the mountain peak
To think about strength versus weakness
I'd find a point that rests a couple of feet above your head
And figure out how I could try to help you reach it
(Ho ho ho)
And if I did have a choice
I'd never want to live forever
Just let me have a voice so I can make my points
I can't imagine running a race with no finish line
Just let me keep my pace and make to most of my time
I love giving but I'm bad at receiving
The truth is, I'd prefer to be the one bleeding
But I'm a paranoid that stays between play and work
Cautious and aware, cause I'm afraid of being hurt
Which brings me to the issue
And that would be this:
How often must I ask myself why I exist?
I feel like a freak, this world is a circus
Just trying to find myself as well as my purpose
[Hook: repeat 2X]
And if I was Santa Claus, I'd fight for the cause
Wouldn't expect nothing in return
I'd give you everything you want, I'd be everything you need
And you can take my hand and I can take the lead

I got nothing but gifts
Keep it up in my wits
Got me drunk on the fifth
And now we're stuck in a ditch
And as dumb as it gets
I'mma run you some fibs
I wanna touch your lips
I wanna rub your hips
Put a glove on the fist
For the love that exists
We'll keep bumping the hits
To get my bucket of chips
From the Bloods and the Crips
To the skateboarding chicks
Put the Atmosphere on your Christmas wishlist
Put the Atmosphere on your Christmas wishlist

Moment for Life,King Los,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Los]

I go super hard
Nothing less than devoted
I put knowledge in every bar
Take a second and note it
I know that things ain't what they seem
It’s like blessings is coded
I knew this would be my moment for life the second I wrote it
And yea I struggled every day, I got used to the hope
Playing tug-of-war with the world, I was losing my rope
But contrary to what haters would usually hope
When you talk about me now, tell them I used to be broke
Bad for your health with a raw flow
Niggas can’t mention rap in my presence
Unless you’re an elf in the North Pole
You don’t get that, you so unprepared
Snap back flow, adjust to me being over your head
Damn! I’m bigger, stronger and faster than them
Put my life behind bars, that’s how I mastered the pen
Ten, nine eight, seven six five four three, two one
Motherfucker it’s my time
I could write it in the script and sell it
This kind of story many niggas don’t live to tell it
I put my life in this sentence, like a convicted felon
Victory is mine, climb a mountain raise my fists and yell it
I wish that I could have this moment a bit longer
In the midst of the moment, the momentum get stronger
But shit hunger, make friends switch to opponents
Then take the tone of a bitch on ya
Keep your chrome on your hip
When you boning them chicks, homie
They be blowing your cut, man these hoes is a bit phony
I move out like O’s in the drought
The day I trick on a bitch you see snow in the south
Way back when I had the goals in my mouth
Nigga I was pimping like Jerome in the house
Thinking back to my Martin years
Now the Aston Martin doors open like Martin’s ears
White top black shoes on the drop
Martin got it looking like a skin head and some Doc Martens
It all started with a dream like Doc Martin, Luther King
Do your thing nigga stop talking
Back when they dropped the dirt on my pop's coffin
Left a hard spot on my heart that will not soften
I’m lost in this beautiful thing
So even in my nightmares I’m still pursuing my dreams
Got the shooter on the roof, clear view to king
They tell me bring the crown back and make the funeral clean
It’s no chance for the bow, I romance with the war
And these niggas too clean to slow dance with the poor
Ten seconds on the clock, I take a glance at the score
We down by two so I advance with the ball
Too fast for your forward no need to rewind
I shake him out his 2 shoes, I got this 3 on my mind
4 seconds left, and it’s like 5 niggas pressing me
I need 6 rings like Jordan in my legacy
7 niggas on the bench watching me in slow mo
I ate (8) the press up too easy, no homo
Straight down the middle to the top of the line
And pulled that motherfucker back like I was cocking a 9
And let it fly they thinking ‘Los did it again’
Damn ya’ll niggas need heart, I’m the wizard you tin (10) man
It take 10 men to get the heart of this one man
Cuz no ten men would go as hard as this one man
Damn, who would’ve thought that I was this thorough
Put a ribbon on the moon, my gift out this world nigga"

I'm try- I'm looking for the missing note

[Verse 1: Jay Electronica]
As I scratch the last days off the calendar
Niggas roam the streets with heavy metal like Metallica
Pistols with the silencers, killing soldiers softly
The crime pays a little but the consequence is costly
My cousin, I love him, we go back in the days
But now he struggle with the monkey and he trapped in a maze
I still care for him, to tell the truth I'm kinda scared for him
Cause when he conscious, he in rare form
But that's the story of his life, getting locked up or shot up
Or in somebody's kitchen on the block cooking rocks up
I think he lost hope when he seen them lock his pops up
Or when he seen his sister babyfather get his knot bust
My grandmother complain and tell him make a change
But her thinking is outdated she can't understand the game
Syeah, hard time three to nine in a jailhouse
Is no different from slaving nine to five in a warehouse
[Hook]
There's a lot of shit going on up in my hood
I thank God I'm alive, homey knock on wood
Yea though I walk through the valley of death
I know the lord got my back with every step
You see nothing here surprises me
I got a whole lotta soldiers down to ride with me
But lord please give me, something to hold on to
Something to hold, I need something to hold

[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
Yo in the projects shit is mad real for the youth
Niggas get ill for the loot
The more guns ya bust, the realer your crew
Cats carry gats concealed in they suits
Whether cee-loo craps or Macs gorillas may shoot
When the eyes meet don't steer wrong and don't stare long
Cause niggas'll kill for that, when they be full of heroin
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How crews remain standing once the AK's thunder
Under the slum roof tops, career thugs cook rocks, then hit the blocks
To make a killing plus fame, man, they loving this game
It's mega action; the trees stay hot like saunas
Shorties with fly hair-dos get dipped to play the corner
Summer time they shine block parties galore
So many soldiers die, they buy a separate forty to pour
I knew this kid Larry; niggas thought he was poor
But he had cream for days, ran a solid scheme with K's
AKs with the banana clips, rubber handle grips
The same nigga that got Randal hit, he living scandalous
He used to pop no-doz so he won't be caught sleeping
And he couldn't even walk around the block cause he was beefing
I say that to say this, that's ghetto everyday shit
Where slugs miss chipped bricks leave scars on chicks
It's kinda trife right now, but that's the life right now
And way back it was a half-assed trife like now
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Electronica]
Peace god what's today's math, just trying to escape wrath;
With two left feet, it's kinda hard to walk a straight path
Soldiers laying in gutters from God to greed
My old dad left momdukes and scarred his seed
We all family, but seemingly these cats can't stand me
Haters gonna hate be it a Lexus or a Camry, understand me
But do the knowledge first, swallow my verse
Which is my universe, God obeys no thirst
Fallen angels in the ghetto trading in they wings for things
Semiautomatic machines with red beams
Street magicians converting the crack into cream
Sat back saw 'em turn Black Zack to a fiend
He's a teacher, had a fly daughter named Lakeisha
If you hustle, have a beeper, smoke reefer, you can freak her
I seen her giving head inside the club behind the speaker
Last year she had three abortions for the preacher
And one miscarriage for this kid they call Harris
He told her that her loved her and he's moving her to Paris
She fell for it
Touched the third rail for it (uh)
And next year she would've been sixteen
Once told me that she wanted to go to God, get clean
So she could be a role model for her brother Eugene
He's a beautiful seed, eight years and can't read
At night, his asthma so bad he can't breathe
He wants to be an astronaut, and fly to space
But his teacher told him that he just ain't go what it takes
So he cried while the other kids played at lunch break
What will it take to raise our mind-state?

Cash and carry, legendary, Sagitarri, style's vary
And it's very necessary get it clearly
Never scary barely worried bright and early
Bald head straight or curly mundane or other worldly
No chain, nada jewelry that jackers can't snatch
The gingerbread the slave masters can't catch
Blat! Now put your minds on that
Get real or get back quit frontin face facts
The old timers say we're living in the final days
Gun smoke young folks living any kind of way
Gangster holiday greedy snakes and hideaways
Meanwhile soldiers take it straight through their armor plates
Crash hit the market gates marvels of the modern age
Access is instant and treachery is commonplace
I sense the dangers and I'm not afraid
Because when all is said and done there's only ONE
Man up playboy playing the game boy
Pull back spectacular aim boy
Say what you say boy whoever could make noise
And ride range off in the same voice
Conduct an arrangement with definite language
It's pure inspiration for this generation
Speak true free love
Because when all is said and done there's only ONE

And the one can done so cool
Schooling the young like Rev. Run (""whose house?"")
Quote Pac and tell 'em keep their heads up
And when the pressure comes down press back and press up

Palm trees, and bomb pre-rolled
The weed burning, but the money just fold
While I'm looking at you niggas face
Light another L, and pull the liquor out the case
Niggas try and fail, see me, now they wanna hate

But I take all I got
And that's what I give
What I get in return
Is the money I earn
And the life I live
I'm so gone
As I burn after rolling
And float on..."

Freeze! Motherfucker, I'm ill, fuck a fuckin' deal
Spit it how I feel, cooking up a meal
Before I make a mil', I'm a take a pill
Red pill, blue pill, tell me how you feel
(Motherfucker, I'm ill) Never lost in the sauce
Paid the cost to be the boss
(Motherfucker, I'm ill) For real, cold as a ice box
I get it in every day like white socks
And I'm on the come-up like the right stock
And I eat MCs like livestock
So when the heat on, mufucka I chill
You know why? Cause (motherfucker, I'm ill)
So please pay attention to the moves made
Either that or fall off like a toupee
Or something like the end of a new day
Cause life's a gamble, Russian roulette
If you got the juice, please don't spill
But I'm good (Motherfucker, I'm ill)
Keep on tracks I kill, me a murderer?

And this shit right here, call it history
Make the king disappear, officially

Sheesh, for real, smell me? (Motherfucker I'm ill)
Who am I to say they don't smell what they smell, B?
Grace like Kelly, taste like jelly
Laced like Melly Mel, oh welly-well
It's shelly-toed, spaghetti ropes, Anne Geddes green smokes
Plus smoke gross curry, my celly blows up frequently
But I don't hurry cause (Motherfucker I'm ill)
Don't worry I got this
25 milli Double-A Hotchkiss
No-fly zone, the clouds is my home
I'm grown, I like to do things on my own terms
See me with worms and rhizomes
Hecka psychotropical, cop a view
How that rockin' you, by the way? (Motherfucker I'm ill)
I'd a rock you like a hurricane, I'm a scorpio, man, eh
(Motherfucker I'm ill)

And this spot look like the Foot Clan hideout
Kool A.D., Kass, Heems alone gettin' fried out
We ride out, slide out, white out with the cousins, nice
One take wasn't enough, now we buzzin' like twice
No conundrum, your bars straight hum-drum
Young Cocoa Butter, something like an old tum-tum
A blocka blocka like Grandfather Mori Tanaka

Always get the pussy cause I tell 'em that I'm Spanish

How dare you question his trends?

[Verse 1]
So
In the beginning there was hum
From a poet whose pulse fell
Drum drum drum!

He would perform prayers and all
Till one day he heard a voice call
Come come come!

Suspicious he moved with vicious caution
Dismisses, he thinks it's a little off

People get held back
By the voice inside them

Yo
The voice said I'm poised to speak inside you
Rejoice and please let me invite you
To evil, greed and lies too
Yeah
Confused and dazed he moved in ways he soon became a kunni
Boom boom boom
And knock on his door his heart is no more
And knock on his door his soul is no more

Yeah
That was in the beginning
As the story goes on

[Verse 2]
So
The poet's got a proposal
He would always hope but never know
What it feels to be free

He would be the frozen imposed as the chosen
All laws oppose him
But it would be greed
That's got him there
He's power hungry and proud too

People don't care, people just scared
People don't care, people just prayer

Yeah
That was in the beginning
There was a hum
And things change
[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Say
It's better to light a candle than to curse the dark
In the eyes of the youth there are question marks
Like freedom
Freedom for the mind and soul
We don't see them
See them for their worth at all
That's why we lead them
Lead them to these wars and what is it we feed them
Feed them our impurities and who it is we treat them
Treat them like the enemy humanity will need them
Need them like the blood we spill and we're freedom

Freedom for the hearts we fill
Mislead them
They hunger for the love we give
But we cheat them

The cops beat them when all he wants is his freedom
So they defeat them
Whatever spirit he's got
Beat him!

And they teach them that the rest of the world don't need him
And he believes it's a disease that he's heathen
Put up your fists if all you want is freedom
Put up your fists if all you want is -
That was in the beginning
And things change

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah -
And we keep holding on
And we keep being strong
And we keep going on
And on and on and on

And we keep holding on
And we keep being strong
And we keep going on
And on and on and on

Ain't nothing changed but the weather
And the temp tag sequence of numbers and letters on my Chevelle
You can ride, but hey man, watch my leather
Cause bitches get ejected in traffic from disrespecting a classic
Rosé in the glasses, get the weed out the plastic
Spitta and them Monsta Beatz radioactive
I don't kick it with no rappers, they be hustling backwards
Like the jeans on Kris Cross, who you Mack Daddy or daddy macking?
Pen lyrics on back on these napkins zoned out in a first class cabin
With noise cancellation headphones, two hash brownies for breakfast
This morning staring down at the ocean, inspired
Scribbling fire, on a streetcar named desire
Straddle a fence you only get caught up in the barbed-wire
I'm independent, fuck your system I get paid without it
Got a new pothead bitch who moonlighting as a blogger
That rapper weed she smoke, that Spitta stroke, she wrote about it
You can't deny it, I'm a rider, word to Pac ambition
Houdini your main squeeze, she disappear she's a magician
You can't blame in the midst of the fame planes get changed
I sent her to the waffle house twit my order from the car man, yeah

And I'm looking famous
And you can tell by the reaction of them strangers
From distance tryna figure if it is or if it ain't him
The reals say I'm on it, the haters say I ain’t shit, but I'm still

[Verse 2]
I'm high again waiting on the sun
Dozed off in my '57 at the drive-in
This is a scary movie I'm in
But I do it for my folk who genuinely want me to win
I do a lotta smoking to stay over this bogus shit
My money and not on these bitches, my focus is locked
Niggas claiming to be jet planes but they not
Pay homage, the founder in the house kid
A MILF hunter, ask your momma she could vouch bitch
If she cool to fuck and down with rolling that barney up
Race-day money on the starting gate pony up
Hope you're hungry, I got a plate of dust for ya homie, look up
Early morning exercise doing kush ups
I ain't stingy with it, got a couple pounds put up
Bitches used to overlook us, now in my presence they shook up
See where this rap shit done took us? I'm still, still.."

Don't have to ask, don't have to beg

Let's call the boys, let's run a train
Squeeze on my nuts, lick on my butt
The natural curly hair, please, don't touch
First find a mate, second find a place
Third find a bag, to hide the ho face
Real name Rover, I said bend over
I started to knock, then came the odor
Smelled like mush, should've had a woosh
Told her to stop and take a douche
While she did that, I didn't want the cat
So I bounced out and never came back

My nigga D-Magic said he had to have it
I said, ""Just forget it, it's too crabby""
Know a little freak, in Hollywood
Sucks on dick, does it real good
She'll give you money, fill up your tummy
House full of kids, parents all schummy
Once had a down, backyard ground
Hit it from the back, enjoy the sound
Lay on the cover, always use the rubber
Till I got caught, fucking with her mother
She blamed it on me, we fought in the street
She pulled out a knife, so I had to flee
Called up the boys, went to her house
Charged the whole place, threw the bitch out
Police busted in, where the niggas at
We left just in time, and never came back
Roll through the hood, waving at the freaks
Who's sniffing all the rocks, and smoking all the geeks?
Made another stop, police station
Saw a few cops, drove by and sprayed them
License tag number, a nigga said he saw...

[Snoop Dogg]
It all goes back, to '85
When I start gettin pussy every day of my life
It really didn't matter what the bitch look like
I remember one night, after the Sugar Ray fight
Wouldn't you believe it, Dogg like a retriever
I went up in this big fat bitch named Treva
She had a best friend with titties named Vanessa
She told me to undress her, yessir
Ain't no pressure, later that semester
She put me down with her homegirl name Tanisha
She was so vicious, lips so luscious
Suck a nigga dick and have it shinin like some dishes
Patricia, Patricia, she love the way I stick her
I take her to the movies and now, she eat the dick up
Big bucks, no whammies
I had to meet this white bitch, her name was Tammy
She lived in the Valley, she couldn't understand me
But she let me dig out, her homegirl named Brandi
Now Brandi was a cute little thick bitch
She moved to the hood from the 2-0-6
She brought some new tricks, flippin them squirrels
And the pearls, and turnin out the neighborhood little girls
Hmm, and I seen that, so I peep the game
So I put her down, bottom bitch on my team
And we began makin, breakin bitches takin
Whatever we want, see she want with the fakin
It's real in the field, no mistakin
And crack the little bitch, yeah she Jamaican
Time and time again she would bring me bud
And let me beat it up, listenin to ""One Love""
Off some jerk chicken, I got mo' bitches
Now I'm fuckin her sister it's gettin real suspicious
But the dick is good, so they won't tell
And now they next door neighbor, Clarissa Bell
She been lookin at me, I think she wanna hit
But I'mma holla back, cause I'm on another bitch
I'm on some other shit, I got a phone call
From the motherfuckin president y'all
He said, ""Snoop Dogg, how could I fuck a bitch
And make her suck a dick and not get caught for the fuck of it?""
I called and look here, this what you do
Make the First Lady sell a little pussy for you
I think he got it, cause he left fast
He left his daughters, and a lot of cash
Well what do ya know, D-O-double-G
Major pimpin, out in D.C
And I'm a young pimp, got a lot of growin left
And you's a young ho with a lot of hoein left
Always keep a ho in check, blowin us a train wreck
Yeah I might have to go in depth
See every little ho I met
They're standouts, you know the ones like Yvette
We fucked in the car, behind a bar
I shot it in her face and it went ""Ahhh""
My homeboy Charles
Went up in his sister, behind the garage
I was menace, I was freaky, I was sick
When y'all was tryin to hump, I was teachin them to suck dick
Always tryin to go up in a ho
Got caught tryin to fuck in school they asked me what I did it fo'
You know just what I told her?
I love pussy, and this dick is what I showed her
And now they threw me out, now I'm at the pad
I'm at a new school, way cool
New hoes, new script, fresh fish
Walk up in the room and I bust a new bitch
I'm in some new tail, wanna holla back
But for now let me holla back Impala black
She's a 12th grader, in my science class
And I done seen the pussy, yeah boy I'm movin fast
See I was taught by, and I was taught I
Better move on somethin fast if I thought I
Could claim a dame, or game her brain
Or tame a man, not with the same old game
See on some different stuff, I'm a different cut
It's what I say and do to make the bitch give it up
Oh you wanna brag? I wanna brag too
Now what you gon' do, when they ask you
Is you gon' tell a lie, or you gon' keep it G
Or you gon' hold it all inside or you gon' tell on me?
Shit it's all cool, cause it was all good
It's just another day in Doggy Dogg's neighborhood
You better watch your girl, cause if she on the loose
It's a 90 percent chance she gon' get pimp juice
Now what it do, what it is
Now you livin with that ho and y'all got fo' kids

Hard for a Pitchfork, soft for a Roc-a-Fella
Music was my side chick, but now we’re moving in together
Always felt misunderstood, I guess I have to tolerate
My swag Jehovah Witness, dude, it never take a holiday
APC jeans, brown leather jacket on
Kitsuné cable knit, cardigan from Rag & Bone
Thick Filipino chick, homemade bracelet
Her booty make her just a rapper, she ain’t gotta say shit
I’m someone they admire
Set the game ablaze, I’m an arcade fire
Laughed at my rise like my motion was funny
Yes, ashy to classy, my lotion is money
The ride is easy when the dollar’s there to grease the wheels
Now everybody tell me what to do and how to feel
It seems the more I try to connect with the world
I am feeling more alone than I ever have felt before
I wanna pick up the phone, ask my dad how to handle it
But what will happen when my dad’s not there to answer it?
I try to clear my mind of thoughts that only slow me down
Like when these niggas called me ""faggot"" and we homies now
But we are not homies, I just keep you around
‘Cause all your talkin’ is the noise I need to kill the sound
Of all these voices tellin’ me no one can help me out
We are alone, I’m just the only one to figure out

The feeling I got from you
No, somewhere inside, I cannot find
The feeling I got from you, oh

""You are the bestest, I will obey you""
These words I wrote for you when you were fuckin’ other dudes
The only thing I need from you now is some solitude
Actions over words, ""girls will be girls,"" that’s all it proves
I used to be this guy sittin’ with an open heart
Now my computer screen’s the only place I feel a spark
I don’t fuck with fake bitches
Except for when I fuck with fake bitches
Canon 5D to take pictures
Of these girls who wouldn’t talk to me a year ago
49er chick askin’ for money, she get zero, though
Here I go again, talkin’ money, women and clothes and cars, right?
You could switch all of my words out with Plies’, right?
People sayin’ we’re the same, please, come from under me
We are just some rappers, got no luxury of subtlety
No subjects when we’re rappin’, we say it like we hear it
I put it on a track and I hope you get the spirit ‘cause

I don’t wanna be alone, I don’t wanna be alone
I don’t wanna be alone
I don’t wanna be alone, I don’t wanna be alone

It's so real how I feel
Cause this society, that makes a nigga wanna kill

While the government is soundin' like strippers to me
They keep sayin', but I don't wanna hear it

When you think of Harvey, think of a Harley
Blue denim, spiked wrists and 'Crombie
Slap-screws and tattoos, that's all me
Two blondes, both arms, feelin' like Fonzie
You can find me drunk, whippin' it might crash
Or find me chillin' with crackers who like thrash
Find me in court, smokin' that nice grass
Burnin' the flag, all in the name of white trash
It's Harvey baby, Christ on the arm, I'm gnarly, baby
Fuck with me? Not hardly, baby
And you know the flow ungodly, baby
So let's party, baby
Chicks nickname me Pilot, they get high off my dick
I take 'em to my home, they call it the cockpit
Time for take off, the panties they drop quick
Now that's first class fuckin', ain't that some fly shit?

In the fourth grade I had a crush on Tia Smith
Sixth grade and this crush is turned to Beatrice
But they don’t like me because I’m too nice
And I’m kinda fat and not the dope type

But I grew out of that and it’s a miracle
Now every girl sees me as marryin’ material
It’s a buyer’s market, I’m Alicia’s target
And every other girl who wanna let me steam their carpet

I love these hipster girls and they feel the same
Now they don’t have to choose when someone asks ‘em Drake or Wayne
And niggas waiting on me, we didn’t have a voice
You used to have to act street and now you’ve got a choice

My momma’s brownie mix, I keep the goodies moist
Of every girl I’m tappin’, this wasn’t supposed to happen
Hard to keep my thoughts straight on every date
Especially when my penis talking SWAT team, cover me, I’m going in
I do not talk, I am just a rapper

Yes, I got a million other girls
You don’t wanna hear that for fear that I fuck a lot
And you don’t wanna get attached cause you’ll like me
I fuck a girl named Keira nightly
Nah, I made her up
‘Cause it sounded dope, I don’t give a fuck
Ride me, giddy up
They can hear us in the hall, Arsenio
Naw, girl, I don’t wanna shoot a video
I do it all day, don’t you watch me on the TV show?
I’m gonna get mines any means necessary
Got Red Bull pulsing through my pulmonary
Least I feel like it, met her at a club
Now we’re making out, and I ain’t spend a dub
I’m gonna try to live it up like TOP FLR
And my girls like gifts so I bought more

All girls 18 and over love this light-skinned Casanova
House pimped out, William Sonoma
Sleep on me, that is a coma

Yeah, nigga, you see what I’m gettin’ at
I’m gettin’ at her, I’m hittin’ that
Her kitty cat purr, how weird is that?
I’m diggin’ that
A nigga not tryin’ to say you don’t make mistakes
I’m trying to fix all the hearts I break
But every time that we talk in my apartment
We’re gonna kiss a little, and then we start shit

“You’re heartless, don’t call again
Don’t email, we can’t be friends
I swear that this is the end”
Then I call her next week and we do it again

My girls, my girls, my girls, my girls
My girls, my girls, my girls, my girls
My girls, my girls, my girls, my girls
My girls, my girls, my girls, my girls

Addicted to making money like crackheads with crackhits

The genie's out the bottle now, I'm finally summoned and
See the wishes leave 'em cease to exist
If y'all can't see through the mist, it leaves 'em easily pissed
But this, m**herf**ker got his high beams on

And yeah, say no other man made me boy
I ain't lazy boy but feet UP in a lazy boy
Say it's comfy where I'm at in my humble abode
Just can't wait, till I call the top home sweet home
I'm talking practical, tactical, rappin' fast or slow
Tellin' y'all that I ain't slowing down till the casket closed
Batting average low, rappers gettin' outed
Fit with cumulus minds, judgement gettin' clouded
Say you're in the game don't know a single thing about it
If rap has lost connection I'm the man to re-route it
Waking up the game, Foghorn Leghorn
Beggars can't be choosers, tell me what I got to beg for?
Got everything I need, artillery packed
Middle finger, thumb together, I'm just waiting to snap
I be the answer, talking practice? I heard it
Tell me why I got to practice if I'm practically perfect

And my rapping? Is on a whole 'nother different dimension
We cut the rappers' extension for rappers to lose connection
Get disconnected, infected, rejected, injected with toxins

Integrate the past and present to obliterate shit
I'm givin' the feelin' the people be feelin'; the realest around
Seekin' the thrill of revealin' the sound, soon to be liftin' me off of the ground
Okay, remember hearing you should give what you receive
So I get nothing in return, I'm givin' just to breathe
Livin' just to sleep in a dream with no boundaries
That's why I get defensive when reality surrounding me

First verse go's out to the girls, be proud of yourself
But don't just take pride in your outer shell
They take mens advances for granted
Cause it's common that we bother them
Thats why so many young women can't take a compliment
You'd probably get put off if I called you
And probably get turned on if I ignored you
Make up caked up to cover up whats under there
All your facebook friends see pics of you in your underwear
He treats you like a princess, your not impressed
The truth is you'd probably like him more if he did less
You change the colour of your hair and the colour of your eyes

And tell you what the motive behind it is cause it's not sex
Most people at some point got their heart broke
Misery loves company some people just can't cope
A man that hops beds cause he's scared to sleep alone
Is the same as a loose women that can't keep 'em closed
Your both in the same boat, this is what you need to know
A man gets called a player, as for the woman she's a ho
The truth is they both are insecure people trying to mend their broke hearts
If you brag that you've slept with thousands of girls
All that tells me is that you don't value yourself

You wonder too ’cause you keep on trying and they keep ignoring

And then you kissed her goodbye and she could barely take it
Right then, you realized that you might never get the chance again
And so you made a promise, riding on that plane

I see the big picture, I know
On everythin' I love, I'm the shit and I know
To do it big, I gotta keep 'em out my business, I know
Because these niggas like to gossip like the bitches I know
I finally get it now, I see the big picture I know
On everythin' I love, I'm the shit and I know
I run this city, wish they was in my position I know
These niggas softer than the pussies than the bitches I know
I know, I know

[Verse 3]
I'm clearly somethin' special, officially I'm the best who
Did it in my city and even in the U.S, you
Must agree, they can't fuck with me, I'm a beast unless you
Hatin, you ain't gotta be sneezin' for me to bless you
If the records don't hit you, I bet the movie'll get you
If Akoo don't seem to catch your attention, I'm a impress you
With swagger long term, Hollywood bitches to tag along
Groupies just imagine on, they know what I'm braggin' on
I got a message you can pass along, tell a friend
We gettin long paper Jay, we made it back from Hell again
Been knockin' on Heaven's door, residin' there forever more
Promoters, this worth every cent, you couldn't buy a better tour
And you are forced to admire the Messiah
Expressin' your desire, you're just preachin' to the choir
The nation has inquired to hear your majesty, sire
I'm flyin' high up one mornin' and
[Refrain]
Hey, it dawned on me and
I see the big picture, I know
On everythin' I love, I'm the shit and I know
To do it big, I gotta keep 'em out my business, I know
Because these niggas like to gossip like the bitches I know
I finally get it now, I see the big picture I know
On everythin' I love, I'm the shit and I know

West Side LA,Chet Hanx,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Just another day in West Side LA
But it's Cali love baby, from the south to the Bay
Southern California, that's where I stay
Raised in Santa Monica, pacific Palisades
On the west side of town
That where they know me round
It's where we smoke trees and breezies get down
It's where it's so easy to burn bleezies
And when you see the homies, please G
Give 'em a pound

Yeah
Yeah
Doing things my way
Blowing trees, driving down Pacific Coast Highway
Shit, why you think it's called the high-way?
Don't try to violate
I'm on some perfect DM shit
My day
Plain white Ts, Levi jeans, that's the bomb sneeze
Got a grip of medical in my hand, call that some palm trees
Speaking of palm trees, we pass em on Sunset
Harnt on the bluffs, rolling blunts, as the sun sets
It's a bet
Blackjack
Me play it at Merango
Pechanga
Indian casinos, then Benihana
Yo, girl, Amanda
What's her name, Tanya?
Russian girls love waking up to them mañana
Couldn't be West Los without the mexicans
Creeping on Latina females, they sexy, damn
And I gotta love them Southern Cali blonde chicks
They good girls, but quick to do some wrong shit
Pregaming with the gin and
Juice and tonic
Friday night, getting right, bumping the chronic
Nothing, but strong shit
Up in, my bong rip
Sunday was a good day
Like the Lakers beat the Supersonics
Shoutout to Ice Cube
Finishin' first, even though I'm a nice dude
Watch me take a puff, and do what I do best
Right, just another day on the motherfuckin' West Side
[HOOK]

It don't matter where you from
It don't matter where you goin'
It don't matter if you're flyin' coach, or ridin' Boeing, man
The greatest city in the world
Laid-back lifestyle, and the hottest girls
That's just my style, call me crazy
It's doesn't faze me
I'm steady getting Hazy
In the 310, or 323
The home of me
C-H-E-T

This is LA
We doin' things with ease
Warm desert sun, cool ocean breeze
So-Cal steeze, big trees, double Ds
Treatin' money like In-N-Out, double cheese
Cause my styles is like an animal
From here to Panama
My flow got too much stamina
Other MCs are just too amateur
So I damage 'em
In the booth with my homies and my manager
Flipping up the game like a spatula
Havin a
Good time, bumping Pac
I ain't mad at'cha
I ain't trying to boast
Just trying to represent to the fullest
The West Coast
Pale like a ghost
But let me propose a toast
To makin the most out of life, of course
If you ain't doing that, what you doing
Stacking dollar bills to the height of Patrick Ewing
Party in B-Hills
Girls in the back screwing
If you tryin' to start drama, let the drama keep brewin'
Cause even in the burbs, kids don't take jack
From the hatin' motherfucker talk back at your ball crack
Meanwhile, your girl's on my ballsack
She said she's falling for me
I told her, fall back
Ya mallrat, you ain't want all that
I'm singing in the song, but it's still all rap
Smokin in the Cali Haze
Cruising in the whip, ridin through the Pallisades
These are the best days, so I probably should sign
Trying to add Chet Haze to the Hollywood sign

Hopped off the whip to get the scoop
On this fly little thing that was lookin' cute
I shot my game at her and what do you know? (Wassup?)

Sober Up,Joe Budden,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Joe Budden - talking]
High on life (Joey)
J. Cardim, what up
Parks, what up
Dolla, what up
I think we got one with this one baby
Not really, I hate when niggas say shit like that (Joey)
Quick question though
Y'all in that mood yet?
Naw, naw they ain't hear me
(I said), y'all in that mood yet?

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
I broke down a while ago, finally picking up the pieces
Memoirs on how the undefeated, can feel depleted
I don't talk to God as a matter of fact I plead with
At times I hate my reflection and others I'm conceited
Half the time I'm arrogant, other times I'm vengeful
At times it's to convince me, at times it's to convince you
Done a lot of wrong but I ain't never felt resentful
It's been so many times, I lost track of who to repent to
Half the time I'm in the cut, don't want you to notice me
Grow with me and you'll see that I'm only awkward socially
Half the time I'm spiteful, double barrel rifle
I owe so many payback, I feel like I got a right to
So if you need a case in point, you can refer to Budden
And it'll prove the painkillers never murdered nothin
All it did was make me succumb, put ice in me, make me numb
When I revisit the places it takes me from, I'm sprung
[Hook: Joe Budden]
(I ain't tryin to sober up)
Strong enough to catch contact by
You smell it as soon as you get in my ride
(I don't wanna sober up)
See with me the rules never apply
Don't tell me how I should live my life
(I ain't tryin to sober up)
Put your seat back, got it if you need that
You should really fuck with me
(I ain't tryin to sober up)
Tell me if you wanna ride or die
La la la la la la la la

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Listen up as a sinner reports, my inner thoughts like an inner war
Headaches act as a tremblin force on my mental ward
Mental's distraught, every word from this sinister boss
Is brought to you by the people like your minister's Porsche
Tight ropin on dental floss, before the haters begin to get lost
Coke and weed got my temperament off
But why would my temper get lost, when as soon as the temperature frost
I'm probably havin intercourse in a resort
Criminal report, pricey condos at a minimal cost
My train of thought ain't as simple as yours
So if our paths happen to incidentally cross
I pray that you can overlook all my miniature flaws (ta ha)
Until then let's let the bass kick
Take a shot straight, I don't see a need to chase it
Tryin to fight the urge 'til there's somethin to replace it
I welcome y'all to be my co-pilots on this spaceship
[Hook: Joe Budden]
(I ain't tryin to sober up)
Strong enough to catch contact by
You smell it as soon as you get in my ride

Don't tell me how I should live my life

Put your seat back, got it if you need that
You should really fuck with me
(I ain't tryin to sober up)
Tell me if you wanna ride or die
La la la la la la la la

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Yo, me and the gang would get so blunted
We'd order take out from the Chinese stores
Say make sure you bring change for a hundred, rob him, safety on the metal's off
Figured if we beat the brakes off him
Then how the fuck was he gonna pedal off?
Some live and die by the high, I was born by it
Since Pop gave my mom the needle like go on, try it
Got me feeling like ain't a nigga could harm me
So I go and scoop a mami that wanna come join the army
She was so militant, disciplined, diligent
So I whispered to her ""bet you wouldn't mind chillin"" and
I got to know her on my sofa
I gave her my honorable discharge and she took it like a soldier
See she the type you gotta watch when she come around
Really she only get high, so she can come down
Lost her when I said she ain't gotta settle
Once you start ahead in life, you'll be on the same level, I bet you
[Hook: Joe Budden]
(I ain't tryin to sober up)
Strong enough to catch contact by
You smell it as soon as you get in my ride

Put your seat back, got it if you need that
You should really fuck with me

[Verse 4: Crooked I]
When I was five, this what my father said
""I should have pulled you out and left you on your mama's water bed""
You ask me, my papa's dead
Alcoholic genes from him since a toddler bottle fed
Put me in your stainless, I'm brainless, I'm a hollow head
(My life was the craziest), surprised I'm even walkin
Can you blame me if I'm (atheist)? But I ain't Stephen Hawkins
I know God is in my (radius), I can see him often
In the face of an innocent baby but not when preacher's talkin (come on)
My people sleep in coffins, I miss 'em, I'm breakin down
In the face of a bad bitch that I'm 'posed to be takin down
(Baby ridin while I'm cryin, I'm dyin inside
Cause my pain is Poseidon or a giant Leviathan that I'm hidin from the world)
They hit me with everything but the kitchen sink
How ironic, same place I vomit when I liquor drink
Apparently I need to get a shrink
How can therapy take care of me when I don't give a fuck what niggas think?
(Pull em off from me Joey)

[Hook: Joe Budden]
(I ain't tryin to sober up)
Strong enough to catch contact by
You smell it as soon as you get in my ride

Before we had a perm, we came from Adam's sperm
You see with plain vision, we live in the same system
Cocaine victims, once was able, can't even raise children
Where's 'the village' when you need it?
A question for the person in the looking glass
Our community's lookin bad like a bucket full of crabs
That's the crooked path
If we don't straighten this out, how long would it last?
Every night you hear the bullets blast
Even if you in the suburbs every night, you see the footage flash
Across your screen, I'll tell you my biggest pet peeve
You lookin at it thinkin like, ""It don't affect me""
You livin' large I'm thinkin like, ""It don't impress me""
Rockin them chains, Sojourner Truth is tryin to set free

See in America they flamed bottle rockets when slaves was not abolished (true)
Slayed a lot of fathers and raped a lot of mommas
Them days cotton products, we blame our modern problems
New ways they got us bondaged, the chains is psychologic
The media be feedin us napalm atomics
While the schools brainwash us, the crayons is toxic (blah!)
Don't believe the hype, they can save all the drama
Cause them apes not evolving, I can't swallow ya vomit
My rights as a human they change laws in congress
Now Shaytan in office, we can't call him honest
What part of the game do they play, cops or robbers?
In this land of Pocahontas, natives lost to conquest
Your false gods get framed, buffed and polished
If you ask who the prophet, they say Nostradamas (who?)
No ways of Muhammad, no pray five at Kabbah
Definition of a terrorist, they call Islamic
So many brothers puzzled and can't solve they problems
Smuggle crack, juggle rap, or play ball in college
But Uncle Sam, hustle man, take all your dollars
Break y'all, sink them 8-balls in your pocket
I'm chosen like Moses, here to take y'all to promise
My quest started when Tip say ""Lost my wallet""

Finish the whole bottle and we gonna do it big like this
Yeah, and he was just practice
He ain't in your world, you can take him off your atlas
Girl,  you on fire, can I be the one you match with?
I'll give you the credit card and baby you can max this out
Show me where your tats is
Show me where you heads at, maybe I can grasp it
If you ever come up with a question, you should ask it
Caught up on your ex still? I can get you past it
Yeah, and your friends all suggest
What's the chance of this nigga being better than the rest?
Just tell 'em you appreciate the help
But you just got to know for yourself
[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Girl, when I get you to the crib
Upstairs to the bed
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
Girl, when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
You gon' think I invented sex
You gon' think I invented sex
You gon' think I invented sex

Now who's coming home with me?
Tell me who's coming with me
I wanna know who's coming home with?
Tell me who's coming with me
Is it you? Is it you? Is it you? Is it you?
Is it you? Is it you? Is it you? Is it you?"

Back on the scene is the incredible one man
Army, army
Back on the scene is the incredible one man
Army

[Refrain]
With the eagle, I begin
Spread wings, ride the wind
My story never ends
I probably used a million pens
Hundreds of rhymes I was anxious to bust
Nowadays, what I touch, don't need the paper as much
Still sharper than the knife that Cane was Able to clutch
You permanently scarred from a subterraneous cut
You only get honest expressions when I spit in your ear
That means even when I'm dissing you I'm being sincere
That means even when I'm dissing you I'm being sincere
That means, that means, that means, that means

[Verse 1]
Don't need a major, indie cars drive me
Highly effective 'cause my crew selected
Never take the cause lightly
Get inspiration from the Almighty
I pray Allah guide me
Even underground cats be all sheisty
False grimy wack emcees need to floss nightly
'Cause they never seen as raw like me, so their jaws bite me (ouch)
Check me now, quarterback style
Every time they pass the microphone
You would think I was a Moss Viking
My style touchdown, your style need a touch-up
Even with a Rick James sample you couldn't touch SUB (can't touch this)
Wack emcees wanna act stuck-up when you kick it with 'em
Thinking I'm dissing 'cause I ain't feeling the shit they spitting
Know the difference between dissing and constructive criticism
They should try to pen a written that can fit the rhythm
Too busy trying to hit the ism, hit the women
Feminine, get the Benjamins, watch my SUB Zero – ""Finish him""
Finish 'em, finish 'em, finish 'em

Back on the scene is the incredible one man

[Verse 2]
We don't procrastinate, how many times I got to say to you
We ain't the type of cats that only talk about what they would do
For years we've been paying dues
Staying true to our self while we making moves
Thank God we made it through
Won't stop until I do what I came to do
Kick a flow and get the dough, that's just to name a few
Now every rhyme I say to you is here to stay with you
We stick in your head like it was said with the crazy glue
You wanna battle? One Be Lo is not afraid of you
I could care less about your reputation
Even though it may be true
The truth is Subterraneous your favorite crew
And all them non-believing cats that came with you
Can catch the vapors too
I rock their minds like the slingshot of David do
Liver than Pay-Per-View
You couch potatoes don't believe me, call the cable crew
Every time I bus' kids think they on their way to school
This grown man ain't got no time to play with you
Theresa didn't raise a fool
You try to play me Glenn Close, nah, we can't be cool
'Cause I'll be damned if I let it be a Deja Vu

A Song for Assata,Common,"['hip hop', 'jazz', 'r&b', 'blues', 'pop']","[Intro: Common]
In the Spirit of God
In the Spirit of the Ancestors
In the Spirit of the Black Panthers
In the Spirit of Assata Shakur
We make this movement towards freedom
For all those who have been oppressed, and all those in the struggle
Yeah. yo, check it-

[Verse 1: Common]
There were lights and sirens, gunshots firing
Cover your eyes as I describe a scene so violent
Seemed like a bad dream, she laid in a blood puddle
Blood bubbled in her chest, cold air brushed against open flesh
No room to rest, pain consumed each breath
Shot twice with her hands up
Police questioned but shot before she answered
One Panther lost his life, the other ran for his
Scandalous the police were as they kicked and beat her
Comprehension she was beyond, trying to hold on
To life; she thought she'd live with no arm
That's what it felt like, got to the hospital, eyes held tight
They moved her room to room; she could tell by the light
Handcuffed tight to the bed, through her skin, it bit
Put guns to her head, every word she got hit
""Who shot the trooper?"" they asked her
Put mace in her eyes, threatened to blast her
Her mind raced till things got still
Opened her eyes, realized she's next to her best friend who got killed
She got chills, they told her: that's where she would be next
Hurt mixed wit anger, survival was a reflex
They lied and denied visits from her lawyer
But she was building as they tried to destroy her
If it wasn't for this German nurse they would've served her worse
I read this sister's story, knew that it deserved a verse
I wonder what would happen if that would've been me?
All of this just so we could be free
So dig it, y'all
[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
I'm thinking of Assata, yes
Listen to my love, Assata, yes
Your power and pride is beautiful
May God bless your soul

[Verse 2: Common]
It seemed like the middle of the night when the law awakened her
Walkie-talkies crackling, I see them when they're taking her
Though she kind of knew
What made the ride peaceful was the trees and the sky was blue
Arrived to Middlesex Prison about 6 in the morning
Uneasy as they pushed her to the second floor in
A cell, one cot, no window, facing hell
Put in the basement of a prison with all males
And the smell of misery, seatless toilets and centipedes
She'd exercise, paint, and begin to read
Two years in a hole, her soul grew weak
Away from people so long she forgot how to speak
She discovered freedom is a unspoken sound
And a wall is a wall and can be broken down
Found peace in the Panthers she went on trial with
One of the brothers she had a child with
The foulness they would feed her, hoping she's lose her seed
Held tight, knowing the fight would live through this seed
In need of a doctor, from her stomach she'd bleed
Out of this situation a girl was conceived
Separated from her, left to mother the Revolution
And lactated to attack hate
'Cause federal and state was built for a Black fate
Her emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates
They fabricated cases, hoping one would stick
And said she robbed places that didn't exist
In the midst of threats on her life and being caged with Aryan whites
Through dark halls of hate she carried the light
I wonder what would happen if that would've been me
All of this just so we could be free
Yeah, I often wonder what would happen if that would've been me
All of this just so we could be free
So dig it, people
[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
I'm thinking of Assata, yes
Listen to my love, Assata, yes
Your power and pride is beautiful
May God bless your soul

[Verse 3: Common]
Yo, from North Carolina her grandmother would bring
News that she had had a dream
Her dreams always meant what they needed them to mean
What made them real was the action in between
She dreamt that Assata was free in their old house in Queens
The fact that they always came true was the thing
Assata had been convicted of a murder she couldn't've done
Medical evidence shown she couldn't have shot the gun
It's time for her to see the sun from the other side
Time for her daughter to be by her mother's side
Time for this beautiful woman to become soft again
Time for her to breathe, and not be told how or when
She untangled the chains and escaped the pain
How she broke out of prison I could never explain
And even to this day they try to get to her
But she's free with political asylum in Cuba

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
I’m thinking of Assata, yeah
Listen to my love, Assata, yeah
We’re molded from the same mud, Assata
We share the same blood, Assata, yeah
Your power and pride, so beautiful
May God bless your soul
Your power and pride, so beautiful
May God bless your soul
[Outro: Assata Shakur]
Freedom? You're asking me about freedom? You're asking me about freedom? I'll be honest with you. I know a whole more about what freedom isn't than about what it is, because I've never been free. I can only share my vision with you of the future, about what freedom is

The way I see it, freedom is-- is the right to grow, is the right to
Blossom. Freedom is-- is the right to be yourself, to be who you are, to be who you wanna be, to do what you wanna do--"

I meditate before I elevate, cough, medicate
Set a date, day which I escalate, heaven gates
No hesitation, Wolf revelation
Gang education, Freddy Jason, what it might seem
We shake and bake the cake, poison frozen icing
Fuck 'em all, ice cream, black magic, white dreams
Blue collar, purple tag label
You holla, don't bother me, you sitting at the fag table
My state is euphoric, and my pride is true courage
I reach for the stars, Fantastic Four it
Wealthy in my future, but I can't afford rich
Presidential suite, sound proof, door glitched
Terrorists landed, bet it gets handed on Christmas
You get caca if you on Santa's shit list
Receive a gun, raise your O.F. hitlist

Sellin out arenas, chicks wit asses like Serena
Man, shawty live a hell of a life (I'm tryna tell ya shawty)
It's a hell of a liiiiiiiife man, shawty live a hell of a liiiiiife...

Y'know, shawty goin extra hard when they release his passport
Why I need a credit card? What you thank this cash for? (What?!)
Hit the dealership and give 'em every dime he ask for
Just so I can see two-hundred sixty on the dashboard
If shinin 'gainst the law, somebody better get the task force
For me, hoes love me, lemme fuck 'em 'til their ass hoarse
Pimpin' 101, just come and see me take a crash course
You wanna count my money, go to college, need a math course
On a mad dash for a hundred milli runnin
Breakneck speed 'til I see a billi comin
I'm filthy rich and hungry, feel the grumblin in my stomach
I'm still stuntin off the chain, chasin nothin but some money
Put a couple pair of queens like I'm playin gin rummy
No cards, just broads when a nigga dick hard
Flooded offshore Audemars, lookin' like I caught a star
Put it in her wristwatch, ballin like a big shot

[Hook:]

[Verse Two]
Swag on fully, no semi, ho, hand me
Bankrolls, no pennies, drop Rolls (roles), no Emmy's
Street cred, no blemish, credit card, no limit
You went to Bankhead, spot a drop head, I'm in it!
And bendin, a couple corners, hoppin on 20
Wit three or four women givin love like tennis
My boxers where her chin is, giving me the business
While I'm ridin through the city, gag, swallow, no spittin
Livin life, like I just got out of prison Wednesday night
If yo' chick is in my sight, then that chick is gettin right
Ay, I know niggas now with bitches think I'm hittin it and they right
They keep my name up out dey mouth and mind dey business, dey aight
Hey aight, if you hear me say aight, okay, aight?
Cause you know I got dem goons with me and I pay aight
And they would like to see me broke or back to prison see me go
But instead they see me ballin, stuntin, everywhere we go - GO!

Money won't fold, pockets all swoll
Rubberband keep poppin off my bankroll

Started with five shots, niggas plottin' to kill him
Never figured that that same nigga sell five million
Hit the charts like a madman, nothin' but hits
Court cases got a nigga facin' multiple digits
Dodgin' cop cars, look at how we come so far
Picture a high school drop-out roll in a double R
House full of happiness, weed and drank
Way out, so when trouble tried to find me – can't
Never visioned livin' longer than my twenty first
Thought I'd be locked down, cracked out, or in the dirt
And though it hurts to see the change, it comes with the fame
Watch them gossip in this silly game
To all the motherfuckers speakin' down on me, this is the night
Why's everybody caught up in Pac's life?

What's happenin', Pac? Yeah, I know we never got to meet
But we know all the same people so we got to speak
You taught me first: fake niggas can't stop a G
And all the shit you went through meant a lot to me
But when they locked you up for nothin', it was a shame to see
You know the crackers came, they did the same thang to me
I get along with real niggas, it's the lane to be
Talkin' loud out of pocket tryna bang with me
And so I pull it out my pocket, let it rain, you see
Now they all in the courtroom, blamin' me
See, we ain't live the same life but represent the same struggle
Power to the real niggas, death to the suckers
Money over bitches, get to know 'em for you love 'em
Death before dishonour, never talk to undercovers
Live by the same rules, so minus the tattoos
We the same sort of dude with the same short fuse

I want money in large amounts
My garage full of cars that bounce
Movin' my tapes in major weight 'cause every dollar counts
Busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks
They runnin' off at the mouth 'til I fill it up with my pump
They jump, my automatic keep 'em weary
While you frontin' like you Billy Badass, nigga, you scary
I been knowin' you for years, we was high school peers
In Junior High I was itchin' to kill, and you was ready to die
While you bullshittin' niggas was dyin' and catchin' cases
Bustin' my automatics at motherfuckers in foreign places
Leavin' no trace, they see my face and they buried
Bitches die in a hurry, still I ride, I'm never worried
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride, and I'ma ride
Pick my enemies out the crowd, and motherfuckers die

I-Self-Lord-And-Master shall bring disaster to evil factors
Demonic chapters shall be captured by Kings
Through the storms of days after
Unto the Earth from the Sun through triple darkness to blast ya
With a force that can't be compared
To any firepower, for it's mind power shared
The brainwave causes vessels to circulate
Like constellations reflect at night off the lake
Word to the Father and Mother Earth
Seekin' everlastin' life through this Hell for what it's worth
Look, listen and observe
And watch another C-Cipher pullin' my peeps to the curb
Heed the words, it's like ghetto style proverbs
The righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
Cannot afford to be confined to a cell
Brainwaves swell, turnin' a desert to a well
Experience — the best teacher
Thoughts will spray like street sweepers
Little Daddy street preacher
Illustrious feature, narrator you select
Accompanied by Deck, plus the DJ you respect
The seven and a half combined, over the front line
The ten-percenters promotin' slander in the airtime
Bear in mind, jewels be the tools of the trade
Sharp blades, heavenly praise and dues are paid
[Hook: Guru]
Above the crowds, above the clouds
Where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual
Above the clouds, rainin' down, holdin' it down

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Yeah, I leave scientists mentally scarred, triple extra large
Wild like rock stars who smash guitars
Poison bars from the Gods bust holes in your mirage
And catch a charge, shake 'em down like the riot squad
Invade your zone, ruin like Ancient Rome
I span the universe and return to Earth to claim my throne
The maker, owner, plus soul controller
Ayatollah rest in the sky, the cloud's my sofa
Stand like Colossus, regardless to whom or what
Numerous attempts on my life, so who to trust?
Who but us to supply ya with the fire?
The burnin' truth, 150 Absolut proof
On the mic like Moses spoke in golden scribe
Survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
I notified families, we shed tears and mourn
But our hands are on the ammo 'cause the battle still on
Sound the horn, we come rumblin' through the function
Precise laser beam technique to touch somethin'
When we die hard, they'll build a monument to honor us with
Humongous effect in the world, we could've conquered it
[Hook x2: Guru]
Above the crowds, above the clouds
Where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual
Above the clouds, rainin' down, holdin' it down"
Corner Bodega Coke Spot,50 Cent,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by L.E.S.]

[Intro]
Aight, check this shit out
Y'all niggas gon' stay in the car
Imma go and handle this shit
Gimme ten minutes, If I don't come out, y'all come in
The money stays in the car 'til I say so... word up
Aiyyo, whattup whattup, man
This is what y'all niggas is workin' wit' for 22 cents a gram?


[Verse]
Man, when I come up in here treat me like I'm fam
I can go Uptown and get this shit 16 cents a gram
Bottom line is, man, I gotta cop and go
Got a spot and I can't afford to stop the flow
Poppi, what the fuck is the matter wit' ya Man?
Standin' against the wall with a gun in his hand
I ain't on no funny shit I'm on some ""get this money"" shit
Every four days in PA I move another brick
According to the DEA I sold dope in VA
My coupe stay in Queens but the plates read VA
I'll show you where I rest at, it ain't hard to find me
Let me buy a brick and get the other on consignment
(Hey, times is hard man) I know, don't remind me
If I catch another case I'mma kill Guiliani
It ain't even safe to sell a pack at night
Got task ridin 'round the projects on Mountain Bikes
[Hook]
NY ain't the same, it's OT playa
You can go and cop coke from the corner Bodega
Hit the highway and take it to a town near you
And get that money man, get that money man
NY ain't the same, it's OT playa
You can go and cop coke from the corner Bodega
Hit the highway and take it to a town near you
And get that money man, get that money man


[Outro]
Now, if you come to 1-3-4 and I'm not around
That means I copped and I went outta town
You motherfuckers know how I get down
I'm bout my money man, I'm bout my money man"
One Ought Not to Think,Canibus,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Canibus]
This one is relatively short; I won't say much about it
What's the point if you're still gon' doubt it
History is a weapon being used against us
Humanity has been abused before but few remember
Human hybrid, Hubble iris, double-sighted, untouchable when it comes to rhyming, but I struggle in private
One ought not to think, in other words stop thinking
Humankind is now on the brink of extinction
The Eagle has landed, Wernher von Braun
Handpicked the evil bastard called Magnum Innominandum
These ice-age quotes opposed Helios
Confusing the most yet I find it remedial
Turn the radio and TV off, think for a second
Technology is a blessing but it's also a weapon
A weapon of mass destruction givin' global instructions
Teaching us how to hate but does it in a way that we love it
Take my beloved rap music, erase the beat
Consumers act like they're afraid of intelligent speech
The rhymes are imagined in theory
Then itemized into a query
It takes more than your ears to hear me
Meditate; you will see it clearly
Elevate to a level where your judgment isn't impaired daily
Before the New World Order right around the corner
One day soon they gon lock down the borders
I ain't a activist, I can't do shit
I'd rather be a pacifist with a full clip
Keep sayin' your prayers, they won't care
God won't hear, do something, you won't dare
It's happened before, it'll happen again
It's happening over there; it'll spread here my friend
One ought not to think, in other words stop thinking
Mankind is now on the brink of extinction
Lost wisdom from the lost kingdom
Humankind is now on the brink of extinction"
Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend,Marilyn Monroe,"['pop', 'jazz', 'blues', 'r&b']","The French are glad to die for love
They delight in fighting duels
But I prefer a man who lives
And gives expensive jewels

A kiss on the hand
May be quite continental
But diamonds are a girl's best friend

A kiss may be grand
But it won't pay the rental
On your humble flat
Or help you at the automat

Men grow cold
As girls grow old
And we all lose our charms in the end

But square-cut or pear-shaped
These rocks don't loose their shape
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Tiffany's!
Cartier!
Black, Starr, Frost Gorham!
Talk to me Harry Winston
Tell me all about it!

There may come a time
When a lass needs a lawyer
But diamonds are a girl's best friend

There may come a time
When a hard-boiled employer
Thinks you're awful nice
But get that ice or else no dice

He's your guy
When stocks are high
But beware when they start to descend

It's then that those louses
Go back to their spouses
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

I've heard of affairs
That are strictly platonic
But diamonds are a girl's best friend
And I think affairs
That you must keep liaisonic
Are better bets
If little pets get big baguettes

Time rolls on
And youth is gone
And you can't straighten up when you bend

But stiff back
Or stiff knees
You stand straight at Tiffany's

Diamonds! Diamonds!
I don't mean rhinestones!
But diamonds are a girl's best friend"
Bombin Shit,Homicide,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]

I be bombin' shit like a motherfuckin' terrorist
Foes try to take me down like ""where is it?""
I'm shreddin' rippin' and tearin' shit
But I just be Bombin' Shit, Bombin' Shit
Bombin' Shit, Bob-bob-Bombin' Shit
I am the shit, Bombin' Shit

[Verse 1]

Yo, Homicide be a menace to society
Fuckin' with him is like fuckin' with HIV
Hoes don't like the fact that
My dick is too big to swallow, ACK!
Can't kill the unstoppable
Unpenetratable, ungradable
Never ever ratable
Shit, supreme being, homo superior
But have no faget genes
Rapin' families
Can't escape just dont call me a bad habit please
Staggering, swaggering, pants sagging
Chin-checkin', straight steppin', packin' deadly weapons
Puffin' weed, can't breathe
The bible states stuff but can you believe?
I'm livin' in a world consumed by money
And comedians still tryna be funny
This world has been running
It's fuckin' out of breathe
People on the streets more dangerous than sess
And yes, I am a mess
But can't you see I am thee best
Bombin' shit like a graffiti artist
I'm upset like cars in
A parking lot with no parkin'
[Hook]

Yo, yo, Homicide's in this for life
With a gun and a knife
At all times
My rhymes commit crimes
When put onto the mic
While you sleepin' I'm fuckin' your wife
She can't get my dick out her mouth
When I sad stop, she said ""another round!""
So I was BK, she had it her way
It was a fun day, but I had no say
She called all the shots and I said okay
After that I cut the bitch up, turned her into soup
Wore her fuckin' face
She shouldv'e known i was fuckin' crazed
Amazed, cannot be saved
Like bruce lee, there's a demon in my life
So grabbed the nigga's eyes
Ripped them out but they were in their tight
I punched his stupid ass in the face
Damagin', savagin', welcome to the savage lands
Decapitatin' shoguns, i am the chosen one
Holdin' a motherfuckin' gun
One fist weighs a ton, cause my shit's loaded up
Leavin' niggas with seizures or are they tryna crump
Well they suck, i don't really give a fuck
Said so much stuff, i think i'm done
So as i'm changin' my cap, you know ima be taggin'
My pants saggin', toe taggin', body baggin'
Straight raggin', four-four maggin'
Cause i'm bombin' shit, well fuck you!

Get Together,P.D.A.,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: P.D.A.]
I go so fucking hard when I spit this, mayne
And I'mma sell these beats like it was cocaine
And then it hits the streets, puts your shit to shame
So when I do these shows, these girls know my name
They come up to me, tell me how they like my hair
And if you really like it, girls don't be so scared
I like you too, but I was talking to her
And I'mma drink it up until I get all swerve
They call me P.D.A. but you already knew that, who's that
Tearing up the stage in a blue hat, move back
And I really like these groupies, on the other song I lied
As long as the fine are ready for some dick in their life
Man I'm colder than an ice chest, deep so grab a life vest
Girls really like this (no shirt) now that's a nice chest
So when I get on stage, girls run to hold me
I listen to them all, but them all just told me

[Hook]
I think that we should get together
[Verse 2: P.D.A.]
One in particular, she told me like this, whore
""I like your music but I like your dick more""
Oh, score, groupie hopping then to the next one
Rubber burn stomach cut up like c-sections
""You so nasty!"" Yes I is
Groupies call my cell phone leaving messages
But I never get pissed because I love their voices
And they rub up on my back, making noises
(Uhh, uhh!) And the choices
I can hit it from behind or some different poises
Get back to the room and they start rejoicing
Telling stories about P.D.A. and intercoursing

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Hank]
Baby girl, you see I got a problem with trust
And if you try to play me then you'll probably get cussed
Kicked to the curb with some change for the bus
And every time I see you, get the look of disgust
But girls seem to like the way I spit my verbs
And all the ones I like, they try to treat me like a herb
They think that cause I'm smart, that your boy is just a nerd
They try to gas me up and try to trick me with their words
Did I mention vibing on account of you're some positive shit
You was ??? with your hair in a twist
You turned me on to spoken word and all that cultural shit
You gave me tips on better living and the keys to the whip
I'm used to women coming at me for my money and time
Trying to take your man to court and give out half of the rhymes
Never spit a bar and lining grinding half of the grind
They easy to find, they must be out of half of their mind

Exhibit C,King Los,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Los]
And I could paint the whole world with these words
I speak life like earth, sky, trees, birds
Fly, land, water, dry land, breath, lungs, heart, eyes, hands
Progress comes only from what struggles of
So hold hate back with both arms and juggle love
Legs, feet, hustle to get eggs, eat, say grace, thank God, beg, weep
You could never ignore it nor say you haven’t protected me into an exit
I wreck it with the best vivid exquisite, exhibit prerequisites ever recorded
It's clever, adore it, if you possess it, explore it
My predicate’s soaring, my metaphor’s transforming
It never gets boring, it's boiling over, it's pouring
All over the flow, the goodest mess ‘cause I am all over this flow to put it best
If you the best, put your best foot forward this step
No breath so fly when I go by in a robot, could have done copilot
But no, I did Three’s Company like Roper, Janet, Jack, Chrissy and Larry
Don't I lay it down and just say fuck it like missionary?
Picture me carry my city over a mountain
I'm long gone like whites only over a fountain
May God’s mercy grace me while I write this verse and save me
Every working lady birthing babies due to hurt in Haiti
I'm praying for you with my head down, knees bent
That you keep your head up till you get your needs met
Make every recent cent rebuild, grief sent?
Memory until this is meant to be, we vent
This is big shit baby, every bar tremendous
It'll probably take Cannabis to comprehend this
Hold up, hold up before y'all niggas get fly, I don't mean the rapper
I mean you might have to get high to see the shit I've lived, seen, did
Like my mama who was the youngest of sixteen kids
And at sixteen, I ain't know what a sixteen is
Now I'm like my granddaddy letting sixteens live
Sixteens forever, you will never see my shit fade
I got more sixteens than the tenth grade
My flow intense with no tent made
Find ways to eat like a compass and a switchblade
With no attempt made, I'm still incredible
And I ain't buying your stories, you ain't credible
I came here to take rap back, Re-Po
And this how much I care about these whack cats, zero"

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more

Say, I’m the savior, that’s a lot of weight on my shoulders
The audio savior, the entity’s out of my focus
Say, I’m the savior, that’s a lot of weight on my shoulders
The audio savior, the entity’s out of my focus

[Verse 1: Laws]
They sayin' I spit proper
But then respect turn into stigmata
Back in the day, I wasn’t responsive
Now I’m responsible for this hip-hop shit
Tell me since when did these stuck up kids need my help
Since my battlin' days, I’ve tried to distance myself
Though competition showed me I was in another league
Back when I wanted to do nothin' else but MC
But times change and people change faster
Old fans questionin' is he the same rapper?
'Cause I ain’t kickin' punch lines about fireballs
A small percentage of you no longer admire Laws
But I’m Laws and Laws gettin' tired of board
I was cable access, now I’m on some Viacom
Primetime traffic jam elevated higher cause
I’m buildin' a bridge, why you crying for?
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Laws]
They wanna bring my origin up again and again
The first lyrical Brazilian American
My skin tone may make you think I’m Puerto Rican
I’m with my head covered, maybe an Arabian
But guess again, kind of unorthodox
My adopted family was Puerto Rock, is that any different?
‘Cause I ain’t reggaeton, know I respected the flow
But I was raised on Willie Colon, Hector Devoe
So I’m the next Latin with an exceptional flow
But that brings more problems, let’s say that, oh
You move to a town that’s mostly white
And you discover a gift for music almost overnight
But only a bunch of bums seem to know you tight
They wanna hold you down, you wanna hold the mic
So when they start goin' left, you start going right
You keep on makin' moves like the poltergeist

[Outro]
Say, I’m the savior, that’s a lot of weight on my shoulders
Jesus Christ, he’s just nice, Jesus Christ, he’s just nice
Jesus Christ, he’s just nice, Jesus Christ, he’s just nice, hail Mary
Say, I’m the savior, say, I’m the savior, say, I’m the savior
Say, I’m the savior, say, I’m the savior"

Rose Garden,Shad,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
I didn't promise you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gonna be some rain sometimes
Watch out
I didn't promise you a rose garden (Yeah)
Along with the sunshine
There's gonna be some rain sometimes
Listen, ok

[Verse 1 : Shad]
When Abraham went to slash Issac
In a sense he baptized him
Rabbi said don't trust in cash prizes
Same things that float your boat can capsize it
Tell the snakes they can take a hike like gas prices
No such things as half-way crooks or half righteous, yeah
Those who have eyes should act like it
To help the sightless seeking the light switch
To see in the night with, we leading the lifeless
Sometimes I just wanna play some shows, make some dough
Take it home, lay in my bed, and stay in my safety zone
But Cee-Lo said it best
I know too much and I owe too much to let it rest
Heard a voice say hey
You never question when you get the blessings
So don't get vexed when your life is stressed
And I promised I'll be with you no matter what the issue
But there will be some issues to address
Listen to the lady in the dress
[Hook]

[Verse 2 : Shad]
Rain feels like this, check it
I'm not in the zone, there's too much in the way
I weigh two bucks and if I had two slugs to spray
Like raa raa, Glenn Beck better duck like foie gras
Make shots poke his face like Gaga
But mama says forgive, so I give him that bar like a Mars then let him live
The Mississauga continues, Brampton
While my DJ's lamping like Green Lantern, sampling
Mansions? Nah, I ain't rich as Richard Branson
I'm King Kong meets Vince Vaughn and I play like a champion
In my Monday ball league, nah B, all week
Seven days of black power naps every forty eight half hours
That's twenty four starring Jack Bauer
Can't cower when the rain falls
And it falls whether you're Gandhi or you're Adolf
Fall weather vendors always are way off
Make the call no rain delay
Play ball

Super Lyrical,Big Pun,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Big Pun]
Ayo, my murderous rap verbal attack is actual fact
Tactical tracks match perfectly with graphical stats
Half of you lack the magical dap of tragical rap
That tackles your back and shackles and laughs at you
That's a mathematical madness I'm on
The savage, the strong
The marriage and bond of havoc and song
This massacre's on, as if Picasso laced you
There's lots of hateful skeletons locked
In the closet of my castle of Grayskull
I'm possum at grade school
That's why I have to debate you
My raps are like Cable, slashing your facial
That's how a master degrades you, I'm battling Jesus
If he passes through my label I'm snatching his halo
God, I'll trade you, if you send my father back as an angel
Language is fatal and it's hypnotizing
I'm only emphasizing
I'm still all about business and enterprising
I'm super lyrical, with brain-booster chemicals
That's used up tentacles inside of my mental projectable
[Chorus]
Lyrically, I'm supposed to represent
Niggas'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah, blah, blah
Lyrically, I'm-I'm supposed to represent

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Black Thought, the super lyricist, your arch-nemesis
Still with the Punisher, that's my accomplice
Stressing to emcees how they don't really want this
Electrifying shit his excellency Thought spit
These cats, they sentimental such with a gentle touch
Dancing double dutch and all saying nothing much
My sound wave lifting your chin up, like uppercuts
Newfound ways of ripping shit up, I develop
Your squad chest swell up, still you're mini-ay-ture to me
Nature-ally I bring the extremity
Musically intense with the globe in suspense
Contemplating where the world traveler been since
The Roots bless you with a strong record, long like a epic
Immerse you in some old next shit, ill poetic
Thought from Illadelph, somethin' like nothing else
My talk stomp like elephants upon every elf, 'cause what?

[Chorus]
Lyrically, I'm supposed to represent
Niggas'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah, blah, blah
Lyrically, I'm supposed to represent
You will lose, I must break you

Niggas'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah, blah, blah

Ayo, peace Roots, East Coast niggas reppin' the streets most
With heat, toast, and keep close more Phillies than Pete Rose
These those niggas that'll lift your mentals
Lyrics'll twist your temples into pretzels
Like the Triumph instrumental
My instrumental's the Renaissance, no resem-ba-lance
To nothing you come across, lyrical holocaust
The crowd pleaser, emcees freeze then catch seizure
They praise the Lord of rap thesis, true believers
Just call me Baby Jesus, 'cause lately niggas be praising me
Just for the way I blaze the beat crazily, tape to CD lasery
It pays to be amazingly flavory
Gaze into my rhymes that basically hypnotize you occasionally
Occasionally as I focus on my next opus
The way it's all fucked up and emcees is hopeless
I'll leave your head wrecked as I erect sculptures
My thought's just a fortress
Approach this ferocious up-closeness

Lyrically, I'm supposed to represent
Niggas'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah, blah, blah

Some people ask me where I been lately
They thought I fell off, nobody could save me
They play in the background, I don't back down
So don't get it twisted and try to play me

Then I come back, they still try to fade me
They say I'm nasty, say I'm crazy

Got my self-esteem back, got my confidence up
I'ma step up on this stage now, I'm gonna strut
And walk around with my pants hangin' off of my butt
And you ain't 'bout to tell me nuttin', boy, get off of my nuts
It goes one for the money, two for the show
My shit don't stink, I don't think so
Wipe my ass with the tissue and roll it back up in the roll
Are you ready now, here we go, the bald eagle has landed
I'm back in your hair, sorry for leavin' you stranded
I'm twice as dreaded, evil and rancid
They can't sit, I don't think anybody understands it
Especially when the world's silly putty in your hands, it's Play-Doh
I ain't back to play, though, they say he died in a fatal
Car crash, shows what they know
Shit if I did, it'd be a trailer not a car
The white trash star, I fuck an RV-up like Brett Favre
Homie, you got it backwards, you're dipping your soup inside your crackers
I can carry rap till my back hurts
Set it down, go right back to the chiropractors
Get my back right then I'm right back on you bastards
I was chasing the dragon, I don't know what happened
It's like the feeling I had when I first started rappin', I just
Couldn't seem to get back and recapture that magic, so I went back
To the lab, that's where I been at, when

Got the fuckin' shape of mushroom clouds for thought bubbles, I'm the *explosion*
You ain't fucking sick, the hospital
Won't even give you cough drops for coughs, cocksucker
You think you hot? You ain't even lukewarm My puke's hotter than you
You're soft, I use fire to cool me off
I told 'em I'd grow up one day and show 'em I'd be able to choke clouds
Pick up lightning bolts and throw 'em
Take the world by storm with these words I form
Georgi-porgi kissed the girls, make the girls cry for it
Make 'em swarm, make 'em fight over the shirts I've worn
Swoon over my sweat towels, it's mind blowin'
Yes, I'm livin' the dream, homie, can't nothing compare
I’m so up, I’m stuck in midair, I’m lovin' it, yeah
It's like these people are steps now, all they do is stare
These haters are so pussy, they afraid to be scared
This is pay back, like I owe 'em back pay
They spat in my face, now I'm back to do them the same exact way
And leave this rap game with a bad taste
And slap it back out before I step back outta this crap, they
Slap me, now I'm slappin' 'em back, hey
Fuck it, we're slap happy, yeah, okay, now I'm talking some smack, ayy
And I ain't looking back, in fact, they can stare at my ass crack
How's that for hind sight? What the track say?

Metallic wing pigeon
Cannibal Ox

[Verse 1: Vast Aire]
Birds of the same feather flock together
Congested on a majestic street corner
That's a short time goal for most of 'em
Cuz most of 'em
Would rather expand their wings and hover over greater things
That's what we call inspired flight
By the pigeons that gotta eat pizza crust every night
And ""Let there be light"" was understood
When a mic-stand descended from up-and-above into the hood
And if my face is worth a thousand words when it's scarred
I would only hope that two of those are cocoa and butter
To heal the wounds
Of the tissue scarred to mark the death of my womb
But I've graduated, got my wings
And you've got to let go of my constructed Lego egg-o-waffle halo
Eh yo, I'm a black man, with an African
Drum in my chest that beats on the opposite of the right
Let me know I got a breath left
In this frigid fragile capsule
That allows you to fly south before the winter winds trap you
I wrap my ""hell I made it"" wetsuit stitch
So I can swim in elevators crazy wet through piss
I'm just a pigeon with one mile left
That doggy-paddles through this bullshit ocean of death
And these rags-to-riches words will break bones
Like the assassination of two birds with one stone
That's why I don't associate with bird brains with their beaks in the air
Pelicans with wide jaws yap names
For fish heads you'll get tossed in the flames
Where some archaeologists will find your skeletal frame

Eskimo medal doctrine locked in oxygen shell
Words shot plated metal lung which spun kids' carousel
Mega alarm technoloid these boys fight four arms
Swinging two toes very well
Terror toys jubilated mega noise when iron works
Bullet shot animated mad windows with fireworks
Shinin' summer-time hydrants
Splash passing cars, now run ghetto tyrants
These faces carry scars (mega large)
Pigeons turn penguins, talk fables cellular
Detached Christ's Word
But freeze-frame gold chain swing Son of God
Iceberg gem shines on the neck, ghetto flight bird
Getting fly like word
Let it settle
I remember cats snatched off the pedal (stealing bike days)
Doo-rags worn tight (Piranha bite waves)
Smoke cheeba through the lung, Arabian camel
Fast like a cheetah now I'm knocked off my African sandal
God damn you! Ethiopian skin mechanical
Trapped in ghetto's mega yard where mega-hard
Arms swinging metal palms iron skin leopard
Holding evil metal eagle attach the desert
Paranoid fingertips stitched with three-fifty plus seven metal shit
Tucked behind the belt ghetto style like delicate street etiquette
Never lactose, metal cow got milk in her guts settling
Cats gotta eat, swallow beef horribly
Melanin, mahogany, black boys feed face arachnoid
Eight arms working short circuit manufactured, crack melted
Slinging shot guns through the mouth of cracked helmets, black felt it
Cats who pop flows shot heavy through the nostril
Brain sizzle, grab the pistol and get hostile
He caught you alone fuse blown
Unemployed screaming ""That's why I robbed you!""
Tired of the Medicaid, debted by the car
No containers filled with lemonade, ""You better get a job!""
Mother talked, just another hawk
Humiliated bodega food stamp transaction
Left me in corners, buckled me accompanied by evil hands clapping
Rocking my ""hell I made it"" wetsuit stitch
So I can swim in elevators crazy wet through piss
I rock my simulated air tank bit
So I can leave pressures of oxygen where my mic's lit
I'm just a pigeon"

Bitch I'm ten toes in it
Not a fake a facade or a cloned image
Got into rap same way I jumped in the streets
With my own spinach
Tryin' to get straight up off this shit just so I can go on livin'
No song spinnin' so I resort to this zone flippin'
Something must be wrong wit em, he takin' this shit for granted
Try to write up in the house with no lights, you'll understand it
I can't teach ya how to dougie
But I can teach ya bout this thuggin'
Keepin' it thorough, keep your mouth closed, nigga
Keep it one-hundred
Keep yo hand up out my goddamn pocket
And keep it pushin'
Keep the reefer keep the white
Keep the soft and just keep it cookin'
But keep in mind that any given day you can die for this
As I bag this dope I'm prayin' one day that I could just
Make an honest piece of change, prolly change the way I live

Tryin' get rich and let the dollars flow throughout my clique
So we can break bread and never ever be broken

Weed turns them out without a doubt
They mouth about to be open
I let Alicia put her tongue on Valerie while I’m strokin'
But I ain't Jack Tripper, I'm that nigga plain and simple
Fresh out the G to MTV, check the credentials
Ain't been a nigga bigger since the Jacksons left the city
Reppin' the hardest niggas ain't know
That we was rappin' in my city
And regardless if I got support or backin' from my city

To keep the streets hot, that's my desire

Till it's time for us to sit down at the table

Tell me, who will?

So you know I'mma keep it real
So much bullshit in the last six months tried to take my focus

Give them a dollar and say ""God bless you, cause you must be a basehead""

Heart of a Champion,Nelly,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","{*Nelly exercising and breathing hard*}

[Verse 1: Nelly]
I guess he's back 'urr derrty, STL derby
I'm like Magic to Kareem, mayne you tell me I ain't Worthy
I ain't speakin 'bout a jersey, I'm speakin 'bout income
DID YOU HEAR THAT ELIZABETH? HERE COME THE BIG ONE!
I put mo' money in the community than you got in yo' budget
I wipe my ass with yo' advance to the toilet then flush it
My last stance be a stance of a General Custer
I hot dog cause I can, I got the cheese and mustard
I got the stats of a hall of famer - in just two records
That's why I'm back up at the Super Bowl with Julius Peppers
I got that can't stop, won't stop, in my veins
That's why they can't stop, won't stop, screamin the name
NELLY! NELLY! Go tell a friend to tell a friend
I'mma keep the same grin whether I, lose or win
Up, or down ten, I'mma fight to the end
{*breathing hard*} Let's go

[Hook: L.U.V.E.]
Ain't no way they can stop me now Nelly
Cause I'm on my way, I can feel my ring comin
It's the blood of a champion, pumpin
Deep inside my veins, too much pride to be runnin
I'mma get what I can and more, even if
My blood, my sweat, and my tears don't mean nothin
It's the heart of a champion (it's the heart of me)
(It's the heart of a..) in me
[Verse 2: Nelly]
I'm the first pick, the first round, signing bonus profound
Playin for his hometown, reppin for the home ground
And gettin bucks like Michael Redd, tell 'em again
I gets bucks like Michael Redd, heard what I said?
The MVP of the game, intensity still the same
I'm shootin out from my reign, with Peyton Manning-type aim
Can't stop me from scorin so they resort to just hackin
So there's, three of us now - me, A.I. and Shaq'n
From the look to the as I say
Hover man with more heart than Hallmark on Valentine's Day
I'm the one that you've been ravin' about, like Ray Lewis
I think it hard to go and change your route
Cause you don't know if I'm blitzin or if I'm sittin and readin
Waitin for you to go and trip, drop back and throw up a pick, man
AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW, AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW
AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW, AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Nelly]
It's like a big time decision made on how I can twurk it
If hard work pays off then easy work is worthless
My work habit ain't no habit man, I do it on purpose
I push myself to the limit so my talent'll surface
So now it's, curtains and drapes, on anybody who hates
Dislikin what I'm recitin, bitin what I've been writin
I've been dogfightin, scratchin and clawin on every hike
Tryin to make you remember me like you Remember the Titans
Cause I'm a WARR-IOR, my daddy was a soldier
A Vietnam vet, lil' derrty I thought I told ya
I'm supposed ta, whip up your town in Testarossas
Heatin like Folgers mayne, I'm young, black, and rich
As good as it gets, and givin your point guard fits
He think he done seen pressure mayne, but he ain't seen shhhh...
AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW, AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW
AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW, AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW

I be like yiggy, yes, y'all, Doctor on call
I'll rock 'til my name in graffiti on the wall
Got flow like the rapids in Great George
Got weed? I got blunts, My name Jamal
I pause, flick the ash from my L
I Pause like Run and Jason Mizell
The emcee is me, host for the night
Papa Doc, only thing I don't choke on the mic
I choke a bitch out if my gwap ain't correct
Then with my John Hancock, I'll get the check
I love trucks but drop tops is the best
From the Bimmers, Benz, now I roll Lex, watch me
Haha, she like Red so cool
Any nigga after me is a deja vu
Doc stay in the paint like A.I. shoes
Just watch how a one tonner made a move, dig it
[Chorus: Saukrates]
Hop in my truck and roll up the window
Ayo, you know what you in fo'
Once we turn the corner, light up the indo
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Oh yes, she's with me gettin' low like a limbo
Roll with Gs and we'll show you how to get dough
Third degree, let it burn with my kinfolk
Ayo, ayo, ayo (Let's get it)

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Who these corner store rappers slingin' cracks in my hall?
Mama's in the kitchen cookin' cat, rat and dog
Me, I want a lil' somethin', y'all could have it all
I'm tryna walk before I crawl and move this package in my drawers
That's why I push the pedal to the muhfuckin' floor
With ten percent left to those who bloodsuck the poor
And still I keep it funky like four plus one more
Get this money like In God We Trust, trust your boy
It's a given, livin' this life like it was written
Especially for me, I'm what the recipe is missing
Blow my piff in the air, key the ignition
Then get to lane switchin', pluckin' ashes off the clip and
Mami wanna ride and play the Bonnie to my Clyde
If anybody try to kill Bill, it'll probably be the bride (Yup)
Like all jokes aside, I'm serious with mine
And now I'm on this grind like Method Man in his prime
[Chorus: Saukrates]
Hop in my truck and roll up the window
Ayo, you know what you in fo'

Third degree, let it burn with my kinfolk
Ayo, ayo, ayo

[Verse 3: Redman]
Yo, I got my swagger on and I feel great
Funk Doc be in the hood like Enfamil cases
I network on MySpace real late
Hoping my app'll make me another Bill Gates
Around my crib, look how I live
I'm a slob but crip niggas say I get biz
Anywhere I did a show women sayin' that I'm so amazing

[Verse 4: Method Man]
Yeah, another mic, another night in the Days Inn
Another heist, another kite in the state pen
My state business shit, y'all dudes just break wind
(New York nigga) Either you're made mice or made men
I do the dirt that keep my hand on the work
I got the other hand up Mona Lisa's skirt
My aim one since day one, Doc
How many shots will it take to make son drop?

Hop in my truck and roll up the window

Old Fashioned Love Song,Humpasaur Jones,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Humpasaur Jones]
Poets had sweaty palms since the Reniassance
Getting bombed and singing the same seven songs
Where did it all go wrong? ...long story
It got corny, too happy pop top 40
There's nothing left, it's all been done to death
But every generation re-writes love and sex
It's hard getting open, I could set this pen in motion
Or just get stoned and quote Leonard Cohen
And Joni -- late nights, broken and lonely
Choking off a lump in your throat when you smoke weed
I've never been a sentimental dude
Kept it smooth, even when I'm too depressed to move
And I guess it's true what the old folks say
It's impossible to speak from your soul, most days
So I'm just hoping I can focus on the slow parts
The Mozart of broken ribs and exposed hearts
Getting deep and it's only been a week
Sweaty sheets soaked in memories that never leave
I gotta relax, but all that I have
Is the love song that drove me to the bottle and back
[Verse 2: Louis Mackey]
I’m sort of a bastard and brute for love
And every whore-slut I tore up I’m smashing some brews
Kinda puts me in a classical mood
As I got drunk and forgot what you asked me to do
I apologize for the six pack on your birthday
Or the last time that I actively splurged pain
“It’s better we’re apart” is severing my heart
Sending you unanswered letters in the dark
But thanks for the calls at the medical center
The deep love that’s still ascending to embers
Most of what I say is open for debate
I’m not hoping when I pray I know that you’re okay
And we all know Lou’s a passionate dude , when he’s crafting these
Ever since he was first running after your *****
And yeah, that fabulous laugh of the smooth way
I first asked you to dance in the room, nervous glances ensued
I got burned twice trying to handle your truth
I tried to get it...and only mumbled words
You met a fucking dork and left a troubadour
I was told Pallas was a dangerous muse
But didn’t believe it till I was mangled in two"
Oh My God,Professor Green,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Professor Green]
Are you ready for the revolution?
My elocution is execution, I am electrocuting
What the hell I'm doing? I've no idea
But catch a whiff of my fingers and you can still smell Susan
Mouth like ashtray, breath stinking a liquor
Pocket full of change in yesterdays get up
The same jeans I had on the day before last
I guess I'm rap's George Best with a lot more cess
That's a little more liqour and a lot more sex

[Hook: Labrinth]
Sometimes we take it to far
Knocked out sick on my guitar
And I hear them say oh my God
Say oh my God, say oh my God
Lay my head down on the bar
Cause whisky never tastes so good
When I hear them say oh my God
Say oh my God, say oh my God

The first toke on the piggy made me shiver
Sip a, K, while picking at yesterday's dinner, plate
The way I say things it figures I'm paid
Slicker when I think say, spitters made victims a they
If your insane and wanna get in my way pic a
Day when you wanna get hit with a rake
Mr diss me not, I'm frisky, what?
Still itching to stick me cock in Pixie Lott
Just call me rap's George Best with a lot more cess
A little more liqour and a lot more sex, yes

I do drugs cause I like the buzz
Go sleep and wake up feeling like I tried to fight a bus
A barely functioning alcoholic
Living life like a student with a popstar's wallet
Always smiling with my new teeth
Two E's, two pupils, two two P's
In a chemical romance and I'm loved up
The mascot for a generation full of fuck ups

Don't be afraid, it's alright
Don't be afraid, it's all good

Overthrow your whole settlement, this is beat embellishment

Cause they said they played they parts well
Now they claim caviar, hate that oxtail

Are you the one we look to, the decent Negro?

Athletes of today in the NBA, make me proud

First he played his life cool just like Michael
Now he rock ice too just like I do
Yo, you can't do better than that?
The hotel clerk who adjusts the bathroom mat?
Now you lose sponsorships that you thought had your back
Yeah, you beat the rap jiggaboo, fake nigga you

He turned it down, his teeth was brown
Excruciating, foreign, it was a new sensation
I had to ask the dope to pass the soap

Or bathrooms in a bus station
He had a can of Olde E and some raisins
Amazing... head to toe B.O

[Verse 2]
Now in class you need total concentration
But there's kids in the back holding conversations
Crackin' on each other, and neither were poster boys
Both of 'em smell like the type that soap avoid
Coast enjoyed a leave of absence
One's fool's feet smelled like it struck some matchsticks
Brimstone, girls would never bring him home
I was laughin', then his friend raised his tone
And said, ""Bud, you earled all over yourself,"" yeah
I go so deep on your ass, you'll be submerged
Like you need to do in water 'cause you smell like a turd
Wanna cap? Get some courage, your feet smell lurid
Go look it up, and while you're at it, get a cup
And squeeze the sweat out your sweatshirt and drink it or gargle
You get our vote for most stinkiest
That nigga started thinkin' of shit, said I was frail
I said he was stale, underarms is ripe
Undergarments tight, about to leap out your holey sweats
And we holdin' bets, and after this I'm gonna collect
Nigga check, yourself, respect yourself
And wash your mothafuckin body 'fore your sweatshirt melt
Like radioactive, no lady find you attractive
The funk got you captive
You don't need a map, bitch
[Hook]
You gotta wash your ass, if you must
You gotta wash your hair, if you must
You gotta brush your teeth, if you must
Or else you'll be funky
*scratching* ""To wash up""
You gotta wash your ass, if you must
You gotta wash your hair, if you must
You gotta brush your teeth, if you must
Or else you'll be funky

Time to Get Ill,Beastie Boys,"['hip hop', 'rock', 'pop', 'r&b', 'blues', 'alternative']","What's the time?
It's time to get ill
And what's the time?
It's time to get ill
So what's the time?
It's time to get ill
Now what's the time?
It's time to get ill

I'm not the type of person who likes to waste my time
And when I'm on the mic - I just say my rhymes
And I'm out on bail - the check is in the mail
They can sentence me to life - and I won't go to jail
I'm cool, calm, collected - from class I was ejected
Just me, Mike D., and M.C.A. - we're rarely disrespected
I got all the time that I need to kill
What's the time? - it's time to get ill

You been fully captivated by that funky-ass bass
Your girlfriend screams when MCA's in the place
He stumbles in the room with the Chivas in his hand
Cold chillin' in the spot at the microphone stand
I'd have the pedal to the metal if I had a car
But I'm chiller with the Miller - cold coolin' at the bar
I can drink a quart of Monkey and still stand still
What's the time? - it's time to get ill
Yeah
Look-lookin'-look-look-look-look
Lookin' at my Gucci, it's about that time
Lookin' at my Gucci, it's about that time

Deee...
Went outside my house - I went down to the deli
I spent my last dime to refill my fat belly
I got rhymes galime - I got rhymes galilla
And I got more rhymes than Phyllis Diller
MCA takes a stand - man, you're in command
Homebody, turn it out and don't give a damn
Man my name is MCA - I've got a license to kill
And what's the time? - it's time to get ill

I'm Mr. Ed
The famous Mr. Ed
Riding down the block…uh-ahh...

Riding down the block with my box in my hand
Today I feel like chillin' just as chill as I can
Coolin' on the corner with a forty of OE
'Cause me and MCA we're down with Mike D
Man, when I run a jam - I don't give a damn
When I'm throwing bass - I say, ""Thank you, ma'am.""
Fuel injected, rhyme connected - running things
Well, I'm the King Ad-Rock and I'm the king of all kings
I'm looking for a spot - things are gettin' hot
I'm MCA, I'm here to stay - and you sir, you are not
Oh no, it could not be - it's such a sight to see
It's such a trip - you're on my tip, so listen to Mike D
My work is my play - because I'm playing when I work
My name's Mike D, as you can see, man, I can do the jerk
MCA, Ad-Rock, Mike D - it's chill
What's the time? - it's time to get ill
Now what's the time?
It's time to get ill
And what's the time?
It's time to get ill
So what's the time?
It's time to get ill
And what's the time?
It's time to get ill..."

G.I. Pride,Freddie Gibbs,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
I was born in small town with big dreams
Pops told me as a child I would do big things
Used to watch him in the mirror when he used to rehearse
Hella talented but talent wasn’t makin’ no merch
Another product of that Gary, Indiana
Sex, drugs, and murder
Dirty politicians, dirty police, dirty burners
On the streets as a worker
Was a very fast learner
School never taught me how to be a earner
Before you mothafuckers bother me just take a look at this economy
Cause economically we at the bottom
So playa hatin’ niggas copy me
My enemies they tried to body me
But couldn’t get to me before I got ‘em
A motherfuckin’ problem
Gangster Gibbs
When I do it do it big
Put it down for the crib
Rap shit to totin’ that gat shit
And it’s plain to see
That it ain’t no changin’ me

I’m comin’ live from the
G, A-R-Y
Good or bad, right or wrong
Where the young boys die
No mercy, no pity in my city and it’s plain to see

No mercy, no pity, not a tear in my eye
Why cry, I’mma blaze another blunt n’ get high
Look in the sky, blow the smoke to my niggas
Pray to God for forgiveness
Yes I’m sinnin’ but I’m winnin’ and it’s bidness on you bitches
You can go against my wishes and put a stop on my riches
Then my peeps leave you sleep in Lake Michigan with the fishes
Niggas think that it’s fictitious till they hear that ratta-tatta
Niggas scatter
Even senior citizens tote the hammer
Thought that Gary, Indiana was movin’ on up the ladder
But I guess it didn’t matter when the crackers got sick’a Hatcher
They turn their back to us
Introduce crack to us
Got you ridin’ with that iron in that black Buick
I been through it, you can feel it in my music
Cook it up and move it
This is how we do it

Riff block, valley boy
Nigga catch a beat down

Bronx niggas real killas
Etna to Ironwood, full of crazy niggas
Shady niggas, can’t forget ‘bout my Delaney niggas
And all my homies through the streets of the G
I’m gonna let the streets speak though me
It’s for them cats pushin’ packs in the hallway
Doin’ it the hard way
Posted on the corner like liquor stores on Broadway
Watchin’ for the jackals keep ‘em clappin for the gunplay
Live for the day

Anywhere the kid go, you know GI ride
So I dedicate this record to my GI thugs
And I bleed the same GI blood

Country Cousins,Talib Kweli,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Raheem DeVaughn]
Down cousins.. across the border
I got cousins.. country cousins
I got cousins.. country cousins
WHOO!

[Talib Kweli over Intro]
Yo son, what the deal son? What's really hood son? (what's really hood?)
Word is born, shit is real, shit is real
Yo son, this block is def
Nigga need to go over here and pop off real quick
I gotta get that gwop by all means, you know what I'm sayin son

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
Growing up in Brooklyn, shit I thought that everybody talked this way
Raised on Rakim and Run-D.M.C., so I thought that everybody walked this way
""We fresh, we chill, we def, we ill,"" it's just some things that was taught to say
And every Saturday morning, I watched cartoons with a bowl of Frosted Flakes
Then.. the puberty came, started hitting them cuties with game and the truancy came (uh!)
Started cutting in not just class, I was comin all fast, I was new to the game (uh!)
Used to playin on T.V., courtesy of video music box
Plus! Knew a lot of hustlas, goin O.T., comin back with the new hip-hop
Like! E-40 holding down the yay (that yay), N.W.A. in L.A
OutKast from the A-Town, way down in Houston they play the UGK
I walk and talk kinda fast and thought of as a New York kinda rhymer (word is born)
But must New Yorkers got family in South and North Carolina (come on!)
L.A. is little Alabama, they walk and they talk with a country grammar
New York think everybody else sound country, so they get started, started callin 'em 'Bamas
Down south where we buy them hammers, down south where we sell them drugs
Down south where life is cheap, where they quick to fill you with them slugs
[Hook: Talib]
It's nothin, I'm from New York but I got country cousins
It's nothin, we stay connected by the slang we bustin
Want it simply put? You can't pin me when I spit gotta set everyone free
I'mma underground king, nigga Pimp C free
Word up to my man Bun B what?
It's nothin, I'm from New York but I got country cousins
It's nothin, we stay connected by the slang we bustin
The thing we bustin, the game we hustlin, the things we cuttin
The flame we cuppin, the lames we snuffin, your name is nothin!

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Growing up in P.A., I knew nobody out there talked like us
Nothin but that county slang, ""What up dog? What up cuzz?""
Late night you see us guzzling 40's, menthols, wine, and weed
Sitting on the back porch, getting zooted, feeling fine indeed
Listening to Eric B. and Rakim or EPMD
Cool C and Steady B, plus that Public Enemy
Not to mention N.W.A., DJ Quik, and MC Eiht
Down south we listen to it all, we didn't discriminate
Then along came Geto Boys, Raheem, and the Royal Flush
Rap-A-Lot Records based out in Houston, represents for us
O.G. Style, The Convicts, Def IV and Too Much Trouble
Odd Squad and Ganksta NIP put it down for H-Town on the double
So I said, ""It's time to hustle,"" got down with my brother C
Put together UGK and shit the rest is history
We make hits by the dozen, put it down when they said we wasn't
Trust me it's nothin, just another day in the life of your country cousins
[Hook: Talib]

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
In Brooklyn, New York I'm down with Lord Jamar
Back in P.A.T., man we be sippin the barre
I'm down with J. from Houston and I think it should be
But when I'm out in L.A. I fuck with Ice-T
Short Dog is my O.G., we been down forever
Taught me the game, lane to lane, and keep my pimpin' together
Niggas don't understand by far back in the day
It was Mase and then my brother put me up on Black Star
Starving blacks often lose our way
Cause we isolate ourselves and give our ghetto pass away
My niggas pass away in an unreal way
They mommas depleted, I'm just tryna make sure that their kids straight
I'm on the chitlin' tour with my mic in my hand
Shittin' on these jealous niggas in the new world clan
I wouldn't trade it for nothin, only a crazy man would
I represent for the whole South, but mainly just for my hood
The pimpin's good...

[Raheem DeVaughn]
I got cousins (I got cousins), country cousins (country cousins)
Like blood that's thicker than water (it's nothin), down dirty 'cross the border
I got cousins (I got cousins), country cousins (country cousins)
Like blood that's thicker than water (it's nothin), down dirty 'cross the border
They're my country cousins!"

Good Morning Viet-Com, I'm back
Huh, it's me again
Is it me you're looking for? (Yup)
For the perfect beat, sweetly oblique
I'm fresh, I come clean, but I can't whistle
Psss, I'm only buggin
While No dug in the crates, I dug in my nose
And picked a rhyme, any rhyme I don't have any time
To waste, I'm hip... don't even trip
To an easy travel agent now we fly for free
I can be fly for free
You want some fire tree, then buy from me
I got the flame like U-I-C but I be from U-A-C
Some of the realest illest chillest cats you may see
In your life if you get one
Rappers are like jobs to me (Why?) because they get done
Here it comes I'm as Able as Cain to get raw
That's why the DJ's mix me, I'm gonna bust dicks
This is not da bomb so save all your threats
I'm good to go and also I'm Rets
Rhymes I wrecks affects the roughnecks
Down to the preps in the Polos, the studs with fros
Hoes with weaves, the bald-headed to the dreaded
To folks with butters, high rollers in rollers
Players with plats, studs with stocking caps
I be rockin' raps 'til I collapse
Niggas play my tape about as much as they do craps
I'm on point, I cee-lo, I see high
Hi C, I'm free at last
I'm a free man, free as World B

What I look like, talkin' about some shit I ain't do?
I ain't shoot nobody, I ain't shank nobody, I ain't kill nobody

I'm tryin' to make dollars
My momma told me to go to school and be a scholar
But school ain't for me
So don't even go there, I'm comin' out of nowhere to go where
Probably in about seven years, I won't have no hair
But not only am I the Hair Club President, I'm also a client
I come off like a toupee, I still have to pay 2Pc Dark
A Raider that never Lost the Ark, on the shot
But now when I shoot rock, I be all out of breath
My boy Adefo wanted to be a chef
But he went down South, and fell in love, call me love
'Cause love is gonna getcha — I'mma getcha!
I'm like B.J., my Arm is Strong and I Stretch ya

So yeah, basically
A lot of people ask me how life was then
So here it is...

My old home smelled of good birth
Boiled red beans, kernel oil and hand me down poetry
It's brick white-washed walls widowed by first paint
The tin roof top humming songs of promise while time is
Locked into demonic rhythm with the leaves
The trees had to win
Hugging them, loving them a torturous love
Buggin' when
It was over and done
The round cemented pot kept the rain drops cool
Neighbors and dwellers spatter in the pool
Kids playin football with his hand and sock
We had what we got, and it wasn't a lot
No one knew they were poor
We were all innocent to greeze judgement
The country was combusting with life like a long hibernating volcano
With a long tale of success like J-Lo
Farmers, fishers, fighters, even fools had a place in production
The costal line was the place of seduction
The coral reef make you daze in reflection
The women walked with grace and perfection
And we just knew we were warriors too
Nothing morbid, it's true
We were glorious
BOOM!
[Verse 2]
Then one day it came
Spoiled up a ray like rain
Like oil in a flame, it pained
The heart attack sudden
Odder than eleven
Harder than a punch in the womb
Harder than the lunch you consume
For us, it had a cancerous fume, more lust
Men who made killing hoggies
Selling prout fully like healthy livestock
It made tides rock with a dilegent mock
Confused are the people, infused in the evil
Professed to eject like Jews in the sequel, to win
It came in the morning, with a warning and without
The hurting was a burden, only certain was doubt
A mythical tale, no soul knows well
Liberty went to hell, freedom called for shells
Fierce was the blow, keep your ears to the show
It appears Orwell was right in '84
Had big brother kill Mother in her store
With all of us watching, we didn't love her anymore

[Hook]
Peep my poem, Mother was my old home
Good will is looted - in my old home
Religion is burned down - in my old home
Kindness is shackled - in my old home
Justice has been raped - in my old home
Murderers hold post - in my old home
The land vomits ghosts - in my old home
[Verse 3]
We got pistols with eyes, corruption and lies
Trusting snakes, and death without breaks
Suspicious new borns live in our horn
Used to the pain, rack bodies not grain
Chopped limbs not trees
Spend lives not wealth
Seek vengance not truth, the craziest youth
Hoist pain not plans, nigga' fuck your parents

[Hook]
Bandits will beat us down - in my old home
Rumors are law now - in my old home
Sedatives of faith - in my old home
Rapists are praised - in my old home
Demons rest well - in my old home
Infants are nailed - in my old home
Spirits are jailed - in my old home
Grudges grow tails - in my old home

[Verse 4]
High roads of sea in electric haiden
Outward labor beneath stubborn faith
Our farms produce guilty grub and
Our kids depend on shifty luck, see
Our muse is life for death is old, so
Don't blame me for truth I told, say
[Hook]
Good will is looted - in my old home
Religion is burned down - in my old home
Kindness is shackled - in my old home
Justice has been raped - in my old home
Murderers hold post - in my old home
The land vomits ghosts - in my old home"
Fuck You Lucy,Atmosphere,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Women Singing]
It - leave - never - would - you - you - show - could - I - if

[Verse 1: Slug]
She say that she still wants a friendship
She can't live her life without me as a friend
I can't figure out why I give a damn to what she wants
I don't understand the now before the then
Most of this garbage I write that these people seem to like
Is about you and how I let you infect my life
And if they got to know you, I doubt that they would see it
They'd wonder what I showed you, how you could leave it
A friend in Chicago said that I should stay persistent
If I stay around I'm bound to break resistance
Fuck you, Lucy, for defining my existence
Fuck you and your differences
Ever since I was a young lad with a part-time dad
It was hard to find happiness inside of what I had
I studied my mother, I digested her pain
And vowed no women on my path would have to walk the same
Travel like sound across the fate ladder
I travel with spoon to mix this cake batter
And I travel with feel, so I can deal with touch
It's like that, thank you very much, fuck you very much
[Hook: Slug]
(Yes, yes it is)
And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
(Yes, yes it is)
And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love

[Verse 2: Slug]
Fuck the 'What happened?' I got stuck
They can peel pieces of me off the grill of her truck
Used to walk with luck, used to hold her hand
Fell behind and played the role of a slower man
I want to stand on top of this mountain and yell
I want to wake up and break up this lake of hell
I feel like a bitch for letting the sheet twist me up
The last star-fighter was wounded, time to give it up
On a pick it up mission, kept it bitter
Gettin' in a million memories just to forget her
The difficulty in keepin' emotions controlled
Cookies for the road, took me by the soul
Hunger for the drama, hunger for the nurture
Gonna take it further, the hurt feels like murder
Interpret the eyes, read the lines on her face
The sunshine is fake, how much time did I waste?
Fuck you, Lucy, for leaving me
Fuck you, Lucy, for not needing me
I wanna say fuck you because I still love you
No, I'm not okay, and I don't know what to do
[Hook]
(Yes, yes it is)
And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
(Yes, yes it is)
And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love

[Verse 3: Slug]
Do I sound mad? Well I guess I'm a little pissed
Every action has a point, five points make a fist
You close em', you swing em', it's hurts when it hits
And the truth can be a bitch, but if the boot fits
I got an idea, you should get a tattoo that says warning
That's all, just a warning, so the potential victim can take a left
And save breath, and avoid you, sober and upset in the morning
I wanna scream, ""Fuck you, Lucy""
But the problem is I love you, Lucy
So instead I'ma finish my drink and have another
While you think about how you used to be my lover

[Hook]
(Yes, yes it is)
And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
(Yes, yes it is)
And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love

My Songs,Atmosphere,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Random guy singing]
Throw your hands up in the air
And wave like you just don't care
Say, you deserve a break today
Oh yeah, work that body, work that body
Make sure you don't hurt nobody
Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear
Fuzzy wuzzy had no hair
Fuzzy wuzzy wasn't fuzzy, was he?
I like the party rock the body
You like the party want somebody
I sang too, listen to the song..

[Verse 1: Slug]
Sittin' on the steps, with ANT, that's my man
Flippin' pig-russian, discussin' politics and contraband
Karma cut me clean as if I asked for it
Seven travels offered states with a case and fake passport
I want to shelter everybody from the snakes
And my sleeves know a couple of tricks for huntin' breaks
(Ten thousand lakes) Multiple choice of where to drown
So I quote the voice, it goes ""What floats is what's found""
Gettin down like they did in the 7-2
With the red and blue, had the opportune to bless you
Before you knew about a phone bill
Before you had to hold still
Before the Kool-Aid got diluted with Golden Seal
I used to ride around this town on a dirtbike
Child touched stillato, wild stages just to earn stripes
Read my lips, act like you heard right
And keep an eye on your chick, I work my rubber like a turnpike
It ain't nothin' for me to come swing from your tree
I wear the love like a ring and I sing until it's free
What? You bringin the weed? We break a measure
And let the hook ride just to tie it all together
Whatever..
[Hook: Slug]
My life ain't as cool as your life
And more than likely I'll be stabbed in my sleep by your wife
So everybody stop askin' me whats wrong
And quit actin' like you don't know the words to my songs

[Verse 2: Slug]
And when the party starts, I'm in the corner actin' smart
Spittin' game at your girl, just to take your world apart
I hang with the secrets and the cats that paint pictures
While you sleepin on life and writin the same scriptures
(What you gonna take witcha?) I take it all but the fall
And when I'm sittin still you can blame the Benadryl and alcohol
As far as the stars are above the boulevard
I keep my feet on the tar, with the heat in the car
Keep the beats in a jar, wait for the time to unleash
And when it comes everybody only gets one a piece
You better learn the words before you try to quote 'em
I'm sittin' on mixed nuts, who wants to hold 'em?

[Hook: Slug]
My life ain't as cool as your life
And more than likely, I'll be stabbed in my sleep by your wife
So everybody stop askin' me whats wrong
And quit actin' like you don't know the words to my songs
[Verse 3: Slug]
Now let me get a collective amen (amen)
I put tame on the monsters the moment that I came in
I talk to the voices-- that speak through my headphones
Communicate the life while I decipher all the info
I got styles I ain't even heard yet...
Words like rain it came and left the earth wet
Let it drip-dry, focus eyes on the catalysts
Standin' high in the middle of SOUTH MINNEAPOLIS
They try to figure it out, they try to break it down
But they're distracted by every accent that's makin a sound
Grab it by the throat, lift it up and shake it 'round
Till this whole world sees me as a naked clown
And while I'm pullin on her bra, shes
Tuggin on my drawstring
Screamin' and shoutin to figure out how you lost me
Chewin up my cigarette and smokin' my gum
Out of respect for your boyfriend, I'll use my thumb
From the start to the done, I never claimed to be right
I quit sleepin, now the day looks the same as the night
And I'm the type of DJ that only plays what I like
A handful of mixed nuts, everyone's takin a bite..

My life ain't as cool as yours (3X)

[Hook: Slug]
My life ain't as cool as your life
And more than likely I'll be stabbed in my sleep by your wife
So everybody stop askin' me whats wrong
And quit actin' like you don't know the words to me songs
I'm alright, I'm just a little mixed up
I'm OK, I'm just a little mixed up
I'm alright, I'm just a little mixed up
I'm OK, I'm just a little mixed up
I'm alright, I'm just a little mixed up

Anything Can Happen,Wyclef Jean,"['hip hop', 'blues', 'jazz', 'r&b', 'pop']","[Intro]
I got the skully to my face (hardcore)
I got the skully to my face (hardcore)
'Cause anything can happen at the Carnival
(Yo make room, make room, make room, make love, make room)
You can't stop the shining
Yo, don't slip, Mike
You don't want to go there is all, trust me
I know your girl with you, but you don't want to get embarrassed
Trust me

[Chorus]
Yo, when you're rolling to the Carnival, anything can happen
What, what, say what, say what, anything can happen
Making love to your girlfriend, anything can happen
What? Say what, say what, anything can happen
She's sleeping with your best friend 'cause anything can happen
Wh-a-at? Say what, say what, anything can happen
You roll down the block, come back with your gat
And pow, 'cause anything can happen
[Verse 1]
Feel this composition, it's a brand new dub
First thing I did was went to the pub
Tequila with worm, lemon, salt, and no rocks
'Cause when it hits my chest, it gots to be hot
Uh haha, stop, 'Clef can I rock, yo
Get out the bathroom, let me go again from the top
Feel this composition, I wrote it in the tub
First thing I did, was went to the pub
Tequila with worm, lemon, salt, and no rocks
'Cause when it hits my chest, it gots to be hot
Ahhh, stop, 'Clef can I rock
I'd like to give a shout-out to my people on the block
For you, Silly Willy playing thug cartoon
My infrared scope got your movements on zoom
Boom new toon, write songs in my room
Sleeping with the bride even though I ain't the groom
Your husband assume, come back with his goons
Put me in the trunk on your way to your honeymoon
Radio my platoon, Wyclef to Sev'
'I hear them playing Elvis, they on they way to Graceland
But they don't scare me, I'm in the trunk, I ain't sorry
Natural born killer who slept with the enemy'
Think quick -- what should I do? What did double-oh-seven do?
I pulled a bomb from my shoe
And exploded the trunk; I woke up half-drunk
Overlooked by a bunch of gypsies wit a bag of skunk
[Chorus]
You got the skully to your face, star, anything can happen
What, what, say what, say what, anything can happen
Sellin crack in the corner, man, anything can happen
What? Say what, say what anything can happen
I just got laid off, anything can happen
What, what, say what, say what, anything can happen
You don't wanna go there, 'cause anything can happen
What, what, say what, say what, anything can happen

[Verse 2]
Ayo, anything can happen, you can't stop the shining
You looking at my watch, but my mind's really the diamond
Nine to the Seven, you better off stepping
When I'm writing with my pen, it turns into a lethal weapon (Ding!)
Take this lesson to your next session
I suggest, you practice with the freshman
Sophomore, junior, then come check the senior
By then I would have graduated from the school of ruckus
Wyclef and Jerry Wonder, last of the producers
If the royalty ain't right, I put a call to Donny Ienner
But always stay humble, went from bummy to neat
'Cause money break groups up like the Five Heartbeats
Don't get souped 'cause you pushing a coupe
Next year you on foot, running from a lawsuit
For example, I know I'm nice, I don't front it
Least anticipated to the most wanted
Yeah, that's me in the spotlight
With a mic and a guitar, like M.O.P., I like it raw
[Chorus]
Yo, when you're rolling to the Carnival, anything can happen
What, what, say what, say what, anything can happen
Every man got disciples, anything can happen
What, what, say what, say what, anything can happen
Its all about survival man, anything can happen
Hah, say what, say what, anything can happen
You looking at me wrong, man, anything can happen
What, what, say what, say what, anything can happen

[Outro]
Will the Knicks win the championship this year?
Say what, say what, anything can happen
Will we find some peace of mind this year?
Say what, say what, anything can happen
You ready for the revolution this year?
Say what, say what, anything can happen
Will you make love with no condom this year?
No no, no no, that will never happen
The record is not over yet
The record is not over yet
The record is not over yet
Where the ladies at? Put yo' hands in the air!
And for the ladies, we won't play you
If you proud, shake what yo mama gave you, hey!
Whether your fat or slim, bubble your ting
Fellas if you need help, use ginseng
And for the ladies, we won't play you
If you fat, shake what yo mama gave you, hey!
Whether your fat or slim, bubble your ting
Refugee thugs hang at the roller rink
Roller skating, baby
Carnival (Make room, for the Carnival, make room)
And it don't, nine-seven to infinity
Rest in Peace, Rest in Peace

Oh, he, only talk about weed and counting loot
But what the fuck did you expect? That's what I like to do
Shit on your best outfit
And I'm on my old school Harlem, best-out shit
Who house this? I'm in your fridge about to fix a plate
Feet all over your table like I own the place
On my Calvin shit
Slide your sister, show your brother cheese
Like ""Sorry Ms. Billups, we going out to eat""

Cause opinions are like Facebook, everybody got one

I hate a nigga trying to give advice
Talking that killer shit and he don't live that life
Focus up, don't fuck up your day shift
Go ahead and miss me with that ""back-in-the-day"" shit

You look like a fucking bitch in heat
And if you get raped by a pack of niggers it'll be your fault. All right?
That's my fucking mistake, because I should've woke you up and said, 'fucking blow me, bitch.'
I should've fucking woken you up and said 'blow me.' You would've liked that better, yeah?

It could a Cartier or a Rolex
Presidential threat to magary
Hang tight yes I can tell by the heartbeat
And you can probably take a pretty chick from a party
But guess what? Time don't wait for no man
Upside down from no sand, it won't slow down
It's going, it's going 'till it's gone
It feels right 'till you notice that it's gone
So why can't we all get along?
It's peace whenever I turn the mic on
It's beef whenever I turn to violence
It's deep in the east, I'm deep in the beats
Cause I wanna sleep on the beach and see my nephew see 23
Am I easily pleased? Um, I just wanna clean up my community
And throw a party for the whole street hardly asking for a whole leap
It's deeper than music, it's a movement, now sing along to it

See I made the news when my gig got pulled
Same show next year, no violence at all
But no more rap breaks and academies
But I'd like to see them shut down McD's
Cause they shootin', nah, made you look
Give a stage and a page from a check book
Did use a few G's to the police
Just to put a show on for the fans to see, so
If you listening I'll spit the lyric
In N.W.A style and start killin' 'em
Nah I just wanna make them see
Spit my verses, say my piece
Get off my back, it'll make my sleep
A hell of a lot easier this week
Cause time at the present, life is a lesson
I'm still learning, trying for perfection
I'm still giving you fire on the record
The vinyl's like Ryan Hughes fireballs
Yes I've got the road, the world's my oyster, I want the globe

Sarah,"Tyler, The Creator","['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
I like my girls skinny with brains
I like my hoodies fucked with Lame
I like my friends imaginary with no names
And I make music for the fuck of it, no fame
Aim, shoot, the gun of love, round
Tried to find ammo but it's none around town
So I went Down South but I ended up North
Uptown sitting on Cloud 9's white porch
And of course, my car's off course
You're so white, my blinkers don't work
I'm trying to let the force be with you, I get you
Music is my first, but I contemplate divorce (Damn)
You make a nigga sing songs nice
You make a nigga's night turn day
And you make the flowers sing say turn green yellow
It sucks that I didn't get the chance to say hello (Hi)
I want to eat you out like jello
And mess with your body like the bass and the cello
And tell your mom I said hello, you want to go to prom with–? (Nigga, hell no!)
Fuck (Shit!) and another one, there goes another one
[Chorus]
Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss
Well maybe Cupid won't miss (Blaow!)
Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss
Well maybe Cupid won't miss (Blaow!)

[Bridge]
Maybe? (No)
Maybe? (I'm sorry)
Maybe? (I got a date)
Maybe? (Where's your dad?)

[Verse 2]
I like her L-I-K-E, the only difference is she won't fuck with me
But she will fuck with that vegetable with the hairs full of X's and O's
I want to tie her body up and throw her in my basement
Keep her there, so nobody can wonder where her face went

- Tyler, what are you doing?
- Shut the fuck up!
- Uh-umm...
- Shut the fuck- You gon'- You gon' fuckin' love me bitch
- Uhh..
- Or I'mma fuckin' put this gun in your fuckin' head
But all I really want is a kiss on the cheek
In private, not public in the streets
And your cupcake I would eat and your toes
Cause I got a big fetish with the feet
I just want somebody I can see
You can be a gold digger, you ain't got to love me
I'm serious (I love you) I don't ask for much
Your heart literally is what I do want for lunch (Help me!)
Now this shit is turning to a habit
I'm the burger king, I gotta have it my way
And truthfully girl you really make my day
I would probably kill myself if you told me you was gay
And I can't even look the other way
Your aura is a magnet, my eyes a metal bag, it's attractive
L-O-L laughing, you're a gold Oscar and I'm just actin'
And I want your cinema hole, and have our kids play supporting role
Climbing up the pole, Jack and the Beanstalk, bitch it's gold
And I was in loath, I would never get over you (Help me! Help me!), ever, Sarah

[Chorus]
Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss
Well maybe Cupid won't miss (Blaow!)
(Maybe) Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss
Well maybe Cupid won't miss (Blaow!)
[Skit]
You're my lady, you taste so good (Oh no!)
You're my lady, be my lady (Oh no!)
You'll be with me forever (Oh no, blaow!)
I love you, so much (Oh no!)

[Verse 3]
Half your body laying on my chest
The rest is in my stomach, that's including your breast
And I'ma just take another guess
Now you probably wishing that you would have said yes
Am I crazy? Maybe
But fucked up is how I been lately
Shit, I don't give a fuck
Your family looking for you, wish 'em good luck
Bitch, you tried to play me like a dummy
Now you stuck up in my mothafuckin' basement all bloody
And I'm fucking your dead body, your coochie all cummy
Looking in your dead eyes, what the fuck you want from me?
What did you want from me?
What did you want from me?

[Outro]
(Police!)
I gave you everything
(Police!)
But, I guess I wasn't the one

Drop it
You want me to just go in?
Alright
Uh...

[Verse 1: Tyler the Creator]
My window is a book and I'm a fuckin' crook
Stealin' phones to call home but the line is off the hook
And if my mother answer
I'll ask her what she wants on 25th because I'm chillin' with Prancer
Rudolph, Adolf, Hitler
Rollin' with nineteen 88s like it's 1988
But my speakers are bleedin', the doctor's in uniform
Fuck cars, I have a damn unicorn that flies me to places
With spaceships, that don't need money
Where I can free at hand eat candy with Easter bunnies
Where donuts equal water, inhalers and mushrooms
And we don't have cars, we have balloons and we zoom—
Through sound and the bass is astounding
The snare plays square, no rounding
Major-ninth chords, tower synth like it's Yao Ming, Kobe
Imaginary friends, fuck homies, they don't know me
The tooth fairy blow me, swallow, don't shit this
With my Donald Trump hairpiece, you're an apprentice
You're fired and tired, you can't stay up like a limp dick
If you think you can spit, then I am the fucking dentist
My visions that I record, the instruments I adore
The happiness that I hoard can't be bought at liquor stores
You faggots can buy our chains but you [?]
And they sold on hate and reality that I ignore
You can try to walk inside my brain but I close the door
Fuck dogs, I roll around with my pet dinosaur

Dinosaur
Yeah

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
Fuck dogs, walk around with a pet dinosaur
Wing flaps on the back of my pet rhinosaur
Gold chain, 24, niggas must be shinin' more
The money gets closer when you seem to be grinding more
And it feels better than a tongue-kiss
Carbonated with the flow, orange-flavored Sunkist
We musically grow unto the world like a fungus
Amongst this, playin' the piano like a trumpet
Little guy, but his words sound so humongous
Eat 'til you obese, arteries clot, need lunges
MellowHype from Ralph Lauren to the Hundreds
My crew cliqued up like Brady Bunches
The captain that crunches, invitin' you to lunches
My nutrition have robots malfunction
I suggest you stay away from the factory
My breath chemical, I don't know how you'll react to me
It's a dog-eat-dog world, so I double doggy dare it
Hold it in my hand as I stare it
Down, like a magnifying glass to a diamond with a karat
I read through niggas that bluff like a tarot
They copy my actions, I call them fools parrots
I'm the pirate with one eyelid that weareth
Long hair for wisdom while bitchmades Nair it
I don't care if the heat I throw is unbeara—
Ble, Just know, it's sharea—ble
And there I go, where I go
I don't know, obviously, I disappear
Close your eyes, bitch, I'm all in your ear
I have your hearts as if I stabbed it with a spear
And wrote my flows with your blood smears
If you can't see a legend, I'ma make it clear
Nigga, I'm right here

Sumthin U Should Know,Freddie Gibbs,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","3x
[Hey bitch, fuck with me, what's up?]

[Verse 1]
Your bitch wanna fuck with Gibbs
Straight dick off in the ribs
Got her trickin off chips
On expensive trips just to see the kid
Never been the one to miss no hoes
Watch how the OG's pimp on hoes
I was in it for the rank and the disco hoes
Way back when a nigga couldn't get no hoes, I
Gotta step my game up
Lifted my frame up
Twenty-four's on the cut
Make hoes wanna fuck
When I turn that bang up
These hoes in the game wanna get saved
But a pimp like me got to get paid
Pull em to the side, gotta check they age
Keep it real with em when they come backstage
[Hook]
Baby yo there's something you should know
I don't really spend time on no ho
I just wanna hit that ass and go
I don't give a fuck about you

Bitch if you ain't with it hit the door
Let a nigga sit back puff his dro
Watch the panties hit the floor

[Verse 2][Devin the Dude]
I don't really care bout no bitches
I'm on my business
It costs to keep my attention
If they trippin, I dismiss em
It's not a flaw in my pimpin', no sir
Fuck a bitch, pimp a ho, get your dough up
Penthouse, top floor, let's go up
Got a fat sack of dro we can roll up
Hey bitch, fuck with me, what's up

[Hook] X2
Baby yo, there's something you should know
Is there somewhere we should go?
We can keep it on the low (I just wanna show you)
How we lay this pimpin' down fo sho
Put that hustle on the ho
Let the panties hit the floor
[Verse 3]
What it is, what it gon be?
I got a broad on the phone, G
Chilling with a homie
And I know that it's a goddamn shame
That they all on me
Wanna give me that monkey
I'mma flip some dough instead
Keep pimpin', stack that bread
All I gotta do is get a bitch fed
Then I get em in the bed
And I'm all in they head
Big dough, I'm stackin' it
My pimpin' is immaculate
And I just might have to smack a bitch
If my figures ain't accurate
You treat these hoes, I cheat these hoes
I fuck soon as I meet these hoes
Then I take em to the room
And I get a little womb
And I straight dip off and leave these hoes
Got a couple in the Chi, got a couple in the D
Got a bitch in Minnesota
Got a ho in Ohio that hold that dough and whip that yola
Niggas out G, I stay midwest pimpin'
That's what we be bout
Midwest pimpin' on the east, midwest pimpin' in the south
I got a bitch in LA that think she too famous to turn a trick
But I know the ho will let a nigga put a dick in her anus to pay the rent
These hoes don't give a fuck
Anything for another quick buck
Bitch hop off in this truck
Is you fuckin' with me what's up?
2x[Hook]

You can ride with me
Slide with me
And vibe with me
Get high with me
We can go wherever you want to go
Continue to get throwed
But there's something you should know

I do know one thing though
Bitches they come, they go

Monday through Sunday ho"

Give us the coke, the cash, the combo to the safe
Oh, she don't know it? Damn, okay, we'll wait
I play with your kid on the couch, while your bitch on the phone
With a gun to her head sayin' ""daddy come home""

In the hood shit is lovely until it go bad
Now you can pray for a miracle and God might be hearin' you
And the nine will jam right in my hand

I got his homies screamin' Buck you need to calm down
Niggas be gettin' killed everytime you come around
We ran up in his crib, made his momma kiss the ground
She askin' ""God, what my baby done did now?""
I'm takin' everything, jewellery I want it all
Duct tape him up, rip the phone cords out the wall (Gimme that)
Fuck waitin' we gon' starve waitin' on tomorrow
So ask Satan if he got a car that I can borrow
I'm impatient like a money hungry rap star
I jack him for his chain and I can get a new Jaguar
The mack'lI have his brains all over the fuckin' sidewalk
And I'ma be on CNN again, it ain't my fault
March nigga step, right nigga left

Darling we can make a album, let's make a album
Shorty what you think about it, think about it
Me and you can make a album, make a album
Shorty we can make a album, let's make a album
Darling we can make a album (haha) ..Yea

Professor Booty,Beastie Boys,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
""Yo I don't hang out with those guys, man, I ain't got nothing to do with those dudes.""
""Wait a minute, I saw your female with 'em, too. What's up with her? I've been hearin' that she been givin' that stuff out to ALL them graffiti guys.""
""Yo, shut the fuck up, Chico, man!""
""I could paint three of those murals for some of that ass.""

""Professor, what's another word for 'pirate treasure'?""
""Well, I think it's 'booty'. Booty, booty, that's what it is.""

[Adrock]
Yes, I got more bounce than the fucking bump
And then you want to know why
Because I'm motherfuckin' truckin'
I'm in the pocket just like Grady Tate
Got supplies of beats so you don't have to wait
Cause I'm the master blaster, drinking up the Shasta
My voice sounds sweet cause it has to
So light a match to my ass cause I'm blowin' up
I'd like to thank the people for just showin' up
But now I want y'all to move it
Put your point on the floor and just prove it
And I'm smurfin', not rehearsin', gettin' live, y'all
A little puffy, so you know what, I'm doin' right
Cause that's the kind of frame of mind I'm in
I got this feelin' that it's back again
So don't touch me, cause I'm electric
And if you touch me, you'll get shocked
[Mike D]
You got, you got, you got, you got, you got
You've got the boomin' system, but it's sloshing out doo-doo
You think it's chocolate milk, but it's watered down Yoo-hoo
I've been through many times in which I thought I might lose it
The only thing that saved me, has always been music
We've got our own studio, the Son of the G
It's no question, life's been good to me
Cause life ain't nothing but a good groove
A good mixtape to put ya in the right mood
This one goes out to my man, the Groove Merchant
Coming through with beats for which I've been searching
Like two sealed copies, of expansions
I'm like Tom Vu with yachts and mansions
The logo I sport is the face of the monkey
Union made, Ben Davis-quality, it's no junk, see?
My chrome is shining, just like an icicle
I ride around town on my low-rider bicycle

[MCA]
So many wack emcees, you get the TV bozak
Ain't even gonna call out your names, cause you're so wack
And one big oaf, who's faker than plastic
A dictionary definition of the word spastic
You should have never started something that you couldn't finish
Cause writin' rhymes to me is like Popeye to spinach
I'm bad ass, move ya fat ass, cause you're wack, son
Dancing around like you think you're Janet Jackson
Thought you could walk on me to get some ground to walk on
I'll put the rug out under your ass as I talk on
I'll take you out like a sniper on a roof
Like an emcee at the fever in the DJ booth
With your headphones strapped, you're rockin' rewind/pause
Tryin' to figure out what you can do to go for yours
But like a pencil to the paper, I got more to come
One after another, you can all get some
So you better take your time and meditate on your rhyme
Cause your shit'll be stinkin' when I go for mine
And that's right, y'all, don't get uptight, y'all
You can't say shit because you're biting what I write, y'all
And that's wrong, y'all, over the long haul
You can't cut the mustard when you're fronting it all
(it all, it all, it all…)"

Float, no water, my trunk is waving, I'm polar surfing
Blowing faces, I'm shitting on the diamond infested
Time is money, peep the wrist bitch, my time's invested
I'm still the king and I'm thugged out
Any block, any club I flood it out
I ain't one for competition I'mma blow it out
I'm going hard I don't even plan on going out
I get money probably something you don't know about
I stunt hard, you would swear that I was showing out
Don't tell me get 'em, I got 'em and I'mma throw 'em out
And back door on these hoes that I was rolling out
While I'm in this machine, convert the top
Tell them that the sky is the limit
With a foreign freak, she got her face in my lap
So deep you would think that she was hiding in it

Shrimp, steak liquor and pasta
Real shit boy, these niggas imposters

Counting 7 digits no wonder why the money calling
Got ya bitch panties Niagara falling
Dollars come like I fuck in the bank

Four with the right, then eight times with both
Then repeat"" Ah... Clap your hands...

[Chorus]
Body movin', body movin'
A1 sound, and the sound's so soothing
Body movin', body movin'
We be getting down and you know we're Krush Groovin'

[Verse 1]
Now, let me get some action from the back section
We need body rockin' not perfection
Let your backbone flip but don't slip a disc
And let your spine unwind — just take a risk
I wanna' do the freak until the break of dawn
Tell me party people, is that so wrong?
The ship is docking, interlockin'
And up-rockin', electro-shocking
We're getting down, computer action
Do the robotic satisfaction
Now all of y'all, get off the wall
Have a ball and get involved with

Flame on, I'm gone
I'm so sweet like a nice bonbon
Came out rapping when I was born
Mom said rock it 'til the break of dawn
Puttin' bodies in motion 'cause I got the notion
Like Roy Cormier with the coconut lotion
The sound of the music makin' you insane
You can't explain to people this type of mind frame
Like a bottle of Châteauneuf-du-Pape
I'm fine like wine when I start to rap
We need body-rockin', not perfection
Let me get some action from the back section

A1 sound, and the sound's so soothing
Body movin', body movin'
We be getting down and you know we're Krush Groovin'

Mike D, with the master plan
I said, Ooh my-my and thank you, ma'am
And when I grab the mic, you scream, ""Ooh, goddamn""
The crème de la crème is who I am
MCA, where have you been?
Packed like sardines in the tin
So kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins
'Cause when it comes to quarries I'm known to swim
And Adrock, light up the place
And if you pull my card, you pull the ace
And if you ask me, turn up the bass
And if you play defender
I could be your hyperspace... So

Body movin', body movin'
A1 sound, and the sound's so soothing
Body movin', body movin'
We be getting down and you know we're Krush Groovin'

Four left, four right, two left, two right, the one each
Left right, left right. Start and land on the balls of the feet
Left foot... Ready? It's one two three four five"""
Live Forever,Shad,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Dallas Green]
The time will come when we are all condemned for what we've done
The time will come

[Verse 1: Shad]
I say the times begun to pay for our crimes no time to run
It's sundown these days are the final ones
Looking dumbfounded staring in the eye of a gun
And we all scared to die we all fear the pallbearer
All scared to cry we all fear our salt tears
But why when we live it's so miserable
Can't get along why is forgiving so difficult
Why we live alone, what we living for is critical
Someone give some hope that's breath for our living souls
Even if your physical can't breathe stand up and lead
Me and my band of brothers advance under siege
Move towards the future the commander and chief
Plant a flag on this soul call if land of the free
Every day both rich and poor wonder what we living for

[Hook: Dallas Green]
We're gonna live forever
(What we gonna live for)
We're gonna live forever
(What we gonna live for)
We're gonna live forever
(What we gonna live for)
We're gonna live forever
(What we gonna live for)
We're gonna live
We're gonna live
[Verse 2: Shad]
You never know how your legend's gonna grow later
When we go it's our ghost that they are so afraid of
I try to flow greater cause most conscience sold food for thoughts
Like tofu: no flavor
So when I roll through it's so smooth like a pro skater
Or a boat cruise bringing change toll booth
Player thought they told you I'm old school
Student of the game let me show you a whole new grade up
All my single ladies here's a couple lines
Love takes two people love one mind
Here's one year if you give it six months
You only live once this is double time
Essentially bring the energy of Busta Rhymes
Soul doesn't die like Curtis on touch the sky

[Bridge: Dallas Green]
And when the smoke finally clears we're gonna rise above the ash
We're gonna live
We're gonna live
We're gonna live forever
(What we gonna live for)

[Hook]

[Breakdown: Shad]
Like this
I can't sweat trying to make the coolest impression
Trying to get power is a foolish obsession
Why use talent as a tool for oppression
A real king ain't got to rule with a weapon
Dog what if we went to school for possession instead of jail
They say to stop the crazy talk Shad we never will
I guess I still believe love can never fail
Cross eyes on heaven looking crazy as hell
Maybe I dwell too much on legacy, destiny
Like I could ever read whats on the headstone ahead of me
But in my head I see we are carving the letters
Everyday that thought makes me work hard for the better
The truth comes out but it starts at the center
The heart of the matter is a matter of the heart
The heart's made of matter that you can't measure
That matters beyond measure like light when it travels in the dark"
Stuck In The Moment,Joe Budden,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro - Joe Budden - talking] (*echo*)
How's everybody feeling out there?
Y'all good?
I wanna thank everybody for coming out
Sharing this moment with a nigga
It means more to me than it can to anybody else
Trust me (talk to 'em)

[Verse 1 - Joe Budden]
Check it, When the night falls and the smoke clears
Millions of miles away, yet they so near (uh)
I remember memories, so I'm never lead astray
When tomorrow comes I know it's only due to yesterday
Without a boundary (uh), check my latitude
New attitude, see I'm grateful for having gratitude
I'm not complacent (but), but got no regrets
Few hating niggas wanna see me regress
Deep breath, life is too short for me to be stressed
Interpret ice grilling as their way of saying he's blessed
You wanna hate, I got my own show, be my guest
Remember doctors used to tell me I was depressed
At the time was dating a model with double D chest
I thought, 'til she laughed that shit off and said these's F's
Before I bought my first gun, was already armed
Teach you about couth, little bit of class, heavy charm
Used to give my last, for a nice chain, heavy charm
High school dropout but went to every prom (talk to 'em)
Now everyone I went to high school with
Now they thirty years plus still on some high school shit (talk to 'em)
Seems like all the fly niggas and bitches that was well off (now they)
Is junk head high niggas, all the bitches fell off
From surgery, rapping for niggas that never heard of me (uh)
Burglaries, dapping up niggas that want to murder me (uh)
If you close minded, I call that an emergency
Blind fold yourself as if there's nothing more to further see (ta ha)
Honestly that's absurd to me
If the sky is the limit, then where's the urgency? (me?)
I embrace life (ta ha), I'm so carefree
But I won't judge y'all, if you don't care to be (uh)
Just know no matter who you are (what?)
The right system (it'll), turn a role player to a superstar (oh!)
I'm talking rock bottom, a whole 'nother tier
Stuck in the moment made me move through a whole 'nother year
How'd I become straight forward?
No baggage, y'all can run from the past, I'm a make my way towards it
Like (ta ha), nigga I remember stage fright
Back when I ain't know if I could rock the stage right
Who knew I'd end up being the nicest?
My point, hard to come up short when shit is priceless (ta ha, uh)
Hard to come up short when shit is priceless (oh!)
[Hook � Emanny] - w/ Joe Budden ad libs
I can't explain it, I just gotta embrace it
That something got me feeling this way, yeah
Instead of running, I'm waiting here for it
Cause nothing ever been this great
I'm stuck in the moment
Stuck in the moment, the moment
Stuck in the moment, the moment
I'm stuck in the moment
Stuck in the moment, the moment
Stuck in the moment, the moment
I'm stuck in the moment

[Verse 2 - Joe Budden]
I say this with all certainty, people wanting the worst for me
Got to wait in a long line, it's not a first for me
Most of my defects have been put in my past
If you only see what I have, then you overlooking my path
If you knew about my hardships and the bloodshed
It'll speak for itself (trust me) and that's enough said
I carry heavy weight, who wanna try and bear it?
Hope to lessen it daily, if you wonder why I share it
Being stuck in that moment never appealed to me
You ain't live my life, so you can't imagine how real it be
I'm talking about the long haul
Put me on a high pedestal (then you), better be prepared to watch a long fall
(So) So the trampoline I adore
Got so much to say to the people I ignore
Dog, some moments you rather forget because they scare you
I lock onto them shits like a pit, they just prepare you
Photographic memory of deja-vu
The way I do, whatever I say I do
Nigga built Ford Tough, show facades what talent is (you could)
Get a different V, you ain't got to Dodge Challenges (oh!)
Emotional Roller-coaster, Vivian Green
Every event led to living a dream (or), or do I live in a dream?
Where there's no such thing as a crisis
My point, can't come up short when shit is priceless (oh!)
[Hook]

[Break - Emanny]
I've been through the struggle, been through the hustle
But never did it bring me down
I don't know where I'm going
But all I know is, I'm stuck in the moment
Maybe I've been, here before
But I don't see no need to change it
Don't know what life has in store
But I'm prepared to embrace it

Wrong Place,Del The Funky Homosapien,"['hip hop', 'blues', 'jazz', 'r&b', 'pop']","[Verse 1]
I writes rhymes for rehearsal
But first, chill, I gotta little story to tell ya
How I almost caught a...bad one
Add one to the list of 2,001 stupid things to do
I had crew when they stepped at a party
Hardly even known I own a Smith & Wesson but it's restin' at home
In a shoe box, they see crews jock
So they wanna step and take the rep I got
I said, ""Wait a second"", check inside my coat for a shank
They must be imaginin' that I'm money in the bank
They'll get spanked
'Cause I'm not the nigga
I got bigger brothers waiting in the bushes to mush kids
I talk when I wanna talk, never silence
Violence erupts when I clown ya, catch a beat down, yeah
'Cause I never back away from niggas
Even if you gotta pistol, I dare ya pull the trigger
But that's suicide, either you must die or I must, so why bust me?
'Cause I'm guilty of being in the wrong place at the wrong time
Comin' at ya in the wrong state of mind
I'm, out in a hurry, a pow and a flurry
Of bullets come speedin' by, I needn't die
I gotta make tracks and take back my words
I eat 'em 'cause everybody knows I didn't beat 'em

I'm out on the town, I don't frown at people
'Cause they tend to get offended and then the heat will
Be on my ass, I got class, never out of line
'Cause I'm standing here without a nine
Pistols I wish will not blast me
Task be, circlin' corners lookin' for Warners
You know, the Brothers, me and you
We didn't do shit but we get hassled because we crew
And we rollin', this is my car, it isn't stolen
I hope you catch a slug, straight in your colon
When ya walkin' the beat
I bet ya got a sheet hangin' up in ya closet
Fuck this law shit
But there's two laws to follow, you know
There is the laws of the city and the laws of the ghetto
I go to clubs with a smile on my face
Just in case niggas look and wanna wild in the place
'Cause of jealousy, well, it's me, only me
Niggas walkin' in poppin' shit, that's who the phonies be
Peep it one night and you'll see it it's quite clear
Since we all know now that's why we're
Never in the wrong place at the wrong time!

[Verse 3]
Damn, I hate cops!
I need to bust they chops
Always gettin' props for the niggas they pop
Peep, I smoke weed get weeded
'Cause I need it to calm my nerves before a pig get bleeded
I got busted for less than a gram of hash
They wanna cram my ass in the slammer
Punk po-po
Bringin' back hash from Amsterdam is a no-no
I didn't know they would catch me, punk mutt fetch me
Stretched me out at Customs, gotta bust 'em
I can't call it, they found it in my wallet
Now Customs got me and I just can't stall it
I wish they would leave me alone
Dog lookin' at me like ""feed me a bone""
He might bite me, very likely
They had to strike me with a fine or time
I said “Fine!”
Mines was 500 bones
For a gram of hash, my mind was blown
Come back to Michigan, so we can bitch again
Federal offense, now I better go and convince the judge
