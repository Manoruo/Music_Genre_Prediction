We Fly High Remix,Jim Jones,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Zukhan]

[Intro: Jim Jones]
I wear a mean dark pair of shades
(You know we can't have one of nuthin')
And you can't see my eyes (so we had to double up)
Unless my head is bent, you dig
Dipset (Remix)

[Hook: Jim Jones]
We fly high, no lie, you know this (Ballin')
Foreign rides, outside, it's like showbiz (Ladies)
We stay fly, no lie, and you know this (Remix)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
(Jones) He/She, blowticious (Birdcall!)
Lamborghini, is audicious (Flossin!)
From Harlem to Hollywood, I'm still hood (yup!)
500 horses stuffed in my Ferrari hood (Speedin!)
Fuck-niggas talk about MC's on da hills
Hip-Hop is dead, so Killa gave me the wheel (Flea!)
Black cards fever get these niggas feelin' ill (Ill!)
It's hot fo' now, niggas givin' out deals (Ballin!)
(It's all about the Benjamin's baby)
I'm flyin' up Lenox in the Bentley, all crazy (Check!)
The roof topless, I'm showin' my ass (Uh-huh!)
I brought New York back, you niggas ain't got a chance (Remix!)
[Hook: Jim Jones]

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I ain't gon' lie, I'm fucked up, Phil died and we all sad
Only thing get us by now, and that's to ball, dad
5 mil on the crib, 50 on the dogtag
Cracks in the deal, that's 20 mil, I done gone mad
Naw I had to gon' grab the Spyda at the red light
Blue fluorescent headlight, ya betta get ya bread right
You ain't a balla, you chase checks, I check right
Even when it's dark outside, I bet my neck bright

[Verse 3: Diddy]
Ayo hold up, pick a restaurant, Chows or Chin Chin
Now pick a car, which one I ain't been in?
Pick a watch, as long as the hand spinnin'
Pick a actress, which one I ain't swim in
(What about the bride?) The yacht's still on deck
Retirement plan, I dropped it on her neck
I'm still spendin' ol' money
Benjamin's Remix, 10 year ago money muthafuckas

[Hook: Jim Jones]

[Verse 4: Juelz Santana]
Now girl I don't mean to be an agitator
But when I get movin' I'm a smooth operator
Ay, money ain't a thing, that's why I spend it
Ya cars like ya home, everthing rented
I'll buy your building, you'll be my tenant
My money comes fast just like a leopard
I'm about my green, no it ain't tennis
Play wit' my green, I'll become ya dentist
I'll swing that tool around
Then begin the root canal, Blaow
(Dipset) Boy you don't wanna start it here
Only time y'all dudes ball is in a barber's chair
Baldheads, I'm taking rock and roll to another level
Iced-out skull heads
[Verse 5: Birdman]
500 on the Bentley, 50 G's on the caddy
100 G's on my ho, cuz we both livin' lavished
Doin' my thang with this uptown swang
Niggas get it how we live like money ain't a thang (Ballin!)
Stuntin' on dem thangs, every time you see my swagger
Every time you see me hang, best believe I got that thang
Pop up at da club, niggas show them hoes love
Cuz they know we make it rain, so they show a gangsta love

[Verse 6: Young Dro]
Look like I'm skatin' on ice like Kristi Yamaguchi
Sittin' up in the Chevy eatin' BlowFish Sushi
550 mint-colored Benz, me and Jim
Wit' the Band Camp Twins and they blowin' our fluties
Hell Rell block, so you know we gettin' kufis
Iceberg drop nigga now I'm ridin' goofy
28 inches in the air, know I'm ballin'
Cuz my whole wrist pink and my neck kinda bluey, Dro

[Hook: Jim Jones]

[Outro: Jim Jones]
You've just been included in the Ballaz Extravaganza
You are now a Ballaholic, just like my team (Dipset)
Shout-outs to Diddy, T.I., Birdman, Dro (Whoa)
It's like showbiz

The 6th Sense,Common,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Common]
The revolution will not be televised
The revolution is here
Yeah, it's Common Sense, with DJ Premier
We gonna help y'all see clear
It's real hip-hop music, from the soul, y'all
Yeah, check it, yo

[Verse 1: Common]
The perseverance of a rebel I drop heavier levels
It's unseen or heard, a king with words
Can't knock the hustle, but I've seen street dreams deferred
Dark spots in my mind where the scene occurred
Some say I'm too deep, I'm in too deep to sleep
Through me, Muhammad will forever speak
Greet brothers with handshakes on ghetto landscapes
Where a man is determined by how much a man make
Cop Cognacs and spit old raps with young cats
With cigarettes in their ear, niggerish they appear
Under the Fubu is a guru, that's untapped
Want to be in the rap race but ain't ran one lap
Ran so far from the streets that you can't come back
You tripping with nowhere to unpack, forgot that
[Chorus: Bilal & Prodigy]
""This is rap for real, something you feel""
And you know, yes you know
""This is rap for the black people""
Heeeeyyyy, heeeeeyyyy
""This is rap- This is rap for real""
And you know, yes you know
""This is rap for the black people""

[Verse 2]
In front of two-inch glass and Arabs I order fries
Inspiration when I write, I see my daughter's eyes
I'm the truth, across the table from corporate lies
Immortalized by the realness I bring to it
If revolution had a movie I'd be theme music
My music, you either fight, fuck, or dream to it
My life is one big rhyme, I try to scheme through it
Through my shell, never knew what the divine would bring to it
I'd be lying if I said I didn't want millions
More than money saved, I wanna save children
Dealing with alcoholism and afrocentricity
A complex man drawn off of simplicity
Reality is frisking me
This industry will make you lose intensity
The Common Sense in me remembers the basement
I'm Morpheus in this hip-hop Matrix, exposing fake shit
[Chorus: Bilal & Prodigy]
And you know, yes you know
""This is rap for real, something you feel""
And you know, yes you know
""This is rap for the black people""
Heeeeyyyy, heeeeeyyyy
""This is rap- This is rap for real""
And you know, yes you know
""This is rap for the black people""

[Verse 3]
Some days I take the L to gel with the real world
Got on at 87th, sat by this little girl
She recited raps, I forgot where they was from
In 'em, she was saying how she make brothers cum
I start thinking, how many souls hip-hop has affected
How many dead folks this art resurrected
How many nations this culture connected
Who am I to judge one's perspective?
Though some of that shit y'all bop to it, I ain't relating
If I don't like it, I don't like it, that don't mean that I'm hating
I just want to innovate and stimulate minds
Travel the world and penetrate the times
Escape through rhythms in search of peace and wisdom
Raps are smoke signals letting the streets know I'm with 'em
For now I appreciate this moment in time
Ball players and actors be knowing my rhymes, it's like
[Chorus & Outro: Bilal & Prodigy]
And you know, yes you know
""Thi- This is rap for real, something you feel""
And you know, yes you know
""Thi- This is rap for real, something you feel""
Heeeeyyyy, heeeeeyyyy
""This is rap- This is rap for real""
And you know, yes you know
""This is rap for the black people""
And you know, yes you know
""This is rap"" ""Co- Co- Com' sense""
And you know, yes you know
""Thi- This is rap for real, something you feel""
Heeeeyyyy, heeeeeyyyy
""This is rap- This is rap for real""
And you know, yes you know
""This is rap for real, something you feel""
You knooow, and you knoooooow
Yeah, ooohowoooo
Yeaahhh

[Skit: Common & Female Fan]
Oh, excuse me, Common?
Yeah, yeah?
Oh my goodness. Um, I'm sorry- I'm sorry to bother you. I just wanted- you know, if I could get your autograph. And I just wanted to tell you- I just wanted to thank you because your lyrics are so positive for the women out here—
Yeah, I appreciate that, I appreciate that, sister. You know, it's like I think we gotta portray women in a better light. You know how- you know most rappers is talking all this other stuff, making women look bad. You know, I was raised by my mother. You know, I got a daughter, so it's like-
Wait, 'scuse me- hold on- hold on- 'scuse me, one second, sister- 'scuse me, one second, sister—
Bitch! Bitch, didn't I tell you to get out there! I don't give a fuck if there's police out there; I don't give a fuck if it's snowin'. I want you out there hoein'. This a business; you ain't gone too far to see that yet. You know what I'm talking 'bout. Get yo' ass out there on them streets! Get on goin', get my paper
Sorry about that, sister. Sorry for—

School Daze,J. Cole,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Yeah...
Take y'all back... to them school days, yeah
Fayettenam, what up, man?

[Verse 1]
We came a long way from stick and move
Niggas skipping school, just to scrap over bullshit
Nigga if you lose, it's a wrap, them hoes clowning
It goes down in the lunch room
I'm tryna spit this game nigga, fuck food
Bust moves to the hallway
My niggas posted on the wall, always
Ain't thinking about class, dog, my ass tryna parle
If we had this shit our way
We be standing here all day
But look the principal's coming, give pounds then we all escape
All late to class with fake passes
Living life in the fast lane, but ain't passing
They dreaming, tryna be the next Jay-Z and Dame Dashes
I ain't even open my book and it's time to change classes
Walk straight past my ex and don't speak
It's all good, I'll probably have a new ex by next week
I just think, the shit we did was silly, yo, I know that
But what I wouldn't give to go back
[Chorus]
Yeah, back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Yeah, I sit and wish I was a kid again
Yeah, I sit and wish

[Verse 2]
Yo
I walk another nigga girl to her class with my hand on her ass
If he say 'what up' later, I just laugh
Real sneaky, yo, gotta keep it low up in math
Let my nigga read this real freaky note Kiki wrote, yeah
Hooping up in P.E. you can't see me on this gym flo' (No)
But damn Vanessa booty looking sick up in them gym shorts
Uh, we bag 'em up, y'all niggas gonna have to wait
So they passing hate like, 'Damn I can't wait 'til they graduate.'
But some of my niggas will probably never make it
The S.A.T. shit man I doubt they ever take it, 'cause
Instead of tryna send a nigga to a tutor
Them guidance counselors tryna introduce us to recruiters, it's a set-up
Momma cut the light on, time to get up
Make sure the shirt matching the forces then I head out
At the time I thought this shit was so whack
But what I wouldn't give to go back
Yeah, hey
[Chorus]
Yeah, back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Yeah, I sit and wish I was a kid again
Yeah, I sit and wish

[Verse 3]
I'm a little grown, but still reminisce
Close your eyes nigga, you remember this?
Friday night football game, something I'll forever miss
After parties in the gym, grinding underneath the rim
You forgot your school I.D? Fuck, nigga, you ain't gettin' in
In the hallways acting like some hoodlums
See that scrap? Naw, damn I always miss the good ones
Them rumors spreading fast with that he say she say
Twenty people on the phone 'cause everybody did three-way
Man we played them girls for the fools, but
Wasn't no ladies like them ladies from other schools
'Cause seeing them same old chicks got tired quick
She was just fucking my boy, now she all on my dick, gossip, damn
Another chick pregnant, another nigga gone
I reminisce on all the chicks a nigga never bone
Pardon me y'all I'm just flipping through some Kodaks
Sitting, wishing I could go back

[Chorus]
Yeah, back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Yeah, I sit and wish I was a kid again
Yeah, I sit and wish
[Outro]
Yeah, this shit is dedicated to all my niggas man
R.J., Mike Shaw, Jim Brown, yeah
B. Nasty, Big Joe, Smitty, what's good? Yeah
Terry Sanford High School, E. Smith
Class of 2003, that's me
I know y'all remember this"
We All Try,Frank Ocean,"['r&b', 'jazz', 'hip hop', 'blues']","[Verse 1]
I believe Jehovah Jireh
I believe there's heaven, I believe in war
I believe a woman's temple
Gives her the right to choose, but baby, don't abort
I believe that marriage isn't
Between a man and woman, but between love and love
And I believe you when you say that you've lost all faith
But you must believe in something, something, something
You gotta believe in something, something, something

[Chorus]
I still believe in man
A wise one asked me why
'Cause I just don't believe we're wicked
I know that we sin, but I do believe we try
We all try, the girls try, the boys try
Women try, men try
You and I try, try
We all try
[Verse 2]
I don't believe in time travel
I don't believe our nation's flag is on the moon
I don't believe our lives are simple
And I don't believe they're short, this is interlude
I don't believe my hands are cleanly
Can't believe that you would let me touch your heart
She didn't believe me when I said that I lost my faith
You must believe in something, something, something
You gotta believe in something, something, something, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I still believe in man (Oh, oh)
A wise one asked me why (Oh, oh)
'Cause I just don't believe we're wicked (Wicked)
I know that we sin, but I do believe we try (Try, try)
We all try, the girls try, the boys try
Women try, men try (Every girl tries)
You and I try (Every boy tries), try
We all try

Try to believe
Try (Just try)
Try to believe, try to believe
Try (Just try)
Try to believe, try to believe
Try (Just try)
Try to believe

Swim Good,Frank Ocean,"['pop', 'r&b', 'hip hop', 'jazz', 'blues']","[Verse 1]
That's a pretty big trunk on my Lincoln Town Car, ain't it?
Big enough to take these broken hearts and put 'em in it
Now I'm drivin' 'round on the boulevard, trunk bleedin'
And every time the cops pull me over, they don't ever see them
They never see them

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've got this black suit on
Roamin' around like I'm ready for a funeral
Five more miles 'til the road runs out

[Chorus]
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
Kick off my shoes
And swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit
And swim good, and swim good, good

[Verse 2]
Got some pretty good beats on this 808s CD, yeah
Memory seats I'm sittin' on stay heated (Yeah)
I woulda put tints on my windows, but what's the difference?
If I feel like a Ghost, no Swayze
Ever since I lost my baby
[Pre-Chorus]
I've had this black suit on
Roamin' around like I'm ready for a funeral
One more mile 'til the road runs out, out

[Chorus]
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
Kick off my shoes
And swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit
And swim good, and swim good, good

[Bridge]
I'm goin' off (Oh, my pretty love)
Don't try stopping me
I'm goin' off (Throw me a line)
Don't try saving (You broke my heart)
No flares (You broke my heart)
No vest (You drove my love)
And no fear
Waves are washin' me out

[Chorus]
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
Kick off my shoes
And swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit
And swim good, and swim good, good

Lucky Me,JAY-Z,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Jay-Z]
How can you fairly assess something from the outside looking in?
There's gotta be them times you'll be wrong, nahmean?
How can a muh'fucka go round and hate a nigga
He never even met that, he don't even know and shit?
I think this rap shit is all beef

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Y'all don't even know every day I'm living with stress
Got up out the streets you think a nigga could rest
Can't even enjoy myself at a party unless
I'm on the dance floor, hot-ass vest
You think I'm freaking these chicks, right?
I try not to brush against they chest
You get a lawsuit for shit like that, I feel trapped
Swear to everything when I leave this earth
It's gon' be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
You could try me fucka but when I squeeze it hurts, fine
We'll lose two lives, yours and mines
Gimme any amount of time don't let Ms. Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor dripping tears on my sleeve
Told the judge didn't budge it was him or me
And I ain't trying to be hard but I'm guilty as charged
Put my mercy on this court and my faith in God
And pray hard none of my nephews wanna be stars, lucky me
[Chorus: Karen Anderson]
You only know what you see
You don't understand what it takes to be me

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I hate all girls with ulterior motives
That's why I'm 20+ years old, no sons, no daughters
Hate putting my life in the hands of fake promoters
Hear the hate in my voice, right? I hate that you noticed
Niggas wanna strip you to the bone for shit you own
Hate a nigga like that, faggot, get your own
Hate that I can't roam the street without the clip and chrome
Knowing one day I'ma have to flip, c'mon
You know the shit don't stop 'til the Cris' don't pop
And you have to kill a nigga and your wrist don't lock
I'm trapped, the whole world's against me in fact
But ain't no turning back, bring it on
Hate the price of fame 'cause it cost too much
Can I live without y'all niggas saying I floss too much?
Hate the way you make this hate flow all through us
Steady looking for flaws through us, lucky me

[Chorus: Karen Anderson (Jay-Z)]
You only know what you see
You don't understand what it takes to be me
You only know what you see
(Since I was 4 years old
I been told, everything that glitters ain't gold)
You only know what you see
You don't understand what it takes to be me
(And now that I've arrived
I see those truths unfold before my eyes in a world so cold)
[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
And niggas see you in the street, pretend to be friendly
But I know any type of success breeds envy
I know in the back of your mind you're conjuring ways to hem me
Leave my friends in a circle pouring out Henny
But G's is heaven bound so how I'm gon' receive
Anything y'all pour to the ground next time throw it up
And ain't nothing changed so even in my afterlife I show it up
Don't grieve for me, my art remains
Like a dart from the speaker to your heart
Spiritually through the portal now my words is immortal
Don't plan to leave without a fight, I plant a seed I give life
Though I can't see past the girl's greed to call her wife
Next time you're thinking heist better be precise
'Cause I'm fully prepared, one of us is gon' leave here
I have no regrets even though I won't see grow
My godson Boogie, Sonny and Remo, lucky me

[Chorus: Karen Anderson (Jay-Z)]
You only know what you see
(I been told, since I was 4 years old
Everything that glitters ain't gold
And now that I've arrived)
You don't understand what it takes to be me
(I see those truths unfold before my eyes in a world so cold
Since I was 4 years old)
You only know what you see
(I been told, everything that glitters ain't gold
And now that I've arrived)
You don't understand what it takes to be me
(I see those truths unfold before my eyes in a world so cold)
You only know what you see
You don't understand what it takes to be me
You only know what you see
You don't understand what it takes to be me
You only know what you see
You don't understand what it takes to be me"

Staying until you're all dead and buried - till you rot in your graves
You'll never get rid of me - never!"" {*breaking glass*}

[Verse 1]
Official on some Guy Fisher shit
Pop you with the biscuit, cut you into brisket
Buck you, the misfit, fuck you! you're dead, I wished it
Like Kid Twist, with the ice pick, jigging you, sticking you
Sickly, quickly, bitch, cuz I ain't digging you
Slit your guttural, like a butter roll, blood'll flood a pool
Fuck your slut, nut in her hole
Tortured on mortuary slabs, coronary stabs, extraordinary
The more the merrier, your inferior, bury ya'
Execute you bitch, shoot you in the tits
It's the Hoochie Coochie man, kicking brutal shit, recruit the sick
Got two pits playing salugi with your dick, volcanic like fuji
Contusions on your skull, rep Brooklyn like a cugine
Shitbird, get beheaded like Nick Berg, deaded you herb, human flesh turd, blood red on the curb
My saturday night special, splatter your brains
Send you the the church of the Latter Day Saints - in a box
Scatter the remains
[Hook: x2]
Cut open your grill - peel - slice
Motherfucker, I'mma carve you up, real nice
You get nothing but death, bucking at your chest
I'm Necro, you're fucking with me - you're fucking with the best

[Verse 2]
Body fluid ejaculation, you crack basing
You know the rep, think before you step, start to back-pacing
Fred, Mike and Jason a bitch, blast a clip, in your face
Like Berkowitz, did to Stacy Moskowitz, scare you out your wits
I'm completely rehabilitated, reinvigorated, reassimilated and relocated - psych
Leave you discombobulated, bob and weave
Jab your noggin, fuck up your Medulla Oblongata, clobbin you like Drago
Evil like Baba Yaga, I'm obligated to whip out my dick
Lady Gaga ate it - she ovulated
I'm not about love, so punk step to me drunk
With disrespect I'll take a chunk out of your neck, something I could be proud of
A loaded sawed off, explode your orifice off
Chuck norris is soft, kid I glorify gore, like Boris Karloff
A metal splint in your lung, regurgitation, inspiration
Like the Virgin Mary covered in elephant dung

[Hook: x2]
Cut open your grill - peel - slice
Motherfucker, I'mma carve you up, real nice
You get nothing but death, bucking at your chest
I'm Necro, you're fucking with me - you're fucking with the best
[Verse 3]
You're totaled, packed in a bag, like a yodel
Smash you like Cotto, leave you immobile, for acting like a fag Frodo
From the gallows, to a shallow catacomb, shoot Calicos at your dome, that's how it goes
Hit with the chrome bat til your mouth foams, shatter bones
Now you moan, I'm a known cat, prone to flip ask around homes
With a twelve gauge shotty, break in your crib enraged
Pull the trigger at your rib cage, for a big wage
When the metal's pulled, you're getting killed, it's settled
Hit you with a kettlebell, dead in the grill, you better chill
Choke a slut, crack open ya' coconut
Leave it broken, I'm a loco nut
Cut you back open, and burn you with a smoke butt
Like Napoleon Bonaparte, rip every bone apart
Blood on the linoleum, dead you like Joan of Arc
Dracula packing a revolver, involve you in an unsolvable attack
Whack you like the Black Dahlia

[Hook: x2]
Cut open your grill - peel - slice
Motherfucker, I'mma carve you up, real nice
You get nothing but death, bucking at your chest
I'm Necro, you're fucking with me - you're fucking with the best

I'm exhausted, my feet hurt
(I don't) Wanna run no more
(I don't) Wanna run no more
They said (a change is gonna come)
When? (a change is gonna come)
When? (a change is gonna come)
[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
Ain't nothin' changed 'cept the chains
They're restrainin' our physical frame
Mentally we're still livin' the same
It's lockdown, they knocked down the Towers to raise tax
Anything they borrow we pay back
I live in the hood; you'll never bump into Pat Sajack
But we spin the wheel every time we chill
Cops hate Blacks and Hispanics
They draw gats and just blam it
Before they ask where your hand is
I don't see how a wallet can be mistaken for a cannon
So please don't let 'em play us no more
In every way I'm ready, willin', and able to war
Like any day now it could pop, I'll be in the front
Like, ""Please may the force be with me and this pump.""
Housing want me to work 'cause I'm still on my mom's lease
Threatenin' to raise the rent if I don't pick up them park leaves
Ain't nothin' in this world for free
But somehow they got us fooled like this world is free

[Hook]
This is modern day slavery, you see, carry ID
Water is a fee
This ain't how it's supposed to be, man
(I've been running) for so long
Tryin' to be strong, but yo (I've been running)
I'm exhausted, my feet hurt
(I don't) Wanna run no more
(I don't) Wanna run no more
They said (a change is gonna come)
When? (a change is gonna come)
When? (a change is gonna come)
[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
Our people are the product of genocide and slavery
Everything in the ghetto was how it was made to be
Designed in a process, Prison Industrial Complex
Niggas transformed into numbers and objects
We pay the Devil rent for livin' in hell
'Cause the projects was built on the spot where Lucifer fell
Incarcerated knowledge heavy weight
Every black man should read Deuteronomy Chapter 28
Cursed in the city like we're cursed in the field
Cursed on the border, and cursed by the New World Order
Our sons and daughters were stolen by another people
Yoke of iron, end of the Earth, Land of the Eagle
This is the sequel to the prophecy
Freedom, whether peaceful or violent, is my philosophy
I built an army, now I'm gonna build a nation
The foundation of a new civilization
And overthrow the plantation

[Hook: Immortal Technique]
This is modern day slavery, see?
It was designed to be, Patriot Act 3
Just wait, young nigga, you'll see
(I've been running) for so long
My people been so strong, but yo (I've been running)
I'm exhausted, my heart hurts
Gunning them all, I'm gunning them all
I said, we gotta make a (change come)
We gotta make a (change come)
Quick, motherfucker, lock and load!

Til we get there

Here we go, from the poorest and blackest of people
To survive in the streets of Mogadishu
The most dangerous armed and lethal yet peaceful
We no evil, I come from the slums that's run down
Spit native intelligent tongue sound
Would rather get gunned down than dumbed down
So come down

[M1]
Much success to you comrade
To who I wrong, if it's never been said before, my bad
I took a page from the book of Martin Luther
And decided that it's better to hug you than to shoot you
I'm sorry homie if it's not what you used to
But the way that we livin' these Black lives is beautiful
All the things we've been through and the tree we done bloomed
We probably family but we never knew
[Refrain: Stori James]
Til we get there, I'm on your side
Til we get there, I'm on your side
And it can take some time, til we win this fight
Til we get there, I'm on your side, yeah

That's what's called solidarity
When we struggle it's therapy, after chaos we get clarity
My enemy's enemy is my man remember
I ain't tryin' to be endin' up in this man's dilemma
We only here for a minute, it's what you make it so live it
See, I'm a rider and I'm gon' be remembered
For those of you not born, to those of you not here
I wish you the best and that's real

[K'naan]
This ain't ya average, when they portray us they say, all savage
Cause we have it, blast it, won't stash it
Cause we fight to the death and manage
To makes songs of struggle and to habits
And dammit, if I don't get even
It's chant down Babylon season
Die for New Orleans to Cleveland
Til we even, we not believin'
[Refrain]

[M1]
I love when we makin' plays
I love all our brilliant ways
I love when we get paid and never move away from the hood
We keep gettin' while the gettin' is good
You right at home in our neck of the woods
Cause we people, momma said treat others like you want 'em to treat you
We just wanna live and be peaceful
Long as it makes sense, I'm a have patience
Especially with my brothas I go back in the day with
We speak the same language, suffer the same dangers
Cause our children are victims of lead paint chips
Out in L.A. they put the Black against the Mexicans
Old rivalry is throwin' up they sets again
They put the short against the tall and the old verses the new
Pretty soon it's gon' be me against you
All the things we been through and the tree that we bloomed
I wish you much success and stay true

Sushi with my music, I am raw, shrimp roe

Wise with the words and I don't even got a bearded mouth

Now go that-a way, go that-a way

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
The world hating on your boy just yesterday
But like I said that was yesterday, cause hey
Eminem signed me to Shady, put me on Interscope
Then he gave me a rifle so I could put you in a scope
Gave me the stamp, put the check in the mail
Now chicks licking me like an envelope, yeah I’m in her throat
Crooked about to score, I see the red zone
All I need is beats by Dre, but not the headphones
Think I don’t live right, homie you dead wrong
Submarine sandwich: I’m just saying my bread long
Walk in the club with a gang of Eastsiders
Some rappers cool, I came to be live-er
You claim to be lighters
You say you spit flame, you a liar
Damn dawg, change your speech writer
I’m sideways on the hater keep it pushing
Just another Massengell pussy who need a douchin'
I’m looking for a round ass, I need a cushion
I love it when they tell me ""Daddy I need a whooping""

It’s not an arrogant thing, I got a stable of lyrics
And I’ll be pimping this pen like Sean Garrett and Dream
If these songs was hoes, I'd have a harem like an Arabic king
So beware of my team, yep
So many wolves you ain’t got nothing for me
Nowadays all that champagne popping be looking corny
We got the bitches on Hennessy getting horny
And they ain’t thinking of leaving 'til 6 in the morning

And it’s child’s play, call it Chuck E. Cheese
Wanna do it like me, go sell a couple keys and a ton of weed
Then run the street with a hundred G's
Goons that is, they coming out the woodwork
I would work, but that ain’t how the hood work
I’m trying to take over the game B.I.G. and Pac style
Labels try to drop my old shit cause I’m hot now
But oh shit, you should stop now
Try to play me on some ho shit, I'll shut your block down
Dirty magazines tell you what my clique about

Silly mortals haven't a clue as to what the fuck is going on
I'm on the telephone dialing the Dungeon (""Hello?"")

Meet me at the center of the Earth and travel carefully

Hope I'm not over your head, but if so you will catch on later
Played the track, guess she could not take it anymo'
Raping her heavenly body like a ho, coochie so'
From niggas constantly fucking her, never loving her
Never showing appreciation, busting nuts in her face when they done

The sky is falling, nobody balling, they done gave back they guns
For some tickets to the playoffs, but the Hornets, they won
Nigga, we slum, kept all the guns, I gotta protect my family
I drove the biggest thing in the house cause I knew they'd try to ram me
But I'm stabbing, making a path on expressway the best way I know how
Look up in the sky, east, west, no clouds
Him coming now, fuck that money now
I ask my honey how she feeling and is Jordan okay? ""Yeah, yeah, she chillin'""
We should be at The Dungeon shortly, ain't nobody on they porch, see?
Approaching the final exit, I'm thinking I see four horsies
But I don't though, nigga, you won't know until it's on ya
I put that on my dope boys from A-Town to California
All the weed smell like ammonia but at the Dungeon I know they're smoking
Writing the raps and doing the beats to make this last recording
Fuck abortion, I got in the booth to run the final portion
The beat was very dirty and the vocals had distortion

People walk around like, yo, they got charged!

Def Jef with the funk, Def Jef don't front, you know how the name is spelt
I'm making it vital, and jackin' the title, fool, break yourself
Attack the track like Shaq on a whack broad
Coming up with the hits, and I'm coming down with the backboard
Don't fake the funk, just make the sound's up from the trunk
The reason your tape ain't hit the deck is because your hits don't bump
So get back, ain't no hassle, cause you ain't holding nothin'
Keep sticking around, you get beat down like you stole something
Sleep on me and the Shaq and jump your own hand
Cause I know I got skills man, I know I got skills man

Cream you like cheese, spread you on my bagel
My Ford Explorer boomin' with the trunk of funk
All you jealous punks can't stop my dunks
The brand new like Heavy, built like Chevy, Impala
But Shaq's a smooth balla
(Yeah, but what about rhymin'?) I can hold my own
Knick-knack, Shaq-attack, give a dog a bone
Rhymin is like hoopin', I'm already a legend
Back in the days in the food stamp section
Used to kick rhymes like, ""Baby, baby, baby!""
""Every once, every twice, three times a lady""
Is what I listened to, ridin' with my moms
How you like me now? I drop bombs!
When you see me, please tap my hands
I know I got skills man, I know I got skills man

[Outro: Shaq]
I'd like to give a shout-out to my boy Uzi, Def Jef, Little Swany, Meech
Ron Mac, and my other cousin Ron
This is another rough shot from the arsenal
And you know what? Booty rappers, stay booty
Ha-ha-ha, and we out
Ahhh ha ha ha ha
Ahhhhh ha ha ha ha
Ahhhh... sike!"

My nigga e'erytime I think this shit gettin' rough out here
For me my nigga... I just remind myself dog Monday through
Friday homie... From 8 in the mornin' to 5 in the evenin'
Dog... It's some niggas in the court room 'round the country
My nigga... Fightin' for they muhfuckin' lives dog... The
Crackers bannin' niggas e'eryday my nigga

[Verse 1]
My dog went to court today they gave him fifteen
Cracker banned my lil' nigga he was se'enteen
Young nigga don't even know what all that time mean
Pussy ass crackers done shattered my nigga dreams
They holl'in' mandatory they want him to do the whole thang
Nigga showed up in court on my dog and did his thang
Nigga did my nigga now I got to bust his brain
Nigga woulda did me my dog'd do the same
His lady callin' me cryin' and now I feel her pain
Tired of losin' all my niggas to the chain gang
In thirty minutes a nigga whole life can change
Cracker over sinister niggas when this shit gon' change?
[Hook]
Pussy ass cracker give a nigga a hundred years
Have ya mama leavin' out the courtroom in tears
Crackers don't love to have a nigga breathin' for real
Take a nigga life from him they don't know how it feel
Pussy ass cracker give a nigga a hundred years
Have ya mama leavin' out the courtroom in tears
Crackers don't love to have a nigga breathin' for real
Take a nigga life from him they don't know how it feel

[Verse 2]
Ain't talked to my dog yet but I know he sick
Next fifteen years of his life behind a fence
Cracker find a nigga guilty and hit him wit' the bench
Gave one of my dogs twenty-seven on his first offense
The time they givin' the nigga for the crime ain't makin' sense
They jacked the number up now it's eighty-five percent
They did that to make you fuck niggas out here snitch
And put conspiracy in the game to railroad the click
And crackers feel like niggas ain't got no common sense
A nigga paper ain't right they banned him off the rip
A public defender don't get you shit but a long trip
And judge sentencin innocent niggas without a guilt

[Hook]
[Verse 3]
How in the fuck can fo' birds get you a life sentence?
But give a cracker seven years for money launderin' millions
Shoot a nigga in the leg they sentence you like you killed 'em
Cracker catch you wit' that iron and put you under the buildin'
You a nigga that mean you guilty 'til proven innocent
Money talk and bullshit walk a thousand miles
You ain't got a paid lawyer then don't go to trial
Crackers owe each other favors, they'll swap ya out
""You give us him, we'll give you him"" know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Nigga took thirty years on a cop out
The fuck you get thirty years for breakin' in a bitch house?
Crackers playin' a dirty game boy this shit wild

House is wide open, we could bring the outside in
I think you should hear about it, but fuck it I'll be quiet
I just spit it how I live it homie I don't be lyin
Would it make you feel better if I put my pockets on a diet?

Should I downgrade the crib and the way I live?

I could flip that flow, I could stick that ho
I could get that dough, you know I'm with that, yo
Ain't a thing about the shit I came through I haven't seen
But when it gets dark, it's like a nigga's havin' dreams
Or nightmares, the light dares to desert me (What?)
Got me like everybody wants to hurt me (What?)
Paranoid, so I strike out at whatever (Uh)
The closest thing to me is gonna get it, but never
Will I kill? I think death is wrong
So I'ma keep holdin' on 'til what's left is gone
You could put that on my nigga Boom
These other rap cats will give a nigga room
But if it calls for me to force my way in the door
Headhuntin' motherfuckas, stay on the floor
Four-four, that's what I get sick with (Grr)
Four more, now all this is liquid (Grr)
[Chorus]
Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate
Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate

[Verse 2]
I thank the Lord everyday that I'm blessed with a gift
I'm the best, so unless you wanna rest with the stiff
Don't touch that, uh-uh, leave it alone
When you walk past the doghouse, leave it a bone
Dogs bite, dogs fight, dawgs knife
Scratch, shake, and hold all night
So when you hear the—, start runnin'
'Cause when you hear the—, I'm comin'
But I don't like drama, so I stay to myself
Keep focus with this rap shit and pray for the wealth
I want the money, give me the honeys with big asses
The most expensive champagne you got in big glasses
I'm drunk so I'ma bash his head wide open
Beggin' me to stop, but at least he died hopin'
Didn't get his wish, and now he's a dish for the pack
Two glowin' red eyes, everything else is black
[Chorus]
Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate
Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate

[Verse 3]
When the sun is up, the gun is up on the shelf
And all the runners up are thankin' me for their health
Hopin' that they not around when it gets dark outside
Sun's goin' down, you hear the bark outside
Locks off the cage, gauge with the buck shots
Faggot, you've been lucky all day, that's when your luck stops
One drops, then another and another
Gun pops, goin' through you and your mother
When does it all end? I found a friend in a dog
'Cause fuckin' with these cats will send a friend to the morgue
Many questions, no answers, just stress
Try to hold my head and remember that I'm blessed
With the curse and it gets worse as time goes by
Can't see straight 'cause I'm so high
Why ask why when you know?
Nigga, when it's your time to go, you go
[Chorus]
Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate
Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate
Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate
Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate"
What It Is,Jadakiss,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Game wasn't half bad until the faggots came
Got the weed man meeting me at baggage claim
Been the same way never has the status changed
So when I tell you I love you that explains
Why I'm trying to get the pesos, moving the ye slow
Sam Quentin bars with the Pelican Bay flow
Tougher than a lackey, chucks and the khakis
Representing for niggas chino to ??? ???
Sales took a decline I got the dope workin'
Who else better to be the hood spokesperson
Knife to the neck got your throat squirtin'
Hopefully you dead on arrival closed curtains
Ya, I'm a be in the red faded
Rip a Dre track like I was there when he made it
Everywhere you look I'm right there and you hate it
If it's good then cop it I don't care what the weight is
It could happen so don't chance him
I make goon music and they all anthems
Some niggas pay bills some niggas pay ransoms
I don't just sell my bricks I advance 'em
I don't just break new artists I enhance 'em
Any time I'm with the devil I'm dancin
Ya, I got extra jewels on
A lot of these niggas be pussy plus they move wrong
That's why they be the dudes that get moved on
Big picture of them when they turn the news on
Work comin from The Bay and from Towson
In case a nigga get in the way you know what to do to 'em
Move on to the next mission
I'm gettin money though nah I ain't set trippin'
I'm just sayin that's what it is
You ain't going to have a problem paying if you love the kids
Bar shit homey
In the Beverly center with the four fifth homey
I was holding a cig
East side 400 strong over the bridge
Dust jewels too powerful to go in the fridge
I'm a go in your girl's mouth then go in her ribs
Besides money I ain't bring shit
Except for the 3 piece and the wing tips
Pockets square and the ????
You know what it is, it's that time Lord"

Relaxed all night and chilled in the AM
That's when I got a call from Sinister Sam, hello

Peace god it's me I just came home from Matawan
I beat a charge down in Chevy Chase, Maryland
But when I came home I was faced with the case
With black chicken-head Stacey on the witness stand tattling
I tried to call you but Breezy told me to...

One step ka-BOOM... twenty years of man time

Screamin at the top of they lungs but sayin nuthin
But I styrofoam lies with quiet and blaze nuthin

Cowards we ain't cut from the same cloth
You a 5M6 nigga, I ride your bitch nigga
You fuck with the wrong one this time
And I promise you
You be the next nigga they pay homage to
And they gonna find you somewhere in a vacant lot
With the garbage, I'm a murderer so I'm heartless
I drop the top on the CL420 as I
Swallow henny gettin, head from your hunnie
And before I let you hit me, I hit you
And split you, leavin you for the paramedics to get you

I spit venomous murderous shit with the inosence
Of a child, in the penal, foul and official
Futuristic, chick shit, black big dick
From mistresses we roll triple sixes

Murder's the remedy when the hennessy is in me

Sippin Italy, feelin me, killin me, for the benji's
Not the broads in my bed
I can't front, I love them whores that give me head
I like my presidents dead, and I can't stand the feds

And laughin at the police when they can't find my burner
I like cars with a stash box, cash, and drop-top

Analyze my crimes as I rise, and I

From the pimps, to the bulls like Don Bishop
I pimp on hoes religiously, shorty you hearin me
Good sense to keep a nigga in dark tints
But it won't stop the hollows comin throught the fence

Extraordinary and I was never ordinary in cemetery
Bisit my thugs in mortuaries

Forgive me Lord, it feels like I commit a sin a day
Then I wait for them days to turn good again
And get the cake, then I'll tell them that's the winners pay
To win today would just seem like a lavish dream
Know what they mean, everything ain't what it seems
The angels sing and I feel like thats my roll call
And I came with Left Brain, that's my road dawg
Switch lanes? Nah homie I'm a road hog
Brain to the pave look my mind on the road dawg
Said I'm just tryna do this quick like make haste
Don't take more than I can get to prevent waste
My music is like confetti rain when you win a race
And you'll probably lose your mind tryna save face
Scarface, say I got that Montana flow
They know I'm tryna get that Montana dough
Where we go, tell the truth I could never know
I'm just tryna push a Porsche, that's white like Montana snow
And honestly, just for wings I would give it up
So if it's true '12 couldn't come fast enough

Minor, flat, major, act like a pitch with a flanger
The second one's a stranger, but I knew her all my life
Since I was born, the other half said fuck it like I was porn
And the last one, he's in the mirror
With a gun, wish I could see him clearer
But I can't cause my eyes are red, now he's dead

Aye, hold your head homie, look
I'mma live long through these songs
As long as they're on, I'm on when I'm gone
That's why I rhyme like a poet from a prior century
And I don't wanna be a human, treat me like an entity
I know they fiend for my 8's like I'm a fucking Laker
Tryna find a Secret Garden just like Tyler the Creator
Damn, I'm just waiting for my life to begin
And I can't breath when I'm high cause the airs too thin
I'll let out a couple sighs, tell them exhale
They know they shouldn't touch me like the third rail

One car they stole it from

One time to lose it all

Never walk, you never crawl

One lesson, two knuckle-heads
One listen to the other
They both robbing for the supper
Lord forgive them
One is... The product of the environment

He took the harder route, regardless
He was a little smaller
To get respect he had to dog 'em
For the girls
He wanted to be the hero or anti-hero
One dude was a nerd
Got picked on and went berserk
They both teamed-up
Found a common and that was robbing
Drinking liquor
At the age to feel no pain
We robbing brainless
Deep for the cheddar
A pain I can't explain
To see that window shatter
My blood's like a stain
Tainted evidence, the pain
Hard with the police
Gather the evidence
You ain't a robber, you ain't gon' feel this shit
Maybe I ain't mainstream
I cry cause I want the world
I'm scared that these niggas would celebrate my death
I guess... The world is deep, novo
Fuck you bitch
I'm thugged out, I love this shit
So educated I can go out and discuss this shit
Bringing back matters to the public
I like, I love it

And a chain on my neck, hang to the ground
Hey, I said how you feel?
Baby look tough with a gangsta grill
I ain't rich, but I pay my bill
I'm like Jay, I'm trying to drop me 'a mil'
My hood tripping, chrome wheel whipping
With all these hoes, you can tell I'm slipping
Shots of Patron, got bird eye vision
Even broke niggas wanna learn my pimping

You're unaware what's in the underwear

You want the truth? Man, you fucking with a crook
But these niggas want the juice, now they fucking up the jooks

But everybody try to get they glass
Now we can all have a drink, if you trying to put some dough in the bank

Least you coulda done is gone and give me a warning
I don't regret like this
So I'll be right there when you wake up in the morning
Saying, ""This just ain't my style""
You can't say you're happy either
You don't even smile for me, no

Did you agree we should let it be?
And did you agree it's a must?

Did you remember what happened before?
The look on your face said you were expecting more
But some things look better inside of the store

Wish I had the courage to say everything I planned to
My girlfriend, my girlfriend, call herself my girlfriend
Tell me that we 'posed to be together 'til the world end
But I don't really feel that
I just really wanna turn the wheels back
Give you all your sweaters and your heels back
Convince you that time will heal that
Uh, you look for reasons for us to argue
I swear everytime I call, you just tell me how I don't call you
Why you do that? Do that, do that, yeah

Live the life, that of diamonds and guns and now gems
Pull gats like a basehead pull on stems
The Mobb got the bomb, run out and tell a friend
Drop a gem on 'em
It's the infamous back in the house once again
Live the life, that of diamonds and guns and now gems
Pull gats like a basehead pull on stems
The Mobb got the bomb, run out and tell a friend

Sick and tired, ugly fake crooks need to retire
They got you gassed, take a match and smack fire out your
Maggot ass, Havoc represent for the QBC
Smoke that ass like a loosie, though I need to quit
Fuck it, I love it
Like a cloud over the projects, your game, I'm above it
It's combat, gats, bangers and all that
You's a small cat, whatever you on, get off that
I mention nothin' but the real shit, presentin'
The hollow-tip crew, 41st side convention
Stride full, you half-steppin'
Like a fresh TEC out of the box, yo, niggas, I'm testin'
That's no question, bitch-ass, have you confessin'
Like a DT, left in state of depression
You under pressure, in tag, no doubt catcher
The snitch-snatcher, shooken with asthma, you Casper
You yell my name, that's only givin' me props
Plus the fans that you got wonderin' what's got you hot
It's Tu-Not, knocked out the box and got rocked
Got raped on the Island, you officially got
Kick that thug shit, Vibe magazine on some love shit

Get claptized and set straight, put on your head straight
Watch out for these upstate cats
Be leery of New Yiddy niggas with gats with the wall on they back
Rikers Island flashbacks of the house you got scufted in
You would think that gettin' your head shot's enough, but then
Now you wanna go at my team
Must have been drunk when you wrote that shit
Too bad you had to did it to your own self
My rebellion, retaliate
I had the whole New York state
Aimin' at your face at the gate
Bottom line off top soon as you came through
Shots flew, don't even know the half of my crew
I got a hundred strong-arm niggas ready to rock your shit
Clocks tick, your days are numbered in low digits
You look suspicious, suspect niggas is bitches
Get chopped up, Grade A meat, somethin' delicious
And laced back up, two G's worth of stitches
To reconstruct your face and learn how to speak again
My mob's like a bunch of wild Puerto Ricans
With bangers the size of African spears, it's warfare
In the arena, we turn arenas into house of horrors
It's Terrordome, when you see my clique, you need to run behind shit
You got a gat, you better find it
And use that shit, think fast and get reminded
Of robberies in Manhattan, you know what happened
Sixty G's worth of gun clappin'
Who shot ya?
You probably screamed louder than an opera
New York got ya
Now you wanna use my Mobb as a crutch
What you think, you can't get bucked again?
Once again

Back in the house once again
Live the life, that of diamonds and guns and now gems
Pull gats like a basehead pull on stems
The Mobb got the bomb, run out and tell a friend
Drop a gem on 'em
It's the infamous back in the house once again
Live the life, that of diamonds and guns and now gems
Pull gats like a basehead pull on stems

Round here bitches walk around wit the hair that the horses had
Rap it get your face stuck on them bricks
I don't really like to exercise but I'll push up on a bitch
Y'all sweet like ninety-nine bananas
That's why I got ninety-nine niggas wit ninety-nine hammers
They all want a nigga to stop
Cause I rap slick enough to slip the ring off of Vivica Fox
I'm just a playa that found out what the coaches know
So I'mma be around longer than the Oprah show
You and your man y'all both should know
That all it takes is a finger to send you where the ghosts go

Third rule pick a day, fourth rule pick a time
Fifth rule pick a fifth, sixth rule pick a nine
And the seventh rule make sure your sidearm sweet
So when the shootout you leave him six feet deep
Eighth meet in a fast car with disguise
Use a ski mask with shades on your eyes
Ninth rule don't say shit cause po-po listen
Fuck around you end up being stuck in the system
And the tenth rule don't put a tag on a broken heart
Just put a toe-tag on your mark
And rule number 11, you caught a body but you not a legend
You better watch where you heading

From day one I came in the game they said I was hot
They got scared, sent that money, and I got shot
You put pressure on me when you compare me to 'Pac
I'm just a new kid, I can't help that I'm hot
What little niggas say to 50 cent don't matter
I'll fire shots at the shepherd and watch the sheep scatter
My enemies never turn into friends, my friends turn into enemies
You scared then get the fuck around me

Niggas don't live by the g code, we know
Claiming real nigga but he cold like the sea slope
Charge it to the game, but you niggas playing with me
Look me in my eyes, a real nigga facing 50
20 facing 30, riding 'round dirty
Got a shotgun and double pump like James Worthy
You got the heater, I'm still repping Berkeley
Niggas don't love me, bitches don't love me
Went to the hood with four 5's and I'm huntin'
Finna aim for your head and I'm bustin' like I'm nuttin'
Young nigga, ain't no discussion
Pain up in my eyes, every day I'm out hustlin'
Came upon a zipper, lil bro had to bust it
Give him a concussion, if he played me I'mma bust him
I'm the type of head that do dirt by myself
I'm a short nigga, I don't need nobody else
Thinking I'm a nerd, I got the 9 upon the shelf
Only goon nigga in these 31 jeans, slim fit
Stay sick like disease
Breaking in they house I can still remember screams
Tell me I'm the one, everything ain't what it seems
Smile on my face, infrared with the beam
30 round clips same color as my jeans
My gun like oranges, can't wait to hear it squeeze
Seen haters bleed, this the end of my revenge

Text 'em for the address and you ain't even chunk 'em
Thought you had my back, just another nigga bluffing
No respect niggas, shit... Fuck 'em
If you ain't gon' ride I suggest you leave here
If you ain't gon' ride I suggest you leave there
Niggas don't believe in shit, can't compare

Given due time he'll be sniffing what he needs
The game cheated...

Being a real nigga used to be an honorable thing, you feel me?

Now you suckas done got the word all fucked up
Thinking how many niggas you done rob
How many times you done went to jail
How many niggas you done fought, nigga
You ain't no real nigga bruh
Being a real nigga is being me, you feel me?
(Niggas ain't real)
Being able to live that life
And come out of that life
And then teach what's right

You bitch ass niggas turning on me?
Fuck you too nigga
You told me to suck yo dick, nigga?
You can suck my dick too, bitch

Keep your two cents, that ain't worth a second to me
You do it effortlessly? Well, you get what you put into it
Even Jordan ain't scorin' unless he practice a little bit
And how you justify a classless act, a platinum plaque?
You buggin', c'mon that ain't rap, get back
And y'all people be the root of all evil
Quit playing around with the game or we may need a saw sequel
Listen to the bald eagle if you need it for balance
Just be prepared for the beak and its talons

I say that you be trippin'; you needin' expedia
The speed of what I'm seeing too extreme for the untrained
So these G's callin' T like they roll in a mustang
See I used to be a puppet - My momma loved it
Whether justice is justice is something I never fucked with
Till the public tried holding me back
Well, I suppose I should thank them for that, cause now
The strings clipped, shit is off of my shoulder
Makes sense to me now, should have listened to Hova
And yeah they closed, but the curtains lie
Just check the last track before Cliff Burton died, what

Another late night, stage lights and mirror's
I rock the place right, cross the plate like Rivera's
I try to give 'em nice so they might like to hear us

Either that or you'll probably get passed up
Roached out, pushed down, probably get ashed up
Like my last cashed blunt, that was mad fun
Plus it healed the pad that I had in a bad funk
And my rep? junk.. Used to be a goody two-shoes
Now he's getting shaken heads from the hood he used to
God I could have used you, could have pulled the strings
Could have taught me how a Jack could never fool a King
Couldn't fool a thing, peddal through debt
But when I show up it's game over I'm the red ring of death
Yeah, how's that for my XBOX fanbase?
Ex'ed off jams, man just set my hands, faced and killed
Ill, premeditated murder
Dedicated slaughtering of instrumentals never heard of
By your average fellow, grey's the shade
Nowadays, though a patch of yellow, haze make its way
Through, the day's new, it's all beautiful
Bumping Blu and Ex to escape from the usual
Bullshit and pop music, don't drop the top to it
That's the kind of hop, makes my pop think my plot's foolish
[Outro: J-Yak]

Uh, and the strings keep strummin'
They tell me dumb it down but I really hear nothin'"
Familiar,XV,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Look, since the day that I opened your ears
I know that it’s weird
It feels like you’ve known me for years
When all I had was my songs
I was hoping you’d hear
Then you became a fan then I feel like I owe you a beer
So when you at my shows
I throw you a cheers
Come to my meet and greets and take a peek and hope I appear
And it’s hard when you close to the fear that
The more that you’re near that
The less it’s sincere
And I know, I know
I know it’s all part of my career
To be a star on the track in the final frontier
Don’t gotta ask for a thing
People just volunteer
In return for some dap and they call it our square
But it’s hard when I’m chilling
Trying to talk to my peers
And my friends and people just interfere
Like where’s your backpack
When you getting on Gears?
I love the love but I hope that I’m making it clear
[Refrain]
Cause it’s hard in a room full of people I don’t know
And every single one feeling just like me
And sometimes it’s cool cause they just might be
But really knowing me is so unlikely
You ain’t familiar, you ain’t familiar
You ain’t familiar, it’s difficult when all the people that feel ya
Just don’t look familiar
I’m so unfamiliar

[Verse 2]
Girls backstage, hanging out
My crew cool so they safe as sound
As they wait it out
For the minute I finish and then I take a bow
The ho agent daydreaming of us making out
I get off stage and Sez tells me to take a towel
I can’t now I’m taking pictures while my face is drowned
And it’s the best feeling when they say X killing them shows
It’s excellent to know that they mess with it
But niggas be on that extra shit
Asking if the girl I’m sitting next to is who I’m messing with
When people call me by my real name
They don’t know me from 21 Jump Street
It just feel strange
I’ll never change, please mark my words
The dressing room will never read not disturb
I will never tell you to curve
I just want you to observe the fact that I’m reserved
[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
I will shake every hand
Make every fan feel like they the man
Cause they gave me a chance
May who I am as they hang from the stands
Screaming Vizzy, Vizzy, Vizzy is my favorite jam
And blowing up was always part of the plan
So it shouldn’t be strange that all this began
Sawed up the Earth, heart of the land
That’s all I tried to be in the end
But everything I’m not made me all that I am
Everything I never got is all in my hands
Trying to blow up out the pot not a flash in the pan
So I holla when I can
I hope you understand
When I can’t re-tweet every tweet
Reply to every demand
My clone hasn’t got here
I’ll tell you when it lands
Until then
It’s Flyboy Club so fuck the wagon join the band

I'm young, black and rich

Got big rims
I wave to my rich neighbors
Smiling like Ima made man
You won't find the crib
I'm tucked away like a cave man
I live like a pop-star
Party like a rock-star
All I do is cop cars
And have bitches drop drawers
New money, new shoes
Body full of tattoos
I'm fresh
I'll make a white girl love a black dude
I get money with boss niggas
With million dollar stashes
I bought my bitch the same whip
MAC-10 bought Glasses
Ima black mans dream
Niggas love me in the streets
Ima females dream
Bitches love me in the sheets
I'm a cop hater
Judge killer
Hustle like a drug dealer
All I fuck with
Is these crazy ass thug niggas
I fuck with real niggas
Kill you for a loud mouth
I'll get you whacked in Cali
While we down south

You's a hater

One Minute Man Amended Version,Missy Elliott,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Ooh, I don't want, I don't need, I can't stand no minute man
I don't want no minute man
Ooh, here's your chance, be a man, take my hand, understand
I don't want no minute man
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah, ooh, ooh, ah

[Verse 1]
Boy I'ma make you love me, make you want me
And I'ma give you some attention, tonight (Shut up!)
Now follow my intuitions, what you're wishin'
See I'ma keep you up all night (all night), for a long time
So start countin' away

[Chorus]
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want, no
[Verse 2]
Tonight I'mma give it to you, throw it to you
I want you to come prepared, ohh yeah (Oh yes)
Boy, it's been a long time, a crazy long time
And I don't want no minute man, and that's real
Give it to me some more

[Chorus]
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man

'Cause I don't want, no

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
It's time to set your clock back 'bout as long as you can
I stop daylight, it's Ludacris the maintenance man
Get your oil changed, I check fluids and transmission
You one minute fools, you wonder why y'all missin'
On the back of milk cartons and there's no reward
No regards, close, but it's no cigar
A hard head make a soft ass, but a hard dick make the sex last
I jump in pools and make a big splash
Water overflowin', so get your head right
It's all in your mind, punk, so keep your head tight
Enough with tips and advice and thangs
I'm big dog, havin' women seein' stripes and thangs
They go to sleep, start snorin', countin' sheep and shit
They so wet that they body start to leak and shit
Just 'cause I'm an all-nighter, shoot all fire
Ludacris, balance and rotate all tires
[Bridge]
Ooh, I don't want, I don't need, I can't stand no minute man
I don't want no minute man
Ooh, here's your chance, be a man take my hand, understand
I don't want no minute man

[Chorus]
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Break me off, break me off, break me off
'Cause I don't want no one minute man

[Verse 4: Trina]
You know lil' mama ain't with that quick shit
You better break me off stiff tongue or stiff dick
One minute, two minutes, three minutes
Hell naw, to please me you gotta sleep in it
I see you talk a good game and you play hard
But if I put this thing on ya, can you stay hard?
If not, you better keep your day job
'Cause I'm looking for a man to make me say God
I'm off glass and you know this
I'll work your ass out like aerobics
So baby stay focused
Start off slow and then speed it up
Baby show me what you got, is you a G or what?
If you can't beat it up then eat it up
Put a cherry on top, whip cream it up, What?
[Outro]
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got"

Top of the World,Ace Hood,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Infamous]

[Intro]
Ace
See, now I know who I am
'Lotta people thought I couldn't do this...but, uhm
I'm here now, I swear I made it off my block
Ma, I love ya!
I tell 'em, dollas and deals, we did it
If you think I can't do it, hahah, listen

[Hook]
Take a look at me now, I'm from the gutter but I made it
I made it to the top of the world
Nothing holding me down, I told the haters I would make it
I made it to the top of the world

[Verse 1]
Congratulations all you fakers as you see I graduated
Here's a favor for you haters, kiss my anus boy
I made it out the ghetto, I made it out the gutter
But still I keep it street and now I'm hot as every summer
They said I couldn't do it, but who were they to call?
I started rapping and ended chances of playing ball
And now they doubted, but Young is sprouting above them all
Straight out the Broward County gutter skipping menopause
No homo I keep it solo but I will never fall
Now every call that I get the money is so involved
Two stacks or better, it's easy cheddar to hit the mall
I get the money to throw up, so every day I ball
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
And yes I made it, you can't mistake it, I know they hate it
They see my face in them papers next to they rapping favorites
I'm so amazing, I am no one like I'm in the Matrix
And I made it momma, don't stress your problems, I'mma get us out of
Forget the drama that people holler, just follow God up
And he will lead you right through them problems I promise momma
And I swear that to the day I perish
Tell them Khaled I will bury every necessary cat who said I wouldn't homie
Look at me now yeah, I'm laughing at you non-believers
And screaming ""Gutta!"" while I'm balling every fucking season
I used to pass up my CD me and Fo' Fifth in '80
I used to beg them to listen but they were not believing, go

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And as I rap I create a classic, who would imagine
That I would inherit all the traits to be the greatest homie?
The world is mine and everything, get it, let's get the money
See Tony Montana said it best, yes it's quoted truly
So add this song to your list of greatest and classic movies
And I'mma roll the credits just in a second, just get this message
Shout out to everyone who supported me past to present
And I want to thank Khaled cause without him there will be no sessions
And I want to thank fam' cause with them see they taught me this lesson
And I want to thank God cause with out Him there will be no message
And I want to thank all of my fans because they are a blessing
This for BET reference, I got my speech ready
[Hook] x2

[Outro]
Take a look at me
Don't ever let a nigga tell you you can't, my nigga
I've got a lot of diamonds on me right now, but uhm
[?]
See I'm Ace Hood
Before I was just that regular nigga
Dollars and deals, I swear I love ya, homie
Aye, D, I love ya, homie
We gon' do it my nigga
4-5, nigga!
Yeah, You can do whatever you wanna do in this world
My nigga Khaled, we the best music, I'm living proof of that there
He transformed me into the beast you know today
Believe that, Ace Hood
All my hood niggas know what it is

Willie Nelson nigga, we run flusty, crocodile hat
Cowboy rap, hammer game trusty
Diamonds on from Ghana, Boca retire in a yacht
With the middle name Lex, pop my llama
Movies get made in HD, let me get your eighty-three
I'mma scout faces so straight meetings
There's nothing you can do with my real niggas
Not the ones I rest my head with, my son a real crew piranha
Two wheels scooters, the new Rugers, floating through the Beverly Center
I count a ten up with my shooters
All these is high powered, Bob Dylan style, my niggas
Post it up, yeah frontin' at Mr. Chow's, titanium hustle, switch color
Most of them rich brothers are only on fucking and switch nuggets
Luggage is the real shit, who kill shit niggas is nothing
Blow a blunt, repeal shit

With a yellow back, pretty long hair
Suck a dick like Karrine Steffans
With Bobby Brown on speed dial, his ex dial stay on the check-in
I got that Mickey, baby, little mama
I got the bomb, call me Tom Brady
Move like a running back, 21 Tomlinson
Know how to push it back, you should pay homage and
Shit is too potent, make you feel like vomiting
Your black/white birds can give me five like Donovan
Pop the champagne for the illest hustler in the game
I got the Pink Floyd, Ozzy all day
And I ain't even mention my deals yet
Cuz I don't wanna have you freaked out over this real shit

[Verse 3: Jim Jones]
(Harlem stand up, we in the building, let the birds fly
Rock star to my heart, anything else? Uncivilised, go)
Rock star like the Red Hot Chili Peppers
I can't front red tops got me feeling extra
I drop the top so I can show the stones
I got the sour so I'm Rolling Stones
I'm popping shit on my mobile phone
I never slip cause I keep the fully loaded chrome
And have my niggas even stay …
That's why we pour a liquor for the Grateful Dead, we miss you
Where I'm from, it's either guns or roses
And fuck with me you need a bunch of roses
And Lord knows I keep the Led Zeppelin
A nigga put it then we dead ressing
You can tell a bitch is still an e
We got that white girl nigga Sheila E
Diplomats we the Eagles(Killa!) we finna be greater than the Beatles

Baby girl what's this about
Invite me in and kick me out
Theres better ways to deal with this
Does it offend you that I'm real as shit
Ain't another dude as tough you feel me
I mean who love you like I love you really
Whats up with this distancing
I dont feel significant
Hold up wait girl hold just a min
I need this moment just to vent
Incidents I can't control
Came up out I had to go
You knew I was coming back
You wanted that I had to grow
Said you could get past my past
So what we moving backwards for
Who knew it would take this long
You never mentioned that before
How could you diss me this me
Kiss me dismiss me just leave
Bitch we history mystery
Haunts me how you smile don't miss me
Want me need me call me
Deeply heal me hear me touch me see me feel me
See she guilty look away
Crooked love can't look my way
Took a day to write you this
For night you miss in light of this
Cuz I made it despite of this
Lets make a night of this
Fire lit glass of wine relax your mind we passin time
Ashes from the passions of our past just fly
And its fine
Damn it's time to accept it I never hear your voice again
Its so hard to say goodbye but thats what turns boys to men
The choices in
Life never seem fair
But they bring light to the things never seen there
So at least for the time that it took
When you climb and you look
You done made it to the clean air
Breathe in enjoy it cuz some seek joy just to destroy it
Distorted visions don't playback the way they were recorded
Why can't sometimes life be edited minus all the bullshit
Get a full grip fast forward through the open road
When life push your buttons you dont seem to have remote control
I hope that your soul is safe
I hope all your goals in place
I hope that it goes away and everything just goes your way
I hope when foes oppose you they get stuck with the frozen face
I hope I can motivate somebody to grow today
I hope that you go hard and even though things dont go your way
Hold up wait
Even though you broke my heart
I'm still wishing you the best
I'm just gonna play my part
If someone's willing to invest
This has been my blood
This has been my tears
This is been a pain I felt inside my heart for years
I been workin so hard I know they gotta feel the bars
This ain't bout no girl this bout the deal I lost

Yeaaa,ey yo check this out
I like to dedicate this song to…
All my failures in life
Everything that I ever endured that just made me stronger…
It made me realize that
It's not the end, it's not where it stops
Anybody could do it…LETS GO!!!

Well, Tyler, uh
It's about that time
I mean, you're a good kid, just misguided
Okay, so is there anything else you wanna say before we end this?

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
My father died the day I came out of my mother's hole
And left a burden on my soul, until I was old enough
To understand that the fuckin' faggot didn't like me much
He loved my moms enough to bust a nut and then he... (Shake Junt)
Bring Your Pops to School Day, for twelve years, I cheated
Told the fuckin' faculty that he was at a meeting and
Bring That Dude to Life day, he wasn't at the meeting
Made a U-turn on the way there like, ""The fuck am I thinking?"" (What?)
Birthdays, Christmas, my only fucking wishlist
Was CDs (And a father) and a new fit
Instead, I got some CDs, inhaler, some Ritalin, some white socks
I was hyper 'cause I ain't get attention from my real pops
Cops say I'm supposed to be in jail, but they don't know it's me
Statistics say that niggas with no father ain't gon' be shit (Nigga!)
Well I guess I had one, 'cause, nigga, I'm it
You smell that? (Yeah!) That's the odor of success, bitch
[Interlude: Tyler, the Creator]
I know I'm not the only bastard
In America
So I'm gon' to need some help, on this next part
Scream it with me, niggas

(Got a car, nigga) Fuck you
(Eat a dick, nigga) Bitch

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
Father's Day was the worst when it came to gifts
'Cause I ain't know for who or what the fuck to get
Now, my mama mentioned the day before what she would like
'Cause she's playin' both roles, like her occupation was dyke, fucking right
I ain't look up to Obama and Nixon (Nope)
I look up to the Hugos and Dixons (Yup)
The niggas in the vision, rap about the shit they cooking in the kitchen
Pushing keys, like them niggas that were banging on them keys
My father never seen me, the nigga probably Stevie
He bought me a hoodie, a couple albums
Like that's gonna make up for the years and the tears
And the money that my mama spent on rent and clothes
You fucking dipped out, I swear to God, if I see you I'ma get out
The M-16 and let a fucking clip out (RAH!)
'Cause in 16 years, you let your kid doubt the existence, none
I don't give a fuck either, like father, like son, I'm done
[Bridge: Hodgy Beats]
He ain't give a fuck about me
He ain't give a fuck about you
He ain't give a fuck about we
So what the fuck we gon' do?

The cold is nice, and I'm not talking 'bout the weather
The skin is thick, no need for leather
Your father called, he said you're better without him
I'm not the only fuck without them
How to tie a tie and how to get your suit hemmed
Up, take it to the shop, then, what?
Fuck it, momma's proud of her asthmatic, thin fuck
Luck on my brim, Sup-preme keeps me warm
When the cold blood swarms in my veins, fuck rain in the summer
The bummer is the fact that I'm black
And I hang with white Neos whose marrow stays frío
Now, this counselor is tryna tell me that I'm emo
She don't give a fuck
D-low, where's the trigger? I'll let this bullet play hero
[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]

No, no, fuck that

I'm blowing up like my swagger on the Gaza
I'm writing movies where I'm making out with Aubrey Plaza
And homegirl my homegirl, it is not like that
But if she tried to rape me, I would not fight back
Girls who turned me down are saying ""please"" and ""sorry""
You lucky that I'm Randy, Aziz Ansari
So now I'm in the club tellin' strippers they should back it up
I wanna hang with Lil Wayne, I just hope that I'm black enough
Damn, I guess we're all friends here
Except for I don't know you, like you was me last year
It's funny how these niggas all treat me like we best friends
I wanna fuck these small girls, minus ""S-M""
Meaning that I fuck all girls, that is wordplay
Catch me on my iPhone doing what the birds say
I ain't going nowhere, somebody better tell a hater
He's goin' down like my living room elevator
Fuck what you heard, bitch, I'll fuck your fucking brains out
And make you wash your boyfriend's sheets to get the stains out
Put your fucking boots on, it's time to kick the lames out

Girls chase me like they think my dick is Justin Bieber
Pussy thrown at me, you fuckin' with a wide receiver
I'm a genius, and I ain't try to hide it either
Got a lot of hay, let me pay for what you sip tonight
Mixed girls from Williamsburg, that's my fucking kryptonite
Baby girl, shorty, have it however you want it
Whatever you asking 'bout, I promise you that I done it
My swagger's New York but my home is the South

In the woods with the SK I'm cockin'
You don't want to play with that toy
Droppin' this heat like an asteroid
Good in the south like Pastor Troy
Pull up inside of a 1977
Sittin' back and sippin' my crown and seven
Pimpin' I'm about to get down
Look at me changin' lanes
Twin pipes lookin' like dragon's breath (Roo)

Said I'd be here in 5
And even though I brought you glasses
You still can't believe your eyes
But if you don't believe it by now
Fuck it, just lean to the side
Hold up wait a minute, I don't really wanna leave without a single solitary soul in need of what I'm bringing to him
To be a sail and catch my drift
Lead me to the door, check my list
Meet me at the floor, catch this fist
Or meet me at the store, catch this lick
Build this house, flip this brick
Real skateboarders feel this grip
Moving through the alleyway and look at all the people tripping
'Cause I'm on it chopping like

Put 'em in a duffle bag and I roll up in a river then I... hold up
Watch what the fuck you hold up
Dynamite sticks will blow up

I'm just a latchkey kid with a snotty nose
High school drop out
Space I'm around need whiteout
And I ain't dealing with no minimum wage
I'd rather construct rhymes on a minimum page
Cynical ways, cats sin for nickels these days
Pulling the chrome out
And you acting like pulling the chrome out
Hated the sound of grandma's crying the crooked letter
You could hear it from the ground or where the sky thunders
Make you wonder about early Sunday morning
Relatives dressed in black and they all mourning
Flows be banging in the paint, throwing elbows
My first fight was me against five boroughs
I lost my first wish
But remembered every detail of my first kiss
That's that Bronx Tale bliss
The holiest of holies
Hip hop, it was '88
Even at the age of 10, phrases levitate
Drinking Little Hug quarter waters
Dodging stray slugs on the corner in that exact order
While you playing, death is what happens
I found the passion in aerosol cans and hands clapping
Back spins, microphones and cats rapping
Linoleum and up rockers, the show shockers
Who rip Lee patches off of impostors
You ain't the real McCoy, you a wind up toy
And it's going to cost you
And that's my B-Boy Alpha

Straight out of the depths of hell
Reflect the sec and inhale the buddah wisdom
Envision and edit inscriptions of a Megalah spiritualism
Paint a picture from the spiritual
And seriously spit a lyric

Trigger living in these city limits
Limited with no money, going through crazy minutes
Crazy thinking of back in the days
When blazing the lazy writtens
Before we was swallowing deuces, popping with gooses
And rocking the bubble gooses
Trouble lose kid, puffin a loosie
Hopping off Huffy, stealing Marvel comics and water uzis
All of us canoeing through sewers with juvenile maneuvers
Caught up in nooses from borders with troubleshooters
On corners where coppers will hop out of Dunkin Donuts
Popping they gun and shoot us
Or more of us aware
Thinking Rudy Giuli really don't give a fuck about a mouli
Got me woozy, sipping Kahlúas losing my noodles
Screwed up in the two triple losers
Spraying it live, b-boy graffiti alpha
Out of rap-palooza

Because I recognize it's all about timin'
Me and my freestyle alliance practicin' African voodoo science
In front of twenty-foot bonfires
Lookin' skyward, calculatin' May 5, 2000
The nine planets'll be in alignment
The arrival of the prophet in the cockpit
Of a starship the size of the Hale-Bopp comet
With mercury ion rockets
And a big-ass ""Canibus Comin' Soon"" poster on the side of it
I'm known geographically and intergalactically
That's why I got extraterrestrials that wanna battle me
They even tried kidnappin' me, and they would've snatched me
If their craft didn't get trapped in the Earth's gravity
Engines stalled and failed, crashed into a farmer's field
And that's really what caused Roswell
Undercover operatives workin' for COM 12
Disguised as a nigga signed with a record deal
Lyrically, I'm off-scale, so all hail
Or get tossed towards Hell, whatever y'all feel
Bruisin' niggas, confusin' niggas like Chip Fu from the Fu-Schnickens
Hit you with nuclear cruiser missiles
Hear the wild wolf growl
Styles stockpiled for miles from the ground to the clouds
Wack niggas wanna be down, but it's not allowed
Interrupt the cipher unannounced
And you'll get punched in the mouth
With the southpaw southern fist
I'll bust your shit, swell your lip bigger than Bubba Shrimp
For actin' tough and shit, what a wimp
You giant Goliath niggas get shot with a rubber sling
I'm an experiment gone bad
My brainwaves on an encephalograph
Show that I'm stark ravin' mad
Your whole scientific staff'll get killed in a nuclear blast
When I throw the Florence flask in my hand
Flammable liquids in the lab explode
And you get stabbed with all the flyin' glass
Trained to blow up commercial aircraft
Trained in chemical weapons class
Just to see how long a nigga's breath'll last
I put him in a leather mask, spray his ass with a can of pepper gas
Then watch him grab his neck and gag
Watch the nigga choke to death as I laugh
""You wanna battle?"" is the type of question you should never ask
Nigga, pick a tougher task, see who the fuck'll last
Whoever lose'll get a solderin' iron up the ass
You need to recognize, my hand is quicker than the eye
Quicker than the five-speed Jamiroquai drives
A lifespan longer than nine lives, infinite rhymes that can't die
A nigga with a divine mind
I dedicate this to the wise, dedicate it to dimes
Dividin' myself into hundred ten times
You can't deny the offerings I offer
Flows that glow with auroras that sparkle like water
Fly like a saucer with the torque of a Porsche
Murder a million MC's, then autograph all of their coffins
Been gettin' it on since I been born and I'mma live long
And I'mma be gettin' it on 'til I'm gone
Look at all the stages I been on, all the songs that I spit on
I took an oath to rip everythin' I get on
A nigga like me should have Carpal Tunnel syndrome
In the wrist bones from grippin' microphones this long
I'm just a small fish in a big pond
That gets pissed off, whenever I get picked on
Nigga, try to flip and get flipped on!
My army march a million strong
Like the Nation of Islam with suede Timbs on
Extremely hostile
Fully armed troops dressed in frog suits and night vision goggles
A lyrical lynch mob shittin' on niggas
Drawn to a hideous form with horns and a mink on
Duckin' down low like we in 'Nam fightin' the Viet Cong
Screamin' ""Incoming!"" when I see a bomb
Speak to your leader, surrender your arms
You need about a million more soldiers to even the odds
Plus 800,000 to even consider a war
And 200,000 more to even look hard
You better drop your flag and withdraw
My cavalry charge accompanied by a blizzard of wicked metaphors
And smash y'all, attach y'all to the back of my horse
And drag y'all across the motherfuckin' asphalt
Nine out of ten niggas is frauds; you know who you are
Always talkin' about your bitches and your cars
Your jewelry and your girls, it's like we from two different worlds
You motherfuckers really get on my nerves
'Cause I'm beyond 'em, on some futuristic cyborg shit
I close my eyes when I freestyle
So I could read what prints across them
Then raise my arms like a sorcerer
And cast a fireball into the audience
To barbecue your brain organs
You feel like you've been thrown in a microwave oven
I flame broil suckers then hit 'em with some more shit, the raw shit
Call my reinforcements, the Four Horsemen
Take a big piece of chalk and draw a line across the stage pulpit
I dare a motherfucker to cross it!
I'll even call my man Black Rob at two in the mornin'
Tell him it's important
Tell him to call Sting three-way and sing a chorus
Break your camcorders, so you motherfuckers can't record it
Call the news, I'll kill your reporters
Start a lawsuit, I'll kill your lawyers
Fuck the soft shit and fuck what y'all think!
My album's gold 'cause my album was the bomb shit
Y'all niggas got your ass beat 'cause you asked for it
Got your picture taken and put in a tabloid
'Cause you a man and you like to touch little boys
You fuck 'em in the ass, then you give 'em cash for it
That's some sick shit, homeboy
A hundred years ago, they'd have took you to see Sigmund Freud
You fraudulent, feminine, fragile as a feather is
With an effortless blow, I'll crack your whole skeleton
You think you better than Canibus? Where's the evidence?
You got below average intelligence and poor penmanship
You need to shut the fuck up 'cause your breath stink
Take fifty cents and purchase a pack of peppermints
Battlin' me, you never win
You thought you was the only nigga that could sneak a weapon in?
Nigga, guess again
'Cause after I'm finished wreckin' this shit
I'mma drink a whole bottle of Henny and go fuck a lesbian"
Oh... Canada,Classified,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
O Canada! We stand on guard, for thee
O Canada!
O Canada!
O Canada!
O Canada!

[Classified talking behind intro]
I told this guy where I was from
He said, oh, Canada
Kind of laughed it off, real funny, huh
Yeah, uh, come on
One two, one two
Mic. check, one two, one two
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Uh, yeah, from the land of the lost, Trans-Canada cross
Patriotic and I honor with my hand on my heart
From the greatest of lakes to the greenest of greens
To the rockiest mountains and everything in between
Oh Canada, oh you no fan of us
Cause our movies and TV shows are so amateur
Yes we laugh it off, that don't really bother me
Look we ain't serious unless we really got to be
Humorous attitude like Kids In The Hall
Or Jim Carrey, Mike Myers, hell we claimin 'em all
It's the great white north, home of the funniest actors
The butt of the joke with an abundance of laughter
The red and white flag, keep it high, keep it visual
People say Canada and get stereotypical
Think we finish every sentence with buddy or B'y
And if it ain't that, it's either dude, eh, or guy
Canada eh, yeah we considerate people
And smokin marijuana, we consider it legal
Still doin' rap like the 1990s
But that's how we like it, off time and grimy
[Refrain]
I know where I'm from and I told ya before
North of America, hard to ignore
Every-time I go away I tell them for sure
I'm from Canada, oh-oh-oh Canada
Oh Canada, oh-oh-oh Canada
I'm from Canada, oh-oh-oh Canada

[Verse 2]
I've been around the globe and heard the confusion
Honestly a lot of y'all are ignorant and stupid
Yes, we have microwaves, TVs and cell phones
Unintelligent fuck, we invented the telephone
We made Yahtzee, the lightbulb, hockey
And bred the greatest players, Gretzky to Crosby
We all got at least one drinkin' buddy
And after one drink, all of us think we're funny
Our national mascot's a damn beaver
Oh Canada, we love our beaver
Home of Hells Angels and RCMP
Home of Gordon Lightfoot and SCTV
No doubt, The Underground Railroad
Georges St-Pierre, right here is where he call home
Our health care system, y'all know it's free
Keep our girls bangin' with a full mouth of teeth
I won't even get into the music industry
They say hip-hop is dead, nah it's up north with me
I could do this all day, it's a part of my routine
But supper's almost done and tonight - poutine

Blood Brothers,Gravediggaz,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: The RZArector & (The Gatekeeper)]
It is written (manifest)
That all men are brothers (prophecy)
We come like blood brothers (word is bond)
'Cuz blood is thicker than water (a-alike)
From the misty grounds (from the unknown)
The shadows (the deep)
The darkness (the triple darkness)
Gravediggaz (my blood brother)

[Verse 1: The RZArector]
I grew up in the violent island of Shaolin
55 Morris, 6th floor, 10th door
When ""Jackpot"" Watt was hot, I was not
A rusty-ass child with tears and snots
Acquired the knowledge how to master my thoughts
My skinny frail body couldn't fuck with the sports
Six feet two, still wack on the court
So I stalked New York with a black pitchfork
My style date back to ninety-watt Conion box
Wallabee Clarks with no socks
Remember the days before your pants would sag
Puerto Ricans on the block just throwin' up tags
[Verse 2: The Gatekeeper]
Yo, I was born with a rusty spoon as a mouthpiece
Life was hard cause the graves was my company
Hang with my problems as his trouble predicted
To cross the path, as I laugh at the victed
No warmth for sure, the vents would spit average
Watchin' devils, fiend like a savage
Blood brothers need me call (Ooh-ooh!)
In a minute, a minute, Ghostface and all, check it
RZA, Grym and the Undertake
Devil's get baked, I'll sniff your ass like a eighth
Tortures and screams buildin' up my steam
Death do us apart rushes through the bloodstream
Yo, something ain't right, I don't get it
I feel a vibe, blood brothers, are you with it?
If I have to choose one or the other
Back the fuck up, spook, yo, that's my blood brother

[Chorus: The Grym Reaper]
All—all—all in together
Blood brothers all in together
All—all—all in together
Blood brothers all in together

All—all—all in together
Blood brothers all in together
All—all—all in together
Blood brothers
[Verse 3: The Grym Reaper]
Back in the days of Lee's and BVD's
I grew up deceived by wicked enemies
My lifespan began to dim in the era
When you can't even trust the man in the mirror
Now Gravedigga niggas receive my trust
And like Christ, we walk among the thieves and the sluts
Night brings stress like skins on PMS
The street's a bloody mess, there ain't no EMS
In sight my thoughts are to leave the slums
I hustle with beats and drums, not keys and guns
My feet are numb, as I walk my dogs
I cut off the floors with the Gravedigga swords
Life parole, as me and my man is violated
Hookers are neutered and spayed-ed
Snakes are decapitated and castrated
Niggas just lost, your whole ark is bein' raided
Shows today are hectic, niggas'll wreck shit
Lick off rounds and jet quick
This piece is gettin' heated
Foes are rushed and stampeded
Devils are all defeated by the blood brothers

[Chorus: The Grym Reaper]
All—all—all in together
Blood brothers all in together
All—all—all in together
Blood brothers all in together
All—all—all in together
Blood brothers all in together
All—all—all in together
Blood brothers

[Verse 4: The Gatekeeper]
Yeah, as the earth erupts
I conduct to destruct your flux when I big up
Catastrophes are blasphemy
Pour a container of brains on your grave through a strainer
I capsize your coffin, I wreck them often
Breaking devils down like Steve Austin
I gotta rip on a peel for a meal
Let's get some God degree
'Cuz a blood brother's hard to be

[Verse 5: The RZArector]
Power-Equality-Allah-Cee's-Equality, follow me
Law and order blood is thicker than water
Many heads got slaughtered back in Latin Quarters
Like this brother named Rick was slick
But got bit by the same mothafuckas that he ran with
Band of the hand, the Clan's my fam
Something mom-dukes could never understand
From the grave to the gutter, death to another
Who try to fuck with my blood brothers

[Chorus: The Grym Reaper]
All—all—all in together
Blood brothers all in together
All—all—all in together
Blood brothers all in together

All—all—all in together
Blood brothers all in together
All—all—all in together
Blood brothers"
The Last,Childish Gambino,"['pop', 'hip hop', 'jazz', 'r&b', 'blues', 'rock']","[Verse]
I'm the last of a dying breed
Meaning that I’m not afraid to try a new thing
Can't see me, best to get yourself some Visine
Toe tag a motherfucker
No jokes while these other niggas ""wakka wakka""
Other rappers try and go and get over
You want that hood shit? Best to go and call Hova
I was a good kid, backpack on my shoulder
98 test score in my ThunderCat folder
My cousin was older, my mama used to wake up
Drive me to his school 'cause his school was much safer
But I slipped up and accidentally told a teacher
Now I'm going to a school where I get beat up
Because I ain't get down with them other kids
Probably 'cause I talk too white and I got a dad who's there
Mama couldn't take it, sold the place and got us out of there
Guest room, now the six of us splitting one with a restroom
Now I'm going to this school called Rockbridge
School of the neighborhood we tryna buy a house in
There's not a lot of black kids
So I stick out like a sore thumb with some bad acne
But really, what I wanna know is why I never fit in right
Like a fat dude getting on a packed flight
Even when I make friends in the hallways
I'm wishing I was someone else always
But I'm happy that that shit happened to me
'Cause it taught me most important is to do me
'Cause everybody hates you till they love you
Facebook niggas same niggas that would shove you
'Cause nobody was jocking my style
'Cause I had a high voice, they called me faggot 8 Mile
So I stopped writing for a very long time
Thinkin' that a nigga wasn't made to bust rhymes
And this next part, sounds like nonsense
But I swear to God, Tina Fey gave me confidence
Taught me everything that is good comes from honesty
Everybody's got a voice, you just gotta follow it
She on her role model shit
From the day that I shook her hand
I knew that I'd never die a broke man
So I could try this rapping shit out again
The game need change, I'm a part of it
People tell me I should spit under Donald Glover
But I try to keep my real name undercover
'Cause if you hear my name, then you think it's jokes
And I can't go for that, nigga; Hall and Oates
My nigga stay down like a winter coat
I rap about my life, not ""I'm On a Boat""
'Cause this joke rap shit's gotten out of hand
Only ones who do it well's Lonely Island
Save the raps about your cat, I am not a fan
Leave the joke raps alone, man I'm working here
I do not play around with this bullshit
I am different, call it new shit
Labels want me to hurry and cash my check in
But I keep my shit free till the last possible second
'Cause God knows that I don't need the money
You get your clothes free when you rich, ain't it funny?
But this limelight burn like a muh'fuck
I wanna call my dad crying but I hang up
'Cause I don't want him to worry, he's got his own shit
So I send him a check and tell him to hold it
If anything ever happens, want you to know this
I always took the time to smell the roses
And wherever I am, I am doing fine
I'm here for a good, not a long, time"
Beyond Infinite Affections,P.M. Dawn,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","And it goes a little somethin' like this

Mr. Wonderful you, you're thinking 'bout life
You're thinkin' 'bout love, you're thinkin' 'bout the ways to break it down
You got eighteen myths and five different ways into the mind
But you're lookin for the verbs and nouns

Po' you, wat'cha wanna do, switch rooms?
And walk around space with your black and blue balloons
No, from what I hear, you used to dance in the face of fear
But now you're runnin from the monkey on the moon

It's 12 o'clock, what makes a difference in the tides
Exploding paths to dismay, and if so
I'll never catch you with a runaround Sue
Playin peek-a-boo with ribbon in your fro, hell no

If I was to lie, if I was to cheat
Would you see me with a flower in my hand
Then beyond infinite affections
Sit these excuses for all the lies, understand
Beyond infinite affections
Beyond infinite affections
Yo, go beyond infinite affections
Beyond infinite affections

Immaculate pains that cultivated in the South
The thought alone to slip a mickey to the mouse
Makes you wonder what kinda force is that
My religion screams, ""Punk what you lookin' at""

I thought the voices could have sounded kinda odd
So, I quest the me that said I wasn't into God
I was yellin' screamin' where is the demon?
But that's the kinda vibe that sort of blends in the fog

I dig the norm, skip around metaphors
But I was too through, not to open other doors
I was six plus two, eight plus five
Now it's intense I could experience the vibe

Whatever it takes to fix the tweaks in the speech
If ever I could stop believin' Mr. Man
Then beyond infinite affections
Sit these excuses for all these lies, understand

Beyond infinite affections
Beyond infinite affections
Yo, go beyond infinite affections
Beyond infinite affections, yeah
Do you love me, no
Could you love me? No
Would you try to love me? No
Then I don't think you understand

Break a one break a two, tell me what to do
The room's full, check your psyche or get another spoonful
Caress the silk lines until it turns pink
Another link that wants to push you to the brink

If only distance likes to leave you in the clouds
And fear was merely created by man
Then beyond infinite affections there exists nothing
And nothing understands, God damn it

Beyond infinite affections
Beyond infinite affections
Beyond infinite affections
Beyond infinite affections

Check it out, check it out
Peace for real"
Death March,Immortal Technique,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[DJ Green Lantern]
This is an invasion, an occupation
Immortal Technique, the evil genius DJ Green Lantern
And you're now in the state of guerrilla warfare
It has been spread by the superpowers of the industry
To the 3rd World underground of the streets
This is for all those who've been labeled extremists, maniacs, terrorists
Shit.. Welcome to the 3rd World

[Immortal Technique]
Yeah.. Yeah..

Invasion and rampant monetary inflation
That brought us all to the footsteps of this nation
Peruvians, Haitians, Ecuadorians, Nicaraguans, Colombians, Salvadorians
Invasion and rampant monetary inflation
That brought us all to the footsteps of this nation
[2x]

Invasion and rampant monetary inflation
That brought us all to the footsteps of this nation
Peruvians, Haitians, Ecuadorians, Nicaraguans, Colombians, Salvadorians
They call us terrorists after they ruined our countries
Funding right-wing paramilitary monkeys
Tortured our populace then blamed the communists
Your lies are too obvious, propaganda monotonous
And that's not socialist mythology
This is urban warfare through the streets of your psychology
So I'm like the legs of a paraplegic really
Cause I'm still part of you even if you can't feel me
You can never debate me, The M4s at your baby
Like troops with gats in Iraq do daily
So you can marginalize the way you portray me
But don't get Hollywood and try to play me
We can shoot it out in the theater like troops in the 80s
New Jack City classic crack era, mack-milli
Shouting BET is not black-owned on Rap City
You got a contract to kill me motherfucker, that's fine
Cause there's a contract to kill your family when I die
So when your car explodes, don't be surprised
Soldier, I'm like Marine Corp C4
Even blow the spot with the beat rocking at 3/4
Canvas the flow like the ghost of Michelangelo
This is the anthem, Immortal Technique and Green Lantern
Don't say shit bitch, you don't want the ""check, check""
To become a ::chick, chick:: You know what I'm sick with
Lyrical tuberculosis, cocaine overdoses
Blood coming out your noses, that's when death approaches
March to my death smiling, laugh if the end's violent
There's no escape from this political asylum
Revolutionaries don't fear execution
Cause the death of my visible Constitution
Is just the beginning of spiritual evolution
God will reincarnate me as revolution

[DJ Green Lantern]
You can't take out a revolution
You can't kill a idea
Fuck is you stupid?
You kill that man, he becomes Immortal

Niggas pourin' out that, Ol' English

[Verse 1: Game]
Once upon a time in the projects, yo
I watched my Uncle Greg put Ds on a '6-4
I washed it on Monday so he bought me a gold chain
Chopped crack and watched ""Colors"" so I soaked up game
Drove the Impala on his lap, that was my role model
Used to let me kill the corner of his 40 ounce bottle
On the weekend him and my Pops flashed a 'Vette
Til' one weekend my uncle got stabbed to death
He got murdered by a fiend, my pops ain't like that
He was from Nutty Blocc, they used to call him Maniac
Crazy ass nigga, with a Black Panther tat'
Kill a nigga, cross him out on his Compton hat
Told me when I got older, I would understand that
It's blood in, blood out, and ain't no turnin' back
Few summers went by and we moved across the tracks
13, that's when I had my first (Olde English)
[Chorus: Dion]
Ol' English
Ridin' by, gettin' high
Smokin' on that chronic, drinkin' Ol' English
Rags tied, gang sign
Letters on my hat and, Ol' English
Drive-by, homicide
R.I.P. tats and Ol' English
Westside 'til I die
Niggas pourin' out that, Ol' English

[Verse 2: Game]
I was the first nigga with a Starter jacket on the block
Used to build model cars and make them motherfuckers hop
Moms banged Hoover Crip, she was known for sellin' rocks
Let me collect the 40 ounce bottles in the dope spot
Bought my first Converse, thought I couldn't be stopped
When I creased up my khakis and threw on my Ronnie Lott
Used to think that I was hard, so I stole my brother's Glock
And that's the day my life changed, 'cause that night he got shot
Killed by another Crip over his Rolex watch
I got high for three years off that ""Chronic"" from the Doc
I was drinkin' 40 ounces a lot
And every liquor store in Compton sold out the day Eazy dropped
I start bangin' red laces in my A-di-das
Drinkin' out a brown paper bag on my first drive-by
I was a menace to society
But I never left finger prints on my (Olde English)
[Chorus: Dion]
Ol' English
Ridin' by, gettin' high
Smokin' on that chronic, drinkin' Ol' English
Rags tied, gang sign
Letters on my hat and, Ol' English
Drive-by, homicide
R.I.P. tats and Ol' English
Westside 'til I die
Niggas pourin' out that, Ol' English

[Verse 3: Game]
I got a lot of dead homies, some Blood some Crip
This is life, stop watchin' that ""Boyz N The Hood"" shit
You see this red rag hangin' outta my jeans
I went to 20 funerals by the age of 19
Then I went to college, basketball was my dream
Quit the team, 'cause I'd rather shoot rock with the fiends
Wanted to be Freeway Rick
He showed me how to turn a stolen 5.0 into a brick
Bought a Cadillac, thought I was rich, bangin' DJ Quik
On Crenshaw got jacked for my shit
Took a long chronic hit, and thought about the time
When I was 12 years old and I emptied my first clip
Hit my first switch, same night fucked my first bitch
Thought I was dreamin 'til I pinched her tits
She caught a stray bullet ridin' shotgun in my shit
So I got her name tatted in (Old English)
[Chorus: Dion]
Ol' English
Ridin' by, gettin' high
Smokin' on that chronic, drinkin' Ol' English
Rags tied, gang sign

No huddle game plannin', my form outstanding

Swinging lane to lane, gripping grain like a battle ax
Camera man. Capture the future like it's here for me
While these cheerleaders cheer for me

Genius Rap,Dr. Jeckyll & Mr. Hyde,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Hey, we're fresh, def, new and improved
We've come to rock a party just for you
Step up to the floor and grab a girl
We'll make a bald man's hair curl

[Both]
Now everybody here has seen us before
We took a little chill and now we're back for more
While we were away we worked both day and night
And now we think we've got it right
We're the twins of spin, we're about to begin
So open up the door and let the people in
It's not a movie  premiere or a TV show
Well it's the kings of swings, so be the first to know
And have no doubt that we can turn you out
Because rockin' the house is what we be about
I'm Dr. Jeckyll (And I'm Mr. Hyde)
And we rock the house side by side
So don't just stand there lookin' around
Won't you c'mon c'mon? (Won't you c'mon c'mon?)
Won't you c'mon c'mon? Let's all get down
So everybody in the house be the first to know
It's not the hip-hop or the disco, it's not Don Juan or Romeo
It's the Jeckyll AND -- the Jeckyll AND -- the Jeckyll AND Hyde Show
So Dr. Jeckyll is my man (Okay)
Just get on the mic and do what you can-can
[Dr. Jeckyll]
Well, my name Dr. Jeckyll and I'm on the ball
And time never catches me off the wall
I do anything three steps ahead
And just like the man said
I've been to the mountaintop
And I'm guaranteed to rock the spot
I'm full of fire, full of fun
The chief rocker Dr. Jeckyll, you're number one
H-Y? (Uh-huh?)
D-E? (That's me!)
Just get on the mic and rock for me

[Dr. Hyde]
Well, my name is Mr. Hyde and time is always on my side
So I take as much time as I please

So won't you hurry, hurry, come and see my show
Once you're under my spell I'll never let you go
And I'll be your baby at your request
'Cause I know you want nothing but the best

[Bridge: Both]
To Manhattan, shout it out! (Hey!)
To the Bronx, shout it out! (Ho!)
In Brooklyn, shout it out! (Ho!)

Well, they're rockin' on McDonaldland
Well, everybody's just having fun

And shake 'em through the atmosphere
You're feelin' good, you're on the go
Somebody say ""Gigolo!""

Say ho, ho! (Ho, ho!)
Say ooh, ahh, ooh ooh ahh! (Ooh, ahh, ooh ooh ahh!)

[Dr. Hyde]
I got a picture of me and a Sony TV and a funky stereo (Oh, yeah?)
But I have no time to enjoy myself because I'm puttin' on an MC show
I get a penthouse on Central Park and I got a lovely view
Just come on over to my crib, girl, and it'll be about me and you
I turn off my TV and my stereo and then I even close my door
And by the time I'm finished with you, sweetheart, you'll wanna come back for me
'Cause my picture's in JET magazine, I'm on the cover of TV Guide (Get funky!)
They voted me MC of the year, the vicious Mr. Hyde
Well, I think it's time for Dr. Jeckyll to rock
So c'mon, Doc, it's your turn to rock

[Dr. Jeckyll]
So girls call me a lover baby doll and that I can't deny (Whoo!)
There ain't a woman on earth that I can't handle
I give them all the time, you know why? (Say what)
I'm a policeman to all the fellas (Uh huh)
'Cause I can stop them before they start
And I'm a fireman to the young ladies because I can put out the fire in their hearts
I'm like Superman!
And don'tcha know they call me the Man of Steel?
I got jazz, pizzazz, and razzamatazz, I even got sex appeal! So
When you come to my house and you walk through the door, please remember to close the gate (Why, doc?)
'Cause when you come to see Dr. Jeckyll baby doll, be ready to operate
[Both]
Now, we walk these streets without a care!
Spend cash money like millionaires!
And we walk on water, fly through air
And got a picture of ourself on our underwear...
Like Ginger Rogers, Freddy Astaire
Like Boo-Boo, girl, and Yogi the Bear, and Joe the Ranger
He best be aware of the two MCs that are debonair
Now, the only thing that we've got to say is c'mon and give that bass a play!

And if you're feelin' good and you got it like that
Now somebody say, ""And you know that!"" (And you know that!"")
Now if you feel in the mood to dance, now's the time, this is your chance
Just get on the floor, don't hesitate
While I rock my mic it's time to operate
Yeah I'm on time each and every night
And I can mix the beat and add the rock
And just as sure as five and five adds up to ten
If I can do it once, well, I can do it again
So, Dr. Jeckyll (That's me!)
My man (C'mon!)
Just get on the mic and do what you can

[Dr. Jeckyll]
Well, just get up our your seat and let your fingers pop
It's time for the sweet Doc to rock the spot
Now, wham, bam, here I am
I'm like a superstar in partyland
And from the shores of California to the coast of New York (Oh yeah!)
All the women like the way I walk and talk (Why?)
'Cause I got style, I got grace, and I think my ladies are the best today (Uh, uh!)

Now if you're feeling good, and things are funny
Like Elmer Fudd and my man Bugs Bunny
Somebody say cash money (Cash money!)
Cash money (Cash money!)
So keep it comin', y'all
Just keep it, keep it, keep it comin', y'all

[Outro]
Between Jeckyll and Hyde, side by side
So don't you girls get petrified
'Cause when we touch ya, you get electrified
And we won't let go 'til we're satisfied
'Cause we are the ones who are qualified
To give you the lovin' that can't be denied
We're gonna take you up to the hillside
Then lay you on back, side by side
And then we rock 'n roll with Jeckyll and Hyde"
Toy Soldier,Keri Hilson,['pop'],"[Intro]
So I guess I fell in love, with a toy soldier

[Verse 1]
He told me that our love would be marching on, hoorah, hoorah
He told me that our love was mighty strong, hoorah, hoorah
And guess I believed you, 'cause you were my baby
Why would I doubt you, when you said you loved me?
But I didn't know you were the enemy

[Pre-Chorus]
The only who made me cry, is you
And the only one I had to fight, is you
And it was you who told me, yeah

[Chorus]
He said, that I would never have to fight again
He said, that I would never have to cry again
He said he'd had been to the battlefield
My heart is safe with him
All my trust, I gave it to him
So I guess I fell in love with a toy soldier
[Verse 2]
You told me that you would take care of me, you lied, you lied
You told me that you was the best for me, you lied, you lied
'Cause you came up empty
I feel like you're tricked me
Everything you said you'd give me, you couldn't give me
Yeah, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the only one who ever made me cry, is you
And the only one I had to fight, is you
And it was you who told me, yeah

[Chorus]
He said, that I would never have to fight again (That I would never have to, I would never have to fight)
He said, that I would never have to cry again (Oh baby)
He said he'd had been to the battlefield (We've been to the battlefield, oh)
My heart is safe with him
All my trust I gave it to him
So I guess I fell in love, I fell in love with a toy soldier

[Bridge]
I let down my guard because you were my guard
But who protects me now?
'Cause I gave you my heart and you tore it apart
Ooh, you let me down
Oh, baby
[Chorus]
He said, that I would never have to fight again (Never have to fight, oh yeah)
He said, that I would never have to cry again
He said he'd had been to the battlefield
My heart is safe with him
All my trust I gave it to him
So I guess I fell in love, with a toy soldier

I gave all my love to him, hoorah, hoorah
I gave all my love to him, hoorah, hoorah"
If My Homie Calls,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Ever since you was a pee-wee, down by my knee with a wee-wee
We been coochy-coo all through school, you and me, G
Back in the days we played practical jokes on
Everybody smoked with they locs and they yokes on
All through high school, girls by the dozens
Saying we cousins, knowing that we wasn't
But like the old saying goes
Times goes on and everybody grows
Grew apart, had to part, went our own ways
You chose the dope game, my microphone pays
In many ways we were paid in the old days
So far away from the crazies with AKs
And though I been around, clowning with the Underground
I'm still down with my homies from the hometown
And if you need, need anything at all
I drop it all for y'all, if my homies call

[Chorus]
But if you ever need a place to stay
Well, alright, y'all (Brothers and sisters)
But if you ever need a place to stay
Well, alright, y'all (Brothers and sisters), if my homies call
But if you ever need a place to stay
Well, alright, y'all (Brothers and sisters)
But if you ever need a place to stay
Well, alright, y'all (Brothers and sisters)
[Verse 2]
It's a shame, you chose the dope game
Now you slang 'caine on the streets with no name
It was plain that your aim was more 'caine
You got fame, now you reign with no shame
I chose rap tracks to make stacks
In fact, I travel the map with raps that spray cats
But now I don't wanna down my homie
No matter how low you go, you're not lonely
And I hear that you made a few enemies
But when you need a friend, you can depend on me
Call if you need my assistance, there'll be no resistance
I'll be there in an instant
Who am I to judge another brother, only on his cover?
I'd be no different than the others
H-to-the-O-to-the-M-to-the-I-to-the-E
I'm down to the E-N-D
'Cause it's a fall in no time at all
I'm down for y'all, when my homies call
Word, if my homies call

[Chorus]
But if you ever need a place to stay
Well, alright, y'all (Brothers and sisters)
But if you ever need a place to stay
Well, alright, y'all (Brothers and sisters), if my homies call
But if you ever need a place to stay
Well, alright, y'all (Brothers and sisters)
But if you ever need a place to stay
Well, alright, y'all (Brothers and sisters)
[Verse 3]
Well, it's '91 and I'm living kinda swell now
But I hear that you're going through some hell, pal
But life making records ain't easy
It ain't what I expected, it's hectic, it's sleazy
But I guess that the streets is harder
Trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
My homie is making it elsewhere
Striving, working nine-to-five with no health care
We both had dreams of being great
But his deferred and blurred and changed in shape
It's fate, it wasn't my choice to make
To be great, I'm giving it all it takes
Trying to shake the crates and fakes and snakes
I gotta take my place or fall from grace
The bullet's late, the pace is quick and great
Smiling face to hide the trace of hate
But my homie would never do me wrong
That's why I wrote this song, if you ever need me, it's on
No matter who the foe, they must fall
Us against 'em all, I'm down to brawl if my homies call

[Chorus]
But if you ever need a place to stay
Well, alright, y'all (Brothers and sisters)
But if you ever need a place to stay
Well, alright, y'all (Brothers and sisters), if my homies call
But if you ever need a place to stay
Well, alright, y'all (Brothers and sisters)
But if you ever need a place to stay
Well, alright, y'all (Brothers and sisters), if my homies call
But if you ever need a place to stay
Well, alright, y'all (Brothers and sisters)
But if you ever need a place to stay

Flyin' through the city with the pedal to the floor then
I put them 26, inches on the curb
Tell the hood I'm back, give me a corner let me swerve
Swerve, I'm still dope, that's my word
All I did was switch the kitchens and subtract all the birds

Half these niggas beefin' with me, I never heard of them

You can catch 'em on the couch, everyday at 4 o'clock like Ellen
Primetime nigga, is my time nigga
Jacob ain't got shit to do with my shine nigga
Cause when the sun come up
From behind the sea, niggas see me behind the B
ENT, don't stand for entertainment
It stand for zero to 60, anybody see where Game went?

The Chronic, Makaveli to Doggystyle
Bad influences, so my momma told me to turn 'em down
She went to sleep so my father said I could turn it up
What did he care, he in the bathroom sherm'n up
So I let that Dogg Pound rock
Let that Ice Cube knock, 'til my sister pressed stop
Soon as she left out, like Diddy, I Pressed Play
That's when that Hard Knock Life, introduced me to Just Blaze
I would sit in my room, and just blaze
Before chronic had all these funny names, it was just haze
No hash, cause it was just haze
And I would get so high, nigga that I would just gaze
I mean I was so amazed somethin' so fuckin green
Could turn this little-ass house into a maze
Chronic 2001, got me through my hardest days
And just think, my momma said marijuana was a phase

Yo Jay, what it do, nigga?
I done rocked enough fellas to be you, nigga

Whoever said “The Game over” must’ve had a hangover
Get money, my driveways sponsored by Range Rover
I got Blood Diamonds, straight outta Angola
The way my red rag in the air signal Lil Wayne over
Yeah, that’s when the Cris start poppin'
The pills start droppin' and the haters start watchin'
The DJ starts spinnin', the panties get to droppin'
For album number 3, and going Platinums not an option
I’m back with Cool & Dre, AKA ‘The Monsters'

Little Sally Walker, sittin' in a saucer
Oh, how I tossed that ass up
Like a mission in the woods, Woody Woodpecker would
If he could, but I didn't wanna pass it up
To the next man, had my Walkman bumpin'
On the fifty yard line and my adrenaline pumpin'
Like a killer thriller, driller tiller, out with the Miller brew
Fill 'er up, took it 'til the damn Dutch puked
Luke Skywalker ain't a sweet talker, so I got ill
With my lightsaber that came in one fancy flavor
My strange behavior led to an outburst
The night felt good, but the day got worse
I thought I was alone, Slim Tre the stowaway
With a brown-eyed bombshell that was dope enough to pay
I looked over my shoulder and my cover was peeled
By my whole school saying, ""Ooh,"" and I'm busted for real

My homey's M-O-M, what? (M-I-E)
Yo, and to think to day one
In my eyes, I show fear

His Mom's grinnin' ear-to-ear
Gigglin' and winks for weeks
I would encounter from this female
She's sizin' me up for the kill
""Oh, what the hell,"" is what I said to myself
So that I wouldn't worry
I'm sittin' on the couch
And wish Greg would please hurry, what? (Up)
She offered me a cup of Ripple
Broke out the titty, squeezed her nipple
Said, ""Suck it if you like, but please don't bite it""
I had an urge to say fuck it, but I knew I had to fight it
Before I could say alakazam carpet mow
I took this old bitch in the doggie style
Greg walked in the room, that nigga cold had a fit
But all this numbskull could say was, ""Oh shit!""

One fine summertime, Sunday evening
Crenshaw Boulevard was in full swing
Perfect example of how looks can be deceiving
Rolled up to what I thought was a pretty young thing
Rollin' in a purple Samurai Suzuki
Dookie braids was the aid to her sex appeal
Dude, she was dope!
Man, real dope, on the real
Well anyway, I went, ""Toot toot""
She said, ""Hey, beep beep""
The next day, rolled down to the beach
Tuesday, me and my new Crenshaw cutie
Coolin' on the beach and now she's rubbin' on my booty
Suck-suck-suckin' on my neck like Dracula
But it wasn't all that spectacular (Why?)
'Cause every time I tried to touch upon her tay-titty
She would be like, ""Quit, hehe""
Bitch was frontin', but I didn't say nothin'
Then all of a sudden, after someone pushed the button
I got a funny feeling like something was real wrong
Looked at her shoes and her feets was real long
Then it hit me, oh please god, no
Don't let this ho turn out to be a John Doe
He pulled a fast one on me, yo
I guess that's one of those things that make you go

Followed by Bill O'Reilly who read from the Qu'ran
President Bush sends condolences from Iran
Where Fox News reports live
That Ahmadinejad wins the Mandela Peace Prize
[Hook]
You would never know what you could ever be
If you never try, you would never see
Stayed in Africa, we ain't never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships, were no misery
Call me crazy, or isn't he?
See I fell asleep and I had a dream
It was all black everything

[Verse 2]
Uh, and it ain't no projects
Keepin' it real is not an understood concept
Yeah, complexion's not a contest
'Cause racism has no context
Hip-hop ain't got a section called ""Conscious""
Everybody rappin' like crack never happened
Crips never occurred nor Bloods to attack them
Matter of fact, no hood to attack in
Somalia is a great place to relax in
Fred Astaire was the first to do a backspin
The Rat Pack was a cool group of black men
That inspired five white guys called The Jacksons
Eminem fitted in, but then again
He inspired a black rapper tryin' to mimic him
And that's what really rose up out of Michigan
The ""sounding white"" rapper by the name of 50 Cent
[Hook]
You would never know what you could ever be
If you never try, you would never see
Stayed in Africa, we ain't never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships, were no misery
Call me crazy, or isn't he?
See I fell asleep and I had a dream
It was all black everything

[Verse 3]
Uh, and I know it's just a fantasy
I cordially invite you to ask why can't it be
Now we can do nothing about the past
But we can do something about the future that we have
We can make it fast or we can make it last
Every woman queen and every man a king and
When those color lines come we can't see between
We just close our eyes 'til its all black every-thing

[Hook]
You would never know what you could ever be
If you never try, you would never see
Stayed in Africa, we ain't never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships, were no misery
Call me crazy, or isn't he?
See I fell asleep and I had a dream
It was all black everything"

Real talk, watch a pro do this

[Verse One: Legacy] + (Ben J)
Umm excuse me, girl, yo' style is dope
You got swag too, noticed that a while ago
My name is Legacy and it's my first day here
I was wonderin if you could be my first date here
(Um, huh, excuse my friend)
(He's kinda new to meeting girls cause he's used to men)
Used to men!! (Girl this dude is stupid huh?)
Yo I ain't gay (Man why don't you tell the truth for once?)

Cashmere, Cashmere all I wanna do is see you smile
Cashmere, Cashmere, you don't need that dude Ben J
Cashmere, Cashmere, but yeah you wanna be my babe!

[Verse Two: Ben J] + (Legacy)
See it's like this, 5'11 with good sex
And unpredictable and keepin them girls guessin

I got the world in my palms so I can't hold my hands
(Nah bro, 5'8, swass size great)
(Long as hell I can make you lose weight)
(But your body off the chain, make me wanna scream)
(Even Keisha and The Game ain't even feel that much pain)
That was lame (you a lame) your momma (say what?) Nothin
But here c'mere girl let me give you some +McLovin+
I feelin you a lot and you the baddest thing yet
And my love ain't big enough (psh, that's what she said)
Can you stop? (Stop what? She lookin boreder than me)
And you lookin like a Hobbit off of Lord of the Rings
Damn! Now back to what's important to me

Cashmere, Cashmere, Legacy who? All you need is J
Cashmere, Cashmere, but yeah you wanna be my babe!
[Verse Three: Legacy]
He a dog girl, all he do is run and smell
You wanna buff Nick Cannon or a young LL?
Guess the point I'm tryin to make is he dumb as hell
And I can make you fall in love after one quick meal
Then she stopped, paused, stared in my eyes
And for the first time moved her mouth to reply
She said that she kissed a girl and she liked it
And ever since that night she was a full blood dyke chick
(What? Wait huh, did she just, what she say? Hell nah!!)

[Hook: New Boyz]
Cashmere, Cashmere, that's why yo' breath stink
Cashmere, Cashmere, what the hell's wrong with yo' teeth?

Things take a turn for the worse
Send him back where he came from
We got shots fired down the street

Alright, steady
Ba-di-yah, ba-di-yah
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
If they get the Villain surrounded then- (Ahem)

[Verse: MF DOOM]
Good to the last drop niglets
Hood 'til the blast pop them bigot-ass piglets
Go for the bosses' dicks or higher
Beatwalkers still get caught up in the crossfire
Get at the sarge, he give the orders
The rest of them punks'll quit the force or get slaughtered
Use stealth, play alleys, jet
We'd rather not alert them nosy Federales, yet
Keep the local random cases in each state
Escape to the beaches for the season and be straight
You on call, keep your Nikes on tight, no white
Anybody tell get lighted on sight
The ringer's on a need-to-know basis
No persons, places, things and no faces
Get bagged, you're on your own, acted alone
Back home, your fam'll be provided for while you're gone
It's a price on all snitches
If you nice, bring back eyes, fingers, toes and pictures
Send copies to those who singin' the blues
Mothers and fathers who's unjustly accused
Our species is in danger
Wear gloves and strike in a city where you a stranger
That'll let them fools know
And send them a message, let them P.O.W.'s go
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
Now you have your orders, do your duty
A new way to let the shots spray
A few drops a day, double espresso, D.A. latte
No smell nor taste, hardly traceable
Wait to waste a prosecutor paid to get the case pulled
Learn 'em a lesson for givin' bros mad stresses
A long list of C.O.'s names and addresses
A fake judge with many years on the bench
That sent some good cats to the chair, was aired in a trench
They say her tongue was teared out, smeared and drenched
The whole system scared in doubt with a fear stench
And she was tortured, some say post-mortem
The suspect took his own life before they caught him
It's real spooky like a real trife movie
Remember the part when Terminator killed Tookie
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
If they get the Villain surrounded, son, then shit
Shed blood, some'll be shooken
Just look with they head in the mud, red flood (Villain!)
[Outro]
One of the things we ran into the unknown
We we couldn't get at the door pulled as quick as we wanted to
And once we did, finally pull the door and breach the interior door
There's a man trapped inside of it
Basically that man trap is a cage

While we're just, we're stuck in a cage"

One for the heal

We gonna hit the nigga up

Yea, Im goin' in; Drake
Runnin' like a sprinter when his ankle full of attaint
Got my mind on my money
Eyes on my neighbors
Never know whats your spot till they say back, till the base, back to the wall
Cuzz I never stall like the bathroom in a mall
You can tell them all
Ridin' through my avenue, they better kill us all
Cuz even my daddy shoots
Say you gon' get me? Boy I got a gun too
See you on my side, watch you rise like the sun do
Hey yo honcho, built for rain like a poncho
Under pressure all you say is uncle
Yea, never hard as they look
I never judge a cover 'fore I open up the book
Wayne we can split the plate, but I'mma take dessert
This will only take the second, but I always come first yellin'

I drove first, this that quick animation
You smell that stench, you just stink sanitation
I'm right here, nigga fuck the location
Cuz too much information can get you that vacation
Yea, if niggers actin' how they feel
Then I pull it out the jacket, get to clappin' like a seal
Yea, kidnappin' the little ones
Throwin' bitch niggers off the back of the buildin'
Die now I'mma think about it later
I'mma think about it never, all I think about is paper
I hope you know to fly and sincerely
I would do the same thing to everyone you live with
Tell the cops I say ""Fuck the allegation""
Got work in the trunk with no conversation
Everything stand for sendin' to the heavens sky
Weezy F Baby, boy get it right everytime

[Verse 3]
Y'all know my stylo, gotta big ego
I'm really superman, I'm Japan a loco hero
Count this to Netto, split it with the ghetto
M.O.B. to the cash I say hello
Finally got a load of me and everybody notice me
My girl gon' need a ladder if she think she gon' get over me
Call me mister Pay-so, movin' at Pay-tio
You could'nt even catch if you was Y-Generatio
Man I think it's racio, they dont like the name Blaack
Couple more strikes but I swear I'm the same cat
Never be a zero all my life, my chain like smart kids, all of them bright

Revolutionary, scary
Thought provoking, spoken
Words of a change I don't feel but I see
Visions from me at 23
Making it free in my community
One day is what I live for
Ain't thinking about no hope no more
I got my boots I kick it 'til I get with
Adapt and overcome, oh hum hum
Go get my gun, load up for fun, and put down with the frown
What goes round comes round from M.L.K. to Cascade
I know it's through them plenty figures
Cocaine dealers walk the wrong side
Up in they rides
Looking cleaner then I seen them the last time
Then selling dimes, now its quarter ki's, stacking G's
In the South Indies
My nigga them folks riding bicycles among vehicles
Off in the hood
Knowing each and every nigga selling, but can you blame
The fact the only way a brother can survive the game
The block hard to get by the dope dealing
Fatal killings, and fed time, to writing rhymes
It ain't just the police
We kill each other just lost another brother
Fast living will get you took
Thinking it can't happen to you and then it do
Off crooked schemes it's just a dream
Floating face down in the mainstream

Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream

They swan diving
As if they name be Gretchen von Ivan
Volkoff rushin' to finish their album then you find them
Lost dog paddling, backstroking, what done happened?
Be rhyming ""catch of the day"" when the recipe calls for ""blackened""
Wrong ingredients
Maybe too much herbs and spices
Maybe you got hungry for the wrong dish
Of them greens and it's enticing how them Jones's sing
So I'm gonna sing just like them to get where they at
I'll even break my by back to touch their rim, if I gotta
My alta mater be that I follow
I bite whatever that's looking tasty, water it down and then swallow
I hope you vomit, won't call no names cause that's not my job
It just applies to whom it may concern, you know who you are
But if you don't you never will, you just receive the steel
But then it might get ugly 'cause trust me niggas do feel
The way that I felt when I wrote this, but we must stay in focus
We kings and queens up in this thing, get rid of all them jokers
Face down, face down, face down

I let you stay in my crib
Now you know where I live
When you was hungry, fed you a hot meal
Look at the hand you deal
Me crudball business, niggas giving inches, so here, take a foot
Luck only counts in rabbit's feet and horseshoes
Experience is sometimes the best teacher until we get our own plate
I hope you don't mind me eating off of yours
Process sm-m-moking like Jerry
Meanwhile, fairies up the street sprinkling pixie dust over greenery
Never to attain another level of conscience
Only to test, the potency
Why laying here, they scheme over one another mouth to feed
Deceased with a decision to make, now words shake your destiny
But one miss will take it all the way, just as quick as you can say
""I wish I never did what I did,"" now face this bid
It was the company you kept, the many places you slept
When you shouldn't have, geeking like a rat, jumping like a trap
Contributing to sin and your nigga bitch in the club showing pink for 10
They got you niggas where they want you again
Floating face down in the mainstream
That's why, that's why, that's why

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Everybody's a player, wearing them Kangols on their head
Thinking it's all about your clothes, nigga, it's all about your self
The way you feel about your life, the times that you done shared with
Your friends and family, up and down like hoes give head
To dicks, oh, six, serving them in the mix, but ain't no mystery
You know the history about this clique, bitch
Oh, what, you want me to call you slut?
Then why you fucking all them niggas letting them all up in your guts
But see that AIDS I'm afraid that's why I play the quiet role
I lay in the cut, every month thinking I'll let that fire roll
Like chimneys, and smoke signals, maybe peace pipes even
My partners call me Big Boi and my first name is not Steven
In the mainstream, home team banging them with these hits
In the mix, flowing like some motherfucking swordfish

It's clear to me he'll fuck up his own cash
Now take your little freestyle and shove it up your ass
Followed by the ""oohs"" and ""aahs""
Your foolish pride done fucked around
And put you on the losing side, who got bodied?
Nigga, you sick? Then I'm a hot toddy
Coke flow, I spit so much Whitney I got Bobby
I'm a sound off, this nigga's a clown y'all
Fifty niggas with him wearin' jheri curls, hoppin' out of clown cars
Shows over Bozo, no mo', I'm back
Time to face the music, I'mma just straight up abuse him
He choose to diss, but he don't know what he gettin'
While he's spittin' funny shit, I'm gettin' money bitch
C'mon I'm a product of my environment
He ain't gotta try to bring Malcolm out of retirement
He go at me I hit him ASAP, take that
Get shot up like a cap gun at a race track
He's probably from the part of the Bay where the gay's at
Where the fags migrate and give each other AIDS at
They told me that you ain't the pistol type
So yo, you know to me that means you a Frisco dyke
Get you a whoopin' like Whoopie

I'm just fuckin' with you cause I got ""Nothin To Do""
This Mistah Fag, he's a waste of my time
And my time is money so I'm wastin' money just makin' this rhyme
It ain't beef but I would like to shoot your jeweler
Your charm look like some kind of retarded school bus
All you missin' is the ""duh"" and the drool

It's not corny, he's still here too
But I don't care cause, I'm so funny

The streets will teach you
I love for The Bay nigga, Skee my people
The problem is, you think you lyrically my equal
But that don't balance out I gotta Keak the Sneak you

You never slang like 40, you tryin' to be B-Legit
I will eat your soul

You ain't the only one that got riddles, I got two
Check it, one: Flabby, Fabby, fuck you
Fucked yo mammy, we family cause I'm yo daddy, son
Two: Yeah, pussy thought you took me
Want a cookie? Cause nobody seems to care

With the spirit shootin' at him 'til his body disappears
Lookey here, I will put your crew in boxes
I done put whole crew in boxes
And it best he stops cause I will Freddie Foxxx him
Put him out with the tools or boxing
So think about your next move, I will let you choose your option
Top ten, dead or alive, and I got soldiers
You cast your little punk ass stones at me, I throw back boulders!
Oh yeah, it's over, hold that
Nigga this is G's up, I speed up right where you slow at
Lyrically you Borat, boring, do anything for a laugh
You know that's... annoying
It's sounds that perhaps you doubt me
Well if you ever ever make it to my city, ask about me
Your luck's over 'cause all you tried to do is be famous
So now you famous nationwide for gettin' fucked over
Boy pay up, I ball, this a fo' sho' lay up
I'm playin' Chess with a Connect Four player!

It's obvious I hear you talkin' loud
I'm clappin' all day like I'm cheerin' in the crowd
I'm bout to catch a body, I'ma bust a mag boy
I'm bout to catch a body, I'ma bust a mag boy
I'll kill ya'! If you ain't never ran from a nigga
Then you damn sure should probably pick a day to start runnin'

Who ride dick so well, head game from Hell
I love making them yell, my name
Rule baby, and ain't shit gon' change, uh, uh"
Letter to the King,The Game,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Hi-Tek]

[Verse 1: The Game]
Second floor of my hotel, I'm rollin' up, 'bout to blaze
And zone out, to this Frankie Beverly and Maze
As I daze about the past, and them days in the past
He set my mind free, so my mind free at last
So much that I don't even drink from a fuckin' glass
I'd rather find the first fountain I can and do it fast
Didn't understand the dream of a King, I do the math
Coincidentally on your birthdays, I ditched the class
Cause the younger me, dumber me was chasin' the cash
Chasin' the ass, lowlife with his face in the grass
Ridin' home from school, in front of the bus
Not even thinkin' 'bout how Rosa Parks done it for us
How she stayed behind bars and she done it for us
And she stayed behind bars 'til she won it for us
Sometimes I wanna give up or at least take a break
That's when I close my eyes and see Coretta Scott's face
(Ohhhh)
Cause sometimes I wanna give up or at least take a break
That's when I close my eyes and see Coretta Scott's face
[Chorus: Sample]
Way up high, saw it all
A whole new world outside this bubble
A whole new world outside this bubble
Way up high, I will fly
I will hover the world
Saw it all

[Verse 2: Nas]
Uhh, word up, Game
Standin' at the pew, panaramic view of the seatin' and greetin'
I've been meanin' to do me some letter readin'
To the King, he forever breathin', your message is never leavin'
Some of your homies phonies, I should've said it when I see them
Them sleazy bastards, some greedy pastors, jerks
Should never be allowed at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta
So people be patient, I know this ghetto grammar
But I'm a street dude, normally I just speak rude
Martin Luther, the martyr, the trooper, hate killed him
Nobel Peace Prize winner, they duplicate your feelin'
As a kid I ain't relate really
I would say your dream speech jokingly, 'til your words awoke in me
First I thought you were passive, soft one who ass kissed
I was young but honest, I was feelin' Muhammad
I ain't even know the strength you had to have to march
You was more than just talk, you the first real Braveheart
We miss you
Feel like King be in me sometimes
[Chorus: Sample]
Way up high, saw it all
A whole new world outside this bubble
A whole new world outside this bubble
Way up high, I will fly
I will hover the world
Saw it all

[Verse 3: The Game]
The word ""nigga"" is nothin' like ""nigga""
Don't sound shit alike, like Game, like Jigga
One came before the other, like aim and pull the trigga
One is slang for my brother, one is hang and take a picture
The rope ain't tight enough, he still alive, go fix it
Pour some gasoline on him, call his daughters black bitches
Make 'em pick cotton, while they mama cleanin' up the kitchen
Same cotton in white T's, that's the cotton they was pickin'
If Dr. King marched today, would Bill Gates march?
I know Obama would but would Hilary take part?
Great minds think great thoughts
The pictures I paint, make the Mona Lisa look like fake art
I feel the pain of Nelson Mandela
Cause when it rains it pours, I need Rihanna's umbrella
For Coretta Scott's tear drops, when she got the phone call
That the future just took a fuckin' head shot
I wonder why Jesse Jackson ain't catch him before his body dropped
Would he give me the answer? Probably not
[Chorus: Sample]
Way up high, saw it all
A whole new world outside this bubble
A whole new world outside this bubble
Way up high, I will fly
I will hover the world
Saw it all
I will hover the world
Saw it all"
Bed Rock Asian Remix,Tim Chantarangsu,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Illmillion]
It was back when, we was in the stone age
I was just a no-name, who clearly had no game
She was beautiful and had me suicidal
And so I was too entitled to my grave like Mr. Cobain
It's never easy to be with my nefertiti
But when she come out her tomb, tell her she better see me
And I'll tell her I'm way more than what her ex got
Cuz I'm just like bamm-bamm, I could really make her bedrock

[Verse 2: Traphik]
Okay, I get it, lemme think, I see ya hips talk
Maybe it's time to put this penis on ya lip gloss
Got that ass bumpin', girl, I raise ya booty levels
Gotchu grubbin' on my crumpets like they was some fruity pebbles
Everytime I go down, they'll be no sound but you moaning
Takin ova yo spot late at night, CONAN
You know I'm Traphik, if you're comin' I will not stop
Til I explode all in ya mouth- pop rocks!

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Ooh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby
My room is the G-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone, I can make your bed rock
[Refrain: Lloyd]
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock, girl
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock (Ayy!)

[Verse 3: Tommy C (from IBU)]
I thought I had it all, until you came along
If I'm not with you, Ima need you on the telephone
Just the sound of your voice gets me all sprung
And when I do get a taste, girl, I'm so gone
Let's get it started, no ifs, ands, or buts about it
The way you move makes a grown man act retarded
Screen's flashin', lights, camera, action
We can make a movie called 24 hours of passion

[Verse 4: Lil Crazed]
I said, now shorty here's some info, baby I'm a nympho
I make it hot like volcanoes but I don't use flint stones
Give you that kimbo, that break backs like limbo
Try to test me so I gave her number 2 like pencils
Swag in the bag that keep her wanting
I act how I brag and the way I'm flaunting
She like that cockiness, so I please her properish
It's so obvious, she want me to demolish it
Osama bin Laden, often I'm just gon get to bombin' it
[Chorus: Lloyd]
Ooh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby
My room is the G-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone, I can make your bed rock

[Refrain: Lloyd]
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock, girl
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock (Ayy!)

[Verse 5: Skip]
I only tell her once, I do not send again
And I can make her turn the matress to a water bed
Show her a live time, when I'm gone, she feels left for dead
I call her my girl of the week, so she just calls us a newly wed
She know she wanna bang, so I pull out the pistol
We form a perfect picture, we got the megapixels
I wear no contacts, to see it's you and I
So sign this contract, put ya heart on that dotted line

[Verse 6: Dee]
Miss lady want a man. she said I'm suitable
Her jeans are bootyful, she so damn beautiful
She got that good brain. she on my honor roll
I give it to her raw just like a sushi roll
I blow her pussy up, yeah, Ima bomber
She say that I'm her king, so I get honor
I made her bed rock just like a concert
She like my energy, pussy monster
[Chorus: Lloyd]
Ooh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby
My room is the G-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone, I can make your bed rock

[Refrain: Lloyd]
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock, girl
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock (Ayy!)

[Verse 7: Phlip]
Babygirl, they call me Philly and I can make it happen
I can tell you really want it by the way I feel you graspin'
And I'm really bad, you can call me Michael Jackson
Ima be on top of you something like a fraction
Babygirl I'm bam bam, gonna make your bedrock
Put a grandslam on that body you can call me redsocks
Yeah I know you tight like dreadlocks, get that dome like I'm in a headlock
Babygirl, I'll call you Wilma, ill show you how Fred rocks!

[Verse 8: Trixx]
Faded off the ground, leanin' on patron
Tunnel vision on her like my peripherals are gone
So listen, baby, now I can make your bedrock
Play the right cards and I'll be all up in your wet spot
Climbin' up your mountain til I reach the tip-top
We fly, our destination is my room, next stop
Tryna land my big plane down on your little strip
Service good? Leave a tip
In the morning, leave the crib

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Ooh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby
My room is the G-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone, I can make your bed rock

[Refrain: Lloyd]
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock

Dont Let Me Die,Lil B,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Lil B]
This is Red Flame
Devil Music Edition
And nah I don't worship the devil
Pretty much
This a metaphor
For music
And what the people, artists
And I see them feeding the communities
But listen to this

I got the game on smash
I brought it to the front
This is foes
This is the hood
Niggas'll never front
Word to God I never prayed to money
Asked angels above
I seen niggas shady and hungry
I kept moving
Knowing once I was a hitter
Mind controlled by TVs and niggas
The terminator is a hood-saviour
Flavor
But no flavor in love
Girls are shady like clubs
Let you in the V.I.P. with no love
Fuck a bitch
Bitch I'm getting paper
What the fuck is a label?
And why these people in labor
Working harder than slavers
Try to watching the news with no cable
A lot of dark nights involving hustling
People struggle
Put faith in the deadly dozen
Money
Destruction
Hate
Extermination
Please don't speak the fatal disease
People sleeping in peace
We at war in a place overseas
And we still lie praying to Jesus
People shoot and they bleeding
Murderers be getting hunted by demons
Ride on you with the pump and they heathens
Ride on you and squeeze it, went to sleep
He woke up and met Jesus
Pray to God I wake up when I'm sleeping
One eye for the suckers
One eye for the world believing
Third eye in the middle for weedin'
When you live in the suite
In the hood they bust on you like semen
Can't compare if no love in your heart
You gotta forgive
You gotta learn that the people are smart
You gotta have the love in your heart
I'm speaking for real
I coulda rapped about how real that I am
To tell the truth it's for the people indeed
I'm planting my seeds
Next time I'll be a legend indeed
Until then
Appreciate me
I'm speaking for peace
Don't let me die
And see the legend in me

Don't let me die then see the legend in me

The battlegrounds are never found

That come around
You never scared, you never found
We ridin' round with the chopper
In the backseat
Money in the backseat
Thoughts on our mind

Gats in our hand that show these suckers due then done got meet
Why you play Lil B?
Now you finna go to sleep
Guaranteed he paid back
Remember me from way back?
Yeah Summer, he a cat
Never know who change that
Now it's time to meet to the maker

Face-to-face, bullets, ammunition give 'em playback
If you can't hear that
Please have 'em lit back
After all that
Take 'em
And get his grip back
I'mma lay him down up in the coffin like a Kit-Kat

Play the game a little smarter
Watching through the curtains

My Turn,Diabolic,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
It's my turn
I was given the power
And I'd rather die fighting than live as a coward
If I do what I feel and say what I want
At least you'll know it's me when you're playing my song
[2X]

[Verse 1]
Got evil through my soul
Jealous and hatin'
It's a hell of a statement but I'd sell it to Satan
End up handcuffed in a cell in his basement
Praying to Jesus when I fell to the pavement
I ain't got religion or a pot to piss in
I think the worst it happens the plot just thickens
The clock is ticking
I don't twist words
I'll leave your throat slit in six thirds like Nick Berg
I can flip birds
Make the cash I like
But I'd rather write, make fun of death, and laugh at life
Parasites will take what I stack for spite
Cause I get G's when I flip P's like Vanna White
Today was a good day, I drove past your wife
Got her number and I'mma get the ass tonight
I'll slash you twice
Ain't showing remorse
I’ll just catch a body, like you’re throwin' a corpse
[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
(Here we go)
Excuse me lady look how crazy your driving him
Got 99 problems, my bitch is 85 of em
I've changed
At war with my mind frame
Scheming to even the score like tied games
I've gained loss
Where pain's the main course
Me and my alter ego don't share the same thoughts
My brain's warped
I don't buy what stars sell me
But I'll double team a troubled teen with R. Kelly
Begin some rumors that offend consumers
I'm sadistic with a twisted sense of humor
I wanna body 8 Jakes with a straight face
And leaving 'em leaking like info bout Kobe's rape case
I love to gamble but I'm the same soldier
Who won't bet the under cause I'm bout to take over
There'll be no second guessing me chump
Cause I'll murder you if you ever question me once

[Hook x2]
[Verse 3]
Tortured genius more respect less connected
The aborted fetus, Immortal Tech resurrected
The filthiest affiliate
But don't feel me if I impale ‘em on the coathanger they killed me with
I do an eye for an eye
But I don't respect ya
So I used an aids needle to stab both your retinas
Student and teacher
Killed my own professor
He ain't understand I was too old to lecture
I paper chase and hustle but hate to scuffle
When we go hand and hand I always break your knuckles
I'll bless the mic
That's my only offer
You couldn't bless shit with a toilet full of holy water
I'll use brute force to introduce two forts
Fornicate with your mind
Fuck what you thought
Life's too short so I'm not concerned
I'll show you how to do this
Just watch and learn

It's my turn
I was given the power
And I'd rather die fighting than live as a coward
If I do what I feel and say what I want
At least you'll know it's me when you're playing my song

If I don't look at you, it's cause I don't know you
Know where to go to, know where to hide
What does it take, nowadays to survive

[Verse 1 - KRS-ONE]
Small-time rappers aren't as dope as us
When you hear rappers in the club, you hope it's us
Back in the days, they used to smoke the dust
But cats kept jumping off the roof too much
So today we don't abuse the Dutch
We use our minds to write rhymes that you can touch
My feet stay planted on the ground
You want that soft pop shit, you better book another sound
We gets down, I know the streets
Y'all rappers got maps out, looking all around
Huh! Y'all want the crown, but why should I battle you
If next week they're gonna put you in the ground?
That's a waste of time; I'd rather blaze a rhyme
On someone tryin to raise they mind
Bucktown, USA (BUCK-TOOOOOWN!) - Boogie Down connect
Yo Buck, what the fuck they gon' say?
[Verse 2 - Buckshot]
Who cares!
They want that pop shit, that soft hip-hop shit
That KRS and Buck not shit - BOY!
Beats bangin on your door like rent time
I invent the rhyme that was meant for your mind orrrr
I get physical, I mean physi-kal
I might lean with a smile and kill you in style
Wow! I am just the smartest MC
I am known as what you call an artist MC
See, part of me be like ""Pardon me""
The other half be like, ""Motherfuck manners! Bust the hammer""
Damn I, feel like a mattress the way they keep sleepin on me
They don't see I'm the craft-matic
Huh, I spread everywhere, led everywhere
Shot ricochet and bounce back looking heavy, yeah!

I tune in to your satellite radio or FM station

Been under construction for two years

Left foot, right foot, steppin' over biters
It's like the game is haunted 'cause there's so many ghostwriters

Layin niggas off they job? Nigga, for real?

Help a brother get up out this pigpen
But nobody wants to keep it pimpin' or a hundred and ten
So with this pen I begin to illustrate from within, boy (boy)

Whenever you got brothers and sisters you know I'm sayin
Comin' up out of poverty, you know what I'm sizzlin'
Doing something positive like music, you know what I'm sizzlin'
And making money I mean you know what I'm sayin'
I mean where is the motherfuckin' death in that?

[Verse 1]
I was born in 71' in Kansas City, MO
My mama was a heavenly one, so the fam was pretty slow
When it came to rap and R&B and plenty more
Check it, if it wasn't no gospel, apostle
Or written in the Bible, then it go
So when they tell the baby don't do something
Then it end up doing it anyway
Like, don't listen to rap, it's the evil music of today
But, I really fell in love with the sound
That was coming out from the East Coast
So we got it and twisted it up a bit
Now the industry's having a heatstroke
Some say that rap is dead
But when I get the white, black and red
And jump on the tour bus, do 58 shows
Then I'm back with a big black sack of bread
Can't believe that that was said, 'cause I'm here with a stack of fed
And I got it from rap/hip-hop or whatever and I did not have to beg
So, here I stand, the mic in hand with my rap attire
And I like my fans spending grands 'cause we got the fire
I merchandise like 5 G's every half an hour
And you cry like a baby so your mic must be your pacifier
[Hook]
When I read the magazine, them rapper's sounding like

If it's negative, I don't wanna hear it
Eliminating player haters with they evil spirits

[Verse 2]
I hear 'em talkin', they mad at Smurf and Soulja Boy
They hating big in the magazine and don't even know the boys
I know the ploy, washed up rappers wanna attack people
Run up to the car, pull out the Mac Lethal
Man that's a problem with the black people now
What ya need to know is that, in the world there's a lot of dough to stack
And the ones that wanna hold us back ain't been outside their cul-de-sac
Every nigga I know is strapped, rip shows that'll blow ya back
But notice that, I can put it right down to where the shoulders at
Hating on the south? Why? Trippin' off them chips they got
You don't like that it's screwed and chopped
But you wanna get off in they pot
Wanna be MC, you talk a lot, up in the spot and you hot
'Cause their 84's be poking out, what the hell is you cryin' 'bout?
Everybody wanna be killer but not for realer
'Bout the method of making money you gotta get the milla
By doin' it like I do it, do the work and believe in it
When you do it to the fullest ain't no problem achieving it
When I was broke, homie I went for mills
Got on the mic with the intent to kill
Stronger than ever, and you a gimp for real

You should be clapping when folk make it up out the ghetto
Or trailer park, it don't matter even if he black or if he guerro
But you don't know how to be manly
Instead of a Timberland, you probably in a stiletto
Better yet in a baby shoe, jealous or maybe you
Sick of me 'cause I'm making dinero
And you don't wanna get clapped at
You want a standing ovation? I thought not!
You say you better than rappers on radio, man that's false chop
Try to run up on me, 'cause a Benzo will never be in your car slot
Try to step up on the scene, my infrared beam's right at your soft spot
If you was on TV and balling you wouldn't groan and trip
He'd keep hatred, envy, and bloodshed on his lip
Tech got long cream with chrome things on his whip
He wanna stone Nin' with a chrome thing on his hip
But just know your hip will not stop the hop
'Cause when you look at the big picture, my block pops a lot daily
So keep on thinking my Guac stops the shots
And I can quickly bury you in your OshKosh B'gosh, baby

[Verse 1]
(Let's get ready to rumble)
In this corner we have the funk bodysnatcher
P-Funkadelic and I gat ya
Hard enough that I can chew a whole bag of rocks
Chew an avenue, chew an off street and off block
Then turn around and do the same damn thing to a soloist
'Cause Reggie Noble's pissed
I crush the whole brain frame
'Cause you couldn't maintain the funk
That have your rap style for lunch, chump
'Cause '92, I take a whole crew
Give them a punch of the funk
Knock all of their gold tooth loose (Pow)
To show you what type of stuff I'm on, you can't puff or sniff it
Because I was born with it
The Funkadelic Devil, hit you with the rap level of ten
Then one, two, three, you're pinned
I get action, so everybody jump wit' your rump
If you like the way it sounds punk, pump it in your back trunk
And let loose with the juice when I do rock
I'm too hot, some say I got more Juice than 2Pac
Straight outta Jersey
You heard me, my brother, I'm laughin'
Time for some action

[Verse 2]
Lights, camera, cock back the hammer (Explosion)
Straight from the Land of the Lost
I'ma hit you with the funk force
That make you run your rap style back to the crack aisle, brotha
Then strike a pose like Madonna
My mom's kicked me out because I did what I want ta
The original P-Funk, chump, dump a trunk of funk
In your skull caps 'cause my jaw snaps with the raw rap
So color me bad, plus color me black
For the funk that I pack, Red freak it to the funk track
(The funky fly stuff)
Come on and let me kick
(The funky fly stuff)
Just to show you where the hell I come from
I get dumb with the one, one, two
Check my rep from my hip when I have sex (Like this)
Make you twist to the list
Of a funky brain cell when it's puffed on a spliff
And all that, the hi hat, go buy that
Listen, look, oops, brother, where your eyes at?
They on the floor, pick 'em up
While I pour lyric funk down your brain, punk
Listen to my name, chump
(Redman ready to rock)
I got a Glock, then pow, your body is all over the block
Tryin' to step to this, the exorcist, kick it
I get mad wicked when Twin cock the biscuit
And blow your head off
Just for asking ""Who's the one rapping?"" (Poo-pow)
Time for some action
[Chorus: B-Real]

Yo, 1992, Redman gets paid
Yeah, know what I'm sayin'?
We not goin' for the Okee Doke, believe that
Hit Squad is definitely in the house (In the house)
For the brothers that don't be knowin', what's up?
Word is bond, I gotta show them the flava

[Outro]
Back to the funk track like Black Sheep
My man jump say, uh
""Who's the Redman? Where's the Redman?""
I kill, I smother, I get down with the (Yo, yo, yo, chill)

Uncle Chucky, Will you read us a bedtime story please huh please?

Alright... You kids get to bed I'll get the story book...

Here we go...

[Game]
Slam the impala door hopped out what do you see
Some niggas hangin' on the fence lookin' at me
I had phat red laces in my Adidas
Big chain around my neck like mardi grass
So I stepped up to them is there a problem here?
One nigga lifts his shirt then he yells out ""yeah""
So I turned around quickly and jumped in my car
I was about to hit the switch then I thought like ""nahh""
So I reached under my seat, and I grabbed my shit
It was a chrome four five with the kung fu grip
Stuffed it inside my dickies as I jumped out the car
Kept my hand on the trigger as I walked to the store
One nigga walks in, then here comes two
""what did you do?""
I shot!
Are you crazy fool?
One nigga hit the ground then the other two scrammed
Now the cops are outside
Well i'll be damned
It was 7:15 on my rolex watch
And I can't do the time that my rolex got
And like the hands on the clock, I went this way, thatta way
Ran around the corner, and that's when I threw my gat away
And impala passes, its my homeboy clyde
He gave me the hand signal, so I jumped in his ride
It was a clean six fo, original inside
With no key in the ignition
Where'd you get this clyde?
Nevermind, I'm out, its a stolen whip
And I'm already runnin' from the cops and shit
So I hopped out the car like the Dukes of Hazzard
Then clyde yells out ""you stupid bastard""
Start runnin though traffic and I almost get hit
I lost one of my shoes, its my airforce, shit
I'm haulin down the street with one shoe on
Walked straight into some niggas with all blue on
I only ran 30 blocks, how I end up in long beach
Cause in california the gangs in arms reach
He seen my red strings so he punched and caught me
So I knocked his ass out and took his boy out his barklys
I ain't seen these since 92'
I'm feelin like a bad boy without the shiny suit
Here the cops come, shit, so I dash behind a honda
And look who's here my baby momma's friend Rhonda
In the car kissin on this dope dealer, Chris
Little did he know he was suckin my dick
I start bangin' on the window, I don't mean to disturb
But Chris can you drop me off downtown, on third
He said why sure, waddup game hop in
He was bangin slick rick then I got an idea
Before we get to third drop me off right here
So I can walk inside the mall and cop some new gear
As I walked in the store they could see I was in a rush
So they bought me some jeans, a t-shirt and fresh chucks
Walked out the store, looked left, oh no
Ran back in the store, here comes the 5-0
So I ran real quick, made a move to the back
And knocked a cute bitch into a polo rack
Said sorry, jumped over her and fled to the back door
Then I kicked the shit open, you won't believe who I saw
Its the nigga chris in handcuffs, pointin at me
And the cops made him chase me before they let Chris free
One cop tried to grab me, and the other one missed
I got away with more time, and they both got pissed
Ran straight out the mall, spotted this blue coupe
'dogg pound' on the plates, that's gotta be Snoop
So I ran up the car and said yo snoop
The cops got me on the run need a ride nephew
Hell yeah bigg snoop, little homie hop in
He dropped me off in compton, that's when my story ends
Now this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Just another story about the wrong path
I had a big day, so I reclined my seat
It was a 20 minute ride to the C.P.T
Walked straight up to the house, pulled out my key
Opened my door it's my girl playin..."

If I Get Locked Up,Funkmaster Flex & Big Kap,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Check check, one two, one two, one two (Yo, it’s rollin'?)
Yeah yeah yeah, Dr. Dre up in here, y'all know what this is
It’s what you've been waitin' for, Funkmaster Flex
Big Kap, Def Jam records givin' it to you, baby
Yo, Eminem, show these motherfuckers what time it is, baby

[Verse 1: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
I used to be a lonely man, only mad
'Til I got a million dollars, shit, now if I only had
Some fuckin' hair I'd pull it faster than a bullet
Out of 2Pac's chest before the ambulance came too late to do it
I'm tryin' to grow it back again, it was an accident
I had my back against the fan and chopped it off in Amsterdam
I hate this straightjacket, it ain't latchin', they can't lock it
So they stapled my hands to my pants pockets
The cell's padded and battered like someone else had it
Before me and just kept throwin' their fuckin' self at it
My head is achin', I'm dedicated to medication
But this med is takin' too long to bring me this se-da-dation (Come on!)
Anyway, I got down with Dre (What up?)
The first man who taught me how a Glock sounded to spray
Runnin' up and down the street, screamin', ""Fuck the police!""
When you still had your mother's fuckin' nipple stuck in your teeth (You fuckin' baby)
Became a role model after Colorado
Now all they do is follow me around and holler, ""Bravo!""
Hell yeah, I punch my bitch
And beat my kids in public – suck my dick, bitch!
I'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face
But I won't, 'cause you probably wanna stand in his place
So put a sock in it, wit' your fake-ass 2Pac image
You faggots ain't tough, you just get drunk and become talkative (Wanna pf-fight?)
I'm probably the awkwardest alcoholic talkin'
Walkin' like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket
So when you see me on your block stumblin'
Mumblin' a bunch of dumb shit like my drunk uncle does
I ain't buzzed, I'm just high on life
So why on Earth would I need drugs when I fly on kites?
Motherfucker! Slim Shady (Dr. Dre)
I'm drunk, pass the TEC
[Chorus: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
'Cause if I get locked up tonight
Then I might not come home tonight
Keep it movin', off and on, Eminem is on (Hey)
Off and on, Dr. Dre is on
'Cause if I get locked up tonight
Then I might not come home tonight
Keep it movin', off and on, Eminem is on (Hey)
Off and on, Dr. Dre is on

[Verse 2: Eminem]
The whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire
I set a fuckin' girl on fire with a curling iron
Psych! I'm just jokin', for Christ's sakes
Don't get so bent out of shape 'cause I went out and raped six girlfriends
Some people just don't get it
But I won't let it upset me, 'cause they don't know better
They don't know what the fuck it's like to be so fed up
And fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up
My mind's got a mind of its own
Sometimes I can't find it at home, it hides in the stove (Hello, where you at?)
Shit, talk about your brain bein' baked
My shit's still in the oven on 480 degrés
Hailie Jade, Daddy loves you, baby
Don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter – fuck you, lady!
You critics wanna criticize but couldn't visualize
Individuals lives through a criminal's eyes (Fuck y'all)
The neighborhood that I grew up in, you could die for nothin'
And Dirty Dozen watches over me so try some dumb shit
I'll have a fuckin' man raped with a Band-Aid
Over his mouth and shove his head in a fan blade
Don't ever tell me what I can or what I can't say
Or change 'cause of the age range in my fan base
Like I give a fuck who's buyin' this shit
Quit fuckin' buyin' it, I'm tired, bitch, I'm dyin' to quit
Hip-hop is universal now, it's so commercial now
It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now
But now the white kids like it, so they tell me I can buy it
But as soon as I get on the mic it's like the night gets silent
Either that or booed, that's why I keep an attitude
And go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon
I'm sick of bein' judged, fuck it, let me see a judge
I'll confess to every murder I committed since three years old
[Chorus: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
'Cause if I get locked up tonight
Then I might not come home tonight
Keep it movin', off and on, Eminem is on (Hey)
Off and on, Dr. Dre is on (Ayo)

The Old Prince Still Lives At Home,Shad,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
(The old prince still lived at home.)

[Verse 1]
I live at home still, not paying phone bills
Hydro, or rent, and my mom makes most meals
So it's so ill, I don't need no scrill
Only cash for gas when I borrow my folks' wheels
(But you can't drive) whatever, our van died
(Get a good bike) who I look like, that Lance guy?
I ain't pushing no banana seat
Looking like some 8-year-old kid on your grandma's street
You can go ahead and call me lazy
I just retired real young, y'all, call me Jay-Z
Or maybe I just hate these crappy jobs, call me crazy
But I refuse to work 'em, man, it's miserable
Can't do it 'less it's due to circumstance
And I need the cash to feed my astronomical appetite
But for the time being, y'all, I'll sacrifice
And have a life minus a couple of luxuries
Just cutting my budget schemes and getting some stuff for free
Like, why's a brother need a dentist? It's expensive
And my gums'll bleed, they do everytime when he scrubs 'em clean
And every year they try to bump the fee
Plus he'll probably recommend braces (there you go) that's another G!
Well thanks a lot, doc, but listen, I can brush my teeth
All on my own, so you ain't gonna hustle me
So that takes care of the dental plan, now here's a potential scam
Getting my toes crushed by a rental van
Then if I sued the driver and the rental guy's
Enterprise or whatever, I bet they would settle nice
Court adjourned, now I just gotta pay for the law forms
(That's easy) spend two weeks eating popcorn
Like students do, 'cept I'm grown and it's not dorms
So it's a bit more pathetic, ok, a lot more
But what y'all gotta mock for? What's wrong with my Mach 3?
Y'all gotta be macho and mock more?
Well not me, and I do not need to change blades
Its all my own hair I shave, chin back face legs
And the rashes rarely last more than 8 days
Usually, so it's cool with me, I can save great
(But hygiene!) That ain't no reason to buy things
Like soap or visine or getting clothes dry cleaned
I don't throw away dough on no facials
Yeah I make rolls of my pennies, I even pay folks
In clubs out this case full of pesos I lug
(Bro, get 'em exchanged) Nope, I'm waiting till the rate's low
Don't hate yo, just cuause y'all wasteful
Y'all wanna make your bruh the scapegoat, it's bugged
It's all nuance, use your head
Why get a bed and couch when you can slouch on a futon instead
If you got a little bread like croutons
Download them new songs and spread them coupons
[Interlude]
(Shad, what happened?)
I, uh, I couldn't afford the whole beat
(Wow.)
So, uh, I know
(You couldn't afford...)
Yeah, no, the guy was just charging so much it was totally not worth it. So I was just like, lets like, um, kinda just vibe with it
(What?)
Like I'll just like spit the verse and then you just start clapping the last verse
(Clap my hands?)
Yeah, just clap your hands from there, whatever. I'll just, I'll start it, I'll start it, it's like...

[Verse 2]
If you happy when you save 2 dollars a week
You steal your neighbors empty bottles and keep all your receipts
And only treat your girl yearly to McDonalds to eat
Don't be ashamed, pop your collars man, holler at me (holla!)
If y'all are this cheap, cause this is for acknowledging peeps
That gotta track every dime using columns and sheets
If you strip search the mall for the bargain to beat
Like every day you've just a penny saved from starving on the street
Keep carving a niche, I'm started in a jar for the wee
Little Shaddies still to come for their college degree
Yo I figure starting early on the market is key
I plan on having smart daughters all Harvard M.D
And regardless, we gon' never put a car on the streets
'Less them gas prices lower and the parking is free
And no parka for me, not even gloves, scarves or a fleece
I may freeze but I'll keep saving marvellously, holla!"

Man this fuckin' bitch
Took off, fuckin' with some college graduate
Punk-ass, Abercrombie wearin' motherfucker
Left me broken-hearted in the Chevy
It's all good though, know why
I got me bitch

[Verse 1]
Both of us was in the same class
In '02 in Antioch, Nash-Ville
And I wanted you so bad
That I forgot to mind my manners
Everybody wanted them panties
Every guy was hopin' to land it
We would flirt around and touch hands
Until we fucked around and took Xanax
And that's when you began to drive me bananas
I was in denial it's apparent
You began to lie to your parents
You should know that I can't live
Without you holdin' my name
Now my heart's in control of my brain
And I can't hold it in the lanes

Don't you believe in us?
Don't you believe in us?
She said I know you gave me everything
But love is not enough
Love is not enough
Love is not enough

[Verse 2]
Used to fuck so much, we missed school
You was there when I needed you
I was there when you needed me
We were un-separable
When I was broke, with no fuckin' food
You was tough enough to be cool
Skate holes all in my shoes
Dope-boys had me confused
I was in love with hip-hop
You was in love with that too
What made it come to a stop?
Had to have been the money issue, bitch
And I really miss the rain
I gave you all of my soul
And all I got left is a key-chain

Rollin' down 20, man

Don't you believe in us?
Don't you believe in us?
She said I know you gave me everything
But love is not enough
Love is not enough
Love is not enough

[Verse 3]
Who the fuck are you fuckin' now, bet he's always takin' you out
College-educated and proud
Me, well I'm just a drop-out
Can't really blame you for buggin'
Ain't I the dirt on your rug
And just the place to wipe your shoes
And give me all your thrown away lovin'
Back to my buzzin' and druggin'
Back to my gutter with nothin'
Back to the ""What, all the sudden?""
Cracks in the covenant, trust in me
You ain't gotta worry bout sharing this success with Wayne
Now it's just petty change but I still feel the pain

Rollin' down 20, man
With this Jack in my cup
Feelin' down on my luck
And I'm doin 120, man

Welcome to my whirlwind, turn like Tilt-A-Whirls
I be throwing up my set, yes, hurlin' up the world and
Going out, we goin in', say ""hello"" to my girlfriend
Vomiting and conquering, that C-Class is a ""girl Benz""
My class is overseas, I be on ""all around the world"" rims
Women's international, my will is like my girl then
Goin' in is goin' wild, goin' in is goin' strong
Going for the gold, some world-class goin' in is goin' on
I can do this all day, I ain't got it all, 'kay
They all say I'm one wall short of a whole hallway
One Halls short to keep from coughing all in y'all face
Man, I'm so appalled, I can keep them all safe
I can really ball and put titties all in y'all face
That was Robert Paulson, and that deserves a pausin'
So that's Blart, Pierce, and all that's missing is a bearer
For the coffin that is needed for this beat when I'm done talkin'
Balling in the morning, this feel like my callin'
This the new bitches brew, fall off in my cauldron
Lupe's going crazy! Flow is going almonds
We going back to goin' in, you gonna need a Garmin
Then go and get a car to put your Garmin and my broad in
Destination everywhere, reputation everywhere
Music drop, music stop, one man take up every chair
I know that that ain't very fair how one man take up everywhere
But it ain't for long though, it'll be some closure
Or maybe I'll be everywhere after I'm all over
Say goodbye then start the show, fall on off then start to blow
Acting like I'm rapping, it's that Joaquin Phoenix Facebook flow
Flow is in the microwave, call it Michael Tyson flow
Killing is a dirty job: Michael Myers, Michael Rowe
Bring it back like Michael Fox, see how far them Michaels go
I feel like I'm Michael Crichton writin' with a microphone
I ain't saying you should die but you should leave your life alone
Maybe borrow one of mine, fast life, life at home
Life is like a box of chocolates, pockets full of Toblerones
Pocket full of wallets so what continent we shopping on?

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Excuse me, Lupe, ""Huh?"" This here is your conscience
Supplier of your fire and provider of your content
They really don't want none of you, let's put them in a convent
You are such a handful, you can call us palm prints
They can't get a handle, try to run around my track
And you might get a ham pulled, swag I got a van-full
Plus a motorcycle and a tow truck my sedan pull
I am like a Superman, just without the damn ""Youuuu!""
Flow is tied around the track, something like a damsel
Flow is really manly, though, see, that was an example
Remember that for later, though, because I might exam you
Get ready for your tests-s-s, his excellence commands you
See, that's how I get it done: effortless and ample
Means I got a lot of that, no camel toe or Monistat
No pussy in my program...
Worldwide, let 'em recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Put in my work and punch the clock like Riddick Bowe's hands
See, my pot is overflowing, can I put some work in your pan?
Yeah, yeah, I am such a dope man
Kitchen's really happy, you should come and see my stove dance
Movie of the week, I call it Beauty and the Beast
And that there's just the kitchen, you should see just where I sleep
Crib is on some other shit, mind is on the mothership
Brain is on my sister boat, thoughts is in my brother whip
Fitted hat is Reynolds Wrap cause I don't trust the government
See, I'm not just touching it, I'm clutching it with oven mitts
Shit get hot, this wristwatch, looks like its a club in it
Like the way I emcee, man, they just be lovin' it
Used to be a pushover, now I'm into shovin' shit
You be on your glory hole, you don't know who you fuckin' with
Stay off in that story mode, I never like a quick game
Came in with a big blast, go out with a big bang
You might catch some whiplash every time I switch lanes
See, I drive a bit fast, nigga kinda insane
Career on stilts, Braveheart: no kilt
You can hear it screaming ""freedom"" as the beat get killed
[Hook: Lil Ronnie]
I'm killin', I'm killin', I'm killin' this beat
I'm killin', I'm killin', I'm killin' this beat
I'm killin', I'm killin', I'm killin' this beat
I'm killin', I'm killin', I'm killin' this beat (Uh-huh)
Don't you hear it screamin'?

Bow down, I draw down

OK, monkey nigga, bet not slip, feed your ass banana clips
Yeah, I bust your head gasket, leave you with a oil drip
And for the lettuce AK's, that will spit your cabbage
And shit get tragically, leave cadavers filled with maggots
This ain't angus beef, you don't wanna order this
2 Glocks like 2Pac, I’m on my thug immortal shit
GPS goons show up to your coordinates
Chrome with the pearly, take you early, that's abortion bitch
Duck, duck, tape ya, wrap ya nigga, no balls
Throw slugs the same size as door knobs
Sixty seconds in and out pop, no prob
Blow ya whole face off, that's a blowjob
Shoot ya bitch in the throat leave her voice raspy
Too graphic?, I paint a picture so ya'll niggas grasp it
I call your momma, tell her pre-order ya fuckin' casket
Bury scary niggas, I never buried a hatchet
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Soo woo to the bee-hive, strapped like T.I
I keep that bitch on me, like the Book of Eli
I just shoot ‘em all, so I don’t have to decide
Split your body up, they gotta bury ya ass 3 times
Run up in ya house, leave ya brains on the couch
Shoot up everything, fuck is aimin' about?
Empty that clip, than that bitch slide out
Continue that procedure till them pussy’s dried out
I'm a east side gangsta, I ain't never been a busta
Nina is a cold black bitch, but I trust her
I don't need a psychic to tell me I’m a hustla
Cause bitch, I’m all about my paper, like Usher

I know Chris, decepticon clips transform ya
Leave niggas, ghost activity, paranormal
My piece of the pie, ha ha ha, Digorno
Bullets burn, make em dance, disco inferno

[Lil Wayne]
Back to the subject, i’ll kill ya in a heart beat
I put bullet holes in everything except the car seat
Young money bitch, I shoot one gun and switch
When the cops came the body still twitched (still twitched)
[Yung Joc]
Keep thuggin, you cute, you just flirtin' with death
That's a straight suicide, don’t bury yourself
Scared but can’t run, that's the stall factor
And if that automatic rap I bet they all scatter
Haiti earthquake ‘em, make they wall shatter
Penetrate your lungs and splatter they gallbladders

Better Late Than Never,Outasight,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Outasight]
Open my eyes, hung over around somewhere quarter to four
The only reason I did ‘cause I heard you knocking at my door
And oh, I would like you to know that
Not every moment so picture perfect or Kodak
Trying to be the new me, get rid of the throwback
You probably heard this before
Get ready for the night, think it was ‘round quarter to ten
The only reason I’m going out ‘cause I heard you was back again
And oh, I would like you to realize
I feel the same pressure and I know what it feel like
When people ask me when I’m joining the real life
And I don’t know what to say to them

[Hook]
We all make mistakes, I’m trying to catch a break
Putting the past away
It’s better late than never to get together
Whether or not I want to

[Verse 2: Outasight]
Everything seemed alright tonight when I first hit the strip
But things start to change right away upon the first sip
Your return bittersweet, misery loves company
And it loves me, no romance or hold hands
I’m no fan of the same damn drama
Please change the program and say what you wanna
I tried to play the background but I’m a front runner
Comma, something stopped me in the middle of my sentence
Dropped all my worries, never picked ‘em up
Till now, my glass half empty but it filled out
But one shot of you and it spills out
What’s the problem? I’m trying to figure it out, it’s out my hands now
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Outasight]
Everyone says I’ve been doing it wrong
Should follow the crowd and move it along
Take another drag and flick it away
Worry about tomorrow, I’m here today
I’m here today, I’ve made mistakes and I’m running late
I’ve made mistakes and I’m here today and I’m running late

Downtown In My Mind,Outasight,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Outasight]
It started at the moment I thought it would
I stepped off the platform into a yellow car
I could not retrieve the road
Windows cracked, my eyes were closed
How will I find my way out?
It ended when I lost my quest forever more
Inclined to roles, response and goals I never saw
There I was, alone again, not giving up but giving in
Now tell me where to go

[Hook]
Downtown in my mind
I’m looking for things I could never find

[Verse 2: Outasight]
I picked the pieces up and started to question
Why it must be selling out or buying in
Everywhere I look or turn, everyone is so concerned
Yet they have no reply
I’m walking slowly down this block, I swear I saw
The whole world ‘round me moving in fast forward
All my movements slowing down
Constant rushing always ‘round, I have nowhere to run
[Hook 2X]

[Verse 3: Outasight]
Let me state my name, Richard Andrew, no one the same
Whether doughboy philosopher, no codes, locking ‘em
Dope shows, rocking ‘em, choice hoes, on top of ‘em
Close foes, mocking ‘em, none in the vicinity
Sipping merlot in Little Italy memories
Brush through my mind, paint against canvas
Campus to mansions, Burberry J ransom
Sinatra’s my life, playing in the back
Like I’m sitting in my grandpa’s Cadillac
Those who can’t see the vision, cataracts
Average stacks, laugh at that
Tailored stacks, roll through my habitat
The constant search for answers seems like they got it
The path to knowledge of self may be chaotic
But I’m on it, won’t shut it down like onyx
Hit the Mark Ecko sentiments of the life complex in the dark

The Name Game,The Coup,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Boots Riley]
Now, motherfuckers done made a name for theyself
But a name don't mean wealth, let me up you on this shit
If we was up in this just to get up out the ghetto
Let me tell you right now, we damn near done quit

[Verse 1: Boots Riley]
I spit game on a regular basis; now everybody
Looking at my hand like I'm holding all the aces
Cool that they know our faces, from different places
But you can't catch up if you don't know what the pace is
Everywhere we go you know especially in the O we hear
""Coup, Coup, you know we got love fo' sho'""
But even mo' when they see us on B-E-and-T and
M-T-and-V but me and E can't pay the P-G-and-E
Power come from the barrel of a bucker
I use the mic so that we aim at the same motherfucker
Cause your shit could go gold, and the only cash you got
Is the silver kind that don't fold
I'm gettin dope when they ask about the road that I passed
My peoples really be thinking they gon' come up fast
And then come rap and shake they ass
You ain't the first motherfucker who done scheme to scam
Then plan to scram up out the ghetto let me break this down
From kids to Grams, fuck the videos with the Benzes
And the cellular phones, spending hundreds like quarters
The Benz is they partner's, the money's on loan, and umm...
""The cellular number you have reached is out of order.""

I mocked Rock Box wearin socks in my basement, told my pops
I'm fitt'n to have as much mail as they got -- not
I still plot to keep my cash clot flowin'
My mind is bent on the rent, I'm barely makin it microphonin'
It's true, it's a few getting fund expansions
It ain't like Acorn Projects gon' move into mansions
Straight authenticized shit, over synthesized hits
With this misty eyed 'mental make your teeth grit
And I'm not tryin to diss like it's a bandwagon trend
They selling six-packs of them wavies out the ghetto again
In the 20's it was rocks, in the 50's doo-wop
It's nineteen-ninety-fo' and everybody's store hop'n
And ain't nobody really trying to hear me speak it
They too busy watchin luke, gettin interviewed by Robin Leach
So if you're modest and don't hire economics
Just kick it with The Coup, smoke this dub sack of funk!

It's like frontin' you gon' shoot when you ain't got no Glock
You bet' not (that's a punk trick) this is how we run shit
I'm fitt'n to pitch a fit cause I'm tired of hearing dumb shit
Why do motherfuckers get up out and go for single
When the real high rollers draft a army to protect they Pringles?

[Verse 3: E-Roc]
Confusion, just a system based on prostitution
They done ganked you, don't be no stank fool with they solution
Unless you got about a million semi-automatics
You gon' think you strivin doin them ho-style acrobatics

[Boots]
No I don't have it like that, Planned Parenthood ain't got it
I keep my whole life savings stuffed in my back pocket, flock it
I'm scraping fronts off like plaque, no slack
I come realistic like Radio Shack
Intact and fat motherfuckers finally get they shit right
Ain't no fight, they scared shitless, all they do is grab the mic
Ain't no organizing real shit on the street, it's a fleet
Of revolutionaries in the studio making beats
So fuck the fame, fuck the game, fuck the riches foo'
I ain't got shit unless all my folks gon' have theirs too

I tried to play but my heart in the way
This part a little harder to say, it's like a white girl trapped in a well
Help is coming but it's scary as hell but very well
Here went the fairy tale
Now Cinderella want a fella who is not so ghetto
So she follow breadcrumbs like Hansel and Gretel
Hello, that'll make her drop her underwear
Dough longer than Rapunzel hair
Everyone stare when she walk in, she like (""What you want?"")
Yo, I'm not gonna front, I'll be blunt
I'll make that ass bump, I know that's (What they want)
Me too with my hands up
She turned around like man up, I'm like (""Here I am"")

Got me singing like Prince, you sexy motherfuck
You could be my princess bride, call you my buttercup
I love when you letting me be the man
Let me take you by the hand like Wendy in Peter Pan
If you fly by night, that's right, I'll let you make a wish
Eat you up like a favorite dish
Man I pray you not the Wicked Witch (Made it through)
A situation where I broke my promise
But now, I'm trying to be honest love (So can you)

I even need to quit smokin my weed
Or make surely she got a GED
[Hook: Kid Cudi and 88keys]
(Only met about a week ago, but a little bit busy on the telephone)
She's so fine, see we talk all the time
But sometimes I think she's missin her mind
(We only met about a week ago, but a little bit busy on the telephone)
She's a dime, and she's faithfully mine
But something wrong with her head cause she ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
(We only met about a week ago, but a little bit busy on the telephone)
She's so fine, see we talk all the time

[Outro: Kid Cudi]
You know I called her
And I was just like, damn like she sounded so dumb as hell
Like she ain't got no fuckin brain, you know what I mean?
And I'm just like, your wasting my minutes and shit!"
Still Talkin,Eazy-E,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro/Prelude]
Good evening, and welcome to Eazy's playhouse
You stupid muthafucka!
Now that you got the album
What the fuck are you gonna do with it, bitch?

[Ice Cube + Dr. Dre + Eazy-E]
I knew this nigga back in, uh, uh—back since a nigga was little
(You lying, you lying man)
The nigga come from Compton, Michigan, nigga
(Compton what? You ain't never met no Eazy-E)
Well, I'ma introduce him (You a damn liar!)
This is the craziest motherfucka you done seen (You a damn liar!)
This nigga's crazy—just listen!

[Verse 1]
Easily I approach
The microphone because I ain't no joke
Tell your momma to get off of my tip
I have no time to give her my dick
I'm gonna hold it, and walk around the stage and
If you fuck up I'm goin' to get my gauge and
Unload the barrel and laugh
'Cause I'm puttin' lead in your mothafuckin' ass
Psychopathic, but the hoes are attracted
Because when I'm on hard, my dick's at least a yard
In the days of old, I was a nut
Now I'll need at least 3 hoes when I fuck
'Cause I do a check—nut 1, nut 2
Then I save a nut for when there's nothin' else to do
Get used to the crew, bitch, 'cause I would never quit
As soon as you think that's it, I'm still talkin' shit
[Interlude: Ice Cube + Dr. Dre]
Ha ha, I told you that nigga was crazy
Eazy Eric, that's my boy, ha ha, godamnit
Go on, boy, wit' yo' bad self
Step up to the mic, nigga (Ay bitch, pass me my Ripple)

[Verse 2]
I got a fable that you need to listen to
It's a funky little rhyme about a bitch or a two
One's Sharon, the other one Shaun
I wanted to nut, but which one do I want?
Shaun said, ""Eazy, let me fuck you blind""
And Sharon said, ""E, I want to blow your mind""
I said fuck it, I know what should be done
Just pull your panties down and I'll fuck the biggest one
And then I get the other pussy, put it in the freezer
So I can always have a on-hold skeezer
Yeah, that's the ticket, I'll do it like that
So I told the hoes to take a big step back
Took the zipper down, eyes wide, and said
""Here's what I'm gonna put inside""
Grab it like a rabbit (grab it), let's work it (work it)
But I won't love you—when I'm done, I'll still be talkin' shit ...

[Interlude: Ice Cube + Dr. Dre + Eazy-E]
Ha ha, that boy good (Yeah, that boy's good)
(That muthafucka be talkin' all kinds of shit)
I used to get pussy like Eazy Eric every day
(You ain't no motherfucker) How you know, muthafucka?
(You're lyin', your dick can't get hard)
Oh, suck my dick, muthafucka (Nigga, you lyin')
Who you talkin' to? Well, get up then, nigga, shit...
[Interlude: Dr. Dre]
Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit
Ayo Yella boy, why don't you rewind it

[Verse 3: Eazy-E ]
Niggas don't see I'm a 100 percent legit
And you know it ain't about all that bullshit
It's about fuckin' this bitch and that bitch
But not the bitch with the 7 day itch, like that ho
Just throwin' me the pussy
She says she wants to do it like a doggy
She's bad, nobody is badder
But she got more crabs than a seafood platter
Bitch on the gank move, to skeaze me
Just to say ""I got fucked by Eazy""
So I slapped the ho like a pimp
I might be a woman-beater but I'm not a pussy-eater
So when the shit hits the fan, it's outta my mouth
You don't like what I'm talkin' about?
All of y'all can just suck my dick
You could quote me now 'cause I'm still talkin' shit

[Interlude: Ice Cube + Dr. Dre]
The boy's good—I told you, boy
(Ay, I knew him when he was knee-high)
The nigga got talent—you don't know a damn thing
(I knew him when he was knee-high)
He still is knee-high, muthafucka
(Yeah, I like that part—bring that shit back one more time, Maestro)
That's that old Z.Z. Hill, huh? Ha ha ha
I tell ya, boy, I can do the Mashed Potato, nigga, what can you do?
(Muthafucka, I can do the boogaloo, I can do the boogaloo)
Boogaloo?! That old shit been played out back in 1967

MC Ren: Yo Dre, how much time we got left on ths tape?
Dr. Dre: About a couple of minutes
MC Ren: Well let me bust a freestyle then
Dr. Dre: Awright, go ahead

[MC Ren]
Ruthless gangsta, definition villain
Leave your shit unlocked and he's stealin'
So call tha police cause that's all you could do but
He'll get away without leavin' a clue

Dr. Dre: Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit
Eh yo Yella boy why don't you rewind it
Hey, man you gotta get more hyped up than that
MC Ren: Damn, why don't you pump this shit up so it could fuck up my eardrums a little bit!
Dr. Dre: Allright bet

[Verse 1: MC Ren]
Ruthless gangsta, definition villain
Leave your shit unlocked and it's stealin'
So call tha police 'cause that's all you could do but
He'll get away without leavin' a clue
Keepin' shit in control like the neighborhood chief but
Referred to as a walking thief
They say he's a bad influence for the kids on the block
Why the fuck they blamin' him? He's the one that they jock
Keepin' niggas in line, whoever fucks with his rhyme
And before you fuck with him you gotta fuck with his nine
Not scared to pull the trigger on a punk ass nigga
He could whoop his ass 'cause he's bigger
Size don't mean shit he's from the old school fool
He's a villain from the streets and he's supposed to rule
Not sayin' he's in shit but he's down for mine
He was put on the streets to keep niggas in line
Never givin' a fuck, [?] jealous of E
Because I know that he's a nigga that you want to be
He can't help it he's in shit but he don't hold shit back
He's a gangsta in black and he's about to attack
[Hook: Eazy-E]
'Cause I'm a ruthless villain, cold tearin' shit up
Don't come on my face, pumpin' no kind of junk
Eazy-E's in control and if you press your luck
I'll smoke you like that and won't give a fuck

[Sample]
""Nickname Eazy-E...Ol' 8-Ball junkie!""

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Ruthless gangsta, definition villain
You can lock up yo' shit, he's still stealin'
Gettin' respect 'cause the boy kicks butt
But the real meaning is he don't give a fuck
It's Eazy-E in the crowd but he's not in the 4
I tell his money flow as he collects from his ho'
All expenses paid for the rhymes that he made
Gold trophies in the house for the girls that he laid
Not a wimp he's a pimp, now of course he's the boss
So keep your bitch out his face or else she's gonna get tossed
Too hard to be fucked with, the boy got heart
Wanna fuck with him, he'll rip your head apart
Gangsta Gangsta, that's what they yellin'
But him with his gangsta stroll he keeps bailin'
Wherever he goes there's no discussion but silence
They say that he's the one promotin' gang violence
That's a lie just a critic all that whack bullshit
So let me tell you motherfuckers who you fuckin' with
[Hook: Eazy-E]
'Cause I'm a ruthless villain, cold tearin' shit up
Don't come on my face, pumpin' no kind of junk

Yo we're two hard motherfuckers
Taking out any punk ass suckers
Can you believe this? if so be frightened
We're strong as fuck, with the power of a titan
Setting a mark of destruction, get it
So don't front, and say you ain't with it
You wanna rumble with us you can't hang
Because we're something like a two man gang
Starting some shit is what we do best
Just care about ourself and say fuck the rest
So yo Eazy (wassup), bust it and shoot to kill
And tell these stupid motherfuckers the deal
[Verse 2: Eazy-E]
I look you dead in the eye then I spit (yeah)
I tell you to your face punk you ain't shit (you ain't shit)
I don't give a god damn about feelings
I'm just happy just as long as I'm killing
A 187's in progress, nigga
Just as soon as I pull this trigger
Automatic heavily, I start firing
And the kids on the block, I'm the one they're admiring
A bad mouth nigga on the violent tip
I catch you talking some shit and I'ma bust your lip
Now who you gonna tell that I'm making you soft?
The police ain't shit 'cause I'm paying 'em off
I move slow, always ready to go so fuck it (so fuck it)
And bitches on my dick, they know that they can suck it
I'm a hardhead, always having a fit
When I'm not allowed to tear up shit
I'm a hard motherfucker (I'm hard motherfucker)

Now look at me I'm a crazed bitch
With a gangster profanity pitch
Ren is a nigga that don't give a fuck
To a pussy ass fool trying to press his luck
I'm ready to scrap that's if you're ready to go
I'll take you out going toe to toe
E will start a conversion and hit you from the back
While you getting fucked up by a ruthless jack
Critical condition is what you receive
Thinking of some back up to go and retrieve
But Eazy tell what would happen my man
They would get fucked up by a ruthless clan
So it's simple, we don't give a fuck, right?
So you and your boy can get the fuck out my sight
I'm on tilt with class getting ready to blast
Cause I'm a hard motherfucker

Eazy and Ren is fucking it up again
Scheming up a plot before we begin
Because niggas like to stare like a bitch sometimes
They say how could them niggas have some hell of a rhymes
It's simple tell 'em what we mean
When the two baddest motherfuckers step on the scene
Now this is some shit - Yo what are you saying
You stupid motherfuckers, they think I'm playing
Talking all kind of shit but I'm cracking it up
I can afford to laugh 'cause I'm backing it up
I'm not a buster I'm more like a hitman
So if you don't wanna throw then you can get down
You don't like the fuck away from me
So you can stop the shit, trying to fuck the E

[Verse 5: MC Ren & Eazy-E]
You heard what he said and it's the truth so whats up
So if you want me to go well I'm about to nut up
The two baddest motherfuckers alive
So I don't think that you and your boys can survive
You got a girl, well if she's good to go
I bet me and E already fucked the ho

""Chad Butler, known as Pimp C, died in a Los Angeles hotel room...""
""The L.A. County Coroner's office ruled the rapper's death accidental and attributed it to a combination of...""
""Apnea?""
""Yes""
""And syrup, and we know that syrup on the streets usually has codeine?""
""Absolutely, we have a problem now with the cough syrup epidemic...""

[Verse 1]
He rolled up, asked him what he was sippin' on
He said, ""Lean, you wanna hit it, dawg?""
That's the same stuff Weezy's sippin', huh?
And tons of other rappers that be spittin' hard
Yup, he had five up on
Then went and passed him that Styrofoam
The Easter Pink, heard a rhyme before
Finally got to see what all the hype was on
And then he took a sip, sittin' in the Lincoln
Thinking he was pimpin' as he listened to the system
Little did he know that it was just as addictive as base
Not the kind of hit from the kick drum
Hotbox, let the bass bump
Take it to the face, gulp
Months later the use went up
Every blunt was accompanied by the pink stuff
But goddamn, he loved that feeling
Purple rain coated in the throat, just so healin'
Medicine alleviate the sickness
Liquid affix and it comes with a cost
Wake up, cold sweat, scratchin', itchin'
Tryna escape the skin that barely fit him
Gone, get another bottle just to get a couple swallows
Headed towards the bottom couldn't get off it
Didn't even think he had a problem
Though he couldn't sleep without gettin' nauseous
Room spinnin'
Thinkin' he might have sipped just a little bit too much of that cough syrup
His eyelids closed, shut
Sat back in the chair clutchin' that cup
Girlfriend came and a couple hours later
Said his name, shook him but he never got up
He never got up, he never got up
We live on the cusp of death thinkin' that it won't be us
It won't be us, it won't be us, it won't be us
Nah, it won't be us
[Verse 2]
Now he just wanted to act like them
He just wanted to rap like him
Us as rappers underestimate the power and the effects that we have on these kids
Blunt passed, ash in a tin
Pack being pushed, harassed by the feds
The fact of it is most people that rap like this
Talkin' about some shit they haven't lived
Surprise, you know the drill
Trapped in a box, declinin' record sales
Follow the formula: violence, drugs, and sex sells
So we try to sound like someone else
This is not Californication
There's no way to glorify this pavement
Syrup, Percocet, and an eighth a day
Will leave you broke, depressed, and emotionally vacant
Despite how Little Wayne lives
It's not conducive to being creative
And I know 'cause he's my favorite
And I know 'cause I was off that same mix
Rationalize the shit that I'd try after I listen to Dedication
But he's an alien
I'd sip that shit, pass out or play PlayStation
Months later I'm in the same place
No music made, feelin' like a failure
And trust me, it's not dope to be twenty-five
And move back to your parents' basement
I've seen my people's dreams die
I've seen what they can be denied
And ""weed's not a drug,"" that's denial
Groundhog Day, life, repeat each time
I've seen Oxycontin take three lives
I grew up with them, we used to chief dimes
I've seen cocaine bring out the demons inside
Cheatin' and lyin'
Friendship cease, no peace in the mind
Stealin' and takin' anything to fix the pieces inside
Broken, hopeless, headed nowhere
Only motivation for what the dealer's supplyin'
That rush, that drug, that dope
Those pills, that crumb, that roach
Thinkin' I would never do that, not that drug
Growing up nobody ever does
Until you're stuck
Lookin' in the mirror like I can't believe what I become
Swore I was gonna be someone
And growin' up everyone always does
We sell our dreams and our potential
To escape through that buzz
Just keep me up, keep me up
Hollywood, here we come
[Outro]
""You can tend to, um, go a little too far with some of these things, they have very strong addictive qualities, pills and syrups and whatnot, so um…""
""Is it changing the music?""
""Um, I can only speak for myself personally, you know what I'm saying?
Um, we had been taking down, toning down the content of certain things in the music lately
My new album, of course, probably won't have any references to cough syrup in it
But, uh, it's a little bit more than the music
I think it's gonna start affecting the personal lives of a lot of artists and people..."""

I be under the waves like my name was Sub-Mariner
Speakin' truths so profound I break the language barrier
Animals listen to me, cause I am a zen master
I move faster than your average plastered dad
If my verse is a pokemon you need a master ball to capture
The rhymes of the DJ Snack attacker
Move left move right or just stay in your seat
Just try to make peace, hear the words I speak
Breathe in, breathe out, chill out, don't drown
Breathin' underwater's easy enough if you know how
Remove your urge to die, only life can remain
As you feel blood rushin' from your heart to your veins
When you desire life instead of death then you become free
When you remove both of those desires, you got me

And he shut out the rest of the world
And all of the boys and all the girls wondered what he thought to himself in his private little world
Couldn't discern the good from bad
Couldn't get along with mom and dad
And his grades they were bad
And his thoughts were pretty bleak but when he took the time to speak his words were pretty deep
And all he needs now is an audience to which he can preach
And become a canoe, he's floatin' up thought creek
With both paddles
(verse 2-Rolling River)
Flowers don't die, they go to Mars
Fruit flies have a lifetime of seven bars
Vegetables with a total of seven tastes
Stay away, for your own good
I'm growing things from cormorants to phone books
In my Japanese garden with one flowing brook
On my Cantonese game show, not one farthing is took
By the fat sweaty men who cook the books
Though they shot me many shifty looks
They left, and left the books crooked
That's why I'm here now, dead broke and nothing's cookin'
Fuck with them and you'll be shot dead lookin'
But look at me all you like, I'm past caring
Stuck in a coal mine with a singing canary"

Gotta Have Love,The Last Emperor,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
What’s up y’all? Let’s rap for a second
About a special thing that this world is neglecting
Now, I was under the impression that love was refreshing
So chill, I’ma still break it down for the session
It’s been around since the day this world was born
And since then it has taken many shapes and forms
Like the kinship ties of love between brothers
To the passionate type, shared amongst lovers
Once love is released it can bring inner-peace
The same way I love rocking over these ill beats
It’s a treat sweeter than your favorite dessert
But even at the same time I know love hurts
If your love stands strong, let no one stray it
If someone gives it to you, don’t you ever betray it
No matter what the cost you would be wiser to pay it
I could flip it many ways, but the best way to say it is…

[Hook]
(You gotta have love)
Everything in life a good love depends
(You gotta have love)
And in case they didn’t hear it, won’t you tell ‘em again
(You gotta have love)
Sometimes you lose love though you expect to win
(You gotta have love)
Listen to my story as the record spins
[Verse 2]
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times
I wish I could go back and reverse the time
I didn’t think that I could fit it in this verse of mine
But my heart just exploded in a burst of rhymes
And I’m thinking how could a love five years in the making
End up in such painful heartbreaking?
Somewhere between a boyfriend and a husband
But still I was one rose short of the dozen
I should’ve treated her right and she would be here tonight
I wanna send this brief memo to my ex-wife
If there’s one thing you carry for the rest of your life
On the subject of love take my honest advice:
When you find that love, girl, share your soul with him
Huh, start a family and grow old with him
If you start acting up, you play the role with him
Ozzy Davis, Ruby Dee, Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman
Can all bear witness to this and say
Love saved their marriages ‘til this day
It’s the most important sign on life’s freeway
Even at the expense of sounding so cliché

[Hook]
(You gotta have love)
Everything in life a good love depends
(You gotta have love)
And in case they didn’t hear it, won’t you tell ‘em again
(You gotta have love)
Even the best of friends
(You gotta have love)
Must stop dancing when the music ends
[Verse 3]
What happens after that good love collapses?
Like the phoenix it can rise from the ashes
But perhaps if that time is never
Every time we hear this jam, we’ll be dancing together
Whether you dropped me or whether I dropped you
I want you to know that I never forgot you
So, I write a love song that you and I can rock to
The type of love song that we can do the wop to
Enough love to go around, so spread it
Anybody could get it, even with bad credit
So if your girl wants a hug, go give her a hug
I send a shout to the city of brotherly love
And if you love your brother man, let your brother man know it
Ain’t a cat alive so damn tough he can’t show it
If he thought he was, he’d thank you for telling him so
From the Last Emperor with that desolate flow
And since it seems that we’ve come to the end of our show
I’ma leave a little space for the choir to blow, and go

[Hook]
(You gotta have love)
I’m just letting y’all know the deal
(You gotta have love)
A love that’s hidden must be revealed
(You gotta have love)
Until I find that love that’s real
(You gotta have love)
Only with time can my wounds heal"
I Have a Dream,Martin Luther King Jr.,[],"I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.

Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.

But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.

In a sense we have come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned.

Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked ""insufficient funds."" But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check -- a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice. We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quick sands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.

It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. 1963 is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.

But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred.

We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force. The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. They have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.

As we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, ""When will you be satisfied?"" We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied, as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating ""For Whites Only."" We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.

I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.
Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair.

I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.

I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.""

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.

I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.

I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

I have a dream today.

I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification; one day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.

I have a dream today.

I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.

This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.

This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with a new meaning, ""My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring.""

And if America is to be a great nation this must become true. So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania!
Let freedom ring from the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado!

Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California!

But not only that; let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!

Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee!

Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi. From every mountainside, let freedom ring.

And when this happens, when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, ""Free at last! free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!"""
Nature of the Threat,Ras Kass,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse]
Let freedom ring with a buckshot, but not just yet
First, we need to truly understand the nature of the threat
And a pale man walks in the threshold of darkness
Roughly 20,000 years ago the first humans evolved
With the phenotypical trait, genetic recessive
Blue eyes, blonde hair and white skin
Albinism apparently was a sin to the original man, Africans
So the mutants traveled North of the equator
Called Europeans later, the first race haters
So here's the Devil's alpha to the beta
'Cause history's best qualified to teach one
Quoting German philosopher Schopenhauer
""Every white man is a faded or a bleached one""
Migration created further mutation
Genetic drifts, evolution through recombination
Adaptation to the climate
As the Caucus mountain man reverted to that of a primate
Savage Neanderthals, until the late Paleolithic age
That's when the black Grimaldi man came
With the symbol of the dragon, fire and art
Check cave paintings in France and Spain to the Venus of Willendorf
Around 2000 B.C. Southern Russians migrate in small units
Those who travel West populated Europe
Those who went East settled in Iran, known as Aryans
1500 B.C. some crossed the Khyber Pass into India and
Created Hinduism, the first caste system, the origins of racism
A white dot on the forehead meant elite
The black dot - defeat; untrustable, untouchables
They wrote the holy Vedas in Sanskrit
That's the language that created Greek, German, Latin and English
Now the Minoans around 2000 B.C
Starts on the island of Crete in the Agean Sea
The Greek culture begins Western civilization
But ""Western civilization"" means ""white domination""
Mycenaeans learned from Kemet, called Egypt in Greek
It existed since at least 3000 B.C
Creatin' geometry and astronomy
This knowledge influenced Plato, Socrates and Hippocrates
'Cause Imhotep, the real father of medicine
Was worshiped in Greece and Rome in the form of a black African
The word Africa comes from the Greek ""Aphrike""
Meaning ""without cold""
The word philosophy means ""love of knowledge""
Stole from first man, Greek power expands
The first Greek fraternities band
The word gymnasium is Greek for ""naked""
This was the place where adolescent boys were educated, and molested
This was accepted because Greek culture was homosexual
For example, Sappho trained girls on the island of Lesbos;
Hence, the word Lesbian (ey, let these dumb motherfuckers know!)
December 25th, the birth of Saturn
A homosexual god, now check the historical pattern
December 25th, now thought the birth of Christ
Was Saturnalia, when men got drunk
Fucked each other then beat their wife
Fact is, it was still practiced, 'til they called it Christmas
So put a gerbil on your Christmas list
The Hellenistic Era, Alexander the Great
Conquers all the way to India leavin' four successor states
By the Fifth century B.C., R.O.M.E
Succeeds to be the conqueror of Egypt and Greece
But had the threat of the black Phoenicians in Sicily
The Punic Wars begin, 264 B.C
The black general Hannibal and Carthaginian Peace
In 146 B.C. Carthage fell after a six-month siege
Rome sold every citizen to slavery
The first genocide of history
And more bisexuality in sight; Julius Caesar was known as
""every woman's husband and every man's wife""
Spartacus Revolt, a slave rebellion that lost
Where 6,000 slaves was nailed on a cross
Cross, aw, shit, Jesus Christ, time for some act-right
Christians get your facts right
'Cause Christ was not his name, that's Greek for ""One who is anointed""
Yeshua Ben Yosef was his name, do Christians know this?
So who do you praise? Do you know his name?
Or do you do this in vain?
Accepting the religion they gave slaves to behave?
Peep the description of historian Josephus
""Short, dark, with an underdeveloped beard was Jesus""
He had the Romans fearin' revolution
The solution was to take him to court and falsely accuse him
After being murdered by Pilate how can it be
These same white Romans established Christianity
Constantine would later see the cross in a dream
In his vision, it read In hoc signo vinces
""In this sign we conquer"" - Manifest Destiny
In 325 he convened the Nicene Creed
And separated god into three
Decided Jesus was born on December 25th
And raised then on the third day is a myth
Plus to deceive us
Commissioned Michelangelo to paint white pictures of Jesus
He used his aunt, uncle, and nephew
Subconsciously that affects you
It makes you put white people closer to God
(Yo! Man got game like a motherfucker)
True indeed, fuck it, Jihad
In the eight century Muslims conquered
Spain, Portugal and France and controlled it for 700 years
They never mention this in history class
'Cause ofays are threatened when you get the real lesson
Moors from Baghdad, Turkey threatened European Christians
Meaning, the white way of life; hence the Crusades for Christ
On November 25th, 1491
Santiago defeats the last Muslim stronghold, Granada
King Ferdinand gave thanks to God for victory
And the Pope of Rome and declared this date to forever be
A day of ""Thanksgiving"" for all European Christians
Now listen, when you celebrate ""Thanksgiving""
What you are actually celebrating
Is the proclamation of the Pope of Rome
Who later, in league with Queen Isabella
Sent Cardinal Ximenos to Spain
To murder any blacks that resisted Christianity
These Moors, these black men and women were from Baghdad, Turkey
And today, you eat the turkey for your ""Thanksgiving"" day
As the European powers destroyed the Turkeys
Who were the forefathers of your mothers and fathers
Now fight the power, bitch-ass niggas

Now around this time, whites started callin' us Negroes
That's Spanish for ""black object"" meaning we're not really people
But property, and the triangle trade begins - they seize us
Queen Elizabeth sends the first slaves on a ship named Jesus
Stealin' land from the indigenous natives
Gave them alcohol to keep the Red Man intoxicated
Whites claim they had to civilize these pagan animals
But up until 1848 there's documented cases
Of whites being the savage cannibals, eating Indians
In 1992, it's Jeffery Dahmer
They slaughtered a whole race with guns
Drugs, priests and nuns
1763, the first demonic tactic of biological warfare
As tokens of peace, Sir Jeffery Amherst
Passed out clothing and blankets to the Indian community
Infested with small pox, knowing they had no immunity
Today it's AIDS, you best believe it's man made
'Cause ain't a damn thing changed, let me explain
Now since people of color are genetically dominant
And Caucasoids are genetically recessive
And whites expect to be predominant, meaning survive as a race then
They simply must take precautions
That's why they're worried about their future now
'Cause by 2050 almost all the Earth's population will be brown
Then black, so understandin' that, whites counter-react
(Man I'm saying, the fools ain't nothing but a teaspoon of milk in a world coloured with joy)
So they created a system
To force blacks into an unnatural position
That re-enforces the position of natural inferiority
In addition, created guns and developed the ethnocentric view
That God justifies every fuckin' thing they do
Condition people to perceive whites' culture as civilized
And every other culture considered primitive - not true
Racism is the system of racial subjugation against non-whites
In every areas of human relation
Entertainment, education, labor, politics
Law, religion, sex, war and economics
See blacks were 3/5ths of a man with tax purposes intended
You think you're Afro-American? You're a 14th amendment and a good nigga
Jews don't salute the fuckin' swastika
But niggas pledge allegiance to the flag that accosted ya
They never teach about the break of islands like Jamaica
But before slaves came here whites would take a
Pregnant woman, hang her from a tree by her toes
Slice her stomach with a knife and let the unborn baby fall to the flo'
And stomp an unborn child in front of all the slaves
To inbreed fear, so they'd be scared and behave
And not rebel more
Understand all whites must be perceived as potential predators
I paraphrase historian Ishakamusa Barashango
""Understand that, regardless of the lofty ideas engraved on paper in such documents as the Constitution or Declaration, the basic nature of the European American white man remains virtually unchanged""
So, check
This is the nature of the threat"

Well, I was ridin' in shotgun, speedin' down the highway
Listenin' to music, haven't slept in like five days

It feels real, I swear to God this shit pretend though

Plannin' on a tan, I'm in the sand
And we'll be jammin', make it bounce
While we dancin' on the clouds until I'm landin' in my house
Remember when my moms would hate me standin' on the couch

Yeah, I'm only eighteen, I got skills though

And now it’s safe to say it’s be running out of patience!
Frustration, you want some separation
You want no placement within this mess I’m making

I hope you know that I'm for real
My love is Super Size, ain't no Happy Meal
But if I'm gonna stay (Got to wear a glove if we're gonna make love)
I don't wanna play
Baby roulette

I come from Bed-Stuy
Where niggas either do or they gon' die
Gotta keep the Ratchett close by
Someone murdered
Nobody seen, nobody heard it
Just another funeral service
Niggas will get at you
Come through shinin', they yap you
In broad daylight kidnap you
Feds get clap too
Police stay on us like tattoos
Niggas only grind 'cause we have to
Money is power
Sling crack, weed, and powder
Fiends come through every hour
It's all about that dollar
And we no deal with cowards
Weak lamb get devoured
By the lion in the concrete jungle
The strong stand and rumble
The weak fold and crumble
It's the land of trouble
Brooklyn home of the greatest rappers
BIG comes first then the queen comes after
[Chorus]
Now put your lighters up (Bed-Stuy)
Put your lighters up (New York)
Put your lighters up (D.C.)
Keep putting your lighters up (Philadelphia)
Put your lighters up (Detroit)
Put your lighters up (Chi-Town)
Keep putting them lighters up
No matter where you from, put your lighters up

[Verse 2]
Now, let me give you a walk through
Show you what to do and you don't do
Where it's not safe to go to
Them boys approach you
Better say quick who you close to
Don't come through if niggas don't know you
'Cause people is talking
The streets is watching
The D's is lurking
Stash the nine in the garbage
The life of a hustler
The life of a gambler
Dice game, kill more niggas than cancer
You know who you fuck with
Brooklyn don't run, we run shit
Roll up and just bumrush shit
We don't play that
Out in BK, not at all
Gor a pound leave your face on the wall
R.I.P. in memory of
Never show thy enemies love
We get it on where we live
You better have a pass when you cross that bridge
Welcome to Brooklyn

Now put your lighters up (L.A.)
Put your lighters up (V.A.)

Damn homie I'm so tore
And I don't think I'm ever gone smoke no more
And I don't think I'm ever gone drink no more
But fuck it, bartender you can give me one more

Damn homie I'm so tore
(Lighting the dutch like)
And I don't think I'm ever gone smoke no more

And I don't think I'm ever gone drink no more
(Back at the bar like)
Fuck it, bartender you can give me one more

[Verse 3]
See, BIG done told you
I'm the hottest bitch on the planet
Biggest sex symbol, since Janet
The Zanotti bandit
Laying in the cut like a bandage
Come through Fulton St. in the vanquish
Doing them damage
And if you don't understand it
Then let me give it to you in Spanish
Soy la señorita más linda del barrios
Y lo es abo tu eres despacio
Still over in Brazil sipping Moscato
You must of forgot though
So I'mma take you back to the block yo
Put you on to how we rock yo
Some are boosting
12-year-olds prostituting
Hit-men hired for execution
There's no solution
Niggas still piss in the hallways
Fiends get high on em' all day
The youth them bang at the cops off the roof
If you don't know my town is the truth
Welcome to Brooklyn

Now put your lighters up (New Jersey)
Put your lighters up (Boston)
Put your lighters up (B'more)

Cradle of Civilisation,Lowkey,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Lowkey]
I remember when I was growing up, if my mother got angry or frustrated with me, she'd say ""oh, esh ked﻿ heluwa el hurriya""
And the basic translation of that is ""Oh, how beautiful is freedom""
But where is freedom?

[Hook: Mai Khalil & Lowkey]
Oh, esh ked﻿ heluwa el hurriya
Oh, esh ked﻿ heluwa el hurriya
Oh, esh ked﻿ heluwa el hurriya
Close my eyes, I can still hear my ummi saying
Oh, esh ked﻿ heluwa el hurriya
Oh, esh ked﻿ heluwa el hurriya
Oh, esh ked﻿ heluwa el hurriya
But where is our freedom?

[Verse 1: Lowkey]
This is for Baghdad, the place of my mothers birth
The cradle of civilisation, for what it’s worth
The land I’ve never seen, culture I’ve never known
Iraq is in my heart, my blood, my flesh and bones
The air I’ve never breathed, fragrance I’ve never smelt
The pride I never had, the nationality that I never felt
Saddam was bad, are the American’s even more so?
They made me groan like I was missing part of my torso
But I never picked up a grenade in my garden
I never saw people I love die starving
I never saw my family die through many years of sanctions
While the ruler’s family lived in palaces and mansions
I never had a family member kidnapped for a ransom
I never lost a friend to violence that was random
Bombings, occupation, torture, intimidation
A million dead people doesn’t equal liberation
[Hook: Mai Khalil & Lowkey]
Oh, esh ked﻿ heluwa el hurriya
Oh, esh ked﻿ heluwa el hurriya
Oh, esh ked﻿ heluwa el hurriya
Close my eyes, I can still hear my ummi saying
Oh, esh ked﻿ heluwa el hurriya
Oh, esh ked﻿ heluwa el hurriya
Oh, esh ked﻿ heluwa el hurriya (Listen)
But where is our freedom?

[Verse 2: Lowkey]
Forget division based on ethnicity or religion
Whether you Sunni, Shia, Kurdish or Christian
Pain is still pain if you’re a person that’s missing
We all deserve a life in this earth that we live in
Is there enough words that can say
How deeply Baghdad is burnin' today
And it’s not about pity, hands out or sympathy
It’s about pride, respect, honour and dignity
Babies being born with deformities from uranium
Those babies aren’t just Iraqi, they’re Mesopotamian
What I view on the news is making me shiver
Cause I look at the victims and see the same face in the mirror
This system of division makes it harder for you and me
Peace is a question, the only answer is unity
So many dreams about this place that I’ve never seen
The place my family had to leave in the 70’s
[Hook: Mai Khalil & Lowkey]
Oh, esh ked﻿ heluwa el hurriya
Oh, esh ked﻿ heluwa el hurriya
Oh, esh ked﻿ heluwa el hurriya
Close my eyes, I can still hear my ummi saying
Oh, esh ked﻿ heluwa el hurriya
Oh, esh ked﻿ heluwa el hurriya
Oh, esh ked﻿ heluwa el hurriya
But where is our freedom?

[Verse 3: Lowkey]
It rains white phosphorus in Fallujah
This is for those that won’t live to see the future
Sorry that I wasn’t there, Sorry that I couldn’t help
I’m sorry for every tear, Sorry you’ve been put through hell
Still I feel like an immigrant, Englishman amongst Arabs and an Arab amongst Englishmen
Like I said they never gave me the culture
But they did give me Kubbat Halab, Hakaka and Dolma
Ana isme Kareem
Wa ohmre thalatha wa-’ishrun
Umi min Baghdad, wa abuya min Dover
And that’s the combination that I carry on my shoulders
Still I rep, till my death, till they kill and steal my flesh
From now all the way back to Gilgamesh
Such a villianised and criticised nation
You will always be the cradle of civilization
[Outro: Lowkey]
In my sleep, in my dreams
Motherland I can still feel you calling me
In my sleep, in my dreams
Motherland I can still feel you calling me
In my sleep, in my dreams
Motherland I can still feel you calling me
I can still feel you calling me
I can still feel you calling me"

(""You better take off, before I break off"")
(""I don't give a fuck, I don't play that shit"")

[Verse 1]
I'mma write this here rhyme like Guru's in the passenger
Standin on the East Coast, starin out to Africa
Accolades, Escalades fade
My vernacular remain in tact for the generation that's comin after
The average rapper you praise days numbered like a calendar
Challengers caliber mediocre enter the catheter
IV's, wrap 'em up, mad as fuck, need a ladder up
Escalator, elevator, skyscraper, hella haters
On Preemo beats, meditate a bit to elevate my spit
Scribble daily scripts, hell in wit
Angels I strangle the instrument mangle chops, can't go pop
I gotta remain boom bap, true that, who that be?
Mr. ""Say Goodnight"", I'mma blaze the mic willingly
Kill or be killed industry, and the realest of real emcees
Solo flow enemy, future of the rap
Golden Era dead
(""No time for looking back, it's done"")
[Chorus]
We in the 25th hour, it's now or never
We gotta get it before it's gone forever, remember
In the end time waits for no man, what's your plan?

We gotta get it before it's gone forever, remember
In the end time waits for no man, what's your plan?
(""No time for looking back, it's done"")

[Verse 2]
Before I fade to black, face the mirror, face the fact
Fate appear to backtrack where the plaques at?
Where the love for the cat?
Fortified flow, fire from fire like fame
Foresayer in Josiah desire to perspire
The 25th hour upon me, calmly walk the wire
Annihilate enemy ire any higher than I are in the sky
Or heaven I require less than mediocre
I reawoken the deeper thoughts of sleepin prophets
Regardless of others offers I authentic dialect, I'm a vet
Y'all are just wakin up, 'Say Goodnight'
Slap a rapper, take his mic, greater height
Spit a rhyme saber like
Inner mind paid the price, A-B-C-alike
Hey Preem, we a tight, chemistry
Any beats sent to me I'mma instantly write
'til the fingertips crippled
It'll be sort of arthritis to finish a line
If you more than rhyme this
(""No time for looking back, it's done"")
[Chorus]
We in the 25th hour, it's now or never
We gotta get it before it's gone forever, remember
In the end time waits for no man, what's your plan?
(""No time for looking back, it's done"")

[Verse 3]
You ever chant with the rebels, dance with the devils?
Answered the higher levels, ride with the iron elbow to elbow
In hellish circles where the heat is echoed
You ever let go, stresses from pressures boilin beyond the kettle?
You ever petrified, exorcised demons
Believing you leave 'em breathin they'll get even
Odds are beyond y'all, achievin peaceful means of seekin deacons
Ain't no way out, they 'bout beat, by any means
Ain't necessary but they bury them very young, hell or heaven
Them adolescents, is pedalin, packin metal and settlin
Street wars, revolves life behind tight walls
When I falls, psychos strike the right chords
They at pause, bumpin Ricky Ross
Kids is on crack, they lost
Wipe a lot, no time for looking back, it's done
Golden era over and dead, I'm over your heads
{""No time for looking back, it's done""}

[Chorus]
We in the 25th hour, it's now or never
We gotta get it before it's gone forever, remember
In the end time waits for no man, what's your plan?

Different color coupes but I'm in love with the black one
On point, cause you get R.I.P.'s when slacking
So the stash box big enough to squeeze the MAC in
Yeah, I'm fairly new but I demand some respect
Cause I already wear your advance on my neck
I'm fresh off the jet, then I breeze to the beaches
Blue Yankee fitted, G-Unit sneakers

Decorate the basement, full of street sweepers

The Roc the Mic tour, I threw off my chain
My Sprewell's spinning man, I'm doing my thing
And whodi now in trouble now that you in the game
Come on now, we all know gold is getting old
The ice in my teeth keep the Cristal cold

Look, I can't even walk through the mall no more

Slow down little nigga, don't exceed your speed

After I'm done you: clappin' the crew
Hell yeah I fuck fans, guess what, your favorite rapper does too
In a minute I'ma have the jeweler makin' my rims spin
My crew run wild like the Jamaicans in Kingston
Nuttin' but bling bling in your face boy; that's why my neck
Shine like one of the shirts that Puffy and Mase wore
I done found a nympho as soon as I pop a bra
She at my balls, head first like a soccer star
You can only stand next to the man if you proper
I take care of birds like an animal doctor

So I'm out for revenge like one of Bin Laden cousins

Yeah we in the Bahamas with AK's on the stage
The ice in the Jacob watch'll make a broke nigga take somethin'
So I gotta keep the fo'-fifth with no safety button
G-Unit get that money, I know some artists is starvin'
But play the game like they rich, to me the shit funny
I know you see me comin'; cause on the front of the Maybach
It say payback for those that hated on me
I hate when niggas claim they bangin' a gang
You ain't a Crip like Snoop, you ain't a Blood like Game
See I been havin' beef, I got my own bulletproof vest
Most of my enemies dead, I got about two left
Until my last breath, I'm sendin' niggas bullet holes
Innocent bystanders get hit tryna be heroes
You know how we roll, everywhere that we go
It's Fo-Fo's, Calicos, and Desert Eagles, yeah

Yo, yo

Used to play the 280 party rec rooms
Now I play the big spots all in the city
Spread champagne, scopin out bitties
Pick one, thick one son with small titties
It really doesn't matter as long as she's pretty
Come here mami, dancin right beside me

Kick 'em right out and the day starts over
Where I don't stop drinkin and I can't stand sober
In the morning when I wake up I get up just to ill
TD Bank is what I do with the mills
Bracelets, Cuban neck is on chill
Polar bear ice, I stay dressed to kill
I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill

Children of God,Heavy Metal Kings,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
Never doubt your God, children singing songs about Jihad
Explosions that blow cars over buildings from afar
We the children of a bloodstained revolution
Gun bang, forever shoot and run fam, get your Uzi love thing
Retribution Timberland boots, leather gooses
In the undisclosed black bulletproof with the extra shooter
Bought a box of banana clips from these anarchists
Like Tim Osman commanding the ship on dialysis
More pain more gain, 9/11 was a war game
More enemies, more friends, more fame
Listen to propaganda cock the hammer
We can stop a man but how do you destroy an army that’s a phantom?
How do you kill a militia that’s invisible?
Mystical, peep what official pistols do, kid we invincible
How do you stop the unstoppable, unkillable?
The salvation of God, now sit back and listen to the song y’all

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
I heard children sing Allahu Akhbar in Turkey
One had a Russian AK, dirty Iverson jersey
I don’t know if it made me proud or if it disturbed me
I guess it’s not as bad as kids being fucked by the clergy
Kufi on, Glock cocked moving through the palace
A dead Kennedy in California Über Alles
I’ll drink a quart of virgin blood inside a Buddha chalice
I took the head off a Kennedy from the roof in Dallas
Yeah I wish that Ron Paul ran again
If not then I’mma have to take the lead like Jeff Hanneman
(Seasons of the abyss) y’all falling for the trap again
.38 leave your fucking body like a mannequin
Yeah if Billy blast at you I blast with him
We don’t live in a republic, it’s just fascism

For all you niggas saying that my shit is sick
Just imagine the 90% of my brain that I ain't even used yet
Take a deep breath quick, suck in as much air
As my lungs will permit, then I start to kick that shit
I been getting busy before the planets started to turn
Before the bees, the birds and Adam and Eve occured
Prior to all creation in other words
When the female egg will merge with the man's sperm
I stand firm, my words burn through your exterior
They eat away at your interior, I'm superior
While you only pretend to be, I can double my density
From three-sixty degrees to seven-twenty instantly
Six, multiplied by five by four by three by two then one
Go head and calculate the sum
The time has cometh, I was summoned to punish
Motherfuckers with mouths that runneth over with rubbish
When I come through, niggas stand stiller than statues
Cause if I have to, I'll battle your whole rap crew
Then I'll attack you with words that's absurd
And rip your fucking skin off just to get on your nerves"

Ay

[Verse 1]
Sharks in the dunk tank, vipers in the garden
Locusts stole the groceries out the local Farmer's Market
All God's critters hold positions
Some are violent, some are victims
Each alive is an equal and vital piston I support
So when the piranhas honor New York
My daddy long legs dangled and mangled for sport
And while I bring in every dink in the kingdom with open wings
It all boils down to them shit-soaked pigs
The pigs (what), the pigs (what), the dregs of what y'all aim for
The gluttonous muddy stomachs under the pudgy cakehole
Two-track braniac using the food and payroll
To chew up and consume every cookie, crumb, and peso
And place a cloven hoof on the lucrative when convenient
As the bourbon-odor smokers' coughs smolder off the Cohiba
If Noah had the benefit of hindsight on his ship
He could've snatched two unicorns and left behind the motherfucking...
[Chorus]
Pigs!
God damn... pigs!
Potbelly... pigs!
Punch-drunk... pigs!
Take money, money... pigs!
Loudmouth... pigs!
Wide load... pigs!
Let's make a deal...

[Verse 2]
When all the wolves in woolly wigs
Have huffed, and puffed, and blew the bricks
The skulls of Brooklyn's cruelest pigs
Will rain on Fulton's newest kicks
As mulish swine of all surrounding counties sniff the gruesomeness
We pass around the pineapples and pull the pins in unison
I will gladly feed you to the breed who wants you sacrificed
No pagan or sacrilege, just bacon for scavengers
I will gladly seat you with the chickens, not the passengers
Hopefully the crack in his armor spreads to his avarice
Never that, Wilburs multiply quicker than tribbles
And hunt their truffles in fistfuls, but it was all bells and whistles
Bougie this and Bougie that...
War pig or pussy cat...
Glitzy to the pork ribs, had to gold-leaf the booby traps
Powder-pink, double-breasted, mess of mud and money
Waddle off the fire to make his stubborn tummy wroggle
And while I don't really know the working details of your tribes
I know that that's one ugly fucking tie
Asshole...

Pigs!
God damn... pigs!
Potbelly... pigs!
Punch-drunk... pigs!
Take money, money... pigs!
Loudmouth... pigs!
Wide load... pigs!
Let's make a deal...

[Verse 3]
Apple in his mouth, Maraschino eyes
Party like the butcher boy's cleaver is alive
I mosey into sixteen hours of smoke in the misty winter
To see the county fair's blue ribbon winner as dinner
Then dance until the sun has kissed your blisters in the morning
As the misery was dormant and divvied in crispy portions
Corporates want to lure him in and whore him. Or does he whore the corparates to expand the more important forums for him
Push the mortar pestle past the ordinary orchard
When the frilly border's faded is the product mine or yours, pig?
Mine, plus I toss a token where I go:
Directly to the worms who shovel shit and yellow snow
This little piggy went to the market with a target
And will subsequently know the armor-piercing forks of farmers
Final words for the finer birds taking notes:
I dig a chick in pig tails, ""That's all Folks!""

Pigs!
God damn... pigs!
Potbelly... pigs!
Punch-drunk... pigs!
Take money, money... pigs!

Keeper of the Seven Keys,Heavy Metal Kings,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: Raekwon sample]
Walked in, both of us looked like terrorists
Walked in, both of us looked like terrorists
Masks on, second floor, dun yo, I handle this

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
When y’all was fucking around with Bush I was running with Saddam
Puffing on the kush and building with the imam
The only thing you motherfuckers set was the alarm
I’m stronger than the motherfucking Tet in Vietnam
Whoever wanna knuckle up will be deformed
Praying to the altar of the church and reading psalms
I don’t mean weapons when I say that I’m dealing arms
I chop a motherfucking body up and feed the dogs
Me and Billy ain’t even deities we the gods
You a faggot, we the OGs that’s in the yard
Only a select few believe in Fard
The rest gonna meet with Shaitan to bleed and starve
Left hook astronomy, you seeing stars
If I ain’t in the studio drunk I be in bars
Bill buck-fifty this pussy and leave a scar
You might own a team, believe the league is ours
[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
He was the keeper of the seven keys, eighteen a brick
A hundred and twenty-six thousand in a briefcase, give me my shit
It had the look that said, “I am the power”
The white angel with a scorpion branded across the particles of powder
Martyrs in the tower, owls, apocalyptic hour
Sound of pistol shower, crowning a system that devour
Mysticism shrouded in whispers, profound with an interest
Push a button and blow you up with a bomb from a distance
Like for instance in the parked car across from the precinct
Looking out my window watching your window falling to pieces
Bombing emergency, counterinsurgency, serpents flee
Furnished by me, sponsored courtesy of the murder spree
Using religion, science versus superstition
Came from the future to teach us how we overthrew the system
He lost an eye and several fingers on his right hand
Letterbomb sent to him by unidentified fans
The truth was never revealed, he retired to an island near Fiji
So his past would never reappear
Or so he thought until he caught some unidentifiable virus
They say he has five weeks to live

But for the girl so she could love herself

Listen, my ex-chick’s raw, I had to put it to rest
I fuck crazy bitches though ’cause psycho pussy the best
Now shawty sendin' me texts, spaz and stress
Askin' who I'm with and where I am and if I been smashin'
I told her yes laughin', I don’t owe you
Baby, you will regret tellin' me that I don’t know you
The shit is over, you lyin' to get me over every week
It’s an emergency, I finna lose composure
How many times I done told you to just let go of it?
If home is where the heart is, you heartless so now you homeless
Lonely bitch, why you blowin' up my phone again?
I killed your self esteem, I give your ego my condolences
Rollin' with folks who only know you as a failure
When I met you, you showed your best parts, you like a trailer
And now I’m feelin' like your ass done got the best of me
Makin' sure that your ass is nothin' like my next to be

Here is a reminder dear, you was a recliner chair
Always tryin' to fall back from me, now you tryin' to appear
‘Cause you see vagina hairs all around my designer wear
You like ""Mickey, please call back honey"", funny, nope
I dropped the dark phoenix, we wasn’t at all speakin'
Blind as your ex-man, Cyclops, it was hard seein'
You was my Jean Grey until you went psycho on me
Ghost writer ‘cause she was stereotypin' for me
You think you know somebody till you see they true colors
Girls being Frankie Lymon, singin' why do fools love us?
So for two Summers, she was a true blooder
Breakin' my heart but I’m gonna get you sucker
Vampire slayer, can’t fly a prayer for this damn lying traitor
Who didn’t stand by and make it work
I hate to jerk all my damn life, you damn right
Even though I fucked her and told her I loved her last night

Baggin' dope up in the backseat, your package's walk

Why’d you have me build that bridge to your heart if you gonna burn it up?
It only work to make the mistakes when you gonna learn from ‘em
I tried to show you that some changes could be permanent
And told you that I loved you from jump
But now them hurdles is impossible to walk around
And you’ve been searching through my phone like it’s a lost and found
You seeing women that I know then wanna talk about it
Every five minutes you been arguing and walking out
You call my mama house and even hit my manager
It’s getting hard to handle you when everything is scandal
And you looking in the mattress for evidence
Of spending any second with another, accusing me so much
You make me wish I would’ve done it
And after what my mother did to keep you in the country
And to help you get your papers and your visa from the government
You’ve been on some other shit, I know I should be done with it
But I could never leave you ’cause I love you, I put up with it, boo

But now you leaving and you’re weeping like you’re grieving to death
And you’re the only one I ever shared achievements with
You ain’t the woman of my dreams and I ain’t sleeping again
I swear, I need you here and I hope that you see it clear
Got a shallow understanding of most of my deepest fears
I never thought that you the one who would be scrambling
‘Cause running from family and running my family
But uh, nothing I had in life been half as right
And now you showed your true colors, I can see it plain as black and white
No shade of grey to make mistakes, I made a sacrifice
Hungry for your love, now quench my appetite so come on

Proceed With Caution,Benefit,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'metal', 'jazz']","[INTRO]
At all costs, (at all costs), at all costs, (at all costs)
""It's vicious......Inhuman""

[Verse 1: Benefit]
Professional, upping the decibel a decimal above
Extraterrestrial audible vessels
For blood audible missiles and vocal dismissals
Like pistols tearing through emcees skeletal gristles
Beneficial's, Ripping in the kids brain tissues
Leaving them a bit retarded with personal issues
Personal miss-use, of my tracks is tested deadly
Infested steady when my tracks are pressed and ready
To floods the brain like cocaine ingested heavy
Invest in any, bit of protection when testing Benny
I've battled plenty, and everyone is rattle empty
Without a skeleton to hold 'em up they had to temp me
And then correctly, spitting at me like a Jet-ski
Go ahead and press me, bones crunch like Nestle
Arrest me, Sentence me and lock me away
So the streets can be safe for emcees to play
By the way, when I spit don't get hit by a stray
Cause every random word I say can shatter your vertebrae
Every verb I spray is a mist called Herb-away
Word play, that will keep emcees on the curb all day
In a verbal way, I get violent and kill quick
To define me kids make up words like ""Ill-Sick""
Who's a relic, whack emcee's heads are real thick
So the target is big, my metaphors will stick
[Hook]
Unnecessary emotion
So logical [5x]
Proceed with caution
Unnecessary emotion
So unemotional [5x]
Proceed with caution
It will be painful
So logical [5x]
Proceed with caution
It will be painful
So unemotional [5x]
Proceed with caution
[Verse 2: Benefit]
Behold Benefit, the old and degenerate
Are healed by the power of his subject and predicate
The ""Pro-ject"" deliberate, whole of the rhetoric
Emcees will fall like the soul of confederates
Total considerate apologies follow these
Battle anthologies, emcees say please
And possibly I'll display generosity
And watch thee velocity, when I'm spitting this atrocity
But probably not, and the robberies hot
When kids steal my rhymes and ignite on spot
If you bite on top, from being whack and dropped
Call it ""I Bit Benefit and Made Pop""
And you get a hit, but being illiterate
Ignorant, and coming out illegitimate
My wrath will wreak havoc on your family
Gradually, everyone will die through a homicidal tragedy
Long and vital legacy, prophecy place me
President of emcee's genocide agency
Feeling me is like feeling a flame in hell
Casting a demon spell, so emcee's are dreaming well
And thinking they're real, knocked out on Nyquil
In a dream land where they sick and real type ill
But lovely dreams soon come to a nightmare
When they battle Benefit and they die right there
[Hook]

It will be painful
But I will try"
I Dont Wanna Care Right Now,Lupe Fiasco,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
I'm not a Turtle , I'm a turbo
Haters pray to god that I turn slow
Like I'm sipping on purple
But I ain't on your glow
I'm in a whole 'nother circle
Trying to keep it clean like church clothes
Said that respect was something had to work for
But that ain't gonna work though
Get your respect, but lose all my worth, no
You can dead that, get a hearse, go
Don't need 48 you'll find a killer in the first floor
It was me boy, to commercials
Feeling out of place like PETA at a fur store
So I left with a couple dozen fur coats
Said I could never break away from your hold
Watch me, turn though
Said that I blew it like Turquoise
Just mad hear it all in your word choice
Know it hurts but I really don't care though
Let me rub it in, get it all up in that ho
[Hook]
I can see the morning creeping up on us
It's like the world's in my hands now
I'm feeling so rebellious from all of the envy crowding around me
I don't wanna care right now
I don't wanna care right now
No I really don't, really don't, wanna care right now

[Verse 2]
Oh-oh Go-Go-God over everything-thing
You fly but stars over everything-thing
And I'm one of them, yeah one of th-the-them
Oh I'm not o-o-one? Well I'm a hundred th-the-then
I'm a hundred mother loving stars
You're no lights, you're an undercover car
I'm an ambulance, and a fire truck, and some strobe lights, tied up!
Shining all in your eyes, all out of yours and all into mine
Lights and stars is all intertwined
And I'm feeling like Malcolm looking all out the blinds
Any means any means, and you can do anything anything
And the flow tight, skinny jeans skinny jeans
Hit you like Pacquiao, Philippines Philippines

[Hook]
I can see the morning creeping up on us
It's like the world's in my hands now
I'm feeling so rebellious from all of the envy crowding around me
I don't wanna care right now
I don't wanna care right now
No I really don't, really don't, wanna care right now
[Verse 3]
Ya'll know what I'm a let on
I'm Lupe, yes sir, who they
They yester, and I'm today, and tomorrow, hooray
Can I get a hip-hip for the new K-I-N-G, nigga I-AM-HE
Got the game in the clutch like Iron Sheik
You ball little boy, But I N-B-A
With a hand for the world, you a boy band with a dance and a twirl
I'm a rockstar with a band so thorough
Big ass tour bus that's jammed full of girls
T-t-tell em what it do, holla from the bottom, yell it from the roof
T-t-tell em what it do, I don't care about your curfew
I'll tell you when I'm through boy

[Hook]
I can see the morning creeping up on us
It's like the world's in my hands now
I'm feeling so rebellious from all of the envy crowding around me
I don't wanna care right now
I don't wanna care right now
No I really don't, really don't, wanna care right now

[Outro]
Tell em what it do, yell it from the bottom, yell it from the roof boy
Tell em what it do, holla from the bottom, yell it from the roof boy
Tell em what it do, holla from the bottom, yell it from the roof boy
Tell em what it do, holla from the bottom, yell it from the roof boy
I don't wanna, I-I don't wanna, I-I-I don't wanna
C-c-c-care right, c-c-care right now
I don't wanna, I-I don't wanna, I-I-I don't wanna

Diary of a Madman,Gravediggaz,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Judge, Lawyer, Woman​​, Shabazz the Disciple]
​​​They killed my baby, oh God, they killed my baby
Order in the court, order in the court
​​I will make you pay for this you murderers
I said order in the court now!
Now, before this court passes judgement
Will the four defendants please rise and approach the bench
Trust me guys, it's all under control
The judge is my uncle, he'll take the insanity plea
Oh yeah, don't forget my retainer balance
Okay, I understand you guys are pleading insanity, claiming
Demonic spirits possessed you to do these hideous murders
(Yeah, word)
Can you please explain to this court how these so-called spirits made you into these raving madmen

[Verse 1: Shabazz the Disciple]
Be a witness as I exercise my exorcism
The evil that lurks within the sin, the terrorism
Possessed by evil spirits, voices from the dead
I come forth with Gravediggaz and a head full of dread
I've been examined ever since I was semen
They took a sonogram and seen the image of a demon
At birth, nurses surrounded me with needles
And drugged me all up with the diseases of evil
Grew up in Hell, now I dwell in an Islamic temple
I’m fightin' a holy war in the mental
Look deep in my eyes, you'll see visions of death
Possessed by homicide is what I am obsessed
Givin' niggas brain dimples
Draggin' their asses on my hook by their temples
The cause of death is unknown to the cops
'Cause when I kill 'em, I’m not leavin' one element to autopse
First I'll assassinate him, and then I'll cremate him
Then take all of his fuckin' ashes and evaporate him
Or creep through the graveyard and hunt down your tombstone
Dig up your skeleton and stomp all your fuckin' bones
You try to haunt me, nigga? I ain't tryna hear it
Buck! Buck! Buck! I'll give your ass a holy spirit
[Break: Judge + The Grym Reaper]
Stressful, try to avoid all my impure thoughts, I am losing my mind
And it seems I don’t know what’s true or dream
Can you please explain to the court
When these problems first began?

[Verse 2: The RZArector]
The year '84, November, day 10
Overwhelmed by the wicked inspirations of an evil jinn
I realize my ideas have spawned
For 400 years of blood sweat and tears
I saw the torture, brutal murder of my father
So my brain became stained with the horror
I'm havin' reoccurring nightmares
Of bein' soakin' wet, strapped down to the electric chair
I got tackled with handcuffs and shackled and restraint
In the bottom of a holy tabernacle
They gave me nothin' to eat for two weeks
And sewed my eye lids open so I couldn't sleep
About to die from thirst, that's when the minister
Quenched my jaws with a cold glass of vinegar
Upon my wounds, they seasoned me with salt
And nailed my hands and feet to the form of a cross
Ahh!! I cry as the blood dripped inside of my eye
Refusing to die
Visions of Hell tormented my fate
So I chewed my fuckin' arm off and made an escape
[Break: Judge + (Jury)]
(Your arm?! No way, goddammit)
(Oh no, me mataron mi amigo, hijo de la gran puta
Esos cogines me mataron mi amigo que voy a cerca carajo, cono)
[Calm down, people, please calm down
Let us please proceed with the defendant's explanation]

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
Enter the realms of understanding
And take good heed or you could bleed while I’m scannin'
Three stages of pure Hell, 16 pages of red cells
*Shh* Rain drops hits the pails
Path is dull and narrow, you're stalked by a shadow
I'll pierce your skull with the fucking arrow
So narrow, only one could enter at a time
Stuck in the center, read the signs
A thousand doors to choose, you better hurry
Don’t stop, shit is getting hot as a pot of curry
On your right side there’s fire, your left, deep waters
Watch your step, it's deep waters
What's that comin' through the floor? It's a claw
*pssh* Took his fuckin' ass to the fuckin' core

[Verse 4: The Gatekeeper]
Ahhhh! Stroll through the dark conditions
I stone ya till I see sparks of friction
I chop ya like a coal miner
Then combine the drug and mix it with your blood
Some more, I give you some more and watch you crawl
Guts hit the floor, worms exit your pores
I trick ya, ha, then I'm quick to syringe
Deep between my thoughts then bust out your skin
You scream, portraits of inflictable pain, you can't stand
You're up to your hands in quicksand
You're sinking and sinking deep into the earth
Thoughts was possessed since the first day of birth
My mental says it's my turn to possess the matter
Stab you with a dagger of Jacob's ladder
Thoughts become shattered, confused and tragic
Fiery thoughts of Gravediggaz..
[Gunshots]

[Outro: Judge]
Guilty, next case"
The Apple,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
I'm a little nutty and I know it but if you go back and take a look at my history
You will see that I am not the only one who's off his rocker, there were many before me
I was always labeled the black sheep of the family, what a bad seed I'd grow to be
But if you take a look at us now, you'll see the apple didn't fall too far from the tree

[Interlude]
Haha! Haha, haha, haha!
Alright look
I'ma tell you the story from my side
Maybe you'll understand, check it out

[Verse 1]
You done witnessed unexplainable shit
Too insane to explain, people run from what they just don't get
Maybe Shady should have just hit 'em with a little bit
Did I spit too soon? Should I have spoon fed 'em it?
But I was just so eager to prove
I was even worth bein' in the same league or the room
Of the people of whom I was in
Every now and then, I look up like I was seekin' approval
Was it because of the pigment of my skin?
Or was it a figment of my imagination?
Maybe it bothered me more than it did them
Maybe it wasn't a big deal back then
But to me it was, see what it was
Was I had developed a complex from being judged
Proof spit his verse, now I'm next, let's see who balks
I'm in the booth staring back to see whose mugs
I get a reaction from, usually the first thumb
Was from Proof and the rest of the crew backed him up
And no one lied to each other 'cause none of us had deals
It was real, we just wanted tickets for that meal
[Chorus]
Sometimes, I feel like it's just me
Sometimes, I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said sometimes, I feel like it's just me
Sometimes, I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree

[Verse 2]
Ever since my mother was pregnant with a second egg
'Cause she said that I had a baby sister
Who fell out of the window, I was too young to remember
Kansas City projects, I was like five/six
And how come, I remember Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogy
If it was the projects in Missouri?
'Cause those were my best friends until Isaac
Took my tricycle and my Uncle Todd went to try to go get it back
And ended up gettin' jumped and cut in the gut
With a switch and seventy-some stitches
Which is, to this day, why my mother still tries to show me some old fake picture
Of a fictitious little sister who never existed
And this is why a part of my life's so twisted
But I can never be as sick as that bitch is
And by the way, that picture's one of my relatives
[Chorus]
Sometimes, I feel like it's just me
Sometimes, I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said sometimes, I feel like it's just me
Sometimes, I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree

[Verse 3]
You probably have to peel back layers upon layers of pain
To see why everything I say is so insane
What's different about my brain
That separates me from other players in this game?
On the surface, it may seem like a scheme
Or some sort of scam for me to get some damn sympathy
But that's the last thing I need
Is for people to walk around feelin' sorry for me
And I am not a G, never claimed to be
I gave my vest to Ca$his, just hope he don't need it more than me
But we'll see, 'cause we ain't lookin' for beef
But if it comes our way, what do we turn the other cheek? Come on

[Chorus]
Sometimes, I feel like it's just me
Sometimes, I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said sometimes, I feel like it's just me
Sometimes, I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
[Outro]
Yeah, and I'm the crazy one right?
Whatever, then let me be the crazy one!

Don’t care if it’s mine or yours, taking all this time to talk
Hop skip the monologue, out from the London fog
Run the game and never jog, full sprint
Bull shit, thinking I’m the under card
I’m the main event, favorite, own space, no paying rent
Paper chase and paper get, hustling the way I did
I should probably make a scene
I should probably break something
I should probably give on in
But I kept on keeping on, tip toed to the top ‘cause they was sleeping on
Now I’m gon ring alarms, style with a certain charm
Make a brother one of one, shooting my mouth off
Imma son of a gun and ready to come, shooting down all fear
‘Cause forever is here, cheers, cheers, cheers

Hey babe, have you heard the news?
The boy is back and he can’t lose
Some people tried to put him down
Guess whose back around
If forever is here, cheers, cheers, cheers
[Verse 2: Outasight]
And I don’t care about paying dues
Born to win, no way to choose, sitting back and making moves
Headline, breaking news, yeah, I’m erasing rules
Pencil to the page with the fade, incredible
Stamps on the passport, feet up on the dashboard
Windows seat g5, look out, that’s yours
Getting what you ask for, said it on Fame and Fortune, I’m after all
Not a moment too soon, heart so tender, you can cut it with a spoon
Get to bed at five, wake up ‘round noon
New York times, page six, gatecrash on view and what’s it to you?
Lighting up a parliament, starting up an argument
One way or another, never am I on the fence, true

[Hook 2]
Hey babe, have you heard the news?
The boy is back and he can’t lose
Some people tried to put him down
Guess whose back around
If forever is here, cheers, cheers, cheers

Laughing at you haters like I told you, told you

If you don't like what he's sayin', so what
That's life

Told you last tape I'm a killer man
I'm a rapper, what the fuck do I know
Well I'm also a nigga that came off Martin Luther King, man
Son of a dope lady
And I went to fuckin' Morehouse nigga
I accomplished something, I became something nigga
That's who I am to criticize any nigga
Oprah, Bill, Clinton, Cosby, anybody

[Verse 1]
The fat bitch singing show over, end opera
Leader of the crack Rat Pack, I Sinatra
They say I dissed Oprah
I'm like so what
I never get to jump up and down on a sofa (that's life)
Now watch me as I Cruise like Tom through the slums
Where the education's poor and the children growing dumb
In the section of the city where saditty's don't come
Where Mr. Cosby and Ms. Winfrey won't come
Unless it's a hurricane then FEMA don't come
Coming live from the city where the Dreamer came from
Standing on the same corners that he stood upon
I got violence in my waistband, death in my palm
Ask 'em am I a bad guy, ya goddamn right
I done seen how ya do a nigga when he doin' right
The Dream died on a balcony, standin' at a hotel
Now niggas whippin' coke gel and a O tale
We desegregated - put black with the white
No longer marching for rights, they sparking a pipe (that's life)
Pipe dreams, crack fiends
Cars look like ice cream
Kids see the bling-bling and they want them nice things
All cause of tennis shoes our kids drop out of schools
They said be like Mike, so ball nigga (that's life)
Now help me understand something
If you a leader and you really mean something to your people
Ain't you supposed to be in the community with your people?
Ain't you supposed to be there?
Like the only people I see in the communities
Are rappers and ball players
Where the fuck all y'all doctors?
Where y'all bourgeoisie niggas at?
All the kids got is us, Grind Time rap game

Read an old magazine, check out a new dress
I be havin' conversations with Cornel West
Killer Mike don't give a damn if it's me ya ain't likin'
The last great debate I had was with Michael Eric Dyson
Call me a dumb rapper
Girl stop, pardon me
You be hard pressed to find another rapper smart as me
Maybe Jay-Z, 2Pac, C-U-B-E
But Oprah'd rather put Superhead on TV
Now whatcha white audience gon' think about we
The same white audience that watch Bill O' Reilly
I saw the smirk on they face when you came at Luda
The same nice ladies that forgave Martha Stewart
So I can be a crook
Take money off the books
Just as long as I'm liked by a rich man's wife?
OK, hold up. I can't rap about doing crime
But if I actually do crime, and do time
I can come back out
And have a TV show
With an all white audience
If I rob shareholders of millions?
But if I rap about getting some money on the block
It's a problem?
Are you fuckin' retarded?
I'm not even gonna tell you how stupid you are right now

And his momma said the women oughta feel at home
Gettin' raped in the bathroom in the Superdome
The comment Kanye made was damn near right
But Bush hate poor people
Be 'em black or white (that's life)
Hell yeah I said it, cause Oprah won't say it
And Bill won't say it, and they still won't say it
If you really bout intelligence, you really know I'm right
If you lookin' for some leadership, look for Killer Mike (that's life)

Could we please stop fuckin' lying
Like you preachers out there who spread the myth
That young boys who sag their pants picked that shit up in prison to let niggas know they homosexuals
You in your faggot, twisted mind know that ain't true
You sick fuck, for even sayin' that shit
We wear our fuckin' pants big
Because our mothers were too poor to buy our size
So they had to buy two or three sizes up
Call it what it is nigga: poverty

You know poverty, the opposite of the big fuckin' cars and planes you drive

To all you rich bourgeoisie niggas out there
Stop ignoring your cousins in the ghetto
Because they're there
Stop looking down on 'em
Stop using crack addicts and Mexicans
As cheap labor to build your fuckin' houses
And then shitting on poor black people and Latins
You pieces of shit
That's for you rich motherfuckas: black and white
In the mean time us rappers
Us lowly b-boys and us motherfuckin' athletes'll be here in the ghetto
Servicing the motherfuckin' children
We are the new Robin Hoods
We are the Pied Pipers
We will lead the kids into a better life than the motherfuckin' lies you doing
Kids grow up, be doctors, be lawyers

I’m talking 'bout roots (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I’m talking 'bout roots

[Verse 1]
Hey, I can’t be mad at what got me ahead
I don't regret my ghetto struggle due to my success
It ain't that beautiful to write on overcoming stress
Top Ramen noodle soup, thank pappy for the fact I was fed
Look at me now but all before, ""Hey Mr. Skid Row""
The dirty south ain’t just a name the way I’ve been poor
The projects brown and white, I call it gizmo
Went from a gremlin' to them cars in Jigga's video
Can’t find a meal to a mil, only God know it
No record deal to a deal, I work hard for it
Can I live too? I’m living like my Momma told it
Before you reap it, gotta sew it
[Chorus]
I’m talking 'bout roots
I can't hate where I'm from
'Cause where I'm from made me
I came from the bottom of the slums
But now I got me... me
That’s because of my roots (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I’m talking 'bout roots (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I’m talking 'bout roots

[Verse 2]
Hey, still on my Kunta Kinte
Somebody had to bleed just for me to get away
My sister had to leave, I respect her staying safe
Oh yeah, I had to grieve, but I’m stronger to this day
Pain, I can't ignore it, you might say I'm ignorant
I’m mistaking for courage, victory so gorgeous
Make it through two Bush, I can make it through any forest
Hunger gave me the wish, but the bottom is so important
37 ave and 187 street
Miami, Carol City, now I’m part of a legacy
I’m thankful for the hood, what is love without jealousy
There’s only five letters really help me

[Chorus]
I’m talking 'bout roots
I can't hate where I'm from
'Cause where I'm from made me
I came from the bottom of the slums
But now I got me... me
That’s because of my roots (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I’m talking 'bout roots (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I’m talking 'bout roots
[Verse 3]
Hey, I know the seeds been planted
It’s damaging my soul, but my dreams been granted
That triple life towards, much deeper than Earth's planet
What could I want more than redoing? I never panic
Gets no lower than the ground beneath your feet
A man will stand for nothing if he falls for defeat
A boulder in the hand better than all in the street
If you look beneath the sand, then we all need a crease
Roots before the branches, roots before the mansions
Roots before your paper crazier than Marilyn Manson
Roots with your grandparents, roots under your canvas
Roots whether you black, white, or Spanish

[Chorus]
I’m talking 'bout roots
I can't hate where I'm from
'Cause where I'm from made me
I came from the bottom of the slums
But now I got me... me
That’s because of my roots (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I’m talking 'bout roots (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I’m talking 'bout roots"
The Good Son Pt. 1,J. Cole,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Allow me to set the scene first
This little nigga no older than seventeen in a Martin Luther King shirt
Walkin' down the mean murk, where the fiends lurk
And the same dirt’ll find a nigga
Even if you tryna' get that clean work
He caught eyes with a bad bitch in a jean skirt
She gave him a mean smirk, he smiled back
He remembered this man that hit that shit a while back
He met her, fucked her, never dialed back
How niggas do, he kept it movin', couldn’t wait to get home
Report card for his mother couldn’t wait to get shown
Straight A’s as usual, his momma would smile
Youngest child, college bound
Knew his momma was proud
Cause he was headed out the hood
He promised himself one day he’d get her out for good
That made him smile
The favorite child, but damn, fate is foul
Drive by, stray bullets that laid him out
On the pavement fading out
Now he bleeding thinking, God, man, you couldn’t wait a while
My momma struggling who gon save her now, huh?
Now he fading out thinking God, you couldn’t wait a while?
My momma need me, who gon' save her now, nigga? uh
Yeah, he’s fading out, the favorite child
He’s fading out (the favorite child)"
Even Shadows Have Shadows,Eyedea,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook 1]
I stand alone, burned every bridge over the troubled water
No longer hiding from my personality disorder
A stronger tide is coming, I've been running
Trying to function fine without my mind
Climbing out this fucking corner

[Verse]
I was born a thorn away from the rotten petals
A forgotten rebel
Wrapped in the absence of Heaven's heavy hands
To develop an evident level of benevolence
So it's probably better I sold my soul to the Devil
This is a message to anyone I've met that thinks they know me
Don't pretend to understand
None of the issues that I'm holding
I was in a rush to grow up, look, Mom – no cuts
Just a stomach in disgust, and the fearthat I might go nuts
This year, if I don't slow up, I'll see you on my way
One day this shit'll kill me, but I guess that it's OK
I've lost all faith in a world so full of hate
And I don't fucking love music, I just use it to escape
I'm caught between wanting to punch someone in the face
And putting a bullet in my head to leave the human race
Everything takes its toll, but there's no tolls I can take
I haven't yet found a good reason to be awake
Introducing the corroded bones I hide behind my smile
I'm angry at the Universe for the way she treats me now
It keeps me down, stealing all my energy
I'm feeling like my enemy, concealing my identity
Not dealing with my tendencies
I peel the skin and then I squeeze
The real imprinted Hansen's disease
Not healing in this century
I'm kneeling to the entity
Who built this penitentiary's as filthy as a centipede
And guiltless in a sense, ‘cause he
Was willing to just let me bleed while I wore a game face
In 10 years, don't check for me, I'll be in the same place
This planet's just an overpopulated mental hospital
Each zombie walking round constitutes another obstacle
So here it is, I'm finally coming out my shell
All 19 years of my life have been in conflict with myself
I'm insecure about every facet of my existence
From my addictions to the condition I choose to live in
Who you kiddin'? I suffer from excess anxiety
A product of pollution in American society
Stare into my eyes and see the hell that burns inside my mind
And I no longer have an ego I can hide behind
But I've been fine disregarding my insanity
Every form of art isolates you from humanity
But it's provoked against being force fed
So fuck education for a decade and three years
Of headaches from my peers
‘Cause now I realize I could have learned more on my own
They taught me how to know everything except my soul
Which is everything I need to grow
Everything that keeps me whole
Everything that ever meant anything to Eyedea, so
I leap with golden hope to rip the leash that holds my focus
But the fact remains the same, I'm still bound by chains
It doesn't matter if your chain is 10 feet or 100 feet
The fact remains the same, you're still bound by chains
Some people say I've changed and it's harder to relate to me
Good! I never liked you; our friendship was make-believe
I'm peeling the mask back and
Revealing the rap that's been filling my organs
Drilling short distorted portions
Of morbid masochistic torture that unfortunately crafted
An interest to orbit my portrait
And inflict my image with disorder
The minutes get shorter, walls start to close in
Feels like the brain is hanging on by one clothespin
I've hidden in the darkness for too long
I make it look alright, but on the inside it's so wrong
I want life to change, but I don't know if it can
For a man or machine or whatever the fuck I am
[Hook 2]
I stand alone, burned every bridge over the troubled water
No longer hiding from my personality disorder
You want to die my life
Well, come and stay in madness's favorite little corner

[Bridge/Outro]
‘Cause even Shadows have Shadows
And my secrets are eating me
Eagerly feeding to scream my dreams away
But they keep on defeating me
(Even shadows have shadows)
Welcome to the dusty subconscious of an actor
Who murdered his childhood to stop the audience's laughter
(Even shadows have shadows)
How am I to break free from my fears
When I don't like what I see and I can't feel what I hear?
(Even shadows have shadows)
So don't judge my book by its cover
‘Cause my story's just as fucked up as any other"
Smile,Eyedea & Abilities,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
A prince in practice moans for the attention that he wants
But most of this town won't even
Dignify his ignorance with a response
Left to a crowded foster home by a 15-year-old mom
Never been held in anyone's arms
When you've never been moved it's really hard to move on
A young saleswoman sets up shop when the sun sets
She'll make your wildest dreams come true
At a price you won't forget
The sadly-married set up alibis: no harm, no regret
Hoping they meet an angel in bed
That could wrestle the devil right out of their heads
This city runs fast, no one has time to sit with themselves
No time to look into our pain
Or see the same despair in everyone else
It's here, it's there, it's everywhere
Tears soak each card the dealers dealt
But time taught me how to see every second as Heaven
Even though they're perfectly disguised as Hell
And I refuse to let past bruises cover the light
It ain't all good, but it's all good enough, so I know I'm alright
Agony is truth, it's our connection to the living
I accept it as perfection and keep on existing in the now
[Hook]
I can only build if I tear the walls down
Even if it breaks me, I won't let it make me frown
I'm falling, but no matter how hard I hit the ground
…I'll still smile
I can only build if I tear the walls down
Even if it breaks me, I won't let it make me frown
I'm falling, but no matter how hard I hit the ground
…I'll still smile

[Verse 2]
Ear-to-ear, as if that's all I'm here for
Despite the wars founded by the rich, funded by the poor
Kids barely 18 are dying so billionaires can make more
Elsewhere hungry mothers watch their babies starve to death
In a beat-up shack on a dirt floor
The aged professor quotes, ""Freedom's without a path.""
Now he dresses like a widow
And preaches ""Love is dead"" in every class
But curiosity killed the cat and taught the dog in him how to act
And it burned his bridge to Jill
So he tries to drown the guilt with a bottle of Jack
Self-proclaimed rebels say, ""We must oppose the system!""
""You gotta take a stand; if you're not against 'em, you're with 'em!""
Signs read: ""Support the troops!""
""Bring 'em home!"" ""No more innocent victims!""
But when a homeless veteran asks for spare change
You're too busy protesting to even listen
And I'm no different, I live in conflict and contradiction
But it can be so beautiful when I don't reject what lies within
It's beautiful the way agony connects us to the living
I think of the world when I hurt and keep on existing in the now
[Hook]
I can only build if I tear the walls down
Even if it breaks me, I won't let it make me frown
I'm falling, but no matter how hard I hit the ground
…I'll still smile
I can only build if I tear the walls down
Even if it breaks me, I won't let it make me frown
I'm falling, but no matter how hard I hit the ground
…I'll still smile"
Just Begun Freestyle,Salud,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","I'm sharper than the cinnamon
Fresher than the peppermint
Hotter than the hottest of the spices on the continent
Accurate assassinship like laser points from missile rigs
Aiming for the dot within the dot to show my marksmanship
Grilling these pedestrians with Iron-hot passages
My genesis is eminent your awards are irrelevant
A catalogue of lotto picks
Every song's a winner's check
Consistent to consistence and every song sounds different
Mission is the intellect
Business what the heart reflects
Futuristic rhetoric with prehistoric sentiments
Verses of a heretic enslaved to establishment
Stole their flag and I'm spitting crazy off the battlements
Turning soldiers Benedict
History's gone lunatic
Slanderous and hazardous but that's why I got into it
Crisp penmanship so you can read my existence
Words deep like the crater
Seep through the paper
Author and creator with the sword of the invader
This is the wack rapper slayer with decapitating flair
Leave your head in your hands like a Sunday prayer
Thin-haired, been-there's
Ballooned with hot air
Overnight y'all went from rappers to writing them Jason Blairs
Politicians, journalists, now rappers spinning the truth?
Spinning plates, spinning plates without a care for the food
Without a care for the dude with hunger in his belly
Microwave music made for the celly
...
This is that static
Intermission sponsored by the voice
In your brain, in your heart, in your soul it's that noise
That's asking for the better
Something more clever
Something with balance and a little more endeavor
So when you hear then rappers talking swagger
Lambos, prop dope and chains for the flashers
Just remember who masters
And who works for masters
And they'll soon be running out the back with the passport
Ferocious beauty leave you on your toes like dancer
Black swan, prance on, so many people lashed on
So many people battered and bruised - Williams Ashed on
The word to pass on
This schooling is a class one
The beat drops another silent wave and I blast off
Yea, and then I blast off
And now I'm gone

VRP's, SB's, matchin' shirt, maybe
White T, Neck V, glasses are Versace
Married to the mob, but I'm a bachelor baby
Love is in the air, I put on a Gas Mask
I rather be headfirst than the ass last
I'm a Gorilla, call me Sasquatch
And I keep my army with me like M.A.S.H
Light up the purp, pass it like Steve Nash

Young Money boy, I'm on '03 cash
Such a CEO, like my homie D-Dash
Gas, we mash like Pac and the outlaws
And we stand-up, and try not to down-fall
Tryin' to reach my goal, like a round-ball

Enough holding back the steam, Em let off a magazine
Dapper Don, Cap' of Queens, mixed in with Cashis creams
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Telling ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'ma fucking G?
I'm all automatic when I'm at it, start static and you splattered
Shit shattered, I'ma walking bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it, live it always to the limit, limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits you dig it?
Me I'm from the street, street
We ain't nothing sweet, sweet
The home of the homies
There's a body every week, week
Now I don't hear the sirens
But they probably gonna creep, creep
Plotting to pull me over
Plant the- in my jeep
So I'll be skipping cities, seven states in a week
For the wolves follow rules
Don't get moved by the two's blood'll ooze on your shoes
Wait, control your hate, you ain't ridin' in them sixes
Cause you spendin' all your on them bitches

And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem
You stayin' wit me
Don't let me lose you

When I let loose wit this uzi
And just shoot through you Isuzu
You get the message
Am I gettin' through to you
You know what's comin'
You motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some BIG and some PAC
And you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top
What the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers
Tied up in a knot
The Juggernauts of this rap shit
Like it or not
It's like a fight to the top
Just to see who die for the spot
You put your life in this
Nothin' like surviving a shot
Y'all know what time it is
Soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats
'Cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds
Away from the towers
Them cowards fucked with the wrong building
They meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children
It's Nuclear showers there's nothin' spookier
You're now about to witness the power

Heartsprings,Heiruspecs,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Gold and crimson tinged, flittering leaves litter the streets
Sitting beneath the trees, she sleeps innocently
Didn't believe that a being so beautiful flew this low
Using slumber to stun others with features almost musical
And when her low notes, my soul hopes for something more than friendly
When her golden notes hit other folks, I feel close to envy
I'd never wake her, but if the slumber ever ceases
I would rouse her with my kisses and tussle with her demons
Seemingly familiar even though I know I've never met her
Like I send a dream in a letter to heaven and it sent her
Went
Word
Sent word to others
There's a lover, never met, yet she's sleeping in my covers
There ain't no others, count the rubbers up to prove it
Don't want to be the nuisance always asking, ""Wanna do it?""
I'd run through it
Shoot, my lingua's always fluent
And even if our paths don't cross, I know our wants are congruent
So pursue it incessantly
Her exceptional essence and presence is testing my sensory, incessantly
Does destiny beckon me to set next to thee, indefinitely
""Yes,"" says the memories, incessantly
Then with the best of me, let it be
To quest for the recipe
To wrestle the delicate thread imbedded in the chest of she
So string-heart heads to me
Yes indeed
Let's proceed
Sensibly, in depth, pensively, yet intensely
She made my heartsprings stretch screams like guitar string-fret swing sets
Yet she still left when chills crept through the treble clefs
Better get another pump bolted in, it broke again
It's housings are rusted, it's only tin

June '93, rock-a-bye baby
Waking up out of the tree
Was she smiling at me?
(Who?)
Me with the hat back, knapsack, no tact
Told her I watched her sleep and read her my amorous raps
She loved that, a pleasant surprise
Then she went with whatever like a drink and some fries
All right Ms. Honey B. Devine
She offered me a ride, and yet we ended up talking all night
The reason why
You know the steelo
Summer of the Skee-o, the way a brother speak low
Yo, I'm not endorsing no reckless endangering
But I ran out of condoms like a modern Wilt Chamberlain
Check the hussle
Send a shrug towards the struggle
Listerine and Al Green to squeeze a fuck out of a cuddle
But stuck out of the huddle whenever my friends swoop through
I say, ""You're barking up the wrong tree""
They say, ""She duped you""
Who, you mean my boo?
You're just mad 'cuz she don't like you
Snapping at what I have, that's the damage of spite, fool
Take a bite, dude
You ain't even got the plums that I do
Go write a haiku and talk about all that's inside you
Boy, was I cool
'Til the lightning strike split the divining tool that led my eyes to
The tree of life inside of you
It withered and died too soon
A little each time you pruned the beautiful side of truth by lying about
Who else was laying beside you"

Can't be too wide open, there's nothing I won't do

Saying I just want what I can't have
Won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shorty if you only knew, this is serious

Uh, I wish I wasn't famous
I wish I was still in school
So that I could have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you, crazy

Poor Georgie,MC Lyte,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
I met him in a club hangin' out one night
He said, ""Hello, I'm George...hi, Lyte
How's everything going, huh? How ya doin'?
Hope everything's fine, ooh, and uh umm
Can I call you sometime? Can I get the digits?
And the address, so I can come visit?""
I gave him the digits, that wasn't a problem
'Cause if he caused any, I would have to solve them
'Cause George looked good, MMM, damn good!
And if I didn't, some other girl would
In my mind, I hope for the best
Convincing myself that this was not a test
'Cause I heard many things about Georgie
Nothing kinky, like no orgies
I heard he knows how to make love
Like an angel from the heaven above
Who was I kidding I'd give him a try
'Cause Lyte needs love too and that ain't no lie
Keep your ears open, hope that you listenin'
'Cause I'm about to take you on a George Porgie mission
""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is empty without you, babe""
""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is empty...""

[Verse 2]
I gave him the number, I saw it in his eyes
""She gave me the number? Hmmm I'm surprised""
Good conversation over the phone
He began to comfort me whenever I was alone
George was sweet, so nice and so neat
With any other guy he didn't have to compete
George was mature, he made sure
That he was the only man I'd ever adore
Girls, have you, ever had a friend
That you'd get with, every now and then?
I know for a fact George had a lot of girls
Spread out from state from state around the world
As long as he was smart and kept his girls in check
Made sure I never saw them and showed me respect
He didn't have to be loyal, like men should be
I don't care about the other girls, just be good to me!
But if I ever saw one, that would be the end
He couldn't kick the storyline that she was just a friend
The girls I didn't care if her ass don't lie
See 'cause Georgie was into making young girls cry
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""

""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is empty without you, babe""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is...""
""Kissed the girls and...""

[Verse 3]
George was clean, no drugs and such
But once in a while, he'd drink too much
Hangin' in a club where they play rockers
Him and his friend, drinkin' vodka
I was looking for him, and I found him there
With his clothes messed up and his (fucked) up hair
I told him he was messin' up, he wouldn't go far
He got mad and asked his friend for the keys to the car
I said, ""Don't drive, use your head
Drive while you're drunk and you'll kill yourself dead""
We begin to argue, bad words were said
Then he got kicked out by some long-haired dread
Ran into the car as if, in a hurry
He started the car but his vision was blurry
He didn't care, he drove off into the night
Riding for miles, without his headlights
Georgie Porgie had too much on his mind
He was still young yet running out of time
Last week he took tests and the doctor told him
George had cancer in his lungs and his colon
See when he was twelve, he started smokin'
Paid no attention when he started chokin'
Thoughts flashed through his head, there they stuck
'Til Georgie Porgie crashed into a truck
I wished I woulda told him how I liked him so much
How he made me feel with the slightest touch
Now he's gone and I can't tell him nothin'
Wish he was here so I could say somethin'
The story is not to say that I'm in sorrow
Just to say no one is promised tomorrow
If you love someone you should say it often
You'll never know when they'll be layin' in a coffin
Wake up, it's important that you know that
No one on Earth is promised tomorrow...
Believe that! And don't think that it can't happen to you
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""

""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is empty without you, babe""
""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is empty without you, babe""
""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is empty without you, babe""
""Can it be I've stayed away too long""

Make sure the level is tight Ali
Like real tight
Check --

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Yeah, come come now
Soul Brother No. 2, I'm the one now
Sun up to sundown, still kickin' that shit
Put your gun down
I come in peace like a extraterrestrial being
Eat me a meteor and walk across the moon barefeet
But don't nobody rhyme like this no more
Call me the 2010 Rakim
I got soul, there's more in store
Feel like a CVS, open 24
Spent nights tryin' to overshadow my shadow
For niggas tryin' to block my light like a solar eclipse
I bring a knife to a fist fight and when I cut a record
So when I cut the cheese, shit you know what it is
Mr. Absoulutely the most incredible at this
So adjust your bass, your treble and then

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Finna break this blunt down and burn me up one
Then sip on this Remy 'til it turn me up some
For me it's more difficult to be simple
Than it is to be complex as a lot of apartments
You niggas comedy, I'm laughing at you probably
We are not the same, there's no strand of monotony
Between you and I until we die
Revelations say you either fry or fly
And it's hard to find God when you ain't never seen him
It's pie in the sky and there's bodies on the cement
And I know you lookin' at me like, ""You don't speak English""
I bring the heat like a phoenix, a son under Phoenix sun
And I'm rootin' for the Lakers when they play the Phoenix Suns
I ain't really into sports, that's just where I'm from
Long Term Two
And if it's in your possession then follow the directions my dude

So heavy you'll forget every album you heard from Hova
Or 2pacalypse I'm Hub City's novelist
Come and get your scholarship, I'm taking kids to school
A pool full of spit, dive in, I'm 'bout to drool
You'll drown trynna backstroke on concepts that I wrote
I was a black sheep, but now I'm just a goat
And I'm 'bout to elope, married to the game joe
This is hip hop at its finest, where'd you find this? In a Ziploc
Til the wheels fall off, fuck a pit-stop or what not
Where my tear drop? I murdered it
My pot-holes is turbulence
I'm in the sky wit it
When you listening to Kendrick, just
[Hook]
Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Turn me up some, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Turn me up some, turn me up some

[Verse 4: Ab-Soul]
This for my niggas that really rap all night
No sleep, do it with your eyes closed
I can see your vision from Del-Amo
Poppa took the television, but left the radio
Ill niggas, wack niggas, what's the ratio?
Is this shit degrading or inspirational?
I'll have you know I must've wrote about a thousand rhymes, a thousand times
I give you my word

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Cause I just gotta be heard
I just gotta be heard
I just gotta be heard
Said I gotta be, yes sir I gotta be
Heard, heard, heard, heard

[Hook]
Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Turn me up some, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Turn me up some, turn me up some"
Things Get Worse,B.o.B,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus 1: Eminem]
There’s no need to say shit, you already know
The question is just how far will this go?
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man, I done told you once homie to ease up
But you just won’t listen will ya? Nah, I guess not
You just can’t can ya? Man, I can’t stand ya
You’re rotten, what you plottin’ for us?
Man, when are you gonna let up?
I guess things are gonna get much worse ‘fore they get better

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Holy Toledo, it’s Angelina Jolie, amigo
She told me ""Yo, Shady just hand your penis to me, I’ll deep throat,""
And Brad if you try to stand between us then we’re gonna see, bro
Who was a fantasy, I don’t mean to damage your ego
You faggots wanna 'rassle?
I shove a fucking jar of Vaseline up inside your asshole
And rope it shut with a lasso
Couple of crushed Lexapro broken up with the capsule or Paxil
Just in case I ain't dope enough with the raps, though
Coke is cut with tobacco, smoke it up, then go wacko
This is what happens when you mix a coconut with Tabasco
Shady let go, the ho has been choked enough, let her ass go
Not till Jessica Simpson lets go of the tuna casserole
'Cause I used to love her hooters now Carmen Electra's cuter
Strap an extension cord to her arm and electrocute her
I’m off my fucking meds, but I’m on an electric scooter
I might just scoot by and shoot my mom in the neck with rugers
Spit in Jason's face while I vomit on Freddy Krueger
They can’t even get Jeffrey Dahmer to pet the cougar
Now I’m gone get the rectal thermometer, get the lubra-
Cation and get the patient some Darvocet to chew 'cause...
[Hook 2: Eminem & B.o.B]
There’s no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
B.o.B I done told you once homie to easy up, jeez
There’s no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
Cause I will never lay down
And I will never let up
I guess things are gonna get much worse ‘fore they get better

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
With the soul of a Shaman
I'll eat a beat then vomit
Like a bulimic woman with an uneasy stomach
I pass by people on the street they seem like sheep and zombies
Stiffer than a therapeutic pair of jeans you run in
So can you hear me coming
Eminem this beat is absolutely disgusting
It’s probably got diseases on it
I’m just being honest, I can see the comments
I can see the evolution as we creep up on it
I put that music in your veins like a needle junkie
Shit I just do this for the haters, I don't need the money
I'm diarrhea on the track so it needs plunging
Somebody please tell these girls to release my undies
Nobody really understands my language
I find it complicated just to hold a conversation
But still I got a whole lot of patience
Sittin’ back watching Earth from my Space station
[Chorus 1: Eminem]
There’s no need to say shit, you already know
The question is just how far will this go?
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man, I done told you once homie to ease up
But you just won’t listen will ya? Nah, I guess not
You just can’t can ya? Man, I can’t stand ya
You’re rotten, what you plottin’ for us?
Man, when are you gonna let up?
I guess things are gonna get much worse ‘fore they get better

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Oh my gosh I put Natasha Bedingfield in a washer
Watch it go from rinse to spin cycle
It's like I got ya hypnotized and I forgot ya
My God, ya psychologically fucked
Michael would like an apology, what?
Tell that psycho to stick a Tyco truck and a white tricycle up his butt
And glue the seat of bicycle to his nuts
I’m as cold as a muthafucking icicle i'm a nut
I ain't nuttin’ nice, man I like to pull knives and I like to cut
The poster addict for post traumatic stress
I guess this is the most dramatic I’ve been in a while
This is the closest that it's come to the Marshall Mathers
I can hear him start to gather
I don’t paint the portrait of the picture perfect Partridge family
This ain't your orphan Annie, no this is more uncanny
Kick down Dakota Fanning's front door while the whore is tanning
(""He can’t say whore""), of course he can, man he just saw her fanny
Then murdered her while he danced around the room and wore her panties
[Chorus 1: Eminem]
There’s no need to say shit, you already know
The question is just how far will this go?
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man, I done told you once homie to ease up
But you just won’t listen will ya? Nah, I guess not
You just can’t can ya? Man, I can’t stand ya

Going Away,K'naan,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Nelly: I saw you yesterday, your eyes all a-glazed, oh no
Was it too much for you to take?
Did you want the pain to go away?

K'naan: Yeah, I'll take it

I knew I had to leave that trash on my sleeves;
Got caught up in the streets
I couldn't really breath
Oh, no {Oh, no}
So, then I took a gun
Looked up into the sun
The tears began to run
Remembered when I was little one (Oh, no)

That day, the mist in the morning
Made me feel like I was alone and
My soul in-a started swelling
Was it you, behind me, calling?
That day, the mist in the morning
Made me feel like I was alone and
My soul in-a started swelling
Was it you, behind me, calling?
Together:
Are you going away? Are you going away?
Are you going away? Are you going away?

Nelly: Remember?

K'naan: Remember there was that one summer you went away to school?
Nelly: My parents got a new job and I had to change schools
K'naan: And there was that one time you went away to camp?
Nelly: Letters everyday until I got back

K'naan: But, you said 'I'll keep in touch' but my life got too rough
Nelly: You were always so touched
K'naan: Well, I guess I had enough

Nelly: That day, in the misty morning
Was it you, behind me, calling?
Remember when we used to swing in the lawn and
Sing that song 'till one of us would fall

Together: Lalalalala, etc

Are you going away? Are you going away?
Are you going away? Are you going away?
Are you going away? Are you going away?
Are you going away? Are you going away?
Are you going away? Are you going away?
I think I saw you on the bus today
I think I felt you in the wind today
I think I saw you in the street today
I think I felt you in the trees today
I think I felt you in the rain today
I think I saw you in the grocery store
I saw you in the back of the cab
I saw in the back of that cab

Anyways, guess I'm going away
Guess I'm going away (Bye bye)
Guess I'm going away

[Chorus]
Just a crush on a beautiful girl, named Jane
J to the A to the N to the E
Just a crush on a beautiful girl, named Jane
J to the A to the N to the E

[Verse 1: Natti]
I tried to stay all the way playa when it came to game
But got benched in a sense when it came to Jane
I can't explain the deep breaths that I take in her presence
Found recollections connect to every ounce of her essence
I love her, til she join with the air up above her
Love so strong it can't be wrong for her to share with another
Long as she touch my lips and my fingers, fuck it, we swingers
'Cause it's Jane that keeps me sane
For what the world gonna bring us
Can make a blind man see and forget his doctor's appointment
For her sheer enjoyment I'll even risk unemployment
Can it be? Her first name changed to Calamity
Cause if saw by the law in my car, they grabbing me
Harrassing me, asking me 'where did she come from?'
Have me see a counselor asking questions thats plumb dumb
Trying to steal my love, so now I'm constantly taking shit
Cause now three times a week they wanna test our relationship
Shit!

Gone off that mary jane

Gone off that sexy damn Jane

Yeah, spread them legs jane, I need a head change
Coochie hairs flame colored, sweet lil red thangs
She riddles every area of my brain with deep tickles
Mary, married her, carries my pain? Nope
An angel came to me one night chillin'
Said: ""I won't change you, just tame who's within that Villian""
I said: ""Cool, lets lay up with the stars for a minute""
Next I know we break up roaches from cigars
We done finished
Jane doing things that made me search my soul
I's a young one, she's an old freak that cuts slow
Leave her? Right now you got a hellafied no
I guess I needs her, that double edged ledge cuts throats
I love the please-her, or pleasure, whatever call it liesure
You call her a crutch, y'all hush, I call her 'Retha
Undressin her, loving the resin upon fingertips
Its over when I roll me a Fat Lady
Now sing it, bitch

You say ""one for the treble, two for the time""
Come on, y'all, let's rock this!
You say ""one for the treble, two for the time""
Come on!
Speech is my hammer, bang the world into shape
Now let it fall, (huh!)

[Verse 1]
My restlessness is my nemesis
It's hard to really chill and sit still, committed to page
I write a rhyme, sometimes won't finish for days
Scrutinize my literature from the large to the miniature
I mathematically add-minister, subtract the wack
Selector, wheel it back, I'm feeling that
From the core to the perimeter black
You know the motto, stay fluid even in staccato (Mos Def)
Full blooded, full throttle
Breathe deep inside the drum hollow... There's the hum
Young man, where you from? Brooklyn number one!
Native son, speaking in the native tongue
I got my eyes on tomorrow (there it is)
While you still tryin to find where it is
I'm on the Ave where it lives and dies, violently but silently
Shine so vibrantly that eyes squint to catch a glimpse
Embrace the bass with my dark ink fingertips
Used to speak the King's En-ga-lish
But caught a rash on my lips, so now my chat just like dis
Long range from the base-line (swish)
Move like an apparition, low to the ground with ammunition
(Chi-chi-pow) Move from the gate, voice cued
On your tape, putting food on your plate
Many crews can relate, who choosing your fate (yo)
We went from picking cotton
To chain gang line chopping, to Be-Bopping, to Hip-Hopping
Blues people got the blue chip stock option
Invisible man, got the whole world watching
(Where ya at?) I'm high, low, east, west, all over your map
I'm getting big props, with this thing called hip hop
Where you can either get paid or get shot
When your product in stock, the fair-weather friends flock
When your chart position drop, then the phone calls....
Chill for a minute, let's see who else hot, snatch your shelf spot
Don't gas yourself, akh'
The industry just a better built cell block
A long way from the shell tops
And the bells that L rocked (rock, rock, rock, rock...)
[Scratching]
The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock

[Verse 2]
Hip Hop is prosecution evidence
An out of court settlement, ad space for liquor
Sick without benefits (hungh!) Luxury tenements
Choking the skyline, it's low life getting tree-top high
It is a back water remedy
Bitter and tender memory, a class E felony
Facing the death penalty (hungh!)
Stimulant and sedative, original repetitive
Violently competitive, a school unaccredited
The break beats you get broken with on time and inappropriate
Hip Hop went from selling crack to smoking it
Medicine for loneliness remind me of Thelonius and Dizzy
Propers to B-Boys getting busy
The war-time snap shot, the working man's jack-pot
A two dollar snack box sold beneath the crack spot
Olympic sponsor of the black Glock
Gold medalist in the back shot
From the sovereign state of the have-nots
Where farmers have trouble with cash crops (woooo)
It's all-city like Phase 2
Hip Hop will simply amaze you, praise you, pay you
Do whatever you say do, but, black, it can't save you"
Youre My Type,Kanye West,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro:]
This one for my baller niggas
That hate when the weakest ho in the club try to approach him
Some songs the ladies love me
The girls gon' hate me for this one
But I gotta do it
Come on

Bitch, do I look like your type?
Don't get me wrong, you still gotta look cool to me
Bitch, do I look like your type?

She asked
Is that pronounced N-Y-C?
No, that's a niche
Rock Clavin Klein
So she can see K
I'm still doing 120 on the freeway
She still got a prom picture in her key-chain
I told her look
This ain't high school no more
I'm tryin'a fuck being cool no more
So niggas go ball
Just to perform
Cause all these rats be talking up a storm
I know what they worn
I know what they be liking
If they hair short
Said ""They probably be dyking'""
Probably a drying
Probably you like it
I can't know what
You're probably a psychic
I know a crazy bitch by the look in her eyes
I know a cheating bitch gonna look at my guys
I know a fat bitch gonna look at them fries
Tell me on the side like
""Can I supersize?""
Got my meat in my ride
Go down while I drive
Some hoes ain't for show
You just keep 'em inside
Call 'em at 3 AM and get deep up inside
Blow me and my homie, when you see me you don't know me
You heard?

Rock the jeans above the knees

Urp!
Bitch please
Your girlfriend ain't tell you 'bout me
Kanye fuck 'em and leave 'em
Act like he don't need 'em
See titties and squeeze 'em
For no fucking reason
""Ugh, he's so classless grabbing asses
How would you do a nerd bitch with glasses""?
Pimp nigga never spent no dough on a booty
I wish I would take this fat hoe to the movies
Them niggas must not know the price of the Coogi
I'ma little too rich to fuck this broke bitch
The survey says: ""By the streets according
Kanye more important than Michael Jordan
Got this rap game locked, you could call the warden
Give hoes cock then I'm gone by morning

Damn I was wrong..how could I stoop so low?
Pull up in a four door volvo
Dropped the top and swooped yo hoe
Woah..oh no
I don't want no wild body bitch in my wild body 6
No fucking weak hoes in my fucking Regal
No bitch that's whack in my Cadillac
No bitch with a fade in my Escalade
No sluts with a gut in my Beamer truck
No ? in my gold Jaguar
Deep voice bitches like ""{vocalizes deep murmurings}""
""I never thought Kanye would take it this far!""

Remember back in high school?
Like prom queen, right?
She was like 37-25-36
Now she 37 with 25 kids
Ya' know what I'm sayin?
Now she on the come up
Tryna get a baller nigga
Bitch heard my song on the radio
She heard me on the Jagged Edge shit
Memorized my cell phone number out the blue

Uh look, I'm bold from the get go, go by the title of Drake
And treating me like the rest is a vital mistake
I'm hopin that ain't nobody else as special as you
When I say I've been disappointed I'm addressing a few
I finesse then I groove
While most of the 8 to 9's in my past
Now get a rating thats less than a 2
Its true, I been talking to Aleshia, Keisha and Nadia
And Shadia, had to throw peace signs to a lot of ya's
Payback, to the same chicks from way back
Never call, now they wanna be where I stays at
Now they got the new boy, I'm trying to move forward
And pass me, classy, something like Drew Lord
A new me, cool, see I never get around
If I dont change now I dont think I'll ever settle down
Even if I gotta travel a bit
I'll go around the world and back
Cause I know that once I have it thats it and uh

Hard as these niggas working man
They won't sign so

I take it you know that
You take it sitting down
Or you can take it to gold black
And since Drake done took it from curls to waves
Its been kind of like a whirlwind phase
I mean I had my share of women
Now a nigga gettin' girls for days
With most of 'em its seemin' like they world is staged
But from Georgia to BK and all around the world
Get your hands in the air if your avoiding the cliche
If you've been hurt and you alone be steady
These the same dudes from rewind, grown and ready, and uh
(Yea; uh)
You can just love me like they do

Look theres requirements to be an admirer
Still the new version of fresh needa a Nia or Tyra
So we can be Jenny and Swayze
I told you I'm careful with my heart girl, many have played me
Or maybe it's karma
They say is a charmer
Halfway to a knight so I stay in a armor
I'm fire on the move
A tire looking smooth
I'm not perfect but I got a desire to improve
I'm special
Like kids in a graduating class
Having more trouble than others when adding basic math
Need you to be special like areba to cootmore
Double O, top secret agents with suits on
Something so deep it da drown me
Friends are some cool dudes
I vouch for the people around me
On your end its simple
All you have to do

Memories play back like film
I flash back we was little niggas living most real
1989's when we first met
We first clicked over convo gettin twisted
In dun gram earth crib cutting outta school
Watching cable it seemed like the over day
Through the eyes of a stranger we was kids
But in our own minds we was grown mens
Outside on the block we would play the bench
And y'all play the rock every chance y'all got
As I sat back and just watched
Hey, what can I say?
The same back then as I am today
I can recall me, Jamil and Jamal
In the room drinking straight vodka with they moms
When I walk home with the big nefertiti charm
Back with the light blue camoflauge suit god
Me and Hav' doing it hard trying to get on
We sample songs on the box with record and pause
Killa B didn't even get his first firearm
And I was still holding one shot derringers
[Chorus]
Who would think anyone of us would cease to exist
Left with just thoughts of the past to reminisce
Sometimes I see a chick walking past with ya kids
Or find an old flicka of some 1-2-fifth
All the shit that we been through it boils to this?
Dun, I wish we could start it all over again

[Verse 2]
95 we on top touring the states
A lotta times we even took the click overseas
Came along way from the hallway
Sitting in the staircase with bacardi
Bring the honeycomb speaker outside to bang
While we would share drinks with the other that came
Triple L stayed taking they cash in dice games
Killa Black grew to keep an ice grill, dun was not playin'
Yammy, the most infamous told me one day
'Put the bogies down 'fore I pound you out P'
But it was all love, we was each others duns
We held each other down, borrowed each other guns
Its hard to believe that niggas so strong
Could die so easily forever be gone
I could still feel the wet of your palm against mine
Cause we did our hand shake all the time
Why it have to be your time to go and not mines?
Spilled tears contemplating to my delf cryin'
All the laughs we shared and fights we had
All the nights we would get nice, damn
Plates of food we split in half
I dedicate the rest of my life to all my niggas that passed
[Chorus]
Who would think anyone of us would cease to exist
Left with just thoughts of the past to reminisce
Sometimes I see a chick walking past with ya kids
Or find an old flicka of some 1-2-fifth
All the shit that we been through it boils to this?
Dun, I wish we could start it all over again

The question remains who am I when I'm spittin'?
It's me, the MC, I ain't no new edition
My mind's a coliseum, I spit diamonds that glisten
The beat is my journal where these lines will get written
Been through the garden, ate the fruit that's forbidden
So back the fuck up when I'm removin' my fitted
You could never walk in these shoes you don't fit in
Y'all all say your hot but that is just your opinion
Y'all can all die in the spot that you sit in
A.O.T.P., the underground has risen
[Hook] [Planetary]
All we do is pray till the game come back
That's why we sitting here building, spitting flame on tracks
(So what you say) don't matter at all
So we gon' sit here and wait till God answer the call
All we do is pray till the game come back
That's why we sitting here building, spitting flame on tracks
(So what you say) don't matter at all
So we gon' sit here and wait till God answer the call

[Verse Two] [Esoteric]
It's such a pity
Ain't nothing pretty
Lyrics bury cats under 150 tons of scum in the city
You say you poppin' bottles and stunnin' like Diddy?
But your pockets be flatter than a models stomach and tittes
While you frontin' like you rugged an gritty
Why I spit it so hot
Why I like Big L and Big Pun more than Biggie and Pac
I'm from that late 90's era where the Polo wasn't jig enough
A Gucci and Louie and Prada shit wasn't big enough
I would spit it ridiculous, stay on point like Rondo
Y'all bring up the rear like a J-Lo convo
No they don't want no beef, they all want their teeth
I may go Bronco, so lay low pronto chief
Four albums in a year, that's more than in your whole career
They all bang, battle?
I do more than end your whole career
So severe, beat you with a foldin' chair, listen
A.O.T.P.'s what the games missin'
[Hook] [Planetary]
(All we do is spray) Till the game come back
That's why we sittin' here building, spittin' flame on tracks
(So what you say) Don't matter at all
So we gon' sit here and wait till God answer the call
All we do is pray till the game come back
That's why we sitting here building, spitting flame on tracks
(So what you say) don't matter at all
So we gon' sit here and wait till God answer the call

[Verse Three] [Celph Titled]
Yo, yeah
Paper money?
No, I wanna see that iron buck
They be robbin' hoods, so I keep that fryer tucked
Try to have these props taken from me?
You end up red and blue like a female cop on they monthly
Dumpin' student body's in front of the student body, air em out
Beacon on my radar tellin' me where's ya whereabouts? (where?)
Magazine drums, have ya head bobbin'
Dead body nonstop noddin' downhill in a toboggan
Shoot the Uz through ya house in Honolulu (Ooh wow)
I'll throw a pineapple grenade at ya, (Luau)
Am I conceited? Oh yeah best believe it
Rap supervisor, pop up on lawns with fire arms
True surpriser
You'll be rockin an upside-down visor
And it won't be a wack fashion trend neither
More like Suge Knight/Vanilla Ice shit, hotel balcony danglin'
My monsoon is Tom Cruise Valkyrie famous
[Hook] [Planetary]
(All we do is spray) till the game come back
That's why we sittin' here building, spittin' flame on tracks

Cookin Keys,Army of the Pharaohs,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Doap Nixon]
I’m in the kitchen cooking up bananas
Cameras on the roofs with the police scanners
By any means I’ma get these papers
Ride with a nigga or catch these vapors
Smooth melodic, cool water with butters on
Got beef with a nigga, save that for another song
Paz on point so he putting his brothers on
Steeze still the same, get you murked by a gutter jawn
Head in the streets cause the whip is spacious
Benz stretched out legs feel like a spaceship
Checks ain’t clear, I’m hitting y’all with the facts
If the check never came I’d hit your mom in the cap
Got the streets on smash, kilos on wax
Hundred pack on iTunes trying to make cream back
Yeah, the key’s cooked and the bricks is stove-top
It’s Chef Boyardee flipping nicks on your whole block

[Verse 2: Des Devious]
Yeah, born in the coldest winter, live and I die a sinner
And while I’m here I’m hustling, get paper with my niggas
Last of a dying breed, Pharaoh clique in your section
Before I leave my rest, kiss my Wess, load my weapon
Yeah that’s my right hand man, that fifty cal chrome
Off-safety when I roam, I ain’t never alone
Won’t catch a nigga slipping, won’t catch a nigga dipping
Cause I done mastered my high, you out your mind tripping
Yeah you can come and try, won’t be the smartest move
My bitch’ll pull the hammer and make it do what it do
Hustler, a son of one, bitch I’m a son of one
My money done got right, copped me another gun
[Verse 3: Crypt The Warchild]
These punk bitches get the bozak, the gas face
I feel like Earnhardt in his last race
This last lap in this game, I’ma hit the throttle
Syze, we celebrate new life, hit this bottle
Plan, I think the situation’s getting hairy
We make them say the Our Father and the Hail Mary
Scary how niggas turn Judas, no trust
I take it back to 5-6 when it was only us
Snakes slither in the grass in the killing field
So I maneuver through them by sitting in a bigger wheel
You’s a small time hustler, I’m a bigger deal
And that shit you spill gon’ be the shit that get you killed
Ready for war and I’m in it for the long haul
Throwing a molotov sidearm
Yeah, holding my fort with my pipes drawn
I kill everything when this mic’s on, believe it

[Hook: Demoz]
Ayo, f-u-c-k F-B-I cops and niggas who don’t like my shit
I tell them niggas suck a dirty dick with gonorrhea on the tip
I’m getting money courtesy of your bitch
Nigga it’s the Army of the Pharaohs, we hood American Idols
You don’t like us? You can suck my dick
I got a long rope and an oxy if you feeling suicidal
See that window? Hop out that bitch
[Verse 4: Demoz]
Now if you think you can easily be it then be it but see me not
I’m too heated and weeded to lose it so please be hot
They just fiending to be the most conceited team on the top
I’m leaning to be the most meanest as Biggie and Pac
Man these demons is dreaming like I just grieve for their spot
It’s easy to see they just want to be me cause I’m hot
So fuck my theme and my plot, smoking weed in your rock
And fall dummy to that casket cause they eat at you pop
You can believe it or not, I done sold weed to a cop
Caught a case, banged it and ran back to the fiends on my block
Fiends on my block? That’s logical, my flow is phenomenal
I put a couple dots on your block like dominoes
Red beaming them, I stay with my team and them
I keep four nines in the tuck like Steve and them
Diss my track, I'll diss like that
Cause when you shoot like a free-throw you miss like Shaq

[Verse 5: Planetary]
I’m from Killadelph county, the killers they all surround me
I’m losing my nigga slowly, Poppa Large, I make him proud of me
If you see Nemi then tell your people to see me
I’m here for the take and holding these streets down, believe me
My nigga Balo, I know your halo is platinum
I’ma see you at the gates, I’ll be rocking something ravishing
The Seven Sacraments made for the sacrificial
The baptismal of rap bristle to sacramental
My rap essentials is murder tracks and pencils
Gat utensils is only used for niggas acting simple
My syllable slice niggas like a cesarean
You killable right? I spit bars like a barbarian
[Verse 6: Reef The Lost Cauze]
I never thought I’d see the day hip hop would give birth to faggots
Mr. T mohawks and Urkel glasses, I’m from a hood where they rob cool kids
And I can’t wear skinny jeans cause my Glock’s too big
Yeah, I got the wildest style, death bears a childish smile
Beat you with soap in a sock, you a Private Pyle
I fear order, from green onions I peel quarters
What’s rap? I bump Foghat and Creedence Clearwater
Bad moon rising, I’m howling at the bitch
Haters baffled how he spent a thousand on the kicks
I get thousands just to spit, fuck all the drama shit
I don’t make statements, get bank statements and deposit slips
And it’s always gonna be this way
C-notes like study hall in tenth grade
To this day I fuck bitches and get paid
What’s piff? I got the green monster like Fenway
Mmmkay?

Missing Children,CunninLynguists,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
On my way to find myself again
I have come a long, long ways from home to see

Ha, Braille, a little louder

[Verse 1: Braille]
My last breath echoes through your oxygen supply
You're not fond I've never been who I claim
You can't tame the lion once it breaks out the cage
Once it breaks out, all over my face
Put your brakes on, stop the motion
Robotic movement, rusted by the rain of my father
Two sided, two names
Splashin' water retaliates
Flood to the surface of my lyrical percentage
Verbally aggressive, abusive attendance
Unexplained anger slaps my style senseless
How dare I mention mistakes and intentions?
Another star in my collection
The stars I've collected fell from the sky
I keep fallin', who let my hopes rise?
No parachute to provide safety, take me
Away from this shallow tide, from the shallow minds
The walls keep closin' in, I've opened every door
The hinges always squeak
I need to loosen up, put it all behind me
And if you're searchin', lost is where you'll find me
[Verse 2: Deacon the Villain]
October 27th, 1995
The day I found out my sister was no longer alive
Now I'm the oldest sibling
With her no longer living on this sad day
Decided to give up the bad ways
And to be a model for my younger sister
Wasn't the dumbest (___)
But my education was just car heists, burglary, urban liquor
The sort of fingers being curved on triggers
And I knew for certain, if I continued, living life all simple
Jail would be the only institution I'd be able to get into
So I laced my boots
Hit the books, flip from crook
Hopped over my obstacles like rocks skipped on brooks
Music became my medication
Motivation for meditation
Far better than any prescription my man was makin'
Sometimes my head be shakin'
Wondering how my life would be
If things never changed, then she could be beside me
But I discard the hypothetics
Won't let stress slice my lettuce
Theoretically, she just moved on ahead of me
So now my life's patterned across the same finish line
Live right any part of me, that's insane is put to rhyme
Occasionally flames took to pine
Sometimes looked for wine
When I'm in binds I grab the Holy Book to find
A revelation to raise me out of this mental mess
And remember my life being blessed
Isn't coincidentalness
A simple test we face daily can drive us crazy
Missing Children, the confused adults losin' hope
A noose from rope can dead it
But I won't let it take over me
Got somebody on my soul's shoulder lookin' over me"

All alone when I am gone

Ready to pop you, venomous snakes out the Congo
What through these clear optics
Yo Allah shall watch you
Rap in the coldest winters, strapped with
All sorts of snorkels attached to hoods
That pull over Motorola goggles
We pigeons equipped with talons to twist, split owls
Now watch me skate off the scene with a mongoose
Pop a wheelie and alley-oop
Deuce bottles of frozen bong juice
Smoke bubble gum while munching on Milanos

Blaze emcees, amaze with degrees

In My Lifetime,Lowkey,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: Lowkey]
(In my lifetime)
I learnt life is suffering
And happiness is one thing that money doesn't bring
(In my lifetime)
Our birthright is struggling
It must have been, but no matter what I keep the love within
(In my lifetime)
I've waited for days that didn't come
The battle's over, but the war isn't won
(In my lifetime)
I'll keep fighting until there's none
You rap about things you see while I rap about things I've done

[Verse 1: Lowkey]
(In my lifetime)
I've been around the flipping planet
Welcome to the world though my parents didn't plan it
'86, it was my mum and dad that made me this
Just a baby, I couldn't understand the craziness
Let me take you back when, and run through my history
When Wendy didn't babysit my mum used to sing to me
(In my lifetime)
I learnt the meaning of true love
Sometimes I feel like I've been through too much
(In my lifetime)
I lost battles and won some
Made many mistakes that can never be undone
Carried the same name as a doctor that delivered me
A toddler to a monster, tryna prosper in the industry
So what's your life like? Cause mines a bag of drama
I've seen scenes that Panorama's cameras are after
When I was 13 I saw a man die
Drove his car through that wall, all I could do was stand by
(In my lifetime)
I've shed so many tears
I've written so many rhymes over these years
By 20 I did more than most other British rappers did
I toured Europe, and spat a hundred bars to cannabis
The state of the world, got me thinking militant
But in the grand scheme my life is probably insignificant
I'll be stuck with regrets till nothing is left
Life's a bitch but I'm still tryna love her to death
[Break: Wreth 32]
(In my lifetime)
I don't mind if I ain't going platinum
Cause deep down I know that I made gold anthems
I ain't being no ransom
But I know they'll remember me like Samsung
(In my lifetime)
It's been me, no tantrum
I came on my own and I'll leave no phantom
(In my lifetime)
In my league, I'm a champion
So when I decease they'll scream my anthem

[Verse 2: Wretch 32]
(In my lifetime)
I've seen everything except what I'm living to see
I'm Stevie Wonder, I'm tryna get a vision of me
In the mirror sitting where I'm predicted to be
As a winner that costs but my lyrics are free
I've seen so much over the years
It's been an uphill spiral, just getting close to the stairs
Now I've got a clean shave come over my beard
Now I've got a clean slate cause, there's no more in rears
(In my lifetime)
I like to grime for my chicks, and rhyme for respect
While these other rappers couldn't get in line with my steps
Inside of my head is a mind like Albert Einstein
I'm fly like a falcon outside
Just tryna get to where the outcomes outline
Intake, it's about time that I ditched faith
And if it's about rhymes then I've been great
But that's the downside when your meets end

“Ladies and gentlemen, we are now approaching 35,000 feet
Hope you’re enjoying your ride through Wonderland
I am your flight attendant Boss Lady
Turn your bottles upside down and your blunts in an upright position
And please remain seated until the flight has come to a complete stop
Thanks for flying the friendly skies with your friendly captain Snoop D-O-double-G aka The Homey”"
Biochemical Equation,RZA,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: RZA]
Tempted by the sins of life, the pleasures of lust
With wild imaginings that you can't discuss
Oh, the flesh is weak, it's a struggle for peace
It's a daily conflict between man and beast
We strive for God and a better tomorrow
Still suffering from the unforgettable sorrow
Repent from thy sins, son and walk ye straight
Stop talking all that trash boy and talk ye straight
Afflicted by the pressures of life at every vital point
Still, I wouldn't give an oint'
Or flinch an inch or pitch a pinch
Off the pie or every try to try your wench
Confronted by the devil himself and stay strong
You think you can take the King now meet Kong
Strong as the base of a mountain, there's no counting
How many MCs have sprung from our fountain
Fifty thousand year process to make this combination
I'm not giving mine away to Satan
Although I know that he's awaiting
To get a hold of my biochemical equation
I'ma slip him son, I'ma dip him, son
When I catch the drop on him, I'ma clip him, son
Fifty thousand year process, to make this combination
99 elements, biochemical manifestation
I'm not giving mines away to Satan
Although, I know that he's awaiting
I'ma slip him son, I'ma dip him, son
When I catch the drop on him, I'ma clip him, son
[Verse 2: MF Doom]
Bet ahk, straight to the head with the pet rock
At least til I can get from out this booth, it's like a sweat box
Trade a few bars of head nodding, throw us a stack
Pay him and it's sewed up like thread and bobbin bonus pack
Invest in the first B-boy kid show
Live off skid row with jive talking negros
He wear his beard like a frizzly haired grizzly
And kept his appearances exquisitely rare, where is he?
Is he in the backyard or on your front porch
Or standing in the corner of the club with the blunt torched
You're soft, they say he rhyme like he starving
And sold odds and bodkins to old gods and goblins
Golly, I'm just a pest and your worst best friend
Who mend and rip space-time fabric like polyester blend
Not a hobby for no knobby-kneed lesser men
Or sloppy like the rest of them, they probably need estrogen

[Verse 3: RZA]
Yo, yo, drunk or sober, son, don't lose your composure
Semi off the Remy, mixed with Henny, Moet demi'
Underneath the passenger seat, son, tuck the semi'
Israeli issued automatic black pistol
The cop with the flashlight chew gum as he whistle
Tapped on the glass, roll it down fast
License, registration, address to your lab
They made insurance, the reason why I pulled you over
Cuz the way you were swerving, sir, you can't be sober
Have you been drinking? Breathe into the breathalyzer
Get out the car, please, follow this exercise, sir
Put one finger on your nose, now from heel to toe
Walk in a straight line, ten paces, down the road
My homeboy Kano, used to do the mashed potato
Or cartwheels and then spin out like a tornado
They used to chase him, right; but son, he would always shake em
Then come and puff bowls and make beats inside my basement
Drunk or sober, never lose your composure
Stress on the brain cause pain and stomach ulcers
If you can't understand, then come closer
We civilized the uncivilized like we supposed to
Drunk or sober, never lose your composure
Mic in your hand, black man stand as a soldier
Stress on the brain, cause pain and stomach ulcers
If you can't understand, then come closer"
Most likely to succeed,Charles Hamilton,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Charles Hamilton-Verse 1]
When you get used to lookin' down
Looking up only means you gotta look around
I see the hood around
People don't believe in seeing any good around
Cause they live in the sky, used to lookin' down
Dead bodies, new-born souls
Fire in their heart, add a few more coals
Perhaps the glory of copping a two-door Rolls
Is the reason why some would do a few more shows
And then there is me, using music as my therapy
So I hope you niggas hearin' me
Stare at me, glare at me
Apparently your scared of me
Because the air I breathe
Is everywhere that you ain't prepared to be
I'm never scared of the images that you ain't care to see
Cause if you look, then you'll see what appears to be
Me. Yep, it's me, I'm certain
At least to my dreams I'm more than a person
[Hook]
I heard a voice say
(You're the one)
I asked who it is and it faded away
(Away)
That's how I know that im able to say
Damn, this beat is...
(So dumb right now)
Maybe it's because I had to fend for myself
Build my own wall of defence for myself
But I just want a love that was meant for myself

[Charles Hamilton-Verse 2]
The only reason why I'm second guessing
Is cause I found myself smarter with the second question
So I'm never stressin'
Cause you can replace Smarter
With any positive adjective you can consider harder
First I said fuck stardom, I'ma be a problem
But all of the over thoughts is why I am a starter
The money doesn't do it
But damn if it isn't the grandest incentive on the planet banished in riches
But the damn difference is, every damn sentence is
Me putting my hands in a fist, standing in bliss
Cause I knocked out the killer of my damn innocence
I air it out like a fan in a vent
Ain't nobody stopping me from standing again
I'm a falling baby when I land on a pin
A Jim Carey, ""Cable Guy"", stand with a grin
Obsessed with what I'm blessed with
But will help in a second
[Hook]

[Charles Hamilton-Verse 3)
When I step on the blocks I used to run through
I come to, life is a dream come true
Went from 2-1-2 to 3-1-2
Females that hated sayin, ""Can we come, too?""
You know me, I don't care if they be untrue
You don't get this lonely. Huh, do, you?
It's aight though. With the right dough
And the shine that the spot light show
I might go, into the next phase is psycho. Peaceful
Life of an eagle and flight with the segal
Sky so clear, the night lookin' see-through
Fight through the deep rooted plight that's beneath you
You got the mother fuckin' right to, believe you can say
What you want, on the mic, cause you need too
Reason why? You only write what you see, true?
Look in my eyes, It was nice to meet you

Tell No Lies,Emilio Rojas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Looking at the trouble I’m facing
Facing the crowd while I’m staying on the stage
And the stages I go through in this game are outrageous
And the rules ain’t fair but still, I play it
And at the rate that I’m racing, it’s amazing I ain’t fading
The sun turned me from a grape to a raisin
And folks telling me I made it, please, I ain’t made shit
The soul still need saving and ever since I got up in this game
I’ve been saying to myself one day I'mma change it
‘Cause the clothes and the hoes got you chasing
Ice in the road got you locked up in cages
Keep on the American dream, one day, they’ll gonna barely be sleeping
And it ain’t your fault ‘cause you can barely see it
Stay tuned and I'mma take you to see it

[Hook: Leo]
I know someday, I’m gonna find it all
But I won’t apologize, I won’t tell no lies
Don’t go, someday I’m gonna need you
But I won’t apologize, oh no, tell no lies, oh no
[Verse 2: Emilio Rojas]
Say that nothing worth having is easy and nothing that I worked hard for
That it’d make me want more, I ain’t satisfied, even on the top floor
I’m addicted to living a life that I can’t afford
Working in the store with clothes that I can’t fold it in
Opening and closing it, hoping to get it over with it
And every morning, my shawty waking hung-over which is funny
‘Cause this champagne lifestyle is sobering
I know the rent a little late, I’m hyperventilating
And waiting for the day that I penetrate like a virgin, working it patiently for a taste
When they looking in your wallet, they don’t look you in the face
I’m broken shit, the walls have been closing in
So much that I ain’t notice eviction notices
I’m lying to my friends, I told them my phone is dead
Trying to hold my head, but knowing I’m gonna win

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Emilio Rojas]
Another phone call to my mother looking for help
So she don’t even respond, I only think to myself
Manager paid my rent, my money been looking stealth
But on the outside, it’s looking like something else
So I can’t back track or fall in line
And I’m way passed out for too much time
And I ain’t a cat that can act all fine
Fuck the game, Kat Stacks, I’m cats, all lie
Labels wanna monopoly and the rest that is shopping me
So they copy me, sold my intellectual property
I gotta breathe, I’m worried I’m losing steam
I gotta sleep, I’m worried I’ll lose the dream
So what’s the next move? To seek the successful?
It’s something I’ll be taking to grave like my best suit
The clothes only make the man if they dress you
I’ll be copped down if I’d let you

Wait, you wanna fuckin' drown? Go ahead
Head first in that goddamn river, you're dead
I said that I loved you, heartbeats when you get near
So it's clear why I fucked you (I love you)
X's and O's, you must be the rose
Cause my exes are hoes, and where you gonna go
When you run through my head all day?
And I got a foot fetish, so I probably have sex with your toes
Um, life is a water park, could be fun
I'd swim in your ocean of love
If I had a life jacket cause I'm not that dumb
So next time I come, I'll bring you one
So you don't drown, when you decide to follow
And I'm gonna go deep cause you're not that shallow, right?

See, my mama told me you better finish school
You better not play around, you better play by the rules
I’m thinking like make up your mind mama
‘Cause Nostradamus told me that the world is mine mama
And I’m Latino so it’s either rap or crime mama
And I ain’t into shitty food and gang rape
So Imma make this rap take the stack cake
Give none of it up like a bad date
‘Cause no one wants a son who’s in last place
And I’m that great, stick a fork in these crab cakes
They well done, I’m like Ricky Martin, they like Will Pung
When will the real come? I ain’t fronting, this is real fun
Watching the death of an establishment I hold so dear
‘Cause the kings ain’t talk to the man in the mirror
And they crumble to the ground while the crown in the air
Feeling like a ring leader with these clowns in my ears

[Hook: Blazed]
I been through the struggle and the pain
Trying to reach to the top of the game
If I could change it all, I wouldn’t change a thing
I been through the crisis and the rain
But there ain’t a thing I would change
If I could change it all, I wouldn’t change a thing
[Verse 2: Laws]
I’m going for the gold, save the baton
Make ‘em disappear with a wave of my wand
I don’t gotta dance, I ain’t say the umm
I walk around the stage and it work like a charm
I’m about to blow like a baby in norm
Cradle in the womb through a patriot’s arms, I don’t care if you follow
This is no place for your type baby, I’m trying to take you beyond
Yeah, Hip-Hop needs saving but c’mon, I been preserving since the 80’s and on
So if I take a little vacation and make a real song
Keep your mouth zipped, save me the drawn
I’m not depressed, my life and times made me this calm
I wish I could say nobody hates me
But dick riders seeing how long it’ll take me to cum
If I lash out, you’ll say that I’m as crazy as them
I’m so far removed from the kid that was so innocent
And I probably wouldn’t know him if I bumped into him
It’s lonely at the middle, what’s the top gonna be?
Just ‘cause I signed a paper, you do not own me
I let you get a piece, you like a silent partner
You got something to say but they still ain’t find hoffer
So get your mind right, I’m Laws, no coppers
Leaving the beat wrapped up in gauze, no doctors

[Hook]
[Verse 3: Laws]
Money got my head spinning like a fan blade
I’m feeling cheaper than gift cards that Pam made
And I was better than your best in my sand phase
Whack shit is cool, acceptance is what I can’t take
We need balance, we need a board, you need lyrics
Ha-ha I need applause, you need me to affect you, I need a cause
Besides the broads, my singles sound like money
And my B-sides is broad so be kind to Laws
‘Cause if you start bugging, from the beehive we swarm
On a world tour from Florida to Hoboken
I got these girls ripping off they shirts, no Hogan
And ladies, don’t think that I’ve missed you
‘Cause I’ve forgotten at least ten dimes since you
And I won’t change so when you think about it
Well this is my life, I wouldn’t change a thing about it

Beat in the head while my lyrics drop

Some punish rhymes, I straight abuse it
I'm putting them together for the world's amusement

His lunch on the patient
Barfs during operation
Coming out like a cyborg from a lesser nation
Losing a gallon of blood from the laceration
It's like you're pouring your heart out, O-positive everywhere
You'd think it fictitious as vicious as my vocals blare
Like unicorns or horns on a hare
Dragons breathing fire and eggs with hair
Who could've known saying stupid stuff could make you a millionaire?
Sit in a silver chair and forget how a stuffed duck got there
When'd I buy that junk?
It's not even acquired taste
Must be a gift from the guy I maced
If memory serves me
It doesn't, it completely desserts me
Can't even remember the last line
Something about a duck?
Just my luck
Something else that don't make sense
Like getting a bird and building a fence
What the heck am I saying
Having more blond moments than a room full of Super Saiyans

Shrewd and cynical
Punchlines are plentiful
Like I'm Holyfield

With the holy ghost it's not just a sheet
It's more than paper
It's an ancient scroll where my thoughts can taper
Spew outta my brain like water vapor
Quick like silver cool like quartz
Of nitrogen, stuck in your mind again
Like plastic forks
Spoons, cups, plates, and sporks
I'm versatile
Nothing I say is personal
Non-controversial
Some skills are universal
Not these though got plenty of haters
Maybe I'm small taters
Maybe nobody likes me
That's why there's so much internal conflict inside me
Now I'm being redundant
So easy to do when words come so abundant

Arranger of anger aimed at a mediator

The havoc now will soon be wreaked
Drop it Friday and I'll retaliate that week
Get your Saturday serving
34 minutes and my tip is burning
Whether it's a pencil, pen or quill
Friction burns cause I can't stand still
Fizzin up like root beer
I'm Hemlock with hops
Under the weather and the temperature drops
Cause I left the room
But still feel my presence loom

Get it, abuse it, and what I'm left with is useless
Cause three years in a row, I felt like the world was mine
And three years in a row, I lost it all in the blink of an eye
And I believe what I do'll come back one day
But why am I still losin'? I can't take the pain
Am I to blame? Please excuse me for my rotten ways
I'm just tryin' to do what I gots to do so I get paid
Get down and pray to the souls from up above
And hopefully my guardian angel will show me some love
Forgive me for my sins and all the shit that I did
And hopefully she won't let it reflect onto my kid

[Verse 2 - Crypt The Warchild]
Y'all don't know what it's like bein' born with strikes against you
Only feelin' in this world is the life within you
You'd have to be damn near dead to see the nights I been through
Damn near dead to feel the wind beneath you
Envisionin' so much, my minds an open window
Where I gather all these thoughts for all your broken info
If seein' is believin', then there's more to live fo'
My only reasonin' is breathin' and I live to just hope
What you know about bein' bedside next to your girl
On poison control, IV's cause she can't stand the world?
And what you know about no heat and no electric?
I sold my MP to pay the bills, I'm so pathetic
I wake up and go to work, back aches and my shoulders hurt
And what's it worth? I'm easily checked and don't control my earth
Still walk these hollow grounds, bein' lost but never found
Say to the Lord, ""I'll die for music"", but there's never sound
Screamin' in vain, everything be seemin' the same
Ask my mom, ""What's the problem, why am I feelin' this way?""
Ask my pop, ""Can you solve it?"", this game, I'm bleedin' to stay
More then willing to give it up if I can't live it up
Hand in my clutch, gun in my lap
Doin' a buck and some change, not knowin' where the fuck I'm at
I try to maintain, the pain is unstoppable
Put my son on my back and I maneuver through the obstacles

1988, pops died, middle of the night
Forty-six years old, middle of his life
My mother ain't have a job, poppy was on his grind
And we ain't got no money, so she lose her fuckin' mind
Lenny helped out, and that was real
But he had a little daughter to raise, and that's the deal
My other brother, I won't mention his fuckin' name
Cause he ain't worthy of my bitterness or fuckin' pain
Me and my mother, all we needed was some love
And my brother, all he needed was his drugs
How could you look at us with a job, we was poor
It's your mother birthday, you don't give her a call?
You have two nephews and a beautiful niece
But they don't think of you as Uncle, they think you deceased
I'm so fuckin' mad that I got a slug for you
But Mommy raised me better, I got love for you
[Break - Vinnie Paz] + (Tony Perez)

I'll see you on the street, dog, we gonna handle it
One on one, beat you down and then hug you
Tell you I love you, daddy, but now, fuck you

Mad Axes,Holocaust,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Mad axes...

[Pre-Chorus]
Silver ants and golden beetles crawling throughout my paragraphs
Chief Warcloud to peel a lemon and share a drag
Wu-Tang Clan West Coast, so carry torch
Throwing mad axes, bad apples at dead whores
Throwing mad axes, bad apples at dead whores

[Chorus:]
Throwing mad axes, heavy sawed-off shotty
Old liquid foot, powder foot, chopped up the body
Great Warcloud who cracked you mighty hard
I watch the children chasing chickens off in the yard
Throwing mad axes, heavy sawed-off shotty
Old liquid foot, powder foot, chopped up the body
Great Warcloud who cracked you mighty hard
I watch the children chasing chickens off in the yard

[Verse 1]
I crash through the door and Motorhead through the window
With a heavy pistol, Warcloud the Champion
Victory borns freedom, the Universe can't defeat him
Crash you with the Seagram's, ooh-yah
Chop your head in half with the heavy old sword from all Asia
Sick man amaze ya, dark castle Fantasia
Shot you in the early life, throw your arms in the garbage bin
Records will retard the spin, lay my gats on wax
Slit your belly open and stash a hammer in the back
Warcloud don't play sleepy horse, clack clack
Slumped on a horse with a creepy torch and black gats
If one cannot speak wisdom about his or her culture
Therefore, they cannot deal equality
Barbaric policies, slaughter you in The Odyssey
Crack you like a polly seed, make your organs come out of thee
Shot him barefoot in the dark, he was a tyrant
Fiasco pop violent, I smoke jump like a giant
And escape the deep end, my deadly maze of clues
We smoke motherfuckers like army and navy news
A hall full of dinosaurs heads, hear the best tune
You were mangled by a mad man inside a wet room
Cut you at the knee with the shotgun, it's hurtful
You's like blind fish that swim in lazy circles
Gut 'em so swiftly, fired my Smith & Wesson
He tried to escape but stepped on his own intestine
Throw you in the shredder for pleasure and live to tell
Old war ghost, they cannonball in their well
[Chorus]
Throwing mad axes, heavy sawed-off shotty
Old liquid foot, powder foot, chopped up the body
Great Warcloud who cracked you mighty hard
I watch the children chasing chickens off in the yard
Throwing mad axes, heavy sawed-off shotty
Old liquid foot, powder foot, chopped up the body
Great Warcloud who cracked you mighty hard
I watch the children chasing chickens off in the yard

[Verse 2]
Sunburst, shotgun, drop son and scotch run
Down a dirty staircase, clatter like when the cops come
Warcloud, you punk crews, never started
It's like somebody took human skins and filled them with garbage
You'll find your ass back in the dumpster from heavy gats
Baptism of blood, I'll leave you with flies and gnats
I stalk with a sawed-off shotgun and an axe
All wrapped in bandages, coat was long and black
Spark it in the darkness, bewitch men and hunchback
Shuffle through the portal with cyber gats for asking
School of assassins, stashing your body fragments
Just behind eight big crates we drunk laughing
Heavy swords, axes and hammers are my brigade
I'll cut you men down with the gauge and flip the page
Stumble off the ripple 'cause everyday is New Year's
Sick like the green coyote, I drink a few beers
Lift that brick, grab that gat, painting's in a stack
I bump you and slump you on every track
It's that Warcloud rap, we desperate desperados
Machine junky crunchy with shots to pop the lotto
Swigging dusty bottles, the strongest will sing the longest
Throw you in the hells of hells from marking zombies
Rap creature land, beware mechanical animals
Warcloud stretching the daisies with revolvers
Drunk like thieves, take it just like the breeze
Now look at all the clowns there, sleeping up in the trees
[Chorus]
Throwing mad axes, heavy sawed-off shotty
Old liquid foot, powder foot, chopped up the body
Great Warcloud who cracked you mighty hard
I watch the children chasing chickens off in the yard
Throwing mad axes, heavy sawed-off shotty
Old liquid foot, powder foot, chopped up the body
Great Warcloud who cracked you mighty hard
I watch the children chasing chickens off in the yard

[Verse 3]
It's way past your curfew, I came here to unearth you
Heavy old sword from Jerusalem splatter juice from them
Red Bangladesh murder stupid men, peep my future pen
Here from the roof, but grim records, poet salute the spin
Cave where Medusa went, troops were bent, I shoot the lint
And let loose the hen quite close to where the fruits where rinsed
Fry your brain, roots and grits, Louis spent thy scoops on mince
Pick a zoot suit and then strangle, mangle and slaughter you
Storm drain marauder who meat markets you artists
A large scholastic lesson from Butcher College
Tear your gut open, out gasses, liquids and solids
They'll be astonished how I left the whole place polished
Carry mad knowledge for those who wrestle with concepts
Warcloud, outsiders, wanderers and conquerors
Warriors, angry men, war mongers, barbarians
Holy men, crusaders, face huggers and space truckers
Brake fuckers' backs, your spines were made of Lego
I laugh like a merchant who teeth were made of Play-Doh
Champs send your broad out, I snatched the bitch, bottom jaw out
Hacksaw your leg, it's evening at the raw house
Warcloud, don't play monologue, pleasure ships
Slumped on a horse with a tomahawk and dessert mints
Gallop through snowflakes, test him and catch a broke face
Razor blade tropical snowstorm, that slopes waste
Tatter rappers to form, holy lyrics you torn
Fly like a diamond winged unicorn, beyond the norm
[Chorus]
Throwing mad axes, heavy sawed-off shotty
Old liquid foot, powder foot, chopped up the body
Great Warcloud who cracked you mighty hard
I watch the children chasing chickens off in the yard
Throwing mad axes, heavy sawed-off shotty
Old liquid foot, powder foot, chopped up the body
Great Warcloud who cracked you mighty hard
I watch the children chasing chickens off in the yard

A Prayer for Michael Vick and T.I.,Jay Electronica,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Sample: Minister Farrakhan]
You got a hell of a nerve
If, if my rhetoric is too strident
Who better to correct me than my brothers?
And my sisters?
If I need to be brought in line or refined
Who better to do it than the members of my own family?
We don’t get into your family business
You stay out of ours

[Verse 1]
I never got shook up by talks of Illuminati
I’m from where niggas talk that talk
Then walk around the streets all day
Carrying heat like the human body
Stress – we mastered that
Death – we laugh at that
You niggas sweeter than the cog-ni-ac
I never sleep
And when my eyes is closed, I'm in a deep battle for sheep
I’m an insomniac
But when it comes to the rhymes, a hypochondriac
The flow so sickly, splash a hot round on me
Peel off quickly
Luckily, not one of you niggas could fuck with me
I hit you with a plus degree
Mind detect mind, plus mind detect matter
With that, I say peace to the G.O.'s
And all my niggas locked away in cages, giving shit to the C.O.'s
Doing long stretches on the track
Cause they fell into the trap of the Neos
The Farrakhan of rap, giving dap to the people
Busting shots at the eagle, with the arrows in its talon
Sneaking shots when you peep through your peephole
Spit the abracadabra, manipulate matter with a black magic
Created to eradicate evil
So if they call me a rapper, okay, yeah, I can dig it
But if they bring me before the Congress, then I can kick it
I send the devil to hell every time that I get wicked
Ayah to ayah, sura by sura yeah, I get lifted
[Sample: Muhammad Ali] ""People do say I'm cocky, some say I need a good whoopin', some say... I talk too much, but anything that I say I'm willing to back up... I have fulfilled all of my prophecies, I'm up to date in all of my predictions, my train is running on schedule.""

[Verse 2]
One for the money, two for the pussy and fame
Three hundred’ll go to the court to change my name like Cassius
The past just show me lessons
Stay on my grind and pray that time will show me blessings
Was my old motto
I'm from the Magnolia Projects, where dice rollers and heroin addicts is role models
So I had no choice but to kick it to full throttle
My niggas in Philly'll probably tell you ""the boy’s thorough.""
Now, either you with me or you with me
Cuz even if you against me, running with my enemies
They ain't nothing but mini-mes
That I created long, long ago
And they only want to cut off
My lineage like the Kennedies
That being the case
You should be aware I blast many a face
And left niggas displaced like Katrina did
And gave them very little of nothing like FEMA did
And I ain't never seen a bid
Well, there was one time when me and Ali tussled with one-time
For claiming our sovereignty as a nation and bloodline
You niggas should give a standing ovation
To the MC who stands in the face of Satan
Hitting them with creation"

As we start trudging
Me and my brothers we be looking and be bugging
Vehicles of life they be rolling and be nudging
Searching for the virgins of life
That be shoving out the door that's crack
The valleys of time, are always on my feet
As least the beat will combine
The calluses and corns with the funky bassline
You don't need Underdog for a nickel shoeshine or the shoes that's phat
But can I get a level on the bass and on the treble?
Footing up and down like a UNLV Rebel
The answer be amongst us 'cause we really dig acoustics
Can't be too much flacking, not too much packing
You must container that at least to dip your hand in rap
Your feet will be infectious so at least realize the fact
The rhythms are inserted and the nurse can be converted
This ain't rock 'n' roll 'cause the rap is in control
If you're a megastar, words will buy you a car
I'd rather go barefooting, for prints I will be putting
All over the earth if we can get there first
Now that we are in it, footprints are being printed
So if you recognize 'em, you can try to size 'em
They'll probably be the ones with the size nine flying
All over the field, you won't have to yield
If you want protection you can hide behind the shield
[Interlude: Jesse Jackson]
And the musician often tries to capture the new thing so that we might have melody and have rhythm as we do our thing
It's rough and tough in this ghetto, a lot of funny stuff going down but you got to walk tall. Walk tall!

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
You can game on the gallons if you really need to rock
But we walk while we talk as we stomping through the block
Hand in hand 'cross the land as Muhammad cross the fade
It's a Tribe who meanders, precious like a jade
It's a art, Theo arch rhymes the ground placed upon
The mind will unwind, it will soft to beyond
Catch the track, track by track, get a map to track a trail
You will find yourself behind for a map does not prevail
See the levels peaking as the rhythms keep-a screeching
A Quest, oh yes a Quest, inside the jam I will keep preaching
The point, oh yes the point, because it's close but yet so far
The liveliness is mean as we scoot across the star
We are bulging, I'm indulging in a rat-a-tat-tat
Explanation for the line is that the rhythm is phat
Keep it wild, wide and deep, you could dig it in a Jeep
But dig it in the ground because the footprint now

[Interlude: Jesse Jackson]
Walk tall!

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
If there's a storm that's brewing, it won't keep us from doing
Our thing as we start swinging, travelling is bringing
Joy inside the domes as we hit the road to Rome
A chair is not a chair, a house is not a home
Because my skin is brown, yo I'm gonna do the town
Rub it in the face and rub my feet all through the place
When you get your finger on the music it'll linger
Sing a song o' sixpence, sing it like a singer
A Nubian, a Nubian, a proud one at that
Remember me, the brother who said ""Black is black""
You can come while we Quest, I don't play, I don't jest
Get emotions off your chest, we are Black, we been blessed
Making moves, making motions, flowing like an ocean
The walking will continue, we know that we will bring you
The times that you have waited, more anticipated
Be gone but not for long because the feet will stay strong"

Ten after one I think I'll hop the horse
Downtown '83 of course
Just came from fishing, couldn't get a catch
Downtown they'll probably have a batch
A whiting sandwich and a Guinness Stout
But with the beer though I had a bout
So I exchanged it for some apple juice
I had the blues but I shook them loose
A jeep is blasting from the urban streets
Loops of funk over hardcore beats
The moon dabbles in the morning sky
As the minutes just creep on by
I get a thought and here comes my Tribe
Ritual shakes and in good vibes
Like always the Quest begins
In the mist though but the rhythms moving
We find a spot and we sit and chat
Speaking on the status quo of rap
A derelict makes a real long speech
We pay attention to the words he read
When he was done we rattled on
There was no rush because it wasn't dawn
We pointed things out about these times
The worlds famines and the crazy crimes
Inflation of the nation, it bothers me
I better go gold, to pay the taxes
Gotta be swift 'n society
The man whose made is the man who maxes
The grounds for living are being discussed

Gather thoughts and savor breath

Bug out all night, ask Phife, he's with this
Girls be screaming on this conversation
I have my two cents for a revelation
And my watch continuously tick-tocks
Shaheed will bring up the beats that rocks
I hear the frogs and the smashing of bottles
A car revs up and I hear it throttle
It probably moves with the morning wind
Oh my God, here's Phife again
Hear him talking about last night's game
Trying to remember someone's name
So hear the frogs dancing in the streets
Once again Ali will bring up the beat
Like this

The sun is risen and the shine is bright

As we go you hear a gasp of laugh
As we start up our rhythmic path

Them hits come out as soon as you hit recording
Born in America, Chevy and Ford
But these Greek ladies loving me, they saying he's foreign
Floored 'em, glued the crowd down by they boot strap
Came up on the scene so quick you'd think we was a newscast
Well newsflash, I can see through that
People try to hide what's on their mind like a do-rag
Never would I do that, I'm real fucking hustler
You be in the background making noise like a muffler
But if it doesn't kill me it makes me tougher

I'm on a different mission, an exhibition no scoring it
So if we more legit they treat us like a compound
Yeah they wanna break us down, never gonna stop now

Sit back, relax cause we finna have a fun time
People think I'm Rican 'cause of the way that I be speakin'
And the shorties I be freakin plus the people that we reaching

Schizo, ginkgo biloba
Performing ""My Sharona"" at talent shows across Girona
Drinkin Coronas in Daytona, loner
Bulova on my wrist, beluga cavi in my tummy
Brendan Fraser in The Mummy
Type-casted time-traveller, action!
I'm counting Jacksons with black friends
Counting tens in Benzes with white friends
Wondering if suicide's a largely white trend
Google it later and confirm that, a'ight then
Stars and stripes, man, give me my stipend

Yellow Viper, yellow Hummer, Yellow Benz
Yellow PT Cruiser, yellow 'Lac on rims
Drop yellow 'Vette and a platinum Rolls Royce
That's seven different cars, everyday I got a choice
On my way to pick up Joyce, she be making me moist
Giving me head while she humming, she can play with her voice
And she got nice thighs, a big plump ass
She could ride a dick too, make me cum fast
I like them modeling bitches, I love them swallowing bitches
Where them hoes headed at? I'm 'bout to follow them bitches (let's go)
I know you with your folks, but that nigga is broke
You might as well open your legs up and let a nigga poke
I'm a show you what it is not to be a window shopper
Mama you can have Fendi, mama you can have Prada
All you gotta do is break a nigga off proper
You could be with your man, I ain't tryna stop ya

Diamond face, diamond brace
More colors than the game Simon Says
Go, 'hind me
And mami on forty-fifth she told me ""I'm a lez""
And she ain't like too much of dick
But give the bombest head, and so I took it anyway
But bitch I got a Phantom, don't need your pussy anyway
OK, let's talk about this ice that I'm carryin'
All these karats like I'm a fucking vegetarian
Niggas play, I bury them, y'all already knowin'
I threw up my arm and bitches thought it started snowin'
See I'm a keep it going, Big Tymin, you heard's me?

Catch 'em solo, they geezy, don't shock me dog
Well get the fuck, slide on out the way

Let the diamonds and the jewelry light shit up
Each piece of jewelry I own, I ice it up
You don't wanna put your vehicle next to us
Cause all of our vehicles, we dress 'em up

Right about now, you're about to be possessed by the sounds of emcee Rob Base and D.J. E-Z Rock

[Chorus]
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight

[Verse 1]
I wanna rock right now
I'm Rob Base and I came to get down
I'm not internationally known
But I'm known to rock the microphone
Because I get stupid, I mean outrageous
Stay away from me if you're contagious
'Cause I'm the winner, no, not a loser
To be an M.C. is what I choose-a
Ladies love me, girls adore me
I mean even the ones who never saw me
Like the way that I rhyme at a show
The reason why, man, I don't know
So let's go, 'cause
[Chorus]
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight

[Verse 2]
My name is Rob, I got a real funky concept
Listen up, 'cause I'm gonna keep you in step
I got an idea
That I wanna share
You don't like it? So what, I don't care
I'm number one, the uno, I like comp
Bring all the suckers 'cause all them I'll stomp
Bold and black but I won't protect
All of my followers 'cause all I want is respect
I'm not a doctor, put them in rapture
A slick brother that can easy outfox ya
'Cause I'm Rob, the last name Base, yes
And on the mic, I'm known to be the freshest
So let's start, it shouldn't be too hard
I'm not a sucker so I don't need a bodyguard
I won't fess, wear a bulletproof vest
Don't smoke buddha, can't stand sess, yes

[Chorus]
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
[Verse 3]
The situation that the Base is in
I'm kinda stingy that's why I don't wanna lend
A funky rhyme to a foe or a good friend
But listen up 'cause I want you to comprehend
'Cause I'm the leader, the man superior
I take care of ya and then ya get wearier
So just sit, my rhymes are not counterfeit
The record sells which makes this one a hit
It won't hurt to listen to Red Alert
Take off your shirt
Make sure it don't hit the dirt
I like the kids; the guys, the girls
I want the ducats 'cause this is Rob Base's world
I'm on a mission, ya better just listen
To my rhymes 'cause I'm all about dissin'
'Cause

[Chorus]
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight

[Verse 4]
I stand alone, don't need anyone
'Cause I'm Rob, just came to have fun
Don't need friends that act like foes
'Cause I'm Rob Base, the one who knows
About things that make ya get weary
Don't cheer me, just hear me
Out 'cause I got the clout, shout (Ho!)
Before I turn the party out
I won't stutter
Project my voice, speak clearly
So you can be my choice
On stage or on record
Go to the Wiz and select it
Take it off the rack, if it's wack put it back
I like the Whopper, fuck the Big Mac
If you want static, so let's go
So, throw up your hands
Go for what you know
Bro', I got an ego
Yo, talkin' to me? No, oh
'Cause Rob is in the front, EZ Rock is on the back-up
We're not soft, so you better just slack up
'Cause I'm cool, calm just like a breeze
Rock the mike with the help of EZ
Rock on the set, the music plays
Only cuts the records that I say
[Chorus]
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight

[Outro]
All right, now, EZ Rock
Now, when I count to three
I want you to get busy
You ready now?
One, two, three, get loose now

It takes two to make a
It takes two to make a
It takes two to make a
It takes two to make a, it takes two to make a, it takes two to make a
It takes two to make a
It takes two to make a
It takes two to make a

It takes two to make a
It takes two to make a

Fast money bitch, can't even clock my land speed
Four door Porsche, just bought it last week
Five mil from LA Reid, let's see how long that last me
I sign for mils and run through it just like an athlete
I'm in the same boat, as Usain Bolt
Say I'm insane cause everything always pertain dope
I say you're right and pray I see you hoes on Skid Row
Look what they did to Wayne, they wanna hang me
Pull out my contracts, turn to page three

Somebody told, now somebody body cold, maricon

Majored in distribution, bags fatter than Rasputia
You know the prices, you don’t like it, my little dog’ll shoot ya
That white got me ice, that ice got me noticed
And then from that that Arm and Hammer, adding baking soda
Whip it ‘til it stretch hard, look at all my stretch cards

If I can’t afford work, best believe I’m gon' take it
Believe I’m gon' break it down to the nickel piece

Surrounded by the leaches, hating from the bleachers
Custom cars and cycles tight, bitch I ain’t need none of them features
I know, my flag red, my money right
On black sand tanning cause they know my sand white
First time I whipped it, that shit looked like some yogurt
Tried it again, turned a hundred grand to a quota
Tried it again, I ain’t missed a quota ever since

I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z Trip, perfect
I took a seat on the ice cold lawn
She handed me a ice blue bong, whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly
She's in school paying
For tuition, doing porn in the Valley
At least you workin'
But, girl, I can't feel my face
What are we smoking anyway?
She said, ""Don't let the high go to waste""
But can you taste a little taste?
[Chorus]
Novacane, baby, baby
Novacane, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none
Numb, numb, numb, numb

[Verse 2]
Sink full of dishes, pacin' in the kitchen
Cocaine for breakfast, yikes
Bed full of women, flip on a tripod
Little red light on shootin'
I'm feelin' like Stanley Kubrick
This is some visionary shit
Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut
But it keeps on movin'
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile
Stripper booty with a rack like wow
I'll never forget ya
You put me on a feelin' I never had
Never had, never had (Never)
And ever since I've been tryna get it back
And pick it up and put it back
Now I'm something like the chemist on campus
But there's no drug around
Quite like what I found in you, you
I still can't feel my face
What am I smokin' anyway? (Ahh)
She said, ""Don't let the high go to waste"" (Ooh)
But can you taste a little taste?
[Chorus]
Novacane, baby, baby (Ohh)
Novacane, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none
Numb, numb, numb, numb

[Bridge]
Novacane, novacane, novacane
Novacane, novacane (Ohh)
Numb the pain, numb the pain, numb the pain
Numb the pain, numb the pain (Ohh, ohh)
Novacane, novacane, novacane
Novacane, novacane
For the pain, for the pain (Ohh, ohh, ohh)
Novacane, novacane (Ooh)

[Outro]
Pretty girls involved with me
Making pretty love to me, pretty
Pity, pity
All the pretty girls involved with me
Making pretty love to me, pretty
Pity, pity
I can't feel a thing, I can't feel, I can't feel a thing
I can't feel a thing, I can't feel, feel, feel, feel her
I can't feel, feel her
Novacane, novacane, novacane
I can't feel, feel her
Novacane for the pain, for the pain

Strawberry Swing,Frank Ocean,"['pop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
When we were kids
We handpainted strawberries on a swing
Every moment was so precious
Then
I'm still kicking
I'm daydreaming on a strawberry swing
The entire Earth is fighting
All the world is at its end
Just in case an atom bomb
Comes falling on my lawn
I should say and you should hear
I've loved
I've loved the good times here
I've loved our good times here

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Say hello, then say farewell
To the places you know
We are all mortals, aren't we?
Any moment this could go
Cry, cry, cry, oh
Even though that won't change a thing
But you should know, you should hear
That I have loved
I have loved the good times here
And I will miss our good times here
[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Spaceships are lifting off
Of a dying world
And millions are left behind
While the sky burns
There wasn't room for you and I
Only you, goodbye
Goodbye

[Outro: Chris Martin]
Ah, now the sky could be blue, I don't mind
Without you, it's a waste of time
Could be blue, I don’t mind
Without you, it's a waste of time
The sky could be blue, could be grey
Without you, I'm just miles away
The sky could be blue, I don't mind
Without you, it's a waste of time

I Hate Love,Lil Wayne,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
She was the sweetest ever
Whatever happened to forever
She never say never, she rather say whatever
I’d rather stay together and she’d rather chase the devil
Now I’m left to race the rebel
Bartender make it several
Turn up the bass and treble
How bout I make it metal
I’m such a fatal fellow
And shes the reason why
Because without the muthafucker I’d die
I’d die, I’d die
So bury me today or tomorrow
Cause I’ve buried myself away
In the sorrow in May
I die before I wake
I pray I’m resurrected for her nightmares sake

But you love me
At least thats what she said
That whole weekend in my bed
But there was a speaker in my head
Saying “seek and you’ll be led”
But instead, instead I loved you
I was weak and mislead
I was deeper than dead
I was sinking in dread now I’m thinking in shreds
So I inked this in red
But she loves me
She loves me not
I hate love
Yeah I hate love
Oh my God
I hate love

[Verse 2]
I used to tell myself I wouldn’t do this to myself
Until I proved it to myself
And now I’m losing myself
I used to have my shit together but now
You see now, I with whatever
And now, you see, now, you with whoever, forever and ever
And everybody know I ain't acting like I’m supposed
I’m attacking my own soul
I’m back in a lone mode
I’m back on that long road
And that road goes forever and ever
I don’t wanna love no more, spare me
You can have my heart its only dead beat
I’m sick of the love songs and the bullshit
When reality bites like a wolf bitch
She’s on top, she wanna kiss
She won't stop, she don’t wanna quit
Then I woke up and I wish I could sleep forever and ever
[Refrain]
She loves me, she loves me not
I hate love
Yeah I hate love
Oh my God
I hate love

And I don’t want love, I don’t want love
I don’t wanna love no more
So if you see her you can have her
She’ll be outside my door
So tell a preacher, tell a doctor
I curse the very day you were born
Tell my lawyer to tell a judge that I’m guilty"
Ghetto Gospel,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: 2Pac]
Uh, hit 'em with a little ghetto gospel

[Chorus: Elton John & 2Pac]
Those who wish to follow me
(My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
If I could recollect before my hood days
I sit and reminisce, thinkin' of bliss and the good days
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to 'em
They tested with stress that they under
And nowadays, things change
Everyone's ashamed of the youth 'cause the truth look strange
And for me, it's reversed
We left 'em a world that's cursed, and it hurts
‘Cause any day, they'll push the button
And all good men like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothin'
Don't it make you get teary? The world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take your time to hear me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white, ‘cause we human
I hope we see the light before it's ruined
My ghetto gospel
[Chorus: Elton John & 2Pac]
Those who wish to follow me
(Ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands

And peace to this young warrior

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Tell me, do you see that old lady? Ain't it sad?
Livin' out of bag, but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there, there's a lady, crack got her crazy
Guess who's givin' birth to a baby?
I don't trip or let it fade me
From out of the fryin' pan, we jump into another form of slavery
Even now, I get discouraged
Wonder, if they take it all back, will I still keep the courage?
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles
I make mistakes, but learn from every one
And when it's said and done, I bet this brother be a better one
If I upset you, don't stress
Never forget that God isn't finished with me yet
I feel His hand on my brain
When I write rhymes, I go blind and let the Lord do his thang
But am I less holy
'Cause I choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies?
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets
My ghetto gospel
[Chorus: Elton John & 2Pac]
Those who wish to follow me
(Yeah, ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold

""I'm setting the example, and what I've done is gonna be puzzled over
And studied
And followed
Forever.""

[Verse 1: Ikon]
Prepare for the verbal war
The hologram advance, physical form
Manifest the universal mind into the law
Travelling lands, I stand on sands of chemical vibrations
The math, kings of light departed in wrath
So where you gonna stand when the Elohim return
Seven great sages throughout the ages say you burn
It's my turn to shine
I redefine the crystalline-biological structures, implanted in your mind
So I find the deaf, dumb and blind
And bless 'em with science, and leave the blind ones behind
Descending into big balls of mass, in the form of rain
The Verbal Hologram brings pain
So rearrange disagreeable ways that brought you the darkness
Take hold and rip out your soul from your carcass
And rise away like a sham
The Verbal Hologram is the verbal avalanche
One last chance to re-plan and over-stand
Before the Hologram sends your camp to Holy Land
So ask your man, when he returns to where I sent him
The plan was to kill God and reinvent him
Practicing Black Magical tactics like voodoo
Attacking like the seven deadly warships of Nibiru

I bring forth the mighty Yudhāmanyu, the powerful Sapagra
The darkening behind you, the biblical omega man
The Ashtar command, I came to bring mortals the barathary gland
So here I stand on the Four Corners of Stonehenge
Travelling through portals, the thunderbolt of battles, the lord of the immortals
The zeal of the seven, the rising of the demon
The lost books of the Bible and forgotten books of Eden
The heathens, who burn like pyrhosis
Handed the Holy tablets, like Moses
The blackening of roses, will send you to the edges of the land
The emerald tablets, of Thoth the Atlantean
The hands of the mighty lion of Judah
Will throw you through the triangular portals of Bermuda
Exploring the Hologramic aspects of consciousness
For aliens to devour
Orthodox vs relativistic equations for power
The shower of acid rain brings pain to the land
You cannot kill what you cannot see
The Verbal Hologram

Don't ask me to pity those people. I don't mourn them any more than I do the thousands that died at Sodom and Gomorrah

Wow this career is so so commercial
I would say no
More after school special
Another story about an unruly teen
Become a triumphant
More than what it seemed
All of the glorious things that he dreamed
Made the life that he saw seem so sub par
A star that was shooting didn’t seem too far
All he needed was some rockets on the side of a car
Maybe a little weed to intensify the scene
To provide a solid answer to the question “why I lean?’
A bonafide fiend that be taking by the beams of light
Man on the moon ain’t a name it’s a way of life
And this is why I got hated
Until I found myself and embraced it
Its something I denied
Why lie to my soul
Truth be told…

I’m just a dreamer
Turned true to life leaner
Born to do good
So others can be believers
Once had a lover, but I had to leave her
My life is much bigger
The plan I mean
Its all set in motion, the plan I’ve seen
Couldn’t figure out my purpose till the sky changed scenes
While them other niggas ride watching screens
I was getting off of work daydreaming all alone
Daydream till I’m home
In my bed in my zone
Nobody would call
Not a ring on my phone
Raps so boring
I can’t buy ringtones
I’d rather have the Nokia alert
I’m so gone
Man I’m never alert
But I feel so good
No more hurt
I’m whole completely complete
Rainy days completely delete

And I only do 40 when I'm on the highway
So you can see that candy candy candy candy spray
And I want you to see this handsome handsome handsome face
And I had hoes way before I was rich
But now that I got money I got millions I can pick
Cause money make most of these broads fuck quick
And I am so fly I can't help it
[Hook:]

And I feel safe, I got shooters on my team

Goodbye,Wiz Khalifa,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah
It's young Khalifa, man
My weed good
Fingernails clean now
I don't do nothing but peel money and touch bitches

So tell 'em go hard
I'ma go hard or I'ma go home
So that's what I'ma do, hahaha

So goodbye

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I worked for everything I own
Dare a nigga try and take it
Spent 300 on the frames
Just for blocking out you haters
Swear they're in my way
They in my rear view mirror
If a nigga act stupid
I'mma let him get his issue
Everything designer
And my back seats recline
I got a thing for livin' good
And blowing money like it's tissue
But niggas see you eating
Get to starving for a plate
Well, you don't give it when they hate
That's why my niggas keep a biscuit
It's no gimmick
I talk it how I live it
So when nigga cross the finish
Gotta push it to the limit
Got a mom and little sister
I plan on taking care of
Lost my uncle this year
A couple niggas in the system
So I roll
No telling where I'm landing
But I know something
That I'm going towards some money
I can see you niggas slacking
Everyday I'm on my job
Young Khalifa going hard
'Til the I'm last man standing

Tell 'em, go home cause I'ma go hard
Go hard or I'ma go home

Go hard or I'ma go home
And I ain't been there you know in so long
So goodbye

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Got my eyes on this money
And some good weed burning
Where I'm from you gotta grind
Going hard is not an option
Now these niggas acting jealous
Cause they feel like they ain't shining
And they little shit stop
When this big shit popping
Probably be a fiend
Gotta keep it in my system
60-box of cigarillos
Cause I blow it by the onion
Pay a couple bills
Send some paper to my young'n
'Cause he just like Steve Francis
He be playing with them rockets
Whipping on the wheel
Got my peddle to the metal
'Bout to hit another city
Ain't no point in getting settled
Straight onto the plane
Ain't been home in so long
Niggas think it's my cologne
But that's money that you smelling
I act like my father
Can't stand my older brother
Got some niggas doing years
Cause of funny niggas telling
Nigga, I'm a keep grinding
'Til the day that I expire
I be running through the fire
'Til I'm the last man standing

Tell 'em, go home cause I'ma go hard

I'mma take you back, take take you back (x2)
See, cuz it's twisted..
In the future, scientists will prove that we never even existed

[Verse One]
I got lectured once while eating breakfast for lunch
Said dad to me ""Reality is nothing but a collective hunch
Whatever you want the truth to be, simply fool the masses
Attack them mentally with tools of power like the Masters
Get em in elementary school and college classes
Eventually you'll overrule their cowardly asses
Don't worry about society, they're all horrible bastards""
With this knowledge I blast kids. stay dark like Howard's glasses
I'm ""Stern!"" plus I rule with an iron fist
With no concern, it's so cruel, where did I learn this?
It's in my gene pool. For permanent bliss
It seems cool, only if you suffer from eternal ignorance
Internal innocence rejects external filth. Hurdle the guilt
My ancestors left. Dress with a traditional kilt
Curdled milk that's under suspicion will get spilt
Ain't no use crying. Who's lying about the empire I built?
Another self proclaimed historian
With Einstein as his passenger, and a flux capacitor in his Delorean
Rewrote my past, taught me sin
When we spoke at last he caught me in the chin
There was no need to ask, I know he fought me to win
My broken task is born again, let a new war begin
I think he saw me grin. Played my ass like a sucka
Turned that brunch between me and my father into our last supper
[Hook]
He'll take us back, take take us back
He'll take us back, take take us back (Take us back back!)
He'll take us back, take take us back
He'll take us back, take take us back (W-W-W-Way Back!)
See, cuz it's twisted..
In the future, scientists will prove that we never even existed

[Verse Two]
So now I'm orphaned into this world of a rewritten past
Where they force my girl to clean and force me to sit in class
The teacher laughs as he preaches math, beats me with a staff
Because the text we read expects us to bleed each paragraph
I speed through the chapter fast. My prospectful wife
Hangs her pride at half mast, force fed domestic life
Is giving her a fat ass...she can't eat no more
""We'll see who laughs last"" is what she speaks so sure
As she sweeps the floor
Her bare feet are sore. I'd massage her toes
But she's way too busy doing dirty laundry and washing my clothes
This bastard ass took us back to the dark ages
My heart races. He's got 1 out of 3 blacks locked in cages
Sage is heading for the mic, but they blocked the stages
Dopes took his notebook, said ""Don't look!"" as they blotched the page
Ignoramuses must have ""idio-dildos"" stuck up in their anuses
Dominatrixes explain how pleasurable of a pain this is
I ain't with this game of his.I'm looking for a loophole
Just because you look the part, don't mean you can play, ask Manute Bol
My absolute role is to save whatever is left of me
The last of my true soul, so I dress up like the referee
To get the coach on every bench pissed
They approach me with a clenched fist
So I throw up their past lives and say, ""Catch this!""
They get the drift, but fans rush the court
Propaganda programs they hold in their hands
Brain washed and flushed their thought
Now it's a blood sport. My girl ain't with this strange land
She was fronting like a cheerleader as she figured out the game plan
Made peeks at play sheets, memorized them like the Rain Man
Conducted her own brain scan, then reversed the chain of command
""She learned the formulas?"" The story is unraveling
She seduced Einstein by dressing up like Marilyn..
Monroe. now she's got a Manson look in her eyes
And a grin that's stretching so wide.damn, son, I'm petrified!
[Hook]
She'll take us back, take take us back
She'll take us back, take take us back (Take us back back!)
She'll take us back, take take us back
She'll take us back, take take us back(W-W-W-Way Back!)

Slow Down Gandhi,Sage Francis,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
There once was a song called ""Arrest the President.""
Contemporary music, a hit with the kids, it was a top ten
I wasn't pop then, so I missed the bus a bit
But politics, it was on everybody's ""hot this summer"" list
The cool kids were all rocking votes
I shit you not, I was pistol whippin' cops for hip hop (Booyea!)

[Verse 1]
On my soapbox yelling into megaphones
Killing hard rocks, using carcasses as stepping stones
Had to promise that I'd stop holding my marches
The day that Chris Columbus got crucified on golden arches
My pedestal was too tall to climb off
In fact that's the reason for the high horse
And from up here I see marines in hummers on a conquest;
Underdogs with wonderbras in a push-up contest
All for the sake of military recruitment
It felt like Kent State the way they targeted the students
I galloped off whistling ""Ohio""
The rest of them, stuck doing stand-up at a cricket convention
Who would they die for?
Is it the same machine that leaves the quality of life poor?
An abominable colony of cyborgs?
Clogging up the property that I bought with eyesores?
That clever ad campaign ain't worth
The time taken from minimum wage labor
I don't care how half-naked or fake she looks
She smells like dirty cash and aged paper books
Who would she die for?
Slow down Gandhi, you're killin' 'em
Slow down, Gandhi, you're killin' 'em

Now it's whistle blower versus the pistol holder
Case dismissed, they'll lock you up and throw away the key witness
Justice is the whim of a judge, check his chest density
It leaves much room for error, and the rest left to destiny
The West Memphis Three lost paradise
It's death penalty versus suicidal tendencies
All I wanted was a fucking Pepsi
Institution
Making you think you're crazy is a billion-dollar industry
If they could sell sanity in a bottle
They'd be charging for compressed air
And marketing healthcare
They demonize welfare
Middle class eliminated
Rich get richer 'til the poor get educated

But some of y'all still haven’t grown into your face
And your face doesn't quite match your head
And I'm waiting for a brain to fill the dead space that's left
You're all, ""Give me ethnicity or give me dreads""
Trustafundian rebel without a cause for alarm
Cause when push turns to shove
You jump into your forefathers' arms
He's a banker, you're part of the system
Off go the dreadlocks, in comes the income
The briefcase (The freebase)
The sickness (The symptom)
When the cameras start rollin' stay the fuck outta the picture, pilgrim!
The briefcase (The freebase)
The sickness (The symptoms)
When the cameras start rollin'...
Slow down Gandhi, you're killin' 'em
Mr. Save-the-World, spare us the details
Save the females from losing interest
And Miss Save-the-Universe
You're a damsel in distress
Tied down to a track of isolated incidents
Generalize my disease
I need a taste of what it's like
Living off the fat of kings
I play the scab at your hunger strike
Slow down Gandhi, you're killin' 'em

One love, one life, one too many victims
Republicrat, Democran: one-party system
Media goes in a frenzy
They're stripped of their credentials
Presidential candidates can't debate over this instrumental
Let 'em freestyle, winner takes all
When the music’s dead, I'll have Ted Nugent's head hangin' on my wall
Kill one of ours, we'll kill one of yours
With some friendly fire, that’s a funny term, like civil war

Six in the morning, police at my crib
Now my nights consist of two toothpicks and eyelids
The crucifix and vitamins, music that is pirated
New-flavored food made of mutated hybrids
Uh, they tell me that it's not that bad
It fucks you up good, but it's not that bad
They hold on to these tales 'til it's the dog that wags
God save us all if he lets the cat out the bag (cCat out the bag)
Who's the one to blame for this strain in my vocal chords?
Who can pen a hateful threat but can't hold a sword?
It's the same who complain about the global war
But can't overthrow the local joker that they voted for

They call the shots
But they're not in the line of fire
I call the cops
But they're breakin' the line of duty
Let's call a stop to the abuse of authority
The truth keeps callin' me, and I'm a live to tell the story

So look for truth, quit seeking forgiveness
You need to cut the noose, but you don't believe in scissors
You support the troops by wearing yellow ribbons?
Just bring home my motherfuckin' brothers and sisters

Cause they don't call the shots
But they're in the line of fire
I'd like to call the cops
But they're breakin' the line of duty
It's time to call a stop
To the abuse of authority
The truth keeps calling me
And I'm a live to tell the story

Come away with me to another ranch

You know how we do, if one goes soft
We all take the pussy and go up in her raw

Here we go again... — After what I just gave you?
Wasn't actin' like that, when you asked for that favor
Yo, I ain't asked you for shit! — Oh, yes you did!

You sold me your soul when you didn't say no

Im Sorry Ms. Jackson 50 Cent diss,Jadakiss,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Bridge: Jadakiss]
When it's all said and done, After they said I've won
All I'm going to say is...

[Hook: André 3000 & Jadakiss ]
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (Hey!)
I am for real (Let's go)
Never meant to make your daughter cry (Uh-uh)
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (Sensitive ass nigga, yeah)
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Tried to diss kiss to the world
And it's your fault cause she said she saw you kissing a girl
The hood was behind her for her whole career
But now they've slightly starting to disappeared
Something about that
She's always angry
Might have been when them girls trying to push her scalp back
Needed some head room
So she went out and bought Tyson's mansion with 18 bedrooms
She's a domestic boss
That don't leave no marks though, you got to digest those scars
In fact think you got to tell her to get back
Because every kiss rap is similar to a bitch slap
Too hard since way back in the school yard
She's hollywood though all she needs is a boobjob
Girl in the bubble, didn't mean to trouble her
Man but im a Calico, im double her
Really think you should tell her to chill cause
My resume is longer than a doctor bill was
I did the song with ja rule bigging the city up
She did the magic stick remix with olivia
She got more money but I get busier
Think somebody going to end up killing her
[Bridge: Jadakiss]
When it's all said and done
After they said I've won
All I'm going to say is...

[Hook]
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Hood had love for this bitch
Cause she came from south side queens with a thug ass click
Bitch got change, and she changed
Now she don't fuck with the hood, probably give a nigga brains
Bitch got boogie on a nigga
Went from the hood to hollywood got a movie on a nigga
Bitch talking greasy like new york sting
Sucking down south dick that's some new york thing
And the bitch used to be cool, hood even liked the bitch
We used to listen to her gettin’ the weed
She had stories of many men, times in the club and niggas that was wanksta but the truth was to see
Bitch ain't shyt, she was real good at bluffing it
Ordered protection on the niggas she was fucking with
Now that's a ho that you just can't trust
Hired cops, that's a ho that you just can't touch
Bitch moved out new york when they were swinging them Glocks
Bitch got a deep voice but she would be singing a lot
Bitch would sell her soul just to get on the charts
Want to front like she's gangsta but she got no heart
And she going to get hit by the mac and
All in the back and this time i bet the jaw will be cracking
She's going to get broken to fractions d block is the faction
All i can say is im sorry ms. jackson
[Hook]
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
I am for real

Yeahh, ""Tell me where, you coming from""

[Jadakiss]
Can't really figure this clown out
Where's he from? Jamaica, Queens, Cali or down South
I could let a LA gun hit him
But grapestreet already told me you pay him to run with him
I could let a New York knife poke him with one of my throaways
But I don't want to see no cops smoke him
Somebody tell Paul we ridin
And get ready to auction off the car he die in eBay
Never we bump heads, since you like havin people with you
Get you a hospital with bunk beds
Without Dr. Dre, you would just make slow jams
Come up out of that witness protection program
Hov don't really respect you, get in your place
If BIG was alive, he'd probably spit in your face
Nas was doing just fine without you
And Pac probably would've made an album about you
So I guess that just leaves me here to get rid of you
And Rakim and them, they don't even consider you
EM kno you ain't got nothing for Jada
And I know he appreciates all the money you made him
It's two thousand-five, nobody fights fair
I just know an instrumental's your worst nighmare
But you tough and you bad, too bad, you mad
Probably been in your own hood more than you had
Yeah you sold more records than me
But in the streets you gon' always be second to me
We was damn near feelin you
Even though your career's based on somebody damn near killin you
Shit you be doing ain't even considered rapping to us
This is probably the best thing that happened to us
The best wanksta, internet gangsta
Magazine mobster, shit on your whole roster
Get ready to say hail marrys and all fathers
Get out your black suits and hard bottoms
And don't worry, I got him
He ain't a problem child, just a child with a problem
""Why can't you be man enough"" We love you nigga
Oh-five, ""Tell me where, you coming from""

[Styles P]
D-Block, don't think it nigga
Take a piss in your Formula 50, drink it nigga
Get shot out the Reeboks nigga
Got shot and ain't shoot none back, you'se a biatch nigga
If I would've got shot on grandma's stoop
I would've asked somone to grab my duke, right
In the streets they say, 50 who shot ya
Named three niggas soon as he came out the doctor
And you far from a gangsta nigga
You was talkin 'bout yourself when you made ""Wanksta"" nigga
Listen, why work out, cock guns on the DVD
Run around with cops from homicide and TNT
Nigga you can suck my dick
Come around without cops, shit's on, you gon' get touched quick
Cuz, I was at the VIBE when it jumped off
Put fifty grand up, and pussy you ain't even lift a hand up
Your man stabbed somethin, at least grab somethin
But besides that, I ain't seen nobody man up
Shit, what the plot is about
Cuz you know that, you don't need a dentist to get shot in the mouth
And the hood hate yo shit, but you hot in the south
Is the crackers that buy the album, what's the plottin about
""Many Men"" make a wish, but we ain't many men
So you gon' get death when we let the semi spit
""Why can't you be man enough""
""Tell me where, you coming from"" 2X"

Makaveli rest in peace
Irv Gotti, too much Bacardi in his body
Mouth like a 12-gauge shotty (Feel me!) (Come get me)
And Ja said he shall be (Motherfuckers if you want Shady)
The lost forgotten seed of 2Pac (If Pac was still here now)
To lead this industry into the ways of the man (He would never ride with Ja)
Follow me! (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Keep my mesh vest as Pac's vest

Come get me
If you muthafuckas want Shady

He would never ride with Ja
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

You ain't no killa, you a pussy
That Ecstasy done got you all emotional and mushy
Bitches wearin' rags in photos, Ja's words bein' quoted
In The Source, stealin' Pac's shit like he just wrote it
You loud mouths pray to God, hopin' no one's listenin'
See 50 comin' for me, oh my god, ma—my position
No one'll pay attention to me
Please Gotti, here I go, give me this pill
Ecstasy done got me feelin' so invincible
And now all of a sudden I'm a fuckin' madman who screams
Like I'm Pac, but I'm not, enemies, Hennessey
Actin' like I'm great, but I'm fake, I'm crazy
Sweat drip, get me off this trip, someone stop this train
Some say my brain is all corrupted, fucked from this shit
I'm stuck, I'm addicted to these drugs, I'ma quit
Sayin' muthafuckas names before somebody fucks me up
Ain't no pussies over here, partner, see you in hell, fucka

Penitentiaries is packed with promise makers
Never realized the precious time that bitch niggas is wastin'
Institutionalized, my bitches bring me product by the bundles
Hustle hard from a cell, G-Unit muthafucka, we ballin'
Catch me countin' cheese and when I'm callin', can you accept my call
C.O. let me sip on Hennessey, can I sip some more
Hell, I done been to jail, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it
Muthafuckas thinkin' they can stop 50, they losin' it
Lil' nigga named Ja think he live like me
Talkin' 'bout he left the hospital, took 9 like me
You live in fantasies, nigga, I reject your deposit
When your lil' sweet ass gon' come out of the closet?
Now he wonderin' why DMX blowed him out
Next time grown folks talkin', bitch, close your mouth
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
Done seen too many real niggas ball to let these bitch niggas beat me
Black, you's a muthafuckin' punk and you can see me with gloves
Quit scarin' them fuckin' kids with your ugly ass mug (Ha-ha-ha)
And you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's goin' on
Nigga payback, Tah, I know your bitch ass from way back
Witnessed me strapped with Macs, you know I don’t play that
All these old rappers tryin' to advance
It's all over now, take it like a man (Ha-ha)
Irv lookin' like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick
Tryna play hate on my shit, man, eat a fat dick
Lovin' this shit that's how you made me
Feelin' like I got you niggas crazy (Uh-uh)
Against all odds, hopin' my thug muthafuckas know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio gettin' blow
To the truest shit I ever spoke
21 gun salute

I've been one of the most humble, rep the streets to the core
Hey Jeffrey, what the fuck you come involvin' me for
It's been a long time comin', like a bless and a check
You see 106 and Park fans don't even fuckin' respect you
It's kinda funny, wannabe Pac, wanna fake like you thug
Runnin' around talkin' shit that he ain't capable of
Now let me off this cocksucker whilst we handle you, nigga
If I recall, Violator use to manage you, nigga
Then took a closer look and realized you was an impostor
There's never been a Violator on a Murda Inc. roster
Dumbass, now who's shootin'? Ah made you look
You said Bus singin' the same old hook, you stupid
If y'all shootin', I take a look at your man
The bitch shot himself in front of Def Jam
Cheddar Bob ass nigga, start adjustin' your plan
You let the streets down nigga, 'pologize to your fans
Watch you pull a little stunt like we ain't know what it was
Little faggot desperate tryin' to re-establish a buzz
I know the shit is drivin' you crazy, you wonderin' how
The streets ain't never want you Beatrice, what you gonna do now?
Now if you wanna beef with me, then I'm beefin' with you
I think about the game and what it's like and what would it be without you
I'm finished, I ain't tryin' to repeat this
Just cause I'm cool, you shouldn't take my kindness for weakness

Oh shit, it was fun
Next time you got a problem with me
Address me before you try to make shit a public issue, homie
Now I'ma return back to my regular self
And have fun again

Lemme design your fashion
Change gears till your eyes is matchin'
Go hard till I’m your passion
These others chicks thinkin' that their minds is gassed up
Yeah, I rhyme up with whatever
Swing by the crib, we can fuck or whatever
We can crush but you gotta get some colors on
Hardbody, get your colors on

[Verse 2: Calvin Harris]
Now I don’t care what you dress like or what you wear
But please make sure baby, you’ve got some colors in there
Now it’s all very well steppin' out in black and white
But you’re no girlfriend of mine if you’re doin' that right
Now I don’t care what you dress like or what you wear
But please make sure baby, you’ve got some colors in there
Now it’s all very well steppin' out in black and white
But you’re no girlfriend of mine if you’re doin' that right
[Verse 3: Laws]
Lemme take you to my home, to my zone
To my bed, to the end and beginnin' of a friendship
You got me like what’s your name? What’s your size?
Are you mine? Are you some kind of black magic temptress?
I hope so ‘cause my life’s kind of ordinary
I need a woman, I’ve broken all sort of cherries
I need a tigress, I need a night prowler
I need a “Wanna try this?”, alright holla
I need a chick when I call, then she might follow
I got dope, if they raid, she might swallow
Don’t be frontin' mama, gonna bring some colors here
If your love is real, I might even scoop your mother
Yeah, I'mma underground buzz around, thunder sound
Cut you down, why you always sound like uh-uh-uh?
When you goin' down, goin' to town
Just deep breaths, start slowin' it down, we got time ma

[Outro: Laws & Calvin Harris]
Get some colors on
We can crush but you gotta get some colors on
You hard body, go and get your colors on
Get some colors on
Body paint, this is more than a cover song
I wrote this so you’ll never want another song
Get some colors on
We can crush but you gotta get some colors on
You hard body, go and get your colors on
Get some colors on
Body paint, this is more than a cover song
I wrote my verse so you’ll never want another song"

Two big Sterling revolvers...
Midnight in the garden of good

[Verse 1: Architect Holocaust]
This being of age-old grace, Architect Holocaust
Mossback, Antediluvian that of late
Embedded and preserved, expired, current departed
Lyrics crash across ya head, now unzipping your face
Former antique kissing crocodiles, flight bound
Tear open ya flesh like presents and thinner nightgowns
Toots slow down, you'll never catch Mr. Appleby
In some flaming town, you'll bury yourself the greediest
Death before riches, kingdom of good barbarians
Circumstances of development leading up to the previous
Where the day takes you, placed within the Sun
Crush all the village cowards, devour till sin is done
One bag of bones, children gather, Easter egg hunt
Afterwards fruit bonbons and safari punch
Branded hollow planet, Period of Adjustment
Back to the hanging gardens and lavish the fake lunch
Plantation memories, stone monolith choice bound
Hoist down the use of human beings of voice sound
In the prairie fields, the poppies blow
All the crosses, row and row
They are the dead, short days ago
They lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow
The torch be yours, to hold it high
If ye break faith with us, who dies?
Loved and were loved, and now they lie
Cause they didn't live life from the ground to the sky
[Hook 3x: Architect Holocaust]
Silver ants and golden beetles crawling throughout my paragraphs
Father Architect, to peel a lemon and share a drag
Snow creek lime, draw lyrics that float and colorise
Butterscotch ladybugs, candy cane butterflies

[Verse 2: Architect Holocaust]
In-line skates in a pillowcase, swinging at ya face
The sound through a combination of sounds or it's representation
In writing or printing, the text of a vocal theme
Salamander slithers into a stream where glitters fiend
Calm unique, cinéma fantastique, the true castle
We building new chapels, still bobbing for blue apples
Tackled and shackle, recycling wordage in best fonts
Eat off Titanic artefacts on the waterfront restaurant
World War III, entrées, picket and crept with me
Aqua-taxi verbalism torch, ticketed separately
Ice laden waters all thrilled to the heroics
Hair pin, twists and turns, bottles exploded
Tomorrowland, news flash, Baskin-Robbins and Häagen-Dazs
LensCrafter articles cleansing open your noggin floss
Views of marine life, mystifyingly true
Harvest scores of curiosities just to rhyme in see-through
Flew first class, ideal baby pandas, koalas
Gold rich Pina Coladas and experience my katana
Those ""Me-stopheles"", ""Beleezebub"", Luciferian lifestyle
Black mambo, king snake, desert gecko, the cowardly
Waffle shoe clubfoot, Poly, Slavic for penny
Dirty six-legged pigs from New Guinea, Eric and Minnie
For the jealous always tell us that the enemy envies hatred
And the deceitful lust read it, shed off infinity facelifts
Takes one to know, land mammals return to sea
And the water turns to blood, chew cotton candy with glee
[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3: Architect Holocaust]
Hang 'em high, dripping, overlooking the rolling vineyards
Sunset stroll, hand-picked the green raisins
Rocky mountain strawberries, leisure shoot for the taste buds
My speech rinses flesh from the fossils of [???]
Seem patient, wasting time just now, slim-fitted crewmen
The insects and the creatures tell riddles of dim-witted humans
One man aircraft carrier, personnel
No drinking during the sermon, extinguish the serpent's hell
What mockery have thee traded for thy precious soul?
The voice being star fruit or dragon fruit, re-evaluate choice
Merry-go-rounds, monkey bars, neck climbs and curvy slides
Balance beams and hideaways, all examine my thirty rhyme
Interactive play areas, reservations required
Free wheelchairs, strollers and lockers for aiming higher
Plus elite catering, remarkable tasting menu
And every dollar that you spend enables it to continue
Never will concede, just work hard, determined
Either/Or suburban or urban, Italian, German
Spanish, French, African, Oriental and Russian
Samoan Irish bagpipes wrestle with the percussion
Party hats, balloons and crazy string, confetti
Open field exhibit caravans, lyrical Serengeti
Overnight camping trip, foes will disappear
Heavy paragraphs, clear and truthfully engineered

Man, what you want with her?
I'm sick of this bullshit
[Cube]
Yo, man, let me tell you something

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Your daughter was a nice girl, now she is a slut
A queen treatin' niggas just like King Tut
Gobbling up nuts, sorta like a hummingbird
Sucking up the Lench Mob crew, and I'm comin' third
Used to get straight A's, now she just skippin' class
Oh my, do I like to grip the hips and ass
Only seventeen with a lot of practice
On black boys' jimmies and white boys' cactus
Sorry sorry sir, but I gotta be brief
A lotta niggas like bustin' nuts in her teeth
Drink it up, drink it up, even though she's Catholic
That don't mean shit 'cause she's givin' up the ass quick
Quicker than you can say ""candy""
The bitch is on my Snicker
And oh man, she can take on three men built like He-Men
Her little-bitty twat got gallons of semen
Fourteen niggas in line ready to bang your
Pride and joy, I mean daddy's little angel
Tell the little bitch to bring her ass out the house
'Cause your daughter's known for givin' up the nappy dug out

And if that bitch can hang
I'm gonna do my thing with your daughter
Givin' up the nappy dug out

I'm gonna do my thing with your daughter
Givin' up the nappy dug out

Mister, mister, before you make me go
I'm here to let you know your little girl is a ho
Nympho, nympho, boy, is she bad
Get her all alone and out comes the kneepads
I know she is a minor and it is illegal
But the bitch is worse than Vanessa Del Rio
And if you decide to call rape
We got the little hooker on tape, now
Tell the fuckin' slut to please hurry up
And wear that dress that's tight on her butt
So I can finger-fuck on the way to the bed
Been in so many rooms, she got a dot on her forehead
Face turnin' red from grabbin' them ankles
Fuck and get up is how I do them stank-hoes
You should hear how she sounds with a cock in her
Boots get knocked from here to Czechoslovakia
Two are on top, one on the bottom
First nigga got the boots; man, you shoulda shot him
'Cause after I got 'em it was over
Now niggas get lucky like a four-leaf clover
On daddy's little girl
She keeps nuts in her mouth like the bitch was a squirrel
So tell Cheryl to bring her ass home
'Cause the line at my house is getting long, and

Warning, when having sexual intercourse with a female like Cheryl
You must use jimmy hat condoms
We're called jimmy hats, have you ever seen us?
Most guys wear us 'round rolled up on your penis
If you're real smart, you will always use us
Put me in your wallet, or some dummy screws us
And going bareback without the bare facts
And have creepy crawlies crawling on your nutsack
So get the J-I-M-M-Y to the hats
It's me and two brothers in a pack
Run out and get your jimmy hats
Small and extra large
Run out and get your jimmy hats

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
1988 senior year at Garvey High
Where all the guys were corny but the girls were mad fly
Lounging with the Tipster, cooling with Sha
Scoping out the honeys—they know who they are
I was the b-ball playing, fly rhyme saying
Fly girl getting but never was I sweating
'Cause when it came to honeys I would go on a stroll
Until I met my match—her name was Flo
Yeah, I messed around with the one called Flo
All the troopers 'round the way used to call her a ho
But deep down in my heart I knew that Flo was good to go
'Cause I thought it was me like Bell Biv Devoe
But little did I know that she was playing with my mind
The only thing I learned is good girls are hard to find
I feel like Heavy D, I need somebody for me
Not someone whose mind is blank and tryna juice me for my banks
Swinging with my main man Lucky behind my back
What type of crap is that—yo, how's about a smack?
Word life, I can't front, thought I was all that
But now it seems, I've met my match
I was a stone cold lover, you couldn't tell me jack
Settling down with one girl, wasn't trying to hear that
I had Tonya, Tamika, Sharon, Karen
Tina, Stacy, Julie, Tracy
Used to love 'em, leave 'em, skeeze 'em, tease 'em
Find 'em, lose 'em - also abuse 'em
My whole attitude was new day, next hon
And believe it or not, they all got done
Well here comes Flo with the crazy whip appeal
And I'm all true man like Alexander O'Neal
Is this really love, then again how would I know
After all this time trying to be a super ho
She finally played me, but yo I'd find another
'Cause I got the crazy game and yo, I'm smooth like butter
[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Ayo, it's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, it's like the butter baby
Not no Parkay, not no margarine
Strictly butter, strictly butter, baby

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
I remember when girls were goodie two shoes but now they turning freaks
All of a sudden (we love you Phife!) ease off ho, my name's Malik
Phife this, Phife that, where you going, where you at
These girls don't know me from jack, yet I feel like the Mack
You didn't want me then, so yo hon, don't want me now
Here, Here - take the towel, wipe off your brow
And take the contact out your eye, you're far from looking fly
You get an E for effort, and T for nice try
Now tell me what's the reason, for dying your hair
Slum village gold still dangling in your ear
You barely have a neck but still sporting a rope
Four-finger ring just so Phifer can scope
You looked in the mirror, didn't know what to do
Yesterday your eyes were brown but today they are blue
Your whole appearance is a lie and it could never be true
And if you really liked yourself then you would try and be you
If your hair and eyes were real, I wouldn't have dissed ya
But since it was bought, I had to dismiss ya
But if you can't achieve it, then why not try and weave it
If you can't extend it then you might as well suspend it
If you can't braid it, best thing to do is fade it
I asked who did your hair and you tell me, ""Diane made it""
If you were you and just you, talk to you, maybe
But I can't stand, no bionic lady
Trying hard to look fly, but yo, you're looking dumber
If I wanted someone like you I would've swung with Jaime Sommers
You wanna be treated right, see Father MC
Or check Ralph Tresvant, for sensitivity
'Cause I am not the one, I got more game than Parker Brothers
Phife Dawg is on the mic and I'm smooth like butter"

And everybody there be like, ""YEAH!""

Shit they be like, ""Com-mon!"" That's my muhfucka (true)
Youse a hamburger, I'mma Fuddrucker
Askin me to let us catch up, knowin you can't cut the mustard
So where's the beef, jerky?
I'm as Worthy as James, not that good with names
But I do remember your face from someplace this is one taste
Of Chicago, we got mo' many mo' many mo' many mo' flavors
Don't just come to me, go ask thy neighbor-I'm-a-hood takin niggas under
On the tundra, cause ""they're plain, they're plain""

So much it's in my hemoglobin to be a ill nigga
So I figure like a father... that I'mma Turn This Mutha Out

I don't know what you thought hops, but chief I got tall props
Some cats think I'm six feet I'm so deep
Some stunts be thinkin I'm six-fo', my shit be hittin like switches
Bitches, ask, why my, britches, sag
I ask the bitches, ""Why your titties saggin?""
Put your nipple to the bottle I bust rhymes like breastses
I can get down, d-d-d-down like pessimist
""Ring the Alarm"", I got Charm like a neck-a-lace

Didn't you, didn't you... and it, and it, and it
And it don't stop, bust it

She had big breasts, honey had me harder than a Spanish test
We on the dancefloor, gettin our boogie on
I see the haters watchin me with they hoodies on
Tryin to peep the ice under the sleeve
I'm like, ""It's time to breeze,"" told honey, ""Let's leave""
Took her to M&G's, got some eggs and cheese
Grits fishcakes and orange juice, freshly squeezed
When she finished her meal, I said, ""What's the deal
For real - you goin home or you tryin to chill?""
She got close, whispered somethin slow in my ear
And it ain't hard to tell where we goin from here
Yeah..

I'm a average nigga, then she said she was in the 6
My relationship, with that nigga called Jigga
I'mma compete with that? I'm a corner nigga sellin crack
Guess I gotta be a ballplayin nigga to bone Da Brat
One bitch, I ain't even wanna fuck
She runnin around, all open off Kurupt
The ho I thought, was gon' be real easy
Told me she got a man and he's some beatmakin nigga named Stevie
What's wrong with these hoes? I'ma fly nigga
I don't wanna go flip Mo' to Rah Digga
Or Miss Lopez, bitch no feds
She used to be in the Bronx, rockin Pro Keds
With some Dominican 'dro heads, ridin' on top this
On the back of mopeds, titties all out - what what?

And I only lay pipe to dimes
A lot of niggas I know are takin care of kids that might be mines
I love to go low, I'm freaky like that
I never get caught creepin cause I'm sneaky like that, uhh
It ain't my fault your girl be ho-hoppin
And matter of fact, the last time you gave her loot to go shoppin
Honey picked me up some dope shirts
It's because of me why she's walkin crooked and her throat hurts
I hate to wait, cause I'm not on the patient tip
Just hit me off, we don't need a relationship
And when you mention my name, it ring a bell
Ask any female, nobody do it like L
I met this chick Rhonda, who pushed the black Honda
Took her to the crib and bombed her with this big brown anaconda

I Shoulda Used a Rubba,Big L,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus]
I shoulda used a rubber, before I went up in it
And then ya monkey ass won't be sittin in a clinic

[Big L]
Ayyo, one hot summer night after ballin hard
I went to the phone booth with my callin card
And called up Joel, yeah you know L
I told her come to the crib, yo mother fuck a hotel
She said she was gonna come at ten
The bitch came, but one problem, she brought a friend
You know I'm not a rude brother yo
But I let Joel in and slammed the door on that other ho
So we was sittin in the livin room kickin it
And all I thought about was stickin it
She was mean, cause you know I wouldn't fuck wit a sleazy ho
Yo we was coolin, watching some TV show
I was crackin sex jokes, tryin to get the puss'
And this bitch was kickin scripts beatin round the bush
Talkin bout rhyme for me L man fuck rhyming
Cause my dick, is hard enough to cut diamonds
I said, ""I hope you ain't tryin to dick tease
Ayyo, cause Big L's quick to tell a bitch leave.""
Ayyo my game started fuckin wit her head soon
Next thing ya know we went straight to the bedroom
I knocked the boots from New York to Santa Fe
And that bitch burnt me like a gamma ray
I caught a cab, on 139 & Lenox
Ayyo, I took it to the neighborhood clinic
Because she gave me gonorrhea
Yo, I'mma kill that bitch, the next time that I see her
[Chorus] x2
I shoulda used a rubber, before I went up in it
And then ya monkey ass won't be sittin in a clinic

One afternoon I was cruising on the Westside
Bumpin my system, lounging back in a fresh ride
Hoes be hotter than a sauna
So I put the system on max, and bumped my shit on the corner
I saw this girl walkin by who was hype as hell
She was mad point-blank, she was right for L
But she tried to play me like a statue black
I said, ""Sweeheart whats your name?""
""I got a man,"" ""I ain't ask you that.""
She said in order to be with me you gotta be rich
You won't be able to switch, I said, ""Fuck you bitch.""
Another girl walked by, I called her
""Excuse me what's your name"" ""Lorraine, what's yours""
Ayyo, game I kicked well
I said honey my names Lamont, but I'm known as Big L
I was looking smooth with the jewelry
She said, ""L's for Lamont, but what's the Big for?"" ""You'll see.""
Ayyo, my pockets was extra thick
""So what you doin later, oh nothing, then lets catch a flick.""
Yeah, I bagged that ho well
Took her to the triple M, movies, meal, and motel
And when it comes to this I'm a professor
I didn't molest her I caressed her, undressed her then sexed her
But I must be getting bolder
Cause I didn't put a helmet on my mother fucking soldier
I started stickin up quick
And the next time I took a leak
A motherfuckin flame shot out my dick
[Chorus] x4
I shoulda used a rubber, before I went up in it
And then ya monkey ass won't be sittin in a clinic

Ayyo L these bitches be burnin’ the dog shit outta niggas, know what I’m sayin’?

Who you tellin’ man? These bitches nowadays’d have a nigga dick drippin’ lava

[Laughter.]

You know what I’m sayin’? Ayyo, these bitches’ll have a nigga, give a nigga’s balls a heat rash or somethin’ man

Okay…

Man fuckin’ with these hoes without a rubber nowadays is like bungee jumpin’ with a rope around your neck. That’s like playin’, [laughter], that’s like playin’ Russian roulette with a shotgun. Ayyo word, ayyo, ayyo man, fuck a rubber man, I’m a start puttin’ balloons on my dick, dog, ayyo I’m a start puttin’ suntan lotion on my dick or somethin’. Ayyo these bitches is triflin’ dog. Ay I’m gettin’ the fuck up out of here man

American Wedding,Frank Ocean,"['rock', 'r&b', 'jazz', 'hip hop', 'blues']","[Intro: Frank Ocean]
American love
American me
American you
American tears
American heartbreak
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
I took a walk with the palm trees
As the daylight fell
Sangria in a canteen
Talking to myself (I can't remember)
This tattoo on my left hand
Is turning purple-ish blue
Daydreams of the romance
Daydreams of you (You)
My pretty woman in a ballgown
I'm Richard Gere in a tux
Getting married in a courthouse
Writing vows in a rush
Making out before the judge
With my teenage wife
Got a wedding band done
That I just might die with
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
It's an American wedding
They don't mean too much
But we were so in love
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours
That's American law

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
M-R-S dot Kennedy
She signed her name in pen (Oh)
In the fancy, fancy cursive (Oh)
Then turned her term papers in (Oh, oh)
A thesis on Islamic (Oh)
Virgin brides and arranged marriage (Ah, ah)
Hijabs and polygamist husbands
Those poor un-American girls
After school she ran to me
Jumped in my 5.0
This is the home of the brave, land of the free
But your parents still didn't know (Oh)
She said, ""I've had a hell of a summer
So, baby, don't take this hard
But maybe we should get an annulment
Before this goes way too far"" (Oh)
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
It's just an American wedding
They don't mean too much
They don't last enough
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours
American divorce

[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]
Well, you can have my Mustang
That's all I've got in my name
But Jesus Christ, don't break my heart
This wedding ring won't ever wipe off
But if you stay
Oh, if you stay (Stay)
You'll probably leave later, anyway
It's love made in the USA

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro: James Fauntleroy]
Don't let 'em front you, they sayin' you can't move
Without 'em, fuck 'em, I tell 'em this ain't new
We been some hustlers since it began, dude
Ain't gon' be trippin' over some bitch-ass dude
They so vain, I tell 'em this ain't you
You could get sensitive, but this shit ain't true
These niggas can't do nothin' that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do, that we can't do
Man, I had a dream and then this shit came true
And nigga, if I did it, I think you can too
These niggas can't do nothin' that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do, that we can't do
Man, I had a dream and then this shit came true
These niggas can't do nothin' that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do"
Songs for Women,Frank Ocean,"['pop', 'hip hop']","[Intro]
Haha
When I was younger, I used to wonder, like...

[Verse 1]
If I was singing songs just to sing the songs
Or if I was singing 'cause that's what the bitches wanted
I couldn't play guitar like Van Halen
Had no secret chords like Saint David
But you still came around, ate your lunch with me
Used to park your car to try the bus with me
But I would say, ""Girl, don't be dumb—
I'm riding shotgun""

[Pre-Chorus]
We could go to my house after school
After school, after school
'Cause my dad don't clock off 'til late
Off 'til late, off 'til late
We could kick it in the living room
Looking through my whole vinyl collection
And you could teach me how to slow dance or something
And I'ma give you chills, harmonizing to Otis, Isley, Marvin
[Chorus]
And every time somebody ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, ""Yeah,"" they say, ""No fair, no fair, it's cheating""
I say, ""Shit, oh well, oh well,"" ha
And every time a nigga ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, ""Yeah,"" they say, ""No fair, no fair, it's cheating""
I say, ""Boy, don't judge, 'cause, hell, if you were me...""

[Post-Chorus]
You'd be singin' to her
Like, ""La-da, da-da-da
La-da, da-da-da
La-da, da-da-da""

[Verse 2]
Now I'm in the lab, always working late
Always sleeping past the breakfast she makes
She used to stop by, come and holler at me
Put her purse down, and try to battle-rap me
She don't do that no more
No more, no more
Don't even listen to the songs I record
But she be banging that Drake in my car
I'm so far gone
She stay blasting Trey and his songs
All damn day long
It's like she never heard of me, heard of me
[Chorus]
Now, every time somebody ask me
If I sing songs to get my women
I say, ""Nah,"" they say, ""Okay, I don't believe it""
I say ""Nope, I swear, I never do it""
And every time a nigga ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, ""Nah,"" they say, ""Who do you think you kidding?
I know you, you stole my girlfriend""

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah
(Ooh, ooh, ah) Ooh, ah
Yeah
Fair enough

[Bridge]
Fair enough
You see, I just don't play fair
But it's fair enough
'Cause your girl broke my heart in half
Ah, ah
I'm singing, ""La-da, da-da"" ‘bout heartbreak
And now, I'm singing, ""La-da, da-da"" 'bout love lost

[Break]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
[Outro]
Damn
Haha
I'm saying though, like...
All I write is love songs
I mean, I try
I come to the studio
I—you know what I do
What you think I do it for? Huh?
Yeah, uh-huh
But you ain't listening, never
But if you were...
Might bug with it
Haha, yeah
All these songs for women

Songs for you, baby

We'll be numb and blue, blue

I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream

I can't be there with you, but I can dream

My grandaddy was a player
Pretty boy in a pair of gators
See, I met him later on
Think it was 1991
The only dad I'd ever know
But pretty soon, he'd be gone too
Hide my face, hide my face
Can't let 'em see me crying
'Cause these boys didn't have no fathers neither
And they weren't crying
My friend said it wasn't so bad
You can't miss what you ain't had
Well, I can
I'm sad and

There will be tears, I have no doubt
There may be smiles but a few
And when those tears have run out
You will be numb and blue

""I can't be there""
That's all you had to say to me was you couldn't be there
Why couldn't you say to me you won't be there?
You coulda warned me you wouldn't be here
Right here, you wouldn't be here for me
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

Callouses upon my mind make me strain for my lines
Out I ripped it squeezed the brain, it made some liquid
Drained it in a cup and then I sipped it
Atmosphere, the mic let me clutch it
Thoughts take flight so fit Slug in your pipe and take a puff kid
Fuck it, I heat it like a tea pot, steam hot
Upon the roof shoot a marble with the verbal slingshot
Take aim, here I came, I'm the same
Back in '86, I'da tag my name upon your window pane
Stained the mind, a deep shade of residue
Voices within the head make choices multiple
Multiply Spawn, Slug a little buzz
And Atmosphere the scuds, cause here comes the judge
Blasted, so pass the kid a mic so we can paint this
Image of the gifted-anxious, to flip the language
It's the noun meltdown from the outer-shell
Now smell the burning flesh fresh from the hell-bound
And come on down here, this mind path, I'm half-
Mathematic Atmospheric staff with the rhyme craft
Comin' to capture, your after-laughter
While I'm hanging from this rafter, I have to rip this rapture
Cause the cramps in my stomach, dismantle
When I tamper with your amplifier, you damn-you die
Why try? The sky presents an eternally unfolding spectacle
One moment puffs of cumulus clouds skidder across it
And next a billowing thunderhead
Perhaps ten miles high looms over the horizon
Probing the structure of the sky
Why try?

[Slug]
Cause I can read an emcee from front to back
From the cover to the classified, I've pacified
My mind with my rhyme skills, I climb hills
And leap, foolish twitch with a single bound
Sending tingles down your spine, designed to swing a pound
This ax handle tripled, inch spike protruding
From the tip of my mic distributing fuckin' headshots
Shots to your head, now you're knee-deep, you need sleep
As you trudge through the sludge and the slugs and the bird shit
We swarm with the bees and diseases
And even if your deejay was Jesus, you could never fuck with these kids
I swarm with the bees and diseases
And even if your deejay was Jesus, you could never fuck with these kids

[Spawn]
Yeah muthafucker, you know who you fuckin' with
You know what kind ass whooping comes with this
You whole crew could get some of this
You whack-as-fuck kids is what the subject is
Roughnecks live, for only a second
Then they give. Oblivion's what you've stepped in
Your reps token, should have been lookin'
I'm sick of you bitch-ass crews when
You tried take what's not yours but you couldn't
Take mine, your fake rhymes, spit them you shouldn't
What will it be now, another victory
Yo who will it be now, it's Spawn that emcee
Complete, a true champ, stamped that on my essence
Amped shootin' presence, fattenin' each fuckin' sentence
When it's time, then it's time to go
That's what I know, be rippin' mics at every show we flow
But who's got my back though?
[Slug]
Stress, Beyond, Ant, the Slug

[Spawn]
So you bests be on your way before there's trouble"

I wonder who they fucked up today?
*Screeching Tires*
You motherfucker!
*Machine Gun Fire*
(Got him)

[Police + MC Ren]
Pull over to the side right now
Man, fuck them motherfuckers!

[Intro: Eazy-E + Sample]
Yo, Dre! Give me a funky-ass bassline!
Right here!

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Here's a little somethin' about a nigga like me
Never should've been let out the penitentiary
Ice Cube would like to say
That I'm a crazy mothafucka from around the way
Since I was a youth, I smoked weed out
Now I'm the mothafucka that you read about
Takin' a life or two, that's what the hell I do
You don't like how I'm livin'? Well, fuck you!
This is a gang and I'm in it
My man Dre'll fuck you up in a minute
With a right left, right left, you toothless
And then you say: ""Goddamn, they ruthless!""
Everywhere we go they say: ""Damn!""
N.W.A's fuckin' up the program
And then you realize we don't care
We don’t just say no, we’re too busy sayin', ""Yeah!""
About drinkin' straight out the eight bottle
Do I look like a mothafuckin' role model?
To a kid lookin' up to me
Life ain't nothin' but bitches and money
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
If you fuck with me I’ll put my foot in your ass
See, I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bailin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'?
[Chorus: MC Ren + Sample]
Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yellin'
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Gangsta, Gangsta!
Hopin' you sophisticated motherfuckers
Hear what I have to say

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
When me and my posse stepped in the house
All the punk-ass niggas start breakin' out
'Cause you know, they know what’s up
So we started lookin' for the bitches with the big butts
Like her, but she keep cryin'
""I got a boyfriend""—bitch, stop lyin'!
Dumb-ass hooker ain't nothin' but a dyke
Suddenly I see some niggas that I don't like
Walked over to 'em, and said, ""What's up?""
The first nigga that I saw, hit him in the jaw
Ren started stompin' him, and so did E
By that time got rushed by security
Out the door, but we don't quit
Ren said: ""Let's start some shit""
I got a shotgun, and here's the plot
Takin' niggas out with a flurry of buck shots
Boom, boom, boom! Yeah, I was gunnin'
And then you look, all you see is niggas runnin'
And fallin' and yellin' and pushin' and screamin'
And cussin', I stepped back and I kept bustin'
And then I realized it's time for me to go
So I stopped, jumped in the vehicle
It's like this, because of that who-ride
N.W.A is wanted for a homicide
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
Fuck with me, I'll put my foot in your ass
See, I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bailin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'?
[Chorus: MC Ren + Sample]
Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yellin'
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Gangsta, Gangsta
He'll tell you exactly how he feel
And don't hold a fuckin' thing back

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
Homies all standin' around, just hangin'
Some dope-dealin', some gang-bangin'
We decide to roll and we deep
See a nigga on Dayton's and we creep
Real slow and before you know
I had my shotgun pointed in the window
He got scared and hit the gas
Right then I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rollin', I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him, so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to the fort
Sweatin' all the bitches in the biker shorts
We didn't get no play from the ladies
With six niggas in a car—are you crazy?
She was scared, and it was showin'
We all said ""Fuck you, bitch!"" and kept goin'
To the hood, and we was fin to
Find somethin' else to get into
Like some pussy, or in fact
A bum rush, but we call it rat pack
On a nigga for nothin' at all
Ice Cube'll go stupid when I'm full of eight ball
I might stumble, but still won't lose
Now I'm dressed in the county blues
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
If you fuck with me, I'll put my foot in your ass
I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bailin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'?
[Interlude: Dr. Dre + MC Ren (The Jimmy Castor Bunch)]
Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit!
Man, what'cha gon' do now?
(What we're gonna do right here is go back)
How far you goin' back? (Way back)
""As we go a lil' somethin' like this""—hit it!

[Pre-Verse: Ice Cube]
Here's a little gangsta, short in size
A t-shirt and Levi's is his only disguise
Built like a tank, yet hard to hit
Ice Cube and Eazy-E cold runnin' shit

[Verse 4: Eazy-E]
Well, I'm Eazy-E, the one they're talkin' about
Nigga tried to roll the dice and just crapped out
Police tried to roll, so it's time to go
I creeped away real slow and jumped in the six-fo'
With the {diamond in the back, sun-roof top}
Diggin' the scene with the gangsta lean
'Cause I'm the E, I don't slang or bang
I just smoke motherfuckers like it ain't no thang
And all you bitches, you know I'm talkin' to you
""We want to fuck you, Eazy!"" I want to fuck you too
Because you see, I don’t really take no shit
So let me tell you motherfuckers who you're fuckin' with
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
If you fuck with me, I'll put a foot in your ass
I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bailin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'?

[Chorus: MC Ren + Sample]
Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yellin'
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Gangsta, Gangsta
He'll fuck up you and yours
And anything that gets in his way
Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yellin'
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Gangsta, Gangsta
He'll just call you a low-life motherfucker
And talk about yo' funky ways"
We Are Winning,Flobots,"['alternative', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Rival gangsters sit down to plan an after-school program
A religious fanatic posts footage of an interfaith service project
A group of teenage boys watches a video
Of a father playing catch with his son
An adult film star paints thumbnail portraits of elderly couples
Fully clothed and smiling
A record executive records a demo of his apology
A policeman makes reverse 911 calls
Instructing residents to take to the streets
A patriot reports for duty
She's wearing an orange jumpsuit and holding a picket sign
She's ashamed of her birthplace, but retreat is not an option

[Verse One]
Women and children, frontline, log on, tune in, stand and be counted
Wounded, stationed, in the belly of the vulture
Watch your back, there's no civilians
Women, children, frontline, listen
Consider this a distant, early warning
The fire's imminent, pollution, gathering dust particles
Funneling through smokestacks, airwaves, bandwidth
Disinformation tube-fed, check the labels
Delete the virus - alert the masses!
[Interlude]
Butterfly wing crosswinds, send Black Hawks toward hurricane survivors
Roses sprout from empty lots and sidewalk cracks
Pacifist guerrillas move undetected through concrete jungles
New forms are beginning to take shape
Once-occupied minds are activating
People are waking up! The insurgency is alive and well

[Verse Two]
Rise of the Flobots; portrait of the new American insurgent
Rattle and shake the foundations of the world order
Assembly line consent, resist, refuse, inform
Create, direct loved ones to the trenches
Suit up, forge rubble into fortresses
Plaster, cloth, aluminum, broken porcelain
Rusted platinum, burn bloodstains from decompressed diamonds
Hammer the battlecry into braille-studded armor

[Outro]
We are building up a new world, do not sit idly by
Do not remain neutral, do not rely on this broadcast alone
We are only as strong as our signal
There is a war going on for your mind
If you are thinking, you are winning
Resistance is victory, defeat is impossible
Your weapons are already in hand
Reach within you and find the means by which to gain your freedom
Fight with tools!
Your fate, and that of everyone you know, depends on it"

Warm skin against a cold night like my home life
Trade it for the strobe lights
Some tables where they bowl dice
Groupie, what your goals like?
You root for who the polls like
Tell holmes I'm known by everyone he know nice
And nothin' hurts worse
Than the cat that had to get told twice
Beat-battered, police at ya, soon as your feet gathers
Ground, they kickin' you down a weak ladder
You can't climb it, the climate gon' let the streets have ya
Or the cage or the grave: either way you'll be captured
In this maze while my legs when they raise don't leak faster
Than my age: if I could do it again, would I be made?
I mean, born to belong where these cowards ain't too strong
Do you harm in the long-run, you just want be awesome
But ha! It's awful, you niggas is lawful
Them people askin' questions and everyone's resourceful
I pinned this mic, the lies glittered in ice
To buy women for prices of high livin' is light

Illegal searches and round-ups

From a infant to a toddler, to a boy with no father
That void pushed me to go farther
No, I don't harbor harsh feelings or bother
With the lames, I just put my pains in entendres
And I ponders on the thoughts of my legacy
I wonder: if they eyes caught, would I let 'em see?
Will I ever be mentioned with the greatest?
If I does, will I ever be loved by all the haters?
And will my neighbors tell 'em what I stood for?
How I went from being my grandmama's good boy
To the man whose word was so credible
Got promoted from a soldier to a general
And no revenue can ever make me compromise
I turn down these bird clowns when they offer lies
See, I taught the guys to rise and reach for the skies
With that I shall live on and be immortalized
It's why I'm fortified amongst all the Gods
Who walk with pride and honor and wear 45's
Who would die behind bars before they signed
Affidavit the thought got me mortified
How you snitch and you look inside your daughter's eyes?
And y'all address them as G's, it's unauthorized
Before my demise I'ma stand tall
They gon' draw your man on the wall, 'cause I'm a legend

I see trouble in the mornin'
But take my death into the dawn
My name shall live on

Rappers got no point, niggas miss the free throws so
Ain’t no mystery why there picking me for
I’ve been hot since ’97, I ain't Mr Cee though
I am Mr NC boy, with the pen destroy any emcee boy
I’m skinny, didn’t eat so I’m hungry like a hostage
Finally seeing money so it’s funny how they eyes lit
Surprise it's, that nigga that you should have been on
I handed you niggas my demo, dawg I couldn’t get on
One time for my city bitch I’m putting it on
Like a condom when I’m with your girl, ballin’ like it’s intramural
Back in middle school, hoopin’ to impress the girls
We was young and disconnected from the rest of World
I reminisce on Andrea, eh, God bless ya girl
She used to let me sit in class and caress her curves
Help a nigga get through puberty, the lessons learned
From her, wasn’t nothing like it
We passed notes, she read minds like a fucking psychic and write back
I was the class clown, I told jokes and hope she liked that
Rode the bus home and wonder how it be to pipe that
If I was just a little faster I know I could have smashed her
But was just a virgin, couldn’t make it past flirting
Now I’m taking baths with their naked ass jerkin
""Make It Last Forever"" playing in the background
You can take it as whatever I was laying that down
She gon' hate my ass forever, I ain't bring her back round
But hold up, what you expect it, how you feeling all neglected?
Sending all them text'es, spillin all your stresses
We knew just what this was before I was feeling on your breast’es
I never disrespected, I’m clever nigga check it
I tried to warn these women, guess they never get the message
This is Cole, ain't nothing like it
So girls don’t wanna fuck him, now they wanna f-ckin’ like him
And hope he fucking wife em
[Break]
Yeah, nuttin’ like him
Yeah, ooh, yeah, oh

[Verse 2]
Ain't no other, ain't no other niggas
A-ain't no, ain't no other niggas fucking with me
Rappers throwin’ jabs but it feel like nothing hit me
Fake niggas, snake niggas I think something bit me
Scratch that, can’t impersonate perfection man
But I can school you, this here is the lesson plan
Now uh uh apparently, some of y’all comparing me
Either you blind as hell or either you just don’t care to see
Don’t make me pull the trigger I think you niggas is daring me
Go fuck around and get your new favorite rapper embarrassed, see
I’m the supplier of that fire and the kerosene
Don’t wanna make a scene, those ain't no shots fired
Just know the shit that I’m dropping, take you a lot higher
These niggas bitches on the low, they Mrs. Doubtfire
How can you doubt fire, man if you brave enough then come put it out Sire
The South by your side, this the mouth for your eyes
You niggas spit it with no one to vouch for your lies
I spit it how you see it, but ain't had the words to say it
I spit it how you think it but ain't had the balls to speak it
I put it out, sit around and let the world critique it
Until the fans up on it early like a nigga leaked it
Just know you fucking with the best, this be our little secret
Until the world find out and then y’all gotta shed me
Til then just know there's nothing like him and there's nothing near me
Yeah you fucking hear me, nigga
Yeah, yeh"

Are we there yet? Hell yeah, okay cool, we finally home

[Verse 1: XV]
Okay I’m back on my B.I., aw so plug in your two D.I’s
Lets take these niggas where I reside
The W-I-C-H is I, the greatest from my sis-side
The truest, you deny, than who is, down to blow like a match to a bomb
I set fire to the web, Match.com, we going up, you coming?
Better grab my arm to the place I ran, I’m the black Saddam
No wonder these bad bitches wanna hang
On a niggas’ ass like the bitches on my jeans
Riches on sag and my fitted on lean
Another album in the can, doing what you niggas can’t
Setting flames around here like So Glow
Played the game, say yes to a city that they don’t know
Right next to KC like JoJo, you phone everybody, says tell ‘em I am home bro
[Hook 2]
Look at where we at, look at where we been
Look at every place we roamed, don’t know where you at
I’m all over the map but right now, we finally home
Are we there yet? Hell yeah, are we there yet? Hell yeah
Are we there yet? Hell yeah, okay cool, we finally home
Car service on its way to me, brand new jeans with all room keys
We home but where haven’t we been? Tell shawty to get lost or get in
For the win, been gone for so damn long, passports and a carry on
Trying to be home, where haven’t we been? Tell shawty to get lost or get in

[Verse 2: XV]
Even Christ isn’t passsionate as I am
Bel to the air, Fresh Prince Will-I-Am
What you see, look at me from the sky cam?
A couple girls named Mary and a Tri-Lam
Every since I got my deal, I feel high as a necrophobiac’s light bill
Sleep on me like night quilts and I'mma get out my dreams
Without Ye or a Nyquil, now open up your pupils for your mentors
I’m coming for your soul like Dementors
With the hood on my back like the Sith Lords
Made it on top of my foes like fifth floor
Now stand up like a judge when you know the ending
‘Cause my Rockets come home like Toyota center
The hottest loser and the coldest winner
Turn the street lights on, I’ll be home for dinner
[Hook 2]

[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly]
Kells!
Say goodbye to the street lights, bye to the I can’t eat nights
So hello to new countries and new languages, I can’t speak right
Falling out the sky like cheap kites and now I’m in that um...
I’m don’t know, I'm bad with cars, but my backseat got some of the baddest broads
And up front, I got my fam with me, Cleveland with me
Two L’s and Cool J like Def Jam’s with me
I’ve been all around the world and back
Now I play all around the world with Shaq
One touch of this blunt right, here, pushed the curtains back
Feel like Aladdin with this Persian mat, blow O’s with XV
Head to the coast to jet ski and anywhere I go, my set be
EST tattooed right above my chest P, respect me or skate like Gretzky

Soon as I enter, you know who it is-a
It’s the representer from the east-side of Atlanta
That’s known as Decatur
I got my own lane, but I can’t see the road
My rear view mirror’s full of haters
Wouldn’t wanna be ya, it's me they cannot battle
Yes I’m a mothership and you a boat without no paddles
Yes I am what they after, I’m a natural born disaster
I’m the reason your momma tell you not hang with rappers
But your momma is a minister and I'm her favorite rapper
Probably cause she found out that my daddy was a pastor
I wonder what she’s after, but don’t get it confused
There's no surprise, it’s just another day in my shoes

Yeah, well these niggas salty, high blood pressure
Well if you got that sodium, nigga I got that pepper (Dr. Pepper)
Don’t step up, please fall back
Y’all can’t ball, all y’all are whack
Haters need hugs, you thugs need love
And groupies fall in holes that gold diggers dug
These niggas cynical cause I’m on that medicinal
Why they so sensitive? I guess they on their menstruals
I don’t need no, come consider the general
Regardless of my genre, yes, I’m flawless, man, in general
When I’m in the club, girls be jigging on they tippy toes
So she take me in like her vitamins and minerals
You ain't on my signal, you analog or digital
Grand Hustle champion, someone turn my anthem on
When my jam come on, God damn I blow straight up
I am a bomb
Leaping over barriers like this was a triathlon

Now I’m the everyday topic
Under a microscope so now I’m feeling microscopic
My shit was fading to black, niggas thought I was gothic
But made it to the next step like recovering alcoholics
I bounce back like a Snoop Deville with hydraulics
Ain't ""Nuthin' But A G Thang"", nigga I’m the king of pain
Veins filled with Novocaine, so I ain't even feeling y’all
I ain't even hearing y’all, fingernails on a blackboard
They say the pen is way mightier than the sword
So I’mma spaz out to get inside the mental ward
Then get my Grammy awards
'Til your faith is restored by the lord of this rap shit
Niggas got it backwards, let's line up all the factors
Grew up in the hood, but was raised in the 'burbs
Where pops wasn't there so the military made me a man
And they told me to put my dreams in the can
But I still made it here, damn!

Fuck that, bring hip hop back to New York city
Get busy with the white grizzly, wiggy wiggy wiggy
Blowtorch leave ya ass crispy - hidden delivery
No tricking me with evil and trickery, history, misery
Mystery like Agatha Christie
My enemies wanna physically cripple me, bitch strictly
Specifically wordplay, Slick Ricky, I'm slicker than Slick Ricky
I'm the top notch, the elite, we meet, me defeat
Me be beat, repeat in this street life is cheap
Baa baa black sheep, no shoes, dirt black feet, pack heat
Track meet run from cops, ghetto athlete
I'm back that deep, you lack lyrical heat

I used to sneak in windows and steal Nintendos
Pimp hoes, white mandingos, I wear black, I don't wear pink clothes
Suffolk county anything goes
Why you trying to copy my shit like Kinkos?
I drop brickloads, sick flows, I done did those
Hit hoes, ripped shows, quotables kicked those
All the criminal shit and the sinning
They wanna know do I have a religion
Is there a god, do I believe in him?
Oh yes, how the fuck else could I be so blessed?
God put me on this earth to be one of the best (of all time)
And don't question it, it's a definite
The all time best in it, kept in it, repping it
The last one left in it
I'm A plus, you get a F in it

Caucasoid, leprosy, lepedist, method in repping this
Fresher, so fresh in this, catching the specialist
I'm ol' D, special K, treacherous, I'm supaaa

Stop and stare, American nightmare
I'm super duper, I'm the newschool
Of the oldschool school

Ayo, I'm serious, I'm not the type to joke a lot
Dressed in all black, never seen in polka dots
No other write rhymes like these
I'm cool as a light breeze, I'm playin' rappers out like striped Lees
I'm smoother than velvet, my lyrics are well-writ
You sayin', ""L's this,"" and, ""L's that""—get off L' dick
I don't roll with punks I only roll with live guys
And we do drivebys in 325is
I had beef with this thief named Randolph
Now he's in a casket dressed up with his hands crossed
So you better leave L alone
Before I reach out and touch you but not with a telephone
Yo I'm the brother that you never even thought of beatin'
Black white or Puerto Rican, I'm gonna slaughter each and

I damage all opponents as soon as the bell rings
It's all about me, yo it's a B. I. G. L thing
The crown is still mine cause I drop ill rhymes
A lot of rappers talk that murder shit and couldn't kill time
One two one two crews I run through
Fuck karate, Big L practice Gun Fu
Cause I'm a MC assassinator
I grab the mag and leave a nag leakin' like activator
Step to this and get shanked up
I knocked out so many teeth the tooth fairy went bankrupt
And I entertain well because of my brain cells
I'm naughty and stop callin' me shorty my name's L
My raps are hotter than the Bahamas
MC's be talkin' about breakin' jaws when they couldn't break a promise

Matter of fact, black, I'm puttin' Harlem on the map
Wassup cause I'm a stiggy star
Breakin' 'em up and then takin' they heart
You better believe that Big L is the man that be rippin' the microphones apart
I'm undefeated that's the stone truth
Cause battlin' me is like fightin' a gorilla in a phone booth
I take lives with no pride, I just committed a homicide
A punk brother died cause he tried
To take my cash but he didn't last, I pulled out fast
He tried to bash then I blast on his monkey ass (boom)
I make a lot of dough, I'm quick to spot a foe
Even if my grandma violate, she gotta go!
When I was young I played with guns, not a kiddy toy
Cause I'm a rough, rugged gangsta, not a pretty boy
Facts on tracks I recite well
Everybody wanna be like Mike, but Mike wanna be like L

Get back to the bus, it's the end of the night
Yeah, back to the bus and get out of my life
'Cause I got people to see, hoes as freaky as me

Slapped the bitch to my right, I said ""Click it or ticket""
Girl feeling my ride, now she's getting suspicious
This a brand new Miata as I'm hitting them switches
I ride behind Charlie as he's popping a wheelie
I finally made it to the party, now he's copping a feely
See Da Kurlzz out front doing tricks on his Heelies (Hi, guys)
Now I'm finna get down, yelling ""somebody, beer me""

They didn't let us in, so we hopped a
Wall, but I dropped you, that's when I lost you

Razzi and they shot-a pictures of me and Dennis Hopper

Crunk juice and vodka, it's turning me into a monster
One more shot and I'm a goner

Deep-throated by piranhas

Y'all want problems, pursue it, let's do it
Infamous Mobb bosses, check out the portrait
At the round table, my Dunn speaking with his Twin ghost
It's gangster how we rock, while you watch
Attracted to our style, this is how we get down
With big jewelry and big guns
We get busy, it get grizzly, beat niggas bloody
Twist niggas fronting, get to running
Fore the mens get to dumping, the fans get to thumping
M-O-B-B got the whole spot jumping
When my niggas step in the place
Damn, you gotta love it
[Chorus: Lil' Kim]
Yo, it's the real shit
Shit to make you feel shit
Thump 'em in the club shit
Have you wilding out (hip-hop, hip-hop...) when you bump this
Drugs to your eardrum, the raw uncut
Have a nigga OD 'cause it's never enough

Yo, it's the real shit
Shit to make you feel shit
Thump 'em in the club shit
Have you wilding out (hip-hop, hip-hop...) when you bump this

[Verse 1: Shyheim]
Nowadays you gots to walk the street and watch your back
'Cause brothers with the gats don't be knowing how to act
They always pull a Glock when somebody rocks a knot
And if they get shot they often snitch to the cops
Now tell me this ain’t living foul
She just had a baby child and she’s back to selling cracks vials
On the Ave cause she’s addicted to the fast cash
How long will that last before the cops be up in that ass?
But honey-dip don't wanna listen 'cause she’s in a position
That nobody gives a pot to piss in
Her life is stuck and filled with bad luck
So she fucks and fucks to earn another buck
She don't really care about pride
And she jumps into another ride then committing suicide
[Chorus: June Luva]
Aiyo, this goes on and on Shy
Everybody's doin' their own thing from hookering to drug slang

[Verse 2: Shyheim]
Times is getting hard, word is bond I swear God
I even got caught tryna steal from the junkyard
A born terror, a Rebel without a Pause
I never had a good Christmas, so who is Santa Claus?
I walk the streets at night with my head down
In this little town you see clowns that wanna be down
So they get a Glock and lick shots to get props
And when shit rocks all you can hear is the shells drop
An old man got shot in a parking lot
In front of my building I hang with his grandchildren
And for the nigga that pulled the trigger and tried to slide
And hide, but he got knocked by the homicide
And this happens everyday around my way
So I pray that I can live another day
[Chorus: June Luva]
Aiyo, this goes on and on Shy
Everybody's doin' their own thing from hookering to drug slang

This goes on and on Shy
Everybody's doin' their own thing from hookering to drug slang

[Verse 3: Shyheim]
Aiyo, get a load of this guy, you know the Mr. Hardy?
The one who talks about gats but ain't' busting nobody
He speaks that yang yang so we can just maintain
I'd blow him out the frame at his moms if he gangbang
But his rep is hi-tech in the projects
Foe was knuckle jacked, so he got mad respect
The niggas in hoodies packed up their loaded gats
Met up in the back so they could plan the attack
Wasn't hard to tell that these kids was no joke
They let the pistol smoke and their .9 was doper than coke
I seen it happen everyday where I live
I know a few bums, drug dealers, most of them fugitives

[Chorus: June Luva]
Aiyo, this goes on and on Shy
Everybody's doin' their own thing from hookering to drug slang
This goes on and on Shy
Everybody's doin' their own thing from hookering to drug slang
Aiyo, this goes on and on Shy
Everybody's doin' their own thing from hookering to drug slang
This goes on and on Shy
Everybody's doin' their own thing from hookering to drug slang"

Check it out now...
I work the pen to make the ink transform
On any particular surface the pen lands on
Zaakir is hands on, what's the beef?
The Cooley High Cochise high post techniques
I drape off poetic landscapes and shapes
Illustrate the paper space off the pens that paint
Then design what have a National Geographic a magic
With tailor-made status and plus flavor that's automatic

We're not balling
We take it back to the days of yes y'all-in'

Melancholy mundane so I tame the hot flame
Big rings, fat chains, and y'all quest for the same
No name, use fame, strictly new to the thang
We stay true to the game and never bring it to shame
We tight like dreadlocks or red fox and ripple
We pass participles, and smash the artist in you
The saga continues, this I won't get into
Cause there ain't enough bars to hold the drama that we been through

[Verse 3: Akil]
Yo...
We still the same with a little fame
A little change in the household name but ain't too much changed
We in the game but, yo not to be vain
I refrain from salt grains to season up my name
We entertain for a mutual game from close range
Steady aim, I drum at your head to hit the brain
I'm labor ready, Rhode Scholar for the dollar
Work for mines pay me by the hour

Loser,Beck,"['rock', 'alternative', 'metal']","[Verse 1]
In the time of chimpanzees, I was a monkey
Butane in my veins, and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the loveseat
Someone came, saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Double barrel buckshot)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
[Verse 2]
The forces of evil in a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with the phony gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel, and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey neck, and it's hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beat, for the body, for the heat
And my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite
Who's choking on the splinters

Light bill, phone bill plus my granny nerve pills
Feel like I should be takin' them, imagine how my nerves feel

Blues for the Horn,K'naan,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","In a conservative form
I wanna ask you a few things before I conform
To the popular belief about where I was born
Are they still illin', still killin' poppin' the corn?
How's the horn, how's the love wavin' the ocean morn'?
How 'bout the young, do they still possess the poetry tongue?
And do they still greet sincere like the depth of the lung""
How's the nomad, did the herd graze well this year?
From the news to what I know, the growin' gap ain't clear!
How's the earth, how 'bout the stars under we conversed?
Do you still await on change like a new moon's birth?
Does it still flood ancient wisdom parallel with blood?
Do you still see the pain of vision holy/only scriptkeeper?
Or did you fight off the plight of the colonized mind?
What of the rainy season, do the kids still bury seeds?
And get taken with uncertainty like me scared of leavin? '
How are the poets, the women and the orphans torn?
I miss 'em all like, old opportunities gone
What of the elders, story tellers in abandoned homes
Miss 'em all like, childhood, reminisce with songs
Disputes, do they still settle 'em by bloodying shoes?
Fist rules, rather finger equipped with sick tools
What of the wind, I recall it was serenity's end
When the breeze would come and the trees would bend
And the people would say ""look what it leads with sin""
And the air was violent and our care was silent
And the only law we bore was of pair of tyrants
Man you know, this is why I'm down in deep indigo
And I sleep really poor, on the circumstance floor
Anyway, how's stress, does it still rule your chest?
Do the camps still rape girls with no breasts?
Our moms, are they still screaming ""put away the arms""?
And against the dispossession of their family-owned farms
How are the many rivers and the lakes and the seas?
Are they still angry with us for our poisonous deeds?
And the lakes and the seas
For our poisonous deeds
[Hook]
This is my blues for the horn, for the horn
This is my blues for the horn, for the horn
This is my blues for the horn, for the horn

So who's dead and who's alive, did the rates multiply?
Did the poor fight the drought with their minimum supply?
Did the warlords abort the wars and for supporting the peace, they force
To promote disease and easening 'creased divorce?
What of police and courts, are they still even in force?
Leaking pores and cheatedly to the bleeding corpse
What of the kind and good, can they still, laugh intensely
Like the, mind and word or is it, innocense lost as I understood
And what of the playwrights, reflection in the scapes of great sights
Revolution from power's the writings of brave fights
Despite the luxury that you hear(d) we live by
I head with refuges and niggers ain't share right, and
Don't you play soccer by the ocean front?
In America, I shovel the snow while I'm smoking blunts
You mean to tell me that you out there still totin' guns?
Bloating sons of the hardened, hardly copin' moms
Damn you and circumstance too I can't stand you
You make a mockery of our struggle like hollywood plans do
And I swear to god I wish you hell, burn and bake too
And I curse the Europeans who instigated you worse
And I curse the Russians who impregnated the kalashnikov birth
And hurts you never wake and see the destiny
It's like the conflict of self, submerged in satanic hate
Remember eatin' food, walking back in hot sun from school
Bare feet, the hot sand, massaging our feet is
Cause now my mother slips on the ice and her back is weak
And I feel like a failure, a mute in the age of speech
Look at me, yo! look at me, look dead in the eyes
Don't flinch, you are an accomplice to great white lies
I can't even begin to express how breakdown and stressed
I gotta live to tell, give me a bullet-proof vest

I got a question, can anybody answer it
Who gotta flow sicker than Canibus if he was cancerous
Cameras get to flashing with
Every single new fan I get
Granny gets her panties wet
Seducing your mom ‘til the family splits
I’m on a mission to take each girl
Ride her strong, I’ve been savage like Boy Meets World
Jump On It like Apaches
I’m screamin' out Geronimo
Obama flow, if you got bars I’m shuttin' em down, Guantanamo
I speak the truth and that’s why you scared
To MC's, I’m E; you see I’m you squared
And my bars is too heavy I don’t need no muscle
I put pride in my tracks and I ain’t talking ‘bout Russell
My new shit is too hot
Y’all dudes be the phoniest
I’m too sick, my flu shot will give y’all dystonia

I think they bitin' but I don’t mind 'em or pay attention
The blaze is dying so they need DyMer for some assistance
And they’re just tight because their subscribers is single digits
For the losers I exude super fresh
The tits embedded like the implants that’s in her hooters
I know I’m random but, what’s more, your marketing scandal
Or attempted diss and then soundin’ like Soulja Boy Jr
I’m skeetin’ on your forum
Your blog can give me a b-job as I generate a code for support

Gotta bigger brain than Lil' Wayne
Make Drizzy sound like Lil' Zane
Make Eminem sound simple and throw Kanye out the window pane
I don’t mean no disrespect
Recognize this kid is next
The internet’s a little step to record execs and bigger checks
Serve the world a la carte
See my victims fall apart
Y’all got fifteen seconds got long distance on my calling card
Rockwell over thousand shows
Shock foreigners from round the globe
Apocalypse flow 2012
Y’all never heard Dumbfoundead though
Let me teach y’all a thing or two
Make y’all look like English students
Never thought you needed tutors, until you heard the teacher’s stupid
Witness a man in his prime
Doing his shit one fan at a time

Do I want this shit forever?
Or just a couple seasons
Maybe neither
Maybe I should crash my jeep now
And wake from dreamin’
I’m doing eighty even speeding down these corners burning rubber
I can feel Satan breathing down my neck
They’re just pleading for me to stop but I can’t
This shit is crazy
And there’s the cops, aww fuck I can’t believe it
I ain’t stopping no
I ain’t going back up in that prison
Plus I left the heater underneath the seat since the weekend
See you wonder why us famous people always stay with needles
It's cause this life right here is crazy homie, believe it
After I sign a deal I didn’t have to raise a finger
Everybody did what I said
‘cause what I said they believed it
All them fellas show me love
And all the women show me cleavage
The kids knew all my songs word for word and said I was Jesus
But I wasn’t leading them to freedom
I was teaching them to keep reaching for things
With no significance and meaning
It was greed that made me poison my own people with these records
I gotta end it all fuck it no more being selfish
The bridge is just after this intersection
So do I want this shit forever
Nah, just a couple more seconds

Shut it down
Boom. I'mma show all you I ain’t fuck around
And now the end is near
Put you all in trembling fear
To all you who think I’m cocky and fucking obnoxious
Let me just get this clear
That shit is old news
I don’t bow to no dude
Wanna call me cocky
Come and put yourself in my cold shoes
A punch line doesn’t make me major or ruthless
All I need to do is be real into what I say in my music
They used to make fun of my dreams
And they would say that they’re stupid
But now I mastered entertainment
Bet you name it I do it
And I’ve crossed so much in this field to get success
I wonder when the fuck am I gonna really give up yet
But people call me out and think I stand there
But fuck that
It’s time to take a stand ‘cause I’m a man with enough stress
Inspired generations
Show everyone I’m famous

It's just entertainment!

I'm not saying this to blame you I'm saying
I'm not saying this to play you I'm saying
It's all good when we making love
All I ask is don't take our love for granted
It's granted My love for you is real
If you don't love me somebody else will
Baby girl don't you ever oh no get too
Get to comfortable

Now ain't the bed comfy when you sleep
Don't your ass stay here for the free
It's the year of the G tho
You know how I be tho
Kick your ass out
And then I'm foul like a free throw
Call me crazy like Cee-Lo
4-5-6 chicks waiting like ceelo
Listening to them hoes
Get the boot like Timbo
Be missing the green
Like a fein for the indo
Don't act all low like limbo
My pie your slice like kimbo
Leave me and you dumb
Then slow
Gimme back my shit like a rental
Get out my face like a hair that's ingrown
Lotta brains never took you for a bimbo
A lotta lames you was rolling with a pimp tho
And I let you ride like I ride instrumentals
So you was saying you gonna leave me
Well take your time be easy
Cause girl you could never play me
Even if you listening to a Trey Day CD
Before I eject your disc
Let me know you this
I'm a family guy truly
But I could give a fuck about the dog or Stewie
[Hook:]
I'm not saying this to make you upset
I'm not saying this to play you I'm saying
It's all good wanna break it off
All I ask when I'm taking off
That you handle it
Can you handle it
I don't need you for real
And though I loved you
Somebody else will
Cause you mustve got to comfortable

You know I got a lot a love for ya
Like I’m on drugs for you
So addicted but I know I can kick this
That’s why I’m talking big shit
The way you lick them lips and ya hips would say
Nigga I know you gone miss this
But baby I wonder
How you gonna sleep without ya sleep number 69
Freaky time
You get it on the normal you and I were porno live
We got it in all night
And I tell you this
The way you talking all that mess
Make me wanna pull up that dress
Bend your ass over on the furniture
You think that you gonna leave wit
I all inside you secrets you say keep it
While I go deepest in ya river
Get to flowing better than that nigga jigga
Going all in and then it bend like tigga
Ya be on ya job getting hard like liquor
So whats up baby you gonna pack up
Or you gonna fall back what
You wanna do
I wanna do you right now
Baby make a move

I’m not saying this to make you upset

Untouchable Drunk Freestyle,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
It’s 'Pac, Makaveli
I'm in the studio drunk than a motherfucka
Ready to freestyle this shit, and do it wild
Live, for all my dogs
Fo all my dogs out there raisin' hell
Just to see a young nigga raise the bail
Stepped out on the streets fresh from jail
All the police wanna rag and tell
Not knowin’ that I stacks my mail, uh
All these niggas wanna see me fail, uh
That’s just the intro
As I sit back and rock this instrumental, uh

[Verse]
After the fire comes the rain
After pleasure there’s pain
Even though we're broke for the moment
We'll be ballin’ again
Time to make your, my military be prepared for the bustas
Similar to bitches that's scary, get too near me then rush 'em
Visions of overpacked prisons
Millions of niggas thug livin’
Precious, three strikes, hope they don’t tell us
They pull a heater, ammunition in grace
Shh, move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place
They got me feenin’ for currency, the money be callin’ me
It’s like I’m dreamin’, seeing scenes of me ballin’
Participated in this felonious behavior
Got the cocked 4-5, snatchin’ niggas' pagers
Labeled a mark, soon as we start, it was hard to quit
Started out drinkin’ 40s, moved to harder shit
Goddamn, now I’m a grown man
I follow no man, nigga, got my own plan
In my hand got the .45, I kick it live to survive
Make these niggas die, while gettin’ high, though we cry
When these thugs bomb, niggas’ll leave in their caskets
That’s what you get for being playa hatin’ bastards
Me and my clique so legit
We keep a 50 on us, niggas know
You can’t touch us
When they get to come against us
These niggas be defenseless, it’s senseless
Knockin’ niggas back on the fences
My whole clique be sick
And though we rip whole crews
Niggas knew we came through drinkin’ 22’s of brew
And though we drink Hennessys
We provide our enemies with mo’ shit
The art of war so legit
I read, my name out, Makaveli
With the Thug Life tatted on the bottom of my belly
Can these niggas understand this?
My whole family is sick and so scandalous
Let's me introduce my clique:
Kastro, when he blasts y’all
Niggas run and hide
Napoleon will provide
The game
Let me explain why E.D.I
Provide shit, for the needy and take from the greedy
Kadafi, he not sloppy, and not a copy
He’s the only one, bring a gun, if you want it
Young Noble, bring the soul to the true
Let 'em know we come through in a bucket or BMW
We trouble you, the W for Westside
Niggas die when they try to infiltrate my crew
We never hide, we ride, and die, together
And when you see my clique we always ride forever
Me, my whole clique is sick, we smoke sinsimi'
Can you convince the G, that they could come against me?
You can see me on TV or live
Niggas die when they try to come against me
Never hide
In my own zone, in my own dome, in my mind I’m a don
Nigga knew it once I came armed, I
Splashed on niggas
Will I dash on niggas?
Once I mash these figures, I'll be badder, nigga
It’s me, Makaveli, aka ""The Don of this whole clique""
Niggas, you so sick
That’s my freestyle drunken flow
Just so you bitch ass niggas in the back row know
Whether it’s New York or Texas, ride through in a Lexus
Or BMW, I trouble you, throwin’ up forever this big ol’ W
Huhhuhhuhhuhu
My double R proves I’m a big rap star
Rockin’ the grooves, niggas where ya at, where ya are
Is the back, in the front, when ya bump this shit
I keep a gat inside my trunk legit
Always, though I’m on probation, I still rock the nation
Out on bail, though last year I was in jail
Raise hell, until I get my mail
Will I fail? Hell nah, nigga, bite my nails
I keep a manicure, though you panic
You’re still gon' die, when Pac get high
Smokin’ indo, I roll my window down
A smooth criminal, and though I pack this pound
3-5-7 or 4-5
Will I hide? Will I die? Will I ride?
Niggas never know why
My whole crew, a family clique
Are we sick? Are we live?
Though we struggle to survive
In this motherfuckin’ ‘95 turn to ‘96, ’96 turn to ‘97
I keep a 3-5-7, MAC-11
Back home I got a M-R
What did I say, a Mini-14? Haha, my double R
Ride with my clue, ride with my crew
You don’t have a clue, nigga, when we’re comin’ for you
We hit the House of Blues, actin,’ like fools, my nigga Fatal
Put a gun inside his club, I keep this fucker prenatal
Had a banger inside his chest, nah nah
Banger inside his belly, nah nah nah
It was Makaveli that told him to bring that gat outside his belly
I say, ""Yo, Fatal, what are you crazy?""
Niggas pissin’ outside in the front
Niggas sayin' ""Goddamn, them niggas is funny as hell""
What you want? You want some funk?
Hell nah, them niggas don’t want no beef
That’s why we left that motherfucker in a Rolls, a Limo, I mean
With bitches inside too
Me? I was chillin’ in the back, drinking on some Hennessy
I just did a dope ass show, them niggas will always remember me
Came from Italy, bellisimo, was the call
Yeah, nigga, I got Versace, Armani
All them niggas wanna fuck with me, y’all know
I always represent my people to the fullest
Yeah, I'm that same motherfucker took five bullets
Count em, came out, rappin’ and stealin’
And makin’ five motherfuckin' records got sold, millions millions
Haha, platinum, I made five platinum shits, know what I’m sayin’
Niggas, can’t fuck with me, 2Pacalypse, not known for playin', huh
I took shots, and gave shots, fuck the cops
Will I stop, until my shit, reach the top? Hmm
Niggas out there wanna do me
Whether it's Mobb Deep, Bad Boy or The Fugees, hahahahaha
Y’all niggas’ll never stop me, never drop me, never make me fall
Me, 2Pacalypse, all I know how to do is BALL BALL BALL!
My crew, survive reincarnation after I’m dead
They'll rock and roll and bring the funk to the whole nation
And you know
Each one of these niggas have a gun wit' my name on it, you know
I spit the game so clear it's plain on it, you know, huh
When I’m dead, my niggas’ll ride for me, kill everybody

Yelling at the trees, like, ""Hey, hi, Mister!""

Dig this: I'll get a shovel and strike sisters
And kick 'em when the handle starts digging in my blisters
Sick, cynical cyanide spitter
So when I kick rhymes, my victims die quicker
I'm broke, no cheese, my hoes crackered
(Snort third verse, ""Pigions"") I'll show you a dope rapper
I'll shit on a nigga with no bladder
Then throw it in his eyes to show him he don't matter
The night creeper in a nice white Jeep-er
With three white divas who snort and like penis
I'm hotter than at least five heaters
In the middle of the summer with a sleeved wife-beater
Purebred degenerate, gentleman
Little Aryan n*gger with hairy clit for dinner
It's Wolf Gang, triple six, niggas on that simple shit
I'm on a fucking spree, burning bodies in a rental whip
Wolf Gang rad, no bum-ass shit

Officers in the trunk with six other cops
No way that I'll stop, they'll arrest me after
Fix the scene just to put me on screen like an actor
Shit, no need to tell me, I know it's hot—
As weather where them bitches wear bikinis with polka dots
It's overly overkill, because my niggas know a lot
'Bout taping and raping and throwing overboard from a yacht
So now, they probably hate me, but that's why the fuck I'm here
And you should man up, there's no need to be sincere, faggot
Heard that you were queer, so why would you fuck with wolves
That'll leave you on the ground like your rap career? Ha, ugh
So you don't want it—don't start none
We're fuckin' Radical, been Fucking Awesome
Talked a lot of shit so, for words, you're at a loss
Raised enough money just to get someone to kill my boss

Aiyo, what up homie, it's Tony, revenge is so sweet
And I move with artillery, roaming the streets
My guns is ginormous, bullets is heatseeking
Big Brother got the eye on me, I watch how I'm speaking
And I move like a porn star in charm school
I stick everything I see, but I only take jewels
And cash rules, pills and that cocaine powder
I ain't a man, I'm a killer, obsessed with power
And revenge, I don't need friends and shiesty activities
Move alone through the City that they call Liberty
And trust nobody but my bullets and my shotty
Carjack a fool twist his limbs like pilates
Ox' him, buck 50 stitch him, Chinatown Wars

Blow your horn and get pounded out by the boring

Any king that bring this sting for Chung King
No change, no stranger to gats
Took notice, what so strange is no cats

Fuck the boss, drowned on blood and duck sauce
Stuck the enemy, a wack deal caper

No action, all flame
It's D to the C, no practice, all game
And not the game that your computer came installed with
So ditch the lame Twit you are currently involved with
The Derrick Boys a bunch of crazy brothers like the Baldwins
Echo motherfucker, you are just another dolphin
Hello motherfucker, like I walked in on incest
Do it motherfucker, talking does not impress
Us, man, us
It's all about us
Like them self absorbed teen girls talking on the bus
We trust you to pay when we ask you to pay
Til then, Chili Peppers, we give it away
I don't fuck the fans, I am not the industry
Man, I hate it when the man comes between you and me
I don't masturbate, I give a handjob to a star and
Picture you bumping out this anthem in your car
Still showing up for our dorks, geeks, losers
Rode out from New York on six beach cruisers
And if we could we'd ride with every kid right on the handlebars
We are just some rappers like some fat kid ate the candy bars

Yes I'm back with a whole new attitude
Flier than a Cardinal, check my fuckin' latitude
Yes I'm so sick man, somebody call the doctor
Girls stay wet like I'm fucking with a lobster
I stopped talking I'm tired of paying em lip service
Switched over them street niggas to hipsters
I am so different, Donald Glover in the bitch
I don't need to use my rapper name, that's just Childish
And they used to call me Oreo, dunk me in that milk
Maybe then I will be white enough to hang out with them kids
They have to call you names when they don't know what you are
Now they know just what I are, baby girl I am a star
APC kicks, looking like a British boy
More money means more problems, I have been annoyed
Dude mad bout the girl that I came with
I'm fly, she fly, you are just penguin
I am just a rapper so I don't speak English
I just go hard like the traffic light changes
Sick boy, bitch, we the clique like seat belts
Yes I'm on fire I don't have to ask how heat felt
When I was 14, man nobody else was thinking this
A nigga off the chain, man I Abraham Lincoln'd this

I am just different
Motherfucker, I'm different
Yeah, I am just different
Yeah, I am just different"

Where my Shaolin peoples at?
Stapleton, the craziest, y'all know what time it is
Wild wild West
Now born, Killa Hill, port to the Richmond
Jungle Nilz, let's get money y'all

[Verse 1: Shyheim]
It be the Cess and Hennessey that make me act like this
I'm wild hit ‘em up projects style never plead the fifth
Regardless, to the charges, chickenheads will be at court
Fightin’ and slicin’ each other to see who lies at my fort
Who woulda thought, little Shy Big Willie
Ninety-six we rollin dutches, nine-trey it was Phillies
First of the month be like Christmas to dealers
Hundred dollar sales come through the school zone area
Children at play keep the heat on the low
Little kids getting’ hit, projects flooded with po'
Now shorty's rockin’, Versace and Donna Karan
Playin’ the Miss Mob Queen role knowin’ hon the cousin Sharon
I live the glamorous life, girl
To go from limos with Don Perignon, rich hotels

Facing two-five to life incarcerated activated
Stressed behind a cell with no way to escape it
Holdin' on, true to 'ock steel tryin' to appeal
Be landed without a bail so let the commisary reveal
I feel it's time, for me to let this sparklin' wine
Wet my throat rockin’ the trenchcoat, flashin' to get mine
Not hesitant, cause the Henny keeps me bent
Just tryin’ to make a cent, diggin’ pockets down to the lint
Regardless of all the charges the D's want me for
Warrant after warrant, so I avoid the law
Stapleton on the rise, twenty-seven where it lies
From day one until they none don't take it as no surprise

I'm havin’ suicidal thoughts cause I'm screwed up in the game
But today's thang, is to hold it down and maintain
I got thirty days until I get remanded for this gun charge
Still I'm livin’ large, joint hard up in the mode and
Sexin', this European model
I'm young black rich and dangerous, livin’ like I won the lotto
So ‘nough of wine sex and dutches
Them kids know who us is
GP Wu, hundred-twenty-seven hustlers
Runnin’ from D's when they try to bust us
Fly crimes and gats, mainly black cops, them faggots love us
And my district attorneys wanna send me to jail

I bust ‘em dead and not to injure

And ain't grow up in the same hood as Common Sense
And opportunities so usually we're not convinced
That we can be all, that we can be
Nah, the only nigga that made it was good at b-ball, and shit he ain't even graduate
And that's the norm so the parents ain't that ashamed
To broke to even dream, now ain't that a shame
Safe to say it ain't the best place to be

My Uncle,ILL BILL,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Uncle Howie]
My life is... I'm dependent, I can't help it. I started at a young age, I'm too dependent on it, you know? Drugs and music get me where I wanna go now. But I gotta make the money for it, and it's not that easy, nowadays...

[Chorus: ILL Bill]
My uncle shoots heroin, my father used to do cocaine
My moms used to smoke weed with her friends when I was eight
Smoked weed when I was twelve, sold weed at fourteen
Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity
Conscious rap is bullshit, gangster rap is a fraud
This is real rap, bang your fucking head through the wall
This is drug music, stuck with a syringe in your arm
I'm the truth like the name of the song
Yo my uncle shoots heroin

[Verse 1: ILL Bill]
Bathroom floor, found a syringe
When I was on the Hiero Tour Howie went out on a binge
The snake bitch I was fucking even took him to cop
A month later he was on the floor looking for rock
Missed a flight to Czech Republic, walked in the path
Of Howie lying in his own puke, dying from crack
Cocaine poisoning, he shot the heroin since fourteen
February 2003, he was clean
I helped him out, he kicked crack, dope, and meth
Hosted shows, free clothes, bubble baths, autographs
T-shirts, soon I'm a make a Howie action figure
Before his latest relapse, I'm glad I captured pictures
I love Howie, homie used to change my diapers
To save him I'd have jumped in front of spray from snipers
But this is just something that he's gotta do on his own
I try to get through to him with this song, yo
[Chorus: ILL Bill]
My uncle shoots heroin, my father used to do cocaine
My moms used to smoke weed with her friends when I was eight
Smoked weed when I was twelve, sold weed at fourteen
Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity
Conscious rap is bullshit, gangster rap is a fraud
This is real rap, bang your fucking head through the wall
This is drug music, stuck with a syringe in your arm
I'm the truth like the name of the song, yo
My uncle shoots heroin

[Verse 2: ILL Bill]
He used to live in my crib, sleep on my couch smoking Newport 100's
Gave me comic books, bought me my first bass guitar
Learned from my grandma how to tell you the future with cards
Watch the Sci-Fi Channel high off of methadone
More addictive than anything injected in the arm
D.T.'s five in the morning, waking my moms
Got a search warrant but Howie Tenenbaum is gone
Roaming the streets, he was a superhero to me
When I was five, I used to pick the seeds out of his weed
Nodding out, burning cigarette holes in his sheets
Wake up and eat a box of Captain Crunch, then go back to sleep
He was a crackhead too, he might still be
A walking relapse, that motherfucker's still on the street
You tell him right, he goes left
Show him right, he does wrong
I hope I get through to him with this song, yo

My uncle shoots heroin, my father used to do cocaine
My moms used to smoke weed with her friends when I was eight

Call Me Moon Man,Kid Cudi,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Yea the man and the myth
The whispers the gossip
Words from a chick

No beyond the beats
To lyrics you are listenin'
Everything I am is probably everything they not so

You can call me Moon Man

I just landed here to approach those lames
With the weakest of ears
Stop livin' in fear
Even though shits eerie
No matter the cost
Motha fuckas will hear me
And I will out shine and out rhyme Those lames you don't cut it
Midwest cleveland niggas
Please M-Dub it?

It's okay I'm a dog who still muzzle
But once I'm unleashed like Jet Li
I'm kickin' it

You can call me Moon Man

Like a tribe of questin
Supplyin like a radio hot line request on the radio
Somewhat mentally challenged like Radio
Can't fade me
Like a bad barber

Yeah, Ho!
It's Drake, uh, uh, Ho!
Do that dance, do that dance

[Chorus]
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

[Verse 1]
Look I ought to be thankful with women I have plenty of luck
And when it comes to relationships, many is stuck
Look at fifty you make love, thirty you have sex
Somewhere around the tender age of twenty you fuck
Or maybe before, I'm here waiting to score
It's long gone like brother's having a tape in their car
Instead these girls taking it raw
Now they tell you to do whatever you want because it's safe to explore
Forget, wait till it's right, now it's wait till it's more
Wait till he get gets a deal girl, wait till the tour
So they dance to attract me, advance and attack me
To the point that Drake compare me to Anthony Mackie
But once they have my pants and my khakis
I tell them I'm not one for commitment and romancing exactly
Because, I hate waking up undressed with a dame
And guessing her name, I hope this shit is destined to change
[Chorus]
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

[Verse 2]
I don't get it, it's like my fairy was sick
It's like I meet the perfect girl, and she put me through some various shit
It's something that I can rarely predict
All I know is that I can never find the love that Tyler Perry depict
I'm guessing maybe Shemar Moore isn't really all pure
Maybe I lie to myself and it's like a small cure
I tell it all to her
I gotta feeling this feeling inside is something it's like and can't be all sure
Because really, What is a window without a car door?
Why I can't settle for one instead of all four?
Mu mind is clouded, this shit complex here
Jason tell me I'mma have a baby by next year
Psychic told me I'mma have three kids
I don't want my daughter making a song like Teairra Mari did
So, I'mma change, yeah this Summer is grown
I'm running along, before I raise one of my own
[Chorus]
You special girl, don't leave me baby (Yeah)
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at (Oh)
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at (Oh)
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back (Uh)

HO! Southern Smoke!!!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Very few give you that truth, it's either they can't do it with lyrics
Or can't do it in spirit, they cancel what they doin'
The samples that they usin', can't get through the clearin'
I'll handle it since they just can't get you to hear it
My father's early careerin' forced my parents to split up
My mother was a teacher, my father was kind of fed up
With just being a florist, so the choir sang his chorus
And he got back into doin' what he was doing before us
Because money is an issue, your son, he gon' miss you
And plus you got a wife at home cause mommy still exist too
Now you lookin' for exes, you ain't never expect this
You end up doing time, and me, I end up with a step-sis
Nobody passing judgment, they question where the drugs went
You know I hold you down because without you, I'd be a wasn't
And mommy I'mma support her, I keep it all in order
See her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border
But
[Hook: Nickelus F]
I got stress on my shoulders
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is makin' it colder
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
IT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!
I'm just tryna live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!
I'm just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!

[Verse 2: Drake]
This is my life, and so the rest has kinda been cool
Question what I been through
I write a verse addressin' it
And yes I might offend you
Picture when I was in school
Me being the closest thing to black
And guess what rap music what I was into
Rest of the kids were sheltered
I never liked to fight
But when someone called me a ""nigga""
I'd punch em I couldn't help it
Now I'm grown I can say what it is
It's parents that got these Black and Filipino nannies raisin' they kids
And your daddy want it very right
I make you happy, plus I'm Jewish, he don't approve
I think he want you to marry white
He want Sinatra at the wedding, not Barry White
Cause black is black honey, even if he's very light
And so I never been for dinner at they places
Always brutally honest, and so I pin it to they faces
I live it so the case is, whether Drake is
Way ahead of his time, or inquisitive and racist
[Hook: Nickelus F]

[Verse 3: Drake]
Am I hot as the rest? should I strive for my spot as the best?
Like girls with Double D's, I got a lot on my chest
There's questions that need to be answered that's not on the test
Instead of starin' at quizzes now it's models with breasts
And yes, when I'm dismissed after a tedious listen
I sit at home and say I should of been a pediatrician
Homie, I probably could've been on TV consistent
An artist like Pablo, maybe Petey's assistant
And my mindset is come and get me
I'm all alone at home with my mom and grandma and ain't nobody runnin' with me
So, if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady
Daughter, and her grandson, nigga get the handgun
If not, you gon make me call the burbs out in Richmond
That have you niggas laying out on the curb, they some hitmen
Last couple of months I done probably been around the world and back
And I don't wanna question half the places Nick been

Snatch you fast, wrap that ass
In the rug of your choice while it muffles your voice
Now when I'm swimmin' through the joint
I put the funk on hold
'Cause if you don't, you'll see the bubbles come up
We run up a tab
And gladly add a little extra for miss
Flashy faces with bigger lips for that ass to kiss
Most crews are post-current while we're forever
Direct beats that's contagious, loved by all ages
Graduated from the you-and-I-versity
Of hard-hitters, for real

I had plans to buy more land, plant corn
Bust kernels on heat, work hard like wetbacks
Set backs is gonna get my ass P.E. hostile

Big money's make the big decisions, keep hip-hop
Alive, it's just an intermission
Back to the second half of the feature flick
Dick stacks and fuck rap
I had a name for makin' paper since papier-mâché (C'mon)
Now my dollar coins join pounds of yen for play
While you broke niggas reach drunk much quicker
You don't make enough bread to soak up all your liquor
Went from God to God damn, damn God, you're killin' it
Should incorporate it, invest half a mil' in it
Rap cats talk with no will in it
Soundin' like they virtual, this joint'll hurt you, yo
Twas the night before Christmas and my crib got robbed
They did a job, took all the goodies
Out from under the tree (Word up?), except the CDs
Of shiny-suit rappers and flossin' emcees

Jay-Z and Kanye West, maybe they're just tryna distract it
From the fact that I'm comin' back
Or maybe it's 'cause I ain't black, maybe it's because of that
Maybe it's because I'm the highest sellin' artist in rap
While I'm sittin' back in my office jackin' off to my plaques
I'm still sick, how can I be sick this long?
And I'm still alive, Magic Johnson of rhymes
I thrive on makin' my opponents think that I've died
That's when I just pop up outta nowhere, oh yeah, there we go there
Damn, I forgot how much money he got
On the beach of St. Tropez, but your man don't lay
In the sun 'cause I don't tan, I burn, blood clot
When you gonna learn how much money we've earned?
How does it feel to know I came in this game at twenty-five
And could'a retired at twenty-nine in my twenties still?
And Fif' hit a lick on that Coca-Cola shit
He ain't even gotta look at coke to even hold a brick
No more, oh boy, goddamn did he score!
To go from sellin' bags to bottles right out the store
And Shady hit the box office, man, he knocked the socks off us
My ex-wife is set for life, you profitless cocksuckers
So stay the fuck off us, we make pay
I'm just a super easy modest MC, okay?
'Til I hear the word ""has-been"", that's when I start spazzin'
Smart asses, kiss a smarter ass then
I'm the best thing that ever happened to rap, bastards
I'm a blonde Dre, now gimme Kanye's glasses!

Yeah, I talk the talk, and I walk the walk

In the hood if ya ask about me
They'll tell ya I'm about my bread
Round the world if ya ask about me

We're just having fun
We don't care who sees (Shit)

That's how it's supposed to be ('Cause you know I'm high as fuck and I forgot one)
Living young and wild and free (Keep that in there)

So what I keep ‘em rolled up?
Saggin' my pants, not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for these hoes
It look clean, don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers
And smoke them hoes down 'til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I'm with your bitch smokin' grade A

You know what?
It's like I'm 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin', on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh my god, I'm on the chase, Chevy
It's gettin' kinda heavy, relevant, sellin' it
Dippin' away, time keeps slippin' away

Uhh, and I don't even care
'Cause if me and my team in there
There's gon' be some weed in the air
Tell 'em, Mac
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang
Uhh, now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, high as me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll
And live off life

I Dont Like To,Shad,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Yo, I don't really like to, but, um
Yo, I don't really like to, but, um
I put the smack down like it's rehab
Make sure that there's no relapse with these cats
Y'all cowards couldn't rap this dope with a Zig Zag
I let my lips drag, spitting with that big swag
It's sad all these wannabes
Wanted to be Jay then K. West, wanna be
Star of the Roc, kid, you're not Sean Connery
But like The Rock I'm surrounded by watery flows
Still it really don't bother me
Fake ballers, weak game, less polished than Ben Wallace's while I breed
Quality music getting quality spins
Y'all stay second rate Chingys at the Quality Inn
Now that's a joke to a real rapper
I could decrease the skill factor and I'd still make you feel whacker
Ah gee, now you got me cocky
Cats say, ""You the illest,"" I'm like, ""Nah b, nah b, nah b""
Well OK, probably, but that's just only cause I rap like it's my hobby
Not a jobby-job all sloppy, getting off-key
Y'all Mad as March trying to knock off the top seed
I'm in the mix like Roxy
So hot he even get props from neo-Nazis
Now I don't really like to
Yo, I don't really like to
I don't really like to
[Verse 2]
I don't like to start verses with I, y'know, but, um
ITunes, eye-patch, I'm in the same boat where the pirates be
Tell 'em I'm down with that pirate steed
They don't buy it, I say don't buy it, pirate me
If it's ill, it'll spread virally from my received
Folders to appearing in the love that the crowds show
If it sound dope, keep it on the download
Keep it real, player, with the volume cranked
And I'll be balling like Tim Duncan, calling bank
Cash banked it, but the bank said
That my check's been bouncing like the bankhead
So I'm bad like credit while they bear styles
More plain than the air miles
Borrowed metaphors from mega-stores to get rewards
We get 'em open automatic like the exit doors
And take a step higher, y'all just gotta press the floor
And step out, in faith, it's OK to confess doubt
Knowing how it feels to be stressed out
Tribe called Mapquest-style poems I sketch out
To find the best route home, don't
Live in your dome for too long
You end up like that Tiffany song, thinking we're alone
We all get older, we don't all get grown
Cause some of y'all don't really like to
Y'all don't really like to
Y'all don't really like to
Y'all don't really like to"

Machine-gun rap for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, linebacker nigga flash stacks
See through yellow lines, rock a fly jersey in the summertime, God
Magic marker rap, bleed Benetton
Relaxed, wrote this, comin' at you crab-ass culprits
Snatch your ice off, chillin' in the back, throw the lights off
Waves, water blend, rhyme flow in slow motion
Thick snare, I'm feelin' like a snail in the ocean
What's your wish? Wanna Kringle like Kris?
Melodic single, darts snap a nigga just like fish
You fucked up, some rich niggas you done test, yo
Select the wrong apartment and niggas pulled up your 'dress

Super freak physique like Raphael Saadiq
Baby love the ganja leaf every day of the week
Super friends wake up, deluxe gourmet beats
The night is right, I might find me a suite
It's a quarter full moon, I arrive, women swoon
Well groomed, dance hall packed, full room
Lady move, peep my glide, peep my zoom
Keep in stride, smoke the la, smoke the boom
Feel the fumes, consume toxic tunes
Hellbound, species forty ounce typhoon
The ultraviolet scream machine move your body touch
The totem pole wobble, Ark builders, God's thrust
Beams of light, stop your breathin', it's huntin' season
Honey eye-ballin' down for no reason
Grab her close, play post, wind and wax floors
Never mind the laws 'cause tonight, it's yours

Yo, stop the fader of the RAM, blast more watts through my pre-amp
Them camps better revamp their shit or get blamped
At full throttle, hot lead propels throughout my nozzle
Crack your skull like bottles, leave you stiff as models
You fag, you couldn't pull one drag off my blunt
You couldn't punch your way out of a wet paper bag
With scissors in your hands, bitch, the RZA
I stand close to walls like Number 4 The Lizard
And channel through solar panels, blast off like roman candles
Rap vandals, stomp your ass like Wahoo McDaniel
You cocker spaniel dogs can't fuck with our catalog
Put your lights out and leave your brain inside a fog
[Verse 4: Inspectah Deck]
It's only natural, actual facts are thrown at you
The impact'll blow trees back and crack statues
Million dollar rap crews fold, check the sick shit, explicit
I crystallize the rhyme so you can sniff it
We live this, fitted hats low conceal the crooked eye
No surprise, verbal stick up, put 'em high
Rebel I outlaw, split second on the draw
Blow the door off the shit like bricks of C-4

Check out my beaver, baby blue Glock in the safe
Seen Dorothy in the Garden gettin' skied, row eight
We hold a belt, son, that's my word
Spot a rapper, run him down, throw him out in the third
Yo, check it, I think like the man behind a register
Evergreen smokin' estates, Divine and Power made me treasurer
With third down, six to go, flash his strobe lights
I'm open, RZA hit me off lovely and I love him
With root beer thoughts, here's a tennis court for your birthday
The babyface of rap politic with Sade
Avengin' eagle crooks, rock the W and Spiegel books
Anheuser-Busch kings came through and stopped your whole juks
Spitfire Kangols, watch Tony train a gang of hoes
Painful like hearin' the news like when your man go
Ends blow, windy at times, watch the room
Sexy girl love the shit out the song, now watch her water break

Thought it was confining

You're outside of the world, with your fake smile
And I just don't know what to do with your take outs
Hand me downs and leftover pain now
And I'm so confused
Dunno what to do
You left me alone, battered and bruised
But I couldn't blame you
No, I couldn't choose
You as the fault
Man you have no clue
What you did
Why'd you go and do this
I said I didn't care then but you know what the truth is
Yeah, you know what the truth is
You always knew what the truth was
I don't know who you were trying to fool
But nobody got it, no one but your tool
That twisted L
He's one to kiss and tell
I don't know what you wished, but I wished you well
Yeah, well look how far wishing got me
Blank with no paternal property
And I wish you could hear these words right now
With hopes they'd set that black pipe down
And bring you back out of the ground
Make it so you were back around
Make it so she wasn't an alcoholic
And wasn't always bringing herself down
You were the key
The answer
The secret
To bringing life back to what we would see fit
Instead you lost you and lost all the pieces
And now we're left just trying to keep this
Life moving forward but I'm taking steps back
I'm tryna stay balanced, but I'm falling off track
I'm slippin' and tumbling, not staying intact
I know you wanted a lot but you wouldn't want that
No, you wouldn't want that
I know you wouldn't want that
You had such big dreams -- ambitions
I remember when you thought that I wasn't listening
You sit there and you'd list em
I just hate to see that you missed em
As I sit here and shed a tear
Thinkin about our time, year after year
How you taught me lessons, more depressing
While I'm watching my mom's stressing
Knowing that when you were here, it wasn't like this
Now I gotta grab a bullet and bite it
Grit my teeth through every action that I see her make
Wishin you were here to fix everything that you let break
But when you dipped, you left more behind than you know
You weren't meant to be all on your own
You should've forgotten that life -- left it alone
Instead you let sleep's cousin give you the bone
And I know you're in your own zone now
Got a new place to call home now
But I just wish one more thing before I go out
Please dad, guide me as I grow now"

Now it's a long road ahead of me
Eyes wide open, trying to rock my flow steadily
Trying to stay focus so these broads dont get to me
But dog it gets hard cause they seem so heavenly
Humming Stay With Me trying to make my day as sweet
As aunt Tiombe on a Sunday with a cup of Angel's tea
I'm trying to find the happiness that couples claim to be
But it's hard to balance loving when you busting over beats
Sounds strange but it's hard to explain it over beats
In the lab daily rocking two or three shows a week
Going mad crazy stressing over press and your release
Trying to please labels while you keep your rep up in the streets
At the same time trying to breath
And on my down time, trying to find a fine breeze
But see im underground so now I gotta find cheese
Just to take her out to dinner
Just to eat and get a kiss up on the cheek
But for me it's even harder
Cause I ain't got a car to pick them up in
So chicks already think they put enough in
Plus im kind of cute so its hard for them to trust him
Asking what im doing every night like I be screwing every night what
Truth is, im bruising every mic that I come across
And every now and then, drop a hundred off
Just so you can fucking floss, but that's not enough for you
So I take another loss, wondering why I fucked with you
Knowing I got stuff to do

[Verse 2]
They say misery loves company, word
But I dont need shit, so dont come to me
And I dont eat dick, so dont cum to me
When you see me in a fucking Beamer
Leaning tough as fiends with winter fever
Your nose itching, hoes wishing he was a keeper
Fucked up girl, he was a keeper
Fuck the papers, shit he was the reefer
Now he's meaner than meaner
Was sweet now he keeps his heart next to his nina
And you used to see him, saving up his money from shows
To get her a rose, turning down ridiculous hoes
All he wanted was a chick with his back, but his chippers was whack
Now he adding on the Royce when he rolls
Sounds smoother with his voice when he flows, missed out
Keep woofing all you want girl
I'm in a brick house
With a thick spouse, pimped out, blue diamond dripped out
In my helicopter love, fuck your little Benz bounce
Fuck you think I work for huh

Smash Into You,Beyonc,['pop'],"[Produced by The-Dream and Tricky Stewart]

[Verse 1]
Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut
I find myself in love racing the Earth
And I'm soaked in your love
And love was right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong

[Chorus]
I wanna run (Run)
Smash into you
I wanna run (Run)
And smash into you

[Verse 2]
Ears closed
What I hear, no one else has to know
'Cause I know
That what we have is worth first place in gold
And I'm soaked in your love
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong, oh
[Chorus]
I wanna run (run)
Smash into you
I wanna run (run)
Smash into you
Smash into you
Oh...

[Bridge]
Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut
I'm in love and I'm racing the Earth
And I'm soaked in your love (Your love)
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong

[Chorus]
Ohh, I wanna run
Smash into you
I'm willing to run (Run)
Smash into you
I'm willing to run, run, run, run, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm willing to run, run, run, run, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I wanna run (Run)
Smash into you
I'm willing to run (Run)
Smash into you"

Your so extraordinary
Something’s got a hold on me
Your so extraordinary
Somethings who’s got a hold on me
If this feeling has emotion..
Someone who’s got a hold on me

[Gudda Gudda - Verse 1]
Rumble anyday nigga pick a date
I’m feeling great, I don’t walk I just levitate
I come from the bottom of the slum village
Where niggas make a name for being young killers
I hate the game and all the bullshit that come with it
Sometimes I wanna get the money and be done with it
But right now I’m feeling better than the usual
Flow so ugly make my bank account beautiful
They call me Gudda nigga who is you
Bedrocking every girl was a 2 for 2
That’s right nigga the more the merrier
Extraordinaire. Extraordinary, nigga
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
We took the game to another level
Killing all these rap niggas time to get the shovel
I don’t want this shit I want this shit forever
Until the game crown me king like Ms Corretta
Yeah. Chase the money with my eyes open
Cause I’ma die trying and never die hoping
Shit about to get critical
It's Guddaville 2, and the first one was biblical
Fuck the bullshit I’ma leave these niggas miserable
Spit the hardest shit till I start to see residuals
That’s right nigga the more the merrier
Extraordinaire. Extra-ordinary, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Propane thoughts; I spit gasoline
I be the first to come and the last to leave
Some of the realest shit I ever spoke
I hope your hearing everyline and catching every quote
Flow sick there’s no antidote
Lock me in the zoo. They can’t tame me: I’m an animal
There’s no stopping me. there’s no holding me
There’s no games nigga. there’s no controlling me
I know the Lord watching over me
Had to get the snakes from around me so it’s more for me
That’s right nigga the more the merrier
Extraordinaire. Extra-ordinary, nigga"

I don't even know what you did, you did you did, but I love it

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh uh, everythin' hooks
Everythin' works, you're a real good chorus
I'm a real good verse, freestyle unrehearsed
So clean, no curse
And when the song's gone, man everythin' hurts
So I put it in reverse, go back to the scene where I seen you first
Yeah, I need you to sing that single again
Play that video I seen you up in
A hundred million spins in my mind all day
Callin' requests on the line always
Yeah, the president of your fan club
Leave them players all behind like a band love

Playa need a minute
Like a time out in tennis 'fore I finish
How'd I get in this, maybe 'was your hair, maybe 'was your flair
Maybe it's the heels and the way you wear
Maybe it's you're real and the way you care
You don't care if I'm ill or a millionaire
The only thing that matters that the feeling's there
Your smile's so bright it's like a grill's in there
High off life, don't need a pill in there, nah
You're killin' me, I think I need a will in here
Got me feelin' real skills impaired
Hard to describe why you're still in here

I can't get you out of my head, my head, my head

Don't care what nobody say 'cause I like it girl
Might go crazy tryna figure this out, love

Caught up in something that I can't get out of
But we like it girl
C'mon

Pat your back, ho, why the fuck they coughin'?
Oh, I got 'em sick, better get that coffin
I say coffin, you can say casket
They're so trash, but where's the waste basket?
Where's my hat and where's my straitjacket?
Yup, they jackin', back to Maybachin'
Everything I do, bitches wanna do it too
I guess-guess you just skip to my lou
I just came through, I flew to St. Lou
Back to kill you, they blew like HQ
Why is it that they make Nicki a target?

Why did you envy? Why you go against me?
When I got trendy, why you ain't commend me?
Why, when I needed it, why you couldn't lend me?
Why you was secretive, frontin' like you friendly?
Why did you fear that? Held my career back
Kick it like Air Max, I don't wanna hear that
'Cause now I see-see-see-see, all your run-down
Niggas better have my money by sundown
'Cause now when I come through, I'm stylin' on 'em
It's like I got hotter than islands on 'em
They say she got colder than igloos, did she?
I'm in a GT, she in a Mitsubishi
Just left Mr. Miyagi
Tell that bitch jump, if that bitch feel froggy
'Cause I got one leg up, in the middle of the ring
And that bitch better duck when that bell go ""Ding!""

King,Big K.R.I.T.,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Ayy...Ayy what up folk, I'm focused man...I been doing this for a lil' while now
I had some mixtapes out, did my thang...I ain't really had the opportunity I think
To speak from my heart, man like really just express myself, so I'mma give it to em as long as I can
I ain't counting bars, so don't expect no hook...

[Verse: Big K.R.I.T.]
Lord I been trying all these years, and I ain't never had a thing to say
Did it by myself not a soul here to motivate me, my family was cool
But when times got hard they was like fuck this rap shit
Go get yourself a job, I thank god there were no run ins with the law
While I was riding with my folk and there was dope in the car
Momma forgive me I was in it for a minute, I was tired of 'em talking bout
My shoes and my fitted, ""G-Rod"" got killed and I shed a couple tears
Trying to forget that he's gone, Just remember that in here, remember that it clear
And where he at it's good, yea my nigga dead, but at least he out the hood
I'd leave if I could, that's what I plan to do, these niggas talk alot
Remind me of high school, but I thank you for your hating, appreciate the rumors
If you think that you're a winner than I'm glad to be a loser lord
No money, More problems that's just how it is, I lost another homeboy
That's just how it is, He told me Little cuz don't trip on these niggas"",I said
""Fuck that, I' gonna get paper and shit on these niggas, Rip on these niggas
Don't speak when I pass you, they sold 'cuz they wanted to, we sold 'cuz we had to
Bills don't pay themselves my nigga Hell Naw!! I'm about money that's what I'm
Trying to tell ya, moms and pops I promise that I won't fail y'all, my shit jam
It's only right that I outsell y'all, I dedicate my life to this music, I dropped
Out of college 'cuz my life is this music, Next nigga out the 'Sip, really can't
Tell me shit, the beats spoke to me when the books couldn't tell me shit
I wake up like another day another headache, my purpose get's no clearer
As I'm staring in this mirror,wash my face and my ass and hit the slab hard
If I don't say shit all day, nigga I thank god, for another breath, yes for
Another step, in the right or wrong direction still it's for a progress
Moving at pace that can't be seen, scraping everything, yea my pockets is
Fat because my stature lean, I got a mean team and they will see you dearly
The only way they show respect if I make 'em feel me, I mean that sincerely
I keep more beef than chili for anxious haters waiting, plotting, prayng
Out to kill me, Why the fuck I gotta live like this momma? All the set backs
Make me feel like this momma, another southern rapper yea I bet it label
Two of my best friends Patron and Cuervo at my table we sit and talk
Millions with some hope that we can speak it to existence hah
It's certain universal laws we abide by, the dealer lives on but a child
Dies in the drive by, titans collide and blocks go to war with no earthly idea
What the fuck we fighting for, I paint pictures of this concrete jungle
Where the lions make deals with the hunters, snitch niggas kool aid heart
Pump bitch niggas, under pressure write a whole fuckin' list nigga please
I'm fighting demons like constantine, constantly trying to take what belongs
To me but I review you niggas, follow 'suit nigga, if the convo ain't
About money then I mute niggas shit, I'm focused folk, you can quote this folk
I'm about to swarm the game like locust folk, they choking folk, guess
It's hard to swallow, If I leave the 'Sip then hell yea they'll follow
I talked to the father, he tells me ""Be real, nevermind what they want son
Just say what you feel"", I'm knowing that the deals nowadays are some bullshit
Anything less than a mil' is some bullshit, because I know what I'm worth
Don't need a nigga to tell me..Shit! Music alone no gimmick, need a nigga to sell me
I'm here!! K.R.I.T"

The Ultimatum, let's abbreviate em
A.O.T.P
The Ultimatum, let's abbreviate em
You can't fuck with the army

[King Magnetic]
The ultimatum ain't debated, ain't the same as when you waitin'
For someone to keep their word or the paper from a payment
Ain't negating nothin'
I can break their front and take it from them
Wait a month and take a pump and make 'em want to make up somethin'
Take an up-and-coming artist
Or classic figure
If you see me reaching out, it's to smack a nigga
Melanin scheme is telling 'em squeeze, shell an MC to breeze
Ease G', tell like Aviv
Felony three on melody schemes
They selling them dreams
DMX is Nelly to me
Tellin' 'em please, just leave
Before I have to swell a person
It's no question like playing the a capella version
[Des Devious]
Look I said it before, shouldn't say it again
But in case you hard of hearing look you and your mans
Can get it in the worst way, run when killers thirsty
For a lame and his blood
Sweep it under the rug
Just like it never happened, we professional fighters
And I ain't talking about scrapping
I'm talking pistol gripping
You know the rest, no need to, stress how my niggas live it
Just know we go so hard, for dough and lavish living
And since I had my taste can't find nothing that's better
Ridin' high gripping wood, ass on the softest leather
Oh, y'all some scary dudes? Man I ain't afraid of you
Murder you, crack a brew and watch it on the news

[Reef The Lost Cauze]
Get stabbed by the cuts on the Kwest beat, respect beef
Marty McFly shit, get knocked into next week
What does the future hold? Bullets going through your clothes
My niggas is all large like a Jewish nose
Hold more arms than a hookah bowl
Y'all motherfuckers ain't been nice since the Eagles won the Superbowl
Check your stat books, get your rat hooks
Out my rap books, biting-ass niggas get your snacks took
You in the scrapbook scrap shook
Y'all niggas think beef is what these dudes type on they Macbooks
I'll smash your Hewlett-Packard
You fucking doofus rapper
A.O.T.P. fuckers, it's the newest chapter
[King Syze]
Catch me in the street dressed pretty as hell
But when it comes to these raps I get gritty for real
Knock 'em out the box Syze
I spin your motherfucking head counterclockwise
Y'all niggas is not Syze
You full of shit like a pot pie
Labels better cross them T's, dot them I's or them shots fly
Pass the Master, have to blast you
Chokin' the track like please excuse the asthma
Please excuse my French, fuck the Spanish
Talking ghetto language the hood can understand it
A wrath of God, Satan; fuck the apostles
Army of the Pharaohs back ready to rock you

[Vinnie Paz]
Vinnie fucking smash your jaw
It ain't nobody rapping half as raw
I was writing rhymes over loops by Stacy Lattimore
Guess you wondering what Vinnie need all the assassins for
Guess you wondering if I'm a communist or fascist bol
Shoot three at you and push the rock like this was basketball
Chop your body up in little pieces with my plastic saw
Y'all need to overstand the jux is real
I run with ghetto boys and I ain't talking Bushwick Bill
If looks could kill then y'all would be kaputs for real
We drink your blood and hang your body up on hooks of steel
I push the pills, call me Vinnie the psychiatrist
And y'all are gonna have to see defeat like a podiatrist
[Celph Titled]
In the dice game you say I won't place those bets
That's like saying you know the Wu, but call that dude Ghostface Deck
I leave your whole face wet like you got hit with a water balloon
The size of a propane jet
Altercations I took place and no police was involved
If I'm beefin' we ain't greetin', I'm deleting you, pal
I keep my weed in a jar
And roll it in a Philly wrapper
I'm A.O.T.P. so I roll with Philly rappers
And will kill a rapper
Don't believe us? Try us
We the illest out believe it I'm not biased
At best you're a rookie
Your show's like a Catwoman audition
'Cause we'll see who plays the best pussy

[Planetary]
It's the ultra (ultra)
Magnetic like I'm seven foot
Outsmart your art of rhyme though I've never read a book
Off with your head, you shook in the corner shiverin'
Delivering a dosage of the most potent Ritalin
You must be kiddin' nigga, this ain't no Kid 'n Play
More like N.W.A
Fuck you kids gonna say?
Hola Hola aye
Oh God hold my trey pound
You rap clowns sit around in broad day
Broad Street Bully rap
Yo Kwest you took me back
To the scuffed trees and the Champion hoodies in black
I blacked out
Snap in a packed house
The gallon of Jack's out
That stout got my passed out

[Apathy]
You can't take the word on the street from a bird on the wire
And you'll never hear the truth in the church of a liar
Real men converse, you prefer to conspire
Give it a year you'll be the first to retire
We don't roll with snakes, we curse a pariah
You're mad at your people over earthly desires
You don't believe it? Just peep the verses
Presidential, we roll deep as secret service

[Crypt The Warchild]
Too many niggas claim they O.G
But most of them won't approach me
Catch me everywhere, my niggas like to play low key
I'm mostly surrounded by apes, gorillas
Out of a broken home so they label us hateful niggas
Never take a nation of mills, it takes a killer
On medication chasin' their pills with haze and liquor
Bad lieutenant in a black whip, black shottie
Dragging a safety net only 'cause we catch bodies
We act snotty and rap godly and clap loudly
They don't want hardcore 'cause they fags probably
I don't make shit to make you want to paint a canvas
I spit fatal language only to cause pain and anguish

[Journalist]
Don't bring drama to the old-timers
When it calls for a time you catch Alzheimer's
And turn into Carl Thomas
I'll pack a Llama
Separate the lions from llamas and alpacas if I pow pow at ya
Ali bumaye
Zoom by clappin' ya
Wound guys, the room guys, Mumbai massacre
Verse so raw I'm trying to tell ya
I'll salmonella poison any these boys in the path of the craft
Lean on the Craftmatic
Paralyzed from ass to your calf
Half radish for half of the cabbage
Five and a half hours, dime bags is sour
Get twisted, niggas get high as the Comcast tower
Lifted
Like a dumbbell, inhale; your lungs swell
Whiff of the piff bury the gun smell
Either you run well, the shells stick in you like a thumbtack
Pistol clip you like a thumbnail
Won't get caught for a thumbprint
The lawyer eat the case like roast
Deploy you and your boy, ain't payin' one cent
Hide your charms
Firearms, will rip through the bone and the marrow
It's the Army of the Pharaohs

Blue Note NYC Freestyle,Kanye West,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Kanye West]
It’s like I wanna spit something written
But keep forgetting
So I guess it’s from the heart from the start
Played my part
Seemed like I just wasn’t reaching the charts
5000 hours, rewritting Power
Over and over
Some nights sober, some nights gone off the Henny as usual
So unusual to be in this position
Everything I say everybody tryna diss ‘em
Everybody playin him, truth be told
The last nigga ever let the truth be told
And oh Mos Def ran to my home
And said they gon have yo ass gone
Light jokes, you keep playin with them white folks
Can't even take the piss
They gon’ test your urine
Cut all the sponsorship for the touring!
“Where the Dark Fantasy tour at Ye?”
I dont know, ask, ask Hennesy (thats Coca-Cola)
Say ‘he ain't clean enough’
But rappers ain't mean enough?
Enough lashes like I ain't seen enough
On the real, this is like the neo-Emmitt Till
Whistling, get yo fuckin' ass killed
Lets keep this shit real!
Now who the realest
Everybody feel this
And everyday of my life, people try to tell me that I hate the whites
Cause I said what's right
I go to sleep and deal wit it every night
And wake up every morning
And walk to the liquor store or coffee store shop on the Mersa whats worser?
Its no verse that would reverse the-
In print or in cursive
They curse the name, or maybe call me Kane
Let's have a ‘toast for the douche bags’
Black people wanna talk about me on blogs
Cause I like clothes like, 'look at this fag'
Thats what I have to deal wit real shit
Yall dont even understand, what it take to be a real man
A black man interested in art, speaking from the heart and playin’ my part
And all this illuminati talk, like my first hit single wasn't ‘Jesus Walks’
For many years, these ain't rhymes these is muthaf-cking tears
They playin’ wit niggas careers
Felt like I’m the only real nigga here
From my last breath
They kicked me out the awards and my nigga Diddy left
Then they even sent Beyoncé up to give the award back
Didn’t even know I afford that
And she rode the wave as I rode the slave
As I felt like a slave as they try to put my shit up in the grave
Nigga behave, nigga behave
Be the first one
I bet ya no one else would ever say nuttin’ and stay frontin’
And get up and just perform, shit is enormous
Shout out to Steve Stout, you know what this shit ’bout
My whole family, now I’m scared of Grammy’s
Cause everybody know that Dark Fantasy was the highest rated album in history
So I just avoided it, not to be exploited, not to be recorded
'Cause I cannot afford it, I cannot afford more shit to be impor-ted
Uh, it’s too real for these niggas, you feel for these niggas
How I feel to be a black man, you say something wrong, nobody understand
Money, power, black, opinion, pick two, they would kill ya
[Mos Def]
No matter what goes on
They may not agree, they may not understand
But God got a plan, to put the mic in my hand
And his hand and that hand
And ideas, and all of theres
And the end, everybody up in here, in this atmosphere
So make it clear, live long and prosper
Much success, even if you wish me the opposite
To quote Nas, I stay on my job
Try to pray to keep my heart from going harm
And I ain't perfect, you know that from old me
My life is real even when I’m in the movies
I’m on the ave, I’m in the cave
I buried my Grandmother on Thursday, two weeks ago
My life is real, as it ever been
To all my friends and even foes
Each and every one of those, let em know
I shine a globe, even in the dark, stay smart
Stay sharp, as a harp played by a musician in this position
Feel blessed to make the whole World listen
And just glisten without even trying
Even when I die, I won't stay dead
And its straight off the head, and its straight out the lungs
Looking fly, fresh, old man, so young
And I’m straight from the slums
And never been above so the ba-bum-ba-bum-bum-pum-pum…
This thing ups, let us all give some
Number one yo, I’m number none, no comparision
And make the whole world aware of it
Brooklyn in the building we take care of it
Peace out to all the Sagittarius
And happy birthday Pisces and Aries too
And this go out to all area crew
And if you come from the seven-eighteen then you just like me
From the present, and the past and the future and beyond
Me and Lupe and Kanye we play the song and get it on"

Oh I, oh I, oh I
I wanna give you some good, good lovin'
Pre - Hook : Lauryn Hill
Loving you is a like a song I replay
Every three minutes and thirty seconds of every day
And every chorus was written for us to recite
Every beautiful melody of devotion every night
This potion might, this ocean might carry me
In a wave of emotion to ask you to marry me
And every word, every second, and every third
Expresses a happiness more clearly than ever heard
And when I play ‘em, every chord is a poem
Telling the Lord how grateful I am cause I know him
The harmonies possess, a sensation similar to your caress
If you asking then I'm telling you it's yes
Stand in love, take my hand and love Jah bless
Right, right

[Bob]
I want to give you some good, good loving
Turn your lights down low
And-a pull your window curtains

[Lauryn]
And let Jah love come tumbling in
Into our lives again

[Bob]
Sayin’, it’s been a long, long time
[Lauryn]
I got this message for you, boy

[Bob]
But it seems I was never on time

[Lauryn]
Still I wanna get through to you, boy

[Bob and Lauryn]
On time
On time
I want to give you some love
I want to give you some good, good lovin'
Oh I, oh I, oh I
I wanna give you some good, good lovin’

[Lauryn]
Good, some good, good, good, good, good, good

[Bob]
I want to give you some good, good lovin'

[Lauryn]
Good, good
Oh I, oh I
I wanna give you some good, good lovin’
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Yeah
Please don’t forget passionate
Babies in the bassinet
You call, we be ready
Ha ha, Ma steady
Yeah, yes
Baby love"
10 Bricks,Rick Ross,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
Look at my wrist
Look at, look at
My wrist
Equivalent to 10 bricks
10 bricks to the fish

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Look at my wrist, it's 200 thou
That mean fuck that nigga, come and fuck me now
Suck me down, blow my socks
Push that coupe, Ima drop that top
And all them niggas that talk, them bitches never had money
Whip it with a fork and get that extra mall money
Get you first million and the come in with a test
Watch for the feds, jack boys, and IRS
4 Jesus pieces and a motherfucking tec
Clapping at all you niggas imitating Sammy Gravano
Got them argentines and kilos up in the condo
And my European bitch always screaming Armani
10 bricks on the wrist, I find it funny
I'm counting cash, you don't know me nigga
Its Rozay, the one and only nigga
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Birdman]
See I'm richer than the richest
Filthy by my riches
Dope boy fresh, made man getting tickets
Holiday sunshine how we get it
Flipping in the Bentley every time we come and spin it
So she love the way I shine homie
Put on her mind, do it big time homie
Priceless, you know the game with no line homie
Tote it all the time, see my son did time on it
So 100 mill what we eat
The feast of the streets, Cash money young beast
Full grind, Cash Money all the time
Fire flame spitter do this shit in day time
Flip a nigga another top
The watch on rocks, do this shit hard knocks
A all red new fleet, swagged out nigga, YMCMB

Burn Fetish,Eyedea & Abilities,"['hip hop', 'alternative', 'r&b', 'pop', 'rock']","[Verse 1: Eyedea]
Teeth marks on the skin
The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing me that I was him
We like to feel the blood and fat dripping off our gums
She likes to talk directly down the barrel of her gun
Learning to perfect the ancient art of quiet rape
You've always been so warm and calculated, I owe you a thanks
Eyes wide shut, I promise not to fall awake
Lick the guillotine and tell you how the gasoline tastes
The grass is always greener on the other pesticide
Solemn precious crept through the mess to shed it's infectious high
What's for me to know and you to find
Guilty, the almighty praised adrenaline
Such an underwhelming thrill
Where there's a will there's a wake
Burn me at the stake
Who the hell am I trying to fool?
I'm a fool, I feel so fake
One last goodbye before I take my .45
Shoot a hole in the sky, rip it open
And climb inside
[Hook: Eyedea]
Empathy is the poor man's cocaine
And love is just a chemical by any other name
I like the way your pheromones make me sleepy
This far away I still smell you inside me
Empathy is the poor man's cocaine
And love is just a chemical by any other name
I like the way your pheromones make me sleepy
This far away I still smell you inside me

[Bridge]
Tie me down till my sweet nothing's sour
I screwed up trying to squeeze 65 minutes from an hour
Outnumbered by such a large amount
No wonder why we lost the battle, the counter-culture can't count

[Verse 2: Eyedea]
Welcome to my private hell
There's no one to fight now, enjoy myself
I'd rather drown than ask for help
I wish I was someone else
Mr. Perfect, Misconstrued
Lead the way, follow through
You probably hate me, I do too
You're so much like me I feel sorry for you
But I think you're pretty, pretty sure
You will profit, you will get hurt
I eat my words they taste like dirt
I'm only ashamed because I know what it's worth
Find my comfort inside blame
Shove my pride back down my face
My worst habit's waking up at least once a day
Balance barefoot on a needle heaven's just a jump away
[Hook]
Empathy is the poor man's cocaine
And love is just a chemical by any other name
I like the way your pheromones make me sleepy
This far away I still smell you inside me
Empathy is the poor man's cocaine
And love is just a chemical by any other name
I like the way your pheromones make me sleepy
This far away I still smell you inside me"
Break the Chain,Lupe Fiasco,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: Eric Turner]
I waited all my life to play
I still can't find a way
But if I work it one more day
I might just break the chain
I might just break the chain
I might just break the chain

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Freedom, we can use some of that especially where we from
Where we grew up like a green thumb
It's like a criminal is the only thing you can become
Look at what I became
Something like a phenom, Nuthin' but a G Thang
Things I've seen when I'm looking out of these frames
Pictures I painted on the walls where we hang
From the trees we hung
Strange fruit man look at how we swung
How the hell you gonna tell a son
Who ain't have a father
How to try to grow up and be one
See, um, feel it in my bones
That I'm sitting on a throne
Like a killer with a chrome
When I spit another poem
Shed a whole lot of light on a little bit of home, pow!

Super Swah, the cape remains, thought I was M.I.A no paper?
Planes, I'm fly plus I don't write no more, its all off of the top I shaved the braids
And stayed sharp mother knew how to raise-a-blade (Razor Blade)
I paid my dues now I wait for change and the flows so rude it goes without...
Ask Lupe I'm Sucre, I aid the break
Quick to cut off any baggage like some samurai, I like to travel light
I've gotta leave you at home Delilah
This is Samson-ite
No case for the police
Said I know Killah's, I never seen them
Ghostface, only time I'm watching is my Panerai
I've got an alibi
I was taking pics in Chicago, call me Camera Chi

Chain broke, nicorette for your chain smoke
No cigarrettes on my plane, yo
Snatching herringbones from the game throat
Put it on mine, take a long time
B.A. Baracus is how I'm looking online
In the webisode, necklace stole, let 'em know
That I put up the footage that I'm takin' your shine
Wanna see the real chains? Look in your mind
Your brain look like Keenan Wayans, brother
Overgold, overload, broken soul
Niggas playing games in the hood they got you stuck-up
Playa thinkin' that its cool to be a pimp still
We gon' set it free like a fish in a pimp heel
Take this home, rearrange it, change it

If you feeling good, give me a shoutout, alright?
Eh, What up? Alright
Poo Bear!
I'm really saying this to myself, alright (alright)
Claudio, alright
So how we gon do this one?
Uh

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
This one goes out to the baby girls
In a rush growing up in this crazy world
Yeah your brother on the road and he never home
I know you feeling kinda sad now that daddy gone
You can't let it get you down, gotta carry on
We only lose things because it make us strong
You always had my love, and now you got a song
From the biggest biggest fan that you've ever known
I know you won't be little girls, not for very long
And you ain't gotta have a man if you don't ever want
Cause I'm gonna make sure you got two of everything
That you ever want, every tone, like your very own
Not to make you hard to respect
Just really really really really hard to impress
It's a whole wide world for you to go and get your hands on
Until then, just come and get your dance on now
[Hook: Poo Bear]
I see you coming up
I'ma give you the low-down, down, down
You ain’t never gotta worry about nothing
Just as long as I'm around, round, round, round

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, this for everybody feeling good
You know who you are, or you misunderstood
Never had money, or you living good
If you from the burbs, if you in the hood
Recognize where we come from
In my day, mane, I did a little somethin' some
They like ""how come you don't rap that?""
Cause that's a back track and I ain't tryna back that
I'm only moving forward, homie, that's that
Direction, a lot of shawties lack that
I'm just tryna' give it to 'em like sat nav
Now I know I might not make out like a fat rat
That's cool as long as they don't trap crack
Graduate from school, and still let his pants sag
Never catch a case, know how to let his cash stack
Welcome to the map, go anywhere you tap at now, yeah

When the floor falls out
I'mma be there to carry you
And if you want that star
I'll go get it out the sky for you
If you cry, shed a tear
I'mma dry your eyes
Just to let you know it'll be alright

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, I know it's like a whole lot going on
Things going right, things going wrong
Maybe baby, on the way, and you feel so alone
Know that in this world you're never really on your own
God got a number get him on the phone
He'll never put you places where you don't belong
Put you through the pain, to put you on the throne
And I know that from the bottom of my corazon
And if they looking at you sideways
You just wave right back, tell 'em hi hater
Mad you ain't hanging with 'em in the driveway
Nah we gon' keep it moving to the highway
Strong is puttin' on, the weak is all over like Friday, chilling
Shout out to King David for bringing in Philly
And all my pretty independent women in the building, let's go!"
How Do I Feel Sex Room Remix,K'La,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
I trace his facial features with my fingers
And blessed the texture with kisses on the spots at wich they linger
As he puts pressure on my spine until it tingles
Conversations turn sexual every time our bodies mingle
I'm single, he single, together we get too buck
Practicing passion and then mistakeing it for true love
He took off his jacket, pants and shirt just to suit up
Forget fashion, we in this room like a nude club
The music, up, the lights is down
Sight is lost in darkness, but the senes of touch is found
He leads me with his voice, so I reach out and touch his mouth
And thank God I found it, cause now I don't hear any sounds
He turns me round, zips me down
Drops my dress, picks up my pounds
Sits ms on the table, lays me out
Puts his hands inside my thighs and prepares to drown

[Hook]
How do I feel?
(I wanna know, said I wanna know)
How do I feel?
(How do I feel babe, how do I feel babe)
I wanna know right now
How do I feel?
(Ohh, yeah I wanna know, I wanna know, say I wanna know)
How do I feel?
(How do I feel to you baby)
[Verse 2]
Ice chips drip slow, wet, don't slip
He kiss mine, lick mine and bit his own lip
If I'm a crime, then that makes him the culprit
Cause he just beat it in, like no one ever told him don't hit
But don't quit, don't stop
Wait, don't move, stay on top
You can speed it up, but don't pop
And please God tell the neighbors, please don't knock
No interruptions before I get my eruptions
Oh before I give you yours, that's the purpose of this function
I know you tipsy, cause you in me, like a puncture
So if you ain't wanna hear me whine, you never should of drunk it
But I want it and you like it
Rough, and so do I, so we make love as if we're fighting
Shit, you might lose, baby you might win
Just so you know you'll be KO'ed, before the night end

Leavin the cut in a rage
Loadin up my Mac, goin to my crib, to get my 12 gauge
One of my boys just got shot, huh
Fuckin around, in that million dollar spot
A educated brother
Didn't have no money for college he was taught the street knowledge
Part of the plan
To keep us fightin in the street instead of becomin a strong black man
Every two weeks I see Sam
Pitchin out my check with no respect but I still don't give a damn
Becaause I GOTTA make my dough
My kill, rocked down, til I started seein cash flow
Everything happens for a reason, choose the season
To commit the perfect treason
Who brought me -- to the land, of unfree man
To move about and catch trout, by the dozens
Even had my cousin locked down, at the feet shackled
A one-way seat, to Milledgeville
Nigga this real, how can you kill another
When it's your brother? Still Standing

I never thought about, talked about what I did
Just experimented life as a young Gump
Them days long gone, school bells done rung no mo'
Spendin hours at the house in my favorite chair
Slow mo', custom funk fingerprinted to carry a hucklebuck
Feelin stuck with the art that my skin carries, scary
If I ever had to plot again, needin my stick
?Gidgets to pidgits, moves to Philly and the crew?
Nothin else to prove, fold a plot like chrome
Salt lick teddy bears in the college student's room
Speed, Gipp got that too
Watch that dude, inspect that fool, Still Standing

Unscathed, cause this is pain
This for soldiers to feel
MC's, are running out of things to say
Radio stations are running out of songs to play

Radio stations are running out of songs to play

On the sick side, of South Central
33rd Avenue, block 600
Workers have wash and car details
The ese's got the fresh Chevrolet's for sale
Twenty G's or better, the whole neighborhood tanked up
What? On the fortress walls, there is no letters
Buddha say, the Bloods are strictly outnumbered
They beseiged, on the beats, Goodie Mo-B, run the creeps
Y'all can have the streets, asphault caught many suckers
Slippin on wet floors, we puttin out the signs
On krokers, C-I, T-Y, such a pity
Bein suckled dry, like a newborn
On his momma's titty before I retired I hit twenty
True to cellulite with big ?room pesquite? on the porch
Poundin, like cartoon Ennis, old school efforts
Through the Sunday down, Crenshaw sparkin
Zoned out, off the ink, for life
Goin through time and metal detectors, I can't take my weapon
And I can't be no dope dealer
Cause they be done put a hit out on a nigga, plus I can't keep up

Wakin up, somewhere else... Still Standing
[Verse 4: Cee-Lo]
Yeah..
Each and every element that exists in this
Universe is manifested from a thought first
Through the inner mind's eye of the unseen power in the sky
Gave birth to Mother Earth and all it's worth to you and I
This most loved invention, my conciousness is an extension
Of Him, yet I'm flesh and bone with a mind of my own
To dig deeper than the surface, whether I learn
From your upcomings or your downfalls we all have individual purpose
It's amazing, how the streets do the majority of raising
Of children who end up dead before hearing what you said
And it's sad, so all I can write about is what I had
Interpretations of life good and bad with a pen and pad
It seems like abortion, when I just write a small portion
It's either crumpled up or torn without lettin the thought be born
Young minded, and blinded in those days; I didn't want to
Have a thought that I couldn't raise, nurture, and care for
Be there for, help prepare for, the times ahead
When someone doesn't agree with what is said, huh
And if they did, don't get all arrogant cause that's my kid
Just be thankful that it's good and somebody overstood
Now, the listener in here want the same flow but I gotta let it grow
Clever enough to let it go, if I don't wanna rap no mo'
And I'll make sure that no one ever forgets
It's immortalized forever, on wax CD's and casettes
And when someone goes to the store and purchases it for ten
The life cycle starts all over again
And I was granted this music as my soulmate, to procreate
And give back what I was given, a life worth livin
And I, am Still Standing, unscathed
Pain is for suckers to feel
MC's are running out of things to say, and
Radio stations running out of songs to play, shit!
We Still Standing, unscathed
And pain is for suckers to feel, huh
And MC's running out of things to say..."

You either be in a coffin or you be the new guy
The one that's too fly to eat shoo pie
Never too busy when it comes down to you and I

Looked her up and down; said, ""Hmm, too much makeup""
Poor music taste, ten years from being grown up
Rappers don't blow up, heads do (Aww, shit)
My name is Dwight Spitz, I'm a Sonic addict
I use to think it was merely a nagging habit
Born under a bad sign, I'm serious about this curse of mine
I strive to flip it into fine wine
""Barely born a virgin"" is what the stars said
Black not white, red all over, though, like Elmo
Twenty-eight years have passed, I feel I'm peaking
I make music every weekend
It's a chore, a fact of life, a labor of love
I get mad love, but I detest the labor
And its wages—you know, death?
I'm servin' life from this gift of God
Don't forget your potholders, my niggas

Swing My Door,Gucci Mane,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Burn one, burn one

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm a gold mouth dawg, definition of the South
Ain't no quarters, ain't no halves, just some wholes in 'dis house
Ain't no bitch, it ain't no bed, it ain't no clothes in dis house
It's a drought, and my price will make yo eyes pop out
I can't neva count my stash 'cause I always loose count
I can't neva keep no bitch 'cause I put them hoes out
I was corner store and in the motel in it, selling it
You can check my rap sheet, its numerous felonies
I took twenty-three stacks, and bought some jet skis
Have pity for the cop who gotta arrest me
A front street, jump street, then jump out, itss a track meet
Use to have a ten-speed, now I got a Bentley

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Swing my door, swing my door
Every time they swing my door
I count 18-5 every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
Yeah, them prices real low
But they gon' search you up and down
Every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
And you know they swing my door
And it's 18-5 every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
Yeah, them prices real low
But they gon' search you up and down
Every time they swing my door
[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I got my rims finger-fucked by a god dam J
Gave him 1.8 of some hard ass yay
It's a lot of crack smokers in the apartments where I stay
And I know they name and face 'cause I serve them everyday
Had a 98' Caprice, was a rollin' drug store
You ain't got all the money, what you call my phone fo'?
Rob me, six feet, in the dirt you 'bout to go
Layin' with the coroner with a tag placed on your toe
I can lock the whole town if I break the shit down
But it might be slow, so I'm sellin' shit whole
I can lock the whole town if I break the shit down
But I'm lettin' shit go and I'm sellin' shit whole

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Swing my door, swing my door
Every time they swing my door
I count 18-5 every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
Yeah, them prices real low
But they gon' search you up and down
Every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
And you know they swing my door
And it's 18-5 every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
Yeah, them prices real low
But they gon' search you up and down
Every time they swing my door
[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Niggas call me ""thrift store"" 'cause the know the price low
I count 18 rubber bands every time I swing my door
Breaker, breaker, beaker, beaker
Spent 350 on the sneakers
It came from servin' geekers
Yella' 'Vette nicknamed Chiquta
A clear coat Chevy, same color Aquafina
Quarter million dollar lick, that changed my whole demeanor
Ridin' a scooter through South Beach, lookin' for a Trina bitch
Diamond necklace, diamond anklet, diamond princess, Bimmer bitch
I change lanes, paint change, hangin' out the brain dawg
Bottles of champagne and it came from sellin 'caine dawg
Coca-cola, pickin' yola, and it stank, you smell the odor
When I sk-sk-sk-sk-skrrt, I bet it jump back over, over
Ridin' in my rental, got a Rover in my pocket, though
84 stack, 'bout to take a trip to Mexico
Nigga violate, I'ma kill him and slit his throat
Smoke a blunt of dro, then take my ho to Pappadeaux's

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Swing my door, swing my door
Every time they swing my door
I count 18-5 every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
Yeah, them prices real low
But they gon' search you up and down
Every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
And you know they swing my door
And it's 18-5 every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
Yeah, them prices real low
But they gon' search you up and down
Every time they swing my door, nigga

Street Niggaz,Gucci Mane,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","I'm a street nigga, dog, everybody knows that
So a hater get smashed, bond money on deck
Gave my dog half a brick for a '73 donk
Got that bullfrog yay, cause I know it's gon' jump
I'm a real street nigga, do you understand me?
I'm a walking bankroll, breezy, rubber-band me
Red Monkeys on my ass, Gucci frames on my face
Got that ""Tony Tiger Kush,"" man, pimpin' smoke great
Every time my phone ring, dog, it's eighteen-five
Only problem that I have is what car I'm gon' drive
Im a real street nigga, I ain't never had shit
Man, this chain 'round my neck cost four or five bricks
I'm a street nigga, dog, I don't love no bitch
I ain't talkin' to you, baby, 'less you buyin' ten bricks
Bought an '06 Lamb' with the butterfly doors
That's a quarter-million dollars gone, just to pull hoes

(Chorus)
I'm a street nigga, dog
I'm a street nigga, dog
You a street nigga, just like me
I'm a street nigga, dog
I'm a street nigga, dog
No industry, I'm in these streets
Im a street nigga, dog, hoes love my swag
And the Jacob on my wrist, that's a drop-top Jag
Bought a drop-top Vette, and a super-bad bitch
""How much you think you worth?""
'Bout 95 bricks
Way back in '94, it was 95 cents
Now I'm 95 south, with an R&B bitch
Every time I leave the house, bring at least ten grips
Cause it's two or three stacks just to park my whips
Got a small amount of niggas, but a large amount of clips
And a blue Bent' Coupe same color as the Crips
Mean mug on my face, nigga, ain't nothin funny
60 grand on the Jacob, nigga, time costs money
Got a quarter million plate, that's eighteen blocks
When the cops try to whip me, man, I ain't gon' stop
Im a real street nigga, dog, I ain't gon' lie
Bought a pound of Bubba Kush, just to get the clique high

(Chorus)

I'm a street nigga, dog, so I love my whip
Car-jack a street nigga, that's how niggas get killed
Im a street nigga, dog, so I love my block
Paid a junkie three grams just to wash my drop
Street niggas love me, and I love street niggas
Got an out of town trap, come twice a week, nigga
Im an East Atlanta vet, man, I ain't done yet
Bitches standin' in line just to wipe my sweat
If you make a good count,then you under good check
Never beef with street niggas, dog, that's ya best bet
Street niggas make a college bitch's panties so wet
To a project bitch, I'm the best it's gon' get
Street nigga of the year, dog, yeah, that's me
Just to see my wrist twirl, man, it's eighteen G's
Gucci eatin' real good, dog, what about you?
Im a street nigga, dog, you a street nigga too?

Beautiful Lasers 2 Ways,Lupe Fiasco,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: Poo Bear]
There's only two ways out
Of here
You're way too late, you'll be trapped here
Forever
There's only two ways out
Of here
One's through the door
The other's through me

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Ugh, sometimes, living in a world like this
It's pretty hard not to go insane
Not pretty if you don't comply
Pretty easy if you don't complain
Stand there like you don't feel pain
No tears in the face of defeat
Pretend 'til the end that you don't fear change
Don't admit that your faith is weak
Don't say that you feel like dying
Life's hard, and it feels like diamonds
Your home's just far too gone
Much too late to even feel like trying
Can't understand what I'm saying?
Can't figure out what I'm implying?
If you feel you don't wanna be alive
You feel just how I am
I'm on the dark side
And you can't come find him
How, when it's light all around you?
Yeah, but it's dark all inside him
No winners when it's me against me
One of us just ain't gonna survive
My heart been broke for a while
Your's been the one keepin' me alive
[Chorus: Poo Bear]
There's only two ways out
Of here
You're way too late, you'll be trapped here
Forever
There's only two ways out
Of here
One's through the door
The other's through me

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
This world is such a fucked up place
My mind's such a fucked up shape
Everything down here sucks
Maybe what's up there is great
We all gotta go one day
I just wanna cut to the chase
I wanna stop these nightmares
I just wanna touch your face
All you see is all my feats
All I see is all my flaws
All I hear is all my demons
Even through your applause
All you see is all my flights
Well, all I see is all my falls
All you see is all my rights
All I see is all my wrongs
Door keep telling me to fight
Gun on my table telling me to come on
Telling me to to put him inside my hand
Then put it up right next to my dome
Door keep telling me to find a reason
Anything to keep me from squeezing
Simplest things, yeah, you really like summer
You really like music, you really like reading
Love! I can't win if it's me against me
One of us ain't gonna survive
And my heart been broke for a while
Yours been the one keepin' me alive
Yours been the one keepin' me alive
Yours been the one keepin' me alive
[Chorus: Poo Bear]
There's only two ways out
Of here
You're way too late, you'll be trapped here

How You Love Me,Talib Kweli,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
I hear footsteps, in the dark
Feel like I'm goin fuckin crazy

[Hook: Blaqthoven]
Every day since we first met
Can't even eat a bit
I can't seem to think straight
When I think about how you love me
Everyday is like a holiday
Something like Christmas Eve
My worst day is carefree
When I think about how you love me

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
When are we gonna grow up?
Why do I love you so much we so touched?
Excited by the drama we like when it show up
The fightin don't slow up, I light you like close ups
And I call you my Calamity Jane, you like my fantasy
Love cause the same chemical reaction in the brain as insanity
Holidays drinkin wit'cha family... passionate folks
Imagine if they had they own reality show - actually no
Desire's like fire; quit playin or get burned
Or give it away on camera like Montana Fishburne
Our presence is a gift, a gift is our presence
Breakup text call her a bitch under my breath
And then the makeup sex she forgive me in a session
I know she love me, she sendin a mixed message though
[Hook: Blaqthoven]
Every day since we first met
Can't even eat a bit
I can't seem to think straight
When I think about how you love me
Everyday is like a holiday
Something like Christmas Eve
My worst day is carefree
When I think about how you love me

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
You need a chick with some fire
I mean unless you want a wife cold as ice
Livin life with the biggest debutante
Me and you we considered the upper echelon
The only one I come out my fitted for in a restaurant
You can get it huh; remember I was takin your digits
Same night I was makin the visit
Make it the mission to make you cum
When we done sometimes you hate to admit it
You a little numb from the toys
And love the noise that you make when you run from the boys
And comfort your man, insane how we go so crazy with it
This the asylum, so we call relationships committed
You ain't a bird I ain't them others guys that get lost in the name
You the butterfly, and I'm the moth to your flame
Love is dying while the mother's cryin
Big brother eyein me imposin their reality to Shutter Island
[Hook: Blaqthoven]
Every day since we first met
Can't even eat a bit
I can't seem to think straight
When I think about how you love me
Everyday is like a holiday
Something like Christmas Eve
My worst day is carefree
When I think about how you love me

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
Our love is like a saga or a trilogy, the drama is killin me
I'm grown but the little boy is still in me
We discuss monogamy polygamy, the I's the probability
Your momma ain't feelin me, it stung like a killer bee
How far from the tree do the apple fall?
The things I said - was it how I felt, was it the alcohol?
Or do I really hate her after all?
I apologize for the statements that I made to her
First I swallowed my pride, then I ate my words
I tried to pass it off acted like it was nothin
The fact is I was discoverin my appetite for destruction
Everything else is bland once you tasted filet mignon
When I'm full I'm takin you home, you a plate for later on
I'll eat it up... or beat it up
Til your love runneth over, yo I need a cup
[Hook: Blaqthoven]
Every day since we first met
Can't even eat a bit
I can't seem to think straight
When I think about how you love me
Everyday is like a holiday
Something like Christmas Eve
My worst day is carefree
When I think about how you love me"
Temptation,J. Cole & Kendrick Lamar,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: JaVonte,  J. Cole]
Before we walk, we must crawl
We run when temptation calls
Before we walk, we must crawl
We run when temptation calls
Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, often I'm caught up in confusion, in need of dissolution
They tell me the solution to see through this illusion I'm living
A few friends killed, a few sent to prison
Our mamas tried to warn us, but few tend to listen
See, we running the streets, in search of some trouble, at least
A couple of freaks to sneak home with
Now she ride a nigga dick, just like she owned it
So every time I wanna hit, I bet you she on deck
She got the bad lips, bad hips, damn shawty
Slim waist, Gina face, Pam body
Met her in the club, little liquor led to love
That's the reason why my niggas can't find me, good golly
Look, shawty, ain't no need for games
I know a nigga still young, but I don' seen some things
If it's cool to talk, let me ease your pain
This is food for thought, let me feed your brain
Your ex-man did you dirty, did he leave a stain?
When them losers talk, tell 'em ""please refrain.""
I refuse to stop, don't freeze the frame
Cause tonight, I got you calling out Jesus name, hey
[Hook: J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, JaVonte]
Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey
Before we walk, we must crawl
But we run when temptation calls
Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey
Before we walk, we must crawl
But we run when temptation calls

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Often I'm caught up in confusion in tryna find solutions
To try and pimp the system that's a form of prostitution, I'm ready
The city probably see me as a nuisance, deadly
Singing the Devil's song in a repetitive medley, I know
But shorty fire and she admire that I'm a pyro
Maniac, I said ""Where you at, and do you have Geico?
I need insurance that you could sex me the best.""
And she started sexting through texts
And sent pictures under her dress
Got them G-Strings, she beasting for the pleasure and pain
I was a weakling, so I cling to her under my name
Gave her the ding-ding, then ""ding ding,"" the bell ringing again
It was intriguing that she seen, don't no stand
No flow, keeping it wet, making it rain
Beg your pardon, don't blowjob, she no jobs like Tommy from Martin
The blowjobs, she blow hard like a Nintendo cartridge
That blowjob had genius like Mozart
Got blowjob, then put it in her trunk like Goyard
I'm starting off with that Cuevo
Shop on Rodeo, house in the Dagos
We like to fuck and watch the day go by
Hasta luego, drop the potato
She's hot, what can I say, yo?
[Hook: J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, JaVonte]
Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey
Before we walk, we must crawl
But we run when temptation calls

Yeah
Come!

Let's go
??

[Verse 1: K'naan]
Bundle up my whole style is so cold
I glow like old guys who go bald
My flow got no front in the vocal
Your flow got no button it's so old
I don't mean to sound like a showboat
But it's true my persona's no joke
I stepped into some kinda portal
I'm legend and sometimes I'm noble
I'm from the most risky zone, oh
No place is more shitty global
More pistols, Russian revolvers
We shootin' all that is normal
But it ain't just because we want to
We ain't got nowhere we can run to
Somebody please press the undo
They only teach us the things that guns do
[Hook: K'naan & Rayzak]
They don't teach us the ABC's
We play on the hard concrete
All we got is life on the streets
All we got is life on the streets

All we got is life on the streets
All we got is life on the streets

[Verse 2: Chubb Rock]
Rock, you know my era
B-boy seasoning, Salt-N-Pepa
Grown and sexy, come with the extra
Crushed-up linen, fly like Cessna
This type-groove, I gave it birth
Now, it's time again to give it a verse
Jamaican born, not a fan of the ganja
Boulevard, Brooklyn to Somalia
And it goes in the background
Playa, that is my sound
The green doesn't symbolize, I made it on the top
Pioneer, legend, and they call me Mr. Rock
No B-word or N-word, I don't need those words
Respect for hers
The game dried up, so we come with the grease
Leading you right and treating you right, so, peace!

They don't teach us the ABC's
We play on the hard concrete

We play on the hard concrete
All we got is life on the streets
All we got is life on the streets

[Verse 3: K'naan]
Superman I'm known by the locals
As this dude who's so fly it's global
Attitude that came outta struggle
Destitute but I make it hopeful
You real but my real is tenfold
My real will make yours a rental
Gangsta if it is, essential
Fight with guns or utensils
So bold, nothing's confidential
Breakfast was not continental
And lunch could not compliment all
We still become competent souls
These streets ain't paved with no gold
Matter fact someone stole the light pole
Nobody fat enough for lypo
They don't teach us to read and write, so
[Hook: K'naan & Rayzak]
They don't teach us the ABC's
We play on the hard concrete

State Run Radio,Lupe Fiasco,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Matt Mahaffey]
You must be a radio station
And who are we, we must be
A number one song, spinnin' all day long
And over again and over again
And over again and over again
And over again
And we don't win when we call in and nothing's free
Sounds to me like
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
We interrupt this broadcast
To bring you this special message about the forecast
The future's cloudy and it's raining on the poor class
Road to peace is closed, heavy traffic on the war paths
Love is balling on a budget
The military's says it's gon' need more cash
To keep fighting for your gas, keep us in our hoods
And hope we never explore past, stay inside of your half
Believe the lies you learn in your class
That there's no treasure in your trash
And a Sealy has the same feeling as the floor has
And that's where you should stay; this is what they play
[Hook: Matt Mahaffey]
Over again and over again
And over again and over again
And over again
And we don't win
When we call in and nothing's free
Sounds to me like
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
You're now tuned into the weakest
Frequency of fear, keep you locked right here
And hope you never leave this, never be a leader
Think inside the box, and follow all procedures
Never ever believe that, you will never need this
Hit up all your friends and tell them to repeat this
Hi you're on the air, now what you want to hear
Well we ain't got the truth but how about a remix
Different is never good, good is only what we pick
You ain't got a hit, unless it sounds like these did
Not too smart, you will be a superstar
And if you dumb it some, maybe you could be number one
[Hook: Matt Mahaffey]
Over again and over again
And over again and over again
And over again
And we don't win
When we call in and nothing's free
Sounds to me like
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
So beware what's on the airwaves
And be more aware of what's not gettin' airplay
Independent spirit, you can barely hear what they're sayin'
Truth ain't getting on like shampoo on an airplane
Propaganda's everywhere, constantly on replay
All the hits, all the time, back-to-back on relay
We're really where it lives, make them hear the records we play
Build your own station, become your own DJs

[Bridge: Matt Mahaffey]
You must be a radio station
And who are we, we must be
A number one song, spinnin' all day long
And you put me on daily rotation
You're on the air, we know you're scared
But we don't care, we'll play this here
[Hook: Matt Mahaffey]
Over again and over again
And over again and over again
And over again
And we don't win

Does It Really Matter,K'naan,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Yea, uhhh.. Its K'naan.. Yea, uuhh. About to take over with this, here we go I check it...

[Verse 1---K'naan]
They don`t expect me on this beat, the thunder on the street
But I never turn the cheek, surrender or retreat
You can bet that I am strong, trying to right what is wrong
They say it won't be long, keep on singing your song
But ayo you need a single, single to make a mingle
Something that's kinda simple, I'd hate to call it jingle
A single is a missile, takes you right to the middle of 106 and park and maybe Jimmy Kimmel
You'll need somebody famous co-signing for your anus
Who you got on the album I don't see where the name is
But I do it my own way I do it my own way I do, if you do what you do your own way you could be famous too

(CHORUS)

If the beat is hot does it matter where or who its from?
If the flow is hot does it really matter where I'm from?
If the song is hot does it matter cause the DJ dumb?
If the girl is hot does it really matter where she's from?
If the beat is hot does it matter where or who its from?
If the flow is hot does it really matter where I'm from?
If the club is hot does it really matter how we bump?
If the girl is hot does it really matter where she's from?
[Verse2---K'naan]
I coulda been from the west side or the Chi-Town like twista
With a flow so sick it blow you to bits it will show you the glits and gold in the wrist and the boat in the fish and I blow them a kiss, -?lets blow give them em a sweet talking in a piss while taking a piss?- are you talking to the fish or the girls in the boat exposing their tits

I coulda been from N.Y. like Rakim with the my pen
I can get paid in full  with praise and tools erased and rules my case of jewels I'm cold like a glacial cool with blades and fools I'm raging bulls

I coulda been from L.A like Dre and Snoop
Rolling in my six-four with fresh case jewels
And I'm riding on 'em niggas unless they cool
And I got border troubles like 'em essays fool

I coulda been- I coulda been from the dirty like A town or M.I.A
I could ride an invisible motor cycle and go HEY (echo hey hey)
Storm like the hurricane and I don't mean ay-bay-bay
I'm from Africa where they say K'naan- boom-aye-ay

(repeat chorus)

If you wanna make it hot then you better do a drop (echoes drop drop drop drop drop drop...)
If you wanna get a hit you better auto-tune this shit (shit, ooh yea...)
And he is tougher than you suckers none of you could ever bark at him
Look at him make you tough guys look like you are from suckatem
I do it my own my own my I do it my own way I do...If you do what you do your own way you could be famous too

It's Blacc Friday and I'm glad to be black

[Hook]
What do we do on Blacc Friday?
Chill with my crew on Blacc Friday
Get in the mood on Blacc Friday
You know what? Nigga, it's Blacc Friday
What do we do on Blacc Friday?
Chill with my crew on Blacc Friday
Get in the mood on Blacc Friday
Cause it's Friday, it's Blacc Friday
[Verse 2: Tyler]
White bitches, white girls, white drugs
Black girls don't do it but my type does
Fuck it in my white van, beat her with a nice white nightstand
Until I give her gashes where it's nothin' but the white meat
E-T-I-H, W's, double D's on her knees
White gargle yellow fuckin' bumblebees
Use whitey's as my dinner course for intercourse
So much fuckin' white make Darth Vader have a thinner force
But of course, I'm the white boy that shows no remorse
Pull up on a stark with enough white to kill a horse
Nigga Friday, fuck a Blacc Friday, umm
Wolf Gang make a white pregnant bitch wan' abort
Bring the remainin' red and white pieces to the fort
Odd Future, there wolves bang where a couple bears hang
With a white box logo with a couple stains
From a black creampie in a whitey, make it light gray

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mike G]
Gravis black box, gray Hundreds sox
Everythin' new, so my whole team rock like Metallica
Gun metal twenty-ten Challenger
Shit stress free I ain't even gon' hassle her
I just play my part make moves like chess
Ask your bitch who the best, question mark like Guess?
Make a mess outta tracks, got my hat back
Shades dark as fuck so all I see is black
Bet that, look I'm a Hot Topic nigga
My attire dark lookin' like a Gothic nigga
Spit shit take off like a rocket, nigga
Got the whole West coast in my pocket nigga
Pitch the rock, Mike Vick, swag so sick
Ask 'bout me bitch, dressed like an eclipse
Tell the truth, this shit wouldn't be fun without me
Bitch I'm drawing Black Lines ask the Hundreds about me

G.O.A.T.,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
And I’m willing to borrow your grass
But I specialize in eating MC's
In the immortal words of LL Cool J
As he would say: ""I'm a G.O.A.T.!""
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is
It means the Greatest Of All Time
And I consider myself one of those
So thank you very much, here it goes

[Verse 1]
This is the part I was worried about
Everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes
And I'm in some dusty garage
Inhalin' them carbon monoxide fumes
And everyone's tellin' me what I should do
And how I should come out and what to rap about
And I know that I got a lot up
In my medulla oblongata that I gotta get out
And I'm not sure how this is gonna come off
They're probably gonna think that I'm comin' off as cocky
Like I just started givin' a fuck what you really think about me
See, the thing about me
Is you don't really know a thing about me
Everyone's makin' a stink about me
Like there's some kind of an aura of that of the king around me
Surround me with nothin' but gangsters
Killers and bangers and the most dangerous criminals
And I feel like I'm more comfortable around them
Than I do my own motherfuckin' neighbors
But see, my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when I leave
But why does it seem like I'm not even put up in the same category as other MC's?
So when Weezy says that he's better than Jay Z
Please be that just subliminally
Means he thinks Jigga's the best
And that he's the only one up in that league, see
And it's easy just to consider me
One of the greatest white rappers there is
Knowin' goddamn well that I'm one of the best motherfuckin' rappers who ever lived, period
[Hook]
I'm a G.O.A.T. and I don't mean to gloat
But I know what I know and I know what you think
And these magazines'll never put it in ink
Because how would it look if they considered me as a G.O.A.T.?
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is
It means the Greatest Of All Time
And I consider myself one of those
So thank you very much, here it goes

[Verse 2]
Maybe they figure that I'm on my way out the game
So they gotta go try to find 'em a new Eminem or a new Shady
If they think it's gonna happen, man, I thought I was crazy
Or maybe I could be takin' it wrong
And they're tryna pay homage to me in a strange way
So let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way
See, you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringin' up Paul Wall's white
‘Cause lyrically he doesn't pose a threat to anyone, see, he's just aight
And Bubba Sparxxx, he just won't write
Because he's so caught up in that snow white
That Timbaland can't even get him in the studio
He's so gone off that coke, right?
And it's so sad ‘cause he's dope, right?
America's next great white hope, right?
So now they feel like they gotta come up with some corny-ass White Rapper Show, right?
And which I'm still havin' mixed feelings about
They said it'd be real, I'm just spillin' it out
There's somethin' about a white boy talkin' black
And runnin' around with a damn grill in his mouth
And I love when the say that Tiger Woods shit
""Isn't it ironic that the best rapper's white
And the best golfer's black?""
And I'm the one who's gotta catch all the flack off of that
But these are the people who never had heard of an Eminem until 8 Mile had came out
But I had already hit middle America
Parents had all got to likin' me now
When suddenly I wasn't such a bad guy
All of the hatred for me must've died
Thought I committed career suicide
So I had to turn back into the bad guy
So faggoty faggoty faggoty gays
Anatomy God made Raggedy Ann and Andy
Not Raggedy Andy and Andy and Andy
And Angelina Jolie is just another ho
And Brad is a sucka, because once I fuck her
She wants to go to Somalia to adopt another baby
You know what I say? — ""No.""
You better save some of them kids from Madonna
She needs all the publicity she can get
You wanted Shady, well you got it, man, I ain't apologizin' for shit
[Hook]
I'm a G.O.A.T. and I don't mean to gloat
But I know what I know and I know what you think
And these magazines'll never put it in ink
Because how would it look
If they considered me as a G.O.A.T.?
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is
It means the Greatest Of All Time
And I consider myself one of those
So thank you very much, here it goes

[Outro]
Man, I'm takin' my ball and goin' home
Man, shit is too easy
Nobody even wants to pass me the ball
‘Cause I'm a G.O.A.T
So don't worry, I'm out the motherfuckin' game
And y'all can sit and argue about who's the motherfuckin' best
But y'all know that I'm a G.O.A.T
And like I said, I'm one of the motherfuckin' best
Before you get your panties in a motherfuckin' bunch
But before I go, I'd like to say fuck you very much
To everybody who wasn't there from the start
And thank you very much to everybody who was
And y'all ain't gotta say it, just think it
‘Cause I know that you know that I know
That you know that I know that I'm a G.O.A.T
I'm out y'all, it's been real—peace!"
Learn the Language,Mr. Dream,['rock'],"Learn my name
It's a fake name
Kinda stupid but I'll never care

Touch my boots
They're not sport boots
That stuff's garbage that I'd never wear

Drive my bus
It's a good bus
Runs on good vibes, takes you anywhere

See my girl
She's a good girl
Wears a headband, but don't ever stare

Letting Go,Lupe Fiasco,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Instrumental and Percussion Intro]

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco]
Things are getting outta control
Feels like I'm running out of soul
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
You are getting heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
My self portrait shows a man that the wealth tortured
Self-absorbed with his own self-forfeit
A shelf full of awards
Worshiping the war ships that set sail on my sea of life
When I see my old self I wonder if we still see alike
We was tight seeing lights, speaking right and breathing life
Now I see my demons and barely even sleep at night
I don't get high, life keep me at a decent height
As the old me I predicted all my recent plights
Exhausted, trying to fall asleep, lost inside my recent fights
Burdens on my shoulders now, burnin' all my motives down
Inspiration drying up, motivation slowing down
[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco]
Things are getting outta control
Feels like I'm running out of soul
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
You are getting heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
I'm begging me don't let me go, we vow like the letter ""O""
To never go our separate ways and spin-off into separate shows
Tired of all the wardrobe changin', playing all these extra roles
Filled with all these different spirits, livin' off these separate souls
Point in life is getting hollow, can't wait for the exit hole
Give me room the entry wound, let me in and let me go
So I can roam around this wilderness
See it for what it really is, unprepared and filterless
Magnify the youth in me, alibi the shootin' spree
Amplify the revolution, sanitize the lunacy
Strip away the justice, justify the scrutiny
I can see the lasers, shootin' out of you and me

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco]
Things are getting outta control
Feels like I'm running out of soul
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
You are getting heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
[Bridge: Lupe Fiasco]
Sometimes I feel like the world—
Sometimes I feel like the world
Is against me
And everything that I've done before
I swear we used to be so pure
But we can't be in love no more
'Cause I don't wanna fight this war
But when I put down my gun
I turn around and pick up one
This Uzi weighs a ton
But I think I'm done

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco]
Things are getting outta control
Feels like I'm running out of soul
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
You are getting heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh

[Outro: Sarah Green]
Think I'll be letting you go
Things are getting outta control
Said, it feels like I'm running out of soul
You're getting heavy to hold
I think I'll be letting you go
Letting you go"
Body Bag Remix,Fabolous,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Cam'Ron]
Yo Fab what up nigga
Funeral Service, Killa Season, Slime Flu
Lot of shit going on
Let's get ready to go in though

[Verse 1: Cam'Ron]
Huh, I said, ice in the ceramic band?
Damn it Cam, Cam is stuntin'
Weed in a picnic basket, bastard hit the panic button
Over a piece of paper, street sweepers, meat cleavers
Deep freezer, meet your maker, place your order, we the waiters
Coke, keep it catered, feet are 'gator, keep the flavors
Main course, meat potatoes, keep your favours, see ya later
The crew Damier, black and grey, we the Raiders
Diamonds in my ear, please baby these are lasers, haters
Front on me? Huh, I doubt it punk
Pop the trunk, my goons, high noon, out to lunch
The D&G bag? That's where the weed stash
Keep cash, breeze past, fuck y'all, eat glass
My tank on full, ease gas
Stay on point with the white, (like who?) Steve Nash
Gun go in the waist, dun' dough, I get cake
Me and funeral Fab, front row at your wake
[Hook: Vado]
Hit 'em up, shotty blast, zipped up, body bag
Fifth tucked, then what? Bullets hit your body fast
We beatin' murderers with the same lawyer Gotti had
Tie him to a pick-up truck and watch his body drag

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Funeral, Killa, this just got very scary
All the competitions in the cemetery buried
Jesus piece, rosary, black white canary jerry
Pardon me, it's the God in me, marry Mary
But all them long stares ain't necessary, hear me?
Cannon with me, not the one Mariah Carey carry
I'm talking sawed offs and four fizzies
Fuck knocking on the door, to blow the doors off, its more easy
I'm at the top floor of the Waldorf, for four seazzys
Knick game, never caught off the floor seazzys
Tonight they lost, fought Lakers, ask Walt Frazier
We had a little bet, wouldn't say a vault breaker
But watch your mouth, I'm not the best insult taker
I make them call the yellow tapers and the chalk tracers
They got names for niggas like y'all, its called ""fakers""
They should put anthrax in your salt shakers

[Hook: Vado]
[Verse 3: Vado]
In due time let your semi spray, they kidnap my slime
On a rainy day, I got them back with two 9's and 20k
Timberland boxes of plenty yay, more squares than Damier
Our records carry Fs like a Fendi case. Huuhh!
Four, five meetings make a long day
Rap LeBron James 23 a whole ball game
That's what we call cane, black rocks, all dames
No slaves, suit and jewels, pin stripe, ball chain. Haa!
Skinny nigga on his ?? shit
Benz doors go up like the arms on the Karate Kid
A cocky kid, no rappers but my pockets big
""Can I Live"" bumpin' pumpin' out my mamas crib
Burners, mayhem murders
Gangland, double black suit, white tie off Space Jams
I'm causing funeral 'rangements, wake plans
I'm Paid In Full, y'all ain't rich like Ace, man

To every soldier in the hood, go in
To every real nigga holding, keep your ones on folding
Take it from a ninja and scribe, stay alive
Keep rolling, and keep your guns on swollen

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Aiyo, joint loaded, Lotus, big chain cobras
Cloth the certain way, notice
My style's new now, with generals luau, drugs, guns
Chilling on the cool out, don't make me pop you, this is not cool
Guaranteed to give you something that works, you're dumped in the dirt
Shitting up blood, fingers is burnt
Many cycles when you fight in my walls, it's like Michael and the Bulls
See a flying piece of iron, no lying
No fib and no bullshitting, the shines is forbidden
We like Crouching Tiger, you just a fucking kitten
Bout to get that wig re-open and then smoked in
Bitches is watching, snatch you in the open, yo
Twenty-four, seven, we legends, the myth, the riff the gift
Shaolin bounded with more whiff
Clap 'em with them get down boys, we call them the niggas
Who want it with us, we the belt holders in the business

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Yo, ay, the streets be calling and shit
A lot of veterans be calling it quits
They be calling my flow ill, but still I'm never calling in sick
This is Meth Man, New York niggas calling me piff
Fuck the cops that be calling me Cliff, flag me down on the Concord
Police dogs all up in my whip
I get cake, women all in mix, they wanna jump in the six
And groupie niggas wanna jump in your flicks
We live the life, Scarfaces and guns, I used to fight for crumbs
Throw an ace, kick the dice and run
Plead your case, you ain't nice as son, I got the drive to win
So where you niggas get your license from?
Bite an ear, Mike Tyson, uh, that means dough and my nose itch
And coke fiends is blowing they noses
My team got cream and you know this
So nigga get yours, before the door to opportunity closes

Some niggas sell CDs up out they trunk, man
Some niggas they go to school for that higher learnin'

And half the next day
And expect us to be home when you get there
But let me tell you something
The sisters are not going for that no more
'Cause we realize two things;
That you aren't doing anything for us
Than we can do better by ourselves
So from now on
We gonna use what we got to get what we want
So, oh...

You'd better think, think
It was the time when we had respect
That's the thing I never will forget
Now baby I got a life to live
And a whole lotta loving
That I wanna give, yeah
But before I give it up I gotta think, think
What the future holds for me
You go ahead and see
I don't need no heartache
I can't stand no misery
Let me think, think

So think about the good things
Come on and think about the right things
You got to think about me, too
Come on and think, I'll think about you

I got a letter from the DMV the other day
I opened and read it, it said they were suckers
They tried to tell me that my license was suspended
I got offended for a minute then pretended
That I never even got the damn letter
It's nine o'clock on the dot, so I think I'd better
Scoot off to school, 'cause in class there's a test
I gotta dress fast, grab my glasses and my vest
Oh damn, as hardheaded as I am
Hopped in my hooptie ride, pumped up the jam
Put it in reverse into first and disperse and
From that very moment on my day got worse

As I was standing in the street, I suddenly seen the smoke
I know that Derrick's on his way, I ran to get my coat
And a bag from the room, it took a minute, boom
Hopped into the car, we drove away in a zoom
I assume doom as we were drivin' on the gravel
At any given minute we could have a shortened travel
So I ramble about my life is that's in shambles
Shoulda took the bus
A bus without the silence or some old Nikes
I wish we had good bikes
We need to exercise, maybe we could take a hike
An' you could give Sheri back those car keys
Because everywhere I walk I would not have to say please

Away to our destination
No license no insurance, not even registration
Tags on the plate say December '82
Car's so dirty it looks gray, but it's really blue
Who would think we're up to good
Four black niggas ridin' through the neighborhood
In hats and glasses, makin' funny passes
Like drivin' slowly, playin' low-key for asses
Knowin' damn well one-time will harass us
And all the while, we see girls jog
Sheri's little car is pourin' out smog
Then we made a right and I spotted one in tights (ooh)

You live with your homeboys?
Yeah I live with my homeboys

I'm wishin' that the coppers would get off my ass
My tail, can't go to jail 'cause it's wack
What would happen to my girl and my record contract
Yo fellas (what), take off the baseball caps
Word up I heard that the nerves get tapped
And throw on the glasses and give up the tees

Not to look hard, I was out on my grind
But I got a good heart, how can I lie?
Look past my appearance, the hoodie and the low bats
The screw face and the woolie when it's cold
And Lewi, it's cold
Oh I'm so in tune with the seasons
And by now you fully well know
Oh I'm so improved it's appealing
Niggas wanna know what tune I'm releasing next
Tune in The Movement is speaking
And there's no Rules or Regulations
Just tools to penetrate them
And I'll celebrate when, I've got the game locked
You'll get a straight ten, you got a waste job
You can't see that then you'd better change lens
Crack shotters weigh rocks, coppers raid blocks
Robbers they rob, 'cos that's what they do
I gotta stay strong, It's a man-made zoo
Where we are the animals, niggas are hungry
And what you've got can't feed half a cannibal
These niggas'll kidnap your bitch
And make your sweetheart mechanical, tied up like a puppet on a string
We are that radical, ski masks when the hammer's pulled
And you know the manor talk, they don't care when the man's a corpse
In fact some stand and applaud, don't stand in my way
You won't be able to stand in a war, paralysed when I grab a guy
Standard assault, can't stand him a bit
Can't stand him at all, stand with a clique
I'll stand with a tool
A lone soldier
And if you niggas wanna boast about a 20 to 1 brawl
Be my guest, my pride's gonna be my death, I'm an East side rep
I'll beat my tech 'til I see a guy's flesh

Might do a feature for a EMI cheque

Do moves if you have to, fuck it
Shoot if you have to, fuck it

We stuck, we blow, we on fire with no arson
Glocks for hire, it's no bargain
Yeah they got bodies on 'em
And niggas have got dough but they ain't got wallets on 'em
Fresh crep everyday, no polish on them
I remember being a young offender
Not a care in the world, never had a record
So I weren't scared of the cell
So I'm going on run - some surrender
But nobody ain't sharing the world
So I'm going on Hun(t) and then become and emperor
I know niggas ain't hearing I've failed
Look I'm right there on the shelf so my parents are pleased
But still I could make an appearance in Felt
So I ain't gonna lie, I'm here with the heat
So I ain't gonna die from some fear of some beef
I'd rather squeeze, take off half your cheek
Then take off in your car with the P's, stay calm when I pass police
Rule 1: When the force come, if you man are like Reggie
You'll have a alibi ready
Rule 2: In the courtroom look innocent, a screwface ain't helping a bit
Please don't look militant
Rule 3 is all me: Just lie through your teeth and say you're a good citizen
Rule 4: If you break laws, have a lawyer on standby, you don't want Legal Aid
Them solicitors are deceitful
Rule 5: Don't expect to bust case in a fortnight
Rule 6: Keep a strap and a full clip, be ready for bullshit, bury them all quick
There ain't no telling me fourth
Rule 7: When you pull weapons, never pull second
Rule 8: Stay on the grind so you're never short changed

Our neighbors didn't park in our driveway anymore, even though we didn't have a car. I mean at 13, I was making more money than most of the grownups in the neighborhood.

Life ain't always nice, that's how shit goes
And you know we're going on black 'cause we're blick rows
And I can't be seen with these sick hoes
Where did I stay last night? I think your chick knows
We were knock-knocking the boots and we kicked toes
Your girl's the same as all bimbos, freaks and nymphos
I've got an idea, make dough on the spot, I mean right here
Nike Air, got paper for the whole year
You can bring drama 'cause I got no fear
And my head feels so clear
Move to the mic, MCs are like ""oh dear""
Some try catching me up but they're not near
Not ever, not now and not here, way too hot here

Shake your batty low, shake your batty high
Don't ask me who, where, when or why
Wanna see your batty rise high to the sky

Ya Bad Chubbs,Chubb Rock,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
This is an introduction
To music that just be pumpin'
While hits just be dippin'
The intention is for humpin' the floor
Shinin' the wood with our jeans
If it's denim don't worry
It's hip hop don't hem 'em
Money earnin' concernin'
I'll be teachin' and learnin'
Gettin' hot from my rhymes and my looks
Not from bourbon
No solution no remedy
No cure like a deodorant
Yo you have to be sure
That if you talk up or walk up into myface
That wouldn't become a big public disgrace
Cause I'll ban you, burn you up, and tan you
Treat you like the elephant
And man you will be hocked and locked in a jar with a lid
Hangin' on a wall in Michael Jackson's crib
Cause I'm bad, in fact I'm a thriller
I drink milk, that's why I'm a top biller
Like a funeral home, I'll make a killing
I'm not Giz even though I'm still chillin'
Guys say that I'm scary, girls say that I'm cuddly
Rough like bark but dark and lovely
This ain't no game and I'm no toy
And like Anita Baker, I'll bring you joy
With my word when I open my mouth
Ask Oliver North to go and break south
A homo is a no-no but you know I'll smack a faggot
Boy, you got to see me, I'm rich like Jimmy Swaggart
I'm a loon and ya know, comin' soon
A rhyme kicked to this Popeye tune
This is hip hop with a little be-bop
And I won't flop cause I can't stop
I will mop up the slop and then go to the top
I am not Robocop, I'm Chubb Rock
[Verse 2]
I'm Chubb Rock risin' and I'll break your leg
And I'm more than a forty ounce, I'm more like a keg
And I'm the big dipper, rippin' like Jack the Ripper
And if you want the proof, the proof is in my liquor
So you knew it and you blew it, let's get to it
Gonna run you over with a rhyme that's like a big Buick
And since you think you're slender, I'll slap you with a fender
And bind you up, wind you up, and grind you up in a blender
And then I'll serve you with coffee and cake
Oh damn, I should've had a V-8, oh well
I'll put you on a plate so it looks a little neater
You're a tramp, so I'll sprinkle salt and pepper
And paprika on your face, like mace
So you can taste immediately
Just like the base that went up your nose previously
So it seems you're too zooed to battle
What up chump, acne bump, skidaddle
You're a nine, I'm a ten
Victory is mine again, this Bud's for me
So here, take a Heineken
With your self-esteem, you will never redeem
Like Martin Luther King, you have a dream
That maybe you will beat me, maybe defeat me
But you're too illiterate, so I won't consider it
Weak is the word and the rhyme is identical
This is not the late show
And I'm not Arsenio Hall
But quite tall with the gall
And I have magic and I can play ball
And guys won't boo this, girls will jsut screw this
It's ludicrous but we can do this
Cause you're new to this, Brutus
I'm so smooth that I'm the smoothest
I'm not handsome but I am the cutest you ever had
That's why I'm so glad that I'm so good I'm bad"

Yeah, but now you're gone and I'm forced to deal with your absence
All alone in this madness, all alone on my mattress
Don't know how the hell did this happen, you knew lovin' me was a hazard
Outcome of my actions, I wish we could go backwards, go back a couple of chapters
Back when there was laughter, back when we first met
Before we came such a disaster
Before your heart got shattered, before I forgot how much you mattered

Can't help of think of you when I'm alone (Come on)
Tried and failed, I call your cell, you don't pick up your phone

The Resistance Remix,SupamanChris,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Yesterday when we were getting high
You werent invited
You would've like it
I-I-I-I know you all too well
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye
But you weren't excited
There's no way to fight it
You can stay but shawty here I go

Verse:1 (Supaman Chris)
Uhh, live in a world full of resistance
A nigga so persistant
Im still goin against em
The type of man that goes all out despite the distance
Cuz thats the one they mention
Do all that for attention?
The world is ours, Words are power
Spittin flows n smokin sour
For countless hours
In my room Buildin bars, to climb this tower
Im startin from the bottom up, im Eddie Bauer..
(laughs)
I am nice and dope, I write the nicest quotes
I got the kinda bars that make them other rappers choke
I tell em I dont smoke, I turn around and toke
You hear the lies in my voice the truths in what I wrote
Im livin in the past, Some things just never last
Im wastin time like theres a hole inside my hour glass
And the escaping sand, reflects just what I am
Just a broken man that finds it so hard to stand
(Chorus)
What am I afraid of?
This is s'pose to be what dream are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
Said You promise me you would never change
Oh U-u-Oh U-u-oh
You promised me you would never change
Oh u-u-oh u-u-oh
Oh

Verse:2 (Truth)
What am I suppose to do in life, go to school or fuck around in life
The only person that gave me peace and quiet is now acting up
Making shit up calling me retarded but when really is that attitude
That your creating making me think about if its my fault for all
That disrespecting I dont really know what took over me I guess its
Just the fact that its a guys human nature got me looking at all the
Women like buried treasures and enjoyed the treasure giving me the
Greatest pleasures, now its like life dont give a fuck about me so
Many thoughts on my mind its killing me I never let life change me
People always said dont never ever let life change you like if thats
Easy too do when I got people just telling me what to do not listening
To what I gotta say and wanna do I'm like a kid in a sand box in this
World sand all in my feet slowling me down not letting me breath
You complain for the life you supposed to have But when you
Try to make plans God is known to laugh ima take life and make it
My bitch thats why I perpose and after this very moment
Im in one with that life I got engaged I became the teacher for
My youngin now its time to teach everyone needs some closer
Baby were all in it till its over
(Chorus)

Verse:3 (Supaman Chris)

Yeah I been thru shit, But don't mistake for weakness
Cause all the hard times did is help me build my defense
And only on the weekends, I let the ganja seep in
Also if we wanna me n kev gon let some freaks in
When livin life, there ain't no time for sleepin
Cause every minute wasted is a goal you could've reached n
Honestly I rather fail tryna be the piece in
The puzzle that im buildin, Im doin it in sequence
Used to have a girl I called the best I ever had
All those misses and I love yous gon get you stabbed
In the back by that bitch
Like the rat that she is
Then she act like she didn't do all of that
But the fact that she did
Give her back to the kid
Sent him back wit his head gone in a lapse
Im pickin up my slack.. and now im comin back
It's the boy truth and supaman on the track"
Different,Sage Francis,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","""Nothing at last is sacred. Oh how the great have fallen
What have I done to myself? It's been way too long!""

We need to reacquaint. Things are different now, I ain't the same man I was
Hi, how are you doing? I'm new and improved with even less to lose
A collector's edition version of a virgin drink ordering cocktail teller
Gone way wrong...to the point of no return

Over the edge and burned out before I even got my shine
Holding my head in pure doubt
Out of insight. Out of mindful things to shout or rhyme about

Yeah, I know I was supposed to change the world and all
Looks like the world got to me first
If you can't beat em, join 'em..
Then hurt the team by beating yourself

I'm different...in a different way
The only thing that stays the same is change
While people claim their states, I state my claims
Sage Francis made a name for himself
For the record my mother calls me Paul
Which was my father's middle name, but Ray
Stepped in and raised me
It's crazy, but this is a game I play
Called ""Shut the fuck uuuuuuup!""

Don't bother calling me at all because I'm not answering
Is that a voice-mail-bomb-threat or her broken promise I'm mishandling?
Gambling away my money issues, somebody owes me big bucks
My career depends on explosive vacuums sucking me in and blowing me up

Poetry struck a nerve in the listenership
Spoken word then got 'em all interested
Now I don't have to serve ice cream to little kids
I get to serve emcees who think they're rippin' it
And poets who think they're somehow significant
Meanwhile both are loud and ignorant
And don't know how to speak to a crowd in an intimate environment

I am different. In a different way
The only thing that stays the same is change
While people claim their states, I state my claims
I'm a quiet natured player who outwardly hates the game
I shake what I got, which is a jingly pocket
Do my mini-market research and make noise for myself when I walk quick

I talk with authority while I question it
When I ask, ""Who am I?"" I'm left guessing
But if you're a poor man's version of ANYTHING
It is your self-perception
Growing up in a microscopic town prepared me well for this petrii dish
Where talk is invisible to the naked eye and I hate the guy they're speaking with
I'm a real vegetarian: No chicken...not even fish
I'm a real underground rapper
My tape quality sucks, my records are warped and my CD skips

Lady Luck is a greedy bitch with itchy palms and a case of the gimmes
But I've got an outtie if she's got an inny
I'll clean her pipes and then sweep her chimney
The beat that's in me is polyrhythmic. You're only 60 heart beats per minute
A human second-hand-me-down-to-earth-guy who will thriftshop-lift his hiphop

I may be getting too big for my britches
But I paid my dues when the cost was climbing
And if I burn too many bridges I'll never get off of this awful island
As long as I've been rhyming, they only started listening
Because for a while they didn't like how
I wouldn't smoke the pot that I was pissin' in

Plus I had no dead homies to pour out the liquor I don't drink
You can flash your shiny objects in front of my eyes and I won't blink
I'm motherfucking different. Oooohhhh yyyeeeaaahhhh..
I'm motherfucking different. Oooohhhh yyyeeeaaahhhh..

Different like a platypus

Well I'm packin' up my game and I'ma head out west
Where real women come equipped with scripts and fake breasts
Find a nest in the Hills, chill like Flynt
Buy an old drop-top find a spot to pimp
And I'ma Kid Rock it up and down ya' block
With a bottle of scotch and watch lots a crotch
Buy a yacht with a flag sayin' ""Chillin' the Most""
Then rock that bitch up and down the coast
Give a toast to the sun, drink with the stars
Get thrown in the mix and tossed outta bars
Sip the Tiajuana, I want to roam
Find Motown, tell them fools to come back home
Start an escort service for all the right reasons
And set up shop at the top of Four Seasons

And I'm headed out west sucker because I wanna be a

It goes (whistling), like dust in the wind

Why they wanna pick on me
Lock me up and snort away my key

(This goes out to the general public)
Yo.. you over there Styles? - Yeah dog
(Anybody sleepin on us)
Second album nigga - two guns up nigga
Real L.O.X. - blaze!
""We Are the Streets"" nigga, y'all know who the best
(C'mon) Fuck y'all niggas wanna do - what, what?
(Let's go)

[Verse One - Styles P. and (Jadakiss)]
Couldn't live the life I live (yo why's that?)
I could die any minute, I get high every minute
Fuckin with snake niggas, and sleepin with foul bitches
(Came through in the latest whip with two pounds in it)
Pull over where the hustlers be (and why's that?)
Cause I get chills when you talk of hustlin ki's
(So I'm always where the powder be at) what it mean?
(I can blow five bricks to ten in an hour if that
Stay away from where the cowards be at) why's that?
(Time is money and god, and you can't get an hour back
Or I would do it again to get the power back
Have Godfather status, make niggas bow to that)
You could all shine and glitter and keep the ones
Fives and tens, for twenties and up, we dummy it up
Make a lot of money, look bummy and what
(Cause money ain't shit, respect is everything
So if I kill niggas dead, don't ask me shit)
I smoke blunts to the head, so don't pass me shit
I'd rather die from a bullet, than a nasty bitch
They say the good die young, all that mean to me
Is that the hood die young, we call it the last days
(What you know about coppin a house to fight pits in)
Or blowin weed smoke on the cops that write tickets
(Henny it up, shit we can semi it up
Have a picture of you on the wall, 'In Memory Of')
Stay in sync with the hood, gray minks with the hood
(We tryin' to get money like) chinks in the hood
They ask me how I'm doing now - (I tell 'em better than them)
And if your man front -( he can get eleven in him )
And if you told them once - (then you better tell him again)
Ay yo, now let's see
Who you know fuckin with Sheek Louch, Jadakiss, and S.P., what!
Chorus: The L.O.X

From dope money to rap money, back to dope money (C'mon)
From loaded guns to empty ones, over dope money (Let's go)
We got the car house and the smoke, with the dope money (C'mon)
All my niggas'll die, over dope money (Let's go)
Bust your nine niggas, side by side niggas (C'mon)
If we get the RICO law, we go run and hide niggas (Let's go)
Death is the only thing that might divide niggas (C'mon)
So don't fuck around with them Ryde or Die niggas (Let's go)

[Verse Two - Jadakiss]
Basically speakin, all I know your face will be leakin
I rap full time and still pump bass on the weekend
And nigga I've been all over the map (and what you learned?)
That niggas with long paper take longer to crack
That's why every chance I buy me a gat
While you rather buy you a chain - I aim at your brain
Nigga, robbery is all we know, so how we gon go broke
When we could always take all y'all dough
And then fly out to Cuba and get in the coke fields
Die off the buddha, fifty with fifty mill
Bring drama cause Gianconna got Kennedy killed
If you come through in a jet, then you frontin to us
Cause when the coke price was up - it was nuthin to us
We got blocks full of heroin, weed and dust
Seen bullets pop off cause of greed and lust
And when the big dogs die, who gon feed the pups?
My niggas is here, so you know the circle is tight
I circle the block, and cut off the lights-pray to Christ
And when the cops come, we don't care, we got shotguns
Them niggas with the most ice, get the hot ones
Stay on your job, cuz nigga I'mma stay on mine
And if I lose my voice nigga, I'mma flow online
And by next year, we should have a thousand guns

Stop rolling with that bredda, you don't need him
He's a pussyhole, he's a chief leave him
Stop rolling with that bredda, you don't need him
He ain't got your back if it's beef leave him
Why you rolling with that pussyhole
Moving with that pussyhole
You know that he's a pussyhole
I showed you he's a pussyhole
He's always been a pussyhole
So he will always be a pussyhole
You're still with that pussyhole
You must be a pussyhole
[Verse 1]
As the bredda always chatting like he's strong
Sneaky fake fuck always running to his brother when it's on
Hardly backs the beef, last one swinging
First one running making them stories he's a chief
Bringing breddas to the ends, acting up
Putting on a show trying to talk funny to his friends
But his really not a don they know it
And you know it, something must be seriously wrong
Cause your parring, his mum calls you darling
But his brothers got you shotting
And we know where you're stopping
I heard you both have beef with an older breh
You took a spark and he just stood there
Now that boys a pussyhole say it ain't true
It started because of him and ended with you
And it's that kind of shit that's gonna continue
But I guess it don't matter if that's what you're into

[Chorus]
Stop rolling with that bredda, you don't need him
He's a pussyhole, he's a chief leave him
Stop rolling with that bredda, you don't need him
He ain't got your back if it's beef leave him
Why you rolling with that pussyhole
Moving with that pussyhole
You know that he's a pussyhole
I showed you he's a pussyhole
He's always been a pussyhole
So he will always be a pussyhole
You're still with that pussyhole
You must be a pussyhole
[Verse 2]
The Sun's the biggest star in the sky
But naturally its gotta make room for the moon every night
Every friend got his time limit
Even relationships
Everything's sunny when the friendships tight
A friend in need is a friend indeed
But a friend with no money and no weed
Could flip the script at a ridiculous speed
And make a best friend and ex friend for the P
A couple years ago in my road youth days
I was into pirate radio I guess it was a phase
There was this one particular MC man
He was an older in my ends and I thought he was the dan
So I started rolling with him kind of like a little brother
My cousin used to say he was a pussy undercover
I didn't think that it was nothing more than jealousy
But I wish I woulda listened every time he told me

[Chorus]
Stop rolling with that bredda, you don't need him
He's a pussyhole, he's a chief leave him
Stop rolling with that bredda, you don't need him
He ain't got your back if it's beef leave him
Why you rolling with that pussyhole
Moving with that pussyhole
You know that he's a pussyhole
I showed you he's a pussyhole
He's always been a pussyhole
So he will always be a pussyhole
You're still with that pussyhole
You must be a pussyhole
Pussyhole, Pussyhole
Pussyhole, Pussyhole
[Verse 3]
Stay away from those pussyholes, you can have it all
Live endlessly tremendous forever ball
Stand up for something or for anything you'll fall
But definitely know when not to lose your cool
Cause it ain't what you show, it's what your concealing
Put a smile on the deepest negative feeling
Stand tall even when their hating and their scheming
Then watch your money rise right to the ceiling
Stand tall even when their hating and their scheming
Yea watch your money rise right to the ceiling

[Chorus]
Stop rolling with that bredda, you don't need him
He's a pussyhole, he's a chief leave him
Stop rolling with that bredda, you don't need him
He ain't got your back if it's beef leave him
Why you rolling with that pussyhole
Moving with that pussyhole
You know that he's a pussyhole
I showed you he's a pussyhole
He's always been a pussyhole
So he will always be a pussyhole
You're still with that pussyhole
You must be a pussyhole"

[Verse 1: Ad-Rock, MCA, (Mike D)]
Now here's a little story I've got to tell
About three bad brothers you know so well
It started way back in history
With Ad-Rock, MCA, (and me) Mike D
Been had a little horsey named Paul Revere
Just me and my horsey and a quart of beer
Riding across the land, kicking up sand
Sheriff's posse's on my tail 'cause I'm in demand
One lonely Beastie I be
All by myself without nobody
The sun is beating down on my baseball hat
The air is getting hot, the beer is getting flat
Looking for a girl, I ran into a guy
His name was MCA, I said, ""Howdy,"" he said, ""Hi""

[Verse 2: Ad-Rock, MCA]
He told a little story that sounded well-rehearsed
Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst
The brew was in my hand, and he was on my tip
His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry, he asked me for a sip
He said, ""Can I get some?"" – I said, ""You can't get none!""
Had a chance to run, pulled out his shotgun
Quick on the draw, I thought I'd be dead
He put the gun to my head, and this is what he said:
""Now my name is MCA, I've got a license to kill (yeah)
I think you know what time it is, it's time to get ill (yeah)
Now what do we have here, an outlaw and his beer? (uh huh)
I run this land, you understand? I've made myself clear?""
We stepped into the wind, he had a gun, I had a grin
You think this story's over, but it's ready to begin
[Verse 3: Ad-Rock, MCA, (Mike D)]
Now I got the gun, you got the brew
You got two choices of what you can do
It's not a tough decision, as you can see
I can blow you away or you can ride with me
I said, ""I'll ride with you if you can get me to the border
The sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter.""
I did it like this, I did it like that
I did it with a wiffleball bat
So I'm on the run, the cop got my gun
And right about now it's time to have some fun
The King Ad-Rock, that is my name
And I know the fly spot where they got the champagne
We rode for 6 hours, then we hit the spot
The beat was a-bumping, and the girlies was hot
This dude was staring like he knows who we are
We took the empty spot next to him at the bar
MCA said, ""Yippie Yo, you know this kid?""
I said I didn't, but I know he did
The kid said, (""Get ready, 'cause this ain't funny
My name's Mike D, and I'm about to get money""
Pulled out the jammy,  I aimed it at the sky)
He yelled (""Stick 'em up!"") and let two fly
Hands went up, and people hit the floor
He wasted two kids that ran for the door
(""I'm Mike D, and I get respect
Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect"")
MCA was with it, and he's my ace
So I grabbed the piano player, and I punched him in the face
Piano player's out, the music stopped
His boy had beef, and he got dropped
Mike D grabbed the money (MCA snatched the gold)
I grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold"

Cause believe it or not, we be the ones settin the traps
Listen to y'all shit, then listen to our shit
Ain't nuttin y'all faggots could do but gossip
That's the reason now y'all niggas ain't got shit
Cause everytime I turn around y'all on the LOX dick
Niggas thats narrow, I just smack em wit the barrel
Give it to em at the light, like Caine's cousin Harold

[Chorus]
The Ruff Ryders! (What?) The Ruff Ryders

The Ruff Ryders! (What?) The Ruff Ryders
The Ruff Ryders! (What?) The Ruff Ryders

[Verse 3: Styles P]
Fuck you and your son, y'all lower than scum
Show me the money, I'll show you a gun, motherfucker
S-P will spin the corner while you parle' with dun
I clap you, I clap him, and thats rule number one
Suckin my dick, and I dont give a fuck what you spit
Who you are, where you from, and who the fuck you could get
Cause I sell records, plus I got a jail record
Y'all niggas ain't sayin shit until y'all bare weapons
And even when you dead, you can still fuckin get it
A nigga that'll smack ya, fuck around and clap ya
Styles P., your favorite rapper's favorite rapper
[Verse 4: Eve]
Ain't no surprise niggas, only fuck wit recognized niggas
Babygirl want the world, gave ya pies niggas
No ties, take em in all shapes and size niggas
No lie, prefer them ready do or die niggas
What? What you want? cutey starin at me like
""Damn, where you from?"" You be comin at me like
""Can I get some?"" Lick your lips for this brown sugar
Suck me like a thumb, if you want, til I come, uh

[Verse 5: Drag-On]
I be the D-R, A-G, dash O-N, slash often
Comma, burnin niggas often
They call me Drag-On, I'm hot scorchin
Keep the block roastin
Light a dutch wit the flames coma-toastin'
In my eyes you could see what summer's holdin
Realizin, every guy I'll fry or dead ride
I burn to a degree of 130, and my gun dirty
Cause it got one buried, so you better run, hurry
Or catch one early
You wrong, tryin to touch me, what type of shit you on?
You better throw your boots on and your unflammable suits on
Cause I'm comin through in a Yukon
Black tinted wit gats in it
Catch you while you smokin, send your casket, throw the sack in it
But only half of it, cause y'all are half-ass duke
And we are one whole, and y'all niggas is one slash two
My gun blast you, tryna out the flames, what're they, firemen?
You'll catch a hell of a backdraft
Cause my fire retire men (aight then)
[Verse 6: DMX]
Its my, survival instinct that keeps my head above the water
Everyday I show another how I love a slaughter
Plug your daughter, full of more holes than sponges
Taxin businessmen for stocks over lunches
With these, I shoot the breeze, and extort
Enough ki's from the Cuban, to build a fuckin fort
Caught up in somethin that I can't control
Tryna get a hold of a bankroll that's swoll
Catchin' bodies like a cold, and I stay sick so face it
Make me chase it, I take your life and erase it
Waste it, in the fuckin streets cause it ain't worth shit
The undertaker take your ass under the earth quick, I
Love money, but the scramblin's hot
So I snatch up my man and hit the gamblin spot
Twenty grand has got, one nigga shot, one nigga less
What used to be his chest is now a mess under his fucking vest"

I'm a faggot, I'm a retard

I got three friends and a whack-ass ride
You can judge by the cover cause it's shitty on the inside
No girls want to fuck me, trust me
I don't give a fuck, don't adjust me
Just, please, shut your face hole for just one second
""Fuck you, faggot. You're so fucking dumb!""
Dumb? I'm the dumb one?
Calm down, Bo. Just count to ten

Sorry, bro, did I interrupt the circle of jerks all circle-jerking?
I need saving? Fuck no

Ah, shit I'm bitchin', listen

So much pain,SupamanChris,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Verse 1: (Truth)

God!!!..tell me what you doing to me
All I ever did is pray
Its like nothings getting threw to you
Is there something I needed to do
Or something you wanted me to do
Tell me now before I leave this world
Cuz im just a victum too
I dont know what too do
I feel blinded in this world
Now I know how stevey wonder feels
Fuck it hes a victim too
Im tired of all this nightmares of mine
Get them out my fucking head
Im tired of seeing dead bodys laying on the ally way
Man if I only knew the way to go
Or the way to be I might be a better man
If god showed me some compassion too
Ask god about me he will tell you im a lost soul
If god can't help me then pray for my lost soul
Verse 2: (Supaman Chris)

This is what life did to me
18 years old but it feels like life is finishing
Nothing's what they did for me
Losing all my energy
Lost inside a desert I have nothing to replenish me
Nothing feel's as dead as he
No one seems to care or see
I'm just another nigga tryna make it to his fantasies
I just as if no gravity
This planet cannot handle me
So they cage me in, like an animal that's on a leash
It rains when I cry, or I cry when it rains
It feels like the only time this world feels my pain
It drives me insane how every day is the same
It feels like im the center, but without all the fame
Cause they all pay attention
But im no one to mention
This of how it feels to always be alone
All the tension
Nothings working for me but I pay it off like a pension
Like if I was late to life now I got a long life dention
It's hard for you to fathom
All these things but just imagine
Cause while you think im living through it all
No sarcasm
And if you don't believe me
Theres a god go and ask him
Tell him god whats wrong with chris?
He say's I don't understand him"
Fake MCs,Ghetts,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
G-G-G-G-H ain't one of these fake MC's, my bars are the truth
I got no PhD but I'mma be away eventually, I'm a star in the booth
Go round town asking the youth who's doing this ting
It's G-H-E double T and O, my mind works, how it's so diverse
Why work when the fiends wanna buy work? (x2)

[Verse 1]
I can see trouble ahead
I live life in a tunnel of death
It's amazing I'm alive still
Ain't aiming a 9 mill
Paving for a nice meal
I been patient and temptation is too much now
How can a man resist luxury?
I wanna know where the paper's at
But I'll be pissed if it's custody
If a couple of Feds come for me
Then it's back door stylie
But the back door might be covered already
And if so then escape's impossible
But I keep optimistic I ain't letting them stop my business
Let them in, ""There's nothing illegal here
I ain't got nothing to hide, it's so obvious
Officer look, that's all in my past
I'mma sign autographs, of course I'm a star
Performing's an art!""
At least two times a day
I come real close to losing my freedom
Taking risks on a daily basis
All I wanna do is make tunes and release them
At least two times a day
I come real close to losing the plot
Taking risks on a daily basis
All I wanna do is put tunes in the shop

[Hook]
G-H ain't one of these fake MC's, my bars are the truth
I got no PhD but I'mma be away eventually, I'm a star in the booth
Go round town asking the youth who's doing this ting
It's G-H-E double T and O, my mind works, how it's so diverse
Why work when the fiends wanna by work?
I really can't stand you fake MC's
I take laptops when I chase MC's
I break MC's over age MC's
I guess you could say that I hate MC's
I really can't stand you fake MC's
I take laptops when I chase MC's
I break MC's over age MC's
I guess you could say that I hate MC's

[Verse 2]
Uh, it's times like this I don't wanna be sober
It's gotta be Jack D's gotta be cola
Niggas wanna jack me, 'cos I stack Ps like a property owner
There ain't no stopping me vulture
You won't eat 'til I'm dead
As long as I'm alive I've gotta be a soldier
Ok, you're probably older
But I know you're soft like quality sofas
You know my policy, no guy's robbing me
I'm serious like I don't like comedy
Police are so devious
They wanna nick a nigga now for an '05 robbery
Don't try follow me, I don't like solitary
I hate authority, I'm a law breaker
All I'll be about is more paper
So don't ask for a favour, Show me a bader
I'll make his homie a traitor, make his homie a stranger
Or so his throat don't see a razor
Everybody knows I'm an uncaged animal
Like everybody knows zoning's a major
I ain't a parolee who won't be a danger
I'm fearless like Steve from Australia
Crocodiles get tamed with the flamer
At least two times a day
I come real close to shooting a nigga
Taking a risk is bait in the bits
But that won't stop what I'll do for the figures
At least two times a day
I come real close to shooting a foe
Taking risks is bait in the bits
But that won't stop what I'll do for the dough

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Different day same regime
22 now, and I feel like there's nothing I ain't seen
Wha-gwarn for the rave scene?
It's like the under 18's are deathtraps
I wouldn't be shocked to find guns in a play scheme
To tell the truth I expect that
Some have got bodies on their guns
And still ain't purchased a fresh strap
But on the other hand, some remain clean
Too prang to bang, too dumb to make cream
You ain't had one war
What you got a gun for?
I've done more than you will in a lifetime
It's real when I write rhymes
I ain't gotta force it out
I got a nigga who bought an ounce
A year later bought a house
And survived all sorts of droughts
I'm the talk of the town
And I can see niggas walking around
Sporting a frown
I'm sporting a crown
It was meant to be it fits perfect
I spit sick verses, time on my hands
That's what a little bird did
I never snitched like Curtis
Came out back to the bits
And jumped on the musical wagon
In the hood that's the usual fashion
For big time rappers
At least two times a day
I come real close to losing my drive
Making hits ain't making me rich
But that won't stop what I do the mic
At least two times a day
I come real close to losing my love
Making hits ain't making me rich
But that won't stop what I'll do the dubs

Need results from my actions, mistakes I'll exonerate
I'm Martin King staring at a picture of Obama's face
Talking funds, niggas ain't never seen stock
I don't need the key to the game, I pick a mean lock

[Chorus: Eminem]
Must be outta your mind
You think you fucking with us
Suck on these nuts, bitch, hang it up
This game is over
[Verse 5: Crooked I]
Take off, you invited inside of the mind of
A psychotic rhymer, I'm kind of a (Dahmer)
I'm grinding up rappers are lining up jackers, I'm climbing up ladders
I buy enough clappers to retire you factors, fire at drama
You liars and actors, I'm the genuine article
But read me wrong, get my gun and split you to particles
(The gold hand) Tell me when and I'm there
Not only heir to the throne, but my chair is suspended in air
Stay fly like unlimited fare
You got us pegged wrong, my circle don't fit in with squares
I smell shit and piss, know where it's coming from
You stepped on number two just to be number one
Now I'm a step on you, bring it to your yard
Bogart for arts, we go hard
You frauds just blow hard like broads, I coast guard the West
I'm Mozart, I compose dark shit with no heart

[Verse 6: Yelawolf]
I got Jim Beam in the liver, getting head like clean clippers
With haters on my dick like a jeans zipper
When I throw up 16's like I drink liquor
You think you seen sick? Well, bitch, you ain't seen sicker
Than a cracker that will hop around in a hospital gown
Popping the trunk, my pump will stay cocking the round
I shit logs and I piss river brown
Cause I drink creek water and spit the river Nile
And that's as close as I get to a pyramid
Shit, they think I'm Illuminati, so fucking ignorant
Sick with a grin, here with this pen, so innocent
But when you win, they say you a sin, but in the end
They jump on the bandwagon and dance to the band playing
Skinny-ass pants sagging, it's only yourself you playing
Call me a clown, but you love what the clown's sanging
I'm a freak shows at the county carnival, then you paying
Bitch, I'm on a trapeze with no legs in the dark
Yelling ""Go Shady!"" Driving slower than an old lady
In an old '89, no piece if you pay me
Give me peace sign on my grill, no Mercedes
I'm getting paid for these shows that I throw lately
Same shows a year ago would have broken most of you crazies
They call me crazy cause I made it
Bitch, you crazy cause you quit, look at my clique lately
You ain't fucking with Budden, you ain't got no choice with Royce
You don't want to see the Crooked I, well, listen to Ortiz voice
That dirt road hit the 8 Mile, the point oh boys
And if Marshall want me to clap, then, homie, I deploy game over

[Outro: Eminem & Yelawolf]
Yo, I don't think they heard you, tell 'em again
Game over!"

Chali two (Naty)
In the building brick laying
I'm saying that we could rent yo dentals
With influential credentials over
Instrumentals with a pencil
The essentials from peg your mentals
My regu-tensil rhymes sharper than in-suit knives
That lyrically living suspenseful lives
Fabricating stories rappers that vent through lies
We centralize minds with every intent to strive
And synchronize the times and every event to shine
The tri has them twitching like back spasms
(Spitting the while)
Switching it back
They can't fathom the two from mid-west dissent
Fresh defend
Doing our best to represent the testament
I see more green when the hoods' high strung
And mostly for the bullshit that could die young
So for your brain keep it simple on the plain
This ain't a-

[Verse 2: Supernatural]
You, best prepare cause we taking an dare
Yo cats are playing games but you ain't playing fair
I sit and watch the videos, I rest in my lair
Most of them is thug fillers, killers, Willies, and players
Real rhyme sayers, they just a thing of the past
You might as well lay down with that snake in the grass
Walking round like a clown, with a tear in your mass
Somebody lied to you, yo that nigga is gas
Ya'll brothers is using yo the same cookie cutters
With the same bullshit flows that copy one another
We just two rhyme vets thats giving you bomb threats
If you think that is hussle we ain't flex the arms yet
Ya'll combar cats with the combar raps
You need to get your paws up and run some laps
And since you acting like torn I'mma give you two snaps
Don't forget my name, it's Mister Supernat

[Verse 3: Chali 2na and Supernatual]

I'm saying, name your price in the game of life
For real, minus the referees and umpires
The tightest the recipes would we spit gunfire
At vampires with fake hand shakes and fake smiles
Stake the snake
Killing these snakes with great styles
Things are no longer free, now they pay styles
Meanwhile, ya'll cats killing the game
I can really tell the difference cause they rhyming the same
Cats with funny hats and colorful names
Your lyrics is lame, right now I'm cracking the frame
Attacking the names
Stackin them at the back at the plane
Cause we uncloak the vibe and remote revivals
Musical notes to ride to promote survivals
Slide through
But challenges never hold up fair
When I spoke they broke down like fold-up chair
And if the cap fits, wear it, cause we don't care

Go'n' gimme some, a lil' more beat
Call your friends around, then call the police
I'm ridin' with my flow, it take up four seats
So I'm gon' ghost-ride, but with no sheets
One man by myself, even then I'm four deep
Like hotel swimming pools, that's four feet
These niggas like the rooms, so suite
Priceline, so cheap
I'm the cell phone, they the room keys
I'm some shelltoes, they some shoestrings
I turn 'em off, I take 'em out
I'm Reverend Run, with the laces out
Adidas, so adios
All day, I dream, like I'm comatose
That's your ship sinking, and I'm so afloat
I'm T-Pain, I'm on a boat
Not the slave one, DiCaprio's either
Hear the waves come, they started in the bleachers
So I'm swag surfing, the pool's getting deeper
You still sweet, though, here come them roomkeepers
OK, I'll be the strings, you be the shoes

Hell yeah, I'm tryna tell y'all
At this rate, niggas gon' lose
Can't search for water or grow your own food
Tell me what's gon' happen when them stores close
And ain't gon open up no more
Yeah, that's the realest shit
You gon' feel that, hunger's your enemy
But you can't kill that
Nigga, wake up, don't join the army
Kill your own peoples, but fear Illuminatis
And they ain't even real, or are they?
But you ain't even know, because you par-tay—
Too fucking much, if you start to doubt
They already in your mind, and coming out yo mouth
It's not a trick, nigga, it's a trap
Survival of the fit is what they aiming at
And niggas ain't fit, fat as hell
Fat in mind; body fat, as well
Who use most the drugs? Americans
What's in Afghanistan? Heroin
You think that's by mistake? They can't stop that
Don't think you safe, though, because you not Black
Greed is colorblind, so I'm colorblind
They gon' fuck with yours soon as they done with mine
They say I try too hard, verses overwhelm
I learned most of this from niggas sitting in jail
Where you think I'm from? I'm from the streets, nigga
Triple OGs told me to teach, nigga
And that ain't made up, nope, that's a fact
They say that gangsta shit is the shit I rap
Look who I attract, look at my inner circle
Bunch of street niggas and a couple Urkels
Look at my fanbase, oh, yes
Fuck what Pro say, look at this protest
Where they do that at? Who they do that for?
Must mean I'm doin' bad, and things is movin' slow
We talkin' revolution on public radio
Then catch me down in Houston, sitting on them 84s

As soon as I enter the crib, I'm sensin' a bad vibe
No welcome home kisses even though it's been a while
And you tryna play it off but I can see clear through the mirror
I'm lookin' straight at your face boo and it's missin' a smile
'Cause your girlfriends say they spotted me, exchangin' some kisses
With some bitches, up in my business while exchangin' some digits
But you know that these chickens vindictive, they trippin' any chance they get
And I know everythin' we've been buildin' breaks if it gets through your head
We go from trust issues to what I do after shows
I always got an excuse to not come home
And you always got an excuse to look through my phone
And hate on every person that I meet on the road
She says, ""Things are not the same in so many ways""
I've been rollin' with some snakes since my trendy days
And she never let it phase but that's what she says
""That they offend me with envy, right through the Fendi shades""

We fallin' in and out of love like Alicia Keys
But I, thought you grasped the difference between real and fake
Granted I, understand the fact that I'm not in your Marc Jacobs
I, know the lies and rumors are factors behind break-ups
Don't let them tears run down your cheeks and ruin your make-up
On the real, for real? (For real) I just wanna sit and chill with ya
Listen to build with ya, gettin' to know what's the deal with ya
But you miss the picture baby 'cause you're tellin' me you're hurt
Word? I hurt you so you hurt me back so I can feel with ya

Slipping' and falling'
Cause my girl's tripping and calling, calling on a hit
It all started with a kiss
But a sip of that Bacardi with the crisp
Had me up on Mami, looking sick
This is 3-way love, this thing is triangular
Still I ain't figured out how I'm gonna explain to her
I used to tell her she was hot as any girl
But you rock a fellas world, so I'm thinking about banging ya
Cause if she knew how I still got it bad with you
Would I end up on a milk carton ad with you?
Over my head now, watching my step
I'm trying not to fall, but I still ain't got it yet
So I guess...

I can't lie, I like the affection
I love when we fight, and I like the attention
We go head to head, just like an election
Now you make me feel good, yeah it's quite the obsession
I know you had a man when we first met
But I got some words that you ain't heard yet
Me and her, yes, we kinda got a thing
It's been 3 years, yeah we kinda got a flame
I take one out to dinner, the other one to lunch
I can't figure out just which one I want
But if my girl knew, the things that we do
The kissing, the touching, between me and you
I'm so caught up, but I can't stop now
Cause both you and her have my love locked down
I will, but not now, when they say because
I'm too much in love with this 3-way love

Even if the house was ten grand
And there was no pool
Would I still be without my swim fan?
The ceiling could be higher
She making requests
Don't know if she feeling me or she be feelin what I buy her
And purses are light now
She use 'em all the time
So she smilin to the the point that it hurt when she bite down
And she simply a new model
Stay spendin dollars
But she got less sense than a empty perfume bottle
At times she a solid chick
And I'm a sucka for the cuties
So she always lookin good when my wallet's thick
Chillin on the linen, she all up in the closet so much
Got a hunch thats shes feelin other women
Want the diamonds on the face in the center

Apply for a business loan and I'll bet you that they'll sign

Poppin as if its your only option

Other than jail time

Or pasha and sasha, esther baxter
Melyssa ford, or katy or anyone after
I just give my opinion for laughter
Or maybe to think on
So next time you out at the club
And a brother offers the whole table something to drink on
You just take in fact he got a stack with a mink on
Now he got you doing everything that you think wrong
Look, you tell your parents that its cash at an easy pace
Ya dad screaming take ya ass outta jeezy face
And as ya man I won't back down first
But they got you doing soft-core background work
That messed up like an officer that pulls you over
And he ask questions later and pat down first
But you ain't thandie newton, and this ain't crash here
The resolutions passed baby, this ain't last year
Look, I got a message, I'll say it, I got some beats still
Regina Hall and Garcelle and Elise Neal

Role models that you can watch on the big screen

And loves the drug and this for the lovers
Uh, one time for the boys in the streets with it
But me and shorty we be hustling in the sheets with it
She selling up, buy it and only when the drugs are done I feel like dying
She dope she bad

[Bridge: Lloyd]
You're my pusha
Girl you got the world
But I wanna try
Don't wanna break the rules but I get high off your supply
Don't make me wait

Your love is the fix I wanna taste

[Hook: Lloyd]
Her love is like cocaine cocaine
I'm flying on a private plane
And I'm so high(so high, so high, I sail in the sky)
Cobain, Cobain

Keep coming back for more
Never took a trip like this before

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Juelz Santana:]
A, she supplies my unitive, if I wanna move slow
She supplies that need
If I want to go fast she provides my speed
Ha body smoking like when I light my trees
And everybody know how much I like my trees
She got me higher than the weed spot
Somebody call Dr. Dre I need detox
Man, she so dope she make my veins shiver
If I got a headache then she my pain killa
One sniff of her have my nose wide open
One hit of her have my whole mind frozen
A female eat pill wow I'm rolling

[Verse 1: Jackie Chain]
Poppin bottles, keep 'em pouring, how we rolling? VIP
It's Jackie Chain (Who the man?) Everybody know it's me
I keep myself surrounded by some dime pieces every night
Tall and short, th-thick and skinny, Black and white, e-every type
K-Keep 'em coming, ain't no secret, if she with it, she can get it
But just wait, give me a minute
'C-'Cause right now, the room is spinning
Pouring juice to kick it in, rolling blunts and kicking it
Music bumping—ain't it something how it get the [?] ?
Feel the bass—it's beating hard against her body, make her horny
Guess she heard I keep them Skittles
That's why she be all up on me
Five blunts of purp, and I still ain't high, roll up
Ten-pack of pills, halfway gone, I'm about to (Throw up)
Throwing up, its all good–that just kick my buzz in
On the couch, loving the way these girls back-rubbing
Blowing on them Sweets, and your boy about to peak
I've been rollin, rollin, rollin, I ain't slept in weeks

[Verse 2 Kid Cudi]
Word... I can't feel the left side of my face
Stressful thoughts have been replaced with Henny and coke and Jager, man
Jackie told me pump my brakes, I told him, ""Pass me something to pop""
Told me not to smoke my weed, I— I should listen, I can't stop
Grabbing models by the arm, I tell 'em to fuck with Moonman
They don't even trip on my aggression, they just slowly take my hand
Then they open up and say, ""Do you want to play with me?""
I-I-I-I say, ""Baby I'm all about it, my hotel is down the street""
This is kind of how it is when you living young and fast
Management is playing loud, bitches dancing, shaking ass
Zuli try and pass the blunt, I told him that I'ma have to pass
Cause if I decide to smoke it, I— I will float to leaner land
But, my man, is that so bad? Different from reality
I try and tell my nigga, man, whiskey, hope my mom ain't mad at me
My lifestyle is a wild life with style, and my brain on drugs
I won't stop until I'm numb, telling myself the night is young

Whole club going off, hitting the middle, showing off
Louie V's and Pumas got me rolling like a bowling ball
I just wanna sneak away, take you to another place
We could have some fun if you just come with me, let's run away
We can leave this shit behind, ain't got nothing else but time
Pop a Superman, and watch how quick you stimulate your mind
Take you to that other level, way beyond that Cloud 9
Go back to my crib, and just relax and have some downtime
Make you ball all night long, try to put it through your back
Say you coming down, well, Mama, eat one of these, triple-stack
Rolling leads to freakyness—let's go have some freaky sex
Bring some of your friends, and we can turn this to a freaky-fest
I just wanna run away, take you where you wanna be
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a thing if you just come with me
Blowing on them Sweets, and your boy about to peak
I been rollin, rollin, rollin, I ain't slept in weeks

Hustle,Laws,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Mason Caine]
They wanna knock my hustle, that’s my million dollar baby
I use my mental muscle like I’m Russell in the 80’s
You can bet I’m crazy, I’m a savage from my check
I knew bitch got her ex-nigga tatted on her neck
But she rata-tat, tat ‘em till they whack
She told me fuck a hater, middle finger to the death, to the left
Call me money makin' Mitch and my money gettin' rich
I put them dummies in your tummy if you runnin' with a snitch
They wanna knock my Nino, De Niro, Pachino
Take down what I’ve built and blow up my casinos
I’m knocking where the talcum be, X, I’m like Malcolm be
Higher than a balcony with a jump off
Finna jump off and touch a falcon wing
You hustle small, you’re at a amidst
My hustle tall, Bill Russell and I’m very adamant
Hustle in, hustle out, duffles in, duffles out
Blood stains in the back seat, gotta buff ‘em out

[Hook]
Gotta get it, get it till it’s all gone
Believe me when I say that it’s on, you can’t knock the hustle
You get it in, I’m the one you call on
Movin' through the night till it’s done, you can’t knock the hustle
Every day and night, it’s hustle, only way to life is hustle
Say what you want about me but you can’t knock the hustle
Every day and night, it’s hustle, only way to life is hustle
Say what you want about me but you can’t knock the hustle
[Verse 2: Laws]
Used to think that I could get my deal and let my dollars circulate
Sort of rise and fall, then I realized that it ain’t worth the hate
Now I’m treating hate like the raven, never more
I work my fingers to the bone, Skeletor
I pick the mic up and settle scores and my fans like the tee birds
They sayin' tell me more, tell me more
As soon I enter the door, I say you’ll never get me on tour
Listen, I’m getting five bill
Real recognize real like I feel like I been here before
I’m a worker but call me the boss, gully of course
If you are claimin', don’t tuck in your bling
We’ll recycle the chain, now hustle the cross
Toughen up dog, another hit single, you buy one again
This is a stick up dedicated to all the broke rappers
Still settin' fire to pens, tryin' to win
If you pop a city, we’ll let you rebuild and we riot again
Don’t try to compete, just admire the man
We kinda wake up right at 9 A.M
Then hustle our products till 9 P.M
And write the whole night about our obvious struggle
It’s not a secret y’all got in some trouble
Lettin' the youngin this high come in and start knockin' the hustle

[Hook]
Gotta get it, get it till it’s all gone
Believe me when I say that it’s on, you can’t knock the hustle
You get it in, I’m the one you call on
Movin' through the night till it’s done, you can’t knock the hustle
Every day and night, it’s hustle, only way to life is hustle
Say what you want about me but you can’t knock the hustle
Every day and night, it’s hustle, only way to life is hustle
Say what you want about me but you can’t knock the hustle"

Yo, what you know about goin' out
Head west, red Lex, TV's all up in the headrest
Try and live it up, ride true, a bigger truck
Piece all glittered up, stick up kid, nigga what?
Jig with a cut sip Cris? Spit it up (Come on)
Ho's ride, get your nut 'till I can't get it up
I'm a big man, give this man room
I done hit everything, from Cancun to Grant's tomb
Why you standin' on the wall? Hand on your balls
Lighting up drugs always fightin' in the club
I'm the reason they made the dress code
They figure I wouldn't wild when I'm in my fresh clothes (Come on)
Dress as I suppose, from my neck to my toes
Neck full of gold, baguettes in my Rolls
Wreck shows, collect those, extra O's
Buy the E, get a key, to the Lex to hold
East, West, every state, come on, bury the hate
Millions, the only thing we in a hurry to make
Whether friend or ex-friend in a Lex or a Benz

With a Z3, chrome BB's, they wanna be me
Nigga's talkin' shit they ought to quit
I'm fortunate they don't see a fourth what I get
And those be the same ones walkin' while I whip
Just started seeing cars because they auctioned it
So while you daydream, my Mercedes gleam
And I deal with ho's that pose in Maybelline
One time you had it all, I ain't mad at y'all
Now give me the catalog
I'll show you how daddy ball (That's right)

Never been arrested for nothin' domestic

With a jet ski attached to a SE, smoke my Nestle
No mad rap-ASCAP, where my check be?
Problem with y'all I say it directly (That's right)

Much better than you cat, shocked when I got the news that
This nigga ready for war, well where that fool at?
I bruise wack rap niggas severely punish them
Especially those that get fucked for they publishing, heh
Always gotta be the weakest nigga out the crew
I probably make more money off yo' album, than you
You see the respect I get every time I come through
Check your own videos, you'll always be number two
Niggas talking real greasy on them R&B records
Well I'm Platinum a million times nigga, check the credits
S. Carter, ghostwriter, and for the right price
I can even make YO' shit tighter
I roast niggas like ya, smoke niggas like ya
Take your little jewels and put the toast to niggas like ya
You know what the fuck we do and why we done it
How I bring it to niggas who, probably want it
Keep playing, you gone find me in your lobby blunted
And I don't even smoke nigga, ain't no joke

Making little tapes but keeping it secret
'Cause I kick that deep shit that divide your peeps shit

Press the button, all of sudden, Glock in the stash money
Beef with Jigga, watch yo' ass money

Never See Me Again,Kanye West,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
And it'll be a long time, before you ever see me again, me again

[Verse 1]
They want me, hold my head in shame
So I hold 'em on, holding hands in vain
Covers talkin' now the feds say I'm insane
A psych said ""I'm going fumble [down on the platter ?]""
And then his son told me ""Put down the drink dawg""
I got the rinks off, coming for the things off
I guess there's nothin' and I'm finna chop it's head off
I need a little something to knock the edge off
Aside from this song, life sucks
Stomping on someone, with my boots
And I'll put it off, if we modest
And every other god need a goddess
And every other star, couldn't guide us
It falls upon something that's inside us
So I'm not gonna stop for my riders
Tell me where my ride is
Tell me where my ride is, uh
[Hook]
And I don't like them, and they don't like that
They don't like that, and I don't want that
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again
Don't worry about me, worry 'bout you
Worry about something, don't worry what I do
Hatin' motherfuckers, it'll be a long time
Before you ever see me again, me again

[Verse 2]
See, I need some time to meditate
Naw, bitch I'm fly, I need time to levitate
And I don't sound try, tryna' hesitate
Fumbled down, very late nigga, you a featherweight
And I'm a heavyweight, and I'm very great
I put the everyday rocking in every state
Do not debate, you cannot cape
I must've on faith, getting knocked of faith
Guess it's my fate, guess it was written
I can sell a phone, guess I was different
That was somethin' back then, that was different
Now I'm spitting and everybody's just spitting
And what it sound like when everybody sound alike
What you sound like, bumpin' 'em on a round mic?
I don't even sound right, feelin' like I'm on the downright
And these niggas are secondary, like Pippen around Mike
Trippin' around sight, something on that down light
I'mma be downright, you niggas is downright biters
And I'ma set fires
And my shit downright fire, from the corner buyer
And I'm alone, eh
[Hook]
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout them
Don't worry 'bout you, and what you gonna do
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout you and maybe I do
Have a long day
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout you
I worry 'bout something not we can do
And it's on me
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, na-na-na-na
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Again, again
Before you ever see me again, me again, again, again
It'll be a long time before you ever see me again

Can you clap your hands, hands?
Clap your, clap your hand, hands?
Clap your, clap your hand, hands?
And I wanna do something, I wanna do something then
Can you clap your hand, hand?
Need you to clap your hand, hands
Need you to clap your hand, hands
Need you to clap your hand
Need you to clap your hand, hand
Need you to clap your hand
Need you to clap your hand, hand
Need you to clap your hand
[Verse 3]
So the song like a Section 8
So I pass that dick around like a collection plate
I can sell 'em on Sunday, with the fuss you made
I be stunting with the stunnas, and that's the best you make
So if everybody just stand now, and shit don't plan out
Throw your hands up, at least give them a handout
And with the sun shown, it's like the Jerome is
Mommas on the cellphone days, I'm homeless
Or feeling like Ike at the end of the movie
Wait, just need two more shows just to get to me
Or feeling like Eddie Kane, I still got it
And it's something but the problem is, you still not it
Or maybe if it's sicker, they say I'm ""That nigga""
Or maybe if I'm humble, it's not a cellphone finger
Or maybe damn, I could just blow my shit is thinner
Maybe I should stop being real, maybe I should get on Twitter
Maybe I should know somethin' different, I could reconsider
Got something nothing seri' till the cellphone liver
And I'mma drink until I can't stand and got no more liver
I can stand and deliver 'til they pump my liver
And I'mma spit it, like it get it, kinda self, but I'm fine
I'd rather live by what I live by, then die when I'm fine
I'm gonna stand by my self 'til my very last breath
Cause you know what? A coward dies a thousand deaths
And I'm proud [?]
And I could style on [?], hell with this
You can't style on me, nigga I'm out of your league
I'm liable to be a liability'
You plan to style on me, trying to style on me
Nigga, I'm liable to be a liability, and my ability
I can sound like [?]

[Hook 2]
Don't worry 'bout me, worry 'bout you
Worry about something, something will do
And motherfuckers, it'll be a long time
Before you ever see me again
So don't worry about me, I'll be fine
I'll be up some, going for mine
And it'll be a long time
'fore you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, worry 'bout you, worry 'bout you
'fore you ever see

[Verse 4]
Don't worry about what I been up to
Where the fuck I'm going? Nah, nigga fuck you
Who the fuck is going, I can something don't ask
Who the fucks asking? I'll put the summer on blast and
Who the fucks lasting?
And be the last standing
Caught up on the planning
Get a better tan and
I been feeling dandy
And who can run the planet? Pass them a Xanax
And an afternoon I annex
And all of the damage
Left on the platter
Who's soon after all, I guess it's a small world after all
Stunting on the sun, cause I have to ball
I run the world, cause it's a small world after all
And I'm never after y'all
I have to loss somethin' and I got it all
And you feeling like you got it all?
Humble some' [Non-Lyrical Vocals]
Nah nigga, not at all

[Hook]
Worry 'bout me, don't worry bout me, just worry bout you
And what'cha gon' do?
It'll be a long time, before you ever see me again

[Verse 5]
There's something on the all out, the call out, somethin' on the doormat
Last summer, last fight, and y'all had a fall out
I can sense nothing to something, what y'all 'bout?
Bumping nothing to something, and everything that y'all 'bout
Y'all had your ups and downs, I don't fuck around
Put everything on the something, then you go and fuck around
Bet you felt something, now you feel nothing now
Y'all feelings felt something, ya'll don't feel nothing now
Her tears dried up, from bumping expressionless
I was under exodus and learning what the lessons is
What the ebony of essences, the Genesis
I got the fetishes, something on the sedatives
One sip and then it'll have you look at innocence
I wish we just could take it back to the Book of Genesis
Before the hook is in is there any point of any of this?
But understand [?]
[?] put hands on you, then put his front side, and put hands on you
Just turn around say for really? I'm done motherfucker
I can state something if

[Hook]
They worry bout me, just worry bout you, I can [?] when I be good
And she said that
It'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, just worry 'bout you
And I'll be up now, what I've been up to
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout them
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Me again, me again
It'll be a long time before you ever see me again

Paper Chase,JAY-Z,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Foxy Brown & Jay-Z]
Uhh, uhh, uh-huh
Uhh, paper chase

Y'all motherfuckers know how it's going down
Gotta get that paper dog
That's right, uhh
Uh-huh uh, yeah, right, yeah
Paper chase y'all, paper chase WHAT? Uh

[Verse 1: Foxy Brown & Jay-Z]
Greyhound bitch, stay down bitch
‘Bout to set up shop with Jay, round this bitch
Half a brick of yay, 'bout to lay down this bitch
('Til November?) Nah, I'm here to like May down this bitch
And I'm thinking, I don't wanna have to spray down this bitch
Call my whole team, from around the way down this bitch
I'm trying to stay down this bitch, play down this bitch
Had a sound, so my nigga Jay drown the six
Roll the windows down and, wave round this bitch
But there's a couple things 'fore it's OK round this bitch
Gotta talk to the natives, let 'em know I'm here
For all to get the paydays, first I line up all the haters
I got jobs for ya, drop Saabs for ya
More arms than Green Bay's Brett Favre for ya
Money propositions hope that's not a prob' for ya
If so, Jigga be here, day after tomorrow for ya (that's right!)
[Chorus: Foxy Brown & Jay-Z]
Gotta get that paper dog
Gotta touch that, love that, paper dog, uhh!
Gotta get that paper dog
Gotta have that grab that paper dog!
Gotta get that paper dog
Gotta spend that, bend that, split that, get that
Gotta get that paper dog
When I needs that, G stack, tell me where the weed's at?

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I got my two guns, I came to scoop ones
A down ass bitch and she down to click
Got a nice little hooptie that I get around with
And my plan is, not to leave this town 'til I'm rich
Gotta find a nigga selling all them ounces and shit
Tell them get down with the clique or get found in a ditch
See I drop down and strip, I turn around and spit
Not to hit em, just to let 'em know the sound of shit
Return later that evening in the club with Fox
And I got the snub nose for those that love to box
I'm in search of them young niggas that hug the block
All day, 'til it's light gray outside
Shoot dice talking shit all day outside
And even when it's hot, they outside
Let em know how its gonna go, Bonnie and Clyde
And ayo, you would want me on your side

Gotta get that paper dog
Gotta touch that, love that, paper dog, uhh!

When I needs that, G stack, tell me where the weed's at?

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Yo, yeah, I got that stress and I got it the best
I ain't got it to give, but I got it to test
And if you wanna get down, all you gotta invest
Is your time, I gotta move this in a week or less
For the next couple of days I brought out all I possess
The Rolex, necklaces with the VVS
Between the driver and the passenger where the TV rest
For my top draft picks I cop the new GS
Now all the little soldiers wanna roll with my team
Cause I ain't sold em a dream, I just showed 'em the cream
Picked em up in the afternoons and told 'em some things
You know the regular shit you do when you molding them teens
Yo, never lay your head where you holding them things
Keep the family then your business, nothing goes in between
Never feared no man, put four in his bean
Drop your gun then, blow the scene, ya heard me?

Jenifa Taught Me Derwins Revenge,De La Soul,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Dove]
Access to her code
Lovestruck was my mode
Took a look, dropped my textbook
Jenifa... (oh!)
Breakfast, broke it fast
She was in my English class
Asked for notes, rocked my boat
Jenifa... (oh!)
Jenny, lost her favorite penny
So I gave her a dollar
She kissed me (and I hollered)
In a flash the school bell rang
Jenny grabbed on to my hand
Took me home and said, Trugoy just
Swing and swing and swing

[Verse 2: Pos]
The downstairs, where we met
I brought records, she cassettes
Lost the breaks, found her shape
Jenifa, oh Jeny
Transcripts showed more than flirt
""I love Daisies"" read her shirt
Grabbed my jeans, Jimmy screamed
Jenifa, oh Jeny
Marvelous, shaped like a vase
No one can live their life for Pos
Found a house, aroused my joust
Jenifa, oh Jeny
Her clothes, I did shuck
Just like Dan, I strictly stuck
To the punt, she cried, ""Kick it""
Posdnuos was in
Jenny
Only thought about Jimmy
But asked was I a virgin
Like some kid named Derwin?
She said, ""Let’s try it in the bathroom""
But ’dnuos is way above sinks
So to the kitchen she did Dan
And came back wrapped in Saran
Now waaaaaait a minute! Little Derwin got something to show us that Jenny could never do!
Listen...
[Plays 'Chopsticks']
Hey, look at little Derwin! Look at him go! Look at him go!
Awww, baby

[Verse 3: Dove]
Positions, muscles flexed
Dove was lost in a gon-a-hex
Passed her test, felt her teddy
Jenifa, oh Jeny
Notions soothed the mood
Dove was lost in De La heaven
Screwed plug two, did the do
Jenifa oh Jeny
Jeny
Teased my homeboy Granny
In fact she teased so many
She was known as a garden tool

[Verse 4: Pos]
No more I dispatched
Was it Jimmy had met his match
Or could it be the realization
All girls owned a Jeny
For normal health, I had fought
A valuable lesson she had taught
Don’t flaunt that the candy is good
Unless you came with plenty"
100 Miles and Runnin,N.W.A,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: FBI + MC Ren]
Catch those motherfuckers, catch them, catch them
Hey man, keep up keep up, this way, come on man, hurry up
You don't really think you're gonna get away, do you?
We haven't spotted them yet. But they're somewhere in the immediate vicinity

[Verse 1: MC Ren]
A 100 miles and runnin' -  MC Ren, I hold the gun and
You want me to kill a mutherfucker and it's done in
Since I'm stereotyped to kill and destruct -
Is one of the main reasons I don't give a fuck
Chances are usually not good
'Cause I'm frisked with my hands on a hot hood
And gettin' jacked by the you-know-who
When in a black and white the capacity is two
We're not alone, we're three more brothers, I mean street-brothers
Not wearing medallions, 'cause we're not stupid, mutherfuckers
They're out to take our heads for what we said in the past
Point blank, they can kiss my black ass
I didn't stutter when I said ""Fuck Tha Police""
'Cause it's hard for a nigga to get peace
Now it's broken and can't be fixed
'Cause police and little black niggas don't mix so
Now I'm creepin' through the fall
Runnin' like a G, we'll see, I might have slayed y'all
So for now pack the gun and
Hold it in the air 'cause MC Ren has a 100 miles of runnin'
[Interlude]
In today's news. Four fugitives are on the run
FBI sources tell us that the four are headed
100 miles to their home base, Compton

[Break: Dr. Dre + Eazy-E]
Lend me a mutherfuckin' ear
So I can tell you why

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Runnin' with my brothers, headed for the homebase
With a steady pace on the face that just reads race
The road ahead goes on and on
The shit is gettin' longer than the mutherfuckin' marathon
Runnin' on but never runnin' out
Stayin' wired and if I get tired, I can still try out
Hitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do
But nobody's pickin' up a Nigga Witta Attitude
Confused, yo but Dre's a nigga with nuthin' to lose
One of the few who's been accused and abused
Of the crime of poisonin' young minds
But you don't know shit til you been in my shoes
And Dre is back from the C-P-T
Droppin' some shit that's D-O-P-E
So fuck the P-O-L-I-C-E!
And any mutherfucker that disagrees
Stuck and runnin' hard, hauling ass
'Cause I been a nigga known for havin' a notorious past
My mind was slick - my temper was too quick
Now the FBI's all over my dick
[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
Got the stick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock
That's when the E jumped off the startin' block
A 100 miles from home and, yo, it's a long stretch
A little sprintin' mutherfucker that they won't catch
Yeah, back to Compton again
Yo, it's either that or the Federal pen
'Cause niggas been runnin' since beginning of time
Takin' a minute to tell you what's on my mutherfuckin' mind
Runnin' like I just don't care
Compton's 50 miles but, yo, I'mma get there
Archin' my back and on a straight route
Just like Carl Lewis I'm ballin' the fuck out
From city to city I'm a menace as I pass by
Rippin' up shit just so you can remember I'm
A straight up nigga that's done in, gunnin' and comin'
Straight at yo ass, a 100 miles and runnin'

[Interlude]
This one goes out to the four brothers from Compton
You're almost there, but the FBI has a little message for you:
Nowhere to run to, baby. Nowhere to hide
Good luck brothers

[Verse 4: MC Ren]
Runnin' like a nigga I hate to lose
Show me on the news but I hate to be abused
I know it was a set-up - So now I'm gonna get up
Even if the FBI wants me to shut up
But I've got 10 000 niggas strong
They got everybody singin' my ""Fuck Tha Police"" song
And while they treat my group like dirt
Their whole fuckin' family is wearin' our T-shirts
So I'mma run 'til I can't run no more
'Cause it's time for MC Ren to settle the score
I got a urge to kick down doors
At my grave like a slave even if the Ren calls
[Verse 5: Dr. Dre]
Clouds are dark and brothers are hidin'
Dick-tricklin' at the sunny mutherfucker's are ridin'
Started with five and, yo, one couldn't take it
So now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it
The number's even - now I'm leavin'
We're never gettin' took by a bitch with a weave in
Her and the troops are right behind me
But they're so fuckin' stupid, they'll never find me

[Verse 6: Eazy-E]
One more mile to go through the dark streets
Runnin' like a mutherfucker on my own two feet
But you know I never stumble or lag last
I'm almost home so I better haul ass
Tearin' up everything in sight
It's a little crazy mutherfucker dodging the searchlight
Now that chase, the shit, is done and
Four mutherfuckers goin' crazy with
A 100 miles of runnin'!

Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Surprise, niggas!"

Lu at the Louvre can't wait to see
8.50 I done paid my fee
Say ""what up Venus?"" then I take my leave
Hit collect and debate a spree
It's hard to sit it down like a maitre d'
Watch all the pretty little mates to be
They be tryna picture how I make my cheese
Little apricot on the crêpe I eat
Running late on my Casio face I see
Chefs in the kitchen tryna bake my steeze
But I keep it chilled, bout a 8 degrees

And end up coming quicker than an e-mail
Bye, ?, Au revoir, Arriba!
I'm going overseas so hide your daughters behind the doors
The minor tours and tore them down like minotaurs
Fine
With metaphors from when I thought clitorises were dinosaurs
(Sway) But I don't roll with a tech
But I will, if you go against my code of respect
If I don't hustle then my heart will stop
Back in Britain, rappers press up half the stock
I move and they ain't moving half the stock
And they can't fit in my shoes, so put a sock in it
Better yet a stocking 'fore I sock it to you
You're a laughing stock
America passed my ?, pass the buck
I'm about to blow so fast before I started
We've already passed the aftershock

And I still believe her, making it 200 times harder for me to handle it
I'm coming to America
But I ain't playing football with you folks
Cos the last time, the bloke picked the ball up
And ran with it
Pass me my passport and my cargo

""So what, he shot two cops
And raped a little girl while two dudes watched""

I'm gettin' thinner, I'm hungry
Is mom cookin' dinner?

Mom, come on, I'm not playin', it's cold!
Alright, sorry, I need a jacket

[Verse 2: Eminem]
My teacher's two-faced, went to lower all my school grades
Since last Tuesday I had a toothache from Kool-Aid
So Mom kicked me out, and all I had in my suitcase
Was one shoelace, a tube sock, and a tube of toothpaste
Sometimes it was cool cause I could go to Fred's
Crash there, fool around and just skip school
But other times I'd rather just be home
In my own room alone beat my shit and nobody would know
My little brother sucked on a bottle 'til he was six
So I'd hide it inside the couch and say
""I don't know where it is""
But as soon as Mom found it I would either be grounded
Or kicked out of the house a thousand weeks and still countin'
Even when I was underage
Mom was tellin' cops I was tryin' to run away
I told her ""Someday, bitch, you're gonna pay""
Please, Mom, please, Mom, please, I wanna stay

Who ain't carin', starin' through me
Like I'm transparent, made it clear
That I was just there to run her errands
Told her friends I was a son from her last marriage
Sent me up to the corner store with a little note
""Please, sell my step-son some cigarettes so I can smoke""
One time I tried to fake sick to get attention
Back-fired, Mom sent me to school with a vengeance
My life's the worst thing that could ever happen to me
I go to class and every teacher's always laughin' at me
And Mom says white rappers are laughed at
Not only that, she heard me upstairs
I can't rap, and I'm stupid
I'll never make it averaging a D+
I need to sit on my ass and sue people like she does
One time, I got food poison from a hot dog
Mom sued and got $2,000 from Ballpark
""Hey, Ma. You got a dollar?""
""I don't think so, now keep an eye on your brother
I'm goin' to bingo.""

Help you refrain from pain, and try to open your eyes
To show you more good then bad, give you what you should have
Make you feel great because I hate to see you sad
But you're fighting against me, It doesn't make sense
You could have it all, why settle for less
But you don't hear a word I say, won't even look my way
Now it's game over, I don't wanna play

[Bridge: Trofee]
You can't honestly tell me you're happy with him
I can make you happy, All you gotta do is let me in

Extortion,Mobb Deep,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Havoc]
Yeah
Time to let these niggas know, son
Niggas don't even wanna motherfuckin' understand
Know what I'm sayin'? Time to hit 'em with the third degree
H-A-V-O-C, namedrop a G
Yo

[Verse 1: Havoc]
Look into the eyes, true lies, your whole clique despise
Especially me, H-A-V-O-C
Don't want your chick 'cause she's burnin' third degree
Plus you snitchin', you ain't got no ties to me
I keep it strong, while you scream word is bond
Lyin' through your teeth, swearin' on your first born
Your word is weak, don’t hold no weight in this
Hit you up quick, strictly shit that I'm livin' in
You walk a line that's thin, you religious? Well, you sin
Fuckin' with the Mobb, Infamous to the end, Prodigy

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
I hold a nine Ruger, with an infa-spot disc
Red dot right at your face, so set sail or rock it
And kept drivin', pull off like the Indy 5G
In a four-time Ford truck with speed
Like the motion picture, this nigga gone with the wind
My crime work, ninja style shit was did
And got away with, escaped it, the jakes from tracin' (What?)
Anythin' that lead to the source, you know the boss
Of the Mobb killin', is like an unsolved mystery
Puzzlin', nobody knows, it's all history
Madness amongst me, I frequently have to get doubly
Never fails, it's always somethin'
No rest, daily, gotta rock my vest
I shoot at your best man, yeah, your MVP
He played the front line, got struck down immediately
I wave a Mobb Deep flag, you hear the sound as it slaps wind
Heavy load, my military hold ammunition
Far from animation, it's real live, you think not?
My crew, kings of New York who takin' your spot
I put the green light on your whole clique, Island shit
Runnin' through the whole house wildin', extortin' it
[Interlude]
Extortion (Give that up, yo)
Extortion (Give that up)

[Verse 3: Havoc]
Extortion is the key, I got the key for extortion
Spend your fortune, dead your shorty like abortion
Take precaution, Infamous laws enforced in
You married to the Mobb, can't take it? Then divorce it
'Cause I ain't got no time for them domestic disputes
If you scared, get a dog, don't got a clique? Then recruit
You're weak, troop, lost battalion in the mist
On your name, I shit, take it like a man, you little bitch

[Verse 4: Method Man]
I blaze your britches, P.L.O. extortion, you forcin'
The hand that rocks the cradle, caution before you enter
This Shaolin representer
Carry thirty-six deadly shits, you fuckin' with top contenders
Official to the bone gristle
It don't matter if you bust rhymes or bust pistols
Remember me? Burn a nigga to a third degree
Don't act familiar, motherfuckers, you ain't heard of me
Just peep the stee' and the rap how it's supposed to be
Tap the pockets, bag the goods like a grocery, we food shoppin'
On top of that we hip-hoppin', and don't stoppin'
Out-of-state drawers droppin', the panty raiders
Slide on ya like gators
Dug that stank bitch back out and then played her (Bitch)
But that ain't nothin'
Crossin' this dog walkin', native New Yorkin'
Shaolin' slang talkin', rap nigga
Mr. Freeze, crowd shiver, what?
Young, Black and don't give a fuck
If the next crew get the scissor
Extortion (Give me mine)
Extortion (Give me mine)
Give that up, kid, extortion
Bottom line, what the fuck you wanna do?
You eyin' me at the same time I'm eyin' you, punk
Wanna pop the most junk
Be the same motherfucker with the most lumps
Chew on that shit

Who was there? Girl I wasn't..
Wait a minute, calm down
I was at the club with who?
Get the fuck...man, you know what?

[Verse]
Girl I'm not about to sit up here and argue with you about who's to blame
Or call no names, real talk
See girl, only thing I'm trying to establish with you is not
Who's right or who's wrong, but what's right and what's wrong
Real talk
Just because your friend say she saw me at a club with some other bitches
Sitting in VIP smoking and drinking and kicking it, tell me girl
Did she say there were other guys there?
Did she say there were other guys there?
Were there other guys there?
Well, tell me this
How the fuck she knew I was with them other girls then
When the whole club packed?
Wait a minute, let me finish what I've got to say!
I've been with you five years and
You listening to your muh'fucking girlfriends
I don't know why you fuck with them all jealous no-man-having ass hoes anyway
Real talk
Always accusing me of some old bullshit
When I'm just trying to have a good time
Robert you did this, Kells I heard you did that
Don't you think I got enough bullshit on my mind
Real talk, hold hold up
Didn't I just give you money to go get your
Hair, toes and nails done the other day, hmm
Yeah your ass was smiling then
Real talk, oh
Gave who some damn money?
I ain't gave nobody no damn money girl
Is you tweakin'?
You see what your problem is
You're always running off at the mouth
Telling your girls your motherfucking business, when
They don't eat with us, they don't sleep with us, besides
What they eat don't make us shit
Real talk
You call my momma's house and what?
Girl my momma ain't gotta screen no calls for me
Real talk, and watch your mouth
Fuck me? Girl fuck you!
I don't give a fuck about what you're talking about
I'm sick of this bullshit, I'm coming home and getting my shit
And getting the fuck up out of Dodge
You ain't gotta worry about me no more
And the next time your ass get horny
Go fuck one of your funky ass friends
Hell yeah, you probably doing that shit anyway
You gon' burn what?

Let y'all niggas know right now
Word to mother, for real, for real

I put my lifetime in between the paper's lines
I'm the quiet storm nigga who fight rhyme
P, yeah, you heard of him, but I ain't concerned with them
Nigga, I pop more guns than you holdin' 'em
Make my route while the sun's out and scold your men
Unload ten in broad daylight, get right
Fuck your life! Hop on my '98 dirt bike
You try to stop mines from growin'
I'll make your blood stop flowin'
Take affirmative action, to any ass if he askin'
Now here come the MAC-10
You's a dick blower, tryin' to speak the Dunn language
What the drilly with that though? It ain't bangin'
You hooked on Mobb-phonics, Infamous-bonics
Lyin' to the Pop Dog like you got it
You ain't no wildin' out for the Knife-Fist thrower
Rusty shank holder, we live this shit

My chain hang down to my dick, my piece bang glass tables
Diamonds and guns before the fame, duke
A nigga like me hold TEC's, are you the same too?
Goin' through the emotions of gun holdin'
Long shotgun's down my pants leg, limpin'
Killa B, you still livin', even my pops too
He taught me how to shoot when I was seven
I used to bust shots crazy
I couldn't even look because the loud sound used to scare me
I love my pops for that, I love my niggaty Black
I'll take the life of anybody tryin' to change what's left
And through all of that, a nigga ain't scared of death
All y'all brand new niggas just scared to death
I spent too many nights sniffin' coke, gettin' right
Wastin' my life, now I'm tryin' to make things right
Grand open some gates, invest in the rag business
Do things for the kids, the little Dunns
Build a jungle gym behind the crib, so they can enjoy youth
CBR's and VCR's, ATV's and big screen TV's
Nigga, please, don't make me have to risk my freedom
We worked our whole life for this, you get your shit beat in

Peoples to rock to, stirrin' up pots of brew
In hell's kitchen, I chef the impossible
To serve hot plates all across the Unified States
Sit down and sup with the top rap reps
We the streets that's watchin', boy, move diligent
You better walk like a nigga on a tightrope do
Infamous first infantry, first division, fourth mission
First assignment, give 'em that shit they been missin'
My new edition's way bitchin'
Those that listen get addicted to my diction
Fuck rhymes, I write prescriptions for your disease
Generic raps just not potent like P's
One-thousand one-hundred CC's on the throttle
I peel off, chest naked on Katanas
Spaghetti head Mobb niggas is full bred
Fully-blown melanin tone
I rock skeleton bone shirts and verses
But thirst for worse beats
So I can put more product out on the street
Get respect and love all across the board
We've been adored for keepin' it raw
Nothin' less or more, I score every time for sure
While the rest of y'all niggas just nil

(No the REAL hood the hood, not the RAP hood)
(The REAL hood, like three pair of pants)
My friends, I'll say it clear (pair of sneakers)
(My moms is bustin' her ass) State my case
(Nigga I'm goin' to Japan tomorrow!) Which I'm certain
(You understand what I'm sayin'? Can you believe that?)
I lived a life that's full (They have people, waitin'
At the airport like five days like I'm a Beatle or somethin')
(That's really somethin'!) And I traveled each, and every highway
(Seen the best of the best, the worst of the worst) and more
Much more than this (still here) I did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy
(Let's try this one, uhh, yeah!)

[Break: Jay-Z (Paul Anka sample)]
Gangsta nigga
Put my hustle down, tore the game up, nigga
Took your high score down, put my name up, nigga
Tore the doors down to the Hall of Fame is Jigga
I did it my way (and more.. much more than this)
That's right, it's a beautiful thing man!
(I did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy) I did it my way -- Hovi baby!
[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Momma's youngest and strongest, survived summers like saunas
Mastered a corner like Deion in his uniform
Pop hurtin' assertive, flirted with death
Damn near murdered before my first album hit the shelf
Grandma's favorite, she could not understand
How there's people in the world who wouldn't want me as a neighbor
Had to explain to her, you think these folks want me in the penthouse
As a reminder that I make top paper?
Black entrepreneur, nobody did us no favors
Nobody gave us shit, we made us
The Rap Pack, I'm Sinatra, Dame's Sam Davis
Biggs the smart one on the low like Dean Martin
We came in this game, not beggin' niggas pardon
Demandin' y'all respect, hand over a check
And while y'all at it, hand over the jet
We the reason they ain't hand over Def Jam so quick
They knew every year I was droppin' new product
I was raisin' the stock up, while buildin' the Roc up
But that's alright, 'cause they knew they had to see us
When it was time for us to re-up, make us multi-million-aires
Je-je-jeah!

[Chorus: Paul Anka sample]
And more, much more than this; I did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy
[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Jeah! In my lifetime
I caught smaller cases, but I had capital
Hypocritical system let me right back at you
You better hope a rich rapper never attacks you
Not even that scratches you, 'specially if you black dude
They don't give a shit unless the accused just happen to rap
And they can look good by paintin' him as bad news
'Cause in my past, I seen dudes get half of they views
Exposed to the curb and nobody said a word
So imagine how disturbed I was
When I seen how big they made my fight scene at the club
Let me explain exactly how this shit was
This nigga Un yo I scratched him, he went home without an aspirin
But it’s cool 'cause we back friends, it happened and it's over
It's in the past and I'm glad, now I'm back to bein' Hova
Maybach with the chauffeur, laid back
Helicopter seat, feet inclined, shit feelin' like a sofa
Helicopter meet me, Teterboro take me over
Somewhere peaceful for the weekend now it's back to speakin' to vultures
So the next time that page six approaches us
Here's a quote from Jay, nigga I did it my - way

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Well boy you wanna do shit, let's get to it
You already know I'mma run right through it
I'm just like fluid, matter fact like water
Come and be real or go lil harder
Hide your girlfriend, wife, or daughter
Put her on a plate I'mma serve your order
Line em up, put em in place for the slaughter
Game over by the end of first quarter
Wake up hater, rise and shine
I'm a star boy, you riding pine
I got your main girl riding mine
Her face in my lap as I recline
It's grinding time and I declare
I run my fingers through her hair
I run these streets like marathons
You can't touch me like Hammer, gone

Bitch, you know I got Bun B in the front seat
And we got these boppers on the chrome
One time for your boy Pimp C, pocket full of stones
Yeah, I gotta pocket full of stones
'Cause I fell off my dirt bike in cargo pants
I rock the microphone literally
Litter the track lyrically with bottles cans
Pop a band, put a stack on it I'll water these plants like Aqua Man
Make a rapper run back to the studio
Retrace his steps like he dropped a gram
I'll be damned, Catfish Billy
You don't wanna run if your rhythm ain't ready
Sling syllables, beat's edible, incredible, inevitably BLOW!

Every Cloud Is A Superhero,KTH2,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Hook: Every Cloud is A Superhero

[Verse 1: KTH2]
We bust out rapping rhymes, collecting fines
Cause I don’t believe in slow, yield or stop signs
I talk slow but that's cause I got a busy mind
U say 2 plus 2, I say 2x plus cosine
U say lets go eat, well I say lets go dine
Cause my vocab’s exemplary not just ok or fine
They say every cloud a superhero-what do that mean?
To me they smooth and round like the bald head of Mr. Clean
My imagination terrible like the jokes of tom green
Or the crimes of a dope fiend
Or European hygiene
So look to the sky its me wit the big white things
If every cloud a superhero, then call me Black Lightning

Hook: Every Cloud is A Superhero

[Verse 2: KTH2]
If every cloud a superhero, the roof must be the villain
Being a self-proclaimed cloud, I'mma tear down the ceilin'
I'm not a big, green monster killer, but these beats I stay killin'
Cause im better than u hulk, sorry if I hurt yo feelins
Swinging through the puffy smoke- shooting web at the sun
My words are like weapons-they don’t kill, they just stun
Hop up in the Cloudmobile and hear the engine rev run
But this ain't his house no more, cause I won't be outdone
And when the storm hit—it be a lightning show
And when the slackers spit—I still be writing tho
And when the safety blitz—Imma block him and turn pro
And when you call it quits—I’ll be like teen titans-GO"

Billy ain't slept for days
Gotta keep up with the profit
Gotta keep up with the craze

Gotta walk through the maze
Down where the sun don't shine
And the pine trees sway
And when the wind blew
And the cradle fell
Down come baby Billy
And up come an able male
Momma stayed at work
Daddy stayed in jail
Hey that's a full deck
But ya gotta play with what your dealt
So Billy dealt the joker
Put the sheriff in a choker
He drank himself sober
And pissed in a Super Soaker
And he wet 'em all up
And left his snow yellow

Now I got the cops on my tail for that
Run up on your car with a stale banana
In your tail pipe, can't believe you fell for that
It could've been a molotov cocktail for that
Wait a minute, man, what the hell was that?
I heard a noise, where you going? What are you, bananas?
You can't go back there, stupid ass

Talk My Shit,XV,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","O[Intro]
Can I talk my shit again? Can I talk my shit again?
Can I talk my shit again? Lemme talk my shit again

[Verse 1: XV]
Quote, unquote, over dope, crack with a dose of coke
Show my roots bare so yeah, they should know I float
Coming to America with dreams in an overcoat
Diving in queens like a king trying to sow his own
Sexual chocolate, give me the mic and I’m gon' make it awkward
Then I just drop it, ahem clear my throat of that bull
But when it come to shit my nigga, I still talk it
Yeah, still walking in star war forces
Still eat beats nigga, all four courses
Still stay swerving like I’m in Kentucky Derby
The way that I be pushing out all twelve horses
Still winning while they all yell forfeit
Still killing rappers, leaving all pale corpses
Still with my crew in the Solitude Fortress
Splitting up money like divorces
[Hook]
So can I talk my shit again while I get it in?
And they sit around, acting like I didn’t win
Hope they made room for my crew to get it in
And I'mma be cool in this throne I’m sitting in
Talk my shit, talk my shit, please excuse me while I talk my shit
Talk my shit, talk my shit, please excuse me while I talk my shit
Can I talk my shit again? Can I talk my shit again?
Can I talk my shit again? Lemme talk my shit again

[Verse 2: XV]
This is pound sign Vizzy Zone, please tell my city I’m getting gone
So you can probably expect mini clones, XXL didn’t expect XV to excel
So before I enrolled, I was expelled, don’t worry though
I’m fine, that shit don’t eclipse me, it ain’t blocking my shine
Cause with my rhymes, I be on the cover of home and garden
And still be the coldest artist, I’m cold regardless
Flow is heartless, I know where I’m going like a homing target
They know he flawless when he came in the city with Chiddy Bang
And busy in any lane and they knowin' the Vizzy name
Crazy how shit’s changed in nine months
Steve Jobs couldn’t feel the bitches that I touch
Please God, give your boy a hand when his times’ up
Until then, I'mma keep tearing these rhymes up

[Hook 2]
So can I talk my shit again while I get it in?
And they sit around, acting like I didn’t win
Hope they made room for my crew to get it in
And I'mma be cool in this throne I’m sitting in
Talk my shit, talk my shit, please excuse me while I talk my shit
Talk my shit, talk my shit, please excuse me while I talk my shit
So can I talk my shit again while I get it in?
And they sit around, acting like I didn’t win
Hope they made room for my crew to get it in

Talk my shit, talk my shit, please excuse me while I talk my shit

Your Mothers Got a Penis,Goldie Lookin Chain,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
That's right, you knows what I'm saying
Your mother's offered me the goods, I'm not paying
It started as a laugh, as a bit of a joke
Something funny to say when I was having a smoke
I first heard off this bloke, this fucking rumour going round
Your mother's reputation- it's not sound
She's saving up the pennies hoping they'd turn into pounds
To have an operation to swap her gender around
It's a shock to me and it's a shock to you
Your mother's got a beard, sandals and a penis too
It don't look right see, when she's walking down the street
To see her ball bag jiggin' to the beat of her feet

[Hook]
I said
Your mother's got a penis
Your mother's got a penis
Your mother's got a penis
That's right
Your mother's got a penis
[Verse 2]
In internet rooms and computer mainframes
There's loads of emails about your mother's blue veins
Not the ones in her legs or the backs of her arms
But the ones in her member hidden in her gown
She walks around proud, with a short dress on
Which sometimes exposes the tip of her dong
Often it's dripping, sometimes it's dry
No matter when I see her there's a tear in my eye
I thought I had to tell you, had to put it in a letter
But I thought fuck that I'd write a song is much better
The only way to do it, to really let you know
I could prove it because I gave it a blow
It was purely accidently because she got me really drunk
And she made me kiss her elephant trunk
You know why? That's right
Your mother got a penis

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
When she walks down the street, then she walks like John Wayne
I just seen her pissing standing up again
Don't make no sense when you see her here and there
She got a cock and balls and real pubic hair
And a single eye that sometimes weeps
If she lying on the bed then she rubs it on the sheets
Or up against the door or the back of your neck
If your mother's around then you make a double check
I hate to tell you with all due respect
Take your mother to the doctors because her front bum's wrecked
[Hook]

[Outro]
For the 18th week running, UK rap grounp the GLC hold the number one
Position of the US billboard chart with another smash hit, ""Your Mother's Got A Penis""

Come 'ere boys, you ever seen a woman with a cock before?
Come yer, c'mon look at it. Bouncing up and down I'll stick it in you
Come yer, a woman with a cock. Tidy!

Yeah it's the truth man, his mother have actually got a penis"

I ball for real: y'all niggas is Sam Bowie
And with the third pick, I made the earth sick
M.J., him Jay, fade-away, perfect

Yeah
Up to third grade it was all As, fourth and fifth grade was the hard days
Detention and suspension was an always, by the time high school it was the hallways
Them was the wish I had a car days, 'cause all the stewards that was trapping they was all payed
And we was all broke, that's when the law broke
Cops catch us wouldn't say a word like our jaw broke
Picture me back then, look at me right now
Preforming in front of twenty thousand on the mic now
I caught a couple cases, I had to pipe down
Was living in the dark I'm in the light now
You grind hard, then you shine harder
I'm going hard like my last name Carter, Dwayne, Sean, and Vin

Oh yeah, she told me to grow up, I grew up and stood up now each day I move up again
I got a minute to say what I want, trying to make for everything that I've done wrong

I say change for the better, I'm never thinking back
I should be a power forward
Shitting so much I think my toilet outta order
Take 'em out the box they like a fish up out the water
But me, I'ma survive, put that on my Ma swear to God
How you gonna win when you never try
I can see my future like I'm living in a mirage
Everyday I'm living life like I could never die
Old clothes in my closet, new whips in my garage
New chick in my bedroom, old chick by my side

Ridin' on the 2-4's, I'm ahead of my time
Watch one of a kind, another one of 'em mine
Phone bill four grand, get your ho on my line
In the hood, ho niggas act funny
Only real niggas really get to touch cash money
[Hook: Dre]
I spent about 100 million dollars
100 million dollars, 100 million dollars

Ya thought he was ya dog, said he was a G (G)

Fuck around and get everybody indicted
Saw this shit coming, you woulda thought I was a psychic
Fuck around and go dead broke trying to fight it

I, I, I all night it, I every day it
And when it comes to my dues, I overpaid it
Rated hood bitch, bitch I'm hood bitch (Bitch, bitch)
I ain't a asshole, but I'm on some hood shit
I wish I would switch, I don't know how
Blood Gang swarm like a red ant pile
Mean mug, like I can't smile

Muenster, Colby, American, or cheddar
When it come to robbery, nobody do it better
Notorious L.A.D., fresh Coogi sweater (Gangsta Gri-Zillz! Yeah)
The cleanest, lyrics is the meanest
Understand my English, nigga, I'm a genius
Ice like a snow cone, writing in my iPhone
Went from selling crack to selling ringtones
Straight out the projects to million-dollar homes
Inside The Carter, cooking 36 zones
Thirty-six O's, and I break 'em all down
In and out of every trap, all through the A-Town (Ill!)
The Embassy, AMG, Young Money merger
I'm a young champ Like Ben Roethlisberger (AMG!)
S.S. Chevy with the big block engine
Rims and paint cost me a whole pension, pow! (Gangsta!)

Fuck tryna be fresh—get your grind right

Private planes, palm trees, big change, I can't complain
I made a promise to myself that I'd never be a have-not
Nigga, fuck being broke, shit
Before that day come, I'll A-K stamp you
When there's beef, I'm in the center like Tyson Chandler
Fuck what you heard, in the booth, I goes off like the lights if you ain't pay and it's the third

Disrespect your man, put my hand 'round his neck
It's no other than Gudda Gudda, man
Still 'bout my money, nigga, fuck another man

Hoping if I missed we'd least land on a star
But I foolishly assumed
That once we got there we would still be what we are
I never felt so wrong before
The girl I knew is gone and she don't love me anymore
Ill never sing a song again more lovelier than yours and I'm sure
Never mind

Where am I supposed to go?
They say a wise man knows how much he doesn't know
Was it all a waste of time
I thought that I was yours but I guess that you were never mine

Never mine(x3)

I was combination, thinkin' and drinking
Having awkward conversations
Ya know, typical weekend
Now its my typical weekday
Everyday's just a literal replay
The mistakes I made and how I blew it
Another love ruined like there wasn't much to it
And maybe I'm crazy
Should've seen this coming and know that for a moment I meant something to someone
But who cares what happens half the time if the other half I'm spending with you
Never mine

Daughters prayin', try'na put cha back up in the portrait

When you was home it's like they smiles never drop
Collect calls with all the hopes of the best
And hang up with a knot in my chest
See, see your cell is my hell
My hell is our pain

Foul and flagrant, I was taken off course (I was lost!)
The road ahead should have ended me in divorce (I see now)
But now I see clearly with the family of four
Never did I deserve a two-seater Porsche (Never!)
Heart filled with remorse, my life was such a mess
Now I'm back on board, due to the Lord's GPS (I'm back!)

YES... more than blessed, I was choosen

Wasted so much time stuntin' for folk (Wasted so much time!)

*oh shit*
A lot of people ask me what my life is like
What I do everyday
So I wrote a song about it
Here it goes!
(yo Joel, turn me up in my headphones!)

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning around 9 o'clock
Had some shit to do, but I forgot
So I rolled a blunt
Smoked it in my love seat
Bought it with my medicard
Thank god for the pharmacy
Logged onto the internet
Hoping shit picks up for me
Holla at my nigga Green luckily he fucks with me
But he on tour now somewhere out in India
And I'm learning the difference between sativa and indica
[Hook]
And this is the beginning of my everyday
Everyday's a holiday at least thats what I always say
Ok, ok
Alright, alright
And I'mma probably do the same thing tonight

[Verse 2]
I could've swore there was shit I had to do
I remembered at two in the afternoon
Should've got it done at 12
Put it on the shelf
Oh well procrastinator
Probably make a crappy waiter
So later for that bullshit im on my grizzy
Feeling mad official cause the bloggers start to diss me
And its a tricky thing cause if their dissining that means their listening
It takes conditioning by growing thicker skin
Voila
You see I'm exhausted by this shit its a difference of opinion
Am I awesome or the shit
In my head I'm walking around like I'm as awesome as it gets
And everyone knows it too but they won't acknowledge it
So if you're having girl problems stop pouting
I got 99 of them bitches, say fuck it, and stop counting
And I'll have more people counting as the day go, hopefully
Good girls go to heaven, bad bitches roll with me

She said, ""Fuck Fendi"", but I think she was playin'
I heard she move them thangs, I think she fuckin' Wayne
She call herself Lewinsky, that means she give him brain
She tryna be like Lil' Kim; her picture looks the same
Why she ain't signed with G-Unit, she from Queens, right?
And what's her nationality? She Chinese, right?
I mean she okay, but she ain't all that
She ain't the next bitch, tell that bitch, fall back
See I'm a hater, I go hard, listen, let's begin
You know her last name Minaj? She a lesbian
And she ain't never comin' out, look at Currensy
But every time she do an interview, you know I run and see
She get me so sick, it make me vomit
That's why I spend my time online, leaving comments
And you know that I got some more haters with me
Might hit up ThisIs50
MTV, hit up BET, tell 'em pretty, pretty please don't play Nicki

Bitches is like crabs in a bucket
You see a bad bitch gettin' shine, you should love it
'Cause every time a door opens, for me that means you
Just got a better opportunity, to do you
They don't understand, these labels look at numbers, it's statistics
I lose, you lose, ma, it's just logistics
Anyway, real bitches listen when I'm speakin'
'Cause if Nicki win, then all of y'all gettin' meetings
Ask L.A. Reid, ask Jay
Then hit up Universal, see what Sylvia Rhone say
Ask Craig Kallman, you can ask Chris

Only underground bitch around that's ducking the paparazzi
In and outta town, be swervin' the Maserati
Stay around the white like a Nazi

Still I rise, still I fight, still I might crack a smile
Keep my eyes on the prize, see my haters, tell 'em hi (I'ma keep my eyes on the price, oh, oh)

Seeking vengeance with no repentance now, man is, labeled a menace
By Lieutenant Fuck 'em Juv
Which enables me to conduct an attitude
Look here
How many of you niggas ready to start Big Tymin'
Look here
How many of you niggas wanna be ridin' reclining
Diamonds shining sipping on Heinekens your mind was in a trance
Time to go take a chance to advance
Police, you want the killin' to cease, give us a million a piece
And we'll get off of the streets and build our house in the east
I know the answer is No!
So up until my death
I'm screamin', ""Fuck Bill Clinton and Bob Dole""
Look here
When I was young I didn't hardly know shit
Figured ballin' would get the mediocre nigga noticed
So I approach it like I was coached Griff using a gun
Game could be over come if you silence your tongue
My name ring as the chosen one threw out the slums
Since a embryo in my mother many pains I brung

[Chorus]
Who's the motherfucka
I'm the motherfucka
Who's the motherfucka
I'm the motherfucka
Who's the motherfucka
I'm the motherfucka
Who's the motherfucka
I'm the motherfucka
Who's the motherfucka
I'm the motherfucka

[Verse 1: Ikon the Verbal Hologram]
Enter the eye of the storm
Rappers just battle me for the glory
It gets gory
They shitty like suppositories, that's the end of the story
Bury his body in Missouri
Banish the apparatus of Gladys to crematories
My territory, perimeter of purgatory
Stingy in winches of vicious, malicious inflictions upon your click
Circulatory
Causing head spasms
Rip through your motherfucking temple like Phantasm
Hologram has'em and walks through the holy arches
Left you in the forest with your carcass in the harness
Death is upon us, we slam like Adrian Adonis
Swarm on the warm blood like malicious pirahnas
Islamic Bombers, no contender is parallel
When I'm on paper, devastate'em like 7L
So where I dwell, without question rattles the league
Left you in a vessel with severe battle fatigue
Before you leave I insist you listen to more raps
Before I saw cats, making weapons out of your thorax

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]
I inhale toxins
Drunk off blood from dead cops and
The watchmen, that kill us in this maze we locked in
Side Cobra Clutch, only truth can sober us
Wild cause we know there's no Jehovah watching over us
Only 10 percent that's controlling us
Try to take our souls from us, while they stay patrolling us
Caged in we break barriers, change to new areas
Dodgin' the pigs in chariots out to bury us
Jus Allah don't make threats
Leave your fuckin' necks clipped
Have you speakin' the manual alphabet
Seein' me is def not repeated or done twice
I laugh as I cast the first stones at Christ
Joint in ace bands, you move to Graceland and Satan
Mics spray then, bury flesh in wasteland
Infect you
Inject you with the gunpowder pegs
Indent your forehead with hot lead
Whether in the abode of the dead
Or resting in the Zions
Allah stay chasin' the dough like wild lions
Unchained tearin' your flesh we unfed
Flyin' through, like birds we takin' your daily bread

[Excerpt from ""Greater Love"" by Wilfred Owen]
Kindness of wooed and wooer
Seems shame to their love pure
O Love, your eyes lose lure
When I behold eyes blinded in my stead!
Your slender attitude
Trembles not exquisite like limbs knife-skewed
Rolling and rolling there
Where God seems not to care:
Till the fierce love they bear
Cramps them in death’s extreme decrepitude
Your voice sings not so soft,—
Though even as wind murmuring through raftered loft,—
Your dear voice is not dear
Gentle, and evening clear
As theirs whom none now hear
Now earth has stopped their piteous mouths that coughed"
Underwater,Ghostface Killah,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse: Ghostface Killah]
Ayo, I'm lost underwater
I see a pink door with a crystal handle, so I keep swimming
Amazed that I'm not drowning
Butterflies took control when I arrived, I opened the door
No I knocked first, I'm not on my turf
I seen a ray of lights that resemble live fireworks
Some mermaids with Halle Berry haircuts flashing
They tail like follow me now, don't be afraid
I'mma show you where all the djinns and spirits pray
If you scared to face this life you shouldn't stay
So I kept on swimming, grabbed on to her fin to help me out
As we got close I seen the boat all shot up with his anchor out
Then she asked me politely what I'm thinking about, I said nothing
She said nothing leaves nothing
If you feel me I bet this'll bring that out
I seen rubies, diamonds, smothered under octopus
Jellyfish sharks soar, aquaproof pocketbook
Pearls on the mermaid girls
Gucci belts that they rock for no reason from a different world
Up ahead lies Noah's Ark, but that's waves away
And way to the right, that's one of our bangin spas
She quoted I took notice, Spongebob in the Bentley Coupe
Bangin the Isleys, he slow backed up
Then he passed me swoop, seen his chick eyein me hard
He got vexed and smacked his boo
Took off, continued my travels
Seen a rock from the Titanic, looking fat and nah it wasn't damaged
Then I seen somethin real big
Sky blue and gold with whitewalls, behind a large city
That was lost before Christ walked the walk
Upon the waters that's so bright
Everytime we got close the mermaid held on tight
All I heard was ""Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar""
""Bismillah ar-Rahman, ar-Raheem, Allah screamed""
That we heard from afar, everyone selat
In the world's banginest mosque got crowded in
With life that I can't explain
They said sir yes I'm glad you came, greeted me with Qu'rans and Torahs
Prayed after that we said amen"
XXL Freshman Freestyle,Yelawolf,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Hell of a day to load a
22 and take it to the woods
And then bring it to a body
And somebody muthafucka not a single solitary
Thing is missin' from my Southern roots
Manage to take a Cheverolet run up through
The muthaf-cking mud, forget it
Hell of son of a bitch my momma raised into a rapper
Who could tell a story like my uncle when he’s drinking
Product of a working environment, fuck is y’all thinking
Meaning I’m working working harder
Than any artist could ever do it
Simply cause I’m made that way
I build a house around ya ass before you
Can realise that you in a neighborhood that Yelawolf made
So call me a redneck and tell your boys
About it, tell ‘em I’m an Alabama wannabe
I be that, I just take it to the studio and
Drop a bomb on you from a muthaf-cking beanie bag. I need that

Born On The Fourth of July, with Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind
Lost In Translation, I was Almost Famous till The Invention Of Lying
Little Miss Sunshine had a Paper Heart
We had a Brief Encounter in Jurassic Park
But I'm a Raging Bull, we A World Apart
I'm creeping down Miss Annie Hall, Sexy Beast, Alpha Dog
The Unfaithful, Sex, Lies And Videotape, yeah boy, you can have it all
But There Will Be Blood, She a Psycho like American History X
But before we can be The Departed One Flew Over The Cukkoo's Nest
The Dark Knight, she threw me Into The Wild Manhattan
But before it's the Night Of The Living Dead
I'll head down to Brazil with Judge Dredd
Yeah, Public Enemies, I'm Ghost Dog, Catch Me If You Can
She screaming Liar, Liar I turn into the Man On Fire
It's a Dog Town, Do The Right Thing or Forever be Unforgiven
Shit, how many A Beautiful Mind turn ugly for a Pretty Woman
Big Daddy turns to Rocky, I'm Pollock in this Fight Club
But just like in the movie Up, It ain't Love Actually, it's actually Love

Strangers On A Train, then it Crash
The Devil Wears Prada bags
The Color Purple, and Clockwork Orange, I'm just trying to see that Snatch
And I'm gonna hit that Belly Bad Boy, like an Alien, Girl, Interrupted
Then Blade Runner on that bitch, call that Poetic Justice
In my School Daze on the Mean Streets
Damn right I can tell you A Bronx Tale
Sometimes we were Boondock Saints, some nights we had Time To Kill
Some nights it was Coffee and Cigarettes in Chinatown On The Waterfront

No Mystic River, none of that, It was just The Kid
And The Usual Suspects, 12 Monkeys trying to be Big Fish

Tell em they ain't even got to take off no clothes

When you see me in that old school swerving
Probably cause your baby mama in my lap slurping
Hit the freeway goin 77 south
Thick light skinned dime setting off the mouth
Take your time speed it up really don't matter at all
Long as the baby batter splatter in ya jaw
Let it shoot from the window to the wall
My knees week I try to stand up and I fall
Now it's my niggas turn he got next

So you can salive it but you ain't gotta hide it
The whole hood know that you a go liver
So go head and dive in my thighs like Godiva
Gave shawty a ride but she ain't have no gas money
She said ""Chip I'm broke but you can get some ass from me""
""I gotta better idea""

Pull up in a lex

The Town,Macklemore,"['alternative', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Now when I say 2-0, you say
Nah, you know the rest
This is our scene
Our music, our movement, the history lives through us
I write to the beat and let life play the guitar strings
Despite the drama, there's respect and camaraderie
Every time one of my friends is mentioned in My Philosophy
It's a rite of passage, I'm not trying to be corny
I got love for Sportn' Life, Alpha P, Massline, and Onry
Every time somebody steps out on the road
They bring a little Northwest soul with them, amen
Alright then, just so you know
I try to carry that every time that I rock a show
So, turn my sound up
Ricochet off our mountain
It's Good Medicine that Chief Sealth would've been proud of
Sends our city, town pride, heart, blood, sweat, tears, I-5
North, South side, vibe, live, ride down these city blocks
And never will be stopped
They tryin' to shut down the clubs that my city rocks
Now Mr. Mayor why would you enforce an ordinance?
Music it saves lives, these kids out here are supporting it
And through the art form we've learned the importance of community
Truth to the youth so they know what's up
Yup, and as a public school student
I learned from my teachers, but became through my music
Take that away, that's a vital
14 Fathoms Deep, Do the Math, Tribal
My greatest teachers: B-Self and Vita
Wordsayer was my mayor and things have changed
But I carry the torch and what I do with that flame
Is lit every time that I step on the stage
The skyline is etched in my veins
You can never put that out, no matter how hard it rains
[Hook]
Northwest, making you feel the vibe
Check how Seattle do, coming to my side
I mean I like how y'all do
Thank you, but we onto new
Put it down for the town with music
Making you feel the vibe
Check how Seattle do, coming to my side
When my peeps know my crew bring the flame
Put it down for the town
Wearing that Seattle blue

[Verse 2]
That's right, when you put on a show
And watch the people seat in between the creases and the doors
Hitting up Meli or sneaking in 'cause they're broke
Not leaving in between sets because of needing to smoke
The reason being whatever
The scene from Beacon to Everett
Is in need of less ego when we kick it, alright?
I get on stage, style, share my whole life
Try to reach 'em at the bar where they're drinking Miller Lite
But the kids in the front, they bring out the passion, dude
Make noise throughout the show and not only when we ask 'em to
I watch the older cats jaded in the back
Hands clasped, forgot when they weren't too cool to be a fan, damn
Hatin' at the concert
You don't remember RKCNDY, watching Heiro, or vibing out to Alkaholiks
I know it's not the same, it never will be
But my, my, my, my city's filthy
And we've been truly dope
Since Supreme was up on Broadway in the dookie rope
Mean muggin' in Sir Mixalot's video
Back when Scene was rockin' house parties on the floor
JMG's, Sit N' Spin, and The Paradox
Back when Marc introduced Geo to Sabz
So much has changed here, so much has not
I was just a kid hopin' I could earn my spot
Try to get some props
Meet a promoter who'll give me a shot
To let me get up on stage and get the crowd to rock
Read a page out my notebook
What I thought would be respected, they would connect with it
Now looking over the city's the only thing that keeps me calm
Scattered thoughts jotted down by this pen in my palm
It's like my city stands still, the world looks on
If I could only capture its beauty and put it in a song"
Cook It Down Freestyle,Pusha T,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
I went ahead and asked God for forgiveness
So now I’m just asking you to listen
I’m living in a World, where my truth can be my lynching
Last words “fuck you all” feel the ropes tension
I’ll never compromise, in it 'til the powder dries
Best friends drowned in quick sand and help you cowards rise
I floss in their honor, there legacy’s in bottles
Make them walk like their 30 years is right around the corner
We was all fucking Shawna, you and E was fucking on her
I was jealous when you both said her mouth was like piranha
Yeah, spend money like we print money
Buck fifty on the car, that's little Dent money
The AC is forever broke, that's vent money
Cocaine snowballed from gambling my rent money
Everyday struggle get money, get the crown for
Always thinking big now they praying for downfall

Say you telling on me, told them folks bout me
All this coke round me like it floats round me
Cook it down, cook it down, you know that I cook it down

No rent couple hundred K spent on it
Cook it down, cook it down, you know that I cook it down
Cook it down everytime I come around

Got me loooking at the crown from a birdseye view
Cause I hit the ground running from the birds I flew
Now I’m standing at the top from the words I drew
Rap shit’ll drive you crazy, it done drove Shyne Jew
Mazel tov, now I’m hotter than a Molotov
Tell Lyor I need a million for my monologues
A small price for my cocaine catalogue
Scalp the coupe like a tomahawk
Travelodge stories, I pray that you ignore me
If you can’t feel the joy off a hustler in his glory
Hiding money in a wall from the first to third story
ATL, Glenridge, condo’s true story
A man of everything that I say I am
A little better than the fans, hope and pray I am
Weed the jokers out the deck and just play my hand
Smokers getting stuck and going nuts like it’s Peter Pan

Say you telling on me, told them folks bout me
All this coke round me like it floats round me

Bust on bitches be-lly, rub it in they tummy
Lick it, say it's yummy, then fuck your man
What's your plan, is it to rock the Tri-State?
Almost gold, five Gs a show date
Or do you wanna see about seven digits?
Fuck hoes exquisite, Cali, great place to visit
[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. (Stevie J)]
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)

Guess Whos Back,Supernatural,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Into]
I read minds, what people really be thinking
Some people sitting in here right now, thinking
What the fuck am I doing here?
Some people in here right now, thinking
Who the hell is that on the stage?

[Hook: Random Sound Bites]

[Verse 1]
Somebody better clear the lane
We about to do this shit, his son, like the wrath, the Kane
Supernat, I'm taking over your circumference
I'm the wrong MC to fuck with
The big bully of the beats is back on the playground
You need a mic cause I got something to say now
Half of these MCs is out of they league
Thinking they soldiers just cause they wearing fatigues
Half of they style is really only based on greed
But they really never speak what the black man need
You paid to get your record, play that just pay dues
We going all out, now I got nothing to lose
You caught me man in one of my terrible moods
And while I feel this, I'm a terrible dude
This is a deliverance from ignorance
Somebody raise they hands right now if they hearing this
It's therapeutic, when the beat get executed
The game is watered down, it's totally diluted
So it's time for the return of the undisputed
I got style, get this game, and I'm so de-rooted
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
The silver-back of rap is back
With a brand new sound to burn the whole damn game to the ground
One of the most hated, verbally underrated
Some cats don't like me, they say my ego inflated
But when I'm not around they do they best to imitate it
Took a break from the game, cause the game was jaded
Now I return to my post
I bet most of ya'll thought Supernatural was ghost (guess who's back)
No, I'mma to do this until the day that I die
You can't get rid of me, son, so don't even try
I know you tired of that old repetitive bullshit
I reloaded now, back with a full clip
You want a battle but you really not ready
And if you was ready you'd really have put up some Chedi
I've been doing this since the days of Crazy Legs and Rocksteady
(That old real shit)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So thank the man from up above
And the cats from up above for showing me love
For every fan that showed me respect in the club
And all you early cats thats popping your bud
I'mma get it pop two, yeah, popping a slug
When my CD hit the streets it's a popular drug
I see you clowns on TV, you just popular Scrubs
I told you when we get on, we all going eat
Half of these cats is whack, and I ain't losing no sleep
I'm back with a vengeance, so prepare for the smack-down
Now I'm moving up, no more playing the background

Dont Say Anything,Outasight,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
Don’t say one word, it’s not your concern
Don’t say anything to make things alright
Don’t say anything to make things alright

[Verse 1: Outasight]
As she said good morning Mr. Andrew
Huh, why you seem so stressed?
Is it ‘cause the world will eat you up and spit you out?
Make you feel like one of the rest
I clear my throat, clear my head
But I need to clear one of these checks
‘Cause the last call I got was from a collector
Saying I need to clear up some of this debt
Fret and when I go out on the town
I gotta give pounds to people I don’t like
Get a life, take a hike, fly a kite, goodbye
Even when the sun ain’t beaming when the morning
Or the evening, my future is still bright
But it’s a fight tonight-tonight
Don’t say anything to make it seem-seem alright
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Outasight]
Feeling low, my life is in limbo
Chances knocked out like I was fighting with Kimbo
Trying to get out of the rut, don’t know what I’m into
Wish it would work like I’m holding some mentos
Meet problems face on, met her late night
She didn’t put her face on, pull out the bottle, take some
Running away but getting chased on by Jason
Yo, no matter how fast I run-run-run, shit catch up to me, yo
Sometimes I think I’m having fun-fun but not really
I stop daily and think about the difference between failing
And being regular, comparing, to me, the synonyms definitions are similar
Never the point and never giving up, we getting up, come on

[Hook 2]
Don’t say one word, it’s not your concern
Don’t say anything to make things alright
Don’t say anything to make things alright
Don’t say one word, it’s not your concern
Don’t say one word, it’s not your concern
Don’t say one word, it’s not your concern
Don’t say one word
Don’t say anything to make things alright
It’s not your concern

Just a young nigga hustling, tryna get mines
Movin' with the 9 double M
Niggas like, ""You don't really wanna fuck with him""
Yeah, young teenager, infatuated with paper
Yeah I had to get it cause momma, she wasn't able
Black and white TV set, no cable
40's in the fridge, chicken noodles on the table
I wasn't born with a silver spoon
Child of the ghetto, raised off a different tune
Watching Bob Barker in my living room
If your price was right, I could get you a whole living room
Yeah, them was my gutter ways
Back in the gutter days, no education but the gutter pays
Through it all, I came a long way
From selling the yay, fistfights to gunplay

That's why I got guns and my guns got kids
That's why I be going so tough on them hoes
I play my own hand, I don't shuffle or fold
Fuck with a nigga, let's go fuck with some hoes
Hear them bitches screaming like they stuck in a hole
I am not a demon but was once a lost soul
'Til I found myself a block away from the crossroad
I have, outgrown the fishbowl
And now I'm on my feet like a fucking insole
And yeah it may hurt like a fucking lymph node
But it's fuck the world like a fucking nympho

Jay Rock still that same OG
I ain't tryna see the grave or the penitentiary
Everyday living, tryna stay on my feet

My wallet got flowers on it, killer cowards from milan
The stolen land where gold chains control a man
300 holdin hands, stolen grams
I play the fan, and wave and leave that nigga for dead, or should I save him?
Spittin out phlegm, no, just grave him
I remember days I used to work for niggas, eat jerk with niggas
Buyin whippids, laughing at jokes and try to flip
Clip is loyal, fly spoil on the block, display royal
Even though we go back to royals, black oils
Live as ever, can’t tell me nothing
Whatever this thing of ours is empowered by my niggas who pumping
24 hours of sling motion, wave brush

Spark up a L for the homies I haven't heard from
Burn when the urge come
I’m living lurge(large)
Never chilling on the curb, just a villian on the verge, son
My tenth shot is as official as the third one
Second one, first one
Worse come, the worst run
When I was pushed out of the womb the earth spun
The only way to describe this is inertia
Some rappers think they could try me, Who the first up?
I don’t guarantee no survivers, nigga surfs up
Yeah, soul on ice, courage and sacrifice, hold on tight
And save your laughter for the afterlife
These chumps thinkin they good, ain't even half as nice
Your fate will be a one-way ticket to paradise

Cause your dick ain't stunned
And you say bitch I want a refund
Yous a ho what you doin outta the kitchen bitch
Go make me a sandwich
And when she throws that shoe you better lay lo
And you say bitch I want onions and tomatosCut off that salad and not to much mayos
That ain't a memory you'd wanna treasure
And that ho leaves you without giving pleasure
But continue to dream on dont let go
Now you been talkd about around the ghetto

And it ain't a ho so you just can leave it
Be untruthful to it and deceive it
And when ya let go don't grieve it
Your dream is a race are you gonner walk it out
Even when your bein talked about
To get to the top you gotta work it
See somepeople might look happy but no one is perfect
On the streets use your mind and not your body
Remeber life is like the recession it has its ups and downs but it pisses of everybody
Rememeber work hard and everythings possible
Dream big even the impossible

How do you make your bread in the ghetto?
[Cappadonna]
Hustling, hustle & flow
We make bread in the ghetto, by selling that crack
See niggas that make bread by busting the gat
Might stick a nigga up, stab him dead in his back
It's a dirty bread game, but we get through them stacks
Bread game, rather have bread than fame
Some sell pills and weed, it ain't no joke
Might sell anything as long as we not broke
So if you getting that bread, we be coming for your throat
It's crazy what a brother might do for the bread
Might violate parole til ya family is dead
We get bread in the ghetto, while we ducking the feds
I heard bread in the ghetto got a loaf on his head, come on

[Hook]
Brother, listen to me
Brother, listen to me
Listen to me, and just lay up
How do you get rid of rats in the ghetto?

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo, aiyo we ox 'em, duff 'em, stuff 'em in black bags
Torture them, toss 'em out the window with rift rafts
Cuz we don't take kindly to rats in the ghetto
Either your mouth stay shut or get slapped with the metal
Big fat rats get fried like porkchops for snitching
Get your ass hung like a wall clock
It's Tone Stark, Billy the Kid when the gun bark
A wire sticking out his shirt, he talking to NARC!
[Hook]
How do you raise your kids in the ghetto?
How do you raise your kids in the ghetto?
Feed one child and starve another
Tell me, tell me, and just lay up

[U-God]
We like brothers, we came from the same mothers
In the projects, under the same covers
Wore the same drawers, fucked the same whores
Rolled dice, kicked rhymes, did crimes in the same hall
Sprayed our names on the same wall
Yo, your kids knew my kids, your wiz knew my wiz
Now you caught up in music and showbiz
If that's what it is, then that's what it is
Run up in your crib, with twelve black brothers
That'll digest to live, die just to live
Some called us martyrs, some called us fathers
Run up in the club like the suicide bombers
We be the brothers, ready past lovers
Never wanna see us, blow, we not others
Somewhere in the competition, friends got lost
The money got flipped, your tables got crossed
Now you all caught up in that label talk
Brain dead in the grain of thoughts
With a name and a game that can change New York
We ate from the same fork, pop had the same thought *echo*"

Ain't no stopping me ever your best move
Live O Ghetto, I rep it with no redemption
World wide critics acclaim I'm big news

East side boy I make da paper rise
Never been anything like these faker guys
Big up my north west, south east ties
Every section where my connection lies

Never had a desire for shiny suits (Nope)
Big up my Midlands, up north troops
Any place my face gathers up groups

Don't give it half-hearted, give it all

Don't give it half-hearted, give it all
Pull up your socks and stand up tall

You can't run the marathon without training
Or stretch the art form without straining
Too much hype not enough braining
Whole lot o' money, little maintaining
Whole lot o' complaining, no plan (What?)
Little more, no less then ten grand
Blinging, ice sitting nice in your hand
Too much platinum, not enough land

East side boy I make the paper rise
Never been anything like these faker guys
Big up my Ireland, Scotland ties

Any place my face gathers up groups

Don't be silly, come with your milly, I'm like billy
Don't be dumb, come with your gun, I ain't fun
When I come I'm coming to stun, you get bunned
Midnight, broad daylight fight, dogfight
You don't really want it with Dizzee, I get busy
You don't really want me to pop, I get fizzy
Real fizzy bill up a zoot, we smoke whizzy
He knows, she knows, we're tough negros
Forever ready and I'll be ready forever
You don't wanna try a ting, I'll put holes in your leather
So please never ever try try and be clever
I'll be wetting MC's like rainy weather
To the two faced get your screw face laced in
Get chased and get placed in the bin
Get a slicing, battering, working
Dizzee boy don't stop til it's hurting

Ends
Some people will rob their mother
For the ends
Rats snitch on one another

Sometimes kids get murdered
For the ends
So before we go any further
I want my ends

[Verse 1]
I knew this cat named Darrell, he didn't have a dollar
He was Harvard material, Ivy League scholar
Had a Ph.D., had an M.B.A
But now he's waiting tables cause there's rent to pay
Companies downsizing, inflation's rising
Can't find a job, he's feeling kind of stressed
Doesn't even feel the effects when he says
""Forgot to count how many times"" he ""been blessed""
So he falls off track, starts smoking the crack
And once it hits his brain, starts to chain react
Sells the shirt off his back, shoes off his feet
He's losing all his teeth, now he's out in the street
And all of sudden he's like, Jesse James...
Trying to stick up kids for their watches and chains
But he's from business school, and he's nervous with the tool
So he ends up on his back in a bloody pool

I knew this chick named Sally, she had a nice strut
Knew what I wanted, she was up in the cut
Swinging that butt, like place your ad here
Only rapped the Benz, and rocked the fly gear
Brand name wearing, champagne waving
Jewels around the neck, live style she's craving
Ain't no saving, she's doing enough spending
If you do the lending, she'll do the bending
Straight machine vending, it's money for tail
Shopping sprees get her on her knees
And if you hit her with keys of your crib, you acting funny
Come home one day, find her counting out your money
From the Wetlands, all the way to the Apollo
If you're broke she'll spit, and if you're rich she might swallow
For the ends

Making money on the block, kids was on they jock
They was tougher than leather like Reverend Run
DMC, they was toting guns
And holdin' weight, goin' out of state
Stackin' mad chips, and pushin' phat whips
Fly jewels and golds, and got no job
And then one disappeared, and one got robbed
For the ends

What Its Like,Everlast,"['rock', 'alternative', 'hip hop']","[Verse 1]
We've all seen the man at the liquor store beggin' for your change
The hair on his face is dirty, dreadlocked and full of mange
He ask the man for what he could spare with shame in his eyes
""Get a job, you fucking slob"" is all he replies

[Hook]
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in his shoes
Cause then you really might know what it's like to sing the blues
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)

Mary got pregnant from a kid named Tom who said he was in love
He said: ""Don't worry about a thing, baby doll; I'm the man you've been dreamin' of""
But three months later he said he won't date her or return her calls
And she sweared, ""Goddamn, If I find that man I'm cuttin' off his balls!""
And then she heads for the clinic and she gets some static walkin' through the door:
They call her a killer, and they call her a sinner, and they call her a whore!

I've seen a rich man beg
I've seen a good man sin
I've seen a tough man cry
I've seen a loser win
And a sad man grin
I heard an honest man lie
I've seen the good side of bad and the down side of up
And everything between
I licked the silver spoon, drank from the golden cup
Smoked the finest green
I stroked the baddest dimes
At least a couple of times
Before I broke their heart
You know where it ends
Yo, it usually depends
On where you start
[Verse 3]
I knew this kid named Max, he used to get fat stacks out on the corner with drugs
He liked to hang out late, liked to get shit faced and keep pace with thugs
Until late one night there was a big gunfight and Max lost his head
He pulled out his chrome .45, talked some shit and wound up dead
Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all of his pain
You know it comes that way, at least that's what they say when you play the game

[Hook]
God forbid you ever had to wake up to hear the news
Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to lose
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)

Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)

Glory,Lupe Fiasco,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
When your spirit is strained
And you limited to change
The lyrics in your limericks'll change
A different hook, the way the sentences arranged
More demented in your deliverance, more sinister in your slang
Sounds more belligerent when it's sang
The truth is limitless in its range
If you drop a 'T' and look at it in reverse it can hurt
Look at the grimaces of the pain
And it's worse when it works and your membership is gained
But you forgetting the proof diminishes in the flames
Like 'poof', the media pours images in your brain
Of the score of the war where militants is slain
The faces of the guilty where innocence is proclaimed
And they filthy, the deaf ears are the winners
The listeners are the lames
Of the ballad of the man that the son of a minister has became
So

[Hook]
Wherefore does my glory go?
Wherefore does my glory go? (Glory, glory)
Wherefore does my glory go?(Wherefore does my glory go?)
Wherefore does my glory go? (Glory, glory)
[Verse 2]
But you gotta understand, our differences is the same
What starts in clouded minds, finishes in the reign
Of the fools that are used as instruments in the game
Where oppression is the queen and ignorance is the king
Where revolution is dead, no candles in its memory
No remembrance of its fame, just a mystery
No mentioning the history of the chain, the enemy
No hennessy sentiments in its name
Just an unmarked grave that menaces have defamed
With the propaganda, and images of the gangs
A lost art, no apprentices in it trained
And they brainwashed, no interest in its stain
And the minds weary, all the adrenaline in it drained
While the wrecking ball is, disassembling things
Her highness is the cause, his eminence is the blame
The pride is still there, the privileges still remain, but

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And you've gotta respect the position in which you playing
Never let your heart reflect the conditions in which its staying
Even if it's dark, and the temperature is the same
As winters in the Ukraine, your appendages is in chains
Have forgiveness from the start, keep maliciousness restrained
Be smart, never indiscriminate in your aim
'Cos there's innocent witnesses oblivious to the things
That come, the one's the hypnotists keep entertained
And you can't arc, have some resilience in your frame
Stay resistant, and committed to what you sing, 'cos
They'll flip it the minute that you refrain
Read the book and the lines, and literature in between
You gotta be educated when going against the grain
Pay attention, they illegitimate in their claims
They assisted in the killing and pillaging
In addition to the addiction
Shit is much bigger than just them planes, but
[Hook]

Wherefore does my glory go?

Wherefore does my glory go?

Go on baby shake that thang, go head baby work that thang

Clear like a megaphone, pretty nigga heart skipped the metronome
Rocked the Trump Tower to the terrordome
Poor house to pleasure domes
Soprano, alto, tenor to baritone
Mos Def; one of the illest that you ever known
Rock steady baby, you a stepping stone
Smash your foundation into pebbles
My words leave your nerves unsettled
You take it to the next level down
Looking like a circus clown
Cats like you can't even get a pound
Worldwide from the river to lakeside
My stage show stay live, make the sound man stage dive
I cut fat cats to eight lives with my eight ball lines
I'm home 'fore I'm done with all nine
Got you shook like a fault line
Come all shine and get tarnished
Brooklyn got your pay roll garnished
They form a huddle
Whisper like they want trouble
I melt the ice grills into rainwater puddles
Make the proud-hearted leave on the humble
Black steel in the hour
Assemble my skill form my power
My poems crush bones into powder
You mumble like a coward
I'm Mos Def, you need to speak louder
Superheroes
Get your power, your masks and capes snatched
Brooklyn take what you can't take back
I know a lot of cats hate that
All I can say black
There's a city full of walls you can post complaints at
All the doubters and believers adjust your receivers
""I feel it,"" you can taste it through the speakers
The three six oh-riginal sketch lyrics so visual
They rent my rhyme books at your nearest home video

Tell them cats they need to sit back and observe where they at

Take a breath, take ten paces back
Stay on time like Omegas
Brooklyn patrol like interstaters
Take their license and their registration papers

My joint's so passionate
Make you peal out and mash your shit
Get wild cold crash your whip
Front chassis wrecked, but ock you can't be too upset
Tow truck got my tape in the deck
I'm permanent like tattoos and birth marks
Third degree burn marks
Driving on tracks like Dale Earnhardt
Stay on the low like the herb spot
Put a big loss on your earn chart
Nice since the nurse signed my birth chart
Seldom seen but often heard, while your jams is barely heard
Just my name is a daily word
From avenues to streets, terraces and park places
Stair wells, jail cells, penthouse to basements
Arrangement basic, but still fans chase it
Y2K can't delete the true ancient
Apache war drum on the ranges
Skill level dangerous
Arrow head that killed all the cavemen
They cry John-Blazing, but step on the pavement
And get violated like a plaintiff
I ain't shit to play with
I give a Goddamn what your name is
Delete it and make it so it never get repeated
Believe it
Tell the feds, tell your girl, tell your mother
Conference call you wack crew and tell each other
That they just ain't holding me
I'm Mos Def, you hopefully
Mush on before you get bust off like a ovary

But it don't work 'cause the crowd don't boo me
You ain't a true G, I'm too deep
How can Kano stay underground?
I ain't like most that roll around
And kick shit off, I hold it down
But we're still gully
The only 'pop' you'll hear from us is
Pop-pop-pop, then we're out
Act up and get boxed in the mouth
'Cause you're just playing a gangster
You ain't never weighed the ounce, fought a bouncer
You ain’t never hid no blots in your mouth
You ain't got love in North, West and South
And I'm an East boy, you're a chief boy
I finish it when you start the beef boy
Girls like me but I ain't a sweet boy, so boy
Don't think you can move to me and think I'll be asleep boy
'Cause I'm on my P's and Q's
That's why I make more P's than you's
Even when I'm in 3s and 2s, slip?
There ain't no reason to, slipping
If there ain't a blitz between the clique, that's slipping
No whip, out the manor linking chicks?
That's slipping, that's slipping
[Chorus]
If you see me and I ain't with my crew
Believe I'm on my P's and Q's
Even on my own two
That's the difference between me and you
If you see me and I ain't with my crew
Believe I'm on my P's and Q's
Even on my own two
That's the difference between me and you
If you see me and I ain't with my crew
Believe I'm on my P's and Q's
Even on my own two
That's the difference between me and you
If you see me and I ain't with my crew
Believe I'm on my P's and Q's
Even on my own two
That's the difference between me and you

[Verse 2]
I hate losing, so I ain't snoozing
From London to Luton, I'm moving
I'm even merking overseas
And I got it locked from London to Leeds
Please, from time you heard me shine
Now I'm big from London to Merseyside
You got lines but you spit like nursery rhymes
This year's gotta be mine, I'm the first in line
Wow, you got your first rewind
But the second line sounded like the first line
I ain't got punchlines, I got kick lines
And I ain't commercial but I got hit lines
I spit deep rhymes
But I've got the girls on my side from the first rewind
You might see my face in a magazine
Or in a fur coat in FACE Magazine
'Cause they're spreading the word down from raves that I been
And they're bringing the purse out to pay for my team
I couldn't give a shit, I'm breaking the scene
Making a scene then start making the cream
Seen? I got a gang with me
And we all walk with a gangster lean
You're all talk, you don't wanna ramp with me
There's no jokes or no pranks with me
[Chorus]
If you see me and I ain't with my crew
Believe I'm on my P's and Q's
Even on my own two
That's the difference between me and you
If you see me and I ain't with my crew
Believe I'm on my P's and Q's
Even on my own two
That's the difference between me and you

[Verse 3]
If you see me and I ain't with my crew
Believe I'm on my P's and Q's, in sneaks or shoes
We're in a Honda, fuck it, no Jeeps and coupes
We'll chief your crew, we're so hungry, we'll teef your food
So mind out before you find out who you're speaking to
I speak to youths on a level, and speak the truth
So please, there's thug in me
But there ain't no me in you
And please, you ain't bussing one, let alone squeezing two
Say cheese, but it won't be a snapshot
Pull out and try and hit like the jackpot, leave
I ain't waiting around, baiting the town for Kane to be found
That's slipping
If there ain't a blitz between the clique
That's slipping
No whip, out the manor linking chicks?
That's slipping, that's slipping
[Chorus]
If you see me and I ain't with my crew
Believe I'm on my P's and Q's
Even on my own two
That's the difference between me and you
If you see me and I ain't with my crew
Believe I'm on my P's and Q's
Even on my own two
That's the difference between me and you"

I could tell a rider when I spot em, so tell me what's on your mind,""
Told her, ""where do I start?""
Said, ""I don't even know you,""
Than I started spillin my heart
Somebody gimme a spark
I'm feeling empty and dark
Said, ""I just made a mistake
And it's about to rip me apart
Man, I cheated on my baby and I broke up my cribs
Somebody told what I did
She looked up and woke up my kids
Left a note on the mirror,""
""You'll never know where we live
And if you ever go to court
Nigga you know what it is""
Yea, pushed drugs for a living
""You know how that custody works
Before they give you our children
They'll put you in custody first,""
That's the hustlers curse
I'm getting fucked in reverse
I know that women is hurt
I wonder what's in her purse
How she feedin my kids
Every second she gone
Got me checkin my phone
Should have left them heffers alone
Now my best friend is gone
And I just needed to think

Drown our pain in our drinks man

Did a precnancy test
Was it pregnancy? yes

I'm scared of him now,""
She said, ""my character's foul
I'm not bearin his child
And I'm steadily stressed
He think it's his and he love it
He's pulin out books
Readin stories to my stomach
Wish I wasn't creepin on my man but I done it
He wasn't makin me feel wanted
To keep it one hundred
He used to bring me flowers
Sing me songs in the shower
Before I got pregnant we used to argue every hour
Now our house is a love nest
So I gotta confess
I don't want my future decided by a blood test""

Wash It Down,K'naan,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","When you here in the water
You feel like it's sorta
Releasin' the tension distress and disorder
Is big in America
Stephanie Erica, both of them suffer from livin' in here
Because
Livin' is very competitive:
Hasslin' creditors, hazardous accidents
Drivin' with negligence
Too many beverages
People got too may things on they lettuces
TV's deadliest professin' the ugliest war, war, war, WAR
What the hell you keep on killin me for?
Please come over and bend down low
Let me tell you what little I know
And if it's worth somethin'
Spread it indeed like shit and vomit that's under your feet

I was born in a pot boilin' black and hot
Waitin' to be tasted and rappin' a lot
But justice would not come and eat my flesh -
Instead, I had poverty to feed my stress
Until my life became an ode to the gun -
Not needed, like a overcoat to the sun
So, I thought I was just made to exist;
Not to live or change and resist
But fear will have you believin' fear -
Paralyzed have you bleedin' tears
This is the therapy needed, so use it
Music is water; you know what my proof is? (What?)
People need music like they need excuses (Ha)
People need water like Kanye needs Jesus
So wash it down (wash it down)
Wash it down (wash it down)(x7)
*gradually fades, continues in background*

(Spoken) I know you stressin': this is a little meditation for you to relax
And jump in the pool, and, you know, sink and sink!

Drink on water
Live on water
Die for water"

Nigga, I'm from New York, New York
I got a semi-automatic that spits
Next time if you talk, you talk

Y'all niggas is pussy, punani, vagina
Your monologue's getting tired, now it's time to ride
Apprentice, you fired, you're no longer desired
So take off them silly chains, put back on your wire
I'm on fire; Harley dipped in octane
Let East Coast bang, let West Coast bang
And Rule gon' bring the ghetto gospel (Ooh!)
To every hood possible, pushing through in the sky blue
Back with the Gods, you now, preferably the four pound
Slugs flying at the speed of sound
Tryna catch the ears of niggas that's running they mouths
I might get my Brooklyn niggas to run in your house
I don't really understand what the running's about
But we hunters, we take pride in airing our prey out
Leaving 'em laid out dead in just a sport
'Cause we ain't playing up here in New York

Nigga, I can see the coke in your nose
This ain't a movie, even he got his head blown on the globe
And I was just about to find God
But now that Ma$e is back, I think I'd much rather find a ménage
And everybody talking crazy how they AK spit
But we done did some 'vestigating and they ain't spray shit
Not me, I'm the truth, homie, got the industry shook
Like, ""Naw, nigga, Joe gon' let 'em loose on me""
True story, I'm bringing the T back
Even Roy Jones was forced to lean back (Lean back)
My nigga Dre said, ""grind, Cook"", now we killing them hard

Got bitches on top of the Phantom
And the pinky got bling like the ring around Saturn

It's guaranteed you gon' die, you might get missed

And that coke will get you a long time
But when I let 'em know the dope is out, it's like America Online
Wise has awoken, and you know they say that you deserved it
Whenever you die with your eyes open
I still hold the title
'Cause I'm in the hood like them little motorcycles
Stick up kids hoppin' out with them old rifles
Just doing shit for nothin', it's so spiteful, ha, I'm just like you
Word that niggas wanna murk you is in the air
A double shot of 'gnac and the purple is in the air
And I'm not cocky, I'm confident
So when you tell me I'm the best it's a compliment
Ha-heh!

Talkin to Myself,Crooked I,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Crooked I]
{shout-outs}

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
Let me take you to the…hood, nigga
Where we all under stress
Thugs die a bloody death
That’s nothing on the West
Got a package from my enemies, inside it was a vest
The note attached to it said “We ain’t aimin’ at ya chest”
In the… hood, nigga
Show you what danger is about
Cameras filming every angle of my house
Gotta send gang-bangers with my spouse
Niggas aimin’ at her blouse
Trying to change her into an angel in the clouds
Pow-pow in the… hood, nigga
Fuck with me I go gorilla
Talk to ‘em Kobe Killer
(I guess I keep talkin’ to Myself)
The whole circle gotta eat, watch us set the table
‘Cause these record labels
They ain’t never stable
My connect in Diego
Hit me with 100 pounds, I don’t mess with ya-yo
Gotta respect my game though
Polygraph Crooked spittin’ in the booth
Other rappers spittin’ them writtens, I’m givin’ you the truth
I’m a… hood nigga, only here to stack millions
Even though I come from the home of the crack children
See I’m a genius, I’m crazy as Katt Williams
Busy as a beaver ‘cause I’m in the damn building
This is the portrait of a poor kid
Going from moving weight like a forklift to corporate
Fertilize our mindstate, might make you forfeit
Thinkin’ that the grass is greener, but it’s only horseshit
Hood nigga!
Late at night, that’s me in the mirror
Saying “Crooked they don’t hear ya”
(I guess I keep talkin’ to myself) Yeah
Damn, I hate to sound like a broken record
But for 52 weeks in a row I broke a record
Check it, raping the game is my code of ethics
Kids better watch their ass like the pope is naked
Fuck it, I’m going the distance, persistence
C.O.B.: We the resistance, for instance
Let’s make a toast to ourselves for the way we conquered poverty
By moving this marijuana properly
Trying to acquire private property, not Monopoly
Ain’t no get outta jail free if them coppers stoppin’ me
They got orders from the top to lick a shot
And leave a nigga’ body rottin’ if I stop pickin’ cotton
As if punchin’ a clock is an option to a drop-out nigga
Livin’ in a market that they not givin’ jobs in
Us ghetto niggas we been beggin’ for some help
I guess we talkin’ to ourselves, huh?
(I guess I keep talkin’ to myself)
And I’m too enterprising to take orders
From a caveman who expect me to slave for eight quarters
In a quarter to eight, I bang corners
Doing tricks in whips like skateboarders
I’m a motherfuckin'... hood nigga
I remember times was hella hard
Gun and a ski-mask played the role of a debit card
’86: from the mall I was forever barred
For boosting them Avirex leathers, God
I never sparred, every day was a fist fight
A Outlaw like E.D.I., livin’ the Thug Life like Big Syke
Sometimes I think I shouldn’t carry a ratchet
For burying enemies when we couldn’t bury the hatchet
Puttin’ snitches in the cemetery is tragic
But we all about loyalty, like Cookie Johnson staying married to Magic!
I wear this pinkie ring for a reason
It ain’t to market an image or hit certain targets with gimmicks
C.O.B. across my arm, it’s authentic
Realest army invented
Call me a general, and all my lieutenants salute
#OKBYE"

It's your trainer, Money Mayweather
Tell them other MC's to put their motherfuckin mics down

Dedication, hard work, prayers and belief
And a good team {*ding ding*}

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Yeah, back up on that ass (yeah)
Back to put rappers on one knee like they 'bout to run 100 meter dash
Bow down to greatness
Before I get pissed and run up in the stands like the Indiana Pacers
Covered all my bases, straight, no chasers
Diamonds on my chain look like my neck's full of glaciers
Titanic flow (what?) Titanic dough (what?)
Women on my nuts like, ""Where the Titanic go?!""
I been scourin the Earth (yeah)
Makin my fans catch the holy ghost at my shows like ya grandma at church
And the fat lady's singin - it's over for you rappers
Can't none of y'all bust, you're just sacs full of semen
And I got the women screamin (AHHH!)
They could catch my balls on Any Given Sunday like my name's Willie Beamen
Or LL Cool - so if your boyfriend
Thinks you loyal to his ass then he's a motherfuckin fool
Got jewels on my pinky, jewels on my wrist (hey!)
Iconic status and his name is Ludacris
Bitch please! You messin with some real O.G.'s
With million dollar whips that I ship from overseas
Got a pocket full of G's - and the inconvenient truth
Is that the ozone is bad cause I been smokin' all the trees
The globe is warmin up when we fire up the blunt
And put it in the air like Evel Knievel stunts
What you want from me? (what?) I got pistols for the haters
Your fam'll be in black like they was playin for the Raiders
And your music isn't favored - and DJ's they NEVER bring it back
Like when you go and borrow somethin from your neighbors
Like a cup full of sugar, a rope full of salt
The name of my car insurance is ""YO' FUCKIN FAULT!""
And if you sittin' on chrome - I'll call up my boys
And have you stripped of yo' metals like Marion Jones, nigga

Champ you got it! Keep on movin
They ain't got nothin on you, watch for the sneak dissin

Bring it, take some water
This is Money in the bank! (yeah)
They defeatin themselves, champ (yeah baby)
You know what you can do (I know)

You know what it is man (aight let's go)

Yeah, back up on the scene (what?)
Back to put a nail in these rappers' coffins
I got the hammer in my jeans: call me Mr. Fix It
Barrel stay hotter than
A fresh batch of homemade buttermilk biscuits
A-tisket, a-tasket, a custom-made casket
Luda leaves intruders stretched out like gymnastics
And acrobatics; I'm superstar status
The mouth of the South like Gangsta Grillz you bastards!
The international traveler
And I may not be much to you, but I'm the SHIT out in Africa
So put ya fist up - even the Statue of Liberty
Lit a flame for the way that I lit my wrist up
You can't compete with me - I got 'em stuck
Like I made a thousand rappers put shackles on they feet with me
And then I broke free - I'll let 'em loose
When Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston become drug-free
I'm the baddest mother-shut-it like Shaft was
Leavin' rappers with headaches like bad drugs
They shoulda warned ya - you got defeated
By the Heat, but ehh, we'll just say we Alonzo Mourn'd ya
So call the coroner (hey!)
I'll show up to yo' funeral with some gators like I'm FRESH outta Florida
Call me The Swamp Thang - y'all headed in the wrong direction
Like you hit the subway and caught the wrong train
So don't fuck with it - I'm sendin' lyrical bullets
Right at yo' dome, fuck niggas better duck with it (duck wit it!)
Or else you stuck with it - you'll get stomped so bad
You'll leave the scene thinkin eight Young Buck's did it
But not in Ca$hville - you lost yo' feelin
Like comin' down off X, chasin' effects of yo last pill (ha ha)
You fuckin' Daffodil, you's a Daffy Duck (what?)
And I'm the undefeated champ, y'all niggas suck!

First LP, on the same shelf as the veterans
Nigga I can't be fucked, like a lesbian

Close both of your eyes and hope that you don't crash

Roll the fuckin' windows down, let the bass out
Niggas, drop the top on whatever you in
Bitches, let your ponytail blow in the wind
Inhale the chronic, blow out dollar signs
Nigga you can drive a Bentley if only in your mind
Four doors, leather and wood
Ride like I got a horse stable under my hood

Place That Birthed Me,Soul Khan,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
It's like: straight from the city of sunshine and silicone
Even on the busiest streets, you still feel alone
Unless you're repping a set or set to direct
A mill or millimeter's how they measure respect

They say the weather is best, but sometimes it rains and
Sometimes it bleeds cause drugs line the veins of
All kinds of fiends, they all got the need
In the hills and the ghetto and what lies between

Got one life to lead, but two different faces
Prime real estate for the youthful and famous
Too many cops are abusive and racist
But white folks still staying glued to the matrix

Chicks drop stacks for rags on rodeo
Then they hit the strip to sniff some more yayo
Dudes on the street sipping forties like they're Drano
The city where the angel pawned his own halo
[Hook]
Let's take a trip to the place that birthed me
Home of Roscoe's and big game worthy
Los Angeles, I can't love it enough
So no matter where I'm at, I put my w's up

[Verse 2]
Now, I could spit a reference to different intersections
But that wouldn't capture California in its essence
The asphalt is scalding beneath your chucks
Wherever we post up, there's burrito trucks

And the traffic in the city turns the corner to a jukebox
Bumping ever genre from Foreigner to 2Pac
Peace to the homie selling oranges a few blocks
Up, now he's got a small fortune in his tubesocks

It's where I learned to freestyle with ease and fluency
Used to hear people preach peace and unity
The women were an infinite spectrum of thickness
And greeted every increase in heat with nudity

Now I'm in the east with a dream and a tunnel vision
You gotta leave home to see home for what it isn't
So some day, I'll return like the sun arisen
And on my mama's mama, I hope that nothing's different

So hold up, nigga, stop me, all these haters watch me

White bitches, white girls, white drugs
Black girls don't do it but my type does
Fuck it in my white van, beat her with a nice white nightstand
Until I give her gashes where it's nothin' but the white meat
E-T-I-H, W's, double D's on her knees
White gargle yellow fuckin' bumblebees
Use whitey's as my dinner course for intercourse
So much fuckin' white make Darth Vader have a thinner force
But of course, I'm the white boy that shows no remorse
Pull up on a stark with enough white to kill a horse
Blacc Friday, fuck a Nigga Friday, umm
Wolf Gang make a white pregnant bitch wan' abort
Bring the remainin' red and white pieces to the fort
Odd Future, there wolves bang where a couple bears hang
With a white box logo with a couple stains
From a black creampie in a whitey, make it light gray

[Verse 2]
Oh wow, Obilivion stump
I do not know how that dead body got inside of my trunk
What the fuck? Gee Willikers and no, I'm not drunk
I coulda sworn that Budweiser can read fruit punch
Let you sip casually when you tryna lose calories
I'm not a murderer, this occurance that isn't happenin'
Is sporadically damagin' my reputation
See I'm a good guy but when I see dead casualties
My penis gets erected and nipples are such aroused
And the blouses of these bitches always end up in my house
And three hours in the showers with the corpse
I've ejaculated enough semen to sink a boat what, umm
Riley's body's entirely covered and tied up
From my desire, now look at the fuckin' irony
I killed my manager with an iron
All because the bitch finally decided to fire me
Back at Travis' house even though that faggot admires me
All because I heard that he was talkin' to Danielle
So now that I finally made that fags head handheld
He can finally help me masturbate and read fan mail (no homo)
First letter says motherfucker you're dead
The king of comedy heard everythin' that you said
And Just in Time your head is mine
You crossed the fuckin' line like them dirty Mexicans
Second letter reads: ""Hey son, it's me""
Fuck you, I'm a subject without my permission
Third letter quote hey Ace I'm addicted to coke
Wanna ask how I been so?
I make songs about shit for attention
Put them out randomly hopin' that I get some
I got problems in my head that I want, no
But I don't trust anybody, yeah no one
Savin' up 24 bullets with gun
Cause I got demons that I cannot let out, umm
Hopefully the next album can help me out
Cause I'm now, livin' this life with foolproof doubts
So, I just need someone to talk to, kinda rushed
But nobody gives a fuck, fuck it, signed anonymous"

It's so beyond rap, cock sucker we live this
So um, come on baby, come on, come on and witness
The next ten years of this shit, the slickness is deliberate
Lyrically it's as sick as it get
I been in the pen, been in the jects, been in the inter taps
I been in the Benz, been in the Lex, been in the M.S.X
Yes, I run ringers around the fraudulent type
Come here and I'll show you that I spit on just more than a mic
I make it hard for niggas to breathe, please
These wicked emcees squeeze
Hammers like the Pampers used to squeeze, hit the D.T
I Mike Tyson ya eye, put a permanent ring around it
Then go run in the booth and sing about it
Look, if I don't hurt the nigga that play with my wealth
I'm like me on Entourage god, I'm playing myself, let's go

When internets ask who's the best, why won't you say me?
Don't you hate me? C'mon baby, wasn't all gravy
I took my lumps comin up just like a boxer baby
My first style - hmm, maybe if I stuttered, maybe
But then I slowed it down, brought it from the gutter baby
Matter fact, I don't give a FUCK where you rate me
Record labels told me, ""No"" - guess what the fuck they made me?!
Super rich! Stupid bitches know I'm super vicious
Like, standin over a wounded man wit, two biscuits
Let's get it clear like eucalyptus, if you conflicted
My flow is like the Cuban Missile Crisis
Nigga, my near misses are crisis
I hide a couple rare jewels in a verse
For my niggas that like to listen like this
Hahahaha - you gotta let it do what it do, baby
C'MON!

Four finger, three finger, two finger, one finger
Humdinger, gun slinger, that's what I am
I spit it slick as the shit that's in a Crisco can
So you should, c'mon baby, c'mon c'mon and get witcha man
Got the rap shit down to a chemistry
Lotta fakes in the industry, but I don't let them get to me
I rock for my brothers that's locked in the penitentiary
Me, Jay and Swizzy got the ""Symphony of the Century""
Roc-A-Fella, Fort Knox, fucker ya heard that!
I don't know where you be, but see I be where the birds at
She ask me buy her a drink, I get her some 'gnac
Then it's, c'mon baby, c'mon c'mon let's merk to the back
And way before my contract, I had hoes
Rappers claim that they had broads, but I doubt that they was bad broads
I'm feelin disrespected

The Greatest Story Never Told,Saigon,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Saigon]

It's the greatest story, ever ever told

I'mma let y'all muh'fuckers know somethin man
Change the game, it's a promise man
Dun-dun, let me get into this shit man
Let me remember who I be
{*scratched*: ""It's time for America to hear THE TRUTH!""}

[Saigon]
Check, the attribute is God be
Lord Supreme Allah helper to another God in need, indeed
I feed off a lot of the bullshit that tends to succeed
I was waitin, Just went and took a minute to breathe
Even squeezed off a +Warning Shot+
Moose-Knuckle to Brownsville, they impatiently waitin for your boy to drop
Lo and behold, ""Greatest Story Never Told""
Chapter 1, Verse 1, the genesis of my scroll
It's realer than 9/11, I rhyme about lyin reverends
While showin no total respect to the big guy in Heaven
I rap about politicians how money's their acquisition
To get it they gotta keep us without a pot to piss in
Strugglin to survive, 9-to-5 ain't makin it
Turn on the TV all I see is celebs cakin it
Feelin like they got all the bread but they ain't breakin it
I'm takin it, soon as I find the oven where they bakin it

Whoa (the greatest story never told)

Check it, check
We was brought here to pick the cotton
Now we pickin the music that massa listen to, the clothes in which he rockin
We don't drive a hard bargain
All we want back is crack, some more gats and some more of that bullshit rap
The crime rhyme is still black on black
And we need a leader like me to get us back on track
When y'all make them diss records do you know what you doin to black community?
Market and promote the fact that we lack unity
Them white people look at you and laugh
You look like a porch monkey boy dancin for cash
Wanna get on a record and talk trash
See him at the awards and don't do shit but walk past
And that, that's somethin we call CRASH
Coward Rappers Actin So Hard, when they really just all ass
Abondoned Nation on the warpath
And then we gotta bring some heat out cause we changin the forecast

Look, once again in the beginnin I was sinnin
Now I'm in the ninth innin of the game of life, grinnin cause I'm winnin
I'll teach you how to rhyme, y'all only know how to riddle
Or peep the government wan' do me like Malcolm Little
They say that I'm a threat to the society
Since I put my thinkin cap on and stop lettin them fuckers lie to me
You gotta take it back to face the fact
These D's look at us as just another case of crack
If I bust a gun in the hood I get Attica or the cat
I bang a gat in Iraq I get a pat on the back
Best believe I know better than that
This a lesson for all my listeners, this shit ain't just regular rap
It's the greatest story that ever been spat
It's gon' teach the hood and at the same time make my pockets elephant fat
Go 'head with all the irrelevant rap
Me and my nigga Just Blaze bring the true element back

So Nice,Laws,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
Let’s get right, I ain’t trying to struggle all my life
You used to talk like it would be so nice
But now I got mines and it feel so right
Let’s get right, trying to get my picket fence all white
Trying to have a drink that’s stiff, no ice
‘Cause I got mine and it feel so right

[Verse 1: Laws]
It’s game time, time to change minds, time to make mine a classic
See I got in the game, not writing the same rap
And in the process, I became an addict for that happy idiom
Between a shiny suit cat and the kid that’s backpacking
These other lames got on by accident
Now they record label trying to aflac the shit
Y’all ain’t show nothing new to me, just hip-hop like tomfoolery
Somebody asked which rookies are cool to me
One or two truthfully including me, no comparisons
Unless it’s on a bad day which I rarely have
And the big dogs telling me to compare the blast
But when I blow my fam, then I barely gas, they gonna be like…
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Laws]
Yeah, I know it’s kind of ignorant
But if I wasn’t arrogant, you wouldn’t give a shit
They trying to get me battle by who isn’t in
As if my music records have a million wins
If I do, will you compare me to Slim if I win?
Shut the fuck up, go and remix A Milli again
The people love it ‘cause I give them that feeling again
They run it back and they feel it again
So you know I’m right, haters bringing pebbles to a boulder fight
I’m a full house, you folding right?
If you took a seat, that would be so nice
I don’t overwrite, market people already know I’m tight
I could pull a woman with an overbite
When this shit drop, I’m gonna be so, so, so, so right

[Hook]

[Bridge: Jason Caesar]
Let’s get right, I ain’t trying struggle for all my life
Used to think it would be so nice so I got mine and it feel so right
Let’s get right, taking ladies, staying up all night
And what we want, we could have it twice
Now I got mine and it feel so right

I represent the H and the bottom of the map
And I was born and raised in the bottom of the trap
The number one rule is you gotta stay straped
Cause any given minute you can take that long nap
I roll with guerillas, dealers and the killers
Cause when I'm on stage that's the only fool feel us
Real Trill niggas, let me see your hands
But I do this for the streets
I ain't try'na make you dance
Roll solo I don't need no friends
Still flip that 'Lac

And Harlem throwing money

So haters don't be mad at me blame it on God

You say your man ain't fucking you right
You lonely and depressed need a Thug in your life
Well come on over here

Take you back to the crib and beat it all night
She say she love Thug cause Thugga beat it good
Her man pay them bills but Thugga keep it hood
And I ain't gotta say it that's already understood
I take you for a ride, you can slide on my wood
I pick her up and shake her up and down like dice
Sweet like cake make me wanna take a slice
I ain't try'na take advantage but take my advice
Take a break from the fakes, get a Thug in your life

How Ill,Jeru the Damaja,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Skills? Skills?
Listen, I got crazy skills
I’ma tell you like this
I’m so ill I snatch the food out the hungry lion’s mouth
Jog from Brooklyn to DC on I 95 south
Without getting fatigued I travel at light speed
Get shot with a bazooka, dog can barely bleed
I can touch a lightning bolt, and not get shocked
Put shots at the president and won’t get knocked no shittin’
Swim with the sharks and I ain’t never been bitten
Have Nelson Mandela quoting the shit that I’m spitting
Make one phone call I get pulled me apart
And another call I kick it with Osama Bin Laden
Have every lesbian chick, begging for dick
Make that nigga Al Sharpton cut off that old perm shit
Spit fire out my mouth like the mythical dragon
Own a unicorn horn; smoke the blunt with the leprechaun
Squash ghetto beef before the weapons are drawn
Bring lash back to life and put his black ass on
To get this ill takes practice
Nasty
I’m so ill I have mike Bloomberg cutting me checks
Pimps instruct they hoes to pay me for sex
I make extra chips teaching David Blaine tricks
NASA called my lab before they launch rocket ships
So ill, Jackie Chan calls me the black version
After finished rapping I’ma be a brain surgeon
I can see the planets clearly without a telescope
Went to Rome to rock so they try to make me the Pope
I have Oprah in the crib posing for exotic flicks
Take a trip to Fort Knox and pick up like 80 bricks
Free all of the wrongfully imprisoned people out of jail
And when I’m finished with Oprah ill snap flicks of Gail
Ill rip the mic all night without taking a breath
Swim the Atlantic Ocean without taking a rest
Or getting wet
I always win so gamblers place your bets
I’m taking MC’s to Maury for maternity tests
To get this Ill takes practice
And it goes like this
I’m so ill they model computer chips after my brain
When a county in drought they call the kids for rain
Bring peace to the Gaza strip cause I got so much clout
Mario owe me dough for knocking Donkey Kong out
Wolfgang Puck gave me paper to teach me to cook
JK Rowlings asked me to write the next harry potter book
I can feed a million people with my peacea and jada
Darth Vader don’t really know I’m Luke Skywalker father
I spend my down time writing scripts for Scorsese
When I blow shit up I make the terrorists hate me
I’ma probably end up living until I’m one hundred and eighty
My stamina so legendary, wonder women trying to date me
My touch cures the sick, like an antibiotic
Slap up Steve Austin, and short out his bionics
Rap to a point just like a navy seal gunner
I’m taking shit over this summer and every summer
To get this Ill takes practice.."
Villain,Crooked I,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Crooked I]
There comes a time
In everybody's life
When they gotta make a change
I'm tired of being a villain
I'mma change

[Hook: Sally Anthony]
I'm not gon' be your villain anymore
And don't think I’ll live a life of keeping score
I'm not gon' be your villain anymore
And don't think I’ll live a life of keeping score
I'm not gon' be

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
Flat broke, living in the hood
When I need money I be up to no good
Your family's rich, my family's poor
I would trade places with you if I could
But I gotta play with the cards I was dealt
Down on my knees ask God for some help
Man of the house, my dad walked out
Mistakes get made when you father yourself
I was raised on the block, a menace to society
But as a little kid I was innocent entirely
Time went by, life got hard
'Til I started feeling like a villain was inside of me
Mad at the world, but I can't cry
Heart full of pain, and I can't lie
I did a lot of dirt, but now I wanna change
To the bad guy in me I say ""bye""
[Hook: Sally Anthony & (Crooked I)]
I'm not gon' be your villain anymore
And don't think I’ll live a life of keeping score
I'm not gon' be your villain anymore (I don't wanna be the villain no more)
And don't think I’ll live a life of keeping score (Hey!... Hey!... no more)
I'm not gon' be

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
I don't wanna be the villain no more
Inside my mind fighting my own war
Half of me wants to be the good guy
But the other half wants to kick down your door
Mixed emotions, they start to confuse me
Last night I hopped in my car with an Uzi
Haters don't feel me, some wanna kill me
I don't really wanna be the star of this movie
Too many years I done fought off regret
I'mma bail like Christian and walk off the set
You can tell the director, and the producer
To keep that noose when it fall off my neck
I was hanging myself: I couldn't breathe
Trapped in the ghetto: I couldn't leave
I couldn't think, I couldn't see
I couldn't take it man, I couldn't be
Guess I thought it was nothing else out there
For a dropout raised on welfare
Brave enough to rob a bank in a heartbeat
But too scared to take my life elsewhere
It ain't easy to go straight
Blind faith, stepped to the plate
I packed up my bag, I walked out the door
I ain't coming back around this bitch 'til I'm great
[Hook: Sally Anthony & (Crooked I)]
I'm not gon' be your villain anymore (I don't wanna be the villain no more)
And don't think I’ll live a life of keeping score (Hey!... Hey!... no more)
I'm not gon' be your villain anymore (I don't wanna be the villain no more)
And don't think I’ll live a life of keeping score (no more)
I'm not gon' be

[Bridge: Crooked I]
Put your hands in the air if you feel me
I'mma change my life if it kill me (Ho!... Ho!)
Put your hands in the air if you feel me (Hey!... Hey!)
I'mma change my life if it kill me
Put your hands in the air if you feel me (Hey!... Hey!)
I'mma change my life if it kill me
Put your hands in the air if you feel me (Hey!... Hey!)
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be

[Verse 1]
Here's how it started out, one day my father's out
And he never came back, 7 kids in my Mama's house
So now we drama'd out, money wise we caught a drought
Get that green paper ""by any means"", now that's what I'm about
And here's another reason, it’s not the summer season
Ain't no utilities on in my house, my Little Brother’s freezin’
How can I hustle sleepin, late night to the cud I’m creeping
I can hear that money breathing, I leave you busta’s leaking
Them streets were under handed, too young to understand it
It makes my nerves bad, thug’in as the youngest bandit
But I couldn’t run or panic, I had to man up
I wanted to go to college, poverty fucked my plans up
I wanted to be a scholar, how I end up in handcuffs
Every night my Mama’s cryin’, but I gots to stand tough
Look at me I’m waving pistols, gimmie every thing he got, I’m screaming
15 and I’m on a mission, God help me get away from these demons, please
[Chorus]
This is my life man, you say you understand
You claim you feelin’ my pain, but you really don’t give a damn
You see me in them streets, no lyin’ on these beats
I speak the truth in the booth, man Im’a tell you who I am
This is my life man, you say you understand
You claim you feelin’ my pain, but you really don’t give a damn
You see me in them streets, no lyin’ on these beats
I speak the truth in the booth, man Im’a tell you who I am

[Verse 2]
15 and I’m on a mission, God help me get away from these demons
They block my righteous vision, I can see them even when I’m dreamin’
Wish we wasn’t caused to struggle, wish we wasn’t all in trouble
Wish we’d get past all the mysteries, wish we could solve the puzzle
People don’t understand me, I got to help my family
My focus is uncanny, what cards will the future hand me
Enemies wouldn't care to twist me, gun shots and they barely missed me
When you thug’in out there it’s risky, but the man upstairs was with me
I lost so many homies, some even burned alive
We all been part of this sick war before we learned to drive
Only thing you hear’in both ears is that word ‘survive’
‘Cuz when you leave home with you chrome you want to return alive
What kind of person am I, growin’ up in this savage ‘hood
Wish I was average man, Crooked is damaged goods
My past is not the best, it’s bad and I confess
But I gotta make it since so many depend on my success, yes
[Chorus]
This is my life man, you say you understand
You claim you feelin’ my pain, but you really don’t give a damn
You see me in them streets, no lyin’ on these beats
I speak the truth in the booth, man Im’a tell you who I am
This is my life man, you say you understand
You claim you feelin’ my pain, but you really don’t give a damn
You see me in them streets, no lyin’ on these beats
I speak the truth in the booth, man Im’a tell you who I am

This is my life man it’s much more than music homie
It’s therapy
This is a young man’s medicine right here
This is my life homie

You can hear the insecurity in my voice right
I don't take my chain off on the mic
It's my security piece
It gives me security(security)
I'm waiting for the ghetto to secure me
I just put away thirty percent for my taxes
Twenty for the feds, the rest under my mattress
I gave my wallet a botox injection
A bunch 'a rude boyz in'a your section
Tryna give my tax bracket an erection
A seventies entity girl look at my complexion
If you can smell my cologne you're too close
You small time I net what you made gross

'Cuz the roof's on and off like they in and out of their minds
Eggshell pale teeter totter on the scale
The 09s is out and I ain't waiting on a deal
So same time the mothafuckers bargaining and lawyering
That coke money just keep pouring in and pouring in
Quarter milli bling-bling, that's the price of fame lame
I should have a title and a deed on the chain man
Re-up Gang; pyrex over pyro
Stir it till it's hard, pop it out, let it dry slow

See me in the coupe hot damn it's a new day
I remove the roof as if it's a toupee
To shed light on the jewels, Glue on blu-ray
High definition, I get cash
Two-twenty on the dash and the self start ignition
Tola don't love me but she keep insisting
Brain so good it's hard to keep my distance
Red carpet entrance play clothes fashion
Nose in the air I smell the Chanel Platinum
Re-Up is the gang, I rep with a passion
Till the wheels fall off and it all come crashing
Malice with Mr. Kardinal
Behind dark tint like we on the prowl
Nothing like money make a bitch loose her blouse
Well done hommie we rich, take a bow
