It's Charles now
Who's that too bad chick on his crown?
I meant mine, but I hit jaws when I'm around
So, in this talk, (get off the ground)
Anyway, 5-foot and an even digit
She told me her identity, I didn't even get it
She reminded me like (fool)
Kindly, she amused me
Like, fine, she's not a groupie
I'm not wack, though
She know the game's rules
But I don't claim jewels
I just be (lookin' like) cool
Niggas (lookin' like) fools
Meanwhile, I be lookin' bright
All the haters stay (lookin') tight
And she be lookin' like a Smurf, cool
Sonic and Smurfette, way too much blue
Stay cuttin' school
Took her on a date, yeah, we cruise
Barnes and Noble, wait for the news
She said she was datin' some dude
It must be because I gave her a break from the tool
I said, ""How you doin'?""
She said, ""Great, how are you?""
Didn't go that way, but it's cool
She knew she was with the
[Hook]

She had a coffee, I had a frappuccino
I was stuntin', told the cashier to crack a C-note
She was readin' some deep shit, I read manga
Eyes open for her, I can read danger
Like VH1 gave the bitch a book deal
Amazing shit, when you playin' with the good feelin'
She looks so good, not revealin'
Wish I had a whip, so I could pop the ceilin'
But I got nine cars, get it?
I been the underground Andretti for a minute
Did I have my Nikes on, or my Vans?
This song should make her dance
From her pants to her thong
Hopin' wifey don't cancel my bong
Fans get along when I jam to the horns
Holdin' hands like holdin' hands isn't wrong
Ladies wanna glance, I'm like, ""Damn, what's wrong?""
I'm just the

[Hook]

Blu knows
Next stop was Uno
Couldn't keep my hands off her, too close!
Like Dylan, she put a smile on
My face, with just sweats and no nylons
Wish she could call her friend, we get our tie on
But that's two left, and she's on my right arm
Goodnight, mom, it's time to bomb
Ha
Got the nine
And I'm 'bout to straight cock back and fire my arm
I don't know what I'm talkin' about, but I'm timin', so

Well, the crooks are out
And the streets are gray
You know I wouldn't have it
Any other way

Your mother's words
They're ringin' still
But your mother don't
Pay our bills

A sinister kid is a kid who
Runs to meet his maker
A drop dead sprint from the day he's born
Straight into his maker's arms
And that's me, that's me
The boy with the broken halo
That's me, that's me
The devil won't let me be

I got a tortured mind
And my blade is sharp
A bad combination
In the dark

If I kill a man
In the first degree
Baby would you
Flee with me?

A sinister kid is a kid who
Runs to meet his maker
A drop dead sprint from the day he's born
Straight into his maker's arms

Lemonworld,The National,"['rock', 'alternative', 'pop']","So happy I was invited
Gave me a reason to get out of the city
See you inside watching swarms on TV
Livin' and dyin' in New York, it means nothing to me

I gave my heart to the Army
The only sentimental thing I could think of
With cousins in colours and somewhere overseas
But it'll take a better war to kill a college man like me

I'm too tired to drive anywhere, anyway right now
Do you care if I stay?
You can put on your bathing suits
And I'll try to find somethin' on this thing that means nothin' enough

Losin' my breath, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Losin' my breath, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

This pricey stuff makes me dizzy
I guess I've always been a delicate man
Takes me a day to remember a day
I didn't mean to let it get so far out of hand

I was a comfortable kid
But I don't think about it much anymore
Lay me on the table, put flowers in my mouth
And we can say that we invented a summer lovin' torture party

I'm too tired to drive anywhere, anyway right now
Do you care if I stay?
You can put on your bathing suits
And I'll try to find something on this thing that means nothin' enough

1 Corinthians 15:55,Johnny Cash,['country'],"O Death, where is thy sting?
O Grave, where is thy victory?
O Life, you are a shining path
And hope springs eternal, just over the rise
When I see my redeemer beckoning me

Oh row my ship over the waves of your sea
Let me find a safe port now and then
Don't let the dark one in your sanctuary
Until it's time to pack it in

O, row, row my ship
With the fire of your breath
And don't lay a broadside on your ship as yet
Blow ye warm winds
When it's chilly and wet
And don't come to soon yet
For collecting my debt

O Death, where is thy sting?
O Grave, where is thy victory?
O Life, you are a shining path
And hope springs eternal, just over the rise
When I see my redeemer beckoning me
Oh let me sail on
With my ship to the East
And keep my eye on the North Star
When the journey is no good for man or for beast
I'll be safe wherever you are

Just let me sail into your harbor of lights
And there and forever to cast out my line
Give me my task
And let me do it right
And do it with all of my might"
Ill Buss Em U Punish Em,Canibus,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Canibus]
Yeah, I'll buss 'em and you punish 'em

Ra, let me buss 'em (Nah, I'ma punish 'em)
Nah, let me buss 'em (Nah, I'ma punish 'em)
C'mon Ra, let me buss 'em (Yo 'Bis, you can punish 'em)

[Verse 1: Canibus]
Yo, yo, now on some battlin' shit, my verbal lateral grip
Keeps my tongue glued to the ADAT when I'm trackin' my shit
Let my spit lubricate the chap on my lips
And make you rappers have fits 'cause I'm back in the mix
Fuck a pad and a pen, write rhymes on a IBM
Ebonics is dead, the binary language is in
Canibus practices in a room with a thousand candles lit
Meditatin' on this rap shit
Because my freestyle reigns sovereign with a deeper conscience
Than the prophet Muhammad was born with
My brain cavity is enormous
My left hemisphere alone harnesses all of the seven chakras
While the right one harnesses darkness
The type of dark that makes a house haunted
The type of dark that niggas get lost in
The type of dark you fear when you dead in the coffin
I hear you talkin', but I ignore it
'Cause it's garbage and your rhyme's boring
So keep standin' on the corner
The trash man'll collect you in the morning
Thug cats frontin', wacker than Blinky Blink
On the back of the Raptor Wagon babblin' about nothin'
Fuck that, real Rugrats can get it on, black
Meet me at The Tunnel where pussy niggas get mugged at
So dark, you'll never see the blood splat
And you can't even react
'Cause the trunk is where you keep the guns at
Now you on speed 'cause you too scared to come back
You can't even breathe, the weed suffocates your lung sacs
Fake MCs haul ass like they runnin' track
Where ever Canibus or Rakim is at, what the fuck?

[Verse 2: Rakim]
Be ready and at your best, the Celebrity Match of Death
Heart snatched through your chest, cardiac arrest
Crack your neck while I break your arms, catch your breath
Then I ask the ref, ""How many cats is left?""
One-on-one, who challengin'? Come get did
All I have is a pen and punishin' kids
Abdomen punctured in, look what I done to his wig
Wanna live? Then I stab 'em in the lung with his rib
Every word I say detach a vertebrae from your spine
Rematch wherever we meet at, any place, any time
Get your snot-box smashed with a nine, smacked with a rhyme
Push your forehead to the back of your mind
Try to explain, what it's like seein' your brain
You insane, who's gonna ID the remains?
And then I reincarnate 'em, and kill 'em again
Again and again, again and again, c'mon

[Verse 3: Canibus & Rakim]
Yo, yo, yo, he started the battle with a grapple
The nigga had long hair so I grabbed a handful
And chopped him in the Adam's apple
His partner in back of you tried to attack you
So I'mma twist 'em up like a pretzel then I'mma tag you
I'm on some Stone Cold shit, warn your whole clique
Cartilage get torn until the whole bone split
Who wanna spit? Bang 'em quick, strangle 'em wit' his lip
Try to flip, leave his body danglin' by his hip
Ra, you left him danglin', I can't believe he tryna grapple again
I swing him around like I'm dancin' with him
Put his arms in back of his head and snapped him again
Fractured his limbs and put him in the figure 6 subtracted from 10
Seven birds make 'em swerve 'til they vision is blurred
Turn cats that souped from superb to nerds
Just say the word, I'll leave your DNA on the curb
And stick my dick in your ear and fuck what you heard
[Outro: Canibus & Rakim]
Let me finish 'em (Nah, it's time to pin 'em)
Ra, let me finish 'em (Nah, I'ma pin 'em)
Nah, let me finish 'em (Nah, it's time to pin 'em)

Talkin Bear Mountain Picnic Massacre Blues,Bob Dylan,['rock'],"[Verse 1]
Well, I saw it advertised one day
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way
""Come along and take a trip
We'll bring you up there on a ship
Bring the wife and family
Bring the whole kids""
Yippee

[Verse 2]
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
To this thing called the Bear Mountain picnic
Little did I realize
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise
Had nothing to do with picnic
Didn't come close to a mountain
And I hate bears

[Verse 3]
Took the wife and kids down to the pier
There was six thousand people there
Everybody had a ticket for the trip
""Oh well,"" I said ""it's a pretty big ship
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier""
[Verse 4]
Well, we all got on, and what do you think?
That big old boat started to sink
More people kept a-piling on
That old ship was a-going down
Funny way to start a picnic

[Verse 5]
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife
So many people, I never saw in my life
That old ship was sinking down in the water
There was six thousand people trying to kill each other
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming
Women a-yelling, men a-flying, fists a-flying
Paper flying, cops a-coming, me a-running
Maybe we just better call off the picnic

[Verse 6]
I got shoved down, got pushed around
All I remember was a moanin' sound
Don't remember one thing more
All I remember is waking up on the shore
My arms and legs were broken
My feet were splintered
My head was cracked
I couldn't walk
I couldn't talk, smell, feel
Couldn't see
Didn't know where I was
I was bald
Quite lucky to be alive though
[Verse 7]
Well, feeling like I just climbed out of my casket
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket
Took the wife and kids and started home
Wishing I'd never got up that mornin'

[Verse 8]
Now, I don't care just what you do
If you want a have a picnic, that's up to you
But don't tell me about it, I don't want to hear it
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit
Stay in my kitchen, have my own picnic
Have a picnic in the bathroom

[Verse 9]
Well, it don't seem to me quite so funny
What some people are going to do for money
There's a brand new gimmick every day
Just to take somebody's money away
I think we ought to take some of these people
And put them on a boat, send them up to Bear Mountain
For a picnic"
Angry World,Neil Young,"['rock', 'blues', 'jazz', 'r&b']","Some see life as a broken promise
Some see life as an endless fight
They think they live in the age of darkness
They think they live in the age of Light

It's an angry world
And everything is gonna be all right
Yeah it's an angry world
Yeah it's an angry world
Some see life as hope eternal
Some see life as a business plan

Some will go to hell's inferno
For screwing up their life in freedom land

It's an angry world
For the business man and the fisher man
It's an angry world
And no doubt everything will go as planned
Yeah it's an angry world
Yeah it's an angry world"

I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess (Whoa)
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a JAY-Z song was on
And a JAY-Z song was on
And a JAY-Z song was on

So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, ""Yeah""
Movin' my hips like, ""Yeah""
Got my hands up, they're playing my song
You know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. 
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.

Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's lookin' at me now
Like, ""Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?
She gotta be from out of town""
So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo

[Pre-Chorus]
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on

So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, ""Yeah""
Movin' my hips like, ""Yeah""
Got my hands up, they're playing my song
You know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. 
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.

Feel like hopping on a flight (On a flight)
Back to my hometown tonight (Town tonight)
Something stops me every time (Every time)
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright (Hey, hey)

So I put my hands up
They're playing my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, ""Yeah"" (N-n-n-noddin' my head)
Movin' my hips like, ""Yeah"" (Ooh, yeah)
Got my hands up, they're playing my song
You know I'm gonna be okay (Gonna be okay)
Yeah (Na-na, na-na), it's a party in the U.S.A. 
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. 
So I put my hands up

But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

You take what is yours and I'll take mine

And despite my growing fears

And see the world hanging upside down

Yaa I Get It,Shad,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
I get it

[Verse 1: Shad]
Maybe I'm not big because I don't blog or Twitter
Dawg, I'm bitter
I didn't happen on the flop, but I'll win it on the river
Longest winter got me seasoned, now I'm a non-beginner
Meaning not yet a veteran but nevertheless
Pick the drug or the rapper man, I'm better than Meth
Dope as Ether, either the drug or the Jay diss
I would say dope as reefer but that would be too basic
And overplayed, overslaved, won't complain though
The game's been good to a youngin' out of London so I'm grateful
Not just for the funding or for the fans
But for the chance to say something, it wasn't in the plans at first
It was sad days, halfway to graduation
Cap and black cape, making job applications
I hate the catchphrase ""Canadian rap sensation""
Shad K don't have chains, big as the Appalachians
But since the label put me out like ashtrays to smoke cats
I have gained some accolades and admiration
It's grown since then though that second album man was so old-school
Folks called it old Princeton
I'm still penny-pinching though it sold fine
Billfold gon' hold still as pigskin when it's field goal time, now
That being said it's still '09
And I still got a lot of credit I still owe 9
But they charge no interest, so I pay no interest
Meaning I pay no mind, If there ain't no fine, I'm fine
I hope I ain't boring y'all rapping bout rap
But the only thing I love more than rapping is napping
And I know nobody want to hear me rap about that
You want the underdog spazzing on the track
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Shad]
Well my name ain't Lil Wayne Gretzky
But y'all know better than to check me
In the game, I hold records like a Technic
Telling referees to peek at the press seats a sec please
Drop your gloves OJ, haha
I knock you into next week make you get teeth replaced
Can't use plates what you get to eat
Gives new meaning to tube steak
Like watching you breast feed Doomsday
Move on these squares like a chesspiece, I'm deadly
Even if you're Supernatural, I'm Craig G
Jesse James meets Jet Li, killing these fakes at break neck speed
I make your head steam like a pet peeve
Get your neck squeezed till the breath leaves
Got the finesse and the prestige
And more mack than 10 tech geeks dissing XP
Best in the league of vets like ex-marines
Highest pedigree, when I get the beat it's heredity
Genetic freak poetically
One-ten degree Memphis heat spitting steadily
Medically decapitate this rapper's face, still won't get ahead of me
I'm the best I'll ever be (Yeah!)
The cats out the bag, the new Shad's out
Now they spell it S.H.A.D.D. the way I spazz out
I don't bad mouth but I'll quickly
Put down the cat if he bit me like Roy's boy Siegfried
Welcome to the big leagues where they pitch heat
Still on a hit streak, my rapping's like batting .360
Hey Griffey, slow down, do something less cerebral
I ain't big enough yet
I gotta keep impressing people
I get it, guess it's a lesser evil, weapon's lethal as a Desert Eagle
Now my lethal weapon won, you don't get a sequel
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shad]
No eviction notice, still I'm homeless on a poet's mission
Not that I'm a fiend stealing bass like Otis Nixon
Living on the street now I'm living on the road consistent
Making fans multiply like a coefficient
Record sales, I'm making low comission but the vision's mine
They don't change my record like pitching a no decision
Guitar playing emcee, yeah I'm known for spitting
While I'm tapping on my fender like cars in a slow collision
The precision of my flows in terms of tone and diction
Is akin to that of the old masters of prose and fiction
So many sold their souls, my sole ambition's
To hold solace so calm and bright as a solar system
I'm from a soul tradition, heads think I'm going to prison
Cause I'm talking bout this rap sheet with the most conviction
The most commitment, no other pro is so proficient
The coldest spitting, Rakim north pole edition

Word up word up always look in the sky yo. (Yeah I always did that too yo). And
Ask why. Why it gotta be like this?

Why do we have to struggle?

Kila Bee rest in peace yo (Killa Bee
Rest in peace)

Word up (word up) ? Prayers ain't never end (prayer's ain't
Never end)
""Gotta get the cash gotta get the doe""

*Noreaga*

Yo I started out in Iraq the wrong route
More chickens to doubt more money to count
Yo my Swiss account with more cheese amount
It's still piling and still gettin' calls from the island
Still do the things I do when I was wildin'
Tryin' to go from penny loafers to mink sofas
Spend a week with dime chickens that's freaks
*Hook*
If you don't know (if you don't know)
Knowlegde is what makes thugs grow
Just stay on point cause you reep what you sew

*Noreaga*
Yo ass cheeks scream loud like car beeps
I wanna be under the seats in our streets
Last year around the time this year
If I would of got locked Yo
I wouldn't even care
But now I got this rap thing (what)
No more hustlin' at age ten my team played to win
We're here to succeed
Sonny carson nobody understanding
Yo the black struggle gotta hustle to hustle
And once you get muscle nobody trust you
Tryin' to be like Goldy in the Shaft days
These lasts days comin' up
Yo these little niggas comin' up
Get their gun tucked ready to buck
Not thinkin'
Black on black crime yo it's swine you're both stinkin'
Pretty Ake yo Shan and Mahdi
Yo its Papi, officially arab nazi
2-5-2 we regulate this what

""Gotta get the cash gotta get the doe""

Closer to this paper get closer to this paper (hella dope baby)
Get closer to these ends
""Gotta get the cash gotta get the doe""

*Noreaga*

Yo I remember when we first did it
Nobody with it
Label said 2-5 is too thugged out (to thugged out)
So although we had to but God wasn't glad to
Wait our turn to boil now we burn
On the daily done fuckin' in every telly
We can Fly just like R.Kelly
The moon is secondary to the sun
I think I gotta son but I ain't sure
What's in store, God there's more
Shortie says the kid mine knockin' at my door
Could it be? tryin' to be what I can be
Islami 2-5 my army
Said she about to have my seed
Soon to be it shocked me
Thinkin' bout a little me
Eternally I bleed thinkin' of seed yo at high speed
I multiply with weed
Now I slow my life down I got time to breathe What?

The Last Hope,Drake,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: Andreena Mills]
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope

[Verse 1: Kardinal Offishall]
Can you imagine the last breath of Christ?
The last breath of Christopher Wallace on that faithful night
The last step that Martin Luther took as a man
I got the power of my world in my hand
The Microphone brings life or death in the blink of an eye
I was born to provoke those born to die
I was conceived to beat all odds like Las Vegas
T-dot motherfucker, watch the world rape us
Greatest strugglers hustle to succeed
Cross water smugglers tussle to burn weed
It meets that pressure to success in the South
Niggas watching what I say magnifying my mouth
I never take back talk, I apply the force
Hand blistering from many years of holding the torch
When the skin rebuilds, it grows tougher than leather
So we can keep on hold it forever
My name's Kardinall
[Chorus: Andreena Mills]
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope

[Verse 2: Drake]
Jealousy is something I haven't felt in years
There's nobody around for me to be jealous of
I bet you do a show in my city and no one cheers
Even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love
Dawg, I'm incredible fuckin unforgettable, but when it comes to records I will eat it if it's edible
They say the futures always for-seen
That's why I'm steady getting more money more cream
My flow is stuck in the moment that comes before dreams
I stay avoiding unlucky like 14
And people get behind and they fight for em' cause he won't let no other niggas write for em'
And even when its quite warm, the attitude coursing through the veins and my city is an ice storm
The name's Drake and I don't take it for granted
I can take it you offended cause I'm taken advantage man

[Chorus: Andreena Mills]
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope"
Bullets In The Gun,Toby Keith,"['country', 'pop']","[Verse 1]
They used to call me lightning
I was always quick to strike
Had everything I own
In the saddles on my bike
I had a reputation
For never staying very long
Just like a wild and restless drifter
Like a cowboy in a song

[Verse 2]
I met a dark haired beauty
Where they lay the whiskey down
In southern Arizona
In a little border town
She had to dance for money
In that dusty old saloon
I dropped a dollar in the jukebox
Played that girl a tune, yea

[Chorus]
Never see it coming
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
That fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun
[Verse 3]
She was sitting on my lap
We still had shots to kill
When a man pulled up
Who owned the bar
In a Cadillac DeVille
He grabbed her by her raven hair
And threw her on the floor
Said no free rides for the cowboys
That ain't what I pay you for, no

[Verse 4]
She jumped up and grabbed my pistol
Stuck it in the fat man's back
Said open up the safe
And put your money in the sack
Then tied his hands behind him
And put a blindfold on his eyes
Said if you're dumb enough to chase us, man
You're dumb enough to die

[Chorus]
Never see it coming
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
That fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun, yeah
[Verse 5]
We rode across the border
Down into Mexico
When you're running from the law
Ain't that where everybody goes
We came to a town
With a name I could not spell
She gave me what I came for
In that Mexican motel

[Verse 6]
I woke up to sirens
And the sound of running feet
There were fifty Federales
Locked and loaded in the street
She grabbed my .44
I grabbed the money in the sack
She kissed me for the last time
And we headed out the back

[Bridge]
Every gun was on us
And every heartbeat pounded
There's only one thing left to do
When they got you all surrounded
She fired that old pistol
But we didn't stand a prayer
Money hit the gravel
Bullets filled the air
[Chorus]
Never see it coming
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
That fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun
Bullets in the gun
Bullets in the gun
Bullets in the gun"
Silver Bullet,Snibunny,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
When things are strange I make them stranger
Duplicating complexity defying Occam's Razor
And I'm sharper too
I cut the cold wind and slash the flu
Sever the tension with more spite to spew
Despite the few
People that can get a half a whoop-de-woo
Trying to figure out what I need to do
I'd sooner do a back flip than change my view
I'm straight-edged, razor blades *adieu*
Cause not by the hair on my chinny chin chin
Will it happen again
That I'm ever giving in
Gonna do what I got to do to win
Only way to stop's to reach the end
Squash my competitors
And bash in the editors
Pounce on them all like the predators
Man I'm just too dope
A lycanthrope
Well aware that my hands can choke
Your neck and throat
The moon is full now there's just no hope
[Hook]
They call me Vlad but
I'm a werewolf
They think I wear capes
But I just wear wool
They stab me with stakes
So I'll get whisked off
But it doesn't hurt much
I just get pissed off
As for the real deed
A silver bullet
Set in the chamber
The trigger pull it

[Verse 2]
Wanna put the silver bullet right between my eyes
Squeeze that triger win a Pulitzer prize
Then right when you go to pull it surprise
I leap into the air penetrating the skies
I'm in the ozone
And there is no zone
Safe to liaison
I carry the craze on
You're casting your gaze on
The symbol emblazoned
The long arm of the law
With jagged claws
Dropping the hammer with nails on the chalk
Bored of you all cause you're all talk
Just words on a black board
You're out of your gourd
Cut you down with a blazing sword
Just a typical bass turd
Floating in the water
Residual master, no body's hotter
Always on top no teet nor totter
It's plain to see
Saw blades always
Carve these hallways
Corridors each staircase
Crawlspace
Vicious Vortex rips all time space
Make the continuum flux when I flex
Quick ripped, I'm light-years from the next
I'm in another galaxy
To challenge me is a fallacy
Typically tame now I'm all full of malice, see?
At the lunar eclipse
Beast from the waist up, man down from the hips
[Hook]

[Verse 3]

Now the sun is up, I made it through last cycle
Clothes torn up, looking like a sad eyeful
Towers I climb up, still feeling mad spiteful
Ready for some punk to step up to my rifle
I'm just a lyrical marksman popping his marks
Razor fangs yield more bite than barks
Leaves blood stemming out like works of art
Poor little sap getting torn apart
Uprooting garnet red from the start
Just one shy of a baker's dozen
I got more karats than a rabbit grubbin'
Sharp as a diamond cutter
The simplest way to find my butter
In a Blue Bonnet
Cast with topaz on it
Heart black as Onyx
Frosty sapphire; stone cold
And the moss grows fat when I roll
Bread on my back, honey, wheat
Yeast
A no games beast
Self-rising like Hannibal
Corrupted cannibal
Man I'm nuts it's like emerald Isle
Digging up gold mines all the while
Stacking up these bricks in piles
Like Fort Knox
Over stocked
A stockpile the big shot
Slug from a Barrett
No matter the assault I can bare it
Your gunpowder I dare it
Send me all your full metal jackets
Of hot lead to my head
Cause if it isn't silver no blood I'll shed"
Mine,Taylor Swift,"['pop', 'country', 'rock', 'alternative', 'blues', 'jazz']","[Verse 1]
You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment, I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Verse 2]
Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
[Pre-Chorus 2]
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about:

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Bridge]
And I remember that fight, 2:30 A.M
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone.""
[Chorus 2]
You said, ""I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Do you believe it? (Hold on)
We're gonna make it now (Hold on)
And I can see it
Yeah, yeah
I can see it now (See it now)"
California English,Vampire Weekend,"['alternative', 'pop', 'rock', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Wouldn't ever gag you with a spoon, my only true love
Never really heard you speak that way, it's unworthy of
Funny how that little college girl called language corrupt
Funny how the other private schools had no Hapa Club
Someone took a trip before you came to ski in the Alps
Your father moved across the country just to sunburn his scalp
Contra Costa, Contra Mundum, contradict what I say
Living like the French Connection, but we'll die in LA

Blasted from a disconnected light switch
Through the condo that they'll never finish
Bounced across a Saudi satellite dish
And through your brain to California English

[Verse 2]
No one sits inside a freezing flat and stays there 'til May
Leafing through a stack of A-Zs to surf the UK
Waiting with the wind against your face and gel in your hair
Shivering in little undershirts, but don't seem to care

Blasted from a disconnected light switch
Through the condo that they'll never finish
Bounced across a Saudi satellite dish
And through your brain to California English

Sweet carob rice cake, she don't care how the sweets taste
Fake Philly cheese steak but she use real toothpaste
'Cause if that Tom's don't work, if it just makes you worse
Would you lose all of your faith in the good earth?
And if it's all a curse, and we're just getting worse
Baby, please don't lose your faith in the good earth

Blasted from a disconnected light switch
Through the condo that they'll never finish

Okay
Fuck it, I don't care
The appeal
When I fuckin' came to this fuckin' country
All I had was a dollar and a dream

[Verse 1]
We need more Rosé
My bitches gettin' thirsty
My words like New Years
Christmas came early
Got these bitches urling, my earring's perfect
My left pinky finger rollin' like George Gervin
My name ain't Ervin but call me Magic
Abra cadabra, top off the Phathom
458 Italia, first in the states
Out of town plates, just to make it look great
I need a haircut plus a carwash
I get out the car and they take their bra's off
See I fought the law and the fuckin' law won
Came back on appeal wanna new outcome
Overload your eardrums, hear it hear it come
Income income, go and get you sum
Say bye to the Bad guy
Wave bye to the Bad guy
Gucci Mane the bad guy
Yes, I am the Bad guy
Wave bye to the Bad guy
[Refrain]
I came to this country with a dollar and a dream
And a choppa and a team full of killas, what you mean
I'm a bad guy, bad guy from start til the end
Say hello to my little friend
I could've been a doctor, should've been a lawyer
I go to court so much I could've been my own employer
I'mma die a dope boy, always been a hustler
Started off custom now I say hello to my little friend

I got sixty racks layin' on the floor in Magic City
Like Samuel L Jackson I think it's time for killin'
I touched his wife titty and the nigga start trippin'
That ain't proper etiquette you see the bitch strippin'
AR-15 ripped his ass into pieces
Don't get it twisted think it's all about the pieces
And all about the bracelets
I'm still fighting cases
Ten thousand for the glasses
Diamonds in they faces
Your own blood taste it
We stomp you till you tasteless
My t-shirt ain't tailored
You read what is said, bitch
Brick squad bossman off with you head, bitch
Run for the exit
They shootin' inside here
Parking lot gun fight bodies outside here
Police best bet come with the riot gear
Soldiers down to die here
Move to America
Dollar and a dream and a donor picture, tear it up"

Now I'm tellin' you, you can hold this ring, watch how it glistens
Thought it would be done as quick as the wind blows
Didn't think I would ever be involved
So I even wrote a song called ""Don't Go""
Now it's just you and me on a love road

I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not (well, I want to be well, I want to be well, I)


And shall I kiss you even
As you take me that way?
With the pill or demon
As my body changes
Apparitions gone awry
They surround me, all sides
But from within I see it, unholy changes

I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be)

I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be)

Ballad of the Black Gold,Reflection Eternal,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: Talib Kweli]
This is the ballad of the black gold
They call it Texas tea
But it's bigger than a cowboy with a lasso
It's deeper than a black hole
Create monopolies
Except they collect your fee when you pass Go
Crisis international
The government de facto
We got no control of this fiasco
Darker than the back roads
Bubble hotter than Tabasco
More than what you bargained for or asked for

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
You never see happy, hungry people - that ain't rational
They blasting through the gates and they attack you at the capital
Run up in your palace, find the heads of the state and crack a few
Get a taste of power, then they become fascists too
The fiscal conservatives, don't know what they purpose is
Spend money on the war, then they cut your goods and services
Murderous, corporate monsters is breaking records
Exxon is at 40 billion a year, they raking in record profits. Stop it!
How they banking while the auto industry is tanking?
Leadership is sinking; oil pollution in the water stanking
Loyalty to petroleum royalties spoil the economy
We won't get it poppin' till we oil-free
If you're oil-rich then we invadin'
They call it ""occupation,"" but we losing jobs across the nation
Drill, baby, drill, while they make our soldiers kill, baby still
The desert where the blood and oil spill
[Hook: Talib Kweli]

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Nigeria is celebrating 50 years of independence
They still feel the colonial effects of Great Britain's presence
Dictators quick to imitate the West
Got in bed with oil companies and now the place is a mess
Take a guess, which ones came and violated
They oiled up the soil, the Ogoni people was almost annihilated
But still they never stayed silent
They was activists and poets using non-violent tactics
That was catalyst for soldiers to break into they crib
Take 'em from the kids and try to break 'em like a twig
And make examples of the leaders; executed Saro-Wiwa
Threw Fela's mom out the window right after they beat her
In an effort to defeat hope. Now the people's feet soaked in oil
So the youth is doing drive-bys in speed boats
They kidnap the workers, they blowing up the pipelines
You see the fires glowing in the nighttime

[Hook: Talib Kweli]

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
History: a slippery creature
It's full of plot twists and surprise endings like a mystery feature
This oil shit is slicker than preachers
It make the problems in the region amplified like victory speeches
Poison the water, lead the boys to the slaughter
Go in somebody' country, rearrange the order and destroy the borders
You see 'em dancing through the fields of fire
World domination their real desire
The devil is still a liar
[Hook: Talib Kweli]

Patience Sabali,Nas & Damian Marley,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Nas]
Here we are
Here we are
Yeah
This one right here is for the people

[Chorus]
Sabali, sabali, sabali yonkote
Sabali, sabali, sabali kiye
Ni kêra môgô
Sabali, sabali, sabali yonkote
Sabali, sabali, sabali kiye
Ni kêra môgô

[Interlude: Nas]
Hey yo D
Let's go all the way in on this one

[Verse 1: Damian Marley]
Some of the smartest dummies
Can't read the language of Egyptian mummies
An' a fly go a moon
And can't find food for the starving tummies
Pay no mind to the youths
Cause it's not like the future depends on it
But save the animals in the zoo
Cause the chimpanzee dem a make big money
This is how the media pillages
On the TV the picture is
Savages in villages
And the scientist still can't explain the pyramids, huh
Evangelists making a living on the videos of ribs of the little kids
Stereotyping the image of the images
And this is what the image is
You buy a khaki pants
And all of a sudden you say a Indiana Jones
An' a thief out the gold and thief out the scrolls and even the buried bones
Some of the worst paparazzis I've ever seen and I ever known
Put the worst on display so the world can see
And that's all they will ever show
So the ones in the West
Will never move East
And feel like they could be at home
Dem get tricked by the beast
But a where dem ago flee when the monster is fully grown?
Solomonic linage whe dem still can't defeat and them coulda never clone
My spiritual DNA that print in my soul and I will forever Own Lord
[Chorus]
Sabali, sabali, sabali yonkote
Sabali, sabali, sabali kiye
Ni kêra môgô
Sabali, sabali, sabali yonkote
Sabali, sabali, sabali kiye
Ni kêra môgô

[Interlude: Nas]
Yeah, Sabali. Thats patience. That's what the old folks told me
Discovering the World before this World. A World buried in time
Uncover with rhymes. It gets no realer

[Verse 2: Damian Marley]
Huh, we born not knowing, are we born knowing all?
We growing wiser, are we just growing tall?
Can you read thoughts? can you read palms?
Huh, can you predict the future? can you see storms, coming?
The Earth was flat if you went too far you would fall off
Now the Earth is round
If the shape change again everybody woulda start laugh
The average man can't prove of most of the things
That he chooses to speak of
And still won't research and find out
The root of the truth that you seek of
Scholars teach in Universities and claim that they're smart and cunning
Tell them find a cure when we sneeze
And that's when their nose start running
And the rich get stitched up, when we get cut
Man a heal dem broken bones in the bush with the wet mud
Can you read signs? can you read stars?
Can you make peace? can you fight war?
Can you milk cows, even though you drive cars? huh
Can you survive? Against all odds, now?
[Chorus]
Sabali, sabali, sabali yonkote
Sabali, sabali, sabali kiye
Ni kêra môgô
Sabali, sabali, sabali yonkote
Sabali, sabali, sabali kiye
Ni kêra môgô

[Interlude: Nas]
It's crazy when you feed people the truth you don't know how they're gonna react
You're scared of wrong doers, people that just ignorant
You're scared of the truth, be patient for now

[Verse 3: Nas]
Who wrote the Bible? Who wrote the Qur'an?
And was it a lightning storm
That gave birth to the Earth
And then dinosaurs were born? damn
Who made up words? Who made up numbers?
And what kind of spell is mankind under?
Everything on the planet we preserve and can it
Microwaved it and try it
No matter what we'll survive it
What's hue? What's man? What's human?
Anything along the land we consuming
Eatin', deletin', ruin
Trying to get paper
Gotta have land, gotta have acres
So I can sit back like Jack Nicholson
Watch niggas play the game like the Lakers
In a world full of 52 fakers
Gypsies, seances, mystical prayers
You superstitious? throw salt over your shoulders
Make a wish for the day cuz
Like somebody got a doll of me
Stickin' needles in my arteries
But I can't feel it
Sometimes it's like 'part of me, but I got a real big spirit'
I'm fearless, I'm fearless
Don't you try and grab hold of my soul
It's like a military soldier since seven years old
I held real dead bodies in my arms
Felt their body turn cold, oh
Why we born in the first place
If this is how we gotta go?
Damn
[Outro: Nas]
This goes to all the wisdom and knowledge seekers of the World
Sabali, Patience, yeah"

Lost at sea somewhere, waiting

To let me go was not dem intention (they say)

Harlem Renaissance,Immortal Technique,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Let me welcome both of you to the show this morning to talk
About what I consider a very, very important topic of the Harlem Renaissance
But before we get into that

[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
Harlem once was red line district rated
Designated ghetto like the yellow star of David
And you wonder why people don't own their homes
Cause the racist bank wouldn’t fucking mortgage a loan
Until after the invasion of gentrification
Eminent domain intimidation
That's not negotiation, and it's frustrating to look at
Every day, like watching a porno, on 56k
Biohazard labs instead of storerooms
Whats next motherfucker, projects as dorm rooms
You ain't fooling nobody in this community duke
With your little fake Manhattanville community group
Ivy League, real estate firms are corrupt
They lay siege to your castle like the Moors in Europe
They treat street vendors like criminal riffraff
While politicians get the corporate kickback
[Refrain]
Harlem Renaissance, a revolution betrayed
Modern day slaves, thinkin' that the ghetto is saved
Till they start deporting people off the property
Ethnically cleansing the hood, economically
They wanna kill the real Harlem Renaissance
Tryna put the Virgin Mary through an early menopause
The savior is a metaphor for how we set it off
Guerrilla war against the rezoning predators

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
When I speak about Harlem I speak to the world
The little Afghan boy and the Bosnian girl
The African of Sudan, the people of Kurdistan
The third world American, indigenous man
Palestinians, Washington Heights Dominicans
Displaced New Orleans citizens
Beach front Brazilian favelas that you livin' in
The hood is prime real estate, they want back in again
I didn't write this to talk shit, I say it because
Some of ya'll forgot what the Harlem Renaissance was
We had revolution, music, and artisans
But the movement was still fucked up like Parkinson's
Cause while we were giving birth to the culture we love
Prejudice kept our own people outta the club
Only colored celebrities in the party
And left us a legacy of false superiority
W.E.B. Du Bois versus Marcus Garvey
And we ended up, selling out to everybody
The Dutch Schultz and John Gotti's
Banksters, modern day gangsters
Immobile army
They wanna move us all out the NYC
Like they did to the Jews
With the Alhambra Decree
So support your own businesses and do the knowledge
Cause the real Harlem Renaissance is economic
[Refrain]

[Outro]
When they were saying it is the renaissance of Harlem
They didn't mean that we had stake in that
They meant to say that they could make money out of us
They are coming in with all kinds of prejudices
In Brooklyn they're doing the same thing
In Queens they're doing the same thing
The Bronx, there's hardly any place which is affordable
I mean those people are putting up condominiums which start from a million dollars
How many people in this community make that kind of money
How many people HAVE that kind of money
People of Harlem, they are the natural allies of the oppressed people of the world
Whether the struggle is in Panama, in Africa, Cuba
We spend money with the wrong people
We are looking for love with people
Who don't love us
What's wrong with loving each other and making sure we are protected"

Look, I stands out
Don't think this ain't some shit that I done planned out
And life is beautiful as ever when it pans out
And girls are beautiful until they want a hand out
But, hah, ask Apple how I get it though
I'll be on the phone with a bitch that you will never know
So you can son me never
I don't get bitter, I just get better
And a verse is just a verse for me
I keep it generic and these niggas take it personally
If I was in a room and someone yelled, ""Hey bitches!""
I would never turn around cause I just don't fit the description, hah
But that's just me though
But don't mind him girl, that's just Freako
Please don't cuss girl, that don't suit ya
His name 40 and his name Future
Oliver's here and you know me ho
I'm the cash cow front man of OVO
I am not doing features now, no means no
And the hate starts building the more we grow
Damn shame am I over-expressing the game
Should I hold back on addressing the lame?
Cause they becoming obsessed with my name
I'm trying to clean up my mess and explain
And boy you know my progression insane
My engineer is the best in the game
And ever since I've been messing with Wayne
People getting jealous I can see they expressions have changed
They seemed to love me when this shit was going nowhere
And now they got a bunch of feelings that they won't share
They just give me the fuck it I'm broke stare
And Drake was at the club and he balled like no hair
Living life from a whole different angle
Only see the road through the wings of an angel
And I can see the heart on your sleeve
And I know this shit is hard to believe
You gone have to get over it

And all you talking ass niggas, get over it
And all you people that be hating, get over it
And all you women that I fucked, get over it
And yeah, I'm turning 22, get over it

Y'all niggas can get if you want it
Tryna catch a flight?
I'm in the back seat playing Xbox, car service just chillin'
Burners in the wall, money all through the ceiling
And Spitta on the phone, tell my dawg that we killin'
These fuckin blogs, they love a star and I'm flashin'

The game been kinda slow but I'mma treat it like a Ashton
Pedal to the metal I'm mashin'
All we know is big money, medical weed, and fashion
So, try your best to imagine

Bitches freeze in the Xenon headlights like a deer
But not out of fear, she looking cause its money over here
Shine from above these land lovers I'm a chandelier
My girl gotta pocket bubbler in her purse
She keep it G and pack the bowl with weed and let me hit it first
Ain't tryna be a hogg, dawgy all I want is what I'm worth
80 days, 80 stages baby all around the earth
Amazing race for the paper you suckas eattin' dirt
Chew some orbit gum, brush your teeth and scrape your tongue
Fresh as they come, second to none
Pretty woman flirt
Batting eyelashes they need guidance
Lace em up like my New Balance

To the planes was a Palm Pilot

Wolf Gang on that ""drive without a license"" shit
On that ""take Shake and Meka necks and fuckin' slice them shits""
Oh, how nice—now, you wanna say you like the shit
Because you bruised up, your neck sliced, and I ain't icing shit
Show me a rapper my age that say he nice as this
And I'll show you a faggot that say he hate Barbara Streisand flicks
Ha! Me and Berman swervin' in the jeep
I'm a nice guy in person, but a pervert in the sheets
And I'm magic with the words, murder Merlin over beats
Make the competition kiss the fuckin' curb, and then they weep

Drop, bitch

And praying that it damages, your hobby's what my passion is

Fucking the game and shoving daggers through the ass of it
I said, fuck that faggot shit, my niggas on that savage shit
Fucking the game and shoving daggers through the ass of it
Moving on to a Jessica, plannin' to make a mess of her

A coward dies a thousand deaths
A soldier dies but once
Tonight's the night I get in some shit

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
They say pussy and paper is poetry, power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Picturing pitiful punk niggas copping pleas
Puffing weed as I position myself to clock G's
My enemies scatter in suicidal situations
Never to witness the wicked shit that they was facin'
Pockets is packed with presidents, pursue your riches
Evading the playa hating tricks while hitting switches
Bitches is bad-mouth, ‘cause brawling motherfuckers is bold
But charge them hoes; the game should be sold
I'm sick of psychotic society, somebody save me
Addicted to drama, so even Mama couldn't raise me
Even the preacher and all my teachers couldn't reach me
I run in the streets and puffing weed with my peeps
I'm duckin' the cops, I hit the weed as I'm clutchin' my Glock
Niggas is hot when I hit the block; what if I die tonight?
[Chorus: 2Pac & Dr. Dre]
If I die tonight
If I die tonight
Fuck it, if I die tonight
Tonight's the night I get in some shit

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Polish your pistols, prepare for battle, pass the pump
When I get to poppin', niggas is droppin' then they done
Calling the coroner, come collect the fucking corpse
He got hit by a killer, preoccupied with being boss
Revenge is the method
Whenever steppin', keep a weapon close
Adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
Jealous niggas and broke bitches equal packed jails
Hit the block and fill your pockets, making crack sales
Picture perfection, pursuing paper with a passion
Visions of prisons for all the pussies that I blasted
Running with criminals individuals with no remorse
Try to stop me, my pistol posse's using deadly force
In my brain all I can think about is fame
The police know my name, a different game, ain't a thing changed
I'm seeing cemetery photos of my peers
Conversating like they still here; if I die tonight

[Chorus: 2Pac & Dr. Dre]
If I die tonight
Scare to die nigga, is ya, ha?
If I die tonight
Never fear, never worry
If I die tonight
Tonight's the night I get in some shit
[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Pussy and paper is poetry, power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Pray to the Heaven's, .357's to the sky
And I hope I'm forgiven for thug livin' when I die
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto for thug niggas
A stress free life and a spot for drug dealers
Pissing while practicing how to pimp and be a playa
Overdose of a dick while drinking liquor when I lay her
Pistol whippin' these simps, for being petrified and lame
Disrespecting the game, praying for punishment and pain
Going insane, never die, I live eternal, who shall I fear?
Don't shed a tear for me, nigga, I ain't happy here
I hope they bury me and send me to my rest
Headlines reading 'Murdered to death', my last breath
Take a look, picture a crook on his last stand
Motherfuckers don't understand; if I die tonight

[Chorus: 2Pac & Dr. Dre]
Nigga, if I die tonight
No fear nigga, never worry
If I die tonight
Bury me a motherfucking G, closed casket fuck it
If I die tonight
You know
Tonight's the night I get in some shit
[Outro: 2Pac & Dr. Dre]
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
Tonight's the night I get in some shit
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder"
Just Be Good to Green,Professor Green,"['hip hop', 'pop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Lily Allen (Professor Green)]
Friends tell me I am crazy
That I’m wasting time with you
You’ll never be mine
(Just be good to me)
Just be good to me

[Verse 1: Professor Green (Lily Allen)]
Huh, just be good to Green
All I need is a woman to be good to me
I'm an easy man, I’m easily pleased
And you provide me with everything that I need
Look, you know I make ends, I grind
So hold on to yours, we’re spending mine
Though you try, I never let you buy
But if I was broke, would you still be spending time? (Yes)
And I believe you would
Don’t think P’s too fucked to treat you good
I’ll walk street with you (Yes)
Talk deep with you (Yes)
Even sleep and spend all week with you
And I’m off
You wish I’d put an end to the torment
Stop, but one thing it’s not ever is boring
What would you rather me be that?
I ain’t ever gonna change; are you ever gonna to realize?
[Hook: Lily Allen] (Professor Green)
People always talk about
(Look, people are always going to talk, babes)
Reputation
(I ain't even gonna lie, shit
But it ain't like you don't know what mine is)
I don’t care what you do to them (Nah?)
Just be good to me
(I’ll try, I’ll try, I’ll try)

[Verse 2: Professor Green (Lily Allen)]
Look, babes, you know who I am
But as crooked as I am, I’ll be as good as I can
I can try and try, though it's evident
My angel face is disguise for the devil inside
You’re good to me; I ain’t good to girls, me
I’m a bad boy, something every good girl needs
Hey, honesty could avoid all your tantrums
But I’m a naughty boy and I always have been
What?  And that ain’t changing anytime soon
I can’t have you with me whenever I move
Whatever I do, I come back to you
See, the good attracts me and the crook attracts you (Whatever)
What?  We all got our ways, remember us talking
Of course it was game
But it’s all gonna change.  Now she got me cutting off links
Like I’m trying to shorten my chain
[Hook: Lily Allen (Professor Green)]
People always talk about

But it ain’t like you don't know what mine is)

Just be good to me
(I’ll try, I’ll try, I’ll try)

Friends are always telling me
You’re a user
(Not me, not ever; ain’t no other man gonna treat you better)
I don’t care what you do to them (Nah?)
Just be good to me
(I’ll try, I’ll try, I’ll try)

[Coda: Lily Allen (Professor Green)]
I’ll be good to you, you’ll be good to me
We can be together, be together (just be good to me)
I’ll be good to you, you’ll be good to me
We can be together, be together (just be good to me)

I don’t care what you do to them
Just be good to me

Grow a Pear,Kesha,"['pop', 'dance']","[Verse 1]
Last night, I had enough of you
I put on the brakes
And I could tell you took it hard
It was all over your face
That you were slippin'
And flippin'
But here is the sitch
I signed up for a man
But you are just a bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
You should know
That I love
You a lot
But I just can't date a dude with a vag'

[Chorus]
When we fell in love, you made my heart drop
And you had me thinkin' 'bout you non-stop
But you cry 'bout this and whine about that
When you grow a pear, you can call me back
Yeah, I think you're hot, I think you're alright
But you're actin' like a chick all the time
You were cool and now you're not, just like that
When you grow a pear, you can call me back
[Verse 2]
When I first met you, panties droppin'
Every time I saw you, it was on and
One day you asked if we could just talk
And that's the reason why I'm walkin'
If I am honest
I'm just not hooked on your phonics
I'm not tryin' to be rude or crude
I just wanted one thing from you
And you got confused

[Pre-Chorus]
You should know
That I love
You a lot
But I just can't date a dude with a vag'

Hello babe, what's happening, you cool?
Ah yeah you alright? What's happening?
Yeah I'm good, what's goin' on?
Yeah, nothing er chillin'
Alright, what you up to later?
Oh yeah about that, um, dya know what I'm really busy can I call you back?

[Verse 1]
This ain’t so stereotypical man, not for a stereotypical man
It should be me that wants to get rid of you
Instead, it’s you that don’t give a damn (what?)
It was meant to be a one-night ‘ting
Nothing more than a little one night fling
Now when I’m in need you’re the one I ring I (I need you tonight)
But she’s playing hard to get
Brunette with such class she’s hard to forget
See at first I wasn’t after her heart
But I couldn’t stop thinking about her after I left
I’m beginning to lose my cool, it appears in love I have fallen (whoops!)
I’m ready to put my all in and all she does is ignore my calls
[Chorus]
She’s everything I want, but all that I don’t need
How can she be so hot, yet be so cold to me
How can it be so wrong, and yet it feels so right
I wish I never, but I need you tonight!

[Verse 2]
This lady is driving me crazy
She blows hot and cold like the AC
I just can’t figure her out
Next time I’m with her I’m pinning her down (Oi)
I’m gonna’ figure out if she’s on it or not (not, not)
‘cos all of this shit is long (long, long)
See I front like I’m okay but I’m not
I’m being played at my own game and it’s long (long blud)
I ain’t no idiot (nope), I’m pro, I’m no intermediate
So next time she phones me I’m ain't even gonna pick up the phone to speak, innit?
(ring) nope, swear down
(ring) wait a minute, that’s her now
(hello?)
(I really wanna’ see you today)
Alright, just give me a time and a place and I'm there

She’s everything I want, but all that I don’t need
How can she be so hot, yet be so cold to me?
How can it be so wrong, and yet it feels so right
I wish I never, but I need you tonight!

I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you
I need you, I want you
Won’t stop until I’ve got you
There’s nothing that I won’t do
I need you tonight

[Verse 3]
Look, I ain’t never been the type to be this (nope)
I ain’t never been the type to be with
She's exposing a side of me that
I’m tryna’ fight, I’m tryna’ hide!
My pride, I’m tryna’ find it
But ain’t seen it, (umm) I’m an eejit
I know I can’t help it, I'm fiending
(I need you tonight)

She’s everything I want, but all that I don’t need
How can she be so hot, yet be so cold to me?
How can it be so wrong, and yet it feels so right
I wish I never, but I need you tonight!

Yeah, bad place. This does not happen to me. I am me!
I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you…

To move on and groove and get the money straight
Flip another cake, 27, 28

Jordan numbers, whatever, wood chain with a Jesus
Hey you, what the fuck you think you doing?

So, why don't you fucking wipe that stupid look on your face

And stabbing this Ice Cube look-a-like
To show you a nigga with attitude

Wait, I heard about you from that other nigga Earl
How you traveled to Milan and now it only likes girls
I'll roundhouse you into a fucking basket
Push you into an old lady bagging plastic
Hope you get the message, I will stomp you into potholes
And fill you up with shells, but you're used to eating tacos

And now you ain't around, baby I can't think
I shoulda put it down, shoulda got that ring

Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinking all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she pick up the phone

[Verse III: Akon]
So thick, so raw
That oil all over her body stole my heart, I'm cold
The way she dropped down won't allow me to close my jaw, cause I'm
Already in love and I knew better from the start, oh no

[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
That I was wrong for fallin' in love (love)
I was wrong for fallin' in love (they always said don't love a ho)
Said I was wrong for fallin' in love (love, don't do it yo)
I was wrong for fallin in love (they always said don't love a ho)
But I just went against the grain
[Chorus: Akon]
It was a feelin' I can't explain (explain), and it felt like harmony (yeah)
Singin in my face like dee-dee-da-di-do-da-de (do-da-de)
I don't want it to ever go away (I don't)
I want it around me everyday (everyday)
Singin in my face like dee-dee-da-di-do-da-de (yeah)
It was a feelin' I can't explain (can't explain), and it felt like harmony (harmony)
Singin in my face like dee-dee-da-di-do-da-de (uh yeah)

Concrete Schoolyard,Jurassic 5,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
We were sitting out on a step, you know

[Verse 1]
Now I'm a say this one time boy and that's my word
We rockin' shots and not fire through the Hindenburg
The contribution is clear
You add water to bone
And get the Jurassic 5 on the microphone
Now if you like the tone
And how the harmony's done
And the sucka MC's die before they've begun
Well I'd like to know if
You've got the notion
'Cause we're number one
I'm not trying to say my style is better than yours
I'm just on some other shit
I'm all about the beats and the lyrics
So when you hear it you can feel it
The vibe is energized by the presence of my spirit
No interference we persevere
The purpose is clear
We're here to leave your ear hurtin' severe
You're lurking in fear
'Cause we take it back like Robin Loxley
Rockin' from country sides to spots where hard rocks be
I often wonder if these MC's even know how it feels
To dedicate they whole life to this mic of steel
It's not about the bills
That's not keeping it real
A lot of tight rappers out here ain't got no deals
We appeal to the brothers with flow finesse
'Cause it's the 100 watt bloodshot Game of Death
'Cause we're protected by the covenant of words and beats
Rewind and feel the heat
Recline and take a seat
So ah...

[Verse 2]
Now I walk from Tanzania
Earthquake Transylvania
And on my way I kicked a hole through the wall of China
Just to get the right blend
'Cause it's schizophrenic of the pathway to livin'
I fell into the deep end
You shouldn't have told me
The pyramids can hold me
So now a contest is what you owe me
Pull out your beats pull out your cuts
Give us a mic, whattup
And we gon' tear shit up
I'm on some old and forgotten
Sun up to sun down
Like picking cotton
The nutty professor science droppin'
Rockin' Robin's hood
From New York to Compton
Me and my three sons
Jabari, Shakir, and Kahsum

Hey, I'm 2na-Fish from U-N-I-T-Y
Do or die
Anti-illuminati, why
Do the liquid from my vocals
Make the ghetto start swimming
Forever winning I'm in it
Like Meadowlark Lemon
I get goosebumps
When the bassline thumps
A sucka MC freestyle
He had mine for lunch
Marc 7even get you open like an attache
Briefcase in this case
The victor is no way
Ah, ah the tool spinners
Cooking the full dinner
Killing the firstborn of lyrical Yul Brynners
When is it the academy
Rattling your anatomy
That'll be J5 so kill all of your fake flattery
That'll be the day
When labels pay our way
2na what you say
When MC's come to play

Preparing your intellect before your final nap

You got beef now watch how I settle it
I'll fuck around and arrest your whole development
I'm eloquent
When it comes to digital display
I'm ready for the world while you earl off the Tanqueray
Tactics, my shits Jurassic 5
Fingers of death while you exhale and inhale
With a deep breath with my Chop-Sui style
'Cause I'm a lyrical chef
I gets mines to the death
'Cause I be cookin'
From here to Brooklyn
Your shit's annoying like fat-ass Bookman
On Good Times
When I rhyme
I hit the designated area
I hope you got your shots 'cause this is lyrical malaria
Spreading, beheading fools with the punishment
I live in America but fuck this government
A hundred and fifty times over silk with lead
While y'all drink the Similac
My rhymes are breast-fed
No artificial nipples
I flip the real skills
I thought I told you once
I kick the lyrical windmills
And backspin Benedict
Strictly for my benefit
I step on toes when I flow don't get offended
Come and get with it
Comprehended when I kick it
I represent the real

My Philosophy,Boogie Down Productions,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
(""So, you're a philosopher?"")
(""Yes, I think very deeply."")
In about four seconds, a teacher will begin to speak

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
Let us begin, what, where, why or when
Will all be explained like instructions to a game
See I'm not insane, in fact I'm kind of rational
When I be asking you, ""Who is more dramatical?""
This one or that one, the white one or the black one
Pick the punk and I'll jump up to attack one
KRS-One is just the guy to lead a crew
Right up to your face and diss you
Everyone saw me on the last album cover
Holding a pistol, something far from a lover
Beside my brother, S-C-O-T-T
I just laughed 'cause no one can defeat me
This is lecture number two, ""My Philosophy""
Number one, was ""Poetry"" you know it's me
This is ""My Philosophy,"" many artists got to learn
I'm not flammable, I don't burn
So please stop burning and learn to earn respect
'Cause that's just what KR collects
See, what do you expect when you rhyme like a soft punk?
You walk down the street and get jumped
You got to have style and learn to be original
And everybody's gonna wanna diss you
Like me, we stood up for the South Bronx
And every sucker MC had a response
You think we care? I know that they are on the tip
My posse from the Bronx is thick
In real real life, we roll correctly
A lot of suckers would like to forget me
But they can't 'cause like a champ I have got a record
Of knocking out the frauds in a second
On the mic, I believe that you should get loose
I haven't come to tell you I got juice
I just produce, create, innovate on a higher level
I'll be back, but for now just sekkle!
[Break]
In about four seconds, a teacher will begin to speak

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
I'll play the nine and you play the target
You all know my name so I guess I'll just start it
Or should I say start this, teaching I'm the artist
Styles and new concepts at their hardest
Yo, 'cause I'm a teacher and Scott is a scholar
It ain't about money cause we all make dollars
That's why I walk with my head up
When I hear wack rhymes I get fed up
Rap is like a set-up, a lot of games
A lot of suckers with colorful names
I'm so-and-so, I'm this, I'm that
Huh, but they all just wick-wick-wack
I'm not white or red or black, I'm brown
From the Boogie Down
Productions, of course, our music be thumping
Others say they're bad, but they're bugging
Let me show you something now about Hip Hop
About D-Nice, Melodie, and Scott La Rock
I'll get a pen, a pencil, a marker
Mainly, what I write is for the average New Yorker
Some MCs be talking and talking
Trying to show how Black people are walking
But I don't walk this way to portray
Or reinforce stereotypes of today
Like all my brothers eat chicken and watermelon
Talk broken English and drug selling
See, I'm telling and teaching pure facts
The way some act in rap is kind of wack
And it lacks creativity and intelligence
But they don't care 'cause their company's selling it
It's my philosophy on the industry
Don't bother dissing me or even wishing we'd
Soften, dilute or commercialize all the lyrics
'Cause it's about time one of y'all hear it
And hear it first-hand from an intelligent brown man
A vegetarian, no goat or ham
Or chicken or turkey or hamburger
'Cause to me that's suicide, self-murder
Let us get back to what we call hip-hop
And what it meant to DJ Scott La Rock
[Break]
(""So, you're a philosopher?"")
(""Yes, I think very deeply."")
In about four seconds, a teacher will begin to speak

[Verse 3: KRS-One]
How many MCs must get dissed
Before somebody says, ""Don't f*** with Kris!""?
This is just one style, out of many
Like a piggy bank, this is one penny
My brother's name is Kenny, that's Kenny Parker
My other brother I.C.U. is much darker
Boogie Down Productions is made up of teachers
The lecture is conducted from the mic into the speaker
Who gets weaker: the king or the teacher?
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Teachers teach and do the world good
Kings just rule and most are never understood
If you were to rule or govern a certain industry
All inside this room right now would be in misery
No one would get along nor sing a song
'Cause everyone'd be singing for the king, am I wrong?
I say yo, what's up? It's me again
Scott La Rock, KRS, BDP again
Many people had the nerve to think we would end the trend
With Criminal Minded, an album which is only ten
Funky, funky, funky, funky, funky hit records
No more than four minutes and some seconds
The competition checks and checks and keeps checking
They take the album, take it home and start sweating
Why? Well, it's simple, to them, it's kind of vital
To take KRS-One's title
To them, I'm like an idol, some type of entity
In everybody's rhyme, they wanna mention me?
Or rather mention us, me and Scott La Rock
But they can get bust, get robbed, get dropped
I don't play around, nor do I eff around
And you can tell by the bodies that are left around
When some clown jumps up to get beat down
Broken down to his very last compound
See how it sound, a little un-rational
A lot of MCs like to use the word ""dramatical""
[Outro: KRS-One]

Take You There,Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"['hip hop', 'jazz', 'r&b', 'blues', 'pop']","[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
Never judge a book by the cover
Discover the soul brother with the Mecca don
Working brunette to blonde
How many Edison con when I respond in full black
With us having the vernon villains back-to-back
Amazing grace when I face the great paper chase
For real it’s long overdue
So I don’t wanna talk to you
I stroke the hell out of mademoiselle who insisted
Every night, she get her back twisted in the unlisted
I’m living through my son so daddy see it this way
I want him in the NFL, his brother in the NBA
No doubt I'm with a piece, down in mecca, all crazy
To the late Eve, none of this is make-believe
I breathe some of the most powerful lyrics of our century
Battle physically, conquer mentally
Essentially, you’re dealing with a Mecca affair
So anywhere you wanna go y’know, I’ll take you there

[Hook: Crystal Johnson]
C.L., whatcha gonna do?
You know you can make me move
Over, over again
Come on and take me there
[Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
Control now so in the future see me calling the shots
From larger plots to cash to mini-bikes and open mics
I’m blowing up spots for knots in the millennium years
And now I drop it on my peers, brings tears and fears
And now the question manifest in my only
My soldiers wear Versace or the army fatigue
That brings a world of intrigue and glamour to my arsenal
Of gods, pimps to players and layers of decepticons
My whole mind-state gravitate to weapon
Making people in the business get a misconception
It ain’t hard to the core, it ain’t sex on the beach
It’s just another plateau the brothers have to reach
Emphatic with non-cypher, then we were broke and misguided
Try to gas me like Hitler once we get divided
No question, you’re dealing with a Mecca affair
So anywhere you wanna go, I’ll take you there

[Hook: Crystal Johnson]
C.L., whatcha gonna do?
You know you can make me move
Over, over again
Come on and take me there

[Verse 3: C.L. Smooth]
Set it so I can make em all respect my fame
When brothers try to count all my chips in the game
Now let me civilize your foolish acts of gunplay
The plan of a stick man, the price in how to get away
Chose for negroes, the most hypnotical flows
On the planet, another East Coast track rose, goddammit
My theme, to mainstream’s the knocker
Only time I get writer's block is when my lucci's on lock
Pretty much I’m coming through in the clutch see
My thought is a bombshell, built to only propel
Or is it just my style of hustle making a mark
To rumble the playgrounds with more danger than Jurassic Park
It was dark, when I brought it to the light, for spite
My staff’s got me taking nothing but champagne baths
Now the aftermath’s dealing with a Mecca affair
So anywhere you wanna go, I’ll take you there
[Hook: Crystal Johnson]
C.L., whatcha gonna do?
You know you can make me move
Over, over again
Come on and take me there"

Flex, flex, flex, flex

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Slowly I turn, step by step, through the back window I crept
Silent as a mouse on the set while everybody in the house slept
I disconnect the phones and the rest
Find a butcher knife, cut the power lines to the lights
Now a nigga wild for the night
I come like the livin dead, straight from the dirt
Back to avenge his own death on this Earth
Ever hear of Jason, then you know my work
Down to the basement, the dog get it first
I can't help myself, my thoughts ain't my own
The voices in my head just won't leave me alone
Murda murda murda, kill kill kill
Pissing on the car seats, flattening the wheels
So there's no escape from the fate that awaits
No one to witness the horror taking place
Yeah, now I'm on my way up the stairs
To the bedroom of my prey unaware
Heads will be hung from the chimney with care
With hopes that the police soon will be here

Now we were once two niggas of the same kind
Went to holla at a hoochie with the same line
Sorta, honestly Ill never guessed you were a hoarder
And all that would manifest cause of what we both thought of her
So I’m like “how could you get mad of what she thought of me”
I found out seasons don’t only change quarterly
Cause you got bitter, it was real fickle
With me saying “girls are a dime a dozen” to a nigga with a nickel
I guess nobody told him that gossip and slander is not the answer
Wish I’da known that she woulda flipped out of propaganda
Ice in my veins, some people are less skilled
And he brought me up on charges when his ego got killed
When my friends in doubt, they learned a valuable lesson bout
In 30 years I ain’t reckon how to reconcile
What hurts more? The act of getting cut off
Or realizing that your 2 cents wasn’t worth more

[Hook: Scott Stapp & Mark Tremonti]
(So, you know it's hell, you know it well)
Now I'm forced to look behind
I'm forced to look at you
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell which is you
(So, you know it's hell, you know it well)
Broken mirrors paint the floor
Why can't you see the truth
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
[Verse 2]
Nothing could help somebody switch up more then thirst can
I seen the ill effect that fame can have first hand
Am I to blame for the person that you became?
Were you’re already on that path? Its so hard for me to explain
Look, some indicate that im watching who I never met
I see some things happening now that you would never let
If you were in your right mind
Were you showing me the right person at the right time
Or were you trying to make it easy?
Did it really please you to please me
Did that make you change everything about you to appease me?
My prides in shambles, wondering why and when did you decide to gamble
Or are you competing with Mya Campbell
When did that become suitable
How could you make something so ugly out of what was once beautiful
Next time beauty’s headed towards me I plan to dodge
Until I see its not just being used as a camouflage

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Only reason I continue to antagonize
Just my way of bringing truth into a pack of lies
Reveals peoples true colors, removes a bad disguise
Even though its something I predicted I just act surprised
That way the armor never chinks on me
Drunk mouth, sober tongue homie drinks on me
That way I’m protected, y’all got no choice but to respect it
Seen too many come and go to be affected
And how is it not expected
I’m hip to what its bound to be
And them relationships, combined ain’t weigh a pound to me
And so the bullshit, make sure its tasteful when its done
You can keep your 1000 faces, but try being faithful to one
[Hook (faded to outro)]"
Firework,Katy Perry,"['pop', 'dance']","[Verse 1]
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""awe, awe, awe,""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""awe, awe, awe""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe
[Verse 2]
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""awe, awe, awe""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""awe, awe, awe""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe
[Bridge]
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""awe, awe, awe,""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""awe, awe, awe""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon"
The Choice is Yours Revisited,Black Sheep,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Here they come yo, here they come
Here they come yo, here they come
This or that?
This or that?
This or that?
This or that?
This or that?
This or that?
This or that?
This or that?

[Verse 1]
Who's the black sheep, what's the black sheep?
Know not who I am, or when I'm coming, so you sleep
Wasn't in my realm, or wasn't in your sphere
Knew not who I was, but listen here
Dres, D-R-E-S, yes I guess I can start
If it's all right with you, I'll rip this here joint apart
Back, middle, to the front, don't front
Wanna a good time, gonna give you what you want
Can I hear a hey? (hey)
Can I get a yo? (yo)
You got a 'hat? (huh)
It's for the hoes (oh)
The styling is creative, black sheep of the Native
Can't be violated, or even decepticated
I got brothers in the Jungle, cousins on the quest
Dead departed uncles, in pea porridge, may they rest
Guess, which way, what, when, how
Mista Lawnge, Dres, Black Sheep slam... Now
Know you've heard the others, phonies to the lovers
Then of course, the choice is yours
[Hook]
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is kinda phat

[Verse 2]
Where's the black sheep, here's the black sheep
Even if we wanted to, the flock could not be weak
Watch me swing like this, why should I swing it like that
Because in fact, on me it might not attract
Therefore I ignore, do as I feel inside
I live with me, I've got my back tonight
Ya know what I'm saying
Yo Black, I'm not playing
Need to go with this, or go with this with no delay and
See, in actuality, wonder can it be
I made it look easy, because it is to me
Any time capacity was filled, tried to rock it
Any time a honey gave us play, tried to knock it
Never was a fool, so we finished school
Never see us sweat, and you'll never see us drool
Out to rock the globe while it's still here to rock
Don't punch girls, and we don't punch a clock
Gotta go, gotta go, see you later by the cat
And you can't beat that with a bat
[Hook]
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that

You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is kinda phat

[Break]
Engine, engine, number nine
On the New York transit line
If my train goes off the track
Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up!

[Verse 3]
Back on the scene, crispy n' clean
You can try, but then why, 'cause you can't intervene
We be the outcast, down for the settle
Won't play the rock, won't play the pebble
Open the door, you best believe, we're sliding through it ... sssswiftly
Niftily, we can make it hip to be what we are
Cause what we be, be the epitome, doo, dah, dipitty
So now I dwell just to say you're plainer
Hold your cup, cause I got the container
Pass a plate or, cross the fader
Black Sheep get play like the Sony Innovator
Never the traitor, party inflater
And you can get a scoop ... later

You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that

You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at

She, she, she want it, I wanna give it to her

I wanna see her break it down (Yeah)
I'm ballin', throwing money 'round

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
She a working girl, she work the pole
She break it down, she take it low
She fine as hell, she 'bout the dough
She doing her thing out on the floor
Her money-money, she make it, make it
Look at the way she shake it, shake it
Make you wanna touch it, make you wanna taste it
Have you lusting for it, going crazy, face it
Now don't stop, get it, get it
The way she shake it make you wanna hit it
Think she double-jointed from the way she split it
Got your head fucked up from the way she did it
She so much more than you used to
She know just how to move to seduce you
She gon' do the right thing and touch the right spots
And dance in your lap 'til ou ready to pop
[Bridge: 50 Cent & Justin Timberlake; Justin Timberlake]
She always ready, when you want it, she want it
Like a nympho, the info, I'll show you where to meet her

If you want a good time, she gon' give you what you want
Let me talk to you

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, you're so new-age, you're like my new craze

[Verse 2: 50 Cent; 50 Cent w/ Justin Timberlake; Justin Timberlake]
Got a thing for that thing she got
The way she make it tick, the way she make it pop
I make it rain for her so she don't stop
I ain't got to move, I can sit and watch
In the fantasy, it's plain to see
Just how it be, her and me
Backstroking, sweat soaking all into my satin sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch 'til the club close
Watching her do her thing on all fours
Now that—that there should be 'gainst the law
From side to side, left to right, break it down, down, down
Know I like when you're hype and you throw it all around
Different style, different mood, damn, I like the way you move
Girl, you got me thinking 'bout all the things I'll do to you
Let's get it poppin', shawty, we could switch positions
From the couch to the counters in my kitchen
Let me talk to you

6 Minutes,Cassidy,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Cassidy]
Yeah, I go by the name of Cassidy the Hustler
And I brought two of my niggas with me
And we about to shut the industry down
Ayo Weezy let's get it popping!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Hit me,  Fuck that shit this the south side
Got a fat dick when your mouth wide, in front then take it outside
Nah do it right here, nah, how 'bout later on
Yeah when everybody home
Look, you fucking with Weezy F baby, please say the baby
Riding with your bitch, got keys on the lady
Triple gold D's Vogue tires on the whip
Young Carter sliding out, I'm flyer than the whip
Yeah, higher than an angel, or hotter than the devil
The pot or kettle, uh
The metal let 'em burn like Usher but worser
If there's any beef, I come Ron like Mercer
Word up, Eagle Street I'm throwing my curve up
We take your ice cream and turn you into Sherbert
I got flow I'm like ""Sure"" but
If it's about dough, I'm like ""Sure 'nuff""
I'm from the bird bunch, Birdman Jr. you niggas bird lunch
I see your lips moving but I ain't heard much
You see the wrist moving, it look like pure punch
I hear the playa hating but I don't endorse such
I got the Escalade, guts like the tour bus
I got the Styrofoam poured up with syrup
And in the tires where the package is gone
Midas been a Goodyear with these Firestones
I spit like Maya's poems, palming chromers
For the buyers chromosomes I got soma's
I got Vicodin, Valiums I ain't stopping
Got powder, heroin, ex, Oxycontin
And that's how we rocking
How can you hear that bop unless I'm be-bopping?
Yeah, skip when you hear that click
Cash money, nigga, I'm that shit, Weezy Baby, ugh!
[Interlude: Cassidy & Fabolous]
That's what I'm talking about
Now Fab (yeah), spit at these niggas
And let them know why they ain't fuckin' with you

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
You're goddamn right I'm feeling myself
A chauffeur, no sir, I'm wheeling myself
Looking for a chick chilling for self
So I can show her the suicides and talk her into killing herself
I'm having problems dealing with wealth
But you wouldn't understand it, until you get a million yourself
You niggas must've got a deal for your health
Your CD is frozen food, it just chills on the shelf
I spend big, at any time I can start splurging
The twin SIGs open chest like a heart surgeon
And I'm buttoned up, I'm just a blue-collar crook
But I keep a stack thick as few college books
I got a new polished look
And 20 dime bitches, to show y'all niggas how my 2 dollars look
The boy's got at least 6 digits on
So the guns gotta be at least midget long
The money, is like 10 bridges long
I throw bread around just to turn pigeons on
I got some good smoke just for puffers
The 2 grand 20's make the hustlers suffer
Plus it's fluffer, than a cotton ball
I've gotten calls wanting me to put the pot in malls
But nowadays you can't put it past 'em
I got a Dan Marino arm, I'm 'bout to throw some bullets past 'em
And the niggas in the hood keep quoting my lines
I don't jump ship, I keep floating in mine
Long as I keep toting, I'm fine
I'ma have these dick sucking niggas deep-throating the 9
I jumped in the English ship, Benzed in whip
It's Terminator 2 chrome, the engines dip
I'm reading scripts, no, not the penmanship (no)
The box-office shit (yeah), I box off this bitch (yeah)
Jessica Alba, Kirsten Dunst
And still make a mill' on the first of months
These dudes be the first to front
'Til their family and friends is in limos, they in hearse in front
I'm in the top position, I can make you a proposition
I'm in the hard top waiting on the drop edition
To hell with the patience
I'ma send a nigga down under like Australia vacations
[Interlude: Cassidy]
Yeah, it is what it is
My niggas just killed y'all and I'ma close the casket

[Verse 3: Cassidy]
I'm trying not to let this industry get the best of me y'all
I work hard for the fame, the game's stressing me y'all
All they do is complain what they expect from me y'all
From the hood to Hollywood they respecting me y'all
And even overseas they accepting me y'all
All the ladies show me love, the thugs repping me y'all
I get a lot of dirty money so expect me to ball
But I'm saving all my checks, I'm investing 'em all
They say, what goes up is gon' definitely fall
Even the stars, but success is my destiny y'all
Look, I cook tracks I got the recipe y'all
You can't name another cat that can mess with me y'all
At the shows all the hoes be molesting me y'all
I got broads crying trying to get next to me y'all
I got broads craving begging to have sex with me y'all
Screaming, ""Cass you don't know how sexy you are!""
And I'm happy I'm alive, God's blessing me y'all
And all the problems that arrive is God testing me y'all
So I pray everyday but I ain't praying too much
'Cause I be sinning everyday so I ain't praying enough
And we all could be beat, and I ain't saying I'm tough
But if it's beef I don't speak, I ain't saying ""What's up?""
If it's beef when we meet then I'm spraying shit up
Prraat prraat, I ain't saying too much and that's that
'Cause that cat you embracing with love
Might clap that gat 'cause he got hate in his blood
Keep your friends at a distance and your enemies close
'Cause the folks you call friends tend to envy the most
Some cats'll hang themselves if you give 'em a rope
Burn the bridge and don't give 'em a boat, let 'em sink
Sometimes you gotta give 'em some some time to let 'em think
But sometimes you gotta give 'em the 9 and let 'em stink
You can't bring every horse to the pond and let 'em drink
I'd rather keep my eyes wide open instead of blink
As soon as your eyes shut, them niggas'll ride up
And the guys that you trusted be getting you tied up
And we all gotta die but, I ain't ready to leave
That's why even if it's petty I'll be ready to squeeze
But put a cheddar in cheese, the guac-a-moola
I pop the Ruger, send that hot shit through ya
Like booya! That's the sound when the pound busting
Ooh, ah, you'll be laying on the ground suffering
Clown it's nothing to pull out and blast you
I try to only resort to violence if I have to
But man niggas out here are playing fair
So before the odds even I'm leaving them laying there
And I ain't even playing believe what I'm saying here
'Cause before this shit gets further your click get murdered
And thrown in a hole in the grass
For trying to play that thug role I'll stomp a mud hole in yo' ass
And this Cass, nigga, I'm that sick
Full Surface nigga, I'm that shit, bitch!"
Domier,Domo Genesis,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Put that shit in the air, O.G. got me feeling rare
Flashy nigga, I don't care, pre-rolleds in my Domier

Stop in fear, Domien the Genesis
Put flames to any shit, chiefing like I'm an Indian
I don't think I'm a quit this shit, like I invented it
Salute me gang apprentice-ship where you can't get no membership
Simple with sentences, soft spoken like bitches lips
Scathe yours, but here to take 'em back like we rented this
So where my mental is, higher than the sky is
The flyest, the flyer bitches wanna fuck a pilot
Ignite it, the weed, the medicator supplied it
The more doobie I smoke the more heavier my eyelids
Exactly what fly is, coming from the tip-top
Everybody wanna hate me like Chris Rock
Catch another O of weed at the pit stop
Wipe me down I'm blowing paper cause my shit's hot
Did you catch that? I'm scribbling outside the lines
Copped a couple G-Shocks, my bitch said I should buy some time
It's such a movie, this little exciting life of mine
Bomb main bitch and a half-asian concubine
Genesis, what is life like for you?
Raps, nice shoes, girls times two
Fly shit, recognition of my whole crew
I'm that nigga right now, watch me redefine cool, cool, cool"
Jazzmataz Guru Tribute,Jay Electronica,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Martin Luther King Jr.]
We’ve got some difficult days ahead. But it really doesn’t matter with me now
Because I’ve been to the mountaintop; I don’t mind
Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over. And I've seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land!
And so I'm happy, tonight
I'm not worried about anything
I'm not fearing any man!
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord!!

[Verse 1: Jay Electronica]
Boom bash dash
I had to break, I had to get away
Pack my bags, headed for Greyhound, it was a Monday
Time to start my mission
I felt that burning feeling in my soul, I had to listen
I had this re-ocurring dream from the stage in a suit with a fade
I had set the game ablaze and they threw me a parade
I stacked a little change and took my family out the caves
But I was trapped in a maze like a lab rat
And at the bottom of the barrel where they keep the crabs at
No Geico, no Aflac, nothing to fall back on
But the streets where niggas cussed out the police and sold they crack on
Better known as back home, where they treat the Arabs and the Spanish and the blacks wrong
There he go with that song
You may be tired but I spit what I'm inspired
From the Lord of the worlds cause the devil is a liar
[Hook: Tone Treasure]
Say, I've seen the lightning flashing (yes I did)
And I've seen the thunder roar
But you can't (you can't keep me down for long)
Because I'm getting stronger (Because I keep getting stronger)

[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
My style is like a shot of Jack Daniels, a baby grand piano
Lightening Hopkin, smokin' cigs, strummin' on the banjo
The son of man's the son of a gun with hella ammo
Sheriffs shootin' Bob Marley, John J. Rambo
Six sextillion, 19 million, the holy pyramids say we all Allah's children
Voodoo for the pilgrims who bring weapons and conceal 'em
They silence you with force and then indoctrinate the children
Yo Gabba Gabba, Ahmadinejad will blow up your apartment if you don’t observe the Sabbath
I look the devil in his eye and say abracadabra
Then drown 'im in the mighty light his brain couldn’t fathom
Scrappin' every day, just like fight club
A thriller and a smooth criminal like Mike was

[Hook: Tone Treasure]
Say, I've seen the lightning flashing (yes I did)
And I've seen the thunder roar
But you can't (you can't keep me down for long)
Because I'm getting stronger (Because I keep getting stronger)"
Not A game,Scarface,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Scarface]
It's danger in the streets these days
Man how the fuck am I gon' keep me paid?
Believe me mayne; if I got to die I got to go
This was all never sure cause danger life I know
It was all about the diamond chains, or the ride and bank
Smoke and listen to the Isleys sang
Would I ride the same? Dawg, probably not
Laid back reminiscin on the times I shot
Dare all motherfuckers trippin in them parkin lots
If it was war niggas wanted it was war they got
I'm a nigga, a real nigga, a quick thanker
That would hesitate to aim and see the chamber
Discharge the cartridges that the hollow-point came from
You can hide but you cain't run
Yeah, and he just started what can not be stopped
And fucked up cause you were thinkin you could not be got

[Hook: repeat 2X]
This is not a game
Niggas want a lifestyle with finer thangs
Hustlin to come up on these diamond chains, diamond rangs
Runnin on the daily out here tryin to slang

Now analyzin all the wrong I've done
I'm surprised I ain't dead I guess the good die young
I put a hole in a nigga head, fuck why run
From a lazy motherfucker cause he flashed his gun
We ain't cut from the same shit, nigga I'm a shooter
If I show I got a pistol best believe I'mma shoot a
Stupid motherfucker down, shoot a motherfucker down
Chalk his ass in the dirt with a bullet in his mouth
And I won't lose sleep cause when it come time for me to pay the piper
Fuck it, I've been tryin to meet
Yeah~! So please believe that when it's time to show
I'll be ready with my arms crossed, dyin to go
And I won't shed tears, I'm respected here
And you won't hear things you'd expect to hear
I rejected fear; and I don't wanna be another second here
But the question is, is he lettin me live?

[Scarface]
Right here the pros and cons
Cause life's way deeper than the frozen arm
They might streetsweep you if you're holdin on
My Sunday School teacher taught us Job in songs, another soul is gone
She couldn't have told me shit
Cause all I wanna do right here is fold me grip
And she talks to me in codes and all I know is bricks
Learn how to rock me up an O I coulda sold for six, instead she sold me tricks
So now I plead my case
The cops all on me tryin to bleed my safe
My pops all on me tryin to squeeze my face
But I'm not gon' squeal so I'mma need my space, back up I need my space
Momma ain't raised no rat
The word got back and niggas paid for that
Yo' ass got served and never made it back
Your ass had birds a nigga laid you flat, and then he raid your stack
That's how the game is played
[Hook]"
Pushing Buttons,Eyedea & Abilities,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Guitar chords]

[Verse 1]
I dug deep in my system to find nutrition for others
Lost sleep, tossed and turned, only to learn love is expensive
Talk was cheap, till my thoughts grew feet
Now I take them on walks with me
But I don't let them off the leash
Cause they might cross the street and get hit
Listen a second, I pretended to need a friendship
With many forms of energy till everyone repented
Now I'll end this with a sentence and a sense has become a way of life
To stay the night with my notebook, then wake up the next day to write
Again, and again, and again and again and again and again
Until my pen is inevitably inseparable from my finger skin
Lingering in the depths of a pool caressing this jewel
Fighting a million and ten inner battles that'll sprain my neck in the duels
Bobbing my head to keep cool, true, stays on the down low
Meaning proof for the bleeding, isn't useful in the council
Meaning it's cheaper what you believe to be the dopest at the moment
I'm exceeding the quotient and feeding me tokens
But the machine must be broken
[Hook]
Cause I'd rather give him a uppercut than give him a hook
So he steady throwing jabs just to get him to look
Man, every thought he ever had quietly sits in his book
For anyone that's afraid to jump, let me give him a push
Cause I'd Rather give him a uppercut than give him a hook
So I'm steady throwing jabs just to get him to look
Every thought I ever had quietly sits in his book
For anyone that's afraid to jump, let me give him a push

[Verse 2]
From the North side to the South side, to the wild side to the pesticide
To the genocide to the homicide, you decide to set aside
Well, pick a side, any side, are you along just for the ride?
Oh me oh me oh my, I wish you would just die
Cause kid, you're the reason for my sore throat
Petty mortal, the war won't stop till you hop in a porthole
And sort those problems out, child, it ain't all about your style
Cause you could break your back to state the facts and make them smile
While the pain in my religion, painting by the pigeons
Straining while you're listening to my brain on tire ribbons
Giving a splitting headache with energetic delivery
Living as a poetic shredded by the edge of misery
Vividly describing the pain inside of this entity
Physically and mentally, we all pretend to need sympathy
Interesting enough, you say you don't give a what
But there's much I grew to like through this mic that I clutch
So keep your hands down, and put your attention span up
Understand now, man, sound is a dimension you can't touch
Plants crush, when the vocals of that local named Eyedea hit your ear
So kid ditch your chair and stand up
[Hook]
Because I'd rather give him a uppercut than give him a hook
So I'm steady throwing jabs just to get him to look
Every thought I ever had quietly sits in his book
For anyone that's afraid to jump, let me give him a push
Rather give him a uppercut than give him a hook
So I'm steady throwing jabs just to get him to look
Every thought I ever had quietly sits in his book
For anyone that's afraid to jump, let me give you a push

[Verse 3]
But bury my mind with a friendship bracelet and a tin can
Get your business down and dig me up outta the ground when you get rich, man
I'll take a round of applause, but won't take no kids hand
Cause the challenge tonight is to balance my bike without a kickstand
Now a spoon full of sugar makes the medicine go down
In a room full of hookers, well my head isn't in town
I consume what you, shoulda, and assume that the lookers
See the moon and the fact they pushing you to do more than push a broom to
Cushion
Tune rolls to your head, and enables you to see
There really is more to life than busting nuts and smoking weed
But we proceed to say it ain't fair until we got gray hair
But next time I ask you to think, please don't give me a blank stare
Now take care!
[Hook]
Yo, cause I'd rather give him a uppercut than give him a hook
So I'm steady throwing jabs just to get him to look
Every thought I ever had quietly sits in his book
For anyone that's afraid to jump, let me give you a
Give you a, push it up now, push it up
Push it up now! Push it up
Lemme see them hands, people (Push em up now!)

Dope Man,JAY-Z,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","{*sound of a camera taking a picture*}

[Intro: Serena Altschul (Jay-Z)]
(Millennium flow)
Serena Altschul's here live outside the criminal courthouse
(This is {bullshit} y'all)
In New York City for the first day in the trial of
(I'm gone) {*car speeds off*}
The State vs. Shawn Carter, a.k.a. Jay-Z
(Uhh, uh-huh-uh, uhh, uh-huh-uh, uhh)
Whatever the verdict in this trial may be
The effects will undoubtedly be felt worldwide

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Ayo, stand forward, 'fore you take notice
Or witness to me killin' the track
Testify 'til me spillin' the smack
Now they got me for traffickin', racketeerin', audio crack
They call me dope man, dope man
I try to tell 'em I'm where hope, floats man
Ghetto spokes-man
A broke man, approachin' the bench with intent
To bury me under the cell, fingered me as the toast man
Evidence stemmin' from ninety-six
They say the world ain't recovered from his fix
While they was usin' cut, I was on some other shit
Gave it to you raw and they just discovered it
Nowaday, the jury got they brow raised
Listenin' to testimony about my foul ways
Exhibit A: Reasonable Doubt
They say this was the first thing that turned the peoples out
[Interlude: Serena Altschul]
You can feel the tension building here
As an unprecedented number of people have turned out
For what may be the trial of the century

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
They call me dope man, dope man
I try to tell 'em I'm where hope, floats man
Ghetto spokes-man

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
How come, you label your brand of dope
Vol. 1 and spread it through the slums?
Fed it to the young with total disregard
Your honor, the State seeks the maximum charge
And how could you, turn right around
And release a lethal dosage called Vol. 2
And is true you operate the criminal enterprise
Known as Roc-A-Fella in charge of his meteoric rise?
And do you deny you're responsible for the demise
Of record execs, and do you object?
Your distribution's Polygram, and through your connects
Def Jam, you pushed over five million SoundScan
And not to mention, your co-horts and henchmen
Dame, Biggs, Lyor, Kev' and Russell Simmons
And we ain't gon' talk about Murder Inc
That just establishes a darker deeper criminal link
[Interlude: Serena Altschul]
The State is seeking the maximum penalty
And with the overwhelmin' amount of evidence
The D.A.'s presented, things aren't lookin' good

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
They call me dope man, dope man
I try to tell 'em I'm where hope, floats man
Ghetto spokes-man

[Interlude: Serena Altschul]
Despite the grim outlook at this point
The rapper has been known to emerge triumphant
In the face of adversity

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
They call me dope man, dope man
I try to tell em I'm where hope, floats man
Ghetto spokes-man

[Break: Serena Altschul]
Jay-Z is taking the stand

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Right hand on the Bible, left hand in the air
Before I spoke one word, made sure my throat was clear
A-hem, I'm a prisoner of circumstance
Frail nigga, I couldn't much work with my hands
But my mind was strong, I grew where you hold your blacks up
Trap us, expect us not to pick gats up
Where you drop your cracks off by the Mack trucks
Destroy our dreams of lawyers and actors
Keep us spiralin', goin' backwards
At age nine, saw my first hate crime
Blindfolded, expected to walk a straight line
Mind molded, taught to love you and hate mine
Climbed over it, at a early age, Jay shined
Fuck the system at Lady Justice I blaze nine
Your Honor, I no longer kill my people, I raise mine
The soul of Mumia in this modern day time
[Interlude: Serena Altschul]
While the jury is inside deliberatin'
Outside the crowd is frozen with anticipation

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
They call me dope man, dope man
I try to tell 'em I'm where hope, floats man
Ghetto spokes-man

[Outro: Serena Altschul]
Well the verdict has just been announced: NOT GUILTY!
It is complete pandemonium out here!
People are cheerin' and huggin' - there he is
Jay-Z is exitin' the courtroom right now
There is a swarm of cameras surroundin' him {*pop bulbs flashing*}
And people are just rushin' up to him
Let's try and make our way over there, Jay-Z! Jay-Z!

Uh-huh, uh
Jigga Man, uh-huh MC
That's right
Swizz Beatz
Uh, uh, come on

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Jay-Z)]
It's the things that you do
That make me feel so
(Come on, inhale, exhale, breathe on it for me)
And I don't know the way I feel
I can't explain
(Uh)
I love you
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do
(Bounce, bounce)
It's the things that you do
That make me feel so
(Exhale, breathe on it for me)
And I don't know the way I feel
I can't explain (Yeah)
I love you
(Uh come on)
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do
[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
You know the flow sicker, know Jigga, mo' sicker now right
You know what me and Swizz's shit sound like
Crazed and demonic, uh, without blazin' chronic
Product of Reaganomics
You know that motherfuckin' stoop raised me
Ringin' in the hoops but I was too lazy
School made me sick, teachers said I was too crazy
Low and behold, it's the new and improved Jay-Z
Let me explain this to you, baby
I spent nights out, days in
Niggas was blazing
Twelve noon where I was raised in
I felt caged in but kept roaming
Prayed for the Day of Atonement
Married to the streets no date of annulment
It seems every time it comes up, they postpone it
So I kept my chrome at the waist, waiting for the omen
Savoring the moment and now you know
The reason that I flow the way I flow, baby

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Jay-Z)]
It's the things that you do
That make me feel so
(Come on, inhale, exhale, breathe on it for me)
And I don't know the way I feel

I can't explain (Yeah)
I love you
(Uh come on)
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do
[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
You know I move like an ounce
Bottled up like crack
That's how I make you bounce like that
Defy Webster's words they can't pronounce like that
That's why no other rapper got a sound like that
Trap, trap of my life
Flashback, kill niggas
Rap skills unmatched, Jigga Man baby
I can't entertain it sometimes I can't explain it
God given, guess it was all for hard living
Far be it from me to question Allah's wisdom
Could've been lost in the system
Instead I'm involved with the rhythm
I dodged prison, came out unscathed from car collisions
I know I must be part of some mission
Shit, I used take it for granted
Why they placed me on this planet
I would ask myself while writin' raps to myself
But right there under my nose
Was the flow of all flows
Not a demon but a rose in the cement, come on

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Jay-Z)]
It's the things that you do
That make me feel so
(Come on, inhale, exhale, breathe on it for me)
And I don't know the way I feel

You thug you, look what you make the clubs do
[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
You know I've traveled through zones
Homes spazzed like a bad back
I came into this game on Jaz's back
I jumped off stood on my own two like boom, that's that
Yeah I'm here to show and prove
Don't matter to me the Garden or flowin' on Clue
Whatever niggas wanna do - it's alright with me
Whether you big or bossy, jig or flossy
Dusty or musty, sober or saucy
Broker than Todd Bridges, richer than Bill Cosby
Forgive me for my arrogance or you still salty?
Past on to the next life and you still haunt me
I'ma keep doing me unfortunately
I make the club rock, make thugs pop guns
Make old folks do the bus stop; can't stop son
Shit I give you what's hot and what's not, I never knew
Y'all (niggas) know (niggas) how (niggas) do

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Jay-Z)]
It's the things that you do that make me feel so
(Uh, exhale, inhale)
And I don't know the way I feel
I can explain

You thug you, look what you make the clubs do

It's the things that you do that make me feel so

And I don't know the way I feel I can explain
I love you
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do

It's the things that you do that make me feel so

Too much to sit comfortably, they lappin' up
Who shit is big pimpin'? See the flow different
I drop heavy then I let the four-fifth flip 'em
I keep rappers talkin' to kids, Jigga Sixth Sense'd 'em
Don't mention my name and lames in the same sentence

Be so careful I hear the whistle from the fo'-fo' barrel

Cool as a Fan,Little Brother,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Rapper Big Pooh]
Cool as a fan, cooler than a Stan, I am
Call my nigga up, ""what's the plan?""
Packin up a van, time to move, product out
Servin in this town, for now we rulin out
I'm a loyal soldier, do what is asked
Grind with no question, a few months passed
Money comin slow but these bills comin quick
No health insurance, scared to get sick
Mami got questions I'm not tryna hear
Develop Tunnel Vision on this path we steer
The road less traveled, faced a few bumps
On the way - call it gravel to tryna get paid
Not bein made cause I do create artNot bein played, they considered us smart
Well nigga I am, that's not a knock on me
That's a shot at the world but the blind cain't see..

[Phonte]
Uh!... Let's go!
They say, ""The industry changin him""
""Phonte to Phontigga, renamin him""
Niggas sleepin on the team uh, shame on 'nem
Same team from the old days, I hang with them
Won't see me in the club makin it rain on 'nem
Or at the bar with hoes T-Pain'n 'nem
World renoun, look at me now
Wit Khrysis on the boards like he rebound
Can't even stand next to us
But my hand, I extend like director's cuts
I know that chy'all prol'ly ain't expect as much
From a nigga that's twice as you, and that's a rough esti-mate
Just a Ball Park figure, all y'all get up
For All Star Tigga, see you actin hard
Don't make me pull your card like Hallmark, nigga
Get smoked out like a Pall Mall, nigga
+Sit+ you +Sideways+ like Paul Wall, nigga
For the whole du-ray-tion of this verse
You can say it's like a mo-vie, get the juicy details
No Mtume, niggas talk major
But they got no flavor like white folks Kool-Aid
... Uh! Peace to my nigga Duvey
Goin to the tip-top, Hip-Hop Hoo-ray
Niggas say rap is in a drought, so my flow
Bring the water out - Phontiggalo Boucher
(""Now that's some high quality H2O"")
I think I'm gonna get a bouquet! (uh!)
Stay down in the trenches, keep swingin for the fences
LB, nigga! Get ready for the LP, nigga!
Who the illest here, you tell me, nigga!
Ay, this is just to let y'all know in case you ain't figured it out yet
Me and my man Big Pooh... we not goin nowhere, man! F'real!"
Cold As Ice,B.o.B,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Well, me and her were the two
Me and her were together like glue
But we lived packed in a shack
Like the old lady who lived in a shoe
And we ain't really know what to do
Till one day she got her a job at WaMu
I said, ""Baby, if you been thinkin’ what I thinkin’
Then all of our problems are through""
So we got together with the crew
And planned everything with the T
We got gloves and guns and bags and masks
And anything we would need
So we scoped out the facility
Really we waited a couple of weeks
Till it was time to kick in the door
""Everyone down it's a robbery""

[Hook X2]
You’re as cold as ice (you’re as cold as ice)
You’re willing to sacrifice our love
And now you got me (Froze)
I said you got me (froze)
Because you’re so c-cold
You left me cold tonight
[Verse 2: B.o.B]
So I went to my girl and said “quit playin’ and give me the cash”
But nobody suspected a thing
It was quite a spectacular act
So we get to the safe out of everyones sight
So I take off my mask and ask
“did your partner remember to cut the line for the panic button in the back?”
And she paused
The look she had on her face was cold as ice
Before she could she could say the next word I heard the sirens pull out outside
So I tried to grab her and run, she pulled away and said she would be fine
She was on the clock so I guess nobody would think she was in on the crime

[Hook X2]

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
So I realized it was over
When the SWAT team kicked in the door
So I dropped my gun and the cash, and then I got bummed rushed to the floor
And they took me into the station
And they started the interrogation
And I said, “I ain't sayin’ a word ’till I get appropriate representation”
So as I get escorted out, to my surprise what do I see
Thats my baby sittin’ in cuffs
Tellin’ the officers everything
And I stand there in amazement
Trying to find an explanation
And the cops come in and restrain me
And they mace me and the taze me
I said, “baby why baby what did I do to forsake you
How can you turn your back on me you’re selfish I hate you
All I ever wanted to do was love you, were you faking?”
So I snatched the gun from my officer
And I cocked it and I aimed it
And said, “this is for all the pain you done put me through you’re ungrateful how could you
All I wanted to do was save you”
And here I am day 55
With 55 hundred to go
When you love a girl who is as cold as ice
Eventually you’ll get froze
[Hook X2]

[Bridge]
32 degrees below zero
You’re like 31 flavors you’re oh so cold
Feels like 30 straight days of falling snow
I’m so cold and alone, alone
You’re like 32 degrees below zero
Or like 31 flavors you’re oh so cold
Feels like 30 straight days of falling snow
I’m so cold and alone, alone
You left me cold tonight

Teen drinking is very bad
Yo, I got a fake ID though
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yo, two step with me, two step with me

[Verse 1]
One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Everybody drunk out on the dance floor
Baby girl ass jiggle like she want more
Like she a groupie and I ain't even on tour
Maybe 'cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore
Or maybe 'cause she heard that I buy out the stores
Bottom of the ninth and a nigga gotta score
If not I gotta move on to the next whore
Here comes the three to the two to the one
Homeboy trippin', he don't know I got a gun
When it come to pop, man, we do shit for fun
You ain't got one? Nigga, you better run
Now I'm in the back gettin' head from my hun
While she goin' down, I'm braggin' on what I done
She smokin' my blunt sayin' she ain't havin' fun
Bitch, give it back, now you don't get none
[Chorus]
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)

[Verse 2]
Two, here comes the three to the four to the five
Now I'm lookin' at shorty right in her eyes
Couple seconds pass, now I'm lookin' at her thighs
While she tellin' me how much she hate her guy
Say she got a kid but she got her tubes tied
Girl, you twenty-one? Girl, that's alright
I'm wonderin' if a shake comin' with them fries
If so, baby, can I get 'em super-sized?
Here comes the four to the three to the two
She started feelin' on my Johnson right out the blue
Girl, you super thick so I'm thinkin' that's cool
But instead of one life hat, I need two
Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels
Expression on her face like she ain't got a clue
Then she told me she don't run with the crew
You know how I do but that's just what I gotta do
[Chorus]
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)

[Verse 3]
Three, here comes the four to the five to the six
Self explanatory, I ain't gotta say I'm rich
Yes, single man, I ain't tryin' to get hitched
Liquor wasted on me, man, son of a bitch
Brushed it-it off, now I'm back to gettin' lit
With some orange juice, man, this some good ish
Homeboy trippin' 'cause I'm starin' at his chick
Now he on the sideline starin' at my clique
Here comes the five to the four to the three
Hands in the air if you cats drunk as me
Club owner said, ""Kwon put out those trees!""
Dude, I don't care, I'm a P.I.M.P.

[Chorus]
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy

Good music nigga"
2002 Rap Up,Skillz,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","See this what we gon' do ya'll
Recap thetwo double-O two ya'll
R. Kelly got caught whildin'
He sold more sex videos than he did albums
A lot of ya'll went down fam
Y'all did some dumb stuff with Soundscan
The industry did Micheal Jackson greasy
Brandy wasn't selling so she put her pregnancy on TV
Cash Money refused to flop
Baby said 'F it man I'm taking Juvenille's spot
Christina Ag she turned into a slut piece
For her record to sell she let out all of her butt cheeks
Rap girls take a lesson from that
Cause nobody remembers the girl that made My Neck and My Back
And hip-hop was at it again
Suge came home and Slick Rick went back in
Man y'all took it to the streets again
But this year a lot of y'all called beef again
JD and Dre started off dissin'
And then they stopped when they figured out that nobody was listenin'
Then the IRS hauled JD's cash off
Dre probably in Cali now, laughing his ass off
By now don't nothing amaze me
And in the middle of the summer man Nas went crazy
He was like I got power how they gonna play me
All ya'll wack and yes I was gonna lynch Jay-Z
I guess he figured ya'll ain't gonna punk me
Admitted to Payola and put Flex on front street
And flex almost got banned when he saw Steph Lova he tried to speak with his hands
And Steph thugged him like 'I ain't bout to get played'
She drove straight to the precinct like I'm bout to get paid
P.Diddy kept cruisin
You wouldn't think half of the year he didn't even have distribution
Y'all can front like y'all don't care
But this year goddamn man Diddy was everywhere
And designers made dough
But we gotta bury Burberry we can't wear that no more
And jerseys is next on the list
Ya'll was wearing throwbacks of players that don't even exist
Shot out to the Clipse they kept it on time
And hardest record of the year that would have to be ""Grindin""
And Em became the Elvis of rapping
Justin tried to do it with black music- ehhhh didn't happen
Man this year was a trip
And J.Lo and Ben will be over by the time y'all hear this
War time Bush wanted action but we was too busy worryin' about what Missy was saying backwards
Snoop stopped smoking indo
Michael Jackson put his baby out the window
Hot whip, the Escalade, I know you want one
The get back at the industry award goes to Cam'ron
Oh Boy was huge B
Dame gave him the VP and forgot to tell Jay-Z
You know what's more wild?
I watched 3LW grow up and turn into Destiny's Child
And that wasn't expected them broads lost one member and couldn't sell one record
Scarface made a classic, Mike Tyson got his ass kicked
A lot of rappers kept faking, Beyonce did a lot of datin'
Kelly rushed her album off a joint with Nelly
And got the same results that Hype got when he made Belly
She still look hot half the time
Funniest video of the year, well that would have to be mine
Production- my mans and them got down
That would be the Neptunes they got that hands down
By the rules you gotta play, and I swear that BET got stock in B2K
But that's another conversation
And Tweet know damn well that ""Oops"" was about masturbation
""Best of Both Worlds"" was sloppy- but damn, it still sold a million copies
If I was Hov I'da told R. it's okay to cut
But do you know how much tour money that you just messed up
Man this year was still gully
And 50, 50 came back like muhf****
Still beefin with Ja and Gotti
They coulda chose Johnny, Ricky or Ralph man, why they choose Bobby
What's left to say? R.I.P to Left Eye Lopez and Jam Master Jay
And that's it for me, this Skillz I'll see ya'll in the two double-O three"
Good Game,J. Cole,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Yeah, hey!
Hey, I'm just a Carolina nigga goin' hard for the 'Ville
I ain't seen six figures but I feel like a mill'
Cause I'm fresh up off the deal, will I chill? Never that!
I'm the hottest nigga out and you could tell the devil that
Got that crack! Went from pebble to that Roc, pedal that
So much bass, I mean niggas can't tell where the treble at
On the track, niggas can't keep up, they look, they trailin' back
Now these bustas couldn't catch up even if Id pedal back
Won't lose, bet on that! or be in debt forever
Plus whatever Jigga say, I'm hot
That's like the pot called kettle black
Now these industry niggas like damn, ""Jay said all that? ""
Same niggas could've signed me, now they gon regret all that
Bet on that! Bitch, this my beat, look how I get on that shit
I'm on it like I own it cus I sewn it
Needle and thread, hip-hop heads know them drums express youself
Aye look, I tried to school these niggas, they need extra help
I mean they just don't get the message dawg, no text could help
And now I'm on some 'fuck you niggas', go molest yourself
I'm tryna ball til I fall, catch myself, then ball again
Fall to the floor, dust myself, do it all again
Pardon him, sick nigga, never been a bitch nigga
Spit it for them ones like me who never been a rich nigga
Had the dream to make a team and get up off the bench nigga
You fuckin' with me, ya odds is slimma then a stick figure
Get bigga nigga
[Hook]
Hey, blood, sweat and tears, I paid my price
Hey, so come and get this good game
Aye you should come and get this good game
Hey, hey
I pray for days and nights I gave my life
Hey, so you can come and get this good game
Think you should come and get this good game
Hey heeyy

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I'm just a down south nigga, lil' east coast flow
From the concrete jungle where the trees don't grow
From the 'Ville, where the motherfuckin' streets so cold
Nigga I could show you streets where police won't go
We just tryna get a piece, my nigga we so po'
Why you lookin' at him, wonderin' why he sold dope
Or why she smoke crack? Or why he tote gats?
Gotta stay up on your toes cus if your feet both flat
A nigga heat gon' clap, your heartbeat go flat
The Lord giveth and he taketh, well he repo'ed that
They don't quiver, they don't shake, man they just reload gats
So much beef for a nigga to have a feast on that
Now a nigga like myself ain't had to keep no gat
But nowadays mo'fuckers is weak, won't scrap
So them OG's tell a nigga, ""Please, roll strapped""
It's fucked up a nigga man it be's like that
It be's like that (Hey) and it be's like that (Hey)
Them boys from the 'Ville and yeah it be's like that

Addictive,Truth Hurts,['hip hop'],"[Verse 1 - Rakim]
You off the planet, wherever you at you stand out
Plus you specialize in freakin your man out
Put it all in one pot lets see if it pan out
Stick ya hand out, I got it all planned out
Layin out the way, I set a date to wed on
Plus you got your head on, you my queen from here on
Lookin like lady Revlon with all red on
She fiending till I'm in her arms, I'm King
Put the silk bedspread on
Rose pedals and scent candle lit
Victoria's Secret set on
Rough sex turnin her on
So ghetto, innocent but scandalous just bling and fur on
Million dollar habit, she said its a fetish she gotta have it
Once she get it, she holla thats it
Keep the waters rapid
The hotter its automatic

Oh shit, she OD'n again I got an addict
[Verse 2: Truth Hurts]
He breaks me down, he builds me up
He fills my cup, I like it rough
We fuss, we brawl, we rise, we fall
He comes in late, but it's okay
He do, I do, he knows the rules
He takes care of home, though he's not alone
I'm on his team, he keeps me clean
And gives me things, he makes me scream

[Hook: Truth Hurts]
He's so contagious, returns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I've waited for
He keeps me guessing, spontaneous
He's so persuasive and I'm his lady

[Verse 3: Truth Hurts]
Oh! Tonight is waitin, and I ain't complainin
I'm entertainin, my number one fan
My back is achin, from our love makin
Oh yes I'm taken, ain't no use in fakin
My ups, my downs, my high and my lows
From head to toe, he makes me glow
He hits the spot, he makes me hot
I'm all that he's got, and he's all that I've got
[Hook]

[Verse 4: Rakim]
Thinking of a master plan
You know anything you need baby ask your man
You was there from a half a gram
Now it's kilos to C-notes and high fashion brands
We ball like we own the world
The only concern is you my only girl
And when we speakin in tongues
Breathing hard when I'm squeezin' your lungs
Keep it strong, but I gotta hit the streets when I'm done
It's joy and pain, when you tryin to get ahead of the game
It's fucked up, but you never complain
You just pray I don't get killed when I hit the hood
Just another hundred mill' and I'mma quit for good
No more drug wars trips to jail and shootouts
Gettin loot out for lawyers and bail'll get you boot out
Just me and you, high off sex and twisted
You OG'd and you OD: addicted"
Hold On Tellin Me,Little Brother,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Sample]
Sittin' on the edge of my mind all the time

[Big Pooh]
Look Ma
I wrote this with no hands
Naw, I'm playin'
Check it, I wrote this with no pens
A little flow to get the doors open
With your neck noddin' back like you drunk off Chopin
A lot of niggas quietly hopin'
I wouldn't return with the scope on them scopin'
But look niggas I'm here
Start chokin'
There's gonna be a lot of things said that's provokin'
Little dudes to get amp
Where you can get crushed like an ant
Turned out like a lamp
And take this mothafuckin' lick with a stamp
Do yourself a favor; don't fuck with the champs
Cause in any division
Whether that's, long or short on any decision
I'm gonna be the last standin'
Hand raised lookin' at the ref
You gonna ? count demandin'
For a rematch
But I cut out the beef
And guarantee you it won't be a relapse
Perhaps
In the crowd you can post up
Take a good look nigga
Get a close up
We froze up
Scrub niggas that rose up
Your run is over
Hand the fuckin' microphone up
I'm through with it
You can say I did it
I copped a squat on you lames then took a shitted
Whoa

People tellin' me, they tellin' me, ""Hold on""
And I'm on the right track and nothin' can go wrong
But each day it's gettin' harder to hold on

[Phonte]
The realest to do it, the illest maneuvers, the plan
To finish you losers that's killin' the music, the man
That's known in every section
They say the deadliest weapon
Is Tay chillin' with a mic in the palm of his hand
He's savin' rap from it's hideous state
He never
Get's rattled in the city of snakes
One nigga say, ""He don't rhyme as much""
I got the Midas touch
You Meineke niggas should give it a break
Cause I can relate to late nights
Rollin' in a dented Taurus
With my man
Bein' exposed to the cities horrors
Goin' to open mic nights
Where the audience, they did ignore us
But a lot of ill shit it had taught us
Like how to adapt to different people, different auras
And bring messages that our forefathers brought us
So even though I'm rappin' now and got thangs
I don't rock chains
Our ancestors did it for us
I'm on some, brand-new-and-improve
Phonte, 9th and Pooh on the move
I mean, who would have knew?
What our night time maneuvers would do
A whole state of MCs inspired
By the words we scribe
But some times I get quiet
And niggas think I'm depressed
I'm just analyzin'
I mean I'm strategizin'
I mean I'm fantasizin'
About all this money and stress
Because the taste of success is so tantalizin'
And some times I feel like a dope fiend without it
Wakin' up in cold sweats havin' dreams about it
Tryin' to tell my whole team about it
Y'all niggas got to walk it
My nigga, don't talk it just be about it
And this is what I'm faced with all the time
I'm not tryin' to be Rembrandt
Just wanna to draw the line
Between illusion and reality
And I'mma get what's mine
But I keep hearin' voices inside
They be tellin' me
Tellin' me...you ain't gonna make it man
What? It's my motherfuckin' life nigga. Uh, c'mon

Love Is,Little Brother,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse One: Big Pooh]
Life is based on sacrifices
And I don't know about guys that's like us
We always felt that drove you crazy
The oldest son beatin' on the youngest baby
No intervention
So much work is what started the tension
Lack of attention for the details
I suppose, time rose that cross roads
Of learn and pass, we both failed
Set sail
And blaze trails on our way
The sticky fingers of my day
Gettin' my pay, my way
Independence leadin' to the highways
The bi-ways, via the closet storage
The only logic for adolescent youth
Smellin' my pits denying the truth under your roof
Never
And so you lashed out
Kicked his ass out
He mashed out
Returned on the humble
We all stumble was the antidote
Till he chopped soap
It kept the glucose knockin' at your front door
We ain't front poor
We struggled through
Three kids, one mother
Minus three pop dukes
Lack of child support and money too
You made sure we never went hungry
As long as we in front of you
For three seasons you rocked the same coat
And spoke broke but found plenty at the holiday season I guess
It's from you I get my structure and my reason
Moms I thank you for believin'
[Hook: Phonte]
Now love is
12 hour shifts and sacrifice
And love is
Runnin' in back and switchin' the prices
Now run it down
Cause love is everything that you do
Now love is
Bouncin' checks to send me on school trips
And love is
Drawing retirement to get me a whip
Now run it down
And love is everything that you do

[Verse Two: Phonte]
Yo, I was lookin' at a blank page
Tryin' to think of words to describe you
The pain we shared and the drama we survived through
The times you cried when you was lied to
Single handedly raisin' a son before you graduated high school
The situation, kinda wild I presume
15 years old and had a child in the womb
And the whole town cuttin' eyes and gettin' mad at you
But fuck all y'all niggas was your attitude
That's why the teachers used to frown at me
Because that same attitude you passed down to me
Cursin' in class
They called me a deviant kid
But stayin' after school cause wasn't shit to eat at the crib
But you kept believin' in me
That's why I give you mad props
Even when our front door got padlock
And I was outside feelin' like a have-not
You taught me happiness, regardless of the backdrop
And yo, I know I don't say it
Thanks for all the times you made sure my work was punctuated
Even though your income fluctuated
I still wonder how the fuck we made it
And that's why I'm singin' this
[Hook]
And love is
Keepin' my words and my grammar precise
And love is
After school, come home with no lights
Now run it down
Cause love is everything that you do
Now love is
Child support checks at the first of the month
And love is
Summertime goin' out for free lunch
Now run it down
And love is everything that you do"

Yeah, I go by the name of Khrysis (My nigga Khrysis on the beat)
One half of the Away Team
And right now, you in tuned to the biggest colored show on earth...
The Minstrel Show nigga

[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
I can't afford to not record
So I call my nig' Khrysis tell him hit the boards
Then I call Tay put the pedal to the floor
'Fore we do the shop gotta stop by the store
I'm on my knees gotta go to the Lord (Dear Father)
I pray to you these niggas gon' pay for it
All them times that I went ignored
So what it wasn't 20 but still I scored
My heart still scorned and my mind is focused
So this, serves as a warning to protest
Any verse disperse is sicker that the first and
It's no treatment for this disorder
Carolina's number one reporter
A nigga who's back with a vengeance better run for the border (run)
Or head for the hills or duck and seek cover
Who else gon' make it hot this summer, its LB nigga...
[Hook]
They can't stop me, naw they can't stop me
They keep playing', keep sayin' I'm cocky
They keep tryin' but too tired to top me
Their best bet is to fall back and watch me
They can't stop me, dawg they can't stop me
They keep playing', keep sayin' I'm cocky
They keep tryin' but too tired to top me
Their best bet is to fall back and watch me

[Verse 2: Phonte]
Uhh, (whoo) ain't no need in gettin' teary eyed
Tay's the illest, point blank period
Plus I got niggas , in DC
That'll hit you for 3G's and a box of Yum's Carry Out
Outlook lookin' scary now
They was frontin' before but now they seein' that we serious
This ain't a peace talk, so muhfucka save your sweet (suite) talk
For reservations at the Marriott
They say birds of a feather often flock together
But me and Big Pooh rock together
And if not forever
I'mma reach to the sky, and keep flyin' high like we got propellers
'Goddamn, y'all boys doin' it', they stop to tell us
And if God propel us to the top, I won't go pop (pop)
No need to act a fool in public
Cause when you, ego trip you just lose your luggage and well...
I ain't got no time top play with 'cha
I'm Phonte, international stage ripper done
Made friends and made figures
While you stuck on the front porch
Mad, like you fixin' ta shave Mister (you fixin' to shave)
That's reality, so color me purple
My name in history, nigga that's all I work for
Better keep it moving like the laws of inertia
Before these Carolina boys come hurt 'cha
Better tell 'em bout it...

The fourth member can it be? Little Brother's extended family
Adopted to drop this Coca Cola classic
Bout to blow this rap shit
Gone away, a Chucky doll, you wanna play?
Red headed, that Jeff Goldblum shit? Leg said it
One of the best to date
A cannibal eatin' a meal off your chest plate
For great nourishment, for the sake of embarrassment
Leave this rap thing alone
I'll be the last king on the throne, royalty
Bit the fruit, the apple spoiled me
Bad McIntosh in the bunch
Tear sheets of the tablet off of knitted pumps
But don't sweat the technique
I tear flesh off beats down to the pink
Almost drown when I think, leads beneath the sea
The difference between VHS & DVD
See the details, see me re-bel
Revolutionary, the last breathin' poet
Couldn't touch me with a rhyme even if I wrote it
The death of thoughts in a baby's head
Figure four ma, left y'all Crazy Legs
I Rock Steadily, who ever thought of testin' me?

I put pens to paper, my thoughts a well executed caper
Droppin' giants like sky scrapers
Block Buster deals, spinnin' wheels for these merges
The world love to take people urges
And turn them into fixations, why you think we got PlayStations?
Everybody needs a vacation
Even niggas hatin', or dick ridas with they jaws hangin'
The birds chirpin' and they stay fakin'
I ain't your average nigga
A realist, 5-10, when the weather's bliss
240 when the hunger hits
A couple plus if I submit
Currency helps my pants fit, I stay saggin'
Dyin' to hop on NC's wagon
The seats takin' and we ain't draggin'

[Verse 3: Phonte]
Don't come around me if your lyrics is weak
When I spit for the streets, I rhyme outlaw
In my former life, ran with Dillinger's peeps
Still refuse to sell my spirit to eat
Promoters on that bullshit better get us now while niggas is cheap
While I'm just tryin' to write rhymes and listen to beats
Go to work, pay my bills and put Dillon to sleep
Not a veggie altercation, this legitimate beef
Bitch niggas sold us out but I kept the receipts
And extension files from 'em, revenge is a motherfucker
Payback is a bitch, and pain is the bastard child of 'em
And we gonna hurt niggas, awww, god damn it she gonna hurt niggas
That's what y'all get for tryin' to jerk niggas
And work niggas screamin' out, ""Peace.""
Killin' hip hop in the southeast, I'm aimin' at y'all mouthpiece
Slowly makin' me a mean nigga
Cause cats be back stabbin', like Eddie Levert playin' the Scream killer

But uhm, this is what came cross to my mind
I don’t know about you but

Wait until they see the futuristic-ness I’m flossin’ in
I don’t F with Michael, I’m caucasian Air Forcin’ ‘em
Marchin’ in my telly, ladies talk to me like Carson when
She callin’ me daily baby “I just wanna talk to him”
Ya’ll be readin’ rumors ya’ll XXL and sourcin’ ‘em
I’m hollin’ at Obama why he ask if I’m gon’ tour with him
They know you important when your rims is lookin’ porcelain
They didn’t even got ‘em. How I get em? From importin ‘em
Portland, ya’ll already know I’m back to scorchin’ em
It’s a suicide bout to kill em like I’m corpsin’ em
Better dodge ya eyes if you’re tryna beef because of him
Behy dodge ya eye if you ever think of crossin’ em
Homie don’t do it good advice what you should offer him
You don’t wanna be the dummy jumpin’off the porch with him
Say that he gon’ get me then he better bring his boys with him
Your hood can be your home bring it on, and I’m gon’ orphan ‘em!
Why the heck they mad I already earned a fortune and
Your chick is taking pictures pulling polaroids to portrait him
So outta this world, yeah my swagger is in the orbit and
They lookin’ at my neck it’s like he “he brought the jewlry store with him”
That crosses them. Texas boys they brought they candy toys with ‘em
They gon’ earn this that boy Ray face got Slim the boss with him
They'd be in that tone, in that Dallas, in that Austin and
The underground ain’t dead 'cause my hustle game is awesome man

Castle Walls,T.I.,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: Christina Aguilera]
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Observing the estate through the gate from the outside looking in
Bet you would think I got it made, better look again
I got a butler, got a maid, and a mansion
The belief is that I'm living out a millionaire's fantasy
With phantoms and ferrari's in the driveway
But you see the fame's in exchange for the same man's sanity
Your vision jaded by the Grammys on the mantelpiece
Just switch your camera lenses you would see the agony
Apparently, it's damaging the man you see before you
On the canvas, he may seem alright but all the disadvantages his family
Encounters overshadows his extravagance
Walk in my nines a while I dare you, would it scare you
While it surely seem like King's life ain't glamorous
As seen through the eyes of untrained amateurs
Because the camera doesn't see beyond the walls of the smiles
Only counts until it falls in the pile
[Hook: Christina Aguilera]
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Honestly to me, I think I'd lose every benefit of all that I've accomplished
If my kids never win at shit
Me knowing this, why should the verses I have laid
Be more important to me than the persons I have raised
I guess I'm saying that to say that opportunity
But they just don't equate to all the time they take away
From the kids all the shit I did right is a mistake
If Deyjah end up a stripper and Major slinging yay
How could I ever consider myself a great
If Messiah ain't paid and Nique Nique ain't straight
Would your favourite song about the whips, money and shit
Be relevant if you found out, Domani wasn't rich, nope
So me being the G.O.A.T. shouldn't mean more to me
Than seeing to it King go
From a badass kid to a man with some dough
Otherwise I may as well have stayed poor
So while they stay focused on me beefin with Flip
Shawty Lo, Gucci or Ludacris
Or if I'm fucking with a ho
Did I snitch when I got arrested or will I die over nonsense
Internally I'm dealing with this conflict
So excuse me if I don't get the chance to kiss the hand
That slap me in the face, ay I'm just a man
If they saying I ain't the best at making hit records
It's cause this my life these ain't just rapping
Shit, you think of that deep, did you dawg
See you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls
Bitch ain't thinking with the deep, did you dawg
Cause see you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls
[Hook: Christina Aguilera]
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls

[Bridge: Christina Aguilera]
Nobody knows I'm all alone
Living in this castle made of stone
They say that money is freedom, but I feel trapped inside it all
And while I sit so high up on a throne
I wonder how I can feel this low
On top of the world, it's beautiful
But there's no place to fall

[Verse 3: T.I.]
For the record ay, I give a damn if I never said shit again
My career was meant for me to come and tell it
Honest interpretation of how affected I'm faced with
Matters most rappers used to keep locked away in the basement
But the day that I walk away I ain't saying that I'm amazing
Downplaying the way I kept fellas from catching cases
Won't take into consideration how much it mean what I'm saying
And when I say what I mean even when I'm surrounded by the fakest
From one of the greatest sinners, blessed with most of God's graces
Who made his way amongst the greatest from the grimiest places
So next time you rating royalty, I'm always being given to recordings than the level
Of your loyalty, obvious you've been ignoring me
Who else you seen make it through the storm, unharmed disjointed
While all the critics was looking for Prince Charming
Disregarded the king of the south raised doubt
Even though he made a castle out of what used to be a house
He did shit that all your favorites rappers only rap about
But most of y'all don't see the castle through the walls
And the smiles till it falls in piles so while
[Hook: Christina Aguilera]
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls"

Drug boys' steady shooting
The streets don’t give a damn
They’re filled with such pollution
The kids don’t stand a chance

We’re trapped inside the matrix
Forced to play our hands
We’re filled with so much hatred
The kids don’t stand a chance
I said the kids don’t, the kids don’t stand
The kids don’t stand a chance
I said the kids don’t, the kids don’t stand
The kids don’t stand a chance

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Well, since I was planted at birth
I abandoned my own planet and I landed on earth
As a kid I never understood what I observed, and
Some of it was strange, but most of it disturbed me
Always in detention for the lack of my attention
You can call it deficit, really I just didn’t listen
And I was always missing, the teacher’s like ""where is Bobby Simmons?""
But trying to get a record deal is all I can remember
It’s funny cause looking back to the past that I had
All my days in the streets trying to prove that I was bad
I still elevated to the level that I’m at
Still elevated to the level that I’m at
[Chorus: B.o.B]
We’re trapped inside the matrix
Forced to play our hands
We’re filled with so much hatred

I said the kids don’t, the kids don’t stand
The kids don’t stand a chance

[Verse 2: Janelle Monae]
Sometimes it’s hard to grow
While living in fear of the unknown
How can he ever give love
When no love is in his heart
A child can barely sleep at night
Too worried about tomorrow
And what it behold, he drowned himself
Deep down in his sorrows
Will you run or will you share your life?
Tell the stories, live and try
See it when we’re given hope
That we know that we can grow

[Chorus: B.o.B]
We’re trapped inside the matrix
Forced to play our hands
We’re filled with so much hatred
The kids don’t stand a chance
I said the kids don’t, the kids don’t stand
The kids don’t stand a chance
I said the kids don’t, the kids don’t stand

Get By,Bobby Fischer (Rapper),"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Every single night, I have the same dream
Of me becoming a leader, I wonder what it means
I just want to see every fiend get clean
Because seeing them hurts my stomach like a ruptured spleen
So please God I'm beggin' ya, don't let me be regular
The world is too beautiful to sit up in a cubicle
When I was young my father told me, ""I'ma tutor you
And all the things I couldn't do, I'll make sure you will do""
And he taught me through and through, that's how I made it through
You can make it through anything, fuck who hating you
Especially when you know they probably soft as baby food
You know who I'm speaking to, I'm buzzing like a beeper do
My brother had one, back when he was young
The phone was Samsung, the kicks were And One
He told me, never to forget where you're from
And with him locked and Pops gone, I had to be The One
So I puff, puff, pass while Dishy roll a dubie
Even if you had a gun, you'd never hold it to me
But I drop shots, drop bombs like Call of Duty
Ain't nobody stopping me, watching me's to watch a movie
And I'm Antoine Fisher, hitting blonde women
On some ""bullshit"" around the ""mic"", Scott Pippin
The liquor got Bob spittin' that hot rhythm
And I tie it all together like shoe strings, stop trippin'
I'm spittin' on classics, flippin' like a coin
Till everyone who knows me begins to get the point
I handle my shit, like Rondo at the Point
Sitting in this dorm room, handling a joint
Just to get by, just to get by
The way the jets fly, who needs weed to get high?
If they put me on a plane, I can stop smoking Games
But until a label hit me, yo I'm stickin' with the sticky
I don't mean to be picky, but fuck a nine-to-five
I'd rather be rapping, having to do the grind
Cause you know in my life time, I've had to grind
Hanging in the sewer with my hands in the grime
And the fam on my mind, shit was hard to handle
Working all day, eyes sagging like pants do
Let me be blunt like something your man hands you
I watched dudes blow, hoping I'd get the chance to
Selling dime bags, stashing up the twenties
Stretching my cash, selling 15 sacks for 20
Saving my change, rolling up the pennies
Cause homie had to do it the ""harder way"" like Penny
In a year I disappeared, sort of like ""magic""
I was sure the future for the boy was tragic
In a year, the change I made is so drastic
I hope to go platinum, the flow is so classic
I had to help kids in my town get high
Thank God they were always down to throw five
I had to supply, just to get by
Just to get by, yes, yes, yes, I
Had the scale in the drawer, my girl watched the door
While I weighed out the grams, grabbed eighths in my hand
And headed out the door, but that was way before
I had a flow that'd bring them to their knees, sing please!
[Verse 2]

Yo I catch it and I run it back, like a fucking running back
Yeah boy fuck with that, I'm sick boy stomach that
These brats hoping school will end so they can get their summer back
But, in another month, I'm a get my brother back
And once they take that fucking bracelet off his ankle
I'm a have his ass hooked up like cable
He been a guard for me, like Logan Mankins
So on this track, boy you know I had to thank him
Keep this crankin', listen to the music
If you in your new whip, or at your computer
If you in your Nikes, or in your Supras
Just let them know I'm trying to be the ""don"" like Shula
No foolin', I'm trying to get a check
You got to pay for the tape, like Belicheck
Go get a ref, even if it's Donaghy just know that money gotta be
Sitting in my palm, tell Berg when I'm home it's on, I'm gone"

It's no secret we know how to squeeze lead
But the Pre-set is not to have to squeeze it
Used to be a beast but now we using t-shirts
And it reads RIP cause the peace dead
When I walk through the slums like Nomane
Little children say K'naan Bomaye
The rap game just got itself a new day
This is Africa, hooray
T.I.A, hooray
T.I.A, hooray
T.I.A, hooray
It means, This Is Africa

We Do It for Fun Part 1,Tha Joker (USA),"['hip hop', 'r&b']","My name is Joker [okay]; habitual smoker [yeah]
I burn so many trees, that I have splinters in my toaster. [ya dig! ]
I need a bitch to stay below my waist like a holster; [stay low]
And then I sit my cup up on her booty like a coaster
I brag about my money so they're calling me a boaster. [yeah]
I holler giddyup like I was on the Ponderosa. [get it girl! ]
You say that you don't feel me, well come a little closer. [come here! ]
I'll show you what a gangsta look like; at least supposed tah. [look at me]
My blunt is filled with very deadly weed, I call it dro;
My eyes, stay low like a gay dudes in the mens bathroom [no homo]
Do you marvel at my flow, or shiver at my genius? [yes]
You think of STD's from all the hickeys on my penis
We let the beat live, these other rappers are a bore
I kill so many tracks; they recognize me at the morgue. [that's him! ]
Bought a 20 pack of Trojans on my last trip to the store
I did a show that night and had to go the next day to buy more. [balling]
You can test me if you want, examination if you choose;
But my Glock will leave your shirt, looking like Dorothy's shoes. [POP POP! ]
No little Dorothy, see home is a place that I can't go. [Jackson, Mississippi]
... After a couple puffs, I'm somewhere over the rainbow
I have these hoes afraid to take a look into there mirrors
Skeet something on their faces that resembles aloe vera. [ah skeet skeet]
Reply to the officer, that's parsley on my seat
We pass the blunt to one another like batons at a track meet. [yeah]
Exactly; I know just what you peons are thinking. [what's that]
""Mississippi niggas ain't shit...""
I don't see haters like I'm blinking. [yaa dig! ]
My money keeps on growing, while your fan base keeps shrinking. [yeah! ]
You wish you were a psychic, so you could rap just what I'm thinking"

Double Up,Cam'ron,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Production by Darrell “Digga” Branch]

[Verse 1]
Yo y'all niggas with the muscle y'all get clapped in the tussle
I'm a hustler, not a rapper, it's just that rap is my hustle
Show a Digga know yo
We the first teen millionaires in Harlem since Rich and Po
You don't know? Get to know
Ain't takin shit to blow, Jenny Jones, Rock N Jock
Right back to the block to clock, it ain't hop and scotch
It's pop and scotch, in a bar they go shot for shot
Matter of fact, outside the bar they go shot for shot
Me and my co-D on a O-Z, we go rock for rock
Me and my co-D on a rolli we go rock for rock
You souped up, think I'm easy to touch
Then you been watchin' a little bit of TV, too much
Lots of rhymes, so you see my ass lots of times
On the corner still, like I ain't got a dime
Autographs not the kind to be signing the crap
Here's a CD, slash here's a dime of this crack
[Hook]
Nigga double up, keep all guns double clutch
Shoot at yo feet, make you jump like double dutch
New York baby for you matchbox niggas
Chicken wing, french fry, snack box niggas

[Verse 2]
I know looking at my jewelry is scarring yo brain
Not to mention Jada Pinkett over parking the range
(Yo that's Will Smith girl) naw she's part of my chain
Pardon my game, car gettin washed in the rain
Runnin yo trap, that'll get you one in yo back
The hood that I had, had to take the good with the bad
Like Joe on the run, plus his fuckin P.O. it's done
Low on his funds, had to get the coke or the guns
Word to the wise, killa Cam, I heard of them guys
Diplomat, crisp black, yo convertible fives
Rims on the wheel, to drive down shows in the South
Rap ain't that great neither, I got coke to give out
Stroke to give out, motherfuckin smoke to give out
Hoes to give out, naw we ain't over this route
Back on the street, Jimmy get the crack on the street
Tour over motherfucker let's get back on our feet

[Hook]
[Verse 3: Juelz Santana]
I fucked up let the streets got a hold of me
Now they got me trapped in and they holdin me
I'm stressed out, why else would I smoke the weed
Everyday papi tell me he got coke for cheap
Broke as shit, thats why I hold the fifth
Send niggas to snatch your chain and choke your bitch
Rope your nigga, leave em with an open liver
I'm the reason why its gonna get cold this winter
I done seen niggas standin on these blocks for days
Pump work out of buildings, dimes and treys
Fuck A&R's that want me to dance and pose
I rather stand on poles with grams and o's
White shirt, construction timbs, a pair Girbaud's
And white powder stuff, that'll clear ya nose, faggot

[Verse: Joe Budden & (God)]
Look, I woke up without a heart beat
But I remember we was just in the car deep
Was at a light and got approached by a car thief
He pulled out but didn't ask for no car keys
A loud noise without a voice but I'm tryna scream out shit is not fair
I can't tell you where I'm at or how I got here
Surrounded by all white, maybe it's just cloudy
Escorted by two men who knew everything about me
Both of them so strong, kept saying ""hold on""
Feel like my soul's gone, naked, no clothes on
I know this can't be my fate
I scream ""Wait!"", as they drop me in front of a gate
They left no trace, I can see my every breath
Like a cold day, stood before a man with no face
He said to me, (""Please don't make this any harder"")
""Who the fuck is you?"" (""My child I'm your father"")
""I only got one dad!"" (""Is that a fact to you?
He left you when you was young I brought him back to you
You're real close to heaven, few get to step in
Now tell me what you've done to deserve to be let in?"")
""Look I'm far from a Christian, not big on religion
But ain't done too much wrong my entire time living
Never killed, never tried too, though I been lied to
Was once suicidal, never read the Bible
I always been a care taker tried to nurse people
At times it back fired, hurt people, hurt people
Plus I never use your name in vain
But you should know everything I'm being asked to explain""
(""I know you stole from your mothers purse"") ""You can't count that
That was way back when!"" (""It's still a sin"") ""But I was ten!""
(""You robbed people, stole"") ""Yeah and you made me see jail!""
(""But I also seen you lay your hands on a female
Sold drugs to parents none of that was needed
Abandoned your child, on every girl you cheated
Done wrong to people that only want the best for you
Any time you thought you were alone I was next to you"")
""When it came to baby moms God you gave me the worse one!""
(""But that was your second child Joe, you shouldn't have killed the first one"")
""I ain't have a job, ain't have a pot to piss in""
(""Look I gave you a gift and you made the wrong decision
Held onto resentments even in doing business
I lead by example, I teach forgiveness
Your entry can not be guar-an-teed
Not when you live with anger, envy, greed
Pride, sloth, lust even gluttony
Everything you shouldn't if you woulda joined my covenant"")
""Look I'm only human, I ain't perfect""
(""That I understand, when I take you out a jam
You don't even think to worship
And when you do, you never talk about what you can do for me
It's what I can do for you
I blessed you with health, family and wealth
With all the blessings you received you still always want help"")
""Yeah, there's been times in my life, I needed help to make money
But why everything I love you manage to take from me?
Yet you stand there an question a nigga that tries hard
And finds a way when you keep dealing them fucked up cards
You make mistakes like me far as I can see
I think its a mockery whenever rich niggas win the lottery
Gave us Bush twice, God, I hate to be rude
But you let skinny niggas starve, give obese niggas food
The nerve of you telling me I don't deserve to stay here
When you gave us drugs and guns, you put AIDS here!
Take a look at you, your actions are cold hearted
The harsh shit is you bring babies in the world retarded
I know most my actions put me in a cell
But how you mad at me when you put me into hell""
(""See my child, you need gratitude, maybe just a sample
I never give a person anything they can't handle
Don't tell me about everything you had to go through
There's reasons for my actions even if I never showed you
Kept trying with you, all you did was hurt me
Still gave you chances to prove that you was worthy
And so I sat with you on a train
I asked you for change, you kept calling me names
Prolly didn't notice I was the store clerk
You put the gun to me, get money for more work
My child, I know you have it in you to indeed stop
This is not your final calling just a brief stop
Hope you heed my words and understandSo when I send you back you should be a better man
Look at life different the next time we see each other
There'll be no need for talk whenever we meet each other"")"
Large on the Streets,Lloyd Banks,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse]
Memory drops from blood shed
Sour dough, 'nuff bread
In position of power though, chumps dead
Backstabbers and cowards get trunk beds
I'm violent when unfed, P-L's'll give the challengers bump heads
Met him, didn't mean it, shouldn't have said it
Insults are remembered, we all looking to set it
Don't play with me, you’ll regret it
Cause I target the man before the edit
Leave you like hard tops, beheaded
I keep cream, the pistol's my street team
Triples on my sweet beam
Crystals in my lap, I’m a beach dream
The skyscraper, South Jamaica to foreign paper
I dominate ya, my shine shows a thousand acres
I knocked 7 bitches down in Vegas
Knock 7 pictures down, I’m famous
I gotta work
Congratulate me with a lot of purp'
I’m straight as a collar shirt, money to the collar bone, gotta hurt
Million-dollar condo windows, my view spotless
New watches; can't see over my shoe boxes
I hold a big grudge, can’t maintain no cool conscience
Smooth offense, high middle the news conference
New sponsors, hoes trickin' from how I dick em'
Ten orgasm’s more they gon' powder six him
She ever had a grimey thought I shook it out her system
On cloud nine I smoke like a politician
Southside! Yellin' it every rhyme I’m spitting
Pop eyes and long sides from rides driven
Lil homie been smokin', he 11 now
Product of the same neighborhood, hope it don’t let him down
Don't go poppin' off your mouth, horror show and I go loco
Lloyd lost in time, hear my nineteen-ninety fo' flow
Came with the yellow
Gardener with the Rose Gold
Him with the platinum crush ice, give your nose cold
Trainer with the raps
Dirty boxer with the low blows
Famous for my tats
Keep straps for you and so so
Flat line, I put a MC to rest
Chipped up shoulder, ill like the Fila F
They gave me some of what's mine, feel like I need the rest
Middle the summer's my shine, bricks of reefer stress
I got 'em hoppin' out of character
My gun caliber will lift a babbler
Bars hard as Africa
Karma’s a trafficker, her challenge is a root statistic
Pardon my picnic, toolie on, Mr. Fix It
My ups and downs got me lookin' at these bitches different (fuck 'em)
Starin' at my dad and these pictures twisted
I ain't your normal, my shit terrific
I figured I warn you, the bigger ticket
You big ball of corn you
I hope it’s on you, Lord knows a nigga push me
I sit him on wheels, all you get is midget pussy
Cookies
Oh your spot snatched, I pop back
Radio hijack, get it all 'fore I die rap
My contacts help draggin' you on my soundtrack
Border built for combat, two-ten and beyond that"

Buyin' drinks for my niggas
Hoes sellin' they souls just to be with us
On the road with winners, champions
Ride smokin' weed to myself the only reason they stress
Because I'm on the level you can't be in
And I flick the middle finger to fake friends
We live like when the loyalty is strong you can't bend

Welcome to motherfuckin' Detroit, goddamn it
Wonder Boy, shit
Yeah, yeah, Tricky
Let's show 'em some love!
Welcome to Detroit!

[Chorus: Eminem]
Where's my gangstas and all my thugs?
Throw them hands up and show us some love
And uh, welcome to Detroit city
I said welcome to Detroit city
Every place, everywhere we go
Man, we deep everywhere we roll
Ask around and they all know Tricky
That's what's good, man, they all say Tricky

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Click click boom, just as soon as we hit the room
You can hear 'em holla ""Goon Sqwad!"" in this bitch
Let me hear you holla ""Goon Sqwad!"" in this bitch
Let me hear you holla ""Runyon Ave!"" in this bitch
So who am I gonna call on when I ain't got them boys with me
And the situation gets a little sticky?
I'ma dial 911 like a motherfuckin' punk
Fuck that, Blood Blood, I'ma call that rude boy from Detroit
Trick Trick, quick, come pick me up
Bring them guns, come to the club, meet me out front
There's some chump up in this bitch
Poppin' some junk ‘cause he's drunk
And we may have to fuck his ass up
‘Cause uh, somethin' smells a lil fishy
And I don't like the way his boys keep lookin' at me
So homie, come get me
Wonder Boys, what up though, I see you
Rock Bottom, yeah, I see you
All my Detroit people, where you at?
Man, let me see them hands in the sky
Detroit, motherfuckers, till we die

Ask around and they all know Tricky
That's what's good, man, they all say Tricky

[Verse 2: Trick Trick]
Homie, it's been a long time comin' and I'm straight with that
Marshall done called me to fifty-four and so I laced the track
This lil' beat that you hear him bangin'? He produced it himself
My bad, almost forgot to introduce myself
My name is Trick Trick, head of the Goon Sqwad and gangsta
Been bangin' the underground since ninety-five with bankers
Elected to be the villain and certified as a menace
Holdin' it down since I paroled up outta prison
You heard about me, you just didn't know it was me
All the treacherous evil deeds of the D? Yeah, that was me
Pickin' that kid up in the game, I just wasn't chasin' the fame
I been chasin' the paper product and givin' lames the pain
Those accusations of violence, you know you done heard of that
Just a quarter of a million dollars for beatin' a murder rap
Wonder Boy holdin' me up, Shady done put it out
Trick Trick and Eminem, Detroit back in the house
[Chorus: Eminem & Trick Trick]
Where's my gangstas and all my thugs?
Throw them hands up and show some love
And uh, welcome to Detroit city
I said welcome to Detroit city
Every place, everywhere we go
Man, we deep everywhere we roll
Ask around and they all know Tricky
That's what's good, man, they all say Tricky

[Verse 3: Trick Trick]
And yo Em, you ever need one of these weapons, come get it
From now on every beef that you get in, homie, I'm in it
I been ridin' for this city, whether wrong or right
I been woopin' on motherfuckers for the longest time
So it's evident, it's time for Trick to get it fast
The public, see, they appreciate my criminal past
Authorities tried to stop me but they couldn't keep frontin'
Got a fan-base that's bigger then an average star
I'm satisfied with it being my time to shine
And I freak from the precinct for violent crimes
I ain't sayin' the shit that I'm sayin' so girls can feel me
Only speakin' on what I know so that the world can hear me
So peace to Jimmy and Dre for signin' my nigga
He reached back to Detroit and grabbed the winner
So the gangstas and thugs, we embrace with love
And beat the hell outta anybody that fuck with us
[Chorus: Eminem]
Where's my gangstas and all my thugs?
Throw them hands up and show some love
And uh, welcome to Detroit city
I said welcome to Detroit city
Every place, everywhere we go
Man, we deep everywhere we roll
Ask around and they all know Tricky
Ask what's good, man, they all say Tricky

[Outro: Trick Trick & Eminem]
Yeah, Trick Trick

It's goin' down, baby
Ayo Em, I got yo' back, my nigga
Damn right I said ""my nigga""

Welcome to Detroit
Come back soon
Sorry we missed you

Love Is Blind,Eve,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Ayo, I don't even know you and I hate you
See all I know is that my girlfriend used to date you
How would you feel if she held you down and raped you?
Tried and tried, but she never could escape you
She was in love and I'd ask her how, I mean why?
What kind of love from a nigga would black your eye?
What kind of love from a nigga every night make you cry?
What kind of love from a nigga make you wish he would die?
I mean, shit, he bought you things and gave you diamond rings
But them things wasn't worth none of the pain that he brings
And you stayed, what made you fall for him?
That nigga had the power to make you crawl for him
I thought you was a doctor, be on call for him
Smacked you down 'cause he said you was too tall for him, huh
That wasn't love, baby girl, you was dreamin'
I could have killed you when you said your seed was growin' from his semen

[Chorus]
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find
[Verse 2]
I don't even know you and I'd kill you myself
You played with her like a doll and put her back on the shelf
Wouldn't let her go to school and better herself
She had a baby by your ass and you ain't giving no help
Uh-huh, big time hustler, snake motherfucker
One's born every day and every day she was your sucker
How could you beat the mother of your kids?
How could you tell her that you love her, but don't give a fuck if she lives?
She told me she would leave you, I admit it she did
But came back, made up a lie about you missing your kids
Sweet kisses, baby ain't even know she was your mistress
Had to deal with fist fights and phone calls from your bitches
Floss like you possessed her, tellin' me to mind my business
Said that it was her life and stay the fuck out of it
I tried and said just for him I'll keep a ready clip

[Chorus]
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find

[Verse 3]
I don't even know you and I want you dead
Don't know the facts but I saw the blood pour from her head
See I laid down beside her in the hospital bed
And about two hours later, doctors said she was dead
Had the nerve to show up at her mother's house the next day
To come and pay your respects and help the family pray
Even knelt down on one knee and let a tear drop
And before you had a chance to get up, you heard my gun cock
Prayin' to me now, I ain't God but I'll pretend
I ain't start your life but nigga, I'ma bring it to an end
And I did, clear shots and no regrets, never
Cops comin' lock me under the jail
Nigga, whatever my bitch, fuck it, my sister
You could never figure out even if I let you live
What our love was all about
I considered her my blood and it don't come no thicker
[Chorus]
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find"
Tried By Millions Freestyle,Chop,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
I ain't a comedian nigga, I don't got no beef with nobody
I ain't the son of a rapper, I ain't the Illuminati
I ain't a lesbian, I don't wear wigs or nothin' like that

[Verse 1]
I ain't an autistic rapper, I ain't no trapper
I ain't no Ken doll, I ain't no actor
Just a grimy ass nigga raised on Ol' Dirty Bastard
That won't sell his soul so the dough come faster
I ain't no female, I ain't been robbed
I've never been in prison, gettin' fucked in the yard
I've never been a druggie, never suffered withdrawal
And everything I wear probably come from the mall
See, I ain't no fly dude, ain't no tycoon
I ain't in Best Buy, I ain't on iTunes
I don't skateboard, and I don't try to
I'm the sickest nigga out, and I ain't gon lie to 'em
I ain't on the down-low, I only like women
And I fuckin' hate trannies, ain’t a sham, and ain’t religious
Don't know how to dance and all my lyrics written
I probably need a new job, it probably ain't spittin'
I don't gotta ad-lib, don't got a hit
But I'll never get punked on, I do got a dick
Fuck a basic lifestyle I choose not to get
And don't ask me for nothin', I don't freestyle shit
Don't get robbed for my chain, and I don't got a sex tape
But I got some pictures of my dick to make your bitch faint
I don't wear skinnies and I do like Biggie
I do like Big L, I do like Fifty
90's born, mighty flowin', nigga with the Nikes on
Highly gone, waking up to party like a Hyphy song
Like to flaunt, niggas mics is blown tryna write napalm
We don’t like you, dawg, I been on more tracks than Tiger Balm
Style fell off, now they hop on that next shit
I rather keep my belt on, I ain't that desperate
I ain't no Blood, I ain't got a message
I do it for the chicks, dawg, I ain't that sexist
Not a Freemason, I'm not famous
Never fucked Kat Stacks or played for the Lakers
I ain't the best, mayne, and I ain't did it
I ain't a porn star, ain't get beat by Trick Trick
I ain't Big Meech, I ain't Larry Hoover
I ain't Kid Cudi, and I don't like rumors
I ain't no Crip, and I ain't no dyke
I won't tell ya'll to hide your kids or hide your wife
I never made a video of me in a shower
Just a 90's baby with a case of nostalgia
I ain't tatted up, and I ain't no coward
Don't make songs in minutes, it might take me an hour
I don't spend close to ten stacks on marijuana
Got my own good music and it ain't common
I don't drink syrup, I don't got a grill
Death I don't fear though, if I stop taking pills
I ain't a son of Will, and I don't throw bills
I ain't been shot but at least a nigga real

Somebody Already Broke My Heart,Sade,"['jazz', 'r&b', 'blues']","[Verse 1]
You came along when I needed a Savior
Someone to pull me through somehow

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been torn apart so many times
I've been hurt so many times before
So I'm counting on you now

Somebody already broke my heart
Somebody already broke my heart

Here I am
So don't leave me stranded
On the end of a line
Hanging on the edge of a lie

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been torn apart so many times
I've been hurt so many times before
So be careful and be kind

Somebody already broke my heart
If someone has to lose, I don't want to play
Somebody already broke my heart
No, no I can't go there again

Deceiving,Drake,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Drake: talking]
I don't even need a note pad for this one right here man
Shut the lights off
Let the mind work ya know
I'd like to ummm
I'd like to take the time to dedicate this to a special somebody
Guess I'll call her my most recent addition to my collection to female disappointments

[Verse 1:]
Deceiving you are the reason that
I don't believe in finding the love that I need and
I'm Uncle Phil I switch wifey like every season
So I guess that makes you Aunt Viv
Until you take from me till the point that you can't give
And when I see you out I pass by it's offensive
But what you expect though
Kinda direct yo
Cause all that Dolce and Gabana shit was expensive
I told ya
Mr. Edwards I tried to save your daughter
But she wasn't satisfied with none of the things that I bought her
And wasn't tryna show up none of the places that I brought her
And couldn't utilize none of the things that I taught her
So I was just tryna upgrade you
I ain't ya understudy thats tryna upstage you
I was ya other buddy that tried to front page you
Crown you
Get to know the people that surround you
Funny to think that I woulda white gowned you
Cause now we sit around the studio and clown you
Oops did I let that slip
Oh my bad did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick
[Hook:]
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)

[Verse 2:]
Deceiving you are the reason that
When it gets cold in November seems like it's freezing
And I fit every stereotype that y'all believe in
Cause when I say I'm serious you claim you're only teasin
I planned a trip to the tropics that you missed
So when I'm speakin you only in topic when I'm pissed
And in a couple years I guarantee you'll be thirsty
And by then I'll be lookin like Tropicana twist
What up Tessa I love you like my own mama
And ya daughters getting grown mama
And me I'm just here workin' waitin' patient
For her to be ready for to love and leave her drama
Cause I don't really wanna fight no more
And I don't wanna diss niggas when I write no more
And I don't wanna bring chicks to the crib
To watch a flick in the basement on the bed with dim lights no more
Now I'm losing a feeling
You losing appealing
You need to step it up like prints from shoes on the ceiling
Oh damn did I let that slip oh my fault did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick
[Hook:]
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)

[Verse 3:]
My first reaction was damn girl
How did I swing you?
I wanted you forever now I'm something you cling to
But you was my angel, Seems like ya wings grew
Unaware you was outta state doin' ya thing too
Sayin' to my self you deceiving
You are the reason that I don't believe in finding the love that I need
In fact I know you always be lyin' when u be leavin'
Goin' to visit family promise me you ain't cheatin'
A sure thing just might fail you
Women often conduct themselves just like males do
They huddle in a group and joke about the fact that you a soft nigga
How you think cuddling with is cute
They laugh at how you think you last when you really don't
And make u think u get the ass when you really won't
And dudes do that and why these hoes stealin' it
They doin the same shit with a better job at concealin' it
So sign your name on a prenupt and then initial
She only messin with a rapper if it's beneficial
Opps did I let that slip oh my bad did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick
[Hook:]
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)

[Drake: talking]
Feel like uh
I feel like we back man (yeah)
It's like See, see the problem with these other brothers is that they makin love songs
We makin beyond and above songs you know what I'm sayin
We sayin real stuff we not bitter it's life you know
If ya'll females would pull it together
Maybe we would have something better to talk about"
Joe Metro,Blue Scholars,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Geo]
I reach beneath the skin of the street with each step
Walkin' closer to my final destination of death
When I'm layin' to rest, I'm only savin' my breath
The Northwest fills the lungs, heals the pain in my chest
Take six quarters out of the pocket
Drop it in the box
Hop the 48, off to pay homage
It stops often, I jot my observations, watchin'
Citizens walkin' off of the Joe Metropolitan
Proletariats and wayward sons
With old Filipino men speakin' in they native tongue
And the day is just begun
Greeted by the scent of a bum
Smelling something like beer, barf, and dung
A brother in repose in the back all alone
Marinatin' in a pair of half-broken headphones
Mumbling rhymes
Same time begin to pen mine
Appreciating God's design
Rewind sister
Reminds me of a smile in the back of my memory
Wonder if I'll see her again
Will she remember me?
""I'm not tryin' to holler, I swear
I'm just weary of the way we hop a ride and just sit there and stare.""
Prepare for my nine o' clock work meeting
A couple pale folks slide right by with no greeting
But the people with my phenotype follow with a head-nod up
Because we acknowledge that the shit's fucked up
North of Martin Luther King, a straight war zone
Detours through the concrete, cranes, and bulldozers
No, the Hill is not over still
Every block got a coffee shop; it's overkill
Focus, know the deal
Dope to see Kalil back, the medicine is good again
The feeling of leaving and coming back to your hood again
It's priceless, I write this, our lives are in crisis
Most talk, but don't walk, the path of the righteous
Despite this I measure each step
Walkin' closer to my final destination of death
When I'm layin' to rest, I'm only savin' my breath
The Northwest fills my lungs, heals the pain in my chest
Clutch the moment, a transfer in my hand
Still listening
Lookin' out the window to the gold and the green
And the sun might be shinin' but it's colder than it seems
'Cuz the weather's dialectical: there's no in-between
In walks an old soul
A First Nation native, cat's chiseled like a totem pole
No words, as he stands and looks over us
He gets off and says, ""Have a good day, you foreigners.""
I, crack a smile one time for the acknowledgement
Northbound, now we start to pick up more college kids
They try to study on the ride
To make up for the fact that they probably kicked it hard last night
And I ponder if it's time to save up and get a car
And pay for the gas that we're takin' from the war
I'd miss all the colorful faces, the places, and spaces I've embraced with
The faith that I can rest and raise kids here even with these cats set
Trippin'
Bringin' '95 back again, same old conditions
From Reagan, to Bush, to Clinton, to the Bush the second
No matter the neighborhood in the city you're reppin'
It's gettin' serious y'all
You can even hear the rebel call
Gettin' off, leavin' hella pieces on the walls
Seen it all, sittin' sideways with my townmates
Only place left where majority is brown-faced
Now we headed downtown to trade our labor for cash
I thank the navigator once and walk fast
I walk past the next round of cats to jump on it
Locked in deep thought, we ride around in silence
And cross Rizal Bridge
I watch each step, walkin' closer to my final destination of death
When I'm layin' to rest, I'm only savin' my breath
The Northwest fills the lungs, heals the pain in my chest
I remain blessed, steppin' on rain with each step
Eyes heavy from the lack of the cousin of death
When I'm layin' to rest, I'm only savin' my breath
The Northwest fills the lungs y'all, you know the rest
[Outro]
You know the rest, you know the rest, you know the rest
It's like that y'all, that y'all, it's like that y'all, that y'all
And that's all"

And we don't eat up in our whips, but they got paper plates

Alright, I got this, you can never get this

Thousand-dollar sweater on, but I don’t never sweat shit
Swear the beats they give me got a motherfuckin’ death wish
Yeah, tell me, who controls kings?
I don't follow rules, stupid old things
I'm flyin' through the city in a coupe with those wings
And my team deserves some motherfuckin' Super Bowl rings

And every day, I be back and forward to the blood bank
Ugh, makin' deposits 'til I fucking faint
New Orleans, nigga: How 'bout them fucking Saints?
It's tight on our end, call that ""Bubba Franks""
Matter-fact, it's too tight—add a couple links
I'm the bar’s tender, you a woman drink
Yeah, it's Young Money, but the money ain't
Gudda tough, 'Nelly nice, Nick' nasty

No Rest For The Weary,Blue Scholars,"['alternative', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
There's no rest for the weary just another day grinding up stones
Till they turn into dust, it's tough times in the rough
Diamonds ain't enough to cover up a corrupted and fucked up legacy of strange fruit
Bloody whips and small pox, trigger-happy cops
Barbed wire and fire water, y'all it don't stop
When the colonizer came with the cross and the sword
I threw the first spear and said ""I declare war!""
I'm a battle-scar wearing heir apparent
Descendants of a long lineage of proletariat and peasant
So check the work ethic and the name
The lessons might change but the essence of the message is the same

[Chorus]
So when they say anything
Say ""why is it?""
Class is in session 'til the teacher gets a pink slip
I ride the rhythm imbibe a little whine talk
Head get the concrete inline wit' your spine

[Verse 2]
I speak to find peace but it's war all the time
It's deep like the drive from Renton to Shoreline
I'm a more mindful guy ever since finding out that
I'm about to be a father and doubt is not an option
And now I can't be getting crunk and faded as often
So get your hands dirty cause a prayer ain't enough
Boss, what cross?
We got crucified by buckshots
One million Jesuses and >Judas got his nuts off
Pages torn out the memory of those who remain shackled
In the chains of international capital gain
They claim civilize with they animal ways
Peace to Oakland, I've never been a fan of the A's
But some days you can find me inscribing my
Soul on the page every crime has an alibi
Disciplined and organized is how I handle my
New jacks are spending mad time on their battle rhymes
I can't knock it if you find it entertaining
I rep those whose labor ain't compensated
So check the work ethic and the name
The lessons might change but the essence of the message is the same
[Chorus]
So when they say anything
Say ""why is it?""
Class is in session 'til the teacher gets a pink slip
Forty to a class, no wonder we delinquent
Half the school district never make it to commencement

[Verse 3]
I bent the spine of the track until it snaps
Pops working overtime and he got a broken back
Got three little sisters, one brother in Iraq
And mom prays novenas to keep the fam intact
But the song ain't a song waiting for God to answer
Brothers call me ""Dog"", they got the letters backwards
I'm back with a plan of attack to repossess my
Name, face, and history y'all who wanna test
My capacity to spit caliber shit into a rhythmic lesson
And entertainment's a legitimate weapon
Igniting the cipher sessions I'm deciphering life
And blended both theory into practice I write
Vernacular and actual fact
Got no posturing
A thousand pointing fingers I defied every one of them
I ride for my brother who carry the burden
Of a future uncertain 'til the fall of the curtain
You better move
Hold your head high soldier, it ain't over yet
That's why we call it a struggle
You're supposed to sweat
Check the work ethic and the name
The lessons might change but the essence of the message is the same
[Chorus]
So when they say anything
Say ""why is it?""
Class is in session 'til the teacher gets a pink slip
Crazy landlady tried to switch up on the lease
If she raises up the rent again it's time to say ""peace""

[Outro]
Peace, peace and that's my piece
It's still all about the bullet in the belly of the beast
From the East my brother we came
The lessons might change but the essence of the message is the same
So when they say anything
Say ""why is it?""
Class is in session 'til the teacher gets a pink slip
So keep marching 'til your feet split open
""No Rest For The Weary"" Blue Scholars keep going"

I'm a feminine Eminem, a slim shady lady
But nice, 'cause I texted Haiti
90 lady cops in the road
And I'm arrested for doing 80
Like Hamlet, all about ""words, words, words""
Divide a whole into thirds, thirds, thirds
I'm a gay sea otter:
I blow other dudes out of the water
I'm the man muffin, diving, muffin'
Cold and fly like an arctic puffin
Puffing whacky tobaccy
Hating other rappers like I'm Helga Pataki
And I've been rocking this mic before electricity
Way back in 1000 BCE -
That's before the common era (era, era, era, era, era, era, ah)
I can't be stopped
Flow so sick that it should be mopped up
Chick's got a dixie cup
I gotta dick full of helium; I'll fuck you up
A boy, a girl, a middle aged bitch
Botox in the third person
I give the perspective a switch and
Bo talks in the third person
Ooh, just relax; if you wanna know me, here's two facts

I hate catchy choruses and I'm a hypo-crite
I hate catchy choruses and I'm a hypocrite

Met a girl named Macy, had sex with her all day
But she was dyslexic, so I ended up doing the YMCA
We ballin', Asian, Wii bowling,
Prostate cancer semi-colon
Find that hole like I'm Stephen Hawking
Atticus Finch, killing, mocking
Cry like a child would
You raped my childhood
Just stroll in, roll in your pole into Rolie Polie Olie's colon
To relax my mind
I take a walk by the clock and I pass the time and
Rhyming, mathematical timing
Syntax impacts the intact hymen
I'm an internet provider
Came from the web like a horny spider
Fucked a girl in an apple orchard
Then came in cider
I thought AIDS was a butt virus
Like conjunction junction conjunctivitis
I spit gold bars 'cause I was
Molested by my uncle Midas
Gay dads blow pops, another sucker
Oedipus was the first motherfucker

We the people of the USA
José, we're not talking to you, esé
We got a border in order to keep you out
It's what my NYU essay's about
'Cause we're, xenophobic warrior princess
Molested by my Uncle Sam, is that incest?
""I WANT YOU"" to smell my finger
Does my nephew's scent still linger?
South of queers, north of hell
The queer ones suck and the brown ones smell
We guard the border and we guard it well
But some slip through the cracks of the liberty bell
Did I say liberty? I meant taco
Paco, hey I better let that rock go
'Cause in real life Goliath wins
And then sells all the silk that the widow spins
One more time!

Make me want better jewels, a newer ride
Louboutin shoes, she got too much pride
Her feet are killing her, I call it shoe-icide
Looking good has it's sacrifices
Chilly weather bring four figure jacket prices

Give you that iPhone 4, face time

Enough class for wine, still handle Patron

Can't fault her, the last nigga spoiled her
But he ain't beat it up, I assault her
Shoulda seen her come to me when I called her
Slow strut like she walking to the altar
Hand bag on her arm cost four bills

Often imitated, never duplicated

I just met her so the next solution
Dead my old chick, execution

Old Days,Big Snap (Rapper),"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Straight gangster on a path to destruction I see
Where lil' homies learning to live the life of a G
Mid-west, West Coast, two sides, one life
In the jungle, on the hill, park or block in the night
'69 to '79 was when foundation was laid
Up until the year '89 is when the dues were all paid
In the day was revolution like the Panthers of then
It wasn't kept in progress, now there's violence, homies in pen
The doors were opened, now there closed, like a pimp and a hoe
We used to sport them chucks, with khakis, acey-duecys and more
We sung a song, what was it called, on the Fremont High lawn
We used the canes, they called us crippled, now them days are all gone
We used to hustle, now we rustle, over colors and sets
That's how we earned a bad name and why most of them in debt

[Chorus]
Killa Cali, homeland, home of the brave
Back in the days, in '69 foundation was laid
The dues have been paid and still we on the streets with heat
Sparking mad beef, it used to be all about peace
[Verse 2]
Convicted felon as it may be, things get rough at some times
As a BG, po's was always trying to link me to crimes
But they couldn't, 'cause as a youngster I was swift on my feet
Now that I got arthritis in one knee, stay ahead by one beat
As for pumps, I stay strapped, that's for enemy fools
In the days, we used our fists, now catch two with my tool
And the war will never cease until we stop this pollution
End confusion, stop the nonsense, back to revolution

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Though I was born in, I still didn't get put down for a bit
Attempted some hits, at 8 picked up a rag and claimed Crip
Was a pranksta, not a gangsta, got put down by Big Blue
Because he recognized the talent, knew I wasn't no fool
Not even from the block or hood, but met up with the crew
Rep the set that spreads from Oakland to Riverside in blue
More than 10 years later, still a ranger, general pro
You step to me cuzz, you finna catch two holes in your dome

[Verse 1]
Now if there's a smile on my face
It's only there tryin’ to fool the public
But when it comes down to foolin’ you
Now, honey, that's quite a different subject
But don't let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Really I'm sad
(Sad, sad, sad, sad)
Oh, sadder than sad
(I'm hurt so bad)
You're gone, and I'm hurtin' so bad
(I pretend to be glad)
Like a clown, I pretend to be glad
(Sad, sad, sad, sad)

Now there's some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around
Mmm-hmm, oh yeah, baby

[Verse 2]
Now if I appear to be carefree
It's only to camouflage my sadness
In order to shield my pride, I’ve tried
To cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But don't let my show convince you
That I've been happy since you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Decided to go
(Why did you go?)
Oh, I need you so
(I need you so)
I'm hurt and I want you to know
(Want you to know)
But for others I put on a show

There's some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around
Oh yeah

Just like Pagliacci did (The great pretender)
I try to keep my sadness hid
Smiling in the public eye (The great pretender)
But in my lonely room, I cry

[Chorus]
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby

[Outro]
Now if there's a smile on my face (Tears of clown)
Don't let my glad expression (Tears of a clown)

Don't let this smile I wear (Tears of a clown)

Owwwwww! Yeah! My niggas, ahah
Throw your hands in the air right now, man!
Feel this shit right here, Scott Storch, nigga
Yeah Khaled, I see you nigga, ShowBiz, Born Lord
Uh, yeah, uh, yo

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
I don't give a fuck about your faults or mishappens
Nigga, we from the Bronx, New York; shit happens
Kids clappin', love to spark the place
Half the niggas in the Squad got a scar on their face
It's a cold world and this is ice
Half a mil' for the charm, nigga, this is life
Got the Phantom in front of the building, Trinity Ave
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad
As a youngin, was too much to cope with
Why you think, muh'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit?
Should've been called Armed Robbery
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle
Just as long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble
Came out the gate on some Flo-Jo shit
Fat nigga with the shotty was the logo, kid
[Chorus: Fat Joe]
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)

Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)

R to the Ezzy, M to the Yzzy
My arms stay breezy, the Don stay flizzy
Got a date at 8, I'm in the 7-4-fizzive
And I just bought a bike so I can ride 'til I die
With a matchin' jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance, we boogie
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies
Listen, we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us
And we walk around the metal detectors
And there really ain't a need for a V.I.P section
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it
Said he, liked my necklace, started relaxin'
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
See, money ain't a thang, nigga, we still the same niggas
Flows just changed, now we 'bout to change the game, nigga
[Chorus: Fat Joe]
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway

Lean back, lean back (come on!)

Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)

Now we living better now, Coogi sweater now
And that G4 can fly through any weather now
See, niggas get tight when you worth some millions
This is why I sport the chinchilla: to hurt they feelings
You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit
Out in Vegas front row to all the fights and shit
If 5-0 boy come then they'd proudly squeal
Cause half these rappers they blow like Derek Foreal
If you cross the line, damn right I'm gon' hurt you
These faggot niggas even made gang signs commercial
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up
B2K Crip walkin' like, ""That's what's up!""
Kay keep tellin' me to speak about the Rucker
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the Rucker
Not even Pee Wee Kirkland could imagine this
My niggas didn't have to play to win the championship

I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back

Only God Can Judge Me,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: 2Pac]
Only God can judge me (That right?)
Only God can judge me now
Nobody else (Nobody else)
All you other motherfuckers get out my business (Really)
Only God can judge me now

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies, just a bunch of dirty rats
Will I succeed? Paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus, try to focus, but I can't see
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time
Look to my future, ‘cause my past is all behind me
Is it a crime to fight for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin', tell me what's the use of tryin'
I've been trapped since birth, cautious ‘cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family in a hearse
And they say it's the White man I should fear
But it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for
Everybody's droppin', got me knockin' on Heaven's door
And all my memories of seein' brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix
‘Cause the media is full of dirty tricks
[Chorus: 2Pac]
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me

[Flatline]

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I hear the doctor standin' over me, screamin' I can make it
Got a body full of bullet holes, layin' here naked
Still I can't breathe, something's evil in my IV
‘Cause everytime I breathe I think they killin' me
I'm havin' nightmares, homicidal fantasies
I wake up strangled, entangled in my bed sheets
I call the nurse ‘cause it hurts to reminisce
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
‘Cause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care?
Try to remember but it hurts
I'm walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to the dirt
I'd rather die like a man than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours
""Black Power!"" is what we scream
As we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama, can you save me? And fuck peace
‘Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
No more hesitation, each and every black male's trapped
And they wonder why we suicidal running 'round strapped
Mr. Police, please try to see
That there's a million motherfuckers stressin' just like me
[Chorus: 2Pac]
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me

[Interlude: 2Pac]
That which does not kill me can only make me stronger
That's for real
And I don't see why everybody feel as though
That they gotta tell me how to live my life
You know?
Let me live, baby, let me live

[Verse 3: Rappin' 4-Tay]
Pac, I feel ya, keep servin' it on the reala
For instance, say a playa-hatin' mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong for buckin' a nigga to the pavement?
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin'
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin' a cross
That's real, got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes, now everybody want him
After talkin' behind my back like a bitch would
Tellin' them niggas, ""You can fade him""
Punk, I wish you would
It be them same motherfuckers in your face
That'll rush up in your place to get your safe
Knowin' you on that paper chase
Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fetti, already sold a ki or ounce
Bitch, remember 2Pac and 4-Tay
The same two brothers dodgin' bullets, representin' the Bay
Pac, when you was locked down, that's when ""I'll Be Around""
Start climbin' up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
That's why they ride the bandwagon
Still be draggin', sellin' lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know y'all in disguise
[Verse 4: 2Pac]
Guess you figure you know me, ‘cause I'm a thug
That love to hit the late night clubs drink them Buds
Been livin' lavish like a player all day
Now I'm 'bout to floss some boss player shit with 4-Tay

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me

[Outro: 2Pac & Rappin 4-Tay]
Only God man
That right?
That’s real
Hahahahahaha
Fuck everybody else, you know what I’m sayin'?
Man, look here, man
My only fear of death
Is comin' back to this bitch reincarnated, man
That’s for the homie mental

Love Is…,Common,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus]
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you know what love is
Even found it on the ground where the thugs live
My man had to dig deep to find his
Couldn't sleep cause on the real he had five kids
Live nig's, real niggas express and taste it
At crap games, black dames and big faces
Cases in court, fam' showing love and support
You and your baby's mom thought that love was a sport
As men we were taught to hold it in
That's why we don't know how 'til we're older men
If love is a place I'ma go again
At least now, now I know to go within
At times it can take ya for a spin
Heartbreak hotel then you're home again
I've seen love make a nigga soul pretend
Like a story that he don't want to end, yo
[Chorus]
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me

[Verse 2]
It's all love where we come from
In the hood love we was told to run from
That same hood where the guns sung
We holla love, hoping it'd become one
Crack got so many lives undone
From lack of love many hide, some run
I knew this girl with a son who dreamt of acting in plays
Demonstration with her man had her trapped in a maze
Trying to find herself again, much of that she'd have gave
Love can free us, to it some of us react as a slave
Funny, we love 'em more when they're relaxed in a grave
Wonder if a thug is raw, is he actin' afraid?
Everybody loves sun, why do I attract shade?
Heard of the love of money, but compassion it pays
Talk about it with my youth so she'd understand
What it is to be loved by a man
[Chorus]
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me

[Verse 3]
Some say that I'm a dreamer 'cause I talk about it often
Seen the hardest nigga soften wit' his homie in a coffin
We walk and stand in, fall in it
With the right companion we all in it
Mary sang a song about it, having broad limits
In the game of life, it's the scrimmage
Reminiscing on letters I wrote in my small days
A letter to the people, love always, yeah

[Chorus]
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me"

Always hit the books but I was tryna hit some ass
Never mowed lawns, but I make green off of grass
Any given night yo we might blow through a half

Started sipping lean, so I stopped going to class
But you can call me ace cause you know I still passed
You fuckin with the don, so when I tell you get back
Better pull a Little Brother before you get your ribs slashed

We ain't studio thugs, I ain't tryna talk smack
Bitches make threats, if you a boss, then you act
If you flossed in the trap and your jaw's still intact
Then I could understand where you got the balls to rap

But your hood hate you, you deserve to be slapped
Take a shot at P Stat and you will get leaned back
Couple bones for my niggas in your home to heat clap
Lick shots at your dome mother fucker, eat that

Cause I ain't got time for none of you broke niggas
If you ain makin gwop then I can't fuck witcha
Get the picture?
I'll spit ya, some real hot truth
Split the top on the coupe
I really do what it do
Last time I came through, everything brand new
But that's another story for y'all to jam to

You know how your man do, I keep them fly mamis
That claim they love me and wanna spend money on me
But you know I'll keep it gully till the day that y'all find me
In my casket with a blunt and a pair of fresh heineys

Til that day, my louisville ride shotty
You can ask anybody in my city, yo they got me
Gettin real cocky cause these niggas like to copy
But they rhymes so sloppy and they girls call me papi

Call me Thiv Armani, fake niggas get bodied
And if I ain't got cash, I still got green on me
Every time I rhyme, every line from my mind
It's like a ray of sunshine, but I'm really on my grind

And as far as trends go, I don't follow 'em, I set 'em
Young nigga but I been ridin round in them Benzes
Windows tinted to the max, the whip's blacked out
They say you shouldn't talk shit if you live in a glass house

But every time I leave the house I just spaz out
Cause niggas talk a lot of shit, but in the end they back out
I'm livin the good life, see my walls, are windows
Your dogs are not my kinfolk, I play bitches like Nintendo
64 but you can catch me in that six-four
With the low trunk and the suicide back doors
My niggas got cash flow just off the raps yo

Paranoid, sitting in a deep sweat
Thinking, I gotta fuck somebody before the week ends
The sight of blood excites me, shoot you in the head
Sit down, and watch you bleed to death
I hear the sound of your last breath
Shouldn't have been around, I went all the way left
You was in the right place for me at the wrong time
I'm a psychopath, in a minute lose my fucking mind
Calm down, back to reality
Don't fear death, cause I know that it's promised to me
Flashes, I get flashes of Jason
Gimme a knife, a million lives I'm wastin'
The shadow of death follows me, I don't give a fuck

Looking through her window, now my body is warm
She's naked, and I'm a peeping tom
Her body's beautiful, so I'm thinking rape
Shouldn't have had her curtains open, so that's her fate
Leaving out her house, grabbed the bitch by her mouth
Drug her back in, slammed her down on the couch
Whipped out my knife, said, ""If you scream, I'm cuttin'""
Opened her legs and commenced the fuckin'
She begged me not to kill her, I gave her a rose
Then slit her throat, and watched her shake till her eyes closed
Had sex with the corpse before I left her
And drew my name on the wall like helter skelter
Run for shelter never crossed my mind
I had a gauge, a grenade, and even a nine
Dial 911 for the bitch
But the cops ain't shit when they're fucking with a lunatic
[Verse 3: Scarface]
I sit alone in my four-cornered room staring at candles
Dreaming of the people I've dismantled
I close my eyes and in a circle
Appears the images of sons of bitches that I murdered
Flashbacks of bodies being fucked up
Once I attack, I'm like a pit on a rage that's going for guts
Boys used to die when I'm full of that fry
I be amping when I'm high
So I say 'fuck' and just let bullets fly
Like I said before, Scarface is my identity
A homicidal maniac with suicidal tendencies
I'm on the violent tip, so yo, get a grip
And bitch, come equipped, ain't taking no shit
Cause here comes a lunatic

[Verse 4: Scarface]
My girl's getting skinny, she's strung out on coke
So I went to her mother's house and cut out her throat
Her grandma was standing there, she was screaming out, ""Brad!""
As she reached for the telly, I put the blade on gran's ass
Went to the back and grabbed a shovel
Now granny's on her way to meet the devil
Pulled out my .38 and aimed at the bitch
A cop says (Freeze, motherfucker!) Bitch, suck my dick
I said, ""Die, motherfuckers!"" as I blasted
Something clicked in my head, visions of bodies in plastic
The scent of buckshots in human flesh
Pigs dying, from bullet wounds to the chest
No sheriff's gonna take me on a road
Dark as fuck, and let his pistols explode
Fuck that, cause I ain'ts to die
So I reloaded my Uzi and fired up another fry
It got me crazy as fuck
A raging psychotic full of that Angel's Dust
The cops had the place surrounded
Hunted for a way to get out - I found it
Innocent bystanders were watching; set an example
I popped one, ""Let me go, goddammit
Scot free
Or all of these mother fuckers coming with me""
All of a sudden the shit got silent
I remember waking up in an asylum
Bein' treated like a troubled kid
My shirt was all bloody, and both of my wrists was slit
Think this is harsh? This ain't as harsh as it gets
No telling what's being thought up in the mind of a lunatic
[Verse 5: Willie D]
November 1st 1966
A damn fool was born with the mind of a lunatic
I should've been killed
But sister fucked around and let me live
Now I developed a criminal behavior
Fuck with me, and I'll slay ya
Ass, beyond recognition shit
Your dental records couldn't prove your identity, bitch
I beg your pardon, on talking to Borden
You'll never find a mother fucker, so save your milk cartons
Cross the line, your ass is mine
I don't give a fuck if you're 9 or 99
Blind, crippled, or crazy, it don't faze me
Your funky ass will be pushing up daisies
You wanna know what makes me click?
My psychiatrist said I got the mind of a lunatic

[Verse6: Willie D]
I ain't got it all, so don't fuck with me
Unless your ass wanna be made history
I'll blow your motherfucking house up
And if your wife and kids are inside, they're fucked
I don't give a damn who I slay
Don't let me get a hold to some E&J
Cause when the shit hit the fan
I'll stab your ass quicker than a Mexican
The nightmares I leave you with on the scene
Will make Freddy bitch ass look like a wet dream
This is fact, not fictional, son of a bitch
I got the mind of a lunatic"

Got the plug from Hershey and Mr. M&M's
And me and Willy Wonka is old school friends

On the triple beam
Little Bruce got the bomb-ass cookies and cream
And I'm serving more kids than Chuck E. Cheese
And a German chocolate cake'll cost you 16 Gs

It's the big time deala
Sucka side killa

Slanging thangs for 16, 9 for half
Got ya flying to the Westside to double up your cash

And got the DAs pissed
They raided my spot
Shot both my pits

Counting hundred thousands in the Lexus clowning

I hit the All-Star Game with a thang my backpack

The Northstar system on 100 spoke Daytons
I smokes big with Rider and Gary Payton
Behind the back door where ballers be livin'
Transactions on nationwide television
[C-Bo:]
I'm down to make G's
Slanging straight cream
In the land of milk and honey
On a mission about the money
Breaking down in quarters
Saran wrappin' across the border
In my 500 Benz behind the '96 Explorer

[B-Legit:]
I pull the keys out my pocket
And I started to G
Bo-Loc back seat strapped down with heat
Track after track
Unit after unit
Running straight through it
It ain't nothing to it
It's kind of like being sprung out on ducks
And when you buy dope you gotta buy it from us

I’m getting hella mail from jail, niggas telling me to kill it
When they get out I’ll bring them ’round some bitches
Shinobi how I kick it, American Ninja, major motion picture
Flipping my remote, same way I do them hoes
But she already know before she touch my Chevy door
Real nigga, let me make it as clear as my windows
No square shall enter in the circle of winners
Know I’m prepared for whatever, if you know what I been through
Rearview, Clear vision, memories of paid dues
Confined to a runway, thunderstorms came thru
But look what it came to, something that amazes you
Soon as you quit hating and hear what I gotta say to you
Baby blue sole. These white 11, ’96
No retro card came with this
Same year, my Impala with the floor shift
4-door suicide, Muscle car chauffeured
Shawty body choco-latte; Russell Stovers
Brung weed with her whenever I invite her over
Polo sweater, Teddy bear hanging off her shoulder
No care, over here, so we put it in the air
Walking ’round my house, say she wanna fuck everywhere
That’s cool baby, but I just got that pool table
We ain’t gotta stay away from it, It’s all good
If you wanna get under it, then I guess I can fuck with it
Before I got on this beat, it made out a bucket-list
In these bars, I granted its deathwish
Legendary lay-up. Jordan with the right-left switch
Hang time, Hand glide, Stir fried, Chanky-eyed, Shanghai
Candy rain, drizzle frame, I ride
’87 Corvette ZR1, took the T-tops off it
Put ‘em in the trunk bitch, all gassed up, she been drinkin’ from the pump
That’s all bad, tryna pass, fucked around and crashed
Bitches all flip, Fools tryna make it last
Emotional luggage, nothing of it, I don’t check bags
I just carry-on, leave that bullshit in the past
Half Rose, Chandon, OJ in my glass
Mimosa, Testarossa program, Countach curriculum
Doors open like a pendulum swinging
Rock in my Jetset Emblem
Fool, it’s the serve, like Wimbledon, interior cinnamon
The car that I’m sittin’ in, Calm my bad nerves, I call her my Ritalin
Just kiddin, not pillin’, just element twistin’
From the Earth come the fire and the wind I’m livin
Not pillin’, just element twistin’
From the Earth come the fire and the wind I’m livin
From the Earth come the fire and the wind I’m livin

I just wanna show you that I can better you
If ever you are feeling you are ready to improve
You ready for a move? We can bust it
I'm talking all emotion, the deepest of discussion
The deepest of your feelings
We can spend a weekend all alone, fully clothed, letting' you know, ain't even tryna hit it
Don't even need to listen to them niggas
You're reaching new heights, and I ain't kiss you just a little
I'll kiss you just a little, I promise it's forever
Highest form of respect, if you say you're not ready
Forever in debt to the lord for he's given
Something I'm not worthy of, the purpose of my livin'
The purpose of these lyrics, the source of my happiness, without you
Nothing in the world seems to matter, my honey (honey, honey, honey)

And I'm M.O.B
I ain't no emo nigga, I do not lean on women
I chase cheese I get it, nothing but cream I'm getting
I just acquire my scratch, I'm Primo wit' it
I got an ego, big enough to let me know
Any chick come around me, is never gon' leave me broke
All this flow that I give em, I live by the code and I'll leave her
I'm bigger than the code, I'm game genie
Shit is easy, these lil bitches need me
And I don't gotta talk about my feelings
So bitch watch your mouth, and wash them dishes after dinner
And wash your little *___* and I'll dig you in a minute…get it
Silly ass nigga right there, he gon' show you that he care, he gon' tell you that he there for you
He gon' tell you what he prepared to do
And I'm the type of muhfucka that'll share you, shoot
Don't 'nar confuse, I ain't a friend of you

Don't 'nar confuse…yeah…when I'm into you BITCH (BITCH – BITCH - BITCH)

(That's not no way to talk to a lady, man)

I know the time get hard, let me be there for ya
Live you & me, I can be the air for ya
I'm in a rare breed, extraordinary league
With anything you need, I'm Jeff Gordon to the scene
According to the stats, darling, we can never be
Fine women love losers, that treat 'em bad and cheap
I'll treat you like a queen, you rather be a slave
I'll show you I'm a gentleman, but you prefer a cave man
Shoe box money, and crumbled up 20's
I'll teach you 'bout equity and real estate honey
For honey, I will live, be a father for the kids
I'll show you there's a few good left that exist
The muse of a Tyler Perry flick that I'm is
You tired of this shit, than you can just sit with me…(however, whenever you want to baby)
My honey…...

(Hold the fuck up man, hold that shit up man, all that soft shit)

Yeah, bitch you need to sit on me
You like my conversation, I know I make you horny
If your hungry, it's still M.O.B
We ain't never 'gon be, I'll be leavin' in the morning
I'm in a rare breed, extraordinary league
Your nothing but a muh fuckin lease (keep it movin)
See these hoes they manipulate
Have you buying liquor, then have you buying dinner 'til it's time to disintegrate
That's why this my mission statement, bitch get it straight
Money over honey, real niggas gon' participate
Thus we eliminate faith
Cuz bitches can manipulate in several different ways
Yeah, I'm close minded, and never gon' change
And keep my account the same way…fuck outta here"

Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy ‘cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted ‘cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut

Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasin', tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real Gs move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side

LoveLives Intro,Reign,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","My name is Reign and I’m a supermarket cashier
…there’s no cash here
So if I did sweat her I guarantee that wasn’t cashmere
…Abercrombie at the most, you see my mom’s white
But pick your battle, and I could kill these rappers on sight
And they say the future’s brighter then we’ve ever seen it
But we’d be better off if some of y’all were never semen
I got a lot of anger weighing on my cardio
So nigga tell your audio sorry if I’m illogical
Lookin at these pretty-eyed obstacles; green light, green light
I want all these hoes..to go
So I can get back to world that I know, that I knew
When me and you was we, and you were never on my left side
We was all right… now I’m in the club in the middle of the night
Searching for the wrong in the middle of the right
Looking at my phone tryna figure should I write?
“Hey girl, what’s up, did you miss me?”
Backspace, backspace: “you forget me?”
Retype, retype: “how could you?”
That’s right, that’s right, I would do
Anything I can, to say I was your man
To say you were my lady, baby this crazy…
Nah, this is way too crazy…No…this is way to crazy! (crazy)
Or maybe I’m just too complicated…
Fucking with hoes and not ever stopping to contemplate it
A wise woman once told me I make no fucking sense
And though she’s right I turned that shit to an argument
So now we arguing…and yeah I’ll probably win
But when I close my eyes I swear hear her talk again
With all the truth she spoke, and she was just hoping I’d change
But I’m stuck in my ways, looking for a way to release this pain
So now I got this drunk bitch in my face
Telling me that I look just like Drake
Kiss me on my neckline, pull me by the waist
Whisper in my ear: “take me back to your place”
Release that fear, and hold tight to the moment
The shit that I’ve done, I would like to condone it
Nah, but I can’t even hold it
Not… without trying to throw it
As far away as I can
Now I’m on the beach with my toes in the sand
Girl in my hand, but I’m not her man
I’m just a way she could find her revenge
Call me a stray with no one to claim me
And still these women find a way they could blame me
Nah…but not you baby, tomorrow you won’t even know me lately
So what’s your name boo?
Nah I couldn’t really hear you
The water’s way too loud for me
Out here on this balcony
With so much in common…but nothing to explain for
Baby girl lay down…and get what we came for
And when I roll over on my side
Catch a glimpse of the sunrise
Guilt creeps into my mind
But the clock still says that it’s my time
And they tell me that young is how the good die
So is that why the doves cry?
But we just keep on smiling, and think about our love-lives…"

And Red Alert was puttin' in work, with Chuck Chill
Had my homies on the hill gettin' ill, when shit was real
Went out to steal
Remember Raw, with Daddy Kane?
When De La Soul was puttin' Potholes in the game
I can't explain how it was, Whodini
Had me puffin on that buddha gettin' buzzed, 'cause there I was
Them block parties in the projects and on my block
You diggy don't stop sippin' on that Private Stock

I had, Shell Toes, and BVD's
A killer crease inside my Lee's when I hit the streets
I'm playin' skelly, Ringolevio, or catch a kiss
Before the homies in my hood learned to smack a bitch
I remember way back, the weak weed they had
Too many seeds in the trey bag
I'm on the train headin' uptown, freestyling
With some wild kids from Bucktown, profilin'
'Cause the hoochies was starin', thinkin' ""what them niggas wearin'?""
I'm wonderin' if that's her hair, I remember
Stickball, humpin' hoochies on the wall
Or takin' leaks on the steps, stinkin' up the hall
Through my childhood, wild as a juvenile
A young nigga tryna stay away from Rikers Isle
Me and my homies breakin' nights, tryna keep it true
Out on the roof sippin' 90 proof, ain't nuttin' like the old school

Remember poppin' and lockin' to Kurtis Blow, the name belts
And Scott LaRock the Super Ho back in Latin Quarter
When Slick Rick was spittin' La Di Da Di
Gamin' the hoochies at the neighborhood block parties
I remember, breakdancin' to Melle Mel
Jekyll and Hyde, LL when he Rocks the Bells
Forget the TV, I'd rather hit the streets and do graffiti
Be careful don't let the transit cops see me

[Outro: 2Pac]
Haha, on the real though
Remember seein' Brooklyn go crazy up in the motherfuckin' party?
Remember motherfuckers used to go, ""Is Brooklyn in the house?""
And motherfuckers would lose they God Damn Mind!
That's the old school to me; that's what I'm sayin' (Super, Sperm)
I remember goin' places that motherfuckers was scared to say
They was from anywhere but Brooklyn; that shit was the bomb
Back in the motherfuckin' old school nigga
Remember skelly, nigga? Knockin' niggas out the box, poppin' boxes?(My Adidas)
Remember stickball? Member niggas to run that shit like that?
Remember the block-- 'Member screamin' up at your moms from the window?
(LL Cool J is hard as Hell...)
The ice cream truck, remember all the mother--
'Member the Italian Ices, yo? Yo, remember the Italian Ices?!
The Spanish Niggas comin' down with the coconut ices and shit?
I came through the door, said it before
That was the shit!"

Now this, this is one of them occasions
Where the homies not doin' it right
I mean he found him a ho that he like
But you can't make a ho a housewife
And when it all boils down you gonna find in the end
A bitch is a bitch, but a Dogg is a man's best friend
So what? You found you a ho that you like
But you can't make a ho a housewife (Wife)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I mostly sold dick while I packed a gold clip
Worked my money-maker, she got paper, she 'bout to trip
(Where the fuck is my money?) I cannot G guilty
You pimpin' strong, but comin' home to sheets that be filthy
She on the dillzy, I take advantage
All up in them panties, I got this bitch speakin' Spanish
I'm mannish, get yo' nails out my back
Slut, I'm 'bout to nut and get up, go scrub yo' cat (Get the fuck out of here)
Learn the player rules, this is how a player do
Might not be a freak, but she got on the choosin' shoes
Dollar signs are folded, I can't control it
Tryin' to leave her, beeper just exploded
She sweatin' me, won't let me, broad turned fraud
Now she on this dick, huh, got her turnin' tricks, huh
Man, it's a trip, I don't trip, I'm in yo' Lexus flexin'
I left her up in Dallas, Texas, ass naked

Now this, this is one of them occasions

Naw, ""ho"" ain't short for honey, almost had to wail her like Bunny
Tellin' tales of bein' pregnant, catchin' Nordstrom sales with abortion money
I spotted her, seen her with my nigga when I shot at her
Now we got beef, he caught up in the ho's erotica
Exotic, she's psychotic, rockin' his Nautica
Soon he'll need antibiotics (Sucka bitch)
Name a sexual disease, she got it like Sam Goody
You be like, ""Damn, how could she hit me off with chlamydia?""
Fool, I pity ya
We live in the city of ballers
With more bounce and in a Zapp, she will doo wa ditty ya
The prettier the grittier, the wittier can get her
To the Hotel, Niko, on some Sauve shit like Rico
That's when I caught a Vision like Coleco
A high-post ho, a perfect way for me to keep dough
Huh, have her sellin' ass on Bronson Ave and Pico
[Verse 3: Kurupt]
At the hotel, motel, or the Holiday Inn (Say what, nigga?)
I said if that bitch keep fuckin' up (Beotch) then we'll fuck her friends
I said I dip, dive, what can I say?
Niggas need to stop fuckin' with O.J
Some niggas bang Blood, some niggas bang Crip
And bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
I had a dream of hoes, I had to screen my hoes
I seen my hoes in all kinds of clothes
Lil' Almond Joy, I truly enjoy
If you blew my balls right through my drawers
Come back to the mansion, chill at the spot
From the way she was blowin', I know she does it a lot
I have a eight-and-a-half, nine-and-three-quarters
The ho started callin' when I started boss ballin'
Gimme some head, gimme some ass (Uh-huh)
Gimme some cash, pass it to Daz
Pass it to Snoop, or pass it to Nate
See hoes eat dick like eggs and steak
It ain't shit new, I thought you knew (What?)
I knew you would, you wish you could
Break a G down, break me down
But I'ma see you on the rebound (What what?), D.P. style

Now this, this is one of them occasions
Where the homies not doin' it right
I mean he found him a ho that he like
But you can't make a ho a housewife

Hey, little lady how you feelin’?
It’s Humma-Boo at the crib just chillin’
Tryin’ to figure out what I’m gonna do today
How about you throw on somethin’ sexy and come my way?
I got a treat for you, man you gonna like it
I hear those giggles: go ahead and get excited
You say in the bed that your man is a lame guy
Havin’ sex with him is just like watching paint dry
Daaaayymn, I really hope that that ain’t true
But if it is, here’s what I’m gonna do for you:
And when you get here, I’m not just gonna Bang it
I’mma smash it too, so let’s just say I’m gonna ""Smang"" It

I hope your muscles warmed up, you caaan’t be lazy (Get loose)
This is what I like to call ""Smash Bang fusion""
Gotta focus, mama don’t wanna get a ""Cooch Contusion""
I like to mix it up, I like to do stuff;
I like to start slow and then I beat it up
You should be cautious, don’t be scary
I’ma have you lookin’ like a Wild Thornberry

Smash & Bang is my favorite combination
Kiss you to your toes till you get that sensation
It’s a love scene, baby, with no communication. (Baby!)
Got mine’s off, now to the next location (baby!)
I need inspiration, your mouth fixation
Smangin’ them drawers is my life’s aspiration
Eff dot Floss loves ladies and relations (Love it!)

Call me Schwarzenegger, my sex game strong

Some call that a problem but I call it a gift
Hit the clutch then I start to shift
Turn it up - light my dutch then start to drift
Lost Angel, Westside rider
The official, four-oh-five Friday, sound provider
Underground hitman, hard to hire
Unsigned death threats written in typewriters
Poetic, I'm that type of writer
Got that ""Don't call me, I'll call you"" type of fire
Fake it 'til you make it, you're such a good liar
Headliners used to not make the flyer
Four-oh-one K, and I don't mean retire

Peace ain't the word to play - it's violence

Wild out like I'd never see breakfast
Nightmares, tie in dreamcatchers
Tryin to run breathless, outta control
I don't give orders, I make suggestions
Then walk away! I've learned my lessons (Ev have patience)
It's simple, they neglect it
They win at chess, still lose at checkers
That ain't weakness, it's a death wish
Choke 'em out; another off the checklist
I came too far not to be respected
And drove too far to hear they closed the guestlist
(You gotta be kiddin me) A new rain out the smokin bar
Umbrellas up, these cats are dogs
And just because it barely ever hails in L.A
They say I can't reign the game and hail from L.A.?

Peruvian Cocaine,Immortal Technique,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro Dialogue from Scarface, 1983]

[Interviewer]
""I've heard whispers... about the financial support your government receives from the drug industry""

[Gutierrez]
""Well, the irony of this, of course, is that this money, which is in the billions, is coming from your country. You see, you are the major purchaser of our national product, which is, of course, cocaína.""

[Interviewer]
""Cocaine. On one hand, you're saying the United States government is spending millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs onto our streets. At the same time, we are doing business with the very same government that is flooding our streets with cocaine?""

[Gutierrez]
""Mm, mm, si, si. Let me show you a few of the other characters that are involved in this... tragicomedy.""

[Spanish Dialogue]
""Oigan ustedes ahi! Ustedes trabajando! Sigan trabajando carajo!""
""Oye Luis, ¿Cuándo van a terminar?""
""Ahorita.""
""Bueno que se apuren los burros. Ahorita viene el camión, apúra, diles!""
""Ahorita van a venir para recoger los productos, apúrate!""
[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
I'm on the border of Bolivia, working for pennies
Treated like a slave, the coca fields have to be ready
The spirit of my people is starving, broken and sweaty
Dreaming about revolution (""¡Revolucion!"") looking at my machete
But the workload is too heavy to rise up in arms
And if I ran away, I know they'd probably murder my moms
So I pray to Jesú Cristo when I go to the mission
Process the cocaine paste and play my position

[Verse 2: Pumpkinhead]
Ok, listen, Juan Valdez, just get me my product
Before we chop off your hands for worker's misconduct
I got the power to shoot a copper and not get charged
And it would be sad to see your family in front of a firing squad
So, to feed your kids I need these bricks
Forty tons in total, let me test it, indeed, I... [sniffs]
Shit, this is good, pass me a tissue
And don't worry about them, I paid off the official

[Verse 3: Diabolic]
Yo, it don't come as a challenge, I'm the son of some of the foulest
Elected by my people, the only one on the ballot
Born and bred to consult with feds, I laugh at fate
And assassinate my predecessor to have his place
In a Third World fascist state, lock the nation
With 90% of the wealth in 10% of the population
The Central Intelligence Agency takes weight faithfully
The finest type of China white and cocaine, you'll see
[Verse 4: Tonedeff]
Honey, I'm home
Never mind why your bank account's suddenly grown, it's (What?)
Funny we're so out of this debt from this money we owe, would you
Run if I told you that I had two governments overthrown
To keep our son enrolled in a private school and to keep our tummies swollen? (Whoa)
Come on, our fucking home was built on a foundation of bloody throats
The hungry stolen of their souls, of course this country's running coke
I took a stunted oath to hush the ones who know
The CIA conducts the flow for these young hustlers that lust for dough

[Verse 5: Poison Pen]
I don't work in the hood.  Hit my connect.  That’s
What's really good.  They supply work to the hood
These dudes fucking crack me up
Scrutinized like we inferior.  Petrified when we meet in my area (Calm down)
My dudes don’t shoot until I say so.  You got the loot?
Give me the ""Yay-Yay!"" like Ice Cube, so don't play with
My llello
We won't stop for you bastards
My street scramblers chop it and bag it

[Verse 6: LouCipher]
Taking pictures and tapping phones
Debating snitches and cracking codes
Fast to cuff or blast the fo'
On any hustler stacking dough (Get on the ground)
There’s probably crack or blow
And my overtime is where your taxes go
I’ll gain your trust
Get you to hand weight to us ‘cause we paid up front
On the low with cameras taping ya
Getting popped with weight? The prison sentence is due
Make the call and then leave with two kis out the evidence room
[Verse 7: C-Rayz Walz]
With my fame, truck, boat, or plane, they watching you
You think you got work? They copping too
We control blocks, they lock countries and own companies
We had nice cars and sneaker money
Now there's players out there talkin' 'bout they holding
With bugs in their house like they down South with windows open
Your dough ain't long—you wrong—you take shorts and soon
Feds’ll be up in your mouth like forks and spoons
So enjoy the rush, live plush off coke bread
Soon you'll be in a cell with me like Jenny Lopez
In a school, I was a bully, now life is fully a joke
I keep afloat on a boat for Peruvian coke
Players do favors for governors and tax makers
Fat Quakers smoke crack and sex acts with bad mayors
The walls got ears, you bigmouths probably scared
Not prepared to do years like Javier

[Outro: Immortal Technique]
The story just told is an example of the path that drugs take on their way to every neighborhood, in every state, of this country. It's a lot deeper than the niggas on your block. So when they point the finger at you, brother man? This is what you've got to tell them

[Edited Outro Dialogue from New Jack City, 1991: Nino Brown]
""I'm not guilty. You're the one that's guilty. The lawmakers, the politicians, the Columbian drug lords... all you who lobby against making drugs legal, just like you did with alcohol during the prohibition! You're the one who's guilty. I mean, c'mon, let's kick the ballistics here: ain't no Uzis made in Harlem! Not one of us in here owns a poppy field! This thing is bigger than Immortal Technique. This is big business. This is the American way."""

Who got that light green
Who got that Bobby Brown
Who got Bin Laden weed

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
I swear sometimes I got to get high to hang around my ho
Sometimes I feel like I got to get high to hang round niggas I know
I sped it up on WEED, I slowed it down on SNOW
Cause I seen so many niggas fall off that blow
One day they got it all, the next ain't shit to show
So off that yayo my nasal I had to cut that ho
But now I'm feeling happy I'm on that Binny Bin Laden
And niggas is actin' like they don't know what the fuck just happened
My vision getting blurry, I'm 'bout to fall asleep
Or am I dying if I OD cause this some potent weed
My life start flashing like holograms like right in front
Of my own face I never felt this way off one blunt
I see my son gaining life and my dad losing his
And old girlfriends and niggas I shouldn't have hung with
The picture starting to fade, it's getting hard to breathe
I'm blacking out with no post up under my shirt and sleeve

Well since I'm on Bin Laden let me tell you a story
Bout these three pussy rappers who couldn't do nothing for me
Gave 'em whole lot of cheese and said I fucked 'em and shit
Smoked a whole lot of weed so they seem to forget
Who bought them drugs, and them cars, put your bitches in homes
Who told yo ass to take a bath until you thought you was grown
Mane I tell you he a killer when we talk on the phone
When you see him face to face he'll leave you alone
That's why I'm smoking on this fucking Bin Laden
All my niggas in the hood they got it
Take one little puff you a addict
Take a gun to the head means tragic
Boy I tell you like this we can smoke it anywhere
In front of police station with a six pack of beer
Seven A.M. in the morning just watching people stare
Let 'em point them damn fingers say they wild over there

[Verse 3: Lord Infamous]
Ey ey it's glowing like its indigo, I smell it through the bag
I'm floating like a magic carpet straight from Baghdad
From my brains, from my blood, from my lungs, from the Dutches
Can't just let pure simply just escape from my a clutches
Cause it's the substance I'm loving, I'm buzzing
Smoking like an oven, huffing and puffing
This ain't Indonesia, Colombian or Cali man
It's a bio-weapon, straight from the Taliban
[Verse 4: Crunchy black]
Do you remember me from smoking good weed
Break it down roll it up give me indonese
Do you remember me from no sticks no seeds
Or you remember me from putting you on this Laden weed
Get yo funds together and come go and see
I'm gone take you on the strip where Bin Laden be
This one blunt action you'll have to smoke and see
Have you choking, falling out with your family

You so f-full of your-s-self that you just sit and judge
You point 'em out, and call 'em up, and then s-sit 'em down
Then you put fertilizer, lyin, spread the shit around
But if you took a second Mr. Mirror, you would see
That you just mad at you, man, you ain't really mad at me
You took the hatred of yourself and just project it out
No disrespect, you can't respect yourself then just get out
For real, you need to go away just like the rain song

So far you nasty, ff-fuck you call that
I call that insecure, sh-sh-shawty think she all that
Ff-fuck outta here, thats how they gettin gas

Find a dummy, wrap him up, let him fuck, suck him up
Gettin good graces, take his money, aa-another one
No longer (Caffera'), Surgery and maskera
Looking at your money
But c-can't look up in that mirror
Fearin what it show you, reality is gold
Real recognize real, real women dont know you
One of the coldest, the gracing on that pole
What them tippers don't see
I bet that mirror gon show you

My Sweetie,Wale,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Wale:]
I needed to feel like you know... when your mother used to take you to the African parties

[Hook]
You're my sweetie, My sugar, My lady, my lover (this is for so the girls in nigeria)
My honey let me hold you (you know what it is, let me love you, forever)

[[Verse 1:]
Well, maybe not forever
She in withdrawal when we not together
Best foot forward, holla at your boy
And I can get em all without lots of effort
Take her home, and we can get it on
Make my jollof with lots of pepper
God has blessed her, prada dresser
Mix my guiness with a Dr. Pepper
Im so Naija, she so Igbo
She so sweet, shortie feed my ego
Me bold dude, Bola dipo olu
Whole crew, roll through, got more green than whole foods
African queen got what you need
Said my name wale, Ba wo ni
[Hook:]
You're my sweetie, My sugar, My lady, my lover, so honey let me hold you, let me love you, forever

[Verse 2:]
Who said I don't rep, I am naija all day
When I meet your mom I still du ba le
I am Wale, Olubo
We be in the party like we own that bar
No regard when I'm going at abroad
And I go up in a party like im going abroad
Understand that's fly, damn super fly guy land in Du Bai
Yall can't get it, I make yall get it
Hate estate and my iPod wit it
Money on the floor, throw it on a broad
This is not balling, but this is our culture
You is not hip then I can not coach her
If its not couture, I will not go to her
If its not k'naan, I will not co-tour
To much cognac wheres my chauffeur

[Hook:]
You're my sweetie, My sugar, My lady, my lover, so honey let me hold you, let me love you, forever

Money on the floor, spray it spray it
Said theres Money on the floor, spray it spray it
Said theres Money on the floor, spray it spray it
Said theres Money on the floor, spray it spray it
Said theres Money on the floor, spray it spray it
Said theres Money on the floor, spray it spray it

You are not hard you are fufu soft
We don't do more sales or croupon
We buy out stores till its all too gone
Don't go to far
Alot of niggas fake who go to hard
But there is money on the floor spray it spray it
Everybody wasted faded, faded
Henny in my cup don't need no chase
Don't know her name so I am just going to change it

World Tour,Wale,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Wale]
Mama ain't raise no fool, true
But me and my brother never made it out school
She prayed on me passing that bar
Its way different ma you see em passin' out bars
The definition of a jetsetter
I'm Hip-Hop still livin' like a Goodfella'
Castle and crooks sweater
And the queen never trip she drive away faster than you look nigga
Have you seen Ibiza with Beaches that look like Eva with D cups
Or a beach like an HBO Feature at night, a quarter-pound of sand in my un-released nikes
Bitch say im hot smoking on by the night nigga you ain't know about The life
When shit gets heavier than Norbit's wife we still gotta Spit some enourmous ryhmes
Niggas more than like, its more than likely when you return home you ignored by the gorgeous wife
And she Feel slighted and you dont want to fight with her cuz' you tired
But Now it's back to the lab 45 messages right after you land
Feet feel Swollen you gone off the Xanax and risking your life with the mic in your hand

[Hook: Wale and Jazmine Sullivan]
We on a world tour, Wale your man
Hustlin' in each and every ghetto with a mic in my hand
New York, VA, DC, get paid
We on a world tour, Wale your man
Hustlin' in each and every ghetto with a mic in my hand
London, Tokyo, we gon' take you all around the globe
Sing it to em' shorty

Dada da da dada da da, dada da da dada da da
Its like La da da da da da, dada da da dada da da
Dada da da dada da da, dada da da dada da da
[Verse 2: Wale]
See Dre did Scotland and everybody jocked him
I did Scotland and got no props for it
Nah, that just fucked up my J's which fucked up my day, rocked wellies on stage
Freezing my willie off, no hotel, I'm back on the plane while they was like go ""whale""
I'm so well ahead of them I'm unpaved, I did justice to Justice mon frere
One thing that you niggas must acknowledge, I leave beats like the pants on Scottish: Kilt
It's how it's dealt, I've been over more water then than Michael Phelps
It's harder when you by yourself, my nigga Bun B couldn't help
My nigga Rhyme Fest never think about self cause he think about wealth like Finch do MILF's on American Pie
It's hard to have American pride when most of your money's made out of them lies
The other half is out of them lines, they wanna make a nigga like ""Ah fuck""
Rewinding so much that his arm hurt, relying so much that it's over paid em' and they hate em' but they wrong for it D.C. no hooges im on first

[Hook: Wale]
We on a world tour, Wale your man
Hustlin' in each and every ghetto with a mic in my hand

You know that when
We give it, we give it hard
No half steppin' baby
This is who we are
Every word, every word
Written from the heart
Wrote, wrote, wrote
Broken from my heart
To get with it, get with it
Let me see your hands
If you with us
We on a world tour boogie tomorrow
We're praying then can give it to me, pray in the bar

Contemplate,Wale,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Wale]
Dear sweetheart, what's up, boo?
What you up to? More club moves?
I call her, no answer
Her phone in the bag, she dancin'
It's four now, the clubs over
I call her, but oh, hold up
Y'all know what, ignore button
Or the phone die, let's hope for it
That Damier bag I bought her
Caught the attention of those niggas on it
That cell phone that I bought
Is probably filled with some other niggas numbers
So it leaves me to wonder
Why do I still promise to love her?
Cut me off every time I'm talkin'
Which means she ain't never hear nothing
I say stay, she wanna leave
She get her point across so I gotta let her be
I'ma let her be by herself in peace
But five years from now I bet she see
When the club gets played
The things you crave are no longer escapes
And no longing for dates
You want a husband, but no one has a cape
Now you wonder and wait
And I ain't tryin' to hear what you want me to say
It feels good to be over you, babe
So play this shit while you contemplate
Contemplate, contemplate
Play this shit while you contemplate
Play this shit while you contemplate
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Who am I living for, is this my limit
Can I endure some more
Chances are giving, question existing
Who am I living for, is this my limit
Can I endure some more
Chances are giving, question existing

[Verse 2: Wale]
Them people, they talkin'
Them lights, they on me
This life I chose, but I ain't know 'til I found it
To be honest, I'm modest
One hater for every nigga on it
One day everybody is applaudin'
The next day you is everybody target
Why bother, why talk to 'em
Where God at, I need to call Him
My knees on the ground, dear Father
Don't let me break, please make me stronger
How much longer will it linger
Well my heart is giving, will they believe it
When my song is over will they need me
Watch how quickly they find a new leader
Questioning the whole meaning
In the Viper Room, just me and River Phoenix
With Courtney Love in Lake Washington
With a note there and I'm thinking of reading
This ain't hard, Chris Benoit
Heath Ledger said the nights gon' be dark
Feel the size of a Phyllis Hyman note
Apollo Theater I just might not go
Franky Lymon, the limelight gets old
Cold so in a while I'm schizo
I can't cope, I can't think; I can't breathe, this ain't me
This ain't easy, I'm thinking; am I doing this for them or me
I can't think, am I doing this for them or me
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Who am I living for, is this my limit
Can I endure some more
Chances are giving, question existing
Who am I living for, is this my limit
Can I endure some more
Chances are giving, question existing"
Diary,Wale,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
If I told you I wanted to talk to you
You know, you think I'm tryna holla at you
And maybe I am but
You wouldn't hear me out anyway's would you?

[Verse 1: Wale]
Rather lose love than to move on never knowing what it feel like
Short days, long nights
By the phone, no call
Need a clear mind cause I been blind, got me goin' down that road
Heart made of stone
Far away from home
Black woman you cold
Every problem that you ever had with another man I gotta face
Started off on thin ice
I'm still here but I can't skate
Slow sink, can't breathe, no remorse, don't think
Listen to your friend get another man for a minute then repeat
Queen, you deserve the title but she rejects what I give, while she nurse the wounds by them
Tried them didn't work
Got impossible standards
Nothing I'ma do is gon work
Diary of a black girl
[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
I wonder why, I sit and cry
Wish I could shed all these tears
Im down and out
I'll keep on moving and tryna get out
I don't know how to move on
Where I went wrong
I wish I could live with no fear
So down and out
I'll keep it moving and tryna get out
Somehow

[Verse 2: Wale]
Raised by a momma who, who
Hates her baby father so, so
She don't have a problem with, with
Saying fuck a nigga quick, quick
I'm just tryna be the one who never run, but you run away from me
Your girlfriend's man cheat, cheat
Why not me the same thing
She can't see in me, what I see in her
This pain she inherit can't be reversed
I can't even stay living in the shade of all the motherfuckers that played ya
The irony in that is that I ain't even that, but you put it those pages
Wife, you deserve the label but, but you been hurt before so you sore and don't feel your able
Tried them didn't work, got impossible standards, nothing I ever do works
Diary of a black girl
[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
I wonder why, I sit and cry
Wish I could shed all these tears
Im down and out
I'll keep on moving and tryna get out
I don't know how to move on
Where I went wrong
I wish I could live with no fear
So down and out
I'll keep it moving and tryna get out
Somehow

[Verse 3: Wale]
See all I ever wanna do is be relevant
Just tell me that I ever meant anything
Or that you could ever see me and you in another light
But it's like the dark women endures the darkest nights by the wrong man
And see mostly all of them have made you somewhat incapable of a first impression
What I do is I channel my aggression with no cable or antenna
Just intentions to impress you, if capable
Hoping that the material possessions can materialize to a better you
Cars, nothing I drive can drive you out of this frame of mind
With such an ugly picture in it and
Money, nothing I buy can buy me more time for your ears to tell your heart to listen to it
Diamonds, a girl's best friend is what they say, but believe me with the right allegiance shorty you gon shine anyways
And every day that goes by is a couple more lines in her diary
The day before is better than the present
So anyone presented in her presence endures these life sentences
No key for release
No reason to be around
Her minds in the clouds
She writes it all down
In her diary
[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
I wonder why, I sit and cry
Wish I could shed all these tears
Im down and out
I'll keep on moving and tryna get out
I don't know how to move on
Where I went wrong
I wish I could live with no fear
So down and out
I'll keep it moving and tryna get out

Mama Told Me,Wale,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus]
Mama told me it'd be days like this
But I ain't never ever think it'd be a day like this (naw)
Not now not ever
And now until forever you will never need another (nigga)
Mama told me it'd be days like this
But I ain't never ever think it'd be a day like this (naw)
Not now not ever
And now until forever you will never need another (nigga)

[Verse 1]
Sorry hip hop, it took me so long to get on
But so long that I'm on it, it's on
I'm rappin' for the scholars and the hustlers, meanwhile
Showin' mama I ain't dropped out for nothin'
I swear these dolla's gon' add up
And I ain't shallow, material things suppress bad luck
That's why I shine like I does
It's pain in my eyes but these Yves Saints blind you to look
Binded between, carryin' the flag for an area that drag
Whoever tried to gravitate
G told me it's a city full of crabs
I'm feelin' like a platter at Phillip's when I rap
As much as I wanted to be minisculed the fact is
They'd only be happy with a minstrel actor
Sorry Mr. Charlie won't chap dance
And fuck the radio for tellin' me to snap jam
I'm just expectin' the spectator's respect here
My net is from jet setters to cab fares
Hip-hop's unbalances got out of hand
Ain't have to see-saw, I'm already scared
I been called the heir apparent to guide us
Not DC, this whole fuckin' genre
And I ain't in it for them O's or them comma's
But more or less the hope for dope niggas to prosper

The future is now
I lead on record's dedicaton for makin' better music is now
Dope niggas locked out 4 year rap drought
It's rainin' now somehow the fugitive's out
I would invest in a poncho
Cause I ain't finna punch out like Glass Joe (Naw!)
Ima go until my arm's sore
Fuck it! I go until my 40 millionth encore
Hip-hop's dead yeah that's what Nas said to me
I guess us hip-hop heads are celery
We vegetables, on them record labels
Who's next to release? We guillotine them
Niggas braggin' but everybody stagnant
Everybody broke except the nigga on the track (Shit!)
And mama why you throw away my drums?
A hundred for a deal they made a hundred on the song
Nigga I'm a hundred miles far
I'm feelin' Chris Childs, you lookin' like Kobe Bryant jaw
It's lonely at the top so I waited, but ain't nobody take it
Now I'm playin' solitaire patient
Crucifix pieces, necklace with Jesus
See me as blasphemous for I don't need them
God give me strength, Allah give me patience
I am only a man and I don't know what to think

Told her that ""You the star at the top of my Christmas tree""
My only question is, ""Where my presents?""

Well, I like the way you think, mami

You want the thigh-high spikes with the red bottoms (Size 37)
Err, let's make a toast 'cause Christ is born
We gon' party all night 'til the lights come on (Amen)
[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin' it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain't ballin'
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe's right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Verse 4: Cyhi the Prynce]
Yeah, Mom and Dad, I won't be home for the holidays
Ha, I'm over 800 miles away
In the city that's so pretty
Where the hustlers dash through the snow without a sleigh
Tell my family that I'm sorry that I gotta stay
I'm with Ye at the Macy Day Parade
Lettin' the snow fall on my aviator shades
Even though I'm in New York, I'm still reppin' for the A
Cyhi!

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor & Pusha T]
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin' it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain't ballin'
Feels like we bought it all (Yes, it's G.O.O.D. Music, y'all)
The mistletoe's right here (Check it, uh, uh)
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus
[Verse 5: Pusha T]
On the stoop of that Brownstone, shovellin' the brownstone
Santa's on a diet, gotta get the pounds gone
Downtown got me feelin' like it's Dow Jones
But uptown got me feelin' like its down home
Snow like sugar hill, chains on wheels
We turn our two doors into snowmobiles
We got our own style, no Soho feel
Put on your play clothes, how that logo feel?

[Verse 6: Big Sean]
Oh, pose for them photo stills
You don't wanna miss a moment, where's your NoDoz pills?
I caught her lookin' at my Rollie as my mojo spills
Snowflakey on the bezel, hope you know those real
Okay, my white girl Veronica, black girl Monica
Got me celebrating ChristmaHanuKwanzaakah
Rock-rock-rock-rock-rock-rock-rockin' dashikis with a yarmulke
Where the Christmas tree at? Let's design it up

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin' it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain't ballin'
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe's right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Verse 7: Cam'ron]
Uh, Lenox Ave to Saint Nick, never seen Saint Nick (Nah)
Just niggas sellin' the same nicks, the same bricks (What up, y'all?)
Same hustlers running' up to Broadway
That's where the snow's at, taste it, foreplay
No turkey or greens, just Jimbo's (Jimbo's)
Christmas lights in project windows (Yes)
Shouts to the coldest on my barometer
Berkman, Shapiro, Kalina, Hanukkah (My lawyers)

[Verse 8: Teyana Taylor & Musiq Soulchild]
All the flashin' lights up on a tree
The house lit up nice
With your family is where you wanna be
Here on Christmas night
When you wake up and you see the gifts
Don't that make you feel good?
So since we all snowed in in Harlem
Let's have Christmas in the hood

[Verse 9: Teyana Taylor]
All of the flashin' lights
Yeah, them things shine so bright
Always for you and me
Baby, you're Christmas Eve
If you like what you see
Won't you come sit on my knee?
And tell me everything that you want
'Cause, baby, I'm your Santa Claus, yeah

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin' it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain't ballin'
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe's right here

Ok I'm leanin' to the left, flag in my right pocket
Star Trek fly, unidentified flying objects
Extraterrestrial, I'm all about my decimals
Retarded in the booth, they say I got a special flow
Sicker than your average you rappers is ass backwards
Gudda spit crack and you niggas is crack addicts
It's simple mathematics; you cut the check
And I rake in the green like I'm rakin' the grass in
Pretty bitches damn near faint when they passin'
Call my whip Martin, but the first name Aston
Potatohead niggas get mashed when I'm spazzin
Think you fuckin' with me? Put your cash in
Nah, I doubt it;
I was young and reckless when P say he was about it
You niggas is Ducks, Howards, Cowards
Kill the competition and shower niggas with flowers
This rap shit is ours, Gudda, bitch~!

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, Uptown back in it, Hollygrove black menace
Black clothes, black tennis', black semi'
I've never sat in the Hemi, that will offend me
Try Maybach or Maybach, bitch I got stacks

I still don't play that, I kill on ASAP
And we don't do shit but get money all day
Put some shoes on my bullets now they runnin' your way
YM, Young Mula, Young Money all day
Where the drugs so sweet like honey on yay
Which one of y'all say you want drama? I'm honored
I blitz yo' ass like a mothafuckin' lineman
Stack of paychecks with a whole bunch of commas

Two things in the world I love - good head and victory
You ain't doin' it big, I'm grown, stop kiddin me
Your whip ain't up to date and your hoes look like Mr. T
This is Misery, no Kathy Bates
Come at me sideways my money'll slap you straight
Yeah, I'm a big joker so you know I'll smash your ace
Leave the club with ya girl send her home with a ashy face
Love is a gamble, but it's my casino
And tonight you're the loser, I hope she got Aveno
I hope the game got life insurance cause I'mma kill it
And all you whack ass rap niggas dyin with it
I'm so Harlem, eatin but still starvin'
Po-pockets fat as fuck like all they do is eat margarine
Millz!

[Verse 4: Tyga]
Say, put the flow
Say, put the flow in the pot, crank up the notch
Burn the song from a stove top, this finger lickin hot
His pick flip cause the nigga flopped
My shit hit like the pitch was soft, niggas cottonballed
She dropped drawers cause she poppin off
Her pussy crossed guard but, I don't stop at all
I smash in the car, like fuck the fuckin law
Her baby daddy gone, who wanna meet the Don?
That Rocky shit up on the arm-arm
Shittin on 'em like hay in the barn
Hey wait they say Money talks and, man you don't speak at all
You shop at mini-malls

Everytime We Touch,FiO BABY,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Well baby girl, lets take this back
I'll press rewind, you just relax
Im confused, the past seems black
Take a seat, lets sort the facts

Lemme see, how young were we?
Oh thats right, we met at three
I was just a little fool
God you were so beautiful

And I remember way back when
You'd chase me round, I'd steal your pens
But thats okay, you stole my heart
Knew we'd never grow a part

You wrote my name down everywhere
We were young, but truly cared
A find like you is oh so rare
Even then, no one compared

Lets take this back, to our first date
Damn that night was fucking great
I remember what we ate
Pizza at Joes pizza place
And I remember our first kiss
And how you laughed when I first missed
Learned that night that love exists
God we both were so nervous

But thats ok, look at us now
All grown up, Im like wow!
Still in love, I wonder how
Practically writing our vows

Baby I feel so alive
When our bodies do collide
Girl I love you very much
Cause every time we ta ta touch!

Chorus:
Cause everytime we touch, I get this feeling
And everytime we kiss I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last
Need you by my side

V2:

Every time we touch, I fly
Your body is like a high
Turned on by your ass and thighs
But still, I love the girl inside
Eyes got me mesmerized
Hips got me hypnotized
Hearts got me so in line
And I thank god that your all mine

Cause every time we back at home
They all put you on a thrown
Cause they know just who you with
FiO Baby and his click!

And every time you visit me
I just love to show you off
Probably cause your so New York
And all these girls are way too soft

They let me slide, you call me out
Set me straight, you curse and shout
When I act hard you call my bluff
Reminding me I ain't that tough

And that is why I love you most
Always try and keep me close
Hear my thoughts, and help me cope
So I thank you, for having hope

When I get paid, I'll buy a boat
We can travel coast to coast
Do up Cancun, we'll drink and smoke
And live it up until were broke
Necklaces and diamond rings
Shopping sprees, and girly things
I'll frost you up with lots of bling
Now everybody go and sing

Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God, talk to me now, this is an emergency

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
And she claims she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep, bitch, cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
I'd never do that to you, at least purposely
We breaking up again, we making up again
But we don't love no more, I guess we fucking then
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her?
And you mix them emotions with tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights, y'all have a bad fight
And you talk about her family, her aunts and shit
And she say, ""Motherfucker, your momma's a bitch""
You know, domestic drama and shit, all the attitude
I'd never hit a girl, but I'll shake the shit out of you
But I'mma be the bigger man, big pimpin' like Jigga man
Oh, I guess I figure it's

And my niggas said I shouldn't let it worry me
I need to focus on the girls we getting currently
But I been thinking and it got me back to sinking
And this relationship, it even got me back to drinking
Now this Hennessy, uh, it's gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you having my child was our destiny
But I can't even vibe with you sexually
'Cause every time that I'd try, you would question me
Saying, ""You fucking them girls, disrespecting me
You don't see how your lies is affecting me?
You don't see how our life was supposed to be?
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you ain't cracked up to what you were supposed to be
You always gone, you always be where them hoes will be""
And this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me

Where I'm goin in this life,its so trife,I get to skeemin and dreamin
Is thea a way I can make my route pay

But hey, times are hard and 4 me its get harder
Got so many problems, they jus build up real quick like tarter
Avoid tha few, and jus hang wit tha crew, as if u didn't knew
It be that Stoneycrook crew, its a hard life
And its affectin me so strong, sleepin hea and sleepin thea
Not havin a place to call my home, this is wrong
I ain't neva had it hard like this
But momma always told it would be a day like this
Dirty po shit, baby I can't do it too long
Cause I don had too much to stay down, gotta eat and stay strong
Even though my brotha, he'll be thea through thick and thin
Won't be gon in tha wind, like so called friends
Pick up tha pen, let if flow like tha Trinity
Problems steady killin me, gotta get some ends in my vicinity
I'm in it deep, reep when I'm smashin on yo homies
I didn't wanna do it, me and my baby need some money
Hungry for this rap shit, phony, oh no, not this
Wanted by tha po-po's, they won't get me, I'm too swift

To find tha true meanin, haitian, devestation
Not knowin wha you're facin, can be a lifetime complication
So I'm lacin, these blunts wit weed, keep my G's, right beside me
I dunno where danger is goin to find me
Behind these doors that's where I stay
Wit a blunt up in my mouth and a cocked AK
And each day, I get tempted by these hoe ass niggas
So-So ass niggas, jus po ass niggas
And I been broke b4 playa, but I kept my dreamin
And I ain't neva lettin it go 4 no goddamn cream
Now fuck a football team, fuck that shit, what this means
Is that I be damned if I'm 40 still servin these fiends
And all tha shit I seen, wasn't no diamonds and pearls
My destiny is to be blind from this fucked up world

Say no mo, I'll be ready when tha time is right
Got to be patient in this game, but that's hard in life
I got to fight, off hataz while I'm duckin tha laws
Keep some money in my pocket, clothes, shoes and draws
Neva pause, if I do I might slip off wit tha lifeless
Beggin to tha Lord, bring me closer to tha brightness
How can I fight this?
A bag of weed, feelin loco wit my crooks, gotta skeem 4 cheese
My opportunity came so I grabbed it
Now I see my future in tha mist of all tha bad shit
Hopin I dont pass it, tryin to keep a job and chill
But now thea's 2 things on my patience, have no time to live
Still feelin like I'm young, but I'm old enuff
I must be trippin, get a hold of it, control tha stuff
Leave tha lust of my dealin wit tha fools who want it
Keep on slangin though you'll find a betta way to get up on it

I heard you got them sacks and if that's true, I want 2
And uh 1 for my lil homie, he be smokin all night too
So I told them niggas bail and quickly stepped away wit hast
You see I know these streetz to well and he was reachin for his waist
Oh shit, my battle mode don switched a whole fuckin level
Don switched to part 2 that's crooked intentions mixed wit rebel
Like tha devil on me, Pookie get control of yoself
Can't release Tha Rippla on these niggas shit they'll be nuthin left
You ready? I'm ready ain't scared (Hold up)I thought you was ready

Can't nobody get me up off ya nigga, prepare yoself for tha finish
I don cut tha nigga I'm rippin take tha confidence from a nigga
Left him wit feminine feelings and big bullet holes from Tha Rippla
There's a lesson to be learned but its too late for you to see

Heard, this nigga known for pullin jacks on a nigga
But what he didn't know ain nuthin but crooks on Audelia
But still you'll be tryin to catch me slippin wit cha crew
So I released fire and came back bustin wit my fools
Let's even up, fightin we ain't deep enough
So my niggas strapped and now they headed toward tha street to bust
Ya'll bitches ain't seein us, shit I'm bout to blow some mo

I'm makin these niggas hate today, by wearin a crooked logo
Watch out for tha blow hoe, and leavin you bitches in tha mist
And if you niggas dont trip on me, then I won't bust yo shit
Plus my click be tha ruffest, not sayin we tha toughest
But Stoneycrook niggas, been known to come out wit tha ruckus
Fuck you who say fuck us, and all ya'll niggas who be hatin'
Cappin, cause you can't fade me, runnin up on me daily
But baby, its mo' complicated, than you can see
Words lose all meanin', when niggas see niggas gleamin'
So dont you even think that you can get outta this
So bitch, to get me to this point, you must really got me pissed
I'm twist and dismember, choppin down nigga timber
Kodac moment remember, this crooked nigga a Rippla

Chorus [x2]

Whatchallwannado? If you trip, then we bomb first
Pull out tha guns first, chiff until I lungs hurt
I know bombin', but Tha Rippla finna bomb worse
Look at us come first, best believe be bomb worse
[Mr. Lucci]
Welcome to tha wild, wild west, tha southside, its me, a killa
Fuck Billy tha Kid nigga, it's Lucci tha Wig Splitta
Like Tyson a hard hitta, toe tag deala
A brain spilla, body chilla, mind thrilla, fuck it, killa
On tha grind for my scrilla, rhymin' hard, workin strong
Chiffin smoke up in my long, still my whole bag gon
I live long, for doin wrong, cause wit my crooks, man its on
Leave a nigga dome blown, or up shit creek, all alone
For bumpin his grill, he must thought he was go cheat one, 4 real
Now he killed, 6 feet he feel, surrounded by mob skillz
Crooked is as crooked does, like crooked thugs
And crooked hugs and crooked slugs and crooked luv
It ain't neva enuff, until I whip it out my holsta
Cocked back ready to roast ya, on every wanted poster
Stayin' high like a vulture, inflictin' pain from smoke
Those crooked soljaz smokin, let tha coroner dispose ya

Chorus [x2]

[C-Pone]
I been quick to cause a tragedy, fuckin wit my faculty
Bullets sprayed rapidly, now they died from my fatality
Fuck those who try to battle me, this rap shit is a mastery
Bomb viciously, leavin tha whole scene full of catastrophes
Hollow my calvary, when I feel danger in tha mist
Now I'm pissed, wit a clutched fist
Around they Ashton and my 45th
No mo lift, in these shady niggas in fleets
We be deadlier than a weed blunt dipped in Phaldahyde and Morphine
Sparklin' clean up through tha industry
Lyrics at yo weak feet, they notice me
Due to my unique style of Texas poetry
Blowin these, wack MC's, who refuse to give our props
Platinum hitz from tha Stoneycrook click, til we all sittin on top
When Tha Rippla drop, best believe we comin wit bombs
Turnin' yo average house party, into a modern day Vietnam
Run up if you want some, we clash like Titans
Ain't no collaboration deadlier than Stoneycrook and I come

Catch Me,Nicki Minaj,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Extracurricular, parallel to none, I am perpendicular
Hit 'em with the, ""Oh, now, that's just ridiculous""
We coulda cleared up all these particulars
That coulda been the homicide, vehicular
You wasn't in no state to speed off
You was buggin' out, yeah, you was peed off
We was just chillin' up at the ski loft
Thinkin' we was on, you tellin' me we off
Your whole vibe changed when you got the phone call
That's the effect they call a snowball
Next thing you know, I was runnin' down the hall
Sayin' ""Please come back, I have given my all""
I have given my all
Funny how you could always make me feel small
I have given my all
Catch me, catch me, I think I'm gon' fall

[Chorus]
My mind is made up, I'm waitin' for ya
I'm waitin' on you, waitin', boy
My mind is set, I'm waitin' on ya
I'm waitin' for you, waitin', boy
Could you catch me? (Catch me, catch me)
Could you catch me? (Catch me, catch me)
Could you catch me?
I am waiting on you to catch me (Catch me, catch me)
[Verse 2]
You wanted oh-so bad to prove points
But your game always makes me lose points
And your game always makes me concur
That maybe I shoulda never taken you from her
But with all of the aforementioned
I am still trapped in your dimension
So I will be on the mountain waiting
'Cause I am in need of more attention
Coulda called back just to say sum'
I'ma fall back in the bass drum
Please come to destination
I'm not doin' well, exclamation
You succeeded at your attempts to make me
Need you desperately to vindicate me
It's funny how you could always make me feel small
I have given my all
Catch me, catch me, I think I'm gon' fall

[Chorus]
My mind is made up, I'm waitin' for ya
I'm waitin' on you, waitin', boy
My mind is set, I'm waitin' on ya
I'm waitin' for you, waitin', boy
Could you catch me? (Catch me, catch me)
Could you catch me? (Catch me, catch me)
Could you catch me?
I am waiting on you to catch me (Catch me, catch me)

Okay
Oh, oh, oh, okay
Oh, oh, oh, okay
It's, it's whatever you say, ayy, ayy
It's whatever you say, ayy, ayy

Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos,Public Enemy,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Bass for your face, London!
Everybody in the house make some noise!
I want everybody in the house to say ""ho!"" (Ho!)
Yo Chuck, kick it to 'em, man!
""A ballad behind bars or you could say real rock from the rock. An unusual musical happening in a most unusual place. The state prison...""
""Get in that cell, nigga!""

[Verse 1]
I got a letter from the government the other day
I opened and read it, it said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me giving a damn, I said never
Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like me and myself because they never did
I wasn't with it but just that very minute it occurred to me
The suckers had authority
Cold sweating as I dwell in my cell, how long has it been?
They got me sitting in the state pen
I gotta get out, but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor
I'm not a fugitive on the run
But a brother like me begun to be another one
Public enemy serving time
They drew the line y'all, to criticize me some crime
Nevertheless, they could not understand that I'm a Black man
And I could never be a veteran
On the strength, the situation's unreal
I got a raw deal, so I'm looking for the steel
[Verse 2]
They got me rotting in the time that I'm serving
Telling you what happened the same time they're throwing
Four of us packed in a cell like slaves, oh well
The same motherfucker got us living in his hell
You have to realize, what its a form of slavery
Organized under a swarm of devils
Straight up - word 'em up on the level
The reasons are several, most of them federal
Here is my plan anyway and I say
I got gusto, but only some I can trust, yo
Some do a bid from 1 to 10
But I never did, and plus I never been
I'm on a tier where no tears should ever fall
Cell block and locked, I never clock it y'all
Cause time and time again
Time, they got me serving to those and to them, I'm not a citizen
But ever when I catch a C-O
Sleeping on the job, my plan is on go-ahead
On the strength, I'ma tell you the deal
I got nothing to lose
Cause I'm going for the steel

[Verse 3]
Don't you know I caught a C-O
Falling asleep on death row
I grabbed his gun, then he did what I said so
And every man's demand got served
Along with the time they served, decency was deserved
To understand my demands
I gave a warning, I wanted the governor, y'all
And plus the warden to know
That I was innocent because I'm militant
Posing a threat, you bet it's fucking up the government
My plan said I had to get out and break north
Just like Oliver's neck, I had to get off
My boys had the feds in check
They couldn't try nothing
We had a force to instigate a prison riot
This is what it takes for peace
So I just took the piece
Black for Black inside time to cut the leash
Freedom to get out to the ghetto, no sell out
6 C-Os we got we ought to put their head out
But I'll give 'em a chance, cause I'm civilized
As for the rest of the world, they can't realize
A cell is hell, I'm a rebel so I rebel
Between bars, got me thinking like an animal
Got a woman C-O to call me a copter
She tried to get away, and I popped her
Twice, right? Now who wanna get nice?
I had 6 C-Os, now it's 5 to go
And I'm serious, call me delirious
But I'm still a captive, I gotta wrap this
Time to break as time grows intense
I got the steel in my right hand, now I'm looking for the fence
[Verse 4]
As I ventured into the courtyard
Followed by 52 brothers bruised, battered, and scarred but hard
Going out with a bang, ready to bang out
But power from the sky and from the tower shots rang out
A high number of dose, yes and some came close
Figure I trigger my steel, stand and hold my post
This is what I mean, an anti-nigga machine
If I come out alive and then they won't come clean
And then I threw up my steel bullets flew up
And to my surprise the water tower blew up, who shot
What, who, what, the bazooka was who
And to my rescue, it was the S1Ws
Secured my getaway, so I just got away
The joint broke, from the black smoke
Then they saw it was rougher than the average bluffer
Cause the steel was black, the attitude exact
Now the chase is on telling you to c'mon
53 brothers on the run, and we are gone"

I hope I don't get penalized for what I did with the rice
The name Bundles, you can just imagine the life
I love Christmas, I can just imagine the white
The trees, the candy canes (Oh, Lord)
The holidays remind me of the game
The reindeers remind me of the Range (Supercharged)
Icicles remind me of the ring
She seen the videos, she like the fadeaway dance
I wanna kiss her like I got a mistletoe in my pants (Yes, sir)
She looking at my neck like
""Damn! Must have blew your whole advance down at the Colosseum""
Ma, the kitty is major
Without b-day, love, let me upgrade ya
You know giving's in a rapping nature
So all I want for Christmas is some rapping paper
[Refrain: Stack Bundles]
Deck the halls, it's a Dipset Christmas
We all ball, it's a Dipset Christmas
Fa-la-la-la-la, a Dipset Christmas
We fly high, it's a Dipset Christmas
Deck the halls, it's a Dipset Christmas
We all ball, it's a Dipset Christmas

[Chorus: Jim Jones]
Christmas cheers (Uh)
Dipset's here (Yup)
Ballin' every day (It's Christmas time)

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
In all my years standing on 112th
Never seen Santa, no elves (Nope)
Seen a couple mans go to jail (Fo' sho')
Trying to get Christmas money off gram sales
And that ain't work out (It's a shame)
They say Santa know you good or you bad
Gotta make an exception, we in the hood, living fast (Yup)
The cash that we get, I admit it's kind of fast
But we gotta pay the rent
Put some clothes on our ass (Gotta pay the rent)
I'm thinking foreign, so Christmas morning
Cars with ribbons on them make the broads get up on 'im
Niggas upstate, well, this one is for 'em (Yep)
Until you come home, I'ma keep on balling (Fo' sho')
Well, you can tell Kris Kringle (Tell him what?)
When he in the party he can bump my single
[Chorus: Jim Jones]
Christmas cheers (Yup)
Dipset's here (Yup)
Ballin' every day (It's Christmas time)

Deck the halls, it's a Dipset Christmas
We all ball, it's a Dipset Christmas
Fa-la-la-la-la, a Dipset Christmas
We fly high, it's a Dipset Christmas
Deck the halls, it's a Dipset Christmas
We all ball, it's a Dipset Christmas

[Chorus: Jim Jones]
Christmas cheers
Dipset's here
Ballin' every day

[Verse 3: J.R. Writer]
Uh, uh
No introduction, I'm the man on the mic
You all know the boy flyer than Santa at night
Me and Santa alike, know why? I'm getting cake here
I grab a ho-ho-ho, and make it rain, dear
So fix your face, queer, course I'm raw
On or off a tour, I'm a boss for sure
Talking war? Your doggie dog floss a four
That'll give you lead poisoning 'cause it's off the wall
I'm a player, fuck the constant haters (Fuck 'em)
Around here I call the shots like a commentator
These ain't your common gators stepping on a punk
I had to go get these fresh up out the swamp
Weaponry to launch, grab it out the pocket
You think, ""Damn, how this nigga carrying a rocket?""
Flashy for a profit
'Cause it's kind of funny that my lawyer kind of clumsy
How he catch a case and drop it
[Refrain: Stack Bundles]
Deck the halls, it's a Dipset Christmas
We all ball, it's a Dipset Christmas
Fa-la-la-la-la, a Dipset Christmas
We fly high, it's a Dipset Christmas
Deck the halls, it's a Dipset Christmas
We all ball, it's a Dipset Christmas

Christmas cheers

Broken Wings,Joe Budden,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro/Hook: Mr. Mister]
Baby, don't understand
Why we can't just hold on to each others hands

Take these broken wings
And learn to fly again
Learn to live so free
When we hear
The voices sing
The book of love
Will open up and let us in

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
The voices ain't leave yet, they just getting they feet wet
Eyes red, I'm up, ain't been to sleep yet
Damn near two days, ain't even eat yet
If you don't wanna bounce, 'least take a little recess
And still I'm faced with the bullshit
Feeling like Willy D, Scarface and Bushwick
Dog, just when I gather its dead
I gotta knock on wood like Hank Gather's head
When I make small steps toward making it global
My tight knit circle turns into a oval
Filled with motherfuckas just pretending they know you
These snakes in the grass'll do whatever to coax you
Since they wanna hem you quick, I walk around like a Ginsu's tip
And that's just to get a mental grip
You don't feel what the pencil scripts
Then 8 times outta 10, you ain't been through shit
When you hear Joe you hear the conviction and diction
That open emotion, devotion is different
Real talk of when he ain't have a pot to piss in
He ain't have a car not one rock to glisten
I'm giving 'em non-fiction, conning his addictions
Ya'll got the easy job: just listen
I do it for my folk and those of another pigment
A little food for thought, you feeling malnutrition
But you don't hear a peep outta me
About the black face going on and the sheep leading sheep
It's deep, so I try to stay grounded like dad
Must be in City Island, I'm surrounded by crabs
Was once tight, grew apart for dollars
Was on the same panel, now we Star and Barbara
2 different views, 2 different lifestyles
I think along the way one of us got confused
Look, you a hustla, still attracted to the scene
Still doing shit I gave up at 16
You won't get a job, believing your own lies
You rationalize by saying you pursing your dreams
You damn near 30, nigga, you ain't got cream
Can't take care of you when you worried 'bout your team
My dude, want a hand out, wait in line
But the clock's still ticking, man, you playing with time
It's so sweet
Thought I was fucked up with no shoes 'til I met me a nigga with no feet
Tried to help niggas, some niggas I couldn't
That's my mom in me, I love niggas I shouldn't
Dudes wanna shoot 'em 'til he nailed
Some wanna threaten me, ruin my health
Let me teach you a little something 'bout depression
Ain't shit you could do to me I ain't already thought about doing to myself
I'm the voice for the youth that's living with no reason
Fuck record sales, I give 'em something to believe in
If your day starts in that broken home
Though we never met, 'least they feel like they not alone
Like I was back when I was trying to find dip
The tsunami came through my hood in '96
And tried to murder dog, I took a little dive
Then I got on my surfing board and kept sliding
Feel like A-Rod, some say his time's up
Boo a nigga at home, yup, I'm in my prime But
He by far the best player on the team
And then turn around, drop 'em to the bottom of the lineup
Should get traded, but he don't wanna move
Cause this the only city he got something to prove
And that's why I'm seen with heaters
Cause you can't be the man when you on the same team as Jeter, ya dig
It's like the game ain't getting suitable
Making me so sick I need Chicken Noodle Soup
Rappers 'Fly High', then got suicidal
Imitate Jim Jones, end up like Cory Lidle
I married hip hop, ignored what some was telling me
I started hearing rumors of infidelity
I ain't divorce 'er
All the other dudes is so whack that I ain't even feel a little jealousy

Those Were the Days,Lady Sovereign,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Eh- this is my cheesy intro
And this is mine
(Right, Yes) It's Lady Sovereign, Big Midget
S-O-V
And this is a song all about I grew up, so yeah
Listen

[Verse 1]
We used to play jump the line
Or who could wrap the swing around the frame the most times, back in the day
Riding our bikes around the estate and playin' basketball in the cage, those were the days
I remember them water fights, the tap outside
Used to race our bikes
Grinnin' with two front teeth missing, we did what we liked
Those days I'm missin', those days were alright
Knock down ginger
Knock knock then shift
Two minutes later we got locked in the lift
Laughin' when we got out
Got into silly arguments about who found the pound on the ground
Popped to the shops bought about ten ice pops
The weather was hot so they melted in our pockets
Used to carry my belongings in them McDonalds bumbags
That was back then so boy don't mock it
[Hook]
Yeah Yeah
Yo, those were the days I will never forget
Yeah Yeah
Yo, those were the days I could never regret
Yeah Yeah
Yo, those were the days I will never forget
Yeah Yeah
Those were the days

[Verse 2]
We used to race down the hill in old Safeway trolleys
I wasn't indoors playing with Barbies or dollies
I was outside jumpin' off walls or playin' football
Or getting chased by the local pitbull
The odd character that every borough had
Mad Phillip, Gingerbeard or Mad Max
The places you wouldn't wanna see when you're on your jacks
In the places you wouldn't be in if you stuck to your packs
Stayed out till it was pitch black
Sprayed my name out on concrete slabs
And I never got bitch-slapped
Seen a couple of mans get stabbed
Been chased by the mad man
Gotta get back so I can
Catch a joke with my next door neighbor
We played the first Mortal Kombat on the Sega
Playing the latest jungle tunes we had on cassette
Those were the days I will never forget
[Hook]
Yeah Yeah
Yo, those were the days I will never forget
Yeah Yeah
Yo, those were the days I could never regret
Yeah Yeah
Yo, those were the days I will never forget
Yeah Yeah
Those were the days

[Verse 3]
Remember naf naf jackets, and spliffy jeans?
Adidas campus them things were in
It wasn't about the king of the bling
It was about the king of rim, or the king of the swing
Back then well I kinda had less
But less was much better cause it saved alot of stress
I hung out in Coffers community center
Now they've knocked it down and replaced it with an Asda
My parents way of tellin' us to get our backs in
Was them sounding some old fucking claxon
We soldier marched back up to Redcliffe walk
Chalkhill Estate don't exist no more it's just talk

[Hook]
Yeah Yeah
Yo, those were the days I will never forget
Yeah Yeah
Yo, those were the days I could never regret
Yeah Yeah
Yo, those were the days I will never forget

Watch Deez,Thirstin Howl III,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Thirstin Howl III]
I hit harder than Foreman, landin' both gloves to a low blow, with no cup
Leave you speechless like when Arrested Development broke up
Carry a crowbar for egos that won't budge
Crack skulls through helmets with the penetration of a screw nailed in
Return like I was sendin' self addressed postage
Throw bricks the size of the Stonehenge
Before battles we pour blood and toast, death to wicked infants
Found on the sorceress' doorsteps, slaughter lamb and boar's head
Every MC's cause of boredness and mind bondage
Bronchitis, lung failure, language unfamiliar
Art through a flooded air brush, rogue leaf craft
Sentences joined with words holdin' hands, it's a tight squeeze
From where your head will be landin'
In exact time flight leaves

[Hook]
Watch deez, watch deez, watch deez
Watch deez, don't watch deez, watch deez

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Whose arm is this? I must have cut it off at the pharmacist
That refused to renew my seventh prescription of Darvocets (Sorry!)
I'm the old man who lives upstairs and starves his pets
That never leaves his house 'cause he thinks his car's possessed
I hate my life that's why I degrade my wife
Grabbed a paper plate to make a sandwich and just ate the knife
My mother's screamin', ""Please, heal him, take him straight to Christ!""
Meet you in the street and slap you just to break the ice (What up? I'm Eminem)
Made a bomb threat with a fake device
Strip you naked twice, pistol-whip you and force you to take advice
And if you catch me bobbin' my head to some bullshit you was spittin'
I was probably just tryin' to shake the lice
Bugs fallin' out of my head, I'm wishin' I was dead
While I'm crawlin' out of my bed, piss and vomit red
And my rash is returnin', I feel the sensation of burnin'
Occurrin', usually during pain for release of my urine
Screamin' at my shadow, ""Please, quit followin' me!""
These pills keep screamin', ""Please, quit swallowin' me!""
The devil keeps screamin', ""Please, get down on one knee!""
I took the drugs before the cops ever found them on me

You drained your credit that's killing it

Repeating yourself like you got a stutter

People want to classify me as an Eminem
But hear what I'm a different kind of specimen
Just because I be a white Caucasian
Doesn't mean me and him are the same

Because one I'm not American, two I'm not a man
Three I'm coming through with a different kind of plan
Setting the facts straight cause I know that I can
Purely heavyweight cause I do the whole shebang

Categories I don't fit into any
Why I'm on so many styles I'm on many
Writing up more lines than Burberry
And dealing with beats like a victim of a bully
Make them drink my saliva off the floor
That spit that I spat when I walked in the door released my metaphor

So deep, drowning but I’m not in water
In Hell, inferno, inhale, breathe fire
In Heaven internally, exhale, leave Lucifer
Fail my objective, can never be President
Although I have all the criminal qualifications
So, no, I guess I’m just like Colin Powell
Lack of real power and blood on the conscience
Some Caucasians see black as being contagious
Their children love us and now act as strangers
Wish they could go back to days when they hang us
Man, them days they hung us is still among us
We got fake revolutionaries trying to mislead us
Won’t bust their guns.  In the head, they just beat us
Fight their own kind instead of ones who mistreat us
Mechanicals for revolution, Che Guevara never got ‘em
He couldn’t be bought by the demons who shot him
So don’t give me that “Power to the People” shit unless you’re
About this shit.  Too many niggas died for it
Old-timers known how to spot who’s legit
Real bankers are pros and know who’s counterfeit
Duo Live, “Free Lunch,” that’s who I’ll roll with
We’re out here exposing hoes and foes the way we should
Living good, not giving back to the hood
Shit changed.  The Klan’s black, wearing hoods
Prove me wrong?  I wish brothers would
In this song ‘cause I rather be wrong

[Verse 2: MF Grimm]
I learned
The worse devil in the world’s a black one
They’ll speak your language, talking slang, son
If detected, here’s come another one
Where these niggas coming from?  Bred with self-hatred
Eating master’s scraps, feeling that they made it
Black churches and buses firebombed and raided
Program American Hunger, so they ate it
Cook grams, iron chef, ghetto gourmet
Slow jams.  While get, high forget problems
No man’s an island, but each one’s a monster
Shit ain’t never gonna change, we can’t solve them
How can a nation build when they don’t love each other?
No promised land, only misery prolonged
But in this song, I rather be wrong

[Verse 3: MF Grimm]
Armstrong
Williams endorsed Bush to kill millions
Your skin is black, but, for you, I have no feelings
Your fouls are flagrant, you secret agent
I speak for a tribe still alive but lost
Your ancestors will haunt you ‘til you see the light
Condoleezza Rice, how you sleep at night?
I guess the Devil tucked you in real tight.  Take a
Look in a mirror, bitch, you are not white
What do they have on you?  Something ain’t right
The vow taken by the President at the inauguration:
Never let this become a nigga nation
But they’re like roaches, Plan B: space station
Just in case they get the heart, choose to fight
And want a war, can’t take it no more
Make these niggas literally reach for the stars
Throwing rocks will never reach Mars—can’t touch this
Kill ‘em off, see who survives the sequel
It’s un-American, niggas will never be equal
Fuck them jiggaboos, they’re not even people
It’s not a myth—they’re only three-fifths
Abe, that nigga lover, what was on his mind?
Probably had nigga in him, knew he was they kind
Now a nigga for life, that’s why pennies don't shine
[Verse 4: MF Grimm]
Show nonbelievers matters controlled by the brain
Grimm’s David Blaine, for the world, display pain
All those multiple contusions and bruising illusions
Magna Carta, OG Constitution
Twelve-Fifteen, master plan for prostitution
The king is a pimp wearing jewels to executions
Father against son, that was the revolution
We didn’t matter, so please don’t be flattered
Africa was shattered, our blood was splattered
I’ve died before, so I don’t fear
Took two thousand years for a nigga to reappear
Gotta kill me ‘cause I’m powerful, I know the deal
Memorize lines, go along with the script
Will my execution make my people flip?
Will disciples be trife and slip?  Please
Come together, all Bloods and Crips, make purple
Save your people

[Outro: MF Grimm]
They’re counting on you to kill yourselves.  It’s time for us to make a change.  I rather be wrong.  We’re now hanging ourselves.  There’s no excuse no more.  We gotta come together, we gotta get shit right.  Shit is too fucked up.  It’s been fucked up for a long time, man.  It’s beyond color though.  We just need to get our heads together.  People don’t realize what this world is for, man, this ain’t what... Shit ain’t for us to sit out here, fucking fighting each other.  Motherfuckers, think, man, think.  Life is too short for this shit.  Running around in circles, man, like rats in a maze"

Fresh out the  motherfuckin' pack (Right out the pack, son)
For niggas don't know how to act (No doubt, son)
Fresh out the  motherfuckin' pack (No doubt, son)
For niggas don't know how to act

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Yo, NYC, U-N-I-verse, seriously
Havoc and P — Queens niggas, so it seem to be
Monopolize, strategies of war, exercise
Mega got word back from Noreaga
The D.A. got video cassette tape of
The god with the God-U-Now, pullin' a caper
Runnin' up in the spot, mask and duct taped up
Pig-tie they motherfuckin' wrists to they ankles
I been through, crime shit my niggas into
Peep the issue, situation like this, we stickin him too
JFK on our way to L.A
Got links with big cats down in Santa Barbré
My crew do it the Mobb way, every day
Crime pay, who wanna gunplay? Thrill me
Niggas kill me, grillin' me, you wanna look? Peep the nine milli
Now undress, you know the drill-y
Niggas suspect, weak links pose threats
I have yet to met challenger who go against my set
Gemstars razor sharp like Gillette, shavin' closely on
Any character approach me
I let the streets get the best of me, infamy, my destiny
While cat burg-lars tryin' to sneak peep the recipe
Inside my rap cookbook, paragraphs is gourmet
You pay about $5,000 a plate
[Verse 2: Havoc & Prodigy]
No doubt, kid, I hit them niggas like a bid
The prosecutor, runnin' up in your crib
Do your dirt, I do my dirt all by my lonely
It's only me, and the gat that's holdin' me
We got it locked beyond measure, your clique's under pressure
Extort you for your treasure, smack you with the undresser
Represent your clique, go ahead, get that ass whipped
Floatin' in a river wit' your body wrapped in plastic
Wannabe thug get smacked for back talkin'
QB represent, fuck that, it can happen
While you rappin', I'm busy tryin' to sneak the gat in
Contamin', cut the party short while you jammin'
We think smarter, reach harder
Got the .44, bodyguard of somethin' you don't want a part of
If I was you, then I would do what I have to
But you ain't me, you hesitated so I clapped you
Then stepped off casually, naturally me

[Verse 3: Nas]
Niggas thinkin' shit sweet, I carry big heat
Wavy hair, chipped teeth, up in this bitch deep
Queens murder cliques meet
Yellow tape on black gates
Mediterranean, projects is like Kuwait
I escape into zones that's irregular
Why debate on a phone? I'm solar cellular
Escobar 600
You just a crumb inside a world where the rich run it
Curriculum of a mathologist
Deep throats, they try to swallow this, anthropologists
Dynasties of great knowledgists I preserve in my dome
Niggas' mics is full of silicone, spot's blown
Guerilla ice on this killer's life, I put my word on it
Now, you can sleep on or rock a swerve on it
Nas is ménage à trois on Mount Airy Lodges
We like a smooth fam', but rougher than how DeBarge is
Catchin' charges of marksmen, livin' heartless
Grab a cartridge, cock my shit on some Mobb shit
We mobbin', puttin' niggas in mausoleums
From Queens 'cross to Throgs Neck, heads bop, I see 'em!

You need to check your homie but not tonight
You involved in something thats oh so right
Lay some pipe, sip on some remy and stay the night
Close the vertical blinds searching for line
Medical physical burden of mine
Un button her blouse
How can I obtain this inner ambitous lust
Roll back yo gucci dress
Recieve the touch, sexual thoughts
That leading us, is it me or you who tried to resist
Got you convinced lost in the mist
Grabbing the sheets and balling her fists
Close your eyes go deeper than this
Ex-hale and carress, the way it was meant
I guess its another way that we vent
But please don't hickey lick me
Wishful whisper
What you need I'm going to get the entire picture

Da kinda azz dat make you wanna grab a handle on
And fuck her all day in da hallway with the candlez on
So I wave, and I speak and conversation coo

We can still get togetha, cuz I'm gon be hea fo a coupla dayz""
And then she say, she never been ta Georgia, she was dyin ta visit

If I ain't welcome shawty, don't invite me, ain't no need ta pretend

One of'em say she wanna drive me to Coney Island so she can show me the new beach
Couldn't nobody ride wit me doe, cuz da car only had 2 seatz
Lil' cute freak, in da Z3, remind me of one of my hoez in da GC

Say she'd love ta freak me, reminisce while listenin to mah CD

Laugh at me throw some cash at me then fly pass me
But one ricochets off the wall to come back and ask me
Am I scared of him or the ""nigga that blast me""
Or maybe just the hammer that goes to be a hole in an innocent bystander
My eye's a camera my ear's a microphone
My mind is Pro Tools my head is a stool
Whats recorded in my dome gets reported when I zone
My mouth is a speaker I'm anchoring the misery
There's no friends the enemy of my enemy is my enemy
Beakers and test tubes full of memories
In my labatory I create stories
Doze off then wake up surrounded by Forties
Wit Glocks tucked in they labels
And they caps is baseball hats
Playin poker at a table
Cigarettes massage they shoulders in belly tops showin off they navels
A dime sack side bets, a tech is runnin' for president
Jesus pieces walk around with niggas hangin' from they necks
Monopoly is playin' chess
I just picked up an obituary of a bullet proof vest
Put the headphone on my mouth speak into my ears
Yea microphone check, check, check, check, check
Check, a pair of Air Forces told me Rims've been extinct for years
Been ethnic cleansed by Jersey's tryna take over the set
And Television is on deathrow for killing BET and MTV over a dice game
And paralyizing CNN by knifing him in the neck
I hear Clear Channel's been fightin' him in the rec
Who's in for givin' grape Kool-Aid laced with strychnine to mixtapes and arm robbin' cassettes
Dope told me Weed was a crack fiend but Crack told me that Dope was a base head
Hi-hats told police he was just a soldier he did what the Bass said
The Snare and the Kick didn't make it out alive
The Sample made it out with some money but he died in the ride
The 808 got caught wit some work (He ain't never comin' home)
So the MPC's and the MP3's is fightin over his turf
Sean Don just gave birth
But she's thinkin' bout leavin it on the doorstep of a church
Cristal can't have kids she plottin' to kidnap it that she orchestrated with a purse
But Gucci told Fendi and Fendi turned and around and told Henny
And Henny is Moets baby's father
But she tried it anyway disguised as a nurse
In the newspapers it says ""Hip-Hop called Rock n Roll racist""
The Six ripped the Five and the Maybach taped it
A Hundred dollar bill just signed a record deal
But he blew all his money on the Braceletes
And givin' the Gold Dollar a face lift
A Button Up just drove by in a 6-4 Impalla
All the Rolex's is hatin' you see the smirks on they faces
The Havatampas is defending the Dutchess they keep catchin cases
But the judge is a Swisha he just give em iBonds and community service with the Papers
So the Newport's is gettin mad at the ZigZags then out come the razors
See the Kool's is killers on the creep
Rush up on the Philly, leave his guts spillin on the street
Some Gold Grills burned down the building of some teeth
Some Sharpened Tooth Brushes is holding the trampoline cuz some children finna to leap
I just seen Rocawear rock Sean John to sleep with the same heat that Baby Phat carried

And ain't no doubt comin' out he gon' wreck you not
Pass me the satin loc so I can wet my throat
While I sag the blue khakis with the Raider coat

Rough and don't give a fuck—ain't that right, Kurupt?
I stay bangin' on these niggas on a regular basis
Big paper chases, facin' felony cases
Made it to be famous, livin' hard and dangerous
Steppin' on these bustas in my blue Chuck Taylor's
[Hook: Kurupt + (Slip Capone)]
C-Walk, homie
C-Walk, homie
C-Walk, homie
(Hah, Hawthorne is in the house)
C-Walk, homie
(And we C-Walkin', ya dig it?)
C-Walk, homie

[Verse 3: Slip Capone]
You know that gangstas rock, gangstas roll
Here's the gangsta shit, we on a gangsta stroll
'Cause gangstas ride, gangstas slide
In the gangsta ride with the gangsta glide
'Cause gangstas move and gangstas groove
Most gangstas got nothin' to lose
Gangstas live, and gangstas die
Gangstas form a gang and the gang multiply
Gangstas give a fuck, a G don't ask why
Gangstas don't snitch, and gangstas don't cry
Gangstas boogie, gangstas don't dance
Gangsta pull the strap out yo' pants and blast
Gangstas don't run and gangstas don't hide
I'm a gangsta-ass nigga from the sick Southside
That's how I know exactly what a gangsta do
You love the gangsta shit, ain't you a gangsta too?
Then C-Walk, homie!
[Hook/Outro: Kurupt]
C-Walk, homie
Slip Capone—C-Walk, homie!
O.G. Tray Deee—C-Walk, homie!
Kurupt, Dat Nigga Daz, Soopafly
Now walk on 'em!
C-Walk, homie
C-Walk, homie
Now walk on 'em!"

Youngin, don't make my sails rise (Uh)
I shoot you out your chukkas
Pusha hear the whispers of all you motherfuckers
Papa said stay free of them suckers
Minus the wicked jumper, street baller like the Rucker
Skip to my Lou if you lookin' for a couple
Roosters in the duffle
Keep the hood screaming, ""Cock-a-doodle doo,"" fuckers
Coke by the ton, rap niggas, I'm the one
With basic rhyme pattern, how the fuck you tryna chatter?
ASIC-ass rappers, got 'em runnin' for they life
I philosophize about Glocks and keys
Niggas call me Young Black Socrates
West Indies bitch drop to knees quick (What?)
With dreams of being a rich man's bitch
Feel sorry for niggas pull triggers and they shit click
So many bullets jammed in my shit, call me Lead Fist
Shake the diamonds out my wrists
[Chorus: Pusha T & Pharrell]
Mama, I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
I don't fear Tubbs and Crockett
Mama, I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
Got two hot rocks in my pocket
Mama, I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
Big home, palm trees, and watches
Mama, I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
My only accomplice my conscience, uh

Youngin, learn from me, let's not be at odds
We're more like than not, two peas of a pod
Same hustle, 'cept my hustle now flows
I once gave it away at thirty grams an O
That accounts for all them days in the cold
Feels like kids and cake mix, can't wait to lick the bowl
But it's a bigger picture, holmes, trust, I done seen it
From Frankfurt to Cologne, Oslo to Sweden
From Italy's Milan to the shores of Napoli
Now I consider Ferrari and Salvador Dalis
I'm no longer local, my thoughts are global
That's why I seem distant, son, expand your vision
Even adored by Norwegian woman
Blonde hair and blue eyes, I'm gettin' back with a vengeance
Whip it like they want me all attached to the kitten
And then they wonder in these raps if I'm kiddin', huh

Mama, I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
I don't fear Tubbs and Crockett

Sorry, Heavenly Father, once again, I hate to bother
It's P the evil creeper, send some to the Grim Reaper
Meanwhile, me and my missus like Solomon and Sheba

It don't take much to get rid of you
Once I send for you, better call a minister, ugh

[Verse 4: Malice]
I'm sorry, grandmama, for mistakes I have made
When I aired family business, how you put me in my place
Even my baby mama, I can't look you in the face
'Cause I can't do enough, you a symbol of God's grace
So I place you in the flowerbed, porcelain showerhead
Throughout the house and keep the youngins' mouths fed
And when I'm gone, I hope it is said
I gave structure to the youth by the example I led, uh

Vivid,Chop,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
The city crawls of silly broads and many more
I sin for sure, have pity Lord, it isn’t choice
If any more, I’m penny poor with no voice
I feel allure in liquor stores and gettin' whores
The flip of raw will switch friends into enemies
A little war that could twist spin you mentally
I seen good men slip to memories
We woulda popped Crys, not methamphetamines
Off of the centerpiece, reppin' that Chesapeake
Kids know of violence, but they can barely speak
No real therapy, we get it necessarily
Making sure I never think by smokin' on that mary-leaf
Scandalous hoes, and these fraudulent niggas
Couldn’t care for they own, it's all part of the picture
Got no heart in December, no pockets in winter
Some niggas survive, other niggas will give up
That’s the beauty of life, we all been in a fight
If it wasn’t with fists, then it’s one with what's right
Ain’t no love in this nigga, can you handle the price?
Wrong hood and you dead, so I handle the mic
Can’t stay out the ghetto, can’t stay out the prison
How many licks a nigga hit, to them is realism
That hood mentality, can’t understand what's killin' 'em
But shit, I still feel it, sometimes, I’m stealin' 'em
Test my dough or my respect, then I act savage
I still remember when I first clapped an automatic
Just to think how fast a man’s life could be retracted
Had me ready to pop off in every static
Then I realize most cats ain’t built, homie
If you ain’t willin' to die then don’t grill on me
I stay to myself, cause niggas real phony
Once you speaking to beats, you’ll never feel lonely
I did this shit myself, while y'all ain’t potty trained
I’m tryna mob on 'em, I’m in my Gotti lane
With my work ethic, this shit gotta change
The disbelievers can spit-shine the Bugatti paint
I gotta aim, I gotta fam, and I must provide
All this talk of the Illuminati, where can I sign?
I rather give water to Ghana than sell rocks
I rather visit the Grammies before a cell block

Don't ? to 'em
Vi-vi-vi-vi-vi-vi-vi-vi-vivid

[Verse 2]
Paranoia; my life's story in one word
Grip a knife, my only slice of comfort
Stay inside to minimize the gun burst
But my killah side'll slip alive and come first
Funny how you can be popular and feel alone
In my city and I never really feel at home
Is it the skill or the appeal that my will will grow?
Hope to my put city on, just for them to steal to my show
So I view the earth through one eye and less angles
I’m just here to fuck the world and let the sex strangle
That success will box you in like a rectangle
Wanted shine since I was five, singin' the Star Spangled
Can’t let the thing change you, but I don’t gotta cause
And we ain’t talkin' 'bout the money, we don’t got to floss
Just tryna corkscrew they mind 'till they top come off
And light that shit on flames, a brain Molotov
Been said fuck the law, I ain’t need a Wikileak
The government’s corruption all erupted on the city-street
Some wanna live in peace, others gotta live and eat
Flip-a-Key, and all of Virginia isn’t Virginia beach
This life will be the end of me and many more
My enemy that’s mentally, slippin' through every pore
And that stress left a double edge on every sword
Either I'm pushin' for the best, or I'm pennies short
So floored with raw emotions that you can’t record
In accord, I act cold like I’m in a morgue
The less you know about me, the better chance I win the war
Pack my soul in a bottle, let the Philly torch
If you never felt passion, don’t know the half if it
Work, but success is just determined by an asterisk
If you do it for love, need a plan in back of it
Tell 'em bout ya dreams and you’ll only get a laugh from 'em
Some will never understand how much we sacrifice
A steady check, our respect, and our very life
If you ain’t for it, it ain’t important to hear you speak
The type to think they Jordan just for puttin' on his sneaks

Ball so hard it's like I brought the game with me
Left my glove so white you thought I brought Jermaine with me
'Bout to paint a perfect picture like I brought the frame with me

I got niggas tryin' to sue me, bitches tryin' to do me

Get ya out the White House, go back to your efficiencies

He leaned over and told me, ""Just don't retire on 'em
And when they give ya they shoulders, never cry on 'em
And when they love you to death, just never die on 'em""
And the question still remains
Have I counted all the money that I've managed to obtain?
Niggas dedicatin' overtime to damagin' my name

Just a Friend,Biz Markie,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait?
Let me tell a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour, at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got on stage, drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear, ""Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if ya hundred proof""
I asked her her name, she said: ""Blah-blah-blah""
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said: ""How do you like the show?"" She said: ""I was very amused""
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, ""Do ya have a man?"", she tried to pretend
She said: ""No, I don't, I only have a friend""
Come on!
I'm not even goin' for it, this is what I'm goin' sing
[Chorus]
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

[Verse 2]
So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jack
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named ""blah-blah-blah"" that adored me
So we started talkin', gettin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time, so we can build a
Relationship or some understanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Every time that I called her, it seemed somethin' was brewin'
I called her room, a guy picked up, but then I called again
I say: ""Yo, who was that?"" ""Oh, he's just a friend""
Don't gimme that, don't even gimme that!
Jus' bust this
[Chorus]
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

[Verse 3]
So, I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl, that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I was on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrived in front of the dormitory
""Yo, could you tell me where is door three?""
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So, I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in her mouth
I was so in shock, my heart went down south
So please, listen to the message that I send
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend..."

Pussy's the temptation, dick's the persuasion
All hoes suck cock nigga how you play 'em?
That's why I don't sleep on 'em, I just freak on 'em
Stick dick in they mouth; take it out and I skeet on 'em
The nigga the one-nighter, the bitch exciter
I only love my hoes when I'm going up inside her
Problem number one is getting money
I'd rather taste the green than sip the honey
So don't expect nothing cause I ain't offering
I go hard on my bitches, cause I'm never never softening
Putting the demand on 'em, fuck 'em and scram on 'em
The ""wham, bam, thank you ma'am"" game is ran on 'em
So fuck how you feel, your fucking cheap thrill
I hope you took the pill cause I won't pay the bill
Getting pussy's just another expense
If pussy pays the bills then dick pays the rent
I only need a ho for one thing and that's to cum
I've got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one, ha

[Interlude: Ice-T & Brother Marquis]
Ha! Yo Marquis my motherfucker you got problems man?
(A bitch ain't one) Aww shit!
Now let me tell you how to do this shit
[Verse 4: Ice-T & Brother Marquis]
I got a bitch that loves to G
She'll fuck you right after she fucks me
I got a bitch who loves both
I got a bitch who loves handcuffs and ropes
I got a bitch that's fast, a bitch that's slow
A bitch that's a virgin and a bitch that's a ho
A bitch that lies
A bitch that's true
A bitch who's a man because they're bitches too
I got a bitch that's cool
A bitch that's hot
A bitch who loves rap, a bitch who loves rock
A bitch who's lost and one who knows where it's at
She gets up under me and purrs like a cat
I got a bitch that runs, I got a bitch that walks
I got a bitch that yells, I got a bitch who talks
I got a bitch that's dirty, got a bitch that's neat
I got a super fine bitch that I knocked in the swap meet
And I love 'em all, I love 'em crazily
And they love me back - that's why they stay with me
So if you having girl problems, I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one - hit me...

[Hook]
No a bitch ain't one
Huh, you know a bitch ain't one

[Outro: Ice-T & Brother Marquis]
Youknahmsayin? I got problems with my mothafuckin' rent Marquis
But a bitch ain't one
Man you got yourself nothing man
Fuck them raggedy stank-ass hoes nigga
A bitch ain't one
I got a problems staying out here on these streets
With the police trying to take a nigga out, y'know?
But a bitch ain't one
Got problems with motherfuckers.. buying my records
But a bitch ain't one
Fuck 'em all, nigga fuck them motherfuckers
Youknahmsayin? A bitch ain't one
Got problems man
All them motherfuckers can kiss my mothafuckin' ass.. for real
Really, niggas worrying about bitches
They better, they better find something else to worry about"
Us,Brother Ali,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Brother Ali]
Started rhymin' just to be somebody
To make people notice me at the party
And not be just the new kid that's Albino
Make 'em say
""Yeah I know, but have you heard him rhyme though?""
Now take that same party around the globe
And my story connected with a lot of folks
I hope so cause that's the only thing that I know
I know it so well I tell it with my eyes closed
And I go with the feeling from the start
Blind in the eye, so I see you with my heart
And to me all y'all look exactly the same
Fear, faith, compassion and pain
And try as we may to mask, it remains
Such as your religion or your past or your race
The same color blood just pass through our veins
And tears taste the same when they splash on your face
The World's getting too small to stand in one place
It's like we're roommates just sharing a space
Can't separate and still carry the weight
Gotta heal, get away from the fear and the hate
Gotta shake free from them chains
You see what remains, just a human being end of the day
Don't matter to me what name you gave your spiritual plane
Close your eyes and you'll see what I'm sayin
Uh, I started rhymin just to be somebody
I found out that I already was
Cause can't nobody be free unless we're all free
There's no me and no you, it's just us
""Street Preacher"" what a fan once called me
I've been called worse and tried to live up
Hope you don't mind a few more stories
I swear to God y'all, I tell 'em with love"

[Intro: Wu-Tang Clan]
Good Morning Vietnam!
Yeah, good morning
To all you motherfuckin' knotty-headed niggas
Word to the camouflage large niggas
Bitch, where the fuck is my bottle?
Bring that fuckin' meth in here!
Yo, yo, yo
Now we gonna drink some good Night train
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Champion gear that I rock, you get your boots knocked
Then attack ya like a pit, then, lock shit down
As I come and freaks the sound, hardcore
But givin' you more and more like ""Ding!""
Nah, shorty, get you open like six packs
Killa Beez attack, flippin' what? Murder one phat tracks, aight?
I kick it like a Nike Flight
Word life, I get that ass robbed on spite
Check the method from Bedrock, 'cause I rock your head to bed
Just like rockin' what? Twin Glocks!
Shake the ground while my beats just break you down
Raw sound, goin' to war right now
So, yo, bombin', We-Usually Take-All-Niggas-Garments
Save your breath before I vomit

[Verse 2: Method Man]
I be that insane nigga from the psycho ward, I'm on the trigger
Plus I got the Wu-Tang sword, so how you figure
That you can even fuck with mine?
Hey, yo, RZA! Hit me with that shit one time!
And pull a foul, niggas, save the beef for the cow
I'm milkin' this ho, this is my show, Tical!
The fuck you wanna do on this mic piece, duke?
I'm like a sniper, hyper off the ginseng root
PLO Style, buddha monks with the owls
Now, who's the fuckin' man? Meth-Tical

[Break: Method Man (Inspectah Deck)]
On the chessbox
""Wu-Tang style""

[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
Yo, yeah, yo
I leave the mic in body bags
My rap style has the force to leave ya lost like the Tribe of Shabazz
Murderous material made by a madman
It's the mic wrecker, Inspectah, bad man
From the bad lands of the Killa
Rap fanatic, representin' with the skill that's iller
Dare to compare, get pierced just like your ear
The Shooby Doo-Wop pop, strictly hardware
Armed and geared 'cause I just broke out the prison
Charged by the system for murderin' the rhythm
Now, lo and behold another deadly episode
Bound to catch another fuckin' charge when I explode!

[Verse 4: Ghostface Killah]
Slammin' a hype-ass verse 'til your head burst
I ramshack dead in the track, and that's that
Rap assassin, fast and quick to blast in hardrock
I ran up in spots like Fort Knox
I'm hot! Top notch, Ghost thinks with logic
Flashbacks how I attacked your whole project
I'm raw, I'm rugged and raw! I repeat
If I die, my seed'll be ill like me
Approachin' me, yo, out of respect, chops to neck
I get vexed, like crashin' up a phat-ass Lex
So, clear the way! Make way! Yo, open the cage!
Peace, I'm out, jettin' like a runaway slave

[Verse 5: RZA]
You gettin' stripped from your garments, boy, run your jewels
All the meth got me open like Fallopian tubes
I bring death to a snake when he least expect
Ain't a damn thing changed, boy, Protect Ya Neck!
Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah, jam is fatal
Quick to stick my Wu-Tang sword right through your navel
Suspenseful force bein' brought through my utensil
The pencil, I bring strong winds up against you
Havoc, then run through your county like the Maverick
Caps through the tablets, I gots to make the fabrics

[Verse 6: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
A-a-a-ah-ah, are you a warrior, killer? Slicin' shit like a samurai?
The Ol' Dirty Bastard from the bar!
Ol' Dirty clan of terrorists
Comin' at your ass like a sorceress, shootin' that piss
Niggas be gettin' on my fuckin' nerves
Rhymes they be kickin' make me wanna kick they fuckin' ass to the curb
Boy got funky fresh like the Old Specialist
A carrier, messenger, bury ya
This experience is for the whole experience
Let it be applied, Unique, drop that science!

[Verse 7: GZA]
My-My-My-My clan is thick like plaster, bust ya, slash ya
Slit a nigga back like a Dutch Master
Killer style jumped off in Killa Hilla
I was the thriller in the Ali-Frazier Manila
I came down with phat tracks that combine and interlock
Like gettin' smashed by a cinder block
Poaw! Now it's all over
Niggas seein' pink hearts, yellow moons
Orange stars and green clovers"

In tha Park,Ghostface Killah,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Frank Dukes]

[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
One, two
Yeah, niggas don't know about Fatback
With the different color records they had back in the days
You know what I mean? The belt-driven turntables, the Technic joints
(With the slipmats)
Put nickels on the needles so the motherfuckin' record won't jump
The needle won't skip and shit
Gettin' juice from the fuckin' light poles
Shout out to the Bronx, nigga!

[Verse 1: Ghostface]
Aye, yo, this shit go way back like a Uni marker, kid
Bombing the D train and hit the Bronx up
Krylon bandits attack, Planet Rock, Bambaataa
Peace to Pelan discovering rap
And the DJ that made the first scratch
Paved the way for Flex, Mister Cee, 'nuff of them cats
See, this rap shit came at a time that was accurate
Twenty-something years later, I mastered it
Seen light poles get used for power
I was a little nigga
Couldn't stay out late, I was sour
So I sat by the window, heard the DJ cut
""Impeach the Pres"", ""Apache"", and ""Just Begun""
Otis Redding, ""Tramp""
The music stopped, guess the system blew out one of his amps
It'd take a little while, then it come back on
Somebody stepped on the wire and shit, that's all
Now everybody's back in the groove, echo chamber
""Check one two, one two"", that's my favorite
Strobe lights is live, Pink Champale
Little pink joints being lit up on the side
Couple niggas had two fives
Other than that, cleared a circle in the park and shoot five
Girls wore they Lees and jellies
Jordache and Lees, Tale Lords fit the fellys
Samster Barons and Kangol buckets, BVD's
Go with the Sergio's like, fuck it
Seen the stamp on that Crazy Eddie
Niggas coming back from the Funhouse dusted
Throwing bubbles on the wall
[Hook: Ghostface]
We must remind you
Where this rap come from
Yes my brother, my sister
It's our duty, we must remind you
Hip hop was set out in the park
We used to do it out in the dark

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Yo, it all started at the After Midnight, Philly, but walk with me
Mad niggas coming down from New York City
Prolly hit the skating rink USA
Banging Schoolly, ""Gangster Boogie"" and ""PSK""
I remember shells, Gazelles, top tens, and lottos
Mega design, reefer smoke, Coqui nine bottles
[Entire wore velours, call the boys with the Lucci wore?]
84's from Atlantic City Gucci store
Linoleum break dancing, Rust-Oleum cans
I put the writing on the wall signed, ""Truly yours""
Philly smashed '87 Music Seminar
Out on the battlefield like Pat Benatar
Kick the ball with Krown Rulers out of Camden
People Patty Duke-ing in the party, all cramped in
Around the time Flav started cold lamping
""Rebel Without a Pause"" was the street anthem
Old Memorex cassette, tape collections
Bright spotlights on all the fights at the Spectrum
When the Fresh Fest come, leather bombers and sheepskins
Brothers would bust they guns to get one
MC Breeze, Disco C, Jazzy Jeff
Cash Money and Miz and Lady B
Everybody banging ""Sucker MC's"" in '83
I was South Philly like St. Charles and Crazy D
Them wild North Side Puerto Ricans would snuff you
Twenty deep in a Ford Escort, pumping the Tuff Crew
I used to follow my cousin, he was a buck too
""Y'all don't like how I'm living, well, fuck you!""
I been a G since a little kid
Sticking my head up into somebody's dollar party, getting into shit
And late nights, shoulda been in bed
Instead, I was running round with them downtown lemonheads
A little man, hanging where them grown women is
Under thirteen, seeing real strong images
And that's the reason for my real rap penmanship
That's where I started it, and that's where I'mma finish it

AssMilk,"Tyler, The Creator","['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator, Earl Sweatshirt]
Uh, addicts arise when I arrive
In this cracked crack fag back slab in disguise
Fat sack of knives in the passenger side
Bitch, reach for the door, get your access denied
I'm not an asshole, I just don't give a fuck a lot
The only time I do is when a bitch is screaming ""Tyler, stop!""
The big bad wolf; to me, you're just a minor fox
Red Riding is getting some of this wolfly odder cock
We the niggas you scared of like bad dentists
Flow is anthemic, dirty like it's plants in it
Sick, spit a pandemic, crack and cancer mixed with cannabis
To have a bitch ready to stab a clit with some glass and shit
Your whole gang'll be diminished, bunch got the Brady's in it
Spit sick shit like my saliva got the rabies in it
Fuck rap, I'll be a landlord so I can rape the tenant's daughter
Leave my house with a new stomach, and a baby in it
Face it, me and Ace is sick like malaria carri—

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator, Earl Sweatshirt]
""Augh! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, stop!""
""Why did you do that?""
""Say sorry, say sorry!""
""Sorry! I'm sorry as fuck!

""I fucked this nigga eye up man haha""
[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator, Earl Sweatshirt]
Face it, me and Ace is sick like malaria carriers
Jim Carrey her to the cemetery to bury her
Listen busters, scarier when I finger fuck her
After I dig her up and then eat her out with a bit of mustard
Took karate, mommy told me ""Tyler toughen up""
Rihanna haircut, somebody tell Chris Brown to fuck me up
Had to teach the bitch manners, now I gotta learn her
I'll beat the fuck out your bitch anonymous, Ike Turner
Over, sloppy seconds is my preference
Except for when I'm feeding on the flesh of a pedestrian
Nessy loch monster stop Will he though? Probably not
Silly hoes lick my balls like FIFA lollipops
Get the certain tingle, eating Häagen-Dazs
With some soccer moms where they like to fucking sit and mingle
Watch an Animal Planet document on the Eagles
In the flyest '06 Supreme beanie, Sigel
Your grind's feeble, I'm regal, really, I'm Willy Smith
I am Legend, a snicker dick in a vanilli chick
Come take a stab at it faggot, I pre-ordered your casket
This is known as a classic, yeah that chapped lips crack shit
Hat is always forest so the bitches call me Gump
But compliment her tits and then its off to hump her
Fuck her in a Hummer while I rape her then I put her in a slumber
It's not a figure of speech when I tell you that I dumped her
Known narcissists, sipping on arsenic
Carved carcasses in the garage, don't park in it
Hard as finding retarded kids at Harvard
It's Wolf Gang barking keep you up like car alarms and shit
Over the edge, yeah I hide in a potato sack
'Cause I'm cold as ice like Anasia when she fucking Traq
I'm the type to put you down to bring myself up
So when I rape a bitch I hold her down and get my best nut
The reincarnation of '98 Eminem
60 Crip and Grizzly and some RMK Denim
Pay attention I'm stabbing your women friends, like a gentleman
Then dipping with the fucking pen to go sin again
White girl, you can ask her what the dick be like
At monster madness doing drive by's on a fucking fixie bike
Fuck it, moron, snorting oxycontin, wearing cotton
Oxymoron like buff faggots playing sissy dikes
This the shit that get cripple bitches to hop
Dirty crack pipes lit, bullshit to stop, halt
Boss broke, spouse choke, blouse open
Sly's little shop of horrors, now showing
I hate gays, gangbangers and fucking jerkers
Unless it's gay gangbangers, that's fucking jerkers
Whoa yo, yo.. no homo, I'm not gay, faggot
Odd Future Wolf Gang, Wu-Tang banging in your system
Probably banging in your sister
With my children swimming in her system
Let me say this shit in slow-mo, homo
You don't fucking skate, take off that box logo"

The final hour is approaching for the people of Earth
Hear this

[Verse: MF DOOM]
She said ""Excuse me, villain, you be illin' with the wordplay""
He said ""Thank you very much, I'm billin' 'till Thursday""
Once heard a beat drum it sounded like a sloppy knock
Whoever was on the mic, speech is pure poppycock
These go back to the days of pop lock
Even back to rumors that Mikey died off pop rocks
Where the girls wore jellies and played hop scotch
Older broads used to wear tennises and sloppy socks
APB, the three-headed with the fancy crown
Last seen headed towards a city in shanty town
All of a sudden can't be found
Safe and sound, mouth on the nipple, panties down
Put a choke hold on the monster from Ogopogo
Whoever did they vocals and also they so-so logo
That's a no-no
Through the wheels of steel, phono
Geedorah, no deals pro bono

She was the modern Isis, honey thought she was priceless
Perfect definition what a wife is, I like this
Showed me how exciting life is
I used to hang around dudes that used ice picks
The sheistiest, put you on they heist list
How we met it must have been fate
First date, crushed grapes, we ate lobster and steak
She kept asking questions how the cash made how my rent's paid
How many guns I sprayed and huns I laid
She said she want to have a family raise kids someday
Like out in Beverly Hills she wanna live one day
I can get with that I drop you off home
I call you hit me back
I wanna dig that and did I? I did that
Put it way up where her ribs at, her future kids had
You held out for two weeks, longer than these hoodrats
You precious, more precious than lost treasure
Matter of fact I'm kinda hoping we can stay together

I see you dressed up in white face covered in veil
Do I hear wedding bells? My dogs throwing rice
And it's the day that your father give you away
To a real man that gently put the ring on your hand
Do we vow to stay faithful? Do more than try to
Now, look me in my eyes and say I do
Driving off in the Rolls Royce just married on the plates
We can spend our honeymoon in the States
You can throw your friend the bouquet
Something in the back of my head say
For us two, maybe cause I love you
Hug you, squeeze you, touch you, tease you
As long as we together it's heaven for me to please you
Won't stop 'til I tell you me to, beautiful
Deeper and harder love laying new with you
Running my fingers through your hair it's like days can go by
While I'm with you and I won't even care, word

She been with young dudes, old guys, Hindus, pa-pi's
Colombians who cut pies, but none of them can touch Nas
Thug ones to those soft as baby shit
She been with hoodlums and those who had crazy chips
'Til one day she decided to flip
It was nutting I can do about it, like she the boss and shit
Started talking this divorcing shit
I gave her my half rib, half my crib, half my cake
Half my car, half my kids? Can't get that
Tried to swing on the God, had to dip that
Yo, push her on the bed, lift her leg, had to rip that
All she wanted was rough sex, with her slick ass
Had to sit back, smoke a blunt and just look
With a fine-ass body and a damn good cook
For some reason yo she had me stuck and I had her in my web too
You my queen, God bless you

But you could become the first white rapper slain

And you nigga, I'ma send you to mommy
With strict orders from Gotti to hide the body
And Dre, your day's comin' too, 'cause I got a team of misfits

'Cause, I'm SHOOTIN', at all y'all niggas
And Lil Mo, you just one of them bitches

Man of the Year,Drake,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Drake]
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
Think I had the motherfucking plan of the year
Which was simply to make groupie fans of my peers
And I get my girl whatever she desire
And my niggas get whatever they require
These rappers old, I’m the reason they expire
Plus I got a city that I Carey like Mariah
Damn, that punch line was predictable
I still got you shitting bricks, homie quit the bull
And we don’t need new members, to me the clique is full
And I be getting the same women that Tip can pull
Believe or not, I receive a lot
So I be wearing the same Gucci that Jeezy got
And I be buying the Louis that Kanyeezy cop
And I be ripping the same records that Weezy rock
This shit is easy pop
That’s why I’m ready man
I’d never copy Nor-bit like Eddie man
Did you get it? Eddie Murphy was in Norbit
Or was it way over your head, did you forfeit?
Yeah, I take a woman shopping in a store quick
Her ass big, she just trying to make a four fit
Yeah, they need to issue out a recall
I’m going up and they heading into a freefall
The fundamentals are needed, you playing streetball
And I was out at BET, but I didn’t see ya’ll
These Skee-Lo rappers wishing they could be tall
Letting all their fake friends use them like a free stall
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch ’round me
Cause, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
No, ain’t no nigga like me
Ya dig

[Verse 2: Drake]
I said I know you see me chilling super low key
If I’m with the right niggas, you can scoop an O.Z
All the hustlers and the bouncers and the groupies know me
Fresh denim, fresh shades in a coupe with no keys
It start up when I touch the door
And I encourage ladies to touch the floor
As soon as we finish cutting, we can cut some more
Then after you get high
Make em, get em, girl you finna get low
Lights dimmed down
Got a lota dough plus a hit sound
What you mean you ain’t heard? I come highly recommended
Everybody my friend even if they been offended
They ain’t really got a choice, it’s an obvious decision
You tryna make a come up in my city, it’s a given
Plus a nigga famous, plus I got a vision
Not to mention having bars like a motherfucking prison
They taking too long, their records on hold
They threatened by my presence cause I make them feel old
Guaranteed if they drop, they bragging bout what they sold
Just remember where I live at, fifty thousand's going gold
Holla at me when you see me, make yourself known
Instead of hatin’ on my music in the comfort of your home
Nigga, be a man, you acting like a bitch
I ain’t acting like I’m rude
I’m just acting like I’m rich, rich
Riding with Weezy fucking Baby
Are you the type of girl that me and Weezy fucking, baby?
Cause I don’t waste time, can’t you see a nigga lazy
And I might need some help
But, you know, Weezy’s fucking crazy

It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely 50 don't back down
Everywhere I go both coasts with toast
Eastside, Westside, I hold that mac down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see an O.G
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down

[Verse 1]
Any living thing that cannot co-exist with the kid
Must cease existing, little nigga, now listen
Your mami, your papi, that bitch you chasin'
Your little dirty ass kids, I'll fucking erase 'em
Your success is not enough, you wanna be hard
Knowing that you get knocked you get fucked in the yard
You's a Pop Tart, sweetheart, you soft in the middle
I eat ya for breakfast, the watch was an exchange for your necklace
And your boss is a bitch, if he could he would
Sell his soul for cheap, trade his life to be Suge
You can buy cars, but you can't buy respect in the hood
Maybe I'm so disrespectful cause to me you're a mystery
I know niggas from ya hood, you have no history
Never poked nothing, never popped nothing, nigga stop fronting
Jay put you on, X made you hot
Now you run around like you some big shot

All the other hard niggas they come from Yonkers
It's been years and you had the same niggas in the background
You never gonna sell Mitsubishi Tah, Crack Child
Them niggas dead, they just suck, they no good
I ain't never heard a nigga say they like them in the hood
I'm back better than ever on top of my game
Even them country boys saying ""50 we feeling you, mane""
Now you stay the fuck outta my zone, outta my throne
I'm New York City's own bad guy

And y'all know big thangs come in small packages, holla
Now everythang was cool until 50 Cent came back into the picture
They better not put they hands on Jeffrey
Okay, just first of all, they do not know that I am a 12 degree pink belt
Okay, I will dice his ass up like a little piece of celery

And I will Jet Li his ass, hitaaaah!"

Killer,Nipsey Hussle,"['pop', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Drake]
Look
I let the beat bang I don't claim colors
Honestly, the honesty is why the game love us
My women either centerfolds or on the main covers
Stunt so hard I make these niggas hate summer
And pray for winter but when it's winter time
I'm still waitin' on these niggas at the finish line
We just took our first trip to the Amalfi coast
Couple days on the beach then it's adios (Killa)
Just look at what I done alone
You will swear we planted trees the way the money's grown
We been busy like some bees no honeycomb
And you could prolly feel the breeze when the money's blown
Pardon my towel and flip flop phase
I'll never be the reason that a bitch got paid
Even when I'm not functioning in tip-top shape
I could bench as much as hip hop weighs
Drizzy

[Chorus: Drake]
Uh
I'm tryna bring it home
Even if I gotta do it on my own
I'm a muhfuckin' killa, killa, killa, killa
Uh
And I'm the one to blame
Now that I'm around shit will never be the same
I'm a killa, killa, killa, killa, nigga
[Verse 2: Nipsey Hu$$le]
Listen, look
Before rap my last name was my lifestyle
And when I visualize success it look like right now
What was once gray skies is now white clouds
And I did it with the ones that y'all said was not the right crowd
Follow my steps and you'll see what I'm 'bout
I keep my money coming in and never going out
From Chuck Taylors on the pavement with the blamma's out
Then I hit the league straight out the streets with no talent scout
And now my face bring the cameras out
That young nigga these industry bitches yap about
You know the one the cops bump you up and ask about
All because I took my wildest dreams and then mapped 'em out
I go for mine like it's overtime
Me and my niggas had to struggle so we over shined
Been fucked bitches I been on my grind
'Cause on a mission, your worst enemy is idle time
Hussle

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm tryna bring it home
Even if I gotta do it on my own
I'm a muhfuckin' killa, killa, killa, killa

Song for the Ville,J. Cole,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Aye baby tell me have you ever seen a nigga chasin' dreams
Leavin' everything he love behind to make this cream
Kisses his momma on the cheek, say, don't worry I'll be back
I gotta get you out this shit, I'm a hurry, I'll speed back
You see, that's the type of shit the boy be thinkin' when he dreamin'
And he don't pay no mind to them niggas that's disagreein'
Sayin', nigga, is you crazy
Them same ones that's talkin' be the same ones not doin' shit
Aye, nigga is you lazy
Or is you scared to follow dreams
I know you gotta have one
The opportunities be in yo' face
You gotta grab one nigga
But while you're bullshittin'
I'll be woodgrippin' gettin' wealthy
On the road to riches, God help me
I'll holla at ya'll niggas when I see you, wouldn't wanna be you
Cause you fear what I don't, see this here is what I want
So I'm a get it poppin', I'm rockin' despite the obstacles
Look, my nigga what you call impossible is possible
[Refrain]
Aye, tell my niggas to keep they heads up
We made it too damn far just to give it up
And we way too strong
This is a song for the Ville
Yeah, yeah
And baby don't cry, you know I'm comin' back
I did it for the city, gotta get up on the map
And I know we gon' shine
This is a song for the Ville, yeah

[Verse 2]
I thank the Lord for my many blessings
Though I'm stressin', I know it's temporary
Starin' at my granny obituary
She almost made it to eighty before they buried
Damn, can't even tell you I'm sure I'll to make it to 30
Cause you never know, sometimes life takes a turn for the worst
Is you holdin' on to will, or did you let it go
Heaven knows I'm tryna hold on
So every night I pray and hope my life is prolonged
The journey seemed so long but hold up
Don't take me up
I got big dreams nigga, ya'll can't wake me up
Life's a bitch but death don't break me up, I got too much to live for
It seems too many niggas die with way too much potential
Gotta get up out this trap even if I got to scrap
I'll lay a nigga down flat before I'll let him hold me back
Ya see I ain't afraid of obstacles
But what you niggas call impossible is possible
Yeah, so aye
[Refrain]

Aye, some niggas take they life for granted, wastin' time
Time is money my nigga, I cannot waste a dime
Or a minute, too much business to handle to be sleepin'
Too much spinach to eat for niggas beefin'
So I'm out here trick or treatin', can my niggas comprehend
Bill Gates, Donald Trump, motherfucker let me in
Stop hatin' that's a sin, why these niggas so sinful
I guess they hate to love a nigga, yes it's that simple
As I ride through the city, feelin' lucky to be breathin'
I know a couple peers that didn't make it to the season, pour it out
See I believe that things happen for a reason, no doubt
Strange times, as I watch these niggas throw they gang signs, and they strapped
Crips or Blood, nigga we all black
From the same city, the same schools we was taught at
Aye fuck the drawbacks and obstacles
Man what them teachers call impossible is possible nigga, yeah

And from the ground, I built my own damn buzz
People was amazed I was still in high school
But now I'm out, and money what I'm 'bout
Tryna get so much that I can't keep count
New kicks give me cushion like whoopie
Keep a smile like an Eat'n Park cookie
Everything good, I'm white boy awesome

Smellin' it when the L is lit, I'm flyer than a pelican
Young fresh, but I'm so damn intelligent
Girls givin' brains 'cause I'm acting like a gentleman

I got niggas that'll assassinate you, B, lyrically
Really shut you the fuck down, don't get your career ended
Leave us the fuck alone, let us rock
We are RocHeusen, we're the R-O-C (I'm here Dame, I'm here), holla (Killa)

[Verse 4: Cam'Ron]
This is just fate, how I would sit on a crate
Listen to tapes, every day a frisk was at stake
Jakes' cuffs, wrists getting raped, my mission was straight, to
Visit them states near them great Michigan lakes
And fuck a bathroom, I pissed on the gate
Flipped the bird at em, flip a bird, switch up my plates
I got plans that was better than jail
Now look, we like Bird, Parish, Kevin McHale
Scott, Worthy, Jabbar and Magic, oh my God, it's magic
Isaiah, Dumars, I will carve your casket
Phil, Scottie and Mike, Phil, Shaq and Kobe
My gats will detach you, homie
And I'm friends with thugs, I sell endless drugs
For the Roc Fam, dawg, I extend my love
Jay, Bleek, beef, I'll be crossing the bridge
Tossing they wigs, make corpse of they kids
Free, O, Sparks, and Mack Mittens
I'm 95 South, no doubt, MAC clip in
I stack chips and I'm Saks Fifth-in'
Louis Vuitton loafers, hat dripping
I go retrieve a duck, tell her proceed and suck
I don't just beat my cases, I beat 'em up
My lawyer eat 'em up, put bars behind me
I'm glad they didn't stop that car behind me, shit
It had three felons, gun shooters, no
50 cal. A.C.P., Bazooka Joe
Don't be stupid, though, I get scrilla, man
I'm for realer, man, yeah, it's Killa Cam, uh, Dipset, bitch

We are the champions, my friend
And we'll keep on fighting to the end
We are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers 'cause we are the champions

What, y'all thought I was finished?
I'm not, I just recruited somebody new
I'm like the George Steinbrenner of this shit
I mean I'm rich like him, holla

[Verse 5: Twista]
Everybody's swarming, oh my God
It's the newest power forward of the squad
A legacy like Jordan with the mob
That be known for breaking motherfuckers off
Put Roc-A-Fella on my pinky ring
Fuck a battle, nigga, I'ma get them thangs
Rollin' with them Lords and them folks up out the Chi
Twista gon' make 'em spit the game
I represent the mob to the fullest
You don't want it with that boy that's known to pull it
With Kanye on the track of the Dream Team
I'm finna be the shit no matter which way you put it
They blessed a nigga in, now I'm fin' to go into a zone
Taking it to some motherfuckers domes
'Cause it's on, I will rock until I'm gone
Filling my body with lead, clutching chrome
Take it to your gut, take it to your chest
I be more provoking when I'm smoking sess
And we getting stronger, hope you got a vest
Already got them MACs, already got them TECs
Served a few dimes, Beans got pearl
Legendary, we on top of the world
How could you haters think we can be done?
Hold it down because we are champions

[Chorus: DJ Clue]
We are the champions, my friend
And we'll keep on fighting to the end
We are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers 'cause we are the champions (Yeah)

I scoop your little birdie on some Bobby Womack shit
The best you ever heard, fuck that, you know that shit
Perpendicular to most, with the flow that's sick
Lookin' sporty in the 740 (aight) put the G on the shorty
Even if I'm tore down from a 40
No advertisement or chastisement
The ice on my neck make the honeys' eyes squint
Every, chance I get, from the stance I pick
Flick your ass on the floor like a cancer stick
No more, jokes and games, I hope to claim
I want, boats and planes, ice ropes and chains
When it, pours it rains, so I'm weatherin' the storm
Been away for three joints and still better than the norm
Yo I'm deep rooted, for this here, I be zooted
I do it to you all night girl, when I be booted
Find out, have you screamin' time out
Your big lover man chillin' with the shine out
Girl I blow your mind out, we can wine and dine out
Reclined on my system, Alpined out..

Tryin' to build a monopoly, Franklins on top of me
I go to the Roof, if 97 start rockin' me
No stoppin' me, on the verge to blow

From the true and living, bona fide top contender
Not a pretender, I live my life in splendor

Managers calling I'm still yawning
Get up wake up hair and make-ups
Waiting for you don't be stalling
This performance is important
I don't think I can put my all in
Hold on I was drunk last night
Now it's all kicking in and I don't feel right
Gave my number to a breh who wasn't my type
Now my phone's on silent I'm being polite
Now private callers get no love from me
Just let me be

Oh my gosh my days are getting longer
There's no turning back cause I'm working the 9 to 5

So make sure you heard me

I can't handle this
I'm getting pissed like pampers throwing a tantrum

Nah I'd actually rather catch my z's and count sheep in my sleep
Let's not wake her up she actually looks quite sweet

Thats right—I got problems and personal issues
Stories that'll make ya eyes tear and wet tissue
It's true, I'm Madd like the rapper
I'm so upset I gotta put it up in my rap before I snapper
After the things I've seen from Atlanta to Queens
To the mean streets of Brooklyn when I was a teen
Back and forth to the Islands, scream when I left
But adapted, and still my dreams haven't left
I only hung with the crack kids we not the best
Me and the roughest ruffnecks went chest to chest
Now my best friend's locked up north I won't rest
'Till I let him live his dream through me and I confess
That even though both our hearts was dark his was darker
Best believe when shit got spark he was the sparker
And when the block got hot he was the fire starter
And if I had beef my nigga Raja was a martyr

I wonder how certain people come in my life
I wonder why'd I get in so many fights
I wonder why sometimes things just don't go right
Why I gotta live this life hey hey
I wonder how certain people come in my life
I wonder why'd I get in so many fights
I wonder...why I gotta live this life hey hey
[Verse 2]
Yo, you one of the most important people in my life
They called you Dice but I called you cousin
We was buggin' cause I figured that we both had something in common
You loved to chat reggae music and I loved rhymin'
But still they ain't call you Dice for nothin'
I seen you shoot with the williest cats and leave them with nothing
Somethin' must have pleased that bluffer in you
To make you wanna take dough from those tougher than you
Throughout school we made money together
When you was on the floor shootin', I was the side better
And yo we cleaned out them cats and took the scraps
But you wasn't a ruff cat and cats knew that
I knew eventually them thugs would try to hurt you
If I was there, I'd never let nobody hurt you, it's hurtful
I knew they wouldn't let you take the money and run
That's why I shoulda came when you told me to come

I wonder how certain people come in my life
I wonder why'd I get in so many fights

I wonder...why I gotta live this life hey hey

Yo, it was June sixth 96 Graduation night
Made it through the school shish shootin' dice gettin' in fights
I even sparked a riot, til the school got quiet
And dismiss just got tired of usin' my fists
We had some shit like knife pipes bottles and sticks
Can't forget them 380's, Nine's and 22's
Best believe, many dudes was paid in my crew
We made a name for ourselves boy I've seen some drama
Seems my momma never dreamed she'd go threw so much trauma comma, pause you
Ask about cops and laws
Well that shit don't exist when you black and poor
So we broke em, but at that night my heart got broken
Chokin' on the weed smoke, drinkin' rum and gettin' open
Not to mention, never a big drinker I'm a thinker
But I'm thinkin' hey this my night, pass me more liquor
Fight breaks out, I'm just too nice to get in it
But my brother got stabbed and I missed it
Word up, it's crazy

Check the plan: I’ma bubble them jumbs, then I abolish ‘em
Been doing it since double-0-1’s with five dollars
Pinstripe knees and D’s in the side pockets
Keep it shining in Siegfried shirt with wide collars
See all these shots and bam-bam fed on Channel 5, I was
Scrambling, making sure them heads was satisfied with it
The meter inside the cut was just right, fresher
Than southern dubs, enough to buff pipes while I
Tell married chicks to suck mics and strips for the bills
And get ‘em addicted, prove all their skills
Straight pimping, mac daddy, ain’t nothing wrong with hustling
When the time calls for it, I’m puffing chron and busting, then I
Do shit to chicks some youngins call disgusting
Fuck ‘em in their butt then have ‘em suck off my nut then
Give ‘em all they need to keep turning out tricks
Put ‘em on the strip at nine, have ‘em return about six, then, uh
Then press the ho, pull a burner out quick
Get moved on the low ‘cause rumors spread through word of mouth quick, and
Pimp hoes, pimp ‘em, lick slugs, lick ‘em

Listen close: ain’t no doubt in the game
If a heater broke, they’re cutting a whole mountain of ‘caine
We still bagged up twenty-five percent, so they’re chopped up
Or they drop slow ‘til they fly up
Open shop, buffed rims spread fast like bad rashes
Fall back with the gods, and they be badasses
As they come back, it’s pouring mad acid rain
Smoke an L, straight blow from them cells
Stash up, keep that dough for my bail
Plus a four-four with shells in case shit go to Hell
Reup on the hundreds of cash with two jammies
Plus the broad’ll transport the crack in her poonanies
Can’t pick the clique of a cat that’s too candy
Ride-or-die fam, those who wilds is my mans too
Tell it how it is: thug-wild styles plus kids
Money’s smart—don’t talk—just be chill, how these kids be
Down for the game since Gazelles and suede Pumas
Have them broads stashing the cash in the bra and the bloomers
Cock-blocking your spot with fakes, rocks, and ass-pimping

Mince Meat,DANGERDOOM,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
The Villain ain't rhymin off bread alone
Let him get some cognac, a mic and a headphone
Smoke and mirrors, caught her in the mix
Couldn't read the shorthand for mortars and bricks
If any negative thought linger,  he let it vent
Wrote this one with his middle finger in wet cement
Did it on the sly
Before he's gone bye bye, spit it on the fly
Brush your teeth, rinse and gargle
A true nerd who messed with new words since Boggle
And used slang in Scrabble
Rhymed with a Northern drawl, twang and babble
Flossy pen jargon to break the world record
Do a Faustian bargain and tape the girl naked
More spots than a leopard
Then he had to stop, the block was hot peppered
Shepherd, leading the sheeps out to slaughter
Kept it, sold and repped it, everytime he saw ya
Tryin' to douse a pinch of weed in a frat street house
[Hook: Klondike Kat & MF DOOM]
I'll make mince meat out of that (beat) mouse!

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
Welcome to the show
Remember whatever you do, do not boo the flow
Schooled the dumb on the number one rule of thumb
What a fool; still you never met a cooler bum
Give the drummer some rum, I'm sure he could use a shot
Just to get his cues hot, ensure he don't lose his spot
A stranger who speaks to you vocal
Danger made the beat, get a freak to do the bogle
No bull, everything he wanted they grabbed and took
Whole lab looked like an ill left jab and hook
Even had a secretary to take the calls
Shake it and make it fall, I told her don't break my balls
Wherever Mouse go, trouble follows
The bounty on this pro was mills and double dollars
Vil spilled muddled flows that befuddled scholars
Thick Buffalo girl with the bubble hollars
She rocked leather and gold, a fat blouse
And need a brother with soul to let her cat out
Even if the rat couldn't compete with Kraus

[Hook: Klondike Kat & MF DOOM]
I'll make mince meat out of that (beat) mouse!
[Verse 3: MF DOOM]
Tap ya toe, grime and strapped for dough
Rap for show, to let the whippersnappers know
Sucks to be them, now pass that loot
Up under the tux, he wore a hazmat suit
Sounded like froggy, sip the groggiest of potions
Be up in the party with the foggiest of notions
On the list of lobbyists who save the oceans
Gave his donation to the lady with the lotions
Swoll hand itchin', the old man bitchin'
Switchin' with the fan with the gold band twitchin'
Spittin' like a bionic sneeze that freeze vodka
Just to clear the air like the Ionic Breeze Quadra
Sleek enough to outsly a fox
For a chicken pot pie, thinkin outside the box
Would love to taste her goody
But got no time to be wastin chasin putty
Out for Daffy Duck bucks, Porky Pig paper
Bugs Bunny money or Sylvester Cat caper
Off a DAT tape of rap, country or deep house

Measles are contagious like my lyrical pages
Ripping and flipping the mic
From back in the back in the days, these days it's kinda hectic, hectic
When these suckers don't respect it, check it
Flame on, I know the light is bright but keep on watching me
I'm stolen property, kicking the flavor to society
Police be clocking me, but logically they got to be
Cause they were taught that serious poetry would come from Socrates
But that ain't it, in 94 I'll kick the hit
If I was in front of Shakespeare, I'd battle the punk and take his shit
I'm not having it
Bust the narrative I come to give, listen
Rap is something you do, Hip Hop is something you live
The difference is kids nowadays, they got the video
Rappers don't need skills to build so they don't really know
Hear me yo, I'm four times on Arsenio
Got ten videos, but does that help me flow? No
That's why when I come to the show MC's act like they don't know
Cause they were too young to rock up in the disco
Frisco Disco, the disc is like a Nabisco
Chocolate chip cookie, don't fuck with me rookie
I'm rocking beats and with death defying feats
And I'm never squeaking, I'm always freaking when I'm speaking
Inside I'm keeping a statement for police and
I'm down for peace and but not turn the other cheek and
So this DJ, he gets down
Mixing records while they go...
Round and round, round we go

And Flash is gonna rock your mind
Welcome to the terror dome, the terror dome
I wonder if I take you home

But back in the days I knew rap would never die
Too late baby bye bye in a batty boy head, head, head
Insane in the membrane
Take the train, take the train
M-E-T-H-O-D man...
...Hattan keeps on making it, Brooklyn keeps on taking it
We keep coming back with more and more hits
Party people
I came through the door, I said it before
Two years ago, super ho
If my train goes off the track
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up back, back
Back to the grill again, the grill again

How many MC's must get dissed?
Before somebody says don't fuck with Kris

Now get rich niggas, fuck it

Some rap pioneers be them crackheads
When they speak, you see missin' teeth
Silver chain with a silver piece
Niggas your grandfather's age, they pants still hangin' down they legs, talkin' about they ain't paid
And they hate you, ‘cause they say you ain't pay dues
And [Sylvia Robinson was stealin' and robbin' them]
I feel it's a problem we gotta resolve
Hip-Hop been dead, we the reason it died
Wasn't Sylvia's fault or because MC's skills are lost
It's because we can't see ourselves as the boss
Deep-rooted through slavery, self-hatred
The Jewish stick together, friends in high places
We on some low level shit, we don't want niggas to ever win
See, everybody got a label
Everybody's a rapper, but few flow fatal
It's fucked up, it all started from two turntables

With their fingers intertwined in some gang-sign madness

Let's see who can quote a Daddy Kane line the fastest
Some of you new rappers, I don't understand your code
You have your man shoot you, like in that Sopranos episode
Do anything to get in the game, mixtapes
You spit hate against bosses; hungry fucks are moralless
You should be tossed in a pit full of unfortunate vocalists
Niggas, I could've wrote your shit
I had off-time, was bored with this
I could've made my double-LP
Just by samplin' different parts of Nautilus
Still came five on the charts with zero audience
The lane was open and y'all was droppin' that garbage shit
Y'all got awards for your bricks – it got good to ya
You started tellin' them bigger dogs to call it quits?! WHAT?

Now niggas got the studio poppin', it's mad clearer
Engineers got his earplugs and still hear us
The live-in-the-park sound versus the studio state of art sound. We on the charts now
From British Walkers and Argyles
Look at us rap stars now, with our black cars now
Fortune 500 listed, brunches, Cipriani's
Sippin', blunted, with rich white guys around me
Thick white girls around me, Chinese lined up
Because I'm what? Every dime lust
We used to be a ghetto secret; can't make my mind up
If I want that or the whole world to peep it
Now carry on tradition
Fuck a bum wack rapper makin' his career out of dissin'
Peace to the strugglin' artists and dead one's gone, we miss 'em, I promise I carry on tradition

Oh, oh, oh
Something beautiful happens in this world
Akon
You don't know how to express yourself, so
And Lonely Island, yeah
You just gotta sing

I just had sex, and it felt so good (Felt so good)
A woman let me put my penis inside of her
I just had sex, and I'll never go back (Never go back)
To the not-having-sex ways of the past

[Verse 1: Andy & Jorma]
Have you ever had sex? I have, it felt great
It felt so good when I did it with my penis
A girl let me do it, it literally just happened
Having sex can make a nice man out the meanest
Never guess where I just came from, I had sex
If I had to describe the feeling, it was the best
When I had the sex, man, my penis felt great
And I called my parents right after I was done
Oh, hey, didn't see you there, guess what I just did?
Had sex, undressed, saw her boobies and the rest
Was sure nice of her to let you do that thing
Nice of any girl ever! Now, sing
[Chorus: Akon]
I just had sex, and it felt so good (Felt so good)
A woman let me put my penis inside of her
I wanna tell the world

[Verse 2: Andy & Jorma]
To be honest, I'm surprised she even wanted me to do it
Doesn't really make sense! But, man, screw it
I ain't one to argue with a good thing! She could be my wife
That good? The best thirty seconds of my life
I'm so humbled by a girl's ability to let me do her
'Cause honestly, I'd have sex with a pile of manure
With that in mind, a soft, nice-smelling girl's better
Plus, she let me wear my chain and my turtleneck sweater

[Bridge: Akon]
So this one's dedicated to them girls
That let us flop around on top of them, yeah
Whether you're near or far, whether short or tall, yeah
We wanna thank you all for letting us fuck you

[Interlude: Andy, Jorma, & Akon]
She kept looking at her watch
Doesn't matter, had sex
But I cried the whole time
Doesn't matter, had sex
I think she might've been a racist
Doesn't matter, had sex
She put a bag on my head
Still counts!
[Bridge: Akon]
I just had sex, and my dreams came true (Dreams came true)
So if you've had sex in the last thirty minutes
Then you qualified to sing with me

[Chorus: Akon]
I just had sex, and it felt so good (Felt so good)
A woman let me put my penis inside of her
I just had sex, and I'll never go back (Never go back)

[Slug]
So why you wanna punch these other rappers in their face?
[Murs]
Cause they fake as fuck, and a waste of space
Besides, fist not guns, that's a change of pace

[Slug]
So who are you to judge who's true these days?

[Murs]
I been around the block, got a few dues paid
One of the few rappers left that'll do what I say

[Slug]
So is it Def Jux or the Living Legends that you're reppin'?

[Murs]
Man, I'm all about good music, people and progression
I got friends in different sections but the West is where I'm restin

[Slug]
Do you really think race is the reason you ain't sellin'?

[Murs]
What, you trying to piss me off and put a end to this session?
Man, you've heard This Is For - c'mon, next question

[Slug]
Aight, what was it like working with Humpty Hump?
[Murs]
One hell of a artist, but a fucking drunk
Though he did get the video cracking, I won't front

[Slug]
You had a bunch of porn stars there, anything jump?

[Murs]
Yeah, up into my lap for some head just once
And I could've got some pussy, but I was too fucked up

[Slug]
Hahaha, after the first ""Felt"", did you meet Christina?

[Murs]
No, she never said thanks, my black ass never seen her
That's why I moved on to my Nubian queen, heh

[Slug]
So what's the definition of the ""3:16"", huh?

[Murs]
It's my birthday, fool: 3-16
Plus the formula for the every rap song that you sing

[Murs]
Hey Slug, why you only make songs about women?
[Slug]
Priorities, man. Nah, I'm kiddin'
I'm trying to build heaven while the world's still spinnin'

[Murs]
How big did you guess it would get in the beginning?

[Slug]
This is still the beginning, still unraveling ribbon
The mission is to travel for as far as the vision

[Murs]
Well how long so you think this success will last?

[Slug]
Man, for all I know, that shit already passed!
It's impossible to answer that question asked

[Murs]
Then why Rhymesayers make a deal with Epitaph?

[Slug]
We didn't, you dumbass! Go read the math
Me and ANT did one record, for beats and laughs

[Murs]
Anyways Sean, whatever happened to Spawn?

[Slug]
Well things felt wrong, so we both had to move on
No love gone, every day holds a new dawn

[Murs]
Business and friendship: where's the line drawn?

[Slug]
Family and friends may get past the front lawn
Business is done by the end of the last song

[Murs]
Is it the caffeine, the nicotine, the milligrams, the tar?

[Slug]
No: it's Selena, it's Christina, it's Serena in my car
It's a thick line between being a genius and a star

[Murs]
Are you rapping, acting, or kittin the guitar?

[Slug]
Man, fuck that shit! I'm just sittin at the bar
Writing these hits about self-inflicted scars

[Murs]
Are you in love with this game, completely and truly?

[Slug]
From the music to the voice to the stage to the groupies
I'm the same as I was back when nobody knew me

[Murs]
Alright, who is Lucy?

[Slug]
She's the extra that gets to play the devil in my movie
She's around Uptown sipping a beer smoothie

[both burst out laughing]

YEAAAAH, HAHHHHH-HAHAHA
(We did it again!) WE DID IT AGAIN!
(TAKE THAT! Hahaha, another album!
Hahaha, THE JOKE'S ON YOU, JACK!!

Head, pressure, senses, clutch
Date, divinity, wouldn't, fuck
Touched, hazy, God, change
Rush, floor, life, veins
Head, pressure, senses, clutched
Date, divinity, wouldn't, fuck
Touched, hazy, God, change
Rush, floor, life

[Chorus]
From a head full of pressure wrest the senses that I clutch
Made a date with divinity, but she wouldn't let me fuck
I got touched by a hazy shade of God-help-me-change
Caught a rush on the floor from the life in my veins
From a head full of pressure wrest the senses that I clutch
Made a date with divinity, but she wouldn't let me fuck
I got touched by a hazy shade of God-help-me-change
Caught a rush on the floor from the life in my veins

[Verse 1]
It goes one for the cannabis, and two for your Dianetics
Three for the reasoning, and four for those that try to get it
Five for your love and six for the stress
And seven for the day that I climbed into this mess
[Chorus]
From a head full of pressure wrest the senses that I clutch
I made a date with divinity, but she wouldn't let me fuck
And I got touched by a hazy shade of God-help-me-change
And caught a rush on the floor from the life in my veins

[Verse 2]
I'm catching ulcers from the child-proof lighters
And all of these fine-tooth biters that keep the wires in my head tighter
I'm tired out by the distances achieved walking in my sleep
Thoughts got shifted since the high got a tad too deep
Ask dad to keep cool, I'll call him back soon as I resume normal
And get out of this bathroom
And call management to seek some reimbursement
For the nerve endings that burnt from the first hits

[Chorus]
From a head full of pressure wrest the senses that I clutch
Made a date with divinity, but she wouldn't let me fuck
I got touched by a hazy shade of God-help-me-change
Caught a rush on the floor from the life in my veins
Head full of pressure wrest the senses that I clutch
Made a date with divinity, but she wouldn't let me fuck
And I got touched by a hazy shade of God-help-me-change
Caught a rush on the floor from the life in my veins
[Verse 3]
So fuck needles, fuck smoke
Fuck lines that make the sinus choke
Fuck chasers, trails, fuck waves and rails
Fuck hangovers, fuck hallucinations
Regurgitations, mandatory sentences and UA tracing
Blind my insight and dull the common sense
Give me inhibition, kill the superstition and the confidence
Built a tolerance, now it's more that I consume
And when it boards up my room, the world's whores will croon in unison
Unify the eulogy
Autopsy pages read euthanasia, i.e. irony
Well, here I be within a pool of my drool
Sedated, windows dilated, comatose, life overdose
Tell Jacob Miles to keep it wild style
I promise I'll smile
And check the floor, God's got nice tile
Tell Jacob Miles to keep that shit wild style
And I'll smile
And check the floor, God's got nice tile

[Chorus]
From a head full of pressure wrest the senses that I clutch
Made a date with divinity, but she wouldn't let me fuck
And I got touched by a hazy shade of God-help-me-change
Caught a rush on the floor from the life in my veins
From a head full of pressure wrest the senses that I clutch
I made a date with divinity, but she wouldn't let me fuck
And I got touched by a hazy shade of God-help-me-change

Shit Hits the Fan,Obie Trice,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Yeah
Yo, let's bring it

[Hook: Eminem]
What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
Will you be as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?
I said, what you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
And show us you're as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Niggas is so gangsta, niggas is thugs
Niggas'll spend they whole life peddling drugs
Slangin' dope in hopes of one day being able
To own their own label and give the game up
Some niggas came up, some just didn't
That's just the way it is; if it ain't meant it, it just isn't
Some niggas'll get money and pay niggas to back 'em
So they can act up, feel comfortable, and rap tough
And that's ass-backwards
'Cause them niggas just gon' keep comin' back
And that's when extortion happens
And you struggle to get free, I know how this shit be
You'd give anything to live legitimately
But you gone find if you do get in this industry
It's best to do business with me than against me
Niggas get behind mics and ain't even emcees
Niggas get on MTV just to diss me
This shit don't even piss me off
I'm laughing all the way to the bank
Watching the satellite from a Bentley
And you niggas ain't even got a car
You're so far under my radar
I don't even know who the fuck you are
To tell you to suck my dick while I'm pissin'
I don't even listen to your shit to know who the fuck I'm dissin'
And media just feeds into these feuds
Tryna add fuel to the fire, this lil' nigga Ja Rule
Talking bout he's gon' slap me? Nigga, please!
You gotta jump and swing up to hit me in the knees
I laugh at these magazines when they interview him
All they doing is making fake threats to us through them
And, pussy, you not Pac; I knew him
Pac was a real nigga, you just a fucking insult to him
It's too bad we had to fall out before he passed
'Cause if he could see this shit now, he'd be whoopin' your ass
You're talkin' to a pioneer who engineered this shit for 19 years
Who you got in ya ear? (Pshhhhh!)
I ain't even gotta say it, the fans know
Quit tryna be tough, nigga, you look like an asshole
[Hook: Eminem]
What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
Will you be as hard as you say you are?

And show us you're as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
They say, ""Why don't we increase the peace?""
The only piece increased is that which deletes your peeps
'Cause niggas run mouths but they don't run streets
Till that fo'-five will cease your speech
Yeah, it's a shame how the beef'll creep
Could've reached ya peak, now you're left with a horrible leak
I'm tryin' to be as bleak with my speech as possible
Just in case a nigga tryin' to throw me an obstacle
Nigga, I'm not boxin' you, I'm hospitable
I put you in a hospital, that's how I get at you
Let the Doc op- on you, he don't rid you?
You back on the streets, I send another hit at you
This is not a hypocritical issue
I will critical condition your tissue, give a fuck
If all ten of them with you, I throw an extra ten of them missiles
Turn gangstas into gentlemen, vicko
And ever since Eminem dissed you
I swear I see the woman and bitch in you
All this bickerin' back and forth over who signs who
Curtis pulled your skirt up, nigga, you got murdered
Now take it like a man and shake it off, damn!
And quit tellin' all these magazines your plans
How you gon' slap up my mans? You're fict-ious
Nigga, we'll send Stan to come murder your bitches
[Hook: Eminem]
What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
Will you be as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?
I said, what you gonna do when shit hits the fan?

[Outro: Obie Trice]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Yeah
Go hide behind all the gangstas you want, nigga
Matter of fact
Go get every gangsta from every hood
In the United States of America to back you, nigga
Ain't nobody ridin' wit you
You can't see that?
You fell off, nigga

9-5ers Anthem,Aesop Rock,"['rock', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Zoom in to the fuming of an aggravated breed
Via the study of post-adolescent agitated seeds
Half the patients wasted self prior to Commencement
So I focus on the urban Oxygen samples, the half that made it breathe
They sold Pompeii impression, waste infections
And twelve steps to lesson
Cretins swiftly tippy toe on hard to swallow, barter concepts
The give-it get-it, never let it self passport our stubbornness
Martyrs talks money causes in a harvesting Spartacus
And so on I've thrown long Hail Mary bombs
Toward cookie-cutter Mother Natures bedazzled synthetic fabrics
Life treats the peasants like
They tried to fuck his woman while he slept inside
Well they're merely chasing perfectionist emblems
When the clock strikes nine
I'll be waking with the best of routine caffeine team players
For the cycle of it
Under a dusted angel harp string Big Brother is watching
My odometer like buzzard to fallen elk, talking stealth
We got babies, rubber stamps, and briefcase parts
We on some door-to-door now
Order ten dollars or more, we'll shove it down your throat for free
I'll sacrifice my inborn tendencies
For copper pennies for one commanding ""Gimme that""
So we can retain baby fat
Make the biter snake bedlam
Holocaust freak, heckle shiesty brain headroom shaped planet
Make a move, pause, make a move break cannon
Bent barrel one eight zero, U-Turn, squeeze, end it
It's on like it's never been
It's bleeding well
It's bigger than a breadbox
It corrodes my leaky finance
I'll take my seat atop the Brooklyn Bridge
With a Coke and a bag of chips
To watch a thousand lemmings plummet just because
The first one slipped
Sometimes I laugh at victory, kissing these little question marks
I tend to underestimate my average
Just another bastard savage
Someday you'll all eat out of my cold hand
Cuz every dog has its day
At which point, I'll pull it away
[Hook]
Now we the American working population
Hate the fact that eight hours a day
Is wasted on chasing the dream of someone that isn't us
And we may not hate our jobs
But we hate jobs in general
That don't have to do with fighting our own causes
We the American working population
Hate the nine-to-five day-in day-out
When we'd rather be supporting ourselves
By being paid to perfect the pastimes
That we have harbored based solely on the fact
That it makes us smile if it sounds dope

[Verse 2]
It's the year of the silkworm
Everything I built burned yesterday
Let's display the purpose that these stilts serve
Elevate the spreading of the silk germ
Trying to weave a web but all that I believe in is dead
Nah brother, it's the year of the jackal
Saddle up on high horse
My torch forced Polaris embarrassed
Shackle up the hassle by the dooming legend marriage
I bought some new sneakers
I just hope my legacy matches
It's the year of the landshark
Dry as sand, parched, damn get these men some water
They're out there being slaughtered
In meaningless wars so you don't have to bother
And can sit and soak the idiotbox trying to fuck their daughters
Man it's the year of the Orphan
Seated adjacent to the firefly circling the torches on your porches
Trying to guard the fortress of a king they've never seen or met
But all are trained to murder at the first sign of a threat
Maybe it's the year of the waterbug
Cockroach utter thug specimen
Fury spawned from dreaming of your next of kin
I'm still dealing with this mess I'm in
I've been the object of your ridicule
You've been a bitch lieutenant
God, it's the year of the underpaid employee
Spittin' forty plus a week
And tryin' to rape Earth on my off time
You bored dizzy, I can't keep myself busy enough
So you can run run run
And I'mma let you think you won
EVERYBODY!

Conflict/Resolution. That's damn sure not a specialty
I wanna thank everyone for listening to the album they just listened to
Please don't take out your life though. It's kinda sad

[Verse One]
I'm from the meth lab city of broken dreams
And cracked out dopamines
Where everybody's looking for an ocean scene
Where 'Pac and Biggie are passe cause back home
We speak in terms of Mac Dre and Fat Tone
I'm from a city where there's actually people
That are bothered by the thought of homosexual marriage
The Bible Belt, friendly smiles, and Christian steeples
And names like Bobby Sue Williams and Belinda Peoples
This town is so eerie when it snows
All the trees look like ghosts appearing from the road
The crows flew south of heaven and found the elixir
The echo of silence whispers from the mouth of the river
To say... yeah the city could be great one day
But the first step is getting out of our own way
I've been to bigger cities, they produce bigger frowns
I'll die, right here, in this town
[Hook]
And I know
There's something beautiful within my grasp
And I know
I think I'm satisfied but it won't last
And I know
To lace my boots up and pick my path
I'll find another rainstorm to fill my glass

[Verse Two]
So quote my life as written by anonymous, fuck it
I think I'll keep the liquid courage and the broken promises
So if you're coming over bring a bottle and a cup
There's a war going on outside (and I don't give a fuck)
I could never win the fight for me
I could only minimize the details of my life story
I was born, late July, 1981
Skip a bunch of bullshit until now and then the story's done
But I'mma write the chapters later in my life
In a nursing home with a sweet lady for a wife
Both of us in wheelchairs we quietly hold hands
It's strange, but one day, I'm gonna be an old man
I hope to be happy on that day
Because I finally stood up and moved the hell out of my own way
I need to get the hell out of my own way (note to self)
And so do you

There's something beautiful within my grasp

Little Man,Atmosphere,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Slug]
Dear Jacob
I won't take up too much of you time
I know you're trying to get your video game-grind on
And that's fine
Just gimme a second to empty my face
Before I hit the road again to go and win this paper chase
I've been watching you and
I'm proud of you man
You're growing up to be the best man that you possibly can
I know you understand
Why I go out of town
I also know my days are colder when you're not around
Sometimes I wonder what it's like to be adapted to the fact
That daddy never lived inside the same shack
And sometimes I get this pain in my stomach's pit
It's what I get
I'm convinced it's my punishment
For those nights I got drunk and let go at some bar
In some city with some people I don't know
For all the times that the lines on your face
Reminded me of the days before the dragonflies escaped
It trips me out how you pick up all my traits
From the way that you spit to the fists that you make
I watch the way you try to keep your mom happy
Daddy learned that from you
You're supposed to learn that from daddy
I can't teach much when it comes to women
I drive safe and slow but don't know nothing 'bout the engine
You're doing good little man that's all I really meant
I love you
You're my best friend, thanks for listening
[Verse 2: Slug]
Dear Craig, what up bones? How it goes?
Yeah, me? Well, you know, you know, same old, same old
Sorry that the phone calls ain't too routine
Just been runnin' around the globe tryin' to do my thing
Sometimes the weeks fly a little too fast
And sometimes I go to sleep a little too trashed
Other times I'm not sittin' on enough cash
And other times today feels too much like the past
Sometimes at night I would watch y'all fight
A child wonderin'
Why your life just ain't alright?
What's the violence about? Why's it in my house?
And even the memories are turned up too loud
Yeah, I got some issues in my head
Knew we should've started fixing 'em back when she left you
I'm not trying to get you down, I know you're different now
But your little man just wants you to listen now
I'm over 30, can't maintain relations
All these women want to hurt me and I just don't have the patience
I can't trust them, and they're not much help
When they start to push and pull the buttons I don't trust myself
What pride, fists, and words just might do?
I'm afraid of my fate, don't wanna turn out like you
I've never hit a woman
I won't do coke
And for that alone I love you and I want to thank you, old man
[Verse 3: Slug]
Dear Sean, what's going on? Not much to say
Just checkin' in with you, trying to see what's wrong today
I know there's gotta be something kicking your bruises
How's the love? How's the music? How's the self-abusiveness?
Got a lot to lose, it's breaking your shoulders
So you let your paranoia place your bets for you
Too many cigarettes, messing up your voice
Too many arguments, trying to test your poise
The only women that love you are fans and family
Mom has no choice, but fans leave you randomly
No heavy rotation in any location
You're not ready to face that you have no steady vocation
Plus you're getting old, your raps are exhausted
Stop it, everybody knows that you've lost it
Singing for these kids you don't know
When you should be at home with your own instead you're on the telephone
Fighting with your girl like it's you against the world
Another drunk hotel bedroom corner, curled up like a naked fetus
Come and save him Jesus
Place him back in time before the Reaganomics and Adidas
Sometimes you're not impressed with the work you've done
And love isn't love if you didn't hurt someone
Your son says, ""Hi dad"", your dad says, ""What's up?""
And me, I wanna thank you, but I won't, I'll just say, ""Good luck."""
Shhh,Atmosphere,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
I wanted to make a song about where I'm from
You know
Big up my home town, my territory, my state
But I couldn't figure out much to brag about
Prince lives here, we got 10,000 lakes
But wait the women are beautiful, to me they are
And we're not infested with pretentious movie stars
And it hit me man, Minnesota is dope
If only simply for not what we have but what we don't
It's all fair, it ain't out there, it's in there
It's in the mirror, behind the breast under the hair
Follow the dream doesn't mean leave the love
Roam if you must, but come home when you've seen enough
I love New York and Cali, but I ain't moving
Too overpopulated, saturated with humans
And I'm not big on rappers, actors, or models
If I had to dip, I'd probably skip to Chicago
None of this is to diss no one, nowhere
Like damn, I'm from Minnesota, land of the cold air
Too many mosquitoes and our fair share of egos
But like my man Sabe says, that's where my mommy stays
[Refrain]
So if the people laugh and giggle when you tell them where you live
Say shhh, say shhh
And if you know this is where you want to raise your kids
Say shhh, say shhh
If you're from the Midwest and it doesn't matter where
Say shhh, say shhh
If you can drink tap water and breathe the air
Say shhh, say shhh

[Verse 2]
Got trees and vegetation in the city I stay
The rent's in the mail and I can always find a parking space
The women outnumber the men two to one
Got parks and zoos and things to do with my son
The nightlife ain't all that, but that's okay
I don't need to be distracted by the devil every day
And the jobs ain't really too hard to find
In fact, you could have mine if you knew how to rhyme
This is for everyone around the planet
That wishes they were from somewhere other than where they standing
Don't take it for granted, instead take a look around
Quit complaining and build something on that ground
Plant something on that ground, dance and sleep on that ground
Get on your hands and knees and watch the ants walk around
That ground Make a family, make magic, make a mess
Take the stress, feel your motivation and build your nest
It sucks that you think where I'm from is wack
But as long as that's enough to keep your ass from coming back
And with a smile and a hint of sarcasm, he said
I beg your pardon but this is my secret garden
[Briddge]
All right
In the land of ice and snow
Well okay
In the land of ice and snow
Well all right
In the land of ice and snow
Well okay
Minneapolis, Minneapolis, Minneapolis, Minneapolis

[Refrain]
If the playground is clear of stems and syringes
Say shhh, say shhh
If there's only one store in your town that sells 12-inches
Say shhh, say shhh
If no one in your crew walks around with a gun
Say shhh, say shhh
And if you ain't gonna leave cause this is where you're from
Say shhh, say shhh

Money Is My Bitch,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
{*Kissing*}
I love you so much, don't ever leave me, I won't let you leave

[Verse 1]
The hoe turned me out, green eyes, had a crush on her
Since 5 years old, met her, fell in love with her
I saved that hoe 'cause she bring more hoes
She major yo, the way she left them other dudes cold
Heartbroken, she walked right out of mad nigga's life
So when I bagged her up right, I had to make her my wife
And I ain't gonna lose her like those other lames did
I keep a stash safe kid, when I proposed it made her face big
She keep me jig, glorifying medallions
Got me in clothes made by Italians, feed me lobster and scallions
Watching her pile on my bed, her body feel stacked
She been around for years, know the hustlers, pimps, and macks
Bankers and diplomats
She the scratch on my back
Her cream I lust, now I got her I don't know how to act
When she not around, I'm heated, 'bout to lay something flat
Know how to treat it, never take for granted, she got me trapped
[Chorus]
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money, love her 'cause she keep a nigga rich
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money
Yeah yeah that bitch treat me like a trick
Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I can't be rich

[Verse 2]
All the fun we have together, I keep you in my pocket
It's so much of you I share you, and speak to you in private
You got me karats on my wrist
I'm a savage for your kiss
Embarrassed when I'm not with you, I'm off guard
Niggas always expect to see us two together, stable
The best couple they seen since Trump and Marla Maple
Don't need no pre-nup
'Cause when we hump we do it up
Make sure we both will bust a dollar sign nut
Before I got to know, my life I say was mediocre
Break of day, slinging all night long, fiending to stroke ya
Seeing niggas with you I wasn't happy
Wanted to stick them up to get you, heard you calling for daddy
And gladly I take you as my lawfully wedded wife
Never divorce me, I promise to treat you right
Keep you satisfied, never lie help you grow
My legal tender, lovely federal reserve note
[Chorus]
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money, love her 'cause she keep a nigga rich
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money
Yeah yeah that bitch treat me like a trick
Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I can't be rich

[Verse 3]
I won't sell my soul to you
What do I owe to you?
My cars, my house, my flow to you
Screw you, before you
Real niggas said I was cool, now I got you
The envy me cause I'm with you
You floss too much
Turn niggas out, one touch
For you, my guns bust
You always said in GOD we trust
It's hard enough to keep counting on you
You cheat with government thugs, got the IRS pounding on you
I think I liked you better when you were illegal
But you had to get professional, musical
Now when we fuck we use prophylactic, hard plastic
Stick you in ATM's, limited cash quick
Said you'd give me luxury, when I asked it
Fucking me, I gave you back shots in ya assets
Promised happiness, but really did nothing for me
I guess bitches like you just grow on trees
[Chorus]
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money, love her 'cause she keep a nigga rich
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money
Yeah yeah that bitch treat me like a trick
Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I can't be rich"

Nas is like the afrocentric asian
Right here with the amazing Green Lantern
Serious radio, y’all know what it is

NaS too real, NaS true king
You know the king

Cars with police radars on highways boppin
Bullpin therapy cell block dodging
Pissy stairways missed them days not when
They shut down the stores when I’m shopping
Used to be pop locking, train hopping
Face covered in stocking
Six pack Bud drinking gambler
Fuck them cameras in front of the man
Sing the hustlers mantra, hands of luck
More hits than gambling huff
I hollered Indosia, 40 belows covered the toes
I was a soldier with the Popeyes sippin Amota
Nigga honestly I call this a culture
My sister’s a snake, my brother’s a vulture
My mother’s the block, my father’s a ghetto piranha
Swimming with sharks my tones false settle drama
Obama, if the kids mirror you
We’ll all push Masaratis with the silver hue
They fear that connection
I rather die in a box than live safe in witness protection
Gotti was a racist but he still get praises
We don’t give a fuck, nigga gangsta is gangsta
Bricks come with Bill Clinton’s name on it taped up
Hollywood Lohan parties people they facing them
Kim Kardashian, body with the waist slim
Know some hood girls who did time that could take them
Rappers changing families, fags are all lost
I’m at the Waldorf, Vancleave under the sleeve
Save the small talk, I feel alive
New Porches Jordan number fives
Already said I’m the last real nigga alive

It's what you all been waiting for, ain't it?
Your weekly entertainment
For me to get a hold of this beat and go 'head, claim it
I'm about to paint a picture, you niggas go 'head, frame it
Since we getting Seinfeld on some Jerry and Elaine shit
I flow far from mediocre
And if we talking cards, I will fold him with the poker
You and your whole crew are like a deck of 54
So it's obvious y'all gon' steady be rolling with some jokers
And me, I'm rolling with some brokers
Like, damn, could you niggas get any broker?
I got my new girl so content
Just save yourself the embarrassment, don't even approach her
Disguise yourself, go buy a costume
I am making stocks work while you working stock rooms
Ugh, and I was praying I would drop June
But label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes
So I keep it rocking for Pete's sakes
You fake gangsta rappers are cliché
And if you ain't talking dough when you meet Drake
I'll be all in your face, like, ""No speak-a la ingles""
Soon as you hear it, you quote it
They try to be the one that I done left out the show with
But trust me, I'm aware, and my car's right there
Is this interior enough for y'all ulterior motives?
'Cause if you like it, y'all should stick with me
My money good, I ain't never had to flip a ki
A lot of ice, a lot of cream like Dickie Dee
Might cut the phone and disapear like Michie Mee
But I'ma try and have you on the trip with me
Sliding through Henri Bendel like it's slippery
And your ex-man is a hater, officially
Probably 'cause he know I'm exactly what you wish he be
Yeah, that's the reason why he looking hard
'Cause I done snatched the Chips Ahoy out the cookie jar
He just mad 'cause his girl's at the house
With her tongue sticking out like a Michael Jordan rookie card
Let me address this, pardon me while I fix
A couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix
I guess he thought he could've been Gotti in the flicks
But at this point, I'm just poking a body with a stick
Nowadays, rapping is a children's hobby
And girls keep telling me I'm still this snobby
I tell them myself is who I am feeling, probably
Just because I got a buzz like a building lobby
It ain't a song that your ass finna skip
I tried to sell weed, give me cash for the zip
The way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car
Seem like she don't really need no gas for the trip
Millionaire shades, fade with the waves
I smirk at a nigga if he still rocking braids
That just lets me know that we ain't on the same page
And that goes out to every nigga except Trey
I'm outta here, baby
They asked me about the past years and how does it phase me
I wouldn't take it back, nah, not if they paid me
Mr. Bet You That's Expensive 'cause it's not a fugazi
Spitting a Crock Pot of bottomless gravy
The shit is so nasty, how is it tasting?
And you can probably find him walking out of a Macy's
Forget it, girl, they just thinking how to replace me
Exit with a joke, leave these niggas some hope
You took that 'Ye beat and put that shit in a choke
Well, I'm thinking I should leave out on this note
Nigga, keep your two cents, I ain't tryna leave you broke

Hop up out that wheelchair and snipe you off your patio

Leather gloves, knuckles out
Zero in and take that shot, shooting's what the fuck I'm bout

Knock 'em out his shoes and socks

Lock and I load, cock and I pop, pop, pop
Putting shots in his top of the fo'
Lock in his block and I'm clocking his dough
Like I'm dropping the rocks in the pot on the stove
Dropping the top and I'm clocking his ho
Put my foot in his ass 'til his pockets is low
Then I'm L-n him out 'til his oxygen low
Bitch niggas step up a notch in your flow
Cause you not on my level stop jocking me ho
Stop watching me, prophecy probably says
Them niggas that's top on me probably did
But you can get properly shot in the head

Troublesome ’96 Long Outro Version,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Troublesome nigga
Hahaha, troublesome 19-motherfuckin'-96
Let it be known nigga
Boss of all bosses, Makaveli

[Verse 1]
Menacin' methods label me a lethal weapon
Makin niggas die witnessin' breathless imperfections
Can you picture my specific plan
To be the man in this wicked land underhanded hits are planned
Scams are plotted over grams and rocks
Undercover agents die by the random shots
We all die in the end, so revenge we swore
I was all about my ends, fuck friends and foes
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Got me a dog and named her my bitch nigga eater
What could they do to me that little brat
Shit them niggas that shot me is still terrified I'll get they ass
How can I show you how I feel inside
We Outlawz, motherfuckers can't kill my pride
Niggas talk a lot of shit, but that's after I'm gone
Cause they fear me in physical form
Let it be known I'm troublesome
[Refrain]
La la la la, la, la
La, la-la la, lah
Bye bye, bye bye
All you niggas die
Troublesome nigga, Outlawz
Put it down to the fullest
Spittin' rhymes and bullets, haha
We troublesome
Y'all know what time it is
Call the punk police, they can't stop us
Niggas run the streets, we troublesome
La la la la, la, la
La, la-la la, lah
Bye bye, bye bye

Troublesome nigga, Outlawz
Put it down to the fullest
Spittin' rhymes and bullets, ha ha
We troublesome
Y'all know what time it is
Call the punk police, they can't stop us
Niggas run the streets, we troublesome

[Verse 2]
Gutter ways, my mentality is ghetto
A guerrilla in this criminal war, we all rebels
Death before dishonor bet I bomb on the first niggas
Knew we came for murder, pullin' up in a hearse
Westside was the war cry bustin' off freely
Screamin, ""Fuck - ALL Y'ALL NIGGAZ"" in Swahili
Pistol-packin' fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back
Release me to the care, of my heartless strap
Say my name three times like Candyman
Bet I roll on yo' ass like an avalanche
A sole survivor learned to get high and pull drive bys
Murder my foes, can't control my nine
Hearin thoughts of my enemies pleadin', please
Busta-ass motherfuckers tried to flee
Picture me lettin' this chump survive
Ran up on his ass, when I dumped he died;
Cause I'm troublesome
[Refrain]
Young, strapped, and I don't give a fuck
I'm hopeless - I live the Thug Life, losin' my focus BA-BAY
I'm troublesome, haha
Bad Boy killa', there is no one realer
What you saw was the rough rugged and raw - Outlaw!

[Verse 3]
Murder murder my mind state, shit ain't changed
Since my last rhyme - the crime rate ain't decline
Niggas bustin' shots like they lost they mind
Like twenty-five to life never crossed they mind
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang
Dead at thirteen cause he yearned to bang
Sniffed a lot of flowers, but how could I cry
Tried to warn the little nigga either stop or die
Mercy is for the weak when I speak I scream
Afraid to sleep; I'm havin' crazy dreams
Vivid pictures of my enemies, family times
God forgive me cause it's wrong but I plan to die
Either take me in heaven and understand I was a sheep
Did the best I could, raised in insanity
Or send me to hell cause I ain't beggin' for my life
Ain't nothin' worse than this cursed-ass hopeless life;
I'm troublesome
[Outro]
In your wildest dreams, you couldn't picture a nigga like me
Haha, I'm troublesome, I don't give a fuck
I'm troublesome like my nigga Napoleon said nigga
Somebody gotta explain why I ain't got shit
Haha, I'm troublesome
You know what time it is, the Outlaw clique
Young rugged and sick
Makaveli the Don, the boss of all bosses
Mussolini, E.D.I. Mean, Hussein Fatal, Kadafi
Kastro, Napoleon, Komani
Haha, we ain't fuckin' around, we troublesome
Ayeo, haha, we troublesome, I ain't goin', haha
Young Kastro, the first to blast the last one to dash
Goin' for the hoes and the cash
Fuck you niggas, Outlawz
Kadafi, trump tight never sloppy
Them motherfuckas try to copy
But they can't mock you nigga, you're too strong
Outlawz keep it goin' on, you know whassup
Outlawz, Outlawz, haha
Che Guevara on the beats y'all
A.k.a. Jose Johnny J The Cuban Militant
Outlawz, Outlawz
This is dedicated to the real niggas
All the real troublesome soldiers on the streets
I rather die than see the penitentiary
We all fuckin' Outlawz
You know what time it is
You see any motherfucker with a Outlaw on his neck, give him respect or get chin-checked
All our enemies getting wrecked
From the TEC to the Mini-14, we make you all scream
Death before dishonor, the first to bomb, ring the alarm HA HA
Try to flee but you cannot defeat what's in your mind
Outlawz every time, we Outlawz
Troublesome
Troublesome nigga, you know
Troublesome ahahaha
All in your mind, every time
Troublesome"
AM 2 PM,Drake,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Nickelus F]
Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Head to works, I get some breakfast cause, still a nigga yawning
From the night before, at the club, I was up I'm tryna live
Only twenty two, my nig, 'bout to be twenty three, ya dig?
Time don't wait for none of us that's why I gotta chase my dreams
Make my momma proud so she can show off all her pearly teeth
And be half the man my dad was, I thank God he was in my life
I realize how many leave they wives so deep inside
Either I, need to make this music work or move from the Earth
I'm preachin' fire, need a choir, 'bout to take you all to church
My congregation bombed the nation with this hip hop
We in the race to fame, blowin' pass the pit stops
I heard the prize was some chicks and a wrist watch
And all you gotta do is go to jail or get shot
Yeah Nick cop but he ain't never get popped
How we gonna get pop fans? Give 'em a quick shot
Now I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch
Yeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock
It's kinda sick huh? Ay Jay, put an end to all the bickerin'
And tell them niggas this is Nick's spot
They don't keep it fresh enough I got it zip locked
Saran wrap, anthrax, it make ya sick huh?
I'm hot as fire wanna put me out with piss huh?
Reached to do it and realized his dick stuck
[Chorus: Drake]
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
I'm trynna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em ho's
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM

[Verse 2: Drake]
Ayo I stay up every evening, write that shit that they believe in
DJs run it, they approach me, and it's praise I be receiving
From the night befo', at the club, fake I.D. my record spins
Got me dancin' right outside since these niggas won't let me in
Well guess again, slip around the back and get it crackin'
And all the bottles wrapped in cellophane and party where the best have been
Hundred grand, Nickle F, that nigga's the next to win
Virgina gon' rep for him, and Memphis represent for me
To the tenth degree, Tennekey, T-Dot to the country y'all
Orange Mound and Whitehaven, and back up north to Montreal
I ain't ashamed, my city ain't on the map
People get to thinking they really light that fire, realize they ain't born to rap
So they give it pass the torch and sell they soul for enough to throw cash in storage
Maybe they can bring they career back
But these niggas right here ain't trynna hear that
Cause I'm on set, make it work, break even on 9 to 5's
Cigarettes and lotto tickets, tryna keep that grind alive
All my uncles, they hit the casino when they get they check
My cousins, they paint they slabs and pop pistols to get respect
This can't be life, dominoes and chief and dro and twenty stacks
Single mothers phonin' cheaters just to get they honeys back
Purple drink and trips to Kroger's just to get they money stacked
Rest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap!
You think it's funny till these youngings suck a bunny
Pull the jackrabbit out and get to screamin' where the money at?!
[Chorus: Drake]
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
I'm trynna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em ho's
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM"
The Point of No Return,Immortal Technique,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Yeah, it's that real this time around
Immortal Technique, Revolutionary Vol. 2
It's on now, motherfucker, lock and load!

[Verse 1]
This is the point of no return, I can never go back
Life without parole, upstate, shackled and trapped
Livin' in the hole, lookin' at the world through a crack
But fuck that, I'd rather shoot it out and get clapped
I've gone too far, there ain't no comin' back for me
Auschwitz gas chamber full of Zyklon-B
Just like the Spanish exterminatin' Tainos
Rapin' the black and Indian women, creating Latinos
Motherfuckers made me out of self-righteous hatred
And now you got yourself a virus, stuck in the Matrix
A suicide bomber strapped and ready to blow
Lethal injection, strapped down, ready to go
Don't you understand they'll never let me live out in peace?
Concrete jungle, guerrilla war out in the streets
Nat Turner with the sickle, pitchfork, and machete
The end of the world, motherfucker, you not ready
This is the point of no return and nobody can stop it
Malcolm Little when he knelt before Elijah Muhammad
The comet that killed the dinosaurs, changin' the Earth
They love to criticize, they always say I change for the worse
Like prescription pills when you misusin' 'em, nigga
The Templar Knights when they took Jerusalem, nigga
And figured out what was buried under Solomon's Temple
Al-Aqsa, the name is not coincidental
I know too much, the government is tryin' to murder me
No comin' back, like cuttin' your wrists open vertically
How could the serpent be purposely put in charge of the country?
Genetic-engineered sickness spread amongst me
My people are so hungry that they attack without reason
Like a fuckin' dog rippin' off the hand that feeds him
Immortal Technique is treason to the Patriot Act
So come and get me, motherfucker, 'cause I'm not comin' back
[Chorus]
This is the point from which I can never return
And if I back down now, then forever I burn
This is the point from which I can never retreat
'Cause if I turn back now there can never be peace
This is the point from which I will die or succeed
Livin' the struggle, I know I'm alive when I bleed
From now on, it can never be the same as before
'Cause the place that I'm from doesn't exist anymore

[Verse 2]
This is the point of no return, nigga, you better believe this
Mary Magdalene givin' birth to the children of Jesus
The evolution of the world, bloody and dramatic
Human beings killin' monkeys to conquer the planet
The kingdoms of Africa and Mesopotamia
Machine-gunnin' your body with depleted uranium
This is the age of microchips and titanium
The dark side of the Moon and contact with aliens
I started out like Australians: criminal-minded
Broke into Hell, tore it down, and built a city behind it
Southpaw, murderous methodology, nigga
Remember that I'm just a man, don't follow me, nigga
'Cause once you past the point, you can never go home
You've got to face the possibility of dyin' alone
So tell me, motherfucker, how could you die for the throne
When you don't even got the fuckin' heart to die for your own?
It rains acid, one day the Earth will cry from a stone
And you'll be lookin' at the world, livin' inside of a dome
Computerized humanity livin' inside of a clone
This is the place where the unknown is livin' and real
Wormwood to Planet X and the Seventh Seal
Universal truth is not measured in mass appeal
This is the last time that I kneel and pray to the sky
'Cause almost everything that I was ever told was a lie
[Chorus]
This is the point from which I can never return
And if I back down now, then forever I burn
This is the point from which I can never retreat
'Cause if I turn back now there can never be peace
This is the point from which I will die or succeed
Livin' the struggle, I know I'm alive when I bleed
From now on, it can never be the same as before
'Cause the place that I'm from doesn't exist anymore"
So Long,Mike Dreams,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","(Verse 1)
Look
I’ve been dealing with this drama for a long time
You trying to figure me out
Get in the long line
It’s been the same thing
Over and over
I thought it would’ve changed when I got a little older
But I smell it in the air
That same vein odor
And jealousy is there
I switch my lanes over
But they keep swerving back
In my path
I just can’t stand
The thought of having to go back
In my past
Where you hope that they’d understand
But never can
Wish I could jump high in the air
And never land
Cuz I swear
I am getting so tired of they negative
Just because I’m one who desires to
Set a precedent
So whatever they saying
To me is irrelevant
Whenever I’m present
My passion is surely evident
You can only listen to nonsense so long
‘Till you feel like telling ‘em so long
(And I’m gone)
(Chorus-Ryanne Noelle)
Why, do I have to go through this
One more time
Cuz I feel I keep losing my mind
And I’ve been through this stuff a thousand times
So I’ll just have to tell these people bye
So Long, So Long, So Long
Cuz I’m gone, I’m gone, I’m gone
So Long, So Long, So Long
Cuz I’m gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

(Verse 2)
Wanna know what I was speaking bout in the first verse
I was trying to find self
Guess I had to search first
Had one side saying I wasn’t hood enough
The other side stereotyping just cuz my hoodie up
Both of ‘em had me feeling like I wasn’t good enough
Until I grew up
And saw the hatred they was putting up
Yup
All because I wouldn’t play the game
No, I am not a Martian
But we are not the same
I swear they ain’t got the fuel
Or the gasoline
To even plug into my source
Like the magazine
I be feeling like
I don’t need this world
So I be asking God when I’ma leave this world
I’m not talking bout dying
I’m talking bout change
Tell me when will they accept
That I don’t wanna be the same
You can only deal with ‘em judging you
For so long
Til you feel like telling’ ‘em so long
And I’m gone"
My Favorite Ladies,MF DOOM,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Mmm
Ladies
My favorite ladies

[Verse: MF DOOM]
Mary—you make me wanna eat you
Every time I see you, it's like the first time I meet you
Fragrance like a flower—subtle and sweet too
Seductive and whatever, it might as well be see-through
Like my genie in a bottle
Miss could get me rich look like a magaziney model
Before you know it, he have her on a stroll
Fresh and ripe, complexion like Acapulco Gold
If I had to guess, just right, not a day old
Like a cradle robber, copped her off, shop a trailer-load (trailer load)
Know the right number, you can get her
And hit it while you would've sold to the highest bidder, like
Fruits and berries, bring daddy loot in a hurry
Just be cute, and don't worry
Type to make a nigga hallucinate and admit it
Then she started losing weight and letting everybody hit it (Ally)
Unlike Ally—sometimes she get bitter
Always kept me happy, never had a problem with her
She used to let me use her, back when I was looser
Respect her until to this day and never did abuse her
I told her I'll be faithful, but she don't believe me
I probably could've been, if I'd never met Evie
She make me feel all fuzzy inside, it's loco
You won't get nowheres near her if you're broke though
Kept a shorty mad fine 'n' much thinner
If caught, I get mad time just for touchin' her
Knock wood, so much for hymens
So fly, she should be in the sky with diamonds (Lucy)
Little young thing, she liked to do the tongue thing
At times she would play hard to get, fronting
Or something, she made me feel like the number one king
Run into her now, and we still catch a fun fling
Met her out in Central Park, that's one sign
Had the God mentally sparked, reflecting sunshine
She said, ""You need to stop messing with that white girl
She fuckin' with your head and got your heart in a tight curl"" (cookie)
We messed around once or twice, but she don't know me
She helped me get money at the dunce price OT
Plus she from Colombia, so she really Spanish
Cookie known to make a cat bank account vanish (Miss Hazy)
And Miss Hazy; older woman, mature, Black
Every time she sees me, I end up gettin' towed back
All she want me to do is blaze it crazy
The only one complaint is that she make me too lazy
Sugar-mommy laced me with the butter navy Avi
Just her way to make up for the headaches that she gave me
It's all gravy, when I'm done getting my mack on
Ally is always there to help me get back on
[Outro: MF DOOM]

Rapping 2 U,Das Racist,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Whaddup, whaddup, whaddup?
Sit Down, Man! Sha-leik! DR
Whatitat, whatitat, whatitat?
Time to do a rap

[Verse 1: Heems]
Hello Young Cocoa Butter, who is you?
White people love me like they love Subarus
Rolling with the super crew, something like Scooby-Doo
My eyes droopy? Mami that's what doobies do
Kalidasa, but across the Kalapani
Probably with a Khalistani mommy high as I'll be
Das Racist on a roll like wasabi
I don't know what these two are, I'm Punjabi
More cash mommy than Mukesh Ambani
And Anil Ambani, yeah that's real Armani
Yeah that's Lanvin, you call it Lanven
You call it bro-in down, I call it lampin'
I'm from Flushing, bright as a lamp man
That's in Queens like MC Cool Fashion
You can Google that, he's down with the Beatnuts
We got the net wet tryna get the street buck
See Dap, that's my fucking mans and shit
White boy wasted, let me write a stanza quick
Matter fact, yo, all my boys in bands and shit
Haters mad cause they got Costanza dicks
You know, like the show, Seinfeld
Michael Richards made my fucking mind melt
Cop a bundle of Rapunzel
Do what thugs do we just hustle, LATM, BBT, MTV, BET
They called us joke rap, we kinda weed rap
We just like rap, we don't even need rap
Could get a real job, only rap weekly
I don't need rap, told you, rap need me
Indian style, knees bent, in dashiki
Your girl's sext means she wanna get freaky
She beeped me, meet me at twelve
Hit it in the shower cause it's hot as hell
My fans broken, I don't got an AC
Say I got potential, but the kid lazy
[Verse 2: Victor]
Stock is rising wait don't scalp the tickets yet
Older white women say I'm very articulate
Young Obama mommy, but not Illuminati
Yet, they’re tryna gauge if I’m tame enough to be their commie pet
I'm watching Gandhi 'til I'm charged and eating banh mi
Like they was Cars and I was Blondie
We are not the same, I'm Alf swinging a salami
At any prom queens that want me
Probably even Nicki Minaj would massage me
If I got a fade and trim my beard like I was John B
Nice finna eat more rice than Condi
Nasty, see me grace the pages of your favorite Conde Nast Publication
They asked me all about my views on relations of races
And cut out the radical shit for space, that's racist
I’m in outer space reading Frankfurt School treatises
That curl the common man into fetuses
Nietzsche told me that the nostril's where the genius is
Bossy just saucing like its falafel where my penis is
Soap 'em with Falafel like O'Reilly thought a Loofah was
Hitting they chalupa up
First I get real smart, and then I stupid up
Drop it and scoop it up, haters is dookie butts
Groupies is cooky, nuts, see me voice acting
In Space Chimps wasted like my man Stanley Tucci does
I'm truthy blood fishes get mad at me the kid is a whale
In there like a triple-A battery up in the digital scale
In the kitchen with the coca-cola corporation kicking it with me
PepsiCo too
The kid is a Brit, me, the brother's a jitney
And other's is with me
Even if I was a tree you couldn't flip me
Don't ask what it means just kiss me, chick, please, check, please
[Hook]
You, we're rapping to you, my friend and only you
To you
So don't ever say we never did nothing for you

[Verse 3: Lakutis]
Sexy Lexi, ask what the address be
Press be makin’ a face Dizzy Gillespie
Applause, pause, hand me my ESPY
Grammy, I’m Leslie Nielsen, you know I’m chillin’
Float like a butterfly come on sugar baby
On my shoulders, 7 million, sugar babies
Float away on my good looks and charm
Dick like, hot like, baby arm, chicken parm
Release the peacekeeper, chief the peach shisha
Smokin’ peace pipe ride ‘em cowboy see ya!
My Chuck E. Cheese are bucks
My EBTs are cardies, my 18 wheelers trucks
Call up my Nelly parties
Call up my deli starving
What you mean my money no good here
Why, because I made it? Bitch, you know I made it
Shit

Merry Christmas motherfuckers, 2011
Get 'em, get 'em, yeah

[Verse 1: Kuniva]
Hey yo, I'm gone off that henny low cleaved and he smoked
Till he's soaked and covered in blood and without a penny broke
I never was a mathematician, the class division bored me
I was snoring, dreamt of being a graphic villain
And caps we peeling, re-mash admission
Leave your face looking like a fatal crash collision
Blast the 5th and, dip out or throw you in the trunk
And like an old white lady's butt your ass is missing (nigga!)
You can compare me to Rick Ross in some ways (Boss!)
Cause whenever you see the Boss you're going to see Gun Play
Put the torch in your face and Daffy Duck your grill up
This ain’t Call of Duty, grab the uzi, get your kills up
Niggas be rolling, plus they claim they're sitting on grams
But they never tell you their fucking Grams are Golden
I'm so serial, I’ll let the cannon Bussa Bus
In any Scenario, bitch, what the dealio?
I could take the hardest sack and turn it to a kiddy show
If I find you fucked like hide and go giddy yo
I am so vivid, let the bullets play hide and go get it
When I am pissed off, I am so livid
And niggas can’t fuck with us, new niggas or old ones
Fill your homies with hot hollows and grab a cold one
Who next flexing? I lift my two hands up
A tech in each one, and you can forward this text message
[Verse 2: Bizarre]
Yall know Bizarre's going to say some crazy shit (Yall know!)
Shade45 gon' play this shit, I'm amazing, BITCH!
I'm the best rapper ever
Get on stage in spandex and a tight ass leather (Damn!)
Lace weed, cocaine joints
Stop looking for Bin Laden, Bin Laden stay in Detroit
Brain froze, can’t feel my toes
All I need is an eight ball, and a picture of Amber Rose (Kanye!)
20 thousand, Delonte West can fuck my mother
50 thousand, he can sodomize my brother (Sorry bro)
Elton John said he's a celibic fag (what's a celibic fag?)
A fag that don’t like dick in his ass (wow)
Gay or straight, fuck it, we all going to heaven
So put on some skinny jeans, and tongue kiss John Legend
I'm bout to go to Canada, I can’t wait
Tell bitches I know Drake and get my asshole ate
Eating pussy, naw, that ain't cool
But what's cool is eating ass hair with food
I'm a rude dude, Ruder then Jude
Baby face, NWA attitude (Fuck the police!)
And I smell food, time to eat
Pinky porno on, time to beat (I'M BOUT TO BUST!)
Wife went to work, time too cheat
In jail for rape, somebody call reap, I'm a freak!
[Verse 3: Swift]
No surviving this poisonous hybrid
You bitches skating on thin ice and falling inside of it
I am a human piranha, with a murderous persona
I'll drown a nigga inside his own saliva and blood
The mental asylum kicked me out of it, it wasn't enough
I need a higher, more maniacal place to call a club
I'm a cutthroat, a nasty old animal
That'll crack a nigga fast as pistachios and mozzel tov
I stomp a nigga for being soft
See I'm just a dog that opened his mouth and broke the fucking muzzle off
I'm coming for your boss, at any cost
Here, watch this moss eat through his clothes like a mothball
I'm not y'all, stab a nigga with rusty daggers
Give him lock jaw, where they can’t open their trap
Imagine what hack saws could do to these rap frauds, you ain’t thugging
They should be knocking on wood like Jim Duggan
I'm hugging this Glock, I'mma squeeze like an anaconda
That's standing on your block I'll blast any bandana that I see
I’ll beat you with your own I.V. in a 'spital
I’ll put a pillow over that widdle to squeeze
I’ve been a heathen, see I was my momma’s mistake
A born tyrant, I'm bombing where ever you bastards hibernate
They contemplate on killing me, I'm in the D' living it
I'm at the shooting range, and busting before I'm in that bitch"
Honeycomb,Andre Nickatina,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","(Verse 1 - Andre Nickatina)
I'm such a diamond back sparrow, illegal drugs in a barrel
Had to shoot cupid with his own arrow
Makin' noise like SLOT machines, and when I CLOCK this cream
I'mma get up in your mind
Rap, GLOCKS, 'n thangs
And crash the party like the 5-0
But I didn't come to break it up, I came to make the party way more live ho!
Situation's fornication
You never seen an occupation like mines, and the rhyme design
Flamboyant like the Liberace, blow weed like kamikaze
To the bitches that really want me, to the niggas that never spot me
Throw heat like quarter backs, down at the warder track
I gave ya money for dope, you bring the quarter back
Indica and everythang, and when the bell rings
It's like the twelfth grade tiga, man we gon' sell thangs
Make trips to Hollywood, and Chicago
Down in the Florida Keys, and Maraco
My mother got a twin sister
Meanin' if I seen my mother's sister
I wouldn't know if it was my mother or my mother's sister
Aim like a P210, bullets that cut the wind
Brought up and born in the church with doin' major sin
On everything I'm in, this how I play to win
Just the sound of a lawsuit makes a tiga cringe
Cu-cu-cu-cut your body
Man Nicky very naughty, naughty, naughty, naughty
(Chorus - Andre Nickatina)
Man it's the honeycomb, You get your money gone
You either hoop, or rap, or get your blast on

Man it's the honeycomb, You get your money gone
You bring a sack of crack to the drug zone

Man it's the honeycomb, You get your money gone
Makin' cash so fast over a cell phone

Man it's the honeycomb, You get your money gone
You think it's jokes to crack on your funny bone

(Verse 2 - Savage C)
My style is like a rifle, spittin' on rivals
And I put that on disciples in the Bible
I'm spiteful
Of crooked hoes, crooked po's, and crooked crows
I blaze studios with nuclear thorough flows
Mouth runnin' like a track meet, 'No diggity' like Black Street
Lyrically we pack heat like jackas on back streets
Suckas is sorry like Atari, we're hotter than the safari
Talkin' shit like Charles Barkley off a fifth of Bacardi
Burnin' sacks like Bob Marley, hittin' j's like Iverson
Rhymin' doper than Vicadin the trunk boomin' like a Esiason
With more nuts than Murder Dog, we bust it like shot guns
Call me Tom Cruise because I bomb fools like Top Gun
I cover my ceilings with verses to keep things under raps
And my floors with (?) just to stay on track
Get it crackin' like pile drivers, the microphone MacGyver desire
To stay higher than five sky divers
And if 5-0 creeps, they gettin' shook like hands
While we slide out to the honeycomb hide out, like champs
We block journals while blazin verbals 'til' our hands turn purple
You'll get jumped like hurdles by Nicky and Nocturnal
(Chorus) x2

(Verse 3 - KD)
I got spits like I had a thousand pairs of lips
We never slip cuz we all about our grip, don't trip
We're the opposite of sluts cuz we never give a fuck
And we crush what we bust
Credential city on the hush
Cuz I wipe the songs up on the microphone
Until the fights break out and all the lights turn on
It's gettin' rowdy like bar fights, know nothin' but hard nights
A Nocturnal hustler and I love to play my cards right
So understand I'm the man in this
Steady chokin', always smokin' on the cannabis
Like the bodies in cemeteries, we stayin' underground
They told me drop it like it's hot, so I had to put it down

Yeah, New York undercover baby
Whole lotta things done changed
Yeah, there's a lot of people puttin' black eyes in the game
Knahmean, time to do this though

Check it, I had a block locked, but took a fall now I'm off my feet
I gotta eat, so it's back to these fuckin' streets
And I will grow cause I'm a old timer
I bring the drama to any nigga, his babies or his fuckin' mama
I got a look like Tevin Campbell
But still I gamble, hustle and scramble
Cause money is muscles in this damn zoo
And in order to make it, you gotta take it
Be the boom, blast booze, bend or break it but don't fake it
That's why there's no guilt for these trife niggas' bloods I spilt
Took what they built, flippin' they drug game on tilt
Cause in New York, dealin drugs is a sport
You either sell it, smoke it, shoot up or snort
Either way you're caught
And since I'm in it, now I'm in it to win it; sky's is the limit
No more being some motherfucker's lieutenant
Shit, from this point that's how I feel, I wanna fly
Yeah, it's either doe or die

And all hoods I hang with mixed slang in they language
Love, kickin' that gang shit, sellin' on the same strip
Hustlin' hard, no matter how much we hated
So dedicated, even our dreams are drug related
Shit, puff bananas, not even the cops can stand us
Cause of the way we vanish, everytime they come to can us
25 we get the money live - fuck all that funny jive
The streets is our only source to survive
And before any teeny-boppers think about tryin' to stop us
Y'all rather put your head, through the propellers of a helicopter
Cause all my peeps be playin' for keeps
Straight out the litter, so bitter
These bandits don't even need sweets
Bringin' the ruckus, like some mad motherfuckers
Move at night like truckers
When suckers see us, they duck us
Shit, only the real can relate to things a hungry man'll try
It's either doe or die

[Verse 3]
And ever since I was a tarface baby watchin' Scarface
I dreamed of guns and tons of coke on a car chase
A fat connect with a kingpin Colombian
Plus props from crooked cops, payin' him tops not to run me in
Keepin' my toaster in a shoulder holster
Havin' hoes playin' me closer, sexin' on a silk sofa
Livin' the life of the rich and trife
Rugged but sharp like a kitchen knife
Without stress from some bitchin' wife
What a life, that's why I be on what I be on
Always ready to war for a score that's sure to put me on
And until then, I won't seal in what I'm feelin'
It was inside that I cried, but now its spillin'
I'm goin all out, until I fallout; so much of a menace
When I finish milkin' New York I'll have to fall out
On the run, cause I know feds'll try to knock me
And railroad my soul to a hellhole if they got me
But not me, I'm goin out fightin' until I fry
From hot lead no lie, like I said it's either doe or die

It's like a jungle sometimes
It's like a jungle sometimes
It's like a jungle sometimes
The weed smoke makes me wonder
How I keep from going under

It's like a jungle sometimes
It's like a jungle sometimes
The weed smoke makes me wonder
How I keep from going under

Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary

Either you're in it, or your in the way Baby Pah

Verbal Graffiti,Cormega,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
I'm like a panther in the dark
Silent when I strike the paper
Like a dagger in your heart
When I write I leave a mark
I seen the NARCs before they even bark
Told son, ""Leave the block""
Get that money upstairs
In case the currency is marked
Beat a man who plot against me, God forgive me
My enemies die in the street and my heat is empty
Coincidentally
The same fate was meant for me
My AK's my lawyer
When it's on, it represent for me
Vacate the sentence
Case acquitted when your face get splitted
I stay spittin' with grace, chain glistenin'
Gray Timberlands, my niggas face predicaments
But we could either live, die, or face imprisonment
Take a hit of this
Uncut raw, a taste will numb your jaw
My rhyme is on consignment
Just in case you wanted more
Lyrics are furious
I reign imperious
Niggas ain't fuckin' with me son, I'm dead serious
Streets personify me
Like heat I keep beside me
Either I be, the most underrated lyrical
Drug-related nigga who gun be blazin in the projects
A prosperous drug block is subject to conquest
Where I'm from
A fiend'll sell a heater for 5 jums
Dealers scatter when D's or Y come
R.I.P. is written on walls for people who die young
And niggas either dream of b-balling, or to be balling
Sometimes it's hard for me to write
Son, the streets calling
Patience is a virtue
Temptation will hurt you
And sentence to a bid
Your fake friends will desert you
Til' you're assed out
Screaming life's a bitch that burnt you
[Chorus]
I don't expect a fake nigga to feel this
Look in my eyes, stare at the realness

[Verse 2]
I was corrupted by drug supply
Fly kicks, and buckin' nines
Looking up at the skies
Thinking I'm too young to die
Thoughts of conquering
Though we were taught not to sin
Supreme Court and death got a nigga losing lots of friends
My pen's immortal like Mommy in heaven
No man can harm you
An army of angels with true love is there to guard you
Tell my dog Blue, I love him like a brother
The deep shit
Three bricks remain uncovered
The industry didn't want me in
They try to condemn me
Sprewell of rap, they even try to suspend me
Yet a thug nigga rise
People are snakes, and justice is blind
My jury is my gun on my side
Son I write with the trifeness
Engraved in Tyson
Curse the shots that left BIG and Pac lifeless
The realness
Some try to conceal this
Despite that fact, niggas can't match my lyrical illness
I'm a key, you three grams with cut in it
If you want it
I don't give a fuck, nigga
Rapper slash drug dealer
Slash I bust my gun, nigga
Slash your face with a rug, nigga

Burnt Offering,Blue Scholars,"['hip hop', 'jazz', 'r&b', 'blues', 'pop', 'alternative']","[Intro]
I don't know what to write, oh well, yo

[Verse 1]
I offer nothing but the uncertain promise
That I'll honestly pursue the crooked path of the conscious
Not just another body in the battle for the soul
Never sold self for its weight in platinum and gold but
Man we're getting grown
Wisdom got us thinking in the interest of our children
Even if they ain't been given their flesh
Their bones, their homes or their names yet
I'm aiming for the change in my pocket for the payback
The change augmented by the government to nothing
The change of a whirlwind unraveling the coming of that next shit
I can't wait but when it comes, shit
It better be worth the shit that I paid most my life with
It's nice when it rains sometimes
Cleansing minds in my habitat, imagine that I'm digging to find
What was hidden by the myth of a god up in the sky
Knowing that She meant for me to rhyme
[Chorus]
So I give thanks to the most, the least that I can do
I wear this skin to find the me inside of you
When I dream that I'm dreaming I feel most alive
Sacrifice nights, write to survive
Proper hand gestures conjure ancestors
Drinking from the bottle that was meant
For the message that was sent from the tired and the true
I give thanks to the most, the least that I can do

[Verse 2]
Way back I used to call upon the Father often
I fought the devil last night and almost lost –
Now I'm drinking bottled water, flushing out the toxins
Vomiting and coughing feeling closer to the coffin than I ever had
Every morning that I arrive is a night that I survive
Just to be alive, sipping chai, listening to my favorite DJ
Communicate the music, what my rhymes would say
If they were written
With a needle
To the groove
Of a paper
Stylus to papyrus, record to the player
It's more than just therapy or excessive energy
I undo the mechanism meant to imprison me
Spiritually, the view from up is not enough
I dwell below to find the god that I rebuff
Redesigned, redefined what it meant to be divine
Knowing that She meant for me to rhyme
[Chorus]
So I give thanks to the most, the least that I can do
I wear this skin to find the me inside of you
When I dream that I'm dreaming I feel most alive
Sacrifice nights, write to survive
Proper hand gestures conjure ancestors
Drinking from the bottle that was meant
For the message that was sent from the tired and the true
I give thanks to the most, the least that I can do

[Verse 3]
Our Father
My art is Heaven, hollow be
The drums beating me and my tongue into submission
I can hardly speak breathing this indelible high
From an endless supply of Godspeed, and I need
A brand new prayer to read
Seems the old ones grew tons of mold cause they're narrow as hell
Sometimes they be thinking that this heaven's for sale
Worse than that, they still think God is a male
But Moms used to hang up pictures of white Jesus
Fist clutching rosary beads, over the years
I began to question this Father Almighty
Made in His image but don't look nothing like me
But we be the children of the most high
Ghosts of the colonized lost in the time
Redesign, redefine what it meant to be divine
Knowing that She meant for me to rhyme
[Chorus]
So I give thanks to the most, the least that I can do
I wear this skin to find the me inside of you
When I dream that I'm dreaming I feel most alive
Sacrifice nights, write to survive
Proper hand gestures conjure ancestors
Drinking from the bottle that was meant
For the message that was sent from the tired and the true
I give thanks to the most, the least that I can do

[Outro]
Give thanks to the most, the least that I can do
I give thanks to the most, the least that I can do
Give thanks to the most, the least that I can do
The least that I can do-do...
Give thanks to the most, the least that I can do
I give thanks to the most, the least that I can do
Give thanks to the most, the least that I can do

Just gimme the countdown
Know where we goin' {*scratched: ""AZ""*}
Uh-huh {*""AZ""*}
{*""Streets is yours for the taking now""*}
Feels so good {*""AZ""*}

[Verse 1]
You know the come up, stack, get right, put the gun up
Laugh, get nice, split the blunt up
Pray blue and whites don't run up, remain humble
You see the change when the Range come through
When all the fame ups your game
‘Cause your name's mumbled
The chicks notice jewels, it's like hypnosis
It's ferocious when broke niggas get focused
The cars come out, bottles at the bar run out
You know you're large when you in charge
Could dodge a drought
But here's the twist up, when beef and the money mix up
Skirts lift up, a few fights, few stick-ups
Then one little thing just leads to the next
And here come them hot boys to breathe down your neck
Now you gotta pack up, flee from the rest
And just a week ago, you was free from the stress
I guess it is what it is
[Hook: DJ Premier scratching]
""Creepin on a come up""
""Streets is yours for the taking now""
""Creepin on a come up""
""I'm from the place where hardcore is beautiful""
""Creepin on a come up""
""Streets is yours for the taking now""
""I'm rather unique""
""I'm from the place…"" ""Brooklyn""

[Verse 2]
You know the saga, who liver, who hotter
Who shot at who at the Ramada
I knew about beats since Bambaataa
Before ""Beat Street"" streets was heavily deep with the riders
Guns and money, some was hungry
Dysfunctional families that come from junkies
Jailbirds with wanted warrants jumpin' countries
Just jungle surviving like a bunch of monkies
Marked dollars, D.A. NARC's with collars
Niggas snitchin', but still got the heart to holla
Hot chicks in short skirts and damn near topless
Play fly and they gossip, stay high and just ride dick
Can't call it, too fresh to spoil it
Two TEC's to war with, grew up next to all this
So understand, I know from firsthand
The lies of a church man, high off his first gram
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The jails is packed, the streets is wack
It's even worse when your workers tappin' your reefer sack
Wifey's getting feisty, she's beefin' back
Though it's unlikely, it might be her Visa's maxed
The coke is up, so now Kush and Dro's what's up
And the Ricans got the game in the cobra clutch
The D's in the caprice too close to duck
But what the fuck, they can suck on some coconuts
The stress is real, it drains all the sex appeal
Nothing left but jail, death or a record deal
Vibes is weak, hoes wanna slide and creep
Even fiends got a thing for that hide and seek
Stick-up kids, kidnap, switch up cribs
It's still crazy how them cocksuckers hit up Big
'Pac is gone, the state of hip-hop is wrong
You want more then log on to A-Z dot com

Rock the house (rock the house...)
East New York, East New York
East New York, East New York
Uhh, East New York, East New York
East New York, East New-York
To my nigga AZ, hit it off

[Verse 1: AZ]
We was already molded in people's minds as mulignanes
Now we more fucked, stuck with a mayor named Giuliani
You can try to blind me, analyze but can't define me
My mind's divine, heavily entwined with Gandhi's
Far from feeble, I leave your nostrils hard to breathe through
'Cause my cerebrals are more of a higher plane than the Hebrews
My mic devotion brings out my deepest emotions
Overdosin' wannabes posin', sendin' 'em through convulsions
Too hard to follow, you took a bite but couldn't swallow
Your mind's boggled
But I'm as deep as Donald Goines novels
My whole persona's kinda laid back like a recliner
And since a minor, I been fuckin' with marijuana
Wavy hair, my skin got a money-gettin' glare
Strictly menace wear, mackin' off a Guinness beer
So where it all begins is here
Destiny and me finally meet
So how can I be weak? I'm rather unique
[Refrain: Big Daddy Kane sample & Pete Rock]
Why, why, why I'm rather unique
So check it out, why I'm rather unique
So check it out, why, why, I'm rather unique

So check it out, why, why, why I'm rather unique
AZ, check him out, one time, why, why, why I'm rather unique

[Verse 2: AZ]
My verbals rip shit, brains give birth to thoughts in triplets
Fuck it, I'm on some flip shit, ready to let my clip spit
Dramatical, vocals release shells like automatics do
Music's magical, causin' any battles to be tragical, child
Got a style sick as hell, sicker than sickle cell anemia
Slaughter your circulatory like leukemia
Filled with larceny, who want parts of me? I'm vicious
Mad malicious, 'cause it's real on this road to riches
I got this mastered, other rappers'll graft it; weak and wicked
Camouflagin' as killers, how they speak and kick it
Peep this uniqueness, non-believers I'm leavin' speechless
Left to choke as if skunk smoke was comin' through the speakers
Surgically nice with any verbal device
Trife, breathin' life into mics
My eyesight's beyond the twilight
So die or fight, no surrender, no retreat
Techniques speak, I'm rather unique
[Refrain: Big Daddy Kane sample & Pete Rock]
So check it out, why I'm rather unique
Uhh, why, why, I'm rather unique
East New York, East New York, why, why, I'm rather unique
Why, why, I'm rather unique
East New York, East New York, why, why, I'm rather unique
Why, why, I'm rather unique
East New York, East New York, why, why, I'm rather unique
My man AZ to the fullest

So it's gonna take more than your astrologist to knowledge this
Physiologists couldn't even figure out the exoticness
Raps demolishin', certified the way I style it
My wordplay blaze with the rays of ultraviolet
My culture's smilin', gettin' more in depth with each breath
Autobiography follows the footsteps of Malcolm X
Money and sex, Gore-Tex, Donna Karan and Guess
Finesse, success through the life stress, mics I bless
Puffin' trees to get me high as trapeze
Lookin' Japanese, at ease when I'm stackin' G's
So let's discuss, plus degrees
Why the rhyme force is the source for thoughts that's lost
So don't cross 'cause it'll cost
The ghetto savior, smooth for real playa with flavor
Moves be major, with un-explainable behavior
The word's on the street, so keep your ears to the concrete
Why I'm rather unique

Why I'm rather unique

People tend to think all the drinks on me
I don't even have the money to spend
To buy Patrón for you and all your friends (Hey)
Baby, I be on my grind, rain, sleet, snow
Rollin' up good every place we go
'Cause we tryin' get high (Get high), get high (Get high), get high
Know the bullshit and all the problems, but we too gone to see
Little bit of this and a little bit of that
We proceed to give 'em what they need
Just wakin' up, then gettin' stoned
Rub my eyes and check my phone
Open up the fridge to make some waffles
But no more syrup left in my bottle, damn
Well, it's okay
I top it off with scrambled eggs, ayy
Gotta work with what you got, ayy (What?)
Gotta work with what you got

Can you stay a while?
Can you stay a while?
'Cause, girl, I'm feelin' lazy
And I'm tryna hang around

Ain't tryna get out of my bed 'til noon
Neighbors smell the perfume, smoke in my room
And I got the door closed, can't be sure, though
Amsterdam weed, spendin' euros
Get the herb rolled, let's relax
Take your shoes off and kick it back
We escape the world, escape the stress
But I don't give a fuck if the house a mess
'Cause we gon' handle that later, we gon' handle that later
Right now, let's get this paper and smile for all them haters
Ayy, cream cheese and a bagel
Have a glass of milk and an Eggo
I'm rockin' PJs and no shirt
I smoke weed, eat yogurt
Enjoy the best things in your life
'Cause you ain't gonna get to live it twice (Twice)
They say you waste time asleep, but I'm just tryin' to dream

Love is the party, my heart is such a disco ball
She's in line waitin', my guest list too long
I told her I would love her, love her lasts forever
Forever's just a word, I put words together
Steppin' on the stars, she pause
And I know that one day this show will end - applause
The strobe lights are dancin', we've takin' all the chances
She question what we are, and I'll drink to the answer
Cause my heart is out of service, my eyes turn black
I don't see love anymore I'm blind to the fact
I got my world in my pocket, cause I ain' tryna drop it
The sky is at my neck, so I turn up my collar
My world spin around her cause it's a world without her

When the sunlight falls down
There she goes

Strobe lights dance with the stars
And I always take my time

And into the strobe lights
I don't need your light

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
So nasty that it's probably somewhat of a travesty
Having me, then he told the people ""You can call me Your Majesty""
Keep your battery charged, you know it won't stick yo
And it's not his fault you kick slow
Should've let your trick ho chick hold your sick glow
Plus nobody couldn't do nothin' once he let the brick go
And you know I know that's a bunch of snow
The beat is so butter, peep the slow cutter
As he utter the calm flow (""Your mother—""), don't talk about my moms, yo
Sometimes he rhyme quick, sometimes he rhyme slow
Or vice versa, whip up a slice of nice verse pie
Hit it on the first try, villain: the worst guy
Spot hot tracks like spot a pair of fat asses
Shots of the scotch from out the square shot glasses
And he won't stop 'til he got the masses
And show 'em what they know not through flows of hot molasses
Do it like the robot to headspin to boogaloo
Took a few minutes to convince the average bug-a-boo
It's ugly, like look at you, it's a damn shame
Just remember ALL CAPS when you spell the man name
[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
And you know it like a poet, like baby doll
I bet she tried to say she gave me her all, she played ball
All bets off! The Villain got the dice rigged
And they say he accosted the man with the sliced wig
Allegedly; the investigation is still ongoing
In this pesky nation he gots the best con flowin'
The pot doubles, now they really got troubles
Madman never go *pop* like snot bubbles"
2009 Rap Up,Skillz,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro - Skillz - talking]
Uh, uh, the '09 Rap Up ('09 Rap Up)
Yeah, uh, check, yo, yo
I'm 'bout to put this thing in gear
'09's outta here
2010 is in the building, time for a new year (yep!)
Your boy Skillz's back on his grind
Let's run it back and recap 2009

[Verse 1 - Skillz]
D.C. starts off the conversation
Cause we was in yo' town for the inauguration
We froze are asses off but it wasn't just me
That was a small price to pay to see history
Biggie's movie came out and got shine
Ne-Yo and Jim Jones got to scrappin up in Louis Vuitton
TVs went digital, the government's lame
Y'all bought them boxes, to me this shit still look the same
And I don't care about the fate of Jon and Kate
You feel sorry for anybody it should be the plus eight
Havin seven siblings can't be calm
But I'll take twenty of 'em before I take one Octomom
50 and Rick Ross, that's a new level of beefin
LeBron got dunked on and he ain't want us to see it
The news of Chris and Rihanna, broke in the street
T-Pain got on that golf cart and broke some teeth
Tiny and Toya got a show, that's crazy
Tiny you gonna get a second season? (yeah babe)
Run-D.M.C. they got they own street
And Jojo got caught tryin to spark that leaf
Man the game is bananas
For playin hip-hop, Me and Jazzy Jeff got kicked out of Kansas
Rick Ross shades was phony and fake
Enter a newcomer by the name of Drake
The industry got to get it in gear
Cause it's bad when a mixtape is really the album of the year
And his vid' wasn't bad but I was mad at them breast I never had
(Uh, breast I never had, uh)
Eminem and Mariah, sounded bitter
And we all took to this new thing called Twitter
Where you can follow peeps just to see what they say
And if you wanna you can follow me @SkillzVA
Bernie Madoff, he was playin for keeps
Amber Rose became famous without havin to speak
Black Eyed Peas rolled deep (uh huh)
They blacked Perez Hilton's eye and made him pee in the middle of the street
Lil Wayne did it big
He said he wanted to F +Every Girl In The World+ and I think he did
Chris Brown, now that's my guy (uh huh)
But how he do an interview and all y'all notice is the bow tie?
The media went hard
Chris you want us to forget, just say what really happened in the car
Rihanna she kept quiet
Until she had an album to sell but we still ain't buy it (nope)
Mike Vick and A.I., back in action
And we was shocked by the loss of Mr. Michael Jackson
I never thought that star would fall to the ground
Mike was huge, the news shut the Internet down
Through your music, you'll live on my friend
And I know we'll never see a talent like you again
I gotta man up, cause even I was a fan of
""The Real Housewives of Atlanta""
I loved Kandi's song
But that Kim? (that's a dirty, low down monkey with a wig on)
+Tardy For The Party+ brought us some joy
But it never left the ground, just like the ""Balloon Boy""
And to the parents, I'm gonna say ""why lie?""
You named him Falcon but that ain't mean he can fly
Far as R&B goes, Trey Songz's the guy
And I'm a grown man but I'm scared of Lady Gaga
Drake's knee kept sayin ""hey bro, just sit""
And Kanye snatched the mic from Taylor Swift
Then the world couldn't stand him
(I'm, I'm really happy for you, I'm a let you finish, I'm a let you finish)
Man I think he planned that
The government, yeah they think they slick
What happened to ""Cash And Clunkers? That shit came and went
""The Hangover"", was funny as hell
And so are the rappers, who couldn't stay they ass out of jail
Jay-Z went on Oprah and hit number one
She gave out a lot of chicken but she ain't give him none
H1N1 is causin drama
And we was all shakin our heads at Lil Mama
Like, why was you on stage? Nobody gave you a cue
And with a head that big, you should have thought that through
Nicki Minaj gave female MCs some help
But if she signed your boobs, you should be ashamed of yourself
Whitney Houston got back to workin
And kids came up with this thing called jerkin
Where you take dance and rap and combine the two
News flash, come on son, that ain't nothin new
Nas and Kelis they couldn't get that thing back
Diddy holla at me if you want that ring back
Jamie he blamed it on the alcohol
And maybe that's what made J-Lo fall
Health care got passed and that's what's good
But the ""Idiot Of The Year"" is Tiger Woods (it's uh, it's Tiger)
Could you say fail?
Who else is named Tiger? Why would you leave your name on the voicemail?
He changed the game I suppose
It's nothin, who would thought he was puttin 18 holes?
T.I. came home after 7 months
I can't watch Mo'Nique's show cause she yell too much
And we mourned this year, I got to say
Every other day, somebody passed away
Mr. Magic, Roc Raida, my man Baatin
Darian (ah, yeah) and my friend AM
It was a very sad year, to say the least
So to everybody we lost, rest in peace
Uh, ya boy Skillz and I did it again
Welcomin y'all to two thousand and ten (*echo*)"

I only want you to have some fun

[Verse 1: Prince, Lisa, Dez, All]
I was dreamin' when I wrote this
Forgive me if it goes astray

Could have sworn it was judgement day
The sky was all purple
There were people runnin' everywhere
Tryin' to run from the destruction
You know I didn't even care

So sue me if I go too fast

And parties weren't meant to last
War is all around us

So if I gotta die
I'm gonna listen to my body tonight

Listen to what I'm tryin' to say

She was the type to watch Oprah and the Today Show
Be on the treadmill, uh, like OK Go
Had a body, A body that you can't pay fo'
That mean she had some Ds on her but they wasn't fake though
Had a drive for a drive for Rodeo
She spent pesos on those labels
Spin class at the gym, strip tease on a pole
She was so obsessed with her body and clothes
To every party she goes, tryin hard to be chose
They say it's hard for a pimp but extra hard for these (hoes)
Readin Us and People mag, tryna get the scoop
Chasin a actor for a Bentley Coupe
She been through the ball player from the Clippers, then came the pumps off
All thinkin she number one where she was just a jumpoff
Doin all she can for a man and a baby
Drivin herself crazy like the astronaut lady
[Chorus: Lily Allen]
It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
Love is not a mystery, it's everything

[Verse 2: Common]
He had paper since we was in we was in high school
Pop was a doc, mom taught at my school
Lock with the rocks, in his ears he kept jewels
One of the Diddy types, da D-D-Dame Dash dudes
Pushed a Maserati sport, reading the Robb Report
Wanted to be Mike but he was never live at sports
Since golf is in he was on the drivin course
To live the rap life is what he was strivin for
Spendin cash at the bar to get credit
Drinkin Chaundon just because Big said it
They say Ye is but dude was big headed
Rocked the fur in the summer so somebody'd pet it
He had a fetish for shoes that's athletic
Pathetic on his MySpace page half nekkid
It's a shame what they do for fame and to be respected
Joe, you coulda got it if you never woulda stressed it
[Chorus: Lily Allen]
It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
Love is not a mystery, it's everything

[Verse 3: Common]
They was one of them couples, people said they were the it
Unbreakable, like Bobby and Whit
Or Ryan and Reese, or Kimora and Russ
Relationships can be dead but look live to us
I guess we all been through it where we try too much
Losin yourself and you're lyin' and stuff
Wishin for the diamond cuffs, in search of a ring
Where love is not a mystery it's everything

[Chorus: Lily Allen]
It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
Love is not a mystery, it's everything
[Outro: Lily Allen]
Gets me down
Gets me down
Gets me down
Gets me down
Gets me down
Gets me
Love is not a mystery, it's everything"

Walk through a nigga block
Two Glock, two tecs, two two-threes
Give a nigga what he really want
When bitch niggas don't want beef
Bitch niggas don't know me
Wait 'til a nigga get in range
Hate when a nigga wanna run his mouth
Then, live his life in pain
We ain't even used to this
Talkin, where the gunshots at?
Loose lips sink ships
Y'all niggas didn't even pop back
Oh Lord, I swear
Any motherfucker holla my name
I'm raw, spelled backwards
Dat's what I'm gon' brang
Banks, what a nigga thankin?
We ain't got guns? No troops?
E'rythang bulletproof
Snipers layin down on the roof
Stash box in the Coupe NI-GGAH
I'm tellin you the truth NI-GGAH
I raise them lil' penny boys
All they do is come shoot niggas

Black glove, black mask
Black shirt, black pants
Blue steel, blue vest
He dead, you next

Put a couple holes in a ho
Let a nigga know he 'bout to go
Put the pump right to his throat
Bet he won't talk no mo'

E'rybody on the motherfuckin flo'
Soon as a nigga get inside
My hood, my clique
Yo' wife, my bitch
Show a nigga that you really love him
Set him up to hit a good lick
Cops comin, I'm not runnin
If I do die, don't cry
I hadn't planned on stayin long anyway
I ain't gon' lie
Wonder why I still got bricks?
Wonder why I still got clips?
Cause ain't a damn thang changed
Ever since Young Buck done got rich
Are you ready for the outcome?
Why you walkin 'round without a gun?
Shit real 'til a nigga get killed
Then you wanna run and get one
Fuck that, I'm callin out names
Ja Rule, y'all loose
I don't even care how it started
Fuck me? FUCK YOU
Wait 'til Yayo get home

Who cries about his daddy in a blog because his music sucks? (I did!)
Well, you fucking up, and truthfully I had enough
And fuck rolling papers, I'm a rebel, bitch, I'm ashing blunts (Sorry)
Full of shit, like I ate that john
Come on kids, fuck that class and hit that bong
Let's buy guns and kill those kids with dads and mom
With nice homes, 401ks, and nice ass lawns
Those privileged fucks got to learn that we ain't taking no shit
Like Ellen DeGeneres clitoris is playing with dick
I'm jealous as shit, cause I ain't got no home meal to come to
So, if you do, I'm throwing fingers out screaming ""fuck you""
I got ten of these Kennedy's
Not Dom, but if I was a Dahm, I would be Jeffery

I'm fucking 'bout it, 'bout it, like I'm Master P in '96
It's fucking immaculate, the way your daughter smacking dicks
Surprised she hasn't taken gymnastic dick inside her alley-oop
The Golf Wang hooligans is fucking up the school again
And showing you and yours that breaking rules is fucking cool again
I'm going harder than a midget jumping over me
Chronic youth, I'm shoving blunt wraps in bitches ovaries
Punches to the stomach where that bastard kid supposed to be
Fuck a mask, I want that ho to know it's me, ugh

My love is gone for you mami, you could ride in hearses
I'm sick in the brain dumb bitch, can you nurse this?
You told me life would never, ever, ever get this perfect
Then you smoke a J of weed, and take his kids to the churches
Uh, fuck church, they singing and the shit ain't even worth it
In the choir, whores and liars, scumbags and the dirt, bitch
You told me God was the answer
When I ask him for shit, I get no answer, so God is the cancer
I'm stuck in triangles, looking for my angel
Kill me with a chainsaw, and let my balls dangle
Triple six is my number, you can get it off my Tumblr

It was hilarious, well it ain't fucking funny now
I'll push this fucking pregnant clown into a hydrant stuck in the ground

I'm right back in it dead yummy and her mildew stank

Cellz,MF DOOM,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Charles Bukowski]
Born like this, into this
As the chalk faces smile, as Mrs. Death laughs
As political landscapes dissolve
As the oily fish spit out their oily prey
We are born like this, into this
Into hospitals which are so expensive that it's cheaper to die
Into lawyers who charged so much, it's cheaper to plead guilty
Into a country where the jails are full and the madhouses closed
Into a place where the masses elevate fools into rich heroes
Born into this, walking and living through this
Dying because of this
Castrated, debauched, disinherited, because of this
The fingers reach toward an unresponsive God
The fingers reach for the bottle, the pill, the powder
We are born into this sorrowful deadliness
There will be open and unpunished murder in the streets
It will be guns and roving mobs, land will be useless
Food will become a diminishing return
Nuclear power will be taken over by the many
Explosions will continually shape the earth
Radiated men will eat the flesh of radiated men
The rotting bodies of men and animals stink in the dark wind
And there will be the most beautiful silence never heard
Born out of that, the sun hidden there
Awaiting the next chapter
[Verse 1: DOOM]
DOOM from the realm of El Kulum, smelly gel fume
Separating cell womb to Melle Mel, boom
Revelations in Braille, respiration inhale, view
Nations fail and shaking of a snake tail make due
Blazing swords trace the haze, praise the Lord
Saving Grace, lace your broad, she say she bored
A crazy straw, ink and stale dry paraffin
Candy corn crap rappers pale by comparison
A bad samaritan averaging above average men
Rancid rants having rambling savages scavenging
For scraps, perhaps roadkill, if that
Gift of gab, and he flowed ill, chrome stiff hat
Known for writing lightning tight lines, chiefin'
Beefin', being off deep ends, divine bright shines even
Dimes quiet as mimes by design mighty fine
Slight rewind, tightly bind, blind lead blind
Need mines now that was this is then, listenin'
To sizzlin' officialtons whisperin', ""Him again""
Metal Face Finster playing with the dirty money
Sinister, don't know what he saying but the words be funny
Major vet spaded through the vest with a bayonet
Save your breath, gave a F, pay your debt, they forget
Make her sweat bullets, crime pays no benefits
Then it gets wilder with more childisher degenerates
[Interlude]
Three thousand years ago, Moses said:
""Every human being is responsible for his actions
Or thy being is still a beast, not yet human!""

[Verse 2: DOOM]
You ought to let your uncle flow, my motorcycle trunkfuls
From two-one two-one, lose crumbs to chunks in bundles
Hands down, better than what your mans used to get
Standing around from where the translucent looses spit
Missing wheel, you don't listen, you're a feel-head
Sitting in the kitchen pissing, twitching, kissing steel lead
Crime pays no dental nor medical
Unless you catch retirement, county, state or federal
You heard like roaring waters in a seashell
If a tree fell, you couldn't tell from three cell
Be real careful, they tell him by the earful
Kids doing skid bids, acting out is terrible
Word is bond, fix your clothes, put a shirt on
Pants sagging back when you used to meant you had a skirt on
Squirts posing as thuggers and hustlers
El Eloh closer then y'alls ball huggers and jugglers
Motherfuckers!

Diss me, then crawl back

That I need to get off 'cause if I don't
I'ma fuckin' explode or somethin'
Now, look, this is the story about
Some little fuckin' girls that I know
It goes like this

[Verse 1]
It's so easy for me to make enemies any more, it's sickening
People are lookin' for an excuse to jump on my shitlist
Stickin' their noses in shit that isn't none of their business
I never asked, cared, gave a fuck, or wanted opinions
Now I'm in the position that I don't wanna be in shit
I never had no beef with you corny son-of-a-bitches
But now the shit is broke and you can't do nothin' to fix it
So I'm tellin' you right now, motherfuck a Limp Bizkit
Now I'ma be real, B-Real was real
He ain't say shit the whole time me and Whitey was beefin, see, he chilled
He was cool with the whole situation and kept it neutral
I'd have never involved my crew if it wasn't for pupils
Peoples, whatever your backpackin' cipherin' name is
Had I not opened a magazine and seen what you were sayin' and
I'da never involved you, but you had to add your two pennies
Now I gotta go grab my shitlist and add some new enemies
Hit the studio and I'll admit, I had a few in me
Fuck it, I roasted you, I ain't mad at you any
But let it be known that song was never released, it leaked
I'da never gave you that much attention intentionally
Then I look on the TV, now look who's mentioning me
That little fuckin' weasel, DJ Lethal, on MTV
After I gave you props in that song, you on national TV
Talkin' 'bout Everlast is gonna whip my ass when he sees me?
Come on, dawg, you was s'posed to be on that song
Talkin' 'bout how bad you hate him, now you all on his thong?
What's wrong? You scared? And Fred, you said you was dissin' him too
I shoulda knew better than to listen to you
You fuckin' sissy, up on stage, screamin' how people hate you
They don't hate you, they just think you're corny since Christina played you
And I dare you motherfuckers to try to diss me back
That's a sissy act, and don't call me kissin' my ass
'Cause I swear to God this ain't just a song, I'm tryna to pre-warn you
Lethal, when I fuckin' see you, dog, I'm swingin' on you!
Motherfuckers must think 'cause I'm in trouble with the law
That I won't jaw 'em, up my sentence and double it tomorrow
Y'all some...

Girls (Y'all are some goddamn girls)
Why do you act this way? (Why do you act this way, huh?)

And we all know (we all know, hah)
How fuckin' cowards roll (Keep rollin' rollin' rollin'!)
In fuckin' Bentleys and pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and bow down

[Post-Hook]
Now, I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
To be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em, all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em
'Cause I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
To be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em, all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em

[Verse 2]
Now see if you diss me and I respond, the beef is on
But if I help you sell one record
And I see you at a show, I'll strip you naked
See, I was smart, I came back and scooped up my friends
Now I got five dawgs that'd die for me like I'd die for them
I'd fight for them, swing or shoot like I fight for Kim
All of 'em been with me through this fucked up life that I'm in
That goes for all of my dawgs, from Royce to Dre
From Xzibit to Mel-Man, 'til I'm hoist away
In my coffin I'll never soften, no matter how often I'm tested
I'll never give a fuck, I won't never be interested
Love me or hate me as much as Fred wants to be hated
I will solemnly stand by every statement I stated
This shit that I been through my pencil never could pencil
But I will never be this gullible ever again no, nope
Next time I'll know when someone's copyin' off me
I'm not bein' cocky, I just know when somebody's mockin' me
I stick up my middle finger, he sticks up his finger (hey!)
I say, ""Fuck Christina!"",  he says, ""Fuck Christina!"", but meaner
So from doin' a song with Method to beggin' to get accepted
I'm peggin' Fred with the bottle of dye that he bleached his head with
And as for Lethal, don't forget what I said
I'm fuckin' you up, punk, you're dead! Don't think that I'm playin'!
And fuck Bizkit! 'Cause I know you're sayin', ""Fuck D12!""
Only not to our face, under your breath to yourselves

And that's it, that's all there is to it, dawg
If you didn't wanna do the fuckin' song
Don't say you're down with doin' the fuckin' song
And then back out at the last minute
And then go on motherfuckin' MTV talkin' about
Everlast can whip my motherfuckin' ass
If you're scared of Whitey Ford, dawg
Just say you're scared of Whitey Ford, that's it
That's all you had to fuckin' say, I wouldn'ta said shit
I woulda backed off, did the motherfuckin' song myself
And not put you motherfuckers in it, that's all
Now, I ain't even on no rap shit no more
I'm on some fuckin-you-up-shit when I see you
And I will see you, too
Oh, and by the way, Fred
That wasn't an accident
I didn't mean to give you a play at the Music Awards
Haha!"
120 Bars,The Game,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro - DJ Clue]
Yeah! World famous DJ Clue, Desert Storm, y'knowhatImsayin', Black Wall Street, my man Game! I'm out here in LA tryin' to get my man Game to stop beefing, man. We tryna dead all the beef in hip-hop, y'knowhatImsayin'? He said it's gon' be his last one; I said, y'knowhatImsayin', ""Get everything off your chest, get it poppin'"", y'knowhatImsayin'? The beef after this is gon' be dead, man. I think, y'knowhatImsayin', y'all need to sit down and work this out, man, but Game gotta say his peace, man. You gotta do your thang, baby! Let's do it!

[50 Cent sample x4]
Baby this is real shit
My record sales slow, I'm a show you my dick

[DJ Clue - over sample]
C'mon, Game, it's the last one! No more after this, man, for real! Stop Snitchin'–Stop Lyin'!

[The Game]
Here the breakdown
No 400 bars yet, I don't need that
I'm gas, your whole click is ass, I mean that
G-Unot cocksucker, better believe that
I say it one time, watch the whole world scream back
G-U-N-O-T, now that's for Billboard, rest in peace
And since my nigga died, I been stressed, no sleep
Contemplating suicide in my Lexus jeep
I tried twice but I couldn't make my death complete
I guess you could say Mýa got the best of me
Came back from the dead to address the beef
Kiss my Converse, bitch, and accept defeat
Cause I hate it when bullies try to test the weak
That's when I go Bishop in Juice and start flexin' heat
You could get it in the stomach just like Raheem
Cause runnin' with a snitch is not quite my thing
I tried to take Buck with me, but he stayed on the scene
Guess all I can do now is pray for Supreme
While I finish my next album, five million and countin'
Anticipating, tellin' the world I did it without him
If Aftermath was a family that didn't have a mother
I'd be Dre's newborn, you'd be the jealous older brother
Yea, daddy love us but in the meanwhile
You talkin' behind his back and in his face you smile
You moved out the house, you a failure now
And lil' Game grew up to be a problem child
I whip ya head boy, that's for Kanye West
I whip ya head boy, with the back of my tech
Yep, your fuckin' group fell flat without me
You mad, what you gonna do, rap about me?
Your bars is park garbage, hooks is mediocre
And your new shoes look like Reebok pennyloafers
Try to walk in my shoes a block
Hurricanes in stores the day after Christmas, nigga; fuck Reeboks
You a steroid addict, you need detox
Hopefully you make it out in time to be on Detox
Cause Black Wall Street expandin', yeah I bought three blocks
My CL so smooth, it should've came with Pete Rock
And let's not forget who made me hot
It was Dr. Dre that took me out the weed spot
You want credit, forget it, I did it on my own
Gave you 300 bars, then said I'm gone
But I'm back, this is rap and a fact is a fact
They say once you turn snitch, you never go back
Here's a picture of Ja Rule, motherfucker hold that
What goes around comes around, get used to the gold plaques
Homie got cheese, but he don't feed no rats
I show the world my dick if Lloyd Banks go plat
I'm lyrically insane, Lloyd Banks know that
He told me I was like a Big Daddy Kane throwback
Started with one brick, built my own company
And don't spread news about it unless it come from me
Guess who's the boss, nigga my squad deep
But Glasses Malone is not signed to Black Wall Street
Nigga don't, don't, don't, don't, don't believe the hype
Hear that Mike?
And don't be alarmed, this is not a diss
But missusing my logo kinda got me pissed
And I got enough beef, now Lil' Eazy dissin
He don't write his own raps, so I gotta forgive him
I got love for ya pops and I always will
So on behalf of Eric Wright: my nigga, you gotta chill!
I'm the reason you new westcoast niggas got a deal
While I was doin mixtapes, they was watching College Hill
For real, you mothafuckas ain't got half my skill
I run this shit like OJ in pads for the bills
Trying so hard to be a gangsta, nigga you seethrough
Posing like 50 on the cover of the GQ
Button up shirt with the cut off sleeves
I got twin Desert Eagles, nigga suck on these
I got that CEO flow, yea my bars are sweet
Like Hova in Takeover, chewin' out Mobb Deep
Like Pac on Hit Em Up, chewin' out Mobb Deep
Don't one of you niggas got sickle? Fuck it, talk is cheap
When I see you, and I'm gonna see you
I'mma strip you down asshole naked and that's how I'mma leave you
Then I'mma find Havoc, make him walk through Queens nude
With Black Wall Street tattooed on his back
Nigga signed to G-unit, now they bustin' guns
But last week it was: ""My nigga Game! What up, dun?""
See, that's what the fuck I mean: you can't trust these rap niggas!
And you wonder why I always say ""Fuck these rap niggas""?
So I'mma break it down for MC's and friends
If you don't hear your name, let the beef begin:
Ain't got shit against Hov, I like the nigga's style
Nas is my nigga, I been bangin' him for a while
I fuck with Fat Joe, he got the streets locked
And that's the same reason I fuck with Kiss and D-Block
Place Eminem in the number three spot
And Snoop is like my big brother, we both raised by the Doc
Young Jeezy you hot, we both new to this
While I'm in the ATL, shout out to Ludacris
Cause your uncle Scarface show me that crime pays
Just like Paul Wall got me sittin' sideways
And I can't forget about the homie Mike Jones
Who? Mike Jones, Skeet screw the fuckin' song
I fuck with Slim Thug and my nigga Bun B
Can't do that without saying ""Free Pimp C!""
And thats the reason why 50 try to pimp me
So I went window shoppin' and bought two Bentleys
I'm in the drivers seat, motherfucker don't tempt me
Turnin' Spider Loc against me, cause you're scared to come get me
Cuz know whats up, Bloods still got love for 'em
Come to the block, I'll shake off the rug for 'em
As for G-unit, motherfucker it's a wrap
Ma$e made it out alive, thank God for that
If Dipset don't get you, Jesse Jackson will
And if all else fails, I'll see you in hell
Wear that G-unit spinner when you come to L.A
I have a nigga parkin' cars, dressed up like valet
He gonna turn back past him when the gun in his face
The real chain still in Chicago but I'm takin the fake
You can call who you want, I ain't givin back shit
Unless Olivia show the whole world she got a dick
Can't sing to save her life, but she talk a lot of shit
And I want my ten G's cause Yayo caught a brick
I guess my G-Unot tattoo was a smart move
Cause in the end you lost a hundred mill to a cartoon
Three years after you got tatted by Cartoon
The beef is over, G-Unit gonna fall apart... soon!
[Outro]
Hahahahaha!
Faggot ass niggas!
I guess I win, nigga
Life is a game of chess, nigga:
Some kings, some queens
Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, Young Buck, Pastor fuckin' Ma$e:
You niggas is pawns!
50, or Boo Boo, or Curtis, or Chicken Little, hahaha
Stop Snitchin'–Stop Lyin' in stores December 6th
The DVD, it's a tell all motherfuckers
Yeah, my documentaries be better than your movies nigga, hahaha
I drove by your house, nigga!
Go buy the DVD; $16.99, nigga
At your local record store, Blockbuster, Sam Goody, Warehouse
Shout out to the moms and pops, for helping me slay them faggots
G-gu-g-g-gu, G-gu-g-g-gu, G-gu-g-g-gu, G-Unot! Hahahaha
Pop off nigga, hahahaha, pop off nigga, pop off
It's me, The G-A-M-E, gone"

300 Bars  Runnin,The Game,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: children talking about 50's music]
[Kid #1]
My mom took me to Sam Goody
I wanted to buy a 50 Cent CD
I took that shit home
That shit was wack like a motherfucker
I fuck with Game

[Kid #2]
I like 50 Cent
He reminds me SpongeBob
And Tony Yayo is Blue's Clues
And Lloyd Banks is Dora the Explorer
They're my friends
Psyche

[Kid #3]
I went down one of them bodega shits right there in Harlem
Got me a bootleg Lloyd Banks and Young Buck CD
Took that shit home, put it in my boombox
Thought I was 'bout to be on some Radio Raheem shit
Man that shit sound like some Vanessa Williams in '88
I mean Olivia cute but they say that bitch a man
So this Black Wall Street for life now
G-G-G-Unot!
[The Game]
300 Bars and Runnin'
Just loan me your ears for fifteen minutes
Walk with me
Here the breakdown
Pass the doja, .45 in the holster
Hollow tips'll fold 'em, them niggas, they toy soldiers
Oh, that boy colder than Hova unless he sober
Like I'm the president, but this ain't the Takeover
Now, there's the speaker, bring your ears a little closer
Before you call this a diss, and you make Hova pissed
Why would I wanna do that? When I'm just the new cat
That was taught if a nigga take shots to shoot back
Defending his yard, yeah, standing his ground
I'm saying if you gonna retire, then hand me the crown
Nah, let Bleek do it, then throw him a concert in Madison Square
Watch everybody sleep through it
We can go bar for bar, I'll let the lines speak to 'em
What they say? Bleek is over, let Chris and Neef do it
They say the wrong thing, I'ma smack 'em silly
What you thought? Them was the only niggas rapped in Philly?
See them niggas with the sunnis leave you wrapped in Philly
Then dash in groups like Beanie Mac in Philly
Cosmic Kev called, said Curtis Jack in Philly
Make a U-turn, I gotta go back to Philly
I forgot my cheesesteak, that's what I told the cops
So they wouldn't get the dogs start searching for the Glock
And I can't forget, B.I.G. got murdered by the cops
Even I was ready to die, when I heard that he was shot
What's beef? Beef is when I murk you on the spot
Labels signing anything, still searching for they Pac
I put purple on the block, so I don't feel threatened
When Ludacris say he coming for the number one spot
Ask 50, it get lonely on top, you can hate me
Or love me, but now the cops the only homies he got
When it's beef we eat, when we hear bologna, we pop
You sell records but a G-G-G-U-not
Acting big on the radio, to me you not
You can ask Mister Cee who hot
Tony Yayo, I bet 10 G's you flop
Run up on that new 300C you got
Stop hoping I fall, hope the bleeding stop
And I hope you blackout before you see the cops
I ain't High Top from Colors, I'm from Cedar Block
But what I got in my high tops'll make your breathing stop
I'm a gangsta slash rapper, check your CD shop
I'm like Elvis in there, they can't believe he dropped
Now I'm moving on up to George and Weezy's spot
I picked up where my homeboy Eazy stopped
I saw the west coast, put the shit on my back
Sprayed Aftermath on it, then loosened the straps
It get hot in here, let Lucifer rap
Bring hell to niggas when Dre producing a track
Take it to the streets, put the duece-duece to your hat
Then call the pigs, tell them the rooster is back
Call Jadakiss, tell him that duke is back
I'm still by your side, no matter who comes strapped
Fuck Lloyd Banks, it ain't about who could rap
It's about when the Ruger clap, is rufus back?
I see what you thinkin', you want me to die, is that so?
Now you left leaning back thanks to Fat Joe
We got reservations in heaven, you ready? Let's go
Drop them off, then pop Cristal with Esco
I'ma say he hit me first if me and Dre talk
All Nas said back was he had a braveheart
Now that's the eulogy, beefing is kinda foolish
See niggas running their mouth about what the fuck they gon' do to me
But quit the yapping before I proceed to clapping
And you gon' see the captain with plans of getting me captured
Even behind bars, I'm still gon' shine
I'm ten years younger than Yayo, I get out, I'm fine
Then I go right back, nigga, I pop minds
How you gon' drop Olivia? You only drop dimes
I knew you changed when you started sleeping in that vest, dawg
I don't need 50 Cent, my niggas make collect calls
1-800-split a faggot nigga wig
He got G-Unit wings, throw 'em off the Queens Bridge
Now your career is over-career is over
We in Q.B., banging C.N.N. in the rover
T-O-N-Y, that's Capone n' NORE
You ain't the talk of New York, your sixteens is boring
Take that shit off nigga, go back to PC
And tell 50 Cent to send you a copy of Beef 3
I'm airing their ass out on D-V-D
You wanna rhyme like Lloyd Banks, repeat after me
""I'm a G-Unit toy soldier on Sesame Street
Doing voice overs,"" bitch ass nigga
Need a rhyme dictionary to rehearse his lines
Sound like Oscar the Grouch with them nursery rhymes
We was in the studio when I first got signed
He got stuck, he called 50, tried to borrow some lines
That's the wrong nigga, when you need help with your rhyme
All he gon' tell you is say G-Unit one more time
Got mad 'cause I ain't wanna make your beef mine
You got lucky with Ja, why you ain't go at Shyne?
He freestyled from the pen, that's just the fact
Said he'd put you with your mom and you ain't fucked with that
Then you lied about your pops, he never bust no cap
Like father, like son, go ask Busta that
I knew from the beginning not to trust those cats
I'd kill 'em all if I could bring Justo back
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
I said
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
And I'm far from Houston but you can chop it and screw it
Do whatever to it, put it in the store, the shit moving
Gave 'em a hundred bars, they ain't think I could do it
Came with two hundred, nigga this is more than music
Even Dre knew it, that boy hot like summer
Both feet in the dirt, 300 Bars and Runnin'
I beef with any nigga, say my name, motherfucka, I'm gunnin'
You can put it on Skee if you want it
I'll air you out on Drama King, Mike, or Clue
And watch them shits sell out like a Air Jordan shoe
I told Funk Flex when I catch the nigga Whoo Kid
We gon' see if he know how to DJ with bruised ribs
Don't hit me on the Sidekick asking what you did
Get a gun or ask 50's police to use his
'Cause Bloods gonna get ya
Blood-Blood-Bloods gonna get ya for that Shadyville chain
That 380 spill brains, when I pop shots
Outside N.Y., in front of hip-hop cops
Or broad day in L.A., I'ma tell Em and Dre
This nigga bootlegging my music, ain't nothing for him to say
Took me off my own songs, then put it on his tapes
So I'ma take him out his house, put the beam on his face
Drop him off at Terror Squad, let him scream for the jakes
'Cause when you fucking with Jayceon, you can bleed in the lake
For caking off niggas on them CD's and tapes
Ask him to scratch a record, you will see that he is fake
If 50 was Puffy, you'd run and go get him a cheesecake
Take the DJ off your name, Mr. Instant Replay
Now the instant replay, I mean the machine
That G-Unit use every time 50 on stage singing like
""Bitches only feel your shit just a lil' bit
Niggas only feel your shit just a lil' bit""
On my album, 50 helped me just a lil' bit
Only on two songs, now back to some killer shit
My clips bananas, I kill a gorilla quick
Beating on your chest, I see to your death, yep
Tell Ecko to make him a suit
Tell Reebok to make him some boots, get him a head band
To cover the holes in his head, he a dead man
For thinking he can walk through muddy waters like Redman
Banks blacked out and let the gun blam
Without a M-E-T-H-O-D Man
So the lieutenant gotta ask for his strings
Take my advice, never wear Air Max to the bing
Unless you one of the Bloods or a Latin King
'Cause if you left with the Aryans your ass'll sting
And your cellmate is a 25 to lifer
They'll stab you in Folsom, then fuck you on Rikers
And life goes on
Now back to the coward of the hour, who lied and said he write my songs
He told Vibe Dre was gonna leave me on the shelf
So he gave me all his hits, you should've kept them for yourself
Nigga stop acting tough before I stand over you
Show you how The Documentary live on top of The Massacre
Make a move, I'm blasting, add those to the last ones
Ten shots from the MAC, empty the rest in the passenger
Fase yelling that's enough, let the coroner bag him up
Throw in Makaveli and lift the doors on the Maganum
Gun smoking, Fase think I'm locin' backing up
Reverse the '05 hearse on 41st and traffic, what
Hip-hop cops on my left, but I pass 'em up
The Dodge got a Hemi in it, Game got Remy in 'em
In and out of lanes like a New York cab
I miss the old king that New York had
Who's this fake nigga on pictures with the Jake nigga?
Got his crew starving 'cause he ate the whole cake, nigga
He ain't Nas, ain't B.I.G., ain't Jigga
If he ain't Cube or Pac then who you got?
We getting tired of you talkin about who you shot
I'll use another six bars to tell you who you not
You ain't 50 Cent, he went out like a gangsta
You went out with Vivica, three months after Wanksta
Get Rich or Die Tryin, we thought you was hot
Now the same nigga wanna take us to the Candy Shop
C'mon man, what happened to the thug?
Now you could find in the club, him and Lloyd Banks hugging
Nigga got mad when The Game start buzzing
So fuck making friends now I'm into throwing slugs
Olivia talking about we a family, Game had to go
Nigga, I'll smack that hoe like I'm Jackie-O
'Cause I don't wanna be cool, I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna shake hands or wear your G-Unit shoes
Don't want you on my hooks, don't wanna be in your group
Just wanna sit here and wait (for the summer)
To be gone, so I can head back to the block
Fresh white Nike Airs and the matching Sox fitted
Pull the brim low, if they don't get it
Bentley Coup on gold Daytons, I was the first one with it
Four times platinum, I done been there and did it
Came in the game and shitted, then wiped my ass with it
They say the Lord giveth, Lord take it away
So I build a house on top of Hip-Hop, I'll wait for the day
Niggas hating on me, they don't want Jayceon to play
And the D.A. waiting on Jayceon to make a mistake
So they can put me in the squad car and lock me away
Give me a odd job in the pen for minimal pay
Let me out so I can drive down criminal way
Pushing the rock, nah, this ain't no subliminal, Jay
The summer too hot and I just want the winter to stay
'Cause I'm a cold nigga when I put the pen to the page
Similar to them shells going into my gauge
I hand 'em off to Dre, he turned them into grenades
And Just Blaze, 'cause the boy got game
Like I close my eyes, and woke up in a Roc chain
Now back to reality, my gun and my vest
And if diamonds are forever, then I'm Kanye West
Take a look at my chest, a hundred thou wet Jacob
Whole crew got chains, a hundred thou can't break 'em
And the flow is hot like thou with Satan
And the only thing I got spinning is Daytons
The hotter I get, the more willing to snake 'em
So soon as the beat drop, watch where I take 'em
Compton swap meet to get me some All-Stars
When Game in the house, they callin' all cars
'Cause they heard about what went on in D.C
Heard about Hot 97, my beef with 50
Now tell me do he got a conscience?
I think not, 'cause if he did I wouldn't be involved in his nonsense
Wouldn't be in Harlem, wouldn't be at this conference
I'd rather be pushing rock like Samantha Ronson
50 whispered in my ear, like we still bonding
We ain't friends, I'm just acting like Charles Bronson
Middle finger in the air, one hand on my Johnson
Hip-Hop police on me like I'm the convict
What happened to the old school? I thought it was rhyming
Doug E. Fresh and Dana Dane on the corner like Common
Now that ain't common, it's more like Top Ramen
The flow is noodles, I throw it up like vomit
And I still shine like diamonds, they kicked me out of
G-Unit and I rebounded like Rodman
It's still Aftermath, two feet in the paint
Should I be mad? I ain't
I'm supposed to stop, I can't
Because I'm in the hood politicking, Impala liftin'
And I keep a black four-five on the side of my Prada denim
Chip on my shoulder like I'm fresh outta prison
Dollar vision, blow a hundred thou like my wallet missing
Then re-up like Kim before the d-cup
Continuously getting money with my feet up
Chasing the throne, here my black Air Force
I said fuck Benzino and got the cover of The Source
Feel me? If not then I guess you gotta kill me
But you ain't gon' do that, so, motherfucker, move back
While I do B.I.G. and Pac impersonations on two tracks
When I wake the dead, everybody remove hats
We miss y'all, can I get a hand clap?
Now back to rap and why I gotta stay strapped?
On that murder T-I-P, kill you ASAP
They don't know which hole to patch up when the K clap
I tried to spare you Young Buck, now it's time for payback
It go, how you from Cashville but you ain't got no cash, nigga?
Say my name, now that's your fucking ass, nigga
Kept your mouth shut and I gave you a pass, nigga
Now I gotta lay you down like the last nigga
Buck, buck, buck from my AK-47
This nigga playing with his life, I might have to put him in Heaven
Tryna play the game, talking shit up on the stereo
Prepare for burials when I'm reincarnating Harry-O
And you don't want that David 'cause you love your life
Get my Vibe? When it's war, he pull out butter knifes
Muthafucker, I'ma show you who the gangsta
All you do is Murder Inc., now who the wanksta?
When Suge had you, you were stranded on the row
Juve left you for dead and went back to the N.O
50 heard you on the tour bus and felt your little flow
Then he made you temporary replacement for Yayo
You a bitch and that's hard to swallow
And you got robbed for your spinning G-Unit chain in Chicago
I call my nigga Jojo to get it back
He had the shit in his hands and you ain't had the ten stacks
Picture that, I thought we was G-Unit
Then you ran and told 50 that I did the shit
Ask C-Murder, the boy ain't hard to find
I told Monica when I catch him, the boy is mine
Take one shot of Brandy and pop
Watch his panties drop when I run inside the Candy Shop
Fuck you, 50, Banks, Yayo, and the cops
And Olivia, I mean for a man, she hot
Now I'm running out of breath, like I just beatboxed
Got twenty bars to go, lay it down like sheet rock
Don't worry about the flow, the boy know he hot
Hurricanes in store November, nigga, fuck Reeboks
I'm fly like a hummingbird on a tree top
The new Hov, the new B.I.G., the new Pac, I need three spots
280 in, ain't no getting me back
I'm yelling, ""Fuck the world,"" on my victory lap
Remember first it was Buddens, then it was Bleek
Now it's whoever, motherfucker, yeah, who want beef?
Now whenever, motherfucker, who wanna see me?
In the coffin, body exhausted, resting in peace
You don't want war, nigga, you want peace
So give 'em the piece, capisce, let 'em rest in peace
From West to East, the flow is outdatable, irreplaceable
Lyrical homicide, hell is hot, I'm boxing with Satan
And I slipped 'em the ace, so you cannot replace 'em
If Eazy ever decide to return, I remain Jayceon
A king in the making and the throne is for the taking
So I climb the mountain top and put my stake in
Got the weight of the world on my shoulder
Not a nigga, nor a hoodrat bitch can stop me from taking it over
This is crack music, go get the baking soda
300 Bars and Runnin', nigga, the wait is over
I'm gone"

Get the telephone please, it's an emergency

Never have you heard a similar sound
Like a drop off when shit pop off, feel a hot one
Side scorching from a hot gun
Niggas get lost in the buildings wit money and the children
Not the type to talk too much and catch feelin'
Dominican flag over the bed on the ceiling
Protect everything I rep, that's the first thing
Many things follow, bullets stay hollow

Every time you pick up my phone, you starting shit again
Here we go again

Don’t wanna fight 'cause I can’t win

Why would I want to fight with you?
Beefing with you is worthless
Cause I think God made you for me
We match together perfect
You’re acting insecure
Why don’t you think I would stay with you?
Girl if its up to me I’ll spend forever and a day with you
Engagement, ring ring, 10 carat bling bling
I be on that boss shit

Thats why we straight, I’m out of state

You're my soulmate, us being together is our fate
Leaving me would be a big mistake
Wrong move to make
Apart, both of us would be in bad shape

Now all my ladies in the house say hoe
And all my hoes in the house say lady

I’m so considerate, I never quit a bitch
No matter how many niggas hit, or how many dick she licked
I please that clitoris, I give her a kiss and shit
When other niggas don’t stay long enough, they get the digits and split
If ain't nobody telling you that you are pretty
That's just because you are and they do not want to admit it
Look at all that ass, you ain't got to have titties
At least you part of the itty bitty titty committee really
You goin let em style on you, or you can let em talk
Hop up in this Lamborghini, baby, go on let em walk
Stop hanging round them stupid bitches, you’d be better off
Them hoes dirty birds, Atlanta Hawks
Go on wear them granny draws
Matter of fact go put that dress on, and don't wear any drawls and come sit on Santa Claus
We can take some pictures with the islands in the back drop
We can go to PC, but you’ll still be my laptop

They say numbers don't lie, lets try a 69
Kiss her on her lips let her pussy hole drip
She can't even walk to the bathroom she gotta skip
Kiss her on her cheek, make her pussy lips speak
Now she pulling on my locks, Kiss, Styles, Sheek
Kiss her on her breasts, east and west
And then I go south and clean up my mess
No stop signs, no red lights
She put on a show, no stage fright
And then I fuck her right, and she say fucking right
She climb on top that mountain and ride that mountain bike
She keep it nice and wet, like Armor All,
She keep a close shave like Barbasol
But all in all she’s just Weezy baby

Pigs with the heads of men spat acid
That lasered my third eye closed like LASIK
A midget in a casket like a baby in a bonnet
With a bottle and a basset horn playing the theme song
From Children of the Corn, oh I must be dreaming
A lady in a night gown puffing kush screaming
Signalled me over, ""Psst, you with the waves
I’ve seen you from the Catholic church steeple diggin' graves
I got your number sonny
So ain't no use of fighting, yelling or running from me""
""I never ran ma'am"", ""Well then you ain't a clever man Sam""
Listen, the two-faced king from Britain and Rome
Had a baby in a bush on the grassy knoll
Where they peel back the orange head peel of a gnome
He said ""Hey MC, I know you like killing 'em
You terrorized the skies for 25 millenniums
Now you settin fire to land
You the lion, you the savior, the messiah, the lamb
You need back up, you moving on the youth at dawn
Call Badu and get Tyrone on the megaphone
Tell'em I sent you and your codename is Megatron
If trouble comes use your brain like a telephone
He'll take you to the Chocolate City
Where two-face and the prince of darkness had a Committee of Snakes
Drill 'em, let the skin peel off to reveal him
Then spray 'em wit them rhymes you like spilling
Hit 'em up real, real good but don't kill him
We only want to burn him to the point that they willing
To give the location of the blank face villain
Who split atoms and give mushrooms to civilians
Hiroshima never recovered and all the evidence was smothered
Under a thick cloud of rubble
The pope is his brother
The hillsides is his mother
That statue with the torch and steel eyes is his lover
She's a harlot, who stood still like time while New York turned scarlet
And the levee monster sucked up New Orleans
While they was playin' man vs. man in Afghanistan
With they mind on Iran, Iraq and Sudan
Let him recruit you, he will try to use his powers to seduce you
Just let him think that the feeling is mutual
Because if he found out that you already knew
The atom had a positive, a negative and a neutral
He'll probably salute you
Then wait till you turn your back like a coward and shoot you
People this shit is crucial

Where the fuck's all these niggas saying Ran' isn't hot?
I damage the block, I scramble like Randall with rocks
I'm that nigga in the gambling spot
Cracking jokes and drinking liquor
You still gotta hand me your watch
I'm in the kitchen with the pans and the pots
Razor on the plate, tryna figure out how many grams I'ma chop
Family or not, some niggas making plans with the cops
Tryna figure out how to make this animal stop
Who these niggas tryna take down, breakdown? Trey pound
Eight rounds, he ain't feeling nothing from the waist down
Hit up, lit up, he never gon' get up
There's only one legend alive, the rest you gotta dig up
You acting like it's hard to roast ya
I'll creep in your crib and put your brains on your Barkley posters
Got no time to be boxing around
I got the ox and the pound, I'll leave you in a box in the ground
Got the keys to the game and we locking this down
Underwater with the sharks and we not gonna drown
Got the order from the narcs, they still watching the town
I'm copping a pound, they ain't no stopping us now, my nigga
[Verse 2: Freck Billionaire]
Ya clip trip, clip spit'll get your strip wet
I got the rubber grip Smith in my rich sweats
Player haters talkin' 'bout they gon' get Freck
I'm in the Lamb' sunk lower than a shipwreck
They call me bar-for-bar cause I spit the better lines
The white bitch got me rich like Federline
Fuck a G-pack, I'll show you how to re' crack (How?)
You get it soft and then you rock it like T-Mac (Oh)
The weed good price, plus it smoke so spec-y (How much it cost?)
Three thousand for pound of some Dro Pesci
Y'all niggas only talkers, I'll let my homies spark ya
We in them Spurs that's faster than Tony Parker (What else?)
This is Family, nigga, don't ever cross my brother (No)
Like Big Worm, niggas rather cross their mother
Mention names in my family tree
This nigga talking crazy like insanity plea
I, swear to God the next nigga I give it to
Is going to a place FedEx can't deliver to (Let's do it)
I'm West Philly Freck, yeah I get dirty
I'm the best hands down like 6:30

[Verse 3: Paul Cain]
Look, like Michael J. Fox, I got family ties
Posing us can't be wise, swept across, your family dies
Something small as a look, can bring about a man's demise
And whoever he stands beside hit him where he can't survive
Throw the drop or slip an object, if not then missing
Nine shot, pop a clip in, pine box the opposition
Put him in formal dress, right hand across the left
No autopsy necessary to determine the cause of death
Six shots across the chest should explain his loss of breath
Skin peeled off your flesh, I know you wish you wore a vest
That's a no brainer, I'm coming with both flamers
I'll spray 'em but I'm no painter, to this here, I'm no stranger
It's obvious you no bangers, you dudes pose no danger
Your whole crew chumps, in the closet like coat hangers
Like purple broke up in the Dutch, leave you broke up on a crutch
That's what happens when shooters choke up in the clutch
We gon' body you and have to hook your wife to an IV too
Put both of your parents side by side in ICU (Everybody lose)
Closed casket so they can have a proper wake
Don't interfere with Family business, that's how we operate
[Verse 4: Joe Budden]
Yo, niggas is letting birds turn the tables on they squad
You need help with a jump, got some cables in the car
Cause they all become nondescript
When something bright is on your wrist
Like you repping the Bionic Six
Who wan' fire? When guns fire, your lungs tire
I'm an idol, niggas is Sanjaya, now who wan' try us?
That .4-5'll spit, I'll slump you in the driver seat
And make you really ghost ride the whip
It's real talk, shade niggas couldn't get a tan from me
Cause I get in the ring for that Vince McMahon money
Soon as it's un-tuck, BLAM! Talking 'bout you tough scrams
I'm coming through your window, something like Bruh Man
It's just who we are, if I see y'all, it's ER
Vacay in D.R., shirt and jeans G-Star
Tell me how they gon' manage
Letting off Virginia TECs now, dudes ain't even safe on campus
Gotta spaz on cowards, every twenty-four, every half-hour
Niggas be tryna be Jack Bauer
So let fam' keep talking, and you gon' need a weekend at Bernie's
If you tryna see a dead man walking

[Verse 5: Red Cafe]
Yeah, I guess it's left to me, the popcorn slinger, to pop off nigga
Callouses on my pop finger pop off nigga
Pop through, throw the drop, kick the lock off dump
'Fore them bodies drop out, six Glocks in the trunk
Chef boy supplying, whip whop is drying
When they move that, more whip whop arriving
And my connect from Phoenix, the connect named Phoenix
Still keep the iron like my right hand anemic
For the Family, I'll be squeezing, no reason
Blood work, nobody leaving this bitch breathing
Niggas on the low kidnapped my flow
Coulda asked for it, I woulda gift wrapped my flow
Don't gotta ask for it, I'm gon' sit back the fo'
Flip it around, let the handle crack ya jaw
Eastside, Westside, I be in my Converse
This a convict rapping, It's a con's verse
Arm & Hammer mis-man, Los, Joey or Ris-am
All they gotta do is chirp and them things gon' blis-am
Shakedown fiz-am
Straight from the Brooklyn borough that never riz-an
Blocka blocka
[Verse 6: Fabolous]
Now if they get me on wire traces, I'ma die in Comstock
I got prior cases from riding with firearms cocked
Firebomb box set up by your mom's block
Go off on time 'cause it's wired by alarm clock
I get his legs, you grab him by his arms, ock
We gon' go this liar harm while his crying moms watch
Last seen in Brooklyn, they found 'em by a Bronx lot
Rifles from the roof, yeah we got him by a long shot
We don't fire warning shots, niggas fire on SWAT
And if they get me, Brooklyn gon' riot on spot
I'm from the hood, so I'm supplying bomb rock
'Round here, that's better than buying from Viacom stock
Look, you can't hold nothing but I got a shell to give
I'll make his relative show me where the fella live
Ain't that his baby sis'? Get up in this Mayby, miss
'Fore I pull this curtain, start squirting like baby piss
If he heard yet, bet that get the word buzzing
You send a message when you kill a nigga third cousin
Niece, nephew, they gon' need Tef' too
This'll a-go in and out they chest like a breath do
You Clay Aiken soft, you playing games 'til this red light's on ya
It's like the Playstation's off
Smith & Wesson work, Luger .9 labor
Professional shit like they did Leon's neighbors

[Outro: Fabolous]
This is Family nigga, do not cross the brothers
I'll put you in the box, one hand across the other
A small price to pay, son, it might cost your mother
One of your grandparents, even your baby brother
Cause everybody knows, everybody goes
I want 'em in coffins, everybody's closed
Related by the streets, this is Family beef
So you better not touch a branch on this Family tree, nigga"

She super fine she looking at me
With them light brown we in the back seat
Shawty body shaped like a figure eight
Yeah that pussy great
She bout to get ate

[Verse 1]
It was a Friday
I was on the highway
Riding to that Kanye
That's when I saw a bad bitch ridin right behind me
And I slowed down so she can be beside me
Like beep beep Shawty you sweet shawty Best pullover in me shawty
Gas station that's on me
And you know that ain't cheap shawty
You deserve 93 shawty
You deserve me shawty
So tell that other nigga
He can leave like a tree falling
And when it comes to love Baby I'm free falling
Did I leave my eyes In yo pussy cause I see me all in, it
And I put her to bed
And know she sleep walking
And she never answer her phone
Not even if E.T. calling
Man you should see darlin
She like a sea dolphin
Splash splash shout out bird gang
She balling
And I just try to be her
Tol ya somethin
Cop' her 20 hand bags
Out of coach or something
First class flight
Get her out of coach o something
How bout vacation
Round my by bon voyage
And With no snowtra something
Yeah
And tell yo man he don't
Owe me nothing
Tell him open his eyes I gotta show him something

I started riding
Like a dirty dozen

Have a feeling like she Oprah cousin haha
But fuck money
I give her mostly loving
Then I'm gone before it's sunny

[Verse 2]
It's next Friday
I'm on the high way
Ridin to that Sade`
I se a bad bitch up in a Hyundai
I said ""baby you supposed to be up in my place""
She started laughin
I got the joke late
Look I just want ta tie u down with this rope braid
Lil mama so cold
I call her Snowflake
I fuck her so good on that coldplay
Now what you kno bout it
What you know about it
It ain't what you know about it's how you go about it
An I go about it like I kno about it
Like I'm sho about it
Like I'm so about it
Baby I can take you
Farther than your fantasy
Maybe one day I can be the father of your family
I can handle all the extremities
She remember me ohww

Good Evening,Mac Miller,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Uh, look
Good evening
Yeah

[Verse 1]
When I party in New York, take the late night subway
Goin' out Friday to comin' home Monday
From all directions never find me on the one way flavor
The rhyme just the icin' on the cupcake fuck face
My fans notice these other rappers is bogus
I'm supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
And the boy stay, kickin' incredibly dope shit
Make my mama proud 'cause my clothes fit
Travel round the globe bitch, on my Lewis Clark shit
Don't matter where I live, 'cause I can tell you where my heart is
I just stay on my side, fuck where everybody at
Tell the planet, ""Peace"", 'cause I'm gone I ain't comin' back
Had the whole regular life I can tell you that I'm done with that
Try to build a mil' off a couple stacks
Own my own business, investin' all I got into these fuckin' raps
Willie Parker money, hand it off then it's runnin' back
[Interlude]
Ayo you fuck wit' dat
Uh you gotta fuck wit' dat
You in love wit' dat
Look, uh, Mac Miller

[Verse 2]
Takin' sips from the fountain of youth
If you ain't heard about the kid then you out of the loop
As I'm sittin' back starin' at this world in my eyes
See out the window in my room that I’m hidden inside
I'm just a kid who stays speakin' his thoughts, talkin' his mind
Life a roller coaster but I stay along for the ride
Put my heart up on the page, and the song gonna cry
There’s logic behind the way stayin' caught in a lie, boy
Ain't a shock that I'm a topic of discussion
Muhfuckers want my spot so they probably wish I wasn't
They give a little love like everyone does
In reality, they stoned off that competitive drug
And I don't blame 'em, 'cause those who above me, I'm gunnin' for
Try and make my way to the top, startin' from the floor
And I don't even need to bring a single gun to war
'Cause I be on some shit that they ain't never done before
Takin' over piece by piece, startin' from the core
It's only been a year, I can stick around a hundred more
[Interlude]
Said I could stick around a hundred more
I ain't goin' nowhere
Young and so much time to go
Jerm, you might as well keep this one rollin'
I got like one more verse I haven't spit three verses on a song in a minute
See if I can remember this one
Aight look

[Verse 3]
You can find me in the lab workin' overtime
Smell the weed when you going by, global grind
And I ain't just a local guy
When you feelin' stressed out, have an L
Blow money, keep my lady decked out in Chanel
Live fast when I die better wish me well
Huh, I just hope they servin' beer in hell
Just an everyday story that I'm here to tell
So please, stick around for the epilogue
For anyone who ever blog, probably heard my name
Hip-Hop's underdog, you wanna win the game
I'm sick of hearin' how music change never be the same
And these dudes who think they everything and never pick a lane
Call yourself a vet, but haven't won a single game
Mad, every girl got my name imprinted in her brain
Boy, I'm a beast, match the style in bars
Find me smokin' weed where the wild things are
[Outro]
Yessir
So I mean, I had to take this time
Real quickly, to just go in
I don't know man I feel like you should never stop goin' in on your shit
That's just me
I mean, Q and Treej out there we excited just makin' history
And Jerm of course"
Undying Love,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by L.E.S]

[Verse 1]
Uh...
Pacino life, G a roll, casino dice
At the Mirage, Vegas strip, neon lights
Gamblers, puffin' cigars, couples and stars
Flashin' cameras, dealers, shufflin' cards
Spent the weekend, already miss New York and it's odd
'Cause I'm the first to say it got too many hustlers who rob
I never hang out, when we do we bust the .45
'Cause shells comin' back at us while we jump in the ride
Flyin', duckin', our bitches in the club cluckin'
Tellin' my wife who I was dancin' with like I was fuckin'
Flew back, Monday evening from Nevada where the sun was beamin'
To the concrete jungle of cement
Limousine's from LaGuardia airport, sleepin'
Told my dogs peace, kept it movin', I was beat when
Got to my crib, where the hell my keys went?
Ringin' the bell, heard a yell but wasn't sure
Dropped my luggage to the ground, put my ear to the door
Slow music, H-Town, no that's down low
My baby's, drop Mercedes is parked, I creep around yo
To the back, she must be inside and can't hear
Probably upstairs, in the mirror, doin' her hair
I walked in through the back door entrance
Shocked it was unlocked, when I walked in, I smelled incense
Chased by a weed aroma, empty Guinnesses
And lipstick marks on like three empty Coronas
A pair of blue jeans on the carpet; size 12 Timberlands
Somethin' swingin' on the ceiling fan, I stopped it
Swingin' slower and slower
On the last swing I saw it was a G-string and heard laughter
Thought about my nine-side Glock but somethin' made me disregard it
Started my way up to where the noise and music was at
Froze, I couldn't react
Bedroom door opened a crack, seen wifey layin' with some nigga
Mumblin' shit, he had one hand on her ass
And she was rubbin' his dick, toastin' wine glasses
Cherry scented candles was lit, couldn't handle the shit
Searchin' for words I found none, without a sound
I left the house with a sick smile and took my gun
Now I'm out buggin', whylin', what I'm gon' do?
Call my man Horse, meet me outside, I'm comin' through
[Chorus]
I thought you loved me
I thought you cared for me
I thought you needed me
Did you believe in me?
I thought you loved me
I thought you cared for me
I thought you needed me
Did you believe in me?

[Verse 2]
Got up with Horse, showed a look on my face was mad lost
I ain't know whether to cry or just, try to laugh it off
""Son you home early -- they wiped you out that quick?""
I said, ""Nah,"" showed him the plastic with nine in the clip
Hopped in the whip, popped in the disc, pressed play
To the Grand Central, from the Van Wyck Expressway
I said, ""Bet you'll never guess in a million years
What I just saw happenin' -- and probably still is
Snuck in my crib - some nigga fuckin' my wiz
I saw dem, they ain't see me, I ducked and I slid
I'ma grab shorty, I need you to grab the nigga for me""
Just when I thought I found love, she shitted on me
Shopped in Vegas, a present, for our engagement
20 G's on a ring I would have hit her today with
My surprise couldn't match the one she had for me
We pulled up, he was walkin' out the house backwardly
Parked in the back of my house, they couldn't see us
Ran to the side of my house, cocked the heater
Walked to the front when I talked he had jumped
Bitch tried to slam the door shut, got caught in Horse foot
Shot the Spanish kid in the rib, drug him in
Grabbed her face, say goodbye to your undercover friend
One between the eye, she's died, by mistake
Must've held the gat too tight, pointed at her face
Heard somebody knock -- Horse helped me hide the bodies
Heard si-rens, I guess we goin' out like kamikaze
We surrounded, red lights flashin', who's inside?
Came out a bullhorn, I'm contemplatin' suicide
Horse asked me for the MAC, he gave me dap, one love
Cocked the strap, then he ran out the back
Mad shots couldn't tell what was goin' on
Sat on the floor near my dead girl, put her in my arms
Pulled her ring out my pocket I was savin'
Put it on her ring finger cocked the Glock, and started prayin'
To Muhammad and Allah, the most beneficial
Through you, all things are possible, I know you're listenin'
I never meant for this to happen, I never dreamed
This'd be my fate, such a grotesque, murder scene
On that note, same time, the cops busted in
Kissed my lady, her blood on my lips, I said ""Amen""
Put the nine to my head, pulled the hammer, held her close
Squeeze the toast, said to her, ""Now unto God, we elope""
.. we elope

Cocaine,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Eminem & Jazmine Sullivan]
Yeah
Ooh...
This game is like cocaine
I want this more than anything in the world
Haha... So do I... At least I thought I did
Got to have it, yeah I need it, I'm addicted, yeah I'm fading

[Verse 1: Eminem]
This is a beat with no words at first, it’s a blank painting
Exercising the mind, it’s brain strength training
It starts off something like, ""Shady's an insane maniac
Yeah, Slim Shady, that's a zany name, ain't it?""
Now all you need's an image to go with the name, baby
Wifebeaters and white t-shirts, Hanes mainly
It's a long shot, but is it possible? There's a lane, maybe
If not he's gon' have to come and change the whole game, ain't he?
He wants the fame so bad he can taste it, he can see his name up in lights
Women screaming his fucking name, fainting
Shady did it, he sold out the whole dang stadium
Joe Shmoe made it, he took his Plain Jane lady
And his baby Hailie out the trailer but he ain't trailing anymore
He's ahead of the race while maintaining his innocence
Little does he know his train is derailing
And he's about to be raped by this game anally, now
[Hook: Jazmine Sullivan]
What would you do for a little bit?
What would you give for a little bit of that c-o-c-a-i-n-e?
(Cause once you cave in, you don't want to leave)
I got to have it, yeah I made it, I'm addicted, yeah I'm fading
(Cause once you cave in, you don't want to leave)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You’re operating on all cylinders, syllables spit like dillingers
Spilling your guts, people are feeling your mic skills
But these haters are ice grilling ya
Willing to sacrifice anything for the life that they might steal from ya
Fake friends will kill for ya, die for ya but you can’t decipher
Why for the life of ya, it wasn’t like this when you were cyphering
Argue with your wife again, she found Vicodin
In your pants last night again, your dispute's public
Nothing is private anymore, oh, and your best friend?
Say bye-bye to him, what kind of apple you take a bite of, Slim?
(But this is what you wanted Marshall, ain't it?) Fuck no!
The way that it turned out was nothin' like the picture that I painted
In my head, sometimes a dream and making it's more fun
Than it's to actually make it, the game stripped me naked
It robbed me of ever having another real relationship
With another girl, this world is a fucking trip
As I slip in another world, proceed, take another hit
Sniff 'til I fucking hurl, tell 'em all to fucking sit
And spin 'til they fucking twirl, middle finger up again
Relapsing back in this game, oh well, fuck it then, now
[Hook: Jazmine Sullivan]
What would you do for a little bit?
What would you give for a little bit of that c-o-c-a-i-n-e?
(Cause once you cave in, you don't want to leave)
I got to have it, yeah I made it, I'm addicted, yeah I'm fading
(Cause once you cave in, you don't want to leave)

[Bridge: Jazmine Sullivan]
You start off bright, just to see your name in lights
Just so you can live the life
You take a bite and lose your sight, they call this (fame)
You think you're good, just cause you got out the hood
Concerned only with getting dough, no longer poor
But lost your soul, they call it (fame)
I hear it callin', my name is callin'
Why you struggling when you could be ballin'?
My head is saying yes but my feet is stallin'
So many walkin' by the end they fallin'
But I got to have it, like Eve and the apple
She had to grab it, I got to take it, I got to make it
That's the plan and I can't forsake it, yee-yeah

[Hook: Jazmine Sullivan]
What would you do for a little bit?
What would you give for a little bit of that c-o-c-a-i-n-e?
(Cause once you cave in, you don't want to leave)
I got to have it, yeah I made it, I'm addicted, yeah I'm fading

Like it's actually crazy
Know what I mean? Yeah

Seems like I always had crushes on chicks I couldn't have
And then I end up fuckin' with someone I shouldn't have
See, in my mind, it's like I'm perfect for her, I gotta show her
But sadly, in reality, dog, I don't even know her
But still somehow she got my mind infatuated
Absolutely fascinated
With the thoughts of what she might be like
Time after time after time I had to wait and
Is fate procrastinatin'?
I can take it 'cause I might be right, 'cause it's…

Aye, tell me, is it stalkin' if I follow her
Like, all the way home without her knowin'?
Nah, nigga, I'm just curious where she stay at
Besides, when I'm with her, this gon' be the spot we lay at
And maybe I'll just drive by occassionally
And if one day I happen to see her outside, she'll wave at me
Imagine what she'll say to me
This ain't no time to be afraid no more, it's time for bravery
No matter if my homies think I'm crazy

Okay, it's time to grow some balls if she really gon' be yours
Oh my God, I'm walkin' towards her
My mind's screamin' stop
But my legs keep walkin' forward
Straighten up your face, nigga, she see you comin' for her!

But in the city I done met a lot of women, but
You from my dreams
And will you come true?
I know about a show that we can catch
Some R&B and rap, and you should come through.""
She said, ""Uh, I'd love too
Except I don't like rap
Besides, if I went with you, then I don't really think my man would like that."" (Damn, Damn)
Okay, you say you got a man
I mean, I definitely understand
I'm happy for you, really am
I couldn't have been the only fan
In the world of a girl like you
I mean, you're beautiful, and I'm sure he's a very nice dude
It ain't no biggie
Well, I'm sure that I'm gon' see you 'round the city
Only thing I ask, if shit don't work out for y'all

So I find out the nigga name
Know exactly where he stayin'
Find out when he leave for work
""Hold up, nigga, is you sane?""
I'ma follow in my car; I'ma cut in front of his
Run him right into the wall
Maybe even off the bridge
I give her a little time
Then console her while she cryin'
She gon' take that as a sign
Finally she will be mine
I'll be king, and she'll be queen
When I hit her with the ring
At the wedding, who gon' sing?

Wanna be, wanna see, wan' get a shovel
Dig Tookie up nigga, cause he know gangstas

[Chorus: Shorty of Da Lench Mob]
Raised in the City of Angels
Where safe and danger switch lanes so stranger drive slow (drive slow)
Where bangers and gangstas fast women and dank
Are just part of a face that we show
We got mountains and ocean, we move in slow motion
Off that sticky you all love to blow
I swear, ain't nothin better there
That's why we all take our hats off to you, for one more

[Outro: The Game]
Y'all niggas got this L.A. shit real fucked up man
Niggas better start respectin what the fuck we about man
We take niggas the fuck out, this shit ain't no movie dawg
This shit is real - Crips, Bloods, Ese's
We hold shit down, this L.A
That's why I wrote the shit on my face, put a muh'fuckin' star behind it
What the fuck I am, Star-face
L.A. Chronicles, L.A.X. Files
Case closed"
Niggaz My Height Dont Fight,Eazy-E,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
""Gimmie this, gimmie that, gimmie this, gimmie that
Bitch, step back and stop tryna jack.""
""But mister dopeman, dopeman, can I get a hit?""
""No, ho, but you can get my duck sick.""

[Verse 1]
But let me finish my story as I was sayin'
I told you lil locs ain't playin'
Gotta roll with the punches
Can't help the travellin' bunches
Now, ain't that somethin'
Just in case a few niggas try to trip
Bone-out, put on my ski-mask and come back blastin'
Cause niggas my height don't fight
My name is Eazy-E, you're motherfuckin' right
They must to thought I was a buster
You're wearin' your bullet-proof vest
So what's next?
I got my nine filled up with teflon
And don't let me hit the wet bomb
So what ya wanna do?
The red, white and blue
I got some for you, too
Cause it gonna be on when I'm kickin' down doors
So say hello to my new 44
[Chorus]
I'm the type of nigga
That smokes motherfuckers
I'm the type of nigga
That smokes motherfuckers
I don't give a fuck, fuck
Smoke motherfuckers
I'ma smoke motherfuckers
'Cause I'm the ""E""

[Verse 2]
So you can kiss my black ass
Fuck the White House, it ain't my house
So you can burn the motherfuckers down for all I care
Cause t-shirts and khakis is all I wear
I'm from the city where they show no pity for a punk ass mark in the park
Blow his brains out, stuff him in the bushes
Take his gat, leave his ass for the rats
And if he hit that Cisco
I got a 187 on my pistol
Wanted by the L.A.P.D.K
For puttin' in work out my tray
Because the president never sent
One damn dime to my residence
I'm goin' crazy like 1980
I need my ends, fuck you, pay me
Or I'ma have to get the strap
My Nutty O.G. buddy Big Black
I make you shit in your pants and shake like Jell-O
So tell all my homies said hello
[Chorus]
[I'm the type of nigga
That smokes motherfuckers
I'm the type of nigga
That smokes motherfuckers
I don't give a fuck, fuck
Smoke motherfuckers
I'ma smoke motherfuckers
'Cause I'm the ""E""](13353420)

[Verse 3]
You can't check a checker
But when you wanna try let me know
I got the stretcher on stand-by
Starvin' for a nigga like you
That thinks his heart is much bigger than a trigger
So I can show how to put in work:
The Ruthless network drive-by experts
Straight outta Compton, kickin' up dust
The place where guns don't get a chance to rust
I warned them and they still approached me
Now I got two more golf-hats for my trophy
I got a brand new trend, it's killin' men
Who is that? That's my little friend

[Outro]
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
Smoke motherfuckers like it ain't no thang"
I Get Up,J. Cole,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by J. Cole]

[Verse 1]
I woke up early in the morning, hoes blowing up my phone
I ain't used to small talking when they know I'm tryna bone
Fuck 'em, I'll holla later, man, right now, my mind's elsewhere
My mom's healthcare, get her out this hell here
A lot of niggas fail, frail niggas won't prevail here
We seen it all man, niggas can't even spell scared
A Fresh Prince, but yo my city ain't no Bel-Air
Fuck if you would sell, I'm worry bout my welfares
So farewell to them broke days and bonjour to the most paid
Soon as my dough straight, I throw the wifey in some Dolce
And put some chains on my niggas like I own slaves
I get up, look out the window, hope the sun shining
Down on my niggas out there front lining
I hit the streets and see them boys out there locking up some older head
So Goddamn homie, hold your head, and hold your head

[Hook]
I get up, I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma, your son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl, I'ma make to the end though
And to the top I'ma climb my way
And tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my—headed for the sky
I'm on my way
[Verse 2]
Paint a picture to show the deaf what it's like to listen
And speak the words and tell a blind man what he missin'
For all my niggas doin' time man up in prison
Felt you had to resort to crime, man fuck the system
We raisin' babies up in Hades where there ain't no hope
Ain't no fathers, don't take no scholarship to slang no dope
Politicians hollerin' bout problems but I ain't gon' vote
He talk about change, still we floatin' in the same ol' boat
So tell me how I'm supposed to feel when the President spoke
When he ain't never had to struggle, ain't never been broke
Ain't even roll through the ghetto ain't neva been close
Trustin' this government's like trustin' the devil in oath
For rebel with quotes, I get up
Lifestyle of the young, black and reckless
A generation of niggas strapped and askin' questions like:
""Tell me why I ain't got shit?""
I let this liquor fill my liver with them toxics as I sip

[Hook]
I get up, I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma, your son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl, I'ma make to the end though
And to the top I'ma climb my way
And tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my—headed for the sky
I'm on my way
[Verse 3]
Yeah, to all my niggas paper chasin', I pray for your patience
Just keep the faith that you gon' make it one day you'll be cakin'
Takin this shit one step at a time, that real shit is stuck on my mind
But to that bullshit I'm deaf and I'm blind
Destined to shine I'ma find a way, 'cause hey
Damn it, them jobs out there ain't tryna pay, I pray
Granted nine to five is how you survive
I ain't tryna survive, I'm tryna throw my Momma in rides
I'mma provide for my seed I'm the soil
I'll teach 'em bout' loyalty
I'll teach 'em that his skin black like oil that's for royalty
I'll show 'em all the things that my pops was never showin' me
Treat 'em like a growin' tree with this poetry
I get up and show the sons how to lead not to follow
The present is our gift but our seed's got tomorrow
So please niggas raise your kids
And help em' overcome that bull shit they daze us with
I blaze the shit

[Hook]
I get up, I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma, your son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl, I'ma make to the end though
And to the top I'ma climb my way
And tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my—headed for the sky
I'm on my way
I get up, I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow

Frum Da Tip Of My Tung,Twista,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Introduction: Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Droppin' a flow like this be breakin' the suckers
And rippin' the rhythm and showin' I'm bringin' the feel of my tongue
And be makin' 'em manifest that I be rockin' the young
Flowin' this style I be singin' and bringin'
It's breakin' the people and go in the mind of a teen
Be makin' 'em hear it and manifest up in him that I'm a star to become
Quick the lyrical style I'mma kick
You better catch the rhythm of it
'Cause hip-hop is becomin' complicated, never be left hung
Bringin' a style like this kinda quick and crisp
A lyrical twist be comin from Chi-Town
I know that hip-hoppers all over will be stung

[Chorus]
How was the rhyme brung?
Frum the tip of my tung (x7)
How was the rhyme brung?
Frum among the tip of my tung
[Verse 2]
Rock the style of my second verse like that of my first
Be showin' the hip-hop hypes my types of flowin', but not the best of T
From an imagination this was took, a mental crook
Stirring this up like a chef or cook
I hear them say give me the recipe
Breakin' this off in the fashion of an erection of an adventurous style
That I'mma use to just confuse and smart people then go dumb
You say me style be wack 'cause y'all can't manifest what I be sayin'
Think I'm a lyrical midget, watch me then say fee-fi-fo-fum
Flowin' this like a veteran that I'm incredible is what they be stung by
When I'mma give in a flow of the funk I erect like a wee-wee
Then see me gee, we be DJ Jihad and T.T
Steppin' and then I'mma find a lyrical line that'll flow from me like peepee
Rockin' and me stylin', rockin' and me stylin', wildin'
Them say me tracks be wack, I just sip them like them coco
Loco, a lyrical thing I sling and cling like Sing-Sing, merciless like Ming
Watch me come and stiff in 'em like a photo
Funky, funky, funky stylin', wildin'
I'mma drop in a flow that breaks and takes a lyrical wiz to wax a funky scholar
Flowin' a hyper type of song that I sung from the lung
Breakin' 'em up in a snap, I think that I better thank Allah

[Chorus]
How was the rhyme brung?
Frum the tip of my tung (x7)
How was the rhyme brung?
Frum among the tip of my tung
[Verse 3]
Face the lyrical rhythm of this lick
I throw in a blister of a body
Breaking 'em up so quick that I can even bruise hair
Rhythm will rock blocks and funky track drops
Don't wanna come in the door but when you're hearing
Do I hear a ""knock-knock who's there""?
Twista breaking 'em off in a magical rhythmous manifestation
Of a lyrical racing chasing suckers that my funky rhythm elects
Wrote this, quote this, notice how I wreck
My funky hocus pocus broke his neck

[Chorus]
How was the rhyme brung?
Frum the tip of my tung (x7)
How was the rhyme brung?
Frum among the tip of my tung

Give him a chance to spit his last word, unerve
Then he done
20/20 ain't good enough
Rappers they ain't seein' me, this Jay-O Felony
And nobody can stand three of me
Caution keep MC's out of my reach, I'm on a mission

That they bore me and I woke up too late this morning
Or too early...wait a minute there goes Shirley
The girly I fucked last year when her hair was curly
Couldn't remember it cuz I was Infinite
And I met Ken Kaniff in Connecticut
He said his predicates and pronouns and wanted to throw down
And he said “I like you”...and then he walked up and said “Let me snake bite you”
And I said hell no...kicked him with my shell toe
Gave him a elbow...Ayo Proof ...go

Girls wanna blow us like Monica....Lewinsky

[Eminem]
Go and see I'm an invincible MC
If you dont believe it then you wanna try to convince me
That you're doper than me...which we'll hope
You would hope to be....but hopefully I will rock globaly
And nationwide...thats why my ass is wide
Thats why your ass just died on the passenger side
Like a fuckin ride...when it got shot up by a drive-by
When I drove by 5 times and gave it five tries
And still missed it
I got a fuckin' mental illness a gentle stillness
Violence...complete silence is what I need in the room while I freestyle
What I need is to do...what is need is smoke weed and brew
And......smoke brew ? You don't smoke brew
If you do I'll choke you and then I guarantee I'll out smoke you
You're crew's a joke too and I can stick my dick in a bitch and poke you

The rhyme that I dropped is stickin up IHOP
In high tops and walking around like a one-eyed Cyclops
And you can't see me....I only got one eye and I can still see you

And I already said that but I dont know where my head's at
All I wanna do is go back to the hotel and know where my bed's at

Yo wheres the beds at so we can relax and catch Ease

Dont Push Me,50 Cent,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Eminem]

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I need you to pray for me and
I need you to care for me and
I need you to want me to win
I need to know where I'm heading 'cause I know where I've been
The flow is bone crushing, it's nothing, I come up with something
Come through your strip fronting, stunting
It's something you want, 745 chrome spinners
Haters hate that I'm winning
Man, I've been hot from the beginning
Motherfuckers envy the kid, control your jealousy
'Cause I can't control my temper, I'm finna catch a felony
Pistol in hand, homie, I'm down to get it popping
Once I squeeze the first shot you know I ain't stopping
'Til my clip is empty, I'm simply
Not that nigga you should try your luck with or fuck with
Hollow-tip shells struck you with your bones broken, guns smoking, still locing
What nigga, lay your ass down, paramedics get you up feeling
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
I done lost my bigger nigga and I didn't cry
Too young to understand the consequences of a man
Living a lie, I gotta get that money
I'll be damned if I'm bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas cause they funny
20 years of watching my mama tears got me heated, heavily weeded
Smoking that bong cause I need it
These niggas don't want me balling, they want me buried
Bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
Cause I'm a stunner, I sit back and wonder
When them angels gonna call my number
Under my chest is a heart of a lion
I ain't lying, bounty hunters got me flying
With my iron, high as a giant
I'm running from nothing, my stomach is touching what I'm clutching
To give you more than a concussion, end of discussion
My blood is colder so I'm bolder
Hennessy and soda, hood on my shoulder
Look in the mirror, I see a soldier
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy

[Verse 3: Eminem]
These are my ideas, this is my sweat and tears
This is shit that I saw with my eyeballs, my ears
This is me, who's gotta be what you see on TV
What you hear on CD, what appears easy
Man these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags living fantasies
Fronting like it's all fun and games 'til they shoot 'em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playing
Ain't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying
I bullied my way in this game, man, I'm done playing
Man, I'm done saying that I'm done playing
I'ma start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers
There's no way I'ma back down like a god damn coward
I can't, how would I look as a man bowing to his knees?
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, whoa, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall? I'll show you martial
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start, showing you fucking old farts
A whole 'nother side I wanted to not show you
So you know you're not dealing with some fucking marshmallow
Little soft yellow, punk pussy, whose heart's Jell-O 'cause
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy

Shady Aftermath, nigga, G-Unit
Rap juggernauts of this shit, we taking over"
Once Upon a Time,T.I.,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Once upon a time in the apartments, aye
I damn near had to smoke a J
He knocked on the door, what's haapnin'
Its Jimmy Jam trying to score a little packet frame?

I said the work that we was cooking wasn't dry yet
But he could have the residue from the Pyrex
He say, he had some niggas with him worth a hundred plus
But the niggas up the street was servin' touch and bust

I told him ""Wait a minute it was all good""
That when I seen a nigga hoppin' out the Fleetwood
With gold teeth talking about he want a whole ki'
Right then I'm thinking: ""do this motherfucker know me?""

He was with a nigga who wouldn't even buy an oz
That's when I said he's either robbing or the police
Either way I slammed the door in his face
Started gathering and collecting all the blow in the place

Went and got the dough out of the safe and .44 and a K
Whatever he is trying I ain't tripping cause we know where he stays
About 150 grand, three birds in a knapsack
Stashed it in my neighbor's trash then I ran back
I had to keep the tool just in case though
If these niggas make a move you already know
With the Desert Eagle in my waistband
I slung the front door open and hollered ""Jimmy Jam!

""What's up with that nigga that you roll with?
In the fake chains and the flea market outfit.""
He said ""Now Tip you know I wouldn't try you.""
I said ""Cause if you do he gets killed and you die, too.""

He said ""He ain't like that he used to sell weight
Started smoking he embarrassed now he's trying to save face""
The conversation was interrupted again
When this country nigga pulled 'bout twenty bands out of his pants

He said ""I'm in the right place, this enough, ain't it?""
I said ""Hell yeah, if you trying to donate it
Shit that get you locked up, I don't sell blow.""
Then he said ""I heard you had it?""
I said ""Yeah, so?""

I guess that nigga Boogie from a couple doors down saw his money
Run up said ""I got it for the low now.""
I'm thinking: ""Boogie stupid he don't even know brah
He just always wants to take a nigga's customa.""
This one he could have
I said ""I guess that's your man, then.""
I was smoking laughing at his ass
When they ran in

They said Boogie had a quarter mil, over twenty bricks
Shit all I know is I ain't seen that nigga since
Keep yo' head on the swivel for the nonsense
Everyday is something when you're trapping in apartments"

Swing it back, bring it back, just like this
And if you with my shit, then blaze up another spliff
And keep the motherfuckin' blunt in your pocket, loc
'Cause Doggy Dogg is all about the zig zag smoke
See it's a West coast thing, where I'm from
And if you want some, get some, bad enough, take some
But watch the gun by my side
Because it represents me and the motherfuckin' East Side

Niggas ain't listenin', stuck in positions if victims can't stand the heat, then stay the fuck out the kitchen
Half these busters switchin', lookin' at me mean, itchin'
Givin' suckers plenty space, have these bitch niggas snitchin'
Where are we now, guns found daily
The Feds trail me in hoax that they could finally nail me
For sellin' dope, they backwards make the track burst
Whenever I rap, attack
Words been known to explode on contact
Extreme at times, blinded by my passion and fury
Look at me laugh at my competition's flashin' my jewelry
You'd stay silent if you niggas knew me, truly effective
The shit you heard ain't do me justice, got a death wish, bitch
Run, but face being traced, by the infrared beam
It seems niggas ain't recognize my team
Ain't nobody holdin' you back
Explode the track to confetti
Unload it, 'cause niggas ain't ready
The life of an outlaw

Indeed a possibility that's part of chasin' cream

Don't look now! How you like it, raw?
Niggas ain't ready for the wrath of the Outlawz
Never surrender, death before dishonor, stay free

No halfs with no straps, jack, it's on to bounce back

Tell the gripper I was sent to get ya, snip with clippers
Get the picture, I wrote my life down as a scripture

But the evil it's forever

Attach a strap under my pillow, hand to hand like we freakin'

And let my clout speak for itself
No doubt, outlaw, outta my mind outta time you're all blind

Finally I'll adapt to it, over the years as an outlaw

Twenty karats on my wrist, that's a fucking lick

Ice on my hand, 50 G's

Six rings, ten bitches, and I got the power

You try to fuck me over, you better watch your asses
Glock 9, red beam in between your glasses
Bitch, I'm sexy as I wanna be
Suck my dick cause I'm rich and it's boss status

Emcees are scared so prepare for Rap Tyranny
There's no comparin' me
Most men?
Fearin' me
(Broke no it's a rarity???)
Mics I hold dear to me
Cool and sincere one
People wanna hear from
Words penetrate eardrums like spearguns
Run home
Unknown places I appear from
It ain't none of that jumpin' off over here son
I clocked you
Beat you
Had to stop you
Greet you
I write rhymes in Hebrew, Arabic and Greek too
I get so high, the slightest drop is lethal
Like the South American city of Macchu Picchu
Ladies say I do my thing with a passion
Brother like the way I swing into action
When I'm not coolin' in the crib, just relaxin'
I'm out in the streets with the Red Army faction
I specialize In microphone vandalism
Surround sound, or better yet panoramic vision
People of Earth know and understand the wisdom from
Monotheism to third-world animism
I get the best of men as the record spins
I stretch my limbs and rhyme till the session ends
No matter if, we enemies or the best of friends
Against the Emp you can never expect to win...
(chorus)

Subjects and predicates
Proper mic etiquette
All beef, I'm deadin' it
Hip-Hop confederate
Face me, you better get
High priests and Jesuits
Against the Emp your attempts will seem effortless
I make the girls wanna kick their heels up
Klingon warships throw their shields up
Rippin' the reels up
Wounds never heal up
Mad Soul controls the razor-sharp steel cuts
High Tech or digital
Audio or Visual
Man or Machine can't defeat the Aboriginal
Rippin' through
My words are poisonous and medicinal
With the power to heal and at the same time, cripple you
You don't get a chance to rhyme
This is battle time
Even the violent get silent like a pantomime
The nicest point guard couldn't even handle mine
With more magical music than Rogers and Hammerstein
I made it to the top with a crew of born losers
They told me the game was locked till I tore through it
I get more props than a movie by George Lucas
In two-thou look out for the Storm Troopers
Don't sweat mine
Learn to respect mine
I bring womb to the REC Room when it's rep time
Blast like nine shots
Travel like TimeCops
Aiyyo Mad Soul, this is where the rhyme stops.."
The Conceited Bastard,Skillz,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Uh, what what? Supafriendz, uh, uh

Straight up and down, ain't no comparing me, see
Cause I got some shit that'll put y'all motherfuckers
Back in freestyle therapy, B
I make rappers fall like when school starts, like cheap tissue
When you're next to my shit you're getting ripped apart
Dissing wack niggas without rehearsal
No matter what I say somebody gonna take it personal, so fuck it
Your man put down the cheddar, nigga we get the pay-oh
I make sure you lose a friend for life and be looking for a way home
Get dropped on your rap block without leaving a spot
Separate you from the jock, I got plans to make you hot
Watch an MC and you rot, nigga these flows is crisp
When a mic in my hand bitches is supposed to be like this
There's mad niggas that wanna see Mad Skillz slip
Yeah you gonna see me slip, past your ass with your bitch in my whip
Get a grip, whoever got the itch then I got the scratch
MC's wanna get gassed, I feed their ass a lit match
All these jealous-ass niggas acting sheisty
Better tongue kiss Magic Johnson before they tell me I'm nice
But that's aiight, Northside E, conceited times three
Come through your town on skis, subtracting MC's
Word to Battle be in Lonnie's last name
Approach me, all you getting that
Plus you getting blown out the fucking frame
Who the nigga that got a big head when he on the mic, pa?
Ask a question, answer me (Bastard, you are)
Who the MC that grab the mic and start busting rappers' asses?
(You are you conceited bastard)
Who be burning beats down leaving you with straight ashes?

Man these fools, they slower than retarded molasass, who the nicest?
(You are you conceited bastard)

Ayo, these little niggas in the rap game, they straight lame
Had diss you in a rhyme, but these niggas be scared to say your name
If a nigga say mine, he getting bagged, kid, I'm a be in the
Studio whipping his ass before he can finish his fucking ad-libs
Taking me out? Stop hoping
Niggas always say they gonna do it, it never get done, it's like voting
I get it open, rhymes tying into name
Simple and plain, I pull rhymes, one ring and one chain
I give a fuck about fame, press your luck and quit
Mic-wise you realize I ain't that nigga you wanna fuck with
I'm nice as a bitch with the rhyme, if a nigga say I'm wack
He don't know his name, can't walk a straight line
Pissy drunk, screaming like Onyx
Forgot his social security number, damn near drowning in his own vomit
I kill logic, test me friend, you'll be in a club with your clothes
On backwards hollaring at a well-known lesbian
Half of y'all niggas got wack raps and wack tracks
Talking about you representing, putting your town on the map
Still, your mother heard your tape and wanted to shoot you
And niggas around this bitch wonder why we call ourselves ""Super?""
Your flows get you free lunch, mine get dough and cash
You shouldn't like that your ho got my logo tatooed on her fucking ass
I do all y'all playa haters, believe me
You trying to end your career before this shit even start, come see me

We Hate Money,Spose,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","(Intro) Money, Mother Fucking money

(Chorus)
We hate money, Broke people stand up
If you lack cash put your hand up
We hate money, and all the people getting paid
Throw all your money on stage
We hate money, dollars, cash, cheese
Unless your gonna give some to me
We hate money, and everyone who has it
We would do things that you couldn't imagine

(Verse 1)
If I ever had money, I would do some crazy shit
I'd probably hire lady gaga to babysit
So give me money, and I'll be like fuck it
I'd drop a hundred grand to make a vegan man eat Turducken
You know I wouldn't hold off, I would spend my figures
I'd get a nose job, make it even bigger
Set my Nissan on fire on the lawn
Then I'd buy my own plane, step on and yell bomb
And as my ego and my pockets swell
I'd fly to the next town to go to taco bell
Then I'd pay all the haters to become believers
I'd pay Kanye West to punch Justin Bieber
And then I'd buy a bunch of heroin and get really arrogant
And pay all the foreigners to become Americans
The possibilities are endless
I would even go to the dentist but

We hate money, Broke people stand up
If you lack cash put your hand up
We hate money, and all the people getting paid
Throw all your money on stage

Unless your gonna give some to me
We hate money, and everyone who has it
We would do things that you couldn't imagine

We've got trash on the porch, We've never owned a Porsche
We only wear neckties to wedding and to court
Our pay gets docked like it's coming into port
So we keep cigars split up like they're getting a divorce
Employees all annoyed, checks all void
Eminem's the only one still employed in Detroit
Bobzins and jobs from Nevada to Dakotas
And we're not Japanese but we're broke as Toyotas
Broseph, I know you is fire and demoted
Drinking tap water because they can't afford sodas
Struggling, covering shifts, just to buy christmas gifts
Before Tiger had mistresses
We're at Walmart, we hate Wallstreet
As far as being in depth, we are balls deep
Collecters call me, fucking all week
But I send that shit straight to voicemail because
(Chorus)
We hate money, Broke people stand up
If you lack cash put your hand up
We hate money, and all the people getting paid
Throw all your money on stage
We hate money, dollars, cash, cheese
Unless your gonna give some to me
We hate money, and everyone who has it
We would do things that you couldn't imagine

(Verse 3)
They told us, go to college expand our domes
Now we're jobless with $60,000 loans
And the bank accounts minus, surviving debt
While CEO's fly by in private jets
So, let me see your lighters, the funds couldn't be tighter
And you call orderves, appetizers
If your whole predicaments vile, but your still trying to smile
With the bills piled for miles and miles
Problems we've got 98 plus one
No trust funds, if the cops come we must run
I do it for my belt buckle, black lung, white knuckle
Blue color, cold hearted slave to the dollars that we hate

(Chorus)
We hate money, Broke people stand up
If you lack cash put your hand up
We hate money, and all the people getting paid
Throw all your money on stage
We hate money, dollars, cash, cheese
Unless your gonna give some to me
We hate money, and everyone who has it
We would do things that you couldn't imagine
We hate money, so broke people stand up
If you lack cash keep your hands up
We hate money, and all the people getting paid
You can all go away
We hate money (and) dollars (and) cash (and) cheese (and)
Unless your gonna give some to me
We hate money, and everyone who has it
We would do things that you couldn't imagine

There ain’t a shell left in my heat
Y’all niggas better lay down, yeah, I mean stay down
You get hit with AK round, your ass ain’t gon’ make it
You niggas will get laid out, your blood and your brains out
Have you on the concrete shivering and shaking
I’m from Southside motherfucker, where them gats explode
If you feel like you’re on fire, boy drop and roll
Niggas will eat your ass up, cause they heart turned cold
Now you can be a victim or you can lock and load

Gimme a second I’mma holla, I’mma see whassup
I got my razor in my hand, got my pistol in the trunk
Carve your ass up nice you play me like a punk

When the D’s come they fold, on my first case they told
Where I’m from it ain’t safe to have more than a eighth

Tell you open the safe, as your heart start to race
Cause a robbery could turn into a homo’ case
Co-operate, or Doc’ll have to operate
Niggas I’ll pop you, run a light then pop at Jake
Trust me son, niggas’ll go hard for that cake
These thirsty niggas are lurking, you’ll have to catch ’em and merk ’em
I’m observant in my hood, cause niggas be dumbing
Shots forfeit the dice game, all you see is the running
They make it harder and harder to pump on the block
I’m a hustler, how the fuck I’m ’sposed to eat when it’s hot?

You see I'm a psycho (a psycho), a sicko (a sicko)

Locked up (locked up), then cage me (cage me)
I'll come back bigger (bigger)
Stronger (stronger) and angry (and angry)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Man, these are average raps, I'm keeping the savage batch hid
In the can of whoop ass with the Shady/Aftermath lid
You pop off the top, it's like opening vats of acid
Beat the Octomom to death with a Cabbage Patch Kid
Attack a snatch, yeah, there's something to jack a batch in
Impregnated then shoot up the embryo sac with MAC-10s
Triplets, quadruplets, and a couple of back-to-back twins
Dead fetus is falling out all over, Jack is back again
The Ripper's at your service, girl, I can see that you're nervous
But I barely scratched the surface like my last batch of girlfriends
That I buried in my fucking backyard, still trying to dig their way out
I foam like an attack dog, how late you wanna stay out?
It's past your curfew when it's dark, I'm searching for you in the park
Shady murdered him another virgin, he just hit his mark
He met his quota for the month, they found Dakota all rolled up
Inside a bag, he probably dragged the body for about a block
Disappeared without a trace, no DNA, no not a drop
'Cause me and Dre and 50 we will never get caught by the cops
CSI, they hate us, but they gotta give a lot of props
If drama pops, grab the butcher knife from off the counter tops

You see I'm a psycho (a psycho), a sicko (a sicko)

Stronger (stronger) and angry (and angry)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yeah, I'm as ill as can be
My appeal is to serial killers what a pill is to me
Killing so villainously
Still as maniacal on the NyQuil and psycho as Michael Myers
You know what we're like on the motherfucking mic so try us
And you're gonna find out what the fuck we're like with pliers

[50 Cent]
It's operation time, they got him hooked up to wires
Squeezing, be bleeding, wheezing, breathing, he half dead
He must ain't know, but now we know how Shady the Math is
Even murderous tactics get better with practice
Lead showers, gun powder, feel the talons burn burn
School of arts, Julliard, you better learn learn
[Eminem]
Chris Reeves in his grave, yeah, homie, turn turn
I'm debating mutilating the lady
You've been waiting for Shady and Fif, ain't no duplicating it, baby
There's a baby in the dryer, there's a torso in the washer
I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her
Arms and legs in the garbage, 'cause the rest of her - I lost her
Her head is in the disposal with Jessica's, I squashed her
And put her through the wringer and hung her over the wash tub

[50 Cent]
When I'm through with Ricky it'll be blood that he'll cough up
The hard rock I'll soft up, get caught up and get washed up
In Detroit or Norfolk, witness this shit, end up nauseous
Look deep in my eye, see many many men die
I swing gem stars faster than a Samurai

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You see I'm a psycho (a psycho), a sicko (a sicko)

Falling Awake,XV,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Omen]

[Verse One: XV]
Didn’t go to college, my mama gave me the saddest look
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle backpack with a rabbit foot
Never wanna grow up, still fighting with Captain Hook
Everyone confessing with questions about the path I took
I laid down and never woke up it seems
Never opened my eyes, I just opened my dreams
Then I opened the curtain, but I closed out the scene
Of my son with a dad and my girl with a ring
‘Cause now I’m up on stage and I hear all the screams
And the girls backstage are down to do anything
So sometimes I slip off like shoes without strings
And that OJ’s love train is losing its steam
My son wants to stay up, my girl wants to lay up
My mom wants to talk, my agent wants his pay cut
A dream becomes a nightmare, my buzz takes a light-year
And all the while right there, my girl’s telling me to wake up
If that’s the real life then all of this is fake
The dream that you’re living is too much for me to take
It all becomes real in that bed that I made
So every time I lay down, I fall awake
[Hook]
And it’s not what it seems
I don’t wanna sleep if you’re not in my dreams, I fall awake
I wake up dreaming, I fall awake
I make believe what they believe I make
Success is close but far away so I wake up dreaming, I fall awake
And it’s not what it seems
I don’t wanna sleep if you’re not in my dreams, I fall awake

[Verse 2: XV]
I used to dream about my grandmother daily
And then my dreams is real life but I ain’t seen her lately
Comic stores open and I wait for her to take me
I can scream at the top of my lungs like Mr. Spacely
I writing, fighting these tears for fears
Fighting the hears and cheers like in the battles between titans
And I just want a quiet place to Brighton
My crippled reality has un-tightened and my dream world is heightened
‘Cause that’s the only place where my love once stayed
Not in the ground, decay, the love don’t fade
It all becomes real in that bed that I made
So every time I lay down, I fall awake

Lift The Game,XV,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: XV]
Yeah, curtain close, throw your rose
The night is early, let's make a toast
The sales figures bring smiles to well wishers
Bring frowns to frail niggas, the town is there with ya
The city say remember when radio ain't give Vizzy play?
Now they read the shit I say like I was Earnest Hemingway
Funny how the square that could never really fit it
Got so many people riding, I don't know if they'll all fit in
They tell me move to New York like it's so fatal
Keep your plane ticket, I brought tow cables
I'm so able to prove 'em wrong motherfucker
Cause the kid from Smallville going show all how I'm gonna go and…

[Hook]
Lift this game up and bring it back to where I fucking live
I'mma lift this game up and bring it back to where I fucking live
Cause I'mma be the one that put us on motherfucker
Now get out the park and bring this shit home motherfucker
We on yeah, tell my city we on-we on
[Verse 2: XV]
So I'm banging on a trashcan, drumming on a street light
'Bout time I left here, everything don't seem right
Rocket packs are fully charged, the moon and stars that would be ours
Home is where you find your heart and at this point, I'm up on Mars
Look where we were raised, look what mom was paid
Look at what they gave us and look at what we made
So when it comes to grind, you can't tell me a fucking thing
When I've been making my whole city wait for the day that Imma…

[Hook]

[Verse 3: XV]
No acceptance speeches, I don't really need it
Cause I've never been accepted by the people who seek it
We try to make history with hopes we get to see
The faces of the ones we knew in school that used to teach it
Goodbye to nine-to-fives, hello 24/7's
In your first 15 minutes, you can not waste a second
I came to make my presence, I'm a real rapper
The story of your life, to me it’s just a little chapter
This for the masses who cut classes
Not to sit on their asses but do our homework so we pass it
Kids go to school through more seasons than M*A*S*H did
We just wanna get there, pick the road that's the fastest
We shoot rockets, plug sockets with foreign objects
Go this-a-way and don't participate in trend and topics
It seems like being outside us was our only choice
So I make sure I stay gold, Ponyboy
Trying to be world stars, they push their views on us
But we try to stay away from being what you want us
The streets get hotter than a June Summer
But don't tell me I should move nigga ‘cause Imma-cause Imma…

Baby wanna hop on that ass like Kunta
Baby you fly like Mario three super
Fell from the sky like a goomba
Feeling up that brazzie-brazzie Luca
Trying to hold back but I read ya, Hoosier
Looking at your eyes, go hard like Medusa
Never been a floosy, you just always flew up
I try to say bye but you just throw the deuce up
Trying to hear my line but I just always lose ya
We go at it like Bloods and Hoovers
But we do it in the city of Yakuzas
You are make it hot, let me cut like I didn't pick paper/rock
Wake up without your car in a vacant lot
Red light, yellow light, slow, the green light’s on and…

So I never get to see when…
She go, I go, she go, I go, she go, I go
I don’t know where I’m gonna be when she go
Let the song play, just let the song play, let the song play
[Verse 2: XV]
Baby you should get in bed then
I got a warm pillow you can lay your head in
But we gotta get up and chase that dough like the gingerbread man
It’s like seven minutes in heaven
And I just want one more session
So I tie you up like the neck of Les Nessman
Then I eat you up like a delicatessen
Damn you fly, Jane Jetson and you do it like it’s your profession
Hit the store and blue cheese like dressing
Cooler than a senior, newer than a freshman
You my new obsession even though we ain’t progressing
‘Cause you gotta leave and I gotta leave
And we don’t ever-ever ask questions ‘cause when…

[Verse 3: Chiddy Bang]
She go, I go
Just another girl caught up in the world that raised me
And I’m aiming for the heart
But you gotta play it smart to make the girls go crazy
Do that, it’s a new rap and yo, those double D’s got me in a boob trap
J. Cole when I seen her I say who dat
And she love the way I’m live like a Roots track
Hey girl, I’m in a quest for your love
And all that weak shit sound extra to us
She would love me if my name wasn’t next to the buzz
‘Cause she was still there when that nigga was catching a bus
And I think that it’s right to be said
You gotta learn how to live life on the edge
I’m the number one man with a cumbersome plan
And that’s to make love with my number one fan

Ready... go

Get on the mic, get-get on the mic
Just get on the mic, get on the mic, Mike!
Let's be real, and don't cloud the issue
The rhymes are rope, an emcee you must listen to
People say that they been missin' me and missin' you
Get on the mic, and let's show them like we used to
Well, you say fuck that, yo, Holmes, fuck this
I'm the King AdWhammy and you're Dick Butkus
One half science and another half soul
Nicknamed Mike D, not Fat Morton Jelly Roll
Got busy in 'Frisco, fooled around in Fresno
Got over on your girlie 'cause you know she never says no

So just get on the mic, just get on the mic
Just get on the mic, get on the mic, Mike!
Well, Mike D is a special individual
Pullin' out knots and pullin' in residuals
Go to the movies, get the Rolos
The cholos ridin' slow and low
Mike on the mic and bust with the solo

Get on the mic cause you know you eat shellfish

I could never find my car keys and I have never pulled a map out
And the closest that I get to the outside world is my desktop background
But I done got all dressed up since I stepped out and impressed ya
It’s sad when ya homeboys text ya saying
If you come, we won’t ask ya till next month
What a loner, owner of my sofa
Controller of my life with my remote controller
Outta this world, how am I solar?
Message in a bottle, lemme finish my soda
Calls coming through but my phone ignores it
The world's outside, won't you go and explore it?
You're what them girls came for? Go for it, one-two-three, now forfeit

[Hook]
I was just about to come out of my room
I was gonna turn off my X-Box too
I was gonna step out the whip in a fresh outfit
And then I went and thought about you
Never mind, never mind, never mind, never mind, never mind
Never mind, never mind, never mind, never mind
[Verse 2: XV]
Why be saying never mind?
Walking it with girls that is never mine
She finding me side-eyeing
I mean she hella fine and I be like I holler at another time
What a loser, abuser of my computer
Open up the windows through windows and watch it boot up
Playing Tekken Six as long as I get Kazuya
Damn, I swear I used to seem much cooler
Used to step out fresh to the party world
Wasn't into her but she was such a Barbie girl and all she wanna do is go out
I wanna stay in and she gonna show out
Roll with an entourage like my name was Ari
Don bounce around like pong in Atari
It’s funny how they use to have parties and call me
Coat checks turn to rain checks, I'm sorry

I was like I'ma sit in traffic, just blasting my music while I chill in my ride
I was like I'ma see the girl of my dreams and this time, I'ma say hi
I was like this close to supposed to thinking I might, huh?

Got a city on my back that I tow around
Every city that Vizzy got to go around
And oh how I hate it ’cause this scene just makes me jaded
Niggas hating, I can taste it like mmm that’s my favorite
Give me two of those, I been out here doing shows
I remember when I couldn’t even fill the first two rows
I thought I was ‘bout to blow, guess I didn’t go to bed
City of the Lost Boys, they be acting so pretend
Niggas throw their deuces twice ’cause they gon be my foe again
I’m behind that super ten and somehow they know it’s him
How can someone so unsocial be so social?
I’m way too out-of-here to be so local
Mom tries telling me keep your praise on
And you’ll get love at the end like my first name was Faizon
I don’t wanna grow old writing rhymes in crayon
I’m so gone, I’m looking for my house on my way home

Running round to figure out how to get out your maze
Sometimes I board planes with no destination
You should try and play it, we call it board games
And when you this fly, you don’t think what to fall on
So I roam with no minutes, where do I even call home?
No wonder I left this crazy planet y’all on
Life’s like amusement parks and this is my theme’s song

Feel the earth wake up, won’t stay still
Haters all around but I won't stay trill

Say they don't love it but I know they will
Before the show is over and the lights go out
After I wreck on the mic, show out
Married to the mob so wives throw out

Stacking 'em, making out to perfect, I got a new Cady out of my first bitch

Hip hop ain't die man it just turned 20
Ambitions of musicians, im Thelonious Monk
Mixed with a lil' punk, for the homies to bump
I am not a lil' punk for the homies to jump
I'm Scarface smoking blunts while im holding the pump
So many hoes know me, I know what they want
But im Bobby at Knight, so I choke her for fun
Better yet Sprewell when Im choking the coach
You know that the flow is dope
So dont even front
You better say that im the truth when I open my mouth
Im a ghost and thats why I got so many styles
Nigga Pac won't leave me alone he keep haunting me
Taunting me, I ask him what the hell you want from me
He said nothing I just need some new company
These other rappers still sounding kinda dumb to me
So... Don't be scared if ever you think I grab at ya
I know its creepy, so what?... ""I ain't mad at cha""
This is written but off the top im the mad hatter
A bad boy, no wonder I see the Mad Rappers
All I gotta do is spray em' with Mase
They just pimples im Noxzema, they won't stay in my face
They got alot of opinions they won't say to my face
I treat em' like Bush do Mexicans, Stay in yo place
Im pink so why would I stay in a race?
But I black and these niggas can't stay in the race
Im a beast, catch me bathing with apes
Riding with lions, why are you lying, playa ya gay
If you try to throw me a curve, im making it straight
Shorty try to throw me her curves, I stay getting laid
Im a cute pink carpet, I stay in her place
And graffiti with the semen when I spray in her face
Using racial terms, Im the ace of the spades
Loon of the Coons, more money for the porch monkeys
I stack figures translation im that nigga
Rap sicker then ALL of you rap niggas
I pop alot of shit, that much is obvious
Im only nice with the wrapping cause I got a gift
And your pockets need Axe, it ain't got a scent
Im pretty set in my ways so why I gotta dip?
Ya'll lukewarm and I am your father prick
No catholic priest, get off your fathers dick
You pussies just love giving a lot of lip
Well im abstinent, thats why you ain't got a hit
I ain't stupid, I paint lucid pictures
I make moves like that Frank Lucas nigga
Should've been in the March on Washington
But im a king, so March on Washington
This is my year, from March on watch the kid
This that real chronic, go head you can spark it get lit
This track is the looseleaf I was born to rip
I make it rain like Storm in a porno flick
Made her leave her X man and get it on with him
Call Michael Buffer motherfucker, get it on with him
No homo but you niggas climbing Brokeback Mountain
Im so crack, you sold that? I hope that found em'
This is the product my nigga no backcounting
You ain't speaking English, you the pope, thats wildin'
You pop E and think you leading the faith
Well im a can of Red Bull, I can keep em' awake
I invest time in music, I guess I need more money
Until then November 10ths the new 4 20

No one can lead you off your path
You'll try to change the world
So please excuse me while I laugh

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Yo, I speak at schools a lot cause they say I'm intelligent
No, it's cause I'm dope, if I was whack I'd be irrelevant
I'm like the dope in your tracks until your high is settled in
You leanin' to the left, the laughter's the best medicine
But the troubles you have today you just can't laugh away
Stay optimistic, thinking change is gonna come like Donny Hathaway
You have to pray, on top of that, act today
Cause opportunity shrivel away like Tom Hanks in ""Cast Away""
Everybody pass away, the pastor prays, the family mournin'
Everybody act accordin' to the season that they born in (You'll try to change the world)
You fight in the streets, start bleedin' 'til the blood is pourin'
In the gutter, mothers cry 'til the Lord be livin' by the sword and
All that folks want is safety, they goin' gun crazy
The same reason Reagan was playin' war games in the '80s
The same reason I always rock dog chains on my babies
The struggle is beautiful, I'm too strong for your slavery
[Hook]
The revolution's here
No one can lead you off your path
You'll try to change the world
So please excuse me while I laugh
No one can change your ways
No one can lead you off your path
You'll try to change the world
So please excuse me while I laugh

The revolution's here
No one can lead you off your path
You'll try to change the world
So please excuse me while I laugh
No one can change your ways
No one can lead you off your path
You'll try to change the world
So please excuse me while I laugh

It's a beautiful thing that's happenin' right now
Right now G
Yo, I'm rockin' with my man Hi-Tek on the track right now
We fightin' the good fight
The Beautiful Struggle

Pans in the Kitchen,Hopsin,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Stop and listen
I'll rock it wicked, no competition on the shit
You gotta get it, there's nothing hotter than it
A wack rapper's what Hopsin isn't, I'll kick it
To ya if you got a minute you'll bob ya head like a walking pigeon
Play my position, I'm kinda different when rhymes is kickin'
I got lots of this, I vibe to it as I rock a fitted
The amount of people that's feeling me is a high percentage
They know I'm tight, but I'll be conceited if I admit it
I'ma clown the game until I'm up at the top of it
And don't be chicken to call me out if you got a problem with it
Un-silenced shit is gon' get you stuck in some violent shit
And feelings will be hurt so you're better off if you mind your business
Don't get it started, with that nigga Marcus, that kid retarded
It's gon' evolve to some ruckus, he'll prove your shit is garbage
He'll be the illest artist, realist on this rap
All you niggas out there wanna get him on your tracks

[Verse 2]
I used to push weight on the block
A fat bitch, she was barely able to walk
She was good for one thing, that was taking a cock
'Til she told me she was pregnant, shit I'm thankful to God
That she wasn't, 'cause all that shit was making me hot
I'm happy that she ain't the one to have a baby with Hop
She's so obese, I'd take her out and make her stay in the car
Her body odor always smelling like some bacon and farts
I'd tell her how I don't eat pork, she took it straight to the heart
Ready to make an assault, she need to make her fucking way to the barn
'Cause that's where she belong, better leave me alone
Calling, asking where I'm at like she need to know
Oh what a surprise, she thinking I'm the love of her life?
Becoming my wife?
Bitch, take some fucking advice
You wanna look nice? Trust me I'm right
Go to the motherfucking gym and lose the gut and you're fine

[Verse 3]
I'm Marcus and yes I am stupid
Thought I was a smart kid? Guess again, stupid
I'm a special ed student
Give me a couple of bars and let the man prove it
'Cause there's evidence to it
I never knew it, but the rest of my class knew it
They must've thought I'd never remember the past to it
Fuck school, man, I never could pass through it
I never be that student that headed to class who gets an A
Up on his report card, a nice kid who's so smart
Seem like when they threw me in special ed It got more hard
Every year the cycle repeats over again
My friends graduate and I'm way older then them
Then they come to me, nice mugging me, making fun of me
What do these ugly motherfuckers be thinking when they fuck with me?
They lucky I don't suddenly go and become something other than me
Like a fucking psycho, then what's it gonna be?

Lookin' like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Steps off stage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like ""You're—""
I'm like, ""I know, let's cut to the chase
No time to waste, back to my place""
Plus from the club to the crib's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus, I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin' (Akon!)

If I had a billion dollars (Yeah!)
Yeah, I'd spend all in a day, show these niggas how to play (Play)
Top floor penthouse, I'll show them where I stay (Stay)
Grand piano, might learn to play (Haha!)
Paid a hundred grand just to walk past it every day (Woo! Woo!)
You know I like them white keys on it (Yeah!)
Duct tape when we wrap them, call me prejudice
Cause I never touch the black ones (Keys that is, haha!)
Let me show how to do this, shawty (Shawty!)
I hit the strip club and I blew bout forty (Damn!)
Patron got me so confused ('Fused)
Until I stumbled outside and I made the news
Fresh nine piece, yeah, them wings is Cajun
Never seen me in the kitchen, nigga, I am amazing (Nah)
Well, fuck it, I'm rich then
If balling is a crime, fuck it, I'm hit then
If thugging is a term, fuck it, I'm it then

And I was high as a Learjet
Fly as the insect, even though we in debt
And it don't matter if I get her number 'cause
When I get my money right she gon' come running
And I'll be good like ""God"" with an extra ""o""
God knows that my check needs some extra 0's
And you know that you need to bring some extra hoes
Not in jogging pants either, tell them wear some sexy clothes
Now my game so professional
And my chain so fresh, they go (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Right after the fame did you gain anything?
Damn 'Ye, would you change anything?
But (If I had a billion dollars, yeah!)
I'd copped more pink polos and pop those collars

My Benz need company, her nickname Tahoe

Ain't gon' stress you, but I'mma let you know
Girl you be killin' 'em, you be killin' 'em
Girl you be killin' 'em, you be killin' 'em
Girl you be killin' 'em, you be killin' 'em
Girl you be killin' 'em, you be killin' 'em

[Verse 1]
You ain't gotta worry 'bout her, shorty straight
Been chasin' her for two days, first 48
A bad bitch cost, she worth every cent
She look like the best money that I ever spent
Just watching my cutiepie get beautified
Make me want better jewels, a newer ride
Louis Vuitton shoes, she got too much pride
Her feet are killing her, I call it shoe-icide
Looking good has it's sacrifices
Chilly weather bring 4 figure jacket prices
Her body nice, face dime
Give you that iPhone 4, face time
Shorty in the streets, still handle the home
Enough class for wine, still handle patron
When them other hoes call I hand her the phone
And she hand em the tone
[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
Yeah I know that's what they all says
She gotta donkey with a Juan Valdez
Keep it clean cut like bald heads
Been playin with that green long as Paul Pierce
So you gotta ball harder than them ball players
All she wanna know is there a mall near us
Can't fault her, the last nigga spoiled her
But he ain't beat it up, I assault her
Shoulda seen her come to me when I called her
Slow strut like she walking to the altar
Hand bag on her arm cost four bills
And she ain't gotta beg, borrow or steal
Often imitated, never duplicated
They say she a dime, I say she underrated
I just met her so the next solution
Dead my old chick, execution

[Refrain]

Had to let you know
All the ladies (to all the ladies)
I'd like to congratulate you
Congratulations
And you just came from the gym clothes
In a fitted cap and some Timbo's
And a pair of flats, well trimmed toes
Camera in the mirror, BBM Pose

You still killin' 'em hoes, you still killin' 'em hoes"

I Murder this Inc as soon as I touch the page
You ain't gon' have no other choice but to rush the stage
And charge the mic, and I hope you got the heart to fight
Cause you gon' have to, cause you ain't got the smarts to write
Something that good, to try to come back at me with
What you gon' do, try to out-rap me with that happy shit?
You motherfuckers crack me up, talking bout you gonna smack me up
Yall won't even back me up
Throw up your paws, you pussies can't even scratch me hard
It's like fucking cats de-clawed trying to jack me off
You think I'm afraid? What you trying to throw some fear in me?
You think I'm dumb enough to roll with no security?
I'm doing my best to try to show maturity
But don't sit there and stare at me like hoes and sneer at me
Like it's supposed to be scaring me
Like I won't leap clean over this fucking
V.I.P. rope and throw this chair
At anyone close or near me, trying to approach me physically
Cause he don't spit lyrically
And he knows that my flow's so sick, his ho's on my dick
And he's so sick of hearing me, my posters are staring at him
But I don't think he knows the severity
Of what it could escalate to or that it could grow so seriously
If I go hysterically, cause I guarantee
There's no one in here that would resort back childhood
Any quicker than I would, or hit you with plywood
Especially when I'm sipping on this liquor and tonic
One swig of this bottle I'mma go upside your head so hard with it
The mark from it'll be so dark that it'll leave a scar so big
You'll be able to read a label from the motherfucking
Sticker that's on it, I'm sick of the nonsense
Shit is ridiculous and I refuse to let it get to this point
Where I'mma let you sit on my conscience, I'm gone, bitch (YEAH!)

I'm gone bitch
Shady Records motherfucker, we gone, bitch
I said we gone bitch, so long, bitch
Catch up if you can, we moving on, bitch

Now who you know been to Kyoto, Tokyo
Off of one debut, screaming, ""I'm in Janai yo!""?
Obie Trice, showed you right
He done seen overseas, he's not a prototype (nah)
Nobody's protégé, Em only showed O. the way
Fuck what the media say
If you listen to music then you should know that O. Trice fused it
In a matter where he speaks how the streets views it
Choose, to translate it through the art of music
And started using it reaching the youth
Influenced by the truth in it (truth!)
And as a boy, a man, I ran from boys in vans
Do the knowledge, acknowledge and try to comprehend
Hand full of contraband
A product of my environment, narcotics and violence
Inspires the content, but my intent is
To retire these tired-ass writers in si-lence (yeah!)
Cause haters they hate us cause Shady became famous
And claimed the rap game when they thought he'd be nameless (hah!)
But racist accusations won't change us
Let the truth be told, you think O. will be over here
Like, ""Master, show them you got soul!""
No, anybody knows us knows that's not how we roll
So, I still push the bucket
If I ain't trust it I wouldn't fuck with it
But fuck it, I'm gone bitch!"

He was born in the summer of his 27th year
Comin' home to a place he’d never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for every door

[Verse 2]
When he first came to the mountains his life was far away
On the road and hangin’ by a song
But the string’s already broken and he doesn’t really care
It keeps changin' fast and it don’t last for long

[Chorus]
But the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I’ve seen it rainin' fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullaby
Rocky Mountain high (Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)

[Verse 3]
He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say that he got crazy once, and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept the memory
[Verse 4]
Now he walks in quiet solitude the forests and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake

[Chorus]
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I’ve seen it rainin' fire in the sky
Talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (High in Colorado)

[Verse 5]
Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land

And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I’ve seen it rainin' fire in the sky
Though he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly

Game over, had her shopping in Milan
Twenty racks, really that's sneaker money
Triple white Ferrari, yeah that's the Easter Bunny
At the Caesar in Vegas, I put the Visa on it
Now all she do is tell me how she used to love me
I let her decorate the real estate
And I let her spend a half a ticket, give or take
A couple dollars, Harry Winston stone collars
Canary yellow everything, plane chartered
I spoiled her maybe cause I adored her
More than fly, that girl's a flying saucer
My Mona Lisa painting on the wall came to life
And she said to love a bitch is to roll the dice

Though my paper way thicker than model make-up
But y'all wait up, my mind racing, I'm cold slipping
A lot of women is real, some bitches Robin Given
I never give ‘em no liquid, no pot to piss in
I tend to leave them quite offended if they too dependent
I’m pitchin bitches that's dreaming, thinking I'm trickin’ chicken
I’m simply fuckin’ with bitches that know they whole position

Funeral, check my phone, reacting like it's new to you
Talking what I give but never speak on what I do for you
Cabo to Jamaica every weekend, honeymoonin' you
Lobster over salmon and I ain't ever tried to tuna you

Greed written on her face, when I bought her first bag

Then play you all my latest shit
Lately I been stressing so I need you like I’m crazy
Music's irrelevant and money’s overrated
That’s why I spend it like I look at it with hatred
To look at you is painful, cuz I ain’t seen you naked
But I’ma wait it out I’m bout to see that drought
Cuz if I hit it now these feelings take a different route
So, I’m on some 40 days and night shit
Feeling like it’s Ramadan and I just need a bite quick
Tryna get inside your mind without that night shift
So I’ma be aight for the night with a goodbye kiss

Have you shakin' I would break you off
Without a second thought, but you got my respect is all
And I can show you all this love without a bit of sex involved
Maybe I foreplay it, maybe I kiss it lady
And even if we don't speak, you still are in my matrix
That’s how this lovin be, love it when she under me
She say that she celibate, I penetrate her mentally
So if it’s meant to be, then it’s meant to be
Hold on to the now, cuz I know sex be changing everything
If it’s meant to be, then it’s meant to be
She say ""I think I’m ready, if it change just remember me""
[Hook - Lloyd]

[Verse 3 - Wale]
If you ready then I'm ready go, hear this on my radio
Hennessey is in my blood, don't tell me you gon' tell me no
Tell me that you love me most, I tell you you the only one
Tell me where you want me go, nevermind I know what's up
Come and see what I'm about, pull your hair you say my name
Now you scratchin' on my back, I see your pleasure in my pain
She crack a smile, I'm finna turn it out
Probably won't last long, you know it's been a while

The Poverty of Philosophy,Immortal Technique,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Most of my Latino and black people who are struggling to get food, clothes and shelter in the hood are so concerned with that, that philosophising about freedom and socialist democracy is usually unfortunately beyond their rationale. They don't realize that America can't exist without separating them from their identity, because if we had some sense of who we really are, there's no way in hell we'd allow this country to push it's genocidal consensus on our homelands. This ignorance exists, but it can be destroyed
Niggas talk about change and working within the system to achieve that
The problem with always being a conformist is that when you try to change the system from within, it's not you who changes the system; it's the system that will eventually change you
There is usually nothing wrong with compromise in a situation, but compromising yourself in a situation is another story completely And I have seen this happen long enough in the few years that I've been alive to know that it's a serious problem
Latino America is a huge colony of countries whose presidents are cowards in the face of economic imperialism
You see, third world countries are rich places, abundant in resources, and many of these countries have the capacity to feed their starving people and the children we always see digging for food in trash on commercials
But plutocracies, in other words a government run by the rich such as this one and traditionally oppressive European states, force the third world into buying overpriced, unnecessary goods while exporting huge portions of their natural resources
I'm quite sure that people will look upon my attitude and sentiments and look for hypocrisy and hatred in my words
My revolution is born out of love for my people, not hatred for others

You see, most of Latinos are here because of the great inflation that was caused by American companies in Latin America
Aside from that, many are seeking a life away from the puppet democracies that were funded by the United States
Places like El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru, Colombia, Nicaragua, Ecuador and Republica Dominicana, and not just Spanish-speaking countries either, but Haiti and Jamaica as well
As different as we have been taught to look at each other by colonial society, we are in the same struggle and until we realize that, we'll be fighting for scraps from the table of a system that has kept us subservient instead of being self-determined
And that's why we have no control over when the embargo will stop in Cuba, or when the bombs will stop dropping in Vieques
But you see, here in America the attitude that is fed to us is that outside of America there live lesser people
""Fuck them, let them fend for themselves."" No, fuck you, they are you
No matter how much you want to dye your hair blonde and put fake eyes in, or follow an anorexic standard of beauty, or no matter how many diamonds you buy from people who exploit your own brutally to get them, no matter what kind of car you drive or what kind of fancy clothes you put on, you will never be them
They're always gonna look at you as nothing but a little monkey. I'd rather be proud of what I am, rather than desperately trying to be something I'm really not, just to fit in
And whether we want to accept it or not, that's what this culture or lack of culture is feeding us
I want a better life for my family and for my children, but it doesn't have to be at the expense of millions of lives in my homeland. We're given the idea that if we didn't have these people to exploit then America wouldn't be rich enough to let us have these little petty material things in our lives and basic standards of living
No, that's wrong. It's the business giants and the government officials who make all the real money
We have whatever they kick down to us
My enemy is not the average white man, it's not the kid down the block or the kids I see on the street; my enemy is the white man I don't see: the people in the white house, the corporate monopoly owners, fake liberal politicians those are my enemies
The generals of the armies that are mostly conservatives those are the real motherfuckers that I need to bring it to
Not the poor, broke country-ass soldier that's too stupid to know shit about the way things are set up
In fact, I have more in common with most working- and middle-class white people than I do with most rich black and Latino people
As much as racism bleeds America, we need to understand that classism is the real issue.
Many of us are in the same boat and it's sinking, while these bougie motherfuckers ride on a luxury liner, and as long as we keep fighting over kicking people out of the little boat we're all in, we're gonna miss an opportunity to gain a better standard of living as a whole
In other words, I don't want to escape the plantation
I want to come back, free all my people, hang the motherfucker that kept me there and burn the house to the god damn ground
I want to take over the encomienda and give it back to the people who work the land
You cannot change the past but you can make the future, and anyone who tells you different is a fucking lethargic devil
I don't look at a few token Latinos and black people in the public eye as some type of achievement for my people as a whole
Most of those successful individuals are sellouts and house negroes
But, I don't consider brothers a sell-out if they move out of the ghetto
Poverty has nothing to do with our people. It's not in our culture to be poor
That's only been the last 500 years of our history; look at the last 2000 years of our existence and what we brought to the world in terms of science, mathematics, agriculture, and forms of government
You know the idea of a confederation of provinces where one federal government controls the states? The Europeans who came to this country stole that idea from the Iroquois League
The idea of impeaching a ruler comes from an Aztec tradition. That's why Montezuma was stoned to death by his own people cause he represented the agenda of White Spaniards once he was captured
Not the Aztec people who would become Mexicans

So in conclusion, I'm not gonna vote for anybody just cause they Black or Latino. They have to truly represent the community and represent what's good for all of us proletariat

*Gibberish*"
The Rime Of The Ancient Mariner,Samuel Taylor Coleridge,[],"Argument

How a Ship having passed the Line was driven by storms to the cold Country towards the South Pole; and how from thence she made her course to the tropical Latitude of the Great Pacific Ocean; and of the strange things that befell; and in what manner the Ancyent Marinere came back to his own Country.

Part I

It is an ancient Mariner,
And he stoppeth one of three.
`By thy long grey beard and glittering eye
Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?

The bridegroom's doors are opened wide,
And I am next of kin;
The guests are met, the feast is set:
Mayst hear the merry din.'

He holds him with his skinny hand.
""There was a ship,"" quoth he.
`Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!'
Eftsoons his hand dropped he.
He holds him with his glittering eye -
The Wedding-Guest stood still
And listens like a three years' child:
The Mariner hath his will.

The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone:
He cannot choose but hear;
And thus spake on that ancient man,
The bright-eyed Mariner.

""The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,
Merrily did we drop
Below the kirk, below the hill,
Below the lighthouse top.

The sun came up upon the left.
Out of the sea came he!
And he shone bright, and on the right
Went down into the sea.

Higher and higher every day,
Till over the mast at noon -""
The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,
For he heard the loud bassoon.

The bride hath paced into the hall,
Red as a rose is she;
Nodding their heads before her goes
The merry minstrelsy.
The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast,
Yet he cannot choose but hear;
And thus spake on that ancient man,
The bright-eyed Mariner.

""And now the storm-blast came, and he
Was tyrannous and strong:
He struck with his o'ertaking wings
And chased us south along

With sloping masts and dipping prow,
As who pursued with yell and blow
Still treads the shadow of his foe,
And foward bends his head,
The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,
And southward aye we fled.

And now there came both mist and snow,
And it grew wondrous cold:
And ice, mast-high, came floating by,
As green as emerald.

And through the drifts the snowy clifts
Did send a dismal sheen:
Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken -
The ice was all between.
The ice was here, the ice was there,
The ice was all around:
It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,
Like noises in a swound!

At length did cross an Albatross,
Thorough the fog it came;
As if it had been a Christian soul
We hailed it in God's name.

It ate the food it ne'er had eat,
And round and round it flew.
The ice did split with a thunder-fit;
The helmsman steered us through!

And a good south wind sprung up behind;
The Albatross did follow,
And every day, for food or play
Came to the mariner's hollo!

In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,
It perched for vespers nine;
Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white
Glimmered the white moonshine.""

`God save thee, ancient Mariner!
From the fiends that plague thee thus! -
Why look'st thou so?' -""With my crossbow
I shot the Albatross.""

Part II

""The sun now rose upon the right:
Out of the sea came he,
Still hid in mist, and on the left
Went down into the sea.

And the good south wind still blew behind,
But no sweet bird did follow,
Nor any day for food or play
Came to the mariners' hollo!

And I had done a hellish thing,
And it would work 'em woe:
For all averred, I had killed the bird
That made the breeze to blow.
Ah wretch! said they, the bird to slay,
That made the breeze to blow!

Nor dim nor red, like God's own head,
The glorious sun uprist:
Then all averred, I had killed the bird
That brought the fog and mist.
'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay
That bring the fog and mist.

The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew,
The furrow followed free;
We were the first that ever burst
Into that silent sea.

Down dropped the breeze, the sails dropped down,
'Twas sad as sad could be;
And we did speak only to break
The silence of the sea!

All in a hot and copper sky,
The bloody sun, at noon,
Right up above the mast did stand
No bigger than the moon.

Day after day, day after day,
We stuck, nor breath nor motion;
As idle as a painted ship
Upon a painted ocean.

Water, water, every where,
And all the boards did shrink;
Water, water, every where,
Nor any drop to drink.

The very deep did rot: O Christ!
That ever this should be!
Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs
Upon the slimy sea.

About, about, in reel and rout
The death-fires danced at night;
The water, like a witch's oils
Burnt green, and blue, and white.

And some in dreams assured were
Of the Spirit that plagued us so;
Nine fathom deep he had followed us
From the land of mist and snow.

And every tongue, through utter drought
Was withered at the root;
We could not speak, no more than if
We had been choked with soot.

Ah! well-a-day! what evil looks
Had I from old and young!
Instead of the cross, the Albatross
About my neck was hung.""

Part III

""There passed a weary time. Each throat
Was parched, and glazed each eye.
A weary time! a weary time!
How glazed each weary eye -
When looking westward, I beheld
A something in the sky.

At first it seemed a little speck
And then it seemed a mist;
It moved and moved, and took at last
A certain shape, I wist.

A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist!
And still it neared and neared:
As if it dodged a water-sprite
It plunged and tacked and veered.

With throats unslaked, with black lips baked
We could nor laugh nor wail;
Through utter drought all dumb we stood!
I bit my arm, I sucked the blood,
And cried, A sail! a sail!

With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,
Agape they heard me call:
Gramercy! they for joy did grin,
And all at once their breath drew in
As they were drinking all.

See! see! (I cried) she tacks no more!
Hither to work us weal;
Without a breeze, without a tide
She steadies with upright keel!

The western wave was all a-flame
The day was well nigh done!
Almost upon the western wave
Rested the broad bright sun;
When that strange shape drove suddenly
Betwixt us and the sun.

And straight the sun was flecked with bars
(Heaven's Mother send us grace!)
As if through a dungeon-grate he peered
With broad and burning face.

Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)
How fast she nears and nears!
Are those her sails that glance in the sun
Like restless gossameres?

Are those her ribs through which the sun
Did peer, as through a grate?
And is that Woman all her crew?
Is that a Death? and are there two?
Is Death that Woman's mate?

Her lips were red, her looks were free,
Her locks were yellow as gold:
Her skin was as white as leprosy,
The Nightmare Life-in-Death was she,
Who thicks man's blood with cold.

The naked hulk alongside came
And the twain were casting dice;
`The game is done! I've won! I've won!'
Quoth she, and whistles thrice.

The sun's rim dips; the stars rush out:
At one stride comes the dark;
With far-heard whisper o'er the sea
Off shot the spectre-bark.

We listened and looked sideways up!
Fear at my heart, as at a cup
My life-blood seemed to sip!
The stars were dim, and thick the night,
The steersman's face by his lamp gleamed white;
From the sails the dew did drip -
Till clomb above the eastern bar
The horned moon, with one bright star
Within the nether tip.

One after one, by the star-dogged moon
Too quick for groan or sigh,
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang
And cursed me with his eye.

Four times fifty living men
(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump
They dropped down one by one.

The souls did from their bodies fly, -
They fled to bliss or woe!
And every soul it passed me by
Like the whizz of my crossbow!""

Part IV

`I fear thee, ancient Mariner!
I fear thy skinny hand!
And thou art long, and lank, and brown
As is the ribbed sea-sand.

I fear thee and thy glittering eye
And thy skinny hand, so brown.' -
""Fear not, fear not, thou Wedding-Guest!
This body dropped not down.

Alone, alone, all, all alone,
Alone on a wide wide sea!
And never a saint took pity on
My soul in agony.

The many men, so beautiful!
And they all dead did lie;
And a thousand thousand slimy things
Lived on; and so did I.

I looked upon the rotting sea
And drew my eyes away;
I looked upon the rotting deck
And there the dead men lay.

I looked to heaven, and tried to pray;
But or ever a prayer had gusht,
A wicked whisper came and made
My heart as dry as dust.

I closed my lids, and kept them close
And the balls like pulses beat;
Forthe sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky
Lay like a load on my weary eye
And the dead were at my feet.

The cold sweat melted from their limbs,
Nor rot nor reek did they:
The look with which they looked on me
Had never passed away.

An orphan's curse would drag to hell
A spirit from on high;
But oh! more horrible than that
Is the curse in a dead man's eye!
Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse
And yet I could not die.

The moving moon went up the sky
And no where did abide:
Softly she was going up
And a star or two beside -

Her beams bemocked the sultry main
Like April hoar-frost spread;
But where the ship's huge shadow lay,
The charmed water burnt alway
A still and awful red.

Beyond the shadow of the ship
I watched the water-snakes:
They moved in tracks of shining white,
And when they reared, the elfish light
Fell off in hoary flakes.

Within the shadow of the ship
I watched their rich attire:
Blue, glossy green, and velvet black,
They coiled and swam; and every track
Was a flash of golden fire.

O happy living things! no tongue
Their beauty might declare:
A spring of love gushed from my heart
And I blessed them unaware:
Sure my kind saint took pity on me
And I blessed them unaware.

The selfsame moment I could pray;
And from my neck so free
The Albatross fell off, and sank
Like lead into the sea.""

Part V

""Oh sleep! it is a gentle thing
Beloved from pole to pole!
To Mary Queen the praise be given!
She sent the gentle sleep from heaven
That slid into my soul.

The silly buckets on the deck
That had so long remained,
I dreamt that they were filled with dew;
And when I awoke, it rained.

My lips were wet, my throat was cold,
My garments all were dank;
Sure I had drunken in my dreams,
And still my body drank.

I moved, and could not feel my limbs:
I was so light -almost
I thought that I had died in sleep
And was a blessed ghost.

And soon I heard a roaring wind:
It did not come anear;
But with its sound it shook the sails
That were so thin and sere.

The upper air burst into life!
And a hundred fire-flags sheen
To and fro they were hurried about!
And to and fro, and in and out
The wan stars danced between.

And the coming wind did roar more loud
And the sails did sigh like sedge,;
And the rain poured down from one black cloud;
The moon was at its edge.

The thick black cloud was cleft, and still
The moon was at its side:
Like waters shot from some high crag
The lightning fell with never a jag,
A river steep and wide.

The loud wind never reached the ship
Yet now the ship moved on!
Beneath the lightning and the moon
The dead men gave a groan.

They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose,
Nor spake, nor moved their eyes;
It had been strange, even in a dream
To have seen those dead men rise.

The helmsman steered, the ship moved on;
Yet never a breeze up blew;
The mariners all 'gan work the ropes
Where they were wont to do;
They raised their limbs like lifeless tools -
We were a ghastly crew.

The body of my brother's son
Stood by me, knee to knee:
The body and I pulled at one rope
But he said nought to me.""

`I fear thee, ancient Mariner!'
""Be calm, thou Wedding-Guest!
'Twas not those souls that fled in pain
Which to their corses came again
But a troop of spirits blest:

For when it dawned -they dropped their arms
And clustered round the mast;
Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths
And from their bodies passed.

Around, around, flew each sweet sound
Then darted to the sun;
Slowly the sounds came back again,
Now mixed, now one by one.

Sometimes a-dropping from the sky
I heard the skylark sing;
Sometimes all little birds that are,
How they seemed to fill the sea and air
With their sweet jargoning!

And now 'twas like all instruments,
Now like a lonely flute;
And now it is an angel's song
That makes the heavens be mute.

It ceased; yet still the sails made on
A pleasant noise till noon,
A noise like of a hidden brook
In the leafy month of June,
That to the sleeping woods all night
Singeth a quiet tune.

Till noon we quietly sailed on
Yet never a breeze did breathe;
Slowly and smoothly went the ship,
Moved onward from beneath.

Under the keel nine fathom deep
From the land of mist and snow
The spirit slid: and it was he
That made the ship to go.
The sails at noon left off their tune
And the ship stood still also.

The sun, right up above the mast
Had fixed her to the ocean:
But in a minute she 'gan stir
With a short uneasy motion -
Backwards and forwards half her length
With a short uneasy motion.

Then like a pawing horse let go
She made a sudden bound:
It flung the blood into my head
And I fell down in a swound.

How long in that same fit I lay
I have not to declare;
But ere my living life returned,
I heard and in my soul discerned
Two voices in the air.

`Is it he?' quoth one, `Is this the man?
By him who died on cross,
With his cruel bow he laid full low
The harmless Albatross.

The spirit who bideth by himself
In the land of mist and snow
He loved the bird that loved the man
Who shot him with his bow.'

The other was a softer voice
As soft as honey-dew:
Quoth he, `The man hath penance done
And penance more will do.'

Part VI

First Voice

But tell me, tell me! speak again
Thy soft response renewing -
What makes that ship drive on so fast?
What is the ocean doing?

Second Voice

Still as a slave before his lord
The ocean hath no blast;
His great bright eye most silently
Up to the moon is cast -

If he may know which way to go;
For she guides him smooth or grim
See, brother, see! how graciously
She looketh down on him.

First Voice

But why drives on that ship so fast
Without or wave or wind?

Second Voice

The air is cut away before
And closes from behind.

Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high!
Or we shall be belated:
For slow and slow that ship will go
When the Mariner's trance is abated.

""I woke, and we were sailing on
As in a gentle weather:
'Twas night, calm night, the moon was high;
The dead men stood together.

All stood together on the deck
For a charnel-dungeon fitter:
All fixed on me their stony eyes
That in the moon did glitter.

The pang, the curse, with which they died
Had never passed away:
I could not draw my eyes from theirs
Nor turn them up to pray.

And now this spell was snapped: once more
I viewed the ocean green,
And looked far forth, yet little saw
Of what had else been seen -

Like one that on a lonesome road
Doth walk in fear and dread,
And having once turned round walks on
And turns no more his head;
Because he knows a frightful fiend
Doth close behind him tread.

But soon there breathed a wind on me,
Nor sound nor motion made:
Its path was not upon the sea
In ripple or in shade.

It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek
Like a meadow-gale of spring -
It mingled strangely with my fears,
Yet it felt like a welcoming.

Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship
Yet she sailed softly too:
Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze -
On me alone it blew.

Oh! dream of joy! is this indeed
The lighthouse top I see?
Is this the hill? is this the kirk?
Is this mine own country?

We drifted o'er the harbour-bar
And I with sobs did pray -
O let me be awake, my God!
Or let me sleep alway.

The harbour-bay was clear as glass
So smoothly it was strewn!
And on the bay the moonlight lay
And the shadow of the moon.

The rock shone bright, the kirk no less
That stands above the rock:
The moonlight steeped in silentness
The steady weathercock.

And the bay was white with silent light
Till rising from the same
Full many shapes, that shadows were,
In crimson colours came.

A little distance from the prow
Those crimson shadows were:
I turned my eyes upon the deck -
Oh, Christ! what saw I there!

Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat
And, by the holy rood!
A man all light, a seraph-man
On every corse there stood.

This seraph-band, each waved his hand:
It was a heavenly sight!
They stood as signals to the land
Each one a lovely light;

This seraph-band, each waved his hand
No voice did they impart -
No voice; but oh! the silence sank
Like music on my heart.

But soon I heard the dash of oars
I heard the Pilot's cheer;
My head was turned perforce away
And I saw a boat appear.

The Pilot and the Pilot's boy
I heard them coming fast:
Dear Lord in heaven! it was a joy
The dead men could not blast.

I saw a third -I heard his voice:
It is the Hermit good!
He singeth loud his godly hymns
That he makes in the wood.
He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away
The Albatross's blood.""

Part VII

""This Hermit good lives in that wood
Which slopes down to the sea.
How loudly his sweet voice he rears!
He loves to talk with marineers
That come from a far country.

He kneels at morn, and noon, and eve -
He hath a cushion plump:
It is the moss that wholly hides
The rotted old oak-stump.

The skiff-boat neared: I heard them talk
`Why, this is strange, I trow!
Where are those lights so many and fair
That signal made but now?'

`Strange, by my faith!' the Hermit said -
`And they answered not our cheer!
The planks looked warped! and see those sails
How thin they are and sere!
I never saw aught like to them
Unless perchance it were.

Brown skeletons of leaves that lag
My forest-brook along;
When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow
And the owlet whoops to the wolf below
That eats the she-wolf's young.'

`Dear Lord! it hath a fiendish look -
(The Pilot made reply)
I am afeared' -`Push on, push on!'
Said the Hermit cheerily.

The boat came closer to the ship
But I nor spake nor stirred;
The boat came close beneath the ship
And straight a sound was heard.

Under the water it rumbled on
Still louder and more dread:
It reached the ship, it split the bay;
The ship went down like lead.

Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound
Which sky and ocean smote
Like one that hath been seven days drowned
My body lay afloat;
But swift as dreams, myself I found
Within the Pilot's boat.

Upon the whirl where sank the ship
The boat spun round and round;
And all was still, save that the hill
Was telling of the sound.

I moved my lips -the Pilot shrieked
And fell down in a fit;
The holy Hermit raised his eyes
And prayed where he did sit.

I took the oars: the Pilot's boy
Who now doth crazy go
Laughed loud and long, and all the while
His eyes went to and fro.
`Ha! ha!' quoth he, `full plain I see
The Devil knows how to row.'

And now, all in my own country
I stood on the firm land!
The Hermit stepped forth from the boat
And scarcely he could stand.

O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man!
The Hermit crossed his brow.
`Say quick,' quoth he `I bid thee say -
What manner of man art thou?'

Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched
With a woeful agony
Which forced me to begin my tale;
And then it left me free.

Since then, at an uncertain hour
That agony returns;
And till my ghastly tale is told
This heart within me burns.

I pass, like night, from land to land;
I have strange power of speech;
That moment that his face I see
I know the man that must hear me:
To him my tale I teach.

What loud uproar bursts from that door!
The wedding-guests are there:
But in the garden-bower the bride
And bride-maids singing are;
And hark the little vesper bell
Which biddeth me to prayer!

O Wedding-Guest! this soul hath been
Alone on a wide wide sea:
So lonely 'twas, that God himself
Scarce seemed there to be.

O sweeter than the marriage-feast
'Tis sweeter far to me
To walk together to the kirk
With a goodly company! -

To walk together to the kirk
And all together pray
While each to his great Father bends
Old men, and babes, and loving friends
And youths and maidens gay!

Farewell, farewell! but this I tell
To thee, thou Wedding-Guest!
He prayeth well, who loveth well
Both man and bird and beast.

He prayeth best, who loveth best
All things both great and small;
For the dear God who loveth us
He made and loveth all.""

The Mariner, whose eye is bright
Whose beard with age is hoar
Is gone; and now the Wedding-Guest
Turned from the bridegroom's door.

He went like one that hath been stunned
And is of sense forlorn:
A sadder and a wiser man
He rose the morrow morn."

Slangin' fun bags, she can’t cover with pasties
Call 'em the K-Ci, turn a gentleman racy
Now sample that beat like ya Timbaland, baby
Us rappers ain't stars, not hard to reach yet
Grind like I’m starved, with a heart to eat less
And give more, patchin' up the hood like a seamstress
Speech blessed, put my chest out like it’s freakfest
Hopped out the Lexus, and hopped up in the throne
These rappers out they groove like they poppin' out a bone
Keep my flow on Loch, I’ma monster in my own
You will never be the one, that’s a part of being clones
I’m fine, satisfied that nobody really know me
So flowers, you can save em for the birds, no poultry
I rap, no poetry, I live life cozy
I’ll take over ya spot like Melvin did Jodie
Competition ain’t a thing, when nobody in the ring
Put a rapper in a sling, and act as snobby as a king
Hardcore clubber, even Rocky couldn’t swing
Wanna beef? Get the baseball bat poppin' like I’m Sting
Thirty-four or sum’n bars, the best I give
Finna be the biggest Smalls since that Bed-Stuy kid
Gon’ thinks its lava if you second-guess my spit"
The Dark Horse,XV,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
Can we get much higher? So high oh
Can we get much higher? So high oh
Can we get much higher? So high oh
Can we get much higher? So high oh

[Verse 1]

They telling Vizzy to kill it but that’s obvious
Ace or Jesse Ventura, either way, I’m gon body it
Niggas play cool and jump the shark on some Fonzie shit
Crazy, my hustle from just being Po’ got me rich
Paid in full bitch, Slick Rick, jewelry on
I killed the web hit Safari with the Google Chrome
And every track user share is Media Fire
Who that dude killing the venue, and is he for hire?
Yup, you can ask Mr. Maysonet
That’s why I be on planes like the state I rep
Little niggas on blogs try to hate on X
But they ain’t got the Kevin Hart to say with they chest nigga
So fuck that hater, one man rap Laker
One hand behind the back, lay up on these half players
That nigga on Rap Radar is a rap raider
Feeling like Wiz on his last papers saying…
[Hook]
Can we get much higher? Oh
(Repeating)
[Verse 2]

Is this what we doing tonight? Yeah, I think we winning
Like coming home from the dentist, I just got a filling
Where making it is the hero, being broke is the villain
Clouds are the ground and the moon is the ceiling
Victory is close, the question is will I wait? Why?
When I catch her like a predator on Dateline
I’m like a bust when I bust, I don’t waste lines
‘Cause there’s a world outside I’m trying to make mine
Drop an album, win a Grammy, put my boys on
Then I roll with the dough on a croissant
Big house in Japan with a koi pond
Doing this is Double O, you just a decoy Bond
The black Daniel Craig throw you off the ledge
Now I’m drinking your juice and eating your scrambled eggs
The whole crowd standing like the morning pledge
Saying I’m the best like morning head yeah
‘Cause what they do in they first 48, I do in 12
Somebody call the first 48, this shit is killed
Put me in leagues of Ivy like I went to Yale
With tales that the less lyrical niggas couldn’t tell
Y’all must be after L’s like Pollo Loco
Put the game in chokehold, stun your day like Stone Cold
Out in Japan with a bad chick rocking kimonos
She all up in my linen and I ain’t talking Yoko
Rosetta Stone, I get eight in every language like ocho
I’m just way too vocal for these rap locals
But I'mma break the door down with the right force
Make way for the white knight, dark horse

Demon Inside,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse]
I'm possessed by evil demons that torture me while I'm sleeping
I keep dreaming of death and I'm hearing people screaming
The devil's spirit's trapped inside me and I want it out
I'm on the couch bleeding to death in a haunted house
With both of my wrists slit, I'm lifted up in the air
And suspended in animation like someone's holding me there
I feel somebody's cold hands wrapping around my neck
While I choke on my own blood that I swallow and drown to death
But I found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches
Nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes
Tripping over OD'd bodies of dead lushes
Bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red blushes
Door's open and close by themselves
Books fly off shelves, curtains catch fire, the house melts
My skin blisters and sticks together like twin sisters
The wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters
Caught a piece of shrapnel in the Adam's apple
Two cups of holy water and I'm looking at 'em half full
But as soon as I go to touch 'em they turn into red rum
It got silent, then all these voices said
""Come follow me into the gates of Hell""
I heard 'em yell ""Welcome to the Norman Bates Motel!""
I ring the bell for service and I was greeted by his mother
Covered in dry blood, head still dented from the shovel
I said I need a room so I could try to get some rest
She gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag of cess
And told me that's just for starters, Satan'll be in to see me later
To see if I'm interested in being partners"
Get Em Daddy Remix,Cam'ron,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Cam'ron]
See the problem is I ain't goin' nowhere
Can shoot at me, can stab at me
Take your best shot (this is the remix)
Suck a dick no homo
Dipset, remix, let's go!

[Verse 1: Hell Rell]
My flow is Novocaine, my bars is hurricanes (Katrina)
I got hella 'caine, MAC in the melon Range
Hop out and shells exchange
I wanna see these niggas die die, make they mom feel hella pain
Walk around like I got a broom in my pants
Nah, that's a fuckin A-K, heavy tool in my pants, damn
Man, these cowards better stay in they lane
And if they ain't getting the picture, it ain't in the frame
VVS's stay in my chain (bling), they in my ring (there they go)
You must've wrote your will already if you’re saying our names
Hell Rell, Mr. Ruger Ruger, I'm a shooter shooter
You hung with the girls you double dutch or hula-hooper (faggot)
Hop skip and jumping, block clicking and jumping
Glock clicking and dumping, it's the mighty Dips
[Verse 2: J.R. Writer]
Listen I'm quite known, nice chrome, a cyclone, niggas
Your sight blown, right-o, my white stones glitter
Left hand bling, the right one shiver
Stallion, medallion, a ice cold picture
The white stone flipper
That white tone, nights home, getting rid of the weight like lipo mister
This psycho sicker
That ain't cracking ya pimp, you got a rat as a friend like Mike on Thriller
This ain't nothing to me, a scrapper at its best
No rapper could impress, man I'm crack right out the 'jects
You rapping indirect
But it's looking like a movie shoot
How they sending all these damn actors at the Set

[Verse 3: Jim Jones]
It goes get 'em daddy (Goonies)
Soul niggas they sick and flabby (they washed up)
Young fly rich and every nigga with me pack heat (we balling)
Somebody snapping pictures at me (watching)
Plus I know I got the F.B.I. sick of me
The cash, the jewels and how we buy exquisite V's
Don't get ya brains fried to a fricassee
My vest and my heater, breath full of reefer
And ya boy stay fly like he was dressing for Easter
The big Pachorte, Capo the heffe
Packing 4-4 court case to drop on expressway
It's Dipset, Byrdgang, we fly high
And chart the G-4 we getting high in the sky, you fuckers
[Verse 4: Cam'ron]
Killa, Killa!
I'm Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage, Bob Backlund
Part-acting, ha ha, who they think they car jackin
You dump and a dump, I slumped and I slump
They mad my car's like an elephant, the trunk in the front
See ya dude react, Hud 6 threw me back, a few they clapped
But I ate those, them shits is Scooby Snacks
I ain't see stars, I'm a G pa
Threw the Lam' in 6th, drove to the ER (true story)
Had to make it hot
Feel like Pac, I know a set up
Them old niggas know I'm 'bout to take they spot
Ain't no A.B. - I.O.U

Like I see you at the BP, shot 'em off GP
Guns from VA, PA, down to D.C

I wanted somebody else to do the hook, but I ain't got nobody here
So I'm gonna do it

Or should I decline and press rewind?
Losing my mind, yes I'm
Using my 9 this time
Or should I decline and press rewind?

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Ever since November hit, I can't remember shit
Unless I was in your chick when I picked her, she was a limber bitch
She say I sent her quick and treated her as cold as Denver get
That wimper shit's for simpers, don't enter this 'cause I'm winter, trick
And I like my hoes cold, young, dumb, lungs done
Now she's an old soul, ate her like Lambert's throwed rolls
Shorty come and shorties go, this skinny chick orgy blows
Horny bro, looking for a thicky, hunt her down like Laurie Strode
I'm plum stark buck naked in my white socks
Might pop my top and hype the block when the light stops
Just call me cyclops, I see what others might not
The white cops are on me, oh, man, we're in a tight spot
It's ironic though I'm bad, yep my mama grow the lad
Who rob the Conoco for cash up in Monaco
I'm half native got a relative named Jeroni-ho
And this persona's ""Fuck the drama, only honor dough""
I know who died plus and who did it
Kansas City Cyrus, can you dig it?
Cut off your arm and fan you with it
Some listen to me and say “Damn, you wicked”

[Verse 1]
When you strive for perfection
Desire get confused and you could lose your direction
I lost my connection with a brethren
Athlete mentality so fuck my competition
Me and him was homies, maybe we still cool
But every time we book, we stay in our green room
Maybe its on me, or brother its on you
Or maybe its they fault that we ain't holla since June
Fuck it we on the move, none of use tryna lose
I am out of this world and you a man on the moon
I'll meet you in the sky
Look this whole time, we was comin from separate towns to hold down
I figure this where my heart at
This shit has got my soul
I tell them niggas picture me rollin I get the Kodak
If ya'll don't know ya history ya'll should look a lil' closer
I feel like Quasimoto with all this shit on my shoulders
They say this media changed, these verses gettin strange
Who you know that's famous and rich and stay the same?
How can niggas blame us, I am not ashamed but
I don't understand how this game made us strangers, look
[Hook]
Competition, for the love and anyway it go, they gon remember us
My nigga, its all love
That's how this shit be goin when you go for number one
We tryna be number one, number one, we tryna be number one

[Verse 2]
When you strive for perfection
Desire get confused and you could lose your direction
I lost my connection with my woman
I needed her support but she was thinkin bout a marriage, FORGET IT.!
I know your love is the purest
But sexin without affection is necessary for some of us
Here's my heart you can hold it, I won't need it on this road trip
And I ain't tryna cheat so go head, leave me to my lonesome
GO! you free to go about your business
But if we back to business hope we resurrect the feelin
I'm a real nigga, them other niggas fill in
The only girl I say I love you, and I'm not pretendin
Look, I got no time for that type of connection
Meantime, I hope you keep your vagina protected
Your friends say, why we not together yet
Sad but its true, but I ain't on ya level yet
Tryna keep a level head, Workin like a Mexican
Runnin this bitch, feel like I deserve a medal here
First placin it, wine wastin it
With all due respect, I can't have you in the way of it
[Hook]
Competition, she in love, and anyway it go
I'm gon remember her, but still
My nature, its all love, that's how that shit be goin
She vying for number one, Tryna be number one
She tryna be number one, she tryna be number one, tryna be number ONE,!"

She still performs like the superstar she truly are
So, also, I think I love her already
Damn, I think I, already, haha
She must be the one
I look in her eyes and see the sun even on rainy days
Ain't it crazy mane? Yeah, that’s what I said
She do doughnuts in my head, over and over and over
'Til the cops pull her over
And then she say some real slick shit like
""I’m on my way by Weezy Baby""
Heh, and of course they let her go
Let me take off my shades

Full of Chanel's and Tiffany's and broken hearts girl

I Am Raw,Hopsin,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Hopsin]
You motherfuckers are quick to judge. It's all good though. You don't know shit about shit. If you only knew what I knew, if you only knew what I could do. If you could only see what I could see you would probably stop bothering me

[Verse 1: Hopsin]
Yeah
I independently started this shit, marketing hits
Starving for chips, no gasoline to start off the whip
Felt like the only nigga labels wasn't bargaining with
My heart has been ripped, I stuck with it as hard as it gets
These producers would always blow me off
Now that I'm blowing up, they don't recall
Talking about ""Yo, you my homie, dawg"" (My nigga)
Oh, now you wanna hop on the Hop train
Knowing damn well since '04 I had hot flames (The fuck outta here)
My real buddies was mainly the worst
Hating to shoot my videos without me paying them first
So I slide 'em 100 bucks to watch 'em bitch on how it ain't enough (Man)
That money got my cell, internet and cable cut!
A real homie would've gave a fuck and not expect to pay upfront
Then get the money later when I'm making some
Nobody saw the bigger picture except me
They neglect me, only thing that protects me is FV (Come on)
[Chorus: Chelsea Hopson & Hopsin]
You don't always have to stick by my side
Just make sure you remember me when I die
I am raw, I am raw
Just to let you niggas know
Bitch I am raw, I am raw
Don't forget me when I'm gone
Bitch I am raw

[Verse 2: SwizZz]
I was a high school grad preparing to go to college
An enthusiastic freshman, major in Economics
I didn't have a clue what to expect to be honest
Banging beats in my dorm, streaming Pornhub constant
I figured I could make it out in four years tops
Study religiously and graduate, apply for a job
The rap thing was secondary, I was putting it off
Calling it quits, assuming I had better chances playing ball (Yep)
My third year came and suddenly that changed
I couldn't bear watching my mom at home suffering pain
Tryna fight off the strain of only having half a stomach
Plus a handicap back from a surgery that helped nothing!
So I returned to the valley and called the homie
Hop was on Ruthless getting shelved like a trophy
I told him how I left my life in the OC
And we concluded that we could both use FV
[Chorus: Chelsea Hopson & Hopsin]
You don't always have to stick by my side
Just make sure you remember me when I die
I am raw, I am raw
Just to let you niggas know
Bitch I am raw, I am raw
Don't forget me when I'm gone
Bitch I am raw

[Verse 3: Hopsin]
This was written for niggas who wouldn't give me dap
Niggas who told me that I had sissy rap
This was written for all the bitches I used to called who never hit me back
Until they heard the word I was buzzing, c'mon don't give me that (Shit)
You backed out, now you tryna roll with my clique?
Where the fuck were you when my signing bonus was spent?
Where the fuck were you when I got the notice for rent
Saying I was getting evicted and I was hopeless as shit?
See I keep some names handy and you got thrown on the list
That's how you know that I'm pissed, I got you, don't even trip
'Cause I'm rude over the nicest beats, you had to go ignite the heat
You might agree to beef, but yo I'm not the type you'd like to meet
Life's indeed a journey that I have yet to finish
Hopefully my career's something that will be epidemic
You'll always know that it's Hopsin the way I wreck a sentence
Realness, I represent it, raw, I'm the definition
[Chorus: Chelsea Hopson & Hopsin]
You don't always have to stick by my side
Just make sure you remember me when I die
I am raw, I am raw
Just to let you niggas know
Bitch I am raw, I am raw
Don't forget me when I'm gone
Bitch I am raw"

King of rap, I can bet my money on that
Can't face the facts that a young guy killin' shit
Give me another shot and I'mma come with my mask on
Seen a lot of growth since I came with the Vans song
Now it's '09 and I'm runnin' with the Based God
Fire in my eyes, mix my soul with the napalm
Mix and master, all I need is dro and one mic
One pad, one pen, iPod, dim lights
Feelin' like a plane when it's up and it's in flight
Dressing everyday like I'm dead with the pinstripe
This a few things that show that I'm the rawest
Spend the cash everyday so I'm ballin like Spalding
Want beef, like six I’ll have you baldin' like Baldwin
Your favorite rapper out, I'mma lay 'em in a coffin
No talkin' when I'm talkin', cause it's legend, pay attention
Only time I sat in class was when I'm serving a detention
I fuck with Soulja Boy, get money nigga
Everytime I see rappers, all I'm thinking, I'm a get him
In the booth or in the streets, I'm known to tear and rip 'em
15 and 16, eyes breaking down the system
Nobody can tell me nothing, I was livin off my system
Head fucked up, I thought it would be cool to go to prison
Watching Hot Boyz on BET, getting all these women
So I got my gold grill because I'm thugged out with 'em
B-Town, Waterfront I put on for my city
We done did it for 6 years, just reached 20
A lot of dudes I grew up with didn't see 20
Everytime I have a birthday, I'm thinking God love me
Everytime I hit the beat, man I do it for my Mom
Workin' hard everyday I'mma make it where it's mine
I'mma hustle all the time, like Lil' Wayne do
If you' ever up against me, you get ate like grapefruit
My first reaction was like, just chill and stay cool
The rap game is slow and it just ain't cool
Always jockin all my style and it just ain't you
Only time I feel you, is if a based boy do
Because I'm a rap god and a based boy too
I can listen to the hate and put the volume on mute
So the only thing I hear is the horses in the coupe
And when the roof go down it reminds me of my chick
Getting money off the floor because ""I'm trapping like a bitch""
Like Gucci Mane said but it's rich nigga clique
And my name is Lil B, you can call me king of rap
I done did a few things and I'm never goin back
Mirror mirror on the wall, shit, I'm askin who the man is
Lil B for Lil Boss I'm prayin to my canvas
I deserve the crown because I'm speakin for the masses
And I'm into weed, I'm gettin chiefy like Kansas
Words to the wise, you should fear the competition
Because I'm the only vet that's a Based God spittin
And you ain't in the game until you make a thousand songs
And you dyin' for this rap, because it's the only thing you love

You look familiar
I swear I seen you some where before, are you sure
Are you sure we never met ?
Naw I'm not using it for some cheap pick up line
I really think you look familiar

Look she be calling my name
Screaming real loud I would think she's in pain
Niggas tried to tell me her head was insane
Everything she do it takes a toll on my brain
It seems a little strange but she be calling my name
Screaming real loud I would think she's in pain
Niggas tried to tell me her head was insane
Everything she do it takes a toll on my brain
It seems a little strange but she be calling my

[Verse 1]
She don't gotta a name, so for now lets call her Ashley
Had her gym clothes on, seen her when she passed me
Met her up in Exxon, body was the nicest
Cursing up a storm, she complaining 'bout the prices
She just left Toronto for Jerz, bought a condo
Know everything about her though we never had a convo
Pops wasn't around much, her mother raised her
Got so much in common that I don't like to face her
Her parents is dope heads, she dropped out of school too
Got the same tats at me and I found that unusual
Mad I smoke cigs stay they're bad for my own health
Said I'll never love me 'cause I don't love my own self
Gave me the ass the first night and I gladly tossed it
The best part was I didn't even have to ask for it
Her period don't ever come
And when I dick her down she always run

She be calling my name

[Verse 2]
She like to scream so the neighbors might hear her
For some reason like it in front of the mirror
Let me make it clearer, she be making strange request
And I ain't talking bout just pulling on her hair
She be saying choke me like I lost all respect
And every time I do marks show up on my neck
She say punch her, smack her like I'm an attacker
I say ""you a fool"", I say ""just do what I asked ya""
I be going slow until she tell me do it faster
Every time I'm out with her these nigga just harass her
I don't understand it, she so unattractive
Shorty looking terrible plus she come with baggage
I'd tap it, though she below my average, it deceives me
She be talking marriage, saying she'll never leave me
I say I'm gonna bounce but I say I don't believe me
She fucks me every time she sees me

[Verse 3]
I be wanting to strangle her, throw her off the balcony, dangle her mangle her, how long have I carried this anger for?
How come when we argue, we gotta get physical
We crucial conflict, she ends up in critical
Habitual, happens daily, it's our ritual
But show your face bitch stop being invisible
Is it just my mental? Is she just a symbol?
There for me to look at everything that I resemble
Sometimes during sex I blurt another name
Do that mean I look at me and be ashamed
I'm cheating on me with a hottie, with a body
Who so happen to embody everything I so happen to not be
I be trying to leave her but then I get lenient
And since I'm in this room alone, she become convenient
Then we lie together, cry together
I swear I hope we die together

She be calling my name
Screaming real loud I would think she's in pain
Niggas tried to tell me her head was insane
Everything she do it takes a toll on my brain
It seems a little strange but she be calling my name
Screaming real loud I would think she's in pain
Niggas tried to tell me her head was insane
Everything she do it takes a toll on my brain
It seems a little strange but she be calling my

[Verse 4]
I finally grew the balls to tell shorty we should separate
Save your breath, nothing you can do to make me hesitate
There's no room for me and you to grow
Don't love me and leave me alone, do both
Then she apologize for anything that she did
Said without me she can't think of no reason to live
Said she'll miss getting piped down, the she picked up a shank
I had to tell the crazy bitch to put the knife down
Crying, eye shadow on her face, Filthy
""feel me, if you kill you, it's gonna kill me""
Really, she said ""you neglect me"", I said ""we the same
So whatever you do is gone affect me""
You know I can't let it be
So if we got to stay together just to coexist then so it is
She said ""I love you"" then hugged me
Took her pants off and proceeded to fuck me

She be calling my name
Screaming real loud I would think she's in pain

I'm going to let you touch me in a special place
But I don't want to touch you there
It is never ok to touch someone else's private parts

[Verse 1: Bigg Jus]
Yo' eyes get, blind like 2Pac gettin shot in the lobby
Most MC's styles is robbery of my freestyles as a hobby
I pick apart monkey brains and spread disease through hot zones
My cameos on promos seem strange like someone's not home
Bigg Jus the outsider rain on your dream field
With styles so freaking wet niggas need maxi panty shields
Expose more moles out the closet than lead paint on your tenement
Got more Black Thought to my Roots than most niggas got in their pigment
It's the baby-faced lieutenant with the Luck like Luciano
Hardcore like Kool G Rap music made for concert piano
So dust off the candelabra, hip hop's version of the super Don Dada
With the license to give more ass whippings than Father
You couldn't see me with Minolta, way ahead of myself like telepathy
Make most crews disappear like blackheads on Oxy creme
Under the lights I fuck up mics with my uncanny ability to heat seek
Through brain facilities with the science of microchemistry
This history of my hip hop is too deep to be dissected
(Bitch!) if you can’t recollect don’t even half step or try to test it (black)
Bigg Jus, I drop so much shit my anus needs an ice pack
In fact I'm all that, El-P yo bring the horns back

Surface bombs from X-wing fighters, stance to B-boy actors fracture
Negative thirty below wind chill factor
The counteraction is just a helpless action of the hapless flinching
My supersonics leave you mute like Maggie Simpson
Taxidermist El-P, I defy translation
Instigator settin' quakes throughout your whole situation
Practice exposing perfection like Ricki Lake exposes white trash
My shit is strange X-file number 2-6-7 whiplash
Triple felon emcee minus the melanin
When I bomb with the type of shit to make Baby Jessica jump in the well again
Sunshines on rain acid, El-P the battle master
Lactose breaking down your fucking fractals till you're flaccid
I'm leaving Las Vegas like a hundred flying Elvises
Raid, spot my prey, swoop down and crush their pelvises
Rat nerve like David grill smoke bitch
Catch my frozen frame suspended
You couldn't even fuck with my idle fidget
By birthright I'm pulling swords from stones high tone beam
Phonetically abort it try to distort it and catch a silent scream, fetus
The raw daddy tactics prove Krush Groove unstoppable
Test your luck it's like sucking on lead paint popsicles
The enigma, no one can fuck with me but still I'm not signed

Get Down,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Salaam Remi]

[Chorus: James Brown sample]
Get, get, get down!

[Verse 1: Nas]
Uh.. uh.. uh..
New York streets where killers'll walk like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starvin'
Pushin' cars, Nicky Barnes was the '70s
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities
Worldwide on the thorough side of things
Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time
One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon, I turned while he asked me
""What you up to? The cops gon' bust you.""
I was a teen drunk off brew
Stumbled I wondered if God sent him
'Cause two squad cars entered the block
And looked at us; I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
Starin' at a young disciple
I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah man, throwin' them bones
Hopin' my ace get his case thrown
His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein'
While he lookin' at centerfolds of pretty girls showin'
They little cooch; gangstas don't die, he's living proof
The D.A. who tried him was lyin'
A white dude, killed his mother during the case
Hung jury, now the D.A. is being replaced
Pre-trial hearing is over, it's real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild
Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle
I wanna crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for Black Power, 'cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin'
Then he grabbed the judge, screams out, ""Nobody leavin'
Everybody—""
[Chorus: James Brown sample]
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!
Everybody
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!

[Verse 2: Nas]
Some niggas fuck their enemies in their ass when they catch 'em
Weird-ass niggas who dangerous so don't test 'em
They make you disappear, this a year that I won't forget
Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs
Southern niggas, independent label, real killers
Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin'
They had the coke game somethin' crazy
Sold music out the trunk of their car, that shit amazed me
Put me onto her-on blunts, sherm or somethin'
Took a puff, what the fuck? I turned to punch him
Southern niggas ain't slow, nigga tried to play me
I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy
Now I'm back around the old school that raised me
New York gangsters, we loungin', out in L.A. see
A dude wrote my dog from Pelican Bay
The letter say, ""Nas, I got your back, the fools don't play.""
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral
Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho
Responsible; the nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See, my cousin's in the game, thuggin' and thangs
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up, I'm a mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile
Shoulda never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed
Openin' the hotel room door to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids
See honey thought I had somethin' to do with all the drama
'Cause I was with a crew that had her people killed
Called up my cousin, told him I ain't fuckin' with you
He responded ""cool,"" but told me out here this how motherfuckers—
[Chorus: James Brown sample]
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!

Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!

[Outro: Salaam Remi]
All I really gotta say is that
If that's how our people gon' get down, how we ever gon' get up?
How we ever gon' get up if that's how we get down?

I am going to play for you our first tune tonight it s going to be about four tunes
And the first tune, here it goes
1, 2, 3

[Verse 1: Chiddy]
Now when them fights go down
Them lights go down
In villas and the village people might be round
They say that all the people gonna like me now
Because I talk about the issues in this life we found
All through the country people gettin' slain
Priority religion disobey, get hanged
I know some little kids quick to get militant
Just give them packs of the gun
They really feel the clips
They told me not to worry bout the struggle
And they don't gotta worry cause it's subtle
Tell 'em about the government takin' away the light
Aviation is ruined they say when you take a flight
Say when you take the continent from the white man threw
White man colonize wealth can't do
They fly G5 but they gotta land too
We explode like the landmines that they ran through
[Hook]
Oooooo, OOooooo OOooo OOOO
Oooooo, OOooooo OOooo OOOO

[Verse 2: Chiddy]
So we try palm trees in the sky
It's a beautiful day
I am just happy to be alive
I am playin' with slingshots with renewable goods
Think you got it tough because you're in the hood, negative
I am positive you would be in upset mode
When you wear the same thing like you got a dress code
I guess I am guilty of being privileged
Cause while I am in the booth my cousin is in the village
I seen a boy with no father
His mom ain't around, life's harder
Picked up soccer he tryin' to go farther
Hair is a mess can't find him no barber
And this is what its like
When you ain't got a life
I'm all they got left
But they trying to do right
And they feel my plight
They giving them insight
I know we gotta win
So then fly me a kite
[Hook]
Oooooo, OOooooo OOooo OOOO
Oooooo, OOooooo OOooo OOOO

[Verse 3: Chiddy]
We get by, the weather is just right
Say good morning when I see you
Cause I gotta be polite
And I am livin' something different
Cause this can't be the life
You don't got a chance so you better focus on your plans
I try to grind like children that sell pure water
The land of the lawless muy slaughter
Negotiate your price I'll take your offer
In the market where they sell them what did that cost her
I try to chase the gold out here
But honestly its bumpy like the roads out here
And I advise if your salary is handsome
Vulu feli feli they will hold you for ransom
If you gotta take a glimpse of my family life
You will lose your mind Chris Brown on Grammy night
And this is what the news don't show
There is nothing on the plate so the dudes the dude's don't grow

[Hook]
Oooooo, OOooooo OOooo OOOO
Oooooo, OOooooo OOooo OOOO
[Outro: Chiddy]
Yeah, you see what this is man
We done came through all types of os
We still got people out there now
You know what I am saying
I am doing this for my cousin Remi

(R-A what's the lesson for today Rugged Man
I am the legendary... R-A)

[Verse 1]
Yo, ayo people wondering where the fuck I been
At the VIP section they ain't letting me in
They say ""maybe if you had Dr. Dre or Timbaland""
They say ""a white boy need a black boy to win
Uhh Bubba Sparxx did it and so did Slim
Just Blaze is hot now why don't you get with him""
I watch mad rappers bite my shit and blow up
And make millions of what I created, that's tough luck
I first started getting coverage around the same time
Steve Stoute used to carry Kid n Play's luggage
I seen rappers turned from sex symbols and heartthrobs
To being forgotten now they out looking for jobs
I seen EPMD break up
I seen my little brother Maxx fall asleep and he ain't never wake up
So when I rhyme listen, seriously
When I spit I'm giving you the truth clearly who I really be
It's an audio version of reality TV
I had deals from Russell Simmonds to Master P
Even five year old white girls be rapping today
On the playground like ""go shorty it's ya birthday"" (Go, go, go)
[Hook]
(Here's a little story I got to tell)
(I am the legendary
R-A Rugged Man)

[Verse 2]
Yo yo I seen good days, sun rays, church sundays
Made love, made war, been rich, been poor
Lost friends, lost lawsuits, lost my dough
Seen beef between Bad Boy and Death Row
I seen disease take the life for my sister's kid
Six months on the Earth is what he had to live
I seen Biggie, Big L, Big Pun pass away
Buffy from the Fat Boys, Jam Master Jay
A month before they blew up with Mystikal and Jay Z
The Neptunes came to see me at D&D
I knew this chick named Norah, a lounge singer
A year later she a six Grammy award winner
I seen Flatlinerz, I seen cannabisses
I seen Lil Zane, yo I seen mad misses
You Antoinette-ass bitches get ten percent disses
I seen A&R's get fired for taking pisses
Stop whining and bitching, nobody listens
Who else risking they career sticking to be indifferent
Switching the tradition sticking to this shit they really living?
I don't care what's hitting
Listen this is my mothafucking life that I'm spitting
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm at peace with myself now how 'bout that?
I hated life, I wanted to die a few years back
I was mentally ill it's hard to come back from that
But I got through it now, I got my sanity back
Y'all are like H-B-O fighters, get the money and fame
Get beat up like Klitschko and Sugar Shane
Or get beat like Vernon Forrest or Prince Naseem
And you all turn pussy once you get that green
I got love for Havoc from Mobb Deep
When I was broke sleeping in the street
He hooked me up with a free beat
Alchemist you still my little buddy
Even though you stole that Royce Da 5'9"" ""The King"" beat from me
I ain't down to sign autographs and shake ya hands
I don't want trendy ass followers for fans
I don't wanna sell records, I don't wanna be big
I don't want MTV running up in my crib
I don't wanna be liked in the music biz
I don't want fans that don't know who G Rap is

Let's stab 'em, let's stick 'em, let's get 'em, get all of his spendings
Grab him and flip it while Killa get all of the women

Sorry I'm limpin', I'm just frontin', ya'll
Ya tittes, I'll touch 'em, I'll kiss 'em, I'll hug 'em, I'll suck 'em (Suck 'em)
If I'm with a chick, most likely I'm trying to fuck 'em (Fuck 'em)
Not tryin' cuff 'em, tryin' to duck 'em

Diss me? Y'all a dime a dozen
No time for buzzin', beat it, go find a husband, shit
That'll trick on you, buy you a ton of clothes (Clothes)
I'm at the Tunnel, they let in 500 hoes (500 hoes? Let's go)
I'm at the bar, see shorty is bent
My ratio up in here, fuck, 40 percent, shit
Drinkin' sour Amaretto, yo, whatever
Forever, but won't stop my cheddar

[Chorus]
To all my cats with the ice who don't need no wife
We getting head tonight (Whatever)
To all my honeys that stall, give a dummy a call
Get his money and ball (Whatever)
To all my cats in the club who be dead at the bar
We gettin' head in the car (Whatever, gettin' head in the car)
To all my women whippin' a Jeep, gettin' the suite
Have 'em lickin' your feet (Whatever)
[Outro]
And I don't care how bad no chick is
I ain't licking nobody feet (Whatever)

You gon' back that thing up or should I push up on it?
Temperature risin', okay, let's go to the next level
Dance floor jam-packed, hot as a tea kettle
I'll break it down for you now, baby, it's simple
If you be a nympho, I be a nympho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasin' you 'bout how sprung I got you
Wanna show me you could work it, baby? No problem
Get on top, then get to bounce around like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat, you could play with the stick
I'm tryin' to explain, baby, the best way I can
I'll melt in your mouth, girl, not in your hand (Ha-ha)

The things we do (Things we do)
Are just between me and you, yeah (Oh yeah)

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Give it to me, baby, nice and slow
Climb on top, ride like you in a rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
'Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door
She get to pullin' on my zipper
It's like it's a race, who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?
Had me thinkin' 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stoppin', homie, and I ain't stoppin'
Drippin' wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin'
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on
And we gon' sip 'til every bubble in every bottle is gone
[Chorus: 50 Cent & Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead, girl, don't you stop
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa
I'll take you to the candy shop
Want one taste of what I got?
I'll have you spendin' all you got
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead, girl, don't you stop
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa

What It Do,Lupe Fiasco,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Somethin' new
Geah, uh
Believe me like you saw me on TV
My name is Lu, somethin' new
I show you what it does (what it does)
How it is (how it is)
And what it do (what it, do)

[Verse 1]
I saw it on TV, I was told to buy a CD
The CD told me buy a TV
The TV that I bought came with a CD that said go and buy the DVD
The DVD that I bought came with a CD
Which was the DVD of the makin' of the TV, that I saw
Which told me to go and buy the CD in the first place, wait nah
I put the DVD in the TV so you can see what I saw
But wait, it's a CD so you can't see me, odd
Maybe I should just come out on DVD like CB, far
With mad special effects and maybe a CG, car
To ride around in on your TV
Bumpin' the CD that I got when I copped the TV
Which is the same TV in my car
[Hook]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
It’s somethin' new
What up homeboys my name is Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu
I show you what it is, what it did and it what it do

[Verse 2]
My DVD is gonna come with a CD, too
And music I recorded through a CB
You see when I bought the TV I spent the money for the microphone and
The home recorders too
And the foam that you need for your crew (crew)
That blocks out the noise when your voice's recording you (you)
Tell 'em to be quiet 'til the voice recording through (through)
Garage band file then export to iTunes
Then burn a CD and put it in the CG car that you saw on your TV
But you ain't gotta do that at all you see
Cuz the whole CD is being broadcasted on CB, dog
Break up break up, eh hee haw
They can't do what they see me do
But I'm the dude that's easy/Eazy too
Like I'm Eazy Juniorrrrrr
When the CD starts, better tune in
Or you gotta watch the reruns
Homie this is food for thought
Better put it on your fork like GD Hooverrrrrrrr-ah
[Hook]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
It’s somethin' new
What up homeboys my name is Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu
I show you what it is, what it did and it what it do (do, do, do, do, do)
What up homegirls my name is Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu
I show you what it is, what it did and it what it do (do, do, do, do, do)

[Verse 3]
Now that's two TV's that's in my car
That’s not really real man that's really a fraud
It’s from the green screen
My CD might not pump on your block
But at the truck stop man I'm really a star
So how you gonna act now?
Same music homeboys hollin' in the background (yo!)
See I had to lay the smack down
Act like a X addict
Act now gateway off to the next habitat (habitat)
Couldn’t match it now I'm laying that down like a mat now (ooh!)
And checkin’ for me, now they pat down like a Howard Gap found
I was hidin' in my shoes, with me and my two crews
We took from other things you ain't finding in the stew
That’s why's no booth and I'm rhymin' in the Lou, still buying the CD
That’s why I catch 'em rhymin' in to me while they rhymin' in they room
Now I'm off to Caloon for some rhymin' and some tea
My pinky up on my tea cup
If you play the DVD at the same time that you start the CD
You gon' see that they sync up
And if you happen to doubt, just play the CD while you watch the TV
And you gon' see that I'm doing what I'm rappin' about
[Hook]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
It’s somethin' new
What up homeboys my name is Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu
I show you what it is, what it did and it what it do (do, do, do, do, do)
What up homegirls my name is Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu
I show you what it is, what it did and it what it do (do, do, do, do, do)"

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
This house is stupid perp, they cost me half a rack
AK half a stack, so we ain't gon hit back
I'm at the gambling house, I won 'bout eighty bands
And went to Magic City and did the rain dance
I'm the cave man, stupid band man
Rubber band man, I'm Extra Gram Sam
A stupid fruity sack, a stupid fruity pack
Crazy Gucci shoes, where you get 'em at?
I said it's all white, 'bout a fifty pack
The hottest nigga in the nation ain't dropped yet
Where them pots at? Where them Glocks at?
I kick the door in, where them plots at?

Old school's cool, but most of ours new
Gesundheit, bitch, we got the bird flu

Nocturnal Rainbows,Hopsin,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
You think you're original? You ain't original
You were programmed to be you
You're a slave, and you don't even know it
The shit you think of, ain't even your thoughts
Let's step out the box for a minute!

[Verse 1]
How do we know if God exists? How do we know it's positive?
Are you the definition of an angel or the opposite?
If you lost your wallet and I found it, I would not commit to stealin' it
But if the tables turned, then you would pocket it
See, I been me for so long, but I still don't know who Hopsin is
How come I'm the one my teachers used to have a problem with?
I show my music to different labels, they ain't too fond of it
But in the underground I seem to get so many compliments
Say my name and it's like people get afraid and shook
But if you take a look, you'll see I'm nothin' like an angry crook
I'm learnin' hands-on, you busy with your face in books
I'm here to benefit the world, so Heaven's where we're safely put
I'm not a devil, not speakin' in tongues
I just wanna touch your heart, I try to reach it in songs
I'm from where a child's future's on the streets with the bums
Because it's hard to become somethin' so unique where I'm from
[Chorus]
When the sun's down
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
It may seem so that I can't see
But the darkness provides the light for me
I don't wanna be lonely
And the moon is my only homie
If there's a higher power, then show me
Instead of nocturnal rainbows

[Verse 2]
Obama's president, so? What's he represent?
Just because the nigga's half black don't mean he's Heaven-sent
You're clueless to evidence and all the minds he's messin' with
His charmin' smile hasn't got my ass up out this debt for shit
Frontin' like he's truly Jesus, and all you fools believe it
The change he's makin' isn't good, that's just how you conceived it
It's like we're all broker than ever, it's due to reasons
Dealin' with self-beneficial plans and the movement he's with
Illuminati, or whatever the fuck they go by
They're the reason weird shit happens and we don't know why
Why did Michael Jackson start his tour, then have to go die?
How did rap music go from really good to so dry?
Real artists get shelved and wack ones get famous
To leave masses brainless, a smart mind is dangerous
In their eyes; there probably ain't no real shit in your playlist
You're just a product of what the government has created
[Chorus]
When the sun's down
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
It may seem so that I can't see
But the darkness provides the light for me
I don't wanna be lonely
And the moon is my only homie
If there's a higher power then show me
Instead of nocturnal rainbows

[Verse 3]
Yo, we're all smart, and we know what's bad and good for us
But yet, when you got offered some marijuana, you took a puff
Your brain's a fuckin' powerhouse, but what, that wasn't good enough?
It's people like you who talk that ""shoulda, coulda, woulda"" stuff
You probably threw your life away ‘cause you would rather get high
With no license or car, so you bum rides to get by
Sayin', ""I should've did this"" or ""I shouldn't have hung with this guy.""
""I'm broke as fuck, my rent's high. Ah, I should've realized.""
I ain't bein' cruel with these situations that I address
I more than likely could be someone you admire, yes
But it's because the blood, sweat and all the time that I invest
We play the same game, difference is you never try your best
You don't have a skill, you set yourself up for a higher mess
I work around the clock, you slack off for lots of time to rest
Keep bullshittin' till your life is gone
‘Cause livin's naturally hell, you have to work to put a smile on
[Chorus]
When the sun's down
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
It may seem so that I can't see
But the darkness provides the light for me
I don't wanna be lonely
And the moon is my only homie
If there's a higher power then show me
Instead of nocturnal rainbows

[Chorus]
When the sun's down
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
It may seem so that I can't see
But the darkness provides the light for me
I don't wanna be lonely
And the moon is my only homie
If there's a higher power then show me
Instead of nocturnal rainbows

Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high"

I'm militant, I'm very Based, I'm very proper
You want the war, you bring your troops, I'll bring the choppers
You niggas gay, yeah, you gay, you fuckin' faggot
I'm head first, with 30 rounds I let them have it
Battlefield with fast cash, you never grab it
I post up with big blunts and Maseratis
Rick Ross, the new whip is Big Body
New Boys, you bitch-niggas I been Rocky
Been cocky, ask Josh, I been active
Ride a bus, with long straps, no riff-raff
Then you drive cars, we hold guns, Dodge Magnum
Yes, tragic how he left with no comments
Never settle for nigga-rich, I'm gonna rob em
Catch me slippin' with tiny pants, you think I'm nerdy
.45 got nice aim; I throw curvy
My game, I run court, I'm James Worthy
From the block, I'm from the bricks like New Jersey
I did court, I did jail, you can't hurt me
Waterfront the fam nigga, it's West Berkeley
And they ask where I been, I been rappin'
You drive cars, you fuckin' fag, I been gassin'
In my eyes is blood, sweat and pain, cuz
It's a shame that they don't know my name, Blood
Lil B: I blow trees in all seasons
Think I'm slippin? Find out! For no reason
Met pain, I met God, I met death
They all said I'm BasedGod, and that's that
Spit sick, I spit rhymes, I spit facts
I'm not Drake, I ain't come in the game rich
Fuck you if you don't feel my game, bitch
Fuck you if you don't like my name, bitch
BasedGod tell your girl, she could suck on it
Put money on God and I bust on him
Don't hate! I rock out like Philly rock
Real street, like a New York City block
Beat your ass like a New York City cop
Flipmode, a Rah Digga, a mind-figure
Fuck crackers, fuck hoes & fuck niggas
Fuck her, fuck you & fuck me
Lil B: I'm back bitch, I spit heat
Post up, I sell dimes and fat zips
Got crack: the cats come like catnip
Don't trip: I never fold like napkins
Real goon, I'm just Robbin' like Baskins
Anthrax a real boy like Osama
Been played, I been beat, I love drama
X-Man on defense, it's street shit
Riding up in deep tints & deep dish
Never thought I'd come hard? I fooled you!
Been watchin', I cursed you it's Voodoo
Been locked in, Mach-10s and Mac-10s
Leave his head split and no Cochran to back him
Don't you niggas wish I'd fall off the Big League?
At my lowest point, sacrifice to make bread
XMR - call your bitch and get head
She don't really like you: possum, she play dead
Riding up top. Real niggas and big blocks
Say the pack dead? bitch nigga the pack hot
All these new niggas is my sons, the new boys
Fuck you rap niggas: new guns and new toys
Infrared beam make you dream, then POOF!, boy
Semi-auto rounds make you scream like Luke, boy
Only other thing that I ain't did is die yet
I don't like that mindset, nigga, it's the grind-set
Don't wear a watch, cause it could be your time next
You not a threat: my rap flow is bomb threats
Stay in your house: I'm stampeding with death threats
Shit, think you hard?: I bust a nut like good sex
Think you real? A Bay nigga, a hood vet
Lil B: I'm BasedGod with no stress
Incest, fuck your bruh and fuck your bitch
No homo.. fuck your life, I'm getting rich
Mexican: I'm illegal, I move bricks
No love, I dog hoes like new pits

Fluently speak it

Watch the Pistons against the Bulls on the floor with the mascot
Dancin', fly as Helly Hansen on our shoulder blades

Drink until I gotta piss, damn I got a lot of chicks
Take another sip of what I'm drinkin'

Renee,Lost Boyz,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Here's a tune about this honey named Renee that I met one day
On my way back from John Jay
I'm peeping shorty as she's walking to the train
I tap her on her shoulders
""Excuse me miss, but can I get your name?""
She said, my name is Renee
I said I got a whole lot to say, so may I walk you to your subway?
She said if you want, so yo, we started talking
I bought two franks and two drinks and we began walking
I had to see where that head was at cause her gear was mad fat
So we must chat about this and that
She told me what she was in school for
She wants to be a lawyer, in other words, shorty studies law
I'm telling shorty I'm a writer
And as she's looking for the token, she drops a package of the EZ Wider
Covers her mouth with her name ring
I said, yo don't sweat the technique, shorty rocks, I do the same thing
But yet I use Philly blunts
She said, ""I never dealt with Philly blunts
Because I heard that's for silly stunts""
I said nah they burn slower
Right now I really don't know ya
But maybe later on, I can get to show you
[Hook]
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty

[Verse 2]
So now we sitting on the train
Besides her fingernails, now shorty got the hairdo of pain
Now understand she got flava
A tough leather jacket with some jeans and a chain that her moms gave her
Got off the train about 6:34
She wasn't sure she had grub for the dog, so we hit the store
Went to the crib and turned the lights on
A mad magazine stand
From Essence to Right On
A leather couch, stereo system with crazy CDs
Understand, kid, she got G's
She said Cheeks, do what you want
She said I'm gonna feed the dog
I said, alright well I'ma roll this blunt
She came back with stretch pants and a ponytail, a t-shirt
A yo, fam I got a tender-roni girl
We're sitting on the couch chatting
We're smoking blunts off the balcony
We're staring at Manhattan now
She started feeling on my chest
I started feeling on the breasts
And there's no need for me to stress the rest
A yo, I got myself a winner
We sparked a blunt before we ate and a blunt after we ate dinner
She had a tattoo she only wanted go to see
But first dim the lights and turn up the Jodeci
I'm like whatever, shorty rock, we can swing it like that
'Cause on the real this is where it's at
[Hook]
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty

[Verse 3]
I woke up the next day on the waterbed
A letter's on the pillow and this what the letter said
It said, ""Cheeks, I'll be home around two
You was deep in your sleep so I didn't want to bother you""
I left my number for shorty to call me later
Got dressed, smoked a blunt, and then I bounced towards the elevator
I got a beep around three
I'm asking shorty what's up with you, she's asking what's up with me
And now we been together for weeks
Candlelight dinner with my shorty, crack a forty with my naughty freaks
Hey man, I never been in love
But every time I'm burstin' in and outta state, it's Shorty that I'm thinking of
I'm hanging out with my crew
I get a beep from Renee because Renee uses Code Two
But yet I'm chattin' with her mom dukes
She says ""Renee has been shot, so Cheeks, meet me up at St. Luke's""
I jumps on the Van Wyck, I gotta make it there quick
Ay yo , this shit is gettin' mad thick
Not even thinking about the po-nine
I'm doing a buck, who gives a fuck, I'm smokin' boom and the whole nine
I gotta see what's going on
But by the time I reach the hospital, they tell me ""Mr. Cheeks, Renee is gone""
I'm pouring beer out for my Shorty who ain't here
I'm from the ghetto, so listen, this is how I shed my tears
[Hook]
A ghetto love is the law that we live by

[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
My child
I even be getting more graphic than a Neo-Geo thirty-two-bit
Computer chip be slipped between my lips, and then I’ll spit!
Spit it out, spit it out, go ahead, spit it out, that itty-bitty style you upchuck
Better believe I butt-fuck emcees from the rear, it appears you’re stuck-up!
It’s my terminology that strike the mind and rips this beat apart
You know the many styles I choose will bruise crews from the start
I flow, awkwardly—that’s awkwardly I flow that’s to the rhythm
Incisions are made into the brain, and then I begin to give ‘em a lobotomy
Follow me, I’m shaping your brain like pottery all over the track
Gimme the P-H, gimme the A-R, gimme the O-A, gimme the H-E, Pharoahe!
Crazy poison-tip arrows are hitting you from all directions
You cannot dodge or manage to dislodge them from the point at which they are connecting
I am se-se-selecting a ne-ne-ne-ne-new style-style fo-fo-for
Pile-piles of emcees who try to get bu-bu-buck-buckwild
F-f-f-fuck that!
When I’m in a renovative state of mind, I’m innovative
Never been afraid of rocking a microphone, I’m prone to be eliminating
Cling when I sing a song of sixpence, if it makes sense, then sing along
Cling along to my nuts if you got guts then bring it on

[Verse 2: Prince Poetry]
There is no equivalent one, consider me the epitome of rhymes
Rhythm of TECs execution is parallel to them with an exception of the organisms
My telepathy cannot be dismantled, so stop sweating me
Advanced data, now watch your greater updates and raps get trampled
Fee-fi-fo steps of elevation show
That I’m ahead of your time, specifically right behind a dope rhyme
Ripping shit up at primetime, I’m Optimus Primetime material
Imperial wizard of vocabularic havoc, I eat emcees like cereal
That’s soggy, milky skills like Mister Miyagi
When it’s foggy, I release globby spits of remains of rappers in a lobby as a hobby
I’ll rip your knit, shit gets thick quick, get your crew
Before I do something gory to your quite futile styles
Miniature raps get waxed, simonized
Into the fifth dimension of your centrifugal, never typical—stand attention, I’m
Mystical, rip shit ‘til the power blows
Those chose to compete, we delete ‘em—observe defeat
Descending down from above to get cha, hit cha, split cha, ditch cha
Picture you victorious? I’m gory plus your shit’s mad boring
Bring it on

The fiends need me, I ain't around, they bones ache
Detox, rehab, cold sweats, watch them shake
I'm not that genie in a bottle, I'm in a bag
Take one hit and slide off to the Land of H, man
When we first met, I thought you'd never doubt me
Now, you tryna leave me, you never live without me
Girl, I'm missing you, come and see me soon
Tie your arm up, put that lighter under that spoon
Now, put that needle to your arm princess, stick it in, relapse
I'm back, bitch—don't ever try that
All the shit I did for you, I made you feel good
We have a love thing, you treatin' this like it's just a fling
What we have is more sacred than a vow or a ring
You broke my heart, you dirty bitch, I won't forget what you did
If you give birth, I'll already be in love with your kids
Listen, I don't give a damn if your ass starts smokin'
But we have a bond that is not to be broken

Heard she bisexual, she fuck with that girl
But boy, oh boy, fucking wit me is a whole 'nother world
After that first night she fall in love, then chase the feelin
I hung out with Marvin when he wrote ""Sexual Healing""
Kurt Cobain—we were good friends; Ozzy Osbourne, too
I be with rock stars—see, you lucky I'm fucking with you
I chilled with Frankie Lymon and Jimi Hendrix crew
See, this is new to you, but to me, this ain't new
I live the lavish life; listen, if the mood is right
Me, you, and your sister can do the do tonight
I never steer you wrong; if you hyper, I make you calm
I'll be your incentive, a reason for you to move forward
Let's make a date, promise me you'll come to see me
Even if it means you have to sell your mama's TV
I love you—love me back; no one said loving me'd be easy

[Verse 3]
I got you barefooted on glass, chasing a dove
That monkey on your back symbolizes my love
Your friends talk bad about me, bitch, you sit there and listen to 'em
Over and over you hurt me, my love is unconditional
They talk to you when you up; when you down, they got nothing to say
But when you call up, I come running, I always take the pain away
They set you up to let you down; they crowned you prom queen
They know 'bout me; behind your back, they call you a fucking fiend
Can we just be alone so I can kiss and hug you?
Push me inside you; no other man can love you like I do
Call me Daddy, I'll make you feel good, I mean, real good
I find pleasure in pleasing you like a real man should
It was written long before us; it was carved in a tree
Forever, me and you, baby, we were meant to be
There's more to life than laughter; what brought us together was fate
And we'll be hand in hand when you walk through those pearly gates
And to see to that, I'ma do whatever it takes

RANT,Bo Burnham,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","I went to a Catholic school for four years, and I also went on  GarageBand, uh, for 20 minutes, and this is the product of that. Hit it

All the seats at the Sunday masses
Filled with the masses' massive asses
Classes pass as fast as molasses
Ceremonial reading glasses

Read a little bit of Leviticus
All the kids are a little too little for this
All the parents nod in agreement
""I think I can vaguely see what He meant.""

It's too early in the morning, glory
To read another allegory story
The father reads a little bit farther
Assuring the assured that they need not bother

""When God, in verse 45
Said that slaves are okay to buy
He meant that people all from the start
Each have 'slaves' within their hearts:
Things that we have sold or boughten
That are forced to pick our moral cotton
God calls us to set these free
Free our hearts from slavery
And then as God goes on to explain
The logistics of buying and selling slaves
Uh...he...the bible's sorta like...uhhh...there's like...typos...didn't-""
In the back, I sit and I nod
To the beats that are bumping from my iPod
My God, they're starting to pray
And over the music I can hear them say
""Dear God, dear Lord, dear vague muscular man with a beard or a sword
Dear good, all-seeing being
'My way or the highway' Yahweh
The blue-balled anti-masturbator
The great all-loving faggot-hater
I'd like to thank your holy might
For making me both rich and white
And though this is your day of rest
I come to you with one request:
There's so much pain beyond this steeple
Wars and drugs and homeless people
Sadness where there should be joy
Hate and rape and Soulja Boy
A world in darkness needs your light
So I'm sure your schedule's pretty tight
But my dog just had surgery
If you could fix that first?

Debra Messing's finger's in a holy place
Hail Mary full of Grace
Obama, could you pass some hope to the Pope?
I know a couple dudes who wanna elope
See the church said nope so the bros can't cope
The bros can grope but the bros can't cope
They've been in love and they've been addicted
Who said they shouldn't? Benedict did
'Cause in the holy land of the Lord
He's the holy landlord
And dicks are evicted
'Cause you can be a Benedict
If you've been a dick under Benedict
But you can't have Benedicts
Because there's only one pope
With only one dick, what?
What? Yeah, a dick on a pope is
Just like a soap on a rope
'Cause it's pointless, unless in prison
Throw up your bibles, Christ has risen

Hallelujah, now it's raining men
Because the gender ratio is 1 to 10
Winos at the Eucharist station, trans-gendered-substantiation

Get back, I'm a heretic and I'm on fire
It was Oedipus, those holy nights

On a crusade to cruise aids

Dr. Aden,B.o.B,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[B.o.B - Verse 1]
Well this is the mysterious case of Dr. Aden
Looking after her patients was her only obligation but
That was back before, back before the situation
Before she got a visit from an agent
He introduced himself as an employee of the nation
He asked would she be willing to offer cooperation
You fit the job description and all the qualifications
If interested I need your signature on this paper (sign here)
She signed the dotted line without the slightest hesitation
She then received a letter stating the rules and regulations
And the military bases where she must be relocated
She is not to discuss any business thats work related

[News Clips - Talking]

[B.o.B - Verse 2]
In Central America on a classified location
Before border control before a illegal immigration
Inside a lab where chemicals are manipulated
Is where we see Dr. Aden, she’s very concentrated
But her concentrations broken
When she hears a conversation down the halls
Small talk about destabilization and
Outta curiosity she wanders from her station
Inside a unlocked office she did some investigation
She breaks into a file with top secret information
Probably some of the most disturbing documentation
She ever saw in her life - the article simply stated
Her study being conducted on human civilization
[News Clips - Talking]

[B.o.B - Verse 3]
Deep down inside she wished it was all her imagination
She couldn’t doubt it, cause there it clearly stated
She works in a facility where viruses are created
And not only that, but ‘member when she had her patients
She wrote out prescriptions for what she thought was medication
Her office was really just a part of the operation
She wipes her eyes as they water full of frustration
How a victim of government experimentation
Where's the justification, where's the justification
Where's the judge when you need him
He's probably on a vacation
Probably inside of the same country that these events takes place in
But as the puzzle pieces fall into proper arrangement
Yes we began to see the intentions of these creations
The patterns of epidemics like H.I.V. in the 80′s
Biological chemicals designed to be contagious
There’s nothing in the business of controlling a population"

With a house full of dames like it was Moulin
I would ask they names, but they would only do Sean
And I ain't sayin they regret it, but fuck it, they do
'Cause if they could reverse time, nigga
What would they do, huh?
[Chorus]
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit, raspy shit
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit
And don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit
Tryna ask me shit, c'mon

[Verse 3]
Honeys Panamanian, eyes like Iranian
Lighter than the blue of the sky of the day we in
Ass like a volleyball, the kind that make your dick hard
Head to the hustlers, so sweet she could get cars
Now she here with me, lil' Skateboard P
Cheaper than the sound of a bird that chirps
I spit, then I hit, then I murk, yessir
A flick chico stick and a Twix, that's her
She admire how the champion live
How I signed Slim Thug with a ramp in my crib
I'm a champion, I do as the champions did
Except I improve with the new and the rest get rid
But some of y'all don't like that, it's easy tryna bite back
Instead of sayin' hi, gettin' fly, but I'll be right back
My dude got the steel if you think you fly
Shoot the wings off your ego and watch you skydive, yessir

[Chorus]
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit, raspy shit
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit
And don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit
Tryna ask me shit, c'mon"

You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time, you won't seduce me

[Pre-Chorus]
She's saying ""That's okay
Hey baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need""
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says ""There's no turning back""
She trapped me in her heart

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!
Oh no, oh no, oh no

She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan
After the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree

[Pre-Chorus]
She's saying ""That's okay
Hey baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star""

'Cause I'm real tired, you see
But I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me?""
I said ""My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright""

[Pre-Chorus]
Diana walked up to me
She said, ""I'm all yours tonight""
At that, I ran to the phone
Saying, ""Baby, I'm alright""
I said ""But unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key""
She said ""He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me""

You could have any dude in this world but chose me (oh ...)
You could have any chick in this world but chose her
To play the backseat and direct the chauffeur
And that ain't just Jazz, ain't down with Okur (I could)
I play publicist and give her exposure

Body like a porn star (whoa, whoa), smile like a waitress
Now she turnin me, uh, uh, on, uh, uh, on, uh, uh, on
I mean, why get Club Bed or Club Med? See
We can just club in the bed of my club mansion
Leave for the weekend, jet to the Hamptons

Little bit of cologne, little bit of Patron is how I got her on

Like we both ain't grown (yeah!)
Wrist kind of heavy, I'm a little well known
Matching crosses, different color stones
See, in one line I got her to come over
Told her I'm dumb sober, but hungover!
She play the club, sippin on Mimosa
I could fit your whole crew in one Rover
Just kick your shoes off 'fore you step in

Horse Outside,Rubberbandits,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
I'm at Amanda's wedding, in a church on Thomas Street
I'm lookin' at a bridesmaid, and she lookin' back at me
And when the service ends, I ask her if she wants a lift
Back to the hotel, and if it goes well, finger and a shift
She says Fitzy drives a Mitzy, and he offered me a spin
Enda have a Honda, so I might just go with him
And Darragh Gibney said he bring me in his Subaru
So what the fuck would make you think I'd wanna go with you

I said fuck your Honda Civic, I've a horse outside
Fuck your Subaru, I have a horse outside
And fuck your Mitsubishi, I've a horse outside
If you're lookin' for a ride I've a horse outside

She said I don't believe ya
I said it's fuckin' true
I swapped him for a bag of yokes in 1992
And I don't need insurance, I don't need no parkin' space
And if you try to clamp my horse he'll kick you in the face
I don't pay no tax, fuck NCT
You'll arrive in style if you ride with me
And the boys are walkin' over, jinglin' their keys
I look the fuckers up and down and give them one of these

I said fuck your Honda Civic, I've a horse outside
Fuck your Subaru, I have a horse outside
And fuck your Mitsubishi, I've a horse outside

Giddy up now baby, bless my soul
I rode the fucker round a field back since he was a foal
He runs a bit like Shergar, and he jumps like Tír na nÓg
He looks like Billie Piper after half an ounce of coke
And the boys are lookin' jealous, as I lead yer one away
And just before I close the door I look at her and say
Would you be my girl, and she says I will of course
If ya grab me by the ponytail and ride me like a horse
Ya!

Turn it up, I don't think they hear it enough
Back when Jordans' and a gold chain was livin it up
Up top, I had a hi-top fade wit the high-tops
Watchin my highlight tapes from a skybox

The place on the map where Isaiah beat Magic
Throwin elbows, had them Rick Mahorn habits
With the 8-9 bad boy hammer on my cap
And you know Chuck wit it, now the girls get wit it
Tell 'em, kiss it off the glass or, pass or, kick it
Callin shots from the bench and, finger pointin picks

Awesome and then I hear the Mrs. barkin
Not my Mrs., Mrs. Wilson from the yard across us
And while I'm flossin my teeth
I see her walkin 'cross that street then I waved
Like, what's up Mrs. W? Sorry 'bout the trouble we've been causin
The cops came over but it wasn't true
They said the music which is way too noisy
She said I know how you boys be
But, if you not busy come over for some lemonade later
I'm a Minute Maid man, made minutes into paper
The vapors, now cue the steam, who is it you see?
Sittin down with some twins now I'm wishin it was two of me
Whenever my soles hit the pavement

[Verse 1: Nas]
They never realized how real Nas is, so decisive
It's just the likeness of Israelites mist that made me write this
A slight twist of lime rhyme, be chasing down your primetime
Food for thought or rather mind wine
The Don Juan features the freak shit
My thesis on how we creep quick
Fucking your wife, that ain't no secret
It's mandatory, see, that pussy, they hand it to me
I got no game, it's just some bitches understand my story
There ain't no drama that my niggas never handle for me
My gator brand is Mauri, walking through rough land before me
Where the snakes put a smile on they face
Hoping and praying I'm stuck
Scoping, they lay in the cut, weighing my luck
Player haters play this in cell blocks and rocked stages
Winking at some females cops with cocked gauges
Really, it's papers I'm addicted to
Wasn't for rap, then I'd be sticking you
The MAC inside the Triple Goose
Face down on the floor's the routine
Don't want hear nobody blow steam
Just cream or it's a smoke screen
Imagine that, that's why I hardly kick the bragging raps
I zone, to each his own and this ghetto inhabitant
[Chorus: Nas & Foxy Brown]
Watch dem niggas that be close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
'Cause you know they be thinking 'bout smoking you
Never personal, nowadays it's the ways
Watch dem niggas that be close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
'Cause you know they be thinking 'bout smoking you
Never personal, nowadays it's the ways

[Verse 2: Nas]
Now, how can I perfect this? (Uhh, what?)
Living reckless, die for my necklace
Crime infected, driving a Lexus with a death wish
Jetting, checking my message on the speaker
Bopping to ""Mona Lisa"", brown reefer, ten G's, gun and my Visa
CD cranking, doing 90 on the Franklin D. Roosevelt
No seat belt, drinking and thinking
My man caught a bad one, son, niggas is frightened
Secret indictments, adds on the one seeking enlightenment
My Movado says seven, the God hour, that's if you follow
Traditions started by the school, not far from The Apollo
My 'fuck tomorrow' motto through the eyes of Pablo
Escobar, the desperado, word to Cus D'Amato

[Chorus: Nas & Foxy Brown]
Gotta watch dem niggas that's close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
'Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you
Never personal, nowadays it's the ways
Watch dem niggas that's close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
'Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you
Never personal, nowadays it's the ways
[Verse 3: Nas]
Some niggas watch you (Uhh)
See you when you think you on the low, ain't hard to spot you
You swore to keep it real after you blow
Three keys, new V's, went to Anguilla with your ho
Stayed around the hood, smoothest cat getting the dough
Them old timers advise you to them problems that's ahead
Drama with the Feds, not listening, just bobbing your head
Your Rollie shining, thinking to yourself ""Nobody's taking mine""
At the same time, your ho is getting snatched from behind
Put in a van, ""Where's the hundred grand?"", stripping her hand
From all the ice, wouldn't you know
You knew these niggas all your life
What made them mark you victim?
You fucked up somewhere down the line
Now they had to target your Wisdom
She took 'em to your place, straight to your safe
You doubted it could happen, sick of yapping
Jump in your ride, headed to your side
Puffing ganja, get to your crib, can't find her, just a reminder:
Shouldn't have your stash house where you crash out
Could've passed out, your coke is gone, now you ass out
Dead bitches tell no lies, you should use your eyes

[Chorus: Nas & Foxy Brown]
Gotta watch dem niggas that's close to you (Uhh)
And make sure they do what they supposed to do (What, hah)
'Cause you know they be thinking 'bout smoking you (Uh)
Never personal, nowadays it's the ways
Watch dem niggas that's close to you (Uhh)
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
'Cause you know they be thinking 'bout smoking you (Uh-huh)
Never personal, nowadays it's the ways (Uhh)"
Cable In The Classroom,Charles Hamilton,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]:
By now you should know my name
(Charles Hamilton)
Here we go
Im feelin good
How you feelin'?
How you feelin'?

[Verse 1]:
In a class of a few but I'm gonna excel
I'm gonna prevail till I'm numb and I'm pale
But way too much color to be covered in blankness
So I gotta show enough love to the ancient
What's fucked up is some stuff is pretend
And it gets mixed with the stuff smothered within
Plug it in plug it in get a fresh scent
But when the sin is gone, the innocence gone
Too strong ya nose bleeds to weak isn't a question
The end of a gesture but in every sense a protector
Visit a septic tank to get in the shit that he isn't getting stressed with
But the mere thought is reminiscing to a man who don't possess clear thought
The price of fame all the luggage that fear bought
Where you goin' with them bags and a bottle?
Reply going somewhere by you, andddd
[Hook]
That's just how it goes baby
That's just how it be baby
That's just what it is baby
That's just what it means baby
Take a take a listen to me now baby (x4)

[Verse 2]:
It's like a witches brew to listen to
Except a sip or two isn't as sick as what this shit could do
If you listen to the whistle you would trip into this little pool of living in a teapot
You're in a tee, some jeans, some DC's and you gotta whistle to yourself cause the beat's hot
You say the beat is nuts
I say you've been tee-bagged you finally get it and say please stop
C-ham is ill and if you take a sip of that you will see what I'm on
So nasty that my teeth rot
Are you following me?
Are you following me? ... Not
You got lost
Socks and draws I'm doing laundry
Call me when you want me
Want me when you need me
Want this to be easy? So do I
I want you to believe me
Been frontin' since the BC
[Hook]

[Verse 3]:
Breakin' this track in the places
So what you crack and make ya track skip
Is basically what happens when I break on the track
Paper relax I got my blackberry
Do I type fast? Very
But I write fast that's scary
Besides, the view of my thumbs is the truth
I get flashbacks of how my mind would run in the booth
And y'all niggas just ruin the booth
Super slow running and honey Winnie the Pooh-ing this youth
And who's the loser who can maneuver the coupe?
But only when imagining driving
So this rapping is wildin'
So fuck whoever is rapping behind him
Hamilton, Charles in front the accurate line-up
My fault for packing ya time up
With such spectacular rhyme stuff
I'm up, up and away
Go play, OK?
Just deal with me
I'm a cold day, Hombre

Difficult,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Eminem]
They ask me am I okay, they ask me if I'm happy
Are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me?
Or am I just a little snappy and they genuinely care?
Doody, most of my life, it's just been me and you there
And I continuously stare at pictures of you
I never got to say I love you as much as I wanted to, but I do
Yeah, I say it now when you can't hear me
What the fuck good does that do me now?
But somehow, I know you're near me in presence
Oh, I went and dropped some presents off for Easter
To them two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their
Minds a little, and dog, you'll never believe this
But Sharonda actually talks to me now—Jesus!
And everyone else is just tryin' to pick up the pieces
Man, how could you touch so many fuckin' lives and just leave us?
They say grievance has a way of affectin' everyone different
If it's true, how the fuck I'm s'posed to get over you?
Difficult as it sounds

[Chorus: Obie Trice]
Doody, I drop a tear in a rhyme
The day you find it is the day I stop missin' DeShaun
Holton, it was written, it was woven
For a soldier to leave so suddenly, got me wide open
How could God take a soul so dope and
Turn around, leave us all heartbroken?
Know that you're sayin', ""Keep goin'!
Be a man! No emotion! It's your duty!""
Until we meet again, Doody
[Verse 2: Eminem]
""Doody,"" that's what we'd call each other
I don't know where it came from
But it just stuck with us, we was always brothers
Never thought about each other's skin colors
'Til one day we was walkin' up the block in the summer
It was like ninety degrees, I was catchin' a sunburn
Tryin' to walk under the trees just to give me some comfort
I'm moanin', I just wanna get home and
I look over and your shirt is off
I'm like, ""You're gonna fry,"" you're like, ""No, I won't
I'm black, stupid! And black people they got melatonin
In their skin—we don't burn,"" meanwhile my face is glowin'
And I feel like I'm on fire
And the entire time you're just laughin' at me
And snappin' at me with your shirt, bastard
And I still have to get you back for that shit
And by the way, them Playboy rings my mother stole from you
Well, Nate finally got 'em back, shit
It must've been at least 16 years ago
Well, I put 'em in your cask—oww
Movin' past it, it still ain't registered yet
But you can bet, your legacy they'll never forget
The Motor City, Motown, hip hop vet
Hip Hop Shop, dreads, it don't stop there
Yeah, as difficult as it sounds
[Chorus: Obie Trice]
Doody, I drop a tear in a rhyme
The day you find it is the day I stop missin' DeShaun
Holton, it was written, it was woven
For a soldier to leave so suddenly, got me wide open
How could God take a soul so dope and
Turn around, leave us all heartbroken?
Know that you're sayin', ""Keep goin'!
Be a man! No emotion! It's your duty!""
Until we meet again, Doody

[Verse 3: Eminem]
And this might sound a little strange but I'ma tell it
I found that jacket that you left at my wedding
And I picked it up to smell it
I wrapped it up in plastic until I put it in glass
And hang up in the hallway so I can always look at it
And as for all me and D12 we feel like ""Fuck rap!""
It feels like our general just fuckin' died in our lap
We shut off all our pagers, all our cell numbers is changed
Our two-ways are in the trash
So some cats will have to find a new way
And I know it feels like the dreams will die with you today
But the truth is they're all still here and you ain't
Purple Gang, you gotta keep pressin' on
Don't ever give up the dream, dog, I got love for you all
And Doody, it's true you brought people together
Who never woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
You were the peacemaker, Doody
I know sometimes you were moody
But you hated confrontation and truly hated the feuding
But you was down for yours whenever it came to scrappin'
If it had to happen, it had to happen
Believe me, I know you're the one who taught me to throw them 'bows back on Dresden
From eggin' cars to paintballin', gettin' arrested
To sittin' across from each other in cells, laughin' and jestin'
They tried to hit us for five years for that, no question
I guess them hookers and bums that we shot up didn't show up for court, so we got off on a technicality, left sweatin'
Me, you and… what's his face? I forgot his fuckin' name
Shame he even came to your funeral, he betrayed our team
And if I see him again I'ma punch him in the fuckin' face
And that’s on Hailie Jade, Whitney Laine and Alaina’s name
I let the pistol bang once just to lick a shot
In the air for you and pour some liquor out
With Obie in the parking lot of 54 just before
We were supposed to get in cars to come and see you once more
Difficult as it sounds

Man, I'm so tired of praying for this free shit
Man, being broke is some weak shit
But thank God for that Micky D's, one dollar double cheese
Or some nights, I wouldn't eat shit
When I was supposed to be asleep
I was in the studio like ""Y'all, make some beats""
Man you can ask B Right, you can ask Earl Mac
You can ask Pat Piff
I didn't have to go to school, I was better at this
Wanna do a fight club, nigga call me Brad Pitt

Man, I'm so tired of praying for this free shit
Man, being broke is some weak shit
But thank God for that Micky D's, one dollar double cheese
Or some nights, I wouldn't eat shit
But there always was girls on my penile
And I fell victim to the vaginal
But when it comes to the ass chase
No thank you, rather run in the cash race
'Till the world knows Sean
The only thing getter better in time besides wine
Honestly better than all these asses
With no practice, for real just as is
I didn't have to go to school, I was better at this
Watch a nigga pull more strings than Lenny Kravitz
So I can say I have it, iff not I wish I had it
I do it with a passion

[Verse 2]
And we just started, we ain't nowhere near the outro
I'll tell y'all what I'm about though
High ends, high spendin'
We just tryin' to end life on a high note, Soprano
And I was supposed to be on for a minute
Man I've been writin' songs for a minute
And you can ask Kanye, you can ask G-Ro, you can ask Don C
Hip-hop where the hell you find a nigga like me
Snotty nose lil' nigga, used to tear up ice cream
Now I'm wearin' Ice Cream with a chain on my shirt
Call that bitch an Ice-T

To sittin' in Porsches, take in less fortunate
And turn it into a fortune
And make my mama proud that she didn't get that abortion

Raleigh be the city where we like to do the dance
Flex to the left throw some money out ya hands
We do it for the city, and
We do it for the fans
But to ball like Wall
Boy you gotta do the dance

Everybody do the John Wall, John Wall
John Wall, John Wall, John Wall, John Wall
John Wall, John Wall

[Verse 1: Breeze]
Everybody clear out, hand me the rock
Time winding down 3 seconds on the shot clock
Break the defense homeboy, I can't be stopped
All about my money so you know I'm hitting bank shots
I'm trying to tell them, boy you can't guard this
Beast on the court homeboy I play the hardest
Jump shot stupid; yeah it's retarded
You can't guard me in the paint I'm an artist
See I hustle on the floor call me Rick Ross
See the Troop get it jumping like a tip-off
I play hard until I hear the ref blow the whistle
I'm a player but my game be so official
Never reach got to stay out of foul trouble
But I drive in the lane, get them in foul trouble
They can't solve my game; I'm a hard puzzle
But I keep three dimes - that's a triple double
[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Lil Inferno]
Sick with it
Hustle for the rock I go-go get it
I'm in it to win it, 919 baby we represent it
And I don't ball hog we got our whole team in it
See you just dribble but ain't ever got the heart to finish
Can't put me out the game I'm in that thing from start to finish
And if I can't drive the lane then best believe I'm about to dish it
Sideline drifting now, I'm gliding down the baseline
About to do a big slam catch me on them inches
Coming from the south side
The expectations of us is that we will not rise
And still we prove them wrong, we flexing cause we hot guys
Bring life to the game we will not die
Ha, yeah
Stand tall, yeah you call that the great Wall
All I do is ball I get up I can take a fall
I'm hungry for the top, call it lunchtime
Game winning shot, yeah it's clutch time

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Lil Lee]
(Let's do it)
Oh yeah we balling, balling until we falling
Until the last second I'm guessing we gone be brawling
Cause Kentucky here to win, not to watch you play
Whole world do the dance, say what up UK
Better take him out the game, cause they say that boy insane
When he coming down the lane, trying to catch a bang bang
First we flex, show the muscle then jigg on them
For the small play, let DeMarcus Cousins get big on them
You ain't handling nothing I'm about to catch a steal on them
Pass it to the point, crossover and I'm still on them
Crowd going bananas so you know that's why we peel on them
And we from the ""R"", ain't nothing like being real on them
Jump shot deadly, you know that we kill on them
Time to grab the money ball, about to shoot a bill on them
Yeah, North Cal. we gonna show them how to do it
Do the John Wall it ain't really nothing to it

Everybody's in a rush to try to get the throne

I ain't tryin' to use nobody as a steppin' stone
But don't compare me, I'm better off just left alone
And I ain't even tryin' to go there with record sales
I'm just tryin' to keep it humble and respect myself
Say, ""What up?"", keep steppin', and just rep D12
Keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons, jail
And livin' reckless, but if you go check my belt
You may see something else I use to protect myself
A vest, to stop a Rueger and deflect the shells
And send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to
Got undercover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people cross the line
But this motherfucker Ja must have lost his mind
That X, got him thinkin' he was DMX
Then he switched to Pac, now he's tryna be him next
So which one are you? X, Luther, Pac or Michael?
Just keep singin' the same song, recycled
We'd all much rather get along than fight you
Me and Hailie dance to your songs, we like you
And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth
Come on now, you know the white boy'll bite you
I'll hurt your pride, dawg, and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to, with syllable after
Syllable I just slap you, killin' you faster
Than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs
Of that shit you on, but if you want it, you got it
You'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you on it
But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta (Green Lantern!)
We bump heads with any motherfucker that wants to
So what's the deal, where was all the tough talk?
When I walked up to you like, ""Ja, what up, dawg?""
How come you didn't say you had a problem then?
When you was standin' there with all your men, we coulda solved this then
I'm a grown man, dawg, come holla
All you did was slap hands, smile and swallow
Another one of them little X pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you wanna be
Come on!

Methods of warfare, front to the back

Poisoning the mind with visions of mad killing
Filling me with hate
I can't fight the feeling

It's a chemical attack from all sides
Carefuly devised
Spraying pesticides on rations
We're catching homicide
Agent orange destroy in similar fashion
Less action little attraction
Still death is maxim, they're multi-platinum
Killing milions mostly civilians
Through secret experiements with disregard for your opinion

Against this disorganization of the senses
It's tenseless, past or present, we're invalid

Crazy Rap Colt 45  2 Zig-Zags,Afroman,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Wait a minute, man, hey, check this out, man (Tell it)
It was this blind man, right? (This man) It was this blind man, right?
He was feelin' his way down the street with a stick, right? (Hey)
He walked past this fish market, you know what I'm sayin'?
(Fish market?) He stopped, he took a deep breath, he said
*sniffs* ""Woo good morning ladies"" (Hahahahaha)
You like that shit, man? Hey man, I've got a gang of that shit, man
Hey, I'll tell you what, we'll all have a good time
We'll fool on the drum, and hey
Hey if everybody crowd around the mic'
I'll tell you all these motherfuckin' jokes I got
First I'm gonna start off like that, hey help me sing it, homeboy

[Chorus]
Said Colt 45 and two Zig-Zags, baby, that's all we need
We can go to the park, after dark, smoke that tumbleweed
As the marijuana burn, we can take our turn
Singin' them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech & Chong
And sell tapes from here to Hong Kong
So roll, roll, roll my joint, pick out the seeds and stems
Feelin' high as hell, flyin' through Palmdale, skatin' on Dayton rims
So roll, roll, the '83 Cadillac Coupe DeVille
If my tapes and my CDs just don't sell, I bet my Caddy will
[Verse 1]
Well, it was just sundown in a small white town
They call it East Side Palmdale (Well)
When the Afroman walked through the white land
Houses went up for sale (Sale)
Well, I was standing on the corner sellin' rap CDs
When I met a little girl named Jan (Jan), I let her ride in my Caddy
'Cause I didn't know her daddy was the leader of the Ku Klux Klan
(Haha) We fucked on the bed, fucked on the floor (Woo)
Fucked so long I grew a fuckin' afro
Then I fucked to the left (Left), fucked to the right (Right)
She sucked my dick 'til the shit turned white (Haha)
Thought to myself, ""Sheeba-sheeba"", got my ass lookin' like a zebra
I put on my clothes and I was on my way
Until her daddy pulled up in a Chevrolet (Oh)
So I ran, I jumped out the back window
But her daddy, he was waitin' with a two-by-four
Oh (Haha), he beat me to the left, he beat me to the right
The motherfucker whooped my ass all night
But I ain't mad at her prejudiced dad
That's the best damn pussy I ever had (Haha)
Got a bag of weed and a bottle of wine (Woo)
I'm gonna fuck that bitch just one more time

[Chorus]
Colt 45 and two Zig-Zags, baby, that's all we need (Come on)
We can go to the park, after dark, smoke that tumbleweed
And as the marijuana burn, we can take our turn
Singin' them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech & Chong
And sell tapes from here to Hong Kong
So roll, roll, roll my joint, pick out the seeds and stems
Feelin' high as hell, flyin' through Palmdale, skatin' on Dayton rims
(Come on) So roll, roll, the '83 Cadillac Coupe DeVille
If my tapes and my CDs just don't sell, I bet my Caddy will (Uh)
[Verse 2]
I met this lady in Hollywood
She had green hair, but damn she looked good
I took her to my house because she was fine
But she whooped out a dick that was bigger than mine
I met this lady from Japan, never made love with an African
I fucked her once, I fucked her twice
I ate that pussy like shrimp-fried rice
Don't be amazed at the stories I tell ya (Tell ya)
I met a woman in the heart of Australia
Had a big butt and big titties too
So I hopped in her ass like a Kangaroo
See, I met this woman from Hawaii
Stuck it in her ass and she said ""AIEE!""
Lips was breakfast, pussy was lunch
Then her titties busted open with Hawaiian Punch
I met Colonel Sanders' wife in the state of Kentucky
She said, ""I'd fry some chicken if you'd just fuck me""
I came in her mouth, it was a crisis
I gave her my secret blend of Herbs 'n' Spices

[Chorus]
Colt 45 and two Zig-Zags, baby, that's all we need (Uh)
We can go to the park, after dark, smoke that tumbleweed (Uh)
And as the marijuana burn, we can take our turn
Singin' them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech & Chong
(Ay, wait a minute man, check this out man, ayy ha)
And sell tapes from here to Hong Kong
[Verse 3]
I met Dolly Parton in Tennessee
Her titties were filled with Hennessy
That country music really drove me crazy
But I rode that ass and said, ""Yes, Miss Daisy""
Met this lady in Oklahoma, put that pussy in a coma
Met this lady in Michigan, I can't wait 'til I fuck that bitch again
Met a real black girl down in South Carolina
Fucked her until she turned into a white albino
Fucked this hooker in Iowa, I fucked her on credit, so I owe her
(Haha) Fucked this girl down in Georgia
Came in her mouth, man, I thought I told ya?
Met this beautiful sexy hoe
She just ran across the border of Mexico
Fine young thing said her name's Maria
I wrapped her up just like a hot tortilla
I wanna get married, but I can't afford it
I know I'ma cry when she get deported

[Chorus]
Colt 45 and two Zig-Zags, baby, that's all we need (Come on)
We can go to the park, after dark, smoke that tumbleweed (Uh)
And as the marijuana burn, we can take our turn
Singin' them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech & Chong
And sell tapes from here to Hong Kong
So roll, roll, roll my joint, pick out the seeds and stems
Feelin' high as hell, flyin' through Palmdale, skatin' on Dayton rims
(Come on) So roll, roll, the '83 Cadillac Coupe DeVille
If my tapes and my CDs just don't sell...

Extended version with a fourth and final verse:

[Verse 4]
Have you ever went over a girl's house to fuck
But the pussy just ain't no good? (Say what?)
I mean, you gettin' upset because you can't get her wet
Plus you in the wrong neighborhood
So you try to play it off and eat the pussy
But it take her so long to cum
Then a dude walk in, that's her big boyfriend
And he asks you, ""Where you from?""
So you wipe your mouth and you try to explain
You start talking real fast
But he already mad 'cause you fucking his woman
So he start beating on yo' ass, now your clothes all muddy
Your nose all bloody, your dick was hard but now it's soft
You thought you had a girl to rock your world
Now you still gotta go jack off
Said Colt 45 and two Zig-Zags, baby, that's all we need
We can go to the park, after dark, smoke that tumbleweed"
Rooftop,Das Racist,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Heems]

Das Racist as an end to mindwash religion
Nowhere politics, bogus philosophies
Probably, possibly a mockery of monarchy
I'm complex like Cournot's duopoly quantities
Rooftop, like we bringin' '88 back
White girls, Big Wheels, fortunes, Sajak
Mixtapes, many tapes, Mel Gibson ""Payback""
Laid back, stay crack, eat those, stay fat
Engine, engine number nine
I'm on that New York transit line
I'm ill, everything I touch is a grill
With diamonds that's chill, for real, I'm I'll
I'm wack, like You, Me and Dupree
I'm ill like buy one get one free
I'm wack, like nobody wanna touch me
I'm ill like making jokes and burning Dutchies
I'm cliche, I feel as high as a rooftop
Contradict myself in raps like 2Pac
I ride gnarly till I'm Farley that's dearly departed
And the party don't start till I'm gettin' it started
When the party get started, then I'll get with ya darlin
I give it cause she want it, then I dip from your darlin
Before the next morning, I won't give her no warnin'
I'm listening to Warning, I'm out the door stormin'
Maybe towards like a rooftop or a barbecue or somethin'
[Hook: Sampled]

Rooftop

[Verse 2: Despot]

Meet the man of your dreams about dyin'
Came up in the land of the free if y'all buyin'
When he ain't cheatin' or stealin' it's all lyin'
On the 108th Street in Queens you might find 'em
Wildin', out for the night, dusk and daytime
Where the fuck you find the guff to even say rhymes
Get yourself stuffed by three browns and a beige guy
Hold down the fort and raise the roof at the same time
Das Racist, goodness gracious
Great balls of 8 Balls smooshed in faces
Break falls with cake, ya'll hood rich famous
Lifestyles is type wild, ditch the cages
All the rage, kid, save your dollars
Cop that for moms, dads, nanas, papas
Top hats and big wigs powdered proper
So on the money he's a founding father
Dodger, conniver, preach to choirs
Lied when he said his pants was on fire
Ants in his pants, your uncle's none wiser
Escape with a string and a toothpick, MacGyver
Fuck what them dumb youngster crews pop
Who hot? Who got they shoes stepped on on whose block?
No one ever heard of 'em yet like they some cool cops
When that shit drop it hit like it fell from a
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kool AD]

Heh, third verse, similar to the first two
Beat sounds hard like somebody finna hurt you, right?
Hey kids, you like Don Imus? Das Racist
Under your eyelids, phosphenes
A vase clean bizarro nasty
See me like it's fuckin' up your eyes, blepharoplasty
Wikipedia that, if you didn't know
We aight but media cats think we clever though
Are we? You may never know
Speedy Gonzales couldn't see how quick the cheddar go
Smartest dumb guys in the room
Run guys, it's the mulatto Jeff Koons
They taco the best balloons
That's breasts, you goons
I'mma festoon the room
Like Daniel Day-Lewis
They couldn't even hold a candle if they Buddhist
(get that? hahahahahaha)
Yeah we eating! Aw made you soup
You a slave to a bleep in the beat loop
Play it in your Jeep, coupe, hooptie or beetroot juice-powered hippie van
Never really need to ask ""Can he?""
""Yeah, Vic he can""
He like a Spick He-man
Master of the universe, nobody can doo-doo worse
Than I do-do"

Three passports, three first class tickets to the money
Straight flights

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I live by the code, wardrobe from 'round the globe
All I need is a kilo, an apron, show me the stove
General Electric perfected, cooking them O’s
No more peanut butter sandwiches, now we looking at loaves
Hoes, I need a condom for my toast
Busting in these niggas, standing flat-footed, I’m on my toes
Froze, pandemonium overdose
Paparazzi in the trees, please, curtains closed
Armadillo cigars, killers who like to play golf
Heroin transactions with Russian shots of the Smirnoff
Playing for keeps, I bust in 'em before she get off (Huh)
I run the city, just pull up and drop the kid off
Hah, welcome to organized crime
Money got me excited, I’m cumming four or five times
The .45 for you niggas with nine lives
Penthouse on Collins, money long as Ocean Drive
Black Chevy Tahoes, Haitians up out the potholes
My place spacious, smoking aces in Lagos
Feds get involved, I'm slipping off into Senegal
Issue your warrant, informant and bitch I've been a boss
Counting money stacks, yours is counterfeited
I made my money back when your accountant didn’t
Went against the odds, there's only one Rozay
(M-M-M-Maybach Music) My nigga okay
[Hook: Rick Ross]
I got a penny in my pocket, million in the trunk
Started in the back now we the niggas in the front
Step out on the block, all the bitches, they still in shock
Get a piece of pussy then take my niggas to shop
Pandemonium, causing pandemonium
Half a million for the same car we rolling in
Pandemonium, pandemonium
We the number one niggas your bitch noticing

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Rollin', we rollin', yeah
Million ways to make this money, you gon' get it
On the grind 24/7, I’m with it
YSL swagger, wrist wear frigid
Jumping out the Phantom like a muh'fuckin' midget
Money knocking at the front door, I'm like, ""Who is it?""
""It’s Benji"", tell my little nigga go and get it
Cause I’ve been counting all this dirty paper for a minute
Lamborghini dreaming, thinking how I’m gon' spend it
I’m like one's for the money, two's for the show of it
Three's for the bitches that be fucking for the ho of it
Four for my niggas that be stacking it then blowing it
You would think I had a curfew the way I’m going in
Look at what we rolling in, causing pandemonium
Papi got them keys in, he like my custodian
I was tryna bag a brick, you was Nickelodeon
I was in them trenches getting down and dirty serving it
We is part the reason that them churches got some services
The morgue could afford just cause we was doing the murdering
Nigga called my phone talking reckless, I ain't heard of it
Fuck your girl, give her back, I’m courteous
I can keep a secret with Vicky, have a menage with Nicki
And be out London with Lauren and tellin Meagan ""Good morning""
Catch me rolling with Kelly or at the Hilton with Paris
From Hollywood to the hood, I want a mom and I swear
That I want 'em all, wanna fuck 'em all
Had my niggas down so I’m screaming, ""Fuck the law""
Monday night wrestling, I’m so fucking raw
She gon wipe me down, I’ma brush her off
I’m way harder than the concrete, I say what my mind speak
Word to the homie Ross, I can get that nine piece
For the low, that nine cheap, call me if you want it, haters see me
And I'm stunting, got 'em sick into their stomach, ha

Whole time, see that fly shit I’ve been on
All the girlfriends fall in line from my spinoff
That's game bitch, ain't shit, Nudies and some J6
Where I’m from, it's cold and niggas get at you like handkerchiefs
God bless you unless you was disrespectful
Bitches'll disappoint you but money won’t ever stress you, huh
They say I'm special as Devin Hester on fourth down
So all that shit you niggas kicking, we ain't worried about
Catch me at the carry out, mumbo sauce and half-and-half
Flyest niggas out here, period, no maxi-pad
Bitch I got a right to brag, bitch I got a right to boast
Presidential suite and bitch I never use my right to vote
My vision enormous, my bitches is gorgeous
And I am dead serious, bitch I spit with embalming
Shout out to Lil G, shout out Tre and Mohammad
That BOA shit, we get paid with death over dishonor
I'm known as Obama's though I know no one in Congress
These bitches love me all the way, you got sortas and kindas
Sort of remind you why you don’t court no vagina
Just give 'em awesome intercourse and ignore their inquires
Quietly becoming a top tier
You dreamed of getting cream, best believe I’m John Deere
Sip greenest, Moncler shit, earth tones in the winter
Purp rolled in a 'rillo, I am on my John Lithgow
Out of this 3rd Rock, nigga air it out
I am on my Tom Brady, y’all niggas is Eric Crouch
What the bloodclot? Tommie Frazier, fuck yourself
I can't see your album coming, that shit's like a sucker punch
Head for breakfast, fuck for lunch, dinnertime, she bring a friend
Write my shit so vicious, y'all like snitches, you can't see the pen
Always on some new shit, CNN
Shitting on these niggas like I need Depends

Land of Shadows,DJ Muggs & Sick Jacken,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Sick Jacken]
I always wondered what death would be like
Especially when duke died and came back
And said he didn't see light
Was that a glimpse into eternal sleep? no afterlife?
Or promise of hell? the mystery as dark as the night
All signs told me my days were numbered walking the earth
And I'd go out just as bloody as I did on my birth
My mother in pain she's still alive feeling the hurt
But my agony died with me when the weaponry burst
Was it my destiny to lead a caravan in a hearse?
I always thought I'd lead revolutionary victory first
But my enemy caught me slipping and dealt me the curse
Now all my mind could think about is this verse

[Hook: Sick Jacken]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I can't sleep like I'm battling meth
The reaper creeps while I'm gasping for breath
I ask the lord to forgive me for debt
When death comes and my soul leaves my body to rest
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I can't sleep like I'm battling meth
The reaper creeps while I'm gasping for breath
I ask the lord to forgive me for debt
When death comes and my soul leaves my body to rest

[Verse 2: Sick Jacken]
No angels on my arrival and no light either
This might be the end of the road where life leaves you
Atheist prophecy looking likely firm non-believers
Faith is their robbery loot, religion cashing out on the dreamers
In the corner of this room I'm looking at my body
It's lifeless from a trife death with holes from a shotty
Most of my limbs rotting, cold? Yeah probably
I'm tripping 'cause I'm in the middle of the spiritual and physical parting
I wonder if this Land of Shadows is my purgatory
And wonder why if I was semi-righteous did my end have murder for me
When I was young, man, I heard this story
If you don't reach your mission in life, you get a second chance for glory
Is there revival for a common man?
Is that survival for the godly plan?
The bible blueprints the last stand, god and devil Armageddon - blast gangs
I reincarnate reborn with a gas mask

[Bridge: Muggs]
I don't think I'm alive I know I died
Didn't survive the enemy gun fire
This ain't hell it's far from heaven
All I remember we was fighting
In the war of Armageddon
Now I'm stuck in a spiritual realm I don't think I'm going to
Either heaven or hell I'm being sent back so we
Can help and get it right this last time
We won't fail

Acquainted with some niggas who ain't the average niggas

If not there, I'm somewhere mixin' vodkas
In a far-off land where they shake maracas and shit
Keep it movin' like them keys of coke
You're the hunted motherfucker and I'm Benicio
Not Tommy Lee, see, we never involve the law
If it seems the walls are closing in, it's only 'cause they are
Motherfucker
[Chorus: Pusha T]
Hmm, you tryna get some hood fame, ain't cha?
Hmm, you tryna slang in the rain, ain't cha?
Hmm, you tryna save for the Range, ain't cha?
Hmm, you tryna perfect your aim, ain't cha?
Hmm, you tryna get a big chain, ain't cha?
Hmm, with the medallions and the rings, ain't cha?
Hmm, gon' get your Air Force plane, ain't cha?
Say what? So you can get that hood fame, ain't cha?

[Verse 4: Ab-Liva]
I'm a natural-born hustler, I, the risk taker
I get it 'cross the border, the alpha, the omega
My life, I scripted the papers, posh like the wrist in the cradle
That hug the diamonds that kiss for you haters
Grimaldi, it's so gaudy
But it's just so picture perfect as I lean in that six-forty
Five C.I., I'm on them blades like T.I.
Them niggas hate to measure 'cause they knee-high
Still slingin' that P-I-E what I bring by
Need .50 cal, pretty Desert up my sleeve, I
Still huggin' that corner so tight, it can't breathe, I
Never let it go 'cause a nigga gotta eat, I
Came, conquered the game
The flame and the powder and the pot
Stirred it crazy, hustle, I'm elite, I
Still in the game, tippin' the scale like Libra
You don't really want that halo over your Caesar, no

[Chorus: Pusha T]
Hmm, you tryna get some hood fame, ain't cha?
Hmm, you tryna slang in the rain, ain't cha?
Hmm, you tryna save for the Range, ain't cha?
Hmm, you tryna perfect your aim, ain't cha?
Hmm, you tryna get a big chain, ain't cha?
Hmm, with the medallions and the rings, ain't cha?
Hmm, gon' get your Air Force plane, ain't cha?
Say what? So you can get that hood fame, ain't cha?
Hmm, you tryna get some hood fame, ain't cha?

The Killing Fields,Psycho Realm,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Sick Jacken]
Street theater's a dramatic depiction of non fiction
Showing the co-existence of harmony and friction
We document our position
Pro-abolition of static bringing those on a mission
The rendition of the street is territory counts as power
Defense and attack clash with firearm showers
The irony of casket flowers, that at violent hours
It's self-inflicted, controlled by watchtowers
Meanb streets, pavement, concrete
Triggers force heat thugs aim for defeat
The origin of the war is still unknown beef
Your crew will run deep six feet below streets

[Verse 2: Crow]
Everything appears as crystal clear with no dust
The covers the clutch, look behind it, it's rust
Fear loose screws like us that known too much
Confusion by the news stay glued to the streets
Survival sources emergency forces
Sweep through to treat you from hurting
Heats keep burning, the world never started turning
You're learning through the pain of lyrical
Doses of vain juice that hit the brain and
Make you go against the truce
Through the use of, abusive music
Severing nooses hanigng in to bump the box
Proving that these L.A. blocks won't stop
Harm's ticking like a clock arm on the Glock
Cocked back spit the bullet to split
The walking stick talking shit, end up chalked up stiffs
Keep on killing cause you can't stop it
[Hook: Sick Duke]
In the killing fields I run with my steel
You better recognize the war's here for real
You might murder against your will
And some run around with intent to kill
I swear to uphold my mission
And that's to fight to the bloody finish
Through the whole war I hold the position
Madman troop fold opposition

[Verse 3: Sick Duke]
No scar on your soul
When You fight on like a true psycho
Roam, inside the circle
And go crazy like sicko
Go stand on the front lines
And pick up on the signs of war time
One time makes strange days
Now we run wild in the fields with the blade
Come take a stand, my man
Or end up in aim of steel rain
Shots, puncture wounds, straight pain
Ain't no time to explain
The action that caused the chain reaction
Explode, the whole world red code
Truth gets sparked, you lay cold
And watch this revolution unfold
[Verse 4: Sick Jacken]
Ghetto street pavement shelters static
And harbor the spark of automatic weapons
Setting the tragic funeral traffic
Congested on the highway
Planet caravan for respect before you lay
Why wait continue the killing
On barren fields that yield no real scrill
How silly !
Street clowns frown in bad times
Which probably explains mad dogs and high crime
Influx of murder deluxe to strike us
Bust so repeated at sight of cars my blocks ducks
Dodge bucks cops rush, you're a double-sided target
Scapegoat strategically placed, fate's out to get you

""You better watch yourself
Cause in the killing fields they will get you""

[Verse 5: Cynic]
An awful tragedy can rapidly make your life unhappily
For living so nasty, it seems like everything came crashing
So you're main attraction of all that fuckin' blastin'
No satisfaction for livin' life so drastic
A chain reaction of all the bad that happens
We landed in an area where crime goes on
From dusk 'til dawn
Say a prayer before walking through the killing fields
Where shit is real
Where people die over crooked drug deals
Can you feel living ill depending on your steel
To make that dollar bill, robbing people for cheap thrills
Kill at will is taught in his life of dark, raised like hogs
Danger lies in the streets and ghetto parks
Lives are marked by a deadly art
[Verse 6: Sick Duke]
Soldier, don't ever stop war
'Til the fuckin' battle's over, yeah
Come down with intent to drown
In the madness filled with sadness, frown
I know, as soon as I roam
Paths of destruction through psyclones
Blow telephones and microphones
All form of communication gone
Through they run around murder bound
War time folk are found in downtown

[Hook]
In the killing fields I run with my steel
You better recognize the war's here for real
You might murder against your will
And some run around with intent to kill
I swear to uphold my mission
And that's to fight to the bloody finish
Through the whole war I hold the position

I know you're out there. I can feel you now
I know that you're afraid of us. You're afraid of change
I don't know the future. I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end
I came here, to tell you how it's going to begin
I'm going to hang up this phone, and then I'm going to show these people what you
Don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you. A world without
Rules and controls without borders or boundaries
A world where anything is possible
Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you

Ladies and gentlemen
You are now tuned into the sounds of Jay Electronica, yeah
Please remove all coins, chains, keys, and foreign objects from your pockets
We're gonna have a good time tonight, yeah, yeah, here we go

Everybody told me to be patient
But who was sleepin' from couch to couch
And basement to basement but Jay Man?
Satan trying to block my shine like Ray-Bans
Haters never wanna see you bubble
They'd rather to see you struggle
That's life, my nigga
A lot of fakers in the place
Were invited to taste
And told me right to my face, ""Yeah that's tight my nigga
You reppin' that dirty south dog? Alright, my nigga!""
But they wouldn't lift a finger
To light the incent or let the smoke linger
I ain't a Hot Boy but the flows jalapeno
I'm never yappin' bout how the calico'll end ya
Magnolia crack soldier creepin' on the come up
My grandmother won't leave the fuckin' projects, I gotta raise the slum up
These nerds at record labels played me Dumb and Dumber
So I showed the industry my ass crack like a plumber
Now ASCAP bangin' on my door like a drummer
The Fall's 'bout to put a period on the Summer
But back to the point, They wanna see me fucked up
Kicks scuffed up Laying back with a joint
They said, ""Good things come to those who wait...""
Well I don't know about that
And if you can't feel this rhyme then sorry, Jack
You don't know about rap
And if you don't know struggle you don't know about black
And I don't give a fuck what Bill Cosby said
Cause the problem gon' exist when Bill Cosby's dead
And I don't think the revelation from the supreme beings
Residing or hiding out in Bill Cosby's head
This is the thoughts of a soldier
And if you don't like it play dead and roll over
The game is so over
The reign is so over

I'm finna get on this TV and put shit down
I ain't finna let these light skinned niggas come back in style
I'm finna turn this class clown shit to crazy G's

You gotta wash your hands of 'em, get clean on 'em

They are the rumors, they are the lies
We are the shit, dog, and they the flies
How you gonna tell me how to live my life?
And you can't even get your own shit tight, right?
They are the misery that loves company
'Cause that comfortable corporate job can't comfort me
Told 'em I finished school, then I started my own business
They said, ""Oh you graduated?"" Nah, I decided I was finished
Chasing y'all dreams and what you got planned
Now I spit it so hot, you got tanned
And they hate on your relationship, then break your marriage up
Can't kill your dreams so they assassinate your character

Or put your fist to your spouse, so how you gon' move the crowd?

They bet ten boxes of cigarettes that I'm finna fail
Second you talk about peace, they gon' be like, ""Peace?

Matthew 25,Holy Bible (NIV),[],"1 “At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.

2 Five of them were foolish and five were wise.

3 The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them.

4 The wise ones, however, took oil in jars along with their lamps.

5 The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep.

6 “At midnight the cry rang out: ‘Here’s the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!’

7 “Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps. 8 The foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.’

9 “‘No,’ they replied, ‘there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.’

10 “But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut.

11 “Later the others also came. ‘Lord, Lord,’ they said, ‘open the door for us!’

12 “But he replied, ‘Truly I tell you, I don’t know you.’
13 “Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.

The Parable of the Talents

14 “Again, it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to them.

15 To one he gave five talents, to another two talents, and to another one talent, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey.

16 The man who had received five talents went at once and put his money to work and gained five talents more.

17 So also, the one with two talents gained two more.

18 But the man who had received one talent went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money.

19 “After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.

20 The man who had received five talents brought the other five. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with five talents. See, I have gained five more.’

21 “His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’

22 “The man with two talents also came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with two talents; see, I have gained two more.’

23 “His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’

24 “Then the man who had received one talent came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. 25 So I was afraid and went out and hid your talent in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.’
26 “His master replied, ‘You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? 27 Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest.

28 “‘So take the talent from him and give it to the one who has ten talents. 29 For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. 30 And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’

The Sheep and the Goats

31 “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne.

32 All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.

33 He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.

34 “Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.

35 For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in.

36 I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’

37 “Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?

38 When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you?

39 When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’

40 “The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’
41 “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.

42 For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink.

43 I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.’

44 “They also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?’

45 “He will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’

46 “Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.”"
Time To Move On Just A Dream Remix,BrothaBill,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Intro [Joe Rock]
If you ever had your heart broken
And you just wish you could just say something
Come take my hand
And we'll travel this road together
I got your back!

Hook [Joe Rock and LA Shine]
All I want is her, but she left me
Don't know why, will you tell me
I realize...it's best to just be free!
Can't travel back, just let it be
I was held back, but now I'm free
This is real...now you wish it was just a dream

Verse 1 [Angel A]
Do you think you're in a dream but you wake up not knowing?
Is he here? Is he there? You're killing not knowing
Do you love? Do you hate? You keep on going back
What is love? Is it real? I'm just trying to stay on track
So you try to figure out what you want from life
Is it truth? Is it knowledge? Or someone to hold tight?
Is it you? Is it me? Why can't this be forever?
But I guess your expectations aren't on my level
I wanna be a hero, I wanna save his life
But you realize it's impossible, it can't be right
But if Wonder Woman can, then why can't I?
Let me run. Let me jump. Hell I'll even try to fly
Hook [Joe Rock and LA Shine]
All I want is her, but she left me
Don't know why, will you tell me
I realize...it's best to just be free!
Can't travel back, just let it be
I was held back, but now I'm free
This is real...now you wish it was just a dream

Verse 2 [BrothaBill]
I'm reminiscing, remembering back when I would hold ya
Thinking bout the times that I told ya, I wanna grow old wit ya
Instead of loving me back, all I got back was the cold shoulder
I've been depressed, I've been distraught, just searching for some closure
What the hell happened? I guess I didn't know ya
All this damage that's been done, I wish that I could show ya
But....
What's in the past is in the past, and I realize that we're done
I found my dream girl and now she calls me number one
And you're just alone, thinking where'd I go wrong
You'll search your whole life just to try and find my clone
See for me, things ended up working out for the best
No more stress, I feel blessed, knowing that you're a mess
I profess, that you'll confess, making me an ex was your biggest mistake
Nevertheless, now you wish this was a dream, that you were never awake
You were no give, just take, couldn't forgive, you were just fake
You could have been my wife, but now I'm happy that you're outta my life"

Yeah, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same, come on

They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

[Verse 1]
I'm from the land of the gang bang
Since I was little, ain't a goddamn thang changed
It’s the same old same
Bush run shit like Saddam Hussein
I cock and aim, clinically insane
To deal with this bullshit day-to-day
If I sell some yay or smoke some hay
You bitches wanna throw me up in Pelican's Bay
Call me an animal up in the system
But who's the animal that built this prison?
Who's the animal that invented lower-livin'?
The projects, thank God for Russell Simmons
Thank God for Sugarhill
I'm putting a different kind of steel up to my grill
Y'all know what it is, scared for your own kids
How these ghetto niggas taken over showbiz

They give us guns and drugs

[Verse 2]
It's boys in the hood, it's toys in the hood
Y'all wanna know why there's noise in the hood
‘Cause there's drugs in the hood, thugs in the hood
Nigga killed a Crip and a Blood in the hood
‘Cause when niggas get tribal
It's all about survival, nobody liable
I got caught by Five-O
Grandmama came to court with her Bible
But when the judge hit the gavel
Now I'm too far from my family to travel
I just came unraveled
Socked the D.A. before I got gaffled
Owned by C.A, State Property
Just like the year fifteen fifty three
Looking for me, a one-way ticket out
Don't understand, what's so hard to figure out?
[Hook]
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

[Verse 3]
Damn, I can't take the pressure
Pulled the 4-4 up out the dresser
Grabbed the weight up out the closet
Po-po coming, but I'm scared to toss it
Y'all know what happened last time I lost it
Can't tell you niggas what the fuckin' boss did
D game got a nigga exhausted
Gotta go for the plea bargain they offered
Twenty years for what?
Breaking these laws that's so corrupt
Taking these halls and fillin' them up
Some powder keg shit that's about to erupt
Aye, y'all, I'm about to be stuck
Until the year two thousand, what the fuck?
In the hood, don't press your luck
‘Cause these motherfuckers will set you up, word up

They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

Everybodys Nobody,XV,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: XV]
Day to day I stay awake, writing just to please the crowd
Yelling through a megaphone that doesn't make a sound
The homies say enjoy the ride, take your time, be proud
‘Cause once you make it to the top, the only place to go is down
I see my life in versions from the person in the stands
So when I’m higher than the ceiling, I’m still down wit my fans
Home is where the heart is so I never have to search
But now that everybody’s fly, nobody’s down to earth
And everybody twitters and everybody blogs
But nobody saying shit, they just copy-paste it all
That’s how one person’s opinion becomes everybody’s thoughts
When the blind leads the blind then everyone gets lost
Rappers think they the big cheese, ain’t even made a single
That’s why when I go out, I don’t ever stay to mingle
And that’s just rule of thumb and I got four more fingers
But I just need one to tell these divas what I’m thinking
I tell you what my name is, but that don’t really matter
All that really matters is that I’m one dope ass rapper
And if you enjoy my chatter, then listen to these songs
And I'mma keep it short so ya'll can sing along
[Hook]
Everybody’s nobody, nobody is somebody
Somebody told me that I can be anybody
You can go far away and you can go far away
Everybody’s nobody, nobody is somebody
Somebody told me that I can be anybody
You can go far away and you can go far away

[Verse 2: XV]
It's funny when a girl starts to want me
Simultaneously when I end up in a magazine
She probably tells a friend about how she know me
All the suddenly she on me then I hear the phone ring
Bitches jump on a reality show to be a star
Kissing a dude they wouldn't talk to at a bar
And the public fall victim to the ratings
What am I saying? I got a few of ‘em on DVR
I think the world just got crazy more
I’m trying to figure out what Paris Hilton’s famous for
I know that MTV felt bad for what they did to Britney Spears
So they had the VMA's and gave her every award
DJ Booth nominated that’s a great look
Lost to a song with Lil' Wayne that ain't have a hook
It's all good, it just overthrows my message
We always throwing money and then came a recession
I tell you what my name is but that don’t really matter
All that really matters is that I’m one dope ass rapper
And if you enjoy my chatter, then listen to these songs
And I'mma keep it short so ya'll can sing along

The Rabbit Hole,XV,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Omen]

[Verse 1: XV]
Down the rabbit hole we go
Where niggas will big you up for a feature
When they all know they ain't fuck with you when you was a nobody
Before you blown, the cold shoulders they shown are hugs now that you know
Down the rabbit hole we go
Where hoes you know will call you out the blue
Asking how are you and telling you that you are to come over when you are open
Knowing last time they saw you not a single word was spoken
But down the rabbit hole we go
Where everyone got an opinion and you sit there and listen
They looking in your eyes but do not see your vision
They say they got your interest but who are you fucking kidding?
Down the rabbit hole we go
When they start to know who X is, I get emails from my exes
And my mom is feeling jaded ‘cause I can’t reply to texts
Don't know if I'm home or doing a show in Texas
Down the rabbit hole we go
Where failure is not an option ‘cause everybody is watching
I don't wanna be the topic of barber shop niggas talking
The vultures doing circles ‘cause the square got ‘em hawking now
[Hook]
Down the rabbit hole we go
Yeah, down the rabbit hole we go, uh

[Verse 2: XV]
Down the rabbit hole we go
Hold on to your seat cause it's gon be a bumpy road
Where your girlfriend wanna sleep and you just gotta up and go
The fast life got you addicted to something slow
Down the rabbit hole we go
Where everybody’s plotting and ain't no way to stop 'em
Your homeboys come around and you tell ‘em that you got 'em
Afraid of them thinking you just grew up and just forgot 'em
Down the rabbit hole we go
You like her and she like you but nothing ever grows
Cause she’s afraid of being another name that's in your phone
It’s sad when you're a choice and she would rather choose alone

[Hook]

[Verse 3: XV]
Down the rabbit hole we go
Get used to your pictures, you know they'll always get ya
Especially when they jump off and a club chooses to kiss ya
Then they tag you on the Facebook
Now your girlfriend think you dissed her
Down the rabbit hole we go
You got time to sit and think when you in that window seat
Praying for your downfall soon as you reach your peak
So my eyes wide open, I don't even try to blink
Down the rabbit hole we go
You just hope the end is near soon, your life is like a clear room
Every hand shake and friendship is a career move
You feel yourself getting further from people that's near you
Down the rabbit hole we go
Take a pill to make you sleep, take a pill to make you go
Take a pill to make her freaky, take a pill to make you grow
Here’s a pill to hide the real and here’s a pill to make it known
[Hook 2]
Down the rabbit hole we go
Yeah, down the rabbit hole we go
Uh, down the rabbit hole we go"

Comedy Tragedy History,Akala,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Akala]
Dat boy Akala's a diamond fella
All you little boys are a Comedy of Errors
You bellow but you fellows get played like
The cello, I'm doing my ting
You're jealous like Othello
Who you? what you gonna do?
All you little boys get Tamed like the Shrew
You're mid-summer dreamin'
Your tunes ain't appealing
I'm Capulet, you're Montague, I ain't feeling
I am the Julius Caesar hear me
The Merchant Of Venice couldn't sell your CD
As for me, All's Well That Ends Well
Your boy's like Macbeth, you're going to Hell
Measure for Measure, I am the best here
You're Merry Wives of Windsor not King Lear
I don't know about Timon
I know he was in Athens
When I come back like Hamlet you pay for your action
[Verse 2]
Dat boy Akala, I do it As You Like It
You're Much Ado About Nothing
All you do is bite it
I'm too tight, I don't need 12 Nights
All you little Tempests get murked on the mic
Of course I'm the one with the force
You're history just like Henry IV
I'm fire, things look dire
Better run like Pericles Prince Of Tyre
Off the scale, cold as a Winter's Tale
Titus Andronicus was bound to fail
So will you if Akala get at ya
That's suicide like Anthony & Cleopatra
Cymbeline was a modern day Bridget Jones
Love's Labours Lost, a woman on her own
She needed Two Gentlemen Of Verona
This is illa State and I am the owner

[Verse 3]
Wise is the man that knows he's a fool
Tempt not a desperate man with a jewel
Why take from Peter to go pay Paul?
Some rise by sin and by virtue fall
What have you made if you gain the whole world
But sell your own soul for the price of a pearl?
The world is my oyster and I am starving
I want much more than a penny or a farthing
I told no joke, I hope you're not laughing
Poet or pauper which do you class him?
Speak eloquent, though I am resident to the gritty inner city
That's surely irrelevant
Call it urban, call it street
A rose by any other name, smell just as sweet
Spit so hard, but I'm smart as the Bard
Come through with a Union Jack for the yard
{verse 4]
Akala, Akala, wherefore art thou?
I'm the black Shakespeare and
The secret's out now
Chance never did crown me, this is destiny
You still talk but it still perplexes me
Devour cowards, thousands per hour
Don't you know the king's name is a tower?
You should never speak it
It is not a secret
I teach thesis, like anicent Greece's
Or Egyptology, never no apology
In my mind's eye, I see things properly
Stopping me, nah you could never possibly
I bear a charmed life, most probably
For certain I put daggers in a phrase
I'll put an end to your dancing days
No matter what you say it will never work
Wrens can't make prey
Where eagles don't perch
I'm the worst with the words
Cos I curse all my verbs
I'm the first with a verse to rehearse with a nurse
There's a hearse for the first jerk who turn berserk
Off with his head, cos it must not work
Ramp with Akala, that is true madness
And there's no method in it, just sadness
I speak with the daggers and the hammers
Of a passion when I'm rappin I attack 'em
In a military fashion the pattern of my rappin
Chattin couldn't ever map it
And I run more rings round things than Saturn
Sick, never slackin' like a pig with a baton
Verses split big kids wigs when I'm rappin
That boy Akala, the black Shakespeare
Didn't want to listen, when I said last year
Rich like a gem in a Ethiope's ear
Tell them again
For them who never hear"

Materials of value in those boxes
Don't box me

I rhyme in tsunamis and this is just a drop of it
If you DJ you should get a drop of this
I could be talkative if I like what the topic is
If it's broke I got to fix it
If I'm not a whiz kid at it
Then I guarantee that my partner is
Show me where the socket is
I don't even need a toolbox
Give me a wrench and 15 minutes
And I'll having it kicking like you had six feet in it
I am ten-speed and my gears keep on clicking
My ears hear things that I can't even mention
Oh was that just part of the invention
I go bananas before I let the monkey throw the wrench in

A few tubs, filled with that shit that turn you killer
Adrenaline gland under my tounge, ripped out a gorilla brain
Still insane, but I feel the pain better
Too fucked up off this Jesus piss to get my shit together
In a fog, in Prague, reluctantly I've grown zero
Each one of my nerve endings switching with my bonemarrow
The scenery surrounding me isn't really reality
Atleast that's what I tell myself to get it out of me

With the most toxic narcotics

Leak like security breaches
With reefers you smell from long distance
The wet takes the breath of strong-windeds
I never intended to recommend the sins we doing
But people already assuming I'm high as Witney Houston
Accumulated more dust than maids and a butler
Fuck a broom, you need mops to sop up in my rubber room
Bring in the pain, I sing in the rain like Gene Kelly
In between tellys, puffin Listerine jelly
With smelly drugs, mentally bugged, high as I ever been
Peer pressuring, weird specimens with adrenaline
Hostile for days, needing hospital stays
To dry my skeleton, after what's in my system settles in
I fake my own death to get wet, leaking effect
Because I'm good for putting water on weed like Chia Pets

Headed in the wrong direction up in the Sheraton

Firm Fiasco,The Firm,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro 1: Nas]
As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be in The Firm
I can remember when I first met Sosa, it was a glorious time
There were wise guys everywhere
We were around twenty-one, twenty-two at the time
Yeah, every place we go, every party
People would stop and stare when we walked in
We would give the doorman a hundred dollars
Just for openin' the door
Sosa would give the bartender two hundred dollars
Just for keepin' the ice cold
Yeah, we were legends
Yeah, and we still are legends

[Verse 1: AZ]
Two hundred fallen angels, we ballin' from every angle
Heavy bag gold, Panamanian chains dangle, let’s tangle
Tabernacles, Elohim’s comin' at you
Fuck parables, a billion years B.C., original black Jews
Cashews honey nut roasted, let’s kill the culprit
He owe shit, toe-to-toe or let .44 spit
Fuck the whole shit, mercury back-tax the birth of me
Personally, I existed when Earth was in need, indeed
Human life form transformed from light storms
Protons, electrons, neutrons, I swarm
Nights long, reptilians, I’ll see y'all in the next millennium
What world are we really in?
Amphibians moved to the Caribbeans
Underwater force, placed under the court of law
Usually sport velour, my mind stay core raw
Fill of ambience, love fine fabrics and cars to launch
Nonchalant, usually there are jimmies up in The Bronx
Play low style, through the years, changed my whole profile
Let the doe pile, bet the God be around for a while
Firm Islamic, hit the core of the Earth just like a comet
[Intro 2: AZ]
See, I liked Esco
He knew everybody and everybody knew him
He was the type of guy that rooted for the bad guys in the movies
But, hey

[Verse 2: Nas]
Die for this Firm, live for this Firm, niggas learn
Nothin' should come before your fam, from keys to quarter grams
D’s on corners in the blue van ease upon us
'Cause of warrants, while we smoke hashish enormous
Stack cheese, travel the world like tourists
Went half with Sosa for four bricks
Down in Camden, we handlin’ to D.C
Chicks on flights with China Whites by they tight P.P
Wantin' PC, but all they get is good dick
Or full clips for loose lips by this young ruthless
Suck the pearl tongue juices off your fly missus
Take her out to the Spark’s Steakhouse
Gentleman style, coincidental
Family’s here, meet femme fatale
French connection, Persian wet don, let’s get this ep. on
The Ebony queen, Fox, you grab my left arm
Dre made it QB to Compton, BK and so on
Family strong, consigliere Nature
Makin' sure we all get this millionaire paper
What a sweet sight for sour eyes, may we all rise
Hope from now on, we never cross sides
[Intro 3: Foxy Brown]
You know what?
Most hoes would’ve left these cats a long time ago
I mean, if your man gave you a gun to hide
What would y'all hoes do?
But you know, the shit kinda turned me on

[Verse 3: Foxy Brown]
Black Madonna, hoes kill for they papos
Ever seen a bitch like this? Queen missus
Rocks the VVS's on the left wrist
Trick, check this, respect this
Firm niggas lie knee-deep in this bitch
When you need, bitch’ll have my pussy bleed
Swear for ‘em, fuck and take the chair for ‘em
Whoever dare cross us, distort the thoughts across a bitch mind
Pops the nine, leave 'em restin’ in pieces
All my thorough bitches, peep this: Death before dishonor
School me on the dick game, lace me in Gabbana
Peep dat, think I’m flippin’ on these three cats?
Set yo' clown ass right up with my down ass
Bitch to hold the cash and G’s
Stash the guns for ‘em in the icy E-bikini
Breed a son for ‘em
Long dick style, swallow the enemy’s cum for 'em
Pretty-ass ho, bitch'll fuck 'em and I dumb on 'em
When Nas pops the Crist', Fox cocks the fifth
Make my doe off of Oz’s and hoes that strip, uh"

Leaving the rocks in such blind order

By the time you read this letter
Your head gon' fly off your shoulder for lying
And I'ma be in bed like holders
Blood from a horse on your spread, you tried to play me now
I'm coughing up, dough on your head, you just a baby
See me in the flick in Zurich, I had to maybe with me
All these niggas stay in the 90's, getting rich
Rick Ruler robe on with rings, walking to the throne
Fronting like I know I'm the king, I live alone though
Buying up, China's Beemers, taking it to Simon's in Medina
Only just to blind you and leave ya
These young boys is crafted with aim, I bought 'em all
Fly ranches, 'cause they all stand beside me with flames
Regardless, yo, to making the classic
You gon' witness some of the tactics
Some died, live in the action
A live general when he walk, if he died, then we slide
Ninety thou' in the coffin, and take the child

Black Jesus, check my walk, check my talk
Legend in the flesh and I rep New York
Crowned king, been down to bang, I'm House Gang
Knockout specialist, in and out the ring
Got dinner tables long as boats with old kitchens
And Wu-Tang logos splashed on all the dishes
You know how I speaks the truth, how I teach the youth
I'm an animal, I beast the booth
Been grinding, banging out for food to eat
Your boy still eating good, check my new physique
Since the world is mine, I'ma write my name on the clouds
So that all yee faithful, can praise it and bow

[Verse 3: Masta Killa]
Now he's an old Mafia don, from back when
He managed to survive the game, ducking fame
It's how he maintained, the State of Grace, kept his lab laced
Ladies of a fine taste, kept his place guarded
While the young charted, found acquitted, all charges
And his heart loss and, marksmen take the contract
From the contact, waiting for the right event, it all made sense
He left no prints on the weapon, and he was blasting
Came home from prison stashing, still stacking
His whip still matching his kit, steel flashing
Hands quick, nice with his shit, three holy foods drops jewels
From a street corner level, young brother, I'ma rebel
Here to instruct private soldiers to buck arms
Y'all rap cats had your last win, toast the kings
It's Wu-Tang, it's our thing, kiss the ring

Aw!
It hurts
The D's trying to pin a murder on me
In the precinct they saying I done murdered homie
I told my lawyer I ain't heard of homie
And everybody know my niggas murder for me

[Verse 1]
You see homo on your crib, it ain't a burglary homey
They finna to have me stuck in purgatory
I'm down to do the sticking when it come to the orgy
Conventional methods of sex, totally bore me
Wait, I'm getting sidetracked, back to the story
These cocksucking police got it in for me
They flash their lights, they wanna rough me up
Frisk me, find my burner and cuff me up
But history repeats itself, they never learn
The Unit's the new Bebo's, who gon' be Eddie Byrne?
Huh, we'll find out when niggas let off the rounds
And his partner's screaming officer down
[Chorus]
Police get in the way
I'll murder them, I'll murder them
A nigga already got three strikes
I'll murder them, I said I'll murder them
Any motherfucker touch me
I'll murder them, I'll murder them
You don't believe me, wait and see
I'll murder them, you see I told you I'd murder them

[Verse 2]
They saying I'm an accident waiting to happen
I got one in the head, I'm just waiting to clap it
A pimp told me I was made for this mack shit
So just get you a white girl, don't fuck with no black bitch
I got two felonies from selling that crack shit
And the third one, came from showing niggas my mac spit
See I'm down for that daytime action
Have niggas crawling under cars when I start to cappin'
So they don't know what to say to the captain
But they know if word get back, something gon' happen
I've been shot, I've been stabbed, but I ain't been snitched on
When you snitching where I'm from you gon' get your shit blown
Southside - I make the best of the worst
We gotta share the same bitch, okay, I go first
Cause your baby's momma is my baby's momma
I come through to see my little nigga with the llama

Police get in the way
I'll murder them, I'll murder them
A nigga already got three strikes
I'll murder them, I said I'll murder them
Any motherfucker touch me

I'll murder them, you see I told you I'd murder them"

[Intro]
This is how monsters function
Leave me alone
I ain't fucking with nobody

[Verse 1]
Keep fucking with me you going turn me back to Boo-Boo
Have me casing out your crib, trying to pop your fucking noodles
She was 20, I was 12, man my Nana said she raped me
I just smiled from ear to ear, saying take me, baby, take me
Since high school, nigga, I ain't got no friends
Got two 380s like the Ying Yang Twins (Haaan)
That's spot clicking till the Ds run in
Then it's bail money and lawyer fees, you got to have ends
Freshman year I had that CBR Hurricane
In a ill herringbone, I got them swinging Heroine
I shoot a nigga in a heartbeat I ain't no chump
Then you can run forrest run, retard when I dump
They take kindness for weakness, niggas don't respect that
So me I'm where that Ruger, that Pump and that Tec at
Some look at me I'm on now, I thought we was rich then
Shipment, but you had like twenty bricks in Richmond
We was in Cocaine heaven, I was fishscale dreaming
We just got in the town, we was strapped up scheming
First Country caught a body, then Country caught a body
Then I popped a couple niggas then Country shot everybody
It's cold blooded, it's real shit, you got to love it
Trey-eight Snub it, and don't think nothing of it
It's the way of the wolves, it's how they train us to move
Get it popping when we shopping, niggas hold down the tools
[Hook]
I seen niggas getting rich
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
I was tired of not having shit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
I seen niggas getting hit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
We was slinging that shit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
Here I am

[Verse 2]
Unsure since we was little niggas, son, since we were seven
Armed robbery, first degree, my man did seven
Niggas popped his whip up, hit his Camry with a seven
He a lucky motherfucker, I bet he make it to heaven
My Grandpa drunk, my uncle Rock drunk
My uncle Champ pump crack, smoked my fucking stash up
I had 250 grams stashed on the porch
I mean, how much you going to smoke, man?
How much you going to snort?
First the VCR went, then the TV went
He stole out of mommy purse
She thought it was me, kid
I ain't ask her for no money, son
Cause I was out hustling
She was looking at me sideways like I'm a thief or something
That hurt me, come on son that wouldn't hurt you?
I pistol whip that nigga till his face was purple
I need anger management, see I hold on to a grudge
The same way I hold on to that nickel-plate Snub

The Lord don't have imperfections, baby
So I think I'm perfect the way he made me
Some say I'm cool, some say I'm crazy
Some say I ain't shit, some say I'm amazing

Your daddy fucked your momma then fucked your sister
Then climbed in your bed playing with your shitter
Go 'head, take your belt off and hang yourself
Matter of fact, grab your strap and bang yourself
Jay's a big man, he's too big to respond
I'm a big dick, you know, the one everybody on
You 'gon make me sing ''Murder Was the Case''
Bullets ricochet, *ping ping*, shoot the star off your face
I'm international, I'm never home, mane
I've been gone so long my accent changed
You better watch who you fuck with, mate
Or you gon' make me carve your ass up now straight
Come on, Game, you will never be my equal
Your homies shoot doors, my niggas shoot people
See, me, I'm what you never gon' be
I'm in that tax bracket you never gon' see

See, I get so disrespectful

That nigga Buck like Gator, tell momma he done smoked the TV
I ain't know he fucked with more dope than B.G
Plus a nigga sipped more syrup than Pimp C
Man, keeping these motherfuckers rich ain't easy
Especially when a nigga wanna stunt like Jeezy
And his CDs didn't sell like his CDs
Man, that nigga blew all of his chips on them breezies
Mad 'cause the world won't treat him like Weezy
Look, I don't give a fuck, nigga, please believe me
No nigga in no vocal booth around can see me
It's crazy how I make this shit look oh so easy
They say, ""50, nah, don't fuck with him, he oh so greasy
Yeah, he used to share that paper, now he oh so greedy""
It's funny how they shit on me 'cause them, they need me
See, me, I'm number one, I'm loading up my gun
I catch you and you done, you pussy, nigga, run

See, I get so disrespectful
So, so, so disrespectful
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful

See, I get so disrespectful

They say first comes love, then comes marriage
Instead, I got Shaniqua in a baby carriage
Then came the cash, then the baby mama drama
I gave that bitch a half a mill', she blew it on Prada
I remember when I met the bitch and she ain't have nada
Got my son on some fly shit, now I gotta buy shit
Man, I can't even flaunt shit 'cause everybody want shit
Everybody mad, damn, even my dad
And I don't even know him, now how the fuck I owe him?
I ain't giving nobody shit, I'ma show them
I gave Game hits, he told me to suck dick
Start screaming ""Westside"" and Dre ain't say shit
Now we just eat off him and when I talk to Em
A smile comes on his face, he told me ""Here's the case""
Enemies stay enemies but friends they change
Niggas go crazy over money, my mane

Radio-Inactive,Blueprint,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'alternative']","[Blueprint]

It's my time, I'm 'bout to blow
You slept first, but now you know
The rap game, a thousand clones
All worried about their clothes
I used to chill at my home, now I’m all about the road
Moving, locking down the shows, hit the tele, count the dough
Shake hands, make plans, rent vans, make fans
God damn, this is how a little boy became a man
You want the fame and all the riches, big name model bitches
But you don’t want to hustle twice as hard to try to get it
You got a lot to whine about. While you talking, wilding out, I’m posted outside the club, working passing flyers out
What’s Print's life about? The same thing I rhyme about
Make good music and give my fans something to smile about
You ought to try it out, we like to call it honesty
It's the best policy, the reason why they follow me
My reputation precedes me, the rap game needs me
Cause I do the impossible, but I make it look easy
Now all the underdogs wanna take shots at my figure
Cause I’m eating real big and didn’t invite them to dinner
You wasn’t there when I put it in the oven. So when it's time to break bread, cousin, don’t ask me for nothin'
Everybody got a rhyme, if not a rhyme they got a beat
If not ki's of cocaine, they all packing heat
So what they really telling me when they ain’t outselling me?
And everything they say and do is fueled by their jealousy
I know you're trying to politic, and I'm only involved with it
So you can get in the game, take the ball and then run with it
They tried to hit me with the same thing that you fell for
""Make it more commercial, Print
You probably would sell more""
But I’m eating now, so I’m like, ""What the hell for?""
Telling me to change only makes me rebel more
But radio don’t want that, Print don’t fit the format
Tell dude to change it up, and maybe he can come back
I made this in my basement when you wasn’t even there
To express my feelings, not to be played on the air
So am I wrong or secure if I really don’t care
If this ever turns into something that anybody hears
Man, I’m an artist, these other dudes shook
I write my album on my sidekick – no paper, no notebooks
Then rhyme for five minutes straight
With no breaks and no hooks
No punch-lines, no similes, so I'm easy to overlook
But Grooveshack, Theives World, Expo, Scribble Jam
I’ve been around in every single era and I'm still the man
And while I may not get the same hype as the next man
Everything in my life is going according to His plan
So thank God for every fan, every single listener
Who told me to make the art, you don't gotta switch it up
You put it out, we'll pick it up. Do you, stay strong
You're the main reason we don’t turn our radios on"

They say I’m in a position some'll kill for
But I was once one of the ones who killed for it
So up-and-comers understand that I feel the pain
Since I got some recognition, I don’t feel the same
Normally, I say the industry is still to blame
But I’m a part of it now and I’m still flames
And they still lame, they gotta realize I bubbled
In a distilled vein, using my still brain
I only want one thing and it’s still fame
I wanna picture it and live it in still frame
They got no heart so they don’t feel pain
But I bleed when I make a track
I ride with my mic and my naked back

No hate, just gotta terminate that ass

And I’m here so get used to it"

Corrupt coppa’s, they love to stop us
And plant work on niggas so they can wash us
Knowing niggas on parole and 3-year joint probation
Next violation - 3 years in the Pen is what you’re facing
You motherfuckers kill my nigga Squee-G
And expect for a nigga to take it easy?
Beat ‘em down if no dope is found
But don’t come around when the killings is going down
It makes me wonder if they the enemy
Because it seems like it
If you catch a case, you niggas best to fight it
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Fugitive, on the run, wanted in 5 counties
Bounty hunters on a nigga cuz I done jumped bail, was outie
County time ain't for me, needed the penitentiary
100 in G’s and a half pound of weed
If niggas stuck together, we around all this shit
Niggas running the White House, the first black President
Whites in residence of poverty and projects
I’ll bet you all can’t spend a day in that shit
Have you scared straight calling for your mammy to come get you
Natural disaster, like a earthquake or a twister
Shake up the world, make ‘em wake up the boys and girls
And make it a better place to raise my baby girl
You got it twisted like a curl
Think you know everything
I get my money on, and stack a little change
The game’s change just like a fad, but I ain’t mad
Because everybody, Mom’s and families is still sad

This album is less than nothing
I can't sell this fucking record
Wha-
Do you know what's happening to me out there?
Wh-wha-what's the problem?
Violet Brown told me to go fuck myself!
Who's Violet-
Tower Records told me to shove this record up my ass!
Do you know what it feels like to be told to have a record
Shoved up your ass?
But I-
I'm gonna lose my fucking job over this
Do you know why Dre's record was so successful?
He's rapping about big-screen TV's, blunts, 40's and bitches
You're rapping about homosexuals and Vicodin
I mean...
I can't sell this shit!
What-
Either change the record or it's not coming out!
What? I-

And they're lambs to the slaughter, so I gotta feast upon 'em
But J57 told me not to speak upon 'em
Well, gotta get your, gotta get your, gotta get your bars up
I connect that live electric shit that lit the stars up
Y'all just bosses, I'm walking with a halo
The way they're politicking got my mama sick, it's shameful
This anglo's slick as a raincoat, Get vehicular mangled

This con queso-getter from Grayskull
That delivers the fuego to incinerate them same old cliques
They let the flood gates open, I don't like the result
And I ain't concerned with swagger, homie, I'm an adult

I'm living proof that even if you sacrifice
You only get a lil' dap as your asking price
And seems like the ink dried all too fast
You signed on that line but all you ass
Y'all some borderline barnacles, welcome to the chronicles
So old school that my molecules got monocles
Fine women caught a few, ice dripping? Nada. You
Ain't built nothing but a little lego block or two
Ain't a person I can shoot, that was a child once
Who never got a chance cause he ran with the wild ones
Rather sip a 22 than throw a clip in 22
Cause going to a funeral ain't really nothing fun to do

(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Fuck woulda thought?
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Motherfucker comes out
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Sells a couple of million records
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling
(I never knew I'd)

[Verse 1]
I don't do black music, I don't do white music (No)
I make fight music for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this
I put wives at risk with a knife like this
Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the back seat of your truck with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin' to straight jump out
Put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face — what now?
Oh, you want me to watch my mouth?
How? Take my fuckin' eyeballs out and turn them around?
Look, I'll burn your fuckin' house down, circle around
And hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burnin' furniture out
I'm sorry, there must be a mix-up
You want me to fix up lyrics
While our President gets his dick sucked?
Fuck that! Take drugs, rape sluts
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Quit tryin' to censor music
This is for your kid's amusement (the kids!)
But don't blame me when little Eric jumps off of the terrace
You shoulda been watchin' him, apparently you ain't parents
[Chorus]
‘Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

[Verse 2]
So who's bringin' the guns in this country? (Hm?)
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun
Through customs over in London
And last week I seen this Schwarzenegger movie
Where he's shootin' all sorts of these motherfuckers with an Uzi
I see these three little kids up in the front row
Screaming, ""Go!"" with their seventeen-year-old uncle
I'm like, guidance?!
Ain't they got the same moms and dads
Who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear?
What about the make-up
You allow your twelve-year-old daughter to wear? (Hm?)
So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
When his bus driver's screamin' at him, fuckin' him up worse
(Go sit the fuck down, you little fucking prick!)
And ""fuck"" was the first word I ever learned
Up in the third grade, flippin' the gym teacher the bird (Look!)
So read up 'bout how I used to get beat up
Peed on, be on free lunch
And changed school every three months
My life's like kind of what my wife's like (What?)
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin' ass every night: Ike
So how much easier would life be
If nineteen million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?

‘Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

I never knew I, knew I'd have a new house or a new car
A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
Fuck! Shit! Ass! Bitch! Cunt! Shooby-de-doo-wop! (Oops)
Skibbedy-be-bop, a Christopher Reeves
Sonny Bono, skis, horses and hittin' some trees (Hey)
How many retards'll listen to me
And run up in the school shootin' when they're pissed at a tea-
-cher? Her? Him? Is it you? Is it them?
""Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!""
Damn, how much damage can you do with a pen?
Man, I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
If you woulda been in my shoes, who woulda thought
Slim Shady would be somethin' that you woulda bought?
That woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it, I ain't know if you'd do it or not

‘Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

See, when you say shit like
You killed every rap bitch in the building
A real lyrical bitch get mad and gotta go in on your dumb ass
Like this, Okay

[Verse: Keys]
I was on the motherfucking Youtube
Had my little nephew, try'na find them Blues Clues
Then I see something 'bout a new little rap bitch
Told him ""hold tight,"" I just had to click that shit!
Then I'm like ""what? my shit must got a virus!
This is not a rap bitch, this is Miley Cyrus!
Must be something wrong cause the speakers is playing shit
But she on the second verse and still not saying shit""
Then I'm like ""Oh, my shit acting right!
It's just this bitch simply not rapping right!""
See, I was laying low y'all, I was on my trap shit
Putting it off - I'll get back to the rap shit
I'mma let 'em simmer then hit 'em with the fire
But I ain't know the need was this motherfucking dire!
I ain't know y'all was listening to them trickin' ass birds and shit
I ain't know they was making up words and shit!
Heh, but it's cool, we be loading up the black trucks
We riding out, first stop gon' be that slut
Fuck ""Five Stars"" bitch, Keys is a galaxy!
The rap game hungry, tell 'em I'm the calories!
I'm sneezing at these bitches, fake chickens is an allergy
I don't get gifts, niggas put me on a salary
Now who's gon' pop off? Go hard, not soft!
I used your last mixtape to wipe my niece's snot off!
I am an infection, how you gon' stop it?
All up in your blood stream, no antibiotic
They like ""Keys, drop it!"" I'm like ""no, pop shit!""
Swagger is galactic, I'mma need a rocket
If bitches gon' respond, then I think they shouldn't
Leave their brains more gelatinous than banana pudding
But see, I ain't gonna talk about it, cops gon' draw some chalk around it
These birds ain't 'bout shit, they just gon' squawk about it
If you wanna try me, you know where to find me
I be in my den, eating bitches where the lions be
I saw the Come Up, bitch, I never felt ya!
You the Harajuku Barbie and I'm going to melt ya!
She sound stupid - who the fuck talks like that?
You not hard, you'd get killed 'round these parts like that
Fuck try'na get shine off your name
I'm a motherfucking bully, I ain't worried 'bout the fame
I don't see another rap bitch around to pick on
You say you're plastic - perfect shit to shit on
I'm speaking for the hood, they say you're wack, I'm sorry
I'm a grown-ass woman, what I need with a Barbie!
When I did play with toys, it was nines and Glocks
There was no Polly in my pocket, I was toting them rocks
When the boys tried play, I was like ""no, you dumb""
I was chasing big shit, they Money was too Young
If you thinking 'bout popping, I will smash you, stop
Your bars is inexistent like them gats you got
And this shit sound faker than that ass you got
I'm Keys! What good is that getting latches locked?
When you thought that you killed every bitch in the spot
Keys was in the parking lot, loading the Glock
When you came out the door, finished gluing your weave in
Keys ran up on that ass, bitch, you ain't leaving!

Check (Nottz, Nottz, Nottz)
They ask me about this rapper chick I might know
I say I never hit it but we sure to try it right though
My verses smother beats and they are in need of some lipo
As for rappers, she is not my type, she's like a typo
Flow is universal, take a blood test, I'm type-O
Nottz do me a favor, turn the volume up, it's quite low
Alright so
I might blow, my chain emits a white glow
See life is a scrimmage I am runnin' the ice so
What is about to unfold
No tellin' like a dice throw
Meet a lot of chicks so your girl is someone I might know
It's only if she's nice though
I ain't about the wife though
And let no, Uncle Ben's rice throw
That is just how my life go
And move faster than the leopard sprint
Around the world
Got a lot of spots like leopard print
I used to think you play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby

Look
Been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached

Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)

[Verse Two] [Drake]
Since you came into college, Hill is somethin you still TiVo
Then you switched the vibe and listened to Il Divo
Or maybe D.M.P., A Tribe Called Quest
But when you call too much then I call less
You would always complain about my small texts
But what you call conversation, I call stress
And that put a barrier between both of our carriers
And I would be like �I ain't getting service in your area�
You be like �Nigga get your bars up�
I just string you along like I was tuning guitars up
I know that I was wrong
I think that this is fate
You took out those extensions and lost you a little weight
Your booty lookin bigger and I think that shit is great
A fresh start is in order, let me take you on a date
Take you on a date
I used to think you used to play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby! (look)

Say, me say many, money, say, me say many, many, many
How many mics do we rip on the daily?
Many, money, say, me say many, many, many

[Verse 1: Lauryn Hill]
I get mad frustrated when I rhyme
Thinkin' of all them kids that try to do this for all the wrong reasons
Seasons change, mad things rearrange
But it all stays the same like the love doctor, strange
I'm tame like the rapper, get red like a snapper when they do that
Got your whole block saying ""True dat""
If only they knew that it was you who was irregular
Sold your soul for some secular muzak that's wack
Plus you use that loop over and over
Claiming that you got a new style, your attempts are futile
Ooh, child, you puerile, brain waves are sterile
You can't create, you just wait to take my tapes (Bing)
Laced with malice, hands get calloused
From gripping microphones from here to Dallas
Go ask Alice if you don't believe me, I get in her visions like Stevie
See me ascend from the chalice like the weed be
Indeed we like Khalid Muhammad, MCs make me vomit
I get controversial, freak your style with no rehearsal
Au contraire mon frère, don't you even go there
Me without a mic is like a beat without a snare
I dare to tear into your ego
We go way back like some ganja and pelequo
Or ColecoVision, my rhymes make incisions in your anatomy
And I'll back this with Deuteronomy
Or Leviticus, God made this word, you can't get with this
Sweet like licorice, dangerous like syphilis, yeah

I used to be underrated, now I take iron
Makes my shit constipated, I'm more concentrated
So on my day off, with David Sonenberg I play golf
Run through Crown Heights screaming out, ""Mazel tov!""
Problem with no man, before Black, I'm first human
Appetite to write like Frederick Douglass with a slave hand (Bing)
Street pressure, word to papa, I ain't goin' under
One day I'll have a label and make deals with Tommy Mottola
Mama always told me, ""You're one in a million""
Always watch your back, never tangle with Haitian Sicilians
Now I got a record deal, ""How does it feel?""
I'm never gonna survive unless I get crazy like Seal
'Cause the whole world's out of order
So at night, the fiends dance on grease with John Travolta
One got slaughtered as he coughed blood from his mouth
The other tried to duck and caught a left with my Guinness Stout
Brother, brother, can't you get this through your head?
This is set up by the feds, they're scoping us with their infrareds

How many mics do we rip on the daily?
Many, money, say, me say many, many, many

[Verse 3: Pras]
Too many MCs, not enough mics
Exit your show like I exit the turnpike
Dice and dynamite like Dolemite
Double-deuce delight, I don't Dick Van Dyke
Star light to star bright, the freaks come out at night
Like my man Wyclef (I wear my sunglasses at night)
And my panache will mosh your entourage
Squash the squad and hide their bodies under my garage
And when the cops come lookin, I be bookin' to Brooklyn
Leave the trails broken, flippin' tokens to Hoboken
A clean getaway like Alec Baldwin
Driving in my fast car playing Tracy Chapman

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean & Lauryn Hill]
How many mics do we rip on the daily?
Say, me say many, money, say, me say many, many, many
How many mics do you rip on the daily?
Many, money, say, me say many, many, many
How many mics do we rip on the daily?
Many, money, say, me say many, many, many
How many mics do I rip on the daily?

Yo, as I was sayin', look
Yo, yo, hold up kid, hol' up, hol' up (Yo, man)

Came in the bank with a tank, fired a blank at the clerk
And handcuffed her ankles to the safe and thanked her

I'm a pretty boy, bitch

Hoes out the ass B, you even doing cousins
Young Based God fuck your bitch like it's nothin'
Hoes on my dick cause I look like Jesus
Bitch, I won a million, shouts-out to Regis
Based like a God and I'm high like a martian
UFO bitch suck my dick like a martian
Jack thirty deep and I act like a broad
With a chicken head bitch chirpin' me like a frog
Ask MySpace, man I get it so explicit
Gucci Mane business, make her suck my dizznick
Game like Atari, but I ain't with that old shit
Knock your bitch head on my dick like the ocean
Pretty boy gangster, rich young nigga
Hoes suck my dick cause I'm a pussy killer
I'm Michael Jordan, my bitches so excited
Bitches suck my dick cause my chain look like lightnin'
[Refrain]

Damn Based God had too many threesomes
Powerhouse shorty, knock a ho head in
I'mma fuck her like an alien
I do the Paris Hilton I'mma make a sex tape
Pretty bitch porno, every girl want me
Niggas on my dick cause every bitch on me
Pay thirty thousand your girl suck my dick cuz
XLR I'm from the hood like a Harley
Turn my swag on cause I'm so gnarly
Young Based God and I'm shutting down the party
Bitches suck my nuts cause I look like a prophet
Beggin me to fuck her, I told her bitch stop it
I'm so pretty you can't even touch me
VIP closed off you can’t even hug me
Young Based God, running bitches like Rugby
Young Based God, I fuck her face like her husband

Shakespeare,Akala,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1:]
Nigga listen
When I spit on the riddem, I kill em
Raw like the Ball of Brazilians
You don't want war, cor, the kids brilliant
Blood, I'm the heir to the throne, not William
Akala, smart as King Arthur, darker, harder, faster
Raasclaat, I kick the Illa shit
It's like Shakespeare, with a nigga twist
Lyricist, I'm the best on the road
Nitro flow, oh-so-cold, I'mma blow yo
Keep the hoes, I only want dough homes
Nobody close, I'm alone in my own zone
No no love for the po-po
Loco when I rock mics solo
I hope that you know, where you dun go though?
Want it with Bolo? Must be coco
It's William back from the dead, but I rap bout gats and I'm black instead
It's Shakespeare, reincarnated, except I spit flows and strip hoes naked
No fakin'-test my blood bruv
Its William, back as a thug cuz
So real the shit I kick now
Plus I don't write, I recite my shit now
Straight from the top, expert timin'
On top of that, now the whole things rhymin'
No more tights, now jeans saggin'
If I say so myself, I'm much more handsome
Don't ever compare me to rappers
I'm so quick-witted that I split 'em like fractions
My shit, I tell em like this
It's like Shakespeare with a nigga twist
[Chorus:]
I get you pumped up
Feelin' like you drunk drunk
When my beats bump bump
Lyrics hit like skunk blunts, blood, now
All the shit I kick, so crazy
There ain't no ifs and maybes
Spit poetry so shady, for lords on road and my hood ladies
Pumped up, feelin' like you drunk drunk
When my beats bump bump
Lyrics hit like skunk blunts, blood, now
All the shit I kick, so crazy
There ain't no ifs and maybe's
Spit poetry so shady, for lords on road and my hood ladies

[Verse 2:]
I'm similar to William, but a little different
I do it for kids that's illiterate, not Elizabeth
Stuck on the road, faces screwed up
Feel like the world spat 'em out, and they chewed up
It's a matrix, I try and explain it
On a real though still ready to blaze 'em, no contradiction
Just face it, they so enslaved, they worse than a agent
I grace stages, sharp as razors
Don't get cut cuz, keep ya distance
No artillery, tryna' be militant
Y'all dudes killin' me, think that ya killin' it
It's embarrassing watchin' you babblin'
Keep spittin ya darts, mines is javelins
The hood Tiger Woods too milly
Number 1 for so long, its just getting' silly
Shit kinda like Bruce wit da knuckles
Like the first time ya ever saw Ali shuffle
You don't trouble, left layin in a puddle
Bruv you are havin' a bubble
I'm a whole different kettle of fish
Thou shall not fuck with 'dis
My shit, I tell em like this
It's like Shakespeare with a nigga tiwst

I get you pumped up
Feelin' like you drunk drunk

There ain't no ifs and maybes
Spit poetry so shady, for lords on road and my hood ladies

[Verse 3:]
To be fair, no MC close to the man
Little just come youts jumpin' out of they pram
Everybody badman, behind a mic stand
It's not creative, one bag of hype, and
If you buss your ting, where's the mash?
Move so much food? Where's the cats?
These dudes ain't real, they just rap
I don't spit what I don't know, just the facts
No talks of rocks I ain't sold, shots I ain't blown
My business ridiculous, sick with it, quick witted
Companies head to head and I liquidate it
Welcome to illa state, meet ya fate mate
Talk truth but we don't play games
Move sick, look, sample techno
Never pull a ting, if it ain't gonna let go
That's that, rap track
Clap ya like a black gat
Back chat, crack back, I'm the nigga, that's that
The rest of these kids is irrelevant
Don't compare me to him, that's just beggin' it
I'm on my own shit, dicks ain't spit
Its no democracy, dictatorship
So dicks hate my shit
I'm sick, raise ya spliff
I'm swift, blaze em quick
My hits, major shit
I flip phrases quick
My sick razor shit
Give thick grazes quick
And chicks say he's Chris
It's not a rumour
That kid Akala, it;s not ""Ack-a-la"", beg ya pardon
Don't get it twisted
Your on the sideline like a mistress
I'm the whizzkid, with the sick shit
My shit, I tell em like this
It's like Shakespeare, with a nigga twist

Feelin' like you drunk drunk

[Verse]
They wanna start again, no arguing, guns in the car for them
Hit 'em while they feet on they ottomans
Off-guard, uh-huh, blow 'em out they cardigans
They case hardening, they at the table bargaining
No time for stuck safeties or shaky targeting
Hit the face, hit the safe and the carpet and
Get the weight, get the cake, get the tape that we starred in
Escape, hit the interstate partying
They guardians is soft frames as jellyfish
Give 'em shirts they can strain spaghetti with
Extra button holes for touching those
They rarely kick, my readiness only matched by my pettiness
Get the change, where the couch at
Pick pocket fleas, please get the cheese off they mousetraps
Remember, they holdin' just like us
Burners under the furniture, 4-4's in floorboards
Murderers, burglars, they game just as hood
And they aim just as good, a little better
Little Berettas with suppressors
And all the etceteras for whatever
We can pole climb, cut phone lines, the whole nine
But we gotta stay together, that's the key to this
Even if it's no longer secretive
They gon' start panicking when they see that you backstage without the laminate
Don't ease up, niggas tend to freeze up
Become mannequins, ""What about you?"" Don't worry 'bout me
I'm averaging fifty shots a game when it's crackling
Turn the lights off on they ambulance
Just, give me room to operate
They be in operating rooms with wounds to contemplate
Don't speak, no room to commentate
Make sure ya sneakers tied, no shoes to confiscate
Get aways, take cables out they Sables
Slash the tires on they Chryslers, no survivors
Niggas can't make it with MacGyver
Either you get them or they get you
No amount of karate class can keep you out of body bags
So save ya boxing and Ninjitsu
Don't be cheap, bullets is ten cents apiece
Give 'em each a saw buck the instant they reach
Moving on, make sure you know who's who
Who's you, who's not, and who to shoot upon
Friendly fire and hitting innocent standbyers'll
Get your enemy wired and it's bad enough
So don't go gassing 'em up
Leave that for the shells, the 12's from the pumps
If done correct, the condo's on me
Gotta go, rock-n-roll, lock and load on three"

They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Well, I bet I couldn't look more bolder
Hold her as we dip into my solar
Call me Ford, baby, I explore her
This navigator, you the one like Lincoln
Black Bentley, you look better in a pink one
She smoking and I'm about to steam one
Let's skip and make love on Venus
Baby, the ball's in your court like Sere-nus
Make me jump over that net between us
And let nothing get between us
We too hot, only sweat between us

Girl, you're hot like fire, gimme whatcha got
Coldest thing moving, gimme whatcha got

'Cause you the number one stunner, gimme whatcha got

That's it, baby girl, pulling on my zipper
We ain't in the club but I still wanna tip her
You should be my misses, I could be your mister
Put me on deck, shawty, I could be your skipper

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]

My Fault,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Verse 1]
I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
With first aid tape and raped on the first date (Ooh)
Susan, an ex-heroin addict who just stopped usin'
Who love booze and alternative music (What up?)
Told me she was going back into usin' again (Nah)
I said, ""Wait, first try this hallucinogen
It's better than heroin, Henn, the booze and the gin
C'mere, let's go in here, who's in the den?""
""It's me and Kelly!""
""My bad"" (Sorry)
""Let's try another room""
""I don't trust you""
""Shut up, slut, chew up this mushroom
This'll help you get in touch with your roots
We'll get barefoot, butt-naked, and run in the woods""
""Oh hell, I might as well try 'em, this party is so drab""
""Oh dag"" (Mmm)
""I ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag""
""Huh?""

""Yo, Sue""
""Get away from me, I don't know you""
""Oh shoot, she's trippin'""
""I need to go puke"" (Blehh)
""I wasn't tryna turn this into somethin' major
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature
Susan, stop crying, I don't hate ya
The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped ya
So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth?
That ain't no reason to start wiggin' and spaz out (Nah)""
She said, ""Help me, I think I'm havin' a seizure""
I said, ""I'm high too, bitch, quit grabbin' my T-shirt (Let go)
Would you calm down? You're startin' to scare me""
She said, ""I'm 26 years old and I'm not married
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook""
""(Hello) I'm over here, Sue (Hi)
You're talking to the plant, look
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late

""Leave me alone, dad, I'm sick of gettin' my hair pulled""
""I'm not your dad, quit trying to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? Put down the scissors
'Fore you do something dumb
I'll be right back, just chill, baby, please?
I gotta go find Dave, he's the one who gave me these
(I'ma kill him)
John, where's Dave at? Before I bash you""
""He's in the bathroom, I think he's takin' a crap, dude""
""Dave, pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talking to plants, choppin' her hair off
And there's only two days left of Spring Break
How long do these things take to wear off?""
""Well, it depends on how many you had""
""I took three, she ate the other 22 caps
Now she's upstairs cryin' out her eyeballs, drinking Lysol""
""She's gonna die, dude""
""I know and it's my fault""
""Oh my God""

I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world (I'm sorry)
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (What do I do?)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

My God, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Susan, please wake up, please
Please wake up, what are you doing?!
You're not dead, you're not dead
I know you're not dead
Wake up, Susan, wake up

My Syllables,Dr. Dre,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Eminem]
It is not about lyrics anymore
It's about a hot beat and a catchy hook

[Verse 1: Eminem]
If we gotta dumb down our style and A-B-C it
Then so be it, 'cause nowadays, these kids just
Don't give a shit 'bout lyrics
All they wanna hear is a beat, and that's it
Long as they can go to the club and get blitzed
Pick up some chicks and get some digits
And the DJ's playing them hits
""Oh, this my jam! This my shit!
We don't know a word to a verse, all we know is the chorus
'Cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
And the song's ginormous, the whole formula's switched
'Cause we don't know anymore what are hits""
Is it the beat? Is it the rap?
Is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap?
And how do we adapt and get TRL votes
When thirteen-year-olds control the remotes?
And Ashlee's got a brand new nose
We gotta put some new em-pha-sis on our syl-la-la-bles
[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
If the emphasis on the compact disc
Is in the beat, then I'm gon' feature Em and get rich
And let Dre mix the shit and drive off in the Range Ro'
'Cause everywhere I go they love the ""bling-bling"" flow
Bang-bang, look at the way my chain glow
The ring on my fing' cost your man a lot of dough (Oh)
The fuck am I bustin' my brain fo'?
It's just the way the game go and, oh, it takes two to tango
You call this a lame flow? You bought the shit
I guess you to blame, too, I just found an angle (Hahaha)
No more reality flow
I'm tryna time my album dropping with a reality show
Cock the MAC-11 in front of Hot 97
And call my publicist, tell her we impressed heaven (Haha)
No one gives a shit except
Some kids that just got into sex on the Internet
So you want the chatroom or the house in Malibu?
Em, your emphasis is on the wrong syl-la-la-ble

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
They said thirty's the new twenty, funny
Must mean forty's the new thirty, interesting
'Cause ever since then, it's been, in a sense, an extension
For veteran rappers that are better than half of
The shit coming out right now, it's all trash
The torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
JAY said it's his last, then 50 and Em
Then what? Detox drops, what do we got then?
So now our whole camps is running around
Scrambling over what to do
Gambling every time we put a record out
Just lookin' for that hook (Wait, Dre, look!)
[Hook: Eminem]
Shorty, I love you
And you love me too
We were meant to be
'Cause, shorty, you love me
And I love you too
And I promise I'll be true to you

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
Go shawty, it's your birthday (Woo)
You made it just in time to hear my wordplay
It's the kid that flip flows who used to flip O's
And run G for days, you should see how I get hoes
I'm international, I get my dick licked 'round the globe
I'm sick right into shows, ridin' on lolos (Yeah)
Puffin' on coco, my bitch in Manolos
Don't fuck with the dodos, that's slang for dumb hoes (Oh)
I'm playin', I ain't got time to joke, joke
You fuck around, you could get your ass smoked, loc
It's not a game, me, B, I ain't playin', beat behind me playin'
So you don't hear anyway, you don't hear what I'm sayin'
Me fin-nini-na, fee-fi-fididee-yay
Just give me my check and I'll be on my way
Sunny, bunny, money and funny
You ain't even listening, and I just took your money (Ha)
[Verse 5: Stat Quo]
There once was a time everywhere you turned ('Where you turned)
Shady-Aftermath was all you heard
But they say 50 sang too much, and Em got soft (Got soft)
And they say Dre just fell the fuck off (Woo!)
Well, fuck the fuck-offs! All y'all eat salt
Be mad, we back, fresh up outta the vault
Oh! New syl-la-la-bles, eat ball, you fuck-offs
Your house, your bitch, I'm getting sucked off
East, South, Midwest, even up North
Falling victim to wax, spitting, bring out the white chalk
All for the gingerbread, we get it and get lost
Catch me if you can, I'm runnin' past while y'all walk

[Verse 6: Ca$his]
Shady made me for bringin' it back
'Fore the history of rap is gone with a snap
A snare and a clap, what happened to just spittin'
'Bout livin' in the motherfuckin' city you at?
In the grimiest condition, I breathe in drama
King Mathers and Cash—me—that's free karma
I'm everything, anything you can never be
It's a hidden rhyme of the month deep in the beef
I speak with a piece, no peace on my mind
I repeat every evil deed done of mine (Yeah)
No rest contest, contract to sign
By blood, I'm in this squad for life
Hear about out my windpipes, and I just chime
I'm the reason you guys won't say that line
I'm crazy, renegade like Em and Jay-Z
I'm Rosemary's baby, I want you to hate me

[Hook: Eminem]
Shorty, I love you
And you love me too
We were meant to be
'Cause, shorty, you love me
And I love you too
And I promise I'll be true to you

[Outro: Eminem]
It is not about lyrics anymore
It is not about lyrics anymore
It's about a hot beat, a hot beat
It's about a hot beat, a hot beat
A hot-hot-hot beat and a catchy hook
A hot-hot-hot beat and a catchy hook
Nobody gives a damn about them syllables
Syl-la-la-bles, whatever they are
I don't care if you gotta rhyme ""schmoe,"" ""mo,"" ""Joe,"" ""toe,"" and ""glow""

Actin' like life is a big commercial

Screamin you the most foul bitch I know!
Forever mine wherever I go
Sex pistols out (bang) die slow
Nah die slower than that
Just co-llapse all over my matt-ressss
Who shot cha that nigga ain't finished
So once again I find myself in it (click-clack)
Just let me take a minute
Round 2 is in the chamber
All you gotta do is spin it
Aim for the heart
Battle of the sexes
All's fair love and war casualties expected"
Eye Know,De La Soul,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Pos]
Greetings girl and welcome to my world of phrase
I'm right up to bat
It's a Daisy Age and you're about to walk top-stage
So wipe your Lottos on the mat
Hip-hop love this is and don't mind when I quiz your
Involvements before the sun
But clear your court cause this is a one-man sport
And who's better for this than Plug One? (Plug One)
Now you don't have to worry about me squashin' other deals
'Cause they've already been squooshed
Freeze a frame about moods the same which we can continue
Right behind the bush
You'll stay with me, I know this
But not because of all my Earthly treasures
Or regardless to the fact that I'm Posdnuos
But because

[Chorus: Steely Dan]
I know I'll love you better
[Verse 2: Dove]
May I cut this dance to introduce myself as
The chosen one to speak?
Let me lay my hand across yours
And aim a kiss upon your cheek
The name's Plug Two (Is Plug Two)
And from the soul I bring you
The Daisy of your choice
May it be filled with the pleasure principle
In circumference to my voice
About those other Jennys I reckoned with
Lost them all like a homework excuse
This time the Magic Number is two
'Cause it takes two, not three, to seduce
My destiny of love is brought to an apex
Sex is a mere molecule
In this world of love that I have for you
It's true (True)

[Chorus: Steely Dan]
I know I'll love you better

[Verse 3: Pos]
Now it's time to let this rhyme style
Get somewhat poured in the mold
Hold my hand and we'll pick my plantation
Of Daisies for a bouquet of Soul (Soul)
Life will begin at the cut of a rim
Take it as filled to the rim as in brim
Squeeze your stoop like Betty Boop
We'll make Campbell's Alphabet Soup
And spell Plug One's within
Forward march is the say
When transistors will play
Come into bed is the mood
Dolby sound will be then top crowned
When I put the needle into your groove
I got a good thing
And in full swing (In full swing)
I show this in gifts, words or letters
But even without those three
Eye know you'll be close to me 'cause
[Chorus: Steely Dan]
I know I'll love you better

[Verse 4: Dove]
It's I again, and the soul that I send
Is taking steps to reach your heart
Any moment you feel alone
I can fill up your empty part
We can ascend 'til we reach De La Heaven
And in a spin we'll hit the Top Ten
Then we can meet Mr Stuckie
And Pos' brother Lucky will preach
""Let the wedding begin"" (The wedding begin)
Shot by an arrow of cupid
Through the string of a G-clef
My dear, I claim you're deaf
And if you can hear me, by golly gee
Trugoy is ready for what you possess
We could live in my Plug Two home
And on Mars where we could be all alone
And we make a song for two
Picture perfect things and I sing of how

[Chorus: Steely Dan]
I know I'll love you better"

Exhibit C,Stick Up Kids,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Other Wise]
My existence is the only needed proof that I'm great spitter
My structure's always tend to alter like a shapeshifter
They call me in for extra points like a place kicker
Plus I'm going in on these bars... A-Lister
My pace differs, I can stop and even start again
Fashion's on point from the pea coat to the cardigan
I've hardly spent, while I know you tried just bargainin'
But girls still decline, no need to swipe your card again
Your limit's maxed, so quit the act
You can hit me when I'm relaxin, but it's guaranteed I'm kicking back
I'll strictly spit with an accent, so listen Jack
Photography you getting your ass kicked, picture that
I've developed from exposure, picture class
You're just pumped from being gassed up, Fix a Flat
I'm the one who they ask for to give em raps
So they hire me to kill shit, Mr. Black

[Verse 2: J Rob]
They bars is paltry; J R's ribaldry
Is part Harvey, part Pryor, part Chris Farley
Part Weird Al, part Vivaldi
Yall may stay the same, but I bring change
Shopping cart at Aldi
And ever since I was a sophomore
I've started every song off with a hard four
Yall soft; yall don't want war
This is more than syllables, silly boy
This an art form
I'm Jean Michelle Baschiat
Rob won't sell? Poppycock!
I'm hot as hell, Obvious
And time will tell if Robby flops
But its a safe bet that since I rhyme this well, probably not
They see my lyrics, they begin to fear it
What they read scared 'em, call that my Commi plot
And no matter what you say
I'm like a a painting by Claude Monet
In an exhibit behind glass
Cause ain't no body touching jay
You can pick yourself up, knock the dust away
Then come back and try your luck another day

Mr. Ironic Name Rocking came knockin'
Get that picture and hold on to that chain locket
I ain't stoppin, got it? The rotors and the brakes rotten
Guaranteed to get that thing connected to your face noddin'
Gah, it's so much more than some rhyme schemes
Define me's like summer time heat with a fine breeze
Cool, calm, collected, evidence from the crime scene
The underdog squad just slapped the fuck out your top teams
God dammit! The god damage ya God's planet
God famished 'til god handed what god's plannin
Whole new testament, rhetoric they can model
Benefit off the beverage, every sip in the bottle
The lesson is get ahead of it, never been in the follow
It's effortless to connect with it when it get up inside you
So either breathe this, or figure your retreat
Believe it or not, some of us are better off speechless
While they worry about the class of the sneakers
I'm worried about the path that they have underneath em
A voice like mine can attract all the people
Without a record making contact to the needles
So when you see him on stage smashing the speakers
I'm just pissing off the cats that actually need em
Arrogant prick, hysteric with hits
Nefarious type, pyramids, break barriers shit
So serious? Get the Joker blade in the mouth
I'm jamming up the trimmers; there's no fading him out
[Outro: godAWFUL]
I have a gigantic dick tip
UNGH
The best way to retire the booth, for real
I shouldn't say retire... shutting it down for a year

Yesterday,Atmosphere,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'jazz']","[Verse 1]
I thought I saw you yesterday
But I didn't stop, ‘cause you was walking the opposite way
I guess I could have shouted out your name
But even if it was you, I don't know what I would say
We can sit and reminisce about the old school
Maybe share a cigarette because we both fools
Chop it up and compare perspectives
Life, love, stress, and setbacks
Yes, you could tell me how hard you had it
And you could show me all the scars to back it
And we can analyze each complaint
Break it down and explain these mistakes I make
I like to tangle up the strings of the puppetry
But you knew me back when I was a younger me
You've seen Sean in all types of light
And I've been meaning to ask you if I'm doing alright

[Chorus]
Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy ‘cause I miss you?
Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy ‘cause I miss you?
[Verse 2]
I'm shook, I know I pushed when I should have pulled
Took it all back if I could, I put that on my soul
And I would make a top notch good listener
If you could block off a little time out to give it here
Since we went our separate paths
I've hit a couple of snags that remind me of the past
I can't front, I'm having a blast
But damned if I ain't afraid of how long it's gonna last
Sitting here wishing we could kick it
Give me your opinions, I do miss the criticisms
I didn't mean to be distant, make a visit
I'll wait up and keep the coffee brewing in the kitchen
But who am I jokin' with?
There's no way that you and I will ever get to re-open it
It doesn't matter, this is more than love
And maybe if I'm lucky, get to see you out the corner of…

[Chorus]
Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy ‘cause I miss you?
Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy ‘cause I miss you?
[Verse 3]
And when you left, I didn't see it coming
I guess I slept, it ain't like you was running
You crept out the front door slow
And I was so self-absorbed I didn't even know
And by the the time I looked up, it was booked up
Put it all behind you, the bad and the good stuff
A whole house full of dreams and steps
I think you'd be impressed with the pieces I kept
You disappeared, but the history is still here
That's why I try not to cry over spilt beer
I can't even get mad that you're gone
Leaving me was probably the best thing you ever taught me
I'm sorry, it's official
I was a fistful, I didn't keep it simple
Chip on the shoulder, anger in my veins
Had so much hatred now it brings me shame
Never thought about the world without you
And I promise that I'll never say another bad word about you
I thought I saw you yesterday
But I know it wasn't you, ‘cause you passed away, Dad

[Chorus]
Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy ‘cause I miss you?"
Lets Ride,Wale,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Wale]
You know guys, it’s really Nick’s decision, dude, what happens with this mixtape. This is totally “100 Miles and Running,” dude. I couldn’t get any drops from any famous people so I’m just gonna say it myself, dude. I appreciate you downloading the mixtape, however. You got it, whatever, you know, Catchdubs/Wale thing. So, what I need you to do right now is roll your windows up keep blowin’ on something – the AC blowin’ on you. Tell your girl don’t talk to you for about 2 minutes and 30 seconds, 3 minutes, or however long we about to do it. Yeah, you, don’t say nothing, okay? Just bob your head like you get it

[Verse 1: Wale]
Peace to Maryland, but still an uptown roamer
Aroma, strong enough to bring ‘em outta coma
The wake up, dawg get ya face off the pillow
Necessarily rough ‘em, I’m a fightin’ armadillo
No fumbalaya, no fumblerooski
One choke of this you a note from Mariah high
Wale they call me Tiger Stripes
I’ll forever move any cat they admire mine
With that MJ flow they Harold Miner mine
So the mind they mine don't coincide with mine
Go inside the mind, you will find the mine
You see my mind’s a bomb sittin’ behind my eyes
Detonating when I rhyme a rhyme
So in layman’s terms my words burn
There you lyin’ a rhyme
Also, this mothafucka got a nine to five
Hardest spittin’ mothafucka this side of the line
Harder niggas try to hate me, they be lovin’ this side
They were niggas quite similar to pitching the lines
But the same deposition take an L every time
And I’m no ‘Los Rogers, no Mike Williams
Holla at ya boy young Roy’s in the kill shit
Home of the terrapins, beware of the Gilchrist
Weed’s played out, they on that pill shit
A bad mothafucka, where that MILFs at?
I work overtime, Millsap
Y’all Millhouse, blew y’all head
Pause, you not near Wa-le
Who not fear? Dawg, yeah, dawg, you, them E-T-C
I.E. I get sick, white tee, I be kicks
Ya’ll be highly obliged when I drop my shit

Don't worry just done get inside
Come on come on come on come on

[Verse 2: Wale]
I can’t promise this verse will be better than the first
But still how you niggas I get jacks on the first
In search of my perfection, no gotta love it further
In search of my direction, my genre is certain
It’s hip-hop, not pop
Been waiting for the real, real long like skirts at a sock-hop
I like bitches in Air Maxes without socks
And when they wear makeup I’m like “No sir”
I can’t fuck with the alter, sorta like a dyke that I altar
I gotta bounce, I don’t call her, I just bounce like there’s no hole
Barry Sanders on turf, that means I have no block
True, indeed, I don’t rep no block
I rep for the people that rep hip-hop
And it don’t stop, I went to school with the white boys
So I can understand the plight for ‘em
But I don’t mean to finna fight for ‘em
I ran the street with the street niggas
So I can understand police victims
But I don’t mean to finna speak for ‘em
I mean to speak for ‘em
With the s’more from the narrative
Check it, and you can tell everyone
I ain’t finna lie and I ain’t finna fake
It’s Wale Folarin, I tell you how it is, state your fuckin’ biz
If ya’ll about to hate then alleviate the diss
And talk some more shit, ready? Huh

Me and you I think we should ride
Come on come on come on come on
Don't worry just done get inside
Come on come on come on come on"
Too Heavy for Cherubs,Cage,"['hip hop', 'alternative', 'r&b']","* send corrections to the typist

[Verse One]
A cold day in hell I feel good
At least I feel as good as real feels if real even feels good
I think back to being a kid and getting my ass kicked
And when I sold my soul to the devil to make me rap sick
Page from cage's brain, angels dust off the un-godly
Riding through my child-hood to hear my six-year old body
Black-out for second, pick my head up off the street
Little kid handle my face-its not me in the driver seat
Father comes out screaming drops the cigarettes and lighter
Scoops me up with his left arm his right fist snuffed the driver
Takes me in the house stops the blood from wandering out
Is this a dream or time travel?
I ponder on the couch
Walks in with a black bag
Wrap my rubber snake around his arm and made me pull it tight
Hit himself with a spike
Drew blood and pulled his mask down
My hands blue until he let my arm go and he passed out
[Verse Two]
Erratic then gone, I go from manic to calm
Watching the yellow liquid dripping back out of his arm
No automatic alarm sounded
Trying to wrap my six year old brain around it
Went in his pockets took his money and couldn't count it
Went to the front door buts it locked observe it
Pulled up a chair to reach the dead bolt
But I'm too weak to turn it
Give it another try my little eye still scoping him
Now I pan the room and see my escape in the open window
Scurry the floor
Climb out hang then drop into the snow and
My captor snatches me back up
Pulls me back into hell
Starts shaking me to weaken me
To teachin me to be a man by repeatedly beatin me
I hope I grow up before I'm finished being strangled
I black out then wake up tied to the coffee table
With a jump rope cable to my ankle so I can't run
He walks back in the room"

To spread a little love, and spread a couple cheeks (Cheeks)
Pull up to the spot 26's like BAM!
Eyes on me like, ""Bitch, do you see him?""
Strolled through the front door, headed to the VIP (VIP)
Bought a couple bottles and I took a couple sips (Sips)

—I'ma get ya home, then I'll split ya
Grab the cameraphone and take a bunch of drunk pictures
'Cause Hennessy mixed with a whole bunch of buddah (Yup!)
Equals you mixed with a whole bunch of Luda (Haha!)
And you know how far one drink could go
Start slurring my speech, slowing up the flow
Hiking up your skirts, climbing up your shirts
It's Mr. Late Night Luda, and I like to flirt
So guess what, baby girl!

[Hook: T-Pain & Ludacris]
Yeah, yeah
If I take one more drink (Drink)
I'm gon' end up fucking you (Just one more!)
Is that what you wanna do, shawty?
That's all it's gon' take!
If I take one more drink (Hey!)
I'm gon' end up fucking you
Haha! Who else, T-Pain?
You too, ooh, ooh, ooooh
[Outro: Ludacris]
Hahaha!
You hear what I'm saying?
People too picky these days, dammit!
""Too tall, too short, too fat, too skinny""
Have a couple of drinks and quit discriminating
This has been a Luda Service Announcement
Deuces!

Payback,Wale,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1 - Wale]
Mama always told me I’d be famous
Fame is a drug I knew that before Jay said that
Hate’s in their blood, I see it in their eyes
They leave me with no choice, I leave them with no life
They ain’t got no life ‘cause they always on mine
I’m on these niggas mind like lice
Insightfully write that right so keep your parasites paralyzed
Anti-bacterial, the stereo is sterilized
Word to lethargy hardly will I ever lie
Don’t got the head for it, don’t got the bed for it
And therefore if I wrote it they already know it
It set in stone in these poems there ain’t nothing bogus
If money talks then I’m Vic Damone (Woo!)
I’m Chris Tucker, fly like Snuka
A badass slam with a can like Smucker
Add me, take me, pay me it’s nothing
I said pay me it’s nothing
I said pay me it’s nothing
Add me, take you baby (yeah)
(pay me it’s nothing)
(it’s nothing)
(pay me it’s nothing)
[Verse 2 - Wale]
Simply give me a beat, I guarantee I’ll make a hater move over
Listen, hold up,the young dude focused
I’m so potent, fly, fuck if you ain’t know it
Show me to the scoreboard, a million to the doughnut
Beat is my whore get get up on it like a boner
And I could see hits every time a nigga go in
Serve like the Open, word I am Federer
Discombobulate all my edible competitors
Stop meddling in grown folk BI
Y'all all gay at the very least b-i
A poor man’s Pac or a very cheap BI
A welfare version of Wale, I see y’all
‘Cause I insightfully rhyme, I give the sight to the blind
Put my plight in the verse, I bring ‘em closer to mine
The flow no one can challenge, lyrical acrobatics
My entendres be tumblin’ while you niggas lack balance
I am so much a pilot and my power unfathomable
To you broncos my bitches is stallions
Oh you mad ‘cause I’m stylin’ from the city of power
Where the weak are devoured every week, every hour
And it’s over for powder ‘cause they movin’ them pills
On that water like islands they ain’t swimmin’ you dig
I’m just playin’ the field, Ken Griffey you feel me
Meanin’ I don’t play ‘cause Wale is ill
Wale got skills, man my nigga I’m Will Smith
I give em a script, you bitch nigga's my children
Pursuin' my happiness, suitable rapper here
If you ain’t supporting it then I do it without you then
It’s me and my nigga there until I’m a millionaire
The heart of a lion but I’m a Tiger Wood look in there
See what I’m coming with, 100 and running it
If you ain’t subordinate then I order your punishment
The audience lovin’ him cuz most of them can relate
I lyrically elevate, they be callin’ me heavensake
Don’t stutter or hesitate, I plenish you featherweight
I’m stuntin’ the Ferragamo, I’m running that medal pace
Straighter than metal face; some niggas embrace me
My flow is Invisalign, they can’t retain me
Nigga I tranquilize a bucketful of crabs damn right
I made it out, this is for Kevin Liles, this is for L.A. Reid
I'm on my own now learned a little from Kenny B
I’m coming for everything, I’m blowin’ my celery
Them niggas lack bars like underground when their celly ring
Didn’t sign up for anything, I’m talking that Nelly G’s
Need another look Catchdubs propellin’ me
I fly em, I’m outta reachcause denim is everything
Indeed, the flow raw just the same as my Levi jeans
Fuck it, they shrink to fit
Beastin' up in my Tiffs
Yeah they hyped out but the bitches be lovin’ it
Fuck this shit
And I bit Jay-Z
What more can I say?! (hahaha)"

Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, b-boom—Shady!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
There's never been this, much of a menace in this game as this
And it's the, most sinister duo in the business
Once again it's the... illest and realest killers
The most villainous, Dre protege, Shady apprentice
Drop them zeros and get with these heroes
Do you want losers or winners? This music is in us, and it's
Not over till we say it's finished
And G-Unit spinners will keep spinning
This is hip-hop when it's in it's
Truest form, the greatest, hate us or love us
Make voodoo dolls of us and keep sticking them pins in us
Thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is
The trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is
And as sick as his music is, or was, still is
Whatever, forever, he will be the illest
To ever sh-shock the world, what to do next?
He's already reconciled with his {ex}
A chainsaw and an axe
Choke a bitch to death, strangle her neck
While we have sex, while Bill Clinton plays the sax
I sprays the facts, yeah, bring Shady on back
The maniac of rap, devil baby on crack
Resurrect? I never left, baby, I'm bad
I've gone mad, my comrade Dre-zie automatically
Says I'm too broke to fix, way beyond that
I may be off drugs, but it's made me off-track (*Bl-la-la*)
In fact, this right here very well could be the last rap
I ever do spit, I'll never do shit, that's that
Fuck it, I quit, suck on a dick, jackass
I'm done with this wack-ass rap, kiss my black ass!
[Break: Eminem]
(Fuck this!)
50 Cent

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Nah, Em, tell them to kiss my Black ass, the clean parts, the shitty parts
My bullet wounds, my beauty marks, the fif'll tear your ass apart
I came in this game crushing motherfuckers from the start
Shady paid me, Shady crazy, Fifty crazy rich, bitch
Different day, nothing change, it's the same shit, trick (Uh-huh)
Teflon wrapped on, 'case I get clapped on (Oh!)
D's searching the whip, glad I left the MAC home
Still grinding, still shining, nigga, Lord knows
You rocking with the kid to spit sicker sick flows (Woo!)
I carried Game's style for nine months and gave birth to it (Haha)
Now I'm feeling like a proud father watching him do it
Every day Dre day, front and cause a melee
Turn the town upside-down with a frown upside-down
I smile through something fowl, and watch my money pile
I'm fucking with straight stacks, I'm kicking you straight facts
I hit you with it, bag it, pump it, bring me mines right back! (Now...)

Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, go 'head front, get fucked up!

Come Back Down,XV,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: XV]
Yeah, let me swing into the scene like a monkey do
Trying to make a point real bad like I run and shoot
Date a lot of girls but I'm married to my money boo
So why you trying to trip with me like this our honeymoon?
I am sitting comfy cozy childa meana Humphrey bogie
Seat up with my feet up in my neegas and a bunch of stogies
Light ‘em up in the gamer chamber, they call it my lair
Bitches in they bikini bottoms ‘cause I is such a square
Yeah, the life I live don't ever bore me
Indian reservations, it comes with the territory, they wanna hear my story
How my name ring in mo' towns like Berry Gordy but they ignore me?
So I flew up to this planet I call Squaria
A place where any nigga with street cred would be weary up
Thought it was a bad choice like getting married young
But it was very fun, now all of a sudden they is telling me to…

[Hook]
Come back down, come back down, come back down to earth
They telling me to come back down, come back down, come back down to earth
They is saying you is just too weird, yes you have made that clear
So I'm up in the sky ‘cause I like the view up here
They told me come back down
They told me come back down, come back down to earth
(I'm not the same, I am a martian
I'm not the same, I am a martian
I'm not the same, I am a martian
I'm not the same)

[Verse 2: XV]
Far from it, my drive like Happy Gilmore, even if niggas still score
They going par four ‘cause they have to still putt it
I'm making banks like Uncle Phil's mother
They think that I'm afraid to reach my peak but I got that hill covered
The difference between us is that he'll love her, he'll trust her
And wife her and I will still fuck her, ha-ha
Like a car sales man and I'm making it happen off of your stale plan
‘Cause I'm bringing it back to when niggas could really rap
While y’all fuck up the tracks like derailed trams
When I go over your head like blimps, I still make sense like a weed filled van
I don't even see sale scams, I just put in the same folder as email spam
So when I'm gone and they listen to my song
They can never say that Don ain't do what he felt man till I…

[Hook 2]
Come back down, come back down, come back down to earth
They telling me to come back down, come back down, come back down to earth
They is saying you is just too weird, yes you have made that clear
So I'm up in the sky ‘cause I like the view up here
They told me come back down
They told me come back down, come back down to earth
[Outro]
Yeah, you gone too far, reaching for the stars
You've done so much just to let it all slip away-away
Don't move too fast, gotta make it last
The world's waiting on you, just don't let it all slip away
Just come back down to us"

Hello, what up? Hello?
Yo, I can't, I can't hear you
Let me call you right back

[Verse]
I sense someone's tappin' into my phones, why do
I got this feeling in my bones I might die soon?
The FBI might be tryin' to pull my file soon
I might be walkin' blindfold into a typhoon
I might be seein' rockets light up the night sky
Right outside the window of my living room
And if they do, you can say good night
And bye-bye to them iTunes
If I don't try to record as much before I do
The plan is to have as many in the can as I can
As I stand before you in this booth a walking-dead man
Blank stare, dead pan, look on my face
As I gaze into space, as I wait to be scooped up in that van
As I mysteriously disappear into thin air
And they gonna say a sniper just appeared outta nowhere
And I'll go down in the history as the bloodsuckin' leech
Who hid behind the freedom of speech
Tried to take the 5th Amendment, use it, twist it and bend it
And ended up dyin' the villain, not the hero, splendid
Stupendous way to end this
I can feel the tremors tremendous
In remembrance of September 11th
Flashback to September 7th
When 2Pac was murdered in Vegas
He said it, he predicted his own death, let us never forget it
Should we ever live to regret it
Like the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated in broad day
By the crazed lunatic with a gun
Who just happened to work on the same block
In the library book depository
Where the President would go for a little Friday stroll
Shots fired from the grassy knoll
But they don't know, or do they?
Who's they for them to say ""touché""?
We're all vulnerable and it's spook-ay
This is about as kook-ay as I've ever felt now
Count down to nuclear meltdown
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
You can run, you can do what you want to
But you know you ain't gonna do nothin'
When it's time, it's your time, you are the prime target
You have become Public Enemy number one"

Light It Up,Kuniva,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Yeah, Uh, Yeah, Light it up Light it up

[Verse: Kuniva]
My whole city’s the truth
Henney and goose
I really hate the way those bitches did Proof with different stories
Seein my brother layin on the gurnie, it drove me insane
I’m in the office, pointin guns at my attorney
I tried to see the bright side, when talkin to my mother
She like, “at least it wasn’t like bugz, he didn’t suffer”
It seems not to matter when your life is straight shattered apart
A strong mind is nothing without the heart
And they took that away from the city
With half-ass investigating ass cops left his name looking gritty
I find myself cruising the streets
Wonderin how it would be, if it was me who was layin six feet
Would it be a bunch of niggas that I really didn’t fuck with
Sayin we were like brothers, talkin on some dumb shit
Doin things they know I would never approve of
Expressin their intrest in my money, that ain't true love
Knowin we didn’t get along when I was alive
All of a sudden its my name forever until you die
I’d probably be like Swaze in ghost, swingin wild but never connecting
Yo this shit is so depressing
I stop thinkin selfish, my dude had kids
Left with a lie about the last day that he lived
And I sit sheddin tears, that’s me and my little drama
I lost me a brother, but his kids lost a father
I think back to when he played me Kurt Cobain
We was at the Toy Soilders video shoot, I called him insane
Told him it was dope, but way too scary
He just smiled, popped the CD out and told me not to worry
The whole day I had goosebumps, none of us felt the concept of that video from the jump
But didn’t think that it would really happen
Who would’ve thought that, he didn’t stand a chance with the reeper, he would’ve fought back
But that bullet took his mind, and I believe that if he were hit anywhere else, he would’ve survived
Cops watchin with a microscope, waitin for the get-back
Pullin me over, searchin my car, like “where the fifth at?”
We watchin ya’ll, any retaliation that takes place, will be on your doorstep, it only made me more amped
But still I can't ignore that, but vengeance is the Lord’s
I’m prayin to god, wonderin what’s taking him so long
But back then I only see my pain, blinded by my own rage
Crusin through the east side with a gage
Heard my big brother in my ear, “Vahn go home”
At the same time, wifey hit me up on the phone
It was a sign tellin me to leave the bullshit alone
It was too late, I cannot bring him back, he is gone
We all have regets, wishin we would’ve been there
Shit would’ve been different, yo, it wouldn’t have went there
But it was gods plan, and part of bein a man is accepting his will even if you don’t understand
Cherish the ones around you who mean something
Although proof’s gone, I know he knows how much we love him
[Outro]
Uh, Light it up, Light it up (repeats)

I just wanna make you proud of me big homie, for sho

Step up now, tell me what your life like
Is it worth something? What’s the price like?
When I was still sleeping with the nightlight
You was out there living in the nightlife
Like you ain’t have a kid in your hindsight
I was coloring dad with my Lite-Brite
Just hoping you were looking for a clock
And one day, you’ll stop when you finally find time
It felt weird talking to my mom and I know she sees you in my eyes
And she gon’ get mad if I try to ask:
Do you know if my dad gonna stop by?
That play that you never saw, that ball that I never caught
All those years that we both have lost, man I hope you enjoy that all

I hope you bought the moon, I hope you reach the stars
I hope you found the things that you already lost
I hope you have it all, I hope you have it all
I hope you have it all, I hope you have it all

I hope you saw the things that you ain’t see in me
I hope you have it all, I hope you have it all

Closet so big, you can even fit a bed in
Middle school sweetheart, high school legend
Hotel suites so high, yellow ledges
No cable, dinner by the table
Dozens of roses whenever he’s able
Love so deep, it’s fatal, is this the kind of thing that you wait for?
Well I hope you are patient baby, wants and needs, it’ll make you crazy
Wants and needs, it’ll make you crazy, wants and needs, it’ll make you crazy

Promise you got something lord that will honor you
Blow your lil head off while you're tying your shoe

Get a doughnut urge and just splurge you bot he nerve to play third
In a softball tournament round my way say that's your word you bird
I'll put your beak on a curb but anyway
Looks like a good game the pigs ain't leaving so I'm a lay
Nice play just too bad it's your last
Couple bundles of D and 200 cash to sack you in the grass
So watch the teams line up shake hands guess the games over
Faggot nigga hopped in a Liberty fake Range Rover
I'm on his tail like Sonic little shorty palming on a 40
Broad day I'm trying to dodge a cover story
Look like he stopping for gass I'm a pluck him yay
This had to be his most unlucky lucky day
2 brothers come out of 7 Eleven in army wear and stand there
Acting like my tires need air
He closed the gas cap too many things going his way
So I just stashed that you probably think I'm bugging but hey
I know them games in Lindsay Park is every Sunday he ain't going nowhere
I went home switched gear went out and grabbed me a beer
10 drinks later I'm at Burger King window for a Whopper
Look left and see partner I hit the stash blokka

Rep that Louboutin bottom in my back pocket all day long

Niggas steady pushing Phantoms we don't see the opera

Then we out to Brazil I know niggas in Negril
That'd chop your fucking head off and throw it on a grill
Take the gold out your mouth and throw it in they grill
Send a finger to your moms and let her know that it's real

When it was hard she ain't budge

Brought me down when the temperature was down
Held me down when a nigga was down
Bought for, when I couldn't afford
But couldn't afford to leave the scene

Went directly to little debbies,blueberry juices,cherry now or laters, and a PayDay
Made me feel same way, it' was crazy

Transferred that directly into my game, aye!
Let them old people sit down
Right now you ain't gotta pay
Stop trying to be grown

So me, and you homie they looking through
Them scarves don't cover no scars
They guard from the stare of ours
God willing, they can see the gardens
Sometimes concealing is hard
'specially when you're living in a place like ours
When those and the powers that be
Loathing their clothing**
You looking good in God shirt, God Shoes, God purse, God hoodie
Just keep God first, lady and keep rolling. Yeah!

Hustlaz,Lupe Fiasco,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Uh-huh
Oh, baby
Talk to 'em
Oh, baby, ooh
It's what hustler's do
Oh, baby
This is a hustler's song
This hustler's gone (Thug life, [?])

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you what this fellow like, caught somewhere
Between stop and go like yellow lights, uh-huh
Hustler, so I gotta get it mellow, right?
Down the block, round the clock, bezel like
I roll like cherry red Jell-O dice
It's Was, just the pot callin' the kettle white
It's hot, just the block callin' the ghetto wife
This Paul McCain is my ball and chain, mi amor
Hopefully I won't fall and hang
Like pictures on the walls of halls of fame
It's just a boy, man, look what it all became
Good 'n all, but look at what all remains
All the flaws and things
Marks from all the claws and fangs
The remarks from all of y'all that changed, the
Bustin' back at all y'all I trained, the
Apologizing to all of y'all I blame
[Chorus]
This a hustler's due
And you ain't did it 'til a hustler's do
And you didn't know it 'til a hustler knew
And you ain't done 'til a hustler's through
I'm a customer too, it's what hustler's do
And you ain't seen it 'til you seen it from a hustler's view
Open your eyes, this a hustler's song
God forgive if the hustler's wrong (Uh)

[Verse 2]
It's bigger things so we Cosa Nostra
Striving to be number one 'til I overdose
I speak it now with a number tongue or the throat
Youngest son runnin' from older quotes
Thou shall not sin, thou shall not steal
Thou shall not kill, thou shall not
Turn your back on those in need, I try to flip
But these government switch keeps me at this chosen speed
I'm just a rose in weeds
And I rolls with reasons to stay on this road I lead
'Til I leave with what I sow, my sole in these
Leave my son with the sum of what I sold in deeds
I'm foldin' y'all
Prolly headed for the pin like bowling balls
Kept it directed at the pen and wrote it for y'all
[Chorus]
This a hustler's due
And you ain't did it 'til a hustler's do
And you didn't know it 'til a hustler knew
And you ain't done 'til a hustler's through
I'm a customer too, this what hustler's do
And you ain't seen it 'til you seen it from a hustler's view
Open your eyes, this a hustler's song
God forgive if the hustler's wrong

[Verse 3]
It takes a lot of patience when you takin' it on
A lot of pacin', a lot of makin' it known
I ain't the nigga that be placin' it on
I was the king of this city, now they replacing the throne
I know it's a lot of hatin' waitin' at home
And she ain't waitin', you can hear the bass in her tone
Like she can't make it alone, a broken home
And she the brace for the bone
All this from just embracin' the phone
A lot of ballin' up letters
A lot of erasing the poems
A lot of comin' to grips that you gonna be facin' alone
All this time, all this time you was wrong
You know whatever happens I got you
And when whatever happened to happen, they was happy to drop you
No letters or shoes, no cheddar
Your mom sow sweaters, [?] no better
[Chorus]
This a hustler's due
And you ain't did it 'til a hustler's do
And you didn't know it 'til a hustler knew
And you ain't done 'til a hustler's through
I'm a customer too, this what hustler's do
And you ain't seen it 'til you seen it from a hustler's view
Open your eyes, this a hustler's song
God forgive if the hustler's wrong

Yeah! Ay when you see me, salute

When you see me salute
And when you see me salute
When you see me salute
You ain't gotta speak homie when you see me salute

Raise your right hand to your hairline
Stand that attention hold it there until you're recognized
Once I return the salutation then it’s at ease, as you were, no conversation
Well, and lets just sayin' what it do G
Decorated 5-star general a true G
Made it fresher off the battlefield
Rep it for my niggas in the battle still
Yea with more stripes then a jail suit
Been in the lead, trail who?
When I fail, through bitches standin their cells
Takin pictures wit their cells
And let me tell you som'n 'bout a playa
Put me anywhere in any jail
And I shall prevail
And if another man survived I shall as well
Now fuck rap got swag for sale
You crossed my path in the A or Brazil

I abstain from the nonsense
Remain conscious
The idiots make idiotic comments
A convict wit a conscious
You lack moreals I can see your principles
And not what mines is
So I guess what makes me special
Just the gift and the curse
Like shit to get you rich at first
So put your dick in the dirt
That's why I don't gotta be the greatest of all time
As long as I keep it real in all my rhymes I'm fine
I ain't lying, give me mine and I'm satisfied
I'm just happy I got to make before my daddy died
And all things considered
Every time destiny called king delivered
None iller a young heart wit a old soul
Some hot hoes and a cold flow
And as far as keepin it real go
Homey when you need me
Don't forget the proper way to greet me

In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

Well, the years start comin' and they don't stop comin'
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin'
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

Pretty woman with me with this swoll donk
All she do is roll blunts She don't smoke 'em though
Ass clappin fantastical just like after I close the show
Applaud baby, ya'll may be knowin 'bout this cold ho
Naw mean son Like New York niggas
Bothers them I may have fathered them

Really I understand why nigga mad at me
Seem like all the women throw they ass at me
Sorry but you really know I ain't know
Doin' what I want yeah I'm doin what you can't ho
Everything I am is everything you ain't though
When I'm with your girl I'mma tell you what you ain't know
She jump up on this pole, swing around do your thing girl
And when you leave don't forget your ring girl
Don't forget your ring, don't forget your ring
Don't forget your ring, dont forget your ring
She jump on on this pole swing around do your thing girl
And when you leave baby don't forget your ring girl

No disrespect to you husbands
When I lay up with ya woman
We dont be kissin and snugglin'
She just be lickin and suckin'
I put the dick in like fuck it
You know what it is, you know what we did
But she don't come to my crib, I don't allow that
Bring that snow plow back, got some more ice
I need some liquor where the loud at
If life is just a beach this where a lot of niggas drown at
Nah this ain't no circus but i'll show you where the clowns at
Yea they over there, over here in this section
We fresher than a newborn, cut out of c-section
Yes man!
Thats what you got around you
Lost my fuckin' mind they break it down
And what I found ooh
Trigga world renowned
Who woulda predicted this im the illest shit to hit the fuckin mic
MC hit the lights, salt with the pepper black and white
What could be better right
She tell me push it push it
My lil spinderella
I got wine in the cellar
I got bank im no teller
If I bang then dont tell ya friend
Unless she tryna get it in
Losers im sure to win
Put that g code in again
Still im goin in to win
Im just in your lady friend

Lost and Found,Skewby,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]:
It must be me, weather just right
Thinking is it the ass or them pants too tight?
If something is wrong with winning then I can't do right
If what you doin' is livin' I just can't do life
I look at cars different since I seen a few flights
I look at girls different visiting these club nights
Chasin' money turn a man into a joke
My circle remains small only passes get revoked
I see your problem then I laugh until I choke
My future makes me love my past even more
Presently I'm out the bed on the go
Off the wall in some draws drowning in the love below
Love hater, blue singer, stay away
Somehow you only show up when you see the paper's made
I feel the same
Grilled chicken on a paper plate
Pay a little extra for the tea mixed with lemonade
Made champagne from the lemons life gave
But can't turn water into wine and I'll never save
I'm hella great, stuck in my propeller ways
Catch me in the land if my number ever stays the same
[Hook]:
I've lost and I've found
Been high and then down
At least I know just what lies here for me
Not turning around
Never running out
At least I know just what makes me
At least I know just what lies here for me
At least I know just what lies here for me
At least I know just what lies here for me
At least I know just what lies here for me

[Verse 2]:
I'm Alive, and I'm from Memphis
Raised here, Martin Luther died visiting
It ain't no pretty picnic
Just to think a loaf of bread got these niggas tripping
Grow up before you die young
I know the fast life seems cooler
Till the bottle gets empty and yo makeup ?? removal
That car runs out of gas and yo ass lose approval
Loving myself is working have you ever seen me losing?
Think about it, think about it
Misery loves company and you can't drink without it
Pull up a chair
I'll tell you how it feels doing push-ups in the air
Fuckin the whole world like she owe me
Damn girl, I know you see me calling
Told you I had a dream so why you showed me your coffin
Rise up, I'm tearin them thighs up
Busy showin' my ass cause they tried to hide us
Surprise, I'm being my own prize but
Tell them local rappers keep they hands tied up
They shoulda never put they hands out
Less than one for my past
Shut up and stand out
[Hook]

[Verse 3]:
It must be me, tired of the same room
Working so I don't retire as a lame groom
I got the tally man but I ain't try late bloom
It's now or never you should stay tuned
Big plans you should make room
Open the blinds
Impressive how I made F's but open up mines
I feel MC's been a waist, Calvin Klein
You in your own way not mine, why would I mind
Nothing else to do but climb
What the middle has to offer can't suffice I'm fine
How could they play me if they press rewind
Like is the truth small enough to fit inside a line
See my heart is on my collar and my sleeve
The battle field's in need
The war is on the outside but who said I would leave
They throw it all away damn I'm just growing peace
They wanna live it up man but I just wanna breathe
Man, I just wanna be
But that ain't asking much, that's if you asking me

At least I know just what lies here for me
At least I know just what lies here for me
At least I know just what lies here for me"

1-2, 1-2, 1-2, ugh
Yeah, ugh
Yeah, ugh

[Verse 1]
Miss High Profile, caught you shoppin' on Canal (Yeah)
I guess it makes sense, it seems phony as your style
Your hair and your nails just as phony as your smile
Fake eyelashes, you drew your eyebrows
It make a brother ask, do you pride yourself?
Your makeup like a mask, tryna hide yourself
It seems on the outside, you thinking you the shit (Uh-huh)
But there's a soul that's inside that you don't even knew exist
So you so out of touch that the world mistreat you
Rich niggas fuck you and broke niggas beat you
Hope that this will reach you when you understand
That your value ain't determined by another man
'Cause right now you let them brothers get the upper hand
And you just tell 'em ""Go deep"" like Cunningham
And you just let 'em OD like Len Bias
And that pussy so good he let his friends try it
[Chorus]
Losing your balance, yea uh
Losing your balance, yea uh
Losing your balance
Girl you losing your balance uh, yea
Don't slip and don't fall, uh
Just a get a grip my nigga, hold on, uh
Don't lose your balance (Yeah, ugh)
Don't lose your balance (Ugh)

[Verse 2]
I look around at my city, this is Sinville
That boy 11 years old and can inhale
Sometimes I ride around wonderin' if we in hell
Or why do cops love to throw a nigga in jail
I'm 'bout to lose it, I just had another friend killed (Damn)
Over some bullshit this cycle's like a windmill
I had a convo with my soul, I asked it ""When will
This shit change?"" It said, ""Boy, just use them pen skills""
And so I write this for my niggas on the corner
Love you 'cause you my brother, so I feel I got to warn ya
This shit ain't set up for a young brother to advance
On that note, you niggas playing right into their hands
Damn, better get yourself some goals (Uh-huh), you niggas better dream (Yeah)
I know the hood raised you but it's bigger better things
And for those that passed, I need a moment of silence
Sssssshhhhh
[Chorus]
Yeah, and don't be losing your balance
Don't be losing your balance
Don't be losing your balance
My nigga, don't be losing your balance, uh, yeah
So don't slip and don't fall
Just a get a grip my nigga, hold on (Yeah)
Don't lose your balance (Ugh)
Don't lose your balance (Yeah)

[Verse 3]
Ugh, I got a thing for this little mama
She do it to me plus her brain is forreal, I'm a
Sucka for love I guess, won't catch her up in the club 'cause she ain't into that (Nah)
Kind of chick that rather rent a flick and get intimate
Say she never fuck with thug niggas only gentlemen
And yea that ass is fat but what's better is her intellect (Uh-huh)
Other men would sweat her when we walk past
Can't even blame 'em, did the same when I saw the ass
Matched with the thin waist, brown with a slim face
Love the conversation and the kicks was like a sensei
Now she got me chillin' with her all around the clock
My homies beefin' 'cause I never come around a lot
Keep on telling me I changed and things ain't the same
And ever since she came around I never want to hang (Ugh)
They tell me that it's foul how a chick can make me switch
But man I can't help it dawg, her mind got me whipped
[Chorus]
I think I'm losing my balance, uh
I think I'm losing my balance, yea
She got me losing my balance, uh
She got me losing my balance, yea
But I, I won't slip, nah, I won't fall, ugh

Losing my balance (Uh-huh)

Yo, man, what's up?
This riding motherfucker, jack me at rollin' 'round bumping ’cause music's too loud, you know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, this is P-O to the G-O
Motherfuckin' cop just jacked me 'cause I was drinking beer in Mill Valley
What's up, man?
Aight, man, fuck 'em

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I don't give a fuck
They done pushed me to my limit, I'm all in
I might blow up any minute, did it again
And now I'm in the back on the paddy wagon
While this cop's bragging about the nigga he's jackin'
I see no justice, all I see is niggas dyin' fast
The sound of a gun blast, then watch the hearse pass
Just another day in the life, G
Gotta step lightly 'cause cops tried to snipe me
The cabs, they don't wanna stop for a brother, man
But damn near have an accident to pick up another man
I went to the bank to cash my check
I get more respect from the motherfuckin' dope man
The Grammys and American Music shows
They pimp us like hoes, take our dough, but they hate us, though
You better keep your mind on the real shit
And fuck tryin' to get with these crooked-ass hypocrites
The way they see it, we was meant to be kept down
Just can't understand why we gettin' respect, now
Mama told me there'd be days like this
But I'm pissed 'cause it stays like this
And now they're trying to ship me off to Kuwait?
Give me a break, how much shit can a nigga take?
I ain't going nowhere, no how
Bush wanna throw down?
You better bring the gun, pal
'Cause this is the day we make 'em pay
Fuck bailing hay, I better spray with an AK
And even if they shoot me down
There'll be another nigga bigger
From the motherfuckin' underground
So step but you better step quick
'Cause the clock's going tick and I'm sick of the bullshit
You're watching the makings of a psychopath
But you sit and laugh before the wrath and aftermath
Who's that behind the trigger?
Who do you think? A motherfuckin' 90's nigga
Ready to buck and rip shit up, I had enough
(Yeah) And I just don't give a fuck
[Verse 2: Pogo]
Nigga, it ain't just the blacks
It's also a gang of motherfuckers dressed in blue slacks
They say niggas hang in packs and they attitude is shitty
So, tell me, who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city?
They say we niggas like to do niggas
So me and a cop are just two niggas
A street-walkin' nigga and a beat-walkin' nigga
With a badge, I end his future and his past
With a blast, take his cash before I dash, I bash his head in
Dump him at the dead end and that's just his luck
'Cause a nigga like P don't really give a fuck

Walked in the store, what's everybody staring at?
They act like they never seen a motherfucker wearing black
Following a nigga and shit, ain't this a bitch?
All I wanted was some chips
I wanna take my business elsewhere, but where?
’Cause who in the hell cares
About a black man with a black need?
They wanna jack me like some kind of crack fiend
I wonder if he knows that my income
Is more than his pension, salary and then some
Your daughter is my number one fan
And your trife-ass wife wants a life with a black man
So who's the mack? In fact, who's the blackjack?
Sit back and get fat off the fat cat
While he thinks that he's gettin' over
I bust a move as smooth as Casanova
And count another quick mill'
I'm getting paid for my trade, but I'm still real
And if you look between the lines you'll find a rhyme
As strong as a fuckin' nine
Mail stacked up, niggas wanna act up
Let's put the gats up and throw your blacks up
But the cops getting dropped by the gunshot
Used to come but he's done, now we run the block
To my brothers, stay strong, keep your heads up

[Hook]
When I walk motherfucker, my uzi weighs a ton
When I talk motherfucker my uzi weights a ton

[Verse 1]
Never will I resign I'm a soldier for life
I'm mastering my circumference controlling the mic
Behold the light
Some niggas die for their ice
See I'll part with the chain, but I'mma die for the Christ
This time I baptise with fire
Roll with a thousand soldiers like Jeremiah
Call me sire
Hitman for hire
Show me the money like J McGuire
Build my empire in the midst of the fire
Who do men say that I am, I'm a stumbling stone
I'm never too far from home cause the Earth's my throne
I'm the king supreme superb out the third, ya heard
Magnolia made me a soldier throwin dice on the curb
Crucified me the first day, I'm rockin ice on the third
Burning circles on hood corners rocking mics and them birds
I got my hard hat my work gloves, I'm ready to rock
So beware of this heavy hardware, we steady to drop
[Hook]
When I walk motherfucker, my uzi weighs a ton
When I talk motherfucker my uzi weights a ton

[Verse 2]
Bring seven emcees, put them in a line
Go get seven other cornballs who think they can rhyme
It'll take seven more before I go for mine
That's twelve sucka niggas with a gash in they perm
Plus nine other motherfuckers drastically burned
It's a horrible lesson indeed, but has to get learned
It's the new world order
We kidnapped rap and took her south of the border
While cats rock three-sixty waves, white tees, girbauds, and diodoras
Young guns is raised in the little shop of horror
When drama get to popping and the shit get out of order
The choppers'll chop a hole up in the door of your explorer
The coppers'll pop a hole up in the door of your aurora
Watchers, dime dropper to copper sing them a story
Niggas is shiesty eh? in the land where they trill with it
Stress is a motherfucker, man, nigga deal with it

[Hook]
When I walk motherfucker, my uzi weighs a ton
When I talk motherfucker my uzi weights a ton

[Verse 3]
Nas gave me some sweet advice, uh huh
He came like a man with it
Took it and ran with it
I'm a turn the rap game to the summer of Sam with it
If anybody asks tell em the son of man did it
That's right, you know my name I got the devil on the run
Why? Cause my motherfuckin uzi weighs a ton
And I'm squeezing on you fuckers with the mic in my hands
That'll be terrorizing rappers from Detroit to Japan"
The Flying V,XV,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: XV]
Welcome to the Vizzy Zone, glad you came across ‘em
Out to get them plaques so I’m never ever flossing
What’s your girl’s name? I just pray you say it’s awesome
‘Cause ‘fore the night is over, you’ll say that I’m fucking awesome
I am not one of Martin’s friends, but that boy cold
Ball like Tommy when I walk into a sto'
Ball like Sonic when that hedgehog tuck and roll
And all I wanted was what I was fucking owed
I don’t need no damn chorus, just bring your camcorders
The flow is unobtainium and Vizzy’s Pandora
Uh, I don’t trap but I am Venus Fly
And I be eating raps alive in my little shop of horrors
In my prime, I’m Optimus, I’m a Transformer
Stepped up in the game to hang my green Jansport up
Everybody searching with the hopes of finding me
‘Cause I am in my zone, I call this one the Flying V and I am back
Vizzy Zone, Vizzy Zone, Vizzy Zone, Vizzy Zone going gone

[Verse 2: XV]
Vacate the zone as the game makes it known
You won’t stay here for long, I stand behind my bars like Mayday Malone
So you can bank on me like savings and loans when I’m making my songs
King of the city, yeah they made me a throne
So everybody hating, better save up they stones
I try to show my life in every rhyme I lay on
Dying to my shine like Sierra Leone
Cool it down, I’m burning up, in the lab like Sherman Klump
Now I get that buddy love, boy you never heard of such?
Come through with some dutches, I ain’t talking ‘bout that Fergie stuff
And burn it up, baby, we can kick it like the Derby Cup
I’m playing Hide-And-Seek on the mountain’s highest peak
Even making noises in the places that the lions sleep
Everybody searching with the hopes of finding me
But I am in my zone, I call this one the Flying V and I am back
Vizzy Zone, Vizzy Zone, Vizzy Zone, Vizzy Zone going gone
[Verse 3: XV]
My name is Vizzy, I’m the answer, open up the lanterns
Now they see I got the game closed like hampers
I never S.A.T, if you test me, I will stand up
Man, I been this way since I was walking in a pamper
Catch me in Atlanta, talking to a dancer
But I don’t make it rain dear, you can talk to Prancer
Now she wanna go to the back, I’m like why not?
As long as I put a hat on my nuts like Planters
Ha, and all the suddenly, they up on me
‘Cause I be eating beats like Doug Funny be
Money be hanging out my LRG dungarees
You wondering how I got my buzz, well you know how them honeys be
Freshmen, I ain’t one of them, ten of them make one of me
Going from point A to B, I just hope y’all come to see
Everybody searching with the hopes of finding me
But I am in my zone, I call this one the Flying V and I am back
Vizzy Zone, Vizzy Zone, Vizzy Zone, Vizzy Zone going gone"
Pokemon Master,Stick Up Kids,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: J Rob]
They ignore facts
Like that I torch tracks
But they insist of sleeping on me more than snorlax
Oh you got the four packed?
And you blast toys? That's
Horse crap
Everytime there's trouble you avoid that
Go against me and with you I will wipe the floor
Drive to the hospital, ask the nurse, find the floor
Bring you more harm
Rip that thing out your arm
And leave that spot where there was an IV Sore
Think we harmless weedles
But when you start the beef we'll
Head toward your guys
Metamorphosize and
Swarm like Beedrills
Oh, you don't like us? Ditto
But kiddo, you're trying to be just like us?… Ditto
If I wanted head or dome
I'd spit a clever poem to yo sparrow
That would have her wanting to take this Fearow home
To beat, but Jay's married…
And those clefairies couldn't do that with a metronome
[Verse 2: J Rob]
Oh, they bad boys like Biggie and Puff?
But as soon as the cops put them into the cuffs
They start singing like Wigglytuff
I'm more fly than Butterfree, Pidgeot, Moltres Jigglypuff
I told you JR's hot
And how I'm spitting it up
Like Arbok
I hope you stockpile your rhymes
Me rapping should be a violent crime
You don't have the skills to be the master
That title is mine
I'm a talented man
And there you are hating without any fans
Then watch the rhymes I kick, Alakazam
They don't get it so they say I'm on some Odd-ish
Introduce your side to gloom, when I spit a vile plume of hot shit
Pay attention so you don't miss the rhyme
Even if my foe is a chick, I will bury-her mister mime
And I love it when spry Jabronies try
I get more excited than when I find a shiny Ponyta"

I'm the ( ) pass a hundred in that red Ferrari
Me and Weezy Blood brothers, we got red Ferraris
Red tops in the hood, red tops on Bacardi
Red tops on top models at the after party
Before S dot Carter was Brooklyn's step-father
I was getting G money like Nino at the Carter
I was just a baby, like the face on the third Carter
Even had a baby face, like Tracy Evan's baby father
Nigga, so you know what I mean
When I say I get the money like a money machine, yeah
I'm in L.A. Gasol-in'
But when I'm in New Orleans, you can call it Chris Paul-in'

What am I saying? I'm ahead of all of ya'll niggas
And mine gon' shine like Armor All hit us
Hah! I wear that chopper like a uniform
You bitch niggas never see me like a unicorn
Who the boy make the girls go crazy
I got that Red Magic, unbelievable, amazin'
Hey, it's a beautiful day

We in the house like a home invasion
And this time I'm gon' shine like the chrome on Dayton's
You can wait on Detox or you can have more patience
Baby sip that patrone as we get wasted
Weezy, we sip lean, me I just taste it
We be soakin' up syrup like a waffle house apron
Infrared beam go back to the basement
I'mma street king, ask dude from the Matrix
Yeah, Cash Money in the basement
Me and Slim like the Hot Boys with a face lift
Translation, it's Freddy versus Jason
Who your favorite rapper, me and Weezy will erase them
And if they gettin' money then, we will paper chase them
With beams that glow in the dark like Kanye's stage shit
Then we highjackin' Kanye's spaceship
And land it on the Red Carpet at the VMA's bitch

The Breakup Song,Wale,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Intro
[Verse 1: Wale]
Yeah, see, breaking up is hard
To move along, it's even harder
It's over, she got colder, now
Can't locate where her heart is
And I'm just being honest
Since we not even talking
My mind won't let you go
Shit, even consider stalking now
You know I be teasing, though
You know that my ego won't
Thought this was forever love
Guess that was just seasonal
She got back with her old boy
She probably had a reason though
Although thought that we would grow
Guess that wasn't feasible
But we ain't gonna be beefing, no
I miss you at my recent show
I speak to CJ often and sometimes
I just want to speak you up
Yeah, hit you up
Or call you up, or send a text
Your new man got my respect
So if I do call it's just a check
Heard that you alright though
My nigga for life though
It's funny how this life go
We love for a while then a light goes
Took me a while just to write those
Pride, I had a fight so
I'mma stop right there and I know you don't care
But I hope you got that bite, boo, ay
[Verse 2: Wale]
Yeah, tell me about the love of ours
""Contemplate"", I wrote about her
We no longer close or nothing
That's why she ignore my flowers
And my call and my text
Spending her time with him I guess
I regret some shit I did
But darling, is y'all intimate?
Who was better? I know I was
Don't you lie, don't blow my buzz
You ask me who I'm stroking now
I say that the pool is closed
Can we stay broken up?
And all these pages, close them up
I hope we both do learn from this
So my next joint don't got to be so rough
Huh, got to get better with time
Relationships should never rewind
Better leave it all behind
Guess that means you can never be mine
Well, um, there's a but
Without your love it's cold as fuck
Life is a movie we both say ""cut""
But most times darling the sequel sucks"
Atlanta on Fire,Stat Quo,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: Stat Quo]
I'm the next one next one
Motherfuckers can't fuck with me with me
Got a problem shorty come get me
Nah, I ain't Dr. Dre, nah, I ain't Eminem or 50, dog I’m Stat

[Verse 1: Stat Quo]
As I think back, retract, from the classroom to the trap
Freida's only son had to hustle for scraps
It's hard to relax when your wage minimum, bein' broke
Fuck, with my adrenaline before Dre and Eminem
I was trying to get on demo tapes state to state
Performing at clubs and doing whatever it takes
Relying on faith hopin' my dreams take shape
And my fate meeting (?)
I would wait for these A&R’s say I ain’t grind bitch
Spendin' my last dime on this studio time shit
A lot of folk told me I was stupid for trying this
Situation crucial feds off in my climate
Home environment taking pictures of me it was ugly
The spot got hot, scene felt like curry
Had my vision blurry to underground Atlanta
Hit the streets me and Zeke put a plan together
Shorty it's now or never down to do whatever
You see the rainfall came but I had to bear that weather
Look your boy need cheddar like a mill or better
I was fed up but the benefit was worth the effort
[Bridge: Stat Quo]
I'm patiently waitin', used to get love
Now the same niggas hatin', wanna give me slugs
Partner don't get it separated or twisted, you can't fade it
Stat's the wrong motherfucker to play with, understand me

[Bridge: Eminem]
If you opened up your ears long enough to listen
You may hear what you've been missin' out all of this time
I've been put in a position to put all this in position
So quit your bitchin', learn how to rhyme
Get signed and get your shine

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's like this and like that and, uh, welcome to Statlanta
Shady Aftermath and, uh, a brand new rapper from Atlanta
Who goes by the name of Stat Quo
Introducing our new excuse to keep producin'
Continue to do music, use it and expand it and make rap grow
The hottest new shit on the planet, on a new plateau
But don't confuse it, you don't understand it
Let me break it down for you to show you how we do shit
So that you cats know, this is Statlanta 101
Cause we don't want no one walking out this motherfucker with tunnel vision
So anyone with questions you want answered
Just ask and we'll try to unmask them and maybe explain why so few cats blow
Just spit the truth when you get in this booth and do that though
That there boy hot to death, you already knew that though
Is he the greatest from the ATL, we got haters all day to debate us
So we'll just say this: he's one of them not to tackle
[Bridge: Stat Quo]
I got caviar wishes, box Chevy dreams
CD covers, TV screens
The booth or the block, might go to triple beam
I'mma make it right, hear me, huh huh huh
Fuck what your saying, God put me here to shine
Going on tour or white collar crime
The rhyme or the grind, MPC or the nine
I'mma make it, I need mine, huh huh huh

[Verse 3: Stat Quo]
I can care less, fuck yall, you don't make or break me
Real niggas love me, pussy niggas hate me
Down bitches ride for Stat Quo, they know
The A-Town D Young County be trill folk
Didn't no other label offer me no deal
Till they found out Shady/Aftermath was interested
Then they started to beg, want the truth, there it is
This ain't a gimmick, this the south and I be that kid
Just ride through watching lines of his rhymes
In time you're going to find you're on a great trip
Ain't a word I could life be some extraordinary shit
The piece of the puzzle that fit, it's Stat Quo, you son of a bitch

I keep a couple hoes, like Santa, I keep a vixen
Got that Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Dixon, Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen
I'm hotter than a hundred degrees
A lot of bread, no sesame seeds
If I'm in your city, I'm signing them tig-ole-bitties
I'm plotting on how I can take Cassie away from Diddy
The girls want a Minaj, yeah, they wetter than a rainman
Usher, buzz me in, everybody loves Raymond
