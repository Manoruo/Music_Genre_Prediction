Romans Revenge Freestyle,King Los,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Los (hahaha)

Oh my god stand back you can not be serious
A box of tampax couldn't stop me, period
I be killin' every track so the slayer never stops
I just bang bang bang like the Wayans brothers pops
Will I take a brother's spot?
Dont cops hate niggas?
Don't paper cover rock?
Dont rock break scissors?
Dont I say the sickest shit
Make a critic shit
In his britches
Make a British bitch
Send me titty flicks
Go shorty its your birthday
Gave her 50 cent
No bucks no bank yup shit's ridiculous
Haters finna get back
3 feet I'll get that 3 feet pushed back
3 feet I meet the track
Like track meet actor
Least break the record
So whoever made it after
Me's takin second
Take a second recognize the motherfuckin level I am on
2nd place is only good when you buyin homes
So whatchu buying homes, Impalas on polished chrome
YES! cuz a nigga got next like collar bones
(uh uh) I be crushin them faggots
And my bars O.D but im a functionin' addict
Catch a nigga in my lane and I'm a dust em in traffic
Im a deadbeat dad I dont fuck with you bastards
I got one .22 two loaded clips
Three .45's 6 shots and a couple of caskets
Then I snap snap flashback backtrack
Black hat backpack black ac blap blap blap blap
Wack rap cats get nap mats I'm kat stack
Black Lac' all black snap back my cash stack
I'm past that the point of no return
If a nigga snitchin on me then that pointer don't return
I knock his mask off that nigga stealin' from me
And I chop his hands off then his pointer don't return
Burn from the fire of my litta richa
Study this it might make you a little richer
Great balls of fire no Little Richard
I'm cut too big for your little britches
My truck too big for your little bridges
My nuts too big for you little bitches
To suck on so get the fuck on or fuck off
Your heart disappear when its war time no love loss
Wuddup dawg mention me I get gung-ho
Getcha haters up like me and Miss Monroe
One more time for my niggas in the jungle
You're a ant I could make a lion say uncle
Fester invest in the ves im the bester
Blessed her mic like Mike like Drexler
I love ropes and rings I might like wrestlers
I'm restless I jump on the mic quite reckless
Etch-a-sketch watch with the light bright necklace
All yellow avirex bright white Lexus
Knock your block off not quite like Tetris
Throw my bone out to your wife like fetch this
Question whatever the question is I'm the answer
But put this on repeat I dont miss a beat I'm a dancer
Answer me this how many you niggas just can't believe this
I smashed this, Jesus!"
Knuck If You Buck,Lil Wayne,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1 - Mack Maine]
Young Maine for President
I'll probably paint the White House black if it was my residence
Bush back in office, some niggas feel that's irrelevant
Cause they still pedalin' this medicine, but anyway, anyday
I can zurk off quick and make my semi spray
Send some of my men away just to blow your men away
Stephon Marbury type bullets, they like the penetrate
Young Money, we outta school, but we got chemistry
Young Spitta, Young Maine, Young Cop, Young Mobb, Tez Poe
We don't pass the rock nigga, we ball hog
Mad slow in the Escalade nigga, y'all all fall
Jack your fresh ass Caddy and steal your white walls
Nigga, we don't like y'all
Hell yeah, we will fight y'all
We ain't on no Tyson shit
We ain't tryna' bite y'all
Knuckin' if you buckin', probably bustin' at your cousin
How youngins' that spout something
Y'all niggas ain't 'bout nothin'
[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
Nigga we bussin', and bussin', to the bang of buss
No, we don't run for the Olympics, but the flame with us
I got that tussin', that scummy, and that angel dust
So pick your high, I will supply and correct changes, what's up
We bring the bussin', we bussin' like this thang for us
You niggas is sleeveless man, you can't hang with us
I got a bitch who speak Spanglish
She keep her bangles danglin'
And the cocaine is right up in her anus
Old Wayne is right up in the spot where he supposed to
Be, got Hova at the game and now he coachin'
Me, but I've been the champion, happy as I ever been
Lampin' in the Hamptons like, what the fuck is a hammock
The chef up in the kitchen like, what the fuck is a sammich
I'm like, we gotta find middle ground, we need balance
Challenge me, that be to my advantage
I'm outstanding, like standing outside up in the twister and walking not damaged
Standing outside up in the blizzard and walking hot handed
Serving nicklebags in Iraq, bet I will not panic
Swerve the nickel black, if I wreck, bet I will not panic
Cop another one the next day and drive it crazier
The seats will be lazier, shit'll be gravier
Nina Sarafeena my girl, so then I baby her
Wavin' at her at 2 crazy, Fugazis, I'm too brazen, 3 brazees deep
We got .380s and P80
9s, 9s, M-10ss and M1s and 12 gauges
Shell cases, money put up for jail cases, bail make it
My momma say, tuck your chain son, they'll take it
I hit her with one of them stale faces, like
I'll be damned momma, they know who I am momma
I'm still your little boy, but to them, I'm the man momma
Fuck with your boy, man Hollygrove the hood, nigga
Throw it in your face 'til you get that understood
[Verse 3 - Curren$y]
Niggas know I'm heavy with the coke, with the coke
In the Impala SS and sittin' heavy on the spokes
Never am I broke man, I'm playin with some change
I get a nigga soaked like he playing in the rain
And everywhere I go, a ho starin' at my chain
I'm the most valuable player in the game
All these haters wanna ride me
Cause I got more kicks than niggas with black belts in karate
Keep a redbone with a real nice body
Just copped a 'Lac and a yellow Maserati
Niggas ain't fuckin with the dawg
When Young Money shoppin', we don't leave nothing in the mall
These niggas ain't as rich as us
Man your rims too small, get your motherfucking inches up
Cause I copped me a Benz today
Just to go on 106 & Park and hand the keys over to Free and AJ
Yeah"
Thinkin bout You,Diggy,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","(Diggy)
Uhh yeah, uh uh uh uh yeah...
But girl, I gotta let you know that...

[Hook: Bei Maejor]
I know we're apart but
You still got my heart and...
Do you ever, think about me?
No I don't deserve this
What we had was perfect
I just want you to know, girl
That I'm always, Thinking bout you

[Verse 1: Diggy]
Hey Ms. Anonymous
Lately I've been reminiscing
On all our kisses and what we had
I'm kind of missing, it got me trippin'
Cause everything just been so different and
Every time I'm in the heights, It got a nigga thinkin'
What if she better off without me just runnin' abroad
Do she got a new man or just waiting up on my calls?
Can't figure it out but I know I gave you my all
Funny how you took it for granted and then just called it off
The jewelry , the flowers , them late night hours
When I would confess the way I felt told you
I thought the world was ours
But I guess I was mistaken
Because when I was in Vegas
I got a call when you were saying that you couldn't take it
What? Yeah she said it was just too much
Girl what you think this was a crush?
Nah, I wasn't even in a rush
But the way you had me feelin'
I thought you wanted us
[Hook: Bei Maejor]

[Verse 2: Diggy]
Everything seemed so perfect, almost like a dream
I guess a nightmare in disguise is all that you can see
But through the eyes of everyone around as well as me
We knew that our chemistry incredibly made us complete
So when it went down I was at a loss for words
I couldn't take it everything that I just heard
And anything that happened between us was now a blur
Cause only last week we were good then that occurred
So unexpected, your behavior didn't reflect it
Felt disconnected something between us intersected
All the affection gone, what happened to the blessing
We had together for so long, you and I perfected
I bet to you it didn't mean a lot
I mean I know you said it did, but right on the spot
You went and ban me from your life like a boycott
Well just imagine how much hurt this boy got

[Hook: Bei Maejor]

[Bridge: Diggy]
Late night just putting up a fight
With my feelings when I know it ain't right
Ain't never had this much strife in my life
But baby I can't stop
Thinking bout you

You can see it in her poker face, I got her folding
Baby girl if you getting high, I got the potion
Now them hoes ain't choosing, nigga I'm already chosen
I ain't blind I can see you hate, I keep it rolling
They just mad cause they not here and I'm the opposite of cold
And I'm getting fast money, yeah the opposite of codeine

I'mma take her home cause this the after party
Get turnt up we already got started

And I'm smoking on some good, euphoric
Put my CD in and she gon' like you for it
Kid Ink baby, say hi to the bad guy
Only one year and I ain't nothing like the last guy

Innocent eyes like that of a turtle
Purple nurple, titty twister
Wet willy, my fuzzy verbal math is
Silly but cute, a fat gerbil
11foot8.com
Hot mom, Dodge Caravan
Monster truck wheels, who cares, man?
New Chairman Mao
But dumb, gun shy, dumb guy
Run blind towns with one eye
While any child pop star malfunctions
All black Maybachs turn to pumpkins
In 2012, oh welly well
In a belly shirt, R. Kelly
Kirk Hammett shredding bananas
Damn, blood

[Verse 2 - Heems]
Damn, blood
I lay back to the max like why gild the lily
Rock shows from Philly to the Billy Billy
For silly kids who burn Phillies
Swishers, Dutchies, East Indian Masters
With the ghetto blaster, talk about Shasta
Vijay Iyer, DR
It's free jazzmataz
Scream on your ass like a minority dad
Minorities mad, who you foolin, B?
White people's skin is their jewelry

Do it Hima, me?
Maneuvering's nothing new to me
Ma, Nuva ring's nothing new to me
Cuban, B, poking the baloney
You people so Ponyboy
Macho Man Randy scandalous savages more noble
Porno, global, corner store, Pedialyte
Mosquito bite Peter (???)
And politics is no fun for young guns
Young ones want fun
Give it to them, take it from them, make them want it
Wake and bake, one take Jakes taking bacon from them

[Verse 4 - Heems]
I take one of your chicks
Straight from under your armpit
The brown Brad Pitt, Mark Ruffalo
Something like the Duffman
Tough man, duff your mans like w's, man
Yoga fire, copyright infringement
Kids is getting it in
Babies having babies, navy colored avies
Maybe you could pay me
Cyberbully lame bands until they murk themselves
Working themselves up over nothing
Bumping something cooler than what bump in your tape player
Playa, I'm great, stay away, rare flare mayor
Good luck
Hooligans packing toolies, acting unruly
Fiji water, greed disease
Please, all I need is sess and a cool breeze
Maybe some palm trees, some leaves to eat
And a roof over my dome, a home
[Verse 5 - Kool A.D.]
Alone, MacCaulay Culkin Straw Dogs
Don't even go there again, girlfriend
There's your man, spray-tanning Dakota Fanning
At the Getty gas station
Petty cash making
Chuck E. Cheese, mouse traps, star power
Nap 20 minutes like Da Vinci did
Lewinski lips on the Frisbee
Quick, look, it's the Dixie Chicks
RISD, bricks, thizzy(?), get with me
If you want it, and if you don't want it, then don't

[Verse 6 - Heems]
I won't
The brother cold, scold foes
Ace Ventura seventh grade humor tumor
Family Guy quoting for laughs
You played out
See something, spray something
Get sprayed out
No way out
My senorita que loque
Like no way ose
Dimelo hombre que fue
This is your brain on drugs, frying
The white man like Simba, Mufasa, lying
If I'm lying I'm dying, trying, buying time

Poo poo pee pee type, tonight get light
Get right, right in the head

New Jamba Juice is my house
New my house is your house
My new mouth is your blouse
I GMail spoken word poetry to a cloud
That Dick Cheney made with his brain piece
Diplo's drunk ass approved it
For bringing back all that smart shit that's actually stupid
I'm actually pooping in my hand and throwing it at Superman
Spiderman vs. X-Men, who's gonna win?
Tannins, Obama
Structural steel, what's it all mean?
Bear Vasquez, pause
I wear baskets on my head sometimes
Don't ask me where, ask if you can buy some and how much it is
Your sister put me on her bucket list
If you don't like this song, go suck a dick
This is the best song ever
Better than ""Juicy,"" better than ""Fur Elise""
Better than any song made by Jay-Z
Better than ""Two Weeks"" by Grizzly Bear
That's a pretty good song, right? You like that one?
It's better than the intro song to Pee-Wee Herman

I make def tunes, take from MF DOOM and Jeff Koons
No one left for the restrooms when I got on stage
I can rock the mic to silence by John Cage
With the arty flavor, I shoot the gift like a party favor
Flip the script and make it do cartwheels
Feel smart, steal hearts and start meals with chocolates
I drop gems like I got holes in my pockets
Why talk, heck, oh fuck
I catch wreck like a tow truck, silly kid
I'm iller than the Iliad and flow more than Shoah
While you're so corny you've gotta SOH CAH TOA
Pem Das EFX the number one skirmisher
I'm in the house like furniture, pessimist
I'll push the envelope off a precipice
I push the envelope so hard, it says 'excuse you'
Take two and pass, make you spin on your ass
Like a green paint sprinkler on white grass
I'm rapping, son (you're not my dad)
If you think you think outside the box, you're trapped in one
I'm advancing the art form, depantsing a fart storm
Some people don't like thinking, I guess it's too hard for 'em
My dope duds don't touch soap suds
I keep it realer than a rotoscope does
I keep it more Gully than Jonathan Livingston
Brag rhymes have no lag times, acrostics, narratives
Fibonacci challenge poems, declarative palindromes
Manifestos, my five fans can attest, yo
Coming soon, Morse code
Kiragami, Krikigami, Kirigami, Origami
Bombard you with retardulous wordplay
Rhymes come so easy I issue harsher restraints
And if I had any rhythm, maybe you'd finally faint
The way I communicate can make a frickin' eunuch mate
I write first person, light verse in a white hearse
And I'm the Ne plus ultra of B plus culture
My goal is to make you go Holy frijoles
Jesus H. Christ, where H stands for Holy crap
To boldly rap into the outer reaches, this doubter teachers
Defining God as aligning a divining rod with your reclining bod
Cause life is fickle, hellish, anemic, sickle cellish
Dude, you'll get chopped up like pickle relish
And when we perish, we're...
What's the term dude? Worm food!
Worm food, friends' memories fade
You're remembered by what you've made
So I intertwine my mind and my rhymes in a braid
I bungee jump into my grungy dump
And come up with a trust fundy, dust bunny, spongy clump
I got a very goth towel, a terry cloth cowl
And when I wear it, I'm a hairy moth owl"

The future of your life is right in front of your eyes

In 2015 (fi-fifteen, fi-fifteen)

The year is here
Watching us squarians lives appear
L7′s all up in the air
They scared, we gave them a warning like global warming
I guess they didn’t care
Well, I would never ever allow that to control me
To see if you out last ya homies
Turn to XV when they weren’t fucking with me like foreplay
They abbreviated the OutKast like OK
It’d be a while for you see me, G
Next flow is PPV on MP3
Genuinely bare it all like MGD
But now it all seems closer like it’s in 3D
Welcome to the future
Flux capacitors capacity is to the maximum
While I’m asking them what’s a masterpiece
Cause next year ain't gon be what it seems
Year of the squarians, 2015

It’s like the second season of V
We coming for em all
They bitches screaming at me
For wishing on star
Surprising the fuck out of them, look
I’m droppping jaws, they leaving it up to me
To fix the ending of Lost
They all on they toes
And niggas that spit flows is cool
But I feel like I got more to prove
So when niggas stay bussin’ when y’all drove to school
In the cut like Neosporin in the open wound
Nominated for major dudes that supposed to lose?
I’m outta space cause I never was a local dude
Turned up noses and boo’s turned to ohh’s and oooh’s
All the fans I have now are probably mostly new
Cause niggas drop off and knock off
They probably would never pop off
And though I know I’m clutch
They won't let me get the shot off
And fuck em all, thought I wouldn’t succeed
Til they see, next year will be 2015
[Hook]

Yeah, you might be able to tell
Bout the atmosphere
Where we are, Squaria
Next year is the year that all Squarians been waiting for a very long time
I know that on Earth its called 2011

Situation critical cause shit ain't nothin nice
Motherfuckers play for keeps so niggas lose they life
Money comes in different ways, the dope game's kinda slow
Niggas used to havin money are lookin kinda po'
Dank or dope, there ain't no hope these niggas peelin' caps
Gangstas pullin major leagues and brag about the jack
Situation critical this chewy got me stuck
Indo calm a nigga down but keeps a nigga pumped
My partners mamas smokin rocks and turns into a ho
And since they fuck with that right nigga the gat will snort and blow
Killas move in silence and the jokers run they mouth
Fightin fools that don't exist take that nigga out
Cause his love is murder, two jack burgers takin your respect
Coke and dank sex then baked your homies in the set
So flash yo cash and whoop your ass if you've got more than me
And whatever you got is more than mine so nigga let me see
Cause jealousy's reality when it comes to niggas bread
And snitches go from rags to riches rattin' to the feds
Cause coke is queen and money is king and niggas want the crown
So all you niggas goin up you fuckers goin down
The situations critical with stories on the streets
Kill em dead and get yo bread but make sure that you eat
But I ain't done yet
The situations critical
[Nickatina]
My baby's momas trippin, got my son and I can't keep him
Wanna cry to hear him on the phone, but she won't let me see him
This chewy got me paranoid and goin kinda scared
Niggas startin to know my face so I had to cut my hair
Cause nigga, shit is gettin thick from here to Alabama
Cause every nigga's tryin ta like Tony ""Face"" Montana
Some niggas talk about they'll kill, but nigga no you won't
Some niggas that dream of playin hoop but end up sellin dope
Cause 3, 6, 5 like everyday man dolja takes it toll
And motherfuckas live to be a G Original
Cause kill groups, its keys the juke, and rubber band they G's
Money shows this ain't no joke, well bow down to your knees
Situation critical, fuck a 9 to 5
Chewy got these niggas amped and they ain't scared to die
So miss me with that bullshit and hit me with that bank
Miss me with that bammer bitch and rush me with that dank
Time is runnin out partna, time ain't runnin in
My freedom is the only life, so fuck the fuckin pen
So as I chew my juicy fruit and think about the dead
And all my niggas that had died because they had some bread
My mind is on another level nigga this is typical
Check my eyes I'm dyin inside, situations critical
Situations critical

[Nickatina]
Niggas dressin rich, knowin they broke without a doubt
Born and raised in the same hood in a roach infested house
Situation critical I think I'm bout to die
The enemy is creepin up and fuckin off my high
A nigga hit the 5th and makes it home in desperation
Wipe the sweat, hold my chest, and then I plot retaliation
Now before you clown you best calm down cause I read you like a book
Now must you stare cause I don't care, cause I won't even look
Thangs ain't what they used to be a motherfucka told ya
Niggas got the mind to kill and that includes the rollers
Cause 2, 4, 7 like everyday niggas servin cluckers
Beatin up the bustas, fuckin Tommy Tuckers
Some niggas say they gangstas and they love when money folds
But mosta the time these niggas be beefin over hoes
Cause pussy comes a savage beast and it also makes you broke
Especially when that sexy freak is snortin all your coke
So check my situation fool and check my state of mind
No matter how you makin paper nigga, thats a grind
My indo have an increase this week from eighth up to a half
And nothin funny motherfucka, nigga why you laugh?
So fuck this fame and fuck these records, motherfuck these raps
My mother's broke there ain't no hope, her son ain't got no snaps
Its the same old song I'm doin wrong, fool this is typical
Fuck the fuckin world mama, situations critical

Scar Gardens,Grieves,"['alternative', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","(Verse 1)

Lay another one to rest in the valley of my shadows opened up
Bury all my expectations for a semi-normal love
And with it burning in my palms, massaging into my blood
I try to fight away my urges ""It's only gonna rope you up girl.""
Hear me, I know my capabilities of breaking
In the only thing that saves you from the feelings of trust
Believe the angel on your shoulder when she comes
Cause your devil's so familiar, and mine will leave you flustered like...
You count your tears like experience
And me? Just another sunken dream trying to deal with it
Calmly, reacting to every situation since you called me
Head dug into my palms thinking she don't honestly want this
And it's obvious yeah the sorrow sets it off
Hypnotizing both of us into agreeing with the odds
But in the dark I got a chance to fight it off
Instead I sleep with the chaos that will wander down the same Path that I chose to walk on

(Chorus)
She said it took her all her life
She’s steady looking at me like
She caught a glimpse of something
""I am not your paradise, girl""
And with it in me
Its better to save your wishes
For the moment after sailing away
She said it took her all her life
She’s steady looking at me like
She caught a glimpse of something
""I am not your paradise, girl""
And with it in me
Its better to save your wishes
For the moment after sailing away
""I should have never even shown you""

(Verse 2)

What it’s like inside the world I keep a lock on
Purple-hearted scar garden harvesting my thoughts song
And with the chalk gone, the problem still exists
At least the outline of its death prevents another fatal kiss
But that's impossible neither one of us opted to be positive
Stared each other in the face, and screamed until we lost it
And the fire magnetically pulled both of us right on top of it
Until one of us surrendered to rejection of the opposite
And this is not a love song, I’m working out my problems
The love songs what caused them, now i’m stuck and trying to solve them
And its all forever tarnished From beginning to the end
You use my smile as an ashtray and inhale its ending scent
Let it go, please let it go this will kill you
Reinventing us is not a miracle we still do and
Just as certain as I speak it to you now
I know I’ll wake up on the left side on the other side of town
Listen!..

(Chorus)

(Bridge)

""I am not your paradise, Girl""
""You should have never even asked""
""I am not your paradise, Girl""
""I should have never even showed you""

Baby, I can't make this right now... (4x)

[Verse 2]
I ain't know the police was the Babylon
I ain't know I'm cold just like an avalanche
I never knew my titties was bigger than Pamela
So paparazzi flicking, be flicking their camera
I just know that I be on my fly girl shit
My fly girl stomach and my fly girl hips
I fly girl ball, with my fly girl mitts
And I can only kiss another fly girl lips

[Pre-Chorus]
Now get that OJ, get that, get that OJ
A little cranberry and some Rémy Moné
Now everybody look my way, my way
Excuse all the haters cause they looking sideways
Let's get it now, c'yeah

You got me wrong
You be sittin' by the bar when it's your song
You can act like you don't like it, but you do
You do, you do, do, do, do, do

I think I'm gonna kill the motherfuckin' DJ
If he don't pull up let the record replay

Oh, fuck 'em like sexin', why they be flexing

You got me wrong (Kill the motherfuckin' DJ)

You can act like you don't like it but you do (Pull up, let the record replay)
You do, you do, do, do, do, do  (Pull up, let the record replay)"
Where Do I Go,Lupe Fiasco,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
And somebody tell me, where do I go from now (x4)

[Intro]
I've been lost, you know?
Oh, you know? I didn't know... didn't know at all

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
I just wanted to use computers
I made it to the finish line first, but Lu's a loser
I wanted to watch so I turned to rocks
Like Medusa, the block, the users
The rock, the shooters, the shots, the heckle of cops
The lugers, the Glocks, the cougars
Should be with my Akhs, making Salat in the Ummah
But instead I'm on the block in this lot with the Kufi's
And I'm feeling like a doofus, I think I understand the meaning of life
And really ain't no reason for ice, still want it
Still haunted by the demon, a price
But if u give it to me we'll flaunt it
I think niggas is dead broke, and I can bring em to life, its funny how--
Naw it really ain't funny sometimes I hate money
Please God take from me
[Hook]

All my blessings, I take em as a lesson
Make 'em into questions, and relate 'em to the present
Should I take it as a present? A penalty?
But everything's from the man upstairs
Could barely sing cuz the man upstairs is beating on the floor
When the music stops will I have a chair?
Will I be seated on the floor
It really don't matter cat beat me to the score
I was speaking to this whore
You know I got trouble with women humble beginnings
Mumblin and tremblin now they smugglin and stealing
Step ya game up check the dame what?
I nutted on her fangs ain't nuthin to hang up
That really happened in fact but I ain't manufactured for that
A bumpy ride had to fasten my straps
I be tryna reach em, other niggas be lyin:
Dyin' to get behind and beat 'em
I just be tryna teach 'em

[Hook]

I put it on paper, cuz they'll put you on for paper
But most of these niggas is paper
10 1/2 by 8 blue lines 3 holes
Hit they ass wit 8's, flat lined, 3 holes
Cuz they'll gas u up like cold pacer
And leave u in the cold without a coat with a cold
Thats not gangsta them niggas ain't ya boys man
Them niggas is the poison gotta keep em under the sink
Right next to the bleach I say that I'm on top of my game
Cuz if you under you sink
I wonder if its just the hunger you think? imagine that til it haunts you
Them niggas want you to fall, I fall cuz I want to
Yellow leaves and felonies that's how I fell on these
God made my head with mind in it
They made my bread with swine in it
Made my bed and now im lyin in it
I wonder if this is my limit

Hey yo, what's up, man?
Hey yo, you been here all day, man
Y'all been here every weekend, man
I don't ever get a chance to rap first, man!
That's 'cause you wack!
What?!? I ain't wack, nigga, I got some raps for all y'all
Nigga, my raps fresh, I'ma bust my raps first
You can bust yours after me if you want to
No, no, man, I'm goin' first
I'm gettin' tired of everybody wantin' to go first, man
You always rap first, I'm rappin'
I don't care what none of y'all say; I'm fresh, I'm fresh

Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out, man, I wanna know!
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?

Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
""I wanna know, wanna know""
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'll have you taken back to Christ when you're sacrificed
The way you're hacked and sliced
When I fill your back with knives
Jackin' life's of MC's, now I'm set to launch a plan
For blowin' up the stage with illegal contraband
I stomped your man, so unless you want what he got
You better set the mic down, I'm steamin' like a teapot
I make the D hot, people get in my face and ask
If I wanna battle, then I chase them in a Jason mask
It's an amazin' task to battle with success
I never gave a fuck, now I give a fuck less
And win a slug fest, I get physical like physicians
Invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
Wicked wizardry like a sorcerer, no remorse for ya
When I torture ya throughout the course of my orchestra
So feel the force of my spiritual images
Slicin' up an enemy's appendages 'til he hemorrhages
My skin itches every time a rapper recites
And when he's through with his verse, I'm all covered in flea bites
You wanna see fights, I got a match for ya
You couldn't flip shit playin' in toilets with a spatula

[Hook: Thyme]
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out, man, I wanna know!
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?

Point him out, bitch, I wanna know!
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
""I wanna know, wanna know""
[Verse 2: Eminem]
You bitches get a hysterectomy disrespectin' me
You wanna feel the full effect of me, hand a TEC to me
Intellectually superior, I'll make the whack wearier
Inferior deteriorate like bacteria
Materially, killin' serially, clearly you'll see
How much in fear when you hear me you'll be
Shiver and shake, quiver and quake
Bite a rhyme and feel your jaw get stiffer and ache
Wither and break, you slitherin' snake
Gibberin' fake, fibber and flake
I'll twist you in a different shape
And toss you in Michigan Lake for fisherman's sake
If this is a dream, you wish you can wake every diss you can take
Personal, we ain't friends tryin' to make amends
If you ain't ever stole a gate, you can take offense
I make intense masterpieces
And smash to pieces your last releases
You pass diseases, that's the reason
I'm showin' you the proper way to
Operate a mic, so pass it like a hot potato
I've never been less than clever and fresh
Severin' flesh of fools who never impressed ever infest

Try Harder,Drake,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Drake]
Sometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough
To feel what I'm about to say in this song
When they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself
And you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
That there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping
And they try to make you out as a lie
It's ironic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason
It's a lose lose why even try
When your ideas so frequently get rejected
People just get neglected
And they never really know how to feel
Phone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics
And the motives to try and make them a mill
You never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and
They just wanna say that you ain't around
I mean there's always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming
That you couldn't help and maybe next time you ain't in town

Chorus: (x4)
You gonna try to try harder cuz
Try harder cuz
Try Try-Try-Try
[Verse 2: Drake]
And the managers make you succumb to pressure and if what you spittin' is fresher
Than most of these rappers running the game
Certain people will copy what's in the past to turn the profit with cash
There's time I would have done it the same
I mean I got me a Range
Also got me a guilty conscience
That made you tell anybody I meet that I rent
Sometimes I wish that I would just chilled on the sneakers
And watched the game from the bleachers
Because I'm really tend to need what I spent
In a house that I promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time
I wasted out late at the club
Instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner I'm working hard on the winter
So this album is a labor of love
You say as long as I'm staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats
That she can rest without a toss and a turn
Because she know that my reputation precedes me and people watch me on TV
That's exactly why I often get burned
But I'm gonna try to..

Chorus: (x4)"
Maxine,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Eminem & Mr. Porter]

[Intro: Maxine & Denuan Porter]
Maxine!
Hello
Can I speak to Maxine?
Yeah, this is me, what's up?
What up?
Who dis?
Denaun
Yeah, what's up?
What are you doing?
Nothing, just laying in bed
Huh?
Nothing, just laying in bed
Why?
I don't know, thinking about something freaky to do

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I know this crack fiend Maxine who needs a vaccine
She tests positive but tells you that her act's clean
Plus she got a sugar daddy
Gassin' every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
If you mistook her, sadly, on her reputation
You're in jeopardation, if you ain't got no preparation
When you stepped away, son, she got her face done
Lookin' provocative, she'll let you knock it if
You press the issue, and get undressed to kiss you
If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice
But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency
To go to the emergency 'cause it burns to pee
Don't bring your germs to me, 'cause I ain't tryna hear it
While you're fightin' your fuckin' disease tryna clear it
[Verse 2: Kon Artis]
Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose in life?
That is to get with every brother
And unveil one of his kids
Shit, you livin' trife
Got three kids at home, and club-hoppin' every night
You say it's gonna stop
But it just… slows… down…
And then speeds back to a regular pace
There is no end to this
Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be
You say you wanna be with me, but how can you say that
When you got niggas hidin' in your closet?
I refrain from gettin' angry
But you keep on actin' strangely

[Verse 3: 3]
I met this girl last week
She was a freak, and she liked me
So I stepped on it and then asked my homies
And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas
Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number
I stepped to her, first I cleared my throat
And said: ""Hey, bitch, haven't I seen you before?""
Looked at my nigga, turned around and got slapped
Throughout my hands, and said: ""Oh, it's like that?""
She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit
She started cryin', and asked me to forgive her and shit
She said her name was Maxine
So I told her I wanted her number
She asked could I give her mine too
Got to the crib and called her up
We got into a good conversation
That's when she asked me could I fuck
I said: ""Maxine, check this out
Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out""
Got to the crib, she let me in
She didn't waste time, she grabbed my hand
And proceeded to the bedroom
I said ""Hold up, and stop proceedin', you rushin' things""
What the fuck are you doin'?
So I went for my protection
Took off my clothes and started flexin'
As she went for my midsection
I threw her down as I tore off her shirt
Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about puttin' in work
Before I hit it she said: ""3, don't get mad
But there's somethin' that I gotta tell your ass""
I said ""What is it? Another nigga? It's okay""
She said: ""No I forgot to tell you
That I got AIDS, I got a problem.""
[Outro: Maxine & Denaun Porter]
Hey, Maxine
What?
You thinkin' about suckin' my dick?
Yeah, for a small price
For a small price? What you mean?
You know, money, nigga
You don't need no damn money; I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit
What you, what you hear I got?
AIDS
Who told you that bullshit?
My nigga Kyu, he wouldn't lie
Well, if that's the case, Kyu got it then
Oh for real, it's like that?
Well, I ain't got shit, so he ain't got shit
And if he do, he ain't get that shit from me
I ain't fuckin' around with no third, nigga
Fuck that, I ain't fuckin' with you
No, see…
You got that shit, I ain't gotta fuck with you
Hold on, why it ain't even like that
I want y'all to get paid, fuckin'"

Love's lost, love's gone
Love lost, love is gone
Love's lost, love's gone
Love lost, love is gone

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look
In this world of desperate housewives and freakin players
Rappers they tend to be smilin'
Because they swimmin' in women
Most of em seeking favors
They come in secret flavors
That's why I envy Omar
Because so far I'm nowhere close to Malik and Deja
And that's some higher learning
Trying to excel with the brake on
I'll have you stuck in the same spot with the tires burnin'
And I'm a liar turnin' 19, jaded with no faith
In any female that's askin what I was earnin
I met this recent lady
She knew a piece of Sadie by Spinners
I guess in my southern eyes that she decent maybe
Well second thought if we have it then she can keep the baby
Cause she ain't give me the butterflies that Aleshia gave me
It's like I'm using some bread to sop up some decent gravy
Now I'm out of both and I've been thinkin' of Alisha lately
[Refrain: Drake]
I'm all alone, I got a feelin it's on
Cause nowadays most of the thrill of chillin' is gone and uh

[Chorus: Voyce]
Love's lost, love's gone
Love lost, love is gone

[Verse 2: Drake]
Some dudes they turn purple with hurt faces, circling workplaces
And following girls on the assumptions of what the worst case is
They get to first bases
Then they get to retreating cause if she cheatin'
He wanna know what the first trace is
Now you like MacGyver, cause you sneakin' around
And she don't know that you there when you standin' right beside her
I can relate to that
I had to take it back a couple of years
When some of the best kicked it with Drake in fact
I bet that they knew it cause in my mind I play through it with
And in the end I listen but I don't see me as they do
Cause it's my opinion, my life, my potentials for my wife
And I used to be eager to buy em the world
Maybe I'm confused about what I desire from girls

[Refrain: Drake]
Either way I'm all alone, got a feelin' it's on
Cause nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin' is gone and uh
[Chorus: Voyce]
Love's lost, love's gone
Love lost, love is gone

[Verse 3: Drake]
Check
And nowadays, some girls are the type of person that
Will tell they friends that they use him which is confusing
Since I ain't made them a purchase yet
But there's logic behind it
Emotions double and they try to cover up
Like a mansion with the projects behind it
I tend to freak with this
I get a girl and pretend that I love the spending
And all she gave was a decent kiss
Thinking she been spoiled
But golddiggin' is nothing when you can shovel for days
And come up with tin foil
We could dissect it, see
You take a Dominique or another freak in the sheets
And you picture that she just slept with me for nothing
Gave her nothing, ger reputation's in jeopardy
Cause it ain't take a spree of that shopping to get her next to me
Collectively I look for a proper chick that'll rep for me
Instead of seeing something she wants and calling and texting me
[Refrain: Drake]
For thinking that exists, I got a feeling I'm wrong
Nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh

Uh, I'm bringing back hip hop
Me and my nigga Drake
VA, Toronto, Hip-Hop

Aiight let me take my jacket off
Unlace the Timbs, here again comes the jabberjaw
This time I'm blabbing on
These rappers that feel a certain way but they give me dap and all
Mad cuz the freestyle iller than they whole catalog
I got the gift like Santa Claus
Flow got spring like a catapult
Matter fact the flow Supreme like Diana Ross
I'm at the do' like a deer with the antlers off
Niggas acting like Scummy was they nigga
Wouldn't even give my man a 12 bar feature
I know who you are cause he wanted me to eat ya
I said nah lets keep it peaceful
My nigga was a true weed source
He gave it to us for a cheap cost, at prices we all could eat off
A real street dog
The type of nigga that y'all niggas be studying learning how to get street off
We have an impostor, alert the doctor
Bout to hit him up with the chopper like Blaka
Shock em like Blanka from Street Fighter, heat got a
Hurricane kick, murder everything quick
Look, my new Ryu nine is stupendous
Why do guys choose my crew to pick wit
My crew lie you guys into ditches
I said it and meant it the Scorpio's Mind has many dimensions

The Scorpio's Mind is not a game to play wit all day
[Verse 2: Drake]
I've been hated by many, wanted by plenty
Disliked by some, but confronted by none
Since they don't show me sincerity, I load up, lock up
Take shots at em I guess you could call it a parody
And compared to D
They one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon, dude you a pear to me
If that's not how it is it's how it appear to be
You got blind heaters, in my sweats is a mind reader
And when the psychic get to touching my palm
Seein' your physical, the things that you never say to me visible
Especially when one of your artists feeling threatened
Cause I'm harnessing a weapon, won't you pardon my reflection
Mirror, mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage
And play around, to perfection I'm the spitting image
My verbal camp is vivid, I told you I'm spitting image
It seems we often want to start but never get to finish
My verbal campus is Villanova, and those of you feelin Hova
And writing college rhymes, look the thrill is over
Let me assist you like a specialist
So you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this
It's not a problem wit X, I guess I'm a pessimist
Which means if shit goes bad I say, ""I expected this""
And me and Julien we never got the chance to communicate
Instead of understanding its a tune of hate
The city's mine like Oklahoma's a Sooner state
And we're gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
So, why don't you walk up in the spot using less strut
You ain't Morris Chestnut, you lighter and less cut
And lets be honest, by now you should be your own scholar
You still a protegé, that's the reason I don't holler
You got rappers being repetitive actors

The Revolution Rocks On,Public Enemy,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chuck D]
All my people...

[Hook]
Do you know what it means to have a revolution?
And what it takes to make a solution?
Still fighting against oppression
We're battling our depression

[Society]
Now we was raised in these streets on pork and poison meat
Now I recognize the beast, bare the mark of the gold teeth
Puff on the rolled leaf and bust on these police
While y'all playas are fakin bacon we cook the whole beef
I put it down plain, I stimulate that left and right brain, baby
Cell by cell and frame by frame
Names, dates, it's all immaterial:
We big dicks sick rhyme killer like cereal
I burn like venereal
Spit that imperial wizardry that climbs right through the circuitry
Choke your team for they cream, but that's as far as we go
Drop shit like seagulls and smash your little ego
I get visions like Stevie and Coleco
Give me 2000 live people
One late show and no sequel
Ain't no equal in the flesh
I been through more evil than men do
Nasty off the head and with the pen too!
[Chuck D]
Now I'm pissed
Easy to rhyme on tracks like this
The more things change
The more they remain the same
These games, them vidiots
Playin on the brink of insane
Must be a hockey rink
Lost up in they drink
In pursuit of plain Jane, I think man
They think a revolution be pretty in pink, man
Now in these new tracks
Some of these cats don't know how to act
All them criminal acts ain't got nothin to do with rap;
One hand cuffed behind them backs in black
Quiet Riot, y'all can't hear one hand clap
Revolution is more than what you hear and what you see:
The mass reintroduction of society to society
Together we got 100 years of sobriety
These clones who be flippin like new phones be surprisin me
Turned out, they just happy to be in the house
So I call em out; you know I ain't no church mouse!
Love out
The revolution rocks on, the revolution rocks on

[Griff]
I master rap
Write a 16 and half of that
Then eat some mixed greens after that
My rap's niggerish black like licorish
While wack rappers gettin rich off some jibberish
The hood's begging for deliverance G
I'm just a hood figure to deliver this
L Y should get into the ""Sy,""
I'm thinking me and P.E. should have passed it on
Society's the menace
He's got more love than tennis
On the road to riches
Cause revolution's expensive
Finance whips, finance clips
Spread our chips in the ghetto
Raising rebels with some fine ass tits
No champagne campaign, no ice on my wrist
While bred's dipp'n on feds, sipp'n on Criss
Out of my mind Ethiopian wine on my lips
Still ain't signed, the master mind
The master's mine. Hey!

He walk around town with a frown like Homey the Clown
Shelltoe Lee crown, well blow me down
Blow! Hell no, he sound funny
Outta bounds tryin'ta cop a pound with brown money
Keep the change, peep game, the Range
Inches on the fringes of a deep steepa' strange
Went and met a dread at the swine roast
Find him in the zone up ahead near the sign post
Follow the beat, you won't stumble
Shut your mouth, swallow your feet, or try'an rumble
In discreet they lie and mumble
Catch 'em in the street they as humble as Bryant Gumble cryin' fumble
Don't let him get the call
Keep a stack a diss rhymes, one-size-fits-all
Try ta' avoid the pitfall
Or else get hit in the eye with a old dry spitball
You must be crazy out ya mind
Even on the days he feel lazy he shout rhymes
No chains, no bridge, just get outshined
When he come blaze it people say it's about time
The old God with the old gold gold card
When he's on the road it's no-holds-barred
No lard, in the record game on some bull guard
So many nekked dames he might blow his whole wad
Ya learn somethin' new everyday
Go ahead and burn, they ain't nothin' to do anyway
'cept sell tracks out the Cheverolet like lemonade
And go gold in the hood so he can get ghetto paid
Now that's usin' the ol' cranium
Like the jewelry cat who sold him fake plat uranium
Guaranteed to turn necks green like the Hulk
Have it manufactured by machine in bulk
They rock 'n roll like: 'Stop, Drop . . .'
And if they got soul, then welcome to the sock hop
Hip-be-bop at ya block mom 'n pop shop
Timing when it comes to rhymin' is chop-chop
Keep it lit till the last stroke'a the pen
And ya don't quit like ya quit smokin' again
They said he keep his lyrics poked in a tin
And his secret recipe, soak it in some gin
Brings the heat like a radiator
Stays on beat with the mask like a gladiator
Sword is the mic cord
And he came to turn it out like a dyke broad out the psych ward
I recollect when he first took the sector
He use the connect-the-dot styles as a mic checka
Told him give the deposit, book the lecture
The crooked look wrecka, HOOKS IS EXTRA!!!"

Baby girl 5'6""
Fine, thick
She had to be like a size 5 or 6
I met her at the mall right in front of footlocker
My nigga bet me 20 I couldn't get her so I
Walked in like I was about to buy something
And got to looking around like I couldn't find nothing
She walked back in got to looking at her ass
Then I asked if she had these in 11 and a half
She was like ""ooh baby I don't work here""
Then I put the shoe back and I said I knew that
She smiled and got to walkin to the door
But I couldn't let her go so I walked te door too
Then I said ""come on my niggas lets go
Pretty girls ain't giving out their number's no more""
Then I turned around looked at her and she laughed again
Tapped me on the shoulder
And she asked if I had a pen
I said ""yea theres one in back a my trio""
She pulled out her razor I said
""I'll trade ya!""
Her screen saver said ""niggas ain't shit""
Thats funny because mine said ""money over a bitch""
I said ""I'll call ya""
She said ""You better""
Collected $20 from my nigga
Then later on got her on the phone like ""wait til gettcha""
She like ""what makes you so special?""
[Hook]
I know where that spot at girl...
[ 4x]

I be having a moment and she be like don't wake the kids don't wake the kids

[Verse 2: Chip Tha Ripper]
We was on the phone until the early morn
I was just trying to see what this girly on
I said ""I'm digging you"" and she was digging me too
Baby look familler think I saw her at the view
I was like girl you should be my boo
She was like ""ohh daddy can I come through?""
I was like ""cool"" then I told her where I live
She said she be over by 1O and its 9:45
So that don't really leave me much time to clean up the crib n chill a bottle a wine
Then she rang and I buzzed her in told her come to apartment 210
Magnum on deck for when its time to suite up lit up the booty and does it defiantly do up
Put a movie in but she really didn't care
She looking at me and I'm looking at her
She touching on me and I'm touching on her
Then she started kissing hair
""girl, you betta quit that shit before you fuck around and get that shit""
She was like ""nigga please""
""I ain't met a nigga who can satisfy me and honestly I don't think you can hang with me""
""I'm gonna need 2 hours, baby, mabye even 3!""
I said ""Baby, time is of the essence you need someone to deliver a package and not a message""
""And I'm the UPS man, I go the extra mile""
""I delever with a smile, been delivering for a while""
So be cool because I know what I'm doing
Panties and bra is what I want to see you in
Then we can just minus the panties and bra
Massage your thighs and just add this cannon with balls
And any other problems I can solve em
Even if you just need a massage I got you
We can take it real slow at the beginning
Keep them coochie lips a grinning when I hit it from behind
Then pop goes the weasel
Because the weasel goes pop all over your head, shoulders, knees and toes
But I bet you I don't even get to finish
I'mma have you tapping out in 30 minutes
Because I know where that spot at girl!"

I tell 'em that envy’s a dangerous emotion, they hoping I'm blowing
Like they helped me get to places I've been going
Got a chip up on my shoulder, I'm holding all of them accountable
When you at the bottom, ain't nobody hanging round but you
It's a croc, they say they give you a lot
But then they gon' get it twisted they sipping on they Siroc
But if Diddy did to Biggie what Diddy did to the Lox
When Diddy was sitting pretty while Biggie was in a box
Boy, y'all fronting, you stupid and y'all stunting
You fuckers ain't killing nothing, you're broke and funerals cost money
Jaws running, I love it when I get mentioned
I'm an asshole, stupid, I love it when there's tension
I thrive in it, she begged me to let it drive her

I'm borrowing and returning tomorrow then
I be switching 'em like they politicians in Parliament
Tripping until they twitching, they sipping and swallow gin
But I keep a pussy wet enough to drown my sorrows in
I'm followed by that black cloud so long
That I took the silver lining and pawned it, now I'm off it
It wasn't long ago they were acting like they beyond it
Now they sleeping on you but all they favors exhausted
I lost women a lot of you would have paid to met
Fighting when we fucking and I touch 'em, it's make up sex
Ain't no breaking bread, I ain't leaving crumbs
That's if you hungry and numb, then I ain't giving a fuck, c'mon

You’ll tell me stories
I’ll show you pictures
You’ll be beside me
When we return to gold
You know I’m sorry
I’ll have forgiveness
You’ll be my only
When we return to gold

[Verse 1: Sene]
Uh, but until I’m back again
And all you snobs like rap again
I’ll go find folks more passionate
Before I ever put my whole or my half in it
Uh!
I’m on my way into the press box
And you trying to cop yourself an Xbox
I’m taking off my guest(?) , it’s so strange
Lift like my thought process, see how lost I get
They say that he’s bipolar
And he buys nothing except for roll-ups
He buys something for his chums to smoke
Same time tell ‘em, “watch for the undertow, bruh”
This game’s got kings and cobras
Act same way like pimps and hoes does
So the Jakes wanna catch and hold us
Say, is that a rapper or the wrestler Gold Dust?
We got chains, but don’t got masters
School of hard knocks, don’t got classes
Street shit, beat shit, tested, passed it
Came from dust and returned to ashes
[Chorus]

[Bridge: Sene]
No, don’t nobody stay gold
No, everybody gotta grow
And you can see their cracks, and you can see their faults
When they unfold
I said, no!
Don’t nobody stay gold
No, everybody gotta grow
And you can see their cracks, and you can see their faults
When they unfold

[Verse 2: Sene]
You can’t take nothing for granted
I work for mind, you understand it?
I know folks who don’t work
They’re jerks, they bitch and moan, sit at home and demand things
They just want a rich spouse to marry it
Not do shit like Rob Kardashian
Got a whole team just to help with management
They don’t even really know what they’re managing
But go ahead bring the cameras in
Send the flicks in, we’ll examine ‘em
We don’t wanna show our bad sides
And fans still think we’re perfect as it is
And that’s that shit that makes it hazardous
Little girls getting their tits fixed as a diss (?)
Now I think about that air-brushing
That you do to fix your stomach in all them ads you in
Giving you abs again
And they ain’t even full-grown, but theirs gotta look like yours though
And you do it reverse for getting old
That ain’t how you stay gold

Analyzing my anthologies
Can't harm me, why pop at me

Why box with me, harder to hit than a lottery
Why bother me, kill cats like curiosity

It's just another murder, nobody mourns no more
My tear drops gettin' bigger
But can't figure what I'm cryin' for
Is it the miniature caskets, little babies?
Victims of a stray, from drug dealers gone crazy?
Maybe it's just the drugs, visions of how the block was
Crack came and it was strange how it rocked us
Perhaps the underlyin' fact, stay high, explain genocide
It's when we ride on our own kind
What is it we all fear? Reflections in the mirror
We can't escape fate, the end is gettin' nearer
[Hook: 2Pac]
Who do you believe in?
I put my faith in God
Blessed and still breathin'
And even though it's hard
That's who I believe in
Before I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin'
Who do you believe in?

I put my faith in God
Blessed and still breathin'
And even though it's hard
That's who I believe in
Before I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin'

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Can't close my eyes, ‘cause all I see is terror
I hate the man in the mirror
‘Cause his reflection makes the pain turn realer
Times of Armageddon, murder in mass amounts
In this society where only gettin' the cash counts
I started out as a beginner
Entered the criminal lifestyle, became a sinner
I make my money, and vacate, evade prison
Went from the chosen one to an outcast, unforgivin'
And all the Hennessy and weed can't hide the pain I feel inside
You know, it's like I'm livin' just to die
I fall on my knees and beg for mercy
Not knowin' if I'm worthy
Livin' life thinkin' no man can hurt me
So I'm askin', before I lay me down to sleep
Before you judge me
Look at all the shit you did to me; my misery
I rose up from the slums, made it out the flames
In my search for fame, will I change?
I'm askin'…
[Hook: 2Pac]

[Verse 3: Yaki Kadafi]
Faith in Allah, believe in me and this plastic
‘Cause so far I done witnessed too many dead niggas in caskets
With they chest plates stretched, like elastic
And what's worse I'm on front line
Holdin' down camp, still mashin'
Heard my cousin, one of the old heads from the block
Just came home October of '95, back in Yardsville stuck
With a three to five, if he don't act up
Now he realize, if you don't stay wise
Then in this game you fucked
Talk to my baby girl, give me the word on what she heard
One of the grimies is snitchin', dimin', a stool pigeon
I talked to him; he said he didn't, my man said he did
In fact he's sure, ‘cause he just came home off of bid

Now tell me, who do you believe in?

[Collision]
Who do you believe in?
Is it Buddah, Jehovah, or Jah? Or Allah?
Is it Jesus? Is it God? Or is it just yourself?
Definitely not to be imposed, being a demon
Because this is the joy of believin'
Man, to believe in yourselves
But for sure, the higher power
Resides only to ride in the heart of the true
From the soul, of the man; for truth never has an alibi
In the poetry, or in it's realm
That's what pulls all words together
Just to understand that every man is his own man
And only man can satisfy the man
Only the soul of the man, the feelings of the man
The for realness of the man
You can't shake the man when you give the man
You know the man
And you gotta call yourself, because you are that man

(Yeah!)
Shut the fuck up!

[Verse 1]
The way she listen to what the MC said
She might as well plug the RCA cords into her head
Taking that into consideration at the center of creation
Cats still criticize my frustration raps
Well off he goes, coming cop some flows
Cross your toes and hopes that I don't climb you like an obstacle
Mission impossible, fishing in the kitchen sink
Y'all fall for anything so what you think this kid will bring
Poker face, let me hold my place
The name-sake is Slug, but you, you can call me stoker ace
Open invitation to catch today's ejaculation all across the front
Of your pretty little apron
This goes to those that own a mouth full of Sean's load
Thanks for starting, now you're barking down the wrong road
Sacrifice plays a part in grabbing mics
From now to the afterlife, I'll continue passion-like
I love this fucking whore with all my heart
And ain't nobody gonna stop me from doing my part
It gave me life, it saved me life, it raised me right
So slide, shoulder slide, and please hand over that mic
[Chorus]
Who am I? One of a kind, send em' one at a time
You're all the same only separate by kick snares and names
And some of y'all even share the same names
So fuck you and your lies baby, show no shame
What is this? One of a kind, send em' one at a time
You're all the same only separate by kick snares and names
And some of y'all even share the same names
So fuck you and your lies baby, show no shame

[Verse 2]
So point a finger at the sucker that's having a good summer
Ain't got no bread, no wheat, no wonder
But I got the phone number to this weakness
I know who can put me back together, make me feel whole
So take me apart, try to break me down
Spend all you got just to hate the clown
You can fake the frown, imitate the sound
Underworld, world-wide, wide world of underground
It goes, one little, two little, three little indie rap
Headphones, backpacks watch 'em all piggyback
Switch up my styles, they all complain
But see which kids next year sound the same as me?
The same shit yesterday was like today
Only difference is I trust even less of what you say
But all in all I still make the noise, I still break the toys, I still hate your voice
I still say fuck a major label 'til it limps
Put your deal up our table and we'll show you who's the pimp
There is no sympathy for the careless
Fuck the extra credit and fuck the demerits
Class dismissed
[Interlude]
Pain
Pain
Pain
You're all the same

[Chorus]
Who am I? One of a kind, send em' one at a time
You're all the same only separate by kick snares and names

So fuck you and your lies baby, show no shame
What is this? One of a kind, send em' one at a time
You're all the same only separate by kick snares and names

Some might get it and some might not
We don't really care, we just do what we want
It's like that, it's like that, I don't care
Some might get it and some might not
We don't really care, we just do what we want
It's like that, it's like that, I don't care

[Verse 1: Outasight]
Some think a picture tells a 1000 words
But a jpeg of mine shouldn’t get y’all concerned
Don’t judge a book by its cover is cliché
So take a look and hate, it’s really that easy
And I won’t be all serious like I’m Enrique
And I don’t get caught up in the he say, she say
So say what you want and tell me how you feel
It won't change much but I only hope it’s real, what goes around comes around
I'm sure you heard the schpeel of climbing to the top
So if I get the over the hill, I got no one to blame except myself and my will
I got no one to claim if I ever write my will, ill but better not yet contagious
Heard the whole book but never skimmed through the pages
Judged on looks, well it really doesn't phase us
Tapping on my watch like damn, what’s the wait up?
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Outasight]
And I’m trying to make a difference for what it's worth
And I swear for a minute that I thought I was cursed
Every step forward meant another few back
End up at some dive bar just to knock a few back
And my friends kept asking can we have you back?
I took another shot without pouring you jack
Doubted from the get go, maybe I should let go of all my hopes
Sell insurance like the gecko, heck no, I bet those thoughts don't bounce
Till my bank account has an amount that don’t bounce
Anytime I try and go out, I don't count, I don't really care, no way, no how
And as for the future? No way to know now
So loans and electric, cable and the rent is on the back of my mind
Till further notice and mentions, I learned a lesson

To try it, it would be stupid, your choice of technique is foolish
Battle be strong the new kid
Don’t matter my scars were leaking
I’ll be standing still demanding, I’ll be winner

The fat is in the fire, a fryer made of chicken wire
Gettin' sick and tired of a friggin' liar
Pelican, with some very soft mangos
A closet full of skeletons and terry cloth Kangols
Flew the coop, before you hit it, let me warn you
She did a cool hula-hoop but don't get any on you
It's all a big scam to make y'all eat pig ham
When he's on the mic he's like the triggerman, FIGJAM
DOOM, not to be confused with nobody
Especially, since the flows he used was so nutty
Never too woozy to go study
Crews got no clues like old cruddy Officer McGillicuddy
Watch your six, he got a lot of more tricks
Lyrics, bricks, on sticks sure got raw-nytics
It's a gift, don't get shot for kicks
With the same slick used to plot sick vics with
Spotted at a chick flick, holdin' hands
The other one on his swollen glans, a golden chance
That's why he kept them holes in his pants
Rollin' in a old van, is what he told his stolen fans
Is that you? True, matched from hat to shoe
Snafu, snatch any brew, LaBatt's Blue
Black Jew like that's new, patch me through
No latch attached, skat shoo, catch twenty-two
Super, he's loaded dice nice
And overpriced, an arm and a leg; owe 'em your life or your ice
Villain, nag a grieving old hag
Snag a bragger by his mic cord and leave him holding the bag
Come clean, a bunch of dumb mean cream puffs
A keen drum machine buff, who fiends for more green stuff
Instead of starvin' there be problems by the goo gobs
Aight, somebody's robbin' Lou Dobbs and them tonight
And he's on the next flight, moon bound
And makes it a point to stay away from the goon pound
Got some peers that's gone in the lost years
Tears and cheers, born in the crosshairs

Heather Nicole,Hopsin,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
At night in my window I see your silhouette
Crying heavy tears, look how wet my pillow gets
Throughout my days I don't smile I just get upset
And since you left look at all the shit that it affects
I take a picture of your face and I just hold it up
Kiss it, then reminisce on when it was both of us
It's hard for me to open up, I'm always talking to myself
But to nobody else
Some say that church or maybe counseling could probably help
But they don't know about all of my idiotic lies
All the fucking times I left you traumatized
Swore up and down to you saying I'ma try
And never did, I try not to cry but I feel bad I didn't apologize
It's time I cough it up and tell more, my soul is taken, never sell yours
I did some shit I probably coulda been in jail for
Bury me deep inside Hell's core
And don't let me out until you hear bells roar

[Pre-Hook]
She said, ""You never loved me, you just controlled me
If you fuck around I'm calling the police""
But all I wanted to say was I'm sorry
Oh, how I wish that could tell you
[Hook]
You're gone, you're dead
You'll never know that I was sorry
Just leave me alone, stay out my head
I wish that I could tell you
You're gone, you're dead
You'll never know that I was sorry
Just leave me alone, stay out my head
I wish that I could tell you

[Verse 2]
It's hard to forget, my heart is a brick
I tell myself ""Marcus, I thought that you were smarter than this""
The mess I put you through was worse than Pearl Harbor and shit
I'd always harm you and flip, mentally scar you and trip
Sometimes I'd argue and get the nerve to call you a bitch
Then bruise your back against the dresser that I tossed you against
My Juliet? At the time I never thought you was it
I do now but shit you're gone, so I just offer you this
A song to you, through it I open the crack in my chest
And show the whole world I've always had a lack of respect
For women who enter my life, I look to vengeance as knife
Intentions to fight, if you thinking I was senseless you right
Now every sentence I write, I think twice on it so I don't regret
'Cause only stress lies in a sinful mind of loneliness
I'm an unholy mess, put me in a hole to rest
Welcome to my life this is how painful my stories get

She said, ""You never loved me, you just controlled me
If you fuck around I'm calling the police""

Just leave me alone, stay out my head

Just leave me alone, stay out my head
I wish that I could tell you

[Verse 3]
Now use this track as a lesson
All you guys out there who have some aggression
Towards your woman it don't have to get hectic
That crap is pathetic, now look at me I have to regret it
I can't go near her or nothing, she'll probably have me arrested
The only thing I could do is just make a track with a message
And hope she hears it so she could know I was badly affected
I never meant to be that type of guy
But I realized that I was, and because of it I'm throwing my sinister life aside
I can cry at any moment just thinking about it
Sometimes I hide it from the folks that I'm hanging around with
I should apply for a new soul 'cause I think it's invalid
Somebody told me when I die I'll be safe but I doubt it
The grudge she holds against me, it hurts me so severely
She won't come near me, I thought that time was supposed to cure me
I'm so alone and weary, writing songs to heal me
I swear that I'm sorry Heather, I mean it so sincerely
[Pre-Hook]
She said, ""You never loved me, you just controlled me
If you fuck around I'm calling the police""
But all I wanted to say was I'm sorry
Oh, how I wish that could tell you

You're gone, you're dead
You'll never know that I was sorry

They don't care where the cops is
Outta the blue they stop biz
Teacher start givin' me a pop quiz
I stay 10 minutes in night clubs
Pocket full of green, Duke on it that invented the light bulb
I might pass on a female, and call up a substitute just for night
Class in the CL
Ya man don't know why his chicks knees be scared
Can't tell her from givin' my dick CPR
If ya lift up and say ya jaws hurtin', before squirtin'
It's for certain
You are the weakest link, ""Goodbye""

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You know my girls in North and South Caddy
They all for mouth waxin'
And the whores in Texas, oral sexes
I head to Cali, take more blows to the head than Ali
And the Philly mamies suck the kid outta Willie Bonnie
And the way females show southern hospitality in ATL
Don't even know them hoes
In South Beach, they let me jimmy dip in they mouthpiece
Forget about Vegas, the head is outrageous
The broads in Seattle will make ya knees rattle
Fa shizzle da snizzle get smizzle down in VA
Them hoes in Detroit will suck the whole Brevoort
My dick don't get to die down when I'm in Chi-Town
My bitches in B-More, blow me 'til they knees sore
Good damn, there face I, ain't screwed out in St. Lou'
New York, it ain't got no pipe instructions
They just suck it outta you like liposuction

Pills and the liqour; she followin' like Twitter

California piff and I'm feelin' hella stellar
Got the white bitch and she look like Helen Keller
Silent, as I take it violent
Callin' me Annie Sullivan, while I'm mothafuckin' goin' in
Teachin' her what she don't know and shit
Cause, life is a class and I graduated
I'm witchya bitch and you just masturbatin'
You niggas is real and I am fakin'
There, I dissed myself, fuck ya hatin'
Doctors tell me I got apathy
Tell 'em I don't give a fuck crazily
Cause I'm dirty, like headphones touchin the concrete
I got gangrene, cause I fucked ya mommy
If ya want peace, that's not me
Cause I'll puff the piff, and fuck your bitch, and fuckin' cut off your dick
Get a counsellor, that's tough shit
This is fuckin Mystery; a fuckin' whodunnit
Pitter patterin', lightin' and thunderin'
It's demonic, motherfuck ya wonderin'
If you don't? I'll motherfuck ya children
Shove and stuff 'em into a cauldron
And jerkin' off to they ballin'
The cops is who you try to be callin'
But I stopped their lives with a donut too enthrallin'
With anthrax in it
Then I faxed their bitches: the grotesque ass pictures"

Well you lookin' at the king
And my superfresh lyrics are the realest I will bring
And its wintertime cold
But the summer heat lyrics that I bring
The same ones that keel me from fallin in the spring
In this game all I ever get is A’s
While you rappers wannaB’s

Rockin the mic wit E’s (ease)
And all these girls ever wanna do is F me

Im a microfiend, microfiend
Yea we on deck
Lyrically killin' the best
Annihilatin' the rest
With a summerman S on my chest
Im a fireman soldier
And I am beautiful in every eye of the beholder
Corrosive, explosions of ink to the paper
Get the money now and I count it all later
Mind so sharp like my head full of razors
Yea im going off like a pencil to erasers
Unique techinique with divine tongue design
I ain't sayin im the best but you undermine
Underline brilliant rhymes
Einstein and I the same cuz we think alike
Make a signed artist ask me to send em the rights
Literally killin', lyrically wit sick deliveries
And im a beast, increase the heat
Once the beats released ugh
I think im a bit materialistic
Have a heavenly vision
Think a bit hellenestic, nd I
Think you gotta step up to my level
Grow more beastly with every pump in my vessel
Cold fusion, just listen to the music
Hello all my haters you can thank me later
Yea, nd im so far gone
If we can't live together then we dyin alone ya digg

Popular Thug,Kelis,['hip hop'],"[Intro: Pusha T]
You know what I am
You know what I do
Well at least I thought you knew
They call me Pusha!
Damn

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
I take it like a slap in the face
Every time the base is mentioned like I had bad intentions
Listen, I thought love was given
So for you I did those things you were missin'
Never have to say ""please gimme borrow""
As long as I got yay and two semi autos
And connects in the jets like wetback Carlos
I ain't askin' you to follow
Just think about tomorrow, please

[Kelis]
I should have known by the way that you stared
Eyeing passers-by like you're rich but life ain't fair
But ya
[Chorus: Kelis] (Pusha T)

I would have never talked to you if I had known you was a popular thug
Hey, popular thug (Ya damn right)
I would have never talked to you if I had known you was a popular thug
Hey, popular thug (Ya Damn right)

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
I can't help if I'm a thug and I'm popular
I think that come along with driving a shocking car
Watch the coke light up they life, the rocks is stars
Had fiends talking crippled cause they locked they jaw
Aw, ""Pusha T, you think its cool that you deal?""
'Bout as cool as that breeze on the beach in Brazil
As long as fiends want 'caine then I'm gon' slang
When my financial change then I'm gon' change

I should have seen in the way you touched my hand
Shuffling your car keys but sounded like a gentleman
But ya

Hey, popular thug (Ya damn right)
I would have never talked to you if I had known you was a popular thug
Hey, popular thug (Ya Damn right)

[Pusha T]
You don't know it yet
Its the life that I live that you love and the fact that I'm thug
That had you holding techs
When you really didn't know what it was but you did it out of love
Shit, far from deprived give you all of your fetishes
Like treacherous necklaces begets etceteras
Colours coming out make your head spin like Exorcist
Spending bright futures in the hood all them no good messages

[Kelis]
I should have heard it in the way you said my name
While I analyzed your tone you were formulating games
But ya

I Met Oprah,Kanye West,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
This my last motherfuckin' freestyle dog
If you don't let me go first this time man, you'll have to wait 'til the album come out Monday
I'm tired man I'm sick and tired
I'm just a player player
Plus it's an exclusive KanyeToThe beat? C'mon man
Fuck around throw this on your instrumental shit too
This is what I'mma have to say

[Verse]
Niggas old as hell, trying to get they rapping on
In the club looking like a fucking chaperone
I'm in the club, posted up, ""Guess Who's Back"" is on
If not that then the Just Blaze track is on
It's all Roc the world, we all got your girl
Caught your girl, never gave back your girl
Watch the rap unfurl, after Beanie Mack confirm
Kanye best producer-rapper in the world
Now I have beans, I'm going after MCs
Show 'em that this rap game made for me
Made for us, they bite and they plagiar-us
They spit the style for the niggas that made it up
That's like me buying soul beats for my album
Dog, I had to eat, I sold beats from my album
Now I got heat, I hold beats for my album
February 18th, reach for my album
Niggas forcing me to keep the heater
Black strap, white handle, I got Jungle Fever
Black Benz, white truck, and one 2-seater
I'm in the game getting change like a parking meter
And since Takeover
It feel like the whole hood try to get a Jimmy Jones makeover
I got the hood on my shoulder, city on my back
They like ""Damn, I heard you charging 50 a track! I mean
You can at least give me a stack
You can't do all that hard work yourself and not give nothing back!""
You know how shit change when your name get to buzzing
This year alone I got two dozen new cousins
Niggas popping out the woodworks, talking about ""you owe me""
Mama, I'm famous, niggas hate me that don't know me
[Outro]
Yo, I know you all suprised and shit when you see me on MTV
But keep your eyes glued to...I don't know what channel that is out here
In Chicago that's Channel 7, ABC
You might fuck around see me on Oprah Winfrey or something
Matter of fact, true story, true story
Last week...I got a little cold right now, true story, though
I'm on 40th and like 5th or something
I see an SUV and the window rolled down and shit!
And this black lady from Chicago, she like
""Yo, um, I just bought one of these in black.""
You know I just got the G5 or whatever
She like, ""I just got one of these in black
How does it drive?""
I'm like, ""it drive more like a truck than my last one.""
I'm like, ""yo, but I'm from Chicago, too. I wanna be on your show!""
She said ""yo, well, oh, ok, well, who are you?""
And I told her, ""I'm Kanye West, a rapper."""
The Boondocks Theme Song,Asheru,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","I am the stone that the builder refused
I am the visual, the inspiration
That made Lady sing the blues

I'm the spark that makes your idea bright
The same spark that lights the dark
So that you can know your left from your right

I am the ballot in your box, the bullet in the gun
The inner glow that lets you know to call your brother son
The story that just begun, the promise of what's to come
And I'mma remain a soldier till the war is won

Hey! What's your name? Oh, that's nice
Me? I'm Wolf, you can call me Tyler though
I'm eighteen, you from around here?
Oh, you look like my next victim
I said you look like my ex-girlfriend, sister

[Verse 1]
While James is jamming on the mixer
We can play Twister naked
Don't be afraid, it's just a kiss
I'm open to everything if you're inviting your sister
That's another topic, we should start a project
You could be the lab rat, I could be the doctor
Let me drug you up and put different things in you
But I'm not gonna do that until you begin to pass out
Now I can draw your face up pretty
Or do it jackass and leave your breath all shitty
Or I can get the hand held and hold held titty
And stick my dick in you but that just might offend you
Teenage parties, I recommend you
Never get drunk with a nigga like us
But I kinda like your company
And you rubbing on my dick, yeah it comforts me
Fuck, condom pocket, luckily, I brought one
Herpes virus, yeah bitch, I fought one
I don't want you to have my permit yet
That I just haven't came up with a name yet
I got some new shit, well technically, I got a new dick
The other one fell off in a pulpit
A gay coaches' white grease and Chris Stokes
Blew the fuck up in gray clouds of thick smoke
Funny, right? Ha-ha, this shit's jokes
I got the idea from a letter that the shit wrote

Hey, you right there
In that pretty red dress, let's dance
I said hey, you right there
In that pretty red dress, let's fuck (rough)

[Verse 2]
Well, I have a gram cupcake mix
Mix a little syrup, it ain't no way to cure him
But I don't do the syrup, I just do the sniffles
Take a couple bits, bitch kibbles, bitch I gotta riddle
What can you tickle that can make a dinosaur giggle
I'm tryna get your puss, your pimple is a push
Away from the tush, I don't smoke kush
I don't do drugs, I don't even club
I don't drink beer, why the fuck am I here
The girls are really cute but there on X
And that's a better reason to for me to take advantage with sex
And you might be next, you pass out on
Me and your mouth drool, throw you in my van now it's carpool
Let you rest your ass on my dick like a barstool
Going deep like a scuba with the snorkle
You never gonna forgive me, but your so damn pretty
I'mma drop you off home quickly
You passed out, bitch you ain't even listening
And leave your house empty, your neighbors didn't see me
Your never gonna get me, your self respect were skimpy
You was up thirty, now you're down fifty
Abracadabra your memory I'm tricky
You are what I rob so I guess your pussy empty
Just like your home by taking the store of oreos
Over by the cabin of cheerios and the mint tea

Yep. But.. I had fun, tonight..

That Night,Atmosphere,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Don't even know if I can write this song
Caught on a beam between right and wrong
Gotta keep forward, keep straight
For the sake of why we stay awake all night long
It's not up for interpret
Paranoid of exploiting the verdict
But in the same breath
I got thoughts that I wanna express and let surface
This ain't for props or the pop culture
It's about a balloon that got punctured
The sunshine's fun till it burns someone
And we all got burnt that summer
She was sixteen
Another young angel with clipped wings
She came to the shows, but I never met her
Don't even know if she was listening
That night, we lost a supporter
That night, somebody lost a daughter
He raped and killed her at the venue
Can't comprehend what her friends must have went through
That night, the sun went dark
Now watch everyone on the tour bus fall apart
That night, Lord have mercy
The music died that night in Albuquerque
[Verse 2]
Stop, it can't be true, right?
This type of real doesn't happen to you, right?
Cresent, Murs, Dibbs, Jaybird
I wanna go home now and start a new life
Wish I could protect the kids
I guess safety is hit or miss
With a prior convicted sex offense against
A four year old, why we let you live?
Don't know what I'm trying to write
But there's a part of me that keeps dying that night
And when I think about her mother
I become another number that wants you to suffer
You're locked up for now
You have no more chances to steal the children's laughs
And if you ever find God
Better pray to her and ask that we never cross paths"
D.S.W.G. Dark Skinned White Girls,Murs,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1:]
She got that mocha-chino baby on the back of the bus
If you close your eyes and listen she would be one of us
Never did trust, her family at home
So she kicked it in the hood, raised her self on her own
She talk with that tone, but she white to the bone
You would swear she was black if you spoke on the phone
Some say its overgrown, but she don't give a damn
All the black girls think that she want they man
But it's not your fault that they attracted to you
That you blessed and got as much back as you do
Most white boys say that you're way too thick
And some brothers might say, you're the number one pick
You say [psh], girl...Roll your eyes twist your neck
But it comes from the soul you don't mean no disrespect
And even when they check you, you just keep it movin'
Cuz in your heart you feel you ain't got nothing to be provin'

[Hook x2:]
Whether chocolate or vanilla, or you're somewhere in between
A cappuccino mocha or a caramel queen
Rejected by the black, not accepted by the white world
And this is dedicated to them dark skinned white girls
[Verse 2:]
Now she like The Smiths, The Cure, really into Morrisey
Heavy on the rock never fooled with the Jodeci
You would notice she was never really welcomed by the others
Hard to find a date when there was only ten brothers
In the whole damn school, and they thought she was weird
Cuz she wore her hair different, and she never joined cheer
A melancholy dolly with a Polly want-a syndrome
White step-father black daddy never been home
And when on the quad she could hear em' say
Look at how she walks, why she talk that way
But girl it's okay, your black is beautiful
No matter how you dress, or no matter what music you like
Forget what they say, you're doin' it right
No more grabbin' on your pillow as you cry through the night
Stand strong, hold your ground at any cost
And know that everyone who tries to put you down is lost

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3:]
Now for you half-and-half and mixed girls, I know what the battle be
Every time you go out, it's what's your nationality
Everybody always wanna dig up in your background
You don't look _, now how does that sound
I couldn't tell you were...
Oh, is that right
Do you take it as a compliment or start up a fight
Venezuelan and Indian, Rican and Dominican
Japanese or Portuguese, quarter a Brazilian and
White and Korean, Black and Pinay
I could find out later it don't matter you're fly
It really don't make a difference to most of us guys
We just need an excuse to get close and say hi
I know they call you stuck up, you think you're too pretty
Spreadin' rumors about you, all throughout the city
So much attention, so many haters
But don't be bitter, you'll be better for it later and...

I'm blazed I'm cool, straight A's in school
I am rap Simba countin' down my days to rule
Light up the

Diesel, hash, or purple
Diesel, hash, or purple's what we passing through the circle

(Imitation of Chezaray's girlfriend)
""Oh my god, Frankie's such a stoner, he's always craving slurpees
Or turkey-flavored jerkies (chuckle) I think he gave me herpes
I know his dick is cheating, love is such a scary game
He draws hearts around the name, who the fuck is Mary Jane?!""
Mary Jane, I can't explain about the way you make me feel
I've never felt this way 'bout anyone, I think this may be real
But, don't you get confused, when I'm finished and I'm through
I'mma pass you 'round the crew, so my boys can hit you too
And I'm leaving evidently cause I'm feening for some Wendy's
Chicken sandies, BK dollar menu, Mickey D's and Friendly's
Fuck a Beamer, Benz, or Bentley, we cruisin' in the Civic
All my dudes' been gettin' zooted off this buddha since we lit it
If you tellin' me to quit then I don't care for the convo
I smoke like a manhole under Marilyn Monroe
And don't try to tell me what the fuck to do
Cause if you didn't like this song, well this blunt's for you"
Im Ill Remix,Frank Chezaray,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Verse One:
Ok, You're ill, but being ill never paid the bills
So instead of taking pills, you should get on making mills
The heavy shit I drop will give a feather-weight the chills
If he's ill, I could help but the medications kills

[Ha ha ha] F.C's the initial
Ain't a referee in any league this official
But honestly, I'd rather blow trees than a whistle
I'm as ill as aids homie you're a sneeze or a sniffle

Plus, my weeds purple like squeezing a nipple
My crew stay cool like the breeze is my biffle
I got what these rap cats need Like
Kibbles n bits- I'm the sickest thing since syphilis bitch

And my mission is this, Run this whole rap race
In a sprint don't stop till the ribbon is ripped
Now that's ill, shit I'm the sickest in the booth
Tell Webstar I'm coming for his chicken noodle soup
LIKE RRAH
Chorus- I'm Ill

Verse 2:

Alright Look, Sam Adams your auto tune's very sweet
But in Queens we chug forties, and pussies drink cherry wheat
I'm aware I have no class, I play hookie like every week
Your a rookie and I'm a beast, I go wookie on every beat

Now lookie you don't compete, throw a book at me fuckin' geek
I ain't scared to hit a bitch, you'll get Snookied up in the street
Fake rappers get devoured, just look at these fuckin' teeth
I'm St. Nicholas and they just the cookies I fucking eat

Look, I don't love college, I had the fall tuition
But I spent every cent on my Adderall addiction
My brothers like,""Mom, my hat and ball are missin
And why is Frankie bouncing off the fuckin' wall and twitchin?""

Listen, liston, shrooms are what I trip on
Any whore coming for my balls will get stiff-armed
Any rapper claiming he's the bomb will get disarmed
And treated like the toilets that I take my fuckin' shits on

[Verse 1]
Okay, one for the money, two for the money
I used to write jokes, ain't this shit funny?
Models on me, yes these girls crazy
Gotta take advantage, that is what the fans made me
Shine on these niggas, how these niggas stay shady?
And if you don't see me, you are not star gazing
Play my cards right, I may never meet the dealer
And yes I'm in the building like a horror movie killer
I gotta stay sick, I'd be dead if I was iller
Is it weird going hard when these niggas goin' pillow?
Yep, my life is great, I changed my stars
I re-arrange fate when I rap on bars
Cheezy in the building, hope you niggas missed me
Chilling with these bitches, got my nigga feeling tipsy
Haters mean mugging, face is sour like my whiskey
I don't need a chaser, tell that liquor come and get me
Who'd have thought this rapping make sense, no 50?
And if you're doing great like I am, Say it with me

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I used to be broke, no cash
And them niggas played games, Road Rash
Walking 'round NYU, looking for a dollar
Too proud to ask my friends or my struggling father
So I skate around the city for a couple hours
Dreaming up a day that I could say this world is ours
Now I got some, but I want it all
And I won't stop until Rihanna gives my ass a call
And I know that I'm addicted to this alcohol
Cause this shit hurts, call it the uncle curse
But I'm living for the moment, not the long haul
And I refuse to slow down until its last call
Erykah keeps telling me to grow a conscience
And treat women like money, no object
But these hoes are a much different story
Straight laced chicks don't do nothing for me
I'm in a weird place, I got a little money
But money won't buy you time, If all the time is running from me
There's so much I wanna do, like write a script or write a book
Get an hour on HBO, and date a girl who likes to cook
And stop having all of these crushes on all of my friends girlfriends
I think I'm jealous they got someone when the world ends
It looks nice, I gotta get me one of those
I haven't found Mrs. Right, but I'm on it though
Yeah, I'm on it though
[Chorus]
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it

Well I'm so human it is a goddamn shame... I'm your thing
And I make sure that I always keep me some pain- yessir
To remind me that I survived somehow- oh
Lord please don't let nothing steal me away right now- cause I wanna live!

Cuz I wanna hut two three four what the hell are you waiting for
Live (think about it are you sure you're really living)

And it's a miracle that I'm still alive

Said stand up, everybody, uh this is your life
You gotta get it when you can y'all
Half rich for months is your knife
We can't forget about the brothers, the sisters, the lovers who ain't here
You only got one life y'all and I repeat the point it ain't clear
And if it ain't fair then what's stopping you from going
Do you not want to be responsible for knowing
Cuz ignorance is bliss
And ignorance is just so fucking ignorant you may even be ignorant of this

Simple and Blunt,Insane Clown Posse,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Violent J]
Check it out
Another fuckin' sampler, I won't even front
I'll fuckin' tell you all about our shit, simple and blunt
And if you take the time to listen as I run this down
Maybe you might even dig our shit and understand the wicked clown
We forever underground 'cause up on the surface
They've always said we talentless pieces of shit and worthless
Yet, as I'm writing this now
I glance over at the wall, and I don't know how
But we got two platinum albums and another four gold
And we never used MTV, we went up the back road
And built a fanbase that's so behind the clown
That they'll tear your fuckin' city in half to show they down
But see that's just it though, it ain't a fan base
It's a family drawn together like we from outer space
I mean, we call ourselves juggalos, I guess I'd explain
That we relate 'cause we been through the same kinds of pain
I mean, ICP don't rap about the money we get
Because half the juggalos so broke they stealing our shit
And they don't wanna hear about us pushing a Benz
When they takin' fuckin' Greyhounds just to get to gatherings
We likes it wicked, we keeps it wicked
We like cartoon serial slaughterers on our record
It's how we adjust to the pressures of life
Let our music do the killing for you, you'll be alright
And seriously, ain't you the least bit curious
What's up with this underground world? We gettin' furious
Just like this sampler that you're bumping right now
This might be your calling to our carnival grounds
Tell me this, motherfucker, truly, how you livin'?
Ever get the urge maybe do a little wig-splittin'?
Ever been the last kid picked for a team?
Ever had motherfuckers come and shit on your dreams?
Do you have ideas and something to say
Only ain't nobody ever got they ears pointed your way?
Ever been fucked with for like this and like that
And go home with crazy thoughts about cutting they neck?
You might find an escape in this band the world hates
'Cause we been getting shit on, homie, we can relate
And ain't nobody here dating any Hollywood stars
Attending VIP parties at high-profile bars
But if we ain't your cup of tea then just don't fuck with me
I respect the fuck out the fact that you stuck with me
And listened on while I tried to explain ourselves
'Cause the hatchet's hustling for some record sales
We know that ICP is fuckin' hated and doubted
But our new album's the bomb and I wouldn't lie about it
We call it the Wraith and it's the sixth joker's card
And the juggalo world's been waiting long and hard
So we saving it all, we won't play you a lick
That's why they got me on here rappin' 'bout this shit
But for ten years this album has been in our focus
Everything from Dog Beats on through to Dark Lotus
And it's finally dropping on November 5th
Unless the fucking record label fucks up the shit
Plan is that's the day that the best we can do
Will be put in the stores and delivered to you
Or you can download the shit free, most probably will
But the packaging and booklet it comes with is ill
So if you're lookin' for the best way of copping it free
My advice is hit a record store and pluck the CD
Get you the booklet and get you the disc
And leave all the case with the cover and shit
And then buy something cheap like a Britney Spears sticker
So they don't get suspicious when they see you at the register
One way or the other I can promise you this
Juggalo or not, our fuckin' record's the shit
And I don't give a fuck what Rolling Stone ends up givin'
'Cause that's just some fuckin' other idiot's opinion
If he knows what's so dope he should make it himself
And quit fucking judging every-fuckin-body else
Anyway, all we trying to say
Is that our bomb ass LP is headed your way
A little something for the underdogs out there
We extending a dap to let you know that we here
And our carnival doors is always open to yours
And for everybody else we stand up in applause
For taking a little time to listen to me spit
On this here free CD hatchet sampler shit
And for all the juggalos out there that been know the deal
We put together this here for you to feel
Come on"

Get the scale, weed I got a grip for sale
Bitch I'm making chip off sales while sipping on White Zinfandael
Probably sipping still cause it is my favorite flavor
My beat wake the block up like ""Hodgy Beats hates all his neighbors""
They call the po-po, I'm cocking back the 44
The one man army, my automatic Rose Gold
Double O, subtract one numero from Seven
Taking niggas back to school like a bus ride for adolescents
Wolves plotting for their future like fucking investments
And I go so hard, that's why your bitch keep on caressing
Flat iron and pressing my VCR buttons
But this a DVD so you can watch it with your cousins
2010, bitch we get it in
Go ahead and tell your friends, I hope them bitches be twins
Doobies in Jacuzzis, white bitches with big booties
I'm a pirate, going after them diamonds and them rubies

[Hook: Mike G]
I be like hello, play them corners like their cellos
It go crazy in the streets when the hype gets mellow
(I got my feet up, laid back, smoking on a haze sack
Sitting on a haystack, we go off like grenade caps)
Makeshift millions, knocking down your buildings
Know they fear me I'm a villain, stacking dollars to the ceiling
(I'm on the corner for you, judge me I'll destroy your lawyer
Outta Luckett like Letoya, Mellow one's too Hype to bore you)
[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
Girl you so sour but you're sweet like candy
Let's fuck in the forest, mother nature and Bambi
Balling like Camby, organic like cran' be
Glass house on a beach for when I want to get Sandy
Everything is dandy, ask my nigga Handy
I take a strike in L.A. Lights like I'm dodging with Manny
Girls drop them panties, even their aunties.. no grannies
Grandma, I'm leaking on the beat like a tampon
Phlegm spitting 'til my whole Odd Future camps on
We get our camp on, Jansport and Eddie Bauer
Stay fresh before hopping up in any shower
Death to haters tryna take minutes up off my hour
I got the hood with me, I'm the nigga with the power
Weed, cocaine, and the muthafuckin' Zannies
Me and Brain lurk together like a fucking family

[Verse 3: Mike G]
I mastered this in Sessions I be last to hit
But my confidence brim, that means there's none after this
This rhyme spitting done turned me to a convict
I'm fucking sick, there's no resolution to this conflict
Well, death might be one
But there's no stopping these wolves, for your heads we come
I'm a rider, garage got motorbikes in it
They're confused, scratch their heads like theres fucking lice in it
Party hard, man it's Golden, have them hands foldin'
Mellow keep it rollin', that's how we stay Loaded
Like them fo'-fo's, they stay in them four-doors
Bitches watch when they go slow, we pimp them hoes that drive Rodeo's
And Volvo's, because they fuck with lame niggas
They ain't learn? Hatin' niggas won't make your chain bigger
You're comedy to me and crowds flee when your shit's on
You get fake applause like a TV sitcom"

Building this Fifth foundation in the wilderness
Thoughtless, trespass and enter Thought's fortress
Limitless interest, paid to the order of the
Cypher slaughterer, my mic slapping you senseless
Defenseless, niggas never moving me inches
The beat Fifth, invisible in the trenches
Aficionado, awesome hip-hop drug problem
Fuck stardom and chickens up in Gotham

Let's lay back, though -- let's lay back
Niggas need to check my files, man
I came in as a baby -- '95, nigga
Had breast milk on my breath

[Verse 1]
A lotta niggas never wore gold
Til they went gold
Never rocked platinum
Til they went platinum
Never got caught with a .45 Magnum
Until the cops pulled over they tour bus and bagged 'em
Crooked been a gangster; bang bang llamas
Lotta niggas like to say it'll eat you like Jeffrey Dahmer
But I'mma say it'll eat you like you was part of the Donner Party
Do your research, then you can holler
You can ask my momma
See what she gon' tell ya
I was shooting pistols, she was banging Mahalia
Jackson -- treat it like a class, then I fail ya
If you fail to plan, you plan to fail -- you a failure
Lotta emcees like to say they're flipping birds
Do you mean a middle finger, or did you pitch and serve?
Wasn't cooking in the kitchen; shit is just absurd
I'm serving different verbs and nouns -- shit, I'm flipping words
Drive-by shooter? Nah, I never kill cats
Even if I did, I wouldn't tell you -- can you feel that?
Heard about your house and your car -- now where your skills at?
Real motherfucking emcee, Crooked is still that
Tired of you phony-ass rappers pissing me off
I'm feeling like I'm Tiger Woods playing miniature golf
You ain't menaces, you sensitive -- niggas is soft
You niggas innocent; now witness a militant boss
Lyrical god, they comparing Jay-Hova to me
Polytheism, you ain't gotta change over to me
We both gods even though Jay's older than me
See, he was GS-300 -- Ranger Rover was me
Around the time that my dude dropped Reasonable Doubt
I filled the truck up with weed as I was leaving the house
Headed toward any small city seeing a drought
Had to show them different towns what Cali weed was about
[Verse 2]
I know you never wore gold
Before you went gold
Never had platinum
Before you went platinum
Before 2Pac made ""Cali Love"" a anthem
I was getting Cali love, fucking hoes at random
In Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, I was getting at 'em
333 Kelker, yeah, that's where we had 'em
Living on the East Coast, I was only 16
Big bro in the six-fo' with the imph beam
All of my Philly niggas, yeah they had sick schemes
It's only right that I put 'em in my sixteens
Homie slinging to escape the hard living
Had a gift for selling crack -- can't say that it's God-given
Lot of clientele, think one of 'em Todd Bridges
First and fifteenth, screaming, ""Money, cars, bitches""
All the G's say, ""Young Crooked, die snitches
Think about your money -- yup, that's boss business""
Everything they told me, me and the homies echo
This is dedicated to bad chicks on Miwebo's
The ones that want me followed around by Joey Greco from Cheaters
They scared to call, they know I let go of heaters
Shoot up the camera crew
Hoes get in my way, they get the hammer too
Get it popping like Shabba Doo
Have a few scattered cadavers splatter the avenue
Haven't you heard that I spit on street beats
Since I was a little nigga watching Spit on Beat Street?
Don't know skills? Put my shit on repeat
Still don't know, put my shit on each week
I'm rhyming for respect
Still feeling like a Vegas dealer in the club, got diamonds on deck
Jokers get a blade, cut your heart with a spade
This is C.O.B. When? Til I D-I-E, oh
Never had gold til you went gold
Never rocked platinum til you went platinum
Fuck a freestyle my nigga, this is my anthem
Crooked been shining like the rims on the Magnum

And my Warriors are Rad,and your reign is just a fad
So I'm cutting up they ass and stuffing them into bags
With no holes in 'em, flow is vicious as Doberman's
Wolf territory starts when you pass Slauson and Overland
But fuck, OF, that's fam, nah dawg them ain't my homies
Even my own gang jealous, I got all these bitches on me
Now I got 'em saying oh man
I'm down for red eye flights, Chafferer's flag me down when I'm in Japan
And that'll be some shit that we know well
Making bitches Scream in a Tokio Hotel

[Hook x2]
I don't know why they don't like me
When everybody else screaming ""Go Mike G""
I don't see why you don't like me
When everybody else screaming ""Go Mike G""
[Verse 2]
I love Christina Milian but I don't love no bitch
And if Love Don't Cost a Thing then I ain't paying for shit
And everyone running their mouth should pay attention to their race
And you shouldn't deal with hoes that be all up in your face
Got a main bitch but I keep her in her place
Even my next girl know she could be easily replaced
And it could be soon, this is my space so there is no room
I'm Doom, my Dark Reign made the whole town sad
Cause the King's back, stuffing bodies into Brown Bags
And I'm taxing now but you can get the right price
Bitches lean on me cause I mix well with ice
She was thinking money too, we must have the same mind
Shine, rhyme, pull fine dimes, all at the same time
Can't copy my swag, that's yours that ain't mine
And I don't claim colors, this middle finger's my gang sign

[Hook x2]
I don't know why they don't like me
When everybody else screaming ""Go Mike G""
I don't see why you don't like me
When everybody else screaming ""Go Mike G""

[Verse 3]
I'll take them 21 and over, my stores are saying we card
And I'll flash the garage just to show them that we hard
Keep them clips loaded, I'm shooting cause we're stars
And strike like snakes on them, them Vipers are saying we Dodge
Coming up fast, my connection doesn't lag
You can holla at me if you see me on the Ave
If you got a problem with me you should leave it in the past
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning, all this god damn swag
Tell them that I'm on, G said get the scale
Odd is so amazing, they can't be for real
Ain't even got a video, but I'm still pulling hoes
Used to carry Biscuits, parents wonder what the Hell?
I'm from the West nigga, we ain't after no L's
Tryna get paid by any means, wasn't thinking just sales
My album ain't got to sell out, cop fast our tickets do
Ain't got to go Gold, nigga Gold is what I'm giving you"
OkayMikeg,Mike G,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","I don't want it to end yet, but I didn't begin yet
I said you're just a fan, you're just not really a friend yet
Something that I've been said, practice makes perfect
But I'll probably die tomorrow, tell me is it really worth it
I can read the latest books, learn everything I need to
But it seems they'll still look at me like a crook
I'm like, yeah I'm pretty nice, yeah I'm pretty much an asshole
And they don't understand so it sounds hypocritical but fuck you
And I'm still the one the young niggas look up to
Imagine what I'd do if I was passionate as dudes
Who only look around because they're searching for the truth
And I'm still searching for a coupe, but only lurking in this booth
And still more hazardous than you, still a casket fits my suit
I wonder when my last breath is, life sucks but fuck
I'm really tired of imagining how death is
And Earth is lame, waiting for the moment that I'm blasting off
I only go hard, I found out that you fags is soft
Your sight is too limited to see my vision
And you never listen so don't tell me OK just to pass me off"
Stick Up,Mike G,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","- We gotta go over there, and we gotta swag it out this time.. not like fucking last time, nigga you almost slapped that blind bitch

- You got big lips too
- Now you over there, stop, st.. look! Aight?

Hold up, it's a Westcoast stick up
Sly Tendencies is in with me, I'm tryna get my rich up
Talking 'bout raising Richie dog, I'm tryna get my Rich up
Good for you? Man I'll give you life like an elixir
He sick, huh? Oh yes, it's a O.F. stick up, Mike
Tell this bitch to put the donuts in the bag quicker, right
Shit I strike niggas, bite bitches, wife hitter, Christ
It's a crisis, niggas hands up like it's a heist, Mike get 'em
Hold up, who'd you say the winner was?
I bet I'll finish quick and eat you faster than your dinner cause
They ask why they fly and crash, I say you gotta land slow
I'm Cancer yo, but healthy though, raps new Rambo
[Hook]
It's a stick up, it's a stick up
Put your hands in the air, it's a stick up

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt & Mike G]
Repeat, it's a stick up, out for greens, to get my Grinch up
Listen bitch, get your kid and get down or get clipped up
You hatin'? Just stop, we gon' blow, just watch
Think not? Grind time, take your fuckin' wristwatch
All their fuckin' vCards, just to prove that we hard
Get it? We hard, he bombards three broads
Then dip out on another mish them niggas on that other shit
Word to mother bitch, we hot as Southern summers is
I'm smooth like Travolta, say they want a face off?
I take off, I'm waitin' for the pay-off, how that go
I rap slow but factual, don't get mad
I'm rad fuckin' awesome, a pimp like Chad swag
High like kites, Cliché, where we stay
There's no such thing as replays, you live once
I just dump, like trash trucks, blast up, no blast off
Bust the chops, then a nut, then adjust the cock, get your ass off

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mike G]
Stepped in the door wavin' the 44
And shot it at three whores, they wouldn't get on the floor
Now they petrified, I'm comin' for everythin' you got
Know you got a lot, why you think I'm runnin' up in your spot
Said I don't play, bet I shoot this white girl and get away
Like O.J., this the life I live I'm talkin' everyday
Said I'd bust again, Sly said that I shouldn't
I Said I should then a nigga looked at me like I wouldn't
So I let one off, shattered glass, went through his ass, he extra soft
And now I'm on a rampage, my partner grabbed the 12 gauge
And threw it to me, started blastin', let three off, let four off
Then I aimed at a nigga who wouldn't take off his jewelry
Like you brave 'til you lose consciousness
But you dumb for fuckin' with niggas with guns and shit
They tried to calm me down, but I'm ready to leave a nigga red
Taco stepped in the way and I shot him in his leg, fuck!

Boomcat anthem waging war on the pretenders

[Verse 1: Tommy Evans]
I'll stop you in your tracks if you start with me
With raps so fat they clog your arteries
I'm so inventive with my artistry
I break ground like earthquakes and part the seas
Be a smart emcee, stop sparking trees
Smokers get blunted, ain't as sharp as T
I'm on point like laboured emcees can't cut it
I'll slice up your intestines, leave you gutted
Destroy the stress, you boys can't test
I'll rip out your windpipe, leave you short of breath
I walk with Jehst, we're Yorkshire's best
My flow's so hot that it will scorch your flesh
I burn emcees, give em the third degree
Send them to Accident & Emergency
They urgently need plastic surgery
Because he said this'll bleed internally
I watch as you fade into obscurity, nuff eternity reign for eternity
I purposely, run perfectly, am I the best? (No doubt)
It's a certainty!
[Verse 2: Jehst]
Yo I decapitate wack and fake rappers at a rapid rate
Either take cover, or run like the clappers mate
Because I'm done with the chatter, make it happen break
Beats and batter tracks, chiefs I eradicate
I can see straight through their front like acetate
Heat up the beats so their weak flows evaporate
Burn the earth til' it reverts to its natural state
Battle great pretenders bend their twisted shit back to shape
Shape shifting man I'll make, plans to assassinate
Piss-take rappers hate the fact that I captivate
Crowds, cos I'm holding it down like gaffa tape
Try and start shit and my sharp wit will lacerate
Half-wits, my gamma ray targets you pop stars
I'll carpet bomb your boot camp, and bombard
Troops tactical, run tracks like stock cars
Burn my name into your back with these hot bars

[Chorus: Jehst and Tommy Evans]
The battle ground stomper, nocturnal author
Kidnap rappers and carry out water torture
Drown a performer, brainstorm on A4
Verbal napalm, blazing the trail for
The battle ground stomper, nocturnal author
Kidnap rappers and carry out water torture
Drown a performer, brainstorm on A4
We wage war on you fake types
[Verse 3: Tommy Evans]
You heard the T ain't tight? Don't believe the hype
I'm louder than a bomb so I don't need a mic
I bring the noise faster than the speed of light
And shower clever rhymes, you don't see too bright
You can't read or write, I'm raps cleverest mind
My body of work is ahead of its time
You'll have to wait til' 2079
The cryptologist will crack every line

[Verse 4: Jehst]
I see you biters setting your watches seconds behind
To try and catch what I'm dropping when you're checking the rhyme
You're saying nothing, like a professional mime
While I'm spitting this liquid of the venemous kind
Read my lips, like an unsettling sign
Now I might flip any minute, leave you dead in your prime
Severing spines with heads, when the letters align
To spell 'Jehst!' I shine as I steadily climb
We can go toe-to-toe so don't be stepping on mine
You see me and T.E. stay deadly combined
We told you once already, now this is double jeapordy
Pre-school lyricists are having trouble getting me
I got a primitive remedy for that attitude
New jack rappers get battered til' they're black and blue
They made a track or two, but didn't have a clue
To me it doesn't matter who you are, I'll still flatten you
Steamroll through your whole crew, fuck your fashion shoot
You couldn't see me if you drank a tank of carrot juice
I get the jam jumping like kangaroos
He who dares - now there's a man who stands to lose
My style's shocking like a damaged fuse
I drop savage tunes, like arsenic in your Malibu

Flicks with chicks, spending G’s on wears and kicks
While these hip-hop ticks stay on my dick
Emcees is all air like bags from Bon-Ton
And stay souped-up just like wonton.  All I got
Is hard times, the illest rhymes, a couple of dimes
And the rusty nines that ain’t even mines
Thousand-dollar links on, gotta get
My drink on, but ain’t never put a mink on
I still get nice and shoot dice, still eat
Pork fried rice, still shoot threes like Mark Price
Second time around (‘Round), still getting down for
My crown (Crown), I’m giving you that hip hop sound

Yo, my rugged
Raps dip on tracks like Japs with straw hats
In Saigon through trees, UG the icon
Squeeze like pythons—you don’t know who you facing
The gat I bust’ll split your ass up like segregation
While Federation comes together like United Nations
To bring obliteration.  151 is what I’m tasting
No hesitation when I come through.  My voice
Shakes cassette tapes when I scream like Clue!
U.G. keep niggas guessing
Break bones like Tekken while niggas fake moves like wrestling
No question, I bring it every time, baby
Don’t try to play me.  I Roc-A-Fella like Jay-Z

Y’all niggas step to the rear ‘cause The Dwellas is here
Disappeared for a year, now the smoke is clear
Debut 23 on the charts of Billboard
Even headliners got floored when we toured because
All my releases are lyrical masterpieces

Get this estate and live great (What?), finally

UG will
Roast ya, focus like Minolta, hold gats
Like a holster that’ll rip through shirts like the Hulkster
Dance on tracks like John Travolta, Saturday Night
Fever, put niggas to sleep like ether
Using the sleeper hold, my flow be ill
Rick Rude rides beats like bass with gills—check it
I wanna sell like Hootie & the Blowfish.  My goatee
Got shorties saying that I look like Will Smith with cuter lips
Hah!  My clip slips slugs to the toaster
Hits your leg and have you limping like Keyser Soze

Rappers got a bigger buzz, bitch I got a bigger dick
That was my Royce line, I'm on my Cali, Brooklyn, Jersey
And Detroit time (Slaughterhouse) Them boys grind
We going past the top, so Mt. Everest won't cut it
You low budget, we bout to go public

Yeah, let me destroy the mic device

Make my (uhh) electrical connection
(mic device gets destroyed, mic device gets destroyed
Let me destroy the mic device)

[Matrix]
Sometimes I wish I could stop the world from spinning and step out
Of it
Kick it off it's axis and stagger these rappers off balance
But instead I challenge, by pourin' advance skills by the gallons
I am, no one has a chance a-gainst this a-mazing
A-L-L action, also instead of babbling like gossiping bitches
Swallowing final wishes
Then hard-rock dreams, of crack cream from fiends
I verbally break-up emcees like disfunctional families
So get with this different mix, like seeds from interractial
Relationships
I draw crowds, at the same time, I erase kids
I discriminate like a racist a-gainst these basic
Lyricists that are cleaning out my wax, clogging my ears up with
Tasteless tunes, flavorless buffoons, that are talkative
Skills far from walkative, when it comes to battlin'
I don't give a fuck like a virgin practicin' sexual abstinence
Cuz in my eyes, your presence makes no appearance like absent
Students
Who went to join the uneducational rookies playin' hooky
With those perpetratin' niggas going bananas, influenced by cannabis
Your far from notorious, far from victorious, far from glamorous
Far from glorious, niggas waste time
Tellin fictious stories of what they pack on they waist-line
While I occupy minds, but leaving these rappers one up like hand-me-
Downs
I slam these clowns, permanently, and leave competition on the hush
Like a suburban library
I'm a perfect candidate, nominatin' for dominatin' these toy thugs
Packin' a ?fort? gun, and a clip full of fakes shootin' full of shit
Bullets
[Hook]
Sometimes I wish I could stop the world from spinning and step out
Of it
Kick it off it's axis and stagger these rappers off balance
But instead I challenge, by pourin' advance skills by the gallons
Keep pourin', keep, keep pourin'
(X2)

[A-Butta]
Yo, I pray to God for all my enemies
I squeeze my vocal chords until my voice box lets out hypnotic
Melodies
And keep my eyes chinky like Vietnamese inhalin' trees
Believe in faith and wisdom, and stay away from Satanism
I abuse those who choose to use forms of plagiarism
Worship me like Paganism, don't decieve my brain with izm
A & Matrix got in on lock, so count your days in prison
I don't care what niggas say, this nigga A will live the day
The simple way, true lyrics, no need to let the trigger spray
Retaliate and strike back as like I was a ricochet
Matter of fact I just let my lyrics say who's A-Butta
While others try to figure ways to discover
How true brothas master facts
And how many heads my rap attracts
Counter-attack the raps like cataracts with eyesight
Get in the Zone deeper than Twilight when I grab the mic tight
What I write tonight will bring hip-hop back to it's origins
While mortal men, stay delicate like porcelain
Lyrics get sicker than the mind of Dr. Kevorkian
My thoughts are blendin' in, like camouflage war terrain
I torture your brain, scorchin' flames when I call ya name
Hip-hop is sure to change, and when it does I'm sure my name
Will probably run through your vein, I shine like polyurethane
What's contained inside my brain, I constantly put crews to shame
Then you wonder who's to blame, when you the main reason
That I hear bums speakin', leave ya eardrums bleedin'
When I hear drum's beatin', the surface of my cerebrum
Penetrates like a parasite sounds to shatter lites (satelites)
(All day, all night) Lyrical syllables I sacrifice
On this mic device I get slicker than Andrew Dice
And switch ya style like hermaphrodites, from models to dykes
Why do rappers say they rappers when they all rap alike?
To me that's nonsense, that's why I drops sense when I grab the mic
And go through those rhymes like po-nine through traffic lights
My rap ignites insight which will paralyze spines
Tranquilize lines, lyricism gratifies minds
Some niggas laugh at my rhymes, but half of the time they ignorant
Insignificant fake hip-hop hypocrites, illiterate
Exquisite lyrics get deep to the touch
Get that crust out of your eyes, you been sleepin' too much
You killed my people enough, in this forbidden industry
Which to me is the epitome of what we call wickedry
And misery, me, myself & I bless the trinity
Test me lyrically and end up, critically wounded
Bless tunes with scriptures that were written in cuneiform
My flow is legendary similar to myths of unicorn
Po-nine is really swine disguised in uniform
You been born into a world with no axis, A & Matrix with no practice
Our flow tactics will put rappers below average
While I stay above the curve
Showdowns with pronouns, plus I make love to verbs"

Unhh
Now this is how it is
We try to handle biz
And make moves in this land where the power lives
Where they devour kids
And acts of cowardice rule from a tool of violence and a shrouded bliss
I try to release my malice
And develop my inner peace in a place so callous
Maybe I'll go to Angola or other Gold Coasts
And blow smoke with the old folks 'cause they know most

[Verse 2: Tajai]
Capture the cultured pearls, jewels, and gems
It's a treasure hunt to stimulate your medulla stem
The furthest reaches are within your clutches
Concrete covered countries to the most birded regions
Virgin territories, those exposed to man made woes
They know them Hieros
Electrified with lectures, collect respect and ride on
Before you even know this I'm gone (no)

Go to Saigon, Singapore, Sicily
They consider me epitome in Italy (that's right)
Hit Libya, India, Morocco

Maybe it's just me
But I feel I'm clutching
To hold nothing
I mean bluffing
I got the poker face
I don't really know my place
And I never chose this way
So I go astray
Throw aways blow away
Every hope I hold today
We were sold as slaves
The sky is cold and grey
My niggas showed the way
So fan and listen now with this
I see my golden age

Smokin' like a 'O' roster

We rock the venue like we dropped a missile
But it ain't an attack

Life is a blast when you know what you're doin
Best to know what you're doin 'fore your life get ruined
Life is a thrill when your skill is developed
If you ain't got a skill or trade, then shut the hell up

[Verse 1: Del]
My rhymes is like droppin your head on cement
Crackin' it open hopin to make a dent; I'm hell-bent on
Resurrection, per-fection
Lesson #1: rekindle the essence
Rap ain't about bustin caps and fuckin bitches
It's about fluency with rhymin ingenuity
All of this is new to me, see I peep rhymes
With scrutiny, under a microscope I walk a tightrope
A thin line between insanity and sanity
Mixed with a little vanity, boostin the morality
With Hiero hospitality, soon to strike it rich
Like calories, salaries, ahh sounds like a plan
And, I will expand hip-hop as well
Might even kick a little impromptu, to stomp you
Weaklings, speaking things foreign to the human ear
That, you will fear now, whether you like it or not
Blood clots on your little life on the situation
And on the stipulations... the shit you wastin'
Time on you pawns, it was planned like that
But we can fight back, like David Horowitz
And say we want no more of this
And put it in a cryogenic status
Replace it with the latest in technology
Hip-Hop policies that demolish ya follies
Olly olly oxen free, get off of me
You can't see this, your defeatist attitude'll
Get you nowhere fast, I tend to my task cause

If you ain't got a skill or trade, then shut the hell up

Best to know what you're doin 'fore your life get ruined

Don't even start on the next man, let's scan
Your situation, you still have no patience
Flip on niggas, rob niggas, even family
All the way up to your moms -- you can't stand to be
In the house, but when you kicked out you beggin
To come back in then the same old skit happens
You say you rappin but you don't know the essence
Just ho slap and bustin caps is your message
Plus every time I put some scrill down, you steal it
If that's your way of teachin me a lesson I don't feel it
Your raps reflect your life and that's a shame
Cause the way you're soundin, you must think that it's a game
I can see if you came from the ghetto, but you came
From the Meadow -- you really need to let that go
You got no respect for hip-hop, and you tryin to rhyme
Biding your time and I find it a crime
I even tried to bury the hatchet man,cause we all African
You wanna be a rapper? Start practicin', you can't even flow right
Spend most of your time fuckin hoes, getting in fights
Hangin out, with no mission in life
And you're missing your life, and you'll be missing out on life
I won't sweat you for that G you stole
Cause if you're still alive, I'll be there to see you fold
Told ya!

Best to know what you're doin 'fore your life get ruined
Life is a thrill when your skill is developed
If you ain't got a skill or trade, then shut the hell up

You could be a rapper, an actor, a gun clapper
A comedian providing laughter, as a bachelor
A pastor of a chapter, a doctor, a lawyer
A fireman, a hired hand, whether boy or girl
It's your world. your future you control it
Whatever you do early on, is how you mold it
I record it, sold it, told it to you
Mr. Del wouldn't tell you nothin that ain't true, because

Happy Birthday,Flipsyde,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Happy birthday...
So make a wish

[Verse 1: The Piper]
Please accept my apologies, wonder what would have been
Would you have been a little angel, or an angel of sin
Tom-boy running around, hanging with all the guys
Or a little tough boy with beautiful brown eyes
I paid for the murder before they determined the sex
Choosing our life over your life meant your death
And you never got a chance to even open your eyes
Sometimes I wonder as a fetus if you fought for your life
Would you have been a little genius, in love with math
Would you have played in your school clothes and made me mad
Would you have been a little rapper like your poppa The Piper?
Would you have made me quit smoking by finding one of my lighters?
I wonder about your skin tone and shape of your nose
And the way you would have laughed and talked fast or slow
I think about it every year, so I picked up a pen
Happy birthday, I love you whoever you would have been
Happy birthday

What I thought was a dream
Make a wish
Was as real as it seemed
I made a mistake
What I thought was a dream
Make a wish
Was as real as it seemed
I made a mistake

[Verse 2: The Piper]
I got a million excuses, as to why you died
And other people got their own reasons for homicide
Who's to say it would have worked
And who's to say it wouldn't have
I was young and struggling, but old enough to be a dad
The fear of being my father has never disappeared
I ponder it frequently while I'm sipping on my beer
My vision of a family was artificial and fake
So when it came time to create I made a mistake
Now you got a little brother, maybe it's really you
Maybe you really forgave us knowing we was confused
Maybe, every time that he smile it's you proudly
Knowing that your father is doing the right thing now
I never tell a woman what to do with her body
But if she don't love children then we can't party
I think about it every year so I picked up a pen
Happy birthday, I love you whoever you would have been
Happy Birthday!

To the heavens again
From the ending to the ending

(‘cuse me, ‘cuse me)

[Hook]
I heard you got that good, ready for the take-off
Fire up that wood, let the jets blast off
To another World, right next to that white moon
Fly in the sky, tell em we’ll be back soon
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, its the martian and I come for all
I swear I will go head up with all y’all, bumper cars
Nigga I’m a slumber dog, millionaire, been there
Smoke some kush and snap my fingers in case you got cat lives
Uh, so much for being settled down
Suicide flow, go and kill ya self, Seven Pounds
Blunt thick as Bobby Christina, high as Serena’s skirt
Only smoking that real grass, no arena turf
Now can I live and if I can, I rep that dirty south
And you haven’t seen cleaner dirt, you haven’t seen it worse
So shut the fuck up and steam the purp
Tell them haters “arrivederc”
Yeah I lost my mind, help me find it I will lead the search
Uhhh

[Hook]
I heard you got that good, ready for the take-off
Fire up that wood, let the jets blast off
To another World, right next to that white moon
Fly in the sky, tell em we’ll be back soon"

Give me the cue

[Verse 1: U-God]
Skip the introduction proceed to lip function
The junction get rushed by some grimy people busting weed
Splatter your melon like some Attica felons
Use a firearm good, Bloods go for heart swelling
Insert the spasm, yes the dirty herb has him
Thoroughbred thugs insert the phantasm
Verbal smarts, spark the word, visit my scripture
Exotic wine, holding nine Picasso pictures
When the rhyme pivot you now, limit your chance
Bodyguard the lyric with unlimited stance
Words seem to zing on down to Beijing
When we touch down, would you crown renowned kings

[Verse 2: Method Man]
There's no honor amongst thieves
Street pharmaceutical stack like Genovese
The Four Devils tempt madmen but not these
We profound hardcore sound to MCs, thumbs down
Prepare Killa Bees it be warfare, this the year
Niggas gotta take you off of here, hold the square
If we go there we go gritty and spread fear
Through this rap city, call the mayor
My razor sharp darts be like cold stares
The smell of fear make my nostrils flair, truth or dare?
Ask yourself can you compare to these niggas in the hood
Johnny B. Goode or he be gone yeah
The struggle goes on, you've been warned
PLO from here to Lebanon, how many bombs
Must we drop in the Ninety-Now?
Walk a mile in my shoes, get the street news from Meth-Tical
[Break: RZA]
Glocks'll be spitting, you gots to be kidding
Aiyo kid you gots to be kidding
Or Glocks'll be spitting
You gots to be kidding yo

[Verse 3: RZA]
It's common sense how I master my circumference, you dense
I get locked the fuck up, released on my own recognizance
Can't be judged, young bloods bust back like scuds
Wu-Tang hovers one thousand notches above
MC level, yo, I stay highs like treble
Foes who oppose get plucked like rose petals
Arresting and holding, penetrate forbidden regions
Wack MCs only lasting one season
The morale was low at the corral
Adjective pronouns had no style, your weak proposal
Aim for the official, initial is Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah
All that other bullshit ain't permissible
Annual increase of the Wu-Tang Manual
Handles to keep all this Hip Hop shit tangible
Illegible, every egg ain't edible
My tracks remain 'Unforgettable' like Ol' Nat Cole
Got to catch this paper to buy Shaquasia a glacier
Buy Melchezidek a skyscraper
Understanding the continents of Africa and Asia
And free the Black Man from enslaved labor, Wu-Tang
[Verse 4: Masta Killa]
The weight of the fam is on our back and we can't fall
Victim to this long hall of fame, meaning nothing
We came to punish the glutton with a substance
That can't be contained, Wu-Tang

[Interlude 1: Method Man]
Motherfuckers
We be seeing y'all asses when we walk up in the club
Y'all all in the back
Scared to speak, we speak cause you scared
Punk motherfucker, we know what time it is

[Interlude 2: Raekwon]
All you been seeing is upsets in the boxing shit, right
It's like come on man
This nigga fucked up motherfucking Whitaker
Dang, he caught Whitaker
He caught Whitaker a long time ago
Mike got touched
Then Mike got touched by Holyfield
Hey Mike's, Mike's gonna forfeit this fight
He ain't fighting McDermit
He ain't fighting
Nope
Whattup
You talking bout he, what he, what he, what he did
Told them he cut his eye, in sparring
[Verse 5: Ghostface Killah]
Stella D'oro wrap breadsticks, David Berkowitz
Einstein birthed a hit, now nurture it
M.G.M. front row seat tonight, no gems
Purify, cleanse, ran into some beef up in the men's
Fix your sawed off, Wu-Tang tore me off the cross
All you saw was white meat, skin hanging off
These is words from the Arch Bishop, some call it six up
The Betty Crocker Marvel cake, snakes will miss a
Wax janitor, black Jack Mulligan from Canada
Slam dance, tarantula style, you's a fan of the
Monopoly king, Slavic poetry
Carnegie Hall's off the hook, let's push through the armory
Mack truck hitting soloist, Soul Controllers
Behold of the thousand teeth fist, swift and boneless

[Outro: RZA]
You know cause Wu-Tang is invincible, you know what I mean
It's Wu-Tang Forever God
You gonna get down with that W
That's that Wu, that's that Wisdom
That's the Wisdom of the Universe
That's the truth, of Allah, for the Nation of the Gods, you know what I'm sayin'
We breaking egg through these days God, you know what I'm sayin'
We got the fucking way
We got the medicine for your sickness
Out here, ya know what I mean
I was telling Shorty like
Yo Shorty, you don't even gotta go to summer school
Pick up the Wu-Tang double CD
And you'll get all the education you need this year, you know what I mean
Their poisoned minds can't comprehend this shit
Word man it's Wu-Tang Forever God, you know what I mean
Niggas can't fuck with these lyrics God, you kno what I'm sayin
Namean
Oh hell no, none of this shit
C'mon man -- beats, lyrics man, y'all niggas
Niggas can't even understand half this shit
I think niggas ain't gonna figure it out til the year Two-G
(Wax niggas ass for free or fee) Word
Yo, you know what
The next Wu-Tang album ain't even coming out until 2000, ya know what I mean
That's just gonna come back with a comet
You hear, we gonna bring a comet
Check for that shit in the millenium
You know what I mean? So, yo, y'all niggas man
Be the resurrection
The Gods is here man
Born Gods is here"
Clothes On A Mannequin,Joe Budden,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Talking]
Good Evening
{*clears throat*}
Ladies and gentlemen
I'd like to welcome everybody
Please take your seats, please be seated
We have a great show lined up for everybody tonight
Special guest in the house tonight
Joe Budden, J. Cardim
Let's...GO

[Chorus]
A wise man said we all wear a mask
At times keeping it on is too much of a task
Your face on the net, and your life's on blast
It might slip off, you gotta give me a pass
Sometimes I feel like a man again
But how they dress me don't make me the man I am
Nah the woes don't hamper him
They just looking at the clothes on a mannequin
[Verse 1]
Look, look, look, I want the best cars and the best flow
I want the best broads, that's how that go
I mean I want to be a star and collect dough
But even if I had it all it'd be just for show
I want the diamonds to make my neck glow
Lust for the next ho a love will never let go
I want to run along from my shortcomings
But I smoke so my breath gonna be short running
I want to be in control, hands on
If I'm the pilot then we will never land wrong
But I want to have faith, stayin' strong
Take the first step when I ain't got a leg to stand on
I got a lot to give but I want more
With numb thoughts, positive but I'm unsure
On the misplace, getaway and its disarray
And y'all don't know the man just what he put on display

[Chorus]
A wise man said we all wear a mask
At times keeping it on is too much of a task
Your face on the net, and your life's on blast
It might slip off, you gotta give me a pass
Sometimes I feel like a man again
But how they dress me don't make me the man I am
Nah the woes don't hamper him
They just looking at the clothes on a mannequin
[Verse 2]
I'm too annoyed to cope tryna make a living
Given I don't think that being a dope boy is dope
Out of every story, only 2 end in glory
Who am I to think I'm different than every hustler before me?
If I took my anger, became a gangbanger
I would aim to aim my anger at every stranger
Shorty wanna leave, honestly I can't blame her
Say the ones you love the most are always in the most danger
I talk a little slower so you have to hear
Dead man walking, no tatted tears
Or realest to ever do it, cavalier
Hundred thousand dollar car with rabbit ears
I don't welcome change even if it help 'em gain
Fuck a handout, I'd rather be self contained
L.V. everything, looking well arranged
Y'all would never know that I'm practicing self restraint

[Chorus]
A wise man said we all wear a mask
At times keeping it on is too much of a task
Your face on the net, and your life's on blast
It might slip off, you gotta give me a pass
Sometimes I feel like a man again
But how they dress me don't make me the man I am
Nah the woes don't hamper him
They just looking at the clothes on a mannequin
[Verse 3]
I been different, never mind I'm just indifferent
Ain't an old timer that would blame it on a skin pigment
Is it my imagination or a slim figment?
Origins ig'nant, probably why I'm indignant
Look at haters like, ""Why is it an issue?""
Is it because I'm sober but I'm on a high they can't get to?
God that was ridiculed fighting with his pride and his pitiful
Guide I was lied as a kid too
Cursing God out, ""Why he decide to pick dude?""
I big bulls but when I try it's abysmal
Die and keeping everything inside me a riddle
But they blinded by the condo size and its sick view
Whys, try and answer the whys
What good is having eyes when everything you look at you despise?
Or do you need ears when you don't believe anything you hear?
Maybe it's just something in the air

[Chorus]
A wise man said we all wear a mask
At times keeping it on is too much of a task
Your face on the net, and your life's on blast
It might slip off, you gotta give me a pass
Sometimes I feel like a man again
But how they dress me don't make me the man I am
Nah the woes don't hamper him
They just looking at the clothes on a mannequin"
Forgive Me,Joe Budden,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
[How many times have I hurt you?
How many times have you hurt me?
And how many times I've been on my knees
Begging begging please...
Forgive Me]

(Intro Joe Budden)
(Anybody who listens to Joe Budden
I never got off on image, actually
My image is not giving a fuck about image
My image is a regular, real live nigga
Who will always give it to you just the way it is
I'm never gonna fabricate, I'm never gonna lie
And I'm never gonna get outta character
Because the industry made me do so
Sooner or later you gotta take a step back
And really just look
At the situation, and analyze
Any really think about it
And you gotta say ""Is the risk worth the reward?""
Let's go)
[Verse 1]
Yo I'm only human, ain't to be worshiped (Nah)
I'm only human, I ain't perfect (Nah)
I might say some things and reword it
You could blame it on my roots, deep Jerz shit
Bet some things were never instilled
I might make threats I won't never fulfill (Why?)
Hoping you're smart enough to use some will
And do as I say out of fear that I will
They say time will reveal, but I'm jammed up
But I'm staring at the clock and the hands stuck
Ever so tender, it seems the things y'all never forget I never remember
Listen, it's your fault you assumed I grew
But if I'm all about me, then wheres there room for you?
Rather not rewind but fast forward
Forgiveness, all I can do is ask for it
Forgive me

[Hook]
[How many times have I hurt You? (have I hurt you?)
And how many times I've been on my knees?
Begging begging please...]

(Joe Budden)
(Uhh! I'm only human like y'all and shit
I ain't a robot, I ain't superhero
I'm entitled to shit like y'all niggas
Here we go, check me out, Talk to 'em, look)
[Verse 2]
Might say some things that's outlandish
But when I do, I'm thinking without standards
I apologize, take it as a letter
In spite of my actions just know I was raised better (much better)
I'm aware my opinions hated
So why the fuck am I so opinionated?
My bad Method Man, out of respect
I'mma scrap them 5 pages I wrote toward Deck
Cuz that ain't have anything to do with you
Till I made it have everything to do with you
Shutting up is unusual
So I'm back to letting my pen state
What I do to dudes (I mean)
Outside of music, outside of rapping
Cuz none of that should interfere with life happening
And you can look me dead in the eyes
If you don't know shit just
Know I took your advice, holla at me(Going Going Going Gone)

[Hook]
[How many times have I hurt you? (have I hurt you?)
And how many times I've been on my knees
Begging begging please...]

(Joe Budden)
(At least I listen though I'm open minded enough to
A nigga tell me something I'mma take heed to it
Only if its good shit though I be my own filter
It's that On Top Music
Think more niggas should be like that
Follow my lead, I left a trail for niggas, follow it)
[Verse 3]
Yo, y'all ain't looking at the man that you would see
Ain't looking at the man that you should see
Ain't looking at the man that I could be
Treat me like I'm new to the game, still a rookie
Like a newborn straight out the pussy
Or is everybody straight out and just pussies (faggots)
In a state of confusion, what I intended is never the conclusion
(talk to em!)
I'm losing, normally the one they accusing
Maybe that explains my seclusion
But when you grown to see that the stakes high
You at least know to never make the same mistake twice (look!)
They say the real is gone, I represent this shit
What you see is what you get, no representative
From now on get a redefined me
If ya see another mishap don't mind me
Forgive Me

[Hook]
[Forgive Me
How many times (have I hurt you?)
Forgive Me
How many times have you?
Forgive Me
How many times I've been on my knees
Begging begging please...]

I know I hurt a lot of niggas
Words are piercing
Sometimes them shits hurt like bullets
I wanna make amends
Not to everybody though
Some of y'all niggas I mean to offend
Fuck y'all!)"
It Wont Be Long,J. Cole,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
Uh, yeah
I said it won’t be long (no)
‘fore we out here baby
Gotta get you up out here baby
Said it won’t be long
‘fore we out here baby
We up out here baby

[J. Cole Verse 1]
I say a prayer and look up in the sky
Thank God even though a nigga headed to this tired day job
Will my eyes stay wide still I know I’m gonna blow
This is music for my niggas cause I know you want more
Cause that old shit fake but this new shit real
J. Cole not Jay but this that Blueprint feel
Hey Cole is you crazy that's some big boots to fill
Yeah straight out the Ville and the shoes fit well
Seen heaven, seen hell, seen niggas get killed
Knew every detail still never would tell
Scared of the repercussion, scared of them people bussin'
Bullets be hittin’ nigga’s you swear they could be percussion
Niggas be holding triggers before they could read instructions
Oh God, never did our fathers teach us nothing
No law, but became a man on my own
Showed my momma I could stand on my own
[Hook]

[J. Cole Verse 2]
Dear mama, your son hurting
Living in this cold World where niggas shun virgins
And praise hoes
As days go by shawty 19 years old
No clothes for her baby yet she stay so fly
Tell me why mamma do you cry
Is it cause you know my teacher be feeding me lies
Is it cause you know that Preacher is greedy inside
Cause racism is alive I see the disguise
Mamma I know it hurts
It hurts me to watch you go to work barely hanging on
Some rich man getting richer while you slaving for him
So whats the options for him
A young nigga from the hood without a pops at home
Surrounded by no good
And soon no good becomes so good quick
A little drug money got him feeling so hood rich
Killing your hood with the same shit Ronald Reagon filled up your hood with
And it’s still in your hood shit
I’m feeling no good mamma
I’m sick of my soul
Is there a better life for us I just sit and I hope
I just hope and I pray
It’ll change one day I’ll make a change one way
And mamma I can fly you out this cold world
This cold life, it’s all wrong
There’s no right
Its hard to see the good when there’s no light
Just grab onto me, trust me hold tight!

A Girl Named Hope,Atmosphere,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Slug]
She abandoned me, left me out in the cold
No surprises, I guess that's how it goes
Sits across from me, at a booth in this dive
I contemplate how much more I can survive
But I'm alive, so I should be content
Then tell why the hell my whole world is bent
I was sent to make and frustrate the population
In-between the alcohol and the copulation
What you call it, if you build it I will break it
""What's wrong, how you doin'?"" Nah, save it
Gave it a fraction of all I had to give
I guess I hold a grudge, cause you still got my rib
With your beautiful eyes, unscrupulous lies
Now watch the circus clown run around in circles and try
Seems like all I get to eat is hope
Girl, if we got along better we'd be dope

[Interlude]
Four walls, they surround me
Loneliness, has found me
[Verse 2: Slug]
And for as much as I complain, I'm lovin' it
And I only mention it so that I can rub it in
Wake up to the sunlight, shake off last night
Check what's left and try to get the rest right
Decision, splitting, headache, lifting
Symptoms, matching, Mama was afraid of it
Knowledge of self ain't as evil as they made it
Call it what you want, if you build it they will break it
The plain truth, there's no substitute
But sometimes she wears a disguise (Yes she do)
A storyteller deals with life not hope
Girl, if we got along better we'd be dope

[Outro: Slug]
And that's the sound that a dog will make when he's just been hit by a car
And that's the tone that hits close to home, when the cocaine outlives the star
And that's the noise that disrupts the boys when the cue ball smacks its goal
And these are the words that disturb your earth when I walk away with your hope
*whispers* Come on, let's go"
Sunshine,Atmosphere,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Ain't no way to explain or say
How painful the hangover was today
In front of the toilet, hands and knees
Trying to breathe in between the dry heaves
My baby made me some coffee
Afraid that if I drink some it's probably coming right back out me
Couple of advil, relax and chill
At a standstill with how bad I feel
I think I need to smell fresh air
So I stepped out the back door and fell down the stairs
The sunlight hit me dead in the eye
Like it's mad that I gave half the day to last night
My bad sight made me trip on my ass, right into that patch of grass like that's life
All of a sudden, I realize something
The weather is amazing, even the birds are bumpin
Stood up and took a look and a breath
And there's that bike that I forgot that I possessed
Never really seen exercise as friendly
But I think something's telling me to ride that 10 speed
The brakes are broken, it's alright
The tires got air and the chain seems tight
Hopped on and felt the summertime
It reminds me of one of them Musab lines like
[Hook]
Sunshine, sunshine, it's fine
I feel it in my skin, warming up my mind
Sometimes you gotta give in to win
I love the days when it shines, whoah let it shine
Sunshine, sunshine, it's fine
I feel it in my skin, warming up my mind
Sometimes you gotta give in to win
I love the days when it shines, whoah let it shine
Sunshine, sunshine, it's fine
I feel it in my skin, warming up my mind
Sometimes you gotta give in to win
I love the days when it shines, whoah let it shine
Sunshine, sunshine, it's fine
I feel it in my skin, warming up my mind
Sometimes you gotta give in to win
I love the days when it shines, whoah let it shine

[Verse 2]
If I could I would keep this feeling in a plastic jar
Bust it out whenever someone's actin hard
Settle down, barbeque in the backyard
The kids get treats and old folks get classic cars
Every day that gets to pass is a success
And every woman looks better in a sun dress
The sunshine's an excuse to shoot hoops, get juice
Show improve their moves and let loose
I hear voices, I see smiles to match em
Good times and you can feel it in the fashion
Even though the heat cooks up the action
The streets still got butterflies
Enough kids to catch 'em
Ridin my bike around these lakes man
Feelin like I finally figured out my escape plan
Take it all and the day started off all wrong
Somehow now that hangover is all gone
Ain't nothing like the sound of the leaves
When the breeze penetrates these southside trees
Leanin' up against one, watchin the vibe
Forgettin' all about the stress, thanking god I'm alive
It's so simple, I had to keep the song simple
When I get home I'm gonna open all the windows
Feelin' all right, stopped at a stop sign
A car pulled up, bumpin Fresh Prince's Summertime
Summer summers fine
Feel it in my skin, warming up my mind
Sometimes you gotta give in to win
I love the days when it shines, woah let it shine
Woah let it shine
Woah let it shine
Woah let it shine
Woah let it"
Summer song,Atmosphere,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Slug]
She came back to visit, she says
Cause in some ways, Minneapolis is more real than L.A
But I won't go to the triple-rock on a Tuesday
Too many people pop out of they pimples and play
And at night, we can watch these people in these bars
They're all insane, they all know my name
Who won the game? No one's in pain
But either way girl, I'm glad you came
And if the elements and irrelevance I strain
Hair's wet, who cares if it's sweat or rain
As long as it doesn't leave a permanent stain
It's all in vain if there's nothing left to gain
And something's in the way she looks at her prey
There's no way she'll allow you to live
Swallow the fight, inhale the night
There's not much else left for you to give
Who's leaving? (There she goes)
Who's leaving?
Who's breathing as opposed to who's bleeding
Caress the rooftop and stare at the space
For the flesh that you gave just to get a taste
It goes... nothing comes close
Scream of the smile and choke boy choke
Passion come death, and death bring power
At the top of the hour we sing for the monster
And here she goes, with that look in her eyes
The souls of those that got took by surprise
Crooked little smile that clings to her lips
On a night like this I sing for the bitch
[Chorus]
Just a lonely summer
Slowly dying
I was smiling hard
But I was lying

[Verse 2]
So what's the time? it's almost time for her to go to work
The sun is shining but I'm in the shadow of my smirk
I keep my breathin' under my breath
Tucked within the untrimmed bushes next to her front steps
And when she leaves to make treck towards the bus stop
My love erupts (POPS) a thousand tiny blood clots
Damn I wish that she was mine but time and time over the discretion
On my right shoulder whispers to my ear
Advising me to admire from way over here, play the rear
And struggle for the view to clear
It's been 2 years and quite a few beers
Too many loose tears and a few souvenirs
And if she only knew, how long I've waited for her
How her smiles enough to make my winter warmer
If she knew the way she walks could take away my storm
She'd probably call the cops and get a restraining order
As much as I hate myself, I hate you more
But I still smile when you come through that door
And as much as I hate my life, I hate yours too
Just can't seem to teach myself to ignore you
This is for the ladies, not every lady
Just the ones that drive me crazy, the ones that scream SAVE ME
I wanna thank y'all for everything you gave me
Now lean in and taste me (Kiss)
[Chorus]
Just a lonely summer
Slowly dyinng
I was smiling hard
But I was lying
Just a lonely summer
Slowly dyinng
I was smiling hard
But I was lying

Right up to your face and kiss you!"
You Make Me Wanna,Atmosphere,"['alternative', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","*Coughs* Rock the house

""You make me wanna die""

He said it like he meant it
Story over no more
Hopin to prevent it but

""You make me wanna live""
She said that with a straight face
And she placed keep sakes
Inside her suitcase

""Everything you say is a lie""
He said that with a smirk
Fully aware that it'll hurt
When it hits the nerve
""You've never heard a word I've said""

She responded
But he heard that
And remembered it forever like a promise
Now here we are, wearing hatred on our masks
Let's carry on, put all your eggs inside that basket

Swing it round, until that wooden handle snaps
Sort 'em all out and only keep the ones that cracked

""You make me wanna die""

That's why I trust you
That's so I can look you in the eye and say I love you

[Hook]
(Background voice chanting)
Set us free

[Woman]
I want to live
I want to die

I've never seen a sun decide to set so abrupt
As it does when the gun inside of you wakes up

Almost as if it's trying to hide from your tantrums
Head full of hurt, pride, a closet full of phantoms

Never seen the sun shine quite so loud
As it does when that little girl makes herself proud
Almost as if it wants to come play a part
In those moments when your heart ain't afraid of the dark

But sometimes I swear you make the sun confused
It wants to rise but it over-analyzes what to do

It cries more than you, when the storms come knockin
Tries to hide it's face, just avoid watchin

I would drive by and wave, but there ain't no parade
So I'mma stay and wait for the day the sun goes away

[Hook]
(Background voice chanting)
Set us free

[Woman]
I want to live
I want to die

What is it about women that brings out my venom
Thought it was a peach, it tasted like a lemon

I ate it anyway, can't help it's my natural
From one extreme to another, no room for practical
Just act casual maybe they won't notice
Or fall off the planet so you can escape the focus

Break the dirt; bury me down when I'm broken
Or let the under-current carry me out to the ocean

Can't swim as good as I could as a child
But as a kid, I never swam just stood there and smiled

Even though the idea of drownin in you
Seems kinda like it might be the wrong thing to do

You gotta take a look at you and I, the clown and the fool
Love can make suicide sound so cool

[Hook]

Set us free

[Woman]
I want to live
I want to die

Dying must be, dying must be, dying must be heaven
Cus living is hell

Let's watch the sun disappear into the water
Let's watch these people, and point at the imposters

Let's lay it on the line, let's travel across it
Let's live forever no matter what it costs us

Claustrophobic, lots of down talk
Toss clothes in and turn it off
Easily lost in moments

Forgot the motives, sun almost exploded
Lookin for proof, who would've knew, toy gun was loaded

Go ahead and throw it out into the waves
Say goodbye to yesterday and try to fly the stress away

Took it from the sky and looked it square in the eye
Silence, trying to read between the snore and the sigh

There's a reason that they say that they can't take it with 'em
If you're leavin cuz of love, it really isn't livin

I want to live I want to
Die motherfucker die"

And even that nigga ain't seeing me (Uh-uh)
My reflection have a hard time being me (Haha)
So the ""tryna do me"" shit, it's time to dead it (Dead)

I kill 'em with the shine—give these black diamonds credit
And my watch is sick, but I have no time for medics
Black ice in the Audemars—this is custom-order, bruh
First, I call a jeweler up; then, I call the coroner
My car is a foriegner, my bitch is from Florida
I killed the pussy last night, so, now, her man is mourning her (Yeah)
Good morning, sir—I good-night niggas
Y'all on Death Row: I Suge Knight niggas
Time to depart: I book flights, nigga
""What's up, son?"" What it look like, nigga?
Black dress, black suits, black shades, black boots
Black trucks, black coupes; guns blow—black flutes
Black card, black jewels, black party bag
Black Friday—throw it in a body bag
Black Barbie: That's what I call my Black broad (Yes)
African plug: That's what I call a black card (Yes)
Get your sharps, get your flats: that's the black keys (Keys)
Getting slick will get you holes in your black tees (Tees)
Black limos, black Town Cars, black hearses (Woo)
Black register books signed in black cursive (Yeah)
Black tears, white tissues out of black purses (Yeah)

Inherited Scars,Sage Francis,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
""I wanna show you something"" She said
As if I had built up enough trust in her
To the point where she could show me
The type of thing that she had to first
Introduce by saying she wanted to show it
Instead of just showing it like, ""Look""
And I'm like ""I don't feel like lookin'""
Like the uninterested type
So I say ""A'ight, show that shit.""
But a little more respect and reservation
It was my sister for Christ's sake
So I'm waiting for a follow-up line
There usually always is to statements like ""I want to show you something.""
It kind of runs in the same vein as statements like ""You can't tell anyone""
And then promises are made;
Secrets are kept

[Verse One]
I didn't tell anyone about what I seen or heard that day, mums the word still
I'm scared to plant ideas into your head while your rebellious side is fertile
Hurdles are getting knocked down
I'm running a losing race
Your legs aren't the only ones marked up, how many dreams have you chased?
If I could have said this to your face maybe you wouldn't have to write like I do
Except I use paper instead of my body now; it's something you might want to try too
From haikus to horror stories, it's something in our blood that we share
Something in our blood that appears on the surface of our skin when we bring it there
My facial expression said I didn't care
Hate and aggression must've made an impression on the little kid who stared
Sitting on stairs when I would bother to bring my skates
My feeble attempt at being a strong, big brother doing father figure 8's
Ripping my cape on the ground that it dragged on
Tripping on fate and hearing the sounds of a sad song
Listen, it's great sharing time now that dad's gone
But what's with the choice of words?
Or the body parts that you decided to tag them on?
I'm a vagabond who moved to modern day Babylon and then back again
With minimal contact and you know I can't ask your mom what's happening
You've got such beautiful gifts, what are you doing ruining the packaging?
How ironic come to think I probably put this ink on my back for him
I want you to laugh and sing more
But you dropped anchor in a place
Where dreams go to die and you're keeping your ass indoors
I'm asking for you to stick it out and see things through
You're asking for me to zip my mouth and keep it just between me and you
[Hook]
If I could have been there from the beginning if I could be there right now
If I could promise to be there when you need me, would it raise an eyebrow?
How would your body be different if I still dropped by for visits?
Is it my place to put a smile on your face?
Could I erase your body language telling you its all been said before?
Or change the words you wrote, exchanging your scars for my metaphors?
I'd add them to my collection while smiling
Next time you want to paint with razor blades and need a canvas use my skin

[Verse Two]
You're hiding your sins well, but I see the hell that your limbs speak
Tongue in cheek Lying awake in bed while other kids sleep
The strength of evil begins to keep your grins weak
No matter the length of the needle
Marking up one's body is so much more than skin deep
Feel the pin prick The grim reap what they sew and you're trained to say that you're fine
Your thresh hold for pain is greater than mine
So I'm waiting in the lines that you give me patiently
While you get cut in the lines that THEY make YOU wait in, in ways that they can't see
If there's a vacancy as far as room in your life goes
Say it to me Don't do it with a knife under your clothes
Because the anguish of hidden skin is letting my ghosts be shown
Plus the language its written in hits especially close to home
I'm most alone when I'm out of touch with the people who feel this type of pain
You might just aim for a day that its raining to strike a vein to take my name in
Changing your uniform and altering your mind set
Has your pointer finger decided if it was a fault of his or mine yet?I bet
I know the dialect It's nowhere I haven't been before
With skin that's sore Battle scars that rise from our inner war
Are decorative medals of honor that our father decided to pass through inheritance
And it is repetitive when the kids head in the direction of evidence
Proving the pain and hurt is relative
All this pain and hurt is relative

(repeat chorus)

[Outro]

(Young Sage Francis?) Stop that, or I'll cut your head off
(Francis's little sister?) Awwwwww!
(Young Sage Francis?) What? You're on the re-tape recorder now
(Francis's little sister?) What!?"
Salute The Dream,Papoose,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","This track is crazy man, salute to The Game
Aiyyo game that nigga you was tellin' me about from California
I'mma handle him in the flesh
Salute to Jim Jones, salute to Juelz Santana
Everybody who embraced me man, it take real

DJ Enuff, Sunny, Clue, Green Latern
I'mma this one for y'all man

The big homie met a lot rappers and artists who could sing
But he chose Papoose cause he had a (""dream"")
Now the name of my album is the Nacirema (""dream"")
Straight into rotation monopoly's the theme
I wrote Monopoly to show the people my mind's great
We gon rise like the crime rate
United States is not 52 states, I'mma tell you just why it ain't
It's 53 states if you count my mindstate
The mirror ain't show me 2005 face
I'm just gettin' started, I wrote these rhymes in 9-8
Straight tru is drugs that make me hateful
You don't understand what they put my mindstate through
I wanna smoke witch'ya lame crew
Cause sometimes when I blaze a L it make me wanna blaze you
Hennessy's an enemy when I drink it straight through
Probably shake you
I taste blood when I taste brew
Snakes prey on rats from the streets to the state zoo
That mean you a rat if you let a snake, snake you
Turn ya back and I'mma have to lace you
But don't call me a backstabber, I'll stab you in your face too
It just stopped raining, so the weather is kinda damp
We tryin' ta make a couple links, me and my camp
Police wanna rush us so they drive by and glance
Every fiend I've seen, I licked him like a stamp
Them other weight sellers givin' work in advance
But it's garbage so you gettin' jerked in advance
Now in the first you gotta reimburse grants
Say Pap comin', they murk in advance
They leave like a tree when I come, none of them herbs gotta chance
Cause they know I keep birds on me like a branch
They hatin' but we ride right up on ‘em like a ramp
They run like it's ants in they pants
These rappers always sayin' they the champ
Until you pull out the 4-4 and sit it on his chest like a lamp
Real gangbangers is what they is for life
Why they fake niggas switch they stripes
Yesterday you was a blood but you flip tonight
You like that shit that killed Superman, cause you a +krip-tonite,+
Road rage, niggas be gettin me that fanned
When drivers cut me off I wanna clap land
So nigga was drivin' that new cadillac grand
He cut me off then black fled
I pulled up on him with the screwface that nigga dropped his fat hand
Cause I +screw+ +drivers+ like +Phillips+ and +flathead+
I don't drop pills but the haze on me
You like an empty gas tank, you on E
Challenge me for some bread, you can't afford me
Get crossed out, you crossed me
Let's do it on +the Drama Hour+, but don't start yellin'
A lot of you yellow belly ass niggas is yellow like lemons
When I spit off ya melon
Slay gon say 1-800-223-9797
Lousy slouch, yeah by the thous we count
But my money long enough to buy route these out
Go get ya clout renounced
A drunk person speak with a sober mind, so why pounce an ouki out
Lot of people counted me out
So if you got your +Thug-A-Cation+ identification have ya ID's out
All these loud mouth rappers tryin' to drown me out
I hear him mumbling I doubt if he can knock me out
Listen if he doubt he doubt
Let him keep actin' like a boxer, I'mma knock his mouthpiece out
This is for all of y'all who don't wanna recognize real
You makin' me stronger because I exercise skills
The eyes never lie, the naked eye's real

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
Yo, the way I feel — sometimes it's too hard to sit still
Things are so passionate, times are so real
Sometimes I try and chill, mellow down, blowin' smoke
Smile on my face, but it's really no joke
You feel it in the street, the people breathe without hope
They goin' through the motion, they dimmin' down the focus
The focus get cleared then the light turn sharp
And the eyes go teary, the mind grow weary
I speak it so clearly, sometimes y'all don't hear me
I push it past the bass, know nations gotta feel me
I feel it in my bones, black, I'm so wide awake
That I'm hardly ever 'sleep, my flow forever deep
And it's volumes of scriptures when I breathe on a beat
My presence speak volumes before I say a word
I'm everywhere — penthouse, pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave, tall cathedral or a cell
Universal ghetto life — holla, black, you know it well
Quiet storm, vital form, pen pushed it right across
Mind is a vital force, high level right across
Soul is the lion's roar, voice is the siren
I swing 'round, ring out, and bring down the tyrant
Chop a small axe and knock a giant lopsided
The world is so dangerous, there's no need for fightin'
Suckas tryin' to hide like the struggle won't find 'em
Then the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind 'em
It's everywhere — penthouse, pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave, tall cathedral or a cell
Universal ghetto life — holla, black, you know it well

Sit and come relax, riddle of the mack
It's the patch, I'm a soldier in the middle of Iraq
Well, say, about noon-ish, comin' out the whip
And lookin at me curious, a young Iraqi kid
Carryin' laundry, ""What's wrong, G? Hungry?""
""No, gimme my oil or get [fuck] out my country""
And in Arabian barkin' other stuff (""Jihad!"")
'Til his moms come grab him and they walk off in a rush
Distrust, feelin' like I've pissed upon wound
I'm like, ""Surely hope that we can fix our differences soon!"" (Bye!)
Buyin' apples, I'm breakin' on, ""You take everythin'
Why not just take the damn food, black bastard?""
I don't understand it, on another planet?
15-months of this stuff, how I'm gonna manage?
And increasin' the sentiment

Realized trapped in this crap
Walk over, kicked one of my fabulous raps (""La-Di-Da-Di"")

To stay original when all these niggas trying to mime
All these Big Sean, Young Money stop punch lines
My execution is classic, I'm firing lines
Dedicated chicks, yeah I get the best love
I give them a chest rub, got 7 bitches just like S Club
Not provoked or enticed by any one tweet
But would still jump a nigga like 21 Street
Victory, not defeat, if we'd happen to meet
Off the top or written, I'd be shittin' on you kittens
Crittin' and never hittin'
Throat slittin' wit every sentence
Administerin' the penance
And let your girl witness
Getting a lot of bread, my nigga, I stack pita
Saiyan in this bitch, I’m the black Vegeta
Hopping obstacles, parkour like Peter
Daily meat eater
Carnivore, no PETA
I’m not spider-man, but I am a Marvel
A full grown adult, y'all niggas just larval

I got my own sound I don't sound like the rest
And even my attire and my choice of dress
And not long ago I don't spoke English
My point is police pull me over a lot
They wonder what kind of rap sheet I got
And sometimes I take a young girl out to eat
And hold the door open, ""Oh, you're so sweet!""
Of course my affection's super illustrated
And I like to give don't reciprocate it

Fat and frills, thrills and spills
Eat and sleep, hump and kill
Shop til you drop, work til you dead
Get all you can, then get in the wind
Outta my face on your knees
Sleep in the mansion, shut out the streets
Make that cake, whoop that trick
Lick my swagger suck my sick
Get high get low get stcky get rich
Get yo own show get down get quick
You slow you blow you broke your fix
Terror dome, home swag home
Terror dome, home swag home
Home swag home, home swag home

[Verse 3- Chali 2na]
There are some things pure while certain things blur
Dilute it with the lie and you believe when it occur
Falsified information got my people in the stir
We have to be in search of something equal to the cure
Straight out the door, I come to give you more
Lay the law keep it raw, when I speak it from the core
Get underneath your skin like especially with the claw
Conflicted with the rich cuz I kick it with the poor
I laugh in the face of adversity
Sound clashed with the bass cuz its natural to me
But if you pay attention to the past you will see
Not long ago you black they'd hang your ass from a tree
Certain things things change, while some stay the same
Some are recluse others are lovers of the game
I'm trying to walk the lane, the Sirat al-Mustaqim
Instead of doing things they keep you covered in the flame

Throw it at me, baby (Baby), I be the wishin' well (Yeah)
For real though, I know our shit's not perfect
We connected then need space, swear our love is written in cursive
Put that rock up on your finger (Finger), paper in your hands (Hands)
But you can't cut me out (Out), bitch, this ain't no game
[Chorus: Chris Brown, Big Sean]
I-I-Is you crazy? Did you lose it? (Boing, boing)
A-A-Are you stupid? Are you foolish? (You crazy)
Girl, I'm the only one like me on the planet
It don't take rocket science to understand it
You paper, scissors, rock my world, girl, am I the one you playin'? (Oh, oh)
You paper, scissors, rock my heart and throw it all away
You throw it away, throw it away, th-th-throw it away, throw it away
Paper, scissors, rock my heart and throw it all away"
Im A Flirt,R. Kelly,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[R. Kelly]
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a flirt

[Hook - R. Kelly]
Soon as I see her walk up in the club, I'm a flirt
Winking eyes at me when I roll up on them dubs, I'm a flirt
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low, I'm a flirt
And when she's with her man looking at me damn right, I'm a flirt
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me cuz, I'm a flirt
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat cuz, I'm a flirt
Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her
Then don't bring her around me because, I'm a flirt

[Verse 1 - R. Kelly]
Now swear to tell the truth and the whole truth
When it comes to hoes I be pimping like I supposed to
Rolling like I supposed to, shining like I supposed to
In the club fucking with honeys like I supposed to
I don't understand when a nigga bring his girlfriend to the club
Freaking all on the floor with his girlfriend in the club
And wonder why all these playas trying to holler at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom, nigga I'm gon' holler at her
A dog on the prowl when I'm walking through the mall
If I could man I would probably fuck with all of y'all
Yeah, yeah homie you say she your girlfriend
But when I step up to her I'mma be like cousin
Believe me man this is how them playas do it in the Chi
And plus we got them playerette flirters in the Chi
Now the moral of this story is cuff your bitch
Cuz hey, I'm black, handsome, I sing plus I'm rich
And I'm a flirt
[T.I. talking]
Hey homie if you ain't got no money
You better keep her away from me ya dig

[Verse 2 - T.I.]
Well if ya love ya girl and wanna keep ya girl
Don't be walkin' up and askin' me to meet ya girl
Because I'm well enough a flirt when I speak to ya girl
She winked her eyes on the sly, I seen cha girl
Better treat girl right cuz another man will
Better eat eat ya girl like another man will
Cuz you leave ya wife and I see ya wife
Now be for real, how long ya think that's fixin' to be ya wife
Well I'm livin' the life, you just gettin' it right
Ya old lady look at me cuz you ain't hittin' it right
She probably used to like you cuz you the business type
That's till I came along and put some dick in her life
Wanna see how that ass lookin' thick in the light
I noticed she was checkin' me and diggin' the ice
And if I get that tonight bet I hit that twice
I can even make her mine if I hit that right
You know, smack that thang, sit that right
Up on that dress, see yeah that's right
Pullin' on her hair like we gettin' in a fight
Yeah, I know it's kind of tight but it'll sweat just right
So if ya girl sexy and she test me
Don't be upset G cuz you might catch me
Tryin' to catch a glance up her skirt, put my plan in reverse
If I see her and I like her then I'm a flirt
[Verse 3 - T-Pain]
When I, when I, when I
When I pull up to club all the shorties be like, damn twenty-eights
Then I be like girl you know just who I am, don't hate
See I done fell in love with a stripper y'all
All I do is flirt with her and I get them draws
And I don't need no help, I got it down pact
Teddy Pain was born to flirt now you can't down that
Now I'mma flirt with her whether I'm in or out of town
That's why they call me Teddy Bend-Er-Ass Down
I be like como se llamo, lil' mama me llamo Pain
What is your name
I'm feeling your vibe and I'm hoping you feel the same
I'mma wink my eye and let you know I got the game
When I pass by I know exactly what you say
He's so fly, yes he's so cool
Hey shorty, hey shorty what it do
He mad cuz I'm looking but I already fucked her
I got these niggas mad cuz I'm a flirt

[Hook - R. Kelly]

[Verse 4 - R. Kelly]
Oh, it's the remix
Now if you walk in up in the club with a bad chick
And if she lookin' at me then I'm gon' hit
Man jackin' for chicks, I tried to quit it
But I'm a playa homie so I had to hit it
While you buying her drinks in the club
Acting like you in love
Stunting like you all thug
We was switching numbers
She looking at you and I walk by
You turn your head, she wink her eye
I can't help it if she checking for a platinum type of guy
She be calling my daddy and I be calling her mommy
She be calling you Kelly, when your name is Tommy
I don't know what y'all be thinking when you bring 'em around me
Let me remind you that I am the king of R&B
Do you know what that means
That means if you love your chick don't bring her to the V.I.P
Cuz I might leave with your chick
Just keeping it real my nigga, it's a playa's field my nigga
Don't take no bitch to the club when you just met her my nigga
Cuz I'mma flirt with her, right
He gon' flirt with her, right
And if she lickin' that good shit
She gon' flirt with her
I'm a flirt

Stir of Echoes,J-Live,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Ayo, the hotter the summer, the cooler the fall
The lesser you stress her, the quicker she call
Now whether you short, or whether she tall
The later you bust, the louder she bawl
Now that was for them, this is for y'all
The more for the little store, the less for the mall
The smarter your plan, the better for all
You fail in the plan, you plannin' to fall
United we stand, divided we fall
The quicker they come, the harder they fall
You straddle the fence, pickin' a brawl
You loved by none, hated by all
See eloquent words, never the wise
Keeping it simple, teaching it real
Live by the sword, die by the sword
Swinging for justice, fuck how you feel
Rappers with deals, tuck in they shines
Fuck the chains, I'm talkin' 'bout rhymes
Maybe they got 'em and maybe they don't
Maybe they spit 'em and maybe they won't
Nevertheless, fuckin' with mine
Never the best, better with time
Movin' the body, sparkin' the mind
Keepin' the real heads pressin' rewind

I feel good! Ahoooooooo! About Hip-Hop! (x4)
I feel good!

[Verse 2]
Ayo, you feelin' the song, you happy it's yours
You diggin' the cadence, you heard it before
You know it's been freaked by many emcees
Maybe ya Kool Keith or maybe it's Breeze
Maybe ya Flava Flav or maybe it's Meli Mel
Or Maybe it's Run or maybe it's L.L
I'm makin' it mine, ya dissin' it fine
Don't take it too personal, it's only a rhyme
A minute has passed, a sucker was born
One minute you're here, next minute you're gone
If you can predict the shit I'mma say
Initial my name, you know that it's justice
I saw your mistake, don't take it too far
Take kindness for weakness, the man for a star
With either extreme, you're mentally dead
Take heed to the words, J-Live has just spoken
Ya did it again, you thought I was jokin'
You tryin' to fix, but you know it is broken
You need to sit back, nod your head to the track
And check out the lyrics so you can react
Like this!

[Hook]

[Interlude - Woman Speaking]
Okay, just relax, get very comfortable
Relax, trust me, close your eyes, now just listen for a moment
Listen to the sounds of the room around you
Remember that you are in a studio, a recording studio
With your name on one mat
You're in the mic booth, you look around
It's one huge empty mic booth
You notice that the walls are painted in black
The mic is black, the windows tinted black
And all you can see is a very old computer screen
Five letters flashing on and off
You can barely see what the letters spell
You lean closer to the screen, the letters become clearer
And the word is RHYME

[Verse 3]
Ayo I'm trapped in the mind of a mad man literally
It's not a metaphor kid, pay attention
Reporting to you live from this first dimension
In the real crowded room, I just want some attention
It's pitch black then bright, like high beams at night
The silence of the noise is deafenin' to hear
My life long mission is to jock for position
But I can't tell if I'm in the front or the rear
Formless I don't know if I'm a circle or square
Let alone solid, liquid, or air
I'm completing myself
But can't confirm or deny if I'm actually here
That's quite a fucked-up predicament, yeah
I fell at home but I gotta escape
This paradox in a box, I'm intent to solve this mystery
I'm made up of dreams and nightmares
Soliloquies, dialogues, arguments
Fantasies, memories, imagery, symmetry, alcohol, history
Love, life, death, joy, remorse and sympathy
Actions, wishes, reactin' and hopin'
But everytime the beat comes on the door opens
The out-of-our-body experience is showing me
Jettin' from the exit, the entrance, the outlet
I'm traveling through veins, blood vessels and muscle tissue
Till it goes pitch black, and I still don't know if I'm out yet
I wake up from the blackout, finish with the race
Confined in a two-dimensional blank space
Looking back on my original birth place
Now taking the shape of a young black face
Parts of my physical rerased and replaced
What was sight and sound is now feel and taste
I **tal a fruit punch laced with toothpaste
I'm shot from a cannon with amazing grace
My identity revealed with the mystery solved
I see my purpose in life as I travel through time
Ridin' the beat through audio wires recording and air
Waves ear and minds, I'm a J-Live rhyme"

In the beginning things was cool
Been together since school
I got played in the end
Had me looking like a fool
Thought she would be the one
Different from all the others
What we shared was more than a pun
Told me not to trust this shit
I was young, I was dumb, I should've paid attention
And I guess this is what I deserve for not listening
Imagined you being my wife
Don’t understand how you can say you love me
When you stabbed me in my back twice
You supposed to hold me down for life
Wasted time to argue with you
When you’re wrong and I’m right
Girl, you trite
So pack your bags, you can leave
Cause what the nigga need is a girl care for me

Messed with my emotions

Fell in love with the limelight
Always gon' catch up her later
Now she at the club hanging out, where all the ball players
(Huh?)Gucci, Louis, Fendi, all she wants is the finer things
Rolfs, Benzes, attracted to what money brings
Love is blind, didn’t see her plottin’ on my figures
Threaten me that if I left her, she would Tiger Woods a nigga

Artificial amateurs aren't at all amazing
Analytically, I assault, animate things
Broken barriers bounded by the bomb beat
Buildings are broken, basically I'm bombarding
Casually create catastrophes, casualties
Canceling cats, got their canopies collapsing
Detonate a dime of dank daily doin' dough
Demonstrations, Don Dada on the down low
Eating other editors with each and every energetic
Epileptic episode, elevated etiquette
Furious, fat, fabulous, fantastic
Flurries of funk felt, feeding the fanatics
Gift got great, global goods gone glorious
Gettin' godly in his game with the goriest
Hit 'em high, hella hype, historical
Hey holocaust hymns
Hear 'em holler at your homeboy
Imitators idolize, I intimidate
In an instant, I'll rise in an irate state
Juiced on my jams like Jheri curls jocking joints
Justly, it's just me, writing my journals
Kindly I'm kindling all kinds of ink on
Karate kick-type Brits in my kingdom
Let me live a long life, lyrically lessons is
Learned lame louses just lose to my livery
My mind makes marvelous moves, masses
Marvel and move, many mock what I've mastered
Niggas nap knowing I'm nice, naturally
Knack, never lack, make noise nationally
Operation, opposition, off, not optional
Out of sight, out of mind, wide beaming opticals
Perfected poem, powerful punchlines
Pummeling petty powder puffs in my prime
Quite quaint quotes keep quiet, it's Quannum
Quarrelers ain't got a quarter of what we got-uh
Really raw raps, risin' up rapidly
Riding the rushing radioactivity
Super scientifical sound search sought
Silencing super fire saps that are soft
Tales ten times talented, too tough
Take that, challengers, get a tune up
Universal, unique, untouched
Unadulterated, the raw uncut
Verb vice lord victorious valid
Violate vibes that are vain make 'em vanish
Why in my world would a wise wordsmith just
Weaving up words, weeded up on my workshift
Xerox my X-radiation holes extra large
X-height letters and xylophone tones
Yellow-back, yak mouth, young ones' yaws
Yesterday's lawn yardsale, I yawn
Zig-Zag zombies, zooming to the zenith
Zero in, Zen thoughts, overzealous rhyme

Mashing on the gas bypassing all the has-beens
In that sense I'm that shit in that scents
Inhale it, breathe it, embrace it
Crepes is not as flat as you natives of fake is
So I take this and shine and provide illumination
But niggas stay in the dark and I'm startin' to get impatient
15 is the age of the teenager
Roamin' with a mind full of gold, no pager
A circle of squares is what shaped us
Until it's sussed, feel free to hate us

Throw 'em on a playlist labeled as the greatest
Unleaded premium, large not medium
Say cheese, bitches bodies seize upon meeting us, man

This is what I do, I infect hope
And inspire folk by painting pictures with the better view
My soul is weatherproof, my mind can shapeshift
Divine greatness runs in bloodlines still ancient
Expansive universes embedded in ours
Reflected in stars, I shine with the breath in my heart
That's why my flows complete, it's flawed
Get raw energy, exposed for the whole globe to see
Yeah you know it's me, I'm back at it again
Elevating the bar, haters will never get in
This is a sacred place, where we embrace creation
Through landscape, shape and painted in a vacant space

I dominate, y'all denominate fractions
I relapse back to spittin' crack like chapped lips
Chasin' pavements 'til the day of amazin' payment
Success is the fragrance on my Bathin' Ape apron
Pull your face up out your anus and face this
Darth invade your playlist, you cannot evade this
Closed case, you're makeshift, I make hits
You make shit, you crave this, this greatness
You can't attain us like bad grades for Asians
I'm grade-A list, lick the speaker, you could taste it"
Pants on Fire,Buck 65,"['hip hop', 'pop', 'r&b', 'jazz', 'alternative']","[Verse 1: Buck 65]
Sky diver, your pants are on fire, and the rest of your clothes is glowin'
And for some strange reason, your nose is growin'
My skin is crawlin'
Everybody's chin is fallin'
Jaws are droppin' left and right
Lost cause, you came like a thief in the night
With nice white teeth and a tight ass
And long conversation
Fascinating feeling to spend months in your company
I never felt uncomfortable
Even with my clothes off
Chillin' so hard my ass almost froze off
Everybody shows off and wants to look presentable
But the fact of the matter is that
Accidents are preventable
From the sound of the candy wrappers
Down to the handicappers
Everybody's got to exercise a little caution
But every so often expect things to get hectic or
Technically difficult and I begin to get skeptical
Especially when the Canadian bacon gets sizzlin'
Isn't it a sin when the ceiling is invisible
We need new inventions
That reveal peoples' true intentions
A portable pride protector
Affordable lie detector
The wild lifestyle has the tendency to intimidate
But it isn't your invitation to imitate
In front of my face
You spoke my gospel like an apostle
But on the other side of town, you got coke in your nostril
Just for example, we all wanna live a bit
Whatever, it's your body of water
Why should I give a shit
[Hook]
Who are you anyway, and where did you come from
Dumdum, just when I thought I could trust someone
The mask comes off, and your face fades away
And you radiate eighty-eight full shades of gray [x2]

[Verse 2: Buck 65]
Black and white rainbow, you know you ain't actin' right
Game show hostess, stabbin' every back in sight
The time has come to thicken the blood
And make no mistake, I'm a stick in the mud
I'm a kick in your pants and I'm a lump in your throat
And I'm the hassle in your castle, I'mma jump in your moat
Splash, hypocritical
Condition the hospital
Makes this mission impossible, pretty much
I've got no patients left and as a physician or doctor
It puts me in an awkward position
No magician can trick me, or lick me with a cattle whip
So what makes you think that you can sink my battleship?
Nah, we ain't family, drama queen, the camera's rollin'
Show me your swollen mammaries before the moment's stolen
Slow-motion Picasso
Wearing the wool socks
And coming with the full clip
I'm sick of this bullshit
[Hook]
Who are you anyway, and where did you come from
Dumdum, just when I thought I could trust someone
The mask comes off, and your face fades away
And you radiate, eighty-eight, full shades of gray [x2]

[Outro]
""I don't need anybody. Did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said this time? You wanna know the truth? I could have had any girl I wanted in school. Any girl I wanted. You know why I didn't have a girlfriend? Huh? Because there was nobody that I liked. Nobody that I liked. That's the truth. I could have had anybody. There was nobody that I liked, because girls stink. They stink. They're evil. And they're all bad, all of them. They're backstabbers. Like you."""

Hey, walk out of the house with my swagger
Hop in, there we go, I got places to go
People to see, time is precious
I look at my Cartier, outta control
Just like my mind where I'm goin'
No women, no shorties, no nothin' but clothes
No stoppin' now, my Pirellis on roll
I like my jewelry that's always on gold
I know the storm is comin'
My pockets keep tellin' me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies
It’s on and poppin tonight cause it’s meant to be ours
We keep a fadeaway shot
Cause we be ballin', it's platinum Patron that be ours

My paper planes making her dance
Get dirty all night, that's part of my plan
We building castles that's made out of sand
She's amazing, her fire blazing, hotter than cajun
Girl won't you move a lil' closer?
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage
That body belongs on a poster
I'm in a daze, that bottom is waving at me, like dammit I know ya
Doing a show like a gun out of holster
Tell me whatever then I'll be your chauffeur ('Cause)

A page for a symphony

Lighters ain't on this degree
My Shining will never stop
Fuck runnin' from every cop
Wait 'til the sun goes down
And have a showdown out in Salem's Lot
Still workin' the Night Shift, I am the Doorway
Golf clubs for violence, this a different kinda foreplay
Sometimes they come back, sometimes they don't
And sometimes I give a fuck, but most times I won't
And I think sometimes I'm made to sin
Beat them 'til the broom is bent
Take a trip and add it to the bodies out in Chamberlain

Rifles on my back like I'm some fuckin' kinda soldier bro

Nowhere, nowhere
Still lack no fear
No heart in my chest, 'cause I was born without
No heart in her chest, 'cause I took that shit out
And they can't find girl two
They said that she was lost
And they can't find me 'cause I'm duckin' the law
And still fuckin' them all
And never lovin' these broads
And never cuffin' unless I'm cuffin' them in a morgue
Say I'm twisted and demented, but murder can fascinate

When he's at his highest, but I'm different, midnight is when I shine
My brightest, so the difference is, if you're tryna see me then you
Better get your timin' right, we observe differently
Ain't got the same eyesight, only thing she sees is that my green
Goin' shine bright, she just wants the limelight
Yeah the type that I get every time I rhyme, right?
You're gon' regret it lookin' back like hindsight
You change clothes so much you forgot who you are, right?
You're gon' feel bad every time I'm here
And hang your head in shame ever time I'm near, yeah
You're gon' wanna clench your fist I swear
Because you ain't seein' nothin' like this
I swear we could have made it, no if's, no maybe's
You was actin' shady, and they're sayin' that I'm crazy?

They're sayin' that I'm crazy, they tell me that I'm crazy

What, so I never shared when they was down on their luck
Because I ain't get no handouts, I ain't run my damn mouth
This is where we move from fittin' in to standin' out
Because my team Odd so you don't want no problems
And even if you do then I guess we gotta solve them
No I never gave a fuck, no you can't depend on luck
And know that when you're feelin' down there's nowhere to go but up
Shucks, I'm losin' my mind can't you tell?
And I'm done messin' with y'all if I can tell that you ain't real
Nothin' to do but write them rhymes, came with thousands like it's wholesale
They wasn't helpin' I lost about a thousand in them hotels
So hell, I'll stack about a mil before I give
And I'm tired of dealin' with life but I can get it how I live

And these little niggas ain't got books in their book bags
Your next neighborhood killer might be who you look past
Get it right before you get left
And sent to the upper room cause your ass couldn't calm down
Rewind me back and you notice I'm trying to warn you
Before your collarbone be what hollows are getting torn through
Play gangasta tonight and you won't see the morn' dew
And the whole next month would be something mother mourn through
God forgive me I know Thou shalt not kill
But id rather him than Millz so if I gotta I will

Don't underestimate the power of a fiend

In the ghetto, it's insanity, I can't breathe

Not yet a drug dealer, but I watched 'em closely

Far too inhibited for gun smoke, I broke his jaw
Words harder than a fuckin' diamond

Niggas trippin' homey, when we ridin'?
Fuck them slowly like Jodeci
And stick a needle in my eye if I don't live and die for M.O.B
And fuck your homeboys nigga we can drop the guns
I hit your block and we can box for fun
Nigga one on one, last to fall is a ballin' cat
It's Death Row, why the fuck you think we call it that?
So if you knew me in my past life
Don't act like we homeboys, ain't no love in the fast life

I think it's simple enough, think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try
No matter how much you make an effort
You niggas can never ever really fuck with me
‘Cause I'll hurt you, and I will learn you a thing or two
And I'll hurt you, and I'll finish your career for you, I'll–

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Shit on a mic and doodoo
My doo-doo, you do not have a fightin' chance to move
You were covered in my poo-poo
Smothered in my manure while I spit saliva fluid do-do-do-do-do-do g-g-g-goobers are glued to you
You don't have a clue as to what we're about to do, do you?
So just sit back and watch somethin', you just gon' have an a-chew
You just made me sneeze, I'm allergic to beats like these
Please excuse me, my allergies are actin' up; thanks a lot, Scott
You're probably wonderin' why there's thunder
And everyone is runnin' and duckin' up
Under everything up on the block
‘Cause Busta Bus and Flipmode just tip toed into the club
Then with Shady quietly trying not to start up a riot with Doc
But since we all been spotted, we might as well have a party
So gather 'round everybody, come on, let's get our drink on
And you ain't got to do nothin' special for this occasion
Just reach in the closet, put something on, and get to the club
[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
Now if you ain't blind
And you ain't handicapped in your vision
I think it's simple enough, think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try
No matter how much you make an effort
You niggas can never ever really fuck with me
‘Cause I'll hurt you, and I will learn you a thing or two
And I'll hurt you, and I'll finish your career for you, I'll–

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Catch you niggas and snatch you niggas
You bunch of bumblin' fools
Who got me rumblin' dudes all the way down the block
Keep on stumblin' and jumblin' over their words and vowels
Throw in the towel, see you niggas is on the clock
And you runnin' out of time, see, I'm tired of all y'all
M-M-M-Mumblin, m-m-mumblin', n-n-nigga, I got it locked
Every single time you put my shit in your CD player
And turn up the volume
You bang your head, because your shit is not
I continue with crumblin' niggas and tumblin' niggas
You struggle while I humble a nigga with the Glock
Then I watch you while I'll keep on fumblin'
While I got you tr-tr-tremblin'
Before one of my niggas bust your head with a rock
Before I start to do another thing
Then to make you crown me the king
With such a butter swing, nigga, follow the flock
Now watch my brother bring all my diamonds to summer bling
While I'm climbing and fuck her
Then tell you bitch to get off my yacht
[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
Now if you ain't blind
And you ain't handicapped in your vision
I think it's simple enough, think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try
No matter how much you make an effort
You niggas can never ever really fuck with me
‘Cause I'll hurt you, and I will learn you a thing or two
And I'll hurt you, and I'll finish your career for you, I'll–"

That's that joint (You know that ain't doin it again)
Uh, do it! Do it!

[Verse 1: Rampage]
I'm a Natural Born Killa that's Born to Rise
Flipmode is da Squad so it's no surprise
Niggas want to advertise about how we get down
You fuck around: leave your body in the lost and found
How you like me now?
We got the industry on lock
The world is on shock
I'm a take a piece of the rock
Yo, you feel it in the heart when we took you to the park
Midnight after dark, I'm the raider of the lost ark (ark echo's)

[Verse 2: Serious]
Now na na na na na na, na na nah
Super size, super size, right before your eyes
I bring in treats like giant sweet potato pies
Wise, sword shift and I spit on flies
Killing all the tips from studio spies
Head to bed, beddie bye, beddie bye
Don't ask why. Why? What do you ask as a reply?
Flipmode's the Squad don't rest, don't try
Peace to my people in the friendly sky
Peace to my outer space ties
[Verse 3: Spliff Star]
I'm in leather like the ladies
Bigger than crack in the 80's {​​​*echoes*}​​​
Drive the buggy I Mercedes
Blow up like C-4
Got so much to live for
Can't play the game no more
Pick up the cain no more
Brothers ain't the same no more
Try to sweat me, what am I aiming for
Get yourself caught up
Faggot ass tore up
In the worst way, the only way you can stop me
Is cock your Glock and shot me
Drop me, pop me, make sure you that you got me
Cause anyhow I live I'm comin back for you poppy

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
What y'all niggas wanna do?

[Verse 4: Baby Sham]
Push up in the hot rod, alley cats a rah rah
All my flipmode in the backseats with chrome nines
I'm here to bust mine
Nigga fragile let his brain fry
Pretty boy sliced up feel the contact from this red eye
You failed to realize when you macks me you drop the plastic
Run up in your crib and snatch the heemis from the mattress
My crew expanded, QB is where we landed
Yellow strip you crossed it
Now I'm forcing you to drink this Sham's potion
Show me were loaded
The desert eagle hear it cockin'
Lovin my doggies
While we shinin' continue flossin

[Break: Busta Rhymes & (Lord Have Mercy)]
(Flipmode, Flipmode) Killa kids
Flipmode we are, 'mode we are..

[Verse 5: Rah Digga]
Fuck steppin on toes I crush the whole shoe
Pronto like Cru till I'm Triumphant like Wu
The shit you talkin crazy like niggas turnin in their hand guns
I be burnin MC's like Betty's grandson
Smokin grey poupon boy
Two lines, I chew rhymes and make niggas fold like they was futons
Rah Digga, all day Outsidaz, this Squad be Flipmode
We get our dick rode a whole shitload

[Verse 6: Lord Have Mercy]
We the official g-u-rilla to lead militias
That pillage, americana
Spit sentences like, venomous iguanas
Reminisce the promise
Bring drama like Nicaragua
Fatigues march, army leaders, they count crooked drug dollars
And sip fresh squeezed milk from the titties of llamas
Leave cities in carnage
Pretty as farmers that pour whiskey at harvest and hold 16 bananas
Maintain, maintain, maintain
I reign like Mussolini's iron fists
Try on this, you can't see me like vagina lips
Smugglin diamond chips, bubblin anonymous
The dominant will resource and count on script crews and world wars

[Verse 7: Busta Rhymes]
Yo, you better practice what you preach
I got 7 MC's at 10 G's a show each
Never interfere and shit, souvenirs for your ears and shit
Clear poetry like William Shakespeare and shit
Word is bond checkin me out
Hey what you talkin about
You lost and you walkin about
Niggas got beef they really want to chill and start talkin it out
Hey, oh my god, y'all nigga be buggin me out
Wish they could lay me down and have the police start chalkin me out
Now I zoom in on you and my niggas start stalkin you out
Shut down on bullshit you total recallin' about
This one's for my people and my niggas up North
The rulership dynasty of Flipmode finally come forth
Exports and imports hittin you with flavors of all sorts
My squad comin through, chop off your ear

Runnin' through the moment as the sun goes down
And all I ever wanted was to hear that sound
I stunt hard, I make it work, yeah
I make it work, yeah, I make it work, who
I live large, I make it work, yeah
I make it work, yeah

[Verse 1]
Childish Gambino, lame niggas never heard of it
Sick Boi is the crew, fuck these niggas with a dirty dick
When these mothafuckas gonna understand I’m serious?
I’m hard in the paint like I fuck her on her period
James Dean swag, leather jacket, white t-shirt
Rolled up sleeves, nigga lookin’ like a greaser
Word is born, baby my dictionary’s in labor
Listen to the Culdesac and know that was an ultimatum man
Why nobody wanna admit they like me just a little bit?
Won’t be on the freshmen list, guess I’ll just keep spittin’ shit
Never be the rapper with six hundred dollar shades
No iced-out chain, Rod Lavers all day
I was hopin’ they would see me just for me, dope rhymer
They do me like my first house, no co-signer
See you usin’ qualifiers, you don’t even know
“I guess he good for a rapper who on a TV show”
Even though, I was rappin’ back when Lance had chemo, ho
Even flow, Pearl Jammin’ niggas can’t leave me alone
I keep a bone for these girls who liked me back when green was low
Feel me, though, DVR my thoughts and make your TiVo grow
[Hook]
Runnin’ through the moment as the sun goes down (Starlight, starlight)
And all I ever wanted was to hear that sound (All night, all night)
But it’s all for you to prove it, keep on movin’, keep on usin’
My shine, my shine, my shine
Ooh, take me higher

[Verse 2]
Gambeezy make it work somethin’, let me check the syntax
Don’t add an eezy to my name, ’cause it has never been that
Aladdin on you fuckers, prince of the game from street rat
Dudes fall off, too steep like tea bags
Steady movin’, don’t worry about where I’mma be
Cause I’mma be on these tracks like indie girls on Amelie
Honesty, I’m rappin’ ’bout everything I go through
Everything I’m sayin’, I’m super sayin’ like Goku
Fuck nerdcore, fuck backpack
Fuck rap cool, I make cool rap
I make music for wack blacks to blast back
In fact, I swear the track I lie on’s my last track

[Hook]
Running through the moment as the sun goes down (Starlight, starlight)
And all I ever wanted was to hear that sound (All night, all night)
But it’s all for you to prove it, keep on movin’, keep on usin’

Ooh, take me higher
Running through the moment as the sun goes down (Starlight, starlight)

Words I Never Said Freestyle,XV,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[XV - Verse 1]
Yeah, they tell you “never say never”, cause forever’s a fact
They tell you, never say nigga to a dude who ain't black
But if the connotations change to a nigga being my man
Than why can’t I just call a dude who is just that?
And I never said “Dad”, NO, never said those words
Never felt he earned um, never felt he deserved
Never been scurred so I never said scared
I only speak truth so I never said “dare”
Never said “No”. Always said “yeah”
My niggas kept toast but they never said “cheers”
Never said “different” Never said “weird”
Cause I hated being called that
Than they said “square” and I caught that
Never said “give up” dog, I fought back
Never said “quit, couldn’t, won’t” and all that
Never said “lend me” Never said “Give me”
I never said “remember” cause you never could forget me
To all the girls I’ve hurt and never said “forgive me”, Forgive me!
Never said “game”, never said “pimpin”
Never said “I do”, unless I promise I will
So I’ve never been married, not scary thats just my deal
Never said “hate” cause love is all that I feel
Always been authentic so never felt to say “I’m real”
Never told my OG “N-O”, no!
No matter what it is, I got ‘em to the end yo
Never said fan I’ve only said fam?
Never said I’ll sit down, never said I ran
Always say “go for it” and never said “stop it” if my momma need anything I never said I don’t got it
[Hook - x2]
These are words I never said, said, said, said
These are words I never said, said, said, said
Nah, I don’t speak ‘em
And I don’t try to teach ‘em
People try to say ‘em
But I just don’t believe ‘em

[XV - Verse 2]
“Bitch, ass, snitch, pussy, fake fuck”
Never say that round my hood unless you tryna lace up
Never said “bum”, while people losing jobs, pay cuts
Never said “crackhead”, just a lost soul that blaze up
Never said “surrender”, never gave information
Never raise my right hand, never entered the station
Never said “freeze”, never said “halt”
Cause we never played cops on the block that I was taught
Never said “end a life”, never said “in your life”
We say walk out on death and then we enter life
Never said fame was worth it, I just said get a price
Never said “Loser”, lasers because we give ‘em light
Never said “I’m the best”, always room of improvement
Never said I was next, just one of the ones to do it
“Sell out faggot won’t make it and hope that nigga dead”
Don’t believe, I wish it, I promise these are words I never said
[Hook - x2]

Yeah, shouts out to Lupe Fiasco, Lasers in stores now
Vizzy, year of the Squarians!"
Lights Turned On,Childish Gambino,"['dance', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Small chick with a fat ass
Did I say that out loud? Let me back track
I know my game ain’t that bad
Have you ever made out with a Gap ad?
And girls want what they can’t have
So I don’t text back when the screen flash
You love me? You mean cash
Need a friend you can fuck, I can be that
Crush girls now, couldn’t last year
Oh, you like me now? Well that’s weird
Last year you were chillin’ with Lil Wayne
Now you wanna pretend like my feelings is still the same?
My work is my playtime
I need you to understand and to stay fine
Do this and I just might wife you
Let me poke you, ma, Raichu
Fuck your life
I don’t really think I drank enough tonight
Looking at you, make me wanna fuck for life
Lame ass dudes gon’ suck tonight
But so are these girls, am I wrong or right?
Girl, do somethin’ to me
“Nah, baby, you way too hood for me”
Y’all girls have never been good for me
Watch a nigga take over, mutiny
I wanna fuck with the lights on
Hey, girl, let a python slide on
Stay sick, infect me, Lysol
I’m on the edge, they hoping that I might fall
I make it work, I’m running with a new crew
And we do dope shit you ain’t used to
For me, by me, fuck Fubu
This girl never heard of me, go and check YouTube
I got a house with a dope view
See the ocean, dope shit, you an ’06, I’m an ’02
But enough about high school
I’m getting laid, or I’m getting lied to
You my stand-in Cameron, let me be your A-Rod
You number one in The Pack, Based God
Should I say something dumb to give us something to fight about?
Never mind, lights out

I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it
Show me what you doing, I don’t wanna lose
Have them lights turned on, show me what you doing
Show me what you do to me, me

Swag
2:30 and we still making progress
Talking on Twitter, see where to go next
3:30, man, where did the time go?
I’m chilling with this Asian chick I met in Chicago
She look like the Social Network chick
Except for her ass is twice as thick, man
Just wanna bite that shit
Where the fuck did my license went?
I must've left it at the other place
I rent a loft downtown with a ton of space
Yeah, we doing stupid shit, have stories when I’m older
But I don’t wanna see pictures of us on Vulture
Never thought about a year ago
I’m chillin’ out with the friends at the Super Bowl
Things change like a motherfuck
That’s why I wild out, keep the city up
Uh, I talk a lot about the girls in my songs
But you are different from the girls in my songs
Stop talking ’bout the girls in my songs
If you don’t like it, I can just take you home
More green than the top of these tree trunks
Leave your boyfriend here, ’cause he bunk
She like, “I’m not a slut”—speed bump
By the way, what’s your name? ‘Cause we drunk
[Chorus]
I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it (yeah, we drunk)
Show me what you doing, I don’t wanna lose (we drunk)
Have them lights turned on, show me what you doing (I’m drunk)
Show me what you do to me, me
I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it
Show me what you doing, I don’t wanna lose
Have them lights turned on, show me what you doing
Show me what you do to me, me

I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it
(I got to get high)
Show me what you doing, I don’t wanna lose
(I need to get high)
Have them lights turned on, show me what you doing

Show me what you do to me, me

Not Going Back,Childish Gambino,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: Childish Gambino]

But I’m not going back
Not going back, baby
Please tell me you don’t want me to fail
‘Cause I’m not going back
Not going back

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
I could've been a tragedy
That’s why these fake niggas who call me pussy are mad at me
‘Cause they ain’t have the smarts or the heart
Ain’t you read the fucking book Things Fall Apart?
I was never gonna stay the same
All I ever really wanted was to change the game
Spent the year kicking ass and taking names
Try to tell it to your heart, Taylor Dayne
Mama told me I was special when them test scores came in
Calling me the new Will Smith, that’s Jaden
Calling me a faggot when I’m rapping, that’s hating
I need to slow down, what the fuck is y’all saying?
Step inside the party, y’all niggas is mood killers
My lifestyle simple: Live easy and Bruce Willis
I’m the boss, Michael Scott, y’all bitches is just Phyllis
Set the world on fire, y’all motherfuckers is chillin', what is this?
That’s why these fucking emcees want their asses back
Don’t you know that I’m a rapist? Ask a track
Whiskey sipping, wanna drink the whole bottle
But these smart middle-class black kids need a role model
Fucking hate me, that’s what I’m used to
Suck a dick, we the shit, Metamucil
God damn, man, there’s gotta be a better way
Than pill-popping all these drugs so I can stay awake
Like I’m Jessie in this bitch, I’m so excited
There’s a party at the top, you ain’t invited
But it’s lame, and all the bitches is fake
You think about your old girl and how breaking up’s a mistake
Black dudes assume I’m closeted or kinda gay
White people confused like girl on Glee and Gabourey
IAmDonald is a full-time job
These niggas want me to fail so they can write me off
[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
It seems like they all want me to fail
But I’m not going back
Not going back, baby
Please tell me you don’t want me to fail
‘Cause I’m not going back
Not going back

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Dirty girls love my dick; they’re cockroaches
Jewish girls eat my meat, it’s not kosher
Relax, black chick, I think that I have offended thee
Got nothing against the sisters, I just don’t think they’re into me
I am not a thug, AKA: what they pretend to be
I am just myself, AKA: my worst enemy
Yeah, bitch, cut the swag with a fucking knife
I come hard like my life keep her pussy tight
It’s cool though, it’s all good
You want a dude who keep it real and stay hood
I’m sorry, babe, but I act me
I don’t ""act black,"" whatever that be
I’m just happy these girls seem into me now
Yeah, they're looking for some In-N-Out, animal style
With this lettuce, cheese, bread—making sandwiches
That’s why you niggas fail like all of your parents’ marriages
Ran into Rashida Jones, told me that she heard my song
When I called her mixed like the crowd at my last show
She said to write her something nice on the next track
But she cute, so I wrote her ass a whole rap
Man, I threw that shit away, it felt dumb
Believe me, it was bad, we’re better off, you’re welcome
I worked hard on that song like day and night
That whole song made this one verse, crazy, right?
I guess it all goes somewhere, you know that?
Like that bullshit, you talked before Culdesac
""I didn’t know he had it in him""
Couldn’t see me as Spider-Man, but now I’m spittin’ venom
Now you payin’ attention, pick your fucking face up
When I wanna be a superhero, I just wake up
Renaissance man with a Hollywood buzz
I refuse to go back to not liking who I was because
[Outro: Beldina Malaika, Childish Gambino]
Fake love, these fake dreams
These fake sounds
All the things that we felt
Your voice was screaming too loud
I know what you’re ready to be (be)
But it isn’t with me (me)
So I’m ready to leave you alone
I don’t really wanna fight like this
I don’t ever wanna lose your kiss
All I ever wanted was someone to hold onto
I just wanna be your girl
Everything you haven’t heard

Got to the point where I was driven, twenty-four seven
Money's my mission, just a nigga tryna make a livin'
These busta tricks don't want no mail
They spendin' they riches on scandalous bitches, who'll stay petrified in jail
It's hell, plus all the dealers want a meal ticket
Jealous-ass bitches, player-hatin' but we still kick it
Always keep my eyes on the prize, watch the police
Seen so much murder, neighborhoods gettin' no sleep
But still, I get my money on major, continuously
Communicatin' through my pager, niggas know me
Don't have no homies since they jealous, I hustle solo

Be your own nigga meanin' buy your own dope

Be true to this game and this game will be true to you
That's real shit; disrespect, see what this here do to you
That jackin' and robbin', despisin' your homie
Ain't healthy, niggas be endin' up dead 'fore they get wealthy

No time for askin' why, gettin' high, gettin' mine
Put away my nine, 'cause these times call for four-five shells
'Cause life is hell, and everybody dies
What about these niggas I despise
Them loud talkin', cowards shootin' guns into crowds, jeopardizin' lives
Shoot 'em right between them niggas' eyes, it's time to realize
Follow the rules or follow them fools that die

Big smiles, Shake hands, kiss babies nice to meet ya
It's my honor to serve ya, my word is yours, they beseech us
Parasites pocketed, Lobbyist doctrines
Alone or bipartisan, the people out of a partnership
Two boxes, two names but it's two face, the same game, the same brain
Money laundering
Non-stop profiting, Non-stop marketing
A vote for the leeches
As a service to peoples
A wink and they leave us
While city falls to pieces
While the world yearns, burns, churns its ashes in a urn
...
I'm in a daze, smoked up and wrapped in a blaze
Kidnapped, doped up and trapped in a maze
What I wanna be and what the world would rather me be
Lost in the desert and they feedin' salt water too me
Living off my own sweat, drink it from my own lips
I can taste it, life being wasted
Different dimensions, pushing me down into submission
Serpico, they want me to play their position
Too many goals for one mission, maybe there's no mission
I can't make this decision
Label man told me sit down and listen
Music's just business, you just need an image
You just need a gimmick
Gangster, hipster, backpacker, thrasher, beef with all the other rappers
Bastard, wanted me to call him master
Imma rip through him like a natural disaster
Aha -- that's just a joke cause you can't really beat em
They livin' in our shadows so if we shine, we feed em
Everyday we please em, our taxes or it's treason
Blackwater congress, education for monstera
I don't believe in no illuminati nonsense
But I know that the system's trying to hold us bondage
Different dresses but it's the same damned mistress
Different dreams, cashing in to make a little business"
Motown 25,Salud,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","I bring fear fierce tears like El's career speared ears
Meat machine - lean-cuisine rappers smeared on gears
I flow quicksand, Liquid earth, Drown a man in land
Dry every gland, the taste of my brand, Taste of Iran
Persia, Iran, shah for an eon
Crown brown Yo Samity Sam for his treason
Hip hop is garbage, Spitters missing they targets
Sitting pretty in markets wishing they had an audience
Obvious!
Gass em up, ask for the candy stock
Swag talk, booty bitches, hired help for crews
Ship em off to the mags for the hot chart reviews
Bring em' to me, I'll make your 10 croon winter blues
The cleanest cut of hip hop since bee-bop and weed dropped
Funky fresh seed pop make you groove till your knees stop
Then move a little more
The flow is so adored like the smile of the newborn birthed in a winter storm
Salud the barbarian
Youngest of the contrarians
Murderous humanitarian, vocals of proletariats
Iranian uranium banging inside my cranium
Radiating membrane be lighting up every stadium
Dr. Musical
Salud to the rescue - Ah!
High-minded, Highlighted scribbles in math binders
Rewind and feel the shine dripping from the speaker iron
Twisted metal hot from the kettle makes the speaker blind
My drum heats violent beats for vibrant streets
Cities, farms and suburbs
Rain, snow, shine or sleet
I weather the weather whether for worse or for better
Each letter can sweat a liter of blood from the effort
I'm putting into music, this is thread that I'm spooling
To keep you people warm in the night when you're snoozing
On the mic I turn horizons sweet into thunderstorms
Breathe in Reds, purples, blues where the sky is torn
Always straight original
Chemical syllables
Enriched and cultivated with the purest hip hop minerals
That still my targets citadel
And smith my arrows plentiful
See my feathers reding your head - so suitable
Short little bottle rocket taped to some C4
Playing with fire, twisting the wire, you'll see more
Fuel air gas blast ripping into air masks
Nothing left to breathe but body ash so breathe fast
Cheddar cheese, cake, green
Bottles, ice all little bling
Simple things given to simple men - Simpletons
Uncle toms soon to be Rodney kings
Ring tone rappers believing their own hype
They're repping it
Singing as they welcome it
They ain't fly but they winging it
Salud, I'm running my 8 mile as I'm building it
Are you feelin it?
Mr 5'5 on the umpteen can you see that I'm killing it?"

Girlfriend, I don't know what you did to me
But it sure feel like something good for me
Stay on my mind all day and all night
I'm seriously contemplatin on makin you wife
Yup, I'm twenty-seven girl I need to settle down now
I don't need to be up in the club chasin the brown round
You don't need to to be up the streets chasin these clowns down
Let's say we catch a matinee today, downtown
So I can tell you bout this dream I had lately
The one with the house on the hill and a baby
The picket white fence, in a field full of daisies
The AMG kit on the silver Mercedes
Would it hurt you to try me? Hi, mami
Every good man got a good woman behind him
And every superhero got a good woman beside him
Girl stop playin', I wanna hold your hand

[Verse Two]
Look chocolate, lately I been feelin awkward
Finally found someone to talk with, walk through the park with
I'm on some Joan of Arc shit, I need a rider with me
Sometimes I sit and wonder why you even bother with me
Look Sean, looked in your eyes and seen dawn
Dewdrops on the leaves in the lawn
I breathe calmly, read Qur'an, see Surah 60
Love heals all past wounds, you assist me
You with me?
The butterflies came to get me
Cupid cocked back the four pound, squeezed one off, the shot hit me
North of the kidney, and now I'm head over

Me and My Monkey,Robbie Williams,"['pop', 'rock']","[Verse 1]
There was me and my monkey
And with his dungarees and roller blades smoking filter tips
Reclining in the passenger seat of my super-charged jet black Chevrolet
He had the soft-top down (he liked the wind in his face)
He said 'Son, you ever been to Vegas?' I said 'no'
He said 'that's where we're gonna go - you need a change of pace'
And we hit the strip with all the wedding chapels and the neon signs
He said 'I left my wallet in El Segundo' and proceeded to take two grand of mine
We made tracks to The Mandalay Bay Hotel
Asked the bell boy if he'd take me and my monkey as well?
He looked in the passenger seat of my car and with a smile he said
'If your monkey's got that kind of money sir, then we've got a monkey bed!'

[Hook]
Me and my monkey
With a dream and a gun
I'm hoping my monkey don't point that gun at anyone
Me and my monkey
Like Butch and the Sundance Kid
Trying to understand why he did what he did
Why he did what he did
[Verse 2]
We got the elevator, I hit the 33rd floor
We had a room up top with the panoramic views like nothing you'd ever seen before
He went to sleep in the bidet and when he awoke
He ran his little monkey fingers through yellow pages
Called up some escort services and ordered some okey doke
Forty minutes later there came a knock at the door
In walked this big bad ass baboon into my bedroom with three monkey whores
'Hi! My name is Sunshine - these are my girls
Lace my palm with silver baby and oh yeah, they'll rock your world'
So I watched pay-per-view and polished my shoes and my gun
Was diggin' old Kurt Cobain singing 'bout lithium
There came a knock at the door and in walked Sunshine
'What's up? You'd better get your ass in here boy, your monkey's having too much of a good
Time!'

[Hook]
Me and my monkey
Drove in search of the sun
Me and my monkey
Don't point that gun at anyone
Me and my monkey
Like Billy the Kid
Trying to understand
Why he did what he did
Why he did what he did
[Verse 3]
Got tickets to see Sheena Easton, the monkey was high
Said it was a burning ambition to see her before he died
We left before encores, he couldn't sit still
Sheena was a blast baby but my monkey was ill
We went to play black-jack, kept hitting twenty three
Couldn't help but notice this Mexican just staring at me
Or was it my monkey? I couldn't be sure
It's not like you'd never seen a monkey in rollerblades and dungarees before
Now don't test my patience cause we're not about to run
That's a bad ass monkey boy and he's packing a gun
'My name is Rodriguez', he says with death in his eye
'I've been chasing you for a long time amigos, and now your monkey's gonna die!'

[Hook]
Me and my monkey
Drove in search of the sun
Now me and my monkey
We don't wanna kill no mexican
But we've got ten itchy fingers
And one thing to declare
When the monkey is high
You do not stare, you do not stare
You do not stare...

[Outro]
Looks like we've got ourselves a mexican standoff here boy
Huh...
And I ain't about to run
Put your gun down, boy
Huh huh...
How did I get mixed up with this fucking monkey anyhow?"
Pepsi Freestyle,The Notorious B.I.G.,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Hey yo, Enuff, man! What you got to drink up in here, man? I'm thirsty

Big slam, quick slam, tin can, whatever
Whether too cold or too hot, you got to keep Pepsi in the freezer
I keep a 3 liter for my crew
My girl like them diet joints too
For when she watch her weight, crack the top I can't wait
Other sodas taste the worst -- I don't even converse
If it can't quench my thirst what you in my fridge for?
What you wanna live for? Life with the dry mouth
Hot like the south, flash out ya 12 ounce and renounce
Nothing can beat the P-e-p-s-i
Yes I drink it constantly; cop it by the case, tastes great, less filling
Non-alcoholic I can feed it to my children
Tell em Biggie said, ""Drink it all""; don't test me!
Nothing else beats a Pepsi, if it is, let's see..I'm thirsty"

To see something other than these blues and grays
I need something different, hey yeah, yeah, yeah
Cause you ain't feeling the same

Who knows, maybe I'm crazy, that's one big maybe
But even a fool knows when it's gold, gold, gold

Oh, I can tell the difference every time that you call
But I don’t need a drink I need some time in my car
Time to drive and think, time to park and cry

You shoulda known what I saw in you, yeah
Please forgive me for feeling like it’s all your fault
A heavy heart can’t carry blame for the loss

It’s pathetic baby don’t lie, don’t lie
I’m a candle, you’re the sun
And you’re burning baby, you're burning baby
Burning up, burning up
Burning up, burning up, burning up, yeah

But I was too focused on getting bread, pay me
Now they telling all of those DJ's to play me
Mama sat me down and told me all about the 80s
My favorite color was green, like money, since a baby
The niggas turn flaky, bitches turn shady
But no more gray days, I waved goodbye to Macy
Purple haze give me lazy eyes like McGrady
And that's on everything, that 31st raised me
And that's on everything, got Adidas in all flavors

Money on my mind, the bank account getting thicker
Blowing out of pounds, cases of the liquor
Surrounded by these bitches, I'm far from fictitious
Niggas claim they G, but they startin' to look suspicious
Hating on the planes every time my name gets mentioned
I don't pay 'em no attention, I keep on twisting up
This purp is so sticky, it's getting stuck to my fingers
Jet set, we here, hitting the game from all angles
Got it in a chokehold, it's more like a strangle
Say I'm one of the best and I ain't never dropped a single
My flow on point, you can tell from the lingo
Christmas sack of trees, yeah I'm smoking Kris Kringle

Playing my position, hot Nick, son

Poisonous darts sickenin', best believe
Finger itchin' with two broke legs, now I'm trippin'

Start trouble, bust bubbles, hip to wicked ways
Gotta love me, G-O-D, no one above me
Look good but fuck ugly
Tap your jaw from my Punch Buggy sonning you
Got you shittin' in your last Huggie, running who?
Fuckin' punk, get a speed bump coming through

Yo, ayo, I put it on a nigga, shitted on a nigga
Turn a Christian to a certified sinner
The bomb I release, time pent up (Explode)
When you got sent up I was hitting your ex ho
Shit, I kept low, petro' your metro
Politic, keep the chickenheads gobblin'
Shit I'm driving in come with fog halogen
Terrorize your city from the spliff committee
Kick ass 'til both Timberlands turn shitty
Gritty, smack the driver's head in the gypsy

I snatch your crown with ya head still attached to it
Canibus is the type who'll fight for mics
Beating niggas to death and beating dead niggas to life
When you look at me long enough, I'll start to read your thoughts
If the signal was strong enough, and then I'll call your bluff
Like, ""Yo, how many rhymes you got?""
I could go on for more Millenniums than Mazda's got on the car lot
And there's nowhere to run to, when I confront ya
Nigga, I call your bluff like it had a phone number
Who wanna see Canibus get wild?
Who wanna act fly and get shot down with a surface-to-air missile?
I take 'em on in all shapes, sizes and forms and spit on
Anybody who ain't close enough to shit on
Zero to sixty? I'm already doin' a hundred when I'm blunted
And I give it to any nigga that want it

Stay out the dark, 'cause if I catch you when the sun is down
Run it clown, come up off that, or I'm gon' gun it down
Run it now, however it's gon' go, it's gon' be that
See that, that shit'll finish you, dog, believe that
Where we at? Do you value your life as much as your possessions?
Don't be a stupid nigga, learn a lesson
I'm gon' get you either way, and it's better to live
Let me get what's between your sock 'cause it's better to give
Than receive, believe what I say when I tell you
Don't make me put you somewhere where nobody'll smell you
And when the lights is out, they don't come back on
This ain't a flick, you ain't gon' come back on, you ain't that strong
You knew it was wrong, but you asked for it, baby
You's a big nigga, ski mask for it, baby
So I can hit you up on Front Street, you think I'm sweet
Want heat, one deep, leave him behind, front seat

Snapping, you amateur MC's
Don't you know I'm like the Dream Team touring overseas?
For rappers in my circle, I'm a deadly disease
Ringmaster, bringing a tiger cub to his knees (Uh)
In the history of rap, they've never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance (Word up)
Now let's get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side, it'd transform into a time bomb
You don't wanna borrow that, you wanna idolize
And you don't wanna make me mad, nigga, you wanna socialize
And I'm daring every MC in the game
To play yourself out position, and mention my name (LL)
I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name
Go platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train

Near, givin the captain a high-five
I'm, a fly guy - why not?
I'm like tied top, I rock music
I'm tryin to be set for life like a Jew kid
And me not runnin +The Block+ like a +New Kid+
That's like, Hov', not doin ""Blueprint""

Yo I was a asshole, in the classroom
Now I'm a sick nigga, like a bad cold
Mister +Unforgettable+, Nat Cole
You can't witness none of it from the back row
Nigga move up, and walk with my foot
And follow my ingredients like a cookbook
Let me show you how to hustle, look look
I even got some of the oil that Bush took
Me shook? Look, that is not me
I feel cocky like ""Rocky,"" part three
When I speak, white girls jock me
They know I Rush Limbaugh for the ock see
Pardon me partner, you'll find out
That I'm a, lady's man, Leon Feltz
Gap Band, I'll blow your mind out
With the nine and my, Louis Vuitton belt

This is street radio, for unsung hero
Riding in they regal, trying to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo, I found the new Preemo
'Ye, you know how we do, we do it for the people

[Verse 1: Common]
And the struggle of the brothas and the folks
With lovers under dope, experiment to discover hopes
Scuffle for notes, the rougher I wrote, times was harder
Went from rocky starter to a voice of a martyr
Why white folk focus on dogs and yoga?
While people on the low end tryna ball and get over
Lyrics are like liquor for the fallen soldiers
From the bounce to the ounce, it's all our culture
Everyday we hustlin', tryna get them custom rims
Law, we ain't trusting them, thick broads, we lust in them
Sick and tired of punching it, I look on the bus at them
When I see 'em struggling, I think how I'm touching them

At the Grammy's, though they tried to India.Arie me
Got back stage, and I bumped into Stevie
He said no matter what, the people gon' see me
Can't leave rap alone the streets need me
Hunger in they eyes, is what seems to feed me
Inside peace mixed with beast seem to breed me
Nobody believe, until I believe me
Now I'm on the rise doing business with my guys
Visions realize, music affected lives
A gift from the skies, to be recognized
I'm keeping my eyes on the people, that's the prize

I see the I in We, my nigga, yours is my drama
Standing in front of the judge with no honor

Yeah (Hahaha)
Hey

[Verse 1]
Louis frames hide my bloodshot eyes
My disguise, from this world outside
Vivid description paints a picture for the blind
Got me on my syrup sippin' shit, slowin' down time
I'm hidden from the shine
Trippy shit, she listen and then rewind
Put the black light on, close the blinds
Walkin' on the clouds, turnin' water into wine
As I travel through ya mind
Now you swimmin' through ya thoughts
Creep outside the lines, those who live within the box
Gone, seein' spots like chickenpox
So gone, Michael Jordan start missin' shots
Acid, tablets, down the hole with Alice
Smilin' like the cat is, water from a cactus
Snapback fallin' off my head, mad hat shit
Got the earth spinnin' off its axis
Feelin' like the shit, no diaper
Sippin' apple cider, goin' back and forth like a windshield wiper
This gon' be another all-nighter
'Cause I'm trippin' out, yeah, I'm trippin' out
[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Got a bottle of water, couple tablets, and a half a zip
Pack your bags, we goin' on a acid trip
Don't mean to scare you, just get inside the car
The driver sayin', ""Where to?"", to the top, please
Hidden from the news and paparazzi
It wake you up like coffee, yeah
Now, I'm layin in my strawberry fields
Appeal to my senses and it seem so real
A figment of imagination, uh
And I've heard your prior allegations
And it's true, bitch, I'm higher than you
Maybe goin' schizo, open up the window
Trippy like the music on Nintendo
It's all good, bro, roll some endo
Lost you at the twenty, but I'll see you in the end-zone
I'm trippin' out"
Cut loose,Field Mob,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","My shorty done cut me loose
She say she don't want no more

My shorty done cut me loose and left me in the wind
Got a new man wit a Ph.D. and cheese, but he pees in Depends
He's sixty, she's in her twenties
She said I be hurtin' her, overworkin' her
And when I hit from back it feels like I'm burpin' her

She said I'm wrong for her, too long for her
But she never complained when I
Brought the X home for her
But now she dropped me like the pin at the end of a Sprint commercial
I try to hit it, she be like no, like Laura Winslow, and I'm convinced I'm Urkel

And what if I did misuse and abuse your clit, I'll apologize
Cause I ain't know ruler sticks, would bruise the clit
I saw it on tape tried to do the shit
Now she say she want somebody simple
She say she want somebody gentle she said, when I got head
I dug in her cheek, now she got a dimple
I, I, I mean she cute with it though, I, I couldn't help it
The way she swallowed my pelvis
Had me seeing shit, had a nigga reaching for Elvis
And I come on her head, that some I'm a miss
That girl gave my dick more hickeys than a damn redneck locksmith

I woke up this morning stretching
Yawning with a hard on, horny, ready to bone
Then I reached on my right and realized my woman's gone
I got up to bring her to bed to hit her some more
But I found this envelope sitting on the pillow

I opened it, unfolded it, it said, ""Dear Smoke
Hey, it's me your Little Debbie Cake and I feel it's best we separate
At least until I'm in better shape
Cause I'm doing my best to shut up and take

The way you ramming inches in me
Slam me in different positions
Grasp and grip my hips and titties
Put one leg up drag and flip me

Fucking me up, down, back, to front
(How you squeezing and smacking my butt)
From right to left, left to right
(And skeeting across my breast and thighs)

Fucking me early Monday, again on Tuesday
All day Wednesday then come Thursday
Twice on Friday and Saturday and after church on Sunday
Hurting my stomach, beating the cock
But trip, when I ask you to eat the twat, so we need to stop
Cause lately I been bleeding a lot, so I'm leaving you, doc
To find someone that's fair and square
And not so hairy there, who fucks me there with care
Cause you put too much wear and tear on my derriere""

Cool Points,King Chip,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Louis Vuitton, Dior for sure
I just touched down, I'm tryna score some more
My personality is insanity mixed with wisdom
Today the day they let my nigga Arc up out that prison
So we bout to hit the mall as soon as I come off tour
He showed me how to live, I owe him a little more
In this world where they say that you don't owe nobody nothing
All I ever had was my niggas, since a youngin
On the front porch, heard them shots it was nothin'
Dope boys had what the celebrities had, stuntin'
So being starstruck by the nigga from St. Clair
Bringing two or three whips out a year just wasn't fair
As a young nigga I looked up to that
But now I'm older, wiser, I don't fuck with that
I'm trying to live for real, and get this paper and chill
Sometimes I wish the fame ain't come with these raps I spill
And I blast to kill, I got that 40 on me all times, that's for real
This really my life, these ain't no acting skills
Cause you can act like you 'bout to bust a move and get killed
Whoever look like they up to something, that's they ass
I'm from where niggas shoot first and don't never ask, nigga
You better stay up on your current events
Fuck the mainstream, the world don't deserve this

I'm scared to go to sleep at night, I might not wake up
I'm trying to shine, like something fresh out of Jacob
I want to be good, but nigga I'm trying to cake up
I need a bitch who a 10 before the makeup
And if not, give me the pussy with no hassle
I'm a king, where my crown, where my castle
On average I come near death like twice a week
See a Cleveland nigga on the street, we don't like to speak
If these hoes know what's up, are you DTF or what?
My lifestyle too fast to be your man, bitch don't hold me up
After I ooze, I gots to make moves
Niggas end up on the news for running up on them fools
Yo, my hood got its own government, fuck the rules
Little niggas in my hood got way too much to prove
And not too much to lose, cause most of they fam in jail or dead
And you wonder why them young boys never scared
Just tryna get hella bread, too much pussy, hella (?)
I'm just tryna do what I done cause these niggas never did
Try to keep a level head, show 'em what this life about
Corny-ass niggas stepping up to bat and striking out
If I hit the club I got that weapon on me always
But all I get is love, so we party and we all blaze
Vaporizer, get higher than the stratosphere
And get some money, get some dome, and we outta here

Sum Shit I Wrote,Common,"['hip hop', 'jazz', 'blues', 'r&b', 'pop']","Marks I erase like racism, I'm as large as a bigot
Brew is my escapism, when I'm bubbly I just kick it
What I need from you is understanding that I'm standing
On my own two, down with my own crew
Told cancer, I'm bad to the bone too, I'm prone to snap off
When I'm off that Cognac I can't hold back like a masseuse
I get loose like a screw turned from left right to tight
Man, when it's time for some action I get red, tonight's da night
An eye for an eye, a life for what's right
Dissect it I'm on hi-tech shit computers want to bite
Your style is Pascal, mine is Basic and just instinct
I'm went to F.A.M. and ran scams, me and Murray got up on big links
And if knowledge is the key, goddammit uh I'm the locksmith
Studied the missionary waitin on my life, the mic I rush like bostage
I switch styles like a channel with controls that is remote
Engage in a page, and with words I elope
Walking down the aisles with styles I freak the vow(el)s
That tie knots when I rocks like a Z-28
At any rate, brothers gain interest cause I loaned them microphones
They couldn't house the shit so they had to rent to own
It's like that, coming from the Go rapper
I wanna bone Jada Pinkett and that ho Patra
So keep on, and you don't, now come on
Ah keep on, and you don't
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear a wack-ass rhyme
And I catch Alz-rhymers, then forget it, I get charged
Like a nigga in position with a stolen card of credit
Fuck flipping the script, the rap scene I'm trying to edit
My mellows call me ""Never"", they be like ""Never's going to get it""
Never's too much, I'm much too, I do justice to poetics
That's why cats be like ""Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!""
Other studs come through to see what I am up to
They be on the dick of crew giving us weed and buying us brew
Like Kareem I got the hook up, brothers look out cause they look up
Rest in peace to Harold, I'm washing tons of rappers like Booker
T. told me ""You gotta get out of the crib, get into the world""
How you going to come off with the style that's sterile?
It's like that, keep on, ha ha
It's like that, keep on

My foundation is a black block of niggas that rock they hat cocked
I'm real like a fight with my rap, rappers I slapbox
Back I got my rap cocked get your Glock out the black face
Got tall flavor with fat taste, the rap race is a rat race
Just cause you got Adidas with the fat laces and the fro don't make you
Hip-hop
You sorry excuse for funk rap
Why is there so many cranks trying to rhyme, yo funk that
The real shit's starting to come back
The Go is where I'm from and where I'm at, jack
I started eating cat when I was 10
Before then I was getting big dog like Glenn Robinson
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
But comes a time when you gotta come off of that booty
The facts of life I didn't learn from watching Tootie
But living in the big city but I still like Tootie cause she got big titties
My style is steep, I rip rhymes on the incline
Splat guts bust fat nuts and lay up like a crip line
I'm slamming, jamming on the one
I'm a bad man, you're just a good son, come on"
High Rise,Big Sean,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Man I got my dark glasses on, cause I'm ready for the big lights
All my money counted, all my rubbers skintight
Me, I always fit out, you was more the in type
I never follow suit, you was more like pinstripes
Riding in Ye's Maybach, smoking so it's cloudy
With three girls who spent all day doing Pilates
Getting money, niggas think I joined illuminati
Throwing west side up, I'm feeling like Killuminati
Now isn't it ironic that I'm in a big body
Paranoid cause every rapper named Big got bodied, boy
And my bitch got body
But I sit her in the back, cause my nigga called shotty!
And I'mma G-O till I'm a OG
Rocking something high end, like a fucking OD
They feel a nigga from NY to the OC
If we down in the 4th quarter, I take it to OT
Take it to 1 and 0, just take it it's on me
Chilling in the hot spot cause I never get cold feet
Nigga, you on the sidelines praying for an audible
Cause when you're legendary everything is quotable
Priceless is affordable, order what you can't afford
Matter fact, order more
And I think I'mma have the same thing
My whole team getting cash, I just call it gangrene
Big is on the track, Ye be on the track
Since when Kobe and LeBron hoop for the same team
Could live my life blindfold
Cause every time my eyes close
I just tend to fuck around and see the same thing
Yeah, I just tend to see the same thing
They say it's meant to be when you sleep to the same dream
I hooked up with GOOD, and been living a changed scene
I'm trying to turn these gray clouds to Vanilla Skies
Camera in my face, I guess the future will be televised
And I'm as underrated as can be, bitch
Fuck it if I'm underrated, I stay on some G shit
Nigga, I chief up, it's December 25
Three hundred and sixty-five, forever puttin' reef up
And your girlfriend forever want to meet her
Tryna see what is in common but my dick is what's between us
Man I break her heart every time I change hoes
I make a new style every time I change clothes
Man they jock my rhymes every time I change flows
One of the few getting change but won't change for it"
Salute,Domo Genesis,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
I don't think that I ever changed, ball hard or spark spliffs
And when I'm in the booth, it's super like Clark Kent
Competition fails to ever place an event
So when I step up to the track, you consider my shit a win
Never gonna stop, Genesis is the begin
All about the money, I'm changin' my name to Yen
Swagger so tall, check Yao up in the chin
Stay reachin' for the sky like a nigga can't swim
But I'm on my two and my pivot lookin great
Tell Z to have 'em rolled when I touch down in the state
Tell them we eatin' well and we never scrapin' plates
Stealin' bitches from they niggas just becuase I like the chase
Odd Future wolves, full moon, salivate
Look I done made it, the same nigga that you hate
Salutin' the game, pilots all up in the place
Fly niggas do it all, y'all grounded like bad grades
Never said thug, but my niggas will pop
And if it's Louie V or Gucci then my niggas will cop
Wait for the summer, Rolling Papers will drop
And hatin' and speculatin' is the shit that will stop
I'mma go hard, or I'mma do nothin'
Like a beeper in a toilet, bet my shit buzzin'
Hell yeah I'm the shit, just take a whiff, cousin
Now you all frowned up, thought I told you I been stuntin'
I get my highs and lows like NASDAQ
Spit up addiction and bag that, pass crack

Did my thing; I prayed and hoped
Now I'm getting back cuz my thick hoes wanna date
Put no limit just twerkin' and movin'

Live your life don't focus on money
Hello girl you can call me the moon man
Up above I fly fast anywhere nigga any given time a couple lines

Now all I gotta do is sing for a pretty thing
Give me five minutes, she all on my ding-a-ling
Can't live if you ain't about something
Can't talk if you live life frontin'

Rather, let us raise our voices in more pleasing
And more joyful sounds!
Joy! (Joy!)
Joy! (Joy!)

Joy, beautiful spark of divinity
Daughter of Elysium
We enter, drunk with fire
Into your sanctuary, heavenly (daughter)!
Your magic reunites
What custom strictly divided
All men become brothers
Where your gentle wing rests

Whoever has had the great fortune
To be a friend's friend
Whoever has won a devoted wife
Join in our jubilation!
Indeed, whoever can call even one soul
His own on this earth!
And whoever was never able to, must creep
Tearfully away from this band!
Joy all creatures drink
At the breasts of nature;
All good, all bad
Follow her trail of roses
Kisses she gave us, and wine
A friend, proved in death;
Pleasure was given to the worm
And the cherub stands before God
Before God!

Glad, as His suns fly
Through the Heaven's glorious design
Run, brothers, your path
Joyful, as a hero to victory

Be embraced, millions!
This kiss for the whole world!
Brothers, above the starry canopy
Must a loving Father dwell
Do you bow down, millions?
Do you sense the Creator, world?
Seek Him beyond the starry canopy!
Beyond the stars must He dwell

Be embraced, you millions!
This kiss for the whole world!
Brothers, beyond the star-canopy
Must a loving Father dwell
Be embraced
This kiss for the whole world!

Daughter of Elysium
Joy, beautiful spark of divinity

I used that motivation for shit to spit about
Two thousand watt amp, three thousand dollar lamp
I'm coming from the ghetto, now where my food stamps?
I smell the scent of college, now where's my fucking grants?
No money in the bank, only in my pants
Counting up dollars like the pole when the strippers dance
Take your day serious cause some niggas don't get the chance
I consider me lucky
Got these haters all hushed like the puppy, stuffing
Goes inside their chickens that are clucking
I'll be like an iPhone, your girl wanna touch me

[Hook]
I got it, I got it, I got it, you got it?
I got it, I got it, I got it, you got it?

[Verse 2]
Man they put me out, man they put me out
And a man is in the man if you gotta pussy out
Whooshin' on the couch and bushin' at the mouth
Slut want comfort and them cushions on the couch
I'm a get up, and chase that money
A bumblebee with pollen feeling make that honey
I can't be tall and shrink like a midget
She can't give me her number and I not call them digits
He lives in anxiety, he twitches and he fidgets
If he don't tell you his story, ask this homie Bridget
And Bridget is like a down-ass ho
But a woman that knows his story won't tell a soul
Cause once you reap you a soul, karma only grows
Carmen only knows when she's riding in the gear
Mercedes come around with money, throw like a cheer
Visa for Mona Lisa with a C cup, drink up

My Story,Jean Grae,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Jean Grae]
“If I could swim a thousand lakes to bring your life back...”  I write
That, but infinity can’t rewind facts.  You are
Divinity.  My primitive mind was struggling
Just to understand the meaning of life, forgive me
I never told my mommy, I couldn’t break her spirit.  She always
Wished her daughter extraordinary thinking, so I
Traveled alone, young, sixteen, got in
The habit of not staying at home, doing the
Sad walk like Bill Bixby, a dollar fifty
Trips to the hospital so that Medicaid could fix me
I couldn’t eat shit.  I fainted frequent
On cold floors and I pause and I think, “Keep it”
I’m lost.  My four friends know and just
Fuck at the boys’ apartments for rent, so I’m all
Wishing that it’s a dream ending soon.  I’ve actually
Erased a lot that I’ve been through

[Hook: Jean Grae]
See, when
The rain comes down
I know it’s falling for me
And only for me
And when
The pain comes around, there’s nowhere
Else I rather would be
I know what I’ve done (Please forgive me)
[Verse 2: Jean Grae]
Now all my bitter homies saying, “That’s what men do.”  Feeling
Retarded for seeing partner potential.  On top
Of that, the doctors telling me a heart murmur.  I can’t
Take it, I’m contemplating a Glock burner, a
Cop murderer.  I can’t leave.  This can’t be
The tears streaming, and I can’t see they lanced me
And I’m passing out, and this is just for blood.  They had
To cover the mass amounts.  I’ve had enough
And you don’t know what it’s like in waiting rooms, and out-
-side, their picketing pictures could slay you
They’re screaming, “Victims,” and spitting ‘til they shame you
I hold my head low and shiver, push my way through
They put you in a room where you can change into
Your gown and shower cap, shaking as a fiend would do
And that’s when you think of leaving, fleeing the building
And then they call you and you’re hearing the call of your children
They count down from ten now.  You wanna stop ‘em, but
You say it in your head: you’re out for the cut
And then you wake up in another room with plenty others
They call it recovery.  You’re thinking, “We ain’t mothers”
And then prescription pills, written a ‘script with chills
An understatement.  You’re dressed but you’re naked still
And your brain won’t think straight
Wait.  Can’t finish this
[Hook: Jean Grae]
See, when
The rain comes down
I know it’s falling for me
And only for me
And when
The pain comes around, there’s nowhere
Else I rather would be
I know what I’ve done (Please forgive me)

[Verse 3: Jean Grae]
I kept it bottled up.  My parents found the pills
Screaming, “God what have you done?”  Cried ‘til I snotted blood
Then got a gun.  My temple ran quick though
From the thought, then the worst: I was caught in the same place
A year later.  For me, that’s when hatred started
My faith martyred.  I’ve dated the father of a father
Then I moved on.  Years passed, the guilt’s
Worse and it builds ‘til your heart’s smashed
Then I miscarried.  Twenty-two age, I was headed to
A breakdown, swallowed up some pills and I laid down
I was a failure at that too, bailed from
The rap then, but fate took me back in
“Sing” is a tattoo my fingers attached with.  Twenty-seven
With three kids that I never met.  What if I
Was Catholic?  Wonder if they hate me, thinking how
Their mother could ever murder?  Well take me, Hell
To the depths where the brimstone chokes me constantly
I am a monster, see.  How could I possibly
Correspond with God when I gave the authority
To end their life?
But it’s never over, even if we have a child
They could have had a brother or a sister or both
I’m thinking about another life that almost got close
Praying that, in another time, we could have changed posts
If I could just reverse time, I would
I don’t know what I would do.  Honestly, it’s not good
I’m sorry..."

Bacc 2 School,Afroman,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Afroman]

Man, my daddy told me
Boy, when I was your age
I had to walk 13 miles to school
I said, ""Oh, is that why you didn't graduate?""

[Hook: Afroman]

Talkin' noise with all of my homeboys
Fit to go back to school, yeah
(Her titties bigger than they were last summer, know what I'm sayin'?)
With a mouthful of beer and a nose full of weed
You know I'm fit to act a fool, yeah

[Verse 2: Afroman]

Mama, I'mma
Go to the University of Smoking Marijuana
All of my friends go to USC
So I'm gonna tag along and hit the bong with them
Walkin' through the masses, lookin' for my classes
I can't concentrate on the teacher, surrounded by titties and asses
Spent a lot of money on some brand new clothes
Trying to impress these brand new hoes
Laugh every time I have sex with a chick
Baby don't know I'm an ex-convict
Walking round the campus with my 'fro on thick
Every twenty seconds I be grabbin' my dick
Full of alcohol at the football games
Doin' more drugs than my nigga Rick James
My GPA is dropping at a very fast rate
It'll take a miracle for me to graduate
Maybe I won't, maybe I will
Stressed out, poppin' pills in my Coupe Deville
[Hook x1]

[Verse 2: Afroman]

How do I party?
And still pass
I hardly
Ever go to class
Got a golden eagle on my stolen Regal
If you bought it from me, it's illegal
Cause I'm Afroman, the educated Crip
On a rock cocaine scholarship
Cook that crack until it's done
I use that for my Negro college fund

Broke minorities, selling dope to those bitches in sororities
She's drinking one too many 40's
She took her clothes off, now we're having orgies
Baby, I don't mean to act rude
But you told me you would never fuck a black dude
Colt 45 must have got you in the mood
To eat a fat dick like some soul food

[Hook x1]

[Verse 3: Afroman]
(Hey fellas, can I get jiggy with it? Hey, check this shit out right here)

Hey homeboy, don't stress, I got the answers to the test
My college professor smokes a lot of grass
She's gonna make sure we pass
That's how you pass trigonometry
Sell dope to your teacher, use nigga-nometry
On the microphone, there's not a rapper bomb as me
And under police pressure, nobody's as calm as me
Wait a minute, you know what's fucked up
Black people in college act stuck up
So self-conscious, and insecure
You wanna speak black, but you really ain't sure
Look at me, what do you see?
You see the OG, you ashamed to be
So fuck you, you pretty little rich frat boy
You can suck my dick just like that boy

[Hook x1]

[Verse 4: Afroman]

I said, ""Honey
You got some sexy looks
You need money
To buy your textbooks""
Get it wet, and I can get it hard
We can slide your vaginal credit card
Computer girl, come to my house and be my tutor girl
Before we study, can we smoke a little Buddha, girl?
Raise your shirt, lick the nipples on your hooters, girl
Open up your legs, baby you the girl
Stick out your tongue and let me shoot it, girl
You was playing with my floppy, then my hard drive downloaded
Down your throat, and fucking exploded
Tell your prejudice dad and mom
To email their comments to suck-my-dick.com
Afro's the bomb, blowing up like Vietnam

Basketball,Kurtis Blow,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus]
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball

[Verse 1]
(Now rapping basketball -- Number 1, Kurtis Blow)
Basketball is my favorite sport
I like the way they dribble up and down the court
Just like I'm the king on the microphone
So is Dr. J and Moses Malone
I like slam dunks, take me to the hoop
My favorite play is the alley-oop
I like the pick-and-roll, I like the give-and-go
'Cause it's basketball, uh, Mister Kurtis Blow

[Chorus]
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball
[Verse 2]
I used to go to dinner, then take the girl
To see Tiny play against Earl The Pearl
And Wilt, Big O, and Jerry West
Play basketball at it's very best
Basketball has always been my thing
I like Magic, Bird, and Bernard King
And number 33, my man Kareem
Is the center on my starting team

(To the hoop, y'all, watch out, watch out
In yo' face, now here comes the rest)

[Verse 3]
Clyde, Rick Barry, and Pistol Pete
Now these players could never be beat
Isiah, and Iceman too
Just give 'em the ball, and then you chalk up two
Dantley and Wilkins are on the scene
And Ralph Sampson is really mean
Bill Russell didn't take no junk
And Darryl Dawkins got a monster dunk

[Verse 4]
Tell me, were you in the joint
The night Wilt scored 100 points?
Or when Celtics won titles back-to-back
And didn't give nobody no kind of slack?
Or when Dr. J shook the whole damn team
With moves that came right out of a dream?
Or when Willis Reed stood so tall
Playing D with desire? It's basketball!
[Chorus]
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball

[Verse 5]
I get the ball and then I go and play
Like a superstar in the NBA
The forwards, the centers, and all the guards
The ones you see on the bubblegum cards
Me and homeboy would go one-on-one
'Cause playing the game is a lot of fun
Sit by the TV and watch 'em all
'Cause Kurtis Blow is rapping basketball"

Devils Got a Hold,Travis Barker,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9""]
I tossed I turn, can't sleep at night
I punch, I kick, I claw, I bite
It seems that I can’t win this fight
Hands together, if you there tell ‘em leave me alive
Devil's got a hold of me, devil's got a hold of me
Devil's got a hold of me (Devil's got a hold of me)

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
Pen in my right hand, beat on repeat
He hates when I’m writing so the thing on my nightstand
Start ringing and lighting up, vibrating and all that
I don’t wanna sell no more crack, I just wanna go perform at
The biggest place in the world cause I’m dope like them four packs
Sitting in [?] on my windowsill, making sure everything stays on chill
Right shoulder wearing all white saying “Joe chill”, left shoulder wearing red saying “pay yo bills”
So that raw metaphor
That I thought of before, I don’t remember no more
Cause I just ran out the door to meet a fiend by the store
And I heard “So you off touring?” I turn and seen his whore
That I used to fiend for that ain't never let me score
Looking at me like I’m something she ain't never ever saw
So a one-hour run somehow turned into twenty-four
Wifey callin’, I hit ignore, my priorities is poor, listen Lord
[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9""]
I tossed I turn, can't sleep at night
I punch, I kick, I claw, I bite

My life is like a box of chocolates
I work hard for it plus I am awkward, uh
I am an addict’s son, plus I am an addict son!
I am an AK addict, uh, Travis drums
I am the lead done factor
That's why I got an edge on rappers, I am redrum backwards
I see your crew and get deep so you can respect it, jump me
I signed a deal with my maker, Satan’s my record company
I got a K canon, I buy chinchillas
My bitches rocking luci-furr after they say Tannon
Now can you say tannon better yet say Dannon
The coupe look just like yogurt, I fly I ain't landing
I am the bank bandit, I got a buying problem
I goes in and walk out with all the money but I ain't rob ‘em

I’m talking, I’m talking
He talks, I listen, GPS on my position
Just living, just hanging out with the opposition
Can’t take the heat, get the fuck out the kitchen
Stupid, y'all, think it was just me
I belong in prison crazy by my own admission
On a mission to grab a podium, let me tell the public
That I’m self-destructive, I ain't looking for no help, fuck it
Look for a way to get high, I’m still alive
6 million ways to die and still a few more left to try
'til my face is red boy, pills in us, still a slight menace
We just going back and forth feeling like tennis standing underneath rain
What are we sayin’, friends and family wanted me to change
But it's too late cause my feet is getting comfy on the flames, check it
I don’t wanna be another nigga with no gold, no fame, success, nigga, no hope
Sleep in the corner in Soho, my uppers down, its no dough
Fuck it they ain't put me under yet
Think what you wish I ain't got one regret

Devil's got a hold of me (Devil's got a hold of me)
[Verse 4: Crooked I]
My automobile is not a Bentley
He knows that my pockets empty
The devil, so consequently he gotta tempt me
Standing on the block, you should not offend me
I rock a semi, like Prada Fendi, I don’t think the spirit of God is in me
Just wicked whispers of scriptures, Satan is narrating
I heard you got a safe in your crib so I’m there waiting
Nobody safe in your crib, when I’m in that staircase I’m bare-faced
Possessed by what you possess, I’m hell raising
And I just left somebody’s father a quadriplegic
Told em not to move or get shot to Egypt
He did not believe it
He’s losing blood and I’m cold blooded like I’m anemic
I need a doctor I’m psychotic maybe I should watch The Secret
Or see a Priest and I might just chill
Or will I blow ‘em outta the confession booth like on Righteous Kill
Kill, kill, kill, God when I write this will
I hope I seek some forgiveness cause my life was real

Fetus,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Yeah..
I want all my niggas to come journey with me
My name is Nas, and the year is 1973
Beginning of me, therefore, I could see
Through my belly button window, who I am...

[Verse 1]
I existed in a womb, just like an abyss
Came from behind the sun, my hands balled in a fist
Punching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix
Twitching 'cause I'm nervous, though my intended purpose
Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain
But to take on a name, my pops chose for me
Bloodstream full of indo, developing eyes
Nine-months process, infant size
A prophet in his early stages, mother in her early thirties
Was married to pops, wishing what she carried would drop
I'm not worthy to come from a woman so pure, Ann Jones
Flesh of her flesh, blood of her blood, her blood and bones
Hearing prayers, she asking for my good health
That I'd become a man and learn to make a way for myself
Nervous she was, and her paranoia got in my blood
Mixed with marijuana from my daddy's genes
Lot of screams I'm hearing, it's crazy, both parents is scrapping
I'm not even a baby, a miscarriage could happen
[Chorus]
I shot my way out my mom dukes
I shot my way out my mom dukes
I shot my way out my mom dukes
I shot my way out my mom dukes

[Verse 2]
Yo, they must wanna keep me, 'cause four months pass, I'm still alive
Guess I got what you call an Ill Will to survive
When I look hard, the lights is killing my eyes
I know when moms layin down, I get bored, start to get live
Move side to side, hear loud music and vibe
All black babies are born with rhythm, that's no lie
Solar energize, mineralize food flowing through my mother's tube
I'm covered in this thick layer of goo
Month two was the least most comfortable
My umbilical cord choking me, but month three was closer, see
That's when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic
But I was saved, he changed his mind in the last minute
Watching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well
Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell
While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall
I wondered, ""If I am born, will I be safe at all?""
This place they call the world though my view was so large
Couldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge
Month five, month six went by, hoping I'm born in July
But the Lord already figured out a date and time
September 14th, 73
Get ready, world, doctor's in the front waiting for me
Arms open 'cause they know when I drop, a lot of shit's gon' stop
See how the government start retraining cops
Month nine, I'm a week overdue, the labor induced
Pops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too
Said ""Stay calm,"" holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on
Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out
Everything is blurry, my first breath screams out
Tears pouring down my pops face, he's so proud
Wanting to hold me, but I was so bloody
They washed me off and he say, ""At least that nigga ain't ugly""
Placed me in his arms snugly, laid me on my mother
Finally, I got to see who held me in her body, she loved me
And yo, I plan to overthrow the Devil
And y'all bout to see this world in trouble, motherfuckers

What if Notorious was here, what if he was around?
Would all these niggas claim to be king, who would wear the crown?
Yo, what if ’Pac was still thuggin,’ what if he was alive?
Would all these niggas still be screamin’ out “Ride or Die”?
What if Milli Vanilli’s record never skipped on stage?
They’d be the illest con niggas in the game today
Yo, what if Jordan never had Scottie?
What if Sammie never ratted Gotti, what if New York without Giuliani?
What if Mike Tyson fought Ali in his prime?
What if Will Smith got gangsta, and start cursin’ in rhymes?
What if Erick never met Parrish? Think they’d be makin’ dollas?
What if they neva made candy paint for Impalas?
My down south niggas’ll wil’ out (Word up)
My west coast niggas’ll wil’ out (Word up)
What if computers shut down for the Y2K?
What if N.W.A. never had Dre?
What if Eminem was black, would he have sold five mill’?
Or would he be 1 out of 5 million rappers with no deal?
What if you had to pay for air? A dollar a breath
Half the hood would fuckin’ pass out and choke to death
What if hip hop was banned in 52 states?
They’d give you 5 years a piece for wreckin’ CD’s and tapes

Blowin’ chronic in the White House, smoke in the sky
What if they neva made the Coupe 5, what would I drive?
Probably a 430 drop, ruthless, wit buggy eyes
What if Red and Meth freestyled and battled on stage?
What if Daz had bald head and Onyx had braids?
What if history was changed? Slavery reversed
Would black ladies see white boys and clench they purse?
What if Diallo didn’t get shot 41 times?
What if the kids was popular that went to Columbine?
What if Ewing would have dunked it, instead of fading away?
The Knicks woulda been the champs, he wouldnta got traded away
Yo what if Run never met D would I’a been an MC?

Pokin' knob on the surface of the Earth, yes

Yeah. They doubtin', but it's expected
They don't wanna admit that a white girl just wrecked it
Suspect to not be affected by the subject to defleckment
Just cause I didn't come abject, I came correct, kid
And ya best believe that
Just cause I'm not the fuckin' imagery that
You bitches expect to come out of this music
Doesn't mean you can't open up to some new shit, bitch

Bluntly, I just wanna defuse this idea that I can't rip it up
And lay back with a glass of Coke, smilin' as I sip it up
Hearin' my shit blazin' from the local station
Famin', like I gave a virgin to Satan
You can try and break me, try hard as you can
I've gotta lotta heart like I robbed the tin man
With a stack in my hands big like it's precious
I don't really know another way to express this
A lot of you rappers are sittin' on my check list
Pop tart flex, bitch. Now it's time for breakfast
Lemme eat these bitches, no soulja boy though
I'm pushin' like a river, with my slow flow
You come troopin' through my set, stompin on my territory
Say it was an accident, better come up with a better story
You don't wanna be the one to piss me off, man
Unless you wanna be the one to make the forensics' top 10
Look, this beat is really too calm
For me to be firing off, so excuse the alarm
I should really seize the moment to appreciate livin
It's a given that us rappers are strictly self-driven
With first person statements flooding the airwaves
They all wrapped up in themselves tighter than hair braids
I'm gonna be the first to open up and see
That there's really other rappers out there better than me

Conceived immaculately was me, my mom's gift
Unwrapped right there in the room, like Christmas
My mind has been designed to do, like, distance
Run whole laps around y'all with my thoughts
You ain't hold back on yours, nah, that's my fault
Now, picture me falling
All the way to the bottom, and I'm laying there, calling
""Somebody, come help me""
Find my strength to stop drinking this poison
'Fore I drown my gift, and yeah, it's prolly unhealthy
'Cause I went so hard, and woke up sober

I roll up in the court, thinking, ""This should go quick""
On some couple-thousand-dollar-suit-type shit
From behind thousand-dollar Cartier 'scrips
I witnessed my world tumble down like bricks
Two words she slurred, and they sounded like this:
""One year""
Traveled through the room like moonlight through the darkness
Ooh, it's heartless, how could I beat two felonies?
Then turn around and lose, like—lose like this?
My lawyer saying, ""Stay calm""; people saying, ""Pray for him""
They locking my Black ass up, like Akon
My wife at the crib, going crazy
Pregnant, yelling, ""I ain’t having no more babies!""
People saying Preem ain’t fucking with me no more
Niggas in the pen, looking homo, no, no!

Fresh out of jail, feeling like Christopher Walken
The king of my city, swinging my dick as I’m walking
Up to the seven-fifty, I open the door
My cuz and, like, several bitches make up the décor
I look in, he got a cup, and he pours
I tell him, ""Nah, I’m good""—I would’ve chugged it before
I’m a new man, but I could fuck with a whore
Nigga, my dick so hard, it’s prolly touching the floor
Riding 'round in the back of a black luxury toy
Getting sucked, like, ""Niggas cannot fuck with me, boy""
When I look in the mirror, all I see is the real
Your nigga shouldn’t be here, R.I.P., if you will
I’m the moment of truth
I’m the only significant thing roaming the scene
Soon as I go in the booth, I'ma do it this time
I'm feeling really defined
Unsigned to signed, nigga, the city is mine

So don't you try, we're packing nines
We leave you dead in ditches

[Verse 1: Johnny 3 Tears]
Don't get us wrong, we only made this song
To make you feel hard when you hit the bong
And when the 40's up and then the 40's gone
To lick shots, kill cops to a hip-hop song
So pull them toasters out them holsters
Pull that shirt right off your shoulders
Pull that nine, this is how you hold her
Pull that trigger, HU soldiers
Punk, rock out on the block
Tick-tock, you cannot stop
Hip-hop like when we drop-top so hot
Johnny 3's been drinking whiskey
Trigger finger feeling frisky
When you shoot, it's so damn risky
Dead in a ditch, but I hope you miss me

That's when we ride on bitches
You fucking faggot snitches
So don't you try, we're packing nines

Wait up, hold on, oh no
Got you faggots in a choke-hold
And I think I like you, but my nine sure don't
And how many shots till you hit that floor? I bet four
""Yo Charlie, you're loco""
For sure, how many people dipping in my four-door?
""I see 3""
Bitch no, there's 5 in the back, and your girl's on my lap
She's a down-low, pro hoe for sure
What? What the fuck did I just say?
I don't ask any questions, I just spray
So hey, what I may say may be risque
Deuce made me this way
That's why you don't want no beef
'Cause me verse you is like beat the geek
So we can talk right here or in the street
But my gun talks first 'cause he loves to speak, bitch

Yo, I'm in the Coupe DeVille with the shiny rims
Playing these bitches like a violin
I got more freaks than a carnival
Pop the trunk, there's my arsenal
I got bats, gats, straps, so let's start a war
I'll eat you alive like a carnivore
My guns need nicotine, they smoke more than me
I'm with my boy Charles P, he'll go to war with me
Ooh, wee, yo King Kong swinging from a tree
Dropping on these haters, so they bleed
I'm coming at you bitches full-speed
""Funny Man, lay off the weed""
Oh, people get jealous when I'm skating on Daytons
And that's like Freddy Kruger hating on Jason
That's got the Funny Man losing his patience
Leave you dead in a ditch on Highland and Franklin

Who's down to ride, who's down to ride?
Undead, pop shots, we're down to die
Who's down to die, who's down to die?
Undead, pop shots, we're bound to ride
Black hat sideways, white-bold ""LA""
Flat on your back, leave you smoked like an ashtray
Wig split, face ripped, nod if you're listening
Shot to the cross, leave you dead like a Christian
Pop, pop
Your heart just stops, stops
When I just cock, cock my gun
'Cause I shoot for fun, that's how the west was won
I sell an ounce, and then I sell two more
Then I come to collect with the pistol 44
There's some truth to that about the weed or the gat
You may never know, just leave it at...

After every pic gotta fix my corset
I am running this shit, I am so exhausted
Batter up bitches, but approach with caution
You be talkin' slick, and honestly I could see why
You don't know me and I ain't talkin' bout T.I
Just when they thought I was done for the winter, I
Came out stuntin', I'm such a big spender, I
Two of everything but nope I'm not a gemini
My life's a movie, take me to the cinema
Take me out to the ball game
Cause you know I only fuck with ballers
Yup them is my type of niggas, shotcallers
I been around the world, I'm such a bad, bad girl

Run This Town Remix,M-Trey & CJ The Genesis,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus]
Feel it comin' in the air
Hear the screams from everywhere
I'm addicted to the thrill
It's a dangerous love affair
Can't be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who gon' run this town tonight

[Verse 1: M-Trey]
Born a killer, but raised to be benign
In a constant transformation, a maze to redefine
Raise the beat and rhyme, in efforts to do experiments
You claim to not give a fuck, I'll rip you﻿ for your carelessness
You claim to be a beast, but I'll rip you for your bearlessness
Our variance? There's 3 years between us, we like my parents kids
Hare-brained scheme, verbalize and visualize it
American dream, working rhymes and spitting for profits
You not gonna knock us, no matter how hard you try
You best tread softly like moccasins or your﻿ power is mine
I'll take it out of your soul, you keep your swag, I don't need it
I'm just supplying the beats, hitting trees like Im on a ski trip
Only from time to time, cuz the mary makes me scared of shit
Like lamps and rugs, so its like this music is my anti-drug
Phantom of, operas, masked man, you sloppy
Your raps wack, get tossed in a trash can for dropping 'em
Signing my donor card because I, give up my heart to this
Take it, whatever, you can run the town, I'll run the continent
Run where you want, but there's no safe haven
They hate it, but they memorize my moves as soon as I make em
So get it down pat, spit hard-hitting, I pound tracks
Railroad worker, nervous, I never was found that
Take a hit and bounce back, my vision is sound crack
I'm﻿ flowing so much, it only makes sense that I drown raps
How's that, got a craving for the crown and the castle
Just to validate my status like a gown and a tassel
I've graduated,﻿ sucker, Class of 09
I mastered the masters, you gassed up like a bovine
No shine, just a Timex watch wrapped around my wrist
So I, can remember to let y'all know what time it is
Timing is impeccable, balls swinging as if I was
Directing a wrecking crew, hold up, who the heck is you?
Heckling the next best with raw talent, organic
Cause panic, got it wrapped up like a gauze﻿ bandage
Gargantuan stamina like my bars tantric
Spit that shit that make you wanna run it back like Don Cannon
[Verse 2: CJ The Genesis]
It's CJ The Genesis I'm back with a vengeance
Like a wrestler I'm jam packed with an interest
More drive than a Hemi Maximum engine
When rappers hear me rap, they wanna start
Rap circles 'round 'em like (Round round round)
Try to battle me I go for (Round round round)
And I run this town town, and I get down down
Always try to block my shot, but now you fouled out
And that piss point, don't even try to fight
Killin' this since I'm alive
Transformer ironhide
Last mixtape, they said I'm tryna bite
But I'm a nerd and I'm the bomb, call me Napoleon Dynamite
These rappers is acting tough
But I'm dope, the shit that'll collapse your lungs
Yeah I know I talk shit, to the maximum
But me, I got four mixtapes to back it up, what
But I'm a let it go, I'm a let the beat rock
All y'all a mirage cuz you all seem hot
Yeah I'm gonna hold it down, I'm a keep the streets locked
DMV watch my rhymes'll have a G-Shock
So stop bein' so resistant, there is no contenders
I'm dopest spittin' in, DC, MD, all Virginia
I'm the coldest chillin', Arizona sippin' dude
And I ain't gotta waste my time tryna battle you
Because I always leave with the W like the nationals
None of y'all compatible or matchin' with my latitude
Give me some respect before you ask me 'bout my attitude
Yeah, my flow's smoother than a criminal
Gettin' rid of the ridicule and endin' like an interlude
My rhymes crazy, like they cynical
I'm lyrical, and critical
Vicious, been killin' 'em since middle school
Hittin' you with a combo
Feelin' what I'm spittin' and it's fillin' you with sorrow
Please don't hop on this instrumental tomorrow
Cuz me and M-Trey, a difficult act to follow
So good luck
[Chorus]
Feel it comin' in the air
Hear the screams from everywhere

Can't be scared when it goes down

Yeah, whoa

[Verse 1]
Gunfire left a hole in the tank, losing gasoline
Fire is on my trail and he's after me
Hope it don't get here before I get where I'm goin'
I gotta get where I'm goin'
Take off my mask to breathe
You could've been a part of a masterpiece
Fluid in the brakes was the last to leak
That's the thing

[Pre-Chorus]
Where I'm goin', I don't need my brakes (Brakes)
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

[Chorus]
The lovers needa clear the road
Oh, oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh
I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm comin' from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb
[Verse 2]
Seems cold, but baby, no, it doesn't have to be
Microwaving our metal tragedy
Watching it burn and it's beautiful and it's blue
And it's pitiful and it's through, it's the other half of me
I didn't do it, you lit the match for me
Now we're flying from the blast, baby
That's the thing

[Pre-Chorus]
Where we're going, we don't need no brakes (Brakes)
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

[Chorus]
The lovers needa clear the road
Oh, oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh
I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb
[Bridge]
Baby, we were killin' 'em
They couldn't handle the millionth degree
We were criminals
As we were burning, the world called the police
Fire department, ambulance
You can call me crazy
'Cause I believe the only move for me and you is to go out blazing

[Chorus]
The lovers needa clear the road
Oh, oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh

Yo... straight thugs on this side - it's do or die to the death
Like the terminal ill takin' they last breath
Read your last rites - God, forgive me
For the sin I'm about to commit - takin' a life
Kill or be killed, rather that than somebody else
Readin' my will - you feel what I feel, you know the deal
Keep the infrared next to my bed, one in the head
Hearin' noises, dead tired, eyes bloodshot red
Sleep with half closed eyelids
Some say it's strange, sometimes that's how strange life get
Go easy on the bottle, niggas love to see when
Niggas slippin' off point, on the strength they bet
Scopin' your ice, appraisin' it like the Diamond District Jeweler
With they hand on the biscuit
Do ya, wanna get caught lifted; or sober, so you can react quick?
Blow you off the atlas as if I caught you fuckin my wife

Apply street rules to the office, high performance

You feel me? I'll write a graphic page
Escort niggas to they grave, relate to the projects
We the black Mobb, it gets deeper than rap music

Hazard lights blinkin', gators hit the floor
Everybody watch the red carpet entrance, cameras flashin'
Just to think, that was yesterday's action
'Cause today goes either way - we came a long way
From hallway steps and hand-me-down shit
Fuck my foes, I seen the other side, NexTel cell roam
Call the chopper phone, heliport in my home
Quincy Jones posters
Wake up, guns under my pillow, I can't talk around chauffeurs
Shit is better than a novel, autobiographic
Spit it on tracks, it becomes classic
Start some, make my heart pump, spark one, I'm God son
NAStradamus, last one to blast one when the NARC's come
Know how to leave anything in thirty seconds
When you feel the heat, comin' and flee with the murder weapon
I'll release one, shot you deceased, learn your lesson

Cremate your flesh to ashes

Gotta let you know

I got the empire state now I'm working on the next part
Trying to build an empire, I'm wishing on the Death Star
I murdered the dish, I eloped with the spoon
Tri-coastal and the third coast is the moon
When it hits your eye like a get in your eye thing
And we do the I like you like like you like like thing
I can't promise I won't be dressed like a viking
When I do the whole picking you up on my bike thing
Another white rapper's CD in my spokes
I would swear ya'll converted to rap for the jokes
I spit black smoke, I'm the hip hop pope
They make anti-me PSA's cuz I'm dope
And when it's not clear you can cope, the worlds a negative iPod
You just hear 'nope'
Nights on the pavement, you just stop breathin'
On some Liz Lemon movin' back to Cleveland
Street lights people, up and down the boulevard
Don't stop believin in your journey, and I know it's hard
They call me Violet Beauregard, cuz I just blow up, no regard
All I really need is a bar to belly up to
A balcony, a star crossed lover to yell up to
So what are you up to? This weekend I'm free
Till then I'll just shine and let you find me
[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
I shine like the sun
My mouth is a gun, pop off and they run, two things like a pun
This is not just for fun and I cut with my tongue
My mouth's a Swiss army, take over your country
I run like a humvee, I don't need gas-o-line
I run on these rappers so skip the stromboli
I make these niggas say 'Great' like Tony
So how the fuck you gonna say these bitches don't know me?
How the fuck you gonna say these bitches don't know me
When you all on the tip of my dick like Moby
The wait is over, no baking soda
I saw them dudes move bricks and boulders
I saw them dudes move flats and corners
And they moved that sugar like Russell Stover
I got that green like a four leaf clover
Get rich or die tryin' like my name two quarters
Dope boys they get me, we got the same hustle till the tank on empty
And if you dope boy, better watch the Wire
And get the shit straight, turn back, retire
Cuz one in a mil turn snow to fire
You either move weight, play ball or neither

Homie help me out cause this boy is a drug dealer
Now I'm flyin' high cause my gift grew wings
And now I'm flyin' down like the cool crew winds

Whoo
Here come the Men in Black
It's the MiBs, uhh, here come the MiBs
Here come the Men in Black (Men in Black)
They won't let you remember
Nah nah nah

[Verse 1: Will Smith]
The good guys dress in black remember that
Just in case we ever face to face and make contact
The title held by me: MiB
Means what you think you saw, you did not see
So don't blink be what was there is now gone
Black suit with the black RayBans on
Walk in shadow, move in silence
Guard against extra-terrestrial violence
But yo we ain't on no government list
We straight don't exist, no names and no fingerprints
Saw somethin' strange, watch your back
'Cause you never quite know where the MiBs is at
Uh and
[Chorus: Coko]
Here come the Men in Black (Men in Black)
Galaxy defenders (Oooh, oooh, oooh)
Here come the Men in Black (Men in Black)

[Verse 2: Will Smith]
Uh uh, uh uh, now
From the deepest of the darkest of night
On the horizon bright light enters sight, tight
Cameras zoom on the impendin' doom
But then like ""boom"" black suits fill the room up
With the quickness talk with the witnesses
Hypnotizer, neuralyzer
Vivid memories turn to fantasies
Ain't no MiBs, can I please
Do what we say that's the way we kick it
Yaknahmean? I see my noisy cricket get wicked on ya
We're your first, last and only line of defense
Against the worst scum of the universe
So don't fear us, cheer us
If you ever get near us, don't jeer us, we're the fearless
MiBs, freezin' up all the flack
(What's that stand for?) Men in Black

Uh, and
The Men in Black
Uh, and
The Men in Black
Let me see ya just bounce it with me, just bounce with me (Bounce with me)
Just bounce it with me c'mon
Let me see ya just slide with me, just slide with me (Slide, slide, slide, slide)
Just slide with me c'mon
Let me see ya take a walk with me, just walk it with me (Walk with me)
Take a walk with me c'mon

Alright check it, let me tell you this in closin'
I know we might seem imposin'
But trust me if we ever show in your section
Believe me, it's for your own protection
'Cause we see things that you need not see
And we be places that you need not be
So go witcha life, forget that Roswell crap
Show love to the black suit, 'cause that's the Men in
That's the Men in

Cant Be Friends,Tyga,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Where to begin when love ends on a bad note
Or being honest make the trust grow
Apparently it make you argue more
The more things you throw
DVD’s and my dirty clothes
Telling me shutup, I’m leaving you
The reason you ain’t even got one
It wasn’t true
Look at her, now look at you
I know we ain’t perfect
But I made our world utopia
How could you not notice?
In denial cause you’re used to losing
Put me through it, ain’t the answer to it
Put on my Vans, take a walk to cool it
But you was always a test and I’m a student
Trying my best
But I never get the right solutions
I swear it’s one thing after another one
Fuck it I’m done
Am I done?
Mother say I’m too young
But what that mean?
I took a chance and now I’m playing
The game of love
Now it’s never ending
Forever chasing
That first feeling
On a quest for a woman's treasure
They keep it hidden
I gotta find love even if it kill me. (I gotta find love even if it kill me)
Can run into it anyday
But knowing me I prolly never meet
Only speak when a fan speak
Never chatting with a stranger
But there’s something about this girl that got me thinkin’. (Damn)
I-Phone accidentally called her
Says hello?
Silent moment
Man, I been missing you
And I know you miss me too
She sighed then she said
Thought we’d be together ’till the end
And this the end
So good luck with your career
Cause we can no longer be friends
Anymore. (Damn)"

Yeah, rapping is my hobby, my house has a lobby
My bitches act snobby, because I feed them thousands
I know that didn't rhyme but I'm only being honest
You can't pay me in cash now I'm only seeing commas
I swear I got on Saks Fifth boxers right now
I'm tryna milk the game as if the game was a cow
I had an Eddie Bauer Expedition seven years ago
My grandma used to tell me that she swear I been here before
I used to wear braids like Jason's Lyric, whoa
Spent a bundle on the cross because I'm spiritual
And I can never pass a physical, I stay high
High as the voice of Akon
And make mine a straight with no chase
Hold the ice, I got enough on anyway
And when they see the boy, they hyperventilate
I got 'em running after me like I'm about to win a race

Look, never entertain the suckers with the hating bid'ness
(Nah, we never did that) I'm on a yacht playing table tennis
Expensive linin, women sinning
Adultery, compulsively

The door close to the booth, I feel like a caged lion
Yeah let me loose, now let me get 'em
Cause I ain't going back and fourth like badminton
No, I will never drop the ball like bad mitten
And I ain't being conceited, I'm just admitting
I flow cocky, got hand rhythm
I got this bitch on lock like San Quentin
I'm tough daddy, what's popping gangster?
I'm tryna keep my pockets fat like opera singers
So sharp, if you touch me, I'll chop your fingers
I'm on top of the game like helicopter angles
I see you niggas, I hope you having fun

Take a shit in yo' yard, take a piss on yo' broad
Make a list of yo' boys, and go and murder them all, huh
Life is short, yeah a midget told me that
And I always thought I was fly like I had a pigeon on my back
But I got decisions on my back, vision on my back
So don't you try to run up on me, I got precision with that gat
I don't rat-tat-tat-tat-tat, all I got to do is tat

And as far as I'm concerned
We about to bring that real soul back to the game
John Legend on the backgrounds by the way
Let's go

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
From what I hear Kanye is killing the game very bad
My girl rocking the little lamb that Mary had
A l ittle bit of Ghost’s style mixed with Mos' style
I'm versatile I'm the poster child
Getting cheese so I'm suppose to smile, get it
We making hits like Sosa now, hit it
And I hate when girls acting bougie as hell
And I already seen them naked like Blu Cantrell
If I talk to people like they stupid as hell
Do that mean God gone make my kids be stupid as well?
Well, our father please forgive me
I'm sinner slash winner slash soul inventer
[Refrain: Kanye West]
It's so soulful man
It's so soulful man
So soulful man
And when you hear it, is where it feels like soul food man
It was so soulful man
It's so soulful man
It's so soulful man
And right here is where it feels like soul food man

[Verse 2: Khayree]
Look, my mami don't be playing
'Cause she know I got my game intact
I spit them lines that make a rapper have a brain attack
And chickens know I'm gonna do it how I wanna do it
And miss communication, no we never run into it
I got chicks like Simone and Cala
Stay with lip gloss and Fendi bag beside her
And your girl said you ain't ready for me
I'm in love so Mommy got me singing Tina Marie
How you bomb in Giovanni, she in Gucci and Prada
Chilling in a Mirada, studying like a scholar
So I don't even bother, I be popping my collar
I can get into your soul when I call you tomorrow
Come on
[Refrain: Kanye West]
It's so soulful man
It's so soulful man
So soulful man
And when you hear it, is where it feels like soul food man
It was so soulful man
It's so soulful man

And right here is where it feels like soul food man

[Bridge: John Legend]
I know you got a lot of stress today
Let's hit the party like we just got paid
And if you really want to get away
And say yeah, yeah
Got people on your back constantly
And you never get a second to breathe
You know you gotta get a way with me so say
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Consequence]
I'mma worry about the trade then ball then try and trade it all
I'd rather catch up on my paper and invade the mall
You sore losers picked the wrong guy to take the fall
I probably trade in the fall what they made in the fall
Went from a never quite was to an overnight was
Cause the way I flip metaphor nobody quite does
By the time I leave the club, I'm wearing a public arms
Cause he must have been a pro the way see the pros and cons
They calling this the army, money boys are we
Say jay b hopping down when I'm trying do my laundry
But I ain't even sorry for the way I get my dough
Cause J, Khayree and Kan got that food for your soul

It's so soulful man
It's so soulful man

Peace to my man Tune for giving his man room
Now we hittin’ switches 'til the Spring Break, Cancun
Get it? Nah forget it, Soo Woo I live it
Made the letter B more famous than a Red Sox fitted
But that was suicide, I don’t live in Judas’ eyes
Half of these rappers weren’t trappin’ when I was choppin’ the do or die
Suge had me in, I went Puffy like Zab Judah eye
Dre called, told my baby momma “won’t you decide”

Before I turn on ‘em I kill Satan
And stick my red flag in the ground it’s Red Nation

Get thrown in the backwoods, Los Angeles
Home of the scandalous, pimp, hoes and gamblers
98 degrees on Christmas, nigga we rollin’ cannabis
Swisha sweet ain't it, I told her I’m Charles Louboutin
The bitch fainted, pulled her panties down, stain it

Look, simply said, I'm a pioneer of my area /
Wrote my first line on some paper, I thought I'd share it witcha /
I got a mic in 10th grade because of a homie /
Who didn't need it, I needed it cause I ain't have no money /
To buy a mic of my own, I wasn't rich like the other kids /
But my mama tried, she ain't doubt me like the others did /
Made an account on MySpace so I can publicly /
Share my mentality with others, all they did was fuck wit me /
Lies on top of lies, all these comments used to fuck wit me /
But I had someone at all times, I was luckily /
Able to make a change in my game, I switched my flow up /
Spit my first sick verse, felt like I had thrown up /
I had the voice of a boy, I'm finally grown up /
Got my name around but I don't feel like I am known enough /
Glorification's my dedication in progress /
Tryna be remembered, damn it's a long process /
I hope my music will help me become a better man /
Cause there's so many things about me I don't understand /
& if you think you know me then you got the upper hand /
Crying to my grandma reaching out for an elder's hand /
I swear I was depressed when she left us /
But God has kept me strong since she left, I'm glad He blessed us /
There's only one thing that I regret
Not going to say good bye in the hospital 'fore she left
Every time I take step pass her door, I think see her /
Maybe that's my conscious telling me I now need her /
However I'm happy that God freed her /
I know grandpa was smiling the moment that he had seen her /
I know they're up in heaven & they're happy now /
Life just kinda hit me really hard wit a crappy smile /
How many people can tell you that they enjoy life? /
But how many people can tell you that they it enjoy it right? /"

One, two, three, four

Oh, wine cooler

[Verse 1]
Johnny Ryall is the bum on my stoop
I gave him fifty cents to buy some soup
He knows the time with the fresh Gucci watch
He's even more over than my mayor, Ed Koch
Washing windows on the Bowery at a quarter to four
'Cause he ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Livin' on borrowed time and borrowed money
Sleepin' in the street, there ain't a damn thing funny
With the hand-me-down food, and the hand-me-down clothes
A rockabilly past of which nobody knows
Makes his home all over the place
He goes to sleep by falling down on his face
Sometimes known as the leader of the homeless
Sometimes drunk, and he's always phoneless
Sleepin' on the street in a cardboard box
He's better off drinkin' than smokin' the rocks (Well)
[Chorus]
Johnny Ryall, Johnny Ryall
Kickin' uptown, kickin' downtown, kickin' crosstown
Johnny Ryall, Johnny Ryall

[Verse 2]
He drinks where he lies, he's covered with flies
He's got the hand me down Pumas and the tie dyes
Well, you go upstate, and you get your head together
Thunderbird is the word, and you're light as a feather
Detox at the flop house, no booze allowed
Remember the good old days with the rockabilly crowd
Memphis is where he's from (in Tennessee)
He lives in the street, but he's no bum
He's a rockabilly star from the days of old
He used to have teeth all filled with gold
He got a platinum voice, but only gold records
On the bass was Boots and on the drums was Checkers
Louis Vuitton with the Gucci guitar
Johnny Ryall, who do you think you are?

He drinks a lot of liquor, but he don't drink piss
He paid his dues playing the blues

Trying to be the illest dad a kid’ll meet
For the love of patter of little feets
It kind of gets you right here, don’t it?
Mess with mine, your life’ll be a nightmare, won’t it?
Left the 9 at home, I hope my lady don’t pawn it
Doggone it, it ain’t even got no serial number on it
For God’s sakes, spare the god the heartache
Mentally scar a smart snake before he start to fake
They love to hate him, on a certain level, need him
Geedorah known to make a deal with the Devil and beat him
Then proceed to sip a shot of vodka like methadone
The mic said to the headphone, “We just want to be left alone
So we can get it on to an unknown metronome”
Don’t worry: will he get to zone?  Crews best to get their chrome
Pay your overdue dues to King Geedorah, better known
Getting grown, trying to get on the mic—instead, it’s blown
Too many freaks, not enough circuses
Only a true geek could peep how much work this is
So put that in your blunt hole and puff it
Stunts at the gun so y’all might as well stuff it
Or can it, abandon ship, I’ll miss y’all
And if they insist, beat ‘em all like fistball
The news watch never stops
From the city it mocks, “Who that on the idiot box?”
“Well if it ain’t Geedorah, alert the media
Maker of the beats that’s a real hurt-feeder
Sometimes he come through to let you know he see ya
Don’t let him have to call Smog to head-to-toe graffiti ya”
Just flew in from Dallas, and, boy, is my talons calloused
And what’s a girl like you doing here amongst the island’s foulest?
A cat in Wonderland who found Alice
Gee her with the flows by the gallon or the chalice
Everybody wilding out, trying to be the wildest
And refuse to acknowledge why this shit is so childish
“One, two, one, two” play, I wonder what they do today
Besides repeat their choruses more times than Confucius say
And start too many songs with “Uh” or “Uhhh”
Yeah, I hear you, soldier, I told ya like, “No duh!”
It’s King Geedorah, the no-ass-getter
Still qualify as a world-class spitter
Shift to shitter, write a rhyme in the nighttime
Make a beat taste like wine like I spiked mine
And I heard it through the mic line
That crews don’t even write rhymes
And I hope that they get much better
Yes, I doo-ooo-ooo-ooo
I pledge that, every day I rep
Know the ledge from every step
And I hope that they do get better
Yes, I doo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Geedorah known to stack flows back-to-back-to-back flows
Like, “And now back to our show”
In other news, people had enough of them other crews
Up their dues, snuff a fews, cut a fuse

Got the naked lady just painted up

Coats of candy got 'em saying I'm, delicious

And I feel like Master P had me not taking minor digits

Screw taught us stay authentic and they gon' love your jams
Watts taught us Keep on mashin' and we gon' run the land
J prince and Drake are the reasons you had to become a fan
And the only way we ain't gon' win is when we under planned
Throw a prayer up for Japan, I swear the daily news be having me trippin'
Everybody that got a cross hanging off they neck is not a Christian

It’s been a long fuckin day, what you tryna do?
Don’t start little homie, because I’m not in the mood
I’m a hungry motherfucker, and you looking like food
Go from chopped and screwed to chopped and chewed
(x2)

[Verse 1]
Aiyo, you see him coming towards us, just let him pass us by
Twizzle why’d you kill him man he was just a passerby
I don’t give a fuck and I’m killing all pedestrians
And I hope tonight that I can get up in a lesbian
On my hands I got bleach mixed with other chemicals
And the way I chop the bodies you’d think they identical
And I killed an octopus just for the tentacles
You think that this shit is crazy I think it’s incredible
But so regrettable, cause in about 5 minutes I’ll probably forget it though
I was covered in blood and I had to take my shirt off
Had nothing to wear so I took my doggy’s fur off
Now I’m not cold when I’m walking through the park
And as for my dog let’s just say now he doesn’t bark
So don’t make a remark or I’ll murk you in the parking lot
In broad daylight I don’t care if it’s dark or not
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
And they always telling me ""Twizzle man you just need to relax""
So I turned back and I’m telling them all to shut they traps
Cause I don’t wanna hear no noises, these are your choices
Cause in my head I just keep hearing these voices
And you don’t even really wanna know what they telling me
Ya'll ain't like developmentally ready to step to me or even accidentally upset me
Shouldn’t have left me standing on my balcony all night practicing alchemy
I’m cooking something up for anybody’s who doubting me
I’m equipped with versatality so try and battle me
And I’m ripping apart of your entire anatomy
Tell that boy to take that battery out of your back
In fact, beating me it can’t be done
You wouldn’t be strong enough if your skeleton was adamantium
You think your fancy huh well this is real life
You wanna see real then I’ll show you what real feels like

Given a little time, Jersey City will prevail

Of course I'm sicker, my flow off the Richter
I'm forcin niggas to get a bigger scale
I gotta excel, so I sell X
You're like Nextel, who you gon' tell next? (who?)
Can't grind off packs cause y'all watchin 'em
I ain't see a dime off rap cause y'all droppin 'em
I go hard on tracks, ain't get a buck from it
And as far as rats I hope the fucks plummet (fall)
I like to mix karate with gunplay
So all you dumb chumps get nunchucked to gun-butted

While they at rock bottom, the poor guys can't even fall off (Joey!)
I'm all Spartan, avoid the four sparkin

[Spoken: Lil Wayne]

I'm watchin' TV the other day, right? Got this white guy on there talking 'bout Black guys. Talking about how young Black guys are targeted. Targeted by who? America.

You see, one in every one hundred Americans are locked up. One in every nine Black Americans are locked up. And see, what the white guy was trying to stress was that the money that we spend on sending a motherfucker to jail, a young motherfucker to jail, would be less to send his or her young ass to college.

See, and another thing the white guy was stressing was that our jails are populated with drug dealers. You know, crack cocaine? Yeah, stuff like that. Meaning, due to the laws we have on crack cocaine and regular cocaine, the police are... only... I don't want to say only right, but, shit... only logic by riding around in the hood all day, and not in the suburbs, because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood. And um, you know, the other thing is mostly found—you know where I'm going... But why bring a motherfucker to jail if it's not gonna stand up in court? Because this drug ain't that drug. You know; Level 3, Level 4 drugs, shit like that.

Mhm... I guess it's all a misunderstanding. And um, I sit back and think, well shit, us young motherfuckers, you know, that one in every nine: We probably only selling the crack cocaine just because we in the hood, and it's not like your suburbs. We don't have the things that you have. Why? I really don't want to know the answer. But, I guess we just misunderstood, huh? Yeah.

You know, we don't have room in the jail now for the real motherfuckers, the real criminals, you know: sex offenders, rapists, serial killers, shit like that. Oh, don't get scared, don't get scared. I know you saw one of them sex offender papers! Don't trip, he live right on the end of your block, mhm. Yeah, that nigga live right down the street from you. Sex offender, on the Level 3 drug. Convicted, ex-con, yeah, check him out.

And what you got, you got daughters, son, what you got? Yeah, well you know what? (coughing) Don't stop the track. That's the good weed.

You know what? I have a fucking daughter. You understand me? And why the fuck would you bring my neighbor to jail just because the reason why he live next door to me ain't the reason why I live next door to him? Meaning, he didn't rap his way to my fuckin' neighborhood. He sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood. You move him out, bring him to jail for life, and then, you move in a sex offender. Hahaha. Then give me a paper. Haha. Is that a misunderstanding? 'Cause I don't understand it.

Another thing. Let me take my glasses off, 'cause I want to see the reaction on the faces when I say this. Uhh... Mr. Al Sharpton: here's why I don't respect you, and nobody like you.

Mhm, see, you're the type that gets off on gettin' on other people, haha. That's not good, no homo, and rather un-human, I should say. I mean, given the fact that humanity, well, good humanity, rather, to me, is helping one another, no matter your color or race. But this guy, and people like him, they'd rather speculate before they informate, if that's a word, haha. You know, ""'spec before check,"" anyway. Meanin', I'd much rather you talk to me first and see if you can learn an opinion before you make one. Just my thought of good humanity, Mr. Sharpton, haha.

Hold on, I ain't finished wit' you man. Gotta pluck the ashes, mhm, hold on, um...

Mr. Sharpton, and anyone like you: You don't know me. So, if you're not gonna try to, then what you say or think about me, or whatever I do, is totally Casper the Friendly Ghost to me. And, it doesn't make you a good person to criticize before you improvise. Doesn't necessarily make you a bad person neither, but the characteristics fall heavily into bad's way, haha!

But, since I am human, I am good and bad as well. But I try my hardest to stay good. And some of the things I do and say may be bad, or just not too good. But I do try. So with that said, I don't fault you. I mean, you're only human. Good or bad. but I also don't respect you, and I don't care if that's good or bad, haha.
You see, you are no MLK, you are no Jesse Jackson. You are nobody, to me. You're just another Don King... with a perm. Just a little more political. And that just means you're a little un-human than us humans. And now, let me be human, by saying fuck Al Sharpton, and anyone like him.

Fuck if you understand me. I love being misunderstood. Haha, why? 'Cause I live in the suburbs, but I come from the hood. Bring the hook in!

But oh, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood"

Three coacher Devilles with him, a whitey, it's pathetic
Ragged monkey face, faggot dead it
Coming through the stairs with blow in his mouth, desperate
Watching him looking stupid, son know we on foot patrol
Come through the hole, niggas is spooking
Seven hundred shots, all leather gloves, six thugs
Two had a mask on, he took 'em off what
We got you now, nigga, blowing you down, niggas is foul
This is trauma king, by any means, blaow
They pushed his face in, fell out his Saucony's, snatched his homeys
Took his Glock, you gon' be my tenderoni?
[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Uh!
Metal exchanges, the hood's the gun range
Everybody's a target depending on how you aim
Dice games and ice chains, pendant spelling your name
OG's setting the wrong example, tellin' the same
Look at Shorty Shitstain, grew up to be a fucking mess
Before his clique came, he bang and never tucked his chest
Closet full of them thangs, he caught the gun connect
Riding 'round with ''A'' and ''Lil' Nino'' and they want respect
Son cool, Nino want the show
Everybody know they straight shippin' hood bitches to the bungalow
Pillow talkin' let the birds hawk it
Chattin' bout what happened, and when and what they coming back in
Champagne slackin', traffickin' while they travel
Word got back the old time friends and snakes rattled
Two different 'burbans, but the one that dropped the birds got tailed.. Information for the ones that like to steal, got mailed
Pussy power made the plans sour
Apartment full of party powder, outside a stakeout for hours
Click clacks from big gats and rags
Soon as the door squeaks they runnin' up on the grass
Bang, flash! Shots ride on path of broken glass
Comedy laughs, while they haul ass with the bags
Legends in my hood played back, twin Benzes whippin' in black
And that was like the old Maybach"
Piss On Your Grave,The Coup,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
Uhhhh!!
I wanna piss on your grave!
Make me feel alright!
Yaa Yaa Yaa!!

Uhhhh!!
I wanna piss on your grave!
And it feels alright!
Yaa Yaa Yaa!!

[Verse 1 - Boots Riley]
While you was eating T-bone steaks in palatial estates
Ornate with gates that automate
So those you hate could only spectate
I was kissing my mate through iron grates while the guards wait
50 cent rate for making license plates
My Paper Mate pen shake
Vibrate from 808 quakes over breaks dug outta crates
That sag from weight of the vinyl plates
Girls work till they back ache
And they breasts can't lactate
You're laughing to the bank
Smiling, showing all your plaque flakes
Contesting, contesting 1,2,3
Never shoulda been put in the penitentiary
Boots from The Coup would like to say
I'll shove these food stamps down your throat
Just to block your airway
And that's the fair way cause every day you're on a moolah mission
Military killing millions til you're low on ammunition
Bodies beyond recognition, twist in complex positions
Then their kids work in your factories and die of malnutrition
See, your net profit stats hold some murderous facts
But if you listen to the news you mighta heard it was blacks
You got us herded in shacks
I got the pertinent tax
How 'bout the one for when I bust my ass and you relax
I'll hit your head with an axe, play soccer with your brain
To make it official, slice your jugular vein
Still writing songs that my momma could sang
And if you feel some yellow drips on your skull, it ain't rain
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
That bitch ass on the front of a buck never gave a fuck
He forced his black women slaves to give him dick sucks
And when he'd bust a nut, he'd laugh and cackle
Let the leather whip crackle, send 'em back to pick tobacco shackled
Wouldn't give 'em nil, so his homies stacked bills
Fought on flat lands and hills to keep the British out the till
Scrill kept Washington dumping em in ditches
So slave owning son of a bitches could keep their riches
Which is how the war got funded with two centuries of juice
Of black slaves bodies and the profits they produced
You could deduce that these men might win
Fit right in, and make rights then
Just for rich white men
So they quit fighting and wrote up a declaration
Protective decoration for they business operations
A gorilla pimping nation -- no freedom, just savage
The whole world's ravaged from their hunger for the cabbage
Your fifth period history teacher
Telling lies like a tweaker
Bump this song through the speaker, watch they face get weaker
'less they righteous and they kicking the facts
They gon' smile cause this shit is on wax
One thing I gots to ask:
George Washington, down in hell can you see me?
I'm standing on your grave and I'm finsta take a pee-pee!
[Interlude]
Tour guide: Excuse me sir, did you say you have to pee?
Boots: No, I said, ""I love it here in D.C""
Tour guide: Well, anyway folks, continuing on with the tour
We're here at the Arlington National Cemetary
Behind all of you, right where the gentleman with the Afro is standing
Is the grave of of America's first and greatest hero, our first President --
[Sound of pants unzipping]
George Washingt..
[Sound of pissing]
Ohh, uh-uhhhh
[Cameras click]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Knock knock motherfucker, yes once again
I'll make you pay for your sins in the trunk of your Benz
See, you's an always fitted, always acquitted parasitic leech
Can't be burned off my back with no fiery speech
Your hands is soft as a peach cause you ain't never did work
Been rich ever since your daddy's dick went squirt
Have you ever hurt from your back?
Ducked from rat-a-tat-tats?
Seen your mama on crack? Lived in a Pontiac?
Drank baby Similac so you could have protein
Just for enough energy to hustle up some mo' green?
I could paint some mo' scenes, verging on the obscene
But I'd rather show up at your palace with a mob scene
I spoke to my accountant, who spoke to my attorney
Who counseled my financial advisor on a gurney
It's about fifty dollars, and that's almost like a sale
Cause it costs too damn much to let your rich ass inhale
True liberation ain't no word in the head
I'm yelling, ""Murder 'em dead!"" for some fish, steak, and bread
You pay me 10 g's a year, I pay you fifteen million hundred?!
Sorry, you just ain't in the budget
Look at the birdie, now..

Rough,The Game,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Game: Verse 1]
What do you do when life gets too hard for you
Shed tears or is that to hard for you
I’m just a man, reflection of my family
Meaning you ain’t gotta have one to understand me
I got kids, I got friends
Only difference between me and you is I don’t care bout this benz
I care about Will he was dying and he needed me
I care about the Grammy they gave Missy they cheated me
But they cheated Drake, they cheated Justin Bieber
Guess America don’t like Canada we some fuckin heathens
Game can’t watch his mouth thats why his daddy beat him
Same mouth made him millions and now his daddy need him
Finally got a black president look at how they treat him
Kids starvin in Africa why only Oprah feed them?
What happened to the music that I know
I miss it, you too, I guess we feel like Bono

[Hook]
Is it my fault, cause I tried?
Gave it my all. Hip Hop died
Where do we go now, when it's over?
I'm lookin' all around
Can this be, the aftermath?
[Game: Verse 2]
The living, the dead
These Dre beats, my head
My life, featuring Wayne
That was Jayceon, this is Game
Adjacent to the fame ain't chasing a damn thing
So tonight let all of your pain be champagne
I can't tame my killers but I can tell them chill
I might give you a pass depending how I feel
The bi polar bear
They said the end of the world is coming, I know it’s here
Cuz California cold this year
Detox, R.E.D
MC’s dead
Kill them softly like Lauren Hill
Skin heads goin K-K-Krazy cuz a nigga in a foreign wheel
We all born to die, some of us born to kill
If that don’t wake you up I hope tomorrow morning will

[Yelawolf: Verse 3]
Never I thought I’d see the day when I, would roll up in the parking lot
And have people coming up to me for a photograph of the shit I talk about
Yela can I get an autograph Alabama so proud that we just can’t wait
Congrats on the Shady deal, any news on the release date?
I told them what I can, shake another hand sign another autograph it’s cool
Got fans gettin inked up, dedicated to me I love you too
Got 3000 sold, the spirit of rock and roll
Long barrel .38 loaded I’m John Wayne in Geronimo
So I dont really know whats got some these pussies panties in a ball
Cuz I never done shit but get better and believing in God
And leaving my mom at 15 with a dream and a cross
A cross that I didn’t see until I was nailed to it for believing at all
That I could ever be accepted the way that I saw it
I mean I knew it would be hard, but really come on y'all
Oh I’m a redneck? FUCK YOU tatted on my neck
I’ll sip high life in a can at the Grammys now add that to my rep

Yeah I remember it so clearly
Rappin’ to my pop about the cars and the clothes
Shrimp and the lobster that I heard about
Like word of mouth
The UGK tape and Scarface will turn ya out
I was like 13 thirsting for a good beat
Scoping for a studio talkin’ bout I spit heat
Like Ball & G, on that pimp type shit
Three 6 had me crunk on that late night tip

I played ball for a minute, did I mention wasn’t in it
Writing rhymes on my glove so I will never forget em
Had to quit it, didn’t feel it back in high school
Rather write poems, known for flowing, thats what I do
Couldn’t be little Zac forever, peace to my big brother
Follow ya dreams baby, thats word to my grandmother
When I hear the streets tappin’, my beats kickin’ my flow
I overhear the same shit they always say before (he’s dreaming)

[Verse 3]
I told them call me KRIT, they told me change my name
Don’t be alarmed if you don’t make it, thats just part of the game
Besides I ain't rapping about dope nor did I sell it
I guess the story of a country boy just ain't compelling
A&R’s searching for a hit, I just need a meal
Couldn’t afford to pay the rent, but passed up on the deal
Cause, it wasn’t right sometimes you gotta wade the storm
In a class of my own, but I was scared to raise my arm
Like, this my dream, this my life, I sacrificed it all
Except my soul in the firm belief there is a God
Watching out, when all the others used to doubt
Felt my pain and pointed down and said “Son, your time is now”
I think my grandma pulled some strings on the low
Thats between her and the lord I’ll never know
For those that caught me in the Spin, in Complex magazine, XXL, the Vibe and whatever inbetween
It’s safe to say that dreams come true I guess
Don’t let nobody tell ya, try for yourself
Just know that I was once considered just a dreamer
But I paid my dues and turned so many doubters to believers
They used to say
They used to say
They used to say
They used to say

I don’t care if it is a dream I’ve got to believe in something, my love
What can I do, what have I got to lose

This is real life from long nights
Niggas like me I bounce back it's alright (Alright)
Base for your face two times you don't see no actin'
All they do is rhyme words, such typical rappers
I was defined by the struggle, Metro phones
Got pictures of my partners that died, people like me
Cried a whirlwind came from drugs and guns
Used to call them cocaine numb (Numb, real baseheads)
Niggas killas drive-by
The AK-47 took them little kids lives
All these young niggas, it's like a movie
Putting dots on they shirt, talking about Coogi (No)
This is change (Yes), please excuse me
I rep BasedWorld, nigga, please don't lose me, Lil B

I'm a rabblerouser, the other rebels they crowd around her
To rebel levels are leveled up in the several thousands
Records house her like Africa read the jungle brothers
This is for townships, backpackers and seasoned lovers of music
Lil B's in love with the music
So leave a brother to use it, lead the public to new shit
See the puppets ain't do it, you keepin' up what they viewin'
You see the numbers they doin', you feedin' us, the three of us
Plus 9th more than Kanye cuff dykes or cuff mics
This my nigga Phonte, Based God, the above types
Above the boundaries of music, the counter-culture groovin'
The kind of combination got you puzzled, Culkin/Kunis
We do what we like so hit the comment section
Do this for life, so what we got in Common, resurrection
We tryin' to bring everythin' back, man
Everything and that includes

[Verse 3: Lil B]
Swag
Remember times I was strugglin' off my mindset
Remember that time will fly like a caterpillar
Graduate, I ain't even know that I shoulda
Sometimes don't hate when you know I coulda
Now I'm about to give back to the people, more than ever
Livin' like now or never
Sometimes people get distracted by the outside hate
Life turned into appetizers
And I tell my niggas, be a man of your word
I be fakin' bottomless, fuck it sleepin'
Watch your sleep cause them suckas will trick ya, thinking about niggas
Don't change for nothin'
I go back niggas still swing J's and sufferin'
I'm moving up in the world, gettin' humble as well
Stupid motherfuckers can't tell this real B

Base for your face, base for your face, base for your face, base for your face
Base for your face, base for your face, base for your face, base for your face
Real complex rap
Yeah, I just speak, you connect the dots

[Verse 4: Phonte]
I'm back on my shit, pa
Back on my incline, Phontigga raisin' the benchmark
The young lions gave me a kick start
So here it is, pyramid schemin' on y'all niggas like Quixtar
The drug test flow got you pissed off
So many say the game is contaminated, you niggas is animated
Meanin' you not real, fake nigga you Pixar
A short story, Toy Story 3, where the kids are
Now we have lift off, so I'ma just stay firin'
Phontigallo low, stay flyin'
Y'all wannabe niggas stay tryin'
But God is my God, don't be ashamed
Swallow your pride just like a gay lion, roar
Came back for a taste, Lil B, Phontigga back on the case
Feeling like G money in my space
They ain't come back for the cocaine
They came back for the BASE"

So I'm watchin' her fine ass, walk to my bedroom
And thought to myself ""that's the shape of things to come""
She said, ""Why in the club, you don't make it precipitate?
You know, make it rain when you can make it thunderstorm?""
I'm like, ""Why?""
The world needs sun, the hood needs funds
There's a war goin' on and half the battle is guns
How dare I throw it on the floor
When people are poor
So I write like Edgar Allen to restore, got a cord
Umbilical attached to a place I can't afford
No landscaping, or window draping
This old lady told me, if I ain't got nothin' good, say nathan
That's why I don't talk much
I swear it don't cost much to pay attention to me
I tell like it is, then I tell it how it could be
The hood be
Requesting my services oh don't get nervous it's
Step yo game up time, these ain't them same old rhymes
Designed to have you dancin' in some club
Niggas ride to me, women be off in they tub
Ex-foliating with they poms-poms, yelling, ""Go, 3000!""
I'm in my whatever bumpin' N.W.A, a hunnid miles and
Runnin' Runnin' Runnin' Runnin'
Summon, woman, come in
Sit down, heard you need some plumbin'
Done in, I'm in a swell mood
Or rather swole mood
Until she told me that she told dude
That she'll be back, she's going to the store
I didn't know she had a boyfriend, so the door
I pointed her to
I said, ""Call me when y'all break up""
""I don't fuck nobody, bitch, and never owned a Jacob,""
Know what time it is
Nigga just tryin' to live like a nigga supposed to live
If I still drank that malt liquor, I'd pour the beer
On the ground for niggas not around;
I started off starvin', now they got me out here Brett Favre'n
Tryna' see if I still got it... (got it...)
I guess it's like a bike, think about it... (Uh uh oh no)

Judas,Ja Rule,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Yeah... ahhhh, ahhh
Yeah, I'ma tell y'all a little story
It's a classic tale of love, hate, jealousy.. betrayal
Judas... forgive them father for, they know, not what, they do
(Yeah, let's go.. let's talk to 'em, haha)

[Verse 1]
Dear Judas, what it do homie?
How you feeling these days nigga, a little lonely?
No D, no Y, no E, no Kiss, no Styles
No Ruff, no Ryders, Double R's finest
We grown men nigga, I tried to put it behind us
But niggas always mistake weakness and kindness
Til it gets to violence
Then it's too late to silence
The wolves from howling, the gunshots, the sirens
The mind set of a nigga when niggas got problems
Instead of resolve 'em, rather result to revolvers, to be honest
Betrayal's a blessing, like a promise that's broken
I see through lies more than often
Look in the mirror, can you lie to your own portrait?
If so, then look a little closer
And tell me who you see
And if you proud of what you saw
'Cause who you are is Judas
[Chorus]
After all that we've been through (I never thought it'd be you)
Trust in all I thought I knew (guess I didn't know you well)
Tell the lies to hide the truth (should have known they wasn't true)
Who would ever think that you'd (turn out to be a Judas)

[Verse 2]
Dear Judas, or should I say Judai?
I wanna say I miss you, but that might be a lie
And I can't lie to myself too much self pride
I can lie to anyone else, at times even God
Now you claim heartbreak and emotional scars
But I say you was getting while it's good 'til it's gone
But you of all people should know my lights don't turn off
And this is my sitcom, you're just a spin-off
And I don't mean to be harsh, but sister you're lost
One like Jay and Beby, Fay' and Biggie
It really hurt when you said you can't throw any
M's up, baby 'cause it's hurting your image, really?
Have you looked at yourself lately?
If not, then look a little clearly
And tell me who you see
And if you're proud of what you saw
'Cause who you are is Judas

[Chorus]
After all that we've been through (I never thought it'd be you)
Trust in all I thought I knew (guess I didn't know you well)
Tell the lies to hide the truth (should have known they wasn't true)
Who would ever think that you'd (turn out to be a Judas)
[Verse 3]
Dear Judas, this one's for whom ever the shoe fits
'Cause niggas wear hate like Air Forces
Talk shit, of course they do, it's the price of fame
If part of this is getting paid then so is being betrayed
But how it all plays out is how it's being portrayed
I don't believe half of anything anybody says
You liar you, you lie to me
Here lies the truth, RULE, you in the way? MOVE
And I'm talking to you, you, you and you
If you know who you are, then come holla at the God
Judas's, Jesus, Caesar, and Brutus's
While we must forgive, damn it father
For them know not what they do
I'll keep my hand on my gun, on my Bible, and pray for you
'Cause you'll never be the same since I saw you as Judas

[Chorus]
After all that we've been through (I never thought it'd be you)
Trust in all I thought I knew (guess I didn't know you well)
Tell the lies to hide the truth (should have known they wasn't true)
Who would ever think that you'd (turn out to be a Judas)"

I took I vow that I'm forever getting payed
Always heard that lifes a beach so I'm forever getting laid
If money equals power then I'm a fucken generator
Man that spotlight bright
So watch me center stage it and do it, yo girl wanna do it
Damn I look good, but you already knew it
Can't remember the last time I seen my bed sets
Or the last time I had bed sex
I'm in the backseat, getting my dick wet
I fell asleep getting brain, that's a head rest
Last night I hit the bar said I want it all
And today I said the same thing at the mall
Come through in yo city do the same thing tomorrow
Gettin money and I can't say the samething for ya'll"
Show Me Somethin,J. Cole,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Uh yea, yea, yea, yea, yea

[Hook]
What am I here for?
I'm a man so I cannot let them tears fall
But understand trynna get my head clear ya'll
This shit is on my mind
Asking for the lord to show me all my signs
Show me something
Cause I'm trynna find something
I'm lost can you show me something
I'm lost can you show me something

[Verse 1]
I sit and reminisce on them niggas no longer here
And how I used to hit the mall and ya was always there
I sit and think how I didn't grow up with my father there
No need to cry cause it only made me stronger yea
I watched my brother get in trouble with the law and yea
That shit cut me like I was sitting in a barber chair
Cause I don't want to see them locked up in them bars in there
And I don't want to see him stretched out in a coffin yea
I'm wishing I can move my momma out so far from here
I know that she deserve much better and she worked hard as hell
That's why you never see me settle cause they want us here
I'm trynna side step the devil but he heartless yea
But just know that I'm a rebel and yo it's almost here
I'm talking bout the revolution I am Paul Revere
So dry your eyes momma please you can pause them tears
Cause I promise I'm gon get us outta here
I'm gon get us outta here
[Hook]
What am I here for?
I'm a man so I cannot let them tears fall?
But understand trynna get my head clear ya'll this shit is on my mind
Asking for the lord to show me all my signs
Show me something
Cause I'm trynna find something
I'm lost can u show me something
I'm lost can you show me something

[Verse 2]
I swear I'm praying for my niggas when I say grace
I know them niggas don't care who they hit they spray strays
But lord please protect my family cause if they graze
Niggas is loading up that ammi and them A-K's
I know it's wrong and that revenge is all in your hands
But last night I heard they robbed and killed an old man
Now if they cold enough to take a life that's innocent
I know that they could give a fuck whether I live and shit
And so I'm asking you if you can hold me down lord
Be my umbrella-ella-ella in this downpour
I know you never ever ever let me drown or
Won't let that devil ever ever win this round naw
And though I stray for you, you know that my heart is good
And I know I ain't exactly living how I probly should
And I'm a try to act better like it's Hollywood
Niggas congratulate me I just tell them God is good
God is good
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yea, huh, yea my niggas drug dealing in the trap
I'm tellin you wake up nigga it's a trap
You set up and to them young mothers fed up
Just keep your head up
Don't let up
You fall you get up
You make your bed up that you sleep in
Fake rappers ain't practicing what dey preaching
Hey tell you hit the trap while they relaxing on the beach and
I'm here to spit the facts
A nigga backflipped off the deep end
I smell this shit for what it is
Not kells but I love the kids
And so I make the song to let em know that they important
Cause them racist teachers couldn't give a fuck bout wat they score is
So they try to get them hands up on them Grants like Horace
Now slanging for you knoe it cops is knocking they got warrants
Damn!, uh, and how he running for it
Damn!, yea and now the cops is running for him damn!
And now he finally slowing down
Hands behind your head, lay down on the ground, nigga

I Aint Mad At Cha,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: 2Pac & Danny Boy Steward]
Change, shit
I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggas to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit' ya, I ain't mad at cha
Got nothin' but love for ya, do your thing, boy
Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all
Know what I mean? 'Cause I ain't mad at cha
Heard y'all tearin' up shit out there
Kickin' up dust, givin' a motherfuck
Yeah, niggas, 'cause I ain't mad at cha

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller, but you still rolled
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
'Member when you had a Jheri curl, didn't quite learn
On the block, wit'cha Glock, trippin' off sherm
Collect calls to the crib, sayin' how you've changed
Oh, you a Muslim now? No more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the mosque, don't wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my little homie, he's a changed man
Hit the pen' and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I talk about money, all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large, you tell me it's trouble
Congratulations on the weddin', I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd bomb
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme and you ain't even with it
Knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that
Go toe to toe when it's time to roll, you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, 'cause I'm just laughin' at cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go ahead
'Cause I ain't mad at cha
[Chorus: Danny Boy Steward & 2Pac]
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
We used to be like distant cousins, fightin', playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin', knowin' that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin' and grindin', wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time, we'd learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony, lovin' the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I'll be locked up state
I kiss my mama goodbye and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight, the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, 'cause mama, I ain't happy here
I blew trial, no more smiles for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin', ""Hell, I know one day I'll be back""
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'd be there, so prepare to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha
'Cause you's a down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha
[Chorus: Danny Boy Steward & 2Pac]
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
A true down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Well, guess who's movin' up? This nigga's ballin' now
Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothin' to lots, ten carats to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block
He's Mr. Local-Celebrity, addicted to movin' ki's
Most hated by enemies, escape in the luxury
See, first you was our nigga, but you made it so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you while you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb, hopin' we make it to the better days
'Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a Glock beside my head, when will it stop?
'Til God return me to my essence
'Cause even as an adolescent, I refused to be a convalescent
So many questions and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at cha
You niggas just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha
[Chorus: Danny Boy Steward & 2Pac]
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
Hell nah, I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
And I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha"

One for the impalas, two for the gold Ds
Three for the switches, middle finger for the police
Nigga wit' a attitude, I will not let it die
Four fingers up, two twisted for the West Side

Three for the switches, middle finger for the police
Nigga wit' a attitude, I will not let it die
Four fingers up, two twisted for the West Side

[Verse 1]
Yo, I used to dribble the rock down the block in '94
Shoot the courts out when Killer Wayne brought that Porsche out
I had the illest jump shot so he bet all his money on me
12 years old with the hunnies on me
Patrick Ewings on, I kept the fresh kicks
Take a nigga out his Jordan's if the motherfuckers fit (they fit)
They fit so I'm back up the block
Fuckin' with the homies tryin' to teach them how to slap box
In front of the crack spot fiends fightin' over crack rock
Dimes the size of golf balls, yeah, them shits was that hot
He had them black Locs on like MC Ren
And Deebo came through in the hood in that coke-white Benz
Before 106 & Park and 24 inch rims
Before these corny niggas kept the stickers under they brims
It was a little nigga in Compton, five foot ten
He was dope as a motherfucker, I wanted to be like him

Fuck it, I ain't gon' lie, homie I used to do the Hammer Dance
Make it worse, I had steel toes on and hammer pants
Fucked up right? That's when my pops had the weight
He had to blow while I was blowin' in Nintendo tapes
Got my ass whooped for takin' the Duck Hunt gun outside
In my window watchin' all the kids have fun outside
Ice cream truck makin' noise, I want to run outside
But I'ma get my ass whooped again if I run outside
Swear I was on punishment until my tenth grade year
This new girl move on the block, light skin with wavy hair
I asked her did she want to hump me, she was like, ""I don't care""
So I took off her training bra, that's when she got scared
She wanted me to be her boyfriend, so I was like, ""Yeah""
I'm tryin' to think of LL lines in the back of my head
""When I'm alone in my room"" I can't remember what he said
But I know Uncle Luke, bitch give me some head
It go..

Shit, I'm grown now pops in jail, I'm on my own now
Got my first kilo and my brick phone now
Two door Cutlass, sittin' on that chrome now
Headed to the county jail, two T's comin' home now
Yeah, homie, shit changed, nigga's don't bang like they used to
And I can't dunk like I used to, niggas don't move fast enough When they hear the *WOO WOOP*
And takin' fades is played out like Fubu
I got a TV in the dash watchin' Friday
21, no felon, tell them niggas, crime pay
Red rag in my pocket, doin' it my way
Two switches, so the cutlass bounce sideways
Four amps, 15s beatin' the trunk
Try to jack me for my shit? Gotta beat me to the pump, punk
I'm on my gangsta shit nigga wit' a attitude
On my motherfuckin' gangsta shit

Hey Lo, I'm a take these nigga's back man
Back to the number 4 Jordans, nigga, them shits were sway
Remember those motherfuckas? Had the number 4 Jordans, man
When the new shits got old, we couldn't afford the new ones, man
So we went to motherfuckin' Payless and got that black shoe polish
Put so much shoe polish on them motherfuckas tryin' to keep them shiny black that them motherfuckas turned leather!
Or like when the motherfuckin' ice cream nigga came through
I remember the nigga name, it was Hector, man
And he would come through in the ice cream truck
And got all the motherfuckin' stickers on the ice cream truck
Like he just ballin' crazy out the game
This nigga got stickers of motherfuckin' ice cream sandwiches
Strawberry short cakes, UFOs, motherfuckin' big sticks
Then you ask this nigga do he got any of them motherfucka's he talkin' about
All he got is Now & Laters
What the fuck you in an ice cream truck for then, Hector?
Get the fuck out of here, man
Shit, look at these niggas now man all these funny clothes and jackets and all fuckin' little..
This lookin' fuckin' crazy, man

I yearn to achieve all my goals
And all my time will be spent
On the ones I miss, I will lament

All the things you taught me made me who I am
I here my people talking about the things that need to change
For this new generation but nobody's taking action
We can't keep fighting and forever struggling

Friends With Money,Drake,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
D-D-D-Do that

[Chorus]
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do it!
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
'Cause we can do it!
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)

[Verse 1]
Uhh, focus on women then you get less done
It's light work, flow is heavy like a wet sponge
I'm gettin' rich 'cause I think being broke is less fun
Celebratin' Father's day every day so don't get sonned
Where you tryna go, I'm ready
Pick any place in the world, the dough is comin' in steady
I'm chillin' out with T and Jay and Nico
My city ain't a city that support they own people
But I run it, you say something about it, I doubt it
I got this Gucci wallet, I do not leave home without it
I'm 'bout it, I'm 'bout it, I'm standing on these couches sayin'
""Bring this booth a bottle, no we do not need a spout bitch!""
Pardon me, that was rude
If you just started balling I say I'm 'bout to conclude
What more is there to do
And why I would pretend
She call me and I hit it every time like 'SEND' (damn)

Yeah, look
Me and 40 whilin', stylin'
Somehwere on the island
Lay her down and fold her like that shit you put a file in
We all get to pitch in and that's when it gets to pilin'
And I'm callin' your bluff
Don't act like you can't see my dialin'
Never embellish, believe 'em 'cause he ain't exist
The stars on my team but I lead the league in asist
Never been a believer that previously exist
I wonder what I be doin' when previously is this
I do breakfast at the Ivy, you can grab some lunch to go
Havin' dinner at Chateau's, right across from Lindsey Loooo-han
Don't I treat you better than your old man?
He couldn't have done it like this sho' nuff
I tend to dro puff
I'm throwed and I'm high
I guess I'm throwed up
Tone it all down

And tell me when you start getting paid to show up, damn

The Abyss,Sandpeople,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Who are you? Survey says status sticks
I swim three laps through each synapsis
With my feet attached to bricks
So when our shitty third-world constructed social fabric rips
I'll be treading water with every other iconoclast of fish
That's a glitch in this system of O's and ones
Bitches and clothes and drugs, in the midst of a frozen sun
I still start fires on this earth
Sparking lighters with this curse
I was given this addiction downward spiraling since birth
And it gets worse for fish kind, and I'd give mine to fix yours
But I'm just as sure I'll be the one that dies in this abyss first
(Belly up, motherfucker!)
Best to pray I grow legs and hit dirt, ‘cause it's safe to say this fish baits a good occasion to get scurred
It goes hook line and sinker
I use my instincts to survive when blinded by lies
‘Cause they look like the keys to true bliss
Well, here's a few tips for anyone listening to me:
There's plenty of fish in the sea
But only some finish the dream (know what I mean?)
[Hook]
I'm one step closer on this path that you laid
I'm one breath closer to the last one I'll take
And I rest knowing that in your hands lies my fate
But I'm a little unsure if I'm worth every chance that you gave
I'm one step closer on this path that you laid
I'm one breath closer to the last one I'll take
And I rest just hoping that in your hands lies my fate
But I'm unsure if I deserve to even ask to be saved

[Verse 2]
I'm a nomad, with no direction or designated section
Walking two parallel pathways trying to make a connection
Expressing myself on etch-a-sketches
‘Cause I'm standing on shaky ground
And as the foundation starts to crumble
I watch high hopes start tumbling down
That rumbling sound you hear is from the belly of the beast
Until he feasts on young minds with ideals of peace
And meal time will never cease
Yeah, life's a glutton for its own self-inflicted misery
Press the right button
And see a million clones rendition of bigotry
Is it because I hit the dot on the bottom of my question mark
Using my left hand with the utmost of dexterity?
And the day I stopped intoxicating myself
With conventional thought
Is when I had what you could call a moment of
Existentialist clarity
And it's a rarity, in a world where we can see in three dimensions, but so many fucking people are just one-sided
While some blinded by their faith in a system
Which has more cracks than a wiseguy
The rest just shook
Viewing the coming attractions with wide eyes (surprise!)
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
While some view life in a luxury box suite
I'm stuck with nose bleed seats
Trying to see my future through binoculars
Not sure if it's success I see
Or just a recipe for self-destruction
With something sucking me towards the latter
And as my dreams begin to shatter
I mask my face focus on my task and question if it matters
But this inner sadness
Is harder to contain than piss in bladders
Swimming against the current: mainstream
But damn this fish done missed his ladder
So they slaughter me to sustain an energy efficient status
Disadvantaged with an image
That's been hollowed out by the gram, to the point where a gaping hole trapped in skin is all that I am
You're witnessing the fall of a man never risen
Hence, defying the laws of physics simply by my existence
Distant from the norm
‘Cause giving in is a breeze, but resistance is a storm
That leaves your presence ripped and torn
Like a victim to kids on Christmas morn'
They say time is of the essence
Each 60 seconds minutes form
So I waste what's in my grasp, then miss it when it's gone

""Mr. Yayo, you're free to go
So, I guess this means I'll see you tomorrow, eh?""

[Intro: Eminem + (Tony Yayo)]
{*Eminem laughs*}
Yeah! Ha ha, guess who's home?!
Tony Yayo! Yeah! Obie Trice, c'mon!
(Here we go now!)

[Hook: Eminem]
I'm a drama setter
Grippin' my Berretta, sippin' Amaretto
Man, you crazy if you think I'ma let up
I told you I'm a drama setter
I'll be the first to set it, homie, you can bet it
Just don't get in the way of my cheddar
Man, ‘cause I'm a drama setter
I don't go lookin' for no trouble
But somehow the trouble always finds me
Don't make me have you in the trauma center
With your momma cryin'
‘Cause her only son is dyin'
She don't know it's just your karma catchin' up
‘Cause I'm a drama setter
[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
I'll poke you, man, I'm Rikers Island Pokemon
I got CO's bringin' me filet mignon
But now a nigga home, lookin' frail in the drop (whattup?)
With a bitch shotgun that's inhalin' the cock
I got rocks on my neck the size of bottle tops
And got Glocks in the Lex, so we ride behind cops
Broke days, we used to put water in our cereal
Now we're crossin' borders just to shoot another video
It's Tony Montana on full-body armor
Soning niggas, like Alfredo in The Godfather
Two-shot revolver, that Dillinger shit
And the AR-15 bending your six
We taking trips to Morocco just to tan
We smoke weed in restaurants in Amsterdam
I was worth a hundred grams, now I'm worth a cool million
I'll put money on your hairline, your dime and your children

[Hook: Eminem]
I'm a drama setter
Grippin' my Berretta, sippin' Amaretto
Man, you crazy if you think I'ma let up
I told you I'm a drama setter

Just don't get in the way of my cheddar
Man, ‘cause I'm a drama setter

Don't make me have you in the trauma center

‘Cause her only son is dyin'
She don't know it's just your karma catchin' up
‘Cause I'm a drama setter
[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
Since Yayo is home, them AR's is drawn
Obie's Guerilla-Unit, fuck affiliation
We are one, it is senseless for you to prevent this
The .40 cal'll put you up under some photosynthesis
At any given instant {gunshot}, another incident
You just got a glimpse of Obie and Yay's temperment
And we holdin' them K's, that's why homie won't age
Isn't it that Tony's enraged they throw him in cages?
But now my nigga's loose, our crews is bulletproof
All brought to you from whom's pupils' baby blues
His short fuses put your portrait on the news
Nigga, them screws is loose
When you fuckin' with them Shady dudes

[Hook: Eminem]
I'm a drama setter
Grippin' my Berretta, sippin' Amaretto
Man, you crazy if you think I'ma let up
I told you I'm a drama setter

Just don't get in the way of my cheddar

‘Cause I'm a drama setter
[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
I got fat while I was gone, but now I'm here
And y'all rappers only bust shots only in fear
Chinchillas on my back, itchy fingers on the MAC
Get scrilla off of crack, get 50's shooter back
Listen homie, don't let them niggas amp you money
‘Cause I got niggas in Queens that kill for Pamper money
Move like Keyzer, Jayson Williams, slaughter the driver
My daughter Maniyah, know that the kid spit fire
Reality rap, nigga, check my salary cap
I give guns to my soldiers with a battery pack
What you know about light planes and heavy coke?
And them drugs being smuggled on them fast speed boats?
It's the rap tycoon, Tony, y'all all know me
See me on MTV, I'm a parolee
I was out for twelve hours and went right back in
For three hots and one cot doin' time in the pen

[Hook: Eminem]
I'm a drama setter
Grippin' my Berretta, sippin' Amaretto
Man, you crazy if you think I'ma let up
I told you I'm a drama setter
I'll be the first to set it, homie, you can bet it
Just don't get in the way of my cheddar
Man, ‘cause I'm a drama setter

Final Frontier,MC Ren,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'pop', 'blues', 'jazz']","[Intro: DJ Bobcat]
Hey, hey Ren, hey check this out loc
Hey man I've been hearing a gang of niggas
Talking a whole lot of unnecessary bullshit man
What if one of them trick ass niggas
Come at you the wrong way, loc?

[Verse 1]
I'll beat a nigga's ass on this track just for the hell of it
There the motherfucking piece of pussy there's no tell of it
I don't give a damn I'll beat a nigga like he stole something
And then I'll let the motherfucker know where Ren is coming from
(Where you from, loc?)
I'm from Compton, everybody's on the wagon
I'm looking for niggas that's thinking
That they're the shit, that's who I'm tagging
Never asking questions I just go right in and do it
And if you're thinking that you can fuck with Ren
You bitch already blew it
Like I said before, fools want up in my shoes
But after fucking with me
They giving up rapping and singing the blues
Me and DJ Train dropping bombs like a B-2
So you should get the picture or if not, you get a preview
That we don't take no shit
Cause MC Ren ain't a nigga that you wanna try and fuck with
Kick a little ass in my spare time
To keep myself occupied when I'm not busting up a rhyme
Writing that shit that ya love to hear
Cause MC Ren is the final frontier
[Hook]
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
You fuck with me, you gotta fuck with a Mac-10
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
You fuck with me, you gotta fuck with a Mac-10

[Verse 2]
Now throw your hands in the air and let me see ya slap a ho
Start the violence going on through an MC Ren show
I don't give a fuck if niggas is fighting in the crowd
I only got one concern, that's my vocals pumping loud
I'm standing on the stage I got my niggas to my right
I bust a couple of verses
Then jump in the crowd and get with the fight
I hit a nigga off in the head with a chair
The reason for that, the motherfucker he was standing there
Then DJ Train will grab the gauge - just in case a motherfucker
Talks shit; he'll be the victim on the front page
He's on his way to the morgue - to kick it with the rest
Of them motherfuckers that I gave free room and board
So when you at my show
Let me see ya throw your hands up in the air and slap a ho
Cause that's the only noise I wanna hear
Cause MC Ren is the final frontier
[Hook]
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
You fuck with me, you gotta fuck with a Mac-10
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
You fuck with me, you gotta fuck with a Mac-10

[Verse 3]
The final frontier makes the average nigga wonder
Why they do a couple of records and then they go up under
Try to copy Ren but Ren just can't be duplicated
Motherfuckers making pussy shit so I come in and fade it
Slap the niggas like bitches if they have to talk back
Put my foot so deep in their ass they have a hole and not a crack
The shit just makes a nigga laugh, cause niggas be coming to me
Asking me why did I leave a size 10 Nike in their ass
I tell them I had to do it was part of the plan
To try to stop the fools jacking off by the hand
Putting wack records in the make
By using R&B fucking singers in the god damn breaks
Trying to go commercial but they started out street
That's reason why they're still drivin in their two feet
Thinking they can diss Ren's flow, but singing and dancing
Don't go with the format that I be using in my show
It's just hardcore niggas acting crazy on the stage
Wearing gangsta clothes yo and spitting on the hoes
Doing that shit that ya love to hear
Cause MC Ren is the final frontier
[Hook]
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
You fuck with me, you gotta fuck with a Mac-10
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren

You fuck with me, you gotta fuck with a Mac-10"
Damn It Feels Good to Be a Gangsta,Geto Boys,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Scarface]
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
A real gangsta-ass nigga plays his cards right
A real gangsta-ass nigga never runs his fucking mouth
'Cause real gangsta-ass niggas don't start fights
And niggas always gotta high cap
Showing all his boys how he shot 'em
But real gangsta-ass niggas don't flex nuts
'Cause real gangsta-ass niggas know they got 'em
Now, everything is cool in the mind of a gangsta
'Cause gangsta-ass niggas think deep
Up three-sixty-five, ayo, 24/7
'Cause real gangsta-ass niggas don't sleep
And all I gotta say to you, wannabe, gonnabe
Cocksucking, pussy-eating pranksters
Is when the fire dies down, what the fuck you gonna do?
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta

[Verse 2: Bushwick Bill]
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
Feeding the poor and helping out with their bills
Although I was born in Jamaica
Now, I'm in the U.S. making deals
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
I mean, one that you don't really know
Riding around town in a drop-top Benz
Hitting switches in my black '64
Now, gangsta-ass niggas come in all shapes and colors
Some got killed in the past
But this gangsta here was a smart one
Started living for the Lord and I'll last
Now, all I gotta say to you
Wannabe, gonnabe, pussy-eating, cocksucking pranksters:
When the shit jumps off, what the fuck you gonna do?
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
[Verse 3: Scarface]
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
A real gangsta-ass nigga knows the play
The real gangsta-ass niggas get the flyest of the bitches
Ask that gangsta-ass nigga Lil J
Now, bitches look at gangsta-ass niggas like a stop sign
And play the role of Little Miss Sweet
But catch the bitch all alone, get the digits, take her out
And end up hitting the ass with the meat
'Cause gangsta-ass niggas be the game-players
And everything's quiet in the clique
A gangsta-ass nigga pulls the trigger
And his partners in the posse ain't telling off shit
Real gangsta-ass niggas don't talk much
All you hear is the black from the gun blast
And real gangsta-ass niggas don't run for shit
'Cause real gangsta-ass niggas can't run fast
Now when you in the free world talkin' shit do the shit
Hit the pen and let a mothafucka shank ya
But niggas like myself kick back and peep game
'Cause damn it feels good to be a gangsta

(""And now, a word from the President."")

[Verse 4 - J. Prince]
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Getting voted in to the White House
Everything looking good to the people of the world
But the Mafia family is my boss
So every now and then I owe a favor getting down
Like letting a big drug shipment through
And send 'em to the poor community
So we can bust you know who
So voters of the world keep supporting me
And I promise to take you very far
Other leaders better not upset me
Or I'll send a million troops to die at war
To all you Republicans, that helped me win
I sincerely like to thank you
’Cause now I got the world swinging from my nuts
And damn it feels good to be a gangsta"

Yo! Nigga this, nigga that
A nigga rap circles 'round the map rap circles 'round these rap cats
You are now in tuned to the facts, the innovations in a state of lax
My click clack tongue attack tracks
Like Rihanna spreads gonorrhea
Chris Brown beats the blacks on her peepers
Give me freedom of speech to speak ether
That'll send these MC's to meet Aaliyah
Free my flow fever my soul seeker
Little more they T-Pain and Wayne in my speakers
My brain's in bleachers, thinkin' with the fans
Reks defeats his stretch like Lil' Kim's features
Or Superhead's cheek, for the rappers that are weak
All these rappers over beats scary as jeepers creepers
Jesus piece took 'cause you look hard
But shook his knees like Yung Berg or Bow Wow divas
Nigga this, nigga that
A nigga rap circles 'round the map rap circles 'round these rap cats
You are now in tuned to the truth, when Reks in the booth
Freedom is met and necessary hourly for you
Bewary when R. Kelly in the buildin'
He peein' on the chil'ren, peein' on the chil'ren
Nigga this, nigga that
A nigga rap circles 'round the map rap circles 'round these rap cats
You are now in tuned to the facts, Reks the black Aristotle
With bottles of beers in the backpack
I follow the cheers of the stairs to the stage
Had it up to here with the ways
Where Cool Kids turn to men in days
These fuckin' hipsters spits are fakes, and tight pants for girls or gays
Mama I chew when your son spit rage
Y'all still slaves tryin' to be Free like 106 chicks suckin' Jay
Make you gargle grenades, covered in semen from AIDS
Cover razor blades in your lemonade
Y'all are Flavor Flav, hypin' but your, writin' fugaze
My mic shall ignite a blaze
Simon say, shoot yourself in the face
Fuckin' disgrace! Uh huh, uh huh
Nigga this, nigga that, uh huh, uh huh
Nigga this, nigga that, check, yo!

Nigga this nigga that
A nigga rap circles 'round the map rap circles 'round these rap cats
Someone tell these dudes to rap
Over Statik Seleck beats I'm too deep to be dumb to fact
I come from the tracks where they slumber and slackin'
Reks suggest you shut your motherfuckin' trap
'Cause you don't rap, you advertisin'
Clothin' lines and since when is that dope rhymin'
You screamin' no homo, but that's so homo
Such a no-no, please swallow the fo' fo'
Someone tell Kanye West to keep his clothes on
And if Wayne E.T. ish, than tell him phone home
Nigga this, nigga that
A nigga rap circles 'round the map rap circles 'round these rap cats
With they slave mind state fact
Their crime rates increasin' police policin' Diddy's and 50's
Inner city gang where you chase American dreams
It's where you get chased by badge and the high beams
My dream's to awake and find fiends
Dressed in three-piece suits, addicts livin' they life clean
But I mean, this ain't gon' happen be happy it seems
We free dumb, um, I mean
Not to disrespect teens who chase black cream
But black cream bloody from the backs of black teens
Like Emmitt 'til we get it, we sing, we sing, we sing.....

Almost There,Childish Gambino,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Girl, I messed up real bad
I'm looking back on the days that we both had
I go to bed and I dream so hard
Of little mixed kids running in the front yard
I need you close, I need your kiss
I never ever, ever, ever knew a love like this
I, miss you more than Puffy missed B.I.G
I didn't think that you would leave a hole this big
In my life, you need to be my wife
I made this song while holdin' the pillow tight
And wishin' that it was you, what can a nigga do
Fuck this success, fuck these interviews
Fuck these phone calls, girl you are worth it
When I was happy, you were happy, you are perfect
When I was blue, you were blue, you're my Smurfette
I put my best chips on the worst bet

[Verse 2]
Girl, I need you like I need air
And fuck these other honeys, I will be there
I never ever, ever thought that I would be scared
Of living in a world when you are not there
My biggest fear is that you won't give a fuck
When you play this song on your MacBook
""Is that CG, yo, he's old news
I'm way too busy with my new dude.""
The best time I ever had
Is kissing in my shitty ass Ikea bed
I wish that it was me instead
Feeling all your pain
I know that it is different now
It will never be the same but
I swear to God, our love special
You can be my number 2 like one pencil
Or you can be my number one, I will let you
In on my life, I've changed so much since you
Left, that hotel room
And if you're with another guy, go tell dude
That he could never keep us apart, he needs a better door
He'll always be the guy that you settle for
I'll always be the guy you're supposed to be with
Where the fuck is Cupid when you need him
I'm so Sam Cooke, I need Cupid too
I play Sam Cooke and I think of you
[Verse 3]
Baby girl we need to be together
This song ain't for my album
This song is for the better
And even though I'm living in a city full of strangers
They can see I'm different
They can see my anger
They can see my pain
They can see the way I talk about you
They see the way I'm living and I won't live long without you
I drink every night, I smoke more too
I think it is safe to say death or you
I need you more now than I ever did
I'm still the same guy you fell in love with
I need a second chance like I need a prayer
Sometimes I think God just doesn't care
I hope he has a plan for both you and I
So we can be together at a different time
Remember when I come home late
And you'd be crying over some food on a cold plate
I'll never do that shit to you again
You're the most beautiful girl I've ever known and my best friend
Baby girl we need to make up
And when I dream of you, I don't want to wake up
And when I don't dream, I don't want to wake up
I'd rather die now than not have your touch
Cause I miss you so much"

Used to be my girlfriend, Why'd I let you go
I kept a lot of things inside that you'll never know
See I was stupid and my pride wouldn't let it show
So I just ran around pretending I was extra cold
The truth is that I really need a sweater though
I'm useless, Girl without you, we were special yo
And do I think about the past, well yes and no
You see it hurts to know we'll never get a second go
So, as I'm sittin' on the bed wishing you were here
I close my eyes and in the vision I see you appear
If pretty girls was in the sky, then you wouldn't live
And then I'm sick when I wake up, because you wasn't there
Uh, I know I made some few mistakes but a promise is a promise and a promise I will make
That you'd never spend a day feelin' love was far away
But you sayin' it's too late
And right now I wish I'd never let you go

Never let you go
You should know, I want you to come home

I hate the fact that I can't even hit you up no mo'
I hate that I'm the one who messed up what we had befo'
I hate tryna hide everytime I see you out
I'm sure the words I told you so come out your mama's mouth
I hate the fact another nigga got my damn wife
If I could trade it all for you, I would do it twice
I'd give it all up twice to see your smile once
I'd cut my life in half to walk down that isle once, with you
Yeah Yeah, the things that we would do
I'm wishing I could rearrange time and start nu
It's time to write a sequel, we need a part two
But you say in part one, I ain't play my part, true
Damn, that's where I went wrong
But don't let a few bad notes end a great song
And don't let a few hold-ups end a whole dawn
I'mma keep holdin' on til my life gone
I wish I'd never let you go

Upper Clapton Dance,Professor Green,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Professor Green]
Wanna bop through these ends?
Follow me on a trot through the East End
Where we wear our hoodies in all seasons
Licking shots, dodging police constables
Walking with punk under balls
Jeans too low to ever to consider
Running or jumping walls
When I walk around here there's a couple of rules
Don't bling around here, tuck your jewels
Unless you wanna get done by the wolves
And don't fight back
A knife can be so uncomfortable
Before the changes
Before the Shell garage had the Sainsbury’s
I walked the street daily
In 1'10s with big fat bows and an Avi'
Black hoodies, Nike tracksuits and hats
Who'll fit caps and chaps
Jewelery fact, all that
Attracts all these cats
Looking to lash on your goodies
You can run but that's harder
Dancing between the cracks and black karma
There's so many murders you never heard about
Why do you think they call it the Murder Mile?
Cause they talk about violence like they know
And this is never what their life was
So righteous, when a few weeks ago
A bullet missed and struck a minor
Oh my old High Road
Good old Upper Clapton High Road
Northwold, Wigan, Southwald, Leaview
All my upper Clapton peeps
[Hook: Professor Green]
This ain't your regular two step routine
Take a few steps with me
Left foot, right foot, best foot, first foot
When you walk around here
You're best to walk firm
So follow trend if you wanna stand a chance
Follow the steps and let's do the upper Clapton dance

[Verse 2: Chynaman]
If you’re flash with your cash
Then invest, buy a mash
And a vest to match
Protect your stash, look
Haters hate but don’t hate them
Just do your thing and ignore them
Life’s a bitch with problems
So fuck it, come share them, look
Rubber guys you gotta watch them
Move to you, you got to pop them
Do or die, you got to take them
Let it slide, you're a victim
Ride with your pride
Ride with the 9
Get caught, then you’re pissed then
Just ride the time, do the Time
Mistakes, we can all fix them
Get six years, serve three
Get a kitchen job, that's me
Took top bunk, bunk bed
Fuck signing on, it's rent free
This ain't me, but it could be
Cause road life’s unsturdy
You beef it if it's worth it
You go inside you respect it
Respect it, ride it
Use the time to reflect in it
Get out, start changing it
Change shits do shutting it
But back in the grime, back to action
Back to the hate, back to Clapton
Haters hate but don’t hate them
Stack your bits and show them
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cores]
Let me tell you what that grime's about
To the media people that run their mouth
Too many of them knives and them guns about
So we got a hard time trying to find something positive to rhyme about
But if you’re mind's in doubt
Jump on the 253
Yourself and try finding out
If we think that you're lying, you'll be dying now
Put a gun to your brain
From here to the roundabout
To get murdered
And go on like nobody know 'em
But it's a murder in Soham and show 'em
It's so dumb
Lead people believe and who believe
These bars ain't going, swear down
We get banned from putting our show on
We get banned from TV and so on, swear down
Never hear the way the man go on
It ain’t easy
Believe me
You don't come past, and fast
And your cars gone
Look, stare and your cuts won't last long
Gold rings and I'll take every last one
Upper Clapton dance with a mask on
Go on, step in and they won't pull a fast one
Seek too many men
Pass on, this one could be my last song
And the reason I see man rolling
And the hearses get worse from first to the last one"

Penitentiary chances, sixes on a muscle car

Runnin,The Game,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: Dion]
Got to live for today 'cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
Don't just want a piece I want my whole destiny
(If you got it) I'm gon' take it
(If you're in it) you're coming with me
(Bench warmers) get no playing time
(No sleeping) 'til I cross the line, I'm running

[Verse 1: The Game]
With 99 miles left, on the Avis rental car
Blowing horns like Miles Davis
At the pearly gates, God let me in
Give me a room by Aaliyah's with ESPN
I know I got more sins than two lesbians
Been back and forth across the border like Mexicans
But (I'm running) like New York pedestrians
Trying not to scuff my Nike Air checks again
It's funny how niggas be the best of friends
And fall out over pussy and wanna dead they man
One of my niggas in the grave the other one in the pen
She fucking my enemies inside my homeboy's Benz
Now she begging God's mercy 'cause she ain't listen to Nas
And never heard about Ike with the Iverson jersey
He got a cousin named Jason that rock the Gary Payton
Now the same trifling bitch is a HIV patient, true story
[Chorus: Dion]
Got to live for today 'cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
Don't just want a piece I want my whole destiny
(If you got it) I'm gon' take it
(If you're in it) you're coming with me
(Bench warmers) get no playing time
(No sleeping) 'til I cross the line, I'm running

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
If I get knocked with my gun, nigga, I'm running
If I catch a murder one, nigga, I'm running
Homicide come around and they keep on coming
That's why I'm out of state and I keep on running
I ain't Nelly, but my Desert Eagle's on, girl
Just dropped bail, traveling the world
When I sign my deal I said fuck jail
I went on tour to Barcelona and Brazil
This shit real, fuck an appeal
D's want my head like that bitch in Kill Bill
Sling dope, sling crack and them E pills
That's why I'm on the low like a damn navy seal, I'm running

[Chorus: Dion]
Got to live for today 'cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
Don't just want a piece I want my whole destiny
(If you got it) I'm gon' take it
(If you're in it) you're coming with me
(Bench warmers) get no playing time
(No sleeping) 'til I cross the line, I'm running
[Verse 3: The Game]
'Cause I gotta pack them shows
And Dre told me ain't no coming back from gold
So I gotta get my album in place
My G-Unit features, my Eminem sixteen, my Dr. Dre beats
And it was two years from today when I started rhyming
And took my demo to Suge and he ain't sign me
Niggas threatening my life like it's hard to find me
See me shining in the hood like twenty inch Lexanis
My mom said I'm hard head, I don't follow the rules
Why should I when Reebok giving niggas they own shoes
And I'm dealing with the same problems 50 Cent got
Yayo in jail and they think I'm trying to take his spot
I'm in the studio laughing at Chris Rock
Then I turn on MTV and see Soulja Slim shot
And niggas trying to gun me down in the rim shop
'Cause I just want the same recognition that the Crips got
They say I'm the next in line and if I get shot
Then I go out as the Bobby Fischer of hip hop
Make your chest move
Sylvia Rhone and Kevin Lyle slept cool
Jimmy Iovine was the best move

[Chorus: Dion]
Got to live for today 'cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
Don't just want a piece I want my whole destiny
(If you got it) I'm gon' take it
(If you're in it) you're coming with me
(Bench warmers) get no playing time
(No sleeping) 'til I cross the line, I'm running"

Yo, this one here goes out
To all my players out there, man
You know, that got that one good girl, dawg
That's always been there, man
Like, took all the bullshit
But then one day she can't take it no more
And decides to leave me

[Verse 1: Akon]
Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Could've sworn I was dreamin'
For her I was feenin'
So I had to take a little ride
Backtrackin' on these few years
Tryin' to figure out what I do to make it go bad
‘Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashin', and I'm so…

Can't believe I had a girl like you
And I just let you walk right out of my life
After all I put you through

Been all about the world
Ain't never met a girl
That could take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come
Where you would get up and run
And I would be out chasin' you
‘Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy, but now so lonely

Never thought that I'd be alone
I didn't think you'd be gone this long
I just want you to call my phone
So stop playin', girl, and come on home
Baby girl, I didn't mean to shout
I want me and you to work it out
I never wished that I would ever hurt my baby
And it's drivin' me crazy, ‘cause I'm so…

All the Above,Maino,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: T-Pain]
Tell me what do you see, when you're looking at me
On a mission to be, what I'm destined to be
I've done been through the pain and the sorrow
The struggle it's nothing but love
I'm a soldier a rider a ghetto survivor and all the above
All the above (x7)

[Verse One: Maino]
Listen! Really what do you see, when you looking at me?
See me come up from nothing, see me living my dreams
I've done been through the bottom, I've done suffered a lot
I deserve to be rich, heading straight to the top
Look how I ride for the block, look how I rep for the hood
I got nothing but love, now that I come through the hood
Getting this fortune and fame, money make all of us change
The new Benz is all white, call it John McCain
How the hell could you stop me? Why in the world would you try?
I go hard forever, that's just how I'm designed
That's just how I was built, see the look in my eyes
You take all of this from me, and I'm still gon' survive
You get truth from me, but these rappers gon' lie
I'm a part of these streets, till the day that I die
I wave hi to the haters, mad that I finally done made it
Take a look, and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness
[Hook: T-Pain]

[Verse Two: Maino]
It's easy to hate, it's harder to love me
Y'all don't understand, y'all quickly to judge me
Put your foot in my Nike's, picture you living my life
Picture you stuck in the cell, picture you wasting your life
Picture you facing a charge, picture you beating the odds
Picture you willing to bleed, picture you wearing the scar
Thank you for making me struggle, thank you for making me grind
I perfected my hustle, tell me the world ain't mine
You've been seeing me lately, I'm a miracle baby
I refuse to lose, this what the ghetto done made me
I put that on my father, trying to hope for tomorrow
When I think that I can't, I envision Obama
I envision in diamonds, I envision Ferrari's
If the world was perfect, all my niggas behind me
Ain't you happy I made it? Man I'm making a statement
Take a look, and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness


[Hook: T-Pain]

[Bridge: T-Pain]
Now if I'm out on the spot
Or if I'm out on the block
I hustle hard cause it's all the same (They know, they know)
If you know that grind don't stop
Because I rose to the top
And everybody knows my name (Maino, Maino)
Hey! I'm still grinding, still hustling
No more pain, no more suffering
My ladies and my shorties and my thugs
Keep on dancing and shining for love

A Bitch Iz a Bitch,N.W.A,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Narrator]
Let's describe a certain female
A female with a disease of character and attitude
If you will, a snob
However in the view of NWA...

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
A bitch is a bitch
So if I'm poor or rich
I talk in the exact same pitch
Now the title bitch don't apply to all women
But all women have a little bitch in 'em
It's like a disease that plagues their character
Taking the women of America
And it starts with the letter B
It makes a girl like that think she better than me (bitch)
See, some get mad and some just bear it
But, yo, if the shoe fits wear it
It makes 'em go deaf in the ear that's why
When you say 'hi' she won't say 'hi'
Are you the kind that think you're too damn fly?
Bitch eat shit and die *laughs*
Ice Cube coming at you at a crazy pitch
(Why?) I think a bitch is a bitch
[Bitch]
Who the fuck you think you calling a bitch you little sorry motherfucker
I don't know who the fuck you think you talking to
Let me tell you one motherfucking thing, I'm not no-
""Bitch, shut the fuck up""

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Yo, you can tell a girl that's out for the money (how?)
She look good and the bitch walk funny (he ain't lying)
She ain't no dummy, she's rather conniving
Yo bitch, fuck what I'm driving (yup)
See a young nigga that's striving (like me)
You're through without a BMW
That's why a bitch is a bitch I guess
Or either P-M-S
Here, test the girl that's kinda snobby (alright)
And I bet you dissing niggas is her hobby
And after she finished the test
Grade today of B-I-T-C-H
And watch her get mad 'cause she know it's true (she know it)
But a nigga like me'll say ""fuck you"" *laughs*
Do like Ice Cube, slam her ass in a ditch (word) (slam her ass)
'Cause a bitch is a bitch

[Bitch/Ice Cube]
""Why I gotta be a bitch?""
I ain't call you no bitch, if you listen to the goddamn song it'd tell you what a bitch is...
""Fuck the song 'cause I'm not no motherfucking bitch""
I didn't say you was a bitch, if you stop acting like a goddamn bitch
""Fuck you, little punk-ass little nigga""
Fuck you, bitch! You sloppy-ass, scandalous-ass ho!
""Fuck you! Who the fuck you think you are?""
Fuck you! Suck my dick, bitch! You scandalous-ass, doo-doo dog breath, stinking, ugly...
[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
I once knew a bitch who got slapped
'Cause she played me like she was all that
A bitch can be your best friend talking behind your back (yeah?)
About who's fucking who and who's getting fat
Look at yourself for me (look, bitch)
Now do you fall in this category?
Or you the kind that won't blink
'Cause you don't think your shit stink *laughs*
Lucky I haven't had a drink
'Cause I'd down your ass
Then I'd clown your ass
'Cause the niggas I hang with ain't rich
We'll all say ""Fuck you bitch!"" (word)
Now what can I do with a ho like you
Bend your ass over and then I'm through (get the fuck out)
'Cause you see Ice Cube ain't taking no shit
(Why?) 'Cause I think a bitch is a bitch

[Narrator]
There you have it, the description of a bitch
Now ask yourself are they talking about you?
Are you that funky, dirty, money-hungry, scandalous, stuck-up, hair piece contact wearing bitch?
Yep, you probably are

Make a nigga smile from ear to ear
Order three more bottles of that Belvedere
Then I point her out like, ""You come here
You come here and you come here""
Booty sittin' higher than a flight of stairs
Some can make it clap, some really can't though
Them Alabama girls said it's all in the ankles
Speakin' of ankles, bend over and touch your toes
And pop it and make it roll, I'm lovin' this angle
Ha, I love this view that I'm lookin' at
Dressed so elegant, ass like a elephant
Shorty got me harder than I've ever been
So I'ma give it to like a motherfuckin' veteran
Body so sick so this dick be the medicine

She-She-She drop it low and speed it up, other niggas freezin' up
'Cause when they see that ass they like, ""Damn, what you feedin' her?"" (Gangsta)
Her-Her-Her body so ridiculous, I kiss it where she ticklish
Big booty world record, you can find it up in Guinness
And no-no-no, it's not a gimmick, shawty she the truth
And she got a big donk (Big donk), alley-oop (Gangsta Grillz)
Damn, girl, I'm horny and you know I want it
Booty so big I can put ten bottles on it
I tell her hold this, she got baby makin' hips
So I pulled her pants down and gave her lingerie a kiss
Mrs. Parker, Mrs. Parker
When you go let me (Ayy), Mrs. Parker?

Choices A Wave For Alex,Charles Hamilton,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1:]
Rebel or pacifist?
Better or average?
Never or have to?
Forever or past due?
Heaven or back at you?
Weapon or passiveness?
Paper or plastic?
Hater or fanatic?
Bow your head and close your eyes
As the hours goin' by, decide if power is even on the line
The powers that be haven't cowered in the least
But my faith looks up to thee
The big She in the sky
One day, it will be She and I
Until then, she cries, ""Please decide or I'm leaving""
As I decide whether leaving is a blessing or a boon
Soon is stressful to the groom
Bride don't leave me
But... Your choice miss
You know where my void is
And the voices...
Can't even tell you where the voice is
[Hook:]
If I die tonight
Where will you be?
With a tear in my eye
What will you see?
You don't know the sadness of a joker
You don't know the sadness of a joker

[Verse 2:]
In my bedroom
Re-introducing wrist to knife
Chicks are my kryptonite
Spliffs are my lifted spirit
Seemed like everybody hated the work I put in
Now you waitin' for the goodness I been makin'
What good is it if I die?
Y'all don't know when I cry
My laptop does
That's NOT love
I don't know if I'm a woman or man
Fans pullin' my hands, like ""You the man! ""
They don't understand
God knows, but she deserted me
Purposefully, I feel my purpose is to believe
But feel worthless
I got a son, in fact; mad kids
But can't react when they askin' where Dad is
That's some shhh
Perfect makes practice
So I hope y'all hear my songs and do back-flips
You wanna watch through my eyes?
But tears are what you laugh with
Where's my bottle of Aspirin?
[Hook:]
If I die tonight
Where will you be?
With a tear in my eye
What will you see?
You don't know the sadness of a joker
You don't know the sadness of a joker

[Verse 3:]
Yo
No more crushes, I fell in love with comic books
Not a good look when reality is the focus
These-
Know what it is, but won't give it up
Corporate foes know I know the biz but won't fold
Normalcy is so important to me
But if u force it, it will force you into morbid dreams
How bout a glimpse into my nightmares?
Sky bright, yeah right
My high is quite fearsome, gruesome
To some, I grew some
I just let the rapist take what they can lose, one
UCK the world, is the whisper
But I love the world, is what was spiked in my plight elixir
So like the swisher, yeah laugh at Mr. Truman
I stay gettin' done dirty, I refuse groomin'
So whose stupid? The song or me living?
Still I kill writtens, I live when I type
Kiss me goodnight
Enjoy my body of work
Boy in the body of a skirt
[Hook:]
If I die tonight
Where will you be?
With a tear in my eye
What will you see?
You don't know the sadness of a joker
You don't know the sadness of a joker

Sometimes I feel like my old me
My only true fan
So, to all the true fans
I love y'all, sooo much

Hey Alex, it's Charles
Umm...
I heard about what happened
It's umm... kinda messed up how it works
But, I know where you're headed
Ain't nothing but the best waves...
And this should just teach a lesson man
Be proud to be a lesson to all the irresponsibles out there
Life is precious, man
Your family misses you, man
Your dad really misses you
Your friends, brothers, sisters
They really miss you
I saw this video where, uh...
They were looking at the waves, and they were splashing like crazy
Like everybody was just wildin' out
I hope you never had a question about love in your heart
Cause everybody love you
Wish we could've hung out sometime, man
My balance ain't all that great on the surf board
But, you know...
I'm really good at surfing the internet (Hehe)

Yo, I'm flowin now to blow the microphone out
I spit the flows out, Mr. Skoal Mouth, no doubt
Tickets sold out, black and white kids, Diff'rent Strokes house
+Transform+ you pessimists to optimists and roll out
+Decepticons+ style, Megatron, bloaw!
Check the rhyme files, 007 stretch beyond bounds
Of the earth, moon, universe, soon to burst through
Three sixty-five, prepare live, you April 1st Fool
These wannabe best rappers hold the wet bladders
Need a step ladder, still couldn't reach my best status
Inspector Gadget, extra baggage, I was blessed to have it (skills)
You must be still guessin at it, still testin average
I'm never slippin even if you peeled a fresh banana
The moves I make are checks and balance like a chess fanatic
You less advantage, manic depressin, impress the panic
Lyrics hot enough to melt your plastic, burn your flesh to ashes (ouch)
That's what you earn when you not well rehearsed
Somebody gotta help preserve this art form, myself preferred
Check the verse, it's like a Magic spell with words
These wack emcees prolly felt it worse than a Celtic Bird

[One.Be.Lo]
I remember when Bam' was hot, Planet Rock, Jordan was the man to stop
Knowledge every chance I got, keys to the master lock
Deals not real, unless it's God's will
Got NASA job skills, call me astronaut Neil
I reach for the top and be the first to leave orbit
Report it, Phrikshun, Decompoze reinforce it
I'm here to paint a portrait, untainted by the corporate
Defy forces of your gravity with fly orders
These accomplishments, via rocketship, compliment my confidence
I be among stars without your documents
Big budget marketing, demographic targeting
All I need is beats and rhymes (so go and spark it then)

Off the tracks that I kick, come on and live it up
Cause I get funky like diaper rash (Nah)
And you know I'm mad spunky, and I'm making cash
Well, I got sex rhymes like Victoria got secrets
To all you porno peepers who are trying to peep this
I'm like Al Goldstein, I'm all about screwing
Lead my team to sixty wins like my man Pat Ewing

Well, that's the feeling that I make my goal

A little wine with my dinner so I'm in my Grape Ape
I feel like a winner when I make a mixtape
Cause I get ill when I'm on the pause button
And I get my fill and you can't say nothing
More soul on this train than Don Cornelius
Got the mad sub-woofer pumping bass for your anus
Just getting on the mic at the monthly function
The wires hitting switches connected at the junction
Perlman's got beats and it ain't no secret
Dante found his shit but you know he freaked it
And so the story goes on and on
Down in SD50 'til the early morning

This the one they was waitin' on, baby
I had to do it

[Verse: Nicki Minaj]
(Kyuh) Just when they thought it was safe to play, I
Hit 'em with the N-I-C, the K-I
I'm Tinkerbell, he's Peter Pay-I
To these rap bitches, I'm Mother May I
I wanna know why you waste your time
On these rap hoes that don't write they rhymes
Get a can of Sprite with a twist of lime
Money, money, money, always on my mind
Coupe color purple, no, I'm not Celie
We run New York like we play relay
My flight took off, yours has been delayed
Give it to them early bitches, so don't be late
Playtime is over, when I spit bars
My mixtape bring all the boys to the yard
All the boys want Nicki, all the boys want mine
All the boys say they love me, yeah, they love me long time
Yes, I'm the girl that they heard of, I commit murder
I body bitches, I don't need a burner
Queens, oh, yes, I rep Queens
Little white tee, plus some tight jeans
I make it hard for these chicks to breathe
Wrist on freeze, I freeze up my sleeves
We gettin' money like it grow on trees
Stay on my Qs, I stay on my Ps
After I'm done, then you will acknowledge
I'm the president, never went to college
I'm a bad bitch, I don't need no stylist
Tell a bitch, hollas when she get my dollas
Bitches talk shit, but what is you sayin'?
Got the illest dude in the game speakin' my name
I'm the one, I'm the one, you heard me?
Same number they stitched on McGrady jersey
If I show you how to do it, would you reimburse me?
Let me put on my pumps, let me grab my skirtsy
I am such a little lady, let me do my curtsy

Your new lesson is to realize the mission when you hear it
Emceein, see I got this in my spirit
I got verses like Mahalia singin' church hymns
So strap up because you skatin' on ice that's wild thin
A weak foundation doesn't make a good home
That's why mine is built on chrome microphones
We bout to do it theoretically, unsteadily, to the medley
Come on
It's the complete Kamaal, unique, Fareed, breed
That'll keep you broke down like a Ross 5 speed
So move buddy, a yo we got to get this money
In this land of dead and crummy, ain't a damn thing funny
A yo, shout out to Mobb Deep, the Extra P
Busta Rhymes, De La, the J Beez, and don't sleep
We got reality for the cabbage
Staying sincere to this, so I know we gonna manage
Give me, liberty in mass amounts and Swiss bank accounts
With the sustainer, it'll be real
So me and my brothas, we can sit down and build
Like Rampage with that Last Boy Scout appeal
We got that silk, satin, Manhattan intelligence feel
That keeps everything on even keels
So all you slow brothas talkin' yang, ya poo-tang
Now, we gonna show you how the real crew bang

A yo, I bring it to you live kid, Queens niggas love static
Your rap's had it, braggin' more numbers than mathematics
I get brains on Craftmatics and leave your wet dreams shattered
That's the same guy be skeetin' in your mugshot
I stay hot like summertime on LBQ and boo-boos
The love shack is 1-9-2, my joint's smooth
To watch y'all niggas fall like Lin Que
I keep it brand new like school shoppin', it's on and poppin'
The club peeps this nigga's steez like radars
You get laid off while I'll be gaming ghetto girl like 8-Off
The verdict's in, I be the Luke of Linden
Give up your goods cuz it's the start of your endin'

(Where ya at?) We get this money for these kids
(Where ya at?) We bout to build the foundation

[Verse 3: Phife Dawg]
Now, all that Glock totin' trash you talk will not prevail
It's stale, you'll either be dead or in jail
I keep it realer than the logo on milk
Denouncing tough guy wannabes that look smoother than silk
That's the sound of the man getting yanked off the stage
Trying to front like he mad paid
Sucking so bad, we threw his mama off the train (insane)
MCs are just givin' it all away (OK)
Who said him know about the Quest-like sound?
Mess around and get your ass knocked down (clown)
I dedicate this to the posers that play hard
You wanna hear some rhymes, well then bring your bodyguard
So he can peep the worldwide Willie that we display
Leaving all MCs in complete disarray
I beez a veteran MC, crushing crews for years
You frontin' hard when you softer than the Berenstain Bears
Yeah, chumps be like ""Phife, that ain't fair""
'Fuck outta here, do I look like I care?
Come off my stage before I grab ya neck and handle ya
Wet ya like punani, then dry you like Canada
Shaheed Muhammad's on the Gemini mixer
Peace to Derrick Coleman, Mad Max and the Sixers
I'm cappin' hard cuz I got this rap shit sold
From Linden Boulevard down to Cascade Road
You know my steez, I treat hip-hop like a sport
Holdin' down fort up on Martinique Court like...

(Where ya at?) We get this money for these kids

Yo, I been nice since you had to put your hat in your sleeve
And break arms like Seagal, don't wear your heart on your sleeve
There's two things in life: fact and belief
Yea, and you best to believe, it's a fact I just rolled the leaf
Def Jux don't care about your culture or creed
Or the color you bleed, and it'd be Ox versus aliens
All you see is martians piled up
As the yeast in my b-boy chest rises up
You ain't a convict, you got caught jaywalking
And you don't know the alphabet, but you still talking
Well I got a blade too
And I know it's sharp enough to cut you
They call me Starving Harlem Scissor Tongue, I lick tissue
And pardon me, my lava just spit almost hit you
You know I got lava spit, and got a lot of it
We can call it in the air, this is the rain drop missiles

Live from the 1-3-5, representing niggas that strive
Straight through hard times trying to survive
Inside New York, the island of crime
Where the most violent of minds, walking these blocks
Stay eyeing on mine, yo my brain sparks like sporting a Glock
I might start firing live, straight off of the top
Cannibal Ox, inspiring minds, flipping on tracks
Spitting these live animal raps
I'm strangling cats, sliding on my side of the map
Thinking he all, you ain't got it like the mighty, matter of fact
You small, claiming you large?
I'm pulling your card, leaving you scarred
Repping tragedy, warfare, but nod yo, this god writes like
Travelled bars adapt to stars and shine to
Rap Allah, yo we crack cigars to get through stress
Pulling on sess, stabbing these birds, loving the sex

Smoking the rent, watching these cops, popping on blocks
Screaming y'all niggas ain't nothing to wet

Starving niggas had to still spit it live on the set

Brand New Day,Outasight,"['alternative', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Outasight]
I’m on the corner of the avenue, pocket full of revenue
Feels incredible, some want to put you on the pedestal
Knock you back down, let it go, it’s inevitable
When my time comes, I’ll find a way to really see
Through the rainy days, I was amazed
I was afraid of what I could be
Naysayers feel best when your name’s being put down
I open my eyes from a long night and look around

[Hook]
And I don’t feel the same
And I know something changed
From the way I walk, way I talk, brand new day

[Verse 2: Outasight]
And admiration and hating have a very thin line of separation
Either way, you a part of the conversation
So my dialect the original, a language untainted
When my name comes up, no one sends me on my way
I follow my own directions, my own road, I’m never swayed
It was too simple to start fussing over what’s expected
It was too easy to stand alone and feel so neglected
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Outasight]
And thinking of my social status used to have me at my maddest
Dreams of living plush and lavish generated from magazines
T.V screens seemed to be the only thing that matters at me, feeling average
And when the show starts to close and the curtain falls
I hear the echoes of my love, bouncing down the halls
Into patterns of happiness, subtle depression
I’m looking in these notebooks, my regression I was stressing

[Hook 2]
And I don’t feel the same
And I know something changed
From the way I walk, way I talk, brand new day
And I don’t feel the same
And I know something changed
From the way I walk, way I talk, brand new day
And I don’t feel the same
And I know something changed
From the way I walk, way I talk, brand new day
And I don’t feel the same, oh
And I don’t feel the same
And I know something changed
From the way I walk, way I talk, brand new day
And I don’t feel the same
And I know something changed
From the way I walk, way I talk, brand new day"
The Death Of Chris Palko,Cage,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Cage]
It's been about a year since my ears tried pop
For those that missed the show: oh my god!
That psychiatrist used to hold my cock
Put nails in my head, ride me and smoke my pot
Sub Roc said: ""Chris, kep your hardcore gritty
Def Jukie t-shirt walking through cardboard city""
Positively pack plus pistols popsicles
Used to strut IV stands like canes in hospitals
I swung down on some grills with the handle
Screeched out of the parking lot then I flicked the camel
Read Cobain's journals by the fire in a flannel
Copped pills from TV but they don't switch the channel
The world is yours and you're for flies to play in
When the seeds in your eyes can fly you'll see what I'm saying
Homeless stick their hands out for change and I pay 'em
Cause they live in a box and I got a bed to lay in

(Back in the day, 1997)

The death of Chris Palko, he passed, we clapped well
Woke up during an autopsy in rap hell
Ran off dripping verses and patterns from my cut shell
Hungry MC's lap up my blood trail
In this Atmosphere, I'm unbalanced, Slug on a seesaw
Spit through Bazooka Teeth, my tongue is the C4
Need more stitches to finish displayed mental
Chris went to the hospital came home Cage Kennylz
I sunk down to my lowest in the scramble
Stepped over the body for the wallet on the mantle
Sneaker tracks of blood traced back to my vandals
By the door I'll be on the couch with a box of ammo
The world is spinning, I'm spending my cash in it
Pull up to the pump and dump some gas in it
Know a bunch of rappers that finish last in it
And they can't do shit about it
(You are shameless)
(Now let us build to the climax, shall we?)

[Camu Tao]
Now it's me still hocking loogies in the movies
Nasty with groupies, get it moving
Follow me stupid to the back of tragedies moving through it
And we'll cause problems get it moshing, popping with treatment
Get the cops to pop in from precincts
Get the girls to come in and see us, yeah
Who keep on flowing till the clothes are rolling right off your shoulders?
Who keep on going till the crowd gets open and girls take notice?
I know you notice who it is - a wizard of perfect vocals
I think it's easy when the people fiendin', it's perfect
Now it's your host with a load of soldiers
Stay fresh head to toe he's a beast on the doses
If you come close you'll get fucked up
You know you're supposed to cause
Now it's your host with a load of soldiers
Stay fresh head to toe he's a beast on the doses
If you come close you'll get fucked up
You know you're supposed to cause"
Best Day Ever,Mac Miller,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
I never take a day off
Work around the clock, my engineer gettin' paid off
Rock like Aesop, light the weed and take off
So high I cannot see, Adolf
Now I got these rappers all breakin' up a sweat
'Cause every time I get up on the mic, it come correct
And I learned it from the best, always dressed in somethin' fresh
Lookin' for a little dime, big butt and nice chest
Yes, they heard I used to rock Guess
But now I'm rockin' clothes that ain't in the stores yet
Travel back in time, I'm in a vortex
Tryna make it work out, think I need more reps
Used to take a bus, now the boy board jets
'Cause K.I.D.S. got me buzzin' like a fuckin' hornet
They say I got next, tell them that I got now
It's all Disney, boy, my family Proud
Make 'em say, ""Ow,"" make 'em say, ""Oh""
The hoes that tell me ""Yes,"" the same ones that tell ya ""No""
Whoa, I ain't just an Average Joe, way above the average flow
Boy, my life is Most Dope, uh

No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy, only laughin' like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek, ayy, ayy
And I ain't gonna wait for nothin'
'Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This gon' be the best day ever

[Verse 2]
If it ain't about a dream, then it ain't about me
Go a couple full weeks without a good night's sleep
Imagination, makin', musical creation
The journey that I'm facin' plus the paper that I'm chasin'
Got me crazy, half-insane, and with the lames I see you hatin'
But there's nothin' that you changin', thumbs up, I'm maintainin'
No complainin' when it's rainin', I'll be in another zone
Move out my mother's home to a world I call my own
I ain't gonna play around no more
Find a difference from the ground and the floor
If we got a fight, I'll be down for the war
Thumbs up, homie, I'll be sure

[Chorus]
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy, only laughin' like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet

Still I'm followin you - are you leadin me with a weapon drawn?
Co-dependent on her but got me in bed alone
You say if you love it let it go, nothin set in stone
Plus every rock they throw, I use as a stepping stone
Got questions, say the answer's better left unknown
Though I may not never see you, I should know you never gone
So I break the mirror, cause everything it's showing me is wrong
Grab your hand and go along - cause I'm followin you

I don't wanna talk, there's nothin I wanna say
The more I let 'em get to know me, the more they just run away
And that, must be your way of sayin we should stay together
I know how to fuck it up more than I can make it better
I figured folk around me would learn to take it better
Instead of tryin change me, I've been this way forever

I'm good with my insanity and fevers

A lot of times you leave me exposed

You know what it is, it's that motherfuckin'
Special made, high powered, special made forces
What up what up what up, a-yo, a-yo

[Verse 1]
Chef that fly with a meat cleaver, swing on a young nigga
Smack flames at him, no gun neither
Leave him with a bump, what the fuck
(""They say he's a swordsman"") Get that little, nigga
Who give a fuck if he's a swordsman, I'm a gunman, I run from nothing
Chain came from rent days and pumping
YSL with velours on, drawers is colorful
I do this, forever nigga, raw style
Lighting Phillies, fly by willies, can't come through
Unless your vehicle three hundred chain, silly
Laying in the park with the killers, the coupes, the villains
No rims, we just ball for the millions
The emperor of slang lords, kings get clapped in they dome
Get your throne rushed, and I ain't got a gun on
High power ninjas who touch you, lay a gun on
Drinking with the best of the hustling
[Hook]
I got butter knives, like you got butter knives
Come through huddling, run through the spot thirty times
All my niggas old school robbers, do what it do
I got a sixty-two, a black pair of goggles
Fila approaches, the Bee Hives, the vultures and the roasters
Can't come through with cedar toasters
It's going down, only in the town
Your heart get tested, and gunplay is only an investment

[Verse 2]
Flying shooters, eyewear rugers
Stars and swords in front of the building, five thousand students
Cocaine cops they know him (""They say he's a swordsman"") You already know that, man
Diamonded up, double O sevens, come through, 1-8-7
Back to the Hill in a second, yeah
Sons jump in front of them bullets, push me up in the bullet
Stay cool, I got shit, where ya weapon?
Hurricane slammers, earthquake clips and cannons
Back of the building, with the jammers
Live well, eat well, Welcome to the Terrordome, sleep well
Who don't like beef? Keep shells
I flow with the souls of sharks and criminals in they heart
Play parts of this in detail
Well carried mannered, blampers, ninjas black down
Pop up on spots and vanished (""They say he's a swordsman"")

I got butter knives, like you got butter knives
Come through huddling, run through the spot thirty times

Very good!
Who are you?
We are from the Wu-Tang
Shaolin's the foundation
From which all kung-fu springs
Buddha's name be praised

[Raekwon]
I met him by Snake Pond, my hand on the flamer, my bomb
I park, Rae, Ghost, then lit up the bong
It's nightfall, nothing here, nothing to fear
Just got things to touch on, then he walked up weird
Walked in frail as stale, his eyes were soft
His face was pale, I looked at him kneel
Just wanna talk, you a deer, starting chasing him
He jumped in the tree, had grass in his ear
(I'mma kill you nigga, you gonna have to come down)
Little did he know I was a leader, a full bred eater
Jump in new V's, shopping, had the fever
Next stop Starbucks and Spiegels, Jags had diesel
Then she walked in, fly little diva
Niggas on the scheme for your gleam, they come from your school
A bunch of snake bites, they bitch smacked Shareen
She slid in the '09 Beemer, with that sex whore Sabrina
Forging checks, live in Medina
Thanks for the info, my kinfolk, listen, Miss Window
With the big pimple on her temple
Any more knowledge is college, you gave enough to be bounced now
She shot up in Chipotle, don't quote me
917, 646, you know it's war, bitch, can't dress for nothing, she fronting
Took a piss, roll up, let's twist, pulled down my pants
Good look, and shot through her tits
Now I gotta picture who I'm looking for, fake ass Brooklyn boy
I know his fucking family, fuck 'em all
I used to love brothers, now I hate 'em
Mostly them gator boys, who stunting and they never seen nathan
Me and my real soldiers who started it, won't play part of it
But I'mma get to the bottom, I got 'em
Newspapers saying they shot 'em, but on the low
I heard he shot himself
A trip, yo, the poison me, I come from the poison bees
Where mothers run old nightclubs with tons of ki
Old lady holding them G's, dope fiends, holes in they jeans
Magicians that can make blow green
I know his whole team, no craze, dough so low
I hit 'em off mean, now he wanna hold me, no bro, B"
Crane Style,Raekwon,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Redskin leather, Indian sex
Pair of fresh Mocs on, lighting lear on my flesh
Let my arm roll, fresh off the honor roll, platinum bottles of Krug
All my niggas do what I got 'em for
Extra flashy grind, hit 'em with a crisp rhyme
Lines is nothing, blunt out, fuck him
All we know is jewelry and I mashed that, everybody excited
To see whatever bling on, smash that
Clever, more like a fox and ox together
Two stainless Glocks, rocks and a feather
Yeah, I'm from the lead era, shoot at
Anything that move, and move out America
And all we ever want is needed, seen it
Like a young Fillipino in Kuwait getting treated
Heavy horror armor, spike a bitch like her
Half a pound of good weed, then float through Gowanus
Brilliant master, sixteenth chapel in the Apple
Flooded up, Woolrich wackos
Park Hillians getting hillions, that means millions
All on feet like Nigerian

Shallah, I got 'em
Heatseeking missile spit, don't even try to hide, nigga
Sizzle through your skin bars, call me cyanide, bitch
Try me if you want, homey, violation's a no-no
I am the health hazard, skull & bone, poisonous logo
Unleash the dragon, massacre the scene
I'm spitting, burn a hole through the speaker, and start melting the street up
Somebody please call the fire department
And I'm a strong believer, ya'll know that I ain't the one to start with
Cuz once the fuse is lit and we strike a match and the spark smell
My face bleed and we nam them up like ox tail
Ya'll see what's happening, ya'll know what the truth is
Somebody please ask Shallah Rae why he making me do this
Cuz once I finish dudes, it's unfortunate for them yappers
Throw them in the trash, they ain't no recyling bin for rappers
I microphone control, it's the current dominant factor
The records been bodied, I personally request the pastor, gone"

Breaker Breaker,GZA,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: GZA]
Breaker, breaker one nine, clear the line
Can you read me? Shortage on rhymes
MCs should expect the worst
I stay alert and shoot first

[Verse 1: GZA]
This is not a test, it's difficulty
Picture closely, the ignorant mostly
Blind, deaf, dumb, your mind left numb
Lost soul who failed to hear the roll of the drum
In the bottom of your bomb shelter, still felt the
Heavy blast that blew off the masks of twelve welders
The math of an elder, praise the Lord, thank you Genius
Operation: Project English
Commander the chief of flight style, check the aircraft
Glide like the Frisbee, Digi they Disney
To check fault in oneself is pure loveliness
You break the mirror that remind you of your ugliness
So when I bust, no one is untouched
Some returning with the mic clutched, like such
Who plan but never execute. He had the heat in his
Hand, but yo he didn't shoot, therefore
Your mechanism of material better be sickly
Or let your lead spread incredibly quickly
I move bravely, travellin' on a horse
On the battlefield, surrounded by the lost
Of those who plotted with the brains of animals
My high molecular structure be untangible
The name ring a bell, killable two syllable
The Wu is comin' through, the outcome is critical
To be blunt, the beat was cooked up like coke goods
The rhyme first came to me in the oak woods
Up to no good, rap icon
Milk the industry like the Wall Street junk bond
You see the bright stone, I got your height sewn
Direct current, that move through the mic-phone
Key contributor, well-known major factor
Rhyme distributor, the drive of a tractor
Who run ya down if you don't move or wanna linger
Linger, linger, linger, linger

Breaker, breaker one nine, clear the line
Can you read me? Shortage on rhymes
MCs should expect the worst
I stay alert and shoot first
Breaker, breaker one nine, clear the line
Can you read me? Shortage on rhymes
MCs should expect the worst
I stay alert and shoot first

[Verse 2: GZA]
The immortality of my fame is the measure of other's torture
Burnt offer, from a flamin' author
The falconer who flies enough birds for the chase
Strictly excel in what is excellence with grace
The significance was not the vulgar applause of interest
But the feelin' that exit, completion of a sentence
With age and experience, my reason ripens
I strike on you Vikings, slash like a hyphen
If you enter the house of fortune by the gate of pleasure
You will leave by sorrow, the flow measures
Everything fails with the unfortunate
Learned that recordin' it, so my mind broaden it
Track records ranks us with the exceptional
Extreme complex physics, high technical
The truth is usually seen and rarely heard
What's more dangerous than hatred is the word
You wild cards, jack of all trades
Those who parade their positions show their spades
A large flock of MCs, they figure to be taught
It ain't hard to see why I'm vigorously sought
[Chorus]
Breaker, breaker one nine, clear the line
Can you read me? Shortage on rhymes
MCs should expect the worst
I stay alert and shoot first
Breaker, breaker one nine, clear the line
Can you read me? Shortage on rhymes
MCs should expect the worst

To fulfill the prophecy of the Wu-Tang, of the Wu-Tang

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
In the Polo store, fronting in war clothes, it been like this
From right in time when I was nine years old
I was a hot mess, smoking cheeba, running with stolen speakers
Dropped beepers, even wore a victory vest
I run with niggas, digging knots from niggas, running out the school
Stunting, back of the bus, flashing the ox
Rock the V-Gooses, everything we wore was name brand
Sold three lucy's, just to get on call plan
R.E.C. Poss' Rockers, the Blip Brothers
Even the Spin Doctors, sat and smoke blunts, I been bopping
All my kins blew up, we grew up with
We used to do what? Running through the sewers and then shopping
Pick pocket, deuce baby, take it in truce, baby
You know how we do, come run in my boots, baby
The niggas came through, touch the God, here Shallah
Ever since went from ninjas to gem stars, sing Rah

Hands down, I can handle you, you half man, half animals
If you are what you eat, and eat pussy, you'se a cannibal
And stopping me, is what you can not do
Either get in the game, get out the way, or get ran right through
I ain't no different, Method Man like you

Ok baby here I go
Tip the waiter
Tip the vallet
Tap dancin' on these haters
Life is such a ballet
Got a ballerina
Look like Halle Berry
In the Audi
Belly button steeze bitch I'm outie
And I'm chillin' in the spot
With my people
Got it locked until the morning
I'mma do by 23
What they couldn't do by 40
Got a shorty with a Beamer
Her ex-boyfriend was a cheater
So I'm driving while she's laughing
Cause he keeps trying to reach her
They ask me son why you stuntin'
I say because I love it
It so fun I'm trying to get it in abundance
My girl does the same shit
She trippin'
So she got a lotta luggage
And that Louis bag is speedy
So she runnin'

I'm on Bedford and Halsey
We livin'
We the same but we so different
I'm telling you right now I'm bout to get it
So when I do it
You can say you was there when I did it
I flip it
Inside out I raid the fridge
I'm breakin' all the dishes

Turn a friend out of a hater
Turn a loser to a Laker
A winning mentality is what makes the great even greater
Girls tell me I'm handsome
But I look even better on paper

All the rumors, all the gossip
All the hearsay, all the nonsense
Can be deaded if you just keep bringing hot shit
I told them baby watch us
While we look at our watches
And talkin' shit is too much fun
So I ain't bein' modest
I'm sayin'
Ya'll ain't with us

Ain't been home in a week
But I look like I just stepped out
Louis'd up
Gucci down
Hermes'd out
Damn, ya'll just missed out

Devil horns to all my haters
Dirty weed up in your papers
Get your food spit on by waiters
Ask your girl for dirty favors
Shave for days with dirty razors
Get your face bit off by gators
Hope you never meet your savior or your maker
And you end up all alone
Die slow
Fuck your feeling's bitch
Combat boots got me feeling real militant
Outfit crazy
Wrist game villanous
Black shades got me feelin' real Bob Dylan-ish

[Verse 4]
Yeah and I don't care if ya motherfuckers like me
Bigger problem
I just got barbecue sauce on my white tee
Wardrobe stupid
But look what's standing next to me
You can stunt
But a bad bitch is always the best accessory
Grew up in townhouse
That shit ain't have no yard
So I'mma go hard
Until I can afford Goyard
And Gucci that's my motherfucking duffel
Half-caff Macchiato
And a Belgium shuffle

Plays volleyball in the Valley

Watching for the one time

Hey
Let me slow it down
Thought I told you
D-Why's bout to come around

If Don't Flatter Yourself is a movie
Then consider this a trailer
If you wanna size me up
Then you can catch me at the tailor
See you later sailor

For a leader can lead his team onto failure

I even gon' front man, a nigga tryna cut
I ain't tryna take his place, I just want to hit you up
When that nigga ain't around I just want to pick you up
Bring you back to the crib, sip a little liquor up
Then I give you a massage, get you wet, get you up
Then I give you what you want, if it's clean I lick it up
Now you can do me, if it's right my shit is up
Face down on your stomach, take that ass and lift it up
[Chorus]
Then I do my thang, now shawty listen up
Yeah, your pussy do bang, got no problem hooking up

I ain't tryna be ya man, I ain't tryna split you up
'Cause I do my thang, now shawty listen up
Yeah, your pussy do bang, got no problem hooking up
Just remember why I call ya, and why we getting up
I ain't tryna be ya man, I ain't tryna split you up

[Verse 2]
I be that nigga on the side when you feel you want to creep
When you in the bed alone while ya man run the street
All you got to do is dial, let the phone ring twice
Baby girl I love your style, I won't even think twice
I ain't even gonna front, man a nigga tryna beat
I ain't tryna wife you up, though you is a dime piece
I just love the way you ride like a certified freak
How you throw it right back, got a niggas thighs weak
So just hit me when you want it, you know how to find me
Got no times for no games, you know how the grind be
But-I'm a make the time if you bout' it dial me
I'm a make you say my name like a caller ID

[Chorus]
Then I do my thang, now shawty listen up
Yeah, your pussy do bang, got no problem hooking up
Just remember why I call ya, and why we getting up
I ain't tryna be ya man, I ain't tryna split you up
'Cause I do my thang, now shawty listen up
Yeah, your pussy do bang, got no problem hooking up
Just remember why I call ya, and why we getting up
I ain't tryna be ya man, I ain't tryna split you up
[Verse 3]
Give you money to get ya hair did (he can do that)
Pay for dinner and a movie (yea he can do that)
Work you out in the bed (maybe he can do that)
But I know you much rather call me to do that
And girl I'm with it! Haha, yeah

So let me hit it!

[Chorus]
Then I do my thang, now shawty listen up

Just remember why I call ya, and why we getting up
I ain't tryna be ya man, I ain't tryna split you up
'Cause I do my thang, now shawty listen up
Yeah, your pussy do bang, got no problem hooking up
Just remember why I call ya, and why we getting up

It Aint Easy,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Keepin' it real

[Verse 1]
I take a shot of Hennessy
Now I'm strong enough to face the madness
Nickel bag full of cess weed laced with hash
Phone calls from my niggas on the other side
Two childhood friends just died, I couldn't cry
A damn shame, when will we ever change?
And what remains from a 12-gauge to the brain?
Arguments with my boo, it's true
I spend more time with my niggas than I do with you
But everywhere it's the same thang
That's the game, I'll be damned if a thang changed
Fuck the fame, I'll be hustlin' to make a million
Lord knows ain't no love for us ghetto children
So we cold, Rag-top slowin' down, time to stop for gas
Beep my horn for a hoochie with a proper ass
Uh, it ain't easy, that's my motto
Drinkin' Tanqueray straight out the bottle
Everybody wanna know if I'm insane
My baby mama got a mind full of silly games
And all the drama got me stressin' like I'm hopeless
I can't cope, me and the homies smokin' roaches
'Cause we broke, late night, hangin' out 'til the sunrise
Gettin' high, watchin' the cops roll by
It ain't easy; that's right, it ain't easy
[Hook]
—easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?
It ain't easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?
It ain't easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary or will I stay free?

[Verse 2]
I can't sleep, niggas plottin' on me, kill me while I'm dreamin'
Wake up sweaty and screamin'
'Cause I can hear them suckers schemin'
Probably paranoid, problem is them punks be fantasizin'
A brother bite the bullet, open fire and I died
I wonder why, it's just the way it is, even now
Lookin' out for these killa kids 'cause they wild
Bill Clinton, can you recognize a nigga representin'
Doin' twenty to life in San Quentin?
Gettin' calls from my nigga Mike Tyson, ain't nothin' nice
Yo 'Pac, do somethin' righteous with your life
And even though you're innocent you still a nigga
So they figure, rather have you behind bars than triggers
But I'ma hold you down and holla Thug Life
Lickin' shots 'til I see my niggas free on the block
But no, it ain't easy, ha ha ha
'Til I see my niggas free on the block, uh, it ain't easy
[Hook]
It ain't easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?
It ain't easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?
It ain't easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary—

[Verse 3]
Lately been reminiscin' about Peppermint Schnapps
In Junior High hit the block
Keep an eye on the cops while d-boys slang rocks
Just a project kid without a conscience
I'm havin' dreams of hearin' screams at my concerts
Me and all my childhood peers
Through the years tryin' to stack a little green
I was only seventeen when I started servin' fiends
And I wish there was another way to stack a dolla
Sold my Impala 'cause these hard times make me wanna holla
Will I live to see tomorrow? Am I fallin' off?
I hit the weed and then proceed to say: ""Fuck all of y'all!""
Ain't nobody down with me, I'm thuggin'
I can't go home, 'cause muh'fuckers think I'm buggin'
So now I'm in this high-powered cell at the county jail
Punk judge got a grudge, can't post no bail
What do I do in these county blues?
Gettin' battered and bruised by the you-know-who
And these fakes get to shakin' when they face me
Snakes ain't got enough nuts to replace me
Sittin' in this livin' hell, listenin' to niggas yell
Tryin' to torture 'em to tell, I'm gettin' mail
But ain't nobody sayin' much, the same old nuts
Is makin' bucks while these sluts is gettin' fucked
They violated my probation
And it seems I'll be goin' on a long vacation
Meanwhile, it ain't easy—
No, it ain't easy
[Hook]
It ain't easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?
It ain't easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?
It ain't easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?
It ain't easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?
It ain't easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?

This morning, you've got time for a hot home cooked breakfast
Delicious and piping hot in only three microwaved minutes
Are you kidding?!

[Verse 1: Dave]
Yo, pretty packages of frosted delights
(Look, it comes with a toy! I like that)
(I wanna number four, number six, and throw in a plastic donut)
Just enjoy the gritty crunch that tastes just like chicken
Rappers of many bite sizes
(Man, are you freaking blind
That's a rock)
All mixed in the pot full
Momma's homemade from scratch, but (not quite)
Toasted over flames they be tasting (quite right)

All hail King Neptune and his water-breathers
No snail thing too quick for his water-feeders
""Don't waste time"" with your net
Our net worth is set
Ready, go many know others but
We be the colors of the mad and the wicked
We be bad, we re-brick it
With the twenty-four hour sign
Shower mine habits
While you dine like rabbits
With the crunchy, crunchy carrots
(Oh that's chicken)
Gotta have it super fast
[Interlude]
A whole line of breakfasts you've got time for

[Hook: Gruff Rhys]
Super fast, super fast
I come in last, but just in time for breakfast
Keep us through, keep us through, whatever blue

Hey Young World,Slick Rick,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back

[Chorus]
Hey young world... the world is yours
Hey young world... the world is yours
Young world young world... the world is yours
Young world

[Verse 1]
This rap here... it may cause concern it's
Broad and deep... why don't you listen and learn
Love, peace, happiness... that once was strong
But due to society... even that's turned wrong
Times have changed... ay it's cool to look bummy
And be a dumb dummy and disrespect your mummy
Have you forgotten... who put you on this Earth?
Who brought you up right... and who loved you since your birth?
Reward is a brainwashed kid going wild
Young little girls already have a child
Bad company... hey, now you've been framed
Your parents are hurting... hurting and ashamed
You're ruining yourself... and your mommy can't cope
Hey, little kids don't follow these dopes
Here's a rule for the non fool.. your life don't drool
Don't be a fool like those that don't go to school
Get ahead... and accomplish things
You'll see the wonder and the joy life brings
Don't admire thieves 'cause... hey, they don't admire you
Their time's limited, hardrocks' too
So listen, be strong, scream whoopee-doo
Go for yours, 'cause dreams come true
And you'll make your mommy proud... so proud of you too
And this is a message... that the Ruler Rick threw
And it's true
[Refrain]
You know, you know what, you know what, you know what?
We like to party, like to party
You know, you know what, you know what?
We like to party (Hey young world, the world is yours)

You know, you know what, you know what, you know what?
We like to party, like to party

""Yo peep this""

[Verse 2]
Hey Mr. Bigshot... hey, don't you look fly?
But you don't have a dollar... ohhhh, my my my
You've been fightin again and, you forgot why
Hey kid, walk straight, master your high
Why? Because you make your family cry
And all jokes aside, are you in good health?
Hey little boy... now have you really checked yourself?
You're a disgust, you know someone that I can't trust, you'd
Steal mom's welfare... and you'd run and buy some dust, and
Plus, I must say... big shot, you're not
Your friends are talking and I'm hearing that your girls are what?
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
And while you're at it... go get a suit for a job
You see you're actin like this urge is demanding
C'mon, wake up... have some understanding
Society's a weak excuse for a man
It's time for the brothers... it's time trying to take the stand
Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you, he
Guides you... and he watched you as you grew, plus
Past the age of... a little child, that's true
But folks your age don't act like you do, so
So be mature... and put the point to a halt
And if you're over eighteen... I wish you'd act like an adult
Don't live in a world... of hate, hate, hate
Pull yourself together... and get yourself straight
Men don't steal... hey, most don't borrow
And if you smoke crack... your kids'll smoke crack tomorrow
So be more mature... and kids do your chores
Make your own money... hey, be proud that's yours
You know why, 'cause that's a man... that's brains, no spite
Stayin out of trouble... when it comes in sight
And a man never loses a fight... in God's sight
'Cause righteous laws are overdue
And this is a message that the Ruler Rick threw
And it's true
[Refrain]
You know, you know what, you know what, you know what?
We like to party, like to party
You know, you know what, you know what, you know what?
We like to party, like to party

Yo, pass off, man
You know what it is, man
It's that shit, yo, Alchemist, what up?
Good looking

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Ferry Boat killas, Park Hillas, infra red lasers
On the top of the ceilings, can't sneak by
Go downs is like blow hounds, we smother the block
Jumping in front of cars, lending niggas four pounds
Walk, keep it moving, yo, hop in the range
I know you real, cuz I raised you, not gon' front on your aim
We spit together, rocking wrist lights, stunting, right in front of
The parking lot
I'm like that shark wearing, lighting, been Niking
One bling, two bling no, only Boeings
And trips to Australia, yo, my niggas is smoke fiends
Fuck in every part of the planet, slam a forty with a salmon
Hit your ho on target, we family
These are big niggas, grown men, who travel the world
Calling global drug dealing niggas, moguls
Never locals, only courts I now is sober
And this is real nigga food, Chef giving out his soul food
[Interlude: Raekwon]
Get a plate, man, for real, man
Come eat, man

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Bulldogs they calling, phantom doors lift up, crawling
Kiss Shallah hand in the Holland
Larry and his guns is weird, six hundred onions a year
No more running, see the morgue, shorty
Wild nights, crew gunning cats, animal jackets and axes
Bulletproof buses, forty backs
Niggas is Romans, then turn around and they gon', then
Hoods is paro', niggas is logged in
Channel to channel, hammer to hammer
Rock a bandana knife like Rambo on the scrambler
Get high, trust your trigger man, logic is the bigger man
Get shit done, hit Orlando
New improved killas is beemer, plasma walls with the ninas
Stick your arm in the back, you jink
Thirty seven, three one five, eleven oh nine
With two T's, it's like rolling up new trees

Light up, man, light up, man
Open that nigga, I'mma blow ya, I'mma give ya a hundred, nigga
Just for that right there, my arm is..."
The Uppercut,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: 2Pac Talking]
I wanted to bring back that reality
But nobody can ever be confused and think I'm fuckin Mike Tyson
And I'm the heavyweight champion, I'm a little nigga
That's why its so raw to just watch me battle lions
'Cause I'm a little skinny nigga battlin' niggas three times my size

Watch this uppercut, here it comes..
Watch the jab nigga...ugh...here it come
Look out, watch my arms..

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now see so many motherfuckers wanna take a piece
Comin' equipped with some shit that niggas just can't believe
I pull a trick from my sleeve now kamikaze
I'm all over that nigga, come identify the body
My middle finger to you ho niggas
Run up on me and I'll be forced to let it go nigga
I ain't the one you wanna try, why? I stayin' high
I hit this blunt and watch these motherfuckers die
Who's runnin' these streets? I said that cocaine
'Cause in the dope game, niggas'll die 'fore they go broke mane
Another hustler makin' major cash
'Til the punk police come an raid ya ass
Now you stressed doin' fed time
And its a bitch 'cause the judge gave you eight years
You doin 6 and we know that you can't hang
You a trick rolled over, turned snitch like a biatch
[Chorus: 2Pac]
Now you know you should have ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin from the uppercut, fucked, so what's up? nigga!
Now you know you should have ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from this uppercut, stuck, so what's up? nigga!

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
They got a nigga in the dice game
I'm feelin' lucky but the nigga just a little bigger
He tryin' fuck me out my cash, I'ma blast nigga
He don't know I gotta tell ya like the last nigga
Gotta go, no need to run for the trunk, I get 'em up
Left to right, my uppercut'll hit 'em up
I'm known to walk the streets on any block
I love my niggas, but I ain't puttin' down my Glock
The gunshots rang when I lose nigga, and ooh nigga
I'ma show you not to ever play a true nigga (haha)
Lay it down just to prove it
And fuck the rappin' motherfucker we can do this

Now you know you should have ducked nigga

Now you know you should have ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from this uppercut, stuck, so what's up? nigga!
[Verse 3: E.D.I. and Young Noble]
They claim that we violent, we named after tyrants
This revolution won't be televised, we keep it silent
Roll on our enemies, beat 'em at they own game
Molotov cocktails, releasing up in flames
Tired of bein' stepped on, sick of bein' held back
Lookin' through my rearview, thinkin' 'bout the payback
Wanna see my kids grow don't know if I'ma make it though
One more nigga came up short in the ghetto
Society lied to me so I'm strapped with the metal
Push ya middle fingers up nigga if you a rebel
Have ya face down goin' in ya pockets if ya let 'em
I done lost too many homies for me to ever forget 'em
I done made so many mistakes but still I don't regret 'em
I'm a product of the pimp, the pusher, and the reverend
I'm a product of the block, the fiends and the felons
We all lost souls tryna find our way to heaven

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Now you know you should have ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from the uppercut, fucked, so what's up? nigga!
Now you know you should have ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from this uppercut, stuck, so what's up? nigga!

Spent a few years trying to understand why
When, how is it now I'm so anti
Face asked if you've ever seen a man cry
I think before that shit ain't even pan right
So I don't look at rap dudes like you fans might
Rude, true it's skewed I got a slant eye
With God as my security guard that's why
I'm walking around feeling like I can't die
Or I'm feelin' like opportunity ran by (me)
And I'm chasin' it or am I facin' it

I'm an addict got a habitual habit and I don't avoid voids
Good at substitution replacing shit
I'm just trying to find my place with shit
Pacing quick I ain't go no patience with
Niggas that can't speak they mind
What the fuck they got a mouth for?
Me, I'm so full of rage so used to being caged
I probably shouldn't be outdoors
Everybody so scared of the truth
Look in my eyes you stare at the truth
They doing interludes and every interview
Talkin' bout they're prepared to shoot - bom, bom
How thoughtful, won't resort to gettin' near a booth
They awful what I do to them unlawful
Boss dude ain't got a higher up to resort to
Just giving yourself a bad name
Yackidy yack the threats in fact is that lame
You can't tell that acts arranged
Think I'm wearing a bulls eye
Just all them cats got bad aim I'll explain
I'm past real they past phony
Ignore the personal and physical attacks on me
I remain cool relaxed homie
Brand new I ain't got a scratch on me
So what your squad gonna do
Lay a hand on me I'll lay a hollow on you
Change hands tap his pockets run his wallet on through
Every club in New York nigga bottles on you!
Better tell 'em what reluctance is
I'm controlled by uncontrolled substances
Truth be told, I'll show him what substance is
Know I'm nice but when I boast I'm only rubbing it in (NIGGAS)
Got beat up ignored in school
Signed a deal niggas thought you was cool
Only take one quarter to slaughter your crew (SLAUGHTERHOUSE)
If your resume got deaded today they'd call you a fool (HOW BOUT THAT)
All them years rapping, nothing else happening
You need a new day to day
Old heads in the game with no other way to get paid
Gasping timeout take a break from the play or grab a Gatorade
Bad contract team can't make a trade
Majors fucking you in the ass you gonna stay a slave
5'9"" in my ear saying, ""Hey, behave!""
But shit is fucked up and I blame it on the way it was paved
I chill for the sake of your age
You great live but let me know when that stage get appraised
All in raising the stakes
Swear you and your label should pray
Thank God I was placed in this decade by mistake
I don't belong here dad fucked mom in the wrong year
Wrong peers amongst niggas with wrong ears
Wrong dancing funny sounds every songs weird
Wrong fashion its like everybody's gone queer
Be clear I ain't here to be friends
You can dislike me I ain't here to pretend
Run but you can't hide I can't lie
Told niggas in the first two bars I was anti

Say anything goes, tomorrow same clothes
We probably order movies, we probably lay together
But we can't stay together, that's when I gotta tell her
[Girl]
I have no doubt, that I could love you forever
The only trouble is, you really don't have the time
You've got one night only [x4]

Don't open that fucking safe, nigga
Yo, lord, yo, nigga what up
All this shit right here, turn that shit down, nigga
This school is the hardest school, B, what Dart School?
You know how to get a taste, man, calm down, man

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
So much colors on my ice, freeze the ghetto man
Me and my microphone knifed up in the Meadowlands
Skinny chain on, family, that's thirty grand
Dirty crown in position, yeah, worthy man
Bezels is like metals, nigga, hold the Phantom
Convertible roof, hard headed, angry amber
If I'm pitching, giving bricks out to baby Rambo
I'm on Rodeo with yae yo, fifty baby hammers
The new shits that blow a building up, crazy damage
If it's priors, I do my own dirt, spray the cameras
So many soldiers, no soft niggas in the slammers
We run wild like 'lo gazelles and baby pandas
Small nigga with his gun rum, crazy gamblers
I'm uptown fronting, the fans know what gave me grammers
So when it's over I'mma fly to my lady mansion
And get riced up, some Japanese baby salmon

Blowing holes in your tipi, little wise ass
We disguised as, some niggas who gon' rob, blast
Paint thousands of pictures, this my drive, smash
Guillotines, wolverines, fly assassins

We disguised as, some niggas who gon' rob, blast
Paint thousands of pictures, this my drive, smash
Guillotines, wolverines, fly assassins

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Back and dogging this mic, give me my gwop, homey
I rhyme for under the stairs niggas who hate phonies
Keep it funky, I got to, it's kings only
Timberlands, hard denims, rings only
Rock a big ass gun, when you come from me
Your president of your country, yelling 'big dummy'
Chef a fly ass nigga, he cook every Sunday
He had a beef on the runway, making shit ugly
I had on alligators clarks, camouflage rugby
Bad bitch from Brazil, who fuck, never suck me
We was cooling in the Trump section, throwing bubbly
Got my niggas with the guns out, bowling lovely
When it's on, you gon' remember, ooh, you made him hungry
Top three of the east, nigga, well what, what, B
Pay for that mil, for real, max comfy
Or you'll be one of them niggas that say ""son me""

Lights, all of the lights

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Lights on, I see your face
She eat me up, she got expensive taste
I see you dreaming, but you still awake
Big slices, that's how you cut the cake
It's cold as hell, I show and tell
Weezy home, our nigga out of jail!
In this ""give-or-take"" world, I got what it takes
Put you out your misery: Kathy Bates
I'm Young Money, I'm Cash Money
If we could buy time, I'd spend my last money
Now I'm spending time, you in the blind
This little light of mine, I'ma let it shine
Bright lights, night lights, headlights, shh!
No lights but them infrared lights
Long knife, don't like to ask twice
You killing me baby, this the past life
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Ready, set, go, go, go, go, go
Go 'til you can't go no more
I'm ill times ill, dope plus dope
""Westside bitch,"" quote, unquote
Whoa there, boy, don't go there, ho
If you cross that line, I might overload
I swear these lights-lights-lights be talking to me
But I can't read Morse Code
Why every rapper named ""Big"" got bodied, huh?
But every rapper named ""Sean"" got money? Ooh
Well, I guess my chances are fifty-fifty
But my vision is 20/20, so I be counting a hundred hundreds
Like, oh, my Allah, Lordy Lordy Lordy
I took your chick, now you want beef, and I'm just chuckling like I'm Porky
'Cause you spent all day with her spooning
I spent all night with her forking
There's a one-way ticket to Hell and they want these bullets to book it for me, man
I'm shitting on every statistic that said I'd be dead or fuckin' broke
This is history, your kids' kids' kids' kids' kids gon' book report me, what?
And I think they want to murder me
I'm shining hard (Hard), 'cause, bitch, I'm an emergency
[Chorus: Rihanna & Choirs, Big Sean]
Turn up the lights in here, baby (B-I-G)
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this (I do it)
Turn up the lights in here, baby (Boi, boi, boi)
You know what I need (Yeah)
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights (You know a nigga so good)

[Bridge: Alicia Keys, Big Sean, Elton John]
Whoa, whoa (So good, Westside)
I tried to tell you but all I could say was ohh (I'm so hood, I do it)
Whoa, whoa

[Verse 3: Drake]
Bad decisions, good intentions, man I'm riding, Weezy with me
I just stepped out of the strip club, made five-thousand look like fifty
I spend all my time in Houston, smoke that kush, but I don't do Whitney
I don't do Britney, I don't do Lindsay
I made two million since last Wednesday
And I hate y'all! Y'all got too much free time
Saying I ain't drop shit, everything gon be fine
Worrying about your old girl, trying to see if she's mine
Nigga she's with me when she tells you she needs some ""me time,"" it's our time, so fuck y'all
I'm really about to go Spring Break now
And start taking shots in this muthafucka
And you didn't have all that ass last month girl
What, you get some shots in this muthafucka?
Yeah, we got the Roc in this muthafucka
You thought niggas was going pop in this muthafucka?
Young Money, power, respect in this bitch
You would think we got the LOX in this muthafucka
I made mistakes, I made some bread
I even made a way for them to get ahead
To my surprise, nobody replacing me
Take Care and Carter IV, it won't be long 'til they can see the lights
(Lights on) And I'm on one, I got one
You a pussy, nigga, I'm not one, so call it a night, call it a night
(Lights on) And I run this, and y'all know that
I take the purple and pour that all in the Sprite, all in the Sprite
[Interlude: Kid Cudi, Drake, Rihanna & Fergie]
Gettin' mine, baby (Yeah)
Gotta let these niggas know, yeah (Shout out my nigga Cudi too, that's my motherfuckin' nigga for real, man)
Gettin' right, babe (Shout out Cole)
You should go and get ya own (Think we got a buzz now, nigga, fuck y'all niggas, man)
We're going all the way this time (I'm here)

[Outro 1: Fergie, with Rihanna, Choirs]
We going all the way this time
Lights, lights
We going all the way this time (All of the Lights, all of the lights)
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time (All of the lights!)

All of the lights

Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything

Can you do me a favor and call me later?
‘Cause I don’t feel like talking right now, no
Can you do me a favor and call me later?
‘Cause I don’t feel like talking right now, no

[Verse 1: Outasight]
First thing I do when I roll up out of my bed is…
Put a pot of coffee on and try and clear my head instead
I check the blackberry on the corner of my couch
And it says around 100 new messages over one damn night
Can’t understand a word it read, see, I wouldn’t lie to you
If it’s fine with you, I’ll hit you back a little later
Sorry if I miss you, I’m taking today off
Don’t take my alone time as a sign of disrespect
It’s anyone in particular that I’m ditching
Put the phone on the counter and leave my kitchen
Throw some clothes on, brush my teeth and exit
Hear a ringing and start spitting…

[Hook 2]
Can you do me a favor and call me later?
‘Cause I don’t feel like talking right now, no
[Verse 2: Outasight]
See, I got mom talking about how I need to pay tickets
Pops ask about music everyday in case he missed it
The girl wanna chill every single hour
Electric company threatened to cut the power
I got homies rolling L’s, asking when we gonna spark it
Super hit me up, late rent on the apartment
Management wonder which tracks are hits
Record label keep trying to get me in they office
See, I wouldn’t lie to you, if it’s fine with you
I’ll hit you back a little later, sorry if I miss you, I’m taking today off
Don’t take my alone time as a sign of disrespect
It’s not you in particular that I’m avoiding
The idea of disappearing I’m toying ‘cause shit be getting on my nerves
For the person calling right now, they deserve…

La Petite Mort Come Die With Me,Kno,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Kno - Verse 1]

I am ten toes down
To leave you ten toes up
In a hearse with the windows up
Belly up off that cheap wine
Relax
Kick the bucket seats back
Recline while we decline
You have the hand of Antigone
I can see it in your jeans (genes)
You have suicidal tendencies
And this might be the end of me
Cus its a rough route watching you get rubbed out
Til’ the suns out
But damnit
If I have a hand in it can it still pass for abstinence?
Passive masochist, pushin your faith aside
As I take your thighs on a ride to the great divide
Face the sky innocent sinner
While I guide your Little Man in the Boat
Across the Styx River
Your body quivers beautifully
As Jodeci sings the eulogy
[Kno - Verse 2]

An eye for an eye so we’re bound the same
The candle’s lit and now you’re going down in flames
To rise like a Phoenix, the sound remains
And rigor mortis sets in
Now I’m your best friend
My destiny’s with Persephone
So its only right you get the best of me
Or whats left of me
Rest in peace to the lifeless
Closed casket, You don’t want your fam to see you like this
Your body fights in a desperate act of self-preservation
Gettin off at your Final Destination
Respiration is strained, take your last breath
As we exchange these Faces of Death
Come on"

While y'all bite like parasites and pitbulls

I don't want to think about you
All day long
I don't want to dream about you
Girl I do miss you
Just a little
Just a little
Just a little
Okay, maybe more than just a little bit

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah
I'm done confusing you girl
We both come from two different worlds
And you don't wanna come around mine
But what happened that night was the usual drill
Head over heels, got your head over heels
How many times did I say I'm no good?
Girl, even your friends know the deal
So why you phonin' me still?
If you don't hear no evil, then you won't see no evil
Girl, I don't wanna be no hero
We had a little fling on the d-low
And I ain't really sure how I feel so
I'm in the club with a bottle of verve cliquot
I can't let you be my ego
[Hook: Range]
I don't want to think about you
All day long
I don't want to dream about you
Girl I do miss you
Just a little
Just a little
Just a little
Okay, maybe more than just a little bit

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Maybe I'm used to pain
Love is a losing game
Why'd I let you feel the flame?
I think I'm falling, I refuse to say
This is never going to work at all
First of all, it's too personal
So when you phone me I've got to divert the call
Because when you take the leap you're going to fly the fall, and I
Don't want to deal with the commotion, I don't do commitments
I don't do devotion
That's why you sent a letter to me that I never opened
Give me space to breathe so I can deal with my emotions

[Hook: Range]
I don't want to think about you
All day long
I don't want to dream about you
Girl I do miss you

Believe in Me,Aroy Fogo,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","(Verse 1)
It’s feeling like my homecoming, maybe I never left
But I’m catching déjà vu as I take a breath
This is the life I envisioned in my private moments
When I’m zoning and the four walls are closing on me
Can’t see faces but I see their heads bobbing
A thousand people shouting for the music that these heads brought ‘em
Rocking to the rhythm, bouncing to percussion
The power of my lyrics is the topic of discussion
A slim nigga from the ‘View with a southern drawl
And since the 6th grade I knew that I was born to ball
Not because I am tall but ‘cause I stand tall
Keep you focused on my flow ‘cause I’m the dopest – Adderall
Writer and an orator, I give you inspiration
Food for thought, serve you dessert if you remain patient
‘Cause hard work and dedication deserves reward
So if you came to jam for you I got more in store

(Chorus)
Believe in me, ‘cause I’ll never let you down
I’m living for my city, whether dirty or pretty
Believe in me, I’m the best when I address the crowd
So say it loud and clearly if you feel me then…
[Give it up], you know you gotta (4x)
(Verse 2)
I have a new agenda now, sick of pretending how
Convinced I am convention brings security like a wedding vow
‘Cause I didn’t sign the pre-nup, and it’s time to re-up
So to my Gs get ya Gs up the way you please bruh
Chase your dreams before you start chasing greenbacks
Use your gifts from God, and you will see stacks
Work on yourself before you start working women
Follow your own vision ‘fore you have children
I ain’t preaching, just leaking game I soaked up
‘Cause I been through trials many times it was a close one
Wise men learn by watching fools gotta try it
S’why I drop knowledge on my Furious Styles shit
And my “boys in the ‘hood” know that I’m legit
So do my college kids riding on they scholarships
Don’t got a list of people who I really do this for
Guess it’s all for me ‘cause I wanna hear the crowd roar

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
One love to my family and my real homies-
The people who stayed down when I moved back to Longview
Supported choices believed in my abilities
Saw my heart when the world was judging critically
Shout out to Dru B Shinin’, he put me in the game
Shout to EyeJay for these beats cuz he knows my lane
It’s SMG shit, I feel we are the dopest
A lotta rappers do they thing but we the fuckin’ coldest
And I’m the franchise a young phenom
On my, LeBron James MVP of the season
But I don’t have to switch to get a team ready to win
Already in with veterans, so let the games begin
That’s when I grab my pen, and start to work my magic
I see the vision for my song before I start to scratch it
Against the paper and I savor every moment
‘Cause every word I speak is my atonement, I’m on it!
(Chorus x2)"
Count Stacks,Aroy Fogo,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","(Verse 1)
Freakin’ beats like I’m in between the sheets
Call me Ron Isley though I keep it more discreet
On the low from police when I’m creepin’ through the streets
‘Cause I got a lotta citations for my speed
But I feel the need to push the limit for this paper
Goin hard for the chips like an LA Laker
Not a faker- you rarely see me stuntin’
And when I get my money right you’ll never see me frontin’ (nah)
Cuz the dough can’t change me
Just make you more of what you already are
And I been a superstar, ‘cause you already hate me
I’m shining light in the dark, like the moon and the stars
Blame me, don’t respect it, forget about our presence
Criticize my whole crew, talk shit about our records
And while you makin’ fake blogs, stuntin’ on the web
You just building on the buzz, helping bake our bread

(Chorus) (x2)
Never had a lotta chicks, but I always been a mack
Never kept a lotta friends, real niggas had my back
When you get the Benjamins, people change the way they act
I ain’t worried ‘bout them, I’m tryna’ count stacks (2x) [I’m bout to count stacks]
When you see A-Roy ain’t a damn thing changed
You never really knew me if you think I’m playing games
I used to be shy, never thought I had the juice
Always had to prove I wasn’t scared up in school
Fine ass yellow bones never really cared
Until I hit seventeen and got the waves in my hair
Voice got deep, Polo jeans had the crease
Pops passed the truck keys, now the honeys wanna stare
Nothing’s changed, it’s the same with this music
We started making moves everybody wants to prove they got skills
This ain’t about skills, this is my life
I don’t really have to rap, I already know I’m nice
But I’m a hip-hop head, I really love the culture
I love my rap music like she was a distant lover
I love the fashion, fresh kicks, fitted hats and
B-boys and b-girls grafitti taggin’

(Chorus x2)

Rappers claimin’ that they ill, sick and retarded
Then my flow is like the pill, shot, antibiotic
I’m the opposite of wanna-bes claimin’ true
How you real when all you do is copy other fools?
I see these clown boys all on the web, making videos lying in the bed
Talking this and that, but that ain’t rap
If you wantin’ some attention, I can understand
Just stop calling it hip-hop, you pansy pants
This jam is for the real, I know you lovin’ me
A-Roy and S-M-G keep it sucka’ free
It’s a luxury to find a rapper such as me
Keep you “breakin’ your neck” like Bussa Bus and D-R-E
I’m tryna’ carry on tradition, listen
These beats and these rhymes, you don’t wanna miss, and
As we making hits, we representin’
Killin’ competition, it’s a cinch man
(Chorus x2)"
On a Mission,Aroy Fogo,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","(Chorus x2)
Hop on a late flight
We having date night
I’m on a mission, girl
I’m hoping we can get it tight (2x)[You know that I can hit it right]
Would that be alright? (2x)[I know just what you like]

I know you prob’ly thinking I’m just that playa type
Scheming for a hole in one, only texting late at night
Yea I’m on the green, chasing dreams without the clubs
Tiger Woods skills- but no cheap thrills I’m dreaming of
I caught you peepin’ me, but you tried to play it off
Thought you was feelin’ me- appears perhaps the vibe was false?
Or maybe I should pay the cost for holding your attention
My swagger caught your eye so now you need some more convincing
No more chillin’ in the cut, I’m stepping your direction
Damn this mall is crowded, top of that your homegirl’s protecting
Cock-blocking- as I slide up in the Louis store
Waiting for the moment, not tryna’ be up on it
Too strong, my rhyme is cunning like a Troubadour
Blown is my mind when you turn I see that booty-
You’re wrong; still I gently tug your hand
Pardon me for disturbing but do you have a man?
(Chorus x2)

I’m shootin’ straight no chaser with my introduction
Not A-Roy the rapper- meet Alan, the future husband
Full of substance, you’ll never find a better brother
No pimpin’, just passion, you’ll never find a better lover
But you don’t understand my kind
Your intuition’s giving a false sign
‘Cause I’m the type of brother that’ll love you long time
And I don’t wanna touch your body yet, I wanna fuck your mind
It sounds raunchy but feel me if you’re clever
The naughty girls’ll never reach your level
‘Cause baby you something special
Why the hell you think that I’m approaching
‘Cause playas get chose by hoes, but queens get chosen
And Royalty is in my lineage, literally
Real name, no gimmicks, this was given to me
No game, real lyrics that I’m spittin’
Real man with a plan and a vision, I hope you listenin’…

(Chorus)

Let me be frank, baby beauty is a blessing
And I wouldn’t be getting at you if you wasn’t exceptional
Respectable, no flash wit ass hanging out
Showing class but still bad, got me thinking ‘bout
What I wanna do to you
Set the mood in my bedroom
Grooving to the soft music in the nude
Hold up…I sound rude, talking so uncouth
But I’m simply just admitting the truth
It’s obvious I’m caught up
Don’t mean to offend you with these images I thought of
Hopefully you’ll see I’m serious
To find out what you feeling too, you really got me curious
So I’m hoping you’re considering
To roll with me, stroll with me to the food court
So we can sit and get some grub, and if your time is short
Then slip me your digits, and I will do the same
But before we make a move, you never told me, what’s your name?"
Give It Back,Aroy Fogo,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","(Verse 1)
Inside my bedroom, waking up from the same dream
Hoping this’ll be the day I see the real thing
I yawn and stretch, reach for my cell phone
Thank God that I’m blessed with health and home
But yo I’m kinda vexed, because I feel alone
So I turn my playlist on and bump my favorite songs
Can’t listen to the radio, it’s garbage
No one seems to feel the hip-hop that goes the hardest
Thinking of a master plan to get my shit out
While I got my grub on, but didn’t pig out
Crease my jeans, brush my teeth, get up and get out
Hit the ground running, never willing to sit out
If I ruled the world and everything in it
I’d put my iPod on blast so the whole world could sing with it
No fairy tales, for this young black male, but oh well
I still got a few stories to share, yea

(Chorus)(x2)
They took rap, but I came to give it right back (2x)[but we came to give it right back]
So nod ya head to this funky fresh dope track
We giving you the shit that’s never ever sounding wack
Giving you the best, so gon’ give it right back
(Verse 2)
Long days and longer nights as the saga of life continues
So many hustles on my plate, and more still on the menu
But yo I gotta get it, long as I keep on livin’
I plan to maximize my time before my time is ending
I coulda’ had a 9-5, a wife and some children
Back in ’05, this was the life that I envisioned
But then I caught a whiff of something different
I had some gifts locked up in my spirit, with a whole lot of interest…
To follow, the other point of the fork in the road
Wanna share with the world all that pours out my soul
A rich and famous lifestyle has never been the goal
But I’m tryna’ have thangs like Mike and Pimp in ‘94
Writin’ raps off the top of my dome
As I stroll from class, cross the street to the other side of the road
Living life like it’s golden, I’m holding
The future in the palm of my hand – I’m mic-controlling

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
The last verse is dedicated to the ladies
Who love hard, but still manage to drive they man crazy
I got a plan baby, no need to worry
I don’t pursue this rap music as an avenue for flirting
Don’t wanna hit the road just so I can do you dirty
In the grand scheme, I really hope to make it work
But you gotta trust I’m giving you the best of me
Even when the distance keeps you longing for the rest of me
We’ve invested too much simply to let it flop
And I’ve invested too much up in this hip-hop
I know you’ve “shed so many tears” – 2pac
And I be feeling “things done changed” – Big Pop
But this ain’t the east/west beef from the 90s
You from the east I’m from the west but we united
One couple under the Lord, over the haters
Fuck that doubtin’ shit girl, this world can’t fade us
(Chorus)	"
NC Blue,Aroy Fogo,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","(Verse 1)
In my city it’s a pity brothers rarely make it out
I’m from a small town where college seldom is the route
Slaving in the oil field, dirty, sun beaming
Or either at Texas Eastman keeping your clothes greasy
I remember how we used to play
Basketball and ride bikes ‘til the end of day
Pops used to say, “Son, I hope you make the grades
‘Cause I’m working hard for you so you can make a way”
But I was daydreaming
Nodding my head to the beat, and every word I’m singing
Enter into another world through my headphones, I was clinging
To the art of expression, with a plan to write my life into a studio session
My homies asked why I quit hooping – I coulda’ shined
I’d tell ‘em how I felt with a 2Pac line
Plus I was losing on the court, but I was loving my rhymes
That’s all I really need to satisfy

(Chorus) (2x)
Sometimes I feel North Carolina Blue
Sittin’ here reminiscing over you
We all tryna’ make it through, but it’s not use
Looking in the rearview, we gotta try something new
(Verse 2)
I’m not from NC, I’m from Longview, Texas
But growing up we loved the ‘Heels or the Blue Devils
Bumpin’ DJ Screw, all bass, no treble
And never knew about the east until Roc-a-fella, or actually Biggie
We kept it southern shit strictly
Didn’t know about much outside the state where we were living
But we were living good, no one was rich but our folks provided what they could
We stacking chips through side hustles off up in the ‘hood
It was a carefree life, at least to me it was
We kept a slow boogie, rarely even thinking of
The next day, then suddenly we in the 12th grade
I’m off to college a lot of my pa’tnas on to getting paid
One way or the other, we all were growing up
And now we grown, I visit home and start to choking up
When I see the ones who never learned to slow it up
I’m wondering if I had stayed, would I have lacked in focus, bruh?

(Chorus)

In this life sometimes I wanna quit
I’m too damn old not to really have shit
That’s how I feel sometimes, I’m hating working all this overtime
I should be starting but I’m riding pine, plus I know I can rhyme
So what’s the use of a masters degree?
And when I pray to God, he never answers simply
It’s tempting me to wanna take a different approach
Then I think of my parents, I get a lump in my throat
How they smile when they see me, my old students stop and greet me
Never could imagine I’d be teaching, but I really seemed to reach ‘em
Least I hope so, then the more I think, I know so
Yea I was mad when the district kept my dough low
But I live a life I can be proud of
Trying to follow the path that’s less traveled
Though at times I may get rattled
Pursuing purpose and my music makes me happy ya’ll
(Chorus)"
More Than Music,Aroy Fogo,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","(Verse 1)
If I say “I am hip hop”- what does that mean?
Am I chasing after the things I see on the screen?
Am I posted on the corner, pushing crack to the fiends?
Or best dressed, swagged out, and the girls think I’m clean?
Old folks say we living a dream, or even worse it’s a curse
When a rapper grabs a pen to write a verse
Hit the web we blog, tweet and steal mp3s
Zombies to the Internet now instead of TV
Society is not in touch with reality
Whether that be the streets, or the university
Or even Christianity – what happened to our quest for truth?
Living so self-centered, it’s affecting the youth
Rappers are preachers from the booth, ain’t no use in lyin’ ‘bout it
You say you ain’t a role model, who gon’ buy yo’ album?
The kids-grown folk don’t care bout yo’ hits
I’m so sick of famous niggas acting careless wit they lips
Ok, what if we say it’s really not a movement
It’s just music, there ain’t nothing to it
It’s an industry we use it, a tool to get money
‘Cause these label heads already think we stupid
So if we get rich and sell out
We ain’t gotta worry bout keeping it real, we can bail out
Nowadays the end justifies the means
‘Cause cash rules everything around me – CREAM!
(Chorus)
When I go to bed at night, I contemplate
Did I do the best I could with what I know today?
And if tomorrow never comes, will my soul be saved?
I gotta grow, I gotta give mo’, the road’s been paved…so
I listen to my hip-hop, criticize my hip-hop
Giving through my hip-hop, living through my hip-hop
Charging up my hip-hop, smarter ‘cause of hip-hop
At times tired of it, but still inspired by hip-hop

(Verse 2)
When I say “I am hip hop” – I know exactly what that means
But defining it is not a simple thing
You hear us say “it’s all good,” it’s cool to be a thug
And you made it once you’re rich from the raps or the drugs
Or both, but I would argue hip hop’s much more
Still it includes all the things that I mentioned before
When I was young Master P taught me all about dope
And Too Short told tales about pimping hoes
But I also heard ‘Pac singing praises to his mama
Tellin’ ladies “keep ya head up” through all the drama
Nas told me young blacks are born to be stars
And Lauryn warned “Karma! Karma! Come back to you hard”
This culture lifted, a stigmatism
That kept the world split by our race divisions
And different religions, we were trapped in the system
But the art of expression freed our voice from its prison
From the poor black ghettos to the Latin barrios
To mainstream America, the Netherlands, Tokyo
The world clearly shows that hip-hop accepts all faces
And bridges gaps like braces
So I smile wide, I represent with no shame
I’m a hip hopper, I wear the clothes I use the slang
I listen to it all, negative and positive
And I ain’t the last one this music still teaching kids
(Chorus)"
Insecurities,Aroy Fogo,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","(Verse 1)
I found my heart in this music, what else could I do
But craft my art and try to use it, ‘cause the red, white and blue
Taught me, that I can have what I want in this country
Setbacks ‘cause I’m black, but I never been hungry
Back track, about my race most people rarely care
Oppression is a thing of the past, it’s in yo’ head
If you claiming that “the man” stopping you from achieving
Can’t say we all equal, but our chances have increased
To be successful, still I feel the pressure from this stress
I got my education but it left my ass in debt
Worse yet, the job market ain’t what you expect
With two degrees I barely see Gs from my check
The way I was told, get a degree and get the cheese
But all I see is people chasing dreams, or plotting schemes
To get their money right, maybe I missed my true calling
Or maybe just infatuated with a lust for balling…

(Break 1)
Yo, I’ve learned that a good life comes from good decision making y’all.  How you spend your time?  Are you selfish, or do you give back, yo…
I’m screaming fuck the world ‘cause that bitch lied to me
I was supposed to make it big, like I hit the lottery
My parents taught me right, my behavior kept it tight
I made good grades in school, went to church, stayed home at night
I’m banking on the golden rule, ‘cause my heart is golden
But my bank account ain’t full, in fact that bitch is frozen
Known to give the best of me to whoever asks
Since a tike I’ve been that dude that you can call when times get bad
Should’ve been more selfish, cared too much what people thought
Myself became an after-thought, and opportunities were lost
My life was set up perfect, to live it just for me
And no one would be hurt by my decision to fly free
Now I see, clearly, 20/20 hindsight
And I’ve prayed sincerely plenty nights
That I could just re-unite, damn, with my only real friend
And make a living through this music with my pen…

(Break 2)
Yo as I grow older, the more time I spend thinking about how big the world is, but I realize everybody wants the same things out of life.  Question is, how do you get ‘em?

(Verse 2)
I’m back to praying and reading; I had stopped for a while
Wondering if hell is real-it’s too hot for me now
‘Cause “hell on earth” is real, I feel you, Hav and P
But I believe in Jesus, so I’m searching for my peace
While still tryna’ get a piece of the American pie
Ain’t no God in our schools, but government’s asking why
All our kids are lost, shit, we lost all our sense
More concerned with big business, chasing dollars and cents
More concerned with building prisons, no rehabilitation
Hate to think where I would be if God wasn’t patient
If Jesus wasn’t gracious, all men need a second chance
And kids deserve the right to feel loved by a parent
Maybe I’m ranting, but I do my part to make a change
Could do more, but I’m still here and I won’t stay the same
2011, A-Roy’ll make his presence felt
I’m terrified to fail, but expect my best until my last breath"
Nicest in the City,Aroy Fogo,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","(Verse 1-Dru B Shinin’)
All the doubters in my past screaming fuck em now
Like the Superman ride a lot of ups and downs
Like that girl in ’07 lost my feet so I can’t even walk
So much on my mind that I can’t even talk
Class is in session and I don’t need no chalk
Need no black board
They ask me what I’m shooting for?
Man I’m trying to bank just like a backboard
Coming through the underground sneaking in through the back door
And y’all be hating, sleeping, call it pillow talk
Y’all get tossed on the ground just like a ‘rillo box
Y’all get thrown in the wind just like some cellaphane
Looking for that fire well holla I got hella flame
Took a loss, homie I ain’t about to pout
Lost some stacks, swear that I’ma get ‘em back
When it comes to countin’, homie don’t ever count me out
Early in the morning I shower and then I’m out the house… early

(Chorus-scratches)
(Verse 2 -A-Roy)
Why the hell am I here?  What the fuck am I doing?
I’m ruined and all of my cash is consumed by the school
I’m a fool to think that this is paying dues
When the fuckin’ rent is due, and due to student loans I’m screwed
So I crack a case of brew, Blue Moon
Lay back in my living room bumpin’ Screw tunes
Drunk by myself, I get a visit from my muse
Grab my pen and pad and write a rhyme about the blues
Every time I rap I’m giving birth from my soul
The words are my baby, the beat becomes her clothes
My lady always worried bout me chasing after hoes
I laugh cuz I only fantasize of goin’ gold
But I don’t need a deal cuz I don’t want my music meddled with
But I want the money got bills that need settling
Whips that need pedaling, outfits need the freshest
‘Cause when I put it on for my city’s how I’m reppin’

(Chorus)

(Verse 3-Dru B Shinin’)
Life ain’t always perfect the purpose is so elusive
Get paper and do this music I know that something missing
Not a Christian no religion but something crossing my mind
Like ashes on Ashe Wednesday there’s something lost I can’t find
No GPS can find it, my album, I just rewind it
To better days when the climate, was beautiful, sun was shining
Studio I was rhyming just rapping my pain
I started grinding, that’s where it changed, sacrifice everything
So I’m praying to God, one day, living my dream
Because, making it’s hard, I enlisted a team
A couple friends, one common goal
No instruments in the trunk, but we on the road
This instrumental it bumps, it sparks your soul
EyeJay did his part now its on my flow
Cold world, you better cover up
Toss alley-oops to the homies so the can fuckin’ dunk
(Chorus)

(Verse 4-A-Roy)
I ain’t finished I replenish never timid and my style is never rigid
Lyrically vivid, I’m rap’s Popeye on his spinach
Flex my tongue with plenty reps over heavy beats
The same tongue had your girl sprung the other week…
And you know what I mean, but back to me
And all these critics who refuse to see I’m gifted – y’all trippin’
This rap shit I’m killin’, feelin’ disrespected
When I genuflect to introspective verses, with or without the curses
The masses longing for those lazy flows it’s crazy yo
But I refuse to keep the bar low I’m climbing
Your braggadocio grows like Pinnochio’s nose you lying
Blowing smoke with all that okey doke rhyming
So if this the last you hear from A dash R-O-Y
I, gave you the realest shit I ever wrote “against all odds”
So keep me on your iPod, keep me in your deck
And keep the faith that hip hop is soon to resurrect in Texas!"

Murder,"Royce da 5'9""","['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Royce Da 5'9""]
I got a phone call
Six in the morning, anonymous, that said
""Yeah nigga, we got him"" and then they hung up
Then I looked down at my iPhone
At the private number saying ""Who the fuck is this"" to the dial tone
I said fuck it, the next second my phone buzzes
My nigga's wife said nigga's just ran up on cousin
What niggas? She said it was some rappers from Ohio
That been out here known for banana bone thugging
Ran up on him and did what then?
She said they stomped him at the club then pandemonium erupted

(Murder)

[Royce Da 5'9""]
Going through my mind, is she telling me shots was fired
Them Ohio nigga's is rock supplying
Heated, stop answering, start spending them niggas calls
Every time he went to see him he went in them rented cars
So it was even harder to find him so they figured
They'd go to the D tomorrow and surprise him
Did they kill him? ""Nah, they only shot a couple times
Heard they was hitting walls."" The nerve of these niggas' balls
Who was he with? ""He was with Tre""
He in the hospital too? ""Nah."" Needless to say, call you back
I called up Tre, Tre answered, I said
Hey man, keep it real fam, why the fuck you still standing?
He said, ""Nickel I'm a killer, not a fighter
So I got up out the way because my weight's a lot lighter
Them niggas was big so I slid but I promise on my kids
We can get them, I know where them niggas is""
Where them niggas at then? I heard what their crew do
Real niggas, if y'all was in my shoes what would you do?
[Woman singing]
You going murder

[Royce Da 5'9""]
Jumped up, pumped up, feeling like Manson Malvo Groucho
My bitch staring out me, I'm out though
I ain't visting cuz in the hospital
Till I got at least one of them nigga's chain in my hand like Alpo
Car headed to where Tre at
Eject the BI to put in T.I., skip to (ASAP)
He off of the freeway in the projects
I hit the exit without blinking to thinking in the process
Tre come running out with a fully on some hot shit
I'm like weapons ain't a thing, killing is the object
What was you doing when they was kicking all on my fam?
He said, ""Nickel, we about to get them niggas, goddamn
Why you got to be so obnoxious?""
What? Just tell me where them niggas at before I take your ass hostage
He said ""Alright. Around six around five
Of them niggas was riding around here in a maroon Crown Vic""
I said alright, pulled out of the lot and made right
You in the car that fit the description, say goodnight
You got to pay the price
Tre said, ""There they go in the alley
Sitting in the car they probably blazing right
And they can't see us cause we behind them""
This ain't the time
""But what if this our only opportunity to find them""
I said you right, pulled into the alley and seen two people in front of them niggas' car taking out garbage
I said wait till these people finish, they innocent
Soon as they go back in their cribs we going to finish it
No sooner than a second after
Tre jumps out of the passenger side blasting
Past them niggas we here to kill, hitting them innocent bystanders
Tearing their trash up
Our enemies jumped out of their car waving badges
They all shooting at me, nobody blazing at him
This ain't adding up
Car in reverse, now I'm mashing, leaving Tre behind
Even though it's some questions that I got to ask him
[Woman singing]
Murder

[Royce Da 5'9""]
Burning rubber away from there in a bullet riddled car
Trying to piece this shit together, hitting the boulevard
If them niggas is the police, what the fuck is Tre?
He ain't dead or in jail by now then he the other way
Snitch or pig, I got to talk to my cousin
That nigga setting me up then I'm a lift his lid
That nigga know how hostile my reactions
I call and try to find out what hospital he at then
Every nigga pickup just laugh when I ask
Have you heard about cuz getting smashed maybe I'm the ass then
Head hurting like a motherfucker, looking for a gas station
Now a nigga need a fucking aspirin
I hear a familiar ringtone from my phone
It's my bitch texting me telling me don't come home
I'm thinking damn should I text back, why me
My phone starts ringing it's Tre on the ID
He said, ""Them niggas tried to get me but I slid""
He want to tell me in person, meet me at my crib
I said nigga please
I threw the phone out the window rolled over it crushed it into a million pieces
I hit the blinker quick then hit the highway
If I'm a be a target y'all know I'm a do it my way
After I rolled for a few hours I'd say
I was tired after I got out of the tri-state
Can't help but feel like another lame exposed

I make your bitch crew shit stools
I put a pistol in your mouth to full, then I feed you to the pit bulls
Don't even talk about guns
The only nine you got is a five dollar bill and four one's
So I don't give a fuck what none of y'all niggas say
‘Cause anything that can't penetrate ricochet's
Rhyming with me on a record?
You might as well have died and went to Hell instead of Heaven
‘Cause my rhyme weapon is like a medieval torture method
Your four limbs tied to four horses all pulling in different directions
In this profession, I get busy without a question
Seeing me is like seeing a vampire's reflection
Fast and slow flows connect like electrodes
I make cassette tape decks blow when I'm in wreck mode
Explode, leaving areas abandoned
With more radiation behind than spots UFOs landed in

Report back to me before the briefing, at ease!
Are you a Navy SEAL?

Then say it like you mean it!
Tell them who Free from the Navy Seal team is!

Free be the one rocking shit, special operatives
Specializing in weapons diagnostics
My survival tactics be drastic like Rambo
I'm strangling niggas with my bow and arrow elastic
Whoever said you couldn't be 5 feet and thoroughbred
Never witnessed the cerebral cortex in my head
How many gigabytes does your hard drive hold?
Or does your hard drive fold once the signal hits the node?
Beyond mission control, the theory behind your thought
Marie Antoinette behead me, I still rock
While you choking, suffocating off your own testosterone
I'm known for breaking levels down to the values unknown
A specimen with extraterrestrial estrogen
Kick your intestines in, sell your testicles to Mexicans
I bring the force like a nutcracker
Annihilate rhyme hackers, Navy Seal linebacker
The last Oedipus remains unclaimed
So if you buck against Free, you better tattoo your name
On your teeth
I disintegrate those that oppose
Disintegrate hoes with they assholes in they nose
I suppose you wanna run your mouth like castanet
I put bitch niggas to rest in a bitch bassinet

I'm the meanest motherfucker on this whole Navy Seal team
And I can kill anything if it bleeds or breathes
Calling all bitch-ass niggas and bitch-ass bitches
I got a Howitzer bigger than any 4/5th is
Rapping is a raw business
But as an individual I'm as different as anybody's fingerprint is
If boring is the norm, I'm the antonym
Put me in the same category you would put Marilyn Manson in
Bugging like a satanic evangelist
Jogging butt-naked down Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles
Every MC in your crew will get ruined or wounded
You talk the bullshit and you too scared to do shit
I'm the type of nigga that will prove it, produce shit
Spent so much time in the studio I had to move in
A soldier who practices West Indian Obeah
I can drink the poison from a king cobra
‘Cause long after y'all are dead and gone
I'll survive the nuclear holocaust like a roach arthropod

Yo, niggas is phony, fronting like they Master of Ceremonies
None of you suckers are even remotely close to me
To be nice, I sacrifice things like no sleep

Creating concepts so deep niggas quote me
They rewind then interpret my rhymes to they homies
I've advanced beyond your flows eons ago
It's inevitable in '98 I'ma blow
Ever since '84, I've been in it to win it
But see back then we used to battle by spinnin' on the cement
You can't even absorb the rhymes I record
Or resolve the deep laws of the physics involved

From the galaxy of Andromeda

Who the best is, the question will go unanswered

Murdering niggas with lyrics manufactured within my DNA's double-helix

Mud is part of being thug, I guess it's advance, we from the street

No Romance,Wooh da Kid,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
Like a car with no brakes man I can't stop
Making hits non-stop I'm rolling off a (yop?)
A lot of cuts in my wrist from these damn diamonds
All because my flow ( there?) like I been rhyming
They say who the fuck is next
I say Wooh Da Kid and Lex
No romancing baby girl yeah its time to have sex
They say who the fuck is next
I say Wooh Da kid and Lex
No romancing baby girl cuz its time to have sex

[Verse 1]
No slow dancing, no romancing when I'm in the club
44 on my side I'm a fucking thug
(This lil' nigga hating saying I'mma fucking scrub)
He throwing salt in the game so get a slug
I'm just tryna get some bitches chill and smoke a blunt
With my niggas throwing money cuz they love to flaunt
Brick Squad niggas built for the bullshit
Bully niggas getting beat with a full clip
Alot of bad bitches tryna be ya actress
The next scene is you laying on my mattress
Kareem Stephan status, she got that super head
No slow dance, romance, we get to the head
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Call me Wooh Billy Blanks I'm on hydro
I work ya girl out but I ain't talking Tae Bo
Face down ass up beat it from the back
She a freak so I slid a finger down the crack
Yes yes Wooh Da Kid the best
Lex a picky nigga, so he ain't hit it next
Fuck it I'mma throw this sheep to the wolves
Plus she down for it and she like her hair pulled
A-and she know the game, A-and how it goes
Yeh she smashed the homies, B-but she ain't a ho
She with the program, no romance
Keep ya hands down baby you have no chance

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Mixtape working, album work done
Wooh and Lex is like night and day
More like moon and sun
And together we gon' make the game go round and round
Because they love my flow and they love lil homie's sounds
Beat going hard, man I swear to god
A bunch of young niggas moving like a fucking mob
MGM niggas, straight cut-throat
Bring it in and back it up by the truck load
Dirt game killers, fetty game next
Lex Luger track so you know I had to flex
So Icey Boy for life we don't romance
And it's alot of dead guys screaming in my pants

Stereo Sun,Lupe Fiasco,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook - Eric Turner]
It's the way of the stage
It's like a stereo sun
It's the way I build up, the business really gets done
It's like a stereo sun

[Verse 1 - Lupe Fiasco]
I hear it: the spirit, and I don't fear it
Matter 'fact, I steer it
Right in the heart of the hardships, I don't veer it
And this car is just a metaphor for my experience
No registration or insurance, just a license to ill
God's hands on the wheel, and my pedal's to the ceilin', peelin'
Speeding like 24 frames through the lights
With the traffic cameras filmin, brights
So I could see the brilliance of this life I've been given
Livin' to start a revolution every minute
Driven to win it, no breaks, no pittin'
Pole position ya soul, keep ya windows tinted
So we can see out it, but they can't see in it
So this here's ours, and them theirs rented
Cars moving at top gear, Jeremy Clarkson
I feel like this my first track and I ain't even start nothin, yessir!
[Hook - Eric Turner]

[Verse 2 - Lupe Fiasco]
The sky's on fire, the storm is almost near us
But that's when I'm the clearest, when things are the severest
I'll be here for its arrival and for its disappearance
Broadcasting live and clear, even with the interference
See this is what it sounds like when life becomes lyric
The best thing ever, you should really come and hear it
But if you can't, cool. We'll be coming to your nearest, soon
Shining like two suns, it's better than two thumbs
The whole plot's to get you
To stop from doing what you do, to do better than you've done
Then we'll stare down the feds in the room
Who dares not to scare? Hear it, boom!
Unaffected by your werewolves, ghosts and your 'boom'
The tour through the tombs don't do nothing to 'em, never!
I turn the pressure into treasure
My problem's in the present and my presence is forever
Yes, sir!

Yo Doc, what up my nigga?
Snoop Dogg, this is what it is mane
This record is so motherfuckin' gangsta man
I think it's time for me and you to just, tone it down a bit
Come on

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Imagine it never happened
Imagine no rappin'
Imagine niggas trapped imagining having action
Imagine how these niggas could be actin' if we never got this shit crackin'
Imagine life's so hard
You can't imagine, it's like livin' in the City of God, you feel me?
Imagine life on the yard
Or tryna get that dollar on some shitty ass job
Imagine Biggie with his son
Imagine Pac gettin' called ""Pop"" by one
Imagine a mother struggling
Dealing with a system that don't give a fuck about who shot her son, hm
Imagine life where you can't win
When you get out of the ghetto and go right to the pen
When you get out to the pen, you go right to the gin
So if you get back to the streets, you go right back in, hm
Imagine Russell still struggling
No Def Jam, just another nigga hustlin'
And ain't no rocks on them fellas
Just rocks on them fellas, just tryna keep it bubblin'
Imagine niggas just stuck
From the East to the West Coast, everybody fucked up
I can't imagine no less
But it don't take imagination to know niggas been blessed with hip-hop

With your ears, clear your mind, can you imagine?
Paint a picture in the sky, can you imagine? (Oh, heeee)
Lord have mercy, I've been dreamin' all my life

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Can you imagine being lit up by some hot shells?
Imagine being tossed around and put in jail
Imagine life when you can't get from under
Imagine niggas at ya when you done fo'
Remember how they asked you, ""What you run for?"" and treat ya like a bitch
When they kick you in your dick and take your shit
Reactin' like they hate to see you gung-ho
But just imagine if the rabbit got the gun though, but you already know
Imagine niggas in the LBC
Felt just like Snoop Dogg and D-R-E
And felt just like them niggas in the 2-1-3
Then imagine that's what's coming when you fuckin' with me
Imagine you was up on top of this shit
Imagine if the bitches could stay off this dick
I mean, imagine we said, ""Fuck this shit""
Imagine if my niggas got together and tore up this bitch, yeah
You can't imagine growing up in jail dumb
Happy just to be alive, watching all your people run
Would you imagine growing up to sell you
Fifty million records worldwide or fuckin' off somebody's son?
Imagine if these niggas never saw a color
Would it be peaceful in them streets where niggas kill each other?
All a drunk fool get is pissed-on balls
Keep fuckin' off my niggas, they gone murder us all
Imagine that

You Had Me You Lost Me,Eve,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus]
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back, huh
You fucked around and played around
And now you're feeling sad
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back, huh
You fucked around and played around
And now you're feeling sad

[Verse 1]
Uh, how should I start it off?
You must have thought me soft
Like it was all good to move on and cross me off
We never shared secrets, we wasn't fuckin' raw
Helped you when you were down and now you got the fuckin' gawl
We used to be so tight, we was each others life
You was my husband and no doubt I was your fuckin' wife
Did anythin' you ever asked of Eve
You turned out to be a devil nigga, I couldn't believe
Sneakin' numbers out my phone, callin' bitches on the cell
What the hell? Clunky bitches one on the scale
I'm like a dime over line, you can't calculate my status
And you fuckin' with these bitches like my ass wasn't the fattest
Like I didn't dress the baddest any time we surface
Must have been insecure, niggas made you nervous
And I guess it was your purpose to lock me in
But you fucked up, your lucks out but then again

You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back, huh
You fucked around and played around
And now you're feeling sad
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back, huh
You fucked around and played around
And now you're feeling sad

[Verse 2]
Used to let shit slide, caught a couple lies
I chilled for real, I mean I called a couple guys
Knew when you was fuckin' up, I saw it in your eyes
Then I guess it was my fault 'cause I put up the disguise
In public, we was happy, in home, we'd be scrappin'
Later we'd be naked, jokin', smokin' and laughin'
Makin' up to break up, I thought that shit was love
But it wasn't and I learned the hard way soakin' in suds
Cryin' all depressed, not again, you'll never catch me
Wishin' on a star for some nigga to come bless me
I tried to save it, all you ever did was stress me
Pushin' all my buttons, why the fuck must you stress me?
Nigga, get a life, go on and find a wife
Get the fuck out my face 'fore I go and find a knife
And you still callin' my phone tryna act polite, huh
Askin' me for favors now you know that shit ain't right but
[Chorus]
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back, huh
You fucked around and played around
And now you're feeling sad
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back, huh
You fucked around and played around
And now you're feeling sad, uh, huh

[Verse 3]
Uh-oh, you see me comin', don't you?
Look at you runnin', won't you?
Oh, you gon' sit there and see me like I want to approach you
Now it's payback, I'm talkin' way back
To bitches callin' hangin' up, you ain't no way to save that
To unanswered questions, to home in the A.M
To you out clubbin', forcin' me to stay in
Remember, okay then, it's over, no playin'
I said it before, I'm about to do it, fuck what you sayin'
Too late for apologies, go puff on a pile of weed
Think about this good bitch that's leavin' and don't follow me
Movin' on, shut you down, now you wanna regret
You could fuck all day, but it would never feel like my sex
Played yourself tried to show I cared, you ain't cared
When I needed you the most, nigga, you wasn't there
And the game is the same; comes around, goes around
Now hate me forever while the chorus goes around, huh
[Chorus]
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back, huh (I want you back)
You fucked around and played around
And now you're feeling sad
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back, huh (I want you back)
You fucked around and played around
And now you're feeling sad
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back, huh (I want you back)
You fucked around and played around
And now you're feeling sad
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back, huh (I want you back)

Reagan Era,Curren$y,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Currensy Reagan Era Lyrics

Can't play the backfield no more
I just don't...belong...oh

Member of a fly society
Styles I got several varieties
As a child this guy memorized
Scarface in its... Motherfucka you knoww

For all of the bitches I
Might take home
Spray my shirt down
Dolce & Gabbana cologne
Comin down like my homeboys
From Houston
Got my celly on silent
I'm ignorin my phone
Diamonds, Diamonds on my band
Cause that's right where they belong
Like a trumpet or some symbols
Or a set of trombones
Your bitch chose to roam
In a Spitta zone
Now your drunk watchin E.T
Wishing she phone home
But deep in your heart
You know what she wants
Cause I'm a different type of nigga
And that's just what she wants
Groundbreaking, Dr. Jay's first dunk
Stealing bases Willy Mays I'm gone
Can't play the backfield no more
I just don't think that's where I belong
I do better on my own
Swag crucial, Honestly
It gotta be cause niggas that
You listenin to probably
Stole his style from me
Bitter? neva, I come up with
Something betta, have to catch
An elevator all the way up to my level
Playin Metal Gear Solid on the PlayStation 3 for six hours
My girl in the bedroom sleep but I'm not tired
I would call over
A couple of my pilots
But them niggas live, they dont
Know how to be quiet
Shorty gonna wake up and come up
In here wildin, hollerin like Keisha did
Tommy, If you ain't see Belly
You dont nothin about it
What else can you tell me
But my flow so polished
Cook it up a notch with the rhymin
Trynna bury spitta in the grave
At the bottom, climed up out it
Knock you in the same hole
Stand on top it
Consistent flow, Currensy the hot-spitta
So on topic
Other niggas lost they need to see
The golden compass
Brother I'm a boss like Ross
Spitta nigga hot like sauce
At the And One game breakin
Motherfuckas off
I had a good job I thought
But I couldn't get along with the
People in charge I grab my timecard
Punched out, I'm off
Soft-spoken but a nigga not soft
Not at all real niggas stand tall
For something
Make sure I don't fall for nothing
In this game, it's pain for
The up and coming
No handouts cause
Niggas don't owe you nothing
Gotta do it for dolo
Flashbacks to the conversation
Took place between Face and Manolo
The world chico and everything in it
I said it, I meant it
I get it, I spend it
Comfortable living till a motherfucker finished
If I'm in it then you know it's not tinted
If I'm in it know it got a nice engine
You could be a mile away
And still hear it
That's classic american muscle
Store my bitches numbers in a ipod shuffle
I call her over to cut her
You call her over to cuddle
Knock youself out boy
You can't knock my hustle
I'm fresh, dressed like a million bucks
Labels offering checks
For a million bucks
Ask Roddie if he thought
A million was enough
He said yes cause he can
Hit the streets and triple it up
I'm a member of a fly society
Styles I got several varieties
As a child, this guy memorized
Scarface in it's entirety
'80s drug era inspired me
That's why I dress how I dress
Walk how I walk
That's why I rep what I rep
Talk how I talk
Two rope chains both of them gold
I got a swagga like I just came home woah
I'm a member of a fly society
Styles I got several varieties
As childless God memorizin
Scarface in it's entirety
'80s drug era inspired me
That's why I dress how I dress
Walk how I walk
That's why I rep what I rep
Talk how I talk
Two rope chains both of them gold
I got a swagga like I just came home woah
Where haven't we been yet (Where haven't we been yet)

You see them airplanes..."

Why You Gotta Zodiac Like That,brandUn DeShay,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think we should force it
Getting all bent out of shape like we some contortion-ist
Miss, if we was married, I'd say divorce it
You looking dynamite, but you blew this out of proportion
I took a lot of ish, I think I had my fair portion
So I had to let my baby go, pro-abortion
I hate I had to let my baby go from my forceps
But I ain't one for holding on, I just got a poor grip
Tsk-tsk, wish that we could take it back like TiVo
This whole thing done gone out control with no remote
I'm shooting for her heart, for her heart, no reload
I'm shooting for her heart, for her heart, whoa, recoil
It's time to face the facts, pay attention, no decoy
This heart is full of cracks, full of cracks, no D-Boy
It was a good run while it lasted
I guess our love just had asthma

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
We going harder and harder, higher and higher
Every dream is assembly required
Been watching and waiting for my constellation
Show me a sign, a sign in the sky
We going harder and harder, higher and higher
Every dream is assembly required
Been watching and waiting for my constellation
Show me a sign, a sign in the sky

In search of... love, and I found it
Electric personality, thank God that I'm grounded
And nah, we ain't grounded, we just enjoy the great indoors
We could be kicking it in the car and we'd never get bored
Our conversation requires no concentration
Don't gotta look in the sky to see my constellation
'Cause you're a star in my eyes, the one that I've been waiting for
The reason why none of my past relations, worked
I can't afford to splurge, but how 'bout we spend the night out?
If you don't sleep, I don't sleep, we'll be some night owls
Let's ride out and kick it on Broadway like my posse
And spend the night watching the stars like paparazzi
I'm far from Jewish, but how could I not see
Potential that we share? More love than a Care Bear Stare
They're just weird if they don't understand this love
So in love like hands in gloves
(That's pretty often, pretty awesome)

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
We going harder and harder, higher and higher
Every dream is assembly required

The Warning,GodZZZilla,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","It's the warning get back, get fly
Buckle your seat belt or fucking die I ain't gonna cry
I'm just gonna take a seat, smoke a cigarette while you suck my dick
Cold sweat running down your face listen to the base pumping
Just embrace my rhymes and come out of your fucking hiding place
I'm flyer than the Ben-hur chariot race
I'm like Bill Gates just beat that antitrust case
This is a virtual place, hyperreal world imaginary case for my mental space
Lace up your cleats pick up them sticks
It's the warning I go harder than Louis C.K. and a bag of dicks
Make the list, make the money, oh you think this is funny? go watch Jeff Dunham act like a fucking monkey
I'm the best thing on the web ""what up gay fish"" my rhymes ain't serious
But you still actin' all delirious
Like a Hitchcock thriller my swagger so mysterious
My swagger like the Scarlet letter
Godzzzilla get wetter, Godzzzilla get better than all the rappers in it for the cheddar
Who act like the fucking settlers, shooting Buffalo but I ain't no T.O.,
Tony Romo slower than slo-mo it's a no show
Do not pass go, don't collect your money
Sonny, you acting like a Bono
Got so much honey Winnie the Pooh tried to pick me up after school
But I said hell no bitch go...
Configure the system, it's a Windows 7 party
And we all drinking Bacardi with a side of club sauce calamari
I live on fuck mountain
My piss so smooth it flows like a fountain
Out of your body I know all about your schemes
Call me Sigmund Freud I'll psychoanalyze your dreams
Call me a bitch that's just fucking mean
See in in your eyes, slicin' it up like Dali in his prime
When he climbed up, found out, King Kong can't take me in a bout
Super Mario fo sho ya'll bitches know the warning coming at you
And it will attract who?, fuck if I knew, fuck it I'mma split
Insurance rates high but my moneys on the low
How is it up there never been on a plane how am I supposed to know?
Airbags been deployed you gayer than Llyod
Don't ask don't tell should be fucking null and void
Cuz I'm overjoyed, stronger than a steroid
Stronger than all those other rappers rhymes you been destroyed, please
It's the warning now you unemployed
Wait in line fo your welfare check
So poor you still use a motherfucking tape deck
Living in a basment wathing Star Trek
I'm a Religious Studies scholar all that other shit's just fodder
Gave birth to this game like I was its father, man
Sun burning up but you know I'm hotter man
It's the warning so don't even fucking bother man"
The Storm,J. Cole,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
My man, Shawn, from around the way, son, been down from day one
Never been known for mistakes but was bound to make one
Her name was Nina, see he was all about the cash flow
Til she came and had this man pussy whipped to the max yo
A true dime piece describin her, brown eyes
Caramel skin, thick thighs, goes beyond speech
But besides looks her mind's lost
Known for kickin cats to the curb, leaving their hearts on the sidewalk
Shawn was one of them, she said she was lovin him
But only fucked him because he had some funds comin in
He couldn't see it though
She was cheating and he didn't even know
He even bought a crib with this schemin ho
In the ride, mad jewels, mad clothes, mad shoes
And to show his commitment he got her name tattooed
I gotta hand it to her, she had the stuff planned out
But watch what happened when her luck ran out

[Hook]
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
You up now but you'll get yours
Some how
Some day
In some way, shape, or form
Revenge is coming
No way to escape the storm

[Verse 2]
Time passes, Shawn is thinking about wedding rings
But he knows the signs of cheating and doesn't wanna believe them
He disregards them, goes out for diamond ring shopping
Now the big question is when is he gonna pop it
Waiting for the right time
Meanwhile Nina's the same ho
Like a snare drum but bangs way more
For Shawn up to this point shit's going well
Til one day his homeboy hit him on his cell, like
""Yo son you won't believe this, I just seen your chick."" (""Where?"")
""In the mall with this cat, he was palming her ass
I swear to God son. Need me to run up on him and drop him?""
""Nah, chill I got this, I'll hit you back if it's poppin""
He hung up, I called Nina, ""Where you at? What you doing?""
""At the mall with some friends buying new Timbs.""
Somethin sounded funny
She was lying for sure
But Shawn had a little plot of his own
Check it

[Hook x2]
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
You up now but you'll get yours
Some how
Some day
In some way, shape, or form
Revenge is coming
No way to escape the storm
[Verse 3]
I missed you (Aw)
Missed you so bad I followed you (What, where?)
Followed you all the way to your boyfriend's rendevouz (What?)
Yeah bitch you caught now
So don't even try to give me that shit you thought how it wasn't you who I saw now (No it wasn't)
You trifling ho, I gave my whole life to you yo
And now you basically shove a knife in my throat (It's not like that)
But it's alright though, the same cat you was fucking with then
Is currently laying dead in the trunk of my Benz (Oh God)
Yeah get to crying, in a minute you'll be there beside him
And by the time the cops find you I'll be in the islands (No, I'm sorry)
Visualizin what could have been between me and you
It was just just a dream, you fucked up the thing between us two
So now it's speak your peace before you leave this earth bitch (We can work this out)
I hope that shit was worth it
And now I pray that God is merciless
With this said, goodbye to the reason I lived this life (Shawn)
Pointed the gat to her mouth, long kiss goodnight (No)

Immortal,Apathy,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Queen “Princes of the Universe”]
I am immortal, I have inside me blood of kings
I have no rival, no man can be my equal

[Verse 1: Apathy]
I spit, to make the mic like a flammable torch
""It's understandable"" my mind is a mechanical force
And I'm a cannibal my mandible is chewin' ya corpse
""I'm tyrannical, a vandal of intangible sorts
Not a mineral a mammal or an animal, I'm
Metaphysical, the syllables in critical rhymes
Flows blowin' off ya limbs like invisible mines
Been invincible with rhymes since the biblical times
A warlord with a sword from the Mongol Horde
Speak the tongue of the lord, to bless my vocal chords
They tried to resurrect Hip Hop but faith is gone
So I'll take it over by force like Genghis Khan
If you say it ain't raw, you better pray to Allah
'Cause I got an arrow that'll travel straight through the jaw
Got breath control, flow like a ship with a sail
Divine when I spit like if I sipped from the grail
'Cause I'm immortal
[Hook]
{""I am immortal, I have inside me blood of kings
I have no rival, no man can be my equal""} IMMORTAL
{""I am immortal, I have inside me blood of kings
I have no rival, no man can be my equal""} IMMORTAL

[Verse 2: Apathy]
I'm underground like communities of homeless bums
Sleepin' by the third rail where the A Train runs
My brain strains to lift freight trains from off the ground
When I'm walkin' around, I'm the talk of the town
Cuz I harness mental powers scientists don't understand
So I'm on the low hiding from the average man
In a bad savage land I'm rockin' a gas mask
With black gats attached to snaps on back packs
To easily grip, when frequency blips
Alert me to intruders in the sewers where I secretly sit
Fine tunin' my rhymes until I got the hottest style
Then wrestle the mics from mutated crocodiles
That slipped into the pipes sometime in '88
Now they taste nuclear waste that makes 'em radiate
I'm subterranean and melt the steel titanium
With powers of uranium coming out of my cranium, immortal

[Hook]
{""I am immortal, I have inside me blood of kings
I have no rival, no man can be my equal""} IMMORTAL
{""I am immortal, I have inside me blood of kings
I have no rival, no man can be my equal""} IMMORTAL
[Verse 3: Apathy]
I'll walk through Hell till it freezes
If Reverend Run sells his Adidas
I stomp cats and leave a path of skeletal pieces
Y'all are washed up like shellfish on beaches
I'm a genius that's developed speeches deeper than telekinesis
My immortality's recorded on record
Never distorted, contorted it into 240 seconds
You pressed ya single up but nobody will hear you
Like that Puerto Rican flag CD hangin' off ya rear view
Get ready to rumble, let's get busy
I'll spin the axis backwards, make your planet dizzy
Decapitatin' catchin' the quickening when I'm spittin
I be wetting motherfuckers like a christening and cripplin'
Ya clique, quick with equipment equipped like bloods blast crips
My hammer never clicks, pack back up clips
Slaughter all the competition when ripping a mortal man
And cut ya heads off like only an immortal can

[Hook]

One Two is immortal, I'll love forever
""Forever, forever ever, forever ever?""
Celph Titled is immortal, he'll live forever

Open Mic is immortal, he'll live forever

Til We Die,Blu,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Laugh now, cry never
Never mind, nice guys finish fine, I guess
Forever fly
Used to be fresh but now I'm wise
Guy's, try to imply
Like I should optimize on lies and cries
I find it harder now to author nouns and sounds
It's like couldn't believe I was really bout to father a child
*When all of this foul
*World girls are brought up in now
All the options
Cloggin and crowdin'
Little Knoggins'
With products instead a knowledge
Unbalanced
And it bothers nobody cause she fine as hell
So she whine's/wine's
And dines
And tells, more lies
Trynna find herself
Fell on ma knees today to find myself
And it helps when It ain't no one around to tell the truth to
When I'm not have the guy/God I use to be
Use too
Who be?
Used to say
You the truth too
Now I'm just Truthful
Truthfully it hurts
Usually worse
Used to be worse
Running from comfort
Cause I wouldn't conform, or convert
Now I just converse
About how much love hurts
And how good God is
And how much I want more for ma kids
Cause life is not fair
But it does not stop there
Do what you got til you drop
But don't trip, my dear
It's God's here
Right here
[Verse 2]
Whatever you be on is you nigga
Remember, whatever I be on the good God got me on
I try to lone through the winter
Jottin' home in poems
Tryna remember the warmth when the storms pass
Blue skies
Sunshine ma minds forecast
Not like I was born last week
Complete ma format
My perspective gets deep
My lessons have been collectin' like Blessings
The exchange rate is beautiful too
Proving that truth can override anything but love
So God Bless you
A timeless
Life a
Stressin' this fight with lust
I try to put my life love up above you but
God
Mom
Music
Movies
Movin' the world with a duty to truly be something worthy of
Lavish ass pad's
With cars
And all types a devices
Must be nice if happiness is priceless
Right
Price my life
And y'all can have the Range bright lights and fame
For some change, give an exchange if your souls intact
And it's hard to beat that with a bat
Most cats get wit this
It's '08 jack
I stick wit that
Boom bap mind state
'96 mind flip, get money
Other than that
We praise God
Sometimes I play y'all
Never did play cards or
Video games
I was eight tryna navigate principle aim
Multiplyin' ma visual game
By ma spiritual gain
Divided truth by pain
Still steerin' the plane
Like the pilots do it
Sun shine
And in the sky is Blu
So high
Wave hi we just ridin' through
No titles, No idols, No pride
No time to prove to you why we fly we just do US
And we trust that you do you
That's what we was brought up to do"
My Heart is Dancing Mad Ode to Hannah,Snibunny,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Lyrics]

Take a step back and try to visualize
Take a look at the world, view it through my eyes
See the way I prioritize
You're number one, you're not just a door prize
You're the chest where my heart lies
It's Ridicul-iss
How it's come to this
All I ever do is fantasize of the next kiss
Stuck on you you're a nexus
Where I can channel my thoughts
I couldn't change the channel even if I wanted it off
Cause you're the board to my chalk
I'm gonna be all over you; you're the fries and I'm salt
Siege me to my knees, you bring my heart to a halt
Yet passion still runs through my veins
Complete devoidance of pain
The perfect escape from a life full of bane
Feel like a king, a lion hart with this mane
My inner beast is unleashed the squelching thoughts in my brain
It's like seduction of force
That energy that you course
I'm mesmerized by your touch
There's no such thing as too much
As I have your back in my clutch
I pull you into my chest
The passion ignites and amplifies with each breath
Of air that flows from your lips
Drives me to touching and squeezing clenching my hands on your hips
And slowly lose my mind as it rips
Out of my skull and it strips
Me of my morals and my will and restraint
Lose my focus, see your face in every mental picture I paint
Out the stained-glass window now goes little Shaney the Saint
It's like the fruit of temptation
A fruit sought after by nations
Inside and out you take me over; Invasion
It's so apt to say Hannibal cause it's you that I'm craving
Nothing less than amazing
I take a look in your eyes and it's in to the stars that I'm gazing
All the way to Mars that you're raising
The bar of love when you're raging
And in and out I keep phasing
Out of my mind to your taste
There's not a second I'd waste
To touch my lips to your face
Set one hand to your waist
The other's pulling my head out of space
Marinating my body in your eloquent grace
You bite my lip 'til it's purple
Confusing pleasure with hurtful
Wanting your nails in my back
Piercing my skin like a tack
Overwhelmed with desire
Feels like my bodies on fire
Endorphins are soaring
When I'm feeling so soar and
I'm boring
My hand in your hair I'm adoring
Every inch every pore and
I'm pouring
My heart to You, Hannah Lauren
It's foreign
The way I feel for you
Head over heels for you
I get thrills from you
The chills from you
So much I spill from quills for you
I'd cut SO many deals for you
And I'll just lay in the cut
With butterflies in my gut
Your kiss is richer than Tut
Uncommon
And calming
As common
Ritalin
Lips knock my out like phenegran
I surge with adrenaline
I quiver like I'm tectonic
You plague my thoughts like bubonic
The only cure, your kiss is the tonic
And I wanna jump right on it
Cause I'm more hooked on you than kids are hooked on phonics
I'll switch it up to mnemonics
She's HLF; Hot luscious freak
I'm TSA, torn sadistic ambient geek
She makes my BP peak
You got me all gassed up with my face pressed to your cheek
You're beautiful
From your hair to your cuticles
Ya lips to your hips
And your neck to your knees
I'm in love with you
Just wish you could fall for me"

Spot me everywhere with the 8 like Kate Goslin
Niggas think they sit at the top, they just posturing
Now they hide their head like an ostrich
Optimus Prime and that gull wing feeling like I transform
Niggas still hands on, whip it like a sandstorm
Had the audacity to sell it in a damn poem
Get you higher Angelo, the author of this anthems
Your punch lines are mere jabs, they see through
Like the clear glass on that coupe I steer past
Money on my mind like my pillow is a vault
You niggas is soft so on that pillow’s where you talk
Can’t find it in them d-list actresses on mattresses
Your real chance to loving you bachelors, I laugh at them

Hey, I got a
Cup of Henny, joint of good
Not gettin' any sleep, even though I should
Catch a early flight, hit another city
For a concert full of fans who be fuckin' with me
Countin' hundreds, fifties, groupie hoes
That all love to show me how they drop they booties low
Two at once, that's a ménage à trois
Watch their bras come off, have me sayin', ""La-di-da""
Rock 'n' roll, livin' life
Gettin' head, get it twice
It feels like I've been drunk for the eleventh night
Don't know how I'm gonna wake up in time to catch this flight
All these bitches in the front row tryna dress alike
They do a lot of barkin', but they never bite
They lookin' at me like, ""I'm gonna have some sex tonight""
And yes, I might if it's alright, 'cause...

Anyway you name it, I'm entertainment
I make it, I'll admit, I'm kinda famous
My life is like a vacation
'Cause day out and day in, these hotels, Days Inns
Travel navigation, I switch up my location
Days goin' without shavin', the road life's a bitch
But fuck it, this the good life, so for no life, I'd switch
Got my money comin' faster than these women I get into
Can't tell me how to live my life, chill, fool, I been cool
I'm the type of dude, pretty cool, kinda nice, not rude

Get front row then show their boobs
Party every night, they worry that I blow the fuse

Counterfeit styles on some half off shit
Same cats wanna give my dap talk shit
Walk around the bar like they bought false tits (oh on)

Arabs and robbers I chop off wrists
Hip Hop fanatics better run and call KRiS
If I see you on stage I'm a run and call- BLITZ!

I'll play and play and play and play some more
As no on ever played the drums before
At times I catch vibe and my rhymes so sick
Feeling like I could rip NAS like Chubb Rock did

Killin' 'em, because they only push pens to minimum
Please I give them what they've never seen
My style has wings more than syllables

Super hand my minds a Hulk 10 years

Scarface, bitch: Cocaine by the pie
Got them hoes sniffing like them hoes 'bout to cry
Ms. MySpace, don't blow my high
I download hard dick to your hard drive
Then, she got on her knees; that's when we locked eyes
She caught it like it was a routine pop fly
I'm dopeboy fresh: New jeans, new everything
Them bitches want me like a wedding ring
I told her that I'm married to the money, committed to the cash
All I see is pussy, titties, and a ass

Call me ""Weezy F.,"" bitch, I'm straight from the street
The dope game is sour, and the dope is sweet
I live in the towers, got a scope on the heat
Hit you from a hunnid feet—we don't even have to meet
Your bitch love me—we don't even have to meet
But if I run into her, believe me, I will— hold on
Your bitch love me—we don't even have to meet
But if I run into her, believe me, I will do her
And if that bitch is crazy, believe me, I will sue her
Got some hungry-ass lawyers that will eat her up and chew her
I don't know how you love her; I wish I never knew her
She only gave me brain—she was just another tutor
She blew my whole band—I was just another tuba
Now get off my dick, and get lost in Aruba
It's money over bitches, Cash Money over bitches
Young Money over bitches, get money from them bitches—I do!

Excite-ting, enlight-ning, invite-ing
I'm writing shit that I feel
Raps are black steel in the hour of commotion
The motion of Com is like that of a ocean
Devotion 'cause I'm the Earth, Wind, and Fire of hip-hop
By Rakim and Short, I've been inspired
My shit knocks environ...ments of cats with seventeen's
Tint, time is money, the mind is funny, how it's spent on getting it
I'm sitting with descendants of Abraham
Who say the jam is ""money, cash, hoes""
I went from bashful to asshole to international, lover of self
Word to the mother on my last record cover, it's felt
Now deal with it

[Chorus: J Dilla]
I wanna get into it
Let’s do this
I wanna see you move it
So move it
So let’s just get into it
Let’s do this
Can you feel the music?
The music oh ah, can you feel the music, the music
[Verse 2: Common]
In this never-ending battle to please
Niggas, magazine writers, emcees
Who request hot shit, I freeze
And tell them where I was rose, we always said cold
Hold your horses and your carriages
This never-went-gold nigga rocks shows carat-less
You not gon' respect self, at least respect the heritage
Affecting lives is where the wealth and the merit is
I realize what I portray day to day, I gotta carry this
And beats, rhymes and life is where the marriage is
Had dreams of fucking R&B broads, it came true
Journalist I wreck, shared the same view
Picked up a fallen angel on the path that I emcee
Familiar voice, come to find out the angel was me
Some say ""You changing, Rashid""
Times are, we still close
I rhyme far, away away away
From what you accustomed to hearing everyday, uh-ah
You know the dope-choppin, gun-poppin, homies dying
I'm amongst it, save the war stories for Private Ryan, INI

[Chorus: J Dilla]
I wanna get into it
Let’s do this
I wanna see you move it
So move it
So let’s just get into it
Let’s do this
Can you feel the music?
The music oh ah, can you feel the music, the music
[Verse 3: Common]
Women cry, children laugh, men dance
I refuse to lose self and try to win fans
Over, weight on my shoulder fluctuates like Oprah's
My refrigerator poetry's magnetic like ultra
You couldn't hang if you was a poster
Posing like a bitch for exposure
It's rumors of gay emcees, just don't come around me with it
You still rockin hickies, don't let me find out he did it
Got my eyes on the tiger, eyes on the prize
Eyes on the thighs, of Mary J. Blige
Imagining how good the cat must be
Stop eatin meat, lost weight, but I still rap husky
My verse depth, is that of a baby's first step
Or the old lady who died and the nurse wept
I flow like cursive writing, inviting you and yours to my openess
Shows allow me to cop range like a vocalist
But man does not live on bread alone
What good is a range when it's time to head home?

I wanna get into it

[Verse 1]
If my heart stop pumping tomorrow don’t feel no sorrow
'Cause life is hard mentally and everything is meant to be
Sometimes I ask myself, if I was gone who will remember me?
It's hard to tell, oh well, sit back and sip this Hennessy
Now lately it's been hard to tell my friends part from my enemies
'Cause plenty niggas show me love but in their hearts they envy me
Why? I'm just a nigga from around the way
Told my momma I'll make it happen and I found a way
Pour out some liquor for my niggas at the crossroads
And may the Lord give guidance to the lost souls
I know that deep inside these niggas know it's more to life
Then mackin' hoes and stacking dough
Man I'm sort of like a nigga who done seen greener grass
So when they think they ballin' like The Dream Team
My nigga I done seen meaner cash
And I'm tryna get it, follow me nigga, I'm on a prowl
Headed to the top, you watching me nigga?
Then hold it down
[Chorus]
Hold it down, if you need to holla at me
Don’t hesitate to call, it ain't a problem
I can be there, I’d ride for you, lie for you
I know you’d do the same, I would die for you
So hold it down, and when the times is hard, I’ll be around
So hold me down, and it don’t matter how far, I’ll be around
Yeah, I'll hold you down

[Verse 2]
You was my nigga from the younger days, we grew up
I went to school, you went the other way
But still my brother man, I'm sitting, reminiscing on
All of them bitches we were tripping over, kissing on
Or at the skating rink we trying to bag some new hoes
And If I need gear, you let me hold ya new clothes, and vice-a-versa man
But now that life is worser man, a nigga slow caking
I'm broke tryna chase a dream, you just got probation and I'm stressed
Your little sister pregnant what’s next?
Oh shit my mama doing drugs, at times it's hard to feel blessed
In this madness I holla at my nigga in the sadness
Remember when ya mama tried to beat you with that bat shit?
Remember your chick Nina? Man that ass was the fattest
Remember my crush on Sabrina? Yo, she still the baddest
I'm just glad that I can holla at you, it's been a while
And til the next time I hear from you, ay, hold it down
[Chorus]
Hold it down, if you need to holla at me
Don’t hesitate to call, it ain't a problem
I can be there, I’d ride for you, lie for you
I know you’d do the same, I would die for you
So hold it down, and when the times is hard, I’ll be around
So hold me down, and it don’t matter how far, I’ll be around
Yeah, I'll hold you down

[Verse 3]
And these are tough times baby, but we’ll make it through
You know I'm headed for the top, I swear I'm taking you
Just hold a nigga down through this bad weather
The rain falling ain't balling but I have better
A woman with an ass and a strong mind, it's been a long time
Sometimes you on your bullshit, sometimes I'm on mine
Will I have a hard time to stay committed?
Or do I only want your voice moaning when I hit it?
Man only God knows
I know deep in your heart, you don’t want me to be no star though
'Cause groupies out there every show you scared I'm fucking every ho
And girl I ain't gon' lie and say I won't, 'cause shit you never know
But may the Lord give me strength, I love you more than anything
The future mother of my kids, the love is real and if we ever part, God forbid
I love you still so when I'm on the road don’t trip, you know I'm down for you
Keep it tight and don’t slip, and hold it down for me
[Chorus]
Hold it down, if you need to holla at me
Don’t hesitate to call, it ain't a problem
I can be there, I’d ride for you, lie for you
I know you’d do the same, I would die for you
So hold it down, and when the times is hard, I’ll be around
So hold me down, and it don’t matter how far, I’ll be around

And if one of these websites get the info
We can work it out, no Nintendo
I just hit Alt, Tab
Switchin' in between two convos
I should just call cabs
And bring 'em both here to the condo
Yeah, normally it ain't a question
We would cross paths like an intersection
But she just too far away for affection
So I pray that we never lose a connection
Cause I remember Stacy, she prolly hate me
She used to threaten she had a man to replace me
She talk that shit, I just hit the escape key
And then she get mad and wanna go and erase me
And I remember Amy, she used to AIM me
She stayed up late and used to blame me
She said I'm too wild, she wanna tame me
I told her even Photoshop couldn't change me
But you-you-you, you got me open girl, why lie
We ain't even tryna settle, so why try
End the night with a kiss and a bye bye
No strings attatched, your love is so Wi-Fi

Let it burn inside of me
Will I get away
Or will it end in tragedy

She had a body like Ms. Jackson

And I should of went home
But I let the phone roam

Watch that nigga disappear; hocus pocus
Ring, ring, a nigga won't sing
Ring, ring, I keep that bitch clean
Ring, ring a nigga won't sing
'Less he is an insomniac, he'll die in a dream
[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
You can tell I went to school on a small yellow bus
Never bothered me, strong arm robbery
I went from powdered jelly donuts to taking them Os
From my high school sweetheart to fucking with hoes
Look, I’m all grown up and I done blown up
Nigga, ain't much changed; in fact, things are the same
I’m the definition of shooter, gun of choice, the Ruger
You’ll take my word for it or make me do it to ya
I’m a magnet to murder, when I’m in the mood
Get convicted through the forensics when you walk in my shoes
I’m bad news, you niggas know the verdict, I’m filthy
Drop Phantom is milky, white on white
24 inch blades, I'm skatin'
Red eyes, smoking that bomb shit, I'm Satan
Nigga, surprise, 50 back on fire
50 back running round this bitch strapped, hitman for hire

[Hook: Pharrell]
It’s like Raid! Spraying on you roaches
The AK is an animal, it is ferocious
A nigga wanna sing, hope he is the dopest
Watch that nigga disappear; hocus pocus
Ring, ring, a nigga won't sing
Ring, ring, I keep that bitch clean
Ring, ring a nigga won't sing
'less he is an insomniac he'll die in a dream, ugh!
[Verse 3: Pusha T]
I sit with the liars, duck tape and tiers
Been lost their soul, they just waiting on the fire
Innocent faces with a shitload of priors
Something out of nothing, a team full of MacGyvers
Deep-sea dive for the fishscale
Tryna find a better price? Man, that ship sailed
Take a breath and head back if that shit failed
Drop weight like an anchor; then, you set sail
Hell freeze over like the watch I put the sleeve over
Engine devil-scream when I turn the key over
Pirellis on the street rolling like a steamroller
Bitches double-team when I have my sleepovers
Yuugh! Re-Up Gang with the G-Unit
This is tailor-made, drug dealer theme music
Test it on your tongue or either watch a fiend do it
I got you hooked and I laugh as you lean to it

[Hook: Pharrell]
It’s like Raid! Spraying on you roaches
The AK is an animal, it is ferocious
A nigga wanna sing, hope he is the dopest
Watch that nigga disappear; hocus pocus

Ring, ring, I keep that bitch clean
Ring, ring a nigga won't sing

Somersault Danger Mouse Remix,Zero 7,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: Sia]
You put my feet back on the ground
Did you know you brought me around [Somersault]
You were sweet and you were sound
You saved me

[Verse 1: DOOM]
She wondered would it hurt again, a scary new setting
A Mary Lou Retton perfect 10 -- was it worth it then?
Would have made the clique switch way back
For a quick pitch in the haystack
With a bad bitch like Payback with interest
Used to keep her nice coo trimless
Flipped it for a high school gymnast
She was thicker than the kick off ""Supersonic""
Sicker than the bubonic, to Vik it was platonic
Wow, found a new playmate
At this late stage in the game he couldn't get the name straight
Told her ""it was all up in your calf muscle""
Showed her how to pull it off, all laugh and tussle
At one point she thought he was a lame cat, with game for the rats
A dog to claim the blame at
Told her ""Maybe it's your momma fault, for giving you the shaker""
Summi-summi-somersault
[Chorus: Sia]
You put my feet back on the ground
Did you know you brought me around [Somersault]
You were sweet and you were sound
You saved me

[Verse 2: DOOM]
Butterflies at the very mention
The flutter of her eyelashes help to clear the tension
Then went and tripped and fell head over heels
V, and got dirtier than Red Rover's wheels
No matter how high-stake the price
This good-luck charm on his arm shake the dice
It's gymnastics, practice makes nice
She's not the type to be enticed by fake ice
Aah -- the stench of first love
The quench of the thirst made it worse
Truly the burst of upper-thrust motion
Trust, devotion
Lust is like the sand where the beach meets the ocean
Soaking, felt joy in the whirlwind
Never ever did he ever mention boyfriend/girlfriend
Demanded her respect
Then ran and did a handspring, almost landed on her neck

[Chorus: Sia]
You put my feet back on the ground
Did you know you brought me around [Somersault]
You were sweet and you were sound
You saved me"
Ill Be Around Outro,Charles Hamilton,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
I've been in the studio
Living under a rock
There's air conditioning
And I don't care if the summer is hot
And someone did not, tell me that the world still remembers me, misses me, and if they are they tryna' get to me
This would be, almost 3 months, since I've seen my family
I can't believe my family still receives me as family
Got dreams of grammys, pink hammies, and sweet candy, but my teeth can't be rotten if I don't see the dentist (Whenever you call me.)
I'm living in my prison, man you can't see my sentence
Serving two life terms cause I'm a repeat offender
Grandma, your birthday came and went, I was ashamed as shit that I didn't make a cent
Got a catalog of music, but a wallet full of lint
I know my uncle smirking like Charles is full of shit
But Unc, you got your own company, so you living comfortably, so you won't understand when it comes to me. (Whenever you call me.)
Ryan ain't got an older brother, I'm the closest, but I'm the brokest
My prognosis is psychosis
I'm a dropout, a junkie, and a drunk
Honestly, is that the kind of company you want around your son?
That's why I run, that's why I'm numb, That's why I'm such a fucking punk
Two bars is too hard to try to pay you back for the money you gave so all I can say is that..
[Chorus]
Whenever you call me
I'll be there
Whenever you call me
I'll be there
Whenever you call me
I'll be there
Whenever you call me
I'll be
Whenever, whenever you call me
I'll be there
Whenever you call me
I'll be there
I'll be around
(I'll be around)
I'll be around
(I'll be around)
(Whenever you call me)

[Verse 2]
Hey Toya, I know you sick of my excuses
I'm sick of leaving bruises, not physically abusive
But I'm giving you my two cents, my attention goes to music
Thinking it's some new bitch, then you get reclusive
Damn, I be out rhyming with Bryan, you be home pining and crying, Why?
When I finally see you, you probably think I'm lying
I know sometimes you wish you could pop me with the iron (Whenever you call me.)
Only thing I loved more than you was my music
But bitch, you was my music
And to you stupid fucking listeners, listen up, Toya is my woman to the end, she don't give a fuck
I could call her bitch, she knows it's not an insult
Don't make me interrupt this verse again, yo
You're like a dream come true, music's a dream come true, I got dreams of music, wanna see my dreams come true. (Whenever you call me.)
For every night, when I dream girl, I dream of you
Every time I say dream, girl, I think of you
So listen, and you will see that I am telling you, you're gonna love me, I'll die and go to hell for you
There's nothing for me to do but to tell the truth
I wanna treat my girl the same way the fellas do
HchO and B-Tay, Jada and B-A they make it through each day, make it seem easy! (Whenever you call me.)
Look at Sha-leik, he basically needs Dre
My world was upside down during the break up of three days
And to my niggas, where would I be without you?
I love y'all to death, but I really doubt you
Understand the influence you have on me, Bagdad, I almost cried when me and you did that song B. Damn
Idolized you in '04, you was acting so cool, but your raps is so raw (Whenever you call me)
Used to go home and listen to Run and R. And Swiss, I swear I'd never thought we'd get along
But I consider you a uncle, except you're my age, and I know I act young and I cause you migraines
But, you show some empathy to all of my pain, and I think you understand that I'm really not sane
HchO, words can't express my gratitude, there's somethings I can't forget, (whenever you call me)
So if you need anything, the answer's yes
I mean that I said that with my hand on my chest. (Damn.)
Yo Bird, you brought me to Toya, thank you
I swear to God I'm sorry that I wrote Kane and Abel
And Nate, you turned out great, I said that with no hate
Dead ass though
Wait until the cash grow, who knew Oswego would be our last show?
And Darden, It feels like I've known you since kindergarten
You're growing up, so I beg you not to get retarded
And don't listen to bitches saying men are garbage
Cause I'm a man, here's my promise"
Ghetto Story Steady Mobbin,Lupe Fiasco,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Lupe talking]
You know I had to do it, man
It wouldn'ta been right if I didn't
You seen it? You seen the show last night on TV?
You seen nigga's rims man? You seen the new Jordans man?
You see her ass yo? Yeah, yeah, that's crazy

[Singing]
Seein' with my ghetto eyes
I walked with my ghetto feet
I talked with my ghetto speech
I'm copacetic, I won't let it bring me down
Bring me down...

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
I say it's instilled
As I peep from beneath the titled brim of my pinwheel
Steady mobbin', heavy problems
Genocide desensitized to violence
Makes it hard to sympathize
Harden, individuals whose feelings is minuscule
Soon become criminals if you dark-skinned
And you was raised in a project apartment
Public Aid made it that your father couldn't stay
He had to part then, left with only a mother
The family structure suffers
He will soon cling to hustlers, as his guardians
He still a boy, needs to fill a void, marchin'
Up the block up to no good, sellin' in the wrong hood
He was taken down by a marksmen
At his wake, 8th Grade Graduation picture
Last words: Don't let the habitation get ya
Pardoned, Lord have mercy on the fallen
Amen, feel like I'm hardened
Got the harbinger for the coming of the carpenter
Til then, I got some big fish to fry like Marlins
Part niggas, steady mobbin'
[Chorus]
I've got some questions to ask
And I'm waitin' on some answers
Like, Why do the good die young?
Why ain't there no cure for cancer?
Won't let the streets dictate my glory
Cause it's something out there for me
But I'mma flee my territory
So I won't end up, just a ghetto story
Just a ghetto story, just a ghetto story
Just a ghetto story, just a ghetto story

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
And I try to see past it
Through the down-roll window on
The driver side of my Caprice Classic
Steady mobbin', corner store traffic
I.e. dope fiends, hookers and teens with alcohol IVs
I see, plastic, cups is a nickel
50 cent for Dutch Masters
My big brother's Pelle Pel' lingers
Of a fargone weed smoke
Lookin' for greener pastures, pasturized 2% for $2.19
You can get 2 quarts, there's also a sale on Newports
A separate line for Lotto, bumpy face, add a model
Huggin' a bottle, salt and sour Jays, and blueberry Hugs
Shorties consider a meal, been my feel for it
Sweatin' for a pair of Air Jordans they would steal for
And a gold chain 4 fiends would
Knife, wild and kill yours
There's nothing too promising on our billboards
Drink Tanqueray, eat KFC, come abort your child
Buy Nikes, which makes it highly
Unlikely that we gon' fight, G
Steady mobbin'
[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
And I'm still on
As I stroll down the same street so
Many like me once before, were killed on
Steady mobbin', thinkin' bout the Black Panthers
And the babies that were born in the late '80s
That now have babies that lack Pampers
No Kwaanzas and they lack Santas
And the father who thinks shoe-shopping is the answer
Skipped out on parenthood classes so
She don't know how to handle her
And never learned from her grandmother
One day got hot, couldn't take it
Dropped her in a vacant lot
Album of Life, now condensed into a sampler
See the shapes these little girls is gettin'?
Some say the steroids in the chicken is
The cause of the thickening in the young women
Livid, see some shorties playin' Cops & Robbers, livin'
Bittersweet thoughts is what I had for them
I can picture quota fillin' Police chasin' after them
Catchin' up to, friskin' and askin' them
Where the packs at? Who yo' chief
Is? Where the straps at?
Am I thinking too hard? Or perhaps that's reality
In a project mentality, but through it all
I hope we learn more than how to be
Whores and how to move a ball
Steady mobbin'

Untitled A.K.A. Change the Beat Bonus Track,Viktor Vaughn,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Part 1]

[Intro]
And so, Viktor Vaughn hid from the world
A fascinating story, but it changes nothing

[Interlude]

[Outro]
Oh, word
Nah, yo, change that beat
That's alright, but, the other shit— other shit was iller

[Part 2]

[Intro]
Word, word
Yo, that shit is dope right there

[Verse 1]
A modern day marvel, but terrible— better, horrible
When he grab the mic from son, he crushed up all his metacarpals
He said he ain't mean it, totally by accident
After the show, he didn't follow where y'all taxi went
Will this be available on wax? Ask Max Mill
They on the opposition to his ass-wack tax bill
But will it pass the senate? Slum lord tenant
And it's super like 1-A, have a fun stay
One day, he plan to put in a runway
With enough land for his own projects and gun play
Section eight penthouse, maid look like Faye Dunaway
A lot of y'all ass out like gay runaway
It's, how they say? Semi-risqué
All day everyday, give out Emmys the quick way
Have the average MC say, ""Give me a sick day""
They really ain't got shit to say like Timmy McVeigh (Oh, shit)
Get a hunch, a real rag tag bunch
In school, he kept a durag in a bag lunch
Just to eat heads on some breakdance shit and spit
He writ this skit in Sanskrit
If the pants fit, sport 'em, but rock 'em low
Your man like Rollo on the slow, can't knock it, though
It's like the same hustle, bro, two knuckles glow
Tucked in Le Tigre just to let the name buckle show
[Part 3]

[Verse 2]
Good googly moogly, see that loogie?
Yeah, but keep it on the D.L. Hughley
You don't watch her, he might house her like Doogie
Just to cut her loosie like, swoosh, Mitsurugi
Gooey gum drops
Who he got his style from? His pops
You gotta give the bum some props
Ask your sister, her beat box is more thicker
DOOM that nigga detox with more liquor

[Part 4]

[Verse 3]
Villain for hire, admire the sound
Make sure the price is right before he come on down (Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh)
Rappers be on some, ""You, you, you""
Forgot who they talking to, too much pork stew
They need to not come out with nothing new
Blew the whole shit up on some, ""What this button do?""
DOOM cheat the game like walkthrough
Run 'em, son 'em like Mr. Rourke do Tattoo
The way a lot of clowns get down is unnatural
This flow flip like oranges, apples
Rhymes is like limes to a Lemonade Snapple
Leave her at the chapel, don't eat scrapple
First thing they notice when they come to is they bling is gone
Then they start remembering the Klingon with the rings on
In came the Villain with the old gear like, ""Hi, there""
""Y'all play the rear, this whole year my year""
Metal Face beard like Brillo pad
Y'all know his steelo, so don't feel so bad
Seed call him, ""Old dad,"" the one the old ho had
Knew he was a winner since a swimmer in the gonads
Okay, pal, pay him like PayPal
So we could be A-OK, not O.K. Corral
I think today, I'll make the ladies say, ""Ow""
And maybe fuck around take a bow now
[Part 5]

[Verse 4]
Who made his first mill and still carry razor blades?
Used to be straight A's and still made the grade?
Retarded ass, how he get cash so fast?
Year after last, he left back in the retarded class
Should've went to BOCES
Watch him all closely, who he think he supposed to be?
Villain who always win, at least he stay consistent
Find out where that bitch went, get a room, pitch a tent (Yeah)

Yo, Max, yo, change that beat, yo
You got another one?
Nah, yo"

Silly girl to be a fool
You didn't play the golden rule
Cause once you're through with one world
There's another waiting there

[Verse 1]
Y'all motherfuckers walk around like you got a wire
My watch face the same size as a Ducati tire
Everybody hit the deck when the shotty fire
Vinnie give your team problems like I'm Stoudemire
Your fam should be ashamed of you still
This ain't a cookout but Vinnie put the flame to your grill
You claim to be real but y'all just end up painfully killed
My four-fifth is vicious, cold enough for Satan to chill
I don't give a fuck cousin, everybody can fry
Everyone could be a victim, everybody could cry
Only a real man look another dead in the eye
And tell him that he only got like twenty seconds to die
I'm slow but I realise that's my best pace
My voice raw, when I spit it crack through my chest plate
I ain't the type of motherfucker to test fate
The type of motherfucker to increase the arrest rate
Streets fucked up suffering bad
There's no kush, motherfuckers stuck hustling skag
Yeah, same ones get stuck with the mag
Hard rock turn to rubble cause he's fucking a fag

I'mma go hard 'tll nothing is left
Till there's nothing left in the world, nothing but death
And the .38 tucked in my vest
And I stare at my guns like they're a pair of voluptuous breasts
I don't care, I'll take one in my chest
If it means seeing my father again and maybe touching his flesh
I'll walk around with thirty guns in my sweats
If it means that I'm eating and my mother eating, son of success
I see the world different than y'all
I have more determination and persistence than y'all
It's probably why I have such a resistance to y'all
It's probably why I been so much more consistent than y'all
It's business-involved, I'm everything that you could possibly dream
I'm a mathematician, I'm a vision, I'm a machine
Know what I mean? I roll with brothers pushing rock to the fiends
Roll with brothers who love their mothers, stay on top of their Deen
Louie Dogs rap harder than most
And I got something that rearrange your face and turn your pop to a ghost
You get rocked with the toast
And I make you put your hands up like people that are talking in quotes

Silly girl to be a fool
You didn't play the golden rule

On full moon, man switch to wolf
Full proof verse from Hell to Turnbridge Wells
You never seen an MC do it this well
Everyday we battle at Saint Germaine's Chapel
But it's practical, I'll smash you and nobody laughs at you
The Ripper rip you up, drag you behind the basilica
They find drugs, lyrics and blood, I hit you up
Lonely heart vocal throwing dart oligarch
Creates art from an upstate New York motor park
And won't get off his high horse to come talk unless it's important
And it could cause a spark, but it's dark so he stays dormant
You don't want it, you just act like it
Your style ain't flawless you just rap like it
I'm level 3-A like Curtis LeMay
The Blackhawk bird of prey with superb taste
I re-inject my blood to give me a buzz
Then I re-inject the buzz, blow out your earplugs
Scrub your eardrums, suck the air out of your lungs
You combust in a vacuum of solar flare from the Sun
I walk through a gestalt of thought to the sound of a harp
From afar playing the notes I was taught
I was caught, shackled, sold, re-bought
Global mind forced to restart, my rhymes skipped forward
The HRH of time and space
And rhymes through the bars, my lines displace
Concentrate, mitigate concrete debate
Great how I create what you hired me to make
Extrapolate, update rap at a rapid rate
Fans hate it ‘cause I can't practice everyday
Numismatic treasure chest stashed in the attic
Spondulix in exchange for the musical magic
With two tablets placed on the cabinet, I wonder who will grab it?
If no one does, I'll have it
Both lobes connected, flow been perfected
Whatever method, select it, let's spit
Incredulous lyrics, the breath of life spreading through the spirit
Hip-Hop never knew what hit it
Stubby beard, chubby skin under the hair
I spent my wonder years carrying nothing but guns and gear
With a focused rap flow, tongue snap like a hybrid bow
My quotes end up inside your throat
Respect for Hip Hop balance the Biosphere
But I've been there before so why go there?
I soar through the air, my clarity so clear
That my Dalai Lama prayer give me cauliflower ears
I've been rhyming for years
Climbing the monastery stairs being involuntarily prepared..."

In the backseat (I wanna get beside ya)
In the backseat (So I can be your backseat driver)
In the backseat (I wanna get beside ya)
In the backseat (So I can be your backseat driver)
[Bridge: Campa]
I met a group of girls in a Escalade
I met a group of girls in a Escalade
Met a, met a group of girls in a Escalade
They came wit'chu and left with me
I met a group of girls in a Escalade

Met a, met a group of girls in a Escalade
They came wit'chu and left with me

[Hook: Cyrano & (Dev)]
Don't say a word just turn around and let me see
Girl you got some'n special, some'n special for me?
It's way too many suckers in the V.I.P
Valet got my car out front, tell me do you wanna kick it
In the backseat (I wanna get beside ya)
In the backseat (So I can be your backseat driver)
In the backseat (I wanna get beside ya)

Trap Door,MF DOOM,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'alternative']","[MF Doom]
He moves the crowd like a cursor on zoom
No curse words, DOOM the worst church nerd verse heard
Appeared blurred to a million true believers
He's the supervillain arm dealer to the divas
Catch, amongst other world scandals
Butter pearl handles to match your girl's sandals
Plan was hatched by a pack of old vandals
Whose flag was a black and gold patch with bloody anvils
""Hit 'Em to the Head"" was the motto
And one more time to make sure them dead, BLAKKO
When you throw blows in a knife fight, Paco
That's how it goes in this Modern Life like Rocko
Clock dough 24-7 cycle
When it comes to flows he got more than a mic full
Pull a broad like a dyke bull on a long bid
You're messin with the wrong kids Michael
... it ain't Jack-son
For him to flip scripts like camera, action
Villain! Raw by the laws of attraction
For future generation's information - the black one
... Move the crowd like a buddha cloud
The purple, puff puff pass 'round the circle
A jerk well renowned for his work skill
He's out, the proof is the computer's down Urkel
MC a show via wi-fi
And paid way before we wrap it up like tie-dye
Hip-Hop sci-fi you can see
He had the eye of the tiger through the mask like the Fry Guy
Just made a baby Olmec dome check
Left some folks' ancestors home wreck
With blown backs these lesser known facts thwart evil
It got no reason, like short people
No offense, his feet was burnt brass
Whenever he walked on the street it turned glass
On his lucky rat's paw in the crap drawer
All the world's a stage, where's the trap door, slackjaw
Logic, to keep your mind in the project
Drop the check, his job is to chop necks
That's just payback for noses there's no psych though
What they don't know like Bo
Won't hurt Diddley squat
Got to be kiddin me, not
Seriously plot, to put a hit out on a G-spot
Gypped like Egypt out their kettles and they teapot"
Excerpt,Xian,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1 - Xian]
X-I-A-N GR8T MUSIC
Used to have a crush on this chick named Reina
Hair was so nice, didn’t need no peina
Played guitar and sang, she was an entertainer
Probably made her dad proud… more like Jaina
Let me explain, and paint a vivid image
Basketball, I played for her in every scrimmage
Thought of her for strength, didn’t need no spinach
She must have been a snitch cause I chased her like Quidditch
Let me tell you how the story went
I did a little prank that wasn’t taken how I meant
Took her pics from Myspace and replaced the guys in them with my face
Had no idea this would make me such a disgrace
It was a shoddy cut and paste job on every file
Couldn’t help but laugh out loud all the while
When I did this mischief didn’t know how pissed it would make her
I thought me, a misfit, could somehow date her
Thought she’d think it was funny and cute like a bunny
I put them up as pic comments on her profile
Probably made her sick, vomit, and go file
An order of restraint or at least a complaint
Wasn’t trying to be sleazy or creepy, no
The reasons aren’t that various
Just thought it’d be hilarious
Obviously kind of stalkery, you think I was blind right?
Well you know what they say about hindsight
It was freaky and weird, I’m honestly saying
But sorry Reina, I was just playing
[Hook]
This has been on my mind for quite some time
I just find it best not to repress regrets
Not a song to impress, no fiery hook
This is just a look into my diary book

Mag, valuable, but not a high price tag
But still cruising through your city with her bright Coach bag
She’s my homie, so you know I totes brag
But it’s kind of bad, makes me sad, makes me opposite of glad
To feel us drift apart, here and there, just a tad
Brad is still my lad
But me and Mag went together like lines and plaid
What’s going on, is something going wrong?
Am I just played out like that Em' and Rihanna song?
Am I just out of style like leopard print thongs?
Will she be there when I defeat Justin Wong?
Will she be a maid of honor when I marry Brenda Song?
Man I hope so, this slope’s so slippery
Feels like a losing battle, so Clippery
But unlike them, our plight is different
Our friendship lost flight
Feels like we’re missin' our Griffin
Looks like our future, but I hope it isn’t
I know you heard this, but I hope you listened
[Hook x 2]
This has been on my mind for quite some time
I just find it best to get stress off my chest
Not a song to impress, no fiery hook
This is just a look into my diary book"
Killers,J. Cole,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Momma, I just killed a man
My body still trembling, can you feel my hand?
Don’t shed no tears, it won’t be long before they find out it was me, Momma
This may be the last time you see me free, Ma, don't spend it crying
You did your best, me, I was blessed, know you were stressed trying
To keep me out the streets, me, ducking police
Trying not to make a peep to wake you up out your sleep
A drunk and high fool
Skipping class, flunking high school
I know you taught me better, somehow I never learned
Said I was playing with fire, somehow I never burned
You tried to set me straight, somehow I never permed
You tried to show me right, but somehow I never turned
Lost in a cloud of marijuana, are you 'shamed of me?
Dry your face off, Mommy, you're not to blame for me
See, I’m a man, I gotta take whatever came for me
At times I wonder ’bout my father, would it change for me if he was around?
Would I still be running 'round with the lowlifes?
Bum ass niggas no jobs, no life
Seen them niggas kill for no price
I watched his life flash before his eyes like a strobe light
I pulled the trigger, Momma
Tryna be hard, I ain't mean to kill the nigga, Momma
But what’s done is done
I’m on the run, I live my life like a movie now it’s way too realer
Who would've thought your baby boy would've grew up to be a killer?
[Chorus]
Yeah, now I’m a killer
Guess I’m a killer
They got me in here with the killers
Yeah, I mean the killers

[Interlude: Richard Pryor]
""I mean—murderers! Do you hear me? Real live murderers!
I thought black people killed people by accident!
Nah, these motherfuckers was murderers.""

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Yeah, I wonder what's in store for me, lately been stressing
Pray for blessings, hope that there’s more for me than just a simple life
Niggas that I used to hoop with is doing triple life
Gave up the jump shot, worked on the gunshot
Who woulda thought? I used to block this nigga's lay-ups
Now he’s in a cell layed up
I wish you well, stay up like insomniacs
This life can make a nigga fold like a laundry mat, uh
I sip this cognac, though
To ease my brain from all this pain and so that I react slow
In this fast world, slow niggas, fast girls
Ho's give up ass while these ho niggas hold triggers
Blast on ‘em, hold up that old checker flag for ‘em
Chalk lines by the do not walk sign, it’s deep
All these cold hearted niggas holding heat
I’d rather blast before they steal a nigga
Tell ‘em now boy, don’t make me turn into a killer, nigga
[Chorus]
Yeah, into a killer
Don’t make me turn into a killer
Yeah, to a killer, yeah yeah

[Interlude: Richard Pryor]
""Triple life... How do you do triple life?
That mean if he die and come back... He gotta go to penitentiary!
Right there, he said ""Fuck kindergarten. Get your little ass on in the penitentiary, motherfucker. You know what you did last time.""

[Verse 3]
To those who had love for me in the past
Who woulda ever thought that time would fly by so fast
I remember back in class we used to make believe
Like it was draft day, swore that we would make the league and be rich
Saturday morning had to rake the leaves, aw shit
Watch how they pile up, seem like a mile up
I washed the blisters on my hands and then I'd dial up
My best friend, skating rink is where we headed at night
And if a nigga disrespect, oh yes, we ready to fight
In retrospect that shit seem petty, at the time the shit was heavy
'Cause life was all about your name
You had to scrap with any nigga that would call you lame
Ashamed no doubt, so many niggas got their brains blowed out
Snatch a niggas chain and he got his name wrote out
In obituaries, another body in a cemetery
Another young nigga in the penitentiary
And he don’t give a fuck: no missionary
Rap visionary, paint a picture, nigga: Pictionary
Tell you what it is, I’m a dictionary
I knew a nigga threw his dick in e'ry chick in e'ry
City that he went to, went hard like the rent due
'Til he met the wrong bitch
Her man just came home, ex-convict
And he stay on with that Thriller
Shit, fucking around with them killers
[Outro]
Yeah, with them killers
Fucking around with them killers
Say I’m a killer"
Dreams,Bobby Fischer (Rapper),"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]:

All day, we dream of the life
Hopping on planes, rock a stage all night
We got to stay high, so the weed we light
Blow the la in the sky, one more time, uh
All day, we dream of the life
Hopping on planes, rock a stage all night
We got to stay high so the weed we light
Blow the la in the sky, hands high now

[Verse 1]:

My life good, barely ever get no bad news
Just smoke blunts with my boys in the bathroom
Of my dorm--I went from sitting on the porch
To opening for Big Sean, homie it's on!
There's no going back, so I got my flow exact
So precise, I ignite every time I'm on the mic
Every night that I write, I'm thinking back upon my life
Memories got me tight like a blunt that won't light
80 proof got me loose, I'm just doing what I do
Now I go to school up in NYU
And ohhh (laughs) you know we celebrating
My dad stressing that I got to get my education
But dad I ain't waiting, I want them bright lights
Wanna rock them white Nikes living in the night life
Get my girl nice ice, and throw my boys paper
Then wave to all the haters while I'm in my aviators like, ""what?!""
[Hook]

[Verse 2]:

I seen hard times, so the grind--I'm on mine
Used to rob part time, I was slinging all dimes
Now I'm hard to find, in the booth all the time
Writing rhymes cause my crime wasn't organized
Used to chill at my moms, and kick it with Ricky
I told him I would blow up, and he was coming with me
Now we on the top floor looking at the city
I'm looking at my girl, and damn she look pretty
I'm glad she stuck with me, she was giving love
Back when we were living tough, and I didn't have enough
To get up on the bus, but now we live it up
Every article that's written, she go and pin it up
But I ain't get enough, dog I wanna get it all
Bring gifts down to Bristol like the skinny Mr. Claus
I'm looking forward to the chance to look back
God gave me half a chance, and look, I took that (hah!)

[Hook]

[Bridge]:

Clap your hands now (clap your hands now)
You are rocking with the man now
Clap your hands now (clap your hands now)
Everybody clap your hands, come on!
[Verse 3]:

My girl looking fly in whatever she slipping on
But I'm a get her triple digit dresses when I'm getting on
Tell my boys tell your tenements ""bon voyage""
I'm a take us out the hood, the real Entourage
The non-fiction Vince, Fischer is invincible
Used to feel invisible, I was living miserable
But my father raised a resilient individual
I'm giving you my gift and I'm nowhere near my pinnacle
So we never hit the club, but we live it up
Liquored up--if you spill it then you better lick it up
If he fall pick him up but never let him live it down
There's no way I could've fathomed how I'm living now
Back when I was sitting down living at my girl's house
Distraught, lost, trying to figure this world out
Now fire flies out my mouth, there's no doubt
I'm a blow up and make my whole town so proud..."
Popular Demand,Cane,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Good morning class, I'm 'bout to give a lesson in
Hip-Hop, for those of you who questionin'
Thought I was done guess again
When it seems like I'm finished I'm only catchin' my second wind
Rap marathon runner
Flow juiced up to blow Barry Bonds cover
80s baby like Shannon Sharpe's number
Plus two fuck you if you slumber
I don't need no connection, they all laggin'
I mean they all swagged out but they non-swaggin'
How can a skinny work ethic grow fat pockets?
They be slackin, and I don't even have Dockers
Just some denim and the venom flow
So presentable I bet ya end up on my genitals
You'll be attached to my chords like umbilical
Cause they angelical its heaven when I'm in the zone
Somthing like Fergie and Jesus
Ya heard me? I mean this I serve thee like Venus
Fly trap eat 'em up make 'em lie flat
Party like a Pi-Kap guy frat high-dap
Or high-five, same diff likewise
King bars, you got bite-size
People say you got some good bars
But my mom says all you rap about is how good you are
She ain't lyin', but I ain't either
Like I ain't ether
Every beat I featured on your girl thinks I'm a keeper
I'm on the rise like levitra to an eager senior
If I'm cranky I'm in need of either a beat or some reefer
Its nothin personal, I'm somthin versatile
He money, he dough, Turkoglu
I never heard of you, you never heard of me
I understand but thats absurd to me
They said get it out there so im goin yard
Tryin to get my cut of the green, I'm mowin yards
I'm throwin bars knowin that I'm goin far
Goin hard, sharp as throwin darts into Owens heart
I'm older Favre, and younger Brett
Plus the one under jets whats coming next?
Better with age like a fine wine
Tryin to make that light right
Lime like prime time
Neon, Deion, beyond peons
On a recon mission for the green like vegans
Eat on beats I will feast on
Flow dirty as the couch Rick James put his feet on
""No I will not make out with you""
OK, teach on
I went to school and learned econ
I'm prestigious, just peep the school my degree from
And I'mma keep it movin with this shit
Till I'm on demand like movies at the crib
I admit I'm a little looney-tooney with this shit
Just to prove I can spit I'll hock a loogie in this bitch
This is simply exercise, just practice
Yeah the fact is I could make up words
And the shit would be real like a shaqtus
You couldn't match this with e-harmony
It ain't hard to breathe, guess again

I be a patient man waiting for the rain to come down
My feet touch the ground but my head's in the clouds
I be Prometheus Brown stealing the fire out of heaven
The setting is several city blocks off the 71 stop
I walk about the District, distracted by
The decadent madness of all the undergrads and addicts
Club rats, heads, space cadets and pragmatics
One of the few places that they coexist on the planet
Whatever happened to the Avenue before the summer of 2002
Lounging with crew on 42nd
My, how time flies when we're waiting for the chariot
Eating vegan sandwiches with cannabis subtracting our sobriety
Pondering society itself
He's eyeing me like I ain't going to bring it to his health
He don't want it, cause certainly he knows he's just another
Sucker without his fraternity brothers to back him up

To the edge of the bubble, all delinquents they laugh, they sayin'
Fuck class, get your education on The Ave
[Verse 2]
I be a patient man, waiting and checking for the sound
Of potential break records up at Second Time Around
In fact, we made this track from a sample we jacked
From some vinyl we dug up out of the crates on The Ave
Rats escape the lab, infestations 'n all
There be cracks on the sidewalk made from the fall
A natty dreadlock strumming on his broken guitar
Singing Babylon Fall outside of the bookstore
I purchased a journal in which the verses I recite, reside
I write vividly to capture the vibe
I'm like ""Hey kid, walk straight, master your high
If you listen you can hear the eye of the city cry""
The sound is often drowned by hollering scholars
Intoxicated so save it for the coffee shop philosophers
The so-called artists, the poets and the prophets
Scenery is changing, and nobody can stop it

[Chorus]
Campus Parkway up to 41st, 42nd, 43rd, 45th, and up to 47th
To the edge of the bubble, all delinquents they laugh, they sayin'

Fuck shorty and send her OT wit a brick in her baggage
Roll where the clubs at slip for the rabbit
Trick only lick dick status to get cabbage
She get lathered to the dick baptist
Who back on the map? Giancana wit a vengeance
It's drama to the finish, put the Llama to your appendix
And squeezing the slugs, gun powder season your blood
I'm a legend breathing, the reason you thug (nigga)

Up In The Air,Dumbfoundead,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","When I dropped out of high school, I didn't tell a soul
Cause no one﻿ was supposed to know
Now I'm looking at the window sky high in the air
Plane traveling all across the globe
That boy from the block with that loud voice box
He really came into his own
From being picked on to being first pick
This feels like the twilight zone
Sitting in the window seat wondering if this is real
Can it be, is this a dream, am I in it still?
Once I land I'm the man, another city killed
I played a lot of shows, many of them shitty bills
I'm here for one night, no time to sight see
Flew overhead to the left and the right wing
See the lights being, catch me in your kite string
Its been a pleasure y'all feel free to write﻿ me

I know it's been a really long time since you seen me
Up in the air, I've been up in the air
Chilling on cloud 9, now you know where to find me
Up in the air, I'll be up in the air
Forget the round trip, give me﻿ a one way
Its been a year since the case of the Mondays
See my peers have the face of the mundane
I'm in a place you can taste all the sun rays
I'm feeling so high, higher that I've ever been
But then again I've had that California medicine
Getting text from my hometown sweetheart
With a wallet full of hotel key cards
From where the sewer is up to the stewardess
They ask me what I do, I'm in the music biz
I left the baggage home, I brought my luggage in
Me and my girl,﻿ we experiencing turbulence
This is my get away, this is my everyday
Call me superhero, I need to get a cape
Strangers in paradise, it's time to get appointed
We're sitting so close I feel like we're related
Watch me kiss the sky, throw him the 65
I got my boarding﻿ pass, waiting in the ticket line
I'm not a star yet but took a gang of pictures
Next time that I'm here, I'll be slightly bigger

Yo, Tech, it's the last call, baby, what's good?

Before we get outta here you gotta drop one last gem on 'em though fam
No question, it's like the elders told me
No one person can do everything (Uh-huh)
But everyone can do something
So we gotta rep for all the niggas that ain't here right now
On the outro tip, the One Remix

[Verse 1: Akir]
Yo, One Enterprises comprises the artist and the sound
The pen and paper plays my savior while I'm gettin' down
Pray for my neighbors as a favor for holdin' me down
Slave for my papers as I savor the way that it pounds
It's underground, but the blatant vibrations widely found
Facin' the nation, complacent radio stations now
Stop hesitatin' and contemplatin' the way we patient
Start motivatin' and get them playin' the shit we sayin'
Ain't no delayin' in this war that we gettin' slayed in
'Cause time's a-wastin' while we stand adjacent to abrasions
Their fouls are more than flagrant
And so I see the prisons' cages while I pound the pavement
Lookin' for payment, sayin', ""Fuck enslavement!""
Usin' the tools of old ancients
Announcin' my engagment to this music that we makin'
Ain't no fakin' on tracks, and we ain't never come wack (Never)
Immortal Technique and Akir, y'all niggas fear it's a wrap
It's like…

One love, one music
One people, one movement
One heart, one spark

One gift, one lift
One stance, one shift
One way, one day
One, One, One, One, One

Immortal Technique in the trenches with my nigga Akir
Our family surived the genocides so we could be here
And now we enterprise the aftermath, one in the same
Livin' the revolution 'til we catch one in the brain
And even then my spirit'll return in heavenly form
And wipe the chessboard clean of my enemy's pawns
The Red Dawn Communist threat, buried and gone
So they invented a war the government can carry on
It makes me wonder if the word of God is lost in the man
This is for the children of Iraq lost in the sand
This is for the illest emcees that'll never be known
And this is for all the soliders that'll never come home
I wrote this for Mumia, stuck in the beast
The people who march in the streets and struggle for peace
For hood niggas, born rugged, never rockin' Versace
Eddie Ramierez' cousin George, and my old friend Sashi
Chris from the block and all my niggas stuck in a cell
Paul Wolfowitz, motherfucker, I'll see you in Hell
My destiny's to show the world that the music is real
Go back in time and play this shit for the slaves in the field
And for my children in the future that are waitin' to breathe
People slowly dyin' hangin' on, waitin' to leave
Believe when I'm gone and this album's on a library shelf
I'll be one with God and one with you and everything else

One love, one music
One people, one movement
One heart, one spark
One, One, One, One
One gift, one lift
One stance, one shift
One way, one day
One, One, One, One, One

[Outro: Immotal Technique]
Yeah, Revolutionary Vol. 2 has been brought to you
By the type of motherfuckers who ain't scared of shit
And if you playin' this album, and I'm no longer here
Sometime far away from when I recorded this
Remember that history
Isn't the way the corporate-controlled media made it look like
Read between the lines and free your mind
Revolution is the birth of equality
And the antithesis to oppression
But this is only built for real motherfuckers
So when I'm gone, don't let nobody I never got along with try to make songs kissin' my ass, recyclin' my beats or my vocals
The shit is real over here, man, thank you for listenin'
And thank you for supportin' independent hip hop
The heart and soul of our culture
Keepin' the truth alive, goodnight, my people, goodnight"

Sex good but her brain like top knotch
And her nigga is a square no hop skotch"
All About U,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: 2Pac + Dru Down]
Ah, yeah! Hahaha (Yeah)
It's all about you, one time (I'ma say it's all about you, baby, yeah)
Haha, for the bitches that think it's all about you (It's all about you) (This Dru Down in the house
With my boy 'Pizznac, you know what I'm sayin'?)
It's all about you (Yeah, I'm gon' say it's all about you
But you know I'm lyin' though, ha! Yeah)

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
You probably crooked as the last trick
Want to laugh 'bout how I got my ass
Caught up with this bad bitch?
Thinkin' I had her, but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck, I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club, I see you starin' like you want it
Well, baby, if you got it, better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla, but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us sweatin', can I hit it? (Hell no)
Addicted to the things you do
But still true what I'm sayin', boo, ‘cause this is all about you
[Chorus: Nate Dogg & 2Pac]
Every other city we go, every other video (It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho (It's all about you)
Every other city we go, every other video (It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I make a promise if you go with me, just let me know
I'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me, I'm a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
I love niggas 'cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care?
Creep though, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friend's video
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through
It's all about you
Yeah, nigga, it's all about you

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & 2Pac]
Every other city we go, every other video (It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video (It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
[Verse 3: Hussein Fatal]
Is you sick from the dick, or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch-ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho?
You think it's all about you? Well, boo
I gets down like Dru, and my nasty new niggas, too

[Verse 4: Yaki Kadafi]
You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold diggin', cold diggin' a gold Rolex

[Verse 5: Hussein Fatal]
I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cut, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia
(It's all about you)

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & 2Pac]
Every other city we go, every other video (It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video (It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video (It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
I'm tellin' ya, it's the same old shit
I mean, goddamn, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm sittin' back, watchin' Montell Jordan video
I see the same bitch who was in my homeboy Nate Dogg video
Then I flip the channel, I'm checkin' out my homeboy 2Pac video
I see the same bitch that was in my video
You know what I'm sayin'? And then, you know what I'm sayin'?
What make that even more fucked up
I'm watchin' a Million Man March
And I see the same bitch on the Million Man March
That was in the homeboy Warren G video!
I mean, damn, everywhere I look, everywhere I go
I see the same ho
Don't get mad, I'm only bein' real, yeah"
Long Live Palestine,Lowkey,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Lowkey]
This is for Palestine, Ramallah, West Bank, Gaza
This is for the child that is searching for the answer
I wish I could take your tears and replace them with laughter
Long live Palestine, long live Gaza
Palestine, Ramallah, West Bank, Gaza
This is for the child that is searching for an answer
I wish I could take your tears and replace them with laughter
Long live Palestine, long live Gaza

[Verse 1: Lowkey]
While we listen to tunes, made by ignorant fools
Israel blocked the UN from delivering food
They'll bring in the troops and you won't even glimpse at the news
They make money off the products that we are quick to consume
It's not simply a question of differing views
Forget emotions, this is fact, what I spit is the truth
Makes no difference if you're a Christian or if you're a Jew
They are just people living in different conditions to you
They still die when you bomb their schools, mosques and hospitals
It is not because of rockets, please god can you stop it all
I'm not related to the strangers on the TV
But I relate because those strangers could have been me
Words can never ever explain the raw tragedy
It's not a war they're just murdering more rapidly
We are automatically supporting pure savagery
Imagine how you'd feel if this was your family
[Hook A]
Free my people, long live Palestine
We will never let you go

[Hook B: Lowkey]
Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine
Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine
Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine
Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine

[Verse 2: Lowkey]
Palestine remains in my heart forever
We stand for peace, in times of war we shan't surrender
Remember, it didn't start in that dark December
Every coin is a bullet, if you're Mark's and Spencer
And when you're sipping Coca-Cola
That's another pistol in the holster of the soulless soldiers
You say you know about the Zionist lobby
But you put money in their pocket when you're buying their coffee
Talking about revolution, sitting in Starbucks
The fact is that's the type of thinking I can't trust
Let alone even start to respect
Before you talk learn the meaning of that scarf on your neck
Forget Nestlé
Obama promised Israel 30 billion over the next decade
They're trigger happy and they're crazy
Think about that when you're putting Huggies nappies on your baby
[Hook A]
Free my people, long live Palestine
We will never let you go

[Hook B: Lowkey]
Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine
Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine
Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine
Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine

[Verse 3: Lowkey]
This is not just a war over stolen land
Why do you think little boys are throwing stones at tanks?
We will never really know how many people are dead
They drop bombs on innocent girls while they sleep in their beds
Don't get offended by facts, just try and listen
Nothing is more anti-Semitic than Zionism
So please don't bring bad vibes when you speak to me
I know there's plenty of Rabbi's that agree with me
It's your choice what you do with this message
Don't get it confused; I view this from a truly human perspective
How many more resolutions have to be violated
How many more children have to be annihilated
Israel is a terror state, they're terrorists that terrorise
I testify, my television televised them telling lies
This is not a war, it is systematic genocide
But whatever they try, Palestine will never die
[Hook A]
Free my people, long live Palestine
We will never let you go

[Hook B: Lowkey]
Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine
Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine
Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine
Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine

This is for Palestine, Ramallah, West Bank, Gaza
This is for the child that is searching for the answer
I wish I could take your tears and replace them with laughter
Long live Palestine, long live Gaza
Palestine, Ramallah, West Bank, Gaza
This is for the child that is searching for an answer
I wish I could take your tears and replace them with laughter
Long live Palestine, long live Gaza"
Step by Step,Eyedea,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","(I got a little story I'm gonna tell y'all)
See it was September 1st, 1999, the day of my death
My back was on the cold concrete as I took my last breath
I saw my body laying on the ground as my soul hovered above me
Damn Eyedea, you was a good looking cat
But anyway, another day at eighteen years of age
Step into heaven's gate anxious to see what God got to say
Maybe he'll give me a gift for always saying my prayers
But he might send me downstairs for last year's love affair
Well, who cares
You know, right now it's all a mystery
I mean, I'll find out when I get there
Until then I can't let it get to me
I'm keeping my cool, besides, everybody dies
I'll just follow the white light like the do in the movies
It seems like hours went by and I'm still traveling right towards the brightness
Now this ain't heaven or hell, this realm is lifeless
And I hate to say it but this wild goose chase had me bored
No directions, no clues, and no *idea* what I was in for
But then forward I kept floating
And then a quick flash; the lights split directly in half
And created a forked path
Representing each side was an angel
""Now what's the task I have to untangle to meet the big man in charge?"" I ask
And the one on the right of me says
""One of us always lies, and the other one always tells the truth
Ask the right one the right question, and he'll direct you to heaven
But if you ask the wrong one son, farewell you're going straight to""
Well, y'all get the picture
The one on my left told me not to listen to his fibs
He said, ""it ain't that complicated to find out where God lives""
He told me to follow his path and tell God he said hi
Then the one on my right jumped in and told me not to believe his lies
And I'm like Jesus fucking Christ, I didn't care much for life
But I've tried to stay alive forever, if I knew this is what death was like
I was never good at problem solving, especially in emergencies
I get a tad bit nervous when concerned with burning for eternity
But anyways, I asked them which one lied, and they pointed at each other
And thinking I had it, I asked the name of my mother
One said he don't know, the other said he know but he can't tell me
Goddamn this is gonna be hard
So I asked like thirty questions and I still wasn't sure
But being me I got pissed and gave those pricks a few good words
Frustrated with it all
I turned my back to the angels and when I walked away
To my surprise
I found myself in heaven
Ya know I'm saying
Kinda just turned around from the whole situation
Rejecting everything that was going on
That's how I walked into heaven
I walked away, walked away, walked straight into heaven
I walked away, walked away, walked straight into heaven"
Fame,GZA,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
They was told not to ride in Patty's Hearse
And stay out of Charles' Mansion
Took Abraham's Lincoln through the Todd Bridges expansion
Willis Reeds a map that marks the spot showin
On his left George Burns a blunt William's Holdin
Tyra Banked the money that Chaka Khaned the poor
Alicia Keyed his car for givin Melba Moore
For the Redd Foxx who bought off the block, but though twice
As Debora Cox the gun cuz she beat Kelly's Price
When Rosa Parked the truck on the farm that Kim Fields
Linda Tripped for tryna to walk in Lauryn's Hills
Water dripped outta Farrah's Fawcett in the glass
She was ""Superfly"", Curtis Mayfield her ass
Chris Tucker to a show, Ted Turner to a ho
Robert Diggs the beat, but ain't feelin the flow
But he signed it fast, for half of Johnny's Cash
Nia Longed for the album to drop, cameras flashed
Tom Sawyer at the Lucielle Ball up at the foyer
He confronted Richard Pryor to hiring his lawyer
Suge's Knight removed the rook off the board
Don King was checked and Al Sharpton the sword
""Wettin cream, I ain't wettin fame""
""(Fame is the measure)
""Rap celebs""
""The place where stars are born""

[Verse 2]
The saints marched in, Kurtis Blowing his horn
Tom Cruised the boulevard, Chris Rocked the song
For the hundredth time, they pressed rewind to the beginning
They toast to the rhyme, the juice spilt from John's Lennon
They took her to Elizabeth Taylor to dry clean
The lone seamstress, who was schemin on Al's Green
You know they shoot for the stars and buckwild
Like the kids in the yard who play with Jane's Child
A beautician laced Erykah's Badu
Sean Combed through the evidence, just to get a clue
The needle in the haystack, from outta Eartha's Kitt
The Tiger would kill him once thrown in Brad's Pitt
Jesse Owen the money from the weed Bubba Sparxxx'd
They was journeys seen far as he walked in Dick's Clarks
Jeffery Lyons stuck with a thorn from George's Bush
Paul Pierced in the heart as the crowd pushed
Acting alone...Drew Barrymore bones
Of the victims, three blocks from Jim's Brownstone
They shared the same bowl, he caught Natalie's Coled
The producer, threw the butter on Esther's Rolle
Nipsey Russeled him down, got his jaw wide
In a instant, Brooke Shields him from the gunfire
Angie Stoned him to death, with those vocals
Keith Sweat from the workout, just from runnin local
"" Wettin cream, I ain't wettin fame ""
""Fame is the measure""
""Rap celebs""
""The place where stars are born""

[Verse 3]
Larry's Bird flew outta Nicolas Cage
Joe Tex messages from Satchel's Paige
Betty Wright letters with ink from Sean's Penn
Infinite bars, you couldn't tell where the song end
Glenn Close enough to quickly duck the tapes
Richard Gere ripped while he was climbin Bill Gates
He was a southerner, posing as a, native New Yorker
The Jason Kidd took his first steps in Jimmy's Walker
He stayed on line chattin with rap celebs
Used Bernie's Mack to search Veronica's Webb
It cost them their life for the advice you gave
Now Pete Rose lay on Vanessa's Redgrave

"" Wettin cream, I ain't wettin fame ""
""Fame is the measure""
""Rap celebs""

"" Wettin cream, I ain't wettin fame ""

Live in the Sky,T.I.,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'alternative']","[Intro: T.I.]
What's happenin', man? This TIP, you know?
I'd like to dedicate this song to anybody who done ever lost somebody
To the grave, to the streets, to the jail cell...
I done been in situations where I done had to cope with all three, you know what I'm sayin?
I feel the only thing I ain't done yet is die, you know?
But it ain't how I live while I'm here, it's how I live when I leave, ya dig?

[Chorus: (Jamie Foxx) & T.I.]
(Life's ups and downs, they come and go)
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die, that I live in the sky
(It's true what goes around, comes back you know)
So when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky

[Verse 1: T.I.]
My cousin Toot ain't have to die right in front of his son
And his wife, he lost his life struggling over a gun
Give a damn what he done, that's my muhfuckin' folk
And I love that nigga to death, no muhfuckin' joke
I can feel my eyes fillin', the Lord is my witness
If I catch him, I'ma kill him, I made it my business
Back in the day, you stayed in my business
Taught me I ain't have to incorporate yay in my business
Coincidentally, that's why today you not with me
My cousin died over some yay, and I miss him
Plus he at his family house, let's say she the eyewitness
But her boyfriend did the shootin', judge gave a life sentence
I heard that, now I'm dressed up in all black
Shot up the whole apartments, he still ain't brought back
The best friend I had in Tremell, I lost that
Guess your death was a lesson in life, it taught me that
[Chorus: (Jamie Foxx) & T.I.]
(Life's ups and downs, they come and go)
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die, that I live in the sky
(It's true what goes around, comes back you know)
So when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky

[Verse 2: T.I.]
You ever seen a nigga go to jail and sleep 'til day 2?
Well, that's how sick I was when Jay-Ru
Found out the hard way, that wasn't powder that they were tootin'
Overdosed on heron, died at 22
If you ain't heard about your daughter, she smile just like you
So cute, even resorts to violence like you
You know your baby momma loose, but ha, what can you do?
And I got four myself, yuh, it's been a few
Now everything I do is for King, Messiah, Deyjah, Domani
Tell the Lord they all I've got, so please don't take them from me
From me standin' in the trap, with carryin' this here cap
Laughin' at the niggas who serve with no strap
Tell them niggas, man, y'all trippin' with no maps
Get robbed and ask to borrow my pistol ain't gon' happ'
Me, you, the crew just fell out over dough and a lil crack
Never could apologize, you died, that's why they say that
[Chorus: (Jamie Foxx) & T.I.]
(Life's ups and downs, they come and go)
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die, that I live in the sky
(It's true what goes around, comes back you know)
So when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I bet you niggas think I'm livin' it up
Til you see polices laughin' as they pickin' me up
Went from seeing how many bitches I could fit in the truck
To three hots and a cot, is you kiddin' or what?
Fuck how many millions I got, nigga, so what if I'm hot?
When I got prices on my head, Feds rushin' my spot
A million haters want me dead, forced to carry a gat
""But you's a seven-time felon, what you doin' with that?""
It's a Catch-22, either you lose or you lose
That's the way the game structured, for real niggas to suffer
And I ain't never been a buster, always stood on my feet
Like a man prepared to take whatever coming for me
A pussy nigga or polices with a warrant for me
I'm a G, prepared to die for what's important to me
Look anybody in the eye who say he want it wit' me
Put up the house and bet the odds if it's comin' from me
OG's say I need to learn to be patient
You telling me with these seven years of probation
Pistol charges and a host of other open cases
If niggas only knew the kind of time I was facin'
I try to keep it to myself, but sometimes I couldn't take it
Got four kids, the smiles on they faces
Mean more to me than my crown and my bracelet
Take that away from me, and my life is butt naked
[Chorus: (Jamie Foxx) & T.I.]
(Life's ups and downs, they come and go)
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die, that I live in the sky
(It's true what goes around, comes back you know)
So when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky

Also my partner Bankhead, Man Lee Horton, what it is, nigga
P$C for life, and death
And my lil' homeboy Poncho, and my lil' homeboy Rico
I shed tears writin' this song, homeboy
That's real talk man
Ay, I wanna live in the sky
Let me live in the sky
Pray to God that I live in the sky

Ridin' in a Lamborghini, suicidal eagle wings

All my Carolina niggas man, (lights off and shit)
All my real niggas, no matter where you come from

[Verse]
A dolla and a dream, thats all a nigga got
So if its about that cream, then I'm all up in the spot
I was raised in the F-A-Y (why), a nigga never gave me nothing?
Pops left me, I ain't never cry, baby, fuck him, that's life
And trust me I'm living, look what a nigga made out
The shit that I was given, look what a nigga came out
Momma sewing patches on my holes
Man, our hoes couldn't put this flame out
Straight up, I got my back against the brick wall
I'm from a world where niggas never pop no Cristal, it was pistols
You pass through, you better pray them bullets missed y'all
I thank the Lord, He let a nigga make it this far
A lot niggas don't, a lot of moms weep
I gotta carry on, all the weight is on me
You never know when a nigga might try to harm me
Rest In Peace that nigga John Lee, I pour liquor, homie
It's foul, but yo the world keeps spinning
Gotta keep winning, get up off this cheap linen
Nigga I'mma eat, even if it means sinning
Niggas want beef, I'ma sink my teeth in 'em
Pause, I go harder, I am all about a dollar
You niggas street smart? I'm a motherfucking scholar
So trust me, I ain't stopping 'til my money is long
So much dough, them hoes will think I'm rocking money cologne
Have a model at the crib waiting, ""Honey, I'm home.""
Cooking greens for a nigga, give 'em plenty, a dome
It's funny, we dream about money so much its like we almost got it
Until we reach up in our pockets, its time to face reality
The ville is a trap nigga now
And if you ain't focused you gonna be here for awhile, yeah
My nigga Mike rolling with me, riding shotgun
Type a nigga know about every car, but don't got one
That's hunger, no wonder niggas fucking with the evils
Posted on the corner, selling crack like its legal
But who am I to judge how a nigga get his paper?
This money coming soon, dog, I'm tryna get my cake up
I guess I gotta wake up these niggas myself
An E&J sipper, but my shit is top shelf

Real niggas can relate
And Ville niggas can relate, man

What you know about your momma sewing patches on your holes, nigga?
I had the light blue jeans with the green patches, haha, oh shit

It was like the Sixes came out, the Jordan Sixes
Them shit was so fly man, I wanted them so bad
Darryl what up man?
My nigga Darryl had them shits on in class yo
I wanted that shit so bad
I begged my mom for that shit, you know
But she couldn't afford it, yo, she gave me
Got me some Reeboks black tops, ahaha
But that was all good tho, cuz uh
The year after that I had, I had some, some no name shits
Some all black shits, haha
Them shits had metal, metal shoelace buckles and shit, you know?
But you know back then niggas didn't
Niggas ain't even know he was broke man, no worries and shit
But uh, times have changed man, I got bills
My mom is in debt, what you know about that?
College loans and shit, nigga

10 Jail Commandments,Apoccalips,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Apocalipps, (Chuck D sample)]
(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine)
It's the 10 jail commandments
Get that package up, buy some stamps too
All my niggas in Austin County, word up
All them down state man
Man, fuck the legal age
All yall bout to come up North, listen

[Apocalipps]
Cause I been in this jail for years, I ran with some animals
There's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual
A step by step booklet for you to get
Your freedom back and not your date pushed back
Rule number one, you gotta keep some peeps by your side
If it's your mother or your sister, keep some fam by your side
Cause blood runs thicker then water, and that's a jewel
And if you fucked up in the town you better patch it up dude
Number two, You gotta utilize that time
Pick up a book and learn somethin, interact with your mind
What you gonna teach your seeds when you get to the town
How to curse and smoke top until your fingers get brown
Number three, everybody cool ain't your mans
Separate your comrades from dick-riders and fans
Number four, I know yall heard this before
If your fuckin a guy, Then your ass gone die
Then you see it all the time you think a dude is thorough
Then you catch em in the yard with a nigga that's named Cheryl
Number five, wear your helmet at all times
Niggas'll beat you in the head for days if you don't mind
Talkin bout how many spots he stuck, hoes he fucked
He locked for beatin women, you prolly in wit a duck
Number six, that goddamn tellin, dead it
You think I'ma forgive you for snitchin, shit forget it
Number seven, this rule is so underrated
Keep your mail and the next mans completely separated
Cause if you write my chick I ain't tryna listen
I'm in the staul while you shittin, ready to push your shit in
Number eight, don't wait for your mans to pop off
Waitin for your mans, you'll fuckin get your head popped off
Yo if you wait for help in jail you must be retarted
Yo when the drama comes nigga just finish it where it started
Number nine, get a fat girl by your side
When everybody bounce, big drawers gone hold shit down
Cause she fat and ugly and don't nobody want her
That's why you gotta write them letters, Keep tellin her that you love her
Number ten, your whole plan is to get out
Don't do nothin stupid and get maxed out
You can act like you gone die for that T.V
But you'll be chillin in the S block, bunkin with Anna Beasy
No doubt, study this shit, goddamnit
And rest in peace to Big, This is the 10 jail commandments
If you in Attica, Sing-Sing, or Clinton Annex
Then you can do time in any spot that's on this planet
Apocalipps, one love to my peeps in the pen
And my motto this time, is to never return again

Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to welcome to you
All the way from the slums of Shaolin
Special uninvited guests
Came in through the back door
Ladies and gentlemen, it's them!

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
Dance with the mantis, note the slim chances
Chant this anthem, swing like Pete Sampras
Taking it straight to Big Man On Campus
Brandish your weapon or get dropped to the canvas
Scandalous, made the metro panic
Cause static with or without the automatic
And while I'm at it, yo, you got cash, pass it
It's drastic, gotta send half to Dirty Bastard

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Ayo, ayo, waves is spinning, blades is spinning
Slay 'em in the eighth inning
Stay truck, god stay playing linen
Kill rap, observe the uptowns, ho, feel that
Mink jeans on, seen where the real at
2000 Zitos, moving with a ill ego
For real, for real, ill lines, ill people
Yo, bring it back, 9 more civilians
Pollying deals, monopoly and bills, y'all niggas lying
Caught 300, lab look royal wit a mean stomach
Go broke, all seen, done it
Words from the heavy set, if I don't eat
Then we already met fly-ass bro, liver than coke
[Verse 3: Method Man]
Now what Clan you know with lines this ill?
Bust shots at Big Ben like we got time to kill
Niggas can't gel or I'm just too high to tell
Put on my gasoline boots and walk through Hell
With 9 generals, 9 ninjas in your video
9 milli blow, semi-auto with no serial
Man metaphysical, I speak for criminals
Who don't pay they bills on time and fuck with digital
Never seen, smoke a bag of evergreen
My sword got a Jones, more heads for the severing
Johnny in the dungeon, taking all bets, throw ya ones in
Scared money don't make money, throw ya guns in

[Verse 4: Masta Killa]
That's word to Damo, San Juan, Puerto Rico
Blowin hydro on a beach wit Tamiko
My gun bullet hollow for you to swallow
Blowin' the nozzle, hear it whistle
One in the head, this is code red, man for dead
X amount of lead spray from the barrel
Heat clear the street like Connor O'Carroll
Fully equipped, rifles, banana clip shit
To make my niggas from East New York flip

[Verse 5: RZA]
Yo, you may catch me in a pair of Polo Skipperys, matching cap
Razor blades in my gums (BOBBY!)
You may catch me in yellow Havana Joe's goose jumper
And my phaser off stun (BOBBY!)
Y'all might just catch me in the park playin' chess, studyin' math
Signin 7 and a Sun (BOBBY!)
But you won't catch me without the ratchet, in the joint
Smoked out, dead broke or off point (BOBBY!)
[Verse 6: Ghostface Killah]
Wallo's comfortable, chocolate frosting
Your socks hangin' out, yours is talkin'
Rock so steadily, son, I'm still crazy
Sport my old Force MD furs from the 80's
Nat Turners wit burners, Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Taught y'all niggas how to rap, reimburse me
Rothsdale's, ruby red sales, Bloomingdale's, blocks
Ox tails chopped up in Caribbean spots
I'm nice, maxed out, creepin' wit the ax out
Murder these bikini bitches, switchin' with their backs out

[Verse 7: U-God]
Niggas wanna pop shit, I pop clips
Bitch, I'll put my dick on ya lips
Alabama split, hammer slay quick
That David Banner gamma ray shit
Shells in the mouth, jailhouse snitch
My powder voice, Snow White sniff
Verbal killas, gorilla grip
God body shit, puff Marley spliffs

[Verse 8: Cappadonna]
You might see me in a 6, that's not my style
You might see me wit a bitch, that's not my child
I be in the benzo, keep a low profile
Dead serious, take flicks and don't smile
Tryna get money, y'all cats is wild
I pose for the clothes, make a song like wild
I'm a chip off the board game, got sword game
Live life to the fullest, still want more fame
Darts on layaway, beats on standby
Outfits pressed up, ready for airtime
[Verse 9: GZA]
Run on the track like Jesse Owens
Broke the record flowing without any knowing
That my wordplay run the 400 meter relay
It's on once I grab the baton from the DJ
A athlete wit his iron cleat in the ground
Wireless nigga who sprint off the gun sound
The best time yet still 7.0
Swift flow made the cameramen clothes blow"

That goes for all those who pose like Spence Pratt
Whacks that can’t rap but they think they're the shit
When I’m hangin' out in Vegas, makin' out with ya sis
Ahh, fuck reality shows, it's sad to see the tragedy reality shows
Reality that rap ain't goin' platinum no mo'
So I have to find an avenue with rapping befo'
I got a warm fuzzy feelin when I'm flappin' the flow
Started with some cold chillin' and a tap of a toe
Now they tappin' my phone because Im rackin' up dough
And now that Asher is a factor they be at my back-do' (oh)
Dialogue with Viacom, playing X-Box with Megan Fox
Call of duty I fire bomb entire squads, R’s and Uzi’s
Riots on insider wars, beyond movies, (?)
I’d rather lose than fire shots, I power this youth
Who’d rather shoot than try and talk and get to the truth
You know I'm rooting my troops to keep trouping
We start a revolution simply through good music
Get used to it dufus and do new shit
You Reese Witherspoons is clueless
Oh shit
I’m silver stoned excuse me
Keep getting loose and syracuse is so soothing
But don’t confuse me, my jersey still say A. Roth
Or AKA ""Never Take A Day Off""
Since Bernie Madoff, the banks would pay off
Our friends and our fans are the ones that's laid off
It's work, and no play, salad, and no steak
75 days straight with no (break!)
Ahh, pysche
I be chillin' be watchin' Ellen feedin' little kids lemons watch their face start swelling, up
Suck it up, pucker up, buttercup, when enough is enough, nip tuck it in the butt
Cause our asses are assets
Ash is invested in masses of massive, ashes to ashes
Ash is the master of ceremony no lonely island phony flowin' though I’m on a boat (mothafucka!)
In north cadillac, on the fourth hour shaft
My boy drinks Cris champagne off'a ass
I just laugh cause that’s actually true
You don’t believe that? Check it out on Youtube
Point a cam in the hand see the man Brain Bang
Check the rex in the decks while he chase after sex
This ones for Funk Flex, and the ""Greenhouse Effect: Volume 2"" is the truth
Got my penis erect

Now the world wanna see my story all on camera
That’s magic, described by a hater, that’s tragic
Billy Shakespeare was in his grave doin backspins
The attractive power of every verse was so intense the ladies required napkins
The credits rolled: below average seemed lavish garbage ass rappers
With a gaudy no class chain and a fitted turned backwards
Black on black anti semite rap wazyap
I’m out that Nolia So niggas’ll surely clap if I ask em
Whip a nigga out his clothes from Freret to Jackson
Nobody’ll ever wonder or talk about what happened
C’mon son, who better than us? Them?
They ain’t even figure out they own style yet man
And every rhyme I ever spit out my face was spotless
Any bitch I ever said strip to got topless
Any click whoever said shit they got rocked

The black Gods free up, the Land erupt

Oh I get it, niggas wanna hear me spit it
But I never take shots without establishing pivots
Itsy bitsy spider climbing up the water spout
Moses with his rod hit the staff and got the water out
Powerful parables
I learned from the lips of my uncle Charles comin outta the VA like Clipse
Now there’s a whole wealth to dig thru
But yo shit it’s too shallow for me to dig you

Make yourself at home
We got diesel or some of that homegrown
Sit back in your throne and turn off your phone 'cause this is our zone
Videos, televisions
64s, PlayStations
Weigh up Henry with precision
Few herbs and a bit of Benson
But don't forget the Rizla
Lean like the Tower of Pisa
These are our ways, yeah
And this is the day in the life of a geezer
For this ain't a club track
Pull out your sack and sit back
Whether you white or black
Smoke weed, chase brown, or toot rock
We're on a mission, support the cause
Sign a petition, summon all your wisdom
The music's a gift from
The man on high, the Lord, and his children
Triple team here of rude boys
Come rain or snow, the boodah flows
You don't know? Stand on the corner, watch the show 'cause life moves slow
Sort your shit out, then roll
Sex, drugs, and on the dole
Some men rise, some men fall

Stop dreaming, my data's streaming
I'm giving your bird them feelings
Touch your toes, then touch the ceiling
We walk the tightrope of street cred
Keep my dogs fed, all jungle, all garage heads
Gold teeth, Valentinos, and dreads now
We were verbally slapped up
Physically tip-top, spinally ripped up
I do the science on my laptop
And I get my boys mashed up
You're listening to The Streets
You'll bear witness to some amazing feats
Bravery in the face of defeat
All line up and grab your seat

My Underground train runs from Mile End to Ealing, from Brixton to Bounds Green
My spitting's dirty, my beats are clean
So smoke weed and be lean
I step out my yard through the streets
In the dead heat, all I got's my spirit and my beats
I play fair, don't cheat, and keep the gangsters sweet
Turn the page, don't rip it out at your age, move to the next stage
Lock the rage inside the cage, like SK, it's a new day
But don't take the shortcut through the subway
It's pay or play, these geezers walk the gang way
Deep-seated urban decay, deep-seated urban decay
Rip down posters I like from last week's big garage night
And the next Tyson fight
I cook 'em at ninety degrees Fahrenheit and don't copy the copyright
I got 'em in my sights
Blinding with the lights, taken to dizzy new heights
Blinding with the lights, blinding with the lights
Dizzy new heights

Fifteen dollar necklace looking ethnic
More hippie groupies than Arrested Development

Man, don't you know that I'm loco?
Mhm, hm

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I was chillin' (Chillin') right around my way (Way)
21st, east side of the Beach
This motherfucker ran up on me
Talkin' shit with his homies like he was a straight G
Askin' where I'm from while he runnin' up
Gangbang my set on e'ry one of 'em (20's, nigga, 20's)
Some things, sons, they just won't change
Fools don't respect nuttin' but the gangbang (Bang)
What's seen is what's saw, Dogg is the law
I have you niggas runnin' like a marathon
Lil' G's tryna creep on the East with it
Talkin' 'bout they gon' get my chain and they gon' leave with it (Mm)
But they don't know once they get close
It's tic-tac-toe, three motherfuckers laid on the floor (Watch out)
Yeah, this happened yesterday
On the West they spray, I heard a ese say, he said
[Chorus: B-Real & Snoop Dogg]
Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw this pack of guys and they act real hard (And what they do?)
They twist their fingers, say, ""You know who we are""
He said, ""I don't give a fuck, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg"" (Uh-huh)
They keep talkin' and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car (And what he get?)
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firing and then he just charged

[Post-Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
(Blaow) Run nigga, run nigga
(Blaow) Duck nigga, duck nigga
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I didn't mean to hit what I hit
Now there's three motherfuckers dead and I ain't seen shit
But these niggas'll scream for plea
But for a G like me, it's just a case, really, you could see
I crack the MAC back and pop off rollin'
And smack ya neck back, ya drop off, fallin'
I haven't seen my mama in a week
And she ain't even ran her mouth about me
Fuck that, I ain't give a fuck about the law
Niggas say they wanna brawl, you would think that they were broads
Believin' all the things that you never saw
In it, y'all, been a Dogg, smoke you like a Menthol
You think you know? But this can't go
You think you'll blow on my dope? What the fuck? No
See these niggas proceed with speed
So feel the need to bleed, all you hear my enemies goin'

I wouldn't be the nigga that I am
If I didn't pop niggas in they mouth, goddamn
And Snoop'll keep one foot on the streets
And leave 'em covered in sheets, run with them niggas with the heat (Heat)
You never seen a thug like this
You never seen a dub like me
And I ain't weak for wanting peace
In fact, I could be ""Beast of the East"", motherfucker
I never hesitate to blaze (Blaze)
A nigga really tryna change his ways
We gotta move my team, 'cause my peoples
Is screamin' that we need more for fun or it's illegal
Ba-ba-bang on a song, make it feel like a drive-by (Drive-by)
It's a shame, but somebody gotta die (Die)
They see it happen state-to-state
But when I'm mobbin' L.A., all I hear the eses say, they go

What It Is,Pharoahe Monch,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
As we move forward towards the new millennium
We will no longer communicate with vocal inflections
It will be necessary to communicate through telekinesis
We will open your mind and concentrate harder
Focus, focus, focus, focus
Hey, brother, what it is?

[Verse 1]
Raps like Star Wars, only the stars die, it's no sequels
Beat three cases, see three POs
Before Morpheus and Neo was killing 'em
We was ducking bullets in the hood like Remo Williams
Understand the underground Dom sipper
Take it serious or die laughin' like John Ritter
Young Eastwood, just trying to eat good
Breathe easy, relax, mack like Fleetwood
Keep snoring, keep sleeping, I'll keep touring
Come back, lay in the cut like Neosporin
Came out of the fallopian blasting
Pharoahe hungrier than Ethiopians fasting
Flies all in my teeth, stomach sticking out
Niggas want dibs on the weed but ain't kicking out
See, this is not American Idol
This is me trying to eat, human survival
Spit at your favorite rapper, take his title
Stick needles in his eyeballs 'til his signs are no longer vital
This ain't that, I'm not them
These ain't those rhymes, I'm not him
This is more like cocaine all night
Shine like the new five halogen foglights
No, more like sunshine
And one line of mine'll remind you of when you were nine
Before you were busting cherries, it wasn't necessary to grind then
Now we all on our grizzly
And you got the nerve to press Frisbees
What it is
[Chorus]
What it is, what it is, what it is, what it is
What it is, what it is, what it is, what it is
What it is, what it is, what it is, what it is
What it is, what it is, what it is, what it is

[Verse 2]
If I'm not home on the range, catch me at the range
Practicing my aim, catch you in your brain
Shame, they thought I was backpack
Slept, didn't know that he kept inside the knapsack
Today's niggas do skate-by hits
Run in your crib on some Queer Eye For The Straight Guy shit
But not homosexuals, they mastering gunplay
Rearrange your furniture, fix your feng shui
They be swearing it's cute
But I be up in the club, box-cutter in the boot
With the sex appeal and no ice either
The right to bear arms, I'm not talking wife-beaters either
When they see me they say, ""That's that nigga""
My last name should be 'That's That Nigga'
Sounds kinda nice, 'Pharoahe That's That...'
Never catch me with them plastic half-ass niggas
With the flow that's so influential
Niggas fucked up, they get no instrumentals now
Next time you spitting on mine
Bet your bottom dollar you be spitting over rhymes
What it is
[Chorus]
What it is, what it is, what it is, what it is
What it is, what it is, what it is, what it is
What it is, what it is, what it is, what it is

Next stop, start trouble inside the waffle house
Mmm, click the nine, yup skip the line
Looked at home boy yo, your bitch is mine
Had a little knife, tried to flick his shine
Had a big gat, click clack, hit recline
Don't ever complain, over no dumb dame
See you big money, I'll turn 'em to chump change
Let my muscles show, cause I'm like Russell Crowe
Beautiful mind, took his bitch, hustle ho

Get with me physically, mentally, literally

They apply the appliances the wrench-men

Ready rock, kill a cop, steady b
Stay steady please, say I bet he squeeze
I ain't on it tonight, I need head for sheez
I don't care if you're Japanese, Lebanese
Chinese, Siamese, just be from the seven seas
I was wrappin' a L, I got trapped in a smell
Perfume, bag, hat, all matchin Chanel
Ohh you a baller boo, how tall are you
5'6"" 150, I need all of you
She had a candy chocha, ""como te llamas?"" ""Rosa""

You fucked up now nigga

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
You know that when that time comes and nobody is checkin'
And everything you had is gone in the split of a second
That's when it starts hittin' the fan and it gets real in this bitch
Just face the fact your shit's a wrap and you gotta deal with the shit
Despite I talk about it, I ain't makin' fun of them niggas
I give thanks cause I've been blessed and I ain't one of them niggas
Can't imagine how difficult it is, I know you suspect
That shit around you is lookin' dumb, it's gettin' hard to accept it
Alone in the mirror, you look at yourself and you smile
Disregarding the fact your running's been done for a while
Refuse to acknowledge the truth like the mind of a child
Continue frontin', like it's nothin while you live in denial
While all your people around you start to leave you in the same place
You overexert the little you have left to save face
You tryin' to hide your expression from lookin' worried
On what to do when your career is buried

Do you ever think (do you ever think)
What life would be (what life would be)

Niggas ain't givin' a fuck about your flows no more
You ain't the star you were, fuckin' the same hoes no more
Promoters ain't payin' and bookin' you for shows no more
You ain't whippin' the Range, you ain't whippin' a Rolls no more
Reality starts to settle in, you're sweatin' every wake up
You're broke and now you gotta return your jewelry to Jacob
You run around and you front like you're still on fire
But nobody believes you; and now you live as a liar
You're only lyin to yourself cause it's evident in the proof
As your world continues to crumble, come to terms with the truth
You're still holdin on to them days when everything was about you
But niggas don't even remember you enough to just shout you
I remember when you did your thing without a doubt tastefully
The problem was you didn't know when to bow out gracefully
Once told, never burn out, it's best to fade away
Preserve your value so that you can live to see a greater day
People see you and it's bugged that you mean nothin'
You doin' shit and front to prove to people you mean somethin'
It happens in the vicious when the truth starts to settle in
You step to the door of the club and see that you ain't gettin' in
Forgettin' you a man first, chasin the fame
Got to remember, morals and principles, reppin' your name proper
But most niggas don't, and they whole life hurried
What do you do when your career is buried
[Hook: Truth Hurts]
Do you ever think (do you ever think)
What life would be (what life would be)
Where you will go (where you will go)
After you die (after you die)
Do you ever think (do you ever think)
What life would be (what life would be)
Where you will go (where you will go)

I'm just foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around (Aight, look, haha)

[Verse 2]
Look when I come around and spit that flow (Uh-huh)
Three in a row, no Tic-tac-toe
Hit that Dro, get so blowed
Hold up, let's spit that slow, ooh, I'm high ([?])
Y'all hatin', you gon' stop, I'm comin' to your block
Still hear my music knock (Aha)
Gon' take this to the top, I want the top spot (What?)
Spittin' them pop rocks (Uh-huh), the human talk box
I'm top notch and you ain't got a fan yet
Watch me blow they minds with some bars, call me Xanax
I ain't even goin' hard, told you my flow is sharp
And when the Dro is sparked, sittin' back: Rosa Parks
Don't call me lazy, I ain't just some bum kid
But I can bust wigs with every single drum kit
I like to joke a lot, I'm [?] I'm not
My moms is walkin' in the room like, ""Are you smokin' pot?""
Blow the smoke out like, ""Yes, I am""
So can I mothafuckin' kick this? (Yes, you can)
[Chorus]
Rise and grind, tryna get this money right
'Cause life's a joke, I'm the funny type
So I'm foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around
I'm just foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around
Rise and grind, tryna get this money right
'Cause life's a joke, I'm the funny type
So I'm foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around
I'm just foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around"
Drama,Tory Lanez,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Strugglin', lil niggas is hustlin'
Cops with the K-9 dogs they never muzzlin'
Buttons on apartment floors that we be buzzin' in
Theres something real, someone in trouble and all the youngin' em
I'd kill for my youning' em, feel for the youngin' em
Tryin' to make a mill, to make a meal for my youngin' em
Something I'm discoverin', when we start to love again
That'll be the day we get some peace
But other than that there'll be niggas in the streets
Mad when it's the winter and niggas can't afford heat
When the baby want jordan's but daddy can't afford sneaks
Like whats more important, a pair of J's or the feast
He look at his girl, he gotta provide
It's cold in the house, it's hot outside
And I don't mean that in a weather sense
There's stupid niggas on the premises
Brothers tryin' to be hard headed and so they hella dense
4 year murder still nobody found no evidence
Gotta live your life cause all that other shit irrelevant
Caught up in the light will take your breath up out your ???????
I read about this way back, back in genesis
This is for the mothers holding baby's in they stomachs
Going crazy cause their lover is never there, and rubbers were never there
When lusting you never cared, you frontin'
You just cared about a nut or something
Well something up in your mind was tellin' you don't do it, its too soon
Now you got a little daughter she'll be 2 soon
Plus a son up in your stomach he'll be due in June
And that father try to visit in a blue moon
Its safety still, life ain't a game its real
From the finch to the jane get filled
To the park and the scarbs all the way through steels
Lifes hard, sometimes the cut it might scar
If you live past 18 years your lifes long
Thank god for livin', them bad times we livin' em'
Prayin' that the youth gets baptised I'm serious
Niggas stop selling them cap size, get serious
Need to stop tryna be that guy cause really it
Really ain't worth your soul, ain't worth parole or probation
Life gets more crazy, gotta keep fighting guarantee your gon' make it
Times it will get so deep you can't take it
God gotta be the only one you leave your faith with
Safe it, sacred, place in the safe or the basement
If something worth chasing then chase it
This a serious thing, nothing to play games with
Can't trust friends, some friends will bring hatred
Its safe to say it nigga, its so blatant but God gotta be the only one to leave your faith with"
Rap n Roll,Benjy,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","(Chorus: Sarah)
I've been waiting all my life for it
I bet that anyone here would die for
So now I got it all right
We can party all night
Have a hell of a life
//
Don't stop what you're doing
Get up and start moving
Now that I got it all down
Know you want it all now
Turn this party around
(Verse 1:)
Hey it's Benjy ready to rap and roll
Let's get this show on the road, take this outa control
I know that you know how this rap's gonna go
It's 'bout the flow, 'bout the show
Don't give a damn about the gold
Yeah, see happiness is all that matters you know
So if you're mad at the flow
Nothin' good will happen to y'all
Lighten up, let that s**t go
If you have to know
I can tell you after all
In the end, no one will be laughing at all
But I will be laughing at y'all
Thinking bout how happy it'd go
If you chose to sniff the roses
Blow this I know you know this
My flows the coldest now hold it
Like you're supposed to
Uh, yeah
[Hook]
(Verse 2:)
I just can't be stopped 'cuz I'm a real MC
You fakes will never ever be as real as me
Still I guess there are some legends that just can't be beat
Like Snoopie, 2Pac, and the real Biggie
And then there's Big's brother and his name Jay-Z
Yeah them Carters got them Lollipops like Lil Weezy
I could wear the shutter shades like Kanyeezy
Autotune and vocoder's a Pain, like T
But autotune got murdered in The Blueprint 3
What happened to hip-hop, man is it just me?
Music not going like it's supposed to be
Rap's getting distant but I need the music close to me
Ya see?
I'm just a kid man singing from his heart
But it gets tricky though, I don't know where to start
But I know it's an art
Ain't just a scam
It's a piece of work man
This game I used to like it but I'm loving it tonight
Having good times what I do best, damn right
I don't love myself, I love the life
I love what I do all day and night
But the good life is only half the story
The real stuff's hard man, the truth is gory
Some of it's just paperwork, that stuff's boring
The other things are things that I try to ignore
Cuz shooting for the stars ain't about cars and money
It ain't about your homies and it ain't about your honey
What the radio wants me to be is not who I am
Cuz I am real, I'm not fake or some kind of cash scam
[Hook]
(Verse 3:)
I got the music
I gotta use it or lose it
You too, you gotta choose it
Or choose to snooze through it
No hesitation I go like Nike ""Just Do It""
When it get hard, I ain't quittin' man, screw it
I do what I gotta do to pull my self through and get through it
When it gets old, I just keep renewing and renewing
Make sure my s**t never get overdo its always new
And I keep losing but I know that I'll be happy when I do win
Roll like a rolling stone gotta keep moving
Stuck on this like tape but it don't work unless you glue it
Can't let it end so soon can't let my rap life go to ruin
That's it, enough lying someone tell me what the truth it
Let's do this

Ill Be There,Mac Miller,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: Phonte & Mac Miller]
Sunshine or rain (Uh-huh, like), I'll be there (I know you feel me)
For the good times or bad, I'll be there (I'll be there)
Sunshine or rain (Uh-huh), I'll be there (That's how it's always gon' be)
For the good times or bad (That's how it's always gon' be), I'll be there

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Hey, hey
See, I was six years old with a dream
When my moms told me I could do anything
Said she'd be there forever, no matter what's the weather
She'd always have my back even when we weren't together
And I took her for granted, thought I had a plan
This a different generation, I don't think you'd understand
In the quest to be a man, you start to learn you need your family
It wasn't for them, I'd be way closer to insanity
It ain't about the vanity, think about what's important
The reason I was six years old rockin' some Jordans
The reason I had food, my own damn room
A TV in the livin' room to watch my cartoons
I just hope she know I love her, the world's best mother
Yeah, it ain't fair, so I'ma take care of her in her gray hair
When I get rich, I'll have her livin' like she should be
No stress, no worries, you can call me 'cause it's...

For the good times or bad (That's how it's always gon' be), I'll be there

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Hey, hey, hey
Dear momma, please don't start to cry
You the reason I'm alive, how these years have gone by
You were there when I was on my first bike ride
Ridin' in the street and that delivery truck almost ran right over me
You were at my games when I was sittin' on the bench
And when I skipped school, you lie and say that I was home sick
Had my back before I had my own
I know I'm always welcome when I'm back at home
I just want to bring you out on stage to get a standin' ovation
All the work you did to make my life feel like a vacation
If you have your moms, you better treat her right
Call her up, say ""Wassup?"" before you sleep tonight
Tell her you love her and thank her for what she did
You may be grown now, but remember bein' a kid
When she fed you in a bib, shit, you were her baby
So find out what she doin' lately
Uh, I wanna tell you, momma…
[Chorus: Phonte & Mac Miller]
Sunshine or rain, I'll be there
For the good times or bad, I'll be there (I know you feel me)
Sunshine or rain, I'll be there

For the good times or bad, I'll be there

Blowing smoke into the face of those haters mane
We all stars in the hood like Chuck Taylors mane
So throw it up and keep repping the Taylor gang, if you Taylor made...

[Game Verse]
I wake up in the morning to Red Converse
Dre Beats on, listening to Bomb first
You got a hangover nigga, mine’s worse...
Haze got me kicking knowledge like a Nas verse
Shit be complicated like out of towners trying to understand why we say: ""Whaddup Blood"" but we not related
That's how Compton made it
So don’t run around yelling Soo Woo without a Chuck Taylor confirmation
On that documentary shit I shocked the nation
Muhammad Ali shit like I boxed in Vegas
When it come to beef shit, nigga I’m the greatest
I knew I was next the night they shot 'Pac in Vegas
I ain't a killer but don’t push me
I see a bitch looking, I’mma end up in her pussy
See ya later, fuck haters, cause bitch we Taylors
Bitch we major...

[Wiz Khalifa Verse]
Probably heard I’m the tightest
And I heard that you never smoked so I rolled it, you light it
And I heard that you liked it
And I welcome you to my world you’ve been cordially invited
Now I got the whole world excited
Know every word when they heard that I write it
Know I can fuck every girl cause my jewelry the brightest
And my herb is the lightest
Some niggas mad I made it, blame it all on perfect timing
I say I made it big cause I stuck to the cursive writing
These niggas rather be a has-been
Then not be famous at all
I learned you ain’t really gotta be famous to ball
I’m hustling hard, and turning bitches to customers
Soon as they get in front of us
Bad hoes after the shows rushing up
Baby them niggas clowns talk down but they look up to us
May look the same but I’m nothing like them suckas so fuck what them niggas sayin’ and keep reppin’ the Gang...

Holla at 'em!

Before I
Take another minute just to give everybody a movie never seen
I hit 'em with another (Elbow)
Let me get up everybody that be moving with (The Conglomerate)
On your marks, are you ready? (Let’s go)
Wow! OK, here we go again you see the way I'm blowin'
And I’m like a mangler the way I be manglin' the beat
They call me Dracula then you see the fangs goin' in
Wow! Uh huh, everybody know that I'mma come and I'mma go
Then I gotta do what I be coming in to do it
Embody the beat, they love the way we givin' 'em a show
Keys to the ignition and step on the gas (Let's go)
And bust a bottle and pour me shot in my glass (Let's go)
Where we at? Where we at? Where we at?
And we back up in the building and we coming with a scorcher
Y'all already know who it is, it's Busta Bust and Travis Barker
Back to the beat, see we gotta go
Hit you with the fire trucks, everybody better know
That we 'bout to let it blow and we gotta get it yo
Everybody if you're really with me

[Verse 2: Twista]
I already spit it to the rhythm of the piano
So now I gotta give the drummer some
Put the T up on the track, I be phenomenal
'Cause when it come to havin' a hit I'mma make another one
Blink 182 times when you see the Twista with Travis, madness
Kind of like a savage, ravager
Murder with the art like blood on the canvas and it's
Kind of impeccable how I can spit it and get up
In the middle with intricate patterns of a kick drum
Diabolical, the lyrical flow that'll swallow you
Theoretical thinking that you can get some
I'mma hit 'em with the Lamborghini flow with the speed of a Bugatti (Let's go)
I'm from another planet when I spit a verse
With the weed in my body, and I'mma (Let's go)
Hurt 'em every time I get up in the booth
Sipping on the liquor, 182 proof
Now they wanna say they should've never let me loose
Out of the cage, now come and see what I'mma do
It's Twista the Jason of rap on the track
And I hit you with the Midwest flow
Even if you ain't ready yet, all I gotta say is ready, set

Hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
Drive by, hit you with the two piece combo
While I'm hangin' out the window of your Daddy's Lambo
Scrambled eggs, I got scrambled ammo
Leave you on top of the water like a banana boat
Yeah, I'm an animal, everybody's edible and Yelawolf
Is headed for your arm and hand and your - head, I'm a cannibal
Good heavens, the man's hoppin' over the fence like a fucking antelope
Sooo, send it to me in a minute when you finish and I'll put him in a vice grip
I put an end to the image and
I'll send it to them via independent fucker with the mic grille
I might scare bam
Pull the trigger back in a submarine with submachine loaded
In an ocean, high deep
Deep enough to leave the submarine imploded
Promenade motherfucker, vamanos
It's me and I'm sick of the pro-gnosis
Got more bars than Barney Fife
And I'll put you behind them like howdy Opie
I can make your mamma really proud to know me
And your broke daddy is down to loan me
Give me fifty bucks in penny rolls just to be in one of my videos
Yeah homie, let's go

No jewels, niggas say I got robbed

And fuck first class, I fly standin on Virgin America's wing
Nuts hang, knockin down skyscrapers

Make it rain, I ain't Pacman Jones
Nigga, balls and my word all a black man owns

If you in that man's zone, how you figure to gain?
Can't bowl a 300 in another nigga lane
Better aim, you dealin with a 7-10 split

I've been nice since ""227"" man, shit
I am sick and I'm never gettin better, that's it

Don't check the internet, check hood space
You dealin with some intelligent creatures
I don't touch guns, I draw with telekinesis
No fingerprints on Crooked's mag

To my wrist and it twists like a spliff when I'm sittin in the park
Tall corny niggas ain't makin a bigger mark

You guppies unlucky, you in a tank with a shark
Teeth crooked like my dog who just finished a vicious bark

They call me Hustler because my mag game heinous
Show up to Detroit thinkin (Everybody Love) you

I get Alzheimer's listen to your biblical writers
And biters to fibbers like your motion picture script writers
Should I be pausin for a moment over lost sinners
Or givin chase toward the invisible tormentor
Who - permitted more false allegations than a forfeiter
Don't get it wrong, cause existin manuscripts differ
Ghostly disappeared into the mountainside
Then reappeared to heap fear to keep the average rapper circumcised
How could this deal even commence nice
When my rhymes just to keep a cent, higher than yo' list price
A proefficient, most extravagant rapper imaginable and different
Still A&R's haven't listened and they're slow pokes
With audacity to be rhymin with these grown folks?
Y'all newcomes got jokes
Be polite, I was, I'm representin Bronx niggas that's inspirers
Now competition seems quieter
Forget the clues, I got critics sayin who's you?
Even rappers singin the blues if they ain't on they P's and Q's

Hey, everything good right now
Little bit of molly make the boy bite down
Thinkin' I could finally figure out my style on the stage
Lookin' at a big hype crowd
(They go insane when I run out on the stage)
'Cause we don't give a fuck, don't need to act our age, hey
When I'm old, I'ma spend my days
Layin' with my girl on the beach in the shade
Have every single thing I can name
Thank God everyday I don't sleep in the rain
Blessed with some success, so I'ma try my best to
Live my life right, when I see God, he'll be impressed 'cause
I've been on my grind, thinkin' I'll be fine if I take my time
Workin' so hard, might break my spine
So all y'all see this face of mine
There's different ways to shine, I'ma find my own
Know when I disappear, I'ma find my way back home 'cause...

Days go by, and I think that I
May be goin' crazy, maybe lose my mind
Lookin' at a constellation
Me and God have a conversation
God and I, sorry about the lingo
Just kick it in the cut, playin' bingo
I be all over the beat like Ringo
Look sweet, honey bee gonna sting though
I'm here, wanna do my thing
You can roll no matter who you bring
Like your wifey wanna lose that ring
I don't pay her no mind
I just want, I just want, I just want the paper
Bring the game, just a little more flavor
Say, ""What up?"", take a flick with a hater
Throw a deuce like, ""See you later""
Ha, that's funny, all I really want is a little cash money
Then life gonna be so sweet
Nah, it ain't a hotel, ha-ha-ha
Yeah, nah, it ain't a hotel
I'm next, shh, don't tell, ha

I don't think they know it yet, but I do, I do

How everytime I drop an album one of my niggas get killed
Make a nigga wanna stop spittin’
Plus Interscope be bullshittin’ Scott Pippen
This is not livin’
Livin’ is when you working a 9-5
Liftin’ heavy ass boxes just to stay a-fucking-live
Nigga ain't got a car but he got drive
So he appreciate the rims sittin on his ride
The world going crazy, niggas going crazy
They say the Illuminati affiliated Jay-Z
I’m in this Mercedes seeing how L.A be
My life should be a movie shot by Martin Scorsese
Gun’s off safety niggas is Polamalu
The cops killed BIG and drove off in the Impala
And Pac did his just to get a couple dollars
Fuck rap, I shoulda took my black ass to college

So they doing homocide
Gotta take the stand tell the judge and jury their alibi
And they all racist so they giving boys 25
Stand up be a man, and stare straight into his momma eyes
And she still traumatised, her baby boy shot up
Kissed him on the forehead right before he got up
You shot him in the forehead twice before he got up
All over a bitch, nigga the devil wears Prada
Amber Rose wears nada
And thats how she should keep it

Only thing for sale is this Phantom
It’s Aftermath, thats why I rep the A like Atlanta

They say I look like Kanye or Wale in this Louis napsack
Rather be them than them dumb niggas fucking with Kat Stacks
I smoke kush to get my mind right
I used to listen to Nas to get my rhymes tight
I used to sell them dimes and keep my 9 tight
But now I’m fucking them dimes, but in hindsight
Almost turned on my family for the limelight
And I’mma go see God when the times right
They say the pearly gates white but my President black
My money green, the sky blue and that's where heaven is at
I don’t carry a gat, but my niggas do
It’s like my jumper is off, I let my niggas shoot
And don’t none of my niggas do
Take the time to listen
I’ll tell you what my niggas do
Scream ""Soo woo!"" while they dumping out of Bentley coupes
But I’m just tryna be a good nigga, master
And take this rap money and give this shit to the pastor"
American Rapstar,Big K.R.I.T.,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
An A&R once told me
“You can determine the worth of a song within 15 seconds of it playing”
With complete and utter lack of the fact
That it takes takes all 3 minutes and 40 seconds of a song
To comprehend what I’m saying
It ain't a single if it don’t fly
It ain't a hit if it don’t ride
Now he couldn’t tell me the components of a smash
But the ringtones were their all-time high
And a rappers only as big as his chain, the flashier the better

They say ""money make the world go round""
You never lost til you lose your crown
And they don’t love you till you’re under ground
Or when you’re maxing out your bank account
Yeah, you do it all just to live the life
Even if it means you don’t live it right
And even if it means you don’t survive the night
But if even if you do you won’t survive the hype

[Verse 1 - Big K.R.I.T]
Push it to the limit (Why?)
Just to get up high with a wood grain kitted?
Ride around town like I never lived in it
Gun in my dash, pray I never kill with it
I’m that real with it
Got my eyes on the prize
Bills still due, motherfuck 9-5
Searching for a freak that wanna fuck once or twice
Wanna buy a bottle but I ain't paid my tithes
This ain't no lie, I got a vision and a masterplan
To hit the block and blow up like a Taliban
I make it where the plane never have to land
I make it where them lames never stand a chance
Shit, you’ll never know, only time’ll tell
You either starve or you find the scale
You either buying or you tryna' sell
You either fall or you grind the rails

So watch me get it how I live
Waiting on my moment, screaming fuck how they feel
Dodging jail cells and them pigs down to kill
They shot Oscar Grant swear it gave a nigga chills
Lets keep it real, if you ain't looking keep your eyes closed
Will I pay what I owe? Only God knows
I ain't for sure, give me strength just to change what I can’t
And understand the difference between a nigga and the King that I am
Gotta keep ya finger on the trigger
Pac died, Biggie died, they ain't found a killer
Momma say she worried ’cause I rap about the Government
And how the Church caked other people out there struggling (its real though)
I just call it how it is, folk
I’m breathing for a reason, what you here for?
They got it where the villains who we cheer for
Cause they murdered all the heroes

Outta this world man, you wouldn't understand it (nope)

Broke telescopes like you could never find her (shine, shine)

Wild Wild Horses,Atmosphere,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
He knew he wasn't perfect
But he always did his best to try to get under the surface
Not a saint, not a serpent
He just wanted everyone to be impressed with him as a person
So when she came along with the sunbeam
Self-esteem stopped making nothing out of somethings
Leaving the scene was unseen, I mean
It was the first time he ever felt the need to keep the gun clean
Do the math, he knew he had to choose a path
Got to get that girl, got to make her laugh
Got to shake the past and move forwards
Got to make this last, it feels gorgeous
But she had a lover in the mid-west
Never figured out how to get him off her thick chest
Just like that, everything is gone
He didn't want to but he had to learn the words so he could sing along (Sing)

[Chorus]
Everything is all I have to give you
And I'm afraid it ain't enough
And you're not so young that you believe me
Just because I say it's love
And even if they come to steal you tomorrow
I'll know my smile was yours
Go ahead and chase your dreams and your freedom
Run, run wild wild horses
You can't tame these horses
You can't tame these horses, no
You can't tame these horses
You can't tame these horses
[Verse 2: Slug]
Sometimes it can be so nice, right?
Sometimes she feel herself turn into the wife type
And when it's dark, sometimes he's the nightlight
But most of the time she doesn't even feel lifelike
She got a man but he thinks he's a star
And it feels like she has to compete with the bar
She keeps up her guard but it seems so hard
Momma never told her she would see those scars
Every night he's out doing who knows whom
While she cries along like a new show tune
Last call past, is he coming home soon?
Or is he going to run away with the dish and the spoon?
She'll realize she don't want that clown
Leave those shoes at the lost and found
He won't catch on until she's not around
After somebody else already locked that down
(We sing)

[Chorus]
Everything is all I have to give you
And I'm afraid it ain't enough
And you're not so young that you believe me
Just because I say it's love
And even if they come to steal you tomorrow
I'll know my smile was yours
Go ahead and chase your dreams and your freedom
Run, run wild wild horses
You can't tame these horses
You can't tame these horses, no
You can't tame these horses
You can't tame these horses
[Verse 3]
He didn't want her to see him leave
And he couldn't keep sitting there watching her sleep
'Cause he knows if he hangs out for a few hours
He'll dig another hole trying to plant some new flowers
But the sun don't shine under the table
He's trying to hold his life together with staples
No investment 'cause he's incapable
And he's on the outro of being labeled available
The word on the street is his girl's coming back home
No more alone, no more sad poems
No after-bar calls to the cell phone
It's time to walk a new path and grow a backbone
Shoved into the big book of just friends
Wondering how he would look as a husband
And everyone of them he ever allowed to love him
Now watching from the crowd trying to be proud of him
(They sing)

[Chorus]
Everything is all I have to give you
And I'm afraid it ain't enough
And you're not so young that you believe me
Just because I say it's love
And even if they come to steal you tomorrow
I'll know my smile was yours
Go ahead and chase your dreams and your freedom
Run, run wild wild horses
You can't tame these horses
You can't tame these horses, no
You can't tame these horses
You can't tame these horses"

You shake your body ‘round, make a brother lose his mind
Off the books, count the hours, running overtime
Charlie hustle with a shuffle, yeah
Sold the grind to a greater cause, now sound the applause
Pin dropping silence steady when you when you entering
It’s not a science we applying, we just meant to win
Don’t be beleaguered, I am eager to earn a stripe
Toast a glass, approaching fast moments after midnight
You got that late night, go wherever it take right
Time and place for everything, tonight, we gonna make life
A little bit better than we ever dreamed of , Portland passing Pasadena
Partake in madness on a daily status, y’all never see us
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Outasight]
Talking-talking baby, what’s it-what’s it ever for?
They got the young folks trapped behind the trapped door
Whispering ambitions, roses through a cracked floor
Keep on going, keep on growing, who cares what they ask for?
A dollar and a dream, shorty bout to cash in
Turbulence on ascend, seatbelt fastened
They take a whole lot, give a little ration
Mama didn’t raise no sucker, fucker, Imma cash in
Little did you know before this song I was about to quit
But I’m back on-back on, light switch, morning, noon and night shift
Songs for life in the right pitch, turn your back and you might miss
All the action we can muster, busting up the pipes, shit

I Never Knew You,Cage,"['hip hop', 'alternative', 'r&b', 'pop', 'rock']","[Verse 1]
You’re always dying inside that much closer to home
On a crowded street corner surrounded by people all alone
Pain in the heart, rain in the dark, the wound is glum and bitter
She walks around the corners like she brought the sun with her
Then everything just brightened up, I couldn’t make this up
My fingers in my eyes as she walked by like I was waking up
In so many words, I couldn’t string a sentence together to bother her
I instantly forgot all my plans and started to follow her

[Chorus]
It’s like the sky opened and God handed you directly to me
I know it sounds crazy but so is life, I’m sinking
And feeling like your heart is beating solely for me

[Verse 2]
Your legs are long and toned, you must be walking home
I love the way your lips move when you’re talking on your phone
Intoxicating and truly you due, your impurities
Plague every thought of you while I’m trailing you like your security
Lost, we couldn’t know our paths would cross but time knew it
Feet sticking out the window, a opportunity climbing through it
Pain for sale, looking to find a new taker
Chance to speak blown, when you looked at me I looked in the newspaper
[Chorus]
Because the sky opened and God handed you directly to me
I know it sounds crazy but so is life, I’m sinking
And feeling like your heart is beating solely for me

[Verse 3]
I’m miles out of my way, creepy, I want more
Was gonna turn back but you stuck your key in your front door
I’m standing across the street, stars had aligned us to meet
Standing outside with your trash feeling incomplete
My finger aching for your doorbell like a random blog
Instead I lurk outside in the cold like an abandoned dog
Perish the thought, you should cherish the words that I got in my mouth
The only words that can truly explain how I got in your house

[Chorus]
Because the sky opened and God handed you directly to me
I know it sounds crazy but so is life, I’m sinking
And feeling like your heart is beating solely for me
Unlikely, impossible, I couldn’t dream to think it
There’s something happening between us you can’t deceive
I’m so in over my head I’ve learned to breathe in it
Your eyes are screaming and you’re saying ""no baby"" to me
If there was a way out I think you would’ve taken it
My hands and arms are the only way that you can leave
Face to face for the first time, you feel what I’m feeling
Selfishly no longer breathing because of me"
Go with the Flow,MF DOOM,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Enough is enough
Enough is enough
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, ho
Go with the flow
Ayo, I'd like to set this microphone 'fore I start right quick
Microphone check 2-2-1-2-1-2

[Verse 1]
Big up all the Monsta Island massive
And beware before I triple dare you like the last kid
Who asked me what we don't got that you got son
For one flow that's elementary, my dear Watson
Secondly, ever since I was little
Not so much to riddle, least rhyme to the syllable
Keep tracks that make a Arab thief clap
With no hands, I chopped these drums off Truly Yours, G. Rap
Actual fact, relax
In this land of lyrical loss, black, I'm not the cool Sleestak
The one who might stop and talk to you
Poison to few, niggas who be biting styles I'm like pork too
Ooh, what you got to lose? Let mud fly
When I got blues, I chew whole crews that's bud dry
So I ask why the styes from the cess
Shit be fucking with my eye as I pull it to the chest
The super motherfucking villain grip the mic with an iron hand
Throwing MCs to the fire from out the frying pan
It ain't no use in trying, man, son stop crying
Fronting like you death-defying, need to stop lying
Speak your piece only once you're spoken to first
Now let me hear your verse while I'm choking you
With well refined rhymes like a editor
Throw them to my collections of skulls and spines like Predator
Fuck around, the only niggas who could hear the same sound (Who?) Was Jet Jaguar and James Brown
(Yeah yeah, only them two)
And I'm glad I took the time to write their names down to big 'em up (True, true)
[Verse 2]
I'd like to say, ""Hi, it's Sci.Fly, the odd Merlin""
That's quick to whip up a script like Rod Serling
Who eye on bad bitch who used to whip the Sterling
Who see God tore but never see God hurlin'
My man Grimm had his little monkey like Space Ghost
Me myself, I got flavors that out-taste most
With numb gums, some rhymers is lactose
Back to you MF DOOM, you late show host
S to the U to the P-E-R-uh
Who chronicle these times in a 3D horror
Thriller porno co-starrer in a realer drama
Who break bread with stingy kin-men, Indian borrower
Lone gunman who candidly flip fly flows
Single-handedly with one eye closed
In a fly pose, no shirt Alayé
May see me stack the quarter-mill cash pay
That's that inner smash way how he did it
Motherfucker probably couldn't peep it past a minute, it's the–
Exquisite scripts, that quick shit, go with flow
That's how we do it though"

Chasing cheese like a mouse, so you can call me Mickey
No girl, no spouse, so I’ve got no hickeys
Candy with my clothes cause I’ll rock them now and later
Superhero tees and some Supra Vaiders
More unique than that meal, pork butts and taters

Sharper than a meat cleaver

Dumb like a mentally retarded kid
I ain't got no friends, no ends to my stress
So I chill in the dark and shit
With a rifle and bomb, knife in my palm
Thinking 'bout the motherfucking lives I'mma harm
Swing at me then I'm slicing your arm
Then make you videotape me piping your mom
Ruthless!
Deceitful lies, listen up, you don’t want beef to rise
I really wanna murder Tomica Wright
I’m thinking of taking her out for a pizza slice
Then tie her ass up and then beat the life
Out her god damn skull 'til she bleeds and cries
The whole fucking time she was screaming ""Why?""
Fuck you bitch, don’t be surprised!
Time after time you told me that my album would drop
It was all bullshit, then the day that it finally did
Bitch how come it flopped?
It’s Ruthless baby for sho'
[Tomica] I’m tryna make me some dough
Get up off your ass to make a motherfucking marketing plan
And then maybe I'll blow
But no!
You wanna be a little bitch about it
Thought that I would never do shit about it
You made a contract with a twist around it

I be the illest when I crush these mics
But it never occurred that I must be right
You’re the reason I say ""fuck my life""
I hate you bitch, it's a must we fight!
Everybody keep on running around and asking
What do Tomica be doing with her time
I don’t really know though
I just keep it low-pro, 'cause I'm mad with the contract I signed
I was so happy at first, then it turned to a curse
How'd it happen to me?
That’s the question

One word that explains the truth
REAL!
Bang out 'til your brain is loose
All your little fun filled days are through
Remember that I’m like this thanks to you

[Hook]
Yeah brother you got to feel it just like a killer, killer!
Yeah brother you got to feel it just like a killer, killer!
Yeah brother you got to feel it just like a killer, killer!
Kill her, kill her!
Kill her, kill her!"
Real Gangster,South Park Mexican,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook:]
She don't know why
But all she knows
Is that her youngest child
Is a real gangster now
You see...

[Verse 1:]
He was a good kid all through elementary
A's and B's and had no enemies
But he saw all the G's as he walked home
He couldn't read all the words on the walls though
So many letters crossed out with X's
He wondered but knew not to ask those questions
No pops, and his mom worked to the nail
She managed to buy him some shoes on sale
She didn't know, she bought the wrong color
And they stayed in the closet all summer
Even though the kid wasn't affiliated
He knew what they loved, and knew what they hated
Now he's in Middle School, same individual
But this is where things seem to get a bit difficult
This is the life of a young Mexican
First verse done take me to the second one
[Hook x2]

[Verse 2:]
6th grade, why so much homework
Got a pot pie sitting in the stove burnt
Momma still ain't back from her job yet
So he eats it cause that's all he got left
Then he plays with his little puppy Cinnamon
His last dog was a victim of a hit n run
There's a knock on his door it's his homeboy
Your mom's gone? He pulls out a chrome toy
Where'd you get that from? The kid asked
We broke into a house we got a bunch of shit stashed
It was the first time he ever held a real gun
To get one of these you gotta steal one
We too young they won't let us buy a gat
Now if they shoot at us we can fire back
Who is they and why would they blast at me?
Cause you from the hood fool, this is family

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3:]
A year passes now the kids Dickies sag
In his pocket got a knife and a nickel bag
And the homeboy that showed him his first gun
Got killed last week in a burban
Putting work in 45 jerkin'
Lucky shot hit, popped like a virgin
Closed casket touched as he strolled past it
Got his name tattooed on two hoes asses
So he'll still be remembered often while
His little bitch gettin' hit doggy style
It ain't stoppin' now while his moms' on the ground
On her knees yelling ""Please Lord not my child
I want to watch him smile
He can turn his Pac up loud
He can sleep with his pitbull on the couch""
And while the kid is listening to her words
All he can think about is bloody, bloody murders
[Hook x2]"
You Are My Enemy,Hopsin,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Yo, I work hard and barely get paid
How did I get stuck on this page
I've been starving for like six days
I should go and get a switchblade
And try to find out where this bitch stays
I'm a lit flame, what's your future I predict pain
Slit veins, squished brains I'm just saying
Locked in the basement causes madness and errors
All I have to talk to is the fucking man in the mirror
But you never saw it from my perspective
The craft that I perfected got rejected
And thrown out the window with no proper exit
I was humble, now I'm not as pleasant
I'm dropping wreckage on your shady dynasty, bitch I'am not to mess with
You made me think it was impossible that I could blow and get a little money from selling records for copping clothes
Let's talk about the 42 records that Hopsin sold
You sleeping on a fucking pot of gold, so listen close

[Hook]
Don't you ever call me again
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
Right here is where it ends, ends, ends, sorry for you
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
You are my enemy
[Pre-Verse]
Yo, hold on one second, I gotta see who's next on this real quick
Oh, this stupid-ass
Alright

[Verse 2]
Yo, since when are buddies supposed to be so mean
There must be hate in the air that we both breathe
Shit we used to be tighter than emo jeans
The day I boss, stand back and watched the c-notes gleam
I know you see me blowing up, growing up it disturbs you
When my words move fanatics, and in return you gotta post little blogs on the internet
Talking about I've been a wreck, my career is wack I'll never benefit
I hope you die a bitter death
Then lie in a graveyard in regret
Where all of the foul niggas rest
You hating 'cause you witnessing the best
So just confess
You shattered our friendship and you can't fix the mess
I'm not a bit impressed by nothing you've done
My name's stuck on your tongue
Motherfucker you sprung
Give it up, move on
You've taken this shit too far
You mad 'cause you unsatisfied with who you are, bitch
[Hook]
Don't you ever call me again
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
Right here is where it ends, ends, ends, sorry for you
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
You are my enemy

[Pre-Verse 2]
Alright, lets see who else we got on this shit
Morgan
Alright, yo

[Verse 3]
You were the love I used to see in my dreams
But when we met, how come shit can never be what it seem
I was pleased with the things we did together
It's like we was a team
But you would change when I flee from the scene
Around me you were pure hearted, loving and caring
And when we hung out you'd even brighten up your appearance
You fooled me like you were smart, cute and something to stare at
But you was fronting little bitch, now I'm struggling to bare it
Because you were the opposite of what you told me you don't do
Drugs, one night stands and you know that it's so true
You saw my heart exposed, grabbed a hold and then broke through
Hoes are just so rude, fucking bogus and cold too
Oh but there's no dude you would let interfere
With our love, that's the exact shit you said in my ear
When you arrived in my world, I thought Heaven was near
But time made it very clear that the devil was here
So fuck you
[Hook]
Don't you ever call me again
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
Right here is where it ends, ends, ends, sorry for you
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
You are my enemy"
Fuck an Emcee Name,Watsky,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Alright, first of all
There's already a popular reggae artist with the name Elephant Man
Second of all, as my mother always said to me
There’s nothing cooler than being yourself
And third of all, and most importantly
(clears throat)

[Chorus]
F-F-F-F-Fuck an emcee name
I don't need a goddamn emcee name!
I got nothing to hide, you got something to say?
(George Watsky doesn't need a fucking emcee name)
F-F-F-F-Fuck an emcee name
I don't need a goddamn emcee name!
I got nothing to hide, you got something to say?
(George Watsky doesn't need a fuckin' emcee name)

[Verse 1]
If I go spit a poem If I go kick a flow
Doesn't really matter man cause the jam is a Watsky
When I get a mic and I go rip a rhythm ain't a name in the whole damn game gonna stop me
Probably gonna rip it too
'Cause the city wants a hippy with a bit to prove
I got shit to do I got the sickest crew
And so what the fuck is it to you, dude?
If I got no stage name I got stage game out the ass
And a master plan, It's an avalanche
When I spit a little bit of slam
And I hit you with the battleram
Got a cattle brand ""GW bar none"" so what do you park man?
Got money and cars? damn, I study the stars
And I couldn't care less who you rep in your set show respect
I'll be rapping I bet
Lean to the left flow right Oh my god!
A rose by any name got thorns as sharp
Yo, stage names are for porno stars
And Watskeet skeet skeet skeet is far
From what I'm trying to do, who I'm trying to be
Mother f-f-f-fuck this industry
If I gotta be MC U to do MC Me
Georgewatsky.mp3
F-F-F-F-Fuck the limit I got a keep it coming if I wanna make it to the top
'Cause I be giving you what I been doing during the minutes that other rappers have been napping on the clock
'Cause if I walk the walk and I talk the talk and I'm popping off 'cause my flow is hot
Then I'm pretty motherfucking positive I never gotta try to be somebody I'm not

F-F-F-F-Fuck an emcee name
I don't need a goddamn emcee name!
I got nothing to hide, you got something to say?

I got nothing to hide, you got something to say?
(George Watsky doesn't need a fuckin' emcee name)

[Verse 2]
What's in a name, man, flow comes first
I'm never gonna curse—that I got it worst when I roam the earth
It's a ridiculous coincidence that shows my worth
You know, my parents went and chose my emcee name at birth
I don't need a mask to cover my ass
So why would you ask? Go put me on blast
I'll take you to task
This name is my last (gasp) so put it on my tombstone when I pass
(Here lies a fine emcee, the kind who grasps the fact
That these aren't circus acts to make you clap, it's rap to make you think and act)
I think you understand by now the thought involved
That if I wanted to be called another name I would have scrawled it on the bathroom wall
I'm not apologizing for a policy that makes a college kid go call himself Thugdog and not expect assault
I'm marching on and calling all dissenters who
Would like to be included in this emcee designation coup
I'm set to get a crew
We're gonna get a clue and then we'll put it up for you to view
Coo coo ca choo I am the ""insert you""
Come on everybody do it too
[Chorus]
F-F-F-F-Fuck an emcee name
I don't need a goddamn emcee name!
I got nothing to hide, you got something to say?

F-F-F-F-Fuck an emcee name
I don't need a goddamn emcee name!
I got nothing to hide, you got something to say?

High Road,Fort Minor,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Let's go, ya'll

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
These people are running off at the mouth
Trying to convince me that I'm running on empty
Trying to convince themselves
That the record with Jay was a fluke
That the record that I'm making is a mistake
And I can't take this
Let me tell you where I'm at with this
You bastards are gonna have to take back that shit
I'm not plastic and fake
When I make tracks, I take facts and lay them out for the masses
You assholes are gonna see soon that I'm not playing
Start asking me the names that I'm not saying
But I'm trying to be bigger than the bickering
Bigger than the petty name calling, under-the-breath talking
Rumors and labels and categorization
I'm like a struggling doctor, no patients
But you can say what you want about me
Keep talking while I'm walking away (Bitches)
[Chorus: John Legend]
You can say what you have to say
'Cause my mind's made up, anyway
I'm taking the high road going above you
This is the last time that I'm gonna trust you
You can say what you have to say
'Cause my mind's made up anyway
All that bullshit you talk might work a lot
But it's not gonna work, today

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
You people are running off at the mouth
Trying to make me take myself off safety
Trying to make my friends turn their backs
On the team we built
Building up some mistaken information
And I can't take this
Let me spell it out plain for you
Angry groups complain about the things we do
I'm not changing direction, I'm stepping my game up
Maintaining my name, the same way I came up
You're gonna see that I'm not playing And Start asking me the names that I'm not saying
But I'm trying not to mention the names of people
Who wanna siphon attention, you like the hype
But pretending you're part of the picture won't pass
You're like a high school dropout, no class
You can say what you want about me
Keep talking while I'm walking away (Bitch)
[Chorus: John Legend]
You can say what you have to say
'Cause my mind's made up, anyway
I'm taking the high road going above you
This is the last time that I'm gonna trust you
You can say what you have to say
'Cause my mind's made up anyway
All that bullshit you talk might work a lot
But it's not gonna work, today

[Bridge: John Legend]
Why does it always have to be
Somebody's always watching me
All I really need is some room to breathe, breathe, breathe
Is anybody out there, listening?
'Cause I can't stand to keep this in
All I really want, I'll say it again, yeah, yeah
(Like that)

[Chorus: John Legend]
You can say what you have to say
'Cause my mind's made up, anyway
I'm taking the high road going above you
This is the last time that I'm gonna trust you
You can say what you have to say
'Cause my mind's made up anyway
All that bullshit you talk might work a lot
But it's not gonna work, today"

Uh, yeah
Hahaha
So I'm go, no BlackBerry's, no iPhones, none of that
We just go off the top, no written, no nothing
Uh, uh, and the beat drops
Uh

[Verse]
I feel a little bit forgiven
Thank God, allow me this day
I feel so high when I be livin'
They can’t stop me, know how, uh-uh, no way
I don’t play, me and Tim, me and him, we rocks out
L-U-P do that, no shoes, just some socks out
I'm relaxin' in the club, DJin', playbacking
Everything that I do, they don’t know what happen
They be tryin', I deny them at the bucket, I say fuck it
If they want it then they love it, if they don’t then they can suck it
And, what I mean by it, you should re-try it
I’m on my Dean, you be on a dean-diet
And I dont even like it
Everytime you rap it, I swear I close my eyes
I wish I could close my ears from this racket
I ain't having it, I tennis while you bin it
I stay on it, I strong as Popeye with some spinach
You as long as short something
You be tryna ten it see
I ain't going HAM, I’m going bacon, going pig
I’m going whole cow, look at me, what I did
You wish you could, but you just kid
I’m a grown man on it, my own man on it
Come in your house, now your home damn haunted
See everybody dead, bullet holes in the head
But I ain't kill em, I hit em with the flow instead
My flow like bullets, they like hollow tips
I wish you would if you could, if you would try it
But you can’t so back to denying the
They be lying ah
I be so up on my truthless and I’m so ruthless
Ferrari top down yeah I got like four of those
And my Ferrari so clean it got four doors
Only got two LUP on that new shit
New Ferrari 400i, that blue kit
So I got my rims and my watch and my rings on
Yeah I got my bling on
Go ahead and sing songs
If you want I tell no tales and no lies
I drop no dimes on my homies
I keep them alive behind the bar
Shout to Chilly chill, I’m so really real
And the streets so deep, you wish that I wasn’t but I am cousin
God damn he be buzzing
No weed no liquor, MD offa something
See my brain just flows and see just how I goes
And I’m from Chicago and I’m letting niggas know
You can cut it out and scratch it or baste it
Or send it through the strainer but please don’t waste it
Make sure you clean the plates when I’m done cooking
I’m Lil B, I am big ME, you little he, ahh
Sometin’ better, theres none of that, I’m running rap
Everything around it like hustling trap, stuntin that
Everything you bad at, I do so well
Then I eat the whole beat than put it on sale
That means I put it out to sea
You never get it back
It’s only coming back to me, uh
Indeed, it’s the LUP, Tim Westwood on our BBC Business
Flip the beat up and bring me another track
Some of that, uh, some up all up under that
Bring the sun back, that be me I'm so on fire
So higher like the moon and I will not retire
But maybe soon but, maybe that will be that noon uh
Then I wake you up for it and pace you up for it
Uh, if you got it take you up on it
You can roll the dice but, promise you don't want it
See, you ain't really on it, you be on some other shit
I be on some wonky shit and be on some tonky shit
Takin' it and walking' it, L U P be stalking' it
Round the corner dressed up, so tight, no light
Unlike anybody ever seen too clever
Flowing off the top of the dome to whoever's beat
Uh, and whoever's neat I'm nicer
I'm more bling, more clean, more play - no dice uh
No dice cuz, see I don't roll that
Don't believe in luck just bringin' confidence
Constantly, consequence of tryna defy is not nice
You be so dead, uh - twice
Kill 'em again, and again, and again
The adrenaline that's flowing up in him
Uh, and you know it something special
It's damn near incredible I should eat this
Uh-uh uh, uh
I love my way but I'm back up on my path
A rapping wrath, a chaos spiting
Uh, It's more gripping
It's more intelligent and more thrilling
Than anything that they can do even though they top billing
See, I be underdoggin', I be underloggin'
Uh, it's something special someone better off them
It's damn near awesome but more like incredible
You can't eat me nigga I am so unedible
But if you swallow it's like swallowing glass
Got a belly full of doo
You can't stomach got a belly full of [?]
The audacity of them to think they rapidly ascend
I'm so aggressive or in the rage I take them off the stage
Skytel I bring it back just got a page
I'm like Tron, step up in the [?] it's the Don
See what' going on and in my own world
You can keep your home girl I got the whole world
In my hands in my palms, uh something like a bomb
Around the chest of some suicide vest, nah
It's Vietnam here, you keep it calm there
Cause you don't want none of this with ya
I hit ya, and git ya, split you, and brake it down
Bag it up, go to the hood take a route
Uh, take another shot, take another three
These are all bars [?] music and you can't see
And can't beat what I am, that's a A+
Uh, I hope God wanna save us
If they won't save you
Play too damn much messing with the homeboy, ya
Uh, uh that L U P nigga
Yea, yea, fire flame spitta
Uh, uh that L U P nigga
Yea, yea, fire flame spitta
Fire flame spitta
On another track, don't want none of that
With no water and no slaughter
No breaks I just continue on, with no takes
I keep going, I keep flowing, no stopping that
And see everybody watching that
See I got the lock so I'll be locking that, you can't get the keys
Especially from me, I keep them so excited in my pocket
You'd better watch it, and matter of fact you'd better stop it
I'm too hot, better hopscotch it and go up down the block
You might catch a shot, one two
Blat, blat, blat -
My flow is like...Heckler and Koch
Hit you up straight
Niggas aiming for your face when I come through...
I ain't hitting hearts, I'm just aiming for the brains
Trying to make'em smarter and take'em out of danger's way
And say maintain today
I show the shorties how to maintain the way so righteous
The nicest and do it like is priceless, iceless
No, I got a couple those watches and a couple cars
And I keep a couple flows and a couple bars
And I keep a couple hoods and a couple stars
In my back pocket and you can back watch it
You better backstop it like it's cricket
I keep a wicket googly when I stick it, be like the Batman, hitcha
You can come through just like don't pitch it out
I'll knock it out the park, it'll be so dark
By the time I'm done, there'll be no sun
There'll be no one, see the crowd so empty
I'll still be there rhyming, see it don't tempt me
I don't feel guilty either, I feel so filthy when I roll
Flowing like ether, burning niggas down
Turning niggas' worlds around and show them there's better ways to get it down
Yeah, yeah, it feeling like an iPod
Look at my god and bow my head down to heaven
I pray to the East, I try to do it seven times a day
Do it my way, may god forgive me for the prayers that I didn't do
And for the fasts that I didn't fast
I hope you make my success last longer than the rest of them
Or if not keep me so intelligent that I stay beyond it and don't care about their success or their chains
I don't care nowhere, but I do care about you, don't ever let'em doubt you
Don't ever let them try to put a mouth to the violence
The silence that I bring is so deafening to the ears and the eyes
And they can watch if they want to
See it's gonna haunt you
The ghosts of the past come through so fast
You lay'em down but they can't, you try and put it in the trash
But it jumps out the garbage and still returns to be the hardest on the market

Boom, guess who stepped in the room

Back from the dead but they never found my killer
So I jumped up out the grave like Michael Jackson in Thriller
Iller than most MCs cause I be killin’ ‘em

Pussy nigga I'm a hitman
And when it come to pussy nigga I'm a clit man

Well this is the effect, all these films beginning ???
The kids are very impressionable.  Three?
They see all these films and they want to imitate their heroes
What heroes though?
All they see is robbers, rapists, muggers, and murderers
I'm impressed, you're a killer

[Mr. Lif]
Yo
The planet's covered in asphalt
The Lord told me that its man's fault
For perpetuating detrimental ways of living we can't halt
Everything inside ya move
You're caught inside a homicidal groove
Where only the idle lose
By violating one of life's most vital rules
Thou shalt not
But hell is a foul spot, where many are misinformed when they are taught
And thus cherish the untrue
Then die for the lies that they clung to
Del and I were there when they hung you
And as you swung to and fro
We asked, (where did the humane humans go?)
With none in sight
We're left to focus on the stunning plight
That spites the same force that put the sun in flight
So I summon night
The lack of light left some in fright
And living in fear
Was something they couldn't bear
I promise to tell the truth and the whole truth
I solemnly swear
[Chorus 3x]
Left
Right
Up
Down
Diagonal
Three-hundred and sixty degrees

[DJ Craze scratches ""three sixty degrees""]

[Del the Funky Homosapien]
Progression, the lesson
I figure out which direction, then jettison
Minimalize perplexion
Flesh and bone, that's just a physical
I got a spiritual
Awareness, I have risen to
It's not mystical, something that I listen to
When these plastic motherfuckers try to get in-to
My cypher, I siphon they blood like they split in two
Yeah, Del, repel, arduous
The purest, give 'em service
With no insurance
Evil
I see through, like cellophane
Knowledge of self, that's why people see Del is strange
They wanna humanize the most demonic dudes
Apply harmonic rules
Decide, who is the guy
Americas'
Just like a pair of glove
Don't want to share with us
Anarchy, tear it up
[Chorus 3x]
[Craze scratches ""three sixty degrees""]

[Mr. Lif then Del alternating stanzas]
The new era, brings terror
You wish the quality of life was better
Peep the dilemma

Your light's getting dimmer
Stomach's gettin' thinner
But your souls keep you full, obesity is for sinners

The sentiment lingers
Low self-esteem hinders

I tell my people 'bout slavery, no one remembers

Maybe they ought to take a look in they mirrors

Like Michael Jackson, and they actions gettin' clearer

Beware, the imagery might scare ya

If you ain't close to the source, then you don't like prosperity

One of many waitin' in line for therapy
But everyone bear a seed
As pure as the air we breathe

So say you wanna go, well I say go ‘head good bitch
I tour PGA, that's ""Pussy n Good Ass""

Shorty get to working my nerves, she need to stop it
Special investigate son, she jumping through my phone
I wanna fucking be friend this is not want I want
Shit was cool til she shifted now her emotions involved
I got that dick game that put bitches in pyscho ward
She said she need me like she need air
And it hurts because I’m acting like I don’t care
I was stuck so we fuck, call it ""make up sex""
Call it magic, she tried to leave, she come back
She gotta have it
She addicted to my left stroke
Nah man, my right stroke
I hit the back of that thing, she hit high notes

You niggas in trouble man
I woke up this morning, feeling like the old me
I swear to God man
Everytime I say something, it’s hot
This shit just come outta me man
They say I work just what I am
I’m an artist, Dont waste your time being a critic
Because I’m critically acclaimed muthaf-cker

There will never be another me
I’m a perfectionist striving for perfection

Burst macs like it's Hamburger Hill for real
It's Red Dawn when the Mobb get it on

Fake one, take one, no ultimatum, face one

Straight from the grain come the great one
My blade swung, decapitate your snake head
Slit your snake tongue, make one false maneuver - you a mystery
Unsolved, the mob that revolves automatically involved
Musclebound sounds surround commercial thugs
Rock turtledove Bowery suits and purple gloves
Me and you can have some fun, make it a blast
You couldn't take the impact with steel shoulder pads
Blood for blood, veteran covered in mud
Wounded in the midst of war, still tradin' slugs, gettin' major love
Way above you newcomers
I come thunderin' with the heat of two summers
When I enter the zone, move mountains with the presence alone
Before the words rip through the microphone
Chrome dipped lyrics are known to split stone
You privatize, home in but can't seem to clone

Drop by your dwellin', got the nueve right behind your melon
Ain't no tellin' when the bullet's behind the trigger

You wouldn't survive, nigga, if I chose you
Froze you from ear to ear, showin' your whole vocal
Who told you, you could roll through?

Love Is... Live,Bo Burnham,['pop'],"Um, so this next song is about love, appropriately

[Verse 1: Bo Burnham]
I love you like kings love queens
Like a gay geneticist loves designer jeans
I need you like New Orleans needs a drought
Like Hitler's father needed to learn to pull out
And I want you, yea, like a lawyer/mathematician wants some kind of proof
And I want you, yea, like JFK wanted a car with a roof
Cause love is takin' a dive
Then gettin' really comfortable and peein' in the pool
And love is real life porn minus all the stuff that makes porn cool

And love is a homeless guy searching for treasure
In the middle of the rain and finding a bag of gold coins
And slowly finding out that they're all filled with chocolate
And even though he's heartbroken, he can't complain cause he was hungry in the first place

I love you like Dora loves maps like the Pope's toilet loves holy craps
I need you like a voyeur needs a branch
Like boys tossing salad needs a little bit of Neverland Ranch
And I want you like all the Gothic kids
That look exactly the same never want to conform
And I want you like Anne Frank wanted
Nobody to read her fucking diary
Cause a diary's a collection of secret things
That no one is suppose to read thats the whole point of a diary
Millions of people have breached this little girls privacy
After she was chased by Nazis kick her while she's down

And if we met in 10000 BC I was your caveman youz my cavelady
If we got hot we'd start rubbing
If we got hungry we'd go clubbing
Theres wooly mammoths but I will protect us
You're making me devolve to a Homo Erectus. Oh

And if we met in 1780
I was a white Southern aristocratic plantation owner
And you were my dark-skinned servant lady
Slave, whenever I could get away from the misses
I'd go to your shed and then i'd steal you kisses
But let's be serious i'd still work you full time as a slave
There's a difference between romantic language
And a complete disregard for socio-economic trends

And if we met in 1941
I was a Nazi youz a Gypsy on the run
That's a little redundant
That, probably wouldn't've worked out
Because love is your favorite food for every breakfest, lunch and dinner
And love is the Holocaust if you don't die quick and you don't get thinner
And love is being the owner of the company that makes rape whistles
And even though you started the company with good intentions trying to reduce the rate of rape
Now you don't want to reduce it at all cause if the rape rate declines
You'll see an equal decline in whistle sales
Without rapists whos gonna buy your whistles
Whose gonna buy your whistles
Love is all about whistles
Thank you

Uh, that one was a bit vulgar, but uh, y'know
Dicks and vaginas are kinda like Coke and Pepsi

Work It Out,Talib Kweli,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
The temperature got tempers flaring
People sweat when the weather hot
They argue and they fret a lot
Then set up the plot to whet up the block
Whether or not the blood is red up in the gutter
Music is my bread and butter
I got a show in Brooklyn cause the ghetto love us
Pulled up in Mtulu's truck
I'm suited up I'm cool as fuck
Security tripping on my baseball hat
Promoter knew what's up
Plus Chaps had on some denim shorts and white tee shirt and
I told the bouncer they being disrespectful cause like you we working
I ain't a custy or a patron and
Trust me no one would be paying to come in this crusty ass club if I ain't playing
He's like ""I'll put you the fuck out""
And when you put your words like that its like third strike black you struck out
His man tried to rush me from behind Chaps stuck out a size nine
Seen him trip face first into the line
Cats is cowards with no spine and they power tripping too
The next level is the violence
So what y'all niggas wanna do
[Hook]
Work it out
We should try to work it out
People lie, people cry, people die to work it out
Read a book, pray to God
Look inside to work it out
We should try to work it out
Yo what y'all ladies wanna do
Work it out
To get fly she work it out
People lie, people cry, people die to work it out
Read a book, pray to god
Look inside to work it out
Show the love
Lose the hate
Work it out
Work it out

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
People placed in situations
They can't take and what they facing
Is the trials and tribulations to make them say the lords forsaken them
Their loved ones intervening but they always end up blaming them
For problems they don't realize what they part is in creating them
Like men who so insecure think they women cheating on them
And women who think the proof that they man love them is they beating on them
Keep sleeping on them soon they partner creeping on them
Committing crimes of passion they in caskets mother weeping on them
With her head in her hands there's only one thing that the dead understand
That it's better to be alive
Now what you gonna do stick your head in the sand
You probably the type to fall for anything and take that instead of a stand
Now that's a mouse instead of a man
I cherish my role as the head of my fam
And on the road I meet incredible fans
I rock with singers an a DJ instead of a band
We at a theatre near you
So what y'all niggas wanna do
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
Stay civilized when they try to kill my high
I try to think through problems
Bring honesty to rap like Cam'ron brought the pink to Harlem
You could be on the brink to stardom and suddenly you sink to bottom
Tell the truth about the war and suddenly you linked Saddam
Hate the topic but the closet people get to patriotic
Is red bull white vodka mixed with the straight hypnotic
Paper prophets sell the revolution so they make a profit
Trust they got it fucked up with your taxes started making rockets
Take it off the top like politicians speaking proper diction
Stuffing dollars in they britches like they do a lotta stripping
Got the top position bitching about the quality of life
All that bullshit get exposed as soon as Kweli sees the mic
They cutting down the tree of life
The sun rays is running out
The babies ain't eating right
The guns stay coming out
See how they play the streets an night slap the taste out your mouth
To show you what they work about
So what y'all niggas wanna do

Hard as They Come Act I,CunninLynguists,"['alternative', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Natti]
I’m a monster that don’t reside up under your bed
I’mma march to the beat that I put into your head
Send shots to your liver I deliver you death
You can barter your tomorrow but a martyr you’re left
Get you hot under the collar when my name’s on your breath
Click the starter on your Impala I’ll be there when you wreck
Fucking with me you better keep your feelings in check
Be the life of the party or a lifeless body
Get with me thinking you hard, you’ll be hardly standing
I’m the hardest of them all, you’re the hardest landing
Face first in the asphalt, your ass talked
Too reckless, now you helpless from the rounds you caught
I’ll teach your ass a lesson, outlined in chalk
Have you hostage in the hospice, high and trying to walk
I am bravery in a bottle, I am courage in a glass
I got the government’s approval, prohibition couldn’t last
I go hard

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
C’mon lets ride out
The whole family over for Christmas dinner
Let’s go through the purses and sell the gifts from your mom's house
They know you out here doing dirt for cash
Plus you the one unemployed, a couple dollars ain’t gon hurt they ass
I’m the only friend you got
You tried to sell me but you took a hit and eventually you just couldn’t stop
A couple of sniffs would get you lit but couldn’t get you to the top
Oh what an event when you got hip to cooking me into them rocks
I had you locked, you know it costs to come and see me
So fuck yo groceries, fuck yo bills, go on and pawn that TV
And fuck yo life, just catch this beam and take it straight to the dome
And fuck yo kids, the state’ll separate em’ and place em’ in homes
It’s gonna be cool, I know I got you crazy subdued
Ever since the 80’s played your whole community for a fool
And the ones that sold me smoke each other over new tennis shoes
They field niggas, I’m the definition of death, the real killa
[Verse 3: Kno]
I’m with the fiends on the block playing shoot em’ up
When I erupt makes it hard to know who to trust
People scared to test me since the 80’s
Anybody can get it, man woman or baby
Shots do not discriminate, impossible to eliminate
I disseminate, you disintegrate
I can come off as a prick, you might get stuck with me
I’ll prolly steal your girl if you try and fuck with me
Cause next to me you’re looking quite frail
And if you snitch you’ll be counting your days in white cells
Just needlessly in CB4, ask the CDC, no CD4’s
Cause the truth is I’m on America’s dick
Uncle Sam fucks the poor and it’s making em’ sick
Now their life’s in a tube, a downward spiral
Give a new meaning to going viral
I’m hard as they come

Turn bags from bladders, legs to wheels, pain and pills
'Cause you fucking with a nigga that'll jump out, wave the steel

At your memorial be one year from today (today)

I leave you reesy piecy, all my bitches rock
Christian Dior, BCBG, 'round phony niggas get the heeby jeebies

Dookie braids no dreadlocks
Flyin' in and out of town with half a chicken in her cock
And I love her, 'cause she down
To fuck around with the underground pussy hound
And her ass is big round and wide
Jacked up, make a nigga down to ride
Smoking indo, playing that Super Nintendo
Hear a rat-a-Tat-Tat on my window
Gave her ass that pelvic thrust
Don't trust the rubber 'cause its bound to bust
In the oven, in the nappy

You climb on my cockpit, you at the front of my plane

We in Nirvana, in the sauna, treat me like Kurt Cobain
And I’m in love like Courtney when you blow out my brains

I watch you cock that thing back and I just hope that it bang

And now I can’t get home and you are only to blame

When you are wet and covered in sweat
I'll wipe ya ass down like Boosie baby
And love, I don't mind feedback
Tell me to give it to ya if you need that
Touch right there, whatever the speeds at

Half of that's ice and the rest is Patron
Show up on time for the class I'm teaching
Cause guaranteed I'mma bring a lesson along
And you just gotta bring the breastes along

Blink slow cuz Its on when I spit a rap
Hit a fat track then I'm back where winner at
This feast on me like a dinner mat
No PG I be seen on the Cinamax
All natural, all them apples
All actual, all dissolved in a capsule
Factual, not a hassle
Homeless man wants to know where his crack goes
In my lap yo, In my back pocket
Can't fly you sad rocket
Mad profit, mine for a rhyme cuz I'm sick buddy
Spit funny, get money, chicks like a Kid Cudi
Thats why your girl want the dick from me
Cuz she know that I fuck like a quick bunny

Coming thru, hate cuz I be patient in front of you
Stay great cuz Im something new

When she's with me it's Heaven Sent
And she screaming remix dope shit...

[Verse 2: (rap)]
You mite wanna ride out...
Cause yea, boy I'm heavy on the block
Drive-by
Tear da sides out
Hope she don't find out
How a nigga PUT IT DOWN...
After great sex there's this FANCY-ass lifestyle
Bettin on horses
Racing in Porsches
Just a small portion of a muthafuckin fortune
Carolina Acres
Sittin on my porches
Scenes from the mountains money greener than this forest
I'll always a-dore ya
I will always love ya
Cause I'm thinkin of pleasing you even after I fuck ya
Cause there's anotha level
After that otha level
He's on that plane level
And I'm Space Shuttle...

Say what you want
Girl you know you miss me

We Must Be Heard,DJ Drama,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[In the background] This... Could be something big!

[Ludacris]

Don't change the station
I've been impatiently waiting
Pacin', welcome to the Danger Zone
It's a war goin' on outside
And my people gotta paint they faces on
And what I gotta do, And what I gotta do
Is work and flip a dolla'
Ain't got no trophies
But I got a shelf of empty liquor bottles

Not an alcoholic but alcohol it
Can ease the pain
Drinkin' all my problems away
But still prayin' in Jesus' name
Tryna' turn our voices up
And the government tones us down
Now that gas is goin' up
And the hood is goin' down
So the hood is comin' fo' ya'
In the streets is hungry goons!
Comin' to a neighborhood near you
Today or someday soon
Betta' watch yo' back, watch yo' front
And watch yo' side to side
Betta' grab yo' gat, light that blunt;
The streets gon' ride tonight

And I'm just gon' ride it out
Til my expiration date
Cause I go hard in the paint
They softer than paper plates
Make way for the revolution
And yes you should be scurred
Cause one way or another...
My people will be heard

[Willie the Kid]

I'mma show you what the soldiers see:
Embassy, Diplomacy
Sing-sing infantry
Shootin' at the cobra fleet
Deploy shots, similar to airbags, whereas
This hairpin, trigga' split a hair in half
Body bags, fishy like Herring
When I'm airin', tear a chair in half
Watchin' Half Baked
At the cabin by the Lake
See the blue and white plates
See the wood on the panel
Or maybe cherry oak, Chilly O, flannel coat
Warfare? Never fair
Therefore, I need finer things:
Like grenades; tanks; a couple fighter planes

I'm decorated in medals;
Stripes like a Zebra
And by the way, you rappin' Nigga's
I don't like you neitha'
I mean, ""either,"" proper gramma'
Pop a camera -- man on that rap, DVD propaganda
Yeah, Willie the Kid, I ain't one for the shenanigans
Nigga' strike a pose, leave you froze, like a mannequin

[Busta Rhymes]
(During Kid's last verse) In these times
The economy got nigga's thinkin'
The worst to make paper
Cause somebody ain't accommodatin' nigga's
Enough for they slave labor
That's when ya' get a Nigga' thinkin about
Ya' know he gotta' come in to ya'
It's when a nigga' throw a ski mask on
Run up in ya' house, and wanna' do dumb shit to ya'
Rollin' the dices with a nigga' that be strugglin'
Tryna' make it through the crisis
It might just make him wanna' act up a little bit
To print another new gas prices
All this fuckery we got goin' on
Indeed it needs to cease
How the hell is THAT ever, ever gonna happen
When the value of the dollar keeps decreasin'?

Easin' my hand in somebody's pocket
(Fuck that!) I gotta' keep eatin
Speakin' for everybody in the struggle like me
We gotta get it even if we cheatin'!
Breathin' hard, my mind is blown
Tryin' not to get evicted out my home
But tryna' live when you know a nigga' broke
Is like tryna' squeeze blood out a stone

But I'm goin' through the drama with DJ Drama (What!?)
I do it for my kids and mama (Who!)
Leave it to Barack Obama (Yes!)
Change is right around the corna'
You tryin' to keep our people sufferin'
All I gotta say is if you don't ease up this pressure
I promise somebody gonna' pay!

[DJ Drama (?)]

(Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness!
Pursuit, huh?
See Each and every day we all get closer
To the real meanin'
Me, myself? I always follow my own path
And now I come here to motivate!

So I make this my Life
My Liberty
And everday, my Pursuit

Thank you
I've been through it all
The fails, the falls
I'm like Niagara

I am agri-culture
Swagger so mean it might insult ya
Hah, I'm like an ultra-vulture
I fuck around and catapault ya
Torture
Thought ya parents taught ya?
You guys is chocha
I'm gone, buenos noches
Flow scorcher
And I don't even write — No author
So harder, so smarter
All about a dollar, like four quarters
Oh Father, will tonight be my last?
And if so, make sure my kids see my cash
And I know, I'm solid like an elbow cast
And my future will be better than my past
Weezy!
[Chorus]
You can love me or hate me
I swear it won't make me or break me
I'm going wherever the money take me
Until they funeral and wake me
And don't wake me
'Cause I'm sleeping
I'm dreaming
I know that there's a better way
'Cause I've seen it, Lord
But this faster money is so convenient
And I need it
Say I need it

[Verse 2]
C-A-R, T-E-R
I spit movies like a VCR
I spit rounds like the Tiki bar
And if I got beef I'm the meat cleav-er
And I are
The illest nigga Martin Luther King died for
And I ride for
Hollygrove, One-Seven, Eagle Street
And I'm higher than an eagle's feet
But I believe in me
Apple is the cross street
I am just an offspring
Born in the ghetto
That's why I can't let go
One call I'll have my dogs on ya like an echo
Baby, I am the real deal, no pickle
Uh, spit sickle-cell psycho
I go
Off, like a motherfucking rifle
And I'm from
The underground baby, like a pipe hole
And I will stand tall like light poles
Until the light blows
[Chorus]
And you can love me or hate me
Baby, I swear it won't make me or break me
And I be going wherever the money take me
Until they funeral and wake me
And don't wake me
'Cause I'm sleeping
And I'm dreaming
See I'm just hustling
Living what I believe in, dog
And it's a problem when our homies not eating
And I'm greedy
I'm greedy

[Verse 3]
Share my blood
Feed my family
My flow will have to plead insanity
So sick I need Gray's Anatomy
Acid, like a bust open battery
I'm cool like L.A. nights
I'm tight like ballet tights
Ay, Juelz
I swear the other day I pissed Cristal
These bitches tryna kick it like Juntao
I gotta watch my head in the battle
I'm just trying to stay ahead of my shadow
And I'm floating like a boat and a paddle
Alligators and rattlesnakes
But I promise I will take a nigga off, like a Saturday
Got money to validate
I'm icy like carrot cake
Different colored diamonds make me look like a salad plate
I'm straight out the alleyway
It's the nigga ya daddy hate
Weezy F. Baby—great!
[Chorus]
I know they love me then hate me
But I'm a G –
It won't make me or break me
And you can find me wherever the money place me
Yeah, until you're riding to the late me
And don't wake me
'Cause I'm sleeping
And I'm dreaming
And me and my Lord got an agreement, y'all
And so I thank him every day for my achievements
And I'm Weezy

I'm still winning and I'm nowhere near finished
It's just the first inning
And I'm gunning for the Pennant
And I been this, God made me
Y'all hate me, y'all atheists
Y'all safety is at risk
It's the return of the Messiah
One and only Hov
No I ain't God but I've been made in his mould
So when the story is told let it be said I refuse to fold
I only fold bread
I stood for the best, I owed no debt
I represent the hood til my dying breath
I took a pay cut to become an exec
So the next motherfucker can earn his paycheck
And even though these niggas talk greasy bout me
Ask these niggas how they 'gon eat without me
Ask these niggas if they want stats involved
And even if they don't like me, they respect the God

He's a grown man, you're an infant to him
Take your baby money and burn, T-Ha
I spent that on furniture
I got Warhols on my hall's wall
I got Basquiats in the lobby of my spot

Thousand dollars for the sneaks
Timbo on the track, 250 for the beat
G4 back and forth to my floor seats
I spent a couple mil' just to lose to the Heat

Anything you aspire, to acquire I got
Any gun you say, you fired

Oh never that, oh never that

It's beautiful

[Verse 1]
Listen, I got a lot to say
Usually my smile stay locked away
But not today, I have to laugh on the real
The aftermath's kind of ill like I'm Dr. Dre
Sometimes I run to the club and get faded
This game make you get jaded, I just hate it (just hate it)
But this song gives a different kind of feeling
It's a new kind of dealing, it's a special kind of healing (uh huh)
And I can show what it is
Best flow in the biz? You know what it is
Positive over negative, see the Ace a Masta
Even when I face disaster (that's right)
I rise up above
See, people still showing me love
Got the respect without dropping a check
This hip hop thing might stop in a sec
So this brand new hit, you can pop in the deck
It's beautiful
[Hook]
So look inside yourself
Something you never felt
Feeling like nothing else
What's inside goes beyond your mind, it's beautiful

[Verse 2]
Yeah, this is brand new Uptowns still in the box
This is the Yankees, 10-nothing, killing the Sox
This ain't hugging the block with a gat in your hand
This is Boca Raton on a catamaran (that's right)
With the sun beaming down where you at in the sand
I feel like I'm more than a cat with a plan
This feels like it's more than a flash in the pan
This is milk in the cup and cash in your hand
This is a warm coat on the coldest night
That's why I stole this mic, y'all don't hold this right (nope)
First in a class of many
This is a bottle of Jack, no a glass of Henny (that's right)
Now drink it up 'til there ain't nothing left in it
I'm repping it, BK, that's a definite
Just more of these amazing rhymes
A song like this in these days and times is beautiful

So look inside yourself
Something you never felt
Feeling like nothing else
What's inside goes beyond your mind, it's beautiful
[Verse 3]
(I'm wishing on a, on a, on...) the most beautifullest thing ever
And it's here to bring terror to the bling era (yeah)
You can feel it in your inner
It's like Grandma's house, Thanksgiving dinner
It's like a day in the park
Or at night when you get the ball and you play in the dark (swish)
It's that street corner music
Where most cats when they pull that heat gon' use it
I see a black man aiming his gun
But I'd rather see a black man claiming his son
You know the sound is pretty
Even when you got to get down and gritty
This is money in the bank like you down with Diddy
This a helicopter ride around the city
And we love it cause it brought us here
It's a young mother braiding her daughter's hair
It's beautiful

So look inside yourself
Something you never felt
Feeling like nothing else

No point in pointin' the blame, and so I'll hide it
But look, Hop's my name and all provided
I'm not enforcin' my law, just hopin' you abide by it

Always G'd out, blacked out, from my head to toe
And it ain't a question that I be out to get the dough
Call up my connect, get the powder in from Mexico
Late night, come across the border in the Chevy ho
Get it for the low, if you need a plug, let me know
I get it from him, you come to me for the petty coke
That's the way the cycle go around like a merry go
Round, put it down for my town, they already know

So when we hit the road, haters better hide your hat (why?)
We hittin' licks with them bricks and them ninety packs (damn)
I hit this over twenty bro, it ain't no lie to that
Sting 'em for 300K and now I got to ride it back (so what ya doin?)
I'm lookin' for the laws, where ya hidin' at? (I see 'em)
Pull me over, I'm the decoy, fly for that (let's go)

Yes,Childish Gambino,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Yes, I'm Mr. Big Stuff
Yeah, my stuff big, man
Keep a girl's pussy bright red like a pig's tan
Four shots and watch me lean like a kick stand
I really need to change my name to, ""Hey, I'm a big fan!""
Cause that's all I hear when I'm outside
And my hoodie's never jealous of that tie-dye
Cheesy on the mic, like I'm laying on Jordan
No homo for you niggas homophobic

Yes, I back bend these girls aerobic
And these hoes got a Spiderman like Tobey
Keep these girls wet, call them Lakers like Kobe
Got money trees, asking me, ""Do you grow me?""

Latin girls kiss my feet like they're Superga
Latin girls see your face and call you ""stupida""
Yes my name is Childish, so I guess I'm cheesy
Yes yes yes my wallet's cheesy
Throw your hood up, are you queasy?
Yes, I am the Juggernaut
Yes, my name is Elroy
Yes, my dick will make that ho tell, like a bell boy
And I get my tip, and my tip is in your girl
And I'm gonna bust a nut like I'm a Gallagher squirrel

It's the man of the hour
Better yet, the century, check the whiskey sour
Lookin' like I'm drinkin' piss
How's he fuckin' thinkin' this
Easy, I'm a mentalist, but I'm not on CBS

Uh, yes it's me Bam-B
What is your daughter to do?
I've been doing this ever since Harry Potter was new
Boy! I don't play, I change games, I am too real
So my words stay hard like a blue pill

I like pink, it always looks good on me
And I like pink, it always looks good on me
That second part I was talking about vagina, homie
Fuck the game at an early age, now there hymen on me

Yes, I am a magnet
Yes, I do attract it
Remember when these fake ass niggas called me faggot?
Cause I had glasses and a pink track jacket
Now those things are assets to help me get some asses
Now these nerdy hoes keep asking me to smash it
Bullies from middle school chatting on my Twitter status
Fuck you, you don't get shit from now on
Unless you got a demo tape, then I can lay some brown on
It's the B to the AMBI, colors like candy
Nigga, I'm the Army. I'm being all I can be
Yes I dress dandy. Get a Klu, like the Klan B
I live hard, I never sleep in, like an Amby

This is for the niggas thinkin' different
While their friends are flippin' pigeons in they're stay po-pimpin'

He never lets the best go past him

Sound the Alarm Remix,Black Milk,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Black Milk]
Yeah, uh, just when you thought it was safe
We came back to brawl and feel like you fought with an ape
But walked in his cage and can't get out
No way out, lost, feel like you walked in a maze
And yes, trying to walk a mile in my shoes is a waste
You couldn't even walk ten paces
Yes, I already ran that race and
Already came in first place and!
Black Milk, I'm like a horror film in the makin'
Spit that Freddy verse Jason
Believe when I say niggas move when I weigh like all comin' police car chases
Move, it gets that ugly
The bitch want money, but she can't get that from me
No, sound the alarm on em'
Still gunnin'
Sound like the fire men coming

[Refrain: Black Milk]
Hands to the sky
Get them high
Detroit make the world go round'
[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9""]
Nothing else left to do but be the best with it
All I need is respect with it
It ain't gon' stop
I put your flow in a bullet
Put it in my gun
And pull it like I'm playing roulette with it
It ain't gon' pop
I put your brain in the blender for trying to figure out
How to enter the train of my thoughts
You ain't a contender
Why you still starvin'
I can put my hand on my dick like I'm still a star
As long as I feel large
I'm the real raw
Niggas can't kill God
Most incorrect politically next to Bill Maher
Arrest me, try to correct me with bars
Me, Black and Guilty next years' tsars
I'm bout' to put you fools on a diet
Put your food in a ring
And then I'm crownin' the biggest loser the king
Nigga try to try me then I'll prolly try to body these mobs
Then after that you gotta sound the alarm

[Refrain: Black Milk]
Hands to the sky
Get them high
Motherfucker let's go
[Verse 3: Guilty Simpson]
Study the game and hit the ground runnin'
So when I start
Show you rap cats how to play that part
But we ain't actin'
They play him but he ain't crackin'
The same ol' same
With a verse so soft I sleep on it, the night off
When a nigga tries to speak on it, come again
Be in the streets, man
Fuck a benz
I got a three digit for the number man
Cause when the scratch run out
Yeah, Tre five-seven watch stack come out
I got a keen ear, boy, latch your mouth
Or repeat what you said while I'm at your house
But we don't knock
Kick through both locks then inflict bodily harm
Gun in my palm
You cats ain't even lukewarm
Man, sound the alarm

Hands to the sky

Feng Shui,Gnarls Barkley,"['hip hop', 'pop', 'r&b', 'blues', 'jazz']","[Verse 1]
In this house the decor is the obvious obscure
You can see clearly the theory of less is more (less is more)
A plant, a pet, and books on a shelf
And a frame on the wall where you can
Picture yourself (or someone else)
And you're welcome to stay
But even your company must complement The Feng Shui

[Verse 2]
Ah, even down to what I have on
They do wonder to what extents I have gone
Tailored and tapered, contoured to the curve
Demanding the attention that it does deserve
Fabrics for the forecast of the day
I admit it, everything is fitted to fall in Feng Shui

[Verse 3]
But more importantly the way that I move
If I'm in your town, my needle's down on the groove
On sight, they know my song
And it ain't slow and it sure ain't long
You see, I do not play
Forgive me father, I was forced out of Feng Shui
[Verse 4]
A flow as subtle as a summer breeze
Like the whispering winds and the talking trees
To big to be boxed in, it bobs and weaves
It evolves, it solves, it gives and receives
And everything I say is calculated appropriated
Written and arranged in Feng Shui"

Uh, pardon my small talk, darlin' I'm all talk
They wanna fence me in, never a ballpark
We tear the wall off the Waldorf Astoria
I told my dudes to get to steppin' like Gloria
I made my case, she a slept-on jury
And when I go from deep I be like Stephen Curry
The lines'll hit you sharp, it got the teflon worried
So I told her that I cruise homes, yep like Suri
So I woke real early, grab a bagel and a glass of joe
The he-man, woman hater, I'm a Ras-a-cal
And Alfalfa, my hair stickin', it lost control
'Cause I'm a rapper, but she more into the classical
Uh, no need to apologize
I'm 21, but I been dreamin' 'bout the college life
So when she looks into her father's eyes, shouts to Eric Clapton
I'll be the director, 'cause I'm all about the action

You're so damn beautiful

Oh, you drive me mad
And I come right back
From your head down to your toes
I want you all alone
Oh, you drive me mad
And I come right back

You say I'm spellbound, I hardly spell out
The four letters that make every girl just melt down
We on the shelf now, no Sam Goody
And when you mention other dudes, they no damn Hoodie
'Cause we go truly hard, stiles like Julia
And I been gifted since a youth like I'm at Julliard
When we were younger, you were cooler
You and your friends used to rule the yard
A moment flicked by, I wish I was McFly
Marty with the sick ride, I'm able to switch time
No second guessin' decisions on why I pick sides
So ex-nay, only talkin' 'bout my insides
Always up to somethin', so we annually home
This song is dedicated to my January Jones
And it's a Space Jam, they say that I'm Michael
Lovin' under twenty's a cycle, so here we go

Ain't havin' none of it, you gonna sit and say
No love for triple A, okay she's gone away

Woo! Yeah
It's 50 a.k.a. Ferrari F-50
Break it down
I got a lot of livin' to do 'fore I die
And I ain't got time to waste
Let's make it

[Verse 1]
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You ain't no friend of mine (Yeah!), you ain't no kin of mine (C'mon!)
What makes you think that I won't run up on you with a 9? (Uh-huh)
We do this all the time (What?), right now we on the grind (Yeah)
So hurry up and cop and go, we sellin' nicks and dimes (Uh-huh)
Shorty, she so fine, I gotta make her mine
An ass like that gotta be one of a kind (Woo!)
I crush 'em every time, punch 'em with every line
I'm fuckin' with they mind, I make 'em press rewind
They know they can't shine if I'm around to rhyme
Been on parole since '94 'cause I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did a three-to-nine
The D's ran up in my crib, you know who droppin' dimes
[Chorus]
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you don't never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'

Damn, homie
In high school you was the man, homie
The fuck happened to you?
I got the sickest vendetta when it come to the cheddar (Uh-huh)
Nigga, you play with my paper, you gon' meet my Beretta
Now Shorty think I'ma sweat her (Uh-huh) sippin' on Amaretto (Yeah)
I might hit once, then dead her, I know I can do better
She look good, but I know she after my cheddar
She tryin' to get in my pockets, homie, and I ain't gon' let her
Be easy, start some bullshit, you get your whole crew wet
We in the club doin' the same old two-step
Guerrilla Unit, cuz, they say we bugged out
'Cause we don't go nowhere without toast, we thugged out

[Chorus]
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you don't never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'

Me I'm no mobster, me I'm no gangsta
Me I'm no hitman (Yeah), me I'm just me, me
Me I'm no wanksta, me I'm no actor
But it's me you see on your TV

[Verse 3]
'Cause I hustle, baby, this rap shit is so easy
I'm gettin' what you get for a brick to talk greasy (Woo!)
By any means, partner, I got to eat on these streets
When you play me close for sure I'm gonna pop my heat
Niggas sayin' they gon' murk 50, how?
We ridin' 'round with guns the size of Lil Bow Wow
What you know about AK's and AR-15's
Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and inf-beams, huh?

[Chorus]
You say you gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'

Why? Cause I ain't supposed to be chasin'
Girl tonight, you nothin but a temptation

Damn girl, why you dressed like that again?
Leave it at ya cleavage. Why you showin' off ya tat again?
Struttin' 'round like you done forgot what your daddy said
If it ain't for sale, don't be lookin' like a mannequin
Huh. But now I'm sittin' here mad again
Cause my thoughts are goin' dark like Anakin
Me and my girl back together
Tryin' to do better
But tonight it's lookin' like I'm 'bout to ruin that plan again
Damn, and I don't know who to blame
That blouse or the bouncer that'll never make you pay
Uh. Team player and you bring your own subs
The reason why I never bring my girl into the club

That's why they always show you options that you can't pick
Think you can't get, unless you got a fast whip
And a condo. Can afford Salvatore Ferragamo
At least two weeks of eatin' out at Maggiano's
Best I could do is eat you out and take you to McDonalds
So I just keep my eyes closed and try not to stare
Cause that shit I'm really after is called my career
Right now I'm in the rear, where I'm just about to take off
And you just want a child so you can make a pile and take off
Usually I break off, but if I'm on bad behavior
I'm fallin' into sin, and the Trojan Man my savior
But I really need Jesus

Yo, What's the science with it?
I'm talking all white cuffie, Cartiers and a Lions fitted
I used to want a huffy and to try and get it
I was cutting grass like a motherfucker, I admit it
That humidity was literally heavy
In the wrong place get chased like Chevy
Niggas broke like levees, and they talking 'bout the finer things?
My celly steady he get his calls from a lot of queens
I'm by the book, botta-boom botta-bing
A lot of kings, a lot of rooks, ain't no pawns on my team
Stay calm in between, this shit is a balance beam
One hand wash the other
A suntan cutie came to me and was like ""Damn, Mike no wonder
You must have switched cribs, I ain't seen you all summer though""
Damn baby if you want to know
I got the same phone number and trees if you want to smoke

[Hook: Latif]
The way it's coming out I'm feeling like it's going to be a summer song
So why don't you go ahead, turn it up, put one in the air or something
A pair of fresh J's, Cartiers, throw them in the carry on

Put the pen to it and do you a favor, it's major
Ice water dripping with the flavor
You can't copy, drinking Asti Spumante
We scoop sand up from right under the palm tree
And then let the wind blow it away
Because that's representative of how we're doing o.k
I'm chill, first hit the elevator to the lobby
They're partying like somebody's going away
But besides all that though, I'm a slick cat, smooth gato
Hate jalapeños on the nachos, they're too spicy
Hop out the old school with the new Nikes
Blue like the Tampa Bay Lightning
I like them old joints though, new cars don't excite me
Except that R8 or the Aston Martin
It was looking like a shark when I passed it in traffic
Double dutch jumping on the corners when we passed it

Tell Me Goodbye,Mac Lethal,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Fake laughter
Fake laughter
Fake laughter

Yeah, it's funny isn't it

I'mma dark storm cloud thats floatin' over top of suburbia
I''ll bust, if you act all determined
I'm waterin' my garden with some black bottle bourban
So open up and listen to my rag water sermon

The universe is mine, a few disturbing times
My ouija board told me I should go back to bed
So I could sleep some more
I didn't disagree the world is too gruesome
I'm far too beautiful to care about the revoltion
So get youre fire out my face and don't follow me, dipshit
Your whole entire existance is so opportunistic
I give a damn about the damage to the body from botox
Who cares get the fuck off your soapbox
I got a fresh pair of nike shoes
And I like 'em so much
I wanna thank the sweatshops in china too
Yeah man, it sucks the world is a war
But what the fuck you preachin' in my face about it for
I think that it's a cunning motif
How you be floodin the streets wit propoganda
All about how there's no justice or peace
But one thing you never mention
Is how you do it all for your own damn attention
Come on man, you wanna be an activist be a real activist
Chorus(2x)
Tell me goodbye since you cannot rely
On sympathy from me cause my tear ducts are dry
Look in my head for the sadness you seek
But you won't find a piece that will make you complete

I'm sick of trendy ass political rappers
Got me scribbling chapters I deliver for the cynical laughter
Nowadays every godd damn little disaster
Needs a dedication song about it doesnt it (yeah, YES!)
Yeah man, fight the power fuck the government
Thats a great message but I smell your lies under it
Yeah I see you acting all conscious gettin passionate in rap songs
But truth be told you take tragedies and latch on
Hopin' it'll garter you new fans
Every other day you probably prayin' when you walk to the newstand
That someone had a meltdown and bottom or two
Blew a head gasket flipped shit and shot up a school
And not two hours later theres a song up on your website
All about the tragedy and how you haven't slept right
And all sorts of other cliches and dry phrases
Youre dancing on corpses hoping to get famous
..go ahead and cash in your anti-war songs sucks

Chorus(2x)
Tell me goodbye since you cannot rely
On sympathy from me cause my tear ducts are dry
Look in my head for the sadness you seek
But you won't find a piece that will make you complete
How can I eat such a harmless animal
It's easy first I kill it then I throw it on the grill
You think I got time to give a fuck about disorder
When the doctor got me overmedicated on these pills
Call me a labrat, call me apathetic
Call me anything you want, call me everything you will
Just let me have one single day to myself
So I can fantasize that the chaos is not real
And....

Tell me goodbye since you cannot rely
On sympathy from me cause my tear ducts are dry

A Cool Breeze,Mac Lethal,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Man Talking]
""And here's another hi-fi collectors item with a heart warming story""

[Verse 1:  Approach, Mac Lethal]
The vibe of the vivrant, read'em when my eyes met
I'm complex with content but compliment the consciousness
What's common sense?
My kinda current condiments carry up from ???
From all the venom you spit...

With indigo flames I'm supposed to sear the tips end
My ultra proteus associate is close to disappearing (WHOOP!!)
To a labyrinth where ? can spit flows and
FREEZE the tongues of backpackers and hip clones...

I miss those wonderous times and glorious rhymes
When young shaun only had to ponder which pond to skip a rock on
Days were long indeed but I sit back relax and enjoy the cool breeze...

FOOL PLEASE!! life is more than holstered gats
If I'm supposed to fear death God is smokin crack
Plugged to deftone
Put me in your rock band and I might pierce my tongue through the headphones
Red phone...
The M die, eeeehhhhhh
The mission excel to spell the riddle
Stupid tales and riddles
I was delivered to the middle
To add a little fizzle to the chicken on the grittle
Seasoned bright in the thick of the night...

Chisel with a pen full of coin flipped wit
Impale my body on a skyscrapers pointed tip
At cold angles
I feel right to lay down designs like snow angels...

[Chorus: girl singing - repeat 2X]
A cool breeze flows in my new wasp
Some get stung it's worth the cost

[Man talking again]
""If your record player has come this far without visible damage
You've got yourself a wonderful piece of equipment.  And all kidding
Aside, you're entitled to hear some of the truly amazing things that
Your hi-fi phonograph can do.""

[Verse 2:  Mac Lethal, Approach]
Like, hairy hand Approach to beat little girls up, with large ??

Mother nature is a manic depressive
And father time is a dead beat dad with excessive drinking problems
Now he's lost and swerve and talk and slur
And slipping on the earths frosting surface
But I'm walking perfectly
Shiiiit those are like the two perfect words for me
But if I'm a waste that you never felt
Then I'ma hang your vivid dreams with my leather belt...
Coughing gets ridiculous
So many men are envious before I even drop the disc
I hear the silent hissss
Approach feels he's better than us man he's stuck up
Marked for death if I dare to compete
I just move to a different beat
Kick it with schemes see
To post streets for the homies can eat
It's really not that weak but for me theres nothin better
The warmth of the rhythm is protection from the weather...

Yeeap, and we don't even want the retribution man
We're laughing at attempts of your public execution
Acting all bitter with your frostbitten souls that's it case closed
You're gettin pigeon-holed...

And it's silly though
Cuz we came from the same womb
The rush of emotion put your soul in the dark tomb
What's left to loom
Is negative air but your forgiven bro
Cuz there is a heaven up there...

[Chorus] - repeat 2X"
Midnight in Manhattan,Mac Lethal,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","
This is the worst thing I've ever seen in my life

(Our elected representatives are the frontlines of making the decisions
About the war we're waging against terrorist
And about rebuilding New York
And there's nothing like it
We don't want anyone to feel in a week or two or a month
That the enormity of this somehow could be gotten over
We can keep going and we will but...)

Waiting for the snow to fall a cloudy angel wept
And while the world was frenzied, by my fate I overslept
Hold your breath, these acts are frozen and embraced
With the gut-twisting feeling of a black and white mosaic
Today Manhattan burned and summer leaves without a trace
Besides a cloud of smoke and sour smell in outer space
Without a face I hate you
Today I was instructed how to hate but then remembered how to pray too
I kneel enforcing nine commandments
Scratch one and let it sleep on the crescent moon like a hammock
Align the sky with fireflies and crooked-eyed soldiers
The morning dew is fearsome while the Bush is iced over
The cushions lie holding souls of man-made ghosts
Cascades of darkness keep the lamp shades closed
Crickets even whisper for September 11th
I eavesdrop and hope to hear footsteps from heaven

When moonlight french-kisses the Manhattan midnight
There's not a face without a tear drop that's in sight
Midnights in Manhattan keep me dreamin
I caught a dream by the tail, I think I'm gonna keep it

This is the first time I've ever hated something through the night
The first time I've ever loved this country in my life
Hibernate for days and leave the nest to touch rain
Stretch across the world and feel my bib of bloodstains
Talkin to the icicles hangin from the clouds
Purple moon dust vapor strangle for the proud
I'm dyslexic reading minds of those computed
Who saw an angel-kissed urban rose and chose to shoot it
Notes for students of the Blitzkrieg, Polish torture
I got a heaert for you that grows inside my olive orchard
I understand a lot of spirits on remote control
Mislead youth grew with charred and broken souls
Damn I'm speechless, dreamin of the somber, sandy beaches
Where I can drift away from suits and ties repairing demons
Where I can fly from corporate crashed and buried kingdoms
And hold my hand to God but do more than barely reach him

[ Hook ]

Blow a kiss to the rain clouds while I rest in bed
If I give blood now I might have less to shed
If I shed blood proud, is my spirit in agreement?
Will I be dying for a reason that I do agree with?
Freedom is a teardrop with legs like a centipede
That walks out of God's eyes when I fight or sit and bleed
I could sit stone-cold and panic in stride
Plant it inside to hide away until the planets collide
Of course, of course, of course, I grab my sleeping pillow
And creep to steal to eat a still life self-reflecting weep and willow
This is not the time for music, it's not the time for movement
It's not the time for pushing all the people I'm unglued with
It's not the time for birth of glory
It's not the time for purgatory
It's not the time for murder stories
It's not the time for keeping peace or cleaning your knives
It's a time to figure out the meaning of life
And that's it

Calm Down Baby,Mac Lethal,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
This is for anyone wishing they could do their entire life over:
Quit sulking, you fucking pussy
Yeah yeah yeah, clown on my accent all you want
I'll whoop your cat's ass. I'll whoop your grandmothers ass
I'll whoop your sisters ass. I'll whoop your ass
I'll beat your moms ass. I'll kick your ass

[Verse One]
Its the anti-socialite not-so-christian
That'll talk more shit than bitter and old women
On puny ass rappers with little-to-no rhythm
Fuck veganism give me some General Tso's Chicken
I write weird songs that got hooks like Journey
And if I grew my hair out I'd probably look like Fergie
But I'd never tinkle in my pants while I was on stage
Cause I was potty trained when I was four years of age
I think a lot of people these days are bitches
I also think that emo and emotional are different
But more so I hate white girls that talk like
""Aww hell no, girl I'm gettin' this shit crunk
You know what I'm sayin'?""
I'm not jokin', it's nothing but bark, I feel lost
Can't remember where the fuck that I parked
The world is gray and blue but what skates me through
Is knowing that I have a better music taste than you
I used to like Tool until they made the same album
That they made the last time they made the same album
Every time they make a damn album its the same album, really
And only stoners listen to their music, it's silly
I still think the Deftones are dope
And I like Nick Drake on the days I wanna let go of hope
Wilco is great and Ice-T is still clever
And no matter what its ALWAYS Wu-Tang Forever
[Hook] [x2]
Calm down baby
Don't you talk because
Calm down baby
Don't you talk because
I don't need lovin' and I don't need help
I'd rather ride in the car by my goddamn self

[Verse Two]
I'm 25 I started rapping as a sophomore
In those days I'd hide my cigarettes in my sock drawer
Until I heard my mom snorin' sleeping on the green couch
And then I'd secretively sneak out
My first taste of heartbreak was at the park late one summer night
I had a big crush on a girl named Sarah
I was gonna ask her out until I saw Tim Phillips kissing her grabbing her butt
Asshole!
I was madder than FUCK and walked home
Oh, Tim Phillips smells like Cool Water cologne
Well fuck him, his Mustang and all his other friends
I vowed I would never love again
And since then I've dated but fuck that I can't give nothin'
I'd rather sail alone than have my damn ship sunken
Being single's par for the course
I don't wanna cause a marriage
Cause I don't wanna cause a divorce
Its probably important and its better for health
Besides, I get the whole damn bed to myself
But what the hell everybody yells for me to drop down my guard
No! this heart of mine's for me, it's locked down and it's scarred
Go home, I don't need me a wife, I'm happily single for life
Alright?
My name is Mac Sheldon I'm a fire-sign Leo
Alcoholic, anti-mall, anti-hero
Anti-soccer mom, anti-hipster
Pro-eating Captain Crunch cereal for dinner
Pro-taking bong hits to cure your depression
And pro-demo CD
If you got one let me check it
But never ask me what the hell I'm laughing about
See ya later
I'mma go take a nap on the couch, alright?
[Hook] [x2]
Calm down baby
Don't you talk because
Calm down baby
Don't you talk because
I don't need lovin' and I don't need help
I'd rather ride in the car by my goddamn self

[Outro]
Gee, Mac... what are we gonna do about this Kansan accent of yours?
Well, self, since you're asking in the third person
We're gonna fuckin' keep it!
Because it makes us pretty... and unique... and beautiful. Like birds!

I'll whoop your mother's ass"

And strolled in followed by two females
This watch on my wrist like a new CL
And this Mont Blanc got me with a brand new smell
Swagger of a boss, bitch can't you tell?
I can fit 30 G's in these YSL's
I don't wear Guccis, I wear Cazals
So I can get that 86 D Boy feel
Baby I can tell
That's prostyle gel
Followed by a microwave ponytail
Not only can you not have my cell
But you can't have my fax or my email
Never been to prison, never been to jail

Even though I'm already high as hell
Shades on my face, so it's hard to tell
Is that MAC lip gloss or Chanel?
I met baby while eating Taco Bell
I had a number one with the flour soft shell
Her mexican pizza had me under her spell
Next thing you know, I was getting head and tail
Sex is the thing that I do so well
I will bang that pussy like a hammer and nail
I keep a few O's on a brand new scale
Holla at Ya Boy, I got zips for sale

Keep another on deck in case the first one fails
Never been a snitch, never been a tattletale

And dipped through sets like my name Hell Rell
Fast and furious, so the car fishtails
Police right there, but I'm like oh well
I'm the shit round here, nigga can't you smell?
I win every time, never took an L
I'm murderin' hip hop, I'm gon' need bail
Rest in peace to Pac, B.I.G., and Big L
Smoke good shit every time I inhale
And spit real shit every time I exhale
The flow like a .38, very special
And my looks make the hoes chirp like a Nextel
The charm on my chain heavy, like a dumbbell
This is how we do it, like Montel
Keep a couple clips and I'm not Pharrell
So you can get touched like the blind, Braille

Under The Hood,Specifics,"['hip hop', 'jazz', 'blues', 'r&b', 'pop']","Verse 1: Golden Boy
Here with a dilemma
A dip with an umbrella out my cellar
Let her in quick, the medicine sip, whatever
I'm clever on some accapella shit, that's my main strength
But never been too bad, as well, at this gettin brains thing
I think the light's dim
Not the type to fight gin
And bent like, psyched to hit the bed and strike skins
Right then the phone ringin, but left it-
Blowing in the night like the west wind crescent
My preference is a heavy snare
Yes, instead of some soft shit, got a sweaty pair of breath mints
The stars be glowing
We spark weed, holdin hands and a cold beer be the cardio and stamina
Top physical condition when I'm kissin
Switchin' my footwork, I cook birds chicken
She took off my cardigan, told me start again
I'm gettin more bad bitches than Mad Martigan
With no candles, R&B stanzas or glamorous clothes
I rock no-brand sandals
I'm dealing with fans, you're dealin with man-hoes
It's romance - and more porn than Sancho
I never snuff lights
And havin' rough nights, but I must live up to my rep, right?
Touch ice, but my blood warm
Snuff any nickname, when he gets semi-drunk it's a fuck-storm
And some more couldn't hurt
Mix up love and war like porn, rum and Pepsi One for a
Skirt yikes, but I just wanna get done nicely
And yo girl your skirt's what entice me

Ask you if you love it so, if so, it's on

And yo it's all good

Verse 2: Golden Boy
I heard it through the grapevine
Word's groupies got the eyes on the crew
And psyched to get attached loosely at the waistline
Booty makes my day, yo
The bassline boogie nights gotsta groove crazy with them cutiepies
Seventies shit, you bet me, I will never be rich
I need to get me a celebrity bitch
Check this kid can't afford Hennessy
But swish many more cheap 40's than you weak whores will ever sip
And rap effortless blessed with a certain effervescence
The better beef-curtain spreader specialist
Specifics, yo, don't get it twist
Drove chicks to my coastal getaway ocean precipice
Tryin' to get to paradise no asparagus
Just a pair of dice, dominos and some Sheridan's
Solid gold providence
In the hottest nights, get the halls hyped wall to wall with a squad of hoes
And all of this
A life of pantyhoes, expansive heights, patios and random fights
Yo my boys got cameos
Dance in the rain with phantoms all happy like we back again
I could never end it better than the last LP
So take a picture actually, let the image help me
Remember when it fade, like a dream
And I pass my name, and dash off yo to rap with demons

Yo, I'm a do it like this

Streets of New York,Kool G. Rap & DJ Polo,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
In the streets of New York
Dope fiends are leanin' for morphine
The TV screens follow the homicide scenes
You live here, you’re takin' a chance
So look and I take one glance, there’s a man inside an ambulance
Crowds are gettin' louder
I wonder how the people wanna go fight for the white powder
People hangin' in spots
They waited until the blocks got hot and got raided by the cops
I’ll explain, the man sleepin' in the rain
His whole life remains inside a bottle of Night Train
Another man got his clothes in a sack
'Cause he spent every dime of his rent playin' blackjack
And there’s the poor little sister, she has a little baby daughter
Named Sonya, and Sonya has pneumonia
So why’s her mother in a club pullin' zippers?
Yo, that’s her job, Sonya’s mommy is a bar stripper
Drug dealers drive around lookin' hard
Knowin' they’re sendin' their brothers and sisters to the graveyard
Every day is a main event, some old lady limps
The pushers and pimps eat shrimps
It gets tirin', the sound of a gun firin'
Then there's desire for the sound of a siren
A bag lady dies in an alleyway
She’s seen the last of her days inside the subways
More and more down the slope, the kid couldn’t cope
So he stole somebody’s dope and a gold rope
Now my son’s on the run
He’s a wanted one who had fun then was done by a shotgun
Upstairs I cover my ears in tears
The man downstairs must have drank too many beers
'Cause every day of his life he beats his wife
Till one night she decides to pull a butcher knife
Blind man plays the sax
A tune called “The Arms on My Moms Show Railroad Tracks""
Many lives are cut short
That’s when you’re livin', in the streets of New York
[Break]

[Verse 2]
Baby needs new shoes
But his papa uses all the money for booze
A young girl is undressed in the back seat of a caddy
Callin' some man daddy
Three men slain inside an apartment
All you could see was the sparks when it darkened
Daylight broke, cops roll on the scene
The drug war, daily routine
Gamblin' spots, just a poor man’s jackpot
You winnin' a lot, you get shot
The drug dealin' fanatics, but you don’t want no static
'Cause they got crack addicts with automatics
Shoot-outs for a desire for territory
A kid got caught in the crossfire
A tired mother can’t take no more
She grabbed a bottle full of sleepin' pills and took about 24
Human beings are layin' on the pavement
'Cause they’re a part of a mental enslavement
The cop snipers, little babies in dirty diapers
This type of life is makin' you hyper
People scoutin' a torched-out building
And got killed when the cold air filled in
Is Hell really suggested?
No more persons arrested, a child molested
A little kid says ""Yo, I got a color TV, CD player and car stereo
And all I want is a castle, I also got a .38, don’t give me no hassle""
One kid heads straight for the top
And gets stopped and popped by a crooked cop
Look behind you when you walk
That’s how it is in the streets of New York"
Cash and Carry Me Home Remix,Ghostpoet,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Ghostpoet]
My hand grip whiskey like a newborn child
Last night I must admit it got quite wild now
Morning's approached and I wrestle with a headache
That was spawned in hell by the devil himself
Now I was not quite clear
But I wonder what shenanigans brought me here
While I'm cryin' out loud and I'm feeling quite sorry for myself
I need to check my health
Cause I ain't mashing no one but myself

[Hook: Ghostpoet]  [x2]
I know we fuss and fight, yeah a little bit
I've had a couple drinks, well a little bit
I'm beggin' you
Just carry me home

[Verse 2: Ghostpoet]
I'm all on my own
Smashed up my phone
Not sure of whereabouts
My mum kept on callin' me just tellin' me to sort it out
Sort it out?
Mum look, readin' books and takin' tests won't take away the pain in chest
The aching limbs decide to vapor, sparked up your cigarette
Lookin' out the window at the world
I just ain't ready yet
Such things just get me stressed
Grey hairs are springin' up and I'm startin' to shake a bit
I'm still got some whiskey left, maybe I'll just take a sip
[Verse 3: Kano]
Maybe you just make me sip
And that's why I do outrageous shit
I love my fans, shake my hand
But maybe they'll stop taping it
There's accusing and proving shit
There never should've been that youtube clip
That stupid prick can two-two clicks
And you viewed it like Subaru quick
So, I'm out of my mind
Baby, I'm trained bubba eighth like a child
But I aim when I write
Carry me, nowhere I'm staying the night
Barkin F-1, they get a life
Stop making a fight, I'm saving your life
But lately babe, I can't say buh-buh-bye
So I stay with the lime, salt, and patron

I know we fuss and fight here a little bit
I've a couple drinks worth a little bit
I'm beggin' you
Just carry me home

I'm all on my own
I've kinda lost my throne, I'm absent from the scene
I'm searchin' for a way in life, I'm lookin' for a theme
A plan or a scheme, a road to a better place
I'm splashin' water on my face
Wake up lazy bones
Please just take me home
Wake up lazy bones, please just take me home
I'm out of my comfort zone, the liquids wearin' off
Now I just feel alone
Now I just feel alone
Now I just feel alone
Now I just feel alone
Now I just feel alone

I know we fuss and fight, yeah a little bit
I've had a couple drinks, well a little bit
I'm beggin' you
Just carry me home

I know we fuss and fight, yeah a little bit
I've had a couple drinks, well a little bit
I'm beggin' you
Just carry me home

Alright, is everybody ready? (Yeah!)
Alright, now, here we go

[Verse 1: Consequence]
Ayy, yo, good morning, America, good morning to Erika
Who gave me good head while watching Good Morning America
Good day, New York, have a good day in court
My niggas drive around the hood lookin' for good yay to snort
I never liked the goodbyes, always caught a good vibe
Always had a good time, could always spot a good guy
From a good guy with good lies lookin' liable to try
You know that old sayin', what they say about good guys
I guess that's why I went bad, needed all my chicks bad
Fiends needed hits bad, so they hittin' licks bad
Had to get that work off, before that shit went bad
If not, it gets bad, and things'll only get bad
So now I'm gettin' bad scans, and I got that bad jam
Tellin' me them bad sense, songs catch them bad breaks
Caught a bad rate on the whip with bad brakes
I'm caught up in these bad ways, havin' a bad day
So now the game's ugly and my pain's ugly and my chain's ugly
Things became ugly 'cause my ugly rugby
Got a stain and it's musty, wakin' up lookin' crusty
And Ms. Thang who's ugly is sayin' to me, ""Don't touch me""
I went from Pretty Willie to pretty silly without the pretty gully
So you know things'll still get pretty ugly
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
[Chorus: Kanye West]
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said, ""Get your money"", ain't no tellin' they gon' love me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
When your money get funny and them days ain't sunny
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
Niggas give pounds and hug me, know they really wanna slug me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this is for the hood, you got to love me

Good morning to um, I don't remember your name
But I remember the brain, here go a fare for the train and
Good morning to Chi-Town, where my niggas ride down
To bust clowns and look for some bust downs to bust down
Yeah, she ain't got a car, she on the bus now
But her gear is bangin', she one of us now
I wanted badly to bone, 'cause she was bad to the bone
She from a battered home, she mad when she at home
So I gave her my number to peep off, she wanted to take a week off
Bustin' Scary Movie nuts, I had to get the freak off
That new Tom Cruise to the Moulin Rouge on a too-long cruise
She said, ""I ain't bonin you with them too long shoes"" And acted bougie in a Grey Poupon mood
So I'ma act cheap in a coupon mood
She said, ""Ye, you don't love me?""
I told her it was good, it's too bad it got ugly
[Chorus: Kanye West]
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said, ""Get your money"", ain't no tellin' they gon' love me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this is for the hood, you got to love me

[Verse 3: Consequence]
Ayy, yo, good morning to Queens, the Northside is my scene
And when it comes down to it, I'ma ride for my team
See, it's a beautiful life, but these bills'll make it ugly
And the beauty of life is when you're forced to make it ugly
Had a beautiful night, 'til a storm done made it ugly
And a beautiful wife, now we divorcin' and it's ugly
Now my mind state is ugly, when blind dates are ugly
And I'm ready turn it up in these streets, and make it ugly
Used to sit in Mr. Ugly's with these sisters that was ugly
And these bitches used to bum me to the point it made me ugly
And say things that was ugly then leave the bar, abruptly
But I took it all back, 'cause God don't like ugly
Now I'm curbin' my bad words and say that's a bad burn
I left it on bad terms with a chick with a bad perm
Who case took a bad turn, her face caught a bad burn
And took the news bad when they said she had bad germs
The bad thing about the bitch is bad and 'bout it
But the pussy smelled bad, so I had to get up out it
So now we got bad luck, our son is a bad blood
But it happens in the hood when you inherit that bad luck
And once you get bad, it be bad for good
And that's bad meanin' bad, not ""bad"" meanin' good
But I agree that it's good, when you leave with the goods
It's all good in the hood, I call G.O.O.D. 'cause it's good
Now I'm havin' some good nights, livin' this good life
Got me a good girl that I'ma make me a good wife
So I'm good to go, and I'm good where I go
'Cause my man got good aim and that's a good thing to know
And he came off for good, off of good behavior
Spittin' that good game, so what's good with this paper?
'Cause this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Ayy, yo, we showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said, ""Get your money"", ain't no tellin' they gon' love me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
When your money get funny and them days ain't sunny
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
Niggas give pounds and hug me, know they really wanna slug me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly

Let's push things forward
[Verse 2: Mike Skinner]
As we progress to the check point
I wholeheartedly agree with your viewpoint
But this ain't your typical garage joint
I make points which hold significance
That ain't a bag, it's a shipment
This ain't a track, it's a movement
I got the settlement
My frequencies are transient and resonate your eardrums
I make bangers, not anthems
Leave that to The Artful Dodger
The broad-shouldered fifty-one percent shareholder
You won't find us on Alta Vista
Cult classic, not bestseller
You're gonna need more power
Plug in the three-phase and the generator
Crank it up to the gigawatts
Critics, ready with your pot shots, the plot thickens
Put on your mittens for these sub-zero conditions
But remember I'm just spitting, remember I'm just spitting
Once bitten, forever smitten

[Chorus: Kevin Mark Trail]
You say that everything sounds the same
Then you go buy them
There's no excuses, my friend
Let's push things forward
You say that everything sounds the same
Then you go buy them
There's no excuses, my friend
Let's push things forward
[Verse 3: Mike Skinner]
Spit jewels like Eastern riches, junkie fixes
Around here, we say ""birds"", not ""bitches""
As London Bridge burns down, Brixton's burning up
Turns out you're in luck, 'cause I know this dodgy fuck in the Duck
So it's just another show flick from your local city poet
In case you geezers don't know it, let's push things forward
It's a tall order, but we're taller
Calling all maulers, back street brawlers
Corner shop crawlers, victory's flawless
Love us or hate us, but don't slate us
Don't conform to formulas, pop genres and such
Sharp darts, Double Dutch
Parked cars, troubles are much
With more bud
Let's push things forward

[Chorus: Kevin Mark Trail]
You say that everything sounds the same
Then you go buy them
There's no excuses, my friend
Let's push things forward
You say that everything sounds the same
Then you go buy them
There's no excuses, my friend
Let's push things forward"

Damn, This is a keeper, I'm taking over this game
Leggo !

[Verse 1 - M.D]
I got your girlfriend on her twitter
She retweeting bout my dick
She got cameras on my bathroom
And she's peekin on my shit
Drove to LA just to tell me she want to get on my tip
Drove the whole way to NY to tell her friend I licked her lips
Now shes driving to Miami to tell you she takes her shit
Now shes driving to her hook up to say she fakes every shit
She thinks that she goin with me
But I leave her like some lit
Cause Im driving out to every bar I know there is a bitch
And she sits on top of my broom, now shes flyin like a witch
Every stripper find a pole when I come cause they know Im rich
Every bar I say is hotter than the previous I spit
I take planes to everywhere in Europe to take some few sips
And Im driving through the city, and them haters always trips
Damn, I killed this like Im Red Rum, haters know that Im the shit
I was born up in a pussy, and I think Ill die there too
Man, I take these bitches they're in love in, damn, it makes them blue
Damn, Im done
[Middle Intro - M.D]
No, I ain't done like the song, only the verse, Leggo

[Verse 2 - M.D]
I ain't done anything offensive to make you haters cry
Damn, you crying in the corner cause your girlfriend told a lie
Weve been doin this shit before you connected like Wi-Fi
But we thought it would be better, if she didn't say byebye
But the 3 years weve been hookin up, I guess that we were wrong
Im just tryna put you up some things, Thats why I wrote this song
And I made your girlfriend breakup with me, cause she found her thong
And this girl that I am talking up, Ill tell you later on
We were goin at it, like Tiger was cheating on his wife
Im a player, pussy is the most important in my life
And Im cuttin through this critics like warm butter and a knife
Now Im gonna tell you bout the girl I hooked up with last night
She came up to me while I was sippin rose in this bitch
Said her was Allison, or something, I just watched this bitch
Then she came up to me, said ""Hey M.D, I know that youre rich
But I bet that I can make you scream for my pussy like shit""
Then I said, ""Well I can get it on with you for just this night""
Ive been sippin champagne, I bet I make you feel alright
Then I said ""god damn it, this is like the pussy of my dreams""
I swear life is better than these rappers make it seem
Im a lonely wolf, and a prince I dont need no queen"

Yes, yes, ya'know

Whatever your favorite brand is, it's whatever you wanna do
You know what I'm sayin', but um, you know

We ain't always have it, you know what I'm sayin', so
This what we had to do, to look fly you know what I'm sayin
This is how you used to get it in

[Phonte]
Aiyyo, I used to go to the mall with forty dollars in hand
It ain't matter at all cause I could go see my man
Down at Southsquare Mall workin' at J. Riggins, oh no
Manager leaves, he let me cop from the lo-lo
Slacks and polos, you better watch that
Boy in Durango's, blazer, and mock neck
Almost broke but you still gon' see him
At the T game pimpin through the Greensboro Coliseum, man
[Refrain: Phonte]
Uh, cause now I got on my good clothes
I'm sick of wearin hand-me-down, raggedy hood clothes
Call me ugly, man I wish a bitch would clothes
Go out to the club, yea we probably should clothes
Yea, uh, say I got on my good clothes, what
Uh, say I got on my good clothes
Yo, forty dollars I done got me some good clothes
I got on my good clothes
I got on my good clothes

[Rapper Big Pooh]
I used to go to my mom, like I'm tryna be fresh
Told her, look at my closet, you know, your boy look a mess
So we hopped in the car, headed straight to Sears
At the time I was bigger than the rest of my peers
As we got on the floor, was embarrassing, trust me
The saleswoman walk me straight over to Husky
I still got stonewashed denim, Bobby Brown patent leather
Members Only jacket, ain't nobody fresher than me

[Refrain: Big Pooh]
I said I got on my good clothes
Sick of wearin hand-me-down, raggedy hood clothes
Call me ugly, man I wish a bitch would clothes
Go out to the club, yea we probably should clothes
Yea! I said I got on my good clothes
What? You know I got on my good clothes
Husky jeans, patent leather, I want those

Yo lemme talk to 'em Pooh
Check it out, yeah
Y'all lookin good tonight
But some of y'all that's in the wrong, I cain't front
Like you at the bar, it's hot in this club man
So why you got that leather coat on, dawg
C'mon, take that coat off, nigga
And you, the big girl with the low-rise jeans on
Got the fat hangin' over the side, better go to Lane Bryant
Girl, you got your gut bustin' over the side of your jeans
It look like a muffin
C'mon now
Let's be polite

[Rapper Big Pooh]
I got boxes of shoes, get shirts by the caseload
Size 48 jeans, how did they make those
New Eras we take those, givin us good clothes
Nothing when you broke, when you ain't you don't spend dough

[Phonte]
I had a homie at Azzure, but he got tired
And another at Stall & Dean, but he got fired
So ironic when you want it, you the last on the list
But when you get cake, they cain't wait to give you some shit
Nah I'm sayin'

Uh, cause now I got on my good clothes
I'm sick of wearin hand-me-down, raggedy hood clothes

Yeah
Yo, you know we had to come from overseas on this one
It's Hoodie Allen
On this beat beat-down
Say what up to VV Brown
Y'all let's get loud
R.J. drop it

[Verse 1: Hoodie Allen]
Yeah, I gotta shorten up my words 'cause I speak fast
Girls got me caught up like a recap
She's always high scorin', nobody can beat that
But talk's cheap, so consider this my free rap
A free app, but nothing is free really
There's a shark in the water, I'm ready to free Willy
Why so serious? Better we be silly
'Less she turn a cold shoulder, I'm ready to be chilly
Damn, let's work it out girl, this is gym class
Let me tell you 'bout the game like Jim Nantz
'Cause there's a whole lotta fishes that I swim past
But I can't wait to drop, Slim Fast
Thin glass between us, I did my best to break
I was so convinced that I let the rest debate
I known a lot of girls, always said it's best to wait
I never been a snoop, dog, don't investigate
[Pre-Hook: VV Brown]
When I'm in doubt
I open my mouth
And words come out
Words come out like

We good, we get it
We love where we headed
So we live to regret it
We don't ever care
We, we don't ever care

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
We met in Vegas, so that explains it, I rolled the dice
Saw the writings on the wall like I'm notified
We sayin' no to fights, always acting so polite
But now you're cursin' me out, okay, that's poltergeist
Okay, it's no surprise, name change, pronto
Just 'cause I'm a rapper that don't mean I'm in Toronto
'96 Honda with a drive like Rondo
If I'm racin' for your heart I'll never tie like kwon-do
Yeah, you get Mad Men, so that's advertised
But who's the illest, that's me, like Amanda Bynes
So if you gold diggin', don't worry I handle mines
I let you paint the picture vivid you've been vandalized
'Cause I'm a male, I'm a man, I be Karl Malone
I done some good deeds, I'm leavin' the karma 'lone
So if you would, please, don't leave this bar alone
We got far to go but we never far from home, oh

Gifted flow and presence, man I’m the new Santa
And uh, I’m saying Kansas where I’m staying
Where niggas be bang-bangin' like Pops on the Wayans
And even through the hating in walls they thought I stay in
Psh, who you playing? I done went Super Saiyan

You just a door, man, door man, damn, I wish I had more hands

My solo discography, I’m building it
Now every time you hit the space bar, I'm killing it
Yeah, I’m so fucking awesome, 200,000 was paid to out-floss ‘em
They don’t wanna follow my lead, I gotta force ‘em
To keep the competition in line, you gotta sort them
Fire engine red in that drop head
Haters drop dead when I’m in that bobsled
Cover girl on my side and she bobs head
Saying yes to my denim as she nods head

I think that I kill 'em, play possum
Death proof, ride around with Rosario Dawson
Tell 'em open wide when they see how I'm flossing (ching)
Cooler than a peppermint, Wayne's World excellent Party on Garth (shwing)
Work ethic harder than a Mexican
That's why I can walk up into any restaurant and close the whole thing
See? Even G couldn't F with it
Semi-colon, dash, parenthese, text message it
That's a side smiley face ‘cause I'mma make the best of it
I assume you should make room for the elephant
Boom, where I come from is irrelevant ‘cause my glory is all that I revel in
And my story begins where most others end
So all I really got to tell ‘em is…

Do you ever see that stuff that be
When it get cold
That ice that you can't see?
See that shit happens sometimes
Yep
Black ice

[Verse 1: Big Gipp]
Now you know and I know
I done bumped every hole in the wall, y'all
Did you catch that phone call?
Most of y'all that met me thought I was tall
Gipp flipped like a dip, slipped, fell on the black ice
Did you think twice? Homeslice came and he went
Satisfied, got bent, bars ain't shit
Mutant, coast to coast, yeah, I laughed and boast
Man, do-si-dos, too many comin' close to

[Hook: Big Gipp]
Touch what I never touched before
Seen what I never seen befo'
Woke up and seen the sun
Sky high, sky high
[Verse 2: Big Gipp]
Circulate like a Sunday paper
Capers caught long time, to cheap flicks, good picks
Paid hard, watch the hard turn sideways
Cook the 'tail for real sales to those who lose cash
Players keep your life for now
Feeling good and warm, windows rolled tight
Thirty-five degrees, nippy tonight
Don't forget the ChapStick, lips dry quick
When the jack out, make you wanna act out
Take the slack out, some people black out
Hibernatin' 'til we came back out

Touch what I never touched before
Seen what I never seen befo'
Woke up and seen the sun
Sky high, sky high (Sky high)
Touch what I never touched before
Seen what I never seen befo'
Woke up and seen the sun
Sky high, sky high

I been in it for the past few days
Tighter than fades, I'm knowin' my plays
Now can I rap? Can I adapt? Not really sure yet
Who that lookin' over the shoulders of those writin' dreams?
Fiending for the taste of menthol
Missed class, stayed in the hall
Lookin' for a squeeze play, better, yet a holiday
Stayed away from the pyramid board game
Broke it down to a neighborhood slang
Cash before fame

Sky high, sky high
Sky high (Sky high)
Sky high (Sky high)
Sky high (Sky high)
Sky high (Sky high)

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Now who done stepped in?
The nigga, the B-I-G, the secret weapon, boi
Slicker than Black Ice, throwin' these flows like rice at weddings
So quit flexing, we speakin' about
Something that's refreshing to the earlobes
Pay for the room and still be in pimp mode
Like Iceberg, Chryslers and Buicks
Some niggas ain't on they jobs so them suckers here to lose it
Abuse they privileges and now the whole village's been shot to pieces (Pieces)
'Cause niggas are biting that same stupid shit, I mean that feces
Boy, don't beep me, if you ain't got no work (Work)
I'm strictly 'bout these verses like the ones you hear at church, boy, search, boy
Talking about your dough is long like Lurch, boy
Every time I heard you rhymin' like a fucking jerk, boy; simp
Yeah!

[Verse 5: Andre Benjamin]
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your eardrums
It was a beautiful day off in the neighborhood
Yellows and greens and blues and browns
And greys and hues that ooze beneath dilapidated wood
Ain't a thing could explain what pertains
To cocaine and sustaining reign
See, summer rolls around, niggas holler bout change
Then they steady move them keys like Bob James
'Cause old man winter's arrived, the temperature dives
November just died, December's alive
Thus it ain't no typical ride
Just individuals' way to bring home
The bacon when bacon was all gone
Making it our own, taking me all wrong
We've all indulged in the bulge of those no-nos
No, you ain't solo, there's even lower levels you can go
Take sun people, put 'em in a land of snow

Seen what I never seen before
Woke up and seen the sun

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine, all mine
I need a girl in my life

[Verse 1: P. Diddy]
Yo, I'm internationally known on the microphone
I got it all, but I really need a wife at home
I don't really like the zone, never spend the night alone
I got a few you would like to bone but
Chicks that romance me don't tickle my fancy
Only Tiffany, Nancy, that's not where my plans be
Need a girl that could stand me, raise me a family
Go from trips to Delancey to trips to the Grammy's 'cause
Most of these girls be confusin' me
I don't know if they really love me or they usin' me
Maybe it's the money or maybe you ain't used to me?
'Cause you was depressed and now you abusin' me
That's why I need me a girl that be true to me
Know 'bout the game and know how it do to me
Without a girl on my side, shit'll ruin me
Forget the world, girl, it's you and me
Now let's ride

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride (Ride with me)
I need a girl to make my wife

Nobody else, she’s all mine

Yo, now I done met a lot of women in my lifetime
But see it's not a lot of women that got the right mind
I done had pretty chicks with all the right features
And hood rat chicks that only rock sneakers
Cellphones and beepers and know how to treat ya
You break her heart, she'll walk out and leave ya
I find a girl, I'ma keep her
'Cause now I'm gettin' money and the game gettin' deeper
Yo, on some real shit, I need somebody I could chill with (Let's chill)
I need somebody I could build with
I need somebody I could hold tight
Winter time in a full-length Snow White
Anytime we together feel so right (So right)
You the girl I been lookin' for my whole life
God, bless me, I'm glad I got the insight
Because of you, girl, now I understand life
I need a girl (I need a girl)

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride (Ride with me)
I need a girl to make my wife (My wife)
I need a girl who’s mine, all mine

I need a girl to be my wife (My wife)
Nobody else, she’s all mine (Yeah)
I need a girl in my life

[Verse 3: P. Diddy]
I had a girl that would've died for me
Didn't 'preciate her so I made her cry for me
Every night she had tears in her eyes for me
Caught a case, shorty took the whole ride for me
At first we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl, we was like brothers
All night we would play fight under covers
Now you gone, can't love you like I really wanna
But every time I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn, I wish you would've had my child
A pretty little girl with Diddy's style
Shit is wild
All them days that I reminisce
About the way I use to kiss them pretty lips
But as long as you happy, I'ma tell you this
I love you girl and you're the one that I will always miss
I love you, yeah

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine, all mine (Mine, all mine)
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else, she's all mine (All mine)
I need a girl in my life (Girl, you mean so much to me)
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride (Ride, ride)
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine, all mine (All mine)

Nobody else, she's all mine (I just want you)

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride (Ride, ride, ride)

Come Back To You,Charles Hamilton,"['hip hop', 'alternative', 'pop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
I'll always, come back to you
I'll always, come back to you
I'll always, come back to you
I'll always, come back to you
I'll always, come back to you
I'll always, come back to you

[Verse 1]
I dead ass wrote two drafts of the same song
Thinking that you'd laugh if I came wrong
You mad at me automatically
So I'mma say my part and move back where I came from
Funny cause I came from the heart where we started
And you came from the heart when we departed
This is garbage as hard as this is distance is nothing to us
In fact its been apart of what makes us, us
I could be five minutes away you would be drifting away
A kiss on your waist was replaced by a spit in your face
If the day should come when I wasn't being your fuckin puppet
I used to do my dirt and think nothing of it
Cause at the end of the day we made up; I fucking loved it
I'm not an angel; far from the devil
But my heart isn't metal; it's fragile
[Hook]
But I have to come back to you
I got to come back to you
I have to
I love you
On everthing I love you
You don't remember everything

[Verse 2]
First kiss was as sweet as the last goodbye
And thats why I have to ask you why
You have to say goodbye and I have to cry
Bitch, I know you feels the same way
Sorry for calling you a bitch, but bitch you hurt me
I need you. never would I leave you
You would tell me lies and you know I would believe you
Yeah, sometimes, I'm mean to you
I know when I'm your headache that other guy is Aleve to you
But you know what Aleve could do?
That shit kills a headache is natural
Not to be an asshole, but baby you need me
I mean, piece by piece, as this liquor deceives me
It's easy to see why you want to leave me
But fuck that! I'm your greatest, your latest
And you're the heart rapist. I can't take this
Just listen as I vent I told you forever
And this is what I meant
This is what I meant
[Hook]
And this is what I feel
And this shit is real
This ain't what I want to feel
I don't want to deal with this shit with you
I ain't even with conceal shit
Hitting the ceiling and shit

[Verse 3]
I can't see you with any nigga
I'm making moves for us. bitch, you don't see the bigger picture?
When things get right I'll be getting with cha
But now I'm going crazy fuck drying tears. come swim in this river
Come drown with me. get lost and found with me
I'm sprialing to hell. come down with me
Fuck the past. Celebrate now with me
How can we, honestly, not give the time that we
Spent like it was your last check from your greatest asset
Stocks for our anniversary
We're too deep in to shove me off the deep end
You're shallow. I'm an asshole we're even
Why the fuck you talking 'bout leaving?
I ain't Usher. I ain't letting shit burn
This ain't the Matrix. I ain't Fishburne
I don't know the world's greatest mysteries
All I know is that you're It for me
I love you girl we got history
[Hook]
None of this other shit means shit to me
Just trying to build another dynasty
So please look in the eyes of me
Look into every thing else
Stop looking at yourself
Stop being selfish

[Outro]
I'm trying to say
I'm tying to say I'm not irreplaceable
Fuck all that shit man
I hope Beyonce got you'll thinking
Stop listening to people
I stopped listening to my friends so long ago
I started loving you, what the fuck you want me to do
No matter what man, no matter you can pick a female
I ain't going nowhere else, you know I ain't going nowhere else
Is it that easy to walk away, and we waste all this time
Stick with it, I stick with everything else
I work on me you work on you lets work together I love you"

You can say I blue’s you, better than I bruised you
All you niggas copycats, doing shit I used to
Oh you tatted too, nigga fuck you
My bitch ain't got no tats, I hit it from the back
I spend South of France, all that other shit is whack
Sling shot it in the ear than I let the shit collapse
Money is my pet peeve, give me hourly
If there is none at all, then I’m pissed off

I’m Leonardo in Inception, reserve my section
I do dreams, put you in a Bubble, Benz or Lexus
I Will Smith the necklace, I do it effortless

Money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga jealous, then the motherfucker dies
Figure you ain't scary if you did the crime
Now prepare, it's dinnertime, dimmer the lights, lemon with ice
Look in it twice, it's fizzling Sprite

I just burnt my American flag
And sent three cracker Nazis to hell and I'm sad
Ugh, I'm loading tips in my Mag'
To send these redneck bigots some death in a bag
Choke him out with his confederate flag

Smart Went Crazy,Atmosphere,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Slug]
Smart went crazy, truth went trendy
The story got lazy so I rewrote the ending
Manipulated the entry, more user-friendly
Now a city full of pain pills and tattoos defend me
I waver from the dead to the half-dead
Grey space between the fan base and the crackhead
Sunset, sailboat set course for hell
A cross and a hammer, but you'll have to get some nails
Take credit, for anything embedded in the edit
As long as you meant it when you said it
And all of the kids laugh, when you admit that
It mighta been witchcraft that made my noose fit bad
Well I'mma act like I don't give a make love
Take what I got to teach everyone to break stuff
I'mma act like there's poison in the pancakes
And amputate the one that wasn't loyal with the handshake
Proud to know ya, Minnesota missile
Never sold coke and I never had to hold a pistol
Civil and simple, but set the freak show loose on the nipple
Watch her whole fuckin' titty ripple
It's why we battle, it's why we travel
It's why the mascot thinks that I'm an asshole
We made the team without puttin' on a uniform
Smart went nuts and rode a unicorn through the storm

Smart went crazy, but where did you go?
Smart went crazy, but where did you go?
Smart went crazy, but where did you go?
Smart went crazy, where did you go now?

[Verse 2: Slug]
Smart went crazy, kissed Miss Daisy
Loved you when everyday was Christmas, baby
Maybe, we can take it back to the way we was
Still on some ""What have you done for me lately?""
No gravy if the bass is porkface
Tour dates ate my big little brother's court case
Poor taste got passed off as gourmet
This beer is foreplay
We'll meet up at your place
I sting like a first divorce, or them first Newports
Whatever hurts you more
""You're headed for self destruction"" been there, did that
Kicked back with the wrong angel to fuck with
Carved my charm into your arms
Fuck around, unravel this tall ball of yarn
Snuck round back to disarm the alarm
From the plantation to the reservation to the farms
And nobody knows where you'll end up
Only guarantee in life is death or a headfuck
Yeah, you thought it was a set up, well guess what
Now you can catch up with the rest of my ""Best Of""
I got a few blocks left before I reach my destination
And retrieve my breath
And God blessed every step I stole
Just to let me know, she wouldn't ever let me go

[Outro: Slug] (4X)

This goes to those that hold it down 'til I get back

Go to school, read a book, be a lawyer
Hell yeah man I'm all for the cause

Hit the gas on it, pull up and mash on 'em

They keep asking me questions, like ""50, who shot ya?...
You think it was Preme, Freeze or Tah-Tah?""
Nigga, street shit should stay in the street
So, keep it on the low

If Suge was home, Death Row would be good for me
Cause Tommy Mattola ain't shootin out in the hood wit me
I've been shot 9 times my nigga that's why I walk funny
Hit in the jaw once, why I talk funny
With a Ruger on my hip, I walk the street with no care
Think my grandma's prayers the only reason I'm here
My wrist icy, keep my ears icy, keep my neck icy
That's why you bitch like me, son I'm a heavyweight
How dare these niggas take me lightly?

She was with her man, he took a drag from her cigarette
He told her he'll be back
He jumped in the meter cab, just took her cell and told her where to meet him at
Now she was mad, And I was looking for my car
She had some plastic bags, coming from the supermarket
Cooking for his ass..how she gone get to the projects?
She ain’t got no cash, and she struggling while walking
So I drive past, ""Yo"" I say ""I ain’t no stalker wit yo big ole ass
Here’s my help I’m tryna offer, I give you a lift""
Who woulda knew it turn to this? Now we in the mix
Baby moved up in my crib and she left my ex, damn we speedin

I’m a king, you the queen

You don’t have to look back at him
Just get your bags packed and then..

He was 3, yea I took him in
Now she call him little me, I even look like him
Naw, I mean he look like me, a couple shades darker
She be calling him Blackie..that’s cause his real father jet black
So she treat him like it’s a setback..
I don’t respect that
Now his pops calling collect at the new crib on the new number
Now how he get that?
See, now I knew we was a mismatch
I’m laid back, you too used to getting pimp smacked
I see where I went wrong at
I just tried to bring out the queen in you..
But when you make a girl leave a man..
You never really know where she stand..

And she leave out that room feeling like a paraplegic ha
My fuck game is my capital feature
I stuff her ass up like a pair of new sneakers
Back to the subject at hand
Baby, I’m a wealthy ass young black man
Flow more rare than finding black sand
And I just want some brain like a fucking cat scan
I just want some paper like a fucking trash can
Life is a maze, so hows it hanging pac man
I seem to amaze, as well as advance
I’m so far ahead I gotta save the last dance
[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]
Get it strait like pans as I enhance
M.O.B I’m all about my chips like Lance hehe
I be with animals, with animal tactics
I swear I’m backed up like New York traffic ha
You dumb fucks, you're nothin’ but lunch ducks
Big nuts here swinging like nunchucks
Hollygrove I’m claiming it like insurance
I been on the grind nigga you are just a tourist
Flowers for the dead, say hello to the florist
Fuck with me wrong, bet I rush ya like Borris
Now they tryna kick it but I ain’t Chuck Norris
I kick it with lil flu and he rollin’ up a forest
Can’t be compared no, I’m not a thesaurus
Can’t be banned I’m sorry Miss. Delores
Fuck Wendy Williams the bitch look like a dude
Her body look chewed and her hair looks glued
But let me get back to my food
Eat the track up and leave the mic barbecued
Why in 30 lives would you ever war with I
I’m just getting high, thinking bout Tha Carter V
My homie’s straight, my mama good, and my daughter's fine
And everyday I pray and thank the great Lord of mine
Weezy Baby you're looking at greatness

I' changed?...
You motherfuckers kill me....
I've changed

It ain't that I've changed
But it's strange how you motherfuckers rearrange
When I found fame
Point ya finger at the bad guy!

You know what my momma used to tell me
If ya can't find something to live for...
...then you BEST, find something to die for

'Cause a bottle of juice... it's not something to die for
Young Quaid, remember that name...
'Cause all you motherfuckers
That go to your grave with that name on your brain
'Cause jealousy and recklessness is NOT, something to die for

All you niggas out there (echoed laughter)
Look how the cracker crumbles
When I say 'all you niggas' (all you niggas)

Unite
One nigga, teach two niggas
Four niggas teach more niggas
All the poor niggas

I'm getting rich while you stayin' broke
Chillin even if I'm in a goose down coat
I can't see you through a Mosley Tribes
So I don't even flinch when you throw me high fives
They try to measure up but there is no one my size
Whatever 40 smoking about to lower my eyes
Beast mode on em, I never take a night off
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off
Grounded as the runway pavement I take the flight off

I ain't picking up an' entertaining them at all
Got your girl face down banging on the wall
While you and all your homeboys hang at Lenox Mall
Hmm, hmm, hmmm
I cannot relate
Riding with some tags that I got from outta state
Riding with a swag that I got from outta space
Just show me who's the hottest I'mma knock 'em outta place
Call me ""Homicide Drizzy"", I'm about to kill your ego
I'm about my green, puffin' goodie like I'm Cee-Lo

Nas Will Prevail,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
It ain't hard to tell, I excel and prevail
The mic comes in contact with the third rail
My raps react, they attack the wack just like a maniac
With this, see, I'm a brainiac
I'll call you tattoo, you never come off
I flip the script with a sawed-off, boss
A modern Shakespeare—reincarnated
Brains are elevated, I'm bein' R rated
This style is terror, drastic
Meltin' the plastic, and I eat mics just like acid
Burn your pen and pads, mics you'll need not
'Cause I be packin' like a Rasta in a weed spot
Hittin' your heart with a hollow-tip, verbally illin'
Minds manipulated, my raps are nickel-plated
I execute rap like I'm swingin' an axe around
This is a mic shut down
Notify the President that I'm bombin' your residence
And I'm leavin' no evidence
Voice box yells, lyrics'll excel
Rappers gettin' smoked, you can smell the hot shells
Your style is fake, snake, well dramatized
You might as well be a singer but ain't harmin' Nas/harmonized
Here's the break, I'mma translate lyrics so well
I excel, it ain't hard to tell
[Hook]
It ain't hard to tell

[Verse 2]
I got a case of vocal fever, I'm here to make you a believer
Nas wrecks the tweeters and receivers
Lyrics'll explode, my brain overloads
Gimme a Grammy, competition is dead just like Sammy
I leave minds magnetized like slaves
Your style is old fashioned like waves
Holdin' a pistol at a pastor, pullin' the trigger faster
Tell him I was sent by his Master
But that topic's too deep for your ear
Here's the science you can comprehend clear
Advanced intellectual, a time bomb speeder
I'll know your whole card just like a palm reader
Non-stop, I'm bustin' heads like the FEDs, baby pops
This is not the Kindergarten Cop
Put on your blindfold, I'mma release and stand tall
I detonate bombs at the Policeman's Ball
This is art from the heart
I leave 'em marked for death in each breath
In this game, I'm the ref
Already I'm ill, but I can only get better
With lyrics as pretty as a nickel-plated Beretta
I master dialects of uncommon languages
A black man caught by the Klan couldn't hang with this
These are proverbs, copy cat attackers, huh
I'm wanted dead 'cause I'm a genocide to rappers
Battlin' Nas is dead when my brain reacts
You might as well have fell asleep on a train track
This ain't the same track that you're used to
This is rhythmatic, automatic, try it, you oughta have it
Slaughter your tape recorder, givin' thanks to my supporters
And keep flowin' like water
No matter the obstacle, Nasty Nas will prevail
Ayo, it ain't hard to tell
[Hook]
It ain't hard to tell

[Verse 3]
Check it
I catch wreck with my intellect, suckers are incorrect
I'm gonna win 'cause you slept
On Nas, word is bond, I leave the microphone torn
False rappers, you need to write your own song
Metaphors are murder, man, hittin' like Roberto Duran
Hold the mic in my hand, my life span
Imitators will sweat me like gym class
Your raps are fat, shit, then I'll be Slim Fast
New rap recruits—I salute then delete 'em
Verbally eat 'em, because my ears don't need 'em
Nas is a terrorist, analyst
Swingin' my fists like a nigga breakin', possessed by Satan
You couldn't compete with a beat that was fast or slow
Brothers is gettin' shipped out like I was Castro
I can eat your flavor, but I'm not a candy lover
I use a Lethal Weapon, just like Danny Glover
I execute monologues, sabotage entourage
Mutilate mics like a maniac at large
I talk with slang, and use my brain
Generate pain, penetrate your vein
Move like a maniac, Nas is nice, son
Talk to your conscience and hit like Tyson
No competition, 'cause I cause wonders
Nas will battle rappers by the football numbers
A motor mouth killer, rhyme-writin' thriller
Hold a Mac-11, and attack a reverend
Don't sleep 'cause you might not wake
I speak deep, dialects I translate
Me and friends commit sins on the regular
Murder my competitors, and et cetera
Nas is a gypsy, Egyptian
Flippin' the script and microphone manufacturers are victims
My voice makes your ear drums swell
It ain't hard to tell"

Using dirty syringes...

Hand me the green nigga this is where my five is at
Verse four (Sam-R)

Its 11pm and its the weekend
I got some weed and I picked up three friends
Yea, we cheif'n I need a schmoke and a pancake
Takin hits off the spliff until we can't stand straight
In that case I blast through the ceiling
Slap god a high five, this kush bush has me feeling
Pretty fuckin lifted my head in the clouds
Wit a blunt in my mouth I doubt i'm ever coming dowwnnnn

From California to courts, it's over, God, told taste the soul food

Still shame on a nigga who tried to run game
Your version of perversion, fuckin' bitches on Persian rugs
Washin' niggas like detergent, it's the surgeon
Slugs propels from Bobby Steele's twelve gauge

""Hell up in Gotham, take heed and protect your seeds""
You fall like autumn leaves
You lack tranquility in your rap utilities to fuck with the abilities
Race like a sperm cell to the ovary
Microphone post tone like a rotary phone
Ancient poems of poetry
Old scrolls, explosive head bullets
Black hooded, Timberland-footed ninjas
With full metal jacket clips and know how to put it in you
Surrender your goods and your merchandise for no purchase price
I'm certainly a heist for your ice is curtains, advice
Come quietly, Wu-Tang Clan rules society
Because of variety, so maintain your high anxiety
And lead them to defy me, diary, ya irie?
I need eighteen points on my next joint
This high anointed king to make a deal, I be the one to appoint
Steve Rifkind must've been sniffin'
To catch somethin' so dope it left Monica Lynch pussy drippin'
I fuck hundreds of bitches and spent millions of dollars
And built with thousands of scholars
My life saga from the hill to the harbor
Legal 'caine grind like Nicaragua
I gave birth to MCs, thieves and bank robbers
We drove expensive whips and took worldwide trips
And my dick's been sucked by the finest lips
Fancy delicatessens and the world's best refreshment
But none of the above compare to the 120 Lessons
Or my queen and my seed and the homes that I rest in
Enter my zone, get blown in ninety-nine sections

This rhyme has no limitation, this time there's no hesitation
Collectin' minds at the door

Bite the bullet, niggas is fowl and it's duck season
We at odds 'til we even, motherfucker
Bad asses, high time, lower classes
Taste mine, straight shots in dirty glasses
Bring it to 'em, room service
Under pressure and mad nervy

Keep them sick niggas seven-thirty
Picture this, watch the birdie

Pins and needles, needles and pins

Yo, my ice look fly upon the keyboard, son
Niggas ran up on me, lord, praisin' what we do by the laws
That's right, exile the fake, hit them niggas like weight
Feed 'em food, let the fake evaporate
Reconstruction, that's the whole science on my production
Y'all niggas guess who stuck, son, left his nuts hung
Switch, finger itch, starin' at you like a bitch
Maybe y'all niggas snitch
You's a loner, Adidas shell top while I sip a Corona
Read the Robb Report, then bone her
Buy you some jewels, here's some food
Not necessarily mean to be rude, boo, check out the analoo
We into mushrooms, chase the Heineken, the custom
Baggy jeans, thick ropes, god, slidin' through customs
Chill, y'all niggas know what time it is

Every days a Vaca M.I.ami like Dade
And we ain't ever clean up cuz baby I got maids
Young money we so paid and if you ever get hurt baby I'm ya band-aid
While im lookin at you never worry bout nuthin (cuz girl I got you)
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil' Chuckee]
Shawty, I'm here any time that you need me
Fasheezy
I'm here to make your life Easy
They say every good dude theres a good lady
And I have mine already ain't no need to keep lookin
And when I'm on the road you come to my house
And walk my bulldog,and help my moms out
And play wit my sister you know I love that
Thats why what ever you want I'mma cop that
Im Rashaad, you my NewNew
Im ya Will Smith,baby you my Jada Pooh
And when I'm in the studio you come chill with me

If we had a team id be Reggie Bush you'd be Kim Kardashian your bodies so amazing
And when im not with you I'm on my iPod
Bumpin forever my lady (I love ya)

Niggaz Done Started Something,DMX,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'alternative']","[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Yo, ayo let's get papers and pop Mo' with hoes up in skyscrapers
In condominiums, overlooking our drug capers
New York City, know only way to play is gritty
I want cheddar, so we can front up in the 850
My whole committee like to puff L's and look jiggy
Who wan' test this? My semi leave you chestless
And ain't shit that you can say to me when you be breathless
Young, but I done did shit that you won't do
So go ahead wit the bullshit you blab about goin' through
I got niggas who pump on yo' block and in your spot
Who sit next to you? Protectin' you?
But they'll murder you, playa
Don status, nigga we gettin chipsesis
And bad bitchsesis, fronting, fronting in eclipsesis

[Verse 2: Ma$e]
Ayo, Ma$e and The LOX
We taking knots from the out of state spots
Any nigga make it hot, get found in vacant lot
You don't really wanna come try, the one guy
Who stay dumb high from blunt lye
The Rikers, Sing Sing alumni
Who got more beef than a Islamic farm
So I pack enough sonic arms to neutralize atomic bombs
It's not a nigga in your gang want it
My AK slay gays, spray strays wit niggas' names on it
Often I bug, then bust off on a thug
Have a chump coughing blood, fill his coffin with slugs
Yo, you know I got enough guns to wreck a nation
Any nigga wave a TEC at Mason, have a explanation
You bring your crew and 'em and I'm doing 'em
Then I'm beating 'em down with aluminum
Then I'm putting two in 'em
You can't touch me, I've been devil sent, wanted for embezzlement
A lot of other things, but that's irrelevant
[Chorus: Styles P & DMX]
If you love the money, then prepare to die for it
Niggas done started something
You can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it
Niggas done started something
If you love the money, then prepare to die for it
Niggas done started something
You can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it
Niggas done started something

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Yo, check out the kid that get coke like Sosa
Never turned down chocha, be in the Costa
Rica, sipping margaritas with a mami
Cleaning my Tommy, showing love to my army
Whenever The Lox find rippy blocks, we kill 'em
Yeah I hear niggas, but I still don't feel 'em
And this for the listeners, and prisoners
And them jealous rap cats that prefer dissing us
My 16's be so real
You can feel 'em in your vein
Like Ramello's pops from Sugar Hill
J be the cause for the kiss at your wake
Cartel lips, spitting clips at your face
We started from the bottom, you'll see beg niggas' pardon
Whatever, we can do it at the Garden
Word life, this shit is real, B
I'm making niggas blow trial even if they not guilty
[Verse 4: Styles P]
I want a palace for my thugs, with oriental rugs
Green bags from drugs, get whacked for the love
Twenty niggas batter me, still couldn't shatter me
I'm only getting up, splitting up your anatomy
Official LOX family, grants niggas handing me
I want the finer things, and I hope you understanding me
Sitting at the table, planning and plug the fan in
Let the sweat dry off and then grab your cannon
Think you're smartest, and retaliate the hardest
Regardless, if you're a thug or a rap artist
Respect me like Pesci
And if rap was hockey, I be Gretzky, puffing Nestle
And y'all niggas done starting something
Acting invincible like you God or something
If you God, then I'ma make salat 'til you rot
And if you a playa, then play for everything you got
And if you a thug, then start busting off shots
And if you a dog, you better bite before you bark

[Chorus: Styles P & DMX]
If you love the money, then prepare to die for it
Niggas done started something
You can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it
Niggas done started something
[Verse 5: DMX]
Don't come at me with no bullshit, use caution
'Cause when I wet shit, I dead shit, like abortions
For bigger portions, of extortion and racketeering
Got niggas fearing, fuck whatchu heard, this what you hearing
How much darker must it get, how much harder must it hit
See if your hardest niggas flip, when I start a bunch of shit
I like pussy, but not up in my face, so give me 3 feet
'Cause when we creep, no more than 3 deep, niggas see sheep
Bloodhounds found your shit buried in the mud
Following traces of gun powder, residue and blood
A positive ID is impossible, so you know
John Doe is what they gon' be putting on that tag on your toe
Now who gon' tell your mother, her baby's under a cover
In the morgue, stiff as a log, sniffed out by the dogs?
Another hardheaded nigga that wouldn't listen
So you got what you came for
(What's that?) Surgery with the chainsaw
I hit the fucking streets
'Cause, like I said before, ain't nothing going down until I eat
Muh'fuckers think it's all about impressing bitches and stressing bitches
Well, I'm testing bitches game, undressing bitches, and caressing bitches
And dealing with muhfuckers on all levels, what I'm dealing with is all devils
Fucking with snakes running with niggas you call rebels
I got an army of 730 niggas, dirty niggas
That come through and worry niggas
30 niggas that like to bury niggas
And scary niggas get it all the time
'Cause what they got is all of mine, your man was talking shit until I pulled the nine
And if I don't know you, I don't fuck witchu
And if you with my man, then he getting stuck witchu
And gave it the money, 'cause I just lost my mind when he crossed the line
Sent his back through his chest then I tossed the nine
Boss of crime, black Gotti, I stack bodies with the black shottie
Bitch-ass niggas that act snotty
Get it

[Outro: Interviewer & DMX]
These niggas is for real
These niggas ain't playing
This ain't no fucking game
She think we playing?

Lord help me make up my mind
Which way do I turn when there's so much stress
Surroundin' me daily? This world's so cruel and shady
And I really do miss my baby, Baby Boi, oh boy
Me and yo' bigger brother we keeps it realer
You'll always be our lil' nigga, and I know yo' mama miss ya
Picture the day when I get my callin' but until then

Little T, know I miss him much, when I get to heaven Baby Boi, What's up?
We can ride and roll, I know
Without these Po-Po trailin', bailin'
All the way to heaven betcha that's a promise
Comin' with tha bombs (bombs)
Niggas can't test us, creep defeat is all ya meet
Rollin with tha niggas that pack the heat
And a sack of weed, straight out of control
Testin souls, hoes, niggeroes, playa haters
And tha po-po as well, Nigga need Mail, everybody need mail, and we livin' in hell
Nigga really can't tell, So I, Prepare for the worst and I hope for the best
And the rest as written, some wanna treat me
Like I'm forbidden, but I'm just lookin' for the shit that's hidden
Could I be? Come a little bit closer
Why you cautious when you approach us?
Is ya scared of tha fact we soldiers?
Mo' Thug Records finna take shit over
Under my halo pray mo' say Mo' Thug wit love
To tha depth that tha game goes

Thuggin, love sick, my hood is in drug prison
The end, is my mission, we heatin shit, why vision?
Been crooked, red handed sin is beginnin of my endin
I went in my benz, but, Why is my mind spinnin?
And then I'll say hey, fuck it
My family ain't livin' for nothin'
But strugglin was one of the reasons I'm thuggin
And steady stayed hustlin, where was my lovin?
Somebody tell me somethin, good for nothin
If I give you, what'll you touch?
Will you fuck it all up for the love of lust?
Hoes, I love you so, but unlike my friend you're just my foe
Peace till the end of the road, that's where I'll go
But no, nigga don't lose your soul
But it's so cold, Trust in mine, alright then we can roll.[roll, roll]

Was ya, too young, mama, and daddy, when ya
Lay down and had some eggs?
I remember y'all breakin' up
And shippin us off back to the land, damn
What went wrong? Was it me? But I ain't mad at'cha
Cause outta all that shit I got two sista's and a brother
And I learned to harmony
On the streets, of tha Clair, that's where
I'm from y'all, on the streets of tha Clair
That's where I met Bone Thugs y'all
Aw shit, time to be a man
Gotta get out tha house cause I can't stand mommy's man
He talks with his hands
Come come creep on tha streets with me
That's where I learned how to sell drugs
It's where I learned how to pump slugs
It's necessary, necessary for me to get down for mine
So I creep and I grind
*knock knock* kickin down doors
Kill a nigga, sleep
Give it up or your dyin
And I know that shit was wrong but
Don't blame me, blame tha thugsta in me
Cause that's where that shit comes from [comes from]
Bloody red rum, nigga, we nuttin' but survivors
Rest in peace to the gang that collide with us
We survivors,that's why we be..

Get ready to duck bitch or get fucked up boy
Don't fuck around and get zipped in a body bag
Off in the grave and yo brains'll be hangin'
Damaged bodies dragged offff
Everyday we see mo' niggas hatin', fakin'
Playa hation, it's getting contagious
Why do these niggas think they can break us?
When I grab my pump y'all niggas
Better try to grab what's left of your chest
Niggas be talkin' and then they get caught up in shit, now meet them faces of death
We let'em keep talkin' man they dogged us man it's all the same
But what do we gain by givin' you niggas fame?
So we let the record show
Tha 44 mag'll tag em
Stack up them niggas who try to compete with the platinum
Harmony, callin me, follow me down to me corner
Slip up and ya gonna get blasted
What do you wanna test me for? Jealousy, nigga drop
Nigga we betcha plottin, that's why them triggaz be cocked, every time!
Shoot em, 99 times out of 100 we gon' hit somebody
Somebody gonna take a strippin, yeah!
Y'all niggas get carried off wit them bodies, mo mightiest
You'll find us, smokin' that grass
Nigga pass tha pump, hey RIP, they takin a loss and wakin up in that coffin
Oh we gettin at all of these playa hatas man, but when we come they run
But we're gonna catch'em and one day God forgive me
I don't know what got inna me, but pin me nigga, they'll all fall down
Way down face down, ain't got nothin but love
Still niggas wanna test my nuts
Sayin' nigga you know that[that, that, that]
You know we didn't know that, that

Take Me Away,Fortune Family,"['hip hop', 'country', 'r&b']","[Intro: Annie Little]
Silver moons and paper dreams
Faded maps and shiny things
You're my favorite one man show
A million different ways to go
Will you fly me away?
Take me away with you my

[Chorus: Hop Hobson]
I said I'm comin' back, I'm comin' back around
And you ain't goin' nowhere, so put your jacket down
And they might take me away, but guess who's back in town
Look how I'm feelin', graduated with no cap and gown
I said I'm comin' back, I'm comin' back around
And you ain't goin' nowhere, so put your jacket down
And they might take me away, but guess who's back in town
Look how I'm feelin', graduated with no cap and gown

[Verse 1: Reef of Fortune Family]
So take me away, take me away
I don't wanna grow old, I don't want to go astray
If I could go back, I wouldn't change shit
I would give them the finger, like fuck this
Now I packed up my bags, time to hit the road
I'm down with the Irish, where's the pot of gold?
I guess it's all done, so I throw away the past
For the search of the pastures with the greener grass
Now I'm lookin' at the bottle like I need another glass
Now I'm lookin' at the sky like I need another chance
I'm sprintin' for your love, so it's a mad dash
And our hearts get together like boom, boom, crash
I emerge from the scene, I look back on the rubble
I look back on my life then I take, like, a double
Take me to a place where the sun always shine
I guess Nas was right and the world is mine
[Chorus: Hop Hobson]
I said I'm comin' back, I'm comin' back around
And you ain't goin' nowhere, so put your jacket down

I said I'm comin' back, I'm comin' back around

Look how I'm feelin', graduated with no cap and gown

[Verse 2: Hop Hobson]
I think I'm crazy, I think I'm fuckin losin' it
I think I'm like a tickin' time bomb when the fuse is lit
Bout to blow up, hide your daughter, hold your crucifix
I'm switchin' punch lines that knock you out, it's like a rufilin
I'm twice the man you are, you'd swear to god there's two of him
Swear to god you're seein' double, blame it on the juice and gin
One of a kind, you have never seen a duplicate
Just tell him you can take me away, like you use it
Shit, if I'm a doggy, that makes you a Vick
And you can try to curse me, but to that I'm fuckin' Youkilis
Watch me change sides, that's my elusiveness
The rappin' Kenny Powers, record deals, I am lubin' it
Excuse my gruesomeness, I'm too explicit to submit
Keep my music on the real, now call that shit a tuna fish
In my way, then move it, bitch
My middle name is Ludacris
This evidence, I've proven it
That Hobson isn't new at this
Pardon my foolishness, I'm slick like how I rule this shit
You wanna know the truth of it, I'll try to hang, the noose'll fit

Man I think I heard Wayne say he's a cool cat, livin on his 9th life
Me, I'm more like one of Vick's dogs, living on my 9th fight
The past is easy, man. I'm 20/20 hindsight
It's just the future, I feel like some fucking blind mice
Yeah, and I been down this road before
My foot's full of open sores from bein' jammed in closin' doors
Just to get a little hype man, that's all I'm hopin for
But hype don't promise shit, look at Emeka Okafor
And yep, I'm not Drake, man, I'm not tellin you to thank me
In fact I'd rather you didn't know who I am, and pull a Banksy
Like the anonymous artist, but not the populous target
Look, I'm just givin you somethin new, outside the box and the margins
So wake up dude, you clock is alarmin'
Cause half these bastard rappin' soft, I said they got to be Charmin

I said I'm comin' back, I'm comin' back around
And you ain't goin' nowhere, so put your jacket down

I said I'm comin' back, I'm comin' back around
