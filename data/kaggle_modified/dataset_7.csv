Kimber RIP,Sammy Adams,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Yeah, RIP Kimb

That's alright
That's okay
We take a couple poppers and we get to the gate
We're stuck over heaven every single day
The days we chilled talked shit, got Laid
And hey, ucks when it happens to those who can take it
But your life, Kimb should be celebration
So we gon' embrace it
Till' we see your face kid
Till' then can't wait to see you again
Can't wait to see you again
Can't wait to see you ah

Without love we perish
Like losing another brother we cherish
Not to mention all such parents
Make you wonder what got these fairings hung
We could walk through fairness
Seeing Kimber O.C. marriage
Sipping on some young so careless
Wonder right now what he's wearing
Chillin' up in the stars
Still can't believe he's gone
Kimber you still live on
Through the lyrics of this song
Just know that we love you kid
No, man, no I just stopped the tip
We hating the game up rocket ship
And this is why I spark a bliss
That's alright
That's okay
We take a couple poppers and we get to the gate
We're stuck over heaven every single day
The days we chilled talked shit, got Laid
And hey, ucks when it happens to those who can take it
But your life, Kimb should be celebration
So we gon' embrace it
Till' we see your face kid
Till' then can't wait to see you again
Can't wait to see you again
Can't wait to see you ah
(Instrumental Break)

My Dude, my Bro, my Dog
Never thought I would see you gone
And you know I pray to God you with us when these times are hard
And if I had these calls
Tonight your life be here with ours
But you never had to make a song
Loved your Case, your Dad, your mom
And I look up in the sky
When I get lonely
Or I get high
Put on Kimber
Blast this shit
Till' my fucking tears coincide
And you know I die inside when I hear this shit on rock
Just let it rock, yeah
Just let it rock, yeah
That's alright
That's okay
We take a couple poppers and we get to the gate
We're stuck over heaven every single day
The days we chilled talked shit, got Laid
And hey sucks when it happens to those who can take it
But your life Kimb should be celebration
So we gon embrace it
Till' we see your face kid
Till' then can't wait to see you again
Can't wait to see you again
Can't wait to see you ah"
Shes Leaving Home,Outasight,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Outasight]
Wednesday morning ‘round five o’ clock
The day begins, it never stops
We wake up to a little light peaking on through
Downstairs to the kitchen we go
Eat breakfast, sip a cup of Joe
On the counter there, I left you a rose
Next to a note for the airport
Quickly eat and puff a smoke
The TV blares and the stove is broke
No need to talk or crack a joke
I packed your bags and we hit the road
Start the car and end the day
Knew this was coming ‘round the end of May
But it’s easier said than done
Made our bed and we had our fun but…

[Hook]
She’s leaving-leaving home
Home-home-home-home
She’s leaving-leaving home
Home-home, she’s leaving home
[Verse 2: Outasight]
Paris, France, Spain and Milan
Rides in Venice, staring at the stars
Polaroid flicks and postcards in script
Written to her family that she will dearly miss
And the radio at night would play her favorite song
Can’t hardly wait, Westerberg has his charm
Two weeks alone and one week in Prague
Days turn to month and that’s she want

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Outasight]
They say home is where the heart is
But what happens when you departing?
Excuse me miss but please you’ll have to pardon
My behavior but I’m just getting started
And I can say this with confidence
Or use my common sense to state the obvious
Beyond the compliments, we are the opposites
Attracted to each other, magnets for a mess
Wishing all the best but only getting stressed
Staying for the sex and fighting bout the checks
Issues addressed including your address
You leaving home on a flight direct
That I can’t intersect but if I can interject
It’s not too late and I would just say
That how we came together is a measure of fate
But I guess it can wait as we pull up to the gate
[Hook]"
Losing My Mind,Outasight,"['alternative', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
Breaker-breaker one nine, can you hear me?
Over and out, going clearly
Clearly I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind, losing my mind
Breaker-breaker one nine, can you hear me?
Over and out, going clearly
Clearly I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind, losing my mind

[Verse 1: Outasight]
What up to my audience?
Been holding on line, not folding like accordions
We going back to the future like riding in Deloreans
Not Crown Victorians, life starts and the story ends
Skies gray like Dorian till voices started joining ‘em
Now it ain’t in vain so let the award tour begin
And New York is here since I started going in
Got the juice Tampico, Puerto Rican girls used to go and call me Rico
This music shit to me is like Lou Reed to Nico
I feel like Razor Ramon, what up chico?
Throwing toothpicks at the amateurs, the said characters
Who tried to get the picture but couldn't get the aperture
The shutter speed or the right light, now you in the dark like a night light
Fuck being like Mike, be like Outasight
And grow a set and here come the hook ‘cause this shit ain’t over yet
Here come the hook ’cause this shit ain’t over yet
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Outasight]
Another bar getting thrown out, speaking man to man
I just wanna chill and zone out
If you don't know jack, homie, don’t pull your phone out
And I can drop dimes but I ain’t got much to loan out
Every weekend getting blown out
15 years old with a North Face and a blow out
19 selling 20’s trying to pull the dough out
25 and signed, now the light don't go out, Outasight ain’t out of light
But he's sure out his mind but he ain’t out of time
Grooving, chilling, rooting for the villain, Downtown dwelling
Boy, his ego swelling like he got knocked in his head
Downing Johnny Walker red, every one of our parents said stay in school
Some of us did, some of us didn't, some of us cared
Some of us living, some of us dead, some of us broke, some of us rich
None of us should ever live in the fear of speaking clear
So grow a set and here come the hook ‘cause this shit ain’t over yet
Yo, here come the hook, I ain't kidding man

By Your Side,Jadakiss,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Jadakiss & Barbara Lewis]
I'll be by your side, I'll always find a way
General, we got these niggas
Fucking cockroaches, you wanna go to war? HA-HAAAEEH!
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you

[Verse 1]
(By your side)
It makes me strong
It gives me the strength to bang out and make these songs
If I do it on the spot or if it takes me long
They can't stop me, even if my brakes was on
I'm still (by your side)
I'm always here, nobody’s perfect, life ain't always fair
I used to not give a fuck, I ain't always care
When it’s too hot for the hammer
You know the hawk is right (by your side)
Until you get to the car
And you gotta get through the D before you get to the R
If I don't get you today then I'ma get you tomorrow
As soon as you come out your crib I'ma be right (by your side)
Where I’m supposed to be
Close to you, with the toast close to me
And screw it if it’s the right or the wrong thing
When you in the sight of that long thing
You wish you had a strong team (by your side)
[Refrain: sample]
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you
By your side, by your side
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you

[Verse 2]
As long as you need me
I'm down for whatever homie as long as you feed me
I pull the big joints out as long as the TV
Or I can play my part and just breathe easy, right (by your side)
As soon as something happen to you
Your niggas are bouncin' and you thought they were scrappin' witcha you
Now you cleanin' your cuts with peroxide
And you wake up in the ER with the Doc, right (by your side)
Puttin tubes in you
And you can’t even eat right, they puttin’ food in you
Your body’s getting colder, Devil on your shoulder
And your moms is in the room but you just wanna hold her (by your side)
Nothin but realness
That's why everybody in the world could feel this
I'm on top and y'all under me
So when it's over; if I ain't in the front
At least I'm gonna be (by your side)
[Refrain: sample]
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you
By your side, by your side
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you

[Verse 3]
Until they finish me off
If they don't get us both you'll be sending me off
And please just do me this favor: stick to our little plan
And fuck the money, just keep my little man (by your side)
And show 'em there's hope
And he gon' think he know how it's going
But show him the ropes
And if you bring him to the Gucci store, show him the loafs
Hood niggas I'm just showing you growth
But I'm still right (by your side)
You know Kiss
Don't gotta aim his gun at you to be focused
And if you broke now nigga when you see those chips
Watch how many people come out of nowhere
And try to be (by your side)
The answer's plenty
'Cause when you, handling business you can't be friendly
And if you, tryin to stack something can't be pennies
Most likely Grants and Benjies
And you better keep 'em (by your side)
[Refrain: sample]
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you
By your side, by your side
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you
By your side
By your side
By your side
By your side"
Faded,Red Cafe,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: Red Cafe]

Damn I look good, somebody take a photo
I run my his-house, you can ask Jojo
Yank fitted on, my money on Jeter
My girls all dimes, Louie Vuitton divas
I’m fly like an overnight letter
Shorty, sleep with me
Make your overnights wetter
Better I’m faded (I’m faded)
And tonight I’m gonna get wasted
See to everybody listening, if it’s on I’ma get at ‘em
I can say whatever I’m a tax paying citizen
Middle finger up, I ain't got a conscience
I just go hard like the trio from Yonkers
Head honcho, Kush in the console
Bad boy, now they shook like Cosmo’s
I’m all that, everyday all black
Got Ciroc on deck so I’m faded off that

Two homes on the block, each one a mil'
And this ring on my finger is an E-1 deal
Canary yellow stone, can’t be faded
Fatigue belt, .45 made for the Navy
Young niggas ready to grapple down ya building
I’m living chilling, arms wrapped around a Brazilian
In the presence of a Don, be cautious but calm
Can’t be faded, two pills a charm
She licks on my chest, reading tats on my arm
Hit her form the back, same time my mind blown
Speechless so she scream in silence
A real bad boy and all my speeches violent

I got a feeling
A real good feeling
I’ma be faded
The bar is open

Pour for them white girls, that like girls
We just buy all these bottles cause it excite girls
Yeah shorty go on kill a runway
I knew you would have been a supermodel one day (what else?)
I’m mashing out lighting up on a highway
Shit, I’m supposed to be high, it’s the highway
Anybody wanna eat? Come saddle up
My team getting money, everybody tatted up
Marqee status, flights no baggage
Dope dicks make these hoes Cafe addicts (what else?)
Huh, and I am the most hated
Bottles to the face, shake it up then spray it

Milk the Cow,Cappadonna,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Cappadonna]
Let us milk this cow, the best way we know how
Park Hill projects, chicka-POW
One culture, return of the track slasher
Double doser, Cappadonna broadcaster
Strivin for perfection, the only way I got
My life back was through investin, devotion
Movin my soul toward the skit, vocabulary
Comin out my ass like shit, to feed my babies
I gotta fight y'all MC's, this money
Be gettin me high just like cheese in these tracks
I milk for all my childhood, make me feel good
So I keep on writin meditatin in the ghetto
Makin love waitin for lost minds to settle
Then I speak out, because we all need the guidance
Deep down inside us where you could define science
My mother told me, when I was so stressed out
""All you gotta do is just put your best out""
And I did it, milky
Milk this cow (2X)
Milk this cow, the best way we know how
Park Hill projects, chicka-POW!

Hold your own nigga, Razor Sharp with the art
Don't gettin blown nigga, throwin darts at the charts

You know the stee' potnah, Wu-Tang death before dishonor - what?

[Verse 2: Cappadonna]
Yo, new Cappadonna is about to exhale kid
Hold all the phone calls, stop all the mail
Cappadonna raise hell, speak and I broke the shells
Seen brothers that fell when I slipped
I had my alibi tight that night, up in the Hill chillin
Y'all'll get shot, move away things are too hot
Look at my spot now, friends are exiled from close distance
I flow persistence, every time I step up, I rip reps up
Ku Klux, my words swing around like numchucks
This ain't for big bucks, never can quit this rap shit
It feeds my seeds, I can barely breathe
But y'all cats better believe keep off, the darts are soft
While I throw these missiles, at your skin tissue
You can't escape I absorb, gigantic crowds all aboard
Watch out for shitty fraud, my darts slam like doors
Makin it hard for you to get yours, selfish

But I'm a monster when I hafta smack the shit out of a nonsense actor
Using my 'hands solo' and I don't need Chewy
Over your head like Yarmulkes and Kufis yo
I write screen gems y'all niggas act in B movies
Type of niggas proud to be groupies
Followers in the herd running over the cliff
I'm the ""Buffalo Soldier"", smoke ya like a dreadlock rasta
Blowing the spliff, loading a clip to spit high

How many niggas think that gats make the weaker strong
Can't do for self and wanna snatch the plate you eating on
That don't take heart, slave nigga play ya part
I'd rather jump over board nigga, face the sharks
We stay doing it, later for the conversation
Hammers is cocked and waiting, niggas is not debating
We ain't got the patience. You found popping shit
Come in to town just to run you down like poppa ditch
And dig a proper ditch, you lying like a politician
Your proposition meets opposition like contradictions
Get out my House, you ain't no real Representative
I make it happen, you ain't official, you tentative

You a artist from the street, I'll give you the blood to paint it with
So yeah I'm positive, I'm positive I'm the best
Spit bullets to split ya vest and deposit them in ya chest
Dark is the flesh on my bones, calling Brooklyn home
Hang up on niggas like 'I want you to meet my nigga tone, word
Leave me alone like Michael Jackson

Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
""Will it ever stop?"" Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights, huh, and I'll glow
To the extreme, I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance, rush the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it, you better gangway
You better hit the bullseye, the kid don't play
And if there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it

With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point, no fakin'
Cookin' MCs like a pound of bacon
Burnin' 'em if you're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll, it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0
With the ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby, wavin' just to say hi
“Did you stop?” No, I just drove by
Kept on, pursuin' to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm headin' to the next stop
The block was dead, yo, so I continued to
A1A Beachfront Avenue
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous, 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a 9
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're full of eight ball
Gunshots raged out like a bell
I grabbed my 9, all I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper, the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene, you know what I mean?
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it

Take heed 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step
With this.  Shay plays on the fade
Slice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade
So fast, other DJs say, “Damn!”
If rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it

Jam Master Jay king of the crossfader
He's the better of the best, best believe he's the baddest
Perfect timing when I'm climbing, I'm a rhyming apparatus
Lot of guts, when he cuts, girls move their butts
His name is Jay, hear the play, he must be nuts
And on the mix real quick and I'd like to say
He's not Flash, but he's fast and his name is Jay

It, it goes a one, two, three, and

Everything that he touch turn to gold
He's the greatest of the greater, get it straight, he's great
Playing fame 'cause his name is known in every state
His name is Jay, to see him play, will make you say
""God damn that DJ made my day""
Like the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker
He's a maker, a breaker, and a title taker
Like the little old lady who lived in a shoe
If cuts were kids he would be due
Not lying y'all, he's the best I know
And if I lie my nose will grow
Like a little wooden boy named Pinocchio
And you all know how the story go

Tricks are for kids, he plays much gigs
He's a big bad wolf and you're the three pigs
He's a big bad wolf in your neighborhood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good

There it is
[Verse 4: Run-D.M.C., Run & D.M.C.]
We're Run-D.M.C., got a beef to settle
D's not Hansel, he's not Gretel
Jay's a winner, not a beginner
His pocket gets fat, others get thinner

People chase Jay like dish and spoon

I was plotting on the game
On the Killa shit, illa shit
But I lost my brain - this is pain
On the track. Niggas heavy off the caine
I don't know what time it is
And I did forgot my name, but
A nigga went through things that
Make you go insane. Product of the hood
I was tripping off the chains
Knowing it's the chains
That destroy these nigga's brains
America done lied, they serving false game
You gotta be real to even feel the same
I swear to God I'm so real, nigga
Like David Blaine
This is my Exhibit C
This is God right beside me
Wise man mourn more for the fools
Than the wise man. Pre-conceived notions
Please move beside them
I'm living off instinct
The honor in my conscience
The fire in my soul: I'm not a rap artist
This is spoken word. You niggas have nerve
To have your doubts on what is superb
Don't mistake knowledge for wisdom
The first is a living, the other is a gift, son
Learn off the (shh), and get your distance
Made myself a man: I ain't even need assistance
My heart is wiser than my mindset
Don't let your mind fade
I ain't even drop the dime yet: listen
I ain't even drop the dime yet
Can't sleep at night
The pain got me open
The pain got me angry
The pain got me smoking
Flat on my back it was the courage that was potent
Now I'm giving blessings
I won't take suggestions
Haters try to down me
But this is my progression
Me up in the studio is when you see perfection
Achievement connected with the actions
Last time I failed
Is when I fell in love with distractions
Personal development, springboard excellence
Be anything just not nor the Devil-ish
But let me..dont let the mind slip, nigga
Let the pedal slip. Let the Mack-11 spit
Intensity of purpose: that's how I define a genius
To reach a great spot you gotta dip
Talking about death not deaf
Raising every time we fall
Niggas ask who the best
Whoever that they think
Based over here'll hustle hard
I won't blink. Obstacles are scary
Feeling like you're cursed, do it for the people
Most of it is just work
This Exhibit 6, please drop the 7
I heard some evil numbers, but I won't repeat em
I'm human like you, I want the knowledge like you
But don't trip: I stay on paper like glue
[Outro - Lil B]
This is my Exhibit 6
Shout-outs to BasedWorld for holding me down
And this is the Takeover
Based4Life, BasedLegends, BasedOverlords
Lil B: BasedGod
I want the rap game, and I'm ready to run the rap game
""It's a wrap!"""
Exhibit Based,Lil B,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
It's your boy Lil B
A'yo Just Blaze come holla at me bro
It's your boy Lil B Red Flame Mixtape, this the intro
If you didn't get Blue Flame go get that to understand this
It's done, rap game's done

[Verse 1]
My nigga told me if I ever stop rapping
The game lost Jordan, trade him to the Magic
Exhibit Based not Exhibit C
You niggas couldn't see, let me part the sea
Part a part of me, nothing pardons me
You niggas arguably is worse than me
Meet the whole squad, let me go hearse your team
Pop bullets in his back make him work his knees
This is sick I'm on top now
I remember in the hood I was locked down Oakland, Yosemite
Having YA dreams the pen right ahead of me
Glad I didn't let a few suckas get ahead of me
Now I guarantee that they never be forgetting me
Like a hard drive man it's all about the memory
Strapped with a vest screaming' mutherfuck my enemies
Haters fuck around I start moving like a centipede
I'm the weed-man so you know I got the remedy
Plus I'm a user, dope-fiend music
Plus I'm a robber and I dare you suckas push me
Got the same pistol that they shooting in Blue Streak
Riding Aston Martin new suede with the blue seats
Then I ride Toyota, hit the hood solo
Doing dirt solo I'll tee like Mobo
Got the piece like po-po, spreading peace like grown folks
My mom should be proud of me
I don't know but I'm feeling like she doubting me
Real nigga shit everybody hating on me
[Verse 2]
And you don't know about these handles
Most of my songs now I gotta set examples
Growing up, I was always the one to have trouble with the ones that was never growing up
Now we grown up and they never going up I swear to god that's the type of shit that make me go nuts
Age 16 I was stealing out trucks
Had music in the deck, had zips in the trunk
Right before class popping bottles getting drunk
Never been a driver, never had a license
Walked in my house and it was smelling like incense
Bringing home DVD players and TV's
Give em to my Mom as presents for creating me
And you knowing that I love ya in the hood I'm like Peter Pan passing out hundreds
No hate in my heart, I was passing out money
17 I been fucking stunting
(Yeah, uh)
Before I was a rapper, I was just a trapper
Don't trap the real and I used to have a ski-mask
Never rob the family, never rob the innocent
Never rob a nigga who you cool and who you kicking with
Bringing back the G-code these niggas started breaking it
How you making death threats to niggas who was making it
At your house mad and you really started hating em
Want to be the hero but you never really taking shit
Fuck around with me I leave your ankles split
Desert Eagle grip  with extended clips, wishing death to enemies
You hate on me, you a fake nigga
You a fake nigga like Ricki Lake nigga
Heart and soul of a cold-blooded killer
But my spirit too pure I had to shower in the river
And bless my heart I'm a visionary
Speak in 3rd person, cause it's the only one in the city
I'm the greatest rapper alive, Lil B I'm the rawest rapper
Greatest to ever do it (Based God motherfuckas! )
[Verse 3]
And I don't know how I survived my childhood
A lotta letters and the judge show a lot of love
PO hate still do a lot of drugs
Violate a couple times now I understand
You would act like my friend and send me to the pen
Not the pen juvenile hall like a gym
Start my day man I'm really nice with the pen
Our world ain't the same
I'm thinking hitman out nigga waiting in the trees
If he's relevant, I'mma make him Oddjob
I got the goldeneye, I got the Golden gun
I'm on the jet-skis no I'm not James Bond
Split a nigga wig make him think that he James Bond
If I ain't James Bond, bet I got the same gun
Plus I got money in the bank for the bail-bond
Pay him 80 G's if he thinking he can tell on
No witness make him run like Rev Run
No blood in his jeans (genes) like a stepson
Yeah I got 45's I'm traveling to India
I'm finna have 10 kids it's my millennium
Everything Lil B, everything Based God
Berkley like Gotham City, hitman is the Joker
Best friend Two-Face
Who do I approach when I move at night, like Batman
Show my respect with my right hand
Solid? eye contact, hip-hop notepads I bring it full contact
Really in the hood and I do it no contracts
And I won't eat pussy eating bitches like blunt-wraps
When you see me, it's like you seen a holy ghost
Put the nine in his mouth nigga like french toast
My niggas, we do it real extra-big
Wanna book Lil B that's G's
Start to see life real like my last name
LIL B THAT PRETTY BITCH RUN THE RAP GAME
[Outro]
Hey Just Blaze come holla at me man, come fuck with the greatest bruh
Lil B, rawest rapper alive can't nobody fuck with me
Hey, um, Jay Electronica I'm sorry I had to do that"
All That I Got Is You,Ghostface Killah,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Skit: The Education of Sonny Carson]
'What they gives you, blood?'
Three months, man
Whatchu doin in here anyway? You oughta be home with your momma.  How old are you boy?'
Thirteen
'Thirteen? Damn, the bastards must be runnin' outta niggas to arrest.'

[Intro: Ghostface & Mary J. Blige]
Yeah, ohh yeah, this goes out
To all the families that went through the struggle
(All that I got is you)
Yeah, from the heart
(And I'm so thankful I made it through)
It was all from the heart, everything was real

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, dwellin' in the past, flashbacks when I was young
Whoever thought that I'd have a baby girl and three sons
I'm goin' through this difficult stage I find it hard to believe
Why my Old Earth had so many seeds
But she's her own woman, due to me I respect that
I saw life for what it's really worth and took a step back
Family ain't family no more, we used to play ball
Eggs after school, eat grits cause we was poor
Grab the pliers for the channel, fix the hanger on the TV
Rockin each others pants to school wasn't easy
We survived winters, snotty nosed with no coats
We kept it real, but the older brother still had jokes
Sadly, Daddy left me at the age of six
I didn't know nuttin' but mommy neatly packed his shit
She cried and grandma held the family down
I guess mommy wasn't strong enough, she just went down
Check it, fifteen of us in a three bedroom apartment
Roaches everywhere, cousins and aunts was there
Four in the bed, two at the foot, two at the head
I didn't like to sleep with Jon-Jon he peed the bed
Seven o'clock, pluckin' roaches out the cereal box
Some shared the same spoon, watchin' Saturday cartoons
Sugar water was our thing, every meal was no frill
In the summer, free lunch held us down like steel
And there was days I had to go to Tech's house with a note
Stating, ""Gloria, can I borrow some food I'm dead broke""
So embarrasin' I couldn't stand to knock on they door
My friends might be laughin', I spent stamps in stores
Mommy where's the toilet paper, use the newspaper
Look Ms. Rose gave us a couch, she's the neighbor
Things was deep, my whole youth was sharper than cleats
Two brothers with muscular dystrophy, it killed me
But I remember this, moms would lick her finger tips
To wipe the cold out my eye before school with her spit
Case worker had her runnin' back to face to face
I caught a case, housin' tried to throw us out of our place
Sometimes I look up at the stars and analyze the sky
And ask myself was I meant to be here, why?
Yeah, yo
[Hook: Mary J. Blige & Ghostface Killah]
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you (Word up mommy, I love you)
And I'm so thankful I made it through (Word up)
All that I got is you (It was all you, word)
And I'm so thankful I made it through (You brought me in like this)
Yeah

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
I sit and think about
All the times we did without dad
I always said I wouldn't cry
When I saw tears in your eyes
I understand that daddy's not here now
But some way or somehow, I will always be around, yeah
All the things that I did from this to them
Oh from drugs to being there
Being down and out and I love you always, oh

[Outro: Popa Wu]
Yeah, you say
You see the universe, which consists of the sun moon and star
And them planets, that exist in my space
Like man woman and child
You understand?
We got to keep it real, and what reality
And reality will keep it real with us
I remember them good ol' days
Because see, that's the child I was
What made me the man I am today
See cause if you forget where you come from, heheh
You're never gonna make it where you're goin', aheh
Because you lost the reality of yourself
So take one stroll through your mind
And see what you will find
And you'll see a whole universe all over again
And again and again and again and again"

That's all the fraud/fake shit gots to go

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yo, in the glow of the moon, over the melancholy metro
My poetry is set like a U.F.O
The maestro, the lyricist concerto
My physical play the role of a vessel
The level of my lyrics law manifesto
My thoughts wrestle and attack with the killer instincts
Of a gorilla stronger than Samson
Without Delilah, my soliloquy profess my ability to just
Stimulate you like the best sensimilla
The Halflife of Illadel' LP, no filler, proceed
Hitherin' is my death, I will blow your tower to smithe-
-reens, the fiends catch another rhyme river
Deeper than the meditations of a Hindu worshiper
Unorthodox hip-hop minister
Than a Serengeti cheetah, my thought's swifter
You lose your balance when the sound hits ya
So, check for the Fifth Militia
A poet's under pressure, stressin' that you get the picture (Click!)
Even if it mean you gotta hang over the banister
I pull a microphone on any pistol brandisher
And take advantage of ya crew because you're amateur
Styles gunnin' down your sound-man and manager, what!?
This how we do it in the year of '96
With this deliberate attack on pointless rap shit
Breakin' MC's down to fraction, tell your squadron
It's time to go to war, Respond/React once more

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
The implorer, the universe explorer
Treat MC's like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah
Leavin' these niggas open like the box of Pandora
With styles that's Newer than the World Order
Approximately 3/4 of y'all are water, I straight deport ya
Then orchestrate your torture with roots of culture
The pil-grimage to the line of scrimmage up against your image
Where life is a heist and the strong get a percentage
It's ill as a war and within it, I'm the Lieutenant
That surrounds you like a peninsula to snatch the pennant
You fold like Japan's futons and fans
While I design a plan to make a rapper step like a pedestri-an
I crush a mount-ain into grains of sand
Your pain stains the hand that held the mic inserted to the stand
The Desperado that refuse to follow
The Fifth aficionado break you up into parts like vibrato
I'm deep like the dark of the night
Niggas is sweet and sound silly when they talk on the mic
They use the simple back-and-forth
The same old rhythm that's plain
I'd rather UltraMagnetize your brain
It's the hip-hop purist
That leave you lost like a tourist inside the chorus
Niggas is bringin' nothin' for us
As we're breakin' 'em down to fraction, tell your squadron
It's time to go to war, Respond/React once more

What Im Thinkin Right Now,Drake,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Yes

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'm on that old, switch lanes shit, Jay, Big, Dame's shit
Talking 'bout them niggas that my daddy pitch cane wit
Because I never learned the biz, I learned the language
Well-spoken, man I should've went to Cambridge
And mama would always claim this
I never expected the outcome, but one day I became this
Famous, no longer nameless
More game, but I'm the same, I will remain this
I'm still focused, I stay grounded
You see I ran with a style when they clowned it
So read 48 Laws if you never read it
Because that is one of the main reasons I'm level-headed
Despite the accumulated success
If my attitude ever strayed, I made it regress
I never wanted to win the lottery only because my uncle
Told me ""He who made it by struggling made it the best""
So with that on my chest, I'm down on my last 12 gs
Going through the closet thinking I should prolly sell these
Chanel Cs, and LVs, somebody stop before I really start to rebel please
I spend it all, who needs anymore?
Whose satisfied doin' good deeds anymore?
Who grieves anymore, who believes anymore?
Who graduated school and still reads anymore?
Not me, that should have my whole race shook
Because we don't read novels but we do FaceBook
The new craze is havin' that new age look
If I said I liked it, I'd feel like a two-faced crook
Nah, I tell retro kids tie that bandana just a little bit tighter
'Til it suffocates you, biter
Cause I don't wear no bright colors or rope chains
I'm a G, my daddy was in the dope game"
Love Aint,CunninLynguists,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Tonedeff]
Love ain't for the faint of heart
Start training, this game is hard
And arduous, you're gonna play in the dark, like when it rains in the park
You're hardly conscious of the stains and scars, enabling your partly clouded logic
To pay to impart bliss with arrangements of chocolates
Now, you're working yourself out the same as when you strain' with a nautilus
And you're willing to embrace pain facing sustained negative consequence
If nothing you say when in love is embedded with common sense
Then, do you really regret when you've shredded your promises?
Now, I've tested the waters, kid. Sipped it; rippled the pond a bit
Visits have been abolished, and this shit's killing my confidence
Is this filling your conscience when distance is an accomplishment?
If you miss chicks when they're around, the phrase ""Let's quit"" isn't an option
You best fix whatever's wrong and just move on and get on with it
Cause, You'll catch bigger fish in the sea if you manage not to drown in it
It's sad, but proud or not, most your standards go down a notch
When loneliness drinks at the bar you set too high
Cause, It isn't really my time, is it? Shit, I just found the watch
But hearing the bell toll for me twice a day, has me fearing my grandfather clock
And I can't die without trying, my hands tied in knots
Knowing that I'll never learn to brave the waves if I stand by the docks
Love is hampered by thought, if you can handle the prospect of
Death - it's as massive a shock
And to intellects, it's a fuckin' smack in the crotch
It's a cancer that rots your soul, tosses demons off of the road
Just use caution and know, that, love ain't nothing but a loss of control
Off then, we go
[Hook]
Traces of love, long ago
That didn't work out
Traces of love, long ago
That didn't work out

[Verse 2: Deacon the Villian]
Love'll have you nervous, doing stupid shit on purpose
Brain out of service, words slurred when you blurt shit
Studderin', utterin' non-sensical shit in your verses
Feeling like a shirtless four-breasted woman in a circus
Furthurly trying to gap an unfillable void
Because of parents never transfering that unbillical joy
So girls create a false world of filling on boys
Exploited, guys playing with her heart like her feelings are toys
But when you have it, there's nothing like it, you get excited
Seeking those who provide it, on phones talking to psychics
Some fear it, spend their entire lives trying to fight it
Living in a confusing Hayes, like they're grooving to Isaac
It ain't the end of the rainbow with a treasure chest and a map
It ain't easily learnable with definitions in tact
It can ride your train of thought and demolition your tracks
Hittin' and bullwhippin you, leavin' them slits in your back
But I've been a lucky one, loving parents, loving friends
But I still spend alot of my life loving sin
But I ain't a genius on it, I can only pretend
Cause over all it's an emotion I cannot comprehend
It's love
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kno]
Love ain't the basis for action
In a nation of addicts pacing and waiting for seconds of satisfaction
Where the word itself is only fashioned in fits of passion
Hand in hand with animalistic orgasmic reaction
And the past isn't felt as a match made in hell
But rather its held as a latter day meld
Of common mistakes and nice intentions
But when false love retention is simply vice invention
It's only right to mention the fights you get in
Nightly visions of these Tina and Ike revisions
So what's love really got to do with it?
From prude women to stool pidgeons in soup kitchens
The truth isn't as eloquent so be intelligent
Getting caught out of your element just for the hell of it's irrelevant
And that word'll fit like a glove if you don't get right
Now live your life for the love or stop

Hi, I'm 17, and my name is Bobby James
Every day in school, all my classmates call me names
And so this pusher introduced me to this thing
He said it makes you forget pain, but makes you sing

I got pushed at home, at school, I was a wuss
Now my life's a domino that pushers push
'Cause I tried it once, but I tried it again
Ran away, two weeks later, I seen my friend
And I said

Hey there, mister, give me some cash
I'm high as hell and I'm ready to blast
I'm just one hit away from being passed out

A lesson for you to learn, except you'd learn through me
You know, like in the movies, when it ends with a scream
Well, fuckface, I got news: this is real and I did things
Traveling from Virginia to Cali broke
Hitchhike and rides me in my calico
Shoplift for food when it was desired

I need to know, you down to do whatever?
Down to get it poppin'? Down to get topless? Ohh
I need to know if you about cuttin'
Or you about frontin', baby, I need to know

I spent my last eight checkseses on a neck-e-lace
So I better get some sex for this, shit
She wanna sip up on the Crissy Cris
Like it's Christ-e-mas and I'm St. Nicholas
I got her and her sister in that white Benz, dyke twins
I ain't gon' lie, they only fives but together they ten
And would I do 'em again? Hmmm, hmmm
It's like old folks pissin' 'cause it all depends
And it's no coke sniffin', just juice and gin
Grey Goose to get you loose then hit the nigga producin'
The track that got you movin', this track got you movin'
So crazy you don't know what you doin'
You been telling them jokes, and it's not a rumor
I like a girl with a sense of humor
To give me head 'til it ache and it's not a tumor
So let me know what's goin down 'fore I pay for this room 'cause

I need to know, you down to do whatever?
Down to get it poppin'? Down to get topless? Ohh

Now if you got it, you got it
And if you don't then you probably won't
Sissy nigga call 'em maricon
I never hit a lady but my game might abuse 'em
Buy 'em boots just to tell 'em that I Jimmy Choose 'em
Take 'em back to confuse 'em
So she don't know if she comin' or goin'
'Cause mami, after I'm cummin', I'm goin'
Back to the show, just frontin' and flowin'
Jewelry stuntin' and glowin', this life is somethin', I know it
And I been known to have a ho or two
'Cause my diamonds yellow like a smoker tooth
I tell 'em step into the vocal booth
Roll a joint, smoke a few, after that I'm pokin' you
After that, it's over, boo, baby, grab your coat and voom

I need to know, you down to do whatever?
Down to get it poppin'? Down to get topless? Ohh
I need to know if you about cuttin'

Now there's three different levels to relationships
Pollyin' at the club with 'em, talkin', gettin' affectionate
Leavin' and havin' sex with 'em, kickin' 'em out
Trickin' on models, dimes and rats
Now I don't get into that, I kick that habit
I just keep 'em impressed, let 'em seat in the Lex
Never eat 'em unless that fuckin' cat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin'
I got a nine in my pants and baby, I'm just dyin' for a chance
Who ready to fuck? You ready to fuck off the sizzurp?
Says she ready to cut, then she grabs my scissors
She probably look good, but what's scary to me
Henny make hoes look like Halle Berry to me

[Chorus]
I need to know, you down to do whatever?
Down to get it poppin'? Down to get topless? Ohh
I need to know if you about cuttin'
Or you about frontin', baby, I need to know"
Out of Your Mind,Kanye West,"['hip hop', 'blues', 'jazz', 'r&b', 'pop']","[Chorus: John Legend]
We can't even sit and talk without you arguing
You're the one who started it

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I got a girl at home, but she don't cook
I have my condoms in the stove 'cause she won't look
And she never ever go to the grocery store
So I figure it's safe to pull a grocery ho
She was buyin' Alizé out the liquor aisle
She said, ""I hope it's not too ghetto""
Rocked all gold, force back in style
I kept her number on file for my girl be actin' wild
Like last week, I told her
""Take me to the mall"", but she don't drive
My other girl picked me up at 3:05
She got a brand new car, sixteen
Now the car only one years old, oh
Man, but the body look grown, whoa
Before I catch a case, I better take my ass home
Where the problems is, arguments be daily like Carson is
But the problem is
[Chorus: John Legend]
We can't even sit and talk no more without you arguing
Girl, you must be out of your mind, no, no, no
You're the one who started it
And I'm sick and tired of you lying

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Hold up, wait a second, man
That's that thrift store info, that's all second-hand
Why don't you talk to the mouth of the horses 'bout my Porsches?
Condos in front of the golf courses
Instead you stay up and count every second like a fake Roley
I'm real, so you know I move real slowly
The way the censorship should go off, you know me
I ain't call you, you wanna know why?
I'm in Noha, Honaloha, pushin' jet skis
So I couldn't return the pages on my Motorola
Nextel, my cell, it don't work down there
What happened in Cancun stayed down there
What's happenin' here made me wish I stayed down there
Take a seat, why you always makin' a beef?
You know these walls too thin in this apart-a-ment
Now everybody hearin' our arguments
But the problem is

[Chorus: John Legend]
We can't even sit and talk no more without you arguing
Girl, you must be out of your mind, no, no, no
You're the one who started it
And I'm sick and tired of you lying
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Man, boo, you know what I do
So don't trip when I come home after two
Or three or four, I ain't messin' with them girls no more
It's weak, the Benz coupe is so sweet
When I roll down the street, tears roll down her cheek
She said, ""You must love that car more than me
And nigga, I was with you before the cheese
So you need to work on your pri-or-ities""
If she went with Fabolous, I bet that she would be
A-R-G-U-I-N-G and please
I'm not actin' like this 'cause I'm getting spins on
W-K-R-P in Cincinnati
You think I'd get my voice so deep like
W-K-R-P in Cincinnati
That's how much of a fuck I give
You seen Cribs? That's how the fuck I live
As far as this?

[Chorus: John Legend]
We can't even sit and talk no more without you arguing
Girl, you must be out of your mind, no, no, no
You're the one who started it
And I'm sick and tired of you lying
We can't even sit and talk no more without you arguing
Girl, you must be out of your mind
You're the one who started it"

Yo, this sound like some movie shit, right?
Get your popcorn, get your condiments

If you talking 'bout bricks, I'm the interstate man
And the women say damn, them niggas don't say a damn thing
Boy I bet that shotty make you bounce like a bed spring
Walkin a thin line, gotta defend mine
And wit no pen I'm sorta like a bomb BOOM
Young Tunechi that's what my people call me
Fifty thousand for the cross, trying keep the reaper off me
I drink alotta syrup Bitches say im sleep walkin
Big money for the grill, so I'm never cheap talking, yea
Keep talking and the flame leap off the hip
And keep sparking, pap pap sleep softly
Yea, nap nap, nap sack, three forties

Young New Orleans nigga, nigga just don't be retarded
We done lost everything and you looking like a bargain
Purple weed, purple drink, purple heart sergeant
I'm the best rapper in the game no arguing
And I don't ever write, pause
Un-pause this, so keep ya bitch ass lines inside the margin
Lil Wayne dot com bitch log in
Put a pillow under ya knees
And keep ya jaws in
All in ya girl mouth, use her like a toilet
They usually want a baller and the young nigga balling
Mike Jordan, pardon my swaggy
But my father rich as fuck All my brothers left the family
We said fuck it, Bought 2 houses in miami
I can't wait to do cribs, MTV c'mon get at me
Any rapper wanna get at me
Tell ya label contact me
Hundred for a feature
Wanna battle ill beat cha
I'm a beast, I'm a creature, I'm the son of miss cita
Mom dukes, my jeter, she the reason, she the reason
Everybody woman wanna beat a boy diva, not even
There's a 305 diamond I wanted ever since I seen her
Got a topic of this evening, hotter than a tub steaming
Gotcha girlfriend dreaming of one day being Trina
Nada, Sim seemer, Ten keys in the Beamer
Got a white girl driving, couldn't do it much cleaner
I'm fly in the sky like that muthafuckin ribbon
Bitches got my name on em, and the nigga still living
Spend a condo and a club, one bottle won't do
Two bottles won't do, bottles for the whole crew, thanks
And bring me that Patrone, I don't play
No ice I like my drink straight, not gay
And bitch that bank come everyday, I'm paid
I wish a nigga come invade, get sprayed
I stomp a nigga out like I got ten legs
Then they fish the nigga up out the lake in ten days
Behave, no ho, I'm on that Rage Rov
Cash Money, Young Money, ho that money age old
And can't a cage hold this animal from Hollygrove
Sorry mommy I be stoned, I be, I be, I be blowed
Got me copy rock star, Weezy Baby fuck these hoes
Gotta pay me now for me to even take these hoes
Price sizing for a show and the flow
So either Drama is my nigga, or that boy got doe
Go figure that's my nigga, that's my nigga, my nerve

One Week,Barenaked Ladies,"['rock', 'alternative', 'pop']","[Chorus 1: Steven Page]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Cocked your head to the side and said, ""I'm angry""
Five days since you laughed at me, saying
""Get back together, come back and see me""
Three days since the living room
I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days 'til I say I'm sorry

[Verse 1: Ed Robertson]
Hold it now and watch the hoodwink
As I make you stop, think
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman
I summon fish to the dish, although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan
Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes
Big like LeAnn Rimes, because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits, you try to hold me but I bust through
Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinking aching shake
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavours
Gotta see the show, 'cause then you'll know
The vertigo is gonna grow
'Cause it's so dangerous, you'll have to sign a waiver
[Pre-Chorus: Ed Robertson and Steven Page]
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of taking off my shirt

[Chorus 2: Steven Page]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Threw your arms in the air and said, ""You're crazy""
Five days since you tackled me
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees
It's been three days since the afternoon
You realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
And now I sit back and wait 'til you say you're sorry

[Verse 2: Ed Robertson]
Chickity China, the Chinese chicken
You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'
Watching X-Files with no lights on
We're dans la maison
I hope the Smoking Man's in this one
Like Harrison Ford, I'm getting frantic
Like Sting, I'm tantric
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy
Like Kurosawa, I make mad films, 'kay, I don't make films
But if I did they'd have a Samurai
Gonna get a set of better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon
'Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes
That make me think the wrong thing
[Pre-Chorus: Ed Robertson and Steven Page]
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? You soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of losing my shirt

[Chorus 3: Steven Page and Ed Robertson]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Dropped your arms to the sides and said, ""I'm sorry""
Five days since I laughed at you and said
""You just did just what I thought you were gonna do""
Three days since the living room
We realized we're both to blame but what could we do?
Yesterday, you just smiled at me
'Cause it'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry

[Outro: Steven Page and Ed Robertson]
It'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry
It'll still be two days 'til we say ""Wasabi""

Grew Up A Screw Up,Ludacris,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: Notorious B.I.G. sample]
""I grew up a fucking screw-up
Got introduced to the game, to the game then fucking blew up""

[Intro: Ludacris speaking over B.I.G. sample repeated]
Yeah! Dedicated to all my hustlers that's a product of they environment
Whether getting money legally or ILLEGALLY
We gotta do what we gotta do to survive man!
Yeah! Grew up a screw up baby
Got introduced to the game, I ain't took a breath yet
Let's go!

[Ludacris]
Ever since I was an embryo, waiting to shape up and ship out
Something in my brain said, ""Wake up and kick out!""
Roberta and Wayne stayed up and flipped out
Cause when I came I was draped up and dripped out
Snip the umbilical, spit the government chip out
Peace up, A-Town down and then I dipped out
And oh my gosh, the Osh Kosh was picked out
I slipped in, even my baby stroller was tricked out
Somebody get him, the little nigga's out of control
Put a little bit of rum in my bottle I'll dream about diamonds and gold
Gold gold, to grow from an infant to toddler was effervescent
The essence of adolescence got my body feeling freshen
Freshing freshing, and it was a blessing to rhyme and start rapping
I was the best in my section with flows hard than erections
Still the best but now I'm grown with more range than a Texan
And I'm a heavyweight you niggas is lighter than my complexion

I'mma tell you nigga

That's seventeen and a half, all I need is the word
Say the, ice is cool but them pots is hot
You better cook slow but that money come fast
I got what you need I hope you brought all the cash
You know the kid pimping all over the world
A hundred carats got me all over your girl
YEAH, five bricks and my Gucci duffle bag
A corporate thug, I run with a Playaz Circle
I got a Field Mob that'll Disturb your Peace
Blowing Sean Jay, all we do is smoke
Finish counting my bread and I was getting some head
What's up?

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
I'mma be all the way real with this, look
When I came into the game they ain't do nothing but doubt me
Now the whole game's changed and it ain't nothing without me
Picking up my sloppy seconds as they reach for the crown
Only reason you on that song is cause I turned that down
I went from Hot Wheels to big wheels, Hyundais to Bentleys
And five course meals, no more Popeye's and Blimpie's
From alright to handsome, from one room to mansions
From hanging on the block to throwing parties in the Hamptons
From, broke as a joke to rich as a bitch, I bought a
Plane and a boat and six other whips, no MARTA
From dice on the curb to stacking up chips, but harder
From birds on my nerves to chicks on my DICK! Guard your
Women dawg I went from ashy to classy
Went from a, kiss on the cheek to doing the nasty
Reach your hand up in the air and you can play with the stars
It's not the hand that you're dealt but how you're playing your cards
Boy!

Me me me me me me me me…

[Verse 1]
She say she gotta do her nails and condition her hair
Find a pair of shoes and a fittin’ brasier
Slick shorty describe her description it’s fair
But say no other chick in this world can compare
And no other nigga got permission to stare
I say I never listen
Never mention I care
When they gone I never miss em
Never diss em a tear
Cause other women to fill that position is there
It’s the same game just a different affair
Different dame, different name, different distance from here
She say well things gon change
Now her mission is clear
Let her get off the phone and get off to homes
She knock on the door
It's business from there
Start strippin' her gear and switchin’ her rear
I'm not flinchin'
Cartier on my vision impaired
And enough ice
To condition the air
Now the boy got game and the girl got hurt
The boy got brains and the girl got worth
Cause the boy got fame
Do whatever he say
Now the boy get paged like every other day
[Refrain]
Nobody ever really loved me
It's just the birds and the bees
The her's and the he's
The his the ma’ams
The sirs and the she's
C’mon, c’mon
And u know this man
And if somebody ever loved me

[Verse 2]
She say she gotta get him dressed and hit him with rules
Feed ‘em breakfast and send ‘em to school
She say she need a rest her mind she finna lose
I tell her recline ke’ and just keep cool
She sick to her area her she fixin' to move
In physical fitness her own business
Can I get a witness, this chick is a jewel
And she tired of the things that I’m sendin’ her through
She say when I’m gon see you
And don’t say whenever, you
Know I won't leave you
But won't wait forever and
Got my own paper
And don’t take your cheddar
And no I'm not finished
I won't take the check
And I say chill you my winner from the door so
Step for set and dinner and a show
She say I be wearin' blue in the worst way
Don’t wear your chain, just the watch I bought for your birthday
Boy on the town and older woman down cause
Boy make her laugh when older woman sad
And older woman freak and he hold her ‘til she sleep
And he gotta send her flowers like every other week
[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
She say she get off work at a quarter to nine
So don’t be late stop ignoring the time
Unless you got something more important in mind
Like wildin' wit them whores I’m filin' for divorce
I’ll see yo ass in court just send me child support she
Wanna get married and child wanna carry
My child, her smile, my ears in her belly
She even got Fias-wife typed in her cellie
She been there from the start she there from the heart
From the walk, to the bike, to the bus, to the cars
The flights and the kites the lonely lonely nights
From please leave on the lights when she was scared of the dark
And she got the pin if I ever hit the pen
I gotcha baby say I’ve got her crazy
Ever since that party at the Rex
I locked down her heart in cardiac arrest
Now the boy got a wifey and the wifey wanna ring
Cause she wanna be his wife
But the boy had it right
That you just ain’t ready
It's too early in your life
But whatever the weather that boy will have her ever

She probably don't even know I exist
Can't figure out why I can't take risk
Yeah
At times like this
I'm wishin' I could be a little stronger than this
Too many worries and prerequisites
Just to reach her
Just to read with ya
So far
Still so far apart
All I want
Is just to talk
I swear to God
Yeah
So far
We still so far apart
All I want
Is just to talk (Talk, talk, talk)

Fire,Lupe Fiasco,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
I was about as uncool as a niece's mother's biggest brother
But now it's all butter
Now I'm bout as uncool as some cover to a pool from a puddle
Like a monsoon but subtler
Slowly pull up my pants
A sagger to a flooder
Now you need a submarine the way I'm cuffin' my jeans
Like I'm arrestin' my dress code
The dress clothes and the dress toes
So let's roll
Ghetto Lambda Lambda's how I address those
Niggas might peep and think geek
But you need that when you knee-deep goin' on waist-high
Get up to your neck just like a great tie
I finally got the Windsor
Like on my eighth try
Your shirt's still soakin' wet
Your slacks ain't dry
And I have yet to even fall from the sky
I'm hotter than red with a head full of lye
Better run and get Spike, tell him I'm on fire
[Verse 2]
Hell, I don't wanna see you like a male stripper
As you picture yourself lookin' at pictures of male strippers
That's how that I don't wanna go to hell nigga
Wish you well like a wishin' well wisher wish itself
It fell at first so now I sail with you
If it happen to sink
I pitch in with pails
And pitchers, bucket, and cup it back to the river
Then cover the leak with Garbage Pail Kid stickers
{dynamite} and first aid the way your saviors
Now your flow look like my bedroom door when I was four
No rockin that boat, or you be swimmin', fo sho
Oh, I stay ship-shape all aboard
That's just how I roll
When I try and keep the run afloat
Hating's a disease
And it's deadly if you catch it
Crabs in the bucket
Always tryna pull me backwards
Position rarely change so they don't really matter
If not the same then similar like Asher and Mathers

[Verse 3]
Bully or I bogard
Bodacious so I'm Humphrey
I used to rubber band but now I got a bungee
If you let me expand
That refers to the money
Gucci's all good
Chanel is all chummy
And that ain't even for me
My honey and my mommy
I'd rather be bummy, nappy on top
Cipriani in my tummy
The fade is for the fans
Not even for my fans
It's more for like the brand
Whether you hear the words or just a show of hands
The sign language lady who be translatin' my jams
You really like the beats or you barely understand
Why I throw my set up wherever I am
Man, it's cause I love my town
My mind was a sponge, but now it's Sham-Wow
I never throw in the towel so just wipe me down
But don't you get too close
They might have to put you out"
Happy Valentines Day,OutKast,"['hip hop', 'blues', 'jazz', 'r&b', 'pop']","[Intro: André 3000]
My name is Cupid Valentino, the modern day Cupid
And I just want to say one thing

[Verse 1: André 3000]
Happy Valentine's Day (Every day the 14th)
I don't think y'all heard me
I just wanna say Happy Valentine's Day (Every day the 14th)
Can y'all dig that?
Now when arrows don't penetrate, see (Cupid grabs the pistol)
Uh, yeah, now, now lookie here
He shoots straight for your heart, now, and he won't miss you
But that's alright, y'all won't believe in me anyway, but

[Chorus: Joi and Screechy Peach & André 3000]
Ya won't believe in me
But you would fancy leprechauns or groundhogs
No, thank you, Easter Bunny
There's all this talk about Santa Claus, but see
Love will rule supreme
[Verse 2: André 3000]
Happy Valentine's Day (Every day the 14th)
You got it, when Cupid knocks at your door (You can't ignore me)
There's no need to run
So, Happy Valentine's Day, hey (Every day the 14th)
Now I may have it all wrong, see
If you know what love means, well
Well, somebody tell me
'Cause they just don't believe in me

Ya won't believe in me
But you would fancy leprechauns or groundhogs
No, thank you, Easter Bunny
There's so much fuss about Santa Claus, but see
Cupid will not be defeated

Happy Valentine's Day, every day the 14th
Now, I know your hearts have grown cold
And that bothers me
Now, I understand, 'cause I used to be a bad boy in my day
I know you tryin' to protect your lil' feelings
But you can't run away
Ho-oh

Ya won't believe in me
But you would fancy
Hey, don't you supposed to be
Some kind of player, or something?

Well, keep on running, player
'Cause I got my good shoes on
And I got 'em tied up tight
So you gon' find out tonight

[Verse 4: André 3000]
Got a sweet lil' darlin' back in my corner
Below, I know I love her, but act like I don't want her
Surrounded by the lovely, but yet, feel like a loner
Could be an organ donor the way I give up my heart
But never know because, shit, I never tell her
Ask me how I'm feeling, I'd holla that it's irrele–
I don't get myself caught up in the Jello jella
And pudding pops, that others opt to call falling in love
But for the record, have you ever rode a horse?
Like for you to send me to Pluto, I said, ""Of course!""
But if you ain't a sweety, indeedy, I won't endorse
Han Solo 'til I'm hit by the bullet, so may the force
Be with you and I'll hit you when better time permits
For now, show me samples, examples why you're the shit
But how am I to know with the profession that I'm in?
And if you do not know me then how could you be my friend?

Let the Bass Go,The D.O.C.,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Together we witness one of the most delightful in our times
So um, let the bass go

Nah, it's got to go a little lower than that, Dre, drop it!
Nah, it's gotta go even lower than that, you know why? (Why?)

[Verse 1]
You've been denied, although you've tried
So I've intervened to make you fall like a tide
No disappointment, cause my beat'll soothe like an ointment
Suckers with static approach and get smoked like a joint
Feeling ignites the flame, I mean I burn like a lighter
But with a hip-hop groove cause I'm a writer
The hero or great, take a stand then we'll see
Thee, in chronological order starting with me
A rap introduction, the suckers destruction
Yeah, are all involved when I started conducting
The lyrics are the maximum, I stated for facts in them
Chumps never try to break knowing I'd wax them
Murder in the first degree
Occurs only when dealing with the D-O to the C
I'm like a whirlwind pyramid, and I'm letting you know
I get ill when I hear the bass go
Yeah, that's the sound and you know it's down
But you know why? (Why's that?)

[Verse 2]
Cause I've been around, and you've heard the sound
Of the DOC and the new style that I've found
It's quite unorthodox, but still bass and
Enough to make you dance, so I picked up the pace and
Let it ride like a cyclist
And see it show in the end that I'm the mightiest
And that I'm lyrically inclined to make you want to step to my time
The beat and the cut to this rhyme
Do a show, and I'm good to like a G-O
Never getting skeezed, I mean it's like an N-O
Happiness to me is like a positive cash flow
So I let your ear cold hear when the bass go

(Kick it over here...kick it over here)
(Now I think it's about time) (Feel the beat)
(Drop that) (What?) (bass) (Aight, bet)

[Verse 3]
I don't wanna (stop), cause if I do you might lose it
I made this record for you to jam, so use it
Kill the treble, pump the bass and then
Send the suckers on the block into a tailspin
Roll by, booming like a nuke bomb
I know there's pressure on your ears, but stay calm
After you pass, though, you better turn it down some
Or else you're gonna put a dent into your eardrum
Success relies on the individual
I feel successful when receiving the residual
But as for you, you all should know
When I say ""Let's get hype"" I'm letting the bass go
Now that's the way it should be done
I know that's on the one

[Verse 4]
And that is fun
To see a sucker standing weary
And girlies on the tip standing near me
The bass was the topic so I dropped it
Added some dope lyrics and then I locked it
On track 24 in a machine
To make you move on the hip-hop scene
Cued up Dre, and I knew that he would know
That on the one, I would let the bass go
Because a dope jam is what I gotta make
I make it rattle cause you love it when it vibrates
The D the O and to the C
Must cause pleasure when showing y'all my ability
To inject on the set mass enjoyment
This is to ensure definite employment
When I hit town, yo, you'll know
Crowds will roar, and you'll hear the bass go

Yeah, let the bass go
This is most definitely down with my homeboy DJ Speed
Is that on track?
Word em up, peace"

Pull up clean, then we hop on out
Snatch all the freaks, then walk on out
I'm livin' what they talking 'bout, shinin' if it dark or not
That one hundred E-X-double R
You'll find that in the parkin' lot
You barkin' up the wrong tree, I do this shit for zone three
Four, five and six as well as one, Atlanta I'm forever, son
Still be on whatever coke, ridin' blowin' heavy smoke
Ayy, Em, you better tell them folk, won't hesitate to let 'em go

Got the whole place looking like it's candy painted
Ain't it like we left the kids at home
And just let 'em loose with the crayons?
Fuck, I just hit a jogger, people lookin' like Frogger
They hoppin' out of the way
Whenever they see Marshall's car comin'
The kids painted my windows with black permanent marker
And let the rest of the car carpet color like swirl pops
And I got the bass thumpin'
But I'm bound to bump into somethin'
Kids are flyin' through the air lookin' like they krumpin'
The way they tumblin', I gotta do somethin'
But as soon as I hit the car wash to get the tar off
They just right back at it tomorrow
They're like, ""Dad, this is in, so you're with the trends.""
""This is for the pimps

Then treaten corporate America
That's why they runnin' from me
How could they be so ignorant?
Look what hip-hop done brung us!
It's allowed us to run a business, legitimated our moneys
Got us out of the ghettos and relocated our mommies

But niggas, bitches and hoes do exist, I'm just bein' honest

Ayo...(what's up?)...there's a lotta motherfuckers out here
With a style similar to mine nowadays you know what I mean?
(For reals) Be tryin' to like...they infiltrated the camp
And now they they wanna take the style and claim it for they
Owns ya know? (That's how you feel?) But I'mma blow 'em up
Cause it's just like whatever you know what I'm saying? (Whatever)

[Verse 1: Jeru The Damaja]
It's too strategical and mathematical
I rotate so fast that I appear invisible
I keep it chemical, but never subliminal
The force centrifugal and spiritual
You got static? Get grounded, cause I've mastered electrical
Mostly mental, but don't sleep on the physical
Ignorance got' em chatterin', one even said I was a son to him
Still my LP is fatter than
His or yours, took a two-year pause
Now that I'm back on the set my foes drop like ho's drawers
In a brothel, only dealin' with what's logical
Applied science left MC's penetrable
The leader's stroke is apocalyptic
Hostile like Arabics in Israel with automatics
And if you want it, the Monks can make it hectic
Set it off, fire burn up Jack Frost and Santa Claus
Whatever you want to do, make it clever
Whatever, whatever, whatever

Bound to blow up, but never disintegratin'
The ultimate MC equation
Ferromagnetic, ask my pops, it's genetic
That's why I'm a weedhead and not an alcoholic
Call it whatever you want to call it
Devils just know that it's some form of arithmetic
Hieroglyphic, cause you can picture this shit
The state of hip-hop today is like hookers in politics
Got MCin' locked down like a convict
Blowin' up opposition as I manoeuvre through it
And to make sure it's overstood, I stick around
Popular like crime in ghetto neighbourhoods
Rock my crown like Shaka did, hold it down
Fuck your mind up like Joe Jackson, kids, check it out
So whatever you want to do, make it clever
Whatever, whatever, whatever

Lord Finesse: ""I gotta do my thing...I represent""
Onyx: ""And to all y'all crews, whatever""

[Verse 3: Jeru The Damaja]
Fire, flames, heat up the competition
Spontaneous combustion, like the Pope's religion
Your style of emceein' is Paganism
Your rhymes make no sense, just like a Roman Christian
But your niggas soup you up like Lipton
The Gwan Jang Nim of underground emceein' strikes again
The snake bites again, but I'm immune to the poisonous
Venom, ask the devil, he knows I'm dangerous
Freak on the mic, but not sexual
Call me unalike cause my rhymes are never homo

Fire burn Giuliani, Pataki and Cuomo

Red dots, all of 'em got beams (yeah)
And moms talkin 'bout I need Jesus in my life (what?)
Look he hangin from my neck, I got Jesus in my life nigga"
Sooner Than Later,Drake,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Uh
I forgot to call you on your birthday
You swear you're the last thing on my mind, yeah
There is nothing I can do to fix it
All you ever asked me for was time, whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you'll tell me you're in love with someone else

[Chorus]
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever, and I realize I waited too long
But please don't move on

[Post-Chorus]
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
(You don't need no one, you don't need no one)
You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else

You just changed your hair and it looks perfect
Wish I was the first to let you know
Every chance I get to make it better
I just find a way to let it go, whoa

And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing

You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else
[Verse 3]
The girl or the world? You see, someone gotta lose
I thought that I could have it all, do I really gotta choose?
What good is all the cash if it doesn't buy time?
And what good is being famous if I'm never on your mind?
Night's fallin', lights glowing
And I'm just trying to pay the price owing
And I don't want to feel the comfort from my ice showing
And I ain't tryna be without you at the right moments
Nigga, nice going, is it worth it? That decision
'Cause hearts break and I ain't tryna be in that collision
So I'ma dust my shirt and fix my pants
'Cause I better look good, girl, if this my chance, I swear

[Chorus]
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever and I realize I waited too long
But please don't move on

Many raps they crochetin'
Ay yo Iron, these niggas portrayin'
But haven't been payin'
For real, slide on these niggas like flesh fear
Caesar fade style, usually tough grenade
Throw a blade, fuck gettin' laid
Guzzle this shit like Gatorade
Big-dick Wallies have never half-suede
Connectin' with the hot style is done
Light up a chalis
I run with nuttin' but the wildest, foulest
Come on now, long-dick style
Niggas on the hit out, ay yo Iron bite my shit out
Eventually, bust a rap gun mentally
Been doin' this century kid, just meant to be
Get on your knees and bless me with a gem in the Caribbean
Skiin' off by P.M
Snatch Canadian cream with Scandinavians
Fellatium style, play it like thirty-two Arabians
The greatest lesson is don't owe, you might get stole on
When I go bury me wit Valow on

Get mines, y'all can do what y'all wanna do. Fuck 'em up bad]

Kicked up, mack, max motion
Michael Bolton magazine call, I'm too potent
Louisville mix pain kill rap, Fuck benadryl
The violin in 'Knowledge God' sounded ill
Tremendously obnoxious, no blotches

Dead on the prosecutor, smacked a juror
Me and my girl'll run like Luke and Laura

Deep meditation sound orientated, war the blizzard
Rap para-medical the wizard
Cappadonna, never caterin' to none
My microphone and three verse weigh a ton of slaughter
You oughta five thousand back across the water
My laboratory story keep me flowin' with the glory
Acapella or deep dirty instrumental
I could blow the sky like the stormy wind blew
One gallon of whylin', Park Hill profilin'
I cut your face up rough fifty sure while you're smilin'
For violatin' my position
I leave you smoked like a crackhead on a mission
Two tokes of mic dope, one stroke of elegance
Rated like the movie graphic told intelligence
Person to person, it'd be hard for you to take a trophy
You better off to get somebody out to try to smoke me
Cause I'm P-L-O T-K-O every day
Dancehall General, Party Fanatic Colonel
Cappadonna son'a old school just go infernal
Veteran for rappin' with the new set of rule of hard rappin'
Ninety-six jive, I keep the live crowd clappin'
When I bow, all praises due to Staten Isle
I spark the mic and Shaolin spark the methtical
Every evenin', I have a by myself meetin'
Thinkin' who's gonna be the next to catch a beatin'
From my mental slangin', bitchin' rap twist the point of warfare
I brutalize, all competition catch ill hair
Chance him, that's what they said, threw up a ransom
I jacked it, stripped the beat naked and packed it
Gimme my rewards

All of our fathers is bank robbers holdin' TECs
Eighths of hero'n, shooting in the steps
In the 60's, niggas was poor, check the revelation
Now, we rock 6-50s in the snow
AKs, ARs, wire jaws, say ours
YSL frames in the rain, Marvin Gaye on
Goose bubbles on, stuck in the huddle, tryna transform
Every gram action to a sandstorm
Fly through my block, you live, make a bitch stop
Have your shit cocked yo, niggas might dive on you
All we wear is Filas, Guess, suede fronts, beehives
Bally sneakers, big jewels, Levi's

Yeah, can't sell in here, yup, I said it
Yeah, can't tell in here, they want credit, niggas
Just a lifestyle, the holders with the drugs is dreaded
Just a typical day to get wiped out

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Broad-day jungle, living with the rodents
The goons'll run through, blow a bag and hunt you
Always flaky, calluses, hands
My mans come through the avenue, Swiss cheese patrons
Blood that flood the hall, every head'll drop
Jump in the Maybach, switch the station
These rap niggas is washed, hang 'em on the pole, no head
Pajama top, handcuff with a gosha
We realer than the Spanglers Rep Posse squad; that's dangerous
Take it back to the Lee's and Wranglers
Take what we want, explain this
Famous for my kitchen knives, rings, and the fifths are stainless
Gun down your trooper, grenade your coupe up
Plain and simple niggas is poo-butt
Fuck with my crew, what? Either you shot or you cut
""Real nigga to real nigga, man, you know how we get down, man""

Doom, the warning signal again, somebody approaches!
What manner of creatures are these? There they are again, FIRE!

Dress Rehearsal Rag,Leonard Cohen,"['rock', 'jazz', 'blues']","[Verse 1]
Four o'clock in the afternoon
And I didn't feel like very much
I said to myself, ""Where are you golden boy
Where is your famous golden touch?""
I thought you knew where
All of the elephants lie down
I thought you were the crown prince
Of all the wheels in Ivory Town
Just take a look at your body now
There's nothing much to save
And a bitter voice in the mirror cries
""Hey, Prince, you need a shave.""
Now if you can manage to get
Your trembling fingers to behave
Why don't you try unwrapping
A stainless steel razor blade?

[Hook]
That's right, it's come to this
Yes it's come to this
And wasn't it a long way down
Wasn't it a strange way down?
[Verse 2]
There's no hot water
And the cold is running thin
Well, what do you expect from
The kind of places you've been living in?
Don't drink from that cup
It's all caked and cracked along the rim
That's not the electric light, my friend
That is your vision growing dim
Cover up your face with soap, there
Now you're Santa Claus
And you've got a gift for anyone
Who will give you his applause
I thought you were a racing man
Ah, but you couldn't take the pace
That's a funeral in the mirror
And it's stopping at your face

[Hook]
That's right, it's come to this
Yes it's come to this
And wasn't it a long way down
Wasn't it a strange way down?

[Verse 3]
Once there was a path
And a girl with chestnut hair
And you passed the summers
Picking all of the berries that grew there
There were times she was a woman
Oh, there were times she was just a child
And you held her in the shadows
Where the raspberries grow wild
And you climbed the twilight mountains
And you sang about the view
And everywhere that you wandered
Love seemed to go along with you
That's a hard one to remember
Yes it makes you clench your fist
And then the veins stand out like highways
All along your wrist
[Hook]
That's right, it's come to this
Yes it's come to this
And wasn't it a long way down
Wasn't it a strange way down?

[Verse 4]
You can still find a job
Go out and talk to a friend
On the back of every magazine
There are those coupons you can send
Why don't you join the Rosicrucians
They will give you back your hope
You can find your love with diagrams
On a plain brown envelope
But you've used up all your coupons
Except the one that seems
To be written on your wrist
Along with several thousand dreams
Now Santa Claus comes forward
That's a razor in his mit
And he puts on his dark glasses
And he shows you where to hit
And then the cameras pan
The stand in stunt man
Dress rehearsal rag
It's just the dress rehearsal rag
You know this dress rehearsal rag
It's just a dress rehearsal rag"
The Guidelines,Aceyalone & Mumbles,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Let's begin
Asalaam alaikum, people of good will
I offer you the greeting of thought-manifested skill
To finally reveal the open-end chapter
As real as the flesh that you're embodied in
To the skull cavity your mind is rotting in, I'll be riding in
And there might have been a slight rotation warp to curve the course
Of course I'm cordial when I report, I won't distort
I don't contort, connect, conduct, collect, console, or conceal
In full control of the roll of the wheel
My eyes are my appliance to decipher the science
Omitting defiance with the high-tech mic check
The buttons that flashed I pushed for absolute destruction
Your structure is lifted from the ground
The foundation mound is broke, so you float around
I'm embedded in what is known as beat
Let it be shown, every enzyme is complete
In time, you'll see the pace of the pulse pump rapidly
Heart rate, happily marched
I happen to be the dark man who holds the charts
I arch my horizontal line to make a rainbow
But it ain't the same, though, yo
The tried and true pros are chasing fool's gold
Sliding through holes like small rodents
It's obviously evident my embellishment peaks at 292 IQ
'Cause Big Ace is the spinner in the center, inventor
And I plan to be a winner
Meaning I'll be in the inner-outer ovaries
Overload, overboard, overseas
Hearin' oversees more than the eye can
I stand, limited primitive, sentimentalist, escapist
The way I shape this landscape automatically makes this vivid
I give it a rivet, hold it, stand at the pivot
I love it, learn to live it, then give you my exhibit
Not inhibited, not even a little bit, when I'm inclined
[Hook]
My attempts to redefine your hip-hop guidelines
And you can play the sidelines, write rhymes in your spare time
My attempts to redefine your hip-hop guideline
You can play the sideline, write rhymes in your spare time

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'd rather stimulate your mind than emulate your purpose
And we have only touched on the surface of the serpent
Consider me part of the dust in the dusk
I must collect the samples from the rust
Penetrate the crust then trust no living
Driven by the sonic language passion
Your ashes spark the flashes of the neon from beyond
What kind of planet could I be on?
I don't know, but I'ma be on for eons and eons
While many think that they can never play out
Get trapped in a timeframe and never find a way out
I stay off the dramatization
And I balance, always seeking the challenge
To show the world the incredible talents
I cut the corners, smooth out the surfaces
Worthlessness is just half of the problem
I read the grid, kid, I did every column
I note the animal kingdom, and the phylum, wild style 'em!
Until they get to hit the target, I mark it on the bullseye of flies
And the buffalo wing in the sky
My architech-nique sparks the dark streets of your resting ground
I suggest that you warn your town
I inhabit the oxygen mark off the memory
You will never forget to remember
The lone wolverine marine biologist machine
With the verbal, internal mind fertile
Foot over hurdle, tight like girdle
And my word'll be the last
I incubate every other millennium
I fast and I hibernate, to pass any of 'em
I am potent, untraceable
No color, no odor, no taste, no replaceable parts
No heart, no head, just a carcass
The darkest days come right before the light
I watch my watch and stand right before the mic
By the powers vested in me, I digested MCs' food for thought
Caught on to the end of the rope and swung
Then stood stiff as if I was on a cliff
Not beneath sticks, my feet are made of bricks
When I walk, my footprints indent cement
I am not practical, nor am I unusual
Nor am I oblivious to hideous crimes
Every city is captured and trapped in my mind
Given the spinal tap as the final rap climbs
[Hook]
My attempts to redefine your hip-hop guidelines
You can play the sidelines, write rhymes in your spare time
My attempts to redefine your hip-hop guidelines
You can play the sidelines, write rhymes in your spare time

[Verse 3]
'Cause I have become the night owl on the prowl
Master of the free pen pal style
'Cause I'm omnipotent
I'm some government experiment that is out of control
I'm from some big black hole
I square up, select, and wrecked every tangle
I flare up, and you can try any angle
Even Bermuda, but I bury the barracuda
Then I'm, octa-gone in the wind with the pollen (The pollen)

Counting cash every morning before I leave home (Leave home)
Family I love
Don’t want to leave this world alone
So before I leave home (Leave home) I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know
Before I leave home (Leave home) I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know

[Verse 3: Mack Maine]
Uh, YMCMB baby (Mack Maine!)
Before I leave home, kiss my girl on the cheek and then I say a prayer
If looks was bullets, I woulda been dead from stares
I bypassed the elevator and I took the stairs
Now the hard work got me ridin' in Bentleys and Lears
Homie I'm so prepared, on point like infrareds
I live my life, so to die, I ain’t never scared
And when I drop, I'm not gon' flop, I'm no Andre Ware
I can't see you haters, guess my vision's impaired
My niggas already there, yes we done got that title
You other rappers losing weight, minus the lipo
Breath of fresh air, pump lung money
Cat scan say ""Cash Money"", heart bleed Young Money, one hunny
[Verse 4: Lil' Twist]
Yeah, Twist! Young Money
Before I leave home, well mannered, nice, respectful young man
Momma taught me well but daddy taught me through a jail cell
Raised as a prince and Young Money then took me in
Made it official, YM young'n, CMB, what's happenin'?
Yeah, I gotta do it for my hood
See before I stepped off the block, I told all them niggas I would
Let’s do it for the OC, I put in work out on TV
And step one over a G, now put your hands for lil old me, yeah

[Chorus: Tyga]
Uh, rain, snow, get my hustle on
Counting cash every morning before I leave home (Leave home)
Family I love
Don’t want to leave this world alone
So before I leave home (Leave home) I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know
Before I leave home (Leave home) I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know

[Verse 5: Bow Wow]
Chyeah, stay true to my team (Who that?)
YMCMB a-a.k.a the greatest (Le'go)
Yeah, that’s why they hate us (Hate)
Went from layaway (To what?) to rocking all the latest, fashion
Name a model chick I ain’t smashing (Ha)
New cars for all my homies when I bring that cash in (C'mon)
Never had my father in my life, he was a deadbeat
Moms worked two jobs to keep Jordans on my feet
Now that I’m on, ain't shit to worry 'bout
I bought my momma a mansion and moved the damn south
Now what you talking bout? Got my Bugatti on the way Stunna
Money coming in fast like the Road Runner, Bow!
[Verse 6: Cory Gunz]
Whistle for my family, my label and my set
It's Young Money 'til my day the death, tell the rest take a rest
Thoroughbreded and blessed, my grind stressed
Sometimes yet nevertheless, a young'n shining with the best
Promised my momma one day I’ll be a rhymer, she left
But I love her so much, it’s like she never took a step
Reality showed me them colors that some of us couldn't
Look at you now that we all what you thought, some of us wouldn't
Said he gettin that dough right, ready jetting from police
Petty better than rolled dice, some cold nights, they deadin' us, no light
But I'm here now, and we here like something, nothing compared like
CMB, I’m privileged in this legacy, that’s real life
My brother's keeper, protect me from my friends Lord
My enemies’ll bleed ya, choking off anesthesia
Throw my signs high, I'm recognized worldwide, worldwide
I’m in it to get whatever it cost me, it’s true loyalty

[Chorus: Tyga]
Uh, rain, snow, get my hustle on
Counting cash every morning before I leave home (Leave home)
Family I love
Don’t want to leave this world alone
So before I leave home (Leave home) I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know
Before I leave home (Leave home) I pray to God I won’t
Loyalty is all I know, before I leave home"
Amish Paradise,"""Weird Al"" Yankovic","['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
As I walk through the valley where I harvest my grain
I take a look at my wife and realize she's very plain
But that's just perfect for an Amish like me
You know, I shun fancy things like electricity
At 4:30 in the mornin' I'm milkin' cows
Jebediah feeds the chickens and Jacob plows, fool
And I've been milkin' and plowin' so long that
Even Ezekiel thinks that my mind is gone
I'm a man of the land, I'm into discipline
Got a Bible in my hand and a beard on my chin
But if I finish all of my chores, and you finish thine
Then tonight we're gonna party like it's 1699

[Chorus]
We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish paradise
I've churned butter once or twice
Living in an Amish paradise
It's hard work and sacrifice
Living in an Amish paradise
We sell quilts at discount price
Living in an Amish paradise
[Verse 2]
A local boy kicked me in the butt last week
I just smiled at him and I turned the other cheek
I really don't care, in fact I wish him well
'Cause I'll be laughing my head off when he's burning in Hell
But I ain't never punched a tourist even if he deserved it
An Amish with a 'tude? You know that's unheard of
I never wear buttons but I got a cool hat
And my homies agree, I really look good in black, fool
If you come to visit, you'll be bored to tears
We haven't even paid the phone bill in 300 years
But we ain't really quaint, so please don't point and stare
We're just technologically impaired

[Bridge]
There's no phone, no lights, no motorcar
Not a single luxury
Like Robinson Crusoe
It's as primitive as can be

[Chorus]
We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish paradise
We're just plain and simple guys
Living in an Amish paradise
There's no time for sin and vice
Living in an Amish paradise
We don't fight, we all play nice
Living in an Amish paradise
[Verse 3]
Hitchin' up the buggy, churning lots of butter
Raised a barn on Monday, soon I'll raise another
Think you're really righteous? Think you're pure in heart?
Well, I know I'm a million times as humble as thou art
I'm the pious guy the little Amlettes wanna be like
On my knees day and night scoring points for the afterlife
So don't be vain and don't be whiny
Or else, my brother, I might have to get medieval on your heinie

[Chorus]
We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish paradise
We're all crazy Mennonites
Living in an Amish paradise
There's no cops and traffic lights
Living in an Amish paradise
But you'd probably think it bites
Living in an Amish paradise

Believe,Outasight,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Outasight]
It came as no surprise
Another month gone in the books
I swear without you around, it’s restlessness overdose
My welcome overstayed, maybe I can’t catch a hint
Success, where are you now? Think I need another hit
A lil bit of problems, baby I’m in it
Stopped for a second and then took a minute
The joke’s on me but who we kidding?
Ain’t nothing funny ‘bout no money when you living like me
Waiting in vein, IV
Caught in the web and it ain’t an IP
Address my problems, feeling better
Obstacles but I won’t let up

[Hook: Outasight and Avriel Epps]
And every time I swear I was about to give up on you
And now I believe again
Everyday, somehow, something keeps getting in my way
But that’s ok ‘cause I keep going on and on and on
Everyday, somehow, something keeps getting in my way
But that’s ok ‘cause I keep going on and on and on
[Verse 2: Outasight]
Some try to shoot ya down, their aim off the mark
Scared of being themselves, afraid of what’s in they heart
Been on the scene, played the role, say the lines
Appreciate the honesty, gave my soul, gave my time
For you, I’d do anything, consider it done and end the dream
From the day we met, cold sweat, hot flashes
After attention from the masses

[Hook]

[Hook 2: Outasight and Avriel Epps]

Be Alright,Outasight,"['hip hop', 'alternative', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Outasight]
I wish I could tell you that everything’s okay
When certainly they’re not ‘cause in my mind
The weight of getting older falls right upon my shoulders
The clock never stops, no rewind
To you, it means a change for good
A day you been waiting for
Well I can not abide, no how, no way
To me, it means letting go of being carefree, responsible
Hello is something I’d rather not try today

[Hook]
I’ll be alright, I swear
If it’s fine by you, don’t pay me no mind
I’ll be alright, I swear
It’s my life and it's ending one minute at a time

[Verse 2: Outasight]
And I’m alive and free and young and chilling out
And doing whatever I want
I’m not sure exactly when time slipped through my fingers
But I’m afraid to lose anymore, please excuse the mess
I can’t get over the hill and look back, no, that’s for sure
And days swing by so blissfully, scares the shit out of me
My dear, does getting old mean you’ll be alone?
Afraid of death, afraid of life, knock the door and wasting time
Hello, the thought of being without you is gone
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Outasight]
And I was thinking bout turning up the stereo
And playing something out loud so I couldn’t hear the world
And maybe stop it on its axis for a second
So I can live in the moment for just another minute in it
And I was thinking about closing up the shades
And acting like it never changes time in the day
And I don’t have to see the sun fade away
It’s like it never happened then-then I’d be okay

Look homeboy, I ain't trying to get no names
Must of sniffed cocaine, looking at my Diplo chain
The biscuit turn you to bisquick mixed with shrimp lo mein
Old ladies just stop and say ""it's yo thang""
Can't deny 'em, look down my wrist go bling
Bling bling, listen in, come and get some cash
First kiss my ring, ohh no, well kiss my ass
Back in my zone homes, get ya mind right
The 2-3 or 3-2, nah it's the twilight
It's the highlights of my life
Every gun, car, crib, chicken-head that I like
Ten on the dope, ten that's beside knife
Ten in the hood, ten that's besides night
And they tied tight, my family ties tight
Ten town, 200 bricks, forget 5 mics

Slash the first to ride, you ain't never heard of fly
Call it how you want in nigga my G's is certified

[Hell Rell]
Yo I slow flowes y'all to death
These hustlers acting like they coke hard to stretch
Any broads wanting me to put cash in they purse
Like they wrote half of my verse, nope
I give a few some credit,tell ya dude bring my cash on the first
Plus I hold a welfare card cause that's how I work
I'm bout to buy a Aston Martin, throw you in the trunk
Be at the Funk Flex show, with you in the trunk
If they said I couldn't do it, they put me to the test
But I proved to all them suckers I was worthy of success
Teacher said I was a uhh, was wasting time in her class
It was more like she was wasting mine, I had them dimes on the ave
Mamma said I was a dead shot locked up in a can
Nope, got it popping with Cam, up in a drop like Shabam
But why they knocking that man, cause of the rocks on his hand
Or the Air Forces they'll never see cause they got copped at Japan
Damn, man I know he a gangsta, and he pop his steel
He supposed to be dead or locked up why he got a deal?
He was just shooting a uzi, now he shooting a movie
And all his mans starting to act like groupies
I slow flowed y'all to death
These hustlers acting like my flow hard to catch
Man Diplomats we the strongest force
On or off the court we ball and ball the sport

Dudes try to be like 'em can't you see he getting cloned
All this blue and this yellow can't you see it in the stones
And yeah we brought them hammers Cam we never leave 'em alone
So move back, I'm poppin off the 4
Heaven let me in because I'm knocking on ya door
It's Prada on my whores
And nah I don't really do to many funerals, but I gotta go to yours
I gotta see the face of a coward
Please man let the homie breathe give me a taste of the power

Gas her up then hit the hooker wit them slabs

Like a serial killer was squeezin on my throat box
In the clutches of danger but not a stranger on the block
Is it the cheeferry reefer be blowin my chest up
Be riding from the club trying my best not to mess up
A professor of this lyrical thang, I'll take the purist strain
Of this slang and inject it into your veins
Did your heart stop man? Drop-top fade
Aviator shades with a mirror front face
Movin through the dirty at a slow pimps pace
Kinda like the turtle and the rabbit in the race
To the finish line, I jumped a pair of Reeboks
So bright, so fresh, snow white but no socks
Then I slip on some of that O with the wings
I bust it straight out the pack like a three piece
Prophylactic, before you splack it
You gotta prepare it and mack it, wear your jacket or it's tragic
Not intended for any illegal purposes
It's like anthrax and small pox in surplus to murder us
(Ya gotsta understand Trick love the kids!)
(Trick love the kids!)
[Hook: Cee-Lo]
Drop the top and let the sunshine in
With the woodgrain, let the twinkies spin
Get you a glass, mix the Coke and the Hen'
It's quite alright, with the 'dro in the wind
With the 'dro in the wind"

You do you man cause me I'm 'gon do my thing, you know I do my thing
I'mma get my drink on and party like it's ok

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Trust me man it's ok, bounce with me in slow mo
When they hear the kid in the house they're like, ""Oh no""
50 got 'em locin again, they open again
Got 'em sipping on that juice and gin
You could find me in the background burning that Backwood
Styling and stunting, doing my two step fronting
Now I'mma tell you what Em told me, homey
Just lose the parental discretion's advised, this is grown folk music
Now blend in with me, as I proceed to break it down
It's always off the chain man when I'm around
I play the block bumping, it was all for the dough
I get the club jumping, cause I'm sick with flow
You know it's sold out, like wherever I go
I jam packed the show man that's for sure
I got the info you already know
Man I get it popping in the club, everybody show me love, let's go
[Hook: 50 Cent]
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control

You wanna search me for certain but hurry up cause I'm thirsty
I need that, grind in my system P, on my side twisting
In the club today for the chick to go both
Ways, let me see that ID just for proof
With the drink til the burn is gone
Hit the dancefloor like a scene from soft porn
Before it pop, make em sign a disclaimer
Try to get me on some Pac shit these tricks will frame ya
But, in any event, keep fucking with 50 it makes sense
Cents, into them dollars, the hoes wanna holler
But you lookin at a nigga that done came from the squalor
Now my buddy so gone I can pop your collar
Now If I don’t say nothin, let me see you swallow
In my crib got the co-ed back the new problem
In the club feed them liquor of the wise I'm starving
So much green gettin twisted like Botanical Garden, let's go

You already know how it go, I bang, I shine

I'm ghetto than the motherfucking project steps
I'm cool, I'm calm you looking real stressed
I'm strapped I'm armed kid, hold your head
I'm known for gat popping, when I got problems
I don't run, I just gun you all up
But we ain't come here to start no drama
We just looking for our future baby mamas
With money with face with style and body
I cook I clean I swear that mami
Just as long as you don't go off and tell nobody

Sugar pop get at P
The Doc beat make it easy to get 'em in the bed sheets

Buck buck but now I'm all growed up and blowed up
And believe me, baby paw, I got it all sewed up
And the loot is in big bags and all stored up
And the niggas I used to run with is all locked up
But, I'll keep bubblin', got em on the corners
Like court jesters jugglin', avoid the late night mugging
Because stick up kids be bugging
I paid my dues so I'm on some exotic island
Smilin', sun shinin' all off my diamonds
Sippin' on martinis bad hookers in bikinis
A air plane load of exotic work from Tahiti
Plus a squad of killer bitches that all carry Uzis
I got a lot so if it gets too hot
Jump in the billion dollar jet, or the million dollar yacht
Got the Teflon vest, in case they knock me out the box
Oh no, I think I hear gunshots
*rat-atat-atat-tat*
Huh huh ahh, huh, whew!
Damn, shit was just a dream, whew

An arrogant fuck
Wave hi when they watch me
Can't stop me every time official
Better find my residuals or this nine gonna lift you

Had him on the front page in his graduation pictures

We walk the scorching blocks with the hawk on cock
Even if the old ladies love to call the cops
I got guns

See, I'm dope like Ves Saint Laurent, cause you ain't gotta say why
My home team was hating so my ear is all I play by
Music keeps me down to Earth, but I still hope my fame rise
Cause no one wants to be next to a black man unless you J5
See I'm trying to be Jay tall, you cool being Ye high
I take it to the max like a student that goes to Bayside
Get counterfeit markers, all these niggas giving me fake fives
That want to put a dot on my head, like lower-case i's

To have a nigga looking dumb, promoting like St Ives

And I know success is like a stopwatch, it takes time

And my ex girl texted me saying I saw you
Found out that I got another partner like Saw II
They done seen how I developed from that dark room
And sharks came out that water like you caught 'em with a harpoon
They dropped the ball too, now Vizzy got it
I'm a clock tower, I got my city watching
So little time, so many options
That girl is fine, but I know she plotting
Got bullied by the jocks and now I stop as they broads jocking

Ignite ya mind stay plugged like the socket

Now catch it (catch it)
Peep the lecture of an emperor that has so much influence I could politic with Senators

Still critical, Kill build, eyes red
Digging ritual reels
The blues chill with rhythm moves filling the Bill
When I project the verse I splash a curse;
It's still visual krill's
Oxymoron, living deadhead, forbidden visions said
These are the plagues of the last days
Page getting read
Shot's coming from the place they lead it
Pop for nothing

Jump in ya cipher, just to murder rap idols
Taking their titles and leave 'em for examples
The Almighty herd!!! Come through just to trample
This is a sample of my legend
I spar wit the Pharaohs and arm wrestle Reverends

Standing amongst my people, preaching to keep 'em going
Poison wind's blowing, soldiers from the gloves that's frozen
Sagittarius, half-man, half terrorist
Flaming cross bow, arrows gasoline tips
Trafficking, blast the abdomens that shred your spleen quick
So sick from what you seen, nigga you never dream
Only nightmare on 'Saw IV' scenes, the sewer steam
Almighty force, nigga like liquor we pour stream
Throw a course from a Porsche to the back of a limousine

Rocking pyramid buildings, secrets like Egyptian Kings
Disappearing to the night stream, but can the sun beam?

Break the Stained Glass windows; a thousand year curse
Web of the widow, school you fools, you lay beneath temples
Lay eggs into your open wounds, smoke covers the moon
Sixteen bars that cover the brew; come join the Wu

See I would breathe heavy flame would shoot out of my nose hole
HAAAAAAAA RRRAAHHHHHH!!! Too much shitty diapers
Love to play with matches and drink all the fluid out of lighters
From when I was a child I know that most of y'all was triddash
I dig in my nose and wipe the biggest BOOGER on your bitch asssssss!!!!
Using your head like fuck what the Lord said
Slightly demented with a permanent wrinkle in my forehead
Boar's Head beef bitch if you want it then peep lane
Murder niggas with the fire then bounce to a Heat game
Tie you up like bikes to a rail in with a little cheap chain
And I'll comfortably hang you from the side of the building
So niggas see your bitch ass is LAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMMEEEE!!!!
""Aiyyo what you cut it off for? Don't you see what I'm doin to this?!""
'Posed to know how I'm directing these flicks
The question everywhere is ""you getting on the remix?"" (DAMN RIGHT!!!)
Cause this is something that I fathered and mastered
And plastered 'til they started calling me sick bastard
I'm drastic when it comes to reminding niggas who's responsible for the classics
And I burn a hole in the street like a nigga was acid
Everytime I jump on the beat see the shit will get drastic
While you getting yo' ass kicked
Like a kick and a punch slap and two chops
Kinda like pong ping baduf baf beat him until he diggity 2Pac
Mi broke mi ting leave a few match
Rope him and then drag him a few blocks (HORRIBLE)
Uh! Uh! Uh! The muscle of the street (MOVE BITCH)
Pardon me UH! Shuffling the beat nigga!!!
UH! Take a elbow, I'm scuffling to eat
Like a nigga that was grinding and was hustling for weeks
So I rushed and rushed, then I blacked
Then I came through and I gave the streets crack
Controlling the functions throughout the steer
EVERYBODY PUT YOUR MOTHERFUCKING HANDS IN THE AIR!!! (That's how I do 'em)
I do the type of shit that niggas can't imagine (Uh Huh!)
You know I'm one of the nicest and I ain't bragging (Uh Huh!)
I make 'em all surrender 'til they see white flags
And they recognize I'm the original dungeon dragon (OK!)
RRRRRROAW RRRRRRROAW like a dungeon dragon
Change your shitty drawers cause your pants are sagging
Try to step to this and I'll twist you to a turban
And have you smelling rank like some old stale urine
GONE!!!!

They give it up, how gracious, ass outrageous
Up in the club you could spot her, a Dalmatian
Said she found God, but to me she found Satan
She only getting hotter
What's good with the Ramada Inn?
Got a game tighter than them jeans her ass hiding in
I got that D baby, ain't talking vitamins
She said: ""That's cool nigga
But can you buy the Benz? ""
She playin’ niggas like a violin
I hit that ass just a little more violent
She hitting notes, then I'm ghost like it's Shaolin
I'm on the prowl maybe soon I'll throw the towel in
Until that day's found

But if shit got hard, would you stay down
Would you stand up for me, would lay down
Or would you 'scape town on the first Greyhound

Would you stand up for me, would you lay down
Or would you 'scape town on the first Greyhound

This is a playground, merry-go-round
Like a dream for a nigga
But I swing on a nigga if he push me
I'm makin' moves like the Rutgers
These ain't no monkey bars motherfucker, not a sucker
But these labels throw me deals like the prosecution
Want to underpay me and fuck me like its prostitution
I write that constitution, you know, that classic shit
How you going to own my masters
And you ain't mastered shit?
Give them my ass to kiss, my lawyer laughed at this
Said they was on some bullshit when they drafted this
Like MJ, so I wagged a finger like Dikembe
Until you niggas talking proper paper, no comprende
And now the deals got mills like Wendy's
And got these labels doing bids like inmates
Hoping my pen lays my name down
Until that day's found, this is my playground

Seem like wherever I go the fake taking over like real ain't cool no more
And these days
Don't nobody show love
Instead of lending a helping hand they want to see blood
And these days
I know that god be so mad
Daughters disrespect their mothers like sons do their dads and these days
I just don't know what to do struggling just to make it homie what about you?

Uhh and these days seem like the definition of real done changed
Like today it's cool to drop salt on your partners name
It's cool to shake your homies hand but then go sex his dame
She pregnant and yo homie thinks it's his that's a damn shame
Seem like today it's cool to be gay cause these women be having more women than Joseph McVey
And it seems like none of my partners ain't partners no more they all enemies
Acting like they down with me I know they just pretend to be
Mama get beat by dad and you look just like your father so mama treat you bad
You feel like your something your parents wish they never had
That's the reason you out all night and never at the pad ready to whop somebodies ass
But that ain't the solution then you'll be like me and end up in an institution
No I don't know you I'm just trying to make a contribution
Hoping you don't end up on death row looking at execution, lethal injection, or electrocution
Or even worse somebody you disrespected comes and puts you in the dirt
I know if you can't get rid of tension living hurts
Just try to vent your frustration
Doing something that won't prepare you to ride in a hearse
It's easier said than done
Soon as you solve a problem your facing another one deal with one player hater and here another one come
Deserving the whole cake but end up with nothing but crumbs
I know you feel like your done but the devil is a lie
Trying to make you think he's down with you and god want you to die
Well tell me why he sent his son here to be crucified?
On a cross with a crown of thorns on his head and a spear on his side he hung, bleed and died
But it ain't gone ever change
Those of us that are hard headed gone end up in the flame
Worshiping idol gods like power and money, mayne
I did it myself but realized I had to change knowing my people won't do the same
And these days
Seem like where ever I go the fake taking over like real ain't cool no more
And these days don't nobody show love
Instead of lending a helping hand they want to see blood

All right! Stop whatcha doin', 'cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style that ya used to
I look funny—but yo I'm making money, see
So yo world I hope you're ready for me
Now gather round, I'm the new fool in town
And my sound's laid down by the Underground
I drink up all the Hennessy ya got on ya shelf
So just let me introduce myself
My name is Humpty, pronounced with a ""umpty""
Yo ladies, oh how I like to funk thee
And all the rappers in the top ten--please allow me to bump thee
I'm steppin' tall, y'all, and just like Humpty Dumpty
You're gonna fall when the stereos pump me
I like to rhyme, I like my beats funky
I'm spunky. I like my oatmeal lumpy
I'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack
But sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
Hey yo fat girl, c'mere--are ya ticklish?
Yeah, I called ya fat; look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from getting busy
I'm a freak, I like the girls with the boom
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom

Oh yes, ladies, I'm really being sincere
'Cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear
My nose is big, uh-uh I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still getting paid
I get laid by the ladies, ya know I'm in charge
Both how I'm living and my nose is large
I get stupid, I shoot an arrow like Cupid
I use a word that don't mean nothing, like looptid
I sang on ""Doowutchalike"", and if ya missed it
I'm the one who said, ""Just grab 'im in the biscuits""
Also told ya that I like to bite

First I limp to the side like my leg was broken
Shaking and twitching kinda like I was smoking
Crazy wack funky
People say 'ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty'
That's all right cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
Ya got it down when ya appear to be in pain
Humping, funking, jumping
Jig around, shaking ya rump
And when a doo-doo chump punk points a finger like a stump
Tell him step off, I'm doing the Hump

Close partner keep his chopper in my school locker
Young and naive when I wasn't actin' a fool I was
Playin' with emotions or playin' ball
Used to sell bud at the village
Knew a lotta killers since they was small
East 17th, Virginia St invented me
Constructed the kid into a crook, look up my history
I looked up to the niggas with Lexuses and Infinitis
Corrupted in correctional facilities
Cause me I'm from the
The ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto ghetto
And to make it out where I'm from yes you gotta do something special
Especially when we stressed in these economic conditions
Traditionally causing us to cook a rock in the kitchen
Get it flippin'
Get it jukin' and jumpin' like Earl Manigault
But you die today you put money before your family though
I'm east side GI, like Charlie Caddystone

Before we go off the deep end
Come in your crib and creep in
Help us get home invaded
The hustlas they gon' get raided
Eventually, but for now they stay thuggin' and motivated
Misguided miseducated
We barely be graduated
And our lack of skills lead to some daily infatuations
In the ghetto, the barrio, the hood, the slums
Government funds fill my city up with drugs and guns
And I can't go for being broke so I'mma go on the run
Momma can't stand the way I live but can't give up on her son
Even though I know she hear about my habits through the grape vine
Stealin' the car on Sunday, to hit the state line
Gettin' drunk and twisted off liquor all through the daytime
Handshakes and gang signs, don't play with mine

Granny I really miss you while I'm on the road
Them Sunday dinners was more than just food for the soul
Don't be no fool, cause there's plenty fools walking the globe
Convicted felons equippin' tools, all in my shows
Chose another road they wanna die in these streets
They look at me in disbelief when I rhyme about peace
I had people try to deceive me just to see me deceased
My policy is fuck police till all my niggas released
Speak!
The way I'm feelin' my anthem for ghetto children
Fill my daily appetite for destruction I want rebuildin'
Rest in peace to Lil' Ebony, Richardson lord we livin' crazy
It's hard to cope when these cowards is killin' babies
The ghetto ain't just a place it's a mentality
Most of us carry with us constantly causing casualties
Stealin' and dealin' is how I deal with my reality

If you a thug in your raps, why you pussy in real life?
A pimp on the mic and buy pussy in real life

Lay my mack down, I ain't tripping
I ain't slipping, I rap now I ain't tricking
I don't care if she pretty hoe, and I got Diddy dough
And I done had every bad bitch in the city, yo
And I learnt it from Biggie, yo
And got the chicks, that's why the shit rolled off one video
And I'mma go platinum off number two
And I'm gonna drop another album when the summer due
What you gonna do? I know how I'll humble you
I ain't gonna rumble you, I'll put a gun to you
Look dog, I'm small, kinda slinky
Thats why I always got my paws on the blinky
And I can brawl like Winky
Radiant Rock, you can't see no flaws on my pinky
And I be stunting coz I pump crack
If you cats wore my chain for a month you'd be hunchbacked

Duke I shoot, the pump make you jump back
I'm in the coupe and the roof where the trunk at
See I'm the truth, man I leave dudes nauseous
I had to prove who was the hardest and who's garbage
Imma make moves regardless
Coz I sound better than them veterans and I'm a new artist

Cass the bomb, ask ya mom
Coz all of the pretty women think Cass a dime
And all of your little sisters think Cass is fine
Coz my rhymes acid and your asinine, bastard
Everybody know Cass can rhyme
Thats not a question, I was born with it, got a blessing

I'm the King, everything that I say hot
You shit sad, niggas just mad coz they not
The shit sad niggas just mad coz they flopped
That coz they ain't have no bars when they dropped
I'm on top like 'Fuck you, pay me""
And when I rock my jewels I don't use my A.C
I get it down, get pounds of AZ
And get kilos of the C.O.K.E
No you ain't not me, you an imposter, duke
Getting fucked for your money like a prostitute
I'm the C.A.-crooked letter crooked letter-.I.D.Y
Who you know cook a better pie?
And my birds have em hooked when I let em fly
I get the cheddar rye, I'm a crook I ain't ever lie
And I ain't never shook, niggas look but they never try
Just like in the stores, niggas look but they never buy

I see it, I like it, I get it, it's nothing at all
Coz I be hustling the raw and ducking the law
And I'll be shopping till it's nothing to fuck in the mall
But I ain't flossing or fronting, its nothing to ball
You say you don't love them hoes but cuffing them all
And and they be still fucking me while they fucking with y'all
Yup dog, I'm worth hundreds of thousands
And I'm starving my stomach is growling, I'm home brand

On the strip with the workhorse grinding
Truck, White leather guts, turquoise lining
Watch, White leather band, turquoise diamonds
White T, Evisu's with the turquoise sign in
Nah I can't lie, Hov put me on Evisu
But when I put em on I be looking better than he do
Cats out there who bought a pair like ""Me too!""
Threw blue stones in the chain, the ring see through
Oh you play with them things? I'm like ""Me too!""
I put a hole in a nigga big enough to see through
But we all gotta go when it's time
Im pro niggas know I can rhyme
I be in the booth with the dro in the air and the dough on my mind
I'mma blow, niggas know I'm the bomb

I'm, the best that ever did it, the best that gon' do it
The rest ain't ever live it, the rest ain't gon' through it
I was born to do it, I spit like I'm on fluid
I wish that I'd get dissed just to respond to it
And every chick I hit be going through it
I don't know if my girls going wild or going stupid
My bars better that yours,and I'm gon' prove it
And put pressure on every nigga doing music

Coz I been doing this for way too long
The pay too short, and the days to long
That's why I'm, acting a fool, packing a tool
Back to the dude I was before the black and the Jews
Im, slinging the drugs, slinging the drugs
Hanging with thugs I knew before the fame and the love
I'm one of the first artists, who get love from the younguns
And the ones that was in it when it first started

Coz I do it with skill, I ain't just rapping
It'd really happen I do it for real
I move pills and I sold Caine
Cops know me by my whole name
My weed purple like the Soul Plane
And if you don't know, you know now
Its a showdown, on the the low it's gonna go down
Baby, my 3.80, hold 1 in the dome and some of it chrome

Avoid the beef your you running alone
Should have brought your piece your gun is at home
""Thats where you left your gat""?
You'd be dead, trying to run to crib where you left it at
With your chest and your face numb
I'mma keep taking shells out the case till I catch one
Thats dumb, you should have brought your dunn
If you never had a hammer should have bought you one
You gotta take it when you travel
And make it so hot that you could fry bacon on the barrel, Pussy

[Verse 2: Cassidy, rolling a blunt throughout]
Nigga swell up so big
That if you live you would probably have stretch marks
? hurt it with pistols
Your bodyguards probably broad, but ain't no murders with you
Thats pathetic, I got a fetish for purchasing pistols
I murder every person thats with you
Rounds from the case running down your legs ain't working, you crippled
Im a crook I put in work, I'm official
In '93 I used to grind tree, now I working with nickels
Times change so the grind change I working sniffles
Do my dirt on the grizzle, focused on the flip
Coke potent, it got the fiends open of the sniff
When they cook it and smoke it they get open off the hit

Shit fresh compressed just broker it off the brick
Blaze lavender haze got you coughing off the joint
Chicks getting emotions getting open off the dick
I'm blowing in the whip and like sui stacks on me

Half a brick of crack with like 6 gats on me
About to dropoff nigga
And I'm flipping weight
So I'm strapped just in case it pop off nigga
I came a long way from knocking nickel rocks off niggas
So for the dough I blow your top off, nigga
And they always knew you'd be a bitch coz your pops soft
Nigga, you're frail or be in jail getting knocked off nigga
The bezel and the band rocked off nigga
So my body temperature rise if I take my watch off nigga
I'm the boy you should cop off nigga
You can smell it through the jar, you ain't gotta take the top off nigga
I stack change, the rap game got it locked off nigga
Enough bitches on my dick, you can hop off nigga
You wouldn't believe how many chicks I popped off nigga
My cock been in more buns than a hot dog nigga
I'm not y'all niggas I ain't snitching or bitching up
I'm a straight cannon don't get it twisted or mix it up

Listen up, there ain't no nigga as ill as me
I'm cocky coz I know niggas feeling me
There're niggas doing life with no possibility of parole
Digging my flows coz ain't no nigga real as me
Thats how it feel to be on top of the world
If a nigga don't like, I'm probably popping his girl
My flow hot and I'm thorough I'm one of kind
And nah, I ain't off my job, none of the time
You write some of the time, I keep coming with rhymes
I spit and make you quit with just one of my lines
But I don't even battle no more
If you ain't got a quarter million bucks, the fuck I'mma battle you for?

If you saw some of the broad and thongs that I been in
You would realize why I'm doing songs for the women
All my songs winning, I'm commercial and all that
With no rehearsal I will still murk you, so fall back
Even if y'all strapped, I can bang with the best of you
Coz I stay at the range, my aim is impeccable
And you the target get all this in the clip
The shells in the .9 Taurus got garlic on the tips"
Fried Chicken,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Nas]
Uhh, Lord, Lord, Jah
What I'm gon' do?
Uhh, schhh, Lord, Lord, Jah
Hahaha, shit is all true

[Verse 1: Nas]
Mmm, fried chicken, fly vixen
Give me heart disease but need you in my kitchen
You a bird but you ain't a ki'
Got wings but you can't fly away from me
Driving in your bucket seats, all the way from Kentucky to fuck with me
Look what you done to me, was number one to me
After you shower, you and your gold medal flour
Then you rub your hot oil for about a half an hour
You in your hot tub, I'm looking at you salivating
Dry you off, I got your paper towel waiting
Lay you down 'cause you're red hot
Louisiana style you make my head rot
Then I flock to the bed then plop, when we done, I need rest
Don't know what part of you I love best
Your legs or your breast
Mrs. Fried Chicken, you gon' be a nigga death
Created by southern black women to serve massa' guest
You gon' be a nigga death
Mrs. Fried Chicken, you was my addiction
Dripping with high cholest-
Like Greeks with his falafel, Italian with his tomato pasta
What roti is to a rasta
Trapping me, you and your friend mac' and cheese
Candy yams, collard greens but you knocking me to my knees
It's killing me when I'm inside, nothing I need more than a fish fry
[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Shit, it taste good, I can't lie
It's like you're walking out the tanning salon
When I pull you out the oven from baking, I got you on my mind
Rubbing that sun tan lotion all up over your body
So amazing how you sparkle when I glaze you swine
Hey, my pretty ham hock
It's so feminine the way you submitted and how you gave me power
To massaging me to shower you with lemon water
Marinate you with seasoning and dipping you in chowder
Baby it's like you at the spa the way you gently lay in the pan
While enjoying your butter milk treatment
I sit and watch the grease sizzle bubbling on your skin
Despite the funny fragrance, still I lick my finger frequent
In any event, I'm reflecting on all the signs
That I got saying that I shouldn't fuck with you
But the way you that you would taste made you hard to resist
When I put my mouth on you but that's another issue
Butterflies up in my stomach, when I laid eyes on you
Or was it infection manifesting?
Confused over the feeling, impatiently eating you
Trichina worm chewing on the wall of my intestine
I'm a eat you 'til there's nothing left
Until my very last breath, you gon' be a nigga death
Despite I prepare it the best
And specialize in cooking swine as a chef, you gon' be a nigga death
Who cares if the swine's mixed with rat, cat and dog combined?
Yes, I'ma eat the shit to death
[Outro: Busta Rhymes]
Ain't that some shit?
I'ma eat some shit until what I'm eating kills me
And I choose to do that, why?
'Cause that's just what niggas do, hahahahaha"
In The Red,Reflection Eternal,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Here we go, are you recording?
Aiyyo Tone are you uh uh on?

[Chorus]
Let it bump, they love it in the red
Reflection Eternal, that other shit is dead
Yes, let me know if you alive
Put your hands in the air, let me know if, bring it live
Hey! C'mon, hey! I love music

[Verse]
Music is the river, we floating, we get to live it
Like the souls of those swept away crossing the Mississippi
Honorary spokesman, my focus is so scary
Vocalist for the hopeless, I'm championing my city
Cracks in the levee, we catching the last ferry
Apply this application that's crashing your BlackBerry
""Rock Steady"" like Aretha, it's got heavy
What's that about cat and mouse, Tom and Jerry?
Commissary get commissioned, the prison no sanctuary
For the locked up, every relationship adversary
Ain't no replacement, so make a statement before you buried
We very legendary already, no need to worry
Pay attention to the music, led your hazard to bury
Mixed for transistor radio speakers, Marvin married
His daughter in sort of a quest for a father figure
Adding E to the end of his name, you got the picture yet?
The little Stevie Wonder was killing 'em at the shows
Best songwriter since Smokey and Quincy Jones
Gill Scott and Last Poets turned they poems into song
Everybody know that my favorite Nina Simone
Rest in peace Michael Jackson, I think I need a ""shamon""
Paid attention to his lyrics, he wished we leave him alone
{""Leave me aloooone""} Huh, Leave him alone
Huh, leave him alone
James Brown and Michael Jackson was working until they gone
On tour just so they could make payments on they homes
Everybody cried when Usher sang him a song
Joe Jackson was promoting his label, he know he wrong
Shame how our heroes are broke, we call 'em stars
That's because when they falling to Earth, they falling hard
Everybody balling hard but they sound wack
If you in the resistance then this your soundtrack
[Chorus]
Let it bump, they love it in the red
Reflection Eternal, that other shit is dead
Yes, let me know if you alive
Put your hands in the air, let me know if you alive"
Drive Slow,Kanye West,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Kanye West]
Boom, b-boom, b-boom-boom

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie Mali used to stay at 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me ""K-Rock"" so they'd leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' something, sixteen, he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure! nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back— back then— then, if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had them Lincolns and Au-rurr-ras, we was hurting 'em all
With the girls, a lot of flirting involved, but, dog—
Fuck all that flirting—now, I'm tryna get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes, homie
He told me, ""Don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie""
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Drive slow, homie
(Drive slow)
You never know, homie, about these hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
What it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk waving
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazing
Them elbows poking wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth, relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fours crawling? You see them screens falling?
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hard-hitter, all about the scrilla
Ridin' something candy-coated, crawling like a caterpillar
I'm tipping on them fours, I'm jamming on that Screw
I'm looking for them hoes, baby, what it do? Drive slow, homie

[Chorus: Kanye West & GLC]
Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes
Drive slow, homie
If you're riding around the city with nowhere to go
Drive slow, homie
Live today, 'cause tomorrow, man, you never know
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
[Verse 3: GLC & Kanye West]
My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TVs in here than where I live
And that don't make no sense, but baby, I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's something serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics, baby, this evidence
You see a player flicking, and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, just a lil' bit (Just a lil' bit)
I wear my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleaming through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smoking on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm riding on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tiptoes
I sold O's, and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil' homie, drive slow

[Bridge: Tony Williams]
Oh, oh, hoo, hoo, hoo
Mm, hm
Oh, oh, ooh, hoo, ooh
Mm, hm
Oh, oh, ooh, hoo, ooh

Heaven,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: Jully Black & Saukrates]
If Heaven was a mile away
Would I pack up my bags and leave this world behind?
If Heaven was a mile away
Or save it all for you?
If Heaven was a mile away
Would I fill the tank up, put gas
And be out the front door in a (flash?)
Before reconsidering this hell with you
It ain't you, it's the things you do (do)
It's tearing my heart in two
I would've fell with you, to Hell with you

[Verse 1: Nas]
If Heaven was a mile away, and you could ride by the gates
Would you try to run inside when it opens
Would you try to die today?
Would you pray louder, finally believe in His power?
Even if you couldn't see Him, but you could feel Him
Would you still doubt Him?
How would you start actin'?
Would you try to put the keys down, thinkin' every drug sale that you make in the streets he can see now?
Would a fiend even want to get high? Would he stop smokin'
If he knew on his own two feet he could just stroll in?
To get away and escape from the craziness
And I bet you there's a Heaven for a atheist
It's hard takin' this, racist planet
Where they take a younger brother in a hand-cuff
Even if he innocent, ""Nigga, get on the car!
Put your motherfuckin' hands up!""
Thinkin' I'ma lose it, my mom's in chemo
Three times a week yo, keep tryin', but people, it's hard
And God, your young soldier's not sober but needs you
This world's my home, but world, I will leave you

Nigga, what you think, I'ma stop building?
I'ma stop feelin' like I'm Amistad's great-great-grandchildren?
How I'm not gonna want to make millions
Since the quarter water days, in the hallways
Makin' fake gold caps
With the Reese's Pieces wrapper in my mouth all day
But then my style has quite a while
That same type as Ill and Al Skratch
Game time took 'em cats, never looked back
Cristal, blowin' dub sacks
That's when it all just hit me: you see, the broads and Bentleys
Is nothin' unless my niggas spend it all with me
I'd give it all away quickly
Just to hear them all about some new kicks
Free of any autographs, and not to be recognized, forgive me
It's becomin' unbearable, makin' hits is easy
Put a famous bitch on a hook, there you go with a platinum CD
I know you heard the noise, preachers touchin' on alter boys
Sodomizin', not realizin' God is watchin', before the Lord
How could they do the Devil's work?
A man give another man head in Church
Hell, it hurts just to fathom the thought, wishin' that I fled the Earth

You trapped in your own hell
Every day I wake up I'm blessed
Every day you wake up and breathe another breath, you blessed
To all them niggas runnin' around
Talkin' about, ""I'm fucked up,"" ""I got to get on,"" ""I got to…""
""I'm in the grind,"" ""I'm fucked up""
Yeah, we all in the grind
But look at the beautiful shit around you, it's a beautiful life
All my niggas locked up, keep ya heads up
Heaven's just a mile away
I'm talkin' Heaven on Earth, ain't got nothin' to do with money
Got nothin' to do with nothin' material
I'm talkin' about Heaven in your own heart
In your own world, baby, in your own existence
To my moms, look at me, baby
I love you, girl, your boy's shinin', God's son..."
Life as a Shorty,Fashawn,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'alternative']","[Verse 1-Fashawn]
Remember, livin' in a trailer
Cookin' dinner out a Crockpot or we would microwave it
Basic, television same seven stations
On a twelve-inch, I had to watch cable at the neighbors
Didn't know how broke we was 'til I got older
Never knew I had a father until he showed up
Out the blue, tryin' to get back wit mama
Stepdad walks in, now here comes the drama
Had a couple of em, to be honest
Like William, Scott, they would always take me shoppin'
Ralphie and Mark, they would take me to the doctor
I call em all Daddy even though they didn't have me
Kids used to make fun of my clothes
'til one of em got punched in the nose
Kinda like I was forced to be tough
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough, but hey

[Hook 1-J. Mitchell]
Even though, I'm young and I can't see
The forest from the trees, follow me
And when I'm grown, you know I'm bound to be
The H.N.I.C., follow me
Mama, I'll be alright, just let me do my thing
Following my dreams, this is me
[Verse 2-Fashawn]
First fight, third grade, I was swingin' from the shoulders
With this kid named Dariah, he was three years older
And like two feet taller, I finished it, he started it
All over this chick named Barbara Johnson
""Nonsense"" I thought once the principal came
That fat lip really put a dent in my game
Never in my life have I felt such pain
Got sent home, but I held my own
Slept in every morning, it was like a vacation
How'd I make it to sixth grade graduation?
Cause I was always ditchin', hung around with some misfits
With ADD, and they all smoked weed
Never read a piece of literature, wasn't good listeners
Never paid attention, so they hung 'round me
While my parents was out in the streets
I built my world on a blank sheet, just thinkin' in myself

[Hook 2-J. Mitchell]
Even though, I'm young and I can't see
The forest from the trees, follow me
And when I'm grown, you know I'm bound to be
The H.N.I.C., follow me

[Verse 3-Fashawn]
Check it out, hard to forget all the time I would spend
With my first fuck, even had me dodgin' my friends
Wore my heart on my sleeve at the age of fifteen
She would tell me that she loved me, it was all just pretend
She cheated on me, so it quickly came to an end
She put the blame on him, got played, I'll admit that
Hangin' with my friends, never called her again
Five years later, heard she had a kid, damn
I guess time flies when you're havin' fun
So enjoy life, you only get one
I love my childhood, despite the gunfire
I was quite happy growin' up in the slums
It wasn't too bad, havin' a few dads
The only thing I disliked was not havin' cash
What I'd give for a couple of bucks
Man, life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough, but hey

She stopped screaming long enough to tell you that?
Huh? No no no no, no, the other Debbie
Debbie the teacher
Oh, you mean - Black Debbie!
Whoa whoa whoa whoa, why is she ""Black"" Debbie?
No, not in a bad way
It's just to tell them apart because she's, black!

[Verse: MF DOOM]
True—DOOM rolled on through with a whole crew
That stole owning for holding old brew, who told you?
Even if it's crap, mind your own business
They raps ain't got no gift like a lonely Christmas
Real phony with beats that's hardly fresh
How they manage to deal is anybody's guess
Yours is as good as mine, she's sure fine
From the hood where you squeeze your nine
Off the free cheese line
All you saw was a {ho} do a bee's line
To where she stood and sipped the Nehi Grape, the sweet kind
Circle you, thicker by de-sign
Behind swingin' like bring it back, come rewind
Uhh, excuse me boo
She stuck out her tongue, it was purple number two
FDA approved played it smoother than a durag
What a brother gotta do to get a taste a some of you?
Bagged, and he don't mean coach
Then she saw the mask, acted like she seen a roach
The mirror shine reflect colors like your CD's
Show love to others, we all brothers like the Bee Gees
All except the broads and you
Hold your applause, they break God's laws
And who pays? The taxpayer that's who
Catch a rapper by his toe and smack off his tattoos
That's gonna leave a bruise
Leave 'em grievin' blues like believin' in evenin' news
They must be eatin' glue
Heave it all back and we even Steven Sue
Sprinkle lyrics like seasoning beef stew
And sneezin' all in it after breathin' in the flu
Get a clue, his reasonin' is askew
As to all the feverin' and heavin' up goo
Either that or, dude
Leave your girl around this man whore and she's too screwed
Just in case she's in a ""what you wanna do"" mood
Bring your plate to the Metal Face and get your food chewed
Tastes like chicken
He wastes no time like the bassline kickin' in
Or like a lace eye with you through thick and thin
Raw humor, face pie to a frickin' chin
New York'n, a hell of a finer town
Choose your words wisely from the Boogie Down to Chinatown
Or be found with a hole in your designer gown
In the role of public opinion, it earned a minor frown
If you think you're slick, you might can whisper, uh
As a few good men set sights to link with your chick
You have to find a new hen fight to drink your liq'
Ten years later, see how Enzyte'll shrink your- wallet
As you wallow in a sorrow pit
Cheers, is that your beer kid? Then swallow it
Or get chased by the Sandman, on some Apollo-
Flow so weird, his own peers couldn't follow it
On the phone, he sounded like a real paid (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Then we met in person, he was three shades blacker
That's why he say money over ball and chain dames
We all the same, no callin' names
[Outro: Stormy & Quinn]
I'm as smart as him!
What? I got Ph.D's in four scientific disciplines
Really? (Why do you think they call me Dr. Quinn?)
Um, I just thought that was a nickname
You know like, Dr. Dre, Eastside!"

Boom, guess who stepped in the room?
Draped in black diamonds like a fucking Monsoon
Back from the dead but they never found my killer
So I jumped up out the grave like Michael Jackson in Thriller
Iller than most MCs 'cause I be killin' 'em
Most emcees turn into ghost emcees
Yeah, give a drummer some
If 32 Seville when that all black Hummer run
Face/Off, Nicolas Cage with a gauge
I'm famous for killing rappers, my style - grenade
Cook shit like Rae, the chef Raekwon
The beats are filet mignon without the A1
Who bark like a Pitbull, you? Bitch please
I ate your favorite rapper’s heart out with a 16
Didn't hit the switch on something with big fiends
Make money with Ruff Ryders, homie, that's Swiss cheese
[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Can a drummer get some?

Bang, guess who checked in the game
Smoke in the air like LeBron James
Running this shit like he Ron Dayne
Pull out my dick and just pee on flames
She on Wayne, but she ain't what I be on
I'm beyond, I pee on you peons for eons
I'm in my prime like Deion, I'ma shine like neon
I'm a Lion like Leon
But I'm 'bout to go off, 'cause that is all I know of
I don't have to show y'all, I'd rather show off
Yeah, Travis on the drums, Travis on the beat
Wayne got the smoke and Game got the heat
Weezy F, I'm a F'ing star, haha
Get it? F and star
And it's the rock you bastards
If I'm the rock star we'll rock you bastards
[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Can a drummer get some?

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
2Pac in Juice, Radames on the loose
10 chains 'round my neck, haters wish it was a noose
Long Maybach and I wish it was a coupe
Kush out the jar, car smellin' like Joop
Quarter milli on the seat, yeah I know I’m a goof
Designer underwear she knows I’m the Gucc'
Got the wide body, I'm a fat mother fucker
In Swahili I'm screaming ""stack motherfucker""
Ya homie won't stop until I decide to
Until then I'm making rollies for the homies to ride to
Smokes on the folds, folks wanna know
Bitch I'm a boss, best foot's on the blow
Keep the hat pulled over, Big P on the front
Travis on the drums, big weed on the blunt
Being Savage where I'm from, girls menage from the jump
Don't trap me like a punk, Travis handing me the pumps, so
[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Can a drummer get some?

[Verse 1]
Put one up for Shackle Me Not, clean logic procreation
I did not invent the wheel, I was the crooked spoke adjacent
While the triple sixers' lassos keep angels roped in the basement
I walk the block with a halo on a stick, poking your patience
Y'all catch a thirty-second flash visual
Dirty cooperative med platoon
Bloom, head-trip split ridiculous
Fathom the splicing of first-generation fuck-up
With trickle-down anti-hero smack (Kraken!)
I pace my game for zero hour completion cretin, splash
Duke of early retirement picket dream
American Nightmare hogging the screen
I'll hold the door open so you can stumble in
If you'd stop following me around the jungle gym
Now it's honor, and I spell it with the 'H' I stole from heritage
Merit crutched on the wretched refuse of my teeming resonance
I promise, tempest-tossed breed with a bleeding conscience
See, the creed accents responsive but my sports divorced the wattage
And I'm sleeping now — wow! —yeah, the settlers laugh
You won't be laughing when your covered wagons crash
You won't be laughing when the buzzards drag your brother's flags to rags
You won't be laughing when your front lawn is spangled with epitaphs (You won't be laughing!)
Then I'll hang my boots to rest when I'm impressed
So I triple knot 'em and forgot 'em
His origami dream is beautiful
But man, those wings will never leave the ground
Without a feather and a lottery ticket, now settle down

All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day

[Verse 2]
Slacker-bound intimate tabloid headline with a pulse
Shimmy cross the centerfold, enter dead time engulfed
Divvy crumbs for the better souls
With seven deadly stains, adhere the blame to crystal conscience
The result's a lowlife countin' on one hand what he's accomplished
Okay, link me to activism chain activate street sweep
Plug deteriorating cenobite pendragon
I hock spores coursed by the morbid
Spreading of mad men, Alley gospel
Sinking your Lincoln-Log cabin and Charlie Chaplin waddle
I could zig-zag and zig 'em again
For the badge dreams sparkle in my brick wall windows
Another thick installment of one night in Gotham
Without the wretched; Houston, we have a problem
Attached to the festive batch of city goblins
Who split holiday freaks on a box cut cinema high road bellow
Head gripped, watch red bricks turn yellow
Sort of similar to most backbones at camp Icarus
Where all fiddler crabs congregate and get pampered for bickering
Life's not a bitch, life is a beautiful woman
You only call her a bitch 'cause she won't let you get that pussy
Maybe she didn't feel y'all shared any similar interests
Or maybe you're just an asshole who couldn't sweet talk the princess
Kiss the speaker wire Peter/pacifism pegging threshold
Stomach full of halo kibbles
Wings span cast black upon vigils
Here to Duck Hunt ticker tape vision and pick apart the pixels
I got a friend of polar nature, and it's all peace
You and I seek similar stars but can't sit at the same feast
Metal Captain, this cat is askin' if I've seen his bit of lost passion
I told him: ""Yeah,"" but only when I pedaled past him
[Chorus]
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way

I slow Dance with the Devil, snow setting in the bezzle
Mo' sipping, phantom, bumping Aaron Neville
Polo black scented, eyes squinted
Air Force One's, with my own pattern in it
Fresher than a star, glowing up in the galaxy
Pagan holidays are way far from my reality
Fart through Evisu jeans, lethal green
Oliver peoples shades when I creep through Queens
With no AKs, I'm the ambassador
Robin Hood in the Aston Mart
Lot of blood gon' splash in war
Task force homicide, federalies gon' harass
But y'all ain't never seen nothing, not a word not a hint
On the kid from the Project Bench, that went
Sony-BMG, to that new conglomerate
Island Def Jam, guess how many dollars was spent
To get the best man, y'all niggas ain't silencing shit
Ya bitch been wanna polish the dick, the big Benz
I'ma model ya chick with Zac Posen, cash froze her
Cats stroke her, once I smash it's over
Cold like ice, more chains than slaves

Roll the dice, I bring change when I gamble

Any club with ladies or dimes, I'm a regular
Give it up smooth, I ain't begging ya
Intelligent brainiac, brains maniac
Back of the Maybach, taste that, don't waste that
Eat with my elbows top of the table
Street etiquette with speech impediments
And still see presidents, no matter who paid
'Cause you ain't take the last dollar made
Long as they keep printing it, there's chances of getting it
Money's my bitch, and we stay intimate
Ask about Nashwan, could ask about Jung'
Ask about Bravehearts and ask where I'm from

Don't ask no more questions, y'all know what it is

Whether chrome sparking or loan sharking
Busting rachets or numbers rackets or drug traffic
My funds are wrapped up, no concerns who has what
Financier, skull do-ragged up
Mob life, prizefights, plasma TVs or first roll
Diversified dough in my circle
Amid the most sickest groom the proof swiftness
Numero uno, annuit coeptis
That's the language of our Latin ancestors
On the back of a dollar, the plan and the message
In a Rolls Royce like the King of Nigeria
My criteria, smoke cigars
Change rap like Jimi Hendrix changed Rock 'n' Roll
With a broke guitar, diamonds flashing
Almost put a million cash in my mommy casket
Seen more green than St. Patrick, trick

Eye for a Eye Your Beef Is Mines,Mobb Deep,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Havoc]

As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together, son, your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together, son, your beef is mines
As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together, son, your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together, son, your beef is mines

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Let me start from the beginnin', at the top of the list
Know wha'mean, Hav? Situation like this
Another war story from a thirsty young hustler
Won't trust ya, I'd rather bust ya
And leave your corpse for the cops to discover
While I be pimpin' in the Range Rover, all jewelled like Liberace
You watch me while Jakes tryin' to knock me and lock me
But I be on the low sippin' Asti Spumante
Niggas tried to creep on the side of my Jeep
Stuck the heat through the window, rocked they ass to sleep
Over a 3-pack, it was a small thing really, yeah
But keep lettin' them small things slide and be a failure
If I'm outta town, one of my crew'll take care of ya
The world is ours, and your team's inferior
You wanna bust caps, I get all up in your area
Kidnap your children, make the situation scarier
Life is a gamble, we scramble for money
I might crack a smile, but ain't a damn thing funny
I'm caught up in the dirt where your hands get muddy
Plus, the outcome turns out to be lovely
Got cheese in my pocket, hit off my main squeeze
Push back the sunroof, let the cold air breeze
Through the butter-soft leather upholstery
But mostly, keep the gat closely 'cause niggas wanna toast me
[Verse 2: Havoc]
A-yo, I gotta get mines, no matter what the consequences
Count all my blessings, add up my weapons
Cock back the gat and let my nine serve purpose
Sling, do my thing, organize fiend servants
Tryin' to make a mill is stress, you know the deal
So we sling krills, get your cap peeled, 'cause everythin' is real
Cuz, I wanna chill, laid up in a Jacuzzi
Sippin' bubbly with my fingers on the Uzi
Try to infiltrate my fort, get caught, dead up in New York
My brain is packed with criminal thoughts
Get your life lost, never found again, my friend
Mission completed, watch you drop in less than ten
On my road to the riches, hittin' snitches off with mad stitches
Your last restin' place'll be a ditch, kid
No one can stop me; try, your style's sloppy
You wanna be me, you're just an imitation copy
My theme is all about makin' the green
Livin' up in luxury, pushin' phat whips and livin' comfortably

Stash C.R.E.A.M., keys on a triple beam
500 SL green, '95 nickle gleam
Condominium, thug dressed like a gentleman
Tailor-made ostrich, Chanel for my woman friend
Murderin', numbers on your head while I'm burglarin'
Shank is servin' 'em
What's up to all my niggas swervin' in New York metropolis
The 'Bridge brings apocalypse
Shoot at the clouds, feels like the Holy Beast is watchin' us
Mad man, my sanity is goin' like a hourglass
Gun inside my bad hand I sliced tryna bag grams
I got hoes that used to milk you
Niggas who coulda killed you is down with my ill crew of psychos
Nas Escobar movin' on your weak production
Pumpin' corruption in the third world, we just bustin'

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Hold up, and analyze the wildcats slang cracks
They swing in Ac's, the new routines be my eyes
Blacks playin' corners, glancin' all up in your cornea
Corner ya, seen cats snatch monies up on ya
But late night, candlelight fiend with a crack pipe
It's only right, feelin' higher than an airplane, right
Word, yo, I wanna get this money then blow
Take my time, blast a nine, if you front, you go
Sip beers — the German ones, hand my guns to sons
Shaolin and Queensbridge, we robbin' niggas for fun
But still, write my will out to my seeds then build
Mahalia sing a tale, but the real, we still kill
WHAT!

Hundred thousand dollars worth of champagne
Now you and your girl screaming Taylor Gang
Diamonds in the man swinging from my chain
Leave straight from the club, put you on a plane
Fly you different places, faces in my bankroll
Giant paper, so we drinking by the caseload
I think I'm Mr. T rocking all this gold
Or Eazy E, fucking all these hoes
And my outfit is Louis-that, Louis-this
Stay losing bottle, count these lames out here losing chicks
My weed disturb the peace, that's word to Ludacris
Get in Hollywood, now I need a clueless bitch
One who got a couple dollars, rock the newest shit

Get you back to my crib, lil mama, then it's

Love vs. Hate,Brand Nubian,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Grand Puba]
Uhh

[Chorus: Grand Puba]
Now it's love, vs. hate
Time for my people to eliminate
That hate, let's love
Because it's our people that we're thinking of

[Verse 1: Grand Puba]
Now they say we playa' hatin' cause we hate the black on black
And the fact we can't stand when we act like that
Self-hate killin' us more than the po-po or crack
I tell my peoples with the gats it ain't about all that
We arrived on slave ships, tortured chained and whipped
Four hundred years of bein' slaves in the land of the brave
Have we forgotten? Our ancestors forced to pick cotton
Women raped and tortured, murdered if they caught ya
Niggas swung from trees like a breeze do summer leaves
Swayin' back and forth, failed attempts to make it North
Millions of people died just so that we can survive
So this knowledge I provide cause these facts can't be denied
Nowadays it's new ways, sixties it was the smack
Eighties it was the crack, nineties it be the gat
Time to recognize how uncivilized we got
Get wise and unify and not fall victim to the plot
[Chorus: Grand Puba]
Cause it's love, vs. hate
Time for my people to eliminate
That hate, let's love

[Verse 2: Lord Jamar]
Uh, when will we make our Exodus? When will the guns
Bust the other way instead of at the brother next to us?
That's all that they expect from us, police stand by
Don't believe the lie that they're the ones protectin' us
Projects, to see how poverty's affectin' us
Robberies, we lust objects of high quality
Or so we think we slowly sink into the quicksand
With no support, like a bike that doesn't have a kickstand
We stay in court, smoke Newport's, and fail to support
Our seeds, with no thoughts for they needs
We fought for the cheese and all it got us was a grave
Or a bid as a slave, we live in the land of the brave
Where the home isn't free, grown niggas be
In a zone, tryin' to act out the TV
We cracked out and greedy with a lack of respect
It's time to come correct, it's time to come correct
[Chorus: Grand Puba]
Cause it's love, vs. hate
Time for my people to eliminate
That hate, let's love
Because it's our people that we're thinking of
It's love, vs. hate
It's time for my people to eliminate
That hate, let's love
Because it's our people that we thinking of

[Verse 3: Sadat X]
Sally, been gettin' beat for years
Husband come home high off of weed and beers
He frustrated cause his job is low rate
Low money, plus his wife brother act kinda funny
My nosey neighbor always makin' it her labor
To cause controversy, I seen them out in Jersey
The teacher say my son show aggression
I tell her it's in our lesson, for him to know himself
To me the greatest wealth is the best of health
When the music stops, I'll play the role like my pops
And his pops and so on I got a legacy to go on
I'll watch out for my babies and I'll kill for 'em
And if they wanna receive the knowledge
Then I'll build for 'em
Now if it's love vs. hate, then what's your fate?
What we showin' with the money we blown?
Shit is still chaos, ain't a damn thing sewn

Cause it's love, vs. hate

It's love, vs. hate

We're smoking that Danger Girl
We're smoking that Gen 13
Bong's called Yoda, man
And Yoda can't stand a bag filled with stems and seeds
Yo, I can't stand no ecstacy
Cocaine made a mess of me
Beer and booze are now things that I use to do
Don't misconstrue, I'm still abusing' weed
Some kids like to get fucked up
Acting black by rolling them blunts
I got a one hitter called Margot Kidder
And I only need to hit that shit once
Cause I ain't made of nickels and dimes
Fat kind make me tickled inside
Say no to cutting up lines
That's one-point-twenty-one jiggawatt jive
And I ain't no Nancy Reagan
Just saying kinda take it slow
Say yeah to the jazz cigarette
Say nil to the thrills of pills and blow
Teen years about getting beat down
And your twenties 'bout smoking them pounds
Stick around for the sticky amounts
Flick a Bic 'til your stuck to the couch
I'm the sativa cyborg
I smell that shit like a wine cork
I hope they never legalize
Then High Times won't have anything to fight for
I used to smoke with kids at shows
But I stopped cause they all had colds
But I got Emergen-C and a bag of Coldeeze
And mad trees so let's all get stoned!

After a show, you're a friend of mind
Handshake with a prize inside
These are Batman Begins hallucinagens
These whammies are weaponized
LSD and shrooms, I tried them
Was a time when I wouldn't deny them
All you need is one trip where you lose your shit
Kiss goodbye to the sky with diamonds;
But I keep coming back like it's Atkins fat
Cause the weed's like crack cocaine
But the risk you take is just getting baked
You're surely gonna see the next day
They say we fund Al Qaeda
Sounds like the government's jealous
Let's get the enemy stoned
Bring our ninjas home - to hell with Christian zealots
Cause all we need is some weed and a laid back beat
Black lights if you stereotype
Couple bean bag chairs and a lack of airs
A marathon of price is right
What's the 4-1-1 for realzies?
I freeze my Reese's Pieces
It's like everytime I pack a pipe
My appetite suddenly increases
You know what a cracka mean
Green leaves my tractorbeam
Addicted like it's gasoline, just pass the trees
While I live that cracker dream
But I might have to cease my deeds
I might have to take control
Cause I ain't down with little mc
Growing up in a cloud of my second-hand smoke
Weed is by my side, it's always been there
Always been there, always been there
Weed is by my side, it's always been there
Always been there, always been there
Weed is by my side, it's always been there
Always been there, always been there

The One I Gave My Heart To,Aaliyah,['r&b'],"[Intro]
Hey, oh
Yeah

[Chorus]
How could the one I gave my heart to
Break my heart so bad?
How could the one who made me happy
Make me feel so sad?
Won't somebody tell me, so I can understand
If you love me, how could you hurt me like that?
How could the one I gave my world to
Throw my world away?
How could the one who said, ""I love you""
Say the things you say?
How could the one I was so true to just tell me lies?
How could the one I gave my heart to
Break this heart of mine, tell me

[Verse]
How could you be so cold to me?
When I gave you everything
All my love, all I had inside
How could you just walk out the door?
How could you not love me anymore?
I thought we had forever, I can't understand
How could the one I shared my dreams with
Take my dreams from me?
How could the love that brought such pleasure
Bring such misery?
Won't somebody tell me, somebody tell me please?
If you love me, how could you do that to me, tell me
Whoa, hey
[Bridge]
Yeah, how could you just walk out the door?
How could you not love me anymore?
I thought we had forever
Can't understand
No I can't understand

[Chorus]
How could the one I gave my heart to (Oh)
Break my heart so bad? (Break my heart)
How could the one who made me happy (You made me so happy)
Make me feel so sad? (Oh, yeah)
Won't somebody tell me? (Won't they tell me?)
So I can understand (So I can understand)
If you love me, how could you hurt me like that? (How could you hurt me?)
How could the one I gave my world to
Throw my world away? (Throw my world away)
How could the one who said, ""I love you"" (You said you love me)
Say the things you say? (But you didn't love me, oh)
How could the one I was so true to (Yeah, you did)
Just tell me lies? (You told me lies, oh yeah)

[Outro]
How could the one I gave my heart to (Ooh)
Make me feel so sad? (Hey)
How could the one I gave my heart to
Break my heart so bad?
Tell me (tell me, tell me)
Ooh, tell me"
Boss Up,Esham,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Esham - BOSS UP lyrics

Hook:
Boss up
Don't get me crossed up
We like to drink the sauce up
Toss money at the bar and floss up
Boss up
Y'all know who's the nicest
I'm from Detroit, player
I don't care what the price is

Verse 1:
I don't wear Nike Air force ones no more, baby, I'm sorry
My sneakers cost nine hundred dollars and they made by Mauri
My shit's ridiculous, got gold in my toilet stool
And bitches wanna swim with diamonds in my swimming pool
""He's so cool!""
When the girls see me, they all drool
Because they know that I'm the one that's breaking all the rules
My mink coat's so long, you can mistake it for carpet
You got purple kush up in that blunt, homie? Just spark it
If twenty-six's ain't on your truck, you should just park it
Because you're out there like that department store, Target
I bought the Beatles catalog back from Michael Jackson
Then called his ass a child-molester right before I slapped him
Then sold the shit to Paul McCartney, then I double-taxed him
The chrome Desert Eagle convinced him - and relaxed him
Christina Aguilara came over, did me dirty
I told Beyonce stop trying to give me Jay z's birdy
I know you purdy, but go get me an ice-cold Pepsi
Then get your ass in this hot tub with me and Lisa Marie Presley
Hook:
Boss up
Don't get me crossed up
We like to drink the sauce up
Toss money at the bar and floss up
Boss up
Y'all know who's the nicest
I'm from Detroit, player
I don't care what the price is
Verse 2:
I walk on rose petals, my feet never touch the ground
Got two bitches - one to wipe me up, one to wipe me down
I sleep with three women all night, it's like a hardcore porn
They got me shaking in my bed like Ozzy Osbourne
I got the power
I'm pissing golden showers
The ho that wipe my ass say it smells like flowers
Is that necessary? Me and Hallie Barry in a bubble bath
Just got back from Germany, I'm jet lagged

Hook:
Boss up
Don't get me crossed up
We like to drink the sauce up
Toss money at the bar and floss up
Boss up
Y'all know who's the nicest
I'm from Detroit, player
I don't care what the price is

Verce 3:
I got four hundred acres in the city on the East side
Police, they work for me, deliver donuts and pizza
I pay Mariah Carey to come and sit on my toilet and sing to me
When I'm in the tub, and dry my booty when I'm done
I got three helicopters and I rent them out for videos
So rappers can front and try to boss up like me, I suppose
I got a pit with platinum slugs and a doghouse, with an escalator in it
You's a hater, admit it
I did it, I made it
You hate it, can't fade it
Murdered a bitch with my bare hands and only got a fine and paid it
Bought the jury each a bently, after the trial I took it back
Here I come! Look at that! Where my fucking hookers at?
Had a private jet, but I sold it to the Soviets
As boss as it gets, for real and flossing all hits
I'm underground, undetected, much respected
Never rejected, my downfall - don't expect it
Hook:
Boss up
Don't get me crossed up
We like to drink the sauce up
Toss money at the bar and floss up
Boss up
Y'all know who's the nicest
I'm from Detroit, player
I don't care what the price is"

You could be just like me if you quit with all that stupid shit (Woo!)
Why you acting hard now? You must wan' go see God now
The same niggas you were beefing with up in your yard now (Ha!)
If you 'bout to run, dog, I guess you better start now
Forgot to bring your gun, so you gotta use your heart now
It's hard to get rich, but it ain't shit to go to Hell (Ho!)

This Is Me,Laws,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Laws]
Reach like Dikembe, that’s what them say
Work like Ken Day to live like senkay
As the world turns, feelin' like I’m on a segway
Leader of the new crew, someone tell S.K
If you ain’t showin' love now, then it’s just hate
I don’t wanna do this show, kick rocks fuck face
Hammer out the stages for the love so long
But my nuts so long, then my love’s all gone
You could write my music off if it weren’t so strong
And it’s slowin' down my journey but it just hold on
Shoulda got it when you had it, when the gettin' was good
What it is is so great, they forgettin' you good
Make another guy nuts fall, you still sub-par
Funny style on the radio, think you Russ Paul
Actin' like I won a Grammy on my interviews
My recognition due, this is just an interlude

[Hook]
Y’all weak, what I do up on the beat
Probably get me one of three, this is me
So if you got ‘em so cheap, got ‘em coming every week
Thinkin' what I’m gon’ be, this is me
'Cause this dope music, if this don’t move ‘em
I don’t know what will, I don’t know what will
'Cause this dope music, if this don’t move ‘em
I don’t know what will, I don’t know what will
[Verse 2: Laws]
See, I used to pray for it till I became God
I became Laws, that’s one and the same
‘Cause if you study my name, if you spend enough time
I’m a comin' of age, you know I’m nothin' to tame
I should be up in the cave with Hannibal as my neighbor
But I’m so deranged, he be askin' me for some favors
Like Laws, how Clarisse givin' you nude shots?
You got so many songs that they thinkin' you 2Pac
Read up the new shots that drop in the streets
I could hear your sweat tricklin' down ‘cause you weak
And the beat’s so killed, they’d be happy to sign
The A&R's are tryna cover me with hazardous signs
Take Slim, Take Mos, put ‘em back in they prime
Wonder if my mother had some kind of magic vagine
‘Cause I was stuck with tryna keep backbackers happy with mine
Then I became all of my favorite rappers combined
Like Jay, Big, Pun, Pac, I ain’t ever going to stop
Dead in the middle of Florida, that’s where the buck stop
Three stacks, G rap, hold up, he’s back
Friday night, gotta cop Jimmie’s in a three pack
Redman, Face, Nas, get up out my face God
I’m about to black out, prison let me back out
What I go in for? Runnin' in the pen raw
One night, said I’m good, buddy that’s a ten four
[Hook]
Y’all weak, what I do up on the beat
Probably get me one of three, this is me
So if you got ‘em so cheap, got ‘em coming every week
Thinkin' what I’m gon’ be, this is me
'Cause this dope music, if this don’t move ‘em
I don’t know what will, I don’t know what will

Complicated,Outasight,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
This is where the talking ends and life begins
Let’s start again, it’s hard out here
Why does it have it to be so complicated?
This is where all the conversation stops and life begins
Why does it have to be so complicated?

[Verse 1: Outasight]
Welcome to my world where imagination kept running
Sprinting and sprinting, still trying to catch up
Walk into the bedroom of that only child
Singing and humming, what would be his future?
A prep school graduate with a C average
But I never seemed average
I would talk all night bout being Outasight
But I never kareem’d Magic till I put the words to bed
And woke up the action and canned the laughter
I ain’t trying to make a stand, I’m trying to fill up the rafters

[Hook]
[Verse 2: Outasight]
Explanations repeat in my mind
Voices skipping back and forth like stones ‘cross the pond
Taking trips down memory lane don’t bring pain
They be making me feel a certain way about those wasted days
And when I hear about acquaintances through old friends
I still hear they hating to no end
I shouldn’t even waste my breath on ‘em
‘Cause if I confronted ‘em, they’d get all choked up
And I wouldn’t waste my breath on ‘em
And I wish death on none except my old self
The lost kid who thought he was owed wealth
‘Cause he was so ill, oh well

Change the channel ’cause I don't feel watching no more
I used to get uptight about the littlest things
Untie the knots and loosen the strings
Welcome to the life I lead
I care about the money, don't confuse it with greed
And never see me running from my fears that been coming
From all angles, getting hot 90 degrees, is it the right one?
Hand on my heart, no star spangled
Paying dues is painful and I'm getting close
No GPS, nowhere to go

Never say never if ya ever felt the way I felt

Feeling better, new shirt, new sweater
Brand name put together yeah, I clean up nice
My advice not to add another vice
Can ya dig that? She writes on the last text of the night
And I can barely see that
Double vision living, I been doing it
And given myself to temptation
My girl has been patiently waiting for me to shape up
Yeah, circle gets the square, no squares in ya circle don't fit
This year is your year, mark it down on ya calendar
And if they testing character, I'mma pass it
Montana to Rice, two hands up

[Verse 1: Big L]
Yo, I got slugs for snitches, no love for bitches
Puttin' thugs in ditches when my trigger finger itches
I got a rep that make police jet, known to get a priest wet
I never beg for pussy like Keith Sweat
Is Big L slow? Hell no!
Bitches get fucked on the roof when I ain't got no hotel dough;
I'm known for yokin' Jacks
And beatin' them with smokin' gats
Leavin' token Blacks with broken backs and open caps
So with that bullshit, step to the rear, son
The last thing you want with Big L is a fair one
'Cause in a street brawl I strike men like lightnin'
You seen what happened in my last fight, friend? Aight then
I beat kids with lead pipes, I leave trails of dead mic's
Where I'm from, niggas jewels get ran like red lights
Old folks get mugged and raided, crimes are drug-related
And we live by the street rules that thugs created
Clowns get smoked about a thousand folks
Sellin' pounds of coke
Front in this town and get a TEC stuck down your throat
I'm tellin' you shit is about to get drastic soon
I'm quick to blast a goon
And break a mothafucker like a plastic spoon
I got the looks that make your hottie stare
I keep a shotty near
It's that nigga with knotty hair who Gotti fear
Tracks I'm known to roast until the microphone is ghost
Props I own the most, I'm leavin' niggas comatose
Front and get your brain pinched
Big L will have your whole gang lynched
I started smokin' dust and been insane since
This rap shit was a great gift
The other night some snake riffed, and got a hot lead facelift
All through high school I had braids, I kept mad blades
Stabbin' teachers to death that gave me bad grades
I cook the mic like a beef steak, 'cause my technique's great
And I'm the nigga police hate in each state
'Cause I'm the neighborhood lamper
Punk brother vamper; fuck around
You'll find my silk boxers in your mother's hamper
Cops drop when my Glock makes a pow sound
I'm from a wild town
You know my style, clown, so bow down!
[Interlude: Big L + JAY-Z]
Word up (say what?)
'95 style (yeah)
I got my man JAY-Z here (JAY-Z!)
Check it out now…
Check it, check it, check it out now

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Brothers can beg and borrow, still feel sorrow
When Jay Z, like Zorro, get in that ass, better luck tomorrow
I'm too much, nigga, so never should you rush
You need slow down or get yo' ass tore down
Check it out, I'm too cocky, to stop me you gotta kill me
And when I'm gone, you can still feel me, on the real, B
The shit is eternal, I rock the heavens well
Even if they won't let me in Heaven, I raise hell
'Til it's Heaven; recognize, the black cat with the nine lives
Get up off me, nigga, it's bad luck to cross me
I'm poppin' Crystal, shootin' game like missiles
As projected, all hoes affected by this style
I mack like Goldie, go back like the oldie
But the goody, pullin' R&B bitches, wearin' hoodies
They don't be knowin' the way I be flowin'
When I be goin' I be runnin' the track like Jesse Owens
I disrupt the natural scheme
The way that you do things with a swing
And have 'em rockin' like…
You say never you run, if ever you come
It's never you run so fast in your life to never have won
Come on and ride the rhythm, I produce like jizm
Just like the gods I start with knowledge
And follow with wisdom
For greater understandin', I'm landin' blows
And knockin' sense into those that oppose me
Enticin' when slicin' through tracks
You're screamin': ""Jesus Christ, he's back!""
And God knows he can rap
Me and L put rhythm on the map, so give him his dap
And me, I just take mine
Gimme those, gimme this, gimme that—fuck that!
You never see me stressed, in a GS
On the prize, my greedy eyes can't see no less
Jigga incredible, even my thoughts is federal
Like kidnapping, extortion and corruption
So you know, beatin' me will never come
Like a nun or tomorrow; I'm too thorough, nigga
I make moves, cause bowels to move
When I'm creepin' through your way
With a thousand little dudes
Armed with a piece like Islam
I make your eyes rise like yeast
Surprise, I feel no fear when facing y'all
Bet your lyrics jump off the track like racing cars
Emcee's tryin' to be the best
And even in dyin' couldn't be this def
I see no reason to stop cheesin'
Ever since L said, ""Throw three G's in!""
And we can get down and split the wealth
That's when I found I could do it myself, I get up…

Yeah, word life (Big L, try that mic out!)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (back to Big L)

I ain't do this in a while, check it out
One two, one two, check it out
One two, check it

[Verse 3: Big L]
Ayo, my crew be deliverin' hot lead when gats are clenched
Rappers I jack and lynch; nobody can fuck with the way
I be killin' them shits in rap events
Big L is the nigga you expect
To catch wreck on any cassette deck
I'm so ahead of my time my parents haven't met yet
I'm feelin' like Billy Bathgate
My rap style is past great
I love to fuck a bitch from the back and watch her ass shake
I probly got your mommy strung
Niggas hear me and take more notes than Connie Chung
My clan plans to get Giuliani hung
Never had a gassed head, got loot 'cause I stash bread
Try to tax and I'ma beat your faggot-ass half-dead
I stomp white cops 'til they life stops, for a low price, hops
'Cause my blood is colder than an ice box
On 1-3-9 you don't want a block war
'Cause my crew'll kill a nigga from the lobby to the top floor
And every time my MAC-11 bucks
I'm killin' at least seven ducks
I never was a follower of Reverend Butts
The bitch type I dislike, I'm rougher than a fist fight
All chicks ain't shit, ain't no such thing as Ms. Right
So we can never be a couple, hun
Fuck love! All I got for hoes is hard dick and bubble gum
And clown MC's I be attackin' quick
I'm on some rappin' shit and some car-jackin' shit
I ran up on this nigga name Mac in a black Ac'
And put the gat to his cap, click-clack
Sorry, Jack, but get up out of that!
My .38 works great, so make a mistake and hesitate
I can't wait to demonstrate this nickel plate
He didn't listen to what I was speakin'; he started reachin'
So I left him sleepin' with his temple leakin'

Goddamn, don't you know my status?
I'm flowin' the fattest
Mmm that is, mmm, I'm the baddest
No need to explain, my name the only thing that matters
For suckers who bite me, they find I'm a bit much to swallow
You're thinkin' that's hollow
The rhythm is too r-rugged to follow
It hit you like bam, biggity bam, bam, biggity bam
Let me take a little breath… goddamn

I'm definitely destined to make eight digits
Met up with L on the road to riches

Check it out, Jid-a, id-a, wid-I, zid-e, uh huh
Ain't none of these clowns fuckin' around
Ain't none of these clowns standin' their ground

The heats on sweat now
JAY-Z's on, be gone to the next town
Punk, jump up and get beat down
Check it out, check it out, check it out
Ladies be comin' out of their seats now
Shit, I got crazy skills, it's a pity the way I'm rippin'
Rugged rhythm through the city
Like dunnanna dunnanna di-di-dun dun ditty
I got rhythm, I hit 'em with rhythm, I
Hit 'em and split 'em, I did 'em, I get rid of them guys

Never treat ya wrong, to each his own
Snoop and Wiz the new Cheech and Chong
We up in smoke, making street schemes
Smoking sticky green, having sweet dreams
Break it down, put it in the Z-I zag
And pull the top back and let the ass drag
Hit the switch, quickest way to get a bitch
Executive branch, get a whiff of this
Black card, sack of dank
High School nigga what the fuck you think?
I’m passing all my classes with flying colors
And everyday I’m high as a muthafucker
[Hook: Wiz Khalifa & Snoop Dogg]
I’m smoking everywhere I go
No stick, no seeds, just Al Green
I always gotta keep one rolled
I keep that, need that, got that
I’m rolling every gram I own
That purp, that bomb, that kush
Don’t gotta understand, they know
I smoke that, fire that, good that good that

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Sun roof open, smoking while I’m rolling
My bitches only notice it if it's potent
Bottle of Perignon, we can go kick it by the ocean
Get in between your legs
Joint roaches and ashes all in your bed
You calling her babe, she calling me instead
Cause I put that game all in her head
She saw the crib, she know that I’m balling
When he ain't have nothing he used to stall 'em
Now I with the boss dogg, all the bad hoes want him
And my pockets on swole, I’m talking Rick Ross big
And now when we shop we don’t care what the cost is
Rolling up good, smoking that bomb shit
Blow a whole OZ, nigga thats boss shit
Now she all fuck her man, rubberbands in my pocket
Getting money, going hard for my profit
Bad bitch keep the joint stuffed like stockings
Young nigga out here getting bread, why knock it
[Hook: Wiz Khalifa & Snoop Dogg]
I’m smoking everywhere I go
No stick, no seeds, just Al Green
I always gotta keep one rolled
I keep that, need that, got that
I’m rolling every gram I own
That purp, that bomb, that kush
Don’t gotta understand, they know
I smoke that, fire that, good that good that

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
We welcome you to High School

Now roll up get high to it
We welcome you to highschool
We do just like we like to
We cordially invite you
Now roll up get high to it

End of Days,Vinnie Paz,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: David Icke]
“The greatest form of control is where you think you're free when you're being fundamentally manipulated and dictated to. One form of dictatorship is being in a prison cell and you can see the bars and touch 'em. The other one is sittin' in a prison cell but you can't see the bar—you think you're free.”
“What the human race is suffering from is mass hypnosis. We are being hypnotized by people like this: newsreaders, politicians, teachers, lecturers.”
“We are in a country and in a world that is being run by unbelievably sick people. The chasm between what we're told is going on, and what is really going on, is absolutely enormous.”

[Chorus: Block McCloud]
It's like we all know what's goin' down
But no one's sayin' shit, what happened to the home of the brave?
These motherfuckers, they controllin' us now
When no one's talkin' about how they made us modern-day slaves
And everybody's just walkin' around
Head in the clouds, we won't awake until we're dead in the grave
By then it's too late, we need to be ready to raise up
Welcome to the end of days

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Everybody a slave, only some are aware
That the government releasin' poison in the air
That's the reason I collect so many guns in my lair
I ain't never caught slippin', never underprepared, yeah
The Shaitan army, they display it proudly
George Bush the grandson of Aleister Crowley
They want you to believe the lie that the enemy Saudi
The enemy ain't Saudi, the enemy around me
There's fluoride in the water, but nobody know that
It's also a prominent ingredient in Prozac (For real?)
How could any government bestow that?
A [?] people who believe in political throwback
That's not all that I'm here to present you
I know about the Black Pope in Solomon's Temple (Yeah)
About the Vatican assassins and how they will get you
And how they cloned Barack Hussein Obama in a test tube
[Chorus: Block McCloud]
It's like we all know what's goin' down
But no one's sayin' shit, what happened to the home of the brave?
These motherfuckers, they controllin' us now
When no one's talkin' about how they made us modern-day slaves
And everybody's just walkin' around
Head in the clouds, we won't awake until we're dead in the grave
By then it's too late, we need to be ready to raise up
Welcome to the end of days

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
Whoever built the pyramids had knowledge of electrical power
And you know that that's the information that they suppress and devour
Who you think the motherfuckers that crashed in the tower?
Who you think that made it turn into ash in an hour?
The same ones that invaded Jerome
The ones that never told you about the skeletons on the Moon, yeah
The ones that poison all the food you consume
The ones that never told you 'bout the Mount Vesuvius tomb (Brrat)
The bird flu is a lie, the swine flu is a lie
Why would that even come as a surprise?
Yeah, the polio vaccine made you die
It caused cancer and it cost a lot of people they lives
Do y'all know about Bohemian Grove?
How the world leaders sacrificin' children in robes?
Lucifer is God in the public school system
I suggest you open up your ears and you listen
[Chorus: Block McCloud]
It's like we all know what's goin' down
But no one's sayin' shit, what happened to the home of the brave?
These motherfuckers, they controllin' us now
When no one's talkin' about how they made us modern-day slaves

“The greatest hypnotist on the planet Earth is a oblong box in the corner of the room. It is constantly telling us what to believe is real.”
“If you can persuade people that what they see with their eyes is what there is to see, you've got them. Because they'll laugh in the face of an explanation that portrays the bigger picture of what's happening…and they have.”"

You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong

We can dance until we die

This is real, so take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

Sun won't shine, moon won't glow
This star of mine, is my star no more
I did you wrong and this I know
Come keep me warm, please, girl, I'm so cold
Woah, let me talk to you

[Verse 1]
Cold winter nights, by myself
Blankets just won't do, I need your help
'Cause I don't wanna miss the way your body feels no more
No I don't
It's only been two days since you've been gone
But those few moments, feel so long
Now I'm sitting at the edge of the bed, with my hands on my head
And the only thing I been thinking while I been alone is that

[Chorus]
I can't let you go, I won't let you leave
One thing that I know is baby, you were made for me for sure
My life is in your hands, I'm meant to be your man
We're made to be together
So baby no, don't go
Girl, if you don't know, I'd give my heart, I'd give my soul for sure
I'm right here on my knees
If you were to leave, I'd lose my everything

You complete me baby
Don't you let, nothing come, between us, hey
Alcohol has been, my best friend
And I admit some tears, have passed my chin
Crying in the bed over you, just ain't manly
But I don't give a damn, no
'Cause I could wash these pillow cases, I could change these sheets baby
But I need you back in the crib cooking up some of that good chicken and gravy
Mash potatoes, homemade lemonade
Want you back to the old days, you been with me since I had long braids

And I can't let you go, I won't let you leave
One thing that I know is baby, you were made for me for sure
My life is in your hands, I'm meant to be your man
We're made to be together
So baby no, don't go
Girl, if you don't know, I'd give my heart, I'd give my soul for sure
I'm right here on my knees
If you were to leave, I'd lose my everything

Girl my heart won't beat right, I can't sleep nights
Ooh you're haunting my dreams
All I know is I hold onto memories
When you touch, I touch you
When you moaning, you scream, oh baby
Girl, you know just what you do to me
I acted so stupidly
And unless you want to take away my soul, no, don't go

I can't let you go, I won't let you leave
One thing that I know is baby, you were made for me for sure
My life is in your hands, I'm meant to be your man

See me I put in work, man, I been doing dirt for so long
Them niggas get laid out
Niggas run through my crib to holla at the kid
That's when I start bringing them thangs out
Then we go through the strip hanging up out the whip
Dumping clips off at they whole clique, mane
When witnesses around they know how we get down
So when the cops come they ain't see shit, mane
My soldiers slanging 'caine, sunny, snowy, sleet or rain
Come through the hood and you can cop that
I'm sittin' on some change, G-Unit that's the gang
Come through here stunting you'll get popped at
[Hook: 50 Cent]
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
I came in this game knowing niggas gon' hate me
Just for the simple fact they know that I'm a rider
I got a hell of a aim, I keep on telling you, mane
I swear ain't nobody gon' find ya
When I get lifted I'm tempted to tear your block up
You niggas can't run 'cause I'm behind ya
Me and Chili in your city with a couple nine-milli's
You better stay in line, bro
'Cause if I walk it I'll talk it, you know we'll walk up and pop it
I love the sound of gunfire, bro
Right now we smacking 'em with platinum and they hate it
'Cause we made it, that's what we keep that iron for
I represent it 'cause I'm in it
UTP until I'm finished, Juvenile, they can't stop us
And I admit it, I live it
I'll knock a baller off his pivot with this motherfucking chopper
[Hook: 50 Cent]
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks

I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
My twenty-inches spinning, you always see me grinning
And you hear niggas call me grimy
They hit me with them bricks and I ain't pay 'em shit
I'm outta town, they can't find me
When I come back around, man, I'ma back 'em down
I run up busting that TEC, mane
If you ain't got a gun and you can't fucking run
My advice is you hit the deck, mane
But if you get away and come back another day
My soldiers'll leave you wet, mane
'Cause we know where you be and we know where you stay
And we'll come checking through your set, mane
Man, you heard what I said, now get it in your head
I ain't paying no fucking debt, mane
'Cause you's a middle man, what you don't understand?
You's a fucking fake ass connect, mane
[Hook: 50 Cent]
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though"

Hold up im too thowed, im the young capo
5 star general, Lucky Luciano
Yo my checks too fat, the banks can't cash it
Gimme ten days, meanwhile I got plastic
Country to country I live in hotels
No ashy elbows, pedicured toenails
Sittin on a beach chair, 200 dollar chanclas
Am I in Acapulco or Puerto Vallarta
Sippin outta pineapple actin a fool
Step out on my balcony and check out my view
Im lookin brand new, I get menages crunk
Lucky Lu cleaner then Andre Monk
Open up my closet and you're in the galleria
Im the shit homeboy, call my lucky diarrhea
Covered in diamonds, get a load of this wrist
Just to show out and stunt, im the dope house prince

Never borin or simple, man im really excitin

I fought a dude with some braids and started pullin his hair
But my boys back me up and leave nobody standin
Im like ""why y'all jump in? man I almost had 'em""
And they was like ""Los, he was beatin yo ass""
I was letting him get tired, man you messed up my plans
Anyway, I'mma write a song about it and tell
All my fans that I beat him up all by myself--haha

Shoot like Ming when he hit 12 footaz
I be pullin hoes like a kid pick boogaz
You can see my rolli when I dip guacamole
Got a all white pit like Angelina Jolie
I put red dots on 9 milla Glocks
Might make you think that you got chicken pox
Got rims like a spida, weed to the lighta

Im at the dope house smoked out, Baby Bash loc'd out
Doin tracks with charlie brown when broke out
He choked out his C.O., did it on the D-lo
Went to see his wife and his daughter and his mijo
The game is so frio, now he tippin Styrofoam
Said he gotta be right back before the lights is on
Buts its all gravity, learn from tragedy
Just to let you know how cold them bastards be
Cause when it comes to the jealous man it gets messy
I fuck around and gotta turn into some Joe Pesci
I pimp the blood out ya mama and ya loved ones
Sell dog shit to ya uncles and ya cousins
And guaranteed that you won't say nada

The Sea is Rising,Bliss n Eso,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: Bliss and Eso]
And all I know is the sun is shining
Yet we fight all through the night
While the 'bergs are melting (Yeah) and the sea is rising
I don't know, so I ask 'em why

[Verse 1: Bliss]
Why are they refusing to listen?
Why are these troops on a mission?
And why are they shooting these victims
Over their view of religion?
Yeah, why do we all search for love like we got Cupid's addiction?
Why with politicians, you can't tell the truth from the fiction?
Why do we pollute where we're living?
Why are these youth put at risk?
And why is this ruling dominion kept us consumed in this prison? Nah, nah, nah, I won't jump through the hoops of this system
Nothing stands between you and the pursuit of your vision
I grab a loop of this rhythm, it puts the juice in my pistons
So jump back, react, spit in the booth with precision
And when I'm cruising with Izm, yeah, I'm deucing the spliff
And it's a BnE show, bitch, getting loose was a given
I don't want them to look back when the future was written
And know we killed ourselves
With nuclear fission and stupid decisions
Shit, I'd rather an asteroid due for collision
Then know the planet got fucked by the human condition
Sing the tune with conviction
[Chorus: Bliss and Eso]
And all I know is the sun is shining
Yet we fight all through the night
While the 'bergs are melting and the sea is rising
I don't know, so I ask ;em why
And all I know is the sun is shining
Yet we fight all through the night
Well, if you don't know, shit, I don't know
I guess all we can do is ask 'em why

[Ad-Libs: Eso]
Yeah, I'm an old school poet
Yeah, yo, yo

[Verse 2: Eso]
Yo, I'm an old school poet, I cherish the ink
That cosmic cowboy that doesn't care what they think
Real magic isn't card tricks, big cribs and cars, bitch
It's making something out of nothing through this hardship
And even though that the Earth is weak
We still bomb each other and idol what the churches speak
It's like this land is either run by Labor or Liberal
But don't get it twisted, they're the same as the criminals
So open your eyes, simply notice the issue
That we stuck to our guns without promoting the pistol
And we orchestrated the sound that we all love
Split because of colour, but bound because of blood
So before we all blow and they sell the scene
Know that the only thing that's bulletproof's my self-esteem
See, this is way beyond cash and ego tripping
It's an epic electric Eso ecosystem, grow with me
[Chorus: Bliss and Eso]
And all I know is the sun is shining
Yet we fight all through the night
While the 'bergs are melting and the sea is rising
I don't know, so I ask 'em why
And all I know is the sun is shining
Yet we fight on through the night
Well, if you don't know, shit, I don't know
I guess all we can do is ask 'em why

[Interlude: Eso & (Sampled)]
I don't have to tell you things are bad
Everybody knows things are bad
Pollution th-thr-threatens
Recognise the icecaps are melting quick
Kids trust no one 'cause fire burn dem
The air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat
It's an inferno land, pollution th-thr-threatens
Recognise the icecaps are melting quick
Fuck your race riot, fuck all that shit
We are all here together in this country as fuckin' one
As one
It's all about peace, love and unity
Sing it, peace, love and unity
C'mon, peace, love and unity
[Chorus: Bliss and Eso]
And all I know is the sun is shining
Yet we fight all through the night
While the 'bergs are melting and the sea is rising

And all I know is the sun is shining
Yet we fight all through the night

I guess all we can do is ask 'em why

The seventh scripture...
Will be read by the inquisitor of all intelligence, Jonathan Coltrane
Rally forth, my people [?], rally forth
Since ancient times, Chinese people where samurais and Japanese people accumulating by the mountains would engage in warfare of martial arts styles
It was passed on through generations through monks, students, and many others. Just like the poets
That's right. Ladies and gentlemen, poetry has been in existence, since, if you will, the beginning of time. Even the dinosaurs used to move in a [?]
Even the ancestors, the sharks, used to ""hooo"" in a sea-like manner. My friends, poetry has been among us since the beginning of time
Amen to Coltrane, amen to Coltrane, amen to Coltrane
The seventh speaker of the seven [?]"
Addicted,Bliss n Eso,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Eso]
I was born in the 80s with that summertime love
Then changed the whole game like ""what have I done?""
Out the gutter I come to touch the bright sun
And from the highest heights motherfucker, I jump
Free in the sky of belief I can fly
Ain't no tellin' what they're sellin', man they're sheep in disguise
Keep this in mind, I keep on my grind
I can do it any way I wanna do it
Bitch, I'll sleep when I die
Explosive, ferocious, get up get down that's showbiz
Power to the people that have freedom in their focus
I hope this helps you when you're under the thumb
When you feel like nothing can save you
When you feel like jumping the gun
Stop relax and remember even in the worst weather
You'll find a way cross it, there'll be brighter days honest
So get up, get out and get somethin', that's on the real
Forget what you were taught and show these people how you feel
Like
[Chorus]
Who are you to tell me how to live my life
'Cause I won't give this up
These are my shoes, my view
My cue to say I do give a fuck
And pretty soon I'ma bloom and it'll be all right
Every day's another chance to ignite
'Cause I'm addicted (uh-oh), I'm addicted (uh-oh)
I'm addicted to this universal feeling called life

[Turntablism: DJ Izm]
""Guidance is internal""

[Verse 2: Bliss]
Since a foetus, explored life's subtle secrets
From my fingertips to my unique double helix
I can see history, I can see the past lessons
It's your right, never be afraid to ask questions
How can every religion claim to be the only one?
How can they preach love yet fight each other holding guns?
I think the golden sun may be able to shed some light
I'd rather push peace and knowledge to defend our rights
These leaders in suits tell us to fight for one side
You think they got their sons and daughters on the front line?
Not down for war but down to get an education
We're all equal yet they push synthetic separation
But in this matrix, I won't be failin' to make it
This is my cosmos baby, space sailin' with Sagan
I heard it's not where your from it's where you're carvin' your view
I heard you don't have to wear a suit to argue the truth
And so
[Chorus]
Who are you to tell me how to live my life
'Cause I won't give this up
These are my shoes, my view
My cue to say I do give a fuck
And pretty soon I'ma bloom and it'll be all right
Every day's another chance to ignite
'Cause I'm addicted (uh-oh), I'm addicted (uh-oh)
I'm addicted to this universal feeling called life

[Turntablism: DJ Izm]
""We're through the region of maximum dynamic pressure now"" ""Yeah, they finally gave me a window to look out""
""Visual is Go today""
""And ignition""

[Verse 3: Eso & Bliss]
They spoon feed but I won't be takin' that sedative
'Cause my thoughts are way too precious to waste on the negative
I keep them critical yet positive to break the chains
Every dawn is a new chance to make a change
Think about all the energy swirling all around us
We project it, we get affected, this is profound stuff
Earth is my garden and I grew from it
I pay the youth homage 'cause I know their view's honest
Can you read between the lines of the news comments
Fightin' over land just to take some fuel from itI guess oil boils down to some cool profits
But war, what is it good for? Really, who wants it?
Like
[Chorus]
Who are you to tell me how to live my life
'Cause I won't give this up
These are my shoes, my view
My cue to say I do give a fuck
And pretty soon I'ma bloom and it'll be all right
Every day's another chance to ignite
'Cause I'm addicted (uh-oh), I'm addicted (uh-oh)
I'm addicted to this universal feeling called life"

Vince on ice, sex chicks — all types
General status, smoothness mixed with malice
Trips to Dallas, built a pool in my palace
Who want what? From more moneys, I want a cut
Extortin', start from the corners that brung us up
Sixty-inch screen, laser-disc with the beam
It's my life, I'm holdin' the dice, don't intervene

Reflections,Bliss n Eso,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Bliss]
Well I've been
Running round this globe for a couple o' spins now
Grown from school days the outcast from the in crowd
I keep my chin down as time flies and seasons vanish
Hold the self-belief to manage grip and seize my canvas
Paint the colour that connects with me and speaks my language
Try to release my baggage be free to relieve the anguish
When it's freezing cold feel the warmth between my toes
Of this earth I walk, creation is what feeds my soul
It can ease the load climbing on the steepest road
So I preach this ode to remind myself to keep control
When it's all too much and I dive to free fall
I try to centre myself on the centre of life's see-saw
I crave the fun times, the sunshine entices
Of wandering temptation and unwind my vices
From the drugs to the girls and the beers I'm drinking
And remember what's at staking staring in the mirror thinking

[Hook]
Well I've been down this road before
It's been one hell of a ride
The challenge is to balance on that fine line
Between the earth and sky
And I will wait for the morning sun
Till the way is clear as day
Well ok hallelujah
Now watch me take the stage
Oh a oh
Oh a oh
Oh a oh
Oh a oh yeah
[Verse 2: Eso]
It's the hunt for the high, the people I've met, the places I've seen (ohh)
The stories I've told, the forks in the road chasing my dream (woahh)
On the brink stop and think I'm telling you dreams don't cost a thing
I know we all die alone but I feel faith within that cosmic link
I surf the starlight where every wish is worthy
Only happy when you've got it often makes you miss the journey
Coincide with chemistry, flow and ride my energy
We'll grow our grass greener than that other side will ever be
The man on the mic, the rose on my drum kit
Happy with my reflection even though I've done dumb shit
And sometimes I think of stuff keen to get that instant rush
Fiending for that pick me up that's probably why I drink too much
It's not the feeling of the high when you're running round
It's the friends that you find when you're coming down
From smooth sailing to foggy rocky roads
I won't be faked by my reflection like that dog that dropped his bone

[Hook]
Well I've been down this road before
It's been one hell of a ride
The challenge is to balance on that fine line
Between the earth and sky
And I will wait for the morning sun
Till the way is clear as day
Well ok hallelujah
Now watch me take the stage

And break this bitch down like Bam Bam with his bat
You players act pussy like Jessica Rabbit
I'ma hit you with some shit to get your head in a hammock
I'm that poet burst on that park bench to smoke
The only Superman who knows Clarke Kent's a joke
I fist fuck freedom, I fight for my right
To hit the lab with my pad and have the time of my life
You're damn right, I've been sparkin up the high state
And fight in the night with my armoured butterflies

Drown in my dreams when you look at my eyes
And just bounce to my beat to prove the boogie's alive

Oh, you know bro, it's those nutty loco kids
Got the crowd bouncing like a sea of cats on pogo sticks
We on that next level, dropping turds, bombing your whole plane
2008 rap Jonathan Coltrane
My lab was built great, plush leather couches and silk drapes
Try furniture made out of planks of wood and milk crates
We both underground blokes spitting profound quotes
Sipping the local lager mingling with the town folk
Just two white boys and a half Arab man
Travel the land in a old busted thrash caravan
See hip hop finds us when we feel all lost
So we gonna ride this motherfucker 'til the wheels fall off

No fuckin' around, I came to get you in the vibe
Grab life by the balls and never look behind
'Cause when that bling bling dies, you can bet I'll be alive

A revolution of radical rebels writing raw, reflective rap
Of this cataclysmic cool calm collected cat
The front row covered when I'm spittin' the rhyme spray
Got skeletons on stage playin' rickety Steinway's
I sit with the owls, flippin' 'em out, flippin' the vowels
The midnight paddock runner who's tippin' the cows
Spittin' it foul, down and dirty 'cause my crew's shabby
All I want's my girl, a beer, a used caddy and this dude's happy

Got asses leavin' the seat when I'm freakin' the beat
Just husslin' like Larry Flint with the freedom of speech

So while it seems like there's millions of cats that stack loot
My crews here to stay like tax and tattoos
And there's no match for the kid that blows your mind
'Cause beatin' me's like me returnin' videos on time

Call me Jimmy Open Doors, day dreamin' with a spliff
Puttin' pressure on the player tryna look like the cool guy

From shows of a thousand, we bounce 'em with rap and spinnin' tunes
To packed house parties rockin' some cats living room
We shakin' the ground, breakin' the bounds, makin' a sound
Your hands up, we hands down taking the crown (C'mon)

[Chorus: Eso & Bliss]
Well, you heard about them boys from a foreign land
They gonna stroll across the globe with the mic in they hand
And they be puttin' it down the only way they know how
So sing it, ""la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la""

Party at My Place,Bliss n Eso,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Bliss]
Yo I know a place that you lot can play
It's a party that you can hear like two blocks away
Fuck an attitude and fuck the right to apparel to wear
Fuck driving I rolled up on a barrel of beer
And busting through the door to Bliss N Eso blessing the speakers
It's so packed in here that I'm stepping on sneakers
But this MC corners me, he's got my patience spent
'Cause he's wack but thinks he's the shit like David Brent
Gave me his demo to Sus, He wouldn't let go of my nuts
I was like ""Dude I'll be right back just need a bevo to clutch""
Yo, Weapo what's up? I got the urge to write a sentence
Izm rocked up with three Virgin flight attendents
When his beer runs out there'll be some trouble and some bugging
So open the fridge and stash a couple in the oven
I'm a sneaky little cunty but believe me
It was funny when I found two mingers gettin' freaky in the dunny
(""Wait that's not a girl, what's up bro?"")

[Verse 2: Motley & Eso]
It's me Motley
Didn't I tell you fuckers to watch me
Bliss, you know I'm pissed man you should've stopped me
Now I'm drunk and this fat chicks got me
Hand-cuffed to the taps and now she's filling the bath
I'm from the UK so she love the way that I rap
But the bitch got sideburns worse than Shaft
Shit's not funny man please don't laugh
That's when Eso bust down the door
Hey yo, get your arse up off my bathroom floor
You've only had a couple of drinks we got more
It's beer o'clock bro I told you before
Now hit this weed. But I don't smoke
Ahh what the hell man just one toke
Nah, take two hits but watch you don't
Watch you don't-watch you don't choke!
[Hook: Bliss]
Well there's a party at my place and you're all invited
A place to just chill, get ill and spend the night in
You like that? ""Hell yeah!""Well, get amongst the buzz
And crack a night cap bro, this one's on us

[Verse 3: Eso]
Ay yo it's freak fest two double o' five
It's quiet in the hood but there's trouble at mine
Brothers that are broke, we don't know how to be rich
There's stolen steaks on the barbie on my balcony bitch
I'm teaching newcomers how to shape and make a bong
While Bliss hides my beer so we can take em' later on
Plus the colour of my c'mons like the Canberra Raiders
It got me crackin' jokes with Izm playin' San Andreas
We got the whole block shacking outrageous
Cause a party ain't a party without waking your neighbours
Or makin' arrangements to go break in a basement
And steal another motherfucking case for these cavemen
Kicking flows freestyling on some ill shit
If you ain't down with us then you not on the bill kid
So piss off cause this cost nothing for my brothers
Just a house party full of nuttty motherfuckers
So bounce, break something, shake the house down
Get on a stage and then make the crowd shout
Bounce, break something, shake the house down
Get on a stage and then make the crowd shout

[Verse 4: Motley & Bliss]
Look, I'm so dizzy Izzy Izm got busy
On the ones and twisy; two's
Now I'm drinkin' Victoria Bitter out of my shoes
That's when Bliss told me the bad news
The door bust open there was two cops to see
They turned the music off and said ""Who's got the weed?""
And everyone went quiet, but then they told us the point
""Calm down love, just roll the copper a joint""

[Hook: Bliss]

Party people the place I'd like To get to know ya
Girls shaking their tootsies
With a bim bam boogie and a bottle of whisky...
With the hip-hop hash, fix with the big cities
When the people on the party to get LIP
Cause its my house, my crib, my kingdom
Where the floorboards creek and the kids keep singing

Hip Hop
It will never die
Hip Hop
It will never, never die

[Verse 1: Nas]
Ghetto nigga strutting, with nothing but dreams in Queens broke
Mac-10s, you can smell the PCP smoke
Melle Mel told it real, in the music he wrote
Those were the days I remember, we used to be close
Then I was nine, coldest winter I remember
Was slipping in December, two feet of snow
Yeah, that's the East Coast, that black ice
Symbolize the rap life, it was slick and smooth
I understood I had to come from the hood
Doing the Pee Wee Herman, the Smurf
Before them phones chirped
The block's drugs flowing, didn't have your own work
You had to have somebody else's, a small chrome on your pelvis
Starter jacket, Blue Georgetown or Green Celtic
Your girl's too expensive, she want shellfish
Red Lobster was popping, standing on that line forever
I wish somebody would step on my Bally leathers
Now it's whatever
Hip Hop's forever
Kept my radio on 98 or BLS
Had a pre-pubescent lyric gift, but niggas never hear me spit
My little brother tried to warn them, I was a tornado coming
He knew from inside like the eye of a storm, and told my pops about it
He gave us tickets to that Wild Style flick
Double Trouble retarded, we was the proudest
I never had a summer job
Sweeping leaves, socks to my knees
Home-made shorts, cut off Lee's
I ain't work a day in my life
Wiping away eraser off the paper, man
I'm just trying to say it right
Big radio, tape's slowing down
Lower the lights go, battery dead
I got to freeze them 'till they're ice cold
In the freezer later, I'm staring at the speaker
Sunk in them 808s deeper, cleaning my sneakers
With the bristles of a toothbrush, soap and water
I let the shoestrings soak in water
[Outro: Nas & Chrisette Michele]

Words I Never Said,Lupe Fiasco,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said
I can't take back the words I never said

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
I really think the War on Terror is a bunch of bullshit
Just a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets
How much money does it take to really make a full clip?
9/11, building 7, did they really pull it?
Uh, and a bunch of other coverups
Your child's future was the first to go with budget cuts
If you think that hurts, then wait, here comes the uppercut
The school was garbage in the first place, that's on the up and up
Keep you at the bottom but tease you with the upper crust
You get it, then they move it, so you never keeping up enough
If you turn on TV, all you see's a bunch of what-the-fucks
Dude is dating so and so, blabbering 'bout such and such
And that ain't Jersey Shore, homie, that's the news
And these the same people supposedly telling us the truth
Limbaugh is a racist, Glenn Beck is a racist
Gaza Strip was getting bombed, Obama didn't say shit
That's why I ain't vote for him, next one either
I'm a part of the problem, my problem is I'm peaceful
And I believe in the people, yeah
[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Now we can say it ain't our fault if we never heard it
But if we know better, then we probably deserve it
Jihad is not holy war, where's that in the worship?
Murdering is not Islam, and you are not observant
And you are not a Muslim
Israel don't take my side 'cause look how far you've pushed them
Walk with me into the ghetto, this where all the kush went
Complain about the liquor store, but what you drinking liquor for?
Complain about the gloom, but when'd you pick a broom up?
Just listening to Pac ain't gon' make it stop
A rebel in your thoughts ain't gon' make it halt
If you don't become a actor, you'll never be a factor
Pills with million side effects, take 'em when the pain's felt
Wash 'em down with diet soda, killing off your brain cells
Crooked banks around the world would gladly give a loan today
So if you ever miss a payment, they can take your home away

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said, never said
I can't take back the words I never said
[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
I think that all the silence is worse than all the violence
Fear is such a weak emotion, that's why I despise it
We scared of almost everything, afraid to even tell the truth
So scared of what you think of me, I'm scared of even telling you
Sometimes I'm like the only person I feel safe to tell it to
I'm locked inside a cell in me, I know that there's a jail in you
Consider this your bailing out, so take a breath, inhale a few
My screams is finally getting free, my thoughts is finally yelling through

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said"
Gotta Make It to Heaven,50 Cent,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Megahertz]

[Chorus]
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven

[Verse 1]
Some say I'm paranoid, I say I'm careful how I choose my friends
I been to ICU once, I ain't going again
First Z got murked then Roy got murked
And homie still in the hood, why he ain't getting hurt?
I smell something fishy, man, it might be a rat
Damn, niggas switching sides on niggas just like that
You know me, I stay with a bitch on her knees
And give guns away in the hood like it's government cheese
Spray off Suzuki's, eleven hundred cc's
No plate on the back, straight squeezing the MAC
In the hood they identify niggas by they cars
So I switch up whips to stay off the radar
I ain't gotta be around to make shit hot
I'll send Yayo to dump 30 shots on your block
You should spray that TEC, nigga, if I say get it done
I'll make you wet niggas if you 'round me son
[Chorus]
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven

[Verse 2]
When I come through the hood, I don't stop to rap to niggas
Get close enough to smack ya, then clap ya nigga
Pop tried to front so I waved the chrome on his ass
Point blank range I spazzed, pulled a bone on his ass
Two weeks later niggas came through with MACs to lay me down
They sprayed, I played dead and got the fuck off the ground
Out the blue I get a phone call: ""Fifty what up?""
""They sent a bitch at me, I sent the bitch back cut up""
I don't play that pussy shit, I done told you, boy
Front on me you gon' meet one of my soldiers, boy
Cousin Twin shot up his mamma crib, now he in jail
Tripping off flicks of Blu Cantrell, pussy, and black tail
Pop mama moved, but she don't talk to him no mo'
The shells from Twin's fo'-fo' blew the hinge off her door
Without that check every month how she going to pay for the crib?
Man, social service finna come and take them kids

[Chorus]
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven
[Verse 3]
Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change
The courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference
In AA they make you say that
That's the prayer they burn in your head when you  in CASAT
Man, I might talk to you while we up in them pens
But when we come home that don't mean we gon' fucking be friends
The shells pass your head close enough to hear 'em whistle
Thank God they missed you and go grab your pistol
In the hood niggas running 'round acting crazy
Buying little Air Jordans for maybe babies
See it might be his and it might be yours
Because them broads in the projects is straight up whores
Man, it don't take much for you to get in them drawers
You can have them on they back or on all fours
You ain't got to tell me, you feeling this shit
Because I hear what I'm saying, I know I'm killing this shit

[Chorus]
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven"

E-Class, I think we got a problem

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, big money in this bitch, if you didn't knew
Big business, minus the business suit
Even I look in the mirror, like ""Is it you?""
Then I say ""I must be the hottest if it isn't you""
Stay fresh, from my top to my tennis shoes
New coupe, no top, big tennis shoes
Never slippin', even on the side of a swimming pool
We don't get ridiculed, we get rid of fools
They said I couldn't play football, I was too small
They said I couldn't play basketball, I wasn't tall
They said I couldn't play baseball at all
And now every day of my life, I ball
And they say you ain't great until someone assassinate
And I feel like MLK
Yeah, ""I Have a Dream"" to be your worst nightmare
Now meet The Boss of The Cartel, Ross
[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm a sinner, not Satan
Sittin' on Lorenzos and I seem really patient
Picture the equation
People takin' pictures and they really gettin' flagrant
Flaggin' down my spaceship, sergeant sniffin' for a fragrance
Yayo! Yayo! He wanna sniff the yayo
Flyin' saucer on the hasa, in the casa just to lay low
Make more money man, that's the motto for the mob
Need a blow-job, my motto, get a model for the job
Go hard, no job, hustler, no prob
Post up, nigga what? Finger-fuck your whole squad
Forty round extend-o, flip it for my kinfolk
Luxury tax on them packs, if you didn't know
Bought a new crib, niggas feelin' like I hid
3.2, but I did it for the kids
More guns than a pawnshop
Got my whole arm rocked
Keep the 760 double-parked in the wrong spot
Still hustlin', boss

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, you gotta pay for this
I remember when I used to pray for this
This, this is classic, some shit you might not see again
And we taxin', you don't want it, nigga, leave it then
And we taxin', you don't want it, nigga, leave it then
And we ain't tryna see the Pen
Like a needle in a haystack, we ain't tryna see the 'pin'
This is a luxury tax
[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
Yeah, imagine this, no, imagine that
Gave me my sack, like ""Good luck getting back""
I'm like, ""The fuck I'm gon' hide it at?""
And if I'm not careful, be the same place they find it at
And I'm a winner, if I make it across the finish line
Puttin' food on the table like it's dinner time
And this is what you call stereotyping by far
Can you tell me my your dog keep sniffin' my car?
Got the audacity to call me a liar
So what you got in your trunk?
Oh, just a spare tire
You niggas talked blow, while I sold mine
Like a bad cramp, it's lockin' up in no time
More time in the kitchen than I spent in the studio
""Gangsta's Paradise"", and I ain't talkin' 'bout Coolio
Can't lie, still addicted to the odour
Got a ice cold Pepsi, still thinkin' Coca-Cola

Yeah, you gotta pay for this

This, this is classic, some shit you might not see again

I'm up early in the morning and I'm dressed in black
Hold on, every morning I get dressed in black
While y'all half-ass, nigga my pants saggin'
I'm gettin' money and my swag, black-flaggin'
Million dollar status, fully automatic
Heavy on the Henny, even harder on the women
If it wasn't for Reverend, I'd probably be pimpin' and shit
Pops, my papi, is already in me
I tried trappin', shit sent me to prison
Got mad and went to snappin', so homicide came to visit
I smell gun powder, so you got one hour
To come up with every damn dollar; or you're done, dollar
It costs to ball, dog
Especially when the players on your team consider you as the ball hog
You treat me like Shaq, and you Kobe
But I ain't say you owe me, nigga
But act like you know me, nigga

Someone I can spend my life with
Leave the keys to the Benz
Wedding band with the gems
You're someone I feel all right with
Someone to have my kids
The one I can depend on
[Hook]
You never try me
Always stood right by me
Make living lively highly
Spoken of, my only love, the only one
You're my wifey
Make my life complete
Sweet—but you know when to flip it street
Freak—but only when it comes to me
See—that’s why you’re my wifey

[Bridge 2: R.L.]
Skinny designer fit real jiggy
Ain't afraid to hump with me when we get busy
Ride out, I licky-licky 'til I get dizzy
Toes done, fresh scent, I think it's sizzy
Hoes, none, she was the one down with me
Used to struggle, now we bubble, countin' G's with me
Pop the champagne, let's take a sippy-sippy
Describe you, I try to
You're my wifey

[Outro: R.L. & (Lil Mo)]
Will you be my wifey?
(Yes, I'll be your wifey)
Say you'll be my wifey
(Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Will you be my wifey?
(Yes, I'll be your wifey)
Say you'll be my wifey

Hustle Hard,JAY-Z,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I hustle hard in any hustle that you pitch
Skinny nigga toothpick
But I do lift weights like I'm using roids
Rolls Royce keep my movements, smooth while maneuvering
Through all the manure in the sewer that I grew up in
Choices we make trying to escape
And I don’t need no hook for this shit
This is not for commercial usage
Please don’t categorize this as music
Please don’t compare me to other rappers
Compare me to trappers
I’m more Frank Lucas than Ludacris
And Luda's my dude
I ain't trying to diss
Like Frank Lucas is cool, but I ain't trying to snitch
I’ma follow the rules no matter how much time I’ma get
I’ma live and die with the decisions that I’ma pick
So fuck the haven for caving, that’s why we don’t speak
Made men ain't supposed to make statements
End of the story I followed the code, cracked the safe
Other niggas ain't in the game so they practice hate
Hustle hard in any hustle that you pitch
[Refrain: Jay-Z]
Hustle hard in, hustle hard in
Hustle hard in, hustle hard in
Hustle hard in any hustle that you pitch

[Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]
Money to be made best believe a niggas glocking
I run it myself like a quarterback option
I pitch her 10 G's tell the bitch to go shopping
She buy herself some clothes and she brought me back the chopper
See niggas tryna kick but no I don't play soccer
I'm all about my cake, I'm trying to marry Betty Crocker
A package on the way you know my whip game proper
And off of 1 ki I see 70 thousand dollars
Now I will shoot dice, smoking on a joint
I bet with your gawdy we hit 5 straight points
Yo we kept hustling, yo we kept grinding
You rap about money and a nigga might sign ya
You rap about me and a nigga might find ya
Banana in your ass with your head right behind ya
Dope game bitch his momma woulda bought em
If you holla at me, a fee

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
Bitches come a dime a dozen
I fuck em sisters, cousins
It’s a revolving door
Pussy going, pussy coming
And when they go to you it's coming back to me with money
I tell her put them shoes on and keep my paper running
I put my mack down just like a G supposed to
And if she don’t come home with it then she’s sleeping over
I got em creeping over, we do it then a soda
I like them Ameriie, you can have them Omarosas
Them niggas down below us, baby we up and over
I’m trying to get inside that thing that sits between your shoulders
I’m talking large totals
I’m talking large motors
I’m talking burning rubber then melted Pirelli odor
I’m hopping out a Lotus, you looking at my bitch
You wanna holla, you can holla take her on a trip
But when the deed done, you gotta send her back

So while ya talk about the money that I owe like it's as if I didn't know man it don't mean nothin' to me

Dear Mr. Policeman
Am I wrong, ain't you supposed to keep the peace, man?
I coulda swore that I was driving pretty peaceful
So why the hell is you pulling over me for?
Is it this black Mercedes? (Oh na, I get it, I get it, I get it)
Or cause I'm black, hmm, maybe?
Tell me why my hands start sweating and I hold my breathe every time you get behind me
I turn my music down so you won't hear a sound, man I'm nervous like I got a couple pounds on me
You pull me over, ya frown on me
With your flashlight, tell me, what do you see?

My middle finger to the law, bustin' off, tryin' to touch the sky
My teacher said, ""Impossible"", but I'mma fuckin' try
Plus how he gon' tell me, he don't make the rules
There's niggas dying everyday, we don't make the news
Instead they talk about some thunderstorm, cyclones
Timmy got his bike stole
Top story: Tiger Woods be fuckin' a these white hoes
Anchorman stop snitchin'
Cut to commercial, he be textin' all his side bitches
Hey ma-goodness, how ironic
I'm tryed for possession of some chronic
My lawyer came to court, man he was higher than the comet
Hey your Honor, is you kidding, how you sit above me?
Are you perfect mothafucka? How you finna to judge me?
When you home you don't cuss, drink and puff like us?

15 Minutes Away,K'naan,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Yeah, I am sendin' this one out to
Everyone who has had to wait on a money transfer
Yeah, it's kinda whack when they charge you like ten percent on the dollar
But you know how good it feels when they say

[Hook]
You can pick it up today
It's just fifteen minutes away

[Verse 1]
The worst thing is the waitin', man
It's spiritually drainin', I guess I could repaint
But don't think I'm complainin'
I'm in my small apartment
This month has been the hardest
I couldn't afford some omelettes
I'm broken like an empty promise
Sometimes when I'm in a meeting
And everyone else is eating
I feel so awkward askin', so I pretend like I am fastin'
My girl had paid my payments
She wants to save my anus
She says my love's contagious
But my pride is so outrageous
She sent me Western Union, so I can make it through'n
It felt so good when she said write down this eleven digits
I go out to receive it, I'm desperate and I need it
Feels like an angel speakin', I can hardly believe it
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You finally got a caller
You met him in Sao Paula
A tourist with a dollar
He's some kind of a balla
Two babies in a scroller
And still he wants to holla
He likes your Pepsi cola
But you ain't runnin' low-la
Brazilians make it easy
For bellas or fo sheezy
The sun would make him dizzy
Working for something mezlee
These girls will make you trust em
Because sweetness in the custom
But everyday they hustlin'
Every day they hustlin'
John calls her with the number
Home with her local lover
Who was it that picked up the phone?
Oh, that was just my brother
She goes out to receive it
She's desperate and she needs it
It's like an angel speaking
She can hardly believe it
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got my conformation
The Western Union agent said grandma's destination
Had violent inclination, but now I'm proudly pacin'
And walking to the station, heavy perspiration
But you can't tell me nothin'
I got my biz in order
I made it cross the border
Such dazzle, such a horror
His life is like an opera
Grandma I never forget you
Worry, I'll never let you
Soon as I leave the venue, this money I will send you
I still haven't gone astray, don't drink or smoke and sway
Though sometimes I don't pray
It feels so good to say, go out and receive it
Cause I just know you need it
Your boy has grow up decent, grandma can you believe it

Me as the best
Flow so loco homos wanna th-th-throw
Me in a vest
Think you fucking with me? No, no, I'll throw a
Knee to your chest
You can't keep up with this Jones, and you're intense?
I ain't even impressed
I stay rapping, spitting dope
Stay trapping
My flow in a, straight jacket
I make havoc
Y'all lame asses, stay flapping your m-o-u
T-h backwards, fucking monster, straight savage
CJ snapppin', anything that I want, I made happen
I stay racing, y'all stay draggin', you stay gassin'
I make classics, I run this shit, y'all play Madden
No sense like the preacher burning Qu'Rans
It ain't happen
So stop faking, to a man who isn't at all convinced
Too big, y'all little kids small for this
Too legit for the shit, what the problem is?
So bring you and your crew, cause you fools gonna lose
Have you singing beautiful blues, I go

(I Go Crazy) [repeat]

Fuck living life, all it does is get my stress up
Hating ass niggas, that's what we need less of
Fuck a record deal, nigga, F-O-S up
(Fuck a record deal, nigga, F-O-S up
I got problems, lock me in the closet
Went to the bank and made a deposit, then I robbed it
All these niggas trying too hard to become artists
When I drop bars going so hard, make it look flawless
Real talk, my presence, the shit should be illegal
I'll turn your whole family into Evil Knievel
It's not upstairs, something's wrong with my cerebral
Told niggas I was crazy, said I ""needed more people""
Locked a nigga up, cause they said I was a lethal
Weapon to the public of America, please dude
Chains, matches, straight jackets and guns
You call it crazy, I just say I'm having some fun, I go

[Verse 3: ZiLLY]
Now get your mind in the mood to feel the abnormal
Psychopathic interlude
My snippet of my feelings and how
I drop the bar
It's peak when you messin with me
Ha-ha ha, ha
We the greatest right here, no one better
Calm you voice, kid, it's a silent kill, fella
Ninja-like reflexes never spot the night fly
I go cranium, no -anium, add the z-y
They sick of me
What am I, I to ponder
Prove these motherfuckers wrong, until I'm half a dozen under
This royalty is at, its tippy-top best
You ain't us, so go back playin with your toys nephew
You, you, you, yeah, I'm ying-yanging the game
Twisted good and evil, son I'm up in your brain
Pracice the sin while I sin and get the message sent
Dig through the roots of me and you'll see I begin to go
(Crazy)

Excuse me, uh, doctor?
Yeah?
Uhh....we missing somebody
Who?
Well, we got CJ The Genesis
Yeah?
We got Sage
Yeah?

But uh...we missing a patient
WHO?
I mean, this is really bad...this is all over the news
Who?! Who is it?!
I mean, it's unexplainable, man!
Son, you gotta tell me!
I'm really scared for the patients, and everyone around here
Just tell me!
Ya gotta be careful man, cause, this guy goes crazy, man
Who, WHO? Just tell me!
Doctor, I really don't know what to do
Uh, uh, TELL ME!
Broken windows
WHO IS IT?
Just, racks, just broken
Tell me who it is!
Oh my goodness
[Verse 4: M-Trey]
What a portrait, It's merely a shadow
But I truly see the spare root of who defeated me in an instant
I see you don't listen
Curtail your words well
It's first come, first serve unless you silent
So you best to keep quiet
A migrant from a flier land
Give you feelings like light a fire to hydro-grams with
One sound from my diaphragm
My mother's sonogram revealed her son would be a legend
I knew the pressure accepted it so I need the record
And y'all ain't beating nothing
Skin is thin as pita bread and
3 be eminating the greatness, so much you see the essence
Thanking God I wasn't deprived of youth
That be why all they see is red for miles, but I say it's kinda blue
But, I see in a different hue in my world
Waiting for the day I meet me a suicide girl, then
Maybe we'll go together
Cold hand in hand with me
Damage speaks randomly, flailing
Companion to insanity

Woah, woah – what you got me charged with?
We're gonna have you charged with possession of cocaine with intention to distribute
Man, I ain't sold that, man! That, man, why is you doin' that, man?!

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
The rhymes I design are truly unrefined
Like diamonds with a speck of blood, dug up out the mine
Flows flood between the ears, right behind my eyes
Giving birth to the lines, soul search for the prize
I takes my time when deciding what to write
Like the SAT, while these other niggas bite
Underrated and mostly hated but got a lot of fight
Like a player, play the background, fuck the spotlight
Night, night, I recite when I step up to this mic
Reputation trunk tight, like the husband on a wife
Stay sharp as broken glass, get busted on the smash
When your ass cross paths with this half of the 'Kast

It's bed-time, tuck yourself at night
Can tell that you're terrified
Check my record, you will see that I'm verified

Don't nobody want none (Now you're terrified)
Nobody want none, nathan, this none (It's bedtime)

Yeah, this where the second verse supposed to go
I don't even think I need to hit y'all with another verse
But I, I think I just might
Because I like to destroy shit

There's no retreat and no surrender
Been ready for battle, General Patton's no beginner
I keep it all Madden, I call the play then execute for the W
Leave the rest to you, destitute, now put that money up
Oh, your conscience is nonsense
How you expect to get a little restitution with all this ghetto flyness?
Snow, that's for toboggans, no, won't be no pardons
Or bargains, three striked, then yanked up like a rod
Uh, with no apartments, and no home to run to
You're snitching on yourself, and now your front door, they come through
Without a tap on your phone
The only thing they had to do was listen to the raps in your songs

[Bridge: Joi & Big Boi]
Lights out, the time for nighty night's long overdue
This is the final countdown to your swan song, you are through
All wack MCs and posers, this is going out to you (To you)
The boys will drop their jaws in awe 'cause here comes something new
Here, here comes something new
Something new, something new, something new
[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Straight out the plastic, like a pack of puddings, no show
My nigga, you can not see me, and that's fo' show, fo' do'
Any kind of Cadillac, I go slow
When I'm smokin' on some of that choco, no low, no mid
Top of the line pine, 'cause I blow big
Been 'round here for a while
Your mama like my style, and so do your kids
I know you love it, because a hater loves to hate
Boy, you need me like a junkie need a razor blade and plate
I'm dope, nigga

UFOs, taking they fly clothes, they eyes closed
We getting loot, no doubt, check the word of mouth
Unheard about, guns go off and now a murder route
I'm out, my raps play the part like a Get Smart secret agent
In a maze and style's blazing
Johnny Blaze and Tony Starks in the Days Inn
And Rhyming, my nigga Lou Diamond with Robert F
We like Meth to go and fuck with Noodles

Amarettos and chewables, smacking pharmaceutical

The goal's untold, fuck it, it beats parole
So stroll marvelous, soul controller of the globe blow
Goddamn, I got it sewn and yo
What up wop? Pop the suitcase high and we can talk
You can walk out the fucking building and get caught
Save the fully inflatable, rap relatable
Drug relatable, niggas here to play with you
A hundred dollar Rottweiler, go to spot sellers
Guns and Glocks for them niggas who got props
Off top jail niggas get mad bigger and yo
Mail a guy about a hundred pictures
Word to mama, this rap wonder rhymer team got drama
Comma, blunt smoke real-ass marijuana
Chef Maranzano boats across the Verrazano
Immaculate, bust off my gun so accurate
And get cream in the cuisine of Queens

Who's the knucklehead wanting respect?
Chop his fingers in the drug game, money well-known
Lead singer, humdinger, flash is the aftermath, here's his photograph
Run up in his lab, take off the mask, Chas, and think fast
Don't laugh, bag the cash, grab the hash, don't forget his stash
Grab the tear gas and place it in his face fast
At full blast (*Speeding car passing*)
Then skate to the next gate further upstate
I heard they got crazy weight bagged up by the cakes in
Crates like disco breaks, yo look out for jakes
Give it all it takes, let's burn the place before we motivate
Yo, Blake, nigga, don't fake, rape his mate
If the bitch scream, for God's sake grab the grey tape
It's by the plate with the blow crushed up with the flakes
Killer snakes, four bodies found floating in lakes
Drug related paper talking about the kids who didn't make it
Hits without a trace, never seen the bricks, see Rae and Ghostface
Congratulations, Chef, let's celebrate and sniff an eighth (*Tires screeching*)

The rap scar is on, rap Parmesan, poke on, put it on, seal it on
We're silicone, spark it on your talkathon
This rap phenomenon to correspond took the arms
Hit me on the hip and horns, rap chaperone
Scars, tones, bar thrown, war tones, raw tones
Blowing out their jawbones, but your rap's fraudulent
Plug in these rap coordinates, it's reinforced with suspense
Be on your rap sword defense
These microphone professional, sensational, fully operational
I got niggas here to play with you, you know the steez
You know my whole program, brothers from the no-lands
All we want is the G's, guns and grams
Living fat like the Hoffa, mafia, sipping, eating pastas
Laying in the house telling the seeds about the sagas
Before we got dramatic and thoughts got sporadic
We grabbed golden tablets and quick guarded the Abbots
Slugs hit the Pelle, punch hopes into the belly
Suckers tried to knock me out the box like Skelly
I smoke the weed trees, I drop top to the breeze
Honey dip spending G's on nails and hair weave
The crime boss taking no loss, excessive force
We can play the A-Train back of the iron horse

Selling coke right out the bottle
Sometime a nigga bought nines to test with mines (Sit back, relax)
Crazy piece, buying keys in Greece
Was a rich nigga, picture the nigga without dough figures
Condo with his chick, rocking the gold vigor
Mafia flicks, tying up tricks was his main hobby
Teaching his seed Wu-Tang karate
Mixing drinks in clubs, hairy chest with many minks
Night time rolling with snakes
Extra live, he claimed he couldn't die, top rank
Sixteen shots in his fish tank
And his pet piranha, he named him Marijuana
Smoking ganja, calling his weed pipe Sandra
Claiming New York was ancient Babylon
Where the sky stayed the color of grey, like heron
I can't front though, truck loads of Indo
Soon to blow slow, his ass is out now, tally-ho

Then I react like a convict and start killin' shit
It's manifested, the gods work like appliances
Dealin' in my cypher I revolve around sciences
The 9th chamber, leave you trapped inside my hallway
You try to flee but you got smoked up by the doorway (Blaow)
No question, I send your ass back right to the essence
Your whole frame is smothered in dirt, now how you restin'?
While I'll be trapped by sounds, locked behind loops
Throwin' niggas off airplanes 'cause cash rules (Cash rules)
Everything around me, black, as you can see
Swallow this murder one verse like god degree
Then analyze my soundtrack for satisfaction
You adapt like a flashback, chain reaction
(Lace them niggas, son)
[Verse 2: Raekwon]
AK's black, bust back like seventy MACs
I'm all that, street niggas knowin' my steez, black
Ron G, you know he coincide with me, see
Marvelous menace for society
But anyway, let's toast, champagne thoughts with Ghost
I max the most shotguns through the nose
Fuck rap, hip-hop put me on top
'Lo wears and Tommy Hil' fly shit with a knot
The witty unpredictable live shit, drive-by shit
Do-or-die shit, I'll take your lye and shit
And then you know I'm runnin' through the penal
Foul, fall through, child was wild
The old lady snitched, but fuck it, you know what?
One love, kid, no, I'm not doin' a bid
Too much to get, for what, 'cause six niggas got stuck
And the nigga chain was truck?
Yo, fuck that, criminology rap, sneakers stay
Jet-black floatin' in the flyest Ac', nigga
(Bring it, yeah)

Much love go to New York City
All my Tommy Hil', ice-rockin' niggas"

He looks determined without being ruthless
Something heroic in his manner
There's a courage about him, doesn't look like a killer
Comes across so calm
Acts like he has a dream
Full of passion
You don't trust me, huh?
Well, you know why
I do, we're not supposed to trust anyone in our profession anyway

[Intro]
Knock niggas out the box all the time
Niggas know my motherfuckin' repertoire, big ones (Uh-huh)

(Yeah, bust it, yo, yo) Fly G.I. niggas

It's for real, though, let's connect, politic, ditto
We could trade places, get lifted in the staircases
Word up, peace, incarcerated scarfaces

Thug-related style attract millions, fans
They understand my plan, who's the kid up in the green Land?
Me and the RZA connect, blow a fuse, you lose
Half-ass crews get demolished and bruised
Fake be fronting, hourglass-heads niggas be wanting
Shutting down your slot, time for pumping
Poisonous sting, which thumps up and act chumps
Rae's a heavy generator, but yo, guess who's the black Trump?
Dough be flowing by the hours, Wu, we got the collars
Scholars, word life, peace to Power and my whole unit
Word up, quick to set it, don't wet it
Real niggas lick shots, peace Connecticut

Chef'll shine like marble, rhyme remarkable
Real niggas raise up, spend your money, argue
But this time is for the uninvited
Go 'head and rhyme to it, bitch nigga, mics is getting fired
More fiends, chicks be burning like chlorine
Niggas recognize from here to Baltimore to Fort Greene
But hold up, Moët be tasting like throw-up
My mob roll up, dripped to death, whips rolled up
You never had no wins, sliding in these dens
With Timbs, with MAC-10's and broke friends
You got guns? Got guns too, what up, son?
Do you wanna battle for cash and see who sons who?
I'll probably wax tracks, smack rap niggas, you, facts
Niggas' lyrics are wack, nigga
Can't stand unofficial, wet tissue, blank busting Scud missiles
You rolling like Trump, you get your meat lumped
For real, it's just slang rap democracy
Here's the policy, slide off the ring, plus the Wallabees
Check the status, soon to see me at, Caesar's Palace eating salads
We beating mics sending keys to Dallas
I move rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell
From where we at to my man's cell
From staircase to stage, minimum wage
But soon to get a article in Rap Page
But all I need is my house, my gat, my Ac'
Bank account fat, it's going down like that
And pardon the French, but let me speak Italian
Black stallions wildling on Shaolin
That means the island of Staten
And niggas carry gats and mad police from Manhattan

I do this for barber shop niggas in the Plaza
Catching asthma, Rae is sticking gun-flashers
Well-dressed, skating through the projects with big ones
Broke elevators, turn the lights out, stick one upstairs
Switch like a chameleon, hit Brazilians
Pass the cash or leave your children, leave the building
Niggas, yo, they be folding like envelopes
Under pressure, like Lou Ferrigno on coke
Yo, Africans denying niggas up in yellow cabs
Musty like fuck, waving they arms to Arabs
Sit back, cooling like Kahlúas on rocks
On the crack spots, rubber band wrap all my knots
View bitches who fuck dreads on Sudafeds
Pussy's hurting, they did it for a yard for the feds
Word up, cousin, nigga, I seen it
Like a 27-inch Zenith, believe it

Goodies,Ciara,[],"[Intro: Ciara]
My goodies, my goodies, my goodies
Not my goodies

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
I got a sick reputation for handling broads
All I need is me a few seconds or more
And it's a wrap
Tell valet to bring my 'Lac
And I ain't comin' back
So you can put a car right there (Put a car right there)
I'm the truth
And I ain't got nothin' to prove
And you can ask anybody
'Cause they seen me do it (They seen me do it)
Barricades, I run right through 'em
Used to 'em
Throw all the dirt you want, I'm used to it (It's no use)
You still won't have a pin-up in a fabulous room
On her back, picking out baskets of fruit
I love you, boo
Yeah, Freaky Petey love you too, ha-ha
You know how I do it (That goodie goodie)
[Pre-Chorus: Ciara]
You may look at me and think that I'm just a young girl
But I'm not just a young girl
Baby, this is what I'm looking for
Sexy, independent, gotta spend-it type that's gettin' his dough
I'm not being too dramatic
That's the way I gotta have it

[Chorus: Ciara]
I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mad 'cause I talk around it
If you're looking for the goodies
Keep on looking, 'cause they stay in the jar
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah

Just because you drive a Benz
I'm not goin' home with you
You won't get no nookie or the cookies
I'm no rookie
If you ain't sexy, independent I ain't wit' it
So you already know
I'm not bein' too dramatic
That's the way I gotta have it
You may talk slick
Tryna hit, but I'm not dumb
I'm not bein' too dramatic
It's just how I gotta have it

So damn hot, but so young
You ain't got milk on ya tongue
Slow down lil' one
And you ain't got it all
Hey shorty, you don't play the game (Wait a minute)
You think you bad, but you ain't bad
I'll show you what bad is
Bad is when you're capable of beatin' the baddest
I've been workin' at it ever since I came to this planet
I ain't quite there yet, but I'm gettin' better at it
Matter of fact
Lemme tell it to you one mo' 'gain
All I got to do is tell a girl who I am (Petey)
Ain't ne'er chick in here that I can't have
Bada boom, bada bam bam bam (I'm Bad)

You're insinuating that I'm hot
But these goodies boy, are not
Just for any of the many men that's tryna get on top
No, you can't call me later
And I don't want your number
I'm not changin' stories
Just respect the play I'm callin'!

Run this shit and it ain't nothing but a relay
And ain’t nothing you can tell us
About to roll up, kush sticky like Elmer’s
This ain’t no how I act like summa
Going head up with me, bring a motherfucking helmet
You niggas just special ed
All I see is green but my eyes so red
And all I do is win, got a room full of clouds
About to take another shot but I’m used to the fouls
I'm ballin', you could take two to the mouth
It's Alumni, throw it up, two to the south
Tell them deuces, just put two in the air
So sick, said it must be the flu in the air
If you do it big then I probably did it obese
Thought it was a dream but I never get no sleep
Up all night getting higher then the nose bleed
Swear I was raised by a beast like Mogli
Came from the bottom, rats and the roaches
Now a nigga's blunts sitting as fat as my roaches
Bout to go ham, you niggas just kosher
I’m a shark in the water, see the fin and it's over

They were sleeping on me
Time for me to wake them up
Counting all these fucking benjys

Shorty gon’ do whatever
Say she's a rap fan
Every nigga around me robbin', Batman
All black coupes
All black wheels
Step out the line, I'm a show you how that MAC feel
I’m like C. Bailey in the corner of that backfield
Wrong move will get your motherfucking cap pilled
Rolling in this murder engine
Purrin' through your neighborhood
Let my money do the talking
I ain't gotta say I'm good
Homies that'll gun you down
I ain’t gotta say I would
Riding like an engine bitch
I ain’t gotta say I’m hood
I tell a ho to follow me or swallow me
I be spending money
Like I fucking hit the lottery
If I ever hit your girl
Then this is my apology
Cause suckers that be tripping about these bitches
Tryna body me
[Verse 3: Los]
I’m about to go
Rope around my arm
Needle in it I could feel it now
Towel round my head
Taliban knock the building down
High cock blocker
I’m a fly top shotter
In my all red rims
Like a high top Prada
On my mommas mouth to the drama
And lies would be gripping from my lips
As I’m spitting that shit that Osama be gripping
Hungry as a poverty stricken
Robbery victim
With a roscoes waffles and chickens
Winning lottery ticket
And your girl let me pop it in real life
I beat it like they locked me in a room
With the doctor that killed Mike
I feel like, put me in a field let the field lights
Shine on the field now watch me kill all the field mice
I’m anthrax you tampax
I’m about to go Amtrax
Jack Black black Jack
Got the track saran wrap
Stand back I’m slamming an antagonist
Slapping you faggots putting the can in the bandwagoners
Swag of the century, mackin' a bitch or three
I hear it was nothing trying to crack it eventually
Rappers that mention me
Boy, I put this on my mother
You will end up in the scope
Im jus trynna warn a brother
Still getting cheescake on these dummies
Deal or no deal I got a briefcase full of money
Jahlil on the beat, Will hosting this shit
And its T-Lanez, Ink, Meek, and Los in this bitch

I get in the instrumental, I get to switching the mental
The bitch in rental just positions my dick in her dental
Y’all know my bitch is yellow bone, on yellow stone
Double scoop, chocolate woman and my vanilla cone
Yelling cause I’m very calm, yes I’m on the cherry bone
Things seem quicker than a ping hit ya berry phone
Ya don’t wanna talk about balling parallel Larry Holmes
Money never growing, like a fucking young Gary Coleman
Veteran, batter up, better in
It's the N to you rappers, like the letter after M
And I'm a Lamborghini nigga, nigga you can never see me
Im the shhh, Triple H, you gone have to pedigree me
Bitch I'm ready for the beef, like its some lettuce in between me
You got eeny meeny money, teeny like the youngest preemy
And even if you niggas is crippin, still can never “C” me
Or beat me with three wishes, and a motherfuckin' genie
Scared and they fare when I play a record on ya
Weird and you squared, I could play checkers on ya
Rappers, yall actors, and I rip this track till its “Tra”-”ck”
I rollerblade, let it ride, show my face, televise
Dot to ya top, like the lower case letter i
I fly higher that a sci-fi flyer
Fire like I'm 5 lighters, brighter than a highlighter
Oops, I'm in a loop for time
This a European whip check the coupe design
Time Is Money is the building and the truth inside

I-I think you might wanna s-s-s-sneak your ratchet in here for this one
Ay ladies
Put the petroleum jelly on your face
Ayo Nas, we got a big bet in the streets that you knock their ass out in the first 30 seconds of the first round
Get them!

[Verse One: Nas]
Sitting up drunk, shuffling thoughts
Got paper but I'm lost
Losing focus, what a nigga still hustling for?
My seed is straight, the family's settled
Idle time get the man in trouble
When wifey tourin', my life get borin'
Start to remember all types of torment
The devil's callin', but I don't answer
Mom passed from cancer, leaving behind
Two granddaughters, two grandsons, two nines
Next to me in the Phantom, who lying?
Big screen documentaries of Idi Amin
Dada, trying to stay away from creeps
With their bullshit, trying to put me back in the streets
War stories, funerals
Where Feds be laying, from a dreadful slaying
Body viewings, at the wake
Nigga sit stiff in his Ferrari, no casket
With his eyelids still open, it's kinda spooky
Iceman watch on, the suit Gucci
I'm above the standard
But dudes is more zealous than Branford
Thinking you're too rich, they want to gun ya
Kidnap ya, cause of they hunger, but you fucking with hunters
Camouflaged in black hoods that dump clips
Cause real niggas die over dumb shit
Camouflaged in black hoods that dump clips
Cause real niggas die over dumb shit

To your, power structure, Nas is dangerous
Y'all the antithesis, the opposite
Twitching shit, all up in your body language
Mean mugging your bitch, because she leans over
To look closer, told you: ""Y'all sloppy gangsters"", saying:
""Nas is this, and Nas is that""
Your eyes go front, your eyes go back
Surprised I'm at the same place y'all be at
It's obvious you don't know how I react
Like, I don't know where the party's at
You're foaming at the mouth, losing breath
Like a cardiac arrest, but I ain't impressed
Because the fact is, y'all don't really want it
Two to the head, four to the stomach
Call more security because, I come off
Anywhere you at, you scary cats
If you dare squeeze back, guns shall rain
A thousand times harder, than when I first came
Y'all not relentless, y'all dumb
And y'all just forgot about the consequences
Not a jail sentence, but see
The nigga you feed'll kick it to dude, that kick it to me
We posess, the recipes for death, because jealousy destroys
Feed the dog first, watch out for Salmonella poisoning
I know a kid who'll throw shit in your food
And say: ""That's the way you kill a man
Avoid the shooting"", hey {*echo* x4}

You smile, in my face
Secretly I know, you want my place
You waiting on me to choke, don't want a nigga to breathe
Want to come cut my throat, you want to get rid of me
But before I let it happen, them guns going to start clapping
And y'all going to rest in peace, because death is the recipe
Before I let it happen them guns going to start clappin
And y'all going to rest in peace, because death is the recipe

Yeah, is this what you really want, you got me in the flesh now
No, I'm not stressed out, I'm God, I'm the best out

It's incoherent, and no I'm not staring
I just see through you
And from your heartbeat you are soft in the middle
I'm real on the outside, solid in the inside, bitch, it's the Westside
Chopper in the trunk, leave em soaked like a wet slide
It's apartheid, rap game is my shit

Somebody tell the Earth I'm the best now
Somebody tell the ocean I'm the best out
Somebody tell the trees I'm here now
Somebody tell the world I'm Based now

I got something that I really want to say
It's been on my mind and it goes this way
Concerns about society
And while I have a chance imma say it (hey!)
We got
Teachers teachin' crap to the kids
Equivalent to selling crack to the kids
That's why the world's so addicted to fear, monkey business

You see my inside
Said something ain't right
I've got a mouth fright
I say it outright
I'll make a statement
State my opinion (Love it)
Maybe my action
Gives inspiration

Make them hear you
Make them hear you

We know something's going on
You know something we should know

There's some things that I really wanna know
Check it out now, cuz this is how it go
Look we can go and buy tobacco
But apparently, weed's illegal

Gas and plastic all for oil
We went to war for oil

Bring your wheelchair, you probably gon' need it
Leave this motherfucker, a paraplegic
Niggas 'round the world that think they wanna bang
Don't get your ass caught up like Lil Wayne
I'm too West Coast for the West Coast
To Fresno to Sarito's, to soul food and burritos

Go downtown, and give a bum a C-note

Enemies of this industry, I'mma
Hall of Famer, treated like a stranger
Fuck that, another West Coast banger
Who gives a fuck if they play it in Virginia?
I'mma play it on Denker, play it on Western

Splatter (x4)

[Verse 1]
You jacking me? You got the wrong season
You got your piece, I got my piece
And all I need now is a reason, for me to start squeezing
Matter of fact, give me your rings, watch, and your house keys
And make it fast shorty, or I'mma put gun smoke, up in the breeze
And I'm glad he ain't call my bluff, because I ain't really had my gat
It wouldn't have been nothing, for him, to peel back
My wig, he saw this piggy go, wee-wee all the way home
To get my chrome, because now I got to lock some shots off in that dome
(Why's that?) Because my manhood has got to stay intact
He can't just play me out, in front of the ladies, that shit is wack
But now I got my gat, back down in the downtown district
Dying to spill some gravy on this mother{*cough*} biscuit
Seen him kicking it out on Nicklet, like it was nothin'
Go around the block one more time, and I swear to God I'm dumpin'
Looked over my shoulder, know this was the time and the place
I jumped out the car, unloaded the nine up in his face!
With no feelin', peelin' out, tires all squeelin'
Adrenalin to my brain, got me higher than the ceilin'
But people talk, I'll probably never get dissed again
And Minnesota got ten thousand lakes, to dump the pistol in

I ran home quick, changed my clothes and dipped in my lady's Trans-Am
If they ask you where I am don't tell em shit
You ain't seen me or heard from me; she asked where I would go
I said: ""You know I'mma go stay with grandma down in Chicago
I know how fast your car go, way up over a hundred
But I can't get caught speeding, I might be federally wanted""
Man them cops be on it, I can't afford to get sloppy
Cause if I slip up at any single point, yo they got me
So I rock the accelerator never greater than limit
Thinking strictly about my journey, what I did, still hasn't hit me
I touch down in the Chi, grandma stay on Southside
Just trying to get some rest after that eight hour drive
And Grandma surprised, but always happy to see me
So I'm kicked up at the rest, playing Nintendo, watching T.V
And believe me, I know that I'm still on the run
But I'm happy that this part of the ghetto way is done

Yo, it's kind of hard to live with what I did
Because everytime I close my eyes, all I see is me blasting that kid
But yo, I did exactly what I had to do
If that was him in my shoes; he would've blasted me too
Besides, everybody's mamma cry sometime
And you know everyone got to die sometime
And grandma said I had a cousin in Minnesota, that I ain't even know about, you know
And just last week, he got his brains blown out
And so his little funeral was being held today
I'm dressed in black Versacci, and mad respect I pay
But whoever shot my cousin, sure wet up that po' bastard
Because the wake and the funeral was strictly closed casket
But yo, they had his picture on the program, and oh damn

Don’t match me with no rapper unless it’s who I V.S
Ask if I am cold and please do not B.S
Even if you know the answer’s gonna be yes
I am what you get when you mix Reptar with a T-Rex
A true fucking hybrid and I don’t mean no Prius
Hop out that Lexus GX to my girl crib out in TX
I’m creative in that sweep like Photoshop CS
I feel like wilding out on the DJ like D-Wrek
Act like I don’t be making these hits like it’s a reflex
They can look at you, just remember that V’s next
The Fly Boy Club is like the ‘09 DX, P.S, somebody re-tweet Flex
And tell him that the kid with the green backpack
And JFK is the dopest rapper he met
From Wichita, Kansas where haters creep at
And Vibe’s top 50 blogs is where I get my feet stacked
2dopeboyz is my fridge and nah right is my freezer
Her fetch is my dessert, I’m just trying to tease her
Your girl come to my show, you better leave her
They’ll be talking about her on the web worse than Amanda Diva
In the game, a chamber trouble maker like I’m Weezer
Out for R-E-S-P-E-C-T in Franklin’s like Aretha
I’m grinding till ‘09 end and I’m not taking a breather
Got a concept in the beat, I will lace you with that feature
And niggas think success is getting deals, well oh well
Throw them deuces and have fun up on your shelf
Then I bail, Quasimodo over that lease, I’m ringing bells
I won’t fail to stay off that milk carton and XXL
Niggas’ egos haunt my mixtape but I try not to blame ‘em
And everybody’s nobody so I’ll try not to name ‘em
The picture’s in my head and now it’s time to paint ‘em
You named your top ten freshmen, now I’m about change ’em

Looked on the floor to try and find my clothes
Lying next to someone, can’t recall their name
Leave your number on the table, take the walk of shame

Rolled over and opened my eyes and realized, suddenly, I’m not at home
She said good morning, I said what up and thought it’s time to go
Across her floor, my clothes and phone
I pick myself on up, she put her head in her hands
Brush away her bangs and ask me what’s the rush?
Well it ain’t personal, you seem like a good person though
To get your name, I’d have to go through your purse
And yo, I’d be the first to know I’m not that reliable
One good time and we try for two
I could go on and on, I need some R&R, just give a call tomorrow

The living room seemed way too familiar
Homegirl look with a stare that’ll kill ya
Hey, followed by an awkward moment, felt like time had frozen
Open up the door but it’s the wrong one
Gotta take a walk back and it’s a long one
Uncomfortable can’t begin to describe
The whole damn scene, you could feel the vibe
All eyes staring as I try and find a way out
Wanna get back home, order some takeout
Is this how you make out? Just to make out
Maybe a little more but I took the safe route
‘Cause too much too soon never pays out
I'mma live by that but not today pal

A Bay Bay let it play that's my song turn it up
I'm in the club hot, crunk, sweating, burning up
I'm bouncin' thru the crowd
Bucking, and hollering wassup
When I done fell out on the dance floor, and now I can't get up
J's on ya feet but you can't get these
Louis Vuitton brown, white, and yellow trick please
I go to Saint Louis and let my chain hang low
Canary yellow diamonds mixed with rose gold
I shine real bright in the light cause I'm a star
8 shots of patron now I'm standing on the bar
Tried to get drunk as a skunk and put the keys in the wrong car
Prolly got drunk as a skunk and put the keys in the wrong car

[Chorus]
You wanna know what we say in the club (A Bay Bay)
White folks, gangstas, and the thugs (A Bay Bay)
Stuntin' with a stacks of them dubs (A Bay Bay)
Ridin' in the 'lac with a mug (A Bay Bay)
[Outro]
A Bay Bay let it play that's my song turn it up
A Bay Bay let it play that's my song turn it up
A Bay Bay let it play that's my song turn it up
A Bay Bay let it play that's my song turn it up
A Bay Bay let it play that's my song turn it up
A Bay Bay let it play that's my song turn it up
A Bay Bay let it play that's my song turn it up
A Bay Bay let it play that's my song turn it up
A Bay Bay let it play that's my song turn it up

Some M-er F-ers don't like how Sally walk
I'll tell y'all fools it's hella cool how ladies from Cali talk
Never let her interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang
Nickname for nibble and tibble nibble metal fang
Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang
Known amongst foes for flow without no talking orangutans
Only gin and Tang, guzzled out a rusty tin can
Me and this mic like yin and yang
Clang! Crime don't pay, listen youth
It's like me holdin' up the line at the kissing booth
I took her back to the truck she was uncouth
Spittin' all out the sun roof through her missing tooth
She has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce
I turned it up faster than a speeding knife
Strong enough to please a wife
Able to drop todays math in the 48 keys of life
Cut the crap far as rap
Touch the mic and get the same thing a Arab will do to you for stealin'
What the devil? He on another level
It's a word! No, a name! MF, the Supervillain!
He cleans his mask with gasoline, they after him
Last seen pulling a chick like a fiend pull a fast one
Can't put shit past him
Got niggas on his own team mad enough to blast him
Retarted in real life, on the mic Rain Man
Stand close to his main man like a a chain gang
Who give a fuck about who or they weak crew
That's no mystery like Hardy Boys would do with Nancy Drew
Sorta wear her drawers down quarter
The extorter bring slaughter like ""Well I oughta""
Suggest you hand over the formula doula
A villan in your land, in his land a ruler
Hard hitting like puffing a woola with Lieutenant Uhura
Every day feel like it's a off day for Ferris Bueller
Niggas pull heat to prove they not sweet
No matter how you spell it, you still got beats to catch the

Ay, this is life man, niggas out here talkin
Rappin about shit you ain't never seen or had no parts in, youknowhatI'msayin?
Shit ain't cool man, ay Lo, take 'em where you from

[Hook: OneBeLo]
Let me take you to a place where the sun don't shine
Killers don't talk, little kids don't mind
Men don't work, don't take care of babies
You bought my album but bootleggers don't pay me
City runnin wild, cats don't give a fuck
Junior High students don't say no to drugs
Liquor stores don't ask shorties for their ID
This is a place where don't nothin surprise me
The ghetto

[OneBeLo]
The ghetto, yo
Now you can get shot, everyday it's a struggle to be alive
Mentally, physically, only the strong survive
Can't hide from the fact ghettos is filled with blacks (blacks)
Crack (crack) smack (smack) roaches and rats
Thugs totin they gats, this ain't a nice place to visit
The people that you live with, hearts cold and frigid
That girl over there, don't even bother with her (why?)
She's a hoodrat, gold-digger, never had a father figure
Her older brother was a big time drug dealer
When he was young his role model was a drug dealer
Now that he's older, everybody wants to cop a boulder
He took a bullet in his head, now he's in a coma (bloaw!)
You callin 9-1-1, this ain't a joke
You rollin like a blunt cause you might get smoked
The sad part about it ain't the money or the dope
The trigger man wasn't even old enough to vote
[Hook]
[Interlude: Zo-Zer]
Shit ain't all good in the hood
Touch mine, wish a nigga would
You knowhatI'msayin? (In the ghetto)

[OneBeLo]
Landlords don't do nothin but collect rent
Police don't patrol, serve or protect it
Brothers don't allow others to hustle on they block
Always carry heat cause the beef don't stop
And it don't quit, everyday the same shit
Hustlin to get you what your job can't get
And I ain't even talkin 'bout a Benz or Mercedes (what you talkin about?)
I'm talkin about toothpaste, diapers for your babies
The basic necessities of life
The homeless sleepin in a cardboard box every night
The only playgrounds is vacant lots and burned buildings
You gotta feel sorry for the children
How they gon' do they homework when they homes don't work?
They can't read books cause the lights don't work (nope)
They can't take a bath cause the water don't work (nope)
The stove in the kitchen, plus the heat don't work (nope)
It's cold at night, they mommas can't afford jackets
She too busy tryin to support the crack habit
The State took her kids, now they all doin bids (man that sound crazy)
I know it sound crazy but that's how it is, in the ghetto
The ghetto
[Interlude: Zo-Zer]
All I see are hearts that's hollow, from Detroit to Chicago
Just hopin you can follow
Shit's real, I know it sounds crazy
Shit, it's how it is, how it is

Yeah
I see it clearly, the money that is
Oh, ya’ll niggas ain’t in the way
Keep doing what you doing
See right through you, yeah

[Verse 1]
Got me drinking out the bottle
Living for today, ain’t thinking about tomorrow
Niggas fake, I can see it with my eyes closed
In desperate need of a leader so they follow
And me, I only see Chavo
I roll a bleezy and hit it like a high note
My skin tough as a rhino’s
So keep hating, I keep dating these dime hoes
Diamonds on my neck
Got diamonds on my chain, yeah
City or your state
Catch me mobbing with my gang and
Nigga violated, they won’t hesitate to aim
And I got enough change
To afford the price of fame
I’m like poison to ya’ll lames
Or drugs with prescriptions
Turn my music on, get a buzz when you listenin’
You want ‘em then pay for ‘em
And niggas talk fly, but I’m space gone
Up out of here

I never sleep, but I got big dreams
A little nigga, I do big things
You know it’s everything that it seems
They say my life is like the big screen

My money straight and my bitch mean
You should wait and get a ticket please
They say my life’s like the big screen

I feel like a desperado
On the track I just kick it like Rallo
See me on the TV
Yeah, I be in grind mode
But please believe
I’m in the streets like potholes
Antonio, no guitar though
Only instrumental is that pistol
Need a right hand so I fucks with Chevy
And underneath the wing so I hustle heavy
Tatted on my face, chest, neck, hands, stomach
Been on a paper chase since that cake start runnin’
Never touched a brick, I ain’t never slung a drug
Still get a feeling when I see that gold car comin’
Got my pops old soul, I’m a 80’s baby
Moms smoke hella weed, I’m a wavy baby
You mister me too and you need fuel, man
You niggas see through, air

I'm a blood suckin', drug puffin', thug frontin' love muffin
Why ma'am that's quite nice, yeah sure I'd love muffins
Warm from the oven covered honey oat and butter nut
Bake about 100 because I'm coming with my buddies (what up)
We don't mean to butt in but there's nothing better coming up
Pack it in forget it, yeah strap on in, buckle up
Nothing but the truth, I'm telling you the truth
Hip-hop is still alive, and I am living proof
And in order to improve we must kill it at the root
Shooting for the knees not until you see the pupils
Youthful of useful youthful exuberance
Music refutes that: abuses the rules
And of freedom of speech, well free to just speak
Let's see that as free time build 'em and teach
Yeah read it and weep cause reading increases
Your knowledge and ideas dealing in the street
While college is fine and the library's vital
God is the bomb and LeVar is my idol
Crime story, mind story, autobiography
Short story, long story, novel, or comedy
Non-fiction rhyme spittin' nonsense now not an option
Squashed it (squashed) stop it (stop)
The knot has been knotted and they noddin' they noggins
And now real start of the truth
So move with the movement, movement of humans
Using the tools we were born with
Or you can forfeit your fortune to the less fortunate
Unfotunatley the poor kids are
Forced to form they thoughts on things formally taught to them
It seems to be the least important part to think and dream
Believing things could never get - any better then this
So rejecting intellect neglecting interest
The internet becomes a nest of sex
Best describe as extra time to emphasize what mom and papa tried to hide
Eject the desktop, inject the Xbox
And let's not stop there - watch this head shot
And watch they head pop, open and then drop to the floor
Keep going cause nobody said ""stop""
Our only hope is the music they listening to
Influencing they intution ability to
Recognize between right and wrong
It's either hit or miss no intermission and intermission is on
A light goes on - an idea to volunteer my time, my mind, my rhyme defines the finer things in life
Decide to write a positive vibe acknowledging the might of the rhyme

Children of the World,Big K.R.I.T.,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Just in case you was wondering
I did make the beat

[Verse 1]
Yeah, cause we just (children of the world)
And they wonder why we bang
Cause police do the same, that's the only rival gang
I'm just sitting here, praying to my father
Tired of today, forever scared of tomorrow
Where's a scale I could borrow?
Cause living ain't cheap
I dropped out of school, pops, cause college ain't free
Plus college ain't me
Sitting in the class
Questions rushing in my brain but I'm too proud to ask
Take it all in stride, teacher talking physics
And I just want to be fly
What good is a degree when there's no jobs to apply?
And fast food won't do cause you overqualified
I'm feeling like hustling
Tired of the foodstamps and budgeting
Running in so much work, we school-bus it in
God and our wrist the only things we be trusting in
All else fails, I'm in a casket like fuck it then
Either get rich or die poor
Nigga fell short and got jammed, but he tried though
I'm pretty sure my first words were ""survival""
Looking for the answers to my problems in the Bible
Cause we just (children of the world)
Try and decode all the secrets
My conversations with God always seem leave him speechless
And even when I was at my worst like ""we got to make this work""
My girl found time to leave me
Too broke to give a fuck, though
My past relationships got me like ""What up, ho?""
I'm just bitter, I ain't asking what you fuck for
Thats disrespectful, I admit
I was just saying, if you wonder why I call you ""bitch""
Cause we just (children of the world)
Guess I look up to the pimps
I ain't saying it wasn't wrong, but they had the freshest fits
The cars and the broads and the kicks
Is something to strive for when you ain't never had shit
I'm feeling like what the fuck
They want my soul like my ancestors' ain't enough
If I can't trust my own government, who can I trust?
If I abuse myself daily, who can I love?
Shorty might have AIDS like who can I fuck?
Sure enough that'll be the day that the rubber bust or I have a kid
Deprived of all the things that my father did
Cause the momma was a groupie and I was on some rapper shit
They gave me Hell like I asked for it
Signing everything under the sun but they ain't after K.R.I.T
I guess I didn't swag enough
Stupid fruity pebble chain, Louis bag enough
Popping tags, model bitches, couldn't brag enough
Bubba Kushy stupid loud pack, jet lag enough
Steady acting like I ain't had enough
Ten chains on your neck like you ain't flash enough
I wreck so many times, I guess I ain't crash enough
On the track like a pusher of crack, bag it up
I tell these niggas to back it up
My bitch like scarves, gave the Louis rag to her
'Sace shades on my eyes like I ain't seeing the hate
Too fresh to death, I couldn't attend the wake
That's too lyrical, he been round busting
Mississippi where? He don't sound Southern
He be down cousin it's since '05, I swear
The game's a pound of Reggie
So anything I sell's a breath of fresh air
Yeah, fuck with me"

What's a man to do in this jungle?
Live life on the humble, in the jungle
When hamsters come and try to snatch a crumb from you
What a man 'pose to do, in this jungle?

Would you allow the slouth to come amongst you
Would you break bread, or instead

Disaster ain't the end of the road
Your last breath, take it with love

[Chorus]
Ellen Degeneres (swag!)
Ellen Degeneres (woo!)

[Verse 1]
I feel like Ellen
Right hand Ellen
Big blank rang
But I feel like Usher Raymond
Put me on the couches
Interview my girlfriend
Swag, swag, swag, swag
Brang-dang-dang your girlfriend
Girlfriend look like Ellen
Chain like Degeneres
""Damn Lil B, you done came up!
Now you touring heavy and your show costs 30 Gs
Damn BasedGod, you doing everything""
And I still swag harder
Iced-out ring real big like a charger
Yeah, he tight, but I'm swagging harder
See me on the Internet, 10 million Youtube
950 MySpace, 10 million MySpace
Young BasedGod met a girl off of MySpace
Now I'm on TV like Ellen Degeneres
""30 thousand for his show: oh he's so generous!""
[Chorus]
Ellen Degeneres (swag!)
Ellen Degeneres (woo!)

[Verse 2]
See me on set at 10 o'clock
Practicing my lines, swag to the tenth
Backstage pass, VIP pass
Iced out ring, Iced out chain
Ellen Degeneres, you're so generous
Everybody shows up, everybody loves you
30 thousand Showtime, 20 thousand maybe
Ellen Degeneres: mamis go crazy
Name's Lil B but the girls call me Swayze
See me at the show, hair cut like a baby
Ask a hundred girls if they know what my name is
Lil B BasedGod, Ellen's so famous

Terrorist,Lowkey,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
So, we must ask ourselves, what is the dictionary definition of terrorism? The systematic use of terror especially as a means of coercion, but what is terror? According to the dictionary I hold in my hand, terror is violent or destructive acts, such as bombing committed by groups in order to intimidate a population, or government into granting their demands. So what's a terrorist?

[Hook]
They're calling me a terrorist
Like they don't know who the terror is
When they put it on me, I tell them this
I'm all about peace and love
They calling me a terrorist
Like they don't know who the terror is
Insulting my intelligence
Oh how these people judge

[Verse 1]
It seems like the Rag-heads and Pakis are worrying your dad
But your dad's favourite food is curry and kebab
It's funny, but it's sad
How they make your mummy hurry with her bags
Rather read the Sun than study all the facts
Tell me, what's the bigger threat to human society
BAE Systems or home-made IED's?
Remote-controlled drones killing off human lives
Or man with home-made bomb committing suicide?
I know you were terrified when you saw the towers fall
It's all terror, but some forms are more powerful
It seems nuts, how could there be such agony?
When more Israelis die from peanut allergies
It's like the definition didn't ever exist
I guess it's all just dependent who your nemesis is
Irrelevant how eloquent the rhetoric peddler is
They're telling fibs, now tell us who the real terrorist is
[Hook]
They're calling me a terrorist
Like they don't know who the terror is
When they put it on me, I tell them this
I'm all about peace and love
They calling me a terrorist
Like they don't know who the terror is
Insulting my intelligence
Oh how these people judge

[Verse 2]
Lumumba was democracy, Mosadegh was democracy
Allende was democracy; hypocrisy, it bothers me
Call you terrorists if you don't wanna be a colony
Refuse to bow down to a policy of robberies
Is terrorism my lyrics?
When more Vietnam vets kill themselves
After the war than die in it
This is very basic; one nation in the world
Has over a thousand military bases
They say it's religion, when clearly it isn't
It's not just Muslims that oppose your imperialism
Is Hugo Chavez a Muslim? Nah… I didn't think so
Is Castro a Muslim? Nah… I didn't think so
It's like the definition didn't ever exist
I guess it's all just dependent who your nemesis is
Irrelevant how eloquent the rhetoric peddler is
They're telling fibs, now tell us who the terrorist is
[Hook]
They're calling me a terrorist
Like they don't know who the terror is
When they put it on me, I tell them this
I'm all about peace and love
They calling me a terrorist
Like they don't know who the terror is
Insulting my intelligence
Oh how these people judge

You think that I don’t know

[Outro]
Was Building 7 terrorism?
Was nano-thermite terrorism?
Diego Garcia was terrorism
I am conscious the Contras was terrorism
Phosphorous that burns hands – that is terrorism
Irgun and Stern Gang, that was terrorism
What they did in Hiroshima was terrorism
What they did in Fallujah was terrorism
Mandela ANC – they called terrorism
Gerry Adams IRA – they called terrorism
Erik Prince Blackwater – it was terrorism
Oklahoma, McVeigh – that was terrorism
Everyday USA – that is terrorism
Everyday UK – that is terrorism, every day
Every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day

A-ha, uh, yeah, yo

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
I'm the nigga with the perpetual oyster bars
Mother of pearl delivery, voice of God
And it's hard just being the boss
Being I can't go to jail 'cause them years'll cost me
Don't get me wrong, lay a nigga down if he force me
I'd rather just sit back and roll a Dutch
Think about how I'ma put the game in the cobra clutch
Think about how I'ma get the 'caine over customs
Never underestimate niggas or over-trust them, uh
Yeah, them Ms is right in my face
I just gotta throw my Timbs on and tighten my lace
If it don't jam, the TEC will spray
When I spit, everybody gotta split like pepper spray
'Cause I'm a nigga that hate to settle
And I'm a man of the Lord, but I still can't shake the devil
Moved away and still can't escape the ghetto, what?
[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
The time to talk is up, so bring the heat, playtime is over
While you're runnin' your mouth, I'm creepin' up over your shoulder
A gun, a knife, a bat, a brick, anything I can get my hands on
Call my bluff, start acting up and I'll leave you underground

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
I know how to get my peers off me
Make 'em cry and die from high blood pressure 'cause tears are salty
It's a symptom if you bobbing your head, you know that he's sick
You know the flow is ridic', now throw him a grip
When I get it, you already know I'm throwing them bricks
Putting purple everywhere, daddy, I'm throwing them nicks
That's right, homie, you can't move me
I ain't going nowhere, I'm in the hood like bootleg movies
All you shooting is the breeze, a bootleg Uzi
I'm just waiting on a Q like Suzie, don't lose me
These penitentiary chances that I take
Should be able to get the mansion by the lake
But I invest my bread into something else
Into something else that'll make something melt
You just got to feel the kid
If not rap, for the fact of how real he is, what up?

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Niggas know the champ is in here
He took it from crack to rap, now he put out two anthems a year
And I just want to rock for a century
And then chase the book with the documentary
If you can't do nothing other than flow
Life's a bitch like the mother from Blow, let's go
Don't make me put your heart in your lap
Fuck riding the beat, nigga, I parallel park on the track
Hop out looking crispy, fresh and new
In the six, but it's a BM and it's Pepsi blue
And, I don't know you
But I know a man becomes a man from all the shit that he go through
Y'all ain't fuckin' with Jason
After I cash in, there's really no justification
Of how I'm gon' change the game, so don't get out of line
'Cause this little nine will change your frame, what up?

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
The time to talk is up, so bring the heat, playtime is over

[Narration: Common]
Long before we know ourselves, our paths are already set in stone
Some may never figure out their purpose in life and some will
There are a lot of us who are caught up in this hell we all live in
Content with being blinded by rules and judgment
We live in a world where it's more okay to follow than to lead
In this world being a leader is trouble for the system we are all accustomed to
Being a leader in this day and age is being a threat
Not many people stood up against the system we all call life
But toward the end of our first ten years into the millennium we heard a voice
A voice who was speaking to us from the underground for some time
A voice who spoke of vulnerabilities and other human emotions and issues never before heard so vividly and honest
This is the story of a young man who not only believed in himself but his dreams too
This is the story of the Man on the Moon"

Oh I don't think I'll ever go
You see the walls are so high that I, couldn't climb them
So I don't know which way to roll
I feel I'm stuck in rewind, though I'm, lookin forward
Damn, I wish I knew what went wrong
Am I sick, am I ill? Man, my mental got me

Things do get out of hand once awhile, inside my mental
Hey, I took one hell of a ride

Yeah I like to pat my own back
It's a gift and a curse, since my birth I'm in a prison
Though I'm happy right where I'm at

Nah
Yeah le-leave the hissin in there, d-don't take the hissin out
We gonna keep this one all the way gangsta
I mean, you motherfuckers don't realize
How real this shit is man
I mean, people always gonna try and get over on you
But protect what's yours, protect your family
Protect what's right (You hear me)

This story starts off
Little boy black in the ghetto
No matter what he does it's back to the ghetto (ghetto)
No choice but to adapt to the ghetto, so he adapts to the ghetto
Yes, the crack and the metal
He takes no days off for gettin his cocaine off (off)
He ran back and fourth so much it pissed Jose off (Psssss)
Now Jose was the cocaine boss (boss)
Straight from Columbia, his cocaine soft (soft)
But Jose was out fuckin his sister
Hittin shorty off cuz he had love for his sister (Take that, Take that)
And shorty had no love for his sister
Cuz his sister would sniff up everything Jose gives her
But shorty had a plan for 'em both
Plus he was good at handlin coke, so Jose liked him
Problem was, he was pitchin for the dudes down the street (Who?)
You know, TJ, Big Boo and Malik (Word)
Malik is a killer, Boo is a killer (Yep)
TJ, well he's just another nigga
But, despite the fact (what), they didn't like the fact
That he was close to Jose and he might just rat
And being that, he was a pitcher here in the winter air (What happened)
They set it up to get him there and hit him there (Damn)
But shorty was smart
So before they got to, load and spark
He said, hold up, my heart (Hold up hold up) Please
Then he said, please, look up in my bag (Look)
There's cook up in my bag, it's all good up in my bag (Here)
And there's more where that came from
I get it from Jose, believe me, there's more where that came from
Yeah, he had 'em lost and the game won (won)
They let him go, yeah, thinkin he would let 'em know (What)
Where Jose was keepin that heavy coke
But instead he told Jose bout that (Bout that)
And we all know Jose bout that (Bout that)
Next thing you know he seen Jose slouch back (What)
In the chair, like ""There's no way out that"" (Nope)
He said ""Shoot em, I'mma blow they house back"" (Back)
Next day he sent the two way out town (And..)
And somebody blew they house down (Damn)
Jose think shorty on his side
But he don't know shorty on his side (Word?)
So shorty called Jose, like ""Listen (Listen)
It's going down I need more cocaine"" (Bring it)
So we met up (Met up), it was a set up
Guess who, TJ, Malik, and Boo sped up (Wow)
You should've seen the look on Jose's face
You never seen the look on old man's face (Nope)
Told him no man's great
And it's no man's place, to fuck wit no man's fam
Then he said ""Where's my sister 'fore I kill you""
The End
The story's over man (It's over man)
They all kinda end like that sometime too (Ya dig)
Ya see, I told the story cuz man, I kinda feel like
Every hood, everybody
Everybody got a Lil Boy Fresh around them somewhere
Whether it's right next door, across the hall
Up the block, down the block, around the corner
Huh, I mean ya see
Ya see we all see the same shit, Just through
Different eyes
You surprised? Don't be man
It's just real shit
Holla at cha'boy

Gone,Juelz Santana,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
God will never put you in a situation that you can't handle
But you can definitely put yourself in a situation you can't handle
And some situations lead to death
Death is a mothafucker...ya dig?

[Verse 1]
Old timer want the block back, stop that
""You been gone too long"", the young nigga said
Lord knows, whats going through this young nigga's head
As the old timer stood and grilled him
Peeled off, shorty looked at his man
Touched his burner like ""I should've killed him""
Shorty in deep, but he don't care
But he don't know, these old timers don't play fair(Nah)
There he go, postin' on his strip again
Toast on him, niggas with him, posted on his shit again
(Uh-Oh) He acting like it can't and it won't happen
Old Timer 'bout to blow dust off that old cabinet
(Dust,Dust,Dust...) Where them guns is kept
These young niggas better show some respect (respect)
""I'll teach 'em a lesson"", he said to his self
As he proceeded to pull the lead from his shelf
Now he headed towards Shorty block, forty cocked
On his zip, on his shit, like he don't care who Shorty wit
But somebody saw him, before he got to Shorty
Shorty phone ring, somebody called him
Somebody warned him, ""He's coming, he's coming!""
Shorty replied, ""Somebody stall him!""
Then he crept up wit his goons and guns
Whispered in the Old Timer's ear, death's soon to come
[Hook]
They say hell is hot
Well, is heaven cold?
Know one ever knows til you Gone, gone, gone
And when you gone does your soul drift off to a better place
Or do you just forever fade
Away,away,away,away...like a bird when it's headed towards the sky, huh?
Or do you just die, huh?
Or do you just perish from the earth and if so, why?

[Verse 2]
Baddest bitch up on the block
Probably make a nigga cum as soon as she get up on the cock
She fuck with Tony don't she? (don't she)
Oh he's, not your average drug dealer, fa sho he's
Being watched by police, feds
Investigators, oh--can't forget the haters
Homegirl ain't got a clue what he do for a living
She just think she got a dude with a pension
She don't know this dude is a henchman
And he moves on dudes with the cruelest intentions
All she know she got a brand new Benz
And it's big enough for her and all her brand new friends (Damn)
There she go, all through the street with it
Dude in and outta town, she all through the street with it
We all know the street talk, we all know the street listen
Next day, she's missing....
(music stops, phone rings twice)
(man speaks)""Hello?""
(man on phone)""Hey nigga, I got yo bitch. Have a million sent up or she dead!""
(music resumes)
Damn--she in deep shit, and she did nothing!
I bet you she ain't see this coming, but he did
Cause he did nothing, he ain't pay (pay)
He told 'em keep that bitch, he okay
He got a wife and a kid, back home
And he don't care about the life that she live (Damn)
Now that's wrong (wrong)
But the story ain't over it drags on (aw man what happened next?)
They wind up beating her down
Breathless, he winds up fleeing the town, to the next bitch...
[Hook]

[Juelz]
And um, I say that to say this, a lot of people don't appreciate life until they're gone
I mean, a lot of situations can be avoided, you just gotta avoid 'em, ya dig?
These are just a few stories, man...there's a lot more where they come from
Just don't be one of them people I'm talking bout, ya know...."

And we be dodging them bullets they be popping off at us, shit

And fall in love with the hood until somebody come blast the heat
Always up to no good, so all of my fam could eat
See in the hood we hungry - hey nigga we playing for keeps
My soldiers on the block get on it
It be good if you flaunt it, we will take if we want it
See niggas from the ghetto got a different state of mind
With a different kind of hustle and we iller with the grind
And develop our muscle until we sicker with the shine
In the struggle, thus our money come quicker doing crime

Until your cake stacking shit'll get good
Throw a block party for the whole hood (In the ghetto)
With them burnout cellys
Talk crazy, sell drugs in front of Pancho Deli
Crackhead chicks still smuggle babies in they belly
And then piss in elevators 'til the lobby all smelly (In the ghetto)

I still shine bright like a prism, my words still skippin'
Through air, I know you can't, don't, won't get it (You square)
You niggas chose to ride that ship, sunk with it
I'm still afloat
I ain't the captain of the yacht, but I'm on the boat
I ain't acting what I'm not knowing that I don't
You niggas acting like you will, but I know you won't (You won't, man)
I read between the lines of the eyes and your brows
Your handshake ain't matching your smile, aha, you niggas foul
[Chorus]
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can hear it in your voice
I can feel it in the air

[Verse 2]
I sit alone in my four-cornered room staring at hammers (Hammers)
Ready to go bananas
Two vests on me (Vests on me), two TECs, extra clips on me (Clips on me)
I know my mind ain't playing tricks on me (Damn)
I ain't schiz', homie (Homie), ain't nobody drop a mick on me (Mick on me)
It's like they trying to plot and sit on me
I hear this voice in the back of my mind
Like, ""Mack, tighten up your circle before they hurt you""
Read they body language (Body language)
Eighty-five percent communication nonverbal
Eight-five percent swear they know you, ten percent (You know they story)
Man, the other five, time'll show you, just know you
Then pull they strings, you the puppet master (Puppet master)
Fuck them other bastards (Man), man, watch who you puffin' after
Play your cards, go against all odds
Shoot for the moon, if you miss, you still amongst those stars

[Chorus]
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air (I ain't scared, nigga I ain't goin' nowhere)
I can hear it in your voice (Can you feel it?)
I can feel it in the air (Can you feel me?)
[Verse 3]
Can you feel the grim reaper floatin'? (Can you feel the grim reaper floatin'?)
Foul preacher quotin'
Scriptures from Revelation, was talk shit and got the devil waiting
Body gettin' stiff (Stiff), soul levitatin' (Levitatin')
Why do I speak blasphemy
Knowing one day that he'll ask for me? As for my sins
No one'll feel his wrath for me
I go through it, so you wouldn't do it after me
As for me, I'm still circling the block before I'm parkin'
Not bitching, I'm just still cautious
Same black parka
Same Uzi, extra clips, still clapping with that same Lorcin
Damn, I feel it in the air, you not sincere
Nigga, it ain't an ""us"" or ""we"" or a ""I'ma"" thing
It's a good-bad karma thing, this a song man of honor sing
I swear I feel something, honestly

[Chorus]
I can feel it in the air (I can feel it, I can feel it)
I can feel it in the air (I can feel it, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can feel it in the air (Ooh, yeah)
I can hear it in your voice (Ooh-ooh)
I can feel it in the air (I can, yeah)
I can feel it in the air (Yeah, yeah)
I can feel it in the air (I can feel it in the air)
I can hear it in your voice (Ooh-ooh)
I can feel it in the air (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I can feel it in the air"

Let me show these niggas who I be

Kobe, shoot your jay like Swiss, I'm Swiss, I'm switching modes
Diss these chicks to get this dough, I'm sick, I'm sick, I'm sick for sure
Schizophrenic with the flow, been busting rhymes since Busta's rhyme
Let me bust this rhyme trying to get some more
Baby sip this more, hit this Chris with this piff, try this ex
Drink this lean, try this crack, yup my swag as high as that
Your favorite rapper, he's a joke, nigga, I don't even smoke
I knocked on hip hop's door, no one was home, I had to leave a note
Like bitch, I'm here, this my year, disappear, go get some skills
I'm smooth, I'm cool, I'm slick, I'm chill
I'm dope, I'm fresh, I'm sick, I'm ill
Nigga, rap is mines, it's like these rappers mimes ’cause they ain't saying shit
I'mma need to talk to these rappers’ moms, what's on these rappers minds?
Why all these rappers lying? It's like a bunch of lies
All in these rappers lines, I leave these rappers schooled
Welcome to Swagger School and you ain't shit
Without the big whip and flashy jewels, I'm whatever's after cool
Then whatever's after that, I ain't on no funny shit
You the one I'm laughing at, L-O-L, O-M-G, your jealousy is showing me
That you could never grow to be as cold as me and vocally
My potency's Metallica, you Jodeci, pussy nigga ovaries, who over me?
I oversee from the U.S. to overseas and back again, platinum certified
I murder guys then burglarize from Swaggerville
Mass appeal, black Chevy, classic grill, black desey, bastard chill
You bugging the master still, you sucker get clapped for real
Now clap for real, applaud the King, I'm trying to bring my squad a ring
You Carl Malone, long and gone, bitch I gets my balling on
Watch what name you calling on and that's just a principle
Or you gon’ be in trouble like the principal just called ya home
Off the dome, pen or pad, iPhone it, Sidekick it
Write it in your Blackberry or ancient hieroglyphics
I kicks it doper, iller, lyrically Los a killer
And I done stomped the monkey shit outta most gorillas
‘Cause they just baby apes, heart made of plastic
Like some Bathing Apes, figure deal me real is real, fake is fake
Niggas lied on me, bitches stepped on me
Cowards hated on me, Diddy slept on me, Diddy-Diddy slept on me
It could of broke my spirits, I could of broke down
But I'm a nightmare, I bet these bitches woke now
Or die dreaming, I being fly meaning
Can't fall ‘cause I'm often sky walking, guys barking up the wrong tree
You can't one on one me, nigga, better zone me
Yeah, I kill at hype anger, I'm a life changer
And you so Ray J, you must like Danger

I just murdered this shit like First 48 and I'm gone"
Only Slaves D.R.E.A.M.,Canibus,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Canibus]
Do you think that the powers that be
Are goin' to let you do what you want to do for eternity?
Of course you don't, so what do you fear?
Why you spazzin' out, why you so scared?
Everybody wanna be first
Nobody wants to be last
Do you think a God that created this would watch all of us die while others just laugh?
What happens when the money system crash?
And there's no more value in the cash?
You gon' suck dick and sell ass?
You gon' try to fight back with ya hands?
You probably change your money into gold
You gon' use that to try and buy soul
Buy some drugs with it, buy a piece of hole
Don't tell me, I don't wanna know
You need to come up with a better plan
The Devil smash metal weapons like glass
Right now we out-matched and outclassed
We have to stay on a spiritual path
Cause in the absence of love, we blastin' one another with blood
Media shows up to capture the buzz
I'm a child of God, not a rapper from the gutter
I'm six of one and half a dozen of the other
This is not one of those ""I told you so"" moments
This is just Canibus being open
Lower egoic minds brush aside
But can't nullify the high science that is coming from the rhymes
I couldn't believe it the day that I was told
That every person alive does not have a soul
And is not in control of these cotton pickin' polls
Politicians declare the war of attrition on the globe
And stole all the fishin' holes, Grandma got the chitlins on the stove
That'll overload the senses in your nose
Young folk can't even afford to get old
How many YouTube views before you go gold?
How many albums last week you sold? How many leaked downloads?
Oh, you still believe the Soundscan, bro?
Don't be discouraged, write and produce and record and you love it
This is your art, and that's the point of it
When you get paid from it, things change, people behave stubborn
And say rude things to judge it
They want you to thug it, so they can have you like a test subject
Handcuffed and take mug shots of it
I told you before, I'm nobody's spit puppet
I say what I want, you take what you want from it
This is a social experiment put on by the public
Hip-hop is completely corrupted
You ain't rappin' 'bout that, you ain't rappin' 'bout nothin'
I ain't never gon' starve, I been white tail huntin'
Ya'll motherfuckers is buggin', speakin' with no substance
Hip-hop's the way it is because of you cousin
It ain't my fault, you locked me out of it
99 percent of my fans ain't nothin'
But scumbag, scum buckets, blood suckin', cock fuckers
My lyrics too advanced for the average block hustler
You know my name, I'm deeply inspired
On a mountain lion meat diet, eat and be quiet
Recycle the fire and deep fry it
That line is hot, but you said it before, you get a C minus
My shit is timeless like the Great Wall of China
Sick in the biggest way like a dinosaur virus
Spreadin' through Verizon Wireless
Homeland Security's tryin' it, just to see if you lyin', Bis
They step to me, never thought it would happen like this
You a flight risk, we need that microphone back, Bis
Diversionary tactics, Magik madness
Canibus, you can't leave this miserable prison planet, God damnit
We don't care what your fans think
Cause 99 percent of all of this don't exist
The observer changes the properties of the observed
This is done with your mind, not with your words
Word? Yeah, I'm about to show you nerds
You bookworms really startin' to get on my nerves
I can't talk like you, but I can understand you
I know what this entire ordeal can expand to
I love hip-hop, I've always been a fan too
I'm a big fan of everything you do
I appreciate the purchases, the online searches
I hope you enjoy the verses, it was great to be of service
This was always my purpose
I'm always workin' to be a better person everyday
And still growin' like the Earth is

I'm the greatest ever, cake, and hella, chase endeavors, wave Berettas
Makin' fellas, face dilemmas, bake 'em down in Satan's cellar
Man, I get it shakin' with a rapper, bet you they surrender
Stomp 'em with the male UGG boots, you could taste the leather
Let the dice shake with tremors, bet you I can trey, and better
Head crack, acin', never, uh, uh, pay the cheddar
Master what you ain't remember, champion like a Lakers member
Colder than a late December, hit the bank and shanked the teller
Your girl been chasin' niggas, said she need a baby-sitter
Sendin' me them naked pictures, return straight to sender
Comin' with a stray vendetta, you're about as fake as pleather
Bangin' since I played with Sega, eatin' since the Reagan-era
Man, I'm off the wall like Street Fighter, play with Vega
Got the nickel-plate, whatever, you's a bird, flame your feathers
I'm the crime rate director, better find their protector
Run them over on a track, should've shined their reflectors
I'm a wise, brave inventor, Brooklyn mind-state projector
Quick to vibrate your sector, make them migrate respectors
Ever violate the Mecca, of the rhyme, stage professor
I'll apply, and place the pressure, then annihilate your lecture
We the Tri-State perfecters, with some high-rate investors
While them guys pay for pleasure, we arrive, take your treasure
Mush your pie-faced heifer, push her off a skyscraper, tell her
You should try and pray for better, like that guy Mason Betha
I'm the Friday collector, redefine the face of terror
Bring the helicopters out, make them fly their propellers
Life is like a game of chess; why you guys playing checkers
Hesitate to smoke a dutch, if the kind ain't vanilla
Hustlin', bustlin', strugglin', jugglin', doublin'
He's blunderin', mumblin', fumblin', suckers's stutterin'
The raucous I brung you is tough as a puzzle, it's puzzlin'
Bustin' your bubble, you stuck in a huddle, they huddlin'
He rough, and he mellow, a thug; or he thorough, they wonderin'
Come to the borough, with such a rebuttal, I muzzle 'em
Catch you on 14th and Franklin, I touch you, and tuck it in
Come off the shuttle, and run through the tunnel, I'm troublesome
Cut you, your blood at the puddle, so sudden, it's flutterin'
The front of your mug, is so plugged with a slug, it's discolorin'
This grave is for you, I dug with a shovel, then shoved him in
Death has become you, your sole is above you, it's hoverin'
Blood on my Chuckers, he buckled, I'm chucklin'
I'm humble revenge, I love you, he stumbled, I punished him
Your bones could tumble, I'm thunderous
Since you say you want to rumble in the jungle, the jungle could fuckin' rumble then"

Another show, then we must go
Let's get there fast as we can
We just trying to spread love when we coming to your city
Some look at us shitty but some bitches show us they titties
So I love my job
Don't have to piss in a cup
They tell me to straighten up because of all the kids and stuff
Are gonna be there looking at you perform
So keep your lyrics calm
They might be there with their moms
And pops, you need to drop something clean with no cussing
But my shit is, but nothing, don't wanna hear these parents fussing
Bout your filth flarn filth and you holding your crotch
Nobody wanna hear bout what you wanna poke in they mouth
But that ain't what it's all about, I'm simply trying to have fun
Tryin' to break a leg, preferably my third one
Up in your back, they ask how can you stand there proud
And bow knowin' there's a little child in the crowd
Sayin'

Who is the man, Momma
On stage with the brew in his hands, Momma
Don't you think he's being rude to the fans, Momma
Grabbin his nuts, look at him doin it again, Momma
He's doin it again, Momma

[Verse 2]
You got to give the people
Yeah I know, somethin other than just pussy, alcohol and reefer
You must uplift the public
And they'll give love back
Like just last night I got my nuts licked
Ugly bitch in love but she hugged it and she rubbed it
Fine big red ho, but now my dickhead sore
And we got another show in the O - Ohio
It's kinda nice
I been there once and got my dick sucked twice
Me and my penis and my microphone
Are working hard so I can get my lights back on
Most people don't understand all the problems, pressure and pain
They criticize and try to make you feel less of a mane
But look at these balls, they're so big
The hairs on em look like two big old afro wigs
No need to get alarmed, I don't mean no harm
If you got your kids with you and they tugging your arm

Man, whatever happened to groups like Manhattans
And the Spinners and Temptations and stuff
These new muthafuckas right here
They just wanna fuck and cuss and
Look at em up there smoking weed
Aw, what's wrong, pops
I mean, you act like you never had the Temptation
Of smoking a little weed down in Manhattan
Drinking a beer, boning a bitch you know
While you Spinner around, you know
But maybe you never smoked bud like I smoke bud
Maybe you never felt as high as I felt
Me and my Coughee Brothers just keep blowing and blowing and

[Verse 4]
If you got some shorties, could you make em stay home
Unless they wanna see some grown niggas shaking they bone
I know it's morally wrong, but see I'm known
For passing Doobies to my Brothers, get my Family Stoned
I'm Gladys Knight-time, the Right Time to get high
We reaching for the sky on Earth
There's too much Wind for the Fire
We out here in the parking lot, knocking out the last corners
Of drink we had since yesterday from somewhere at Arizona
We wanna be Kool, we're not a Gang, just trying to hang
With the people and drink, and maybe exchange slang
We love music and we need the fans, need touring
But one thing we don't need is bad-ass children

Your hearse flip from what I'm loading in the gage
So ye ain't gotta wait to roll over in your grave,

Lampin' on the island jus' to see a decent tan
So have my money in total -- ""Kima Keisha Pam"",
All this ice on my wrist that's a risk factor
You wouldn't need this much ice for a wrist fracture,
And roll wit a clique full a chick snatchers
So we didn't really want your bitch it was just practice...
I flick ashes off a yacht deck
All I do is come to a chin like a mock neck,
Stop that I'm from a hood where they never smile
Niggas make that tre pop like Kevin Liles,
My city never blink they be thinkin' cash
And stay clappin' on a nigga like Pinky ass,
That thing flash they snatch chains and karats
Gettin' that dirty money no 'Last Train to Paris'
So to all you rap lames and other suckas
I bet this Mack Maine'll leave you in the Gudda Gudda,
Motherfucker spend a day in these streets and see
Niggas'll do the 'Unthinkable' for at least a key
Uhhh and as soon as them feds swing through
They Draked on you damn I ain't know you sing too,
King who? Run what? We can all assume
You got knocked cause all your goons use Autotune

Inception,Joe Budden,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","The bars show you mad struggle
Along with detailed scriptures of my past trouble
That’s why they try to keep me quiet with a bad muzzle
Can’t take the same leaps and bounds as me
When they lack the hustle and the calf muscle
Words from a legend speaking from the heart
Said, if you going to war, weaponry is a start
Do your dirt all by your lonely, let it be in the dark
You givin birds bread then let it be in the park, Joey
Tip me wrong, mini mall when the semi’s warm
Bout my bread, so I spot it if a penny’s gone
And I’ll bet, learned that from the nets
If you tryna be a Billionaire get rid of any Thorn
Cause you’ll get f-cked if they shoot you, emptied on
It’s just they way of making a mini porn
I watch my haters get sick
If it’s that hard living in my shadow
Get off my silhouette’s dick
Tailor made suits, double breast fit
Set trip, get your name on the next clip
Sometimes before you can add you gotta minus
Some of y’all don’t get the math or the science
It means I’m aiming for wealth
Some say sky’s the limit I say you’re short changing yourself

Without being linked to the majors
My only response is the finger to haters
Watch it get ugly, Mbenga, Lakers
So when they ask how I feel about hip hop
I sighed and replied take a lucky guess
Just being sincere, I ain’t talking pioneer’s
When I tell dudes I don’t think the Dougie’s fresh
Used to roll through the trenches, slept on cold benches
Holds on my expenses, smoke till I was senseless
Now the flow’s so relentless
Fuck CD’s it should be sold in syringes
I can’t explain it they love the sound
Subtle with the pound, you don’t want trouble clown

So if you tired of all the wack dudes, call me in

Must be a flat on that Delorean
I tried tellin them conceded the deals closed
They disagree they believe that they real close
Tough guys turn talk show like Steve Wilko’s
Scream fuck em eat dildos with each pill dose
All the rap dudes they got highly regarded
Tell me they psyche might be slightly retarded
Nowadays before the shows I buy me a cartridge
Those them phony ass dudes they like me to start with
Peepin how the vets wanna stop me
Money where your mouth is Ted DiBiase
And he won’t be able to reach for a biscuit
With O’s on his head like a B-more fitted
Black hoody and black tux
Tearin stacks up, with a model and her rack tough
Gettin my Extreme Makeover on
Knock that bitch down and build her back up
Think twice before you act up
Around flames, wrong time to be gassed up
You never heard blowing smoke from a grass hut

You should wanna see me daily like Carson does
The interview and performance was raw as fuck

[Hook]
[Verse 3]
These rap people is starting to sound like Enya
So I will eat these bugs, Simba
Top five rappers, I'm not feelin'
Top three musicians: Me, Georg Solti, and John Williams
Going over composers, I'm focused
I sample the dopest, and the piano gets broken
Whenever my hands get to strokin'
Fall off, not by a chance, cause you're hopin'
This isn't written, it's on the top of the head
I put my little homie on, I was plotting, not dead
I heard people wanna pop me for bread
They got a better chance going to a rock for a keg
Not the country, a rock I said
Rocks aren't even dead, snort a rock to the head
Meantime, I'm watching the feds
Who got a problem? Enough said

Voices In My Head,K'naan,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Eh yo, welcome to my world, please listen
HEY!

[Hook:]
Poison in my veins, inside I'm torturing my brains
And still I try, aiaiai
Voices in my head, am I alive or am I dead
Alone I cry, aiaiaiai

[Verse 1:]
Consider configure The shit that I'm in and the pain, I'm literally going insane
I'm frightened, my heart and my head have been fightin
I'm certain that it's hurtin the rest of my body
Them voices as loud as Manhattan come chattin
They say ""Who met us and let us in?"" and you kno you better than al of these replicates screamin they represent
C'mon man c'mon man
And the people inside me say they wanna see me go on tragically
And it's evil, cause I'm only 20 something working for a crumbs n some bread

[Hook]
[Verse 2:]
The harder the struggle the deeper the trouble
Come out of the bubble, I'll teach you to cuddle
With demons inside me, what demon is not me
These demons inside me they got me, they stop me from sleepin
And eatin and keepin it even, and even my reason for breathin this season
Sleetin in a danger, my nose when I'm readin, it's bleedin on paper
It's bleedin on paper
And I'm tired of this violence, so tortured inside? ain't akward and overly open inside, have I already died
Has mom already cried? And why do I feel like I'm over this life
I'm not hateful, I'm grateful, my girlfriend is tasteful, livin it up
I might even blow, like a leak in a truck, with a torch and a clutch
And explosion that leaves a whole coughin off dust, and the people
Inside me saying, they wanna see me go tragically
And it's evil, cause I'm only twenty something, working for some crumbs and some bread

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
I'm still awake, and it's quarter to six
I'm trying to write and I ain't thought of no shit
I live with guilt like I slaughtered the sick
I live with shame, like my daughter a bitch
I don't make living but I still persist, I could sell out but I still resist
So don't tell me about no pain and shit
I was born and raised in poverty bitch
And I smile all the while and don't complain
I'm something like Gil Scott heroine
Do you know what it feels like to lose a friend, again and again and again, again
The bitterness in the killer the poet, the river of blood within the mess flowin
I'm the bitterness in the killer the poet, the river of the blood will keep on flowin
People inside me say, the wanna see me go on tragically
And it's evil, it's evil, cause I'm only twenty something working for a crumb or some bread or nothin

Yo, wanna rumble with the Pun, huh
*blows raspberry* Shit on the whole industry
Who puff more Owls than Pun? Pile on more styles than Pun?
Who the only one with over a thousand guns?
Running up in niggas cribs like I paid the bill
Make you squeal the combination to the safe for wealth
I lace your grill with the firestarter
Hit your wife with the sawed off in the shower, power-drive ya daugther
I'm all about the fundamentals like Pun and pencil
A piece of paper, a decent caper and someone to strafe you
My mental's compatible with the radicals
My odyssey type qualities allow me to poli' with animals
Niggas is cannibals and the ghetto's the jungle
Where you either bet all your bundles or struggle or live civil and humble
My niggas'll rumble with any man for a Benny Fran'
Try to imagine what they can fathom for twenty grand
Niggas'll slice you and dice you into a thousand pieces
We pound out weak shit into the ground Uptown
Up in the Boogie Down we just wallow in jean, pile on the green
Surrounded in green like flowers in Spring
But now I'm a King, so it's more than money
All the honies used to call me Punny
'Cause my fam was always hungry
But now we rolling lovely and you feel worse
Want my money, let your steel burst
'Cause I'd rather see you in Hell first

Yo, yo, yo keep the lights, keep the camera, all I want is the action
The battle's on, where I roam in composition
A hardcore crowd waiting to see if I break
Like your first time in jail when you got fucked by an inmate
It'll never happen, I'm on balance like a Libra
And if I get murdered, Don't Cry For Me Argentina
Pour me a cup of vodka, bury me next to my father
In three days, I'll rise like Christ and still sober
Now my eyes open in my hands I got the Gatling
I'm looking for the guy that sent me to say hi to Satan
Fists of fury, you wouldn't like me when I'm angry
I turn Mr. Roger's Neighborhood topsy turvy
Foes and enemies meaning the same in the dictionary
This ain't Pictionary, all you see is the cemetery
Bodies from World War I and II is there
You don't want a third war, that's nuclear warfare
So Big Pun, count the stacks, make it fast
Illegal money turns legal now we running a laundromat
Your hunchbacked and wack rap is packed in your backpack
You're better off in D.C. with the mayor smoking crack
This ain't a diss, Wyclef bomb threat
Run out of the building or get blast in your Guess
TEC for TEC or we can go text for text, oh
I forgot, you don't read so take this hole in your chest - blaow!
Hide the blood, give you the gun, run and hide

Lu Myself,Lupe Fiasco,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Lupe Fiasco]
Lu myself, first of all accuse myself for being a fool
All attempts to school myself have failed
To improve means to remove myself
From this pool of sharks, dark as the mood I felt
I’m losing fuel, that’s all the food I refuse myself
That’s how you do when you do yourself
And if I lose, I could never excuse myself
Till I grow old, sit back and accrue my wealth
You don’t stand a chance, matter of fact, you don’t have half the stance
To stand if you stood half a chance
Like c-h-a to dance with this man from the C.H.A’s
Give it up, just abandon plan
Since you don’t have half the stance like an amputee
You don’t have half the pants that it takes
To command a family
The fan or command a fee
So you will never get the ransom you demand from me
The good news, my foot’s loose, my hands is free
So I dance all footloose and fancy free
Big Ups to footloose and all the fans of me
My fan base expands from Vans to Timberlands
From mansions to Section 8 campuses B
I’m they champion and I ain’t even SoundScanned it, see, I been lamping
Whipping up an answer to these rappers who got it backwards
Like zipping up their pants to pee
Like I’m just a rapper and I ain’t dapper
I'm frequently fly, I can go to France for free
But I ain’t no fan in base, cooking up grams of C
We in a wet stretching O’s like rubber bands to feed
But that was white boy 100 grand to key
When I’m posted up with this little punk ass chump cash advance
That they handing me, I came back with birds like Brandon Lee
I came back with words in a stanzas G
Told ya, right back like Stan, I'mma stand till it answers me
I’m concentrating man, I'm an oscillating fan
When they wanna shake hands with me, it sucks right now
Hear it through ya spirit just dampens B
Like damn that was my man, what the hell happened to he?
His fan base is disbanded B
‘Cause his lyrics don’t mirror when he first landed see
Don’t give into this land to please
So help me God, I'mma kill it, that’s my word
Remove this blindfold, just give us a chance to see
And I'mma quit it the minute it abandons me
My plan’s to be here for a minute
Then I’m finished, then I’m vamping G
Most these cats is pussies, pearl tongues, oysters and clams to me
Flintstone money can’t even stand being in their glances geez
They say it’s looking good, from my vantage B?
Shit is sinking like Atlantis B and I’m more set than Alanis
What, you ain’t understanding me? Am I speaking Spanish B?
Well adios holmes, am I getting sloppy Joe? Well what am I, a Manwich B?
I got a Big Mac if you want a sandwich G
Who else you know keep the Mickey D tucked
With the windy on his shoulder? I told ya, give it up dog, it’s over"

I met a man, who wasn't there
He wasn't there again today
I wish I wish, he would go away

[Intro: Chino XL, Therapist]
Mr. Barbosa, it's a brave step you comin to get help
And I commend you for that
But we gotta figure out what you want uh-huh
What do you really want? yo, c'mon

[Verse One: Chino XL, Therapist]
Dreams of my grandmother's house
That's where you felt the safest
The word ""therapist,"" split it in half ""the rapist""
Yo who the fuck are you to analyze my behaviors?
Oh I promise you all this anger you showin is anguish
I guess I wasn't ready to be so famous
But you couldn't live with yourself if you had remained nameless
It's been me, myself and I all my life
Now me and this psychiatrist tryin to explain what we write
Explain whether I'm black or I'm white
Explain cryin myself to sleep every night
Explain slashin my wrists with a knife
Too high, Icarus flight, niggas is right
I'm the lowest form of human being, for being different
For being gifted, for feelin iffy about writin verses with no meaning
In relationships you showin too much feeling
Why would any woman treat you better than you said
You were treated by your own mother?
I heard out of the mouth of a 25-year-old woman without the initiative
To wanna move out of her momma's house but claimin she wanna be my spouse
Questions unanswered by psychiatric profession
My little cousin's an alter boy
But some priest altered that boy during confession
I think a gun's a better investment
But you stepped into my practice right now seekin direction
It's the end of your session
See this weapon? I ain't ready to leave, 'fore I have seen the enemy
[Hook: Chino singing]
I just want, to, be... safe in my own skin

[Verse Two: Chino XL, Therapist]
Finally I'm ready to be safe in my own skin
I'm tired of searchin for love I never got
Until you rocked
Yeah, Chino XL took over to protect Derek Barbosa
Okay, now we're gettin closer
I was an only child and he bought me Monopoly
That takes at least three people to play it
That wasn't stoppin me
Wasn't hard for me to be more than one person
Rehearsin at 7 years-old Brad Pitt in ""Fight Club""'s Tyler Durden
Behind close curtains
That's it!
Every time a child suffers a trauma the personality splits
I seen it in cases where women are raped
It's like the spirit leavin the body as some form of escape
It never comes back quite the right way
Creatin a person to save 'em you might say
But enslaves me in another way, I'm like a 28-year-old runaway
Mr. Barbosa, could you please put the gun away?
I wanna end it like Hitler, cyanide and a bullet at the same time
I mean he is the same zodiac as mine
Let's talk about your mom
What about my mom?
What about a mom and all the closest friends that she lost in Vietnam
Does that excuse her for being such a selfish bitch?
Or lettin my grandfather die on a park bench?
Freezing cold from a heart attack on Christmas
His heart broken like some Greek wedding dishes
Are you happy Doctor hearin all my business?
Well here's more, right now I don't know where one of my kids is
I've been forbidden for visitin where the baby lives
Craziness the decision, the crib's in a place that's dangerous
See right now I'm missin so much that I wanna vomit
Drowning my sins in a gin and tonic
Yeah but when you pick up the bottle
To drink out of it, it really drinks out of you
True
Metaphor, the most powerful of right hemisphere techniques
But your case, it's ruinin you..

[Verse Three: Chino XL, Therapist]
Yo Doctor, do you really deserve to get paid for what you think?
Do you lack in manhood, is that why they call you a shrink?
Heard Mariah's one of your clients, but her breakdown's persist?
Behind her back do you ever just call her ""crazy bitch?""
You are prone to depression
That don't take a genius to see
You call this your practice, you ain't practicin on me
As a child they gave me Ritalin to calm down
As a grown man record companies keep fiddlin with my sound
My abandonment issues run deeper than you know
I'll tell you all about it on my next album, I promise
My family ain't ready for me to be that honest
It'll change everything like yoga changed Madonna
Like India changed Alanis, staring at my reflection like I'm Adonis
But Derek, why you so angry and violent?
I'm a broken machine - my past
Is water under the bridge but the lies have poisoned it from upstream
It's that sad of a dream that can shatter the mind
Of a child and destroy the thing that holds him together by string
Feedin off my own emotion that my girl split
I'm sorry Doctor, I'm just nuttier than squirrel shit
Maybe not, you cannot give in to global consiousness
And your individuality will be dead like Charles Bronson is
Manuel Barbosa, that's who my father is, fellow misogynist
He's still in the Bronx, let him know Chino accomplishes
Monsterous ghetto concertos, respected artist like Mozart is
But he could've alleviated some of the hardships
My prognosis, when you're confronted
With a difficult situation, you have failure to regulate
The correct emotional reaction, causin unnecessary
Depression or anger towards normal things that would happen
The doctor started laughin, I asked ""Why you offendin me?""
He said
Do you realize that you've invented me?
You're alone in this room and I think you need some help
I really hate to see you livin in this hell
It been seven years now that you've been sittin in this cell
Awaitin execution for the murder of your wife Michelle
To my knees I fell - the guards busted in
But no matter how hard they beat me, I still refused to yell..
{*whispered*: I saw my mother's face}

I just want, to, be... happy again

{*whispered*: Just wanna be safe}

I'm just a picture in a frame
I paint word pictures on the canvas of life
But I don't control the colors

[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm ten steps ahead of niggas, that shit scary
Sometimes I feel ahead of myself
I hear this voice in the back of my mind
Like ""Mack maintain, just grind, dog, better yourself""
So what I do? I take heed and pick up the pace
Can't explain it when I pick up my son and look at my face
I'm like a black rose growin' in the concrete crackin' the pavement
There that voice go again ""Mack practice for greatness
Get paid for them immaculate statements""
Keep thinkin' of them hot lines, like a physic, I can't explain it
There's no pen when I write it, it's nothing like it

[Interlude]
Goddamn, what you want from me
What you want me to tell you huh?
Niggas thought that I would stutter huh, thought I was dumb
[Verse 2]
But I ain't used to use my mind, I used to just use my 9
And run wild with my boys, in the streets wild with these wars
Now the Qur'an and 48 laws, they polish my flaws
I'm movin' niggas like puppets with no strings attached
It's nothin' for Beans, so you know it ain't a thing for Mack
To look in your eyes, see through your heart, know what you fearin'
Pick you apart, like you niggas is transparent
(I see right through you niggas)
It's like Mack was born with advanced parents
I'm like the Sun shinin' at night
Imagine it dog, I know you wanna see me gradually fall
But I'm walkin' on air, breakin' every gravity law
It's nothin' like it, I swear
I spit words that skip through air
Let the words of a true thug hit your ear
It change colors like blue blood when it hit the air
It's nothin' like it

[Interlude]
Goddamn, shit, I can't explain it
Fuck y'all niggas

[Verse 3]
I changed my whole life in about 9 months, just like sperm in a womb
These young niggas never learn 'til they doomed
Try to tell them ""you can burn young punk without smellin' the fumes""
Make you shiver in the middle of June
Paint a picture so vivid, you can hang it up in your room
Shine bright like a prism, displayin' colors like Crayola
Think of the prisons with straight soldiers
Think about the niggas who fucked us and played over us
Think about the mothers who suffered and prayed over us
Just look at the the picture I'm paintin', it's so perfect
Open your eyes motherfuckers, you can't duck us
No survivors every soul shall suffer
I'm loadin' up revolvers every shell shall touch ya
I promise it's like jihad with these mags, I'ma bust ya
[Outro]
Goddamn it's nothin' like it, I'm serious
Can't explain how I write it"

Cold War,Janelle Mone,['rock'],"[Verse 1]
So you think I'm alone?
But being alone's the only way to be
When you step outside
You spend life fighting for your sanity

[Chorus]
This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for
This is a cold war
Do you know what you're fighting for?

[Verse 2]
If you want to be free
Below the ground is the only place to be
Cause in this life
You spend time running from depravity

[Chorus]
This is a cold war
Do you know what you're fighting for?
This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for
This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for
This is a cold war
Do you know what you're fighting for?
[Bridge]
Bring wings to the weak and bring grace to the strong
May all evil stumble as it flies in the world
All the tribes comes and the mighty will crumble
We must brave this night and have faith in love

[Verse 3]
I'm trying to find my peace
I was made to believe there's something wrong with me
And it hurts my heart
Lord have mercy, ain't it plain to see?

[Chorus]
But this is a cold war
Do you know what you're fighting for?
This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for

[Bridge]
This is a cold....
This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for
Kellindo!
Do you know? It's a cold, cold war...
Do you?
Do you?
Do you..ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh

You better know what you're fighting for

Bye bye bye bye, don't you cry when you say goodbye
Bye bye bye bye, don't you cry when you say goodbye"
Spaceship,Kano,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook 1: Kano]
Spaceship will take off and fly
There's no turning back when you arrive
To a whole other world outside
Far away from here

[Verse 1: Kano]
She floats around the globe just like she owns it
Aerobics to fit the smaller clothing
She's sweet 16 and wants a Roley
Presidential golden, guest list and she rolls in
She looks into the mirror, don't like what she sees
She's curvy but she wants the Cheryl Cole physique
She's living through the TV and the magazines
Passport, she wants to board a spaceship to celebrity
She loathes life, rolls the dice, hopes it's high
She so admirers others lives with no insight
Confused in the cocoon that she's wrapped inside
Assumes it's greener so she dreams of living on the other-side
Living in a another world, star-studded, astronomy
A spaceship to send her round in space, like prodigy
She's blinded by the lights, she books the flight online
She's hoping to arrive in paradise, right
[Hook 2: Kano]
Spaceship will take off and fly
There's no turning back when you arrive
To a whole other world outside
Far away from here
Blinded by the stars in her eyes
Running away from her lies
Searching for a way to paradise
Far away from here

[Verse 2: Kano]
The writing's on the wall, it's actually in the posters
But nobody knows 'cos they locked her alone in her room and no one goes in
Sign on the handle, ""please do not disturb""
She's on Skype talking to a modelling agent and she's giving him a twirl
You can be the next Naomi, just show me that they ain't phony
I can't touch it through the screens, so fuck it sweetheart, let's meet
Tells her ""I can you famous, million dollar pay check
Front cover Zoo shoot, that when you know you made it
Pick up in Mercedes, drop off at the station
Stars in their eyes, ""tonight Matthew, I'm gonna be famous""
And if I'm stood there waiting, you are gonna change it
I can get to zero, hero, save me
From this world, 'cos I ain't Miss World
But I'll be Miss Universe when the spaceship returns
Haha, she thinks she'll be Miss Universe when the spaceship returns

More Cowbell,Asher Roth,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Christopher Walken (SNL skit)]
Guess what?
I got a fever, & the only prescription
Is more cowbell
(Audience laugher)

[Verse: Asher Roth]
Yeah, yo yo
In the meadows where we grow the rose petals
And we sip a glass of Merlot
While I blow the Portabello
Like Cruello with a Cigarillo
Hello, Listen Up
This is Asher from the Morrisville
A little North of Truck
What the fuck?
Oh you didn't know little homie flow?
He a pro, Use a little more
You's a little slow, how slow?
Little Kelso. Smoking elbows?
If so, let me know I'll just give you my cell phone
Hell froze, Elmo, I'm sticking like Velcro
So, you ain't got the pasta you don't get the Pesto
Presto, Go to infinity and beyond it
Rhyme shit spitting gets imprinted on your conscious
Ash, shit, this world's sitting in your palm
And it's important that you know this
So you never get it wrong
Says my Mom as she reads the Tarot cards and the stars
This called me to go and be a motherfucking boss, Ricky Ross
Look at Paul Roth, kid is all talk
He's a narc, he's a lost cause
Fuck em cut em off
But this dog's off his leash
I'm showin yall my teeth when I speak
Yeah, I mean I bring Prometheus heat
Lean in your seat
You'd think that they'd be leaping to see
A commercial MC keep an ear to the street
Because Jeez
We sick of watching all this shit go on
But this song ain't done yet, so son you start marching
A marksman, Part Marge, Part Bart Simpson
But the other parts Descartes, Bars is raw wisdom
A lost art. I talk part of a larger mission
But you'd rather slack off with Sharks than pay attention
So Bark Bark, another subpar spittin'
Yeah, my time is limited and I refuse to waste a minute
So finish, Bustin' Ass, Snuffaluf-gas
In the cab huffin' grass, Fuck it I puff puff pass
Enough of that, Oughta buy out the suckerin' succotash
Sup with Ash? Yo, what happened?
Yo, I heard that fucker cracked
Yo, I heard he was abducted they put something in his ass
Well, I heard he had a run-in with a bear and got attacked
Now, Where'd you come up with that
Run and tell your mother that this motherfucker's back
Paper or plastic? Nah. I bring my own bags
Now how you want to pay for that? Straight cash
Evil Laugh
Yeah, I've been playing phone tag for the last
6 months with my label, Tell them fools to call me back
I play charades sippin' chardonnay fifty times a day
Feeling great, can't wait to taste the marmalade
Fade away, Himalayan retreat to find me
Good grief. Loose leaf? I treat it like Bruce Lee
Who's he? Why y'all keep seeing truth in 2D?
My speech be like I mixed Rufies with Kool Keith"

I bet they never seen him comin'
Like a blind bitch you fuckin' from behind
It's the motherfuckin' dime, bitch I'm fucking up rewind buttons
My shit is jumping like Lebron
Fayettenam on my back like some scratches from your lady
On your mattress where they gave me that
I bet niggas can't wait to pay me back
While they relax, I stay in tip-top shape
And I stay up on my toes like some gym socks, flip-flops
Tell them hater to rehab, kick rocks
Game tight like Ziploc
Half-Black, other half white like Kid Rock
Try to tell it to a cizz-op
Thought it would work, it did not
He told me ""Nigga stizz-op, you know you is not""
Wrote the ticket and rizz-ocked
Fuck, this is for hip-hop, gassed up like a quick stop
They lit a fire under my ass nigga my shit hot
Even if you squatted over volcanoes, niggas your shit not
I'm raw, but I kid not
Your shit flop, I give props to the legends
Praise God but I give not to the reverends
Lookin' up to the heavens like
""Where did all my blessings go?"" You chase a dream
But then you stop, guess you'll never know
I got a show for you to watch, here's an episode, professional
Set to blow any minute now, many women smile
Look the lights and the action, and the cameras be callin'
You niggas got to log in, bitch, you fantasy ballin'
I snuck up like I planned to be, this ain’t random, we called it
Like once they get a hit of this, they hooked like that Twitter shit
Thought I get a deal and head straight to the dealership
But looking at my deal I probably can't afford benefits
Medical, dental shit, left but I always came
Back like a rent-a-whip, dirty ass game
Dog, I could run a kennel with all these bitch niggas
Who don't lift a finger yet they wanna ride in the limo with
Me, I switch the tempo on them sort of like Timbo on em'
Start talking that ""we"" shit, I pause Nintendo on 'em (hahaha!)
Start talking that beef shit, I turn to kimbo on em'
I got no words for these niggas I'm instrumental on em'
Yeah! And I'll still keep goin', keep flowin'

Woooo! J. Cole! Yeah, J. Cole! Woo!

A house full, getting to it, you know how we do it
Yea we smoke great, and we drink good
Then we ball hard, just like G's should
Buy what we want, drive what we want
G4 up up and away, we go, we fly where we want
Haters smile like they like it when they really don't
Wish they could just wish me away that what they really want
""I really hate his ass"", ""I don't like him either""
""We'll do a song together maybe then we can beat him""
Somehow he must be stopped, something must be done
""If we can't knock him off, let's just try him when he get caught with guns""
""And if he really done, and we really won""
""Any more ideas, (I got some) suggestions anyone?""
""How 'bout we stay up all night, on the blog sites""
""Spread, vicious lies and nasty rumors we could all write""
But that's all right, let the nerds hate
Cause in my face though, them words getin' ate
And hatin's hard work, when I just bounce back
This God work, tell all the haters I'm back!

Ooh
J. Reyez, Tommy C
Yeah, just all the things we been through has been crazy
But even though we had to let go
I just want you to know that
I still love you, I still got you

[Verse 1: Tommy C.]
Never should've let you go
Never found myself at home
Ever since that day that you walked right out the door
You were like my beating heart
That I, I can't control
Even though we've grown apart
My brain can't seem to let you go
Thinking back to the old times
When you kept me up late at night
We use to mess around
Laugh and play, fuss and fight
[Pre-Chorus: Tommy C.]
I guess it's too late, I'm dancing this dance alone
This chapter's done, the story goes on

[Chorus: Tommy C.]
Baby, can't believe that you are not with me
'Cause you should be my lady
All I want is to set your heart free
But if you believe that you belong with him
Promise me, you won't let anyone hurt you
Remember, I will always be here for you
Even if it kills me to see you
In that wedding dress (dress, dress)
Oh, see you in that wedding dress (dress, dress)
See you in that wedding dress (dress, dress)
Oh, see you in that wedding dress, oh no

[Verse 2: Tommy C.]
Snappin' out this misery
Depression, this ain't me
But I always turn around 180 degrees
You got control of me that I, I can't explain
Somebody call 911 Emergency before I go insane
Since you've moved on, you took a piece of me, give it back
So much pain in my chest, blacking out, heart attack
[Pre-Chorus: Tommy C.]
I guess it's too late, I'm dancing this dance alone
It's too late...

Baby, can't believe that you are not with me
'Cause you should be my lady
All I want is to set your heart free
But if you believe that you belong with him
Promise me, you won't let anyone hurt you
Remember, I will always be here for you
Even if it kills me to see you
In that wedding dress
Oh, see you in that wedding dress (dress, dress)
See you in that wedding dress (dress, dress)
Oh, see you in that wedding dress, oh no

[Verse 3: J.Reyez]
It's the J-R-E-Y-E-Z
And I see you with your man
And it's hard to understand
If we belong, if I did you wrong
Where we even began
We would always fuss and fight
And it seems nothing was right
But I loved you girl, and you were my world
But you'd never trust this guy
'Cause the things I do when I'm on the stage
They say I'm a superstar
You couldn't understand all the female fans
And then we grew apart
And I just don't get when you're acting like some other person
But I try my best to hold on at the times when it ain't working
Uh, and every time that you say it's over
It breaks my heart and I don't know why
'Cause you've done it a lot of times in the past
But I get back up and try
You said we could work it out
How could you hurt me now?
And you moved on to the next
I'm left with an imperfect smile
[Chorus: Tommy C.]
But if you believe that you belong with him
Promise me, you won't let anyone hurt you
Remember, I will always be here for you
Even if it kills me to see you
In that wedding dress (dress, dress)
Oh, see you in that wedding dress (dress, dress)
See you in that wedding dress (dress, dress)
Oh, see you in that wedding dress, oh no"

Why the hell they doin' this?

Let me start by sayin this prolly the realest track I ever made
The streets I grew up in remind me of the Everglades
Cats runnin' round da block, Trynna get me caught up with em
Then be the first to snitch when the Five O stick em
Lights off, I see more than your own pair of eyes do
Real Recognize Real, and I don't recognize you
You follow lifestyles of what you see on TV
I'm from a town where real niggas are like endangered species
So whatchu mean? When you say you hate me
Do you envy the fact that harvey been shinin' lately?
Do you not respect and love the fact that I'm livin' my dream?
Or do you reject my grind cuz I'm not on your team?
Life rule number 1: Don't never depend on nobody for shit

And you got 1 question in your mind
Like where my real niggas at?
Why the hell they doin' this?
I'm trynna put my city on cuz ain't nobody doin it
But now I know, uh, But now I know, uh
But now I know, where my real niggas is
All my real niggas here, real niggas here
All my real niggas here, real niggas here

[Verse 2: Harvey J]
When they see me in the streets yeah they like to mug
Talkin' shit accelerated by the influence of drugs
Got them thugs more wreckless than usual
I walk away from it they nothin' far from dillusional
Uh, I'm trying not to live the savage life
Just trynna get this cabbage right... yeah
But this the world as I see it as
Shit is happenin' way to fast
I'm trynna predict the future but I can't even see the past
I might just be like every nigga that want a piece of ass
Take advantage of the pussy cuz it might just be your last
Uh, So I'm ridin real solo, the girls that used to be a no show
At the movie dates are now trynna get a photo
Harvey J Concert
Cartier Comfort... but
I remember all the cold nights textin' lonely
Now ever since I met success my old friends checkin' on me
[Hook: QWLD]
When theres money to be made
And your friends turn to foes

[Non-stop]
(Yo, check me out right here yo)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Yo, yo, we can't stay alive forever
So if shit hit the fan, then we might as well die together
I'm high as ever, more hoes and more cheddar
G-Unit move around with them pounds and Berettas
Yeah faggot, if I want it, I'm gon' have it
Regardless if it's handed to me, or I gotta grab it
Don't make a ass out of yourself trying to stop me
I'm cocky, rap's Rocky, nigga you sloppy
You know that I'm, eight levels above you nigga
I'll club you nigga, I never heard of you nigga
Ugly nigga, I'm the wrong one to provoke
You ratting on niggas is only going to leave you smoked
So the only thing left now, is toasts for these cowards
I got no friends; fuck most of these cowards
They pop shit; 'till we start approaching these cowards
While we lay around dollars; they lay around flowers
[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
I got a industry gangstress, that argues, and steams the reefer
And flip when I call her bitch, like she Queen Latifah
Now all the vehicles is long enough to stash the street sweeper
This shit can get uglier than the Master P sneaker
I'm sliding through the Rucker, with Prada on the chuckers
So the spring break hoes home from college wanna fuck us
I ain't here to drop knowledge on you suckers
I sic Rottweilers on you fuckers, cops following to cuff us
Top dollars to discuss this, whole lot of zeros
When it comes to paper, I blow the soul out a hero
I'ma break before I lay in the floor buried, besides
Every rapper ain't a star, and every plaid ain't Burberry
You can't tame Lloyd, we're smoking by the big screen
Changing the channel, looks like I'm playing the Game Boy
I know the watch bothering your vision
But reach, and I put a dot on your head
Like it's part of your religion
Why party with a pigeon? I'm blowing a ten
Because Bush handing out flyers, for a party in the prison
I'm in the Gucci vest, with the green and red straps
I'm the last rapper to scare niggas since Craig Mack
Now every morning's a fast start
But it ain't a problem getting dressed
'Cause my closet got more aisles than Pathmark
Run when we starting a raid
Or leave with twelve shells in your mouth, like a carton of eggs
I'm a young pimp, pardon my age
I don't got long hair, but if I did she'd be parting my braids
Niggas find out what club they at, take them with us
And run a trains on 'em, like a subway map
Your advance is a grey Acura; see these record labels
Got most artists getting fucked like the gay rapper
I go to college on the tour
I'm going down in history nigga, next to Wallace and Shakur
Keep your ammo clean, TECs polished in the drawer
Camera's by the hampers that monitor the floor
By now, you probably heard of me, fresh out of surgery
Flashy as a fuck, you going to have to murder me
Burglary, I'm leaving with your Nikes burgundy
White tee burgundy, you match now, back down
Niggas love to hate you, but love you when you disappear
Catch me on a boat, with weed smoke and fishing gear
Heavy when I tote, C-notes from different years
Bezzy and the rope, remotes and lifting chairs
You ain't rich, but we glad to snatch ya
I send cars to your crib like I'm a cab dispatcher
You better off with the stupid guys, looking for a coupe to drive
You ain't getting nutting, but you french fries supersized
It's a damn shame y'all still local
I'm in a million dollar studio laying my vocals, nigga
[Outro: 50 Cent]
You still in the projects nigga, you ain't going nowhere
You going to be there for the rest of your motherfucking life
And your mama saying: I'm supposed to tell you something, to encourage you
Something positive, alright:
Well, I ain't going to lie to you motherfucker;
You ain't going nowhere
Get yourself a beer, and get on the fucking curb {*gunshot*}
Fucking dirtbag {*gunshot*}"

No half-stepping, just full transition
Boy got drive like Ford transmissions
Just one man and a little ambition
No days off while the game all sleep
I just play ball, bitch, I'm on a A-Rod streak
At it way hard come snow, rain, or sleet
Grab a day job, they ain't got a thing on me
See those that talk shit
Like I ain't stay down to stand up
On my Rosa Park shit
Swag superman, the flow’s Clark Kent
How bums sleeping on me like Los a park bench?
But believe I plan to teach
They ain't even made the heights I plan to reach
I'm on a run, so hot I need antifreeze
But in the mean time, I'm working on my Grammy speech
Life hard, go harder
Get knocked down, get up, go farther
Won't sell my soul for no offer
Won't sell out for shit so don't bother
No father, rest in peace
Show love to some niggas, to the rest it's “Peace!”
Catch a flight then I'm getting back at ya
You never leave the home, you’re just a back catcher
My raps capture the post of the nation
Spirit of the hustlers, hope of the Hatian
Goals that we chasin’, no limitation
Provoke innovation of whole generations
Yep, I'm on that jet fuel, nephew
Catch you, pass you, lapped you, left you
Step one, nigga, watch who you step to
Step two, nigga, know what you step for
Step three make a nigga take a step back
Cause step four make a nigga have to step off
Now step five is easy like step one
You step to me wrong I make you my stepson
That's the father in me
I'm sonning these rappers, father MC
Ayo, who farther than me?
Slash cooler, slash iller, slash smarter than me?
Yeah, so tell them hating niggas step off
Or watch that .40 throw bullets, Brett Favre
With my right arm you get left off
Plus I write hooks that hit like a left cross
Yup, and my new car special
The grill mean like a Q Dog at a step show
It's too easy, I'm tellin’ you baby boy
I'm that motherfucker like Melvin from baby boy
Get it?
If not get a broke nigga slip knot
And kill yourself, that'll help save hip hop
Stop walking round this bitch like a big shot
You the same type of motherfucker got BIG shot
So I'm screaming “Zero!” ‘til this bitch stop
Hit hard like a B-Hop rib shot
Yup, I love Moms, and I miss Pops
Riding ‘til the wheels fall off, no pit stop"

You know I get fly, you think I get high
You know that I'm gone and I'm-a tell you all why

So tell me who are you dissing; maybe I'm missing
The reason that you're smiling or wyling, so listen
In my head, I just want to take 'em down
Imagination set loose and I'm gonna shake 'em down

[Verse 3: MCA]
Let it flow like a mud-slide
When I get on, I like to ride and glide
I've got depth of perception in my text, y'all
I get props at my mention 'cause I vex, y'all
[Verse 4: Ad Rock]
So what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want? (what'cha want?)
I get so funny with my money that you flaunt
I said, ""Where'd you get your information from, huh?
You think that you can front when revelation comes?""

Well they call me Mike D, the ever-loving man
I'm like Spoonie Gee (whoo ooh), I'm the metropolitician (yeyeyeyeah)
You scream and you holler about my Chevy Impala
But the sweat is getting wet around the ring around your collar

[Verse 6: MCA]
But like a dream I'm flowing without no stopping
Sweeter than a cherry pie with Reddi Whip topping
Going from mic to mic, kickin' it wall to wall
Well I'll be calling out to people like a casting call

[Verse 7: Ad Rock]
Ah, well, it's wack when you're jacked in the back of a ride
With your know, with your flow, when you're out getting by
Believe me, what you see is what you get
And you see me, I'm coming off as you can bet

This time I'm losing my mind; that's right
I said I think I'm losing my mind, this time
This time, I'm losing my mind

I'm tired of driving, it's due time that I walkabout
But in the meantime, I'm wise to the demise
I've got eyes in the back of my head so I realize

[Verse 10: Ad Rock]
Well I'm Dr. Spock, I'm here to rock, y'all
I want you off the wall, if you're playing the wall
I said what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)
I said what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)

See, I'm the long leaner Victor the Cleaner
I'm the illest motherfucker from here to Gardena

Well I'm as cool as a cucumber in a bowl of hot sauce

Shotgun on the kitchen table, bullet shells in the cabinet
Fucking with me is like stepping on the tail of a dragon
Wet pussy is my cabin, more bitches than a pageant
I keep a house full, nigga—call me Bob Saget
Spending time backwards, hotter than a cactus
And we ain't in the building—we the fucking contractors

Open up your mouth, and catch a bomb, baby, haha!

Let's drink wine from the purest grapevine and rhyme
Out my motherfucking mind
Metal shine, light blind, cut the mic line
Catch juice from the lamp pole
Fifteen twenty-inch woofers blow the manhole
Made the street crack, massive feedback
Allah Math spin the beat back
The crowd look while the stage shook
Carpenters made errors
Craftsmen had his head severed
Pyroclastic flow, heavy like tons of snow
Wrote this rhyme in video, verbal assassin
Blastin, exploit your break through explosively
Echo chamber ate that rap up ferociously
Gain control, optimize the input channel
I set it relatively high for those on a panel
CD with the durable long-life cover
Very similar to no other
I seen a million try to set afloat, thousands that show
Observe with the patience of watching a flower grow
But one individual they forgot to frisk so
Now his pursuit is not without risk
A special no thanks for being flank
While journalists stay runnin in front of tanks
Flew out first class, came back, closed task
Rough path surfaces, no math
Military campaign, bust shots, cause inflammation of the brain
Beat Crazy Eddie insane
Feel the pain, niggas reign

I don't care, G-Unit's going straight to the top this year
Nigga, I'm so fly, I got money
So that's a good enough reason to buy the things I buy

Uh, Banks is fresh out the gutter
Too smooth to stutter
The Sig will melt a brother like two scoops of butter
Before I leave the crib I tell my mother I love her
Grab the burner
But she ain't concerned cause he's a earner
My bitch lays it out real nice for me to murder
We fight, wake up and fuck like Ike and Tina Turner
Its a privilege to ride with a celeb'
Cause them girls over here don't got a problem giving head
Paranoia is on ya', that's why ya' llama's in ya' bed
Fuck a rare Chinchilla, buy some armor for ya' head
Where the block I'm from
Niggas be damn near forty and still tucking
And niggas baby mama's is pregnant and still fucking
It's either cause they boyfriend's a scrub like Brillo
Cause Banks is cooler than the other side of the pillow

Nigga, there's no one out the click that freezes
Believe that, cause I ain't scared of shit but Jesus
Look dog, I don't run with the poodles
Difference is, I'm eating in Rome and you eating Roman Noodles
Ya' boy is corrupt kid
Banks'll send a bitch to the store
Just for a piece of cheesecake like Puff did
You chumps can't afford these homes
Look around, I got forty clones
Now Look down, that's forty stones

All the goodie girls back off us
My hearts colder then Jack Frost is
We pack shows and attract bosses
Black clothes with my black Forces
A black rose for a rat's coffin
I'm blowing O's of that black coughing
Blow on the road then I'm back flossing
No one knows how much that's costing
Fuck ass, only the green moves me
I got a clean Uzi
A pair of gloves and a mask from the Scream movie

We lounge stay phat notice our G limp
A natural flair with our fresh-ass hair
Style baggy out, clout, slick
Creamy and fresh East Coast to West
Brooklyn, making money
Uptown, making money
To the Universal fam, making money
Old school MCs, making money

[Butterfly]
I'm slicker this year, I'm slicker this year
Myrtle Ave, A-train, got the pick in my hair
And what sixteen joints later still lounge
Fresh from Flatbush in my baggy booster Guess
Style is type ease, busted cami fatigues
50,000 leagues of Black, so what's up
Can we avenue slide player style ghetto walk
To the East son, wild Crooklyn, New York
Creamy kids yell Smith and Wesson when I'm blessing
The angular slang blow spots, bang—eleven
Hanging like bats cause the twelve-inch wax
Say ""Scorpio""
And my hair say 'fro
And my blood say 'bro
My clique say, ""a-yo""
Make sparks from the barrel mental pistol
To the depths I dive seems lunar like aqua
The cool blast mega we black we wildflowers
Scott La Rock had 'em all
I gots to ball, and roll with little Panthers through these project halls
The three-color flag can't hold my baggy sag
7-1-8 to Omega
Black motion is ocean style
Slick in my ways since days of deep classics
Now glamor boys want to be triple phatted
But I'm slicker this year
I'm slicker this year

I was raised in the ways of the Manchu Clan
And five elements posture, take a B-boy stance
With the gold front shining, baggy pants sagging
This Brooklyn styling got the fly girls smiling
But I'm climbing, finding new ways of rhyming
Not living like a star, it's strictly bout surviving
Diving, deep into the grooves of the ghetto
This downtown flavor shines from many angles
Yes the notorious, with rhymes so glorious
The Manchu Monkey over flunkies is victorious
Rappers be boring us with rhymes so conventional
Dazed and amazed when they hear the three dimensional
Lyrical skills of the insect in motion
Coasting down Fulton with a bag of magic potion
Now I'm rolling with the seven and the crescents
Puffing some expression
Manifesting today's lessons
Stressing the fact that I'm solar guaranteed to go far
Cause the mind is interstellar
Still peace like that, so have no fear
But I'm slicker this year
I'm slicker this year

Catch me at a hot spot with the dusk daughters
We bouncing, moving within the true circles
We played you, made you change, straight New Yorked you
We stratify our wealth from my Luchi in the bank
There's love amongst the ranks
Now I'm about to beep my homegirl
Cause we be alike
A-alike, C-alike, yes G-alike

Some of 'em lie about the guns they pop

So many niggas wanna play but still got dues to pay
Some of 'em gotta beg a bitch to stay
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't

Fuck it, if my nigga detoxing, it's more for me
Baby this is presidential really, a pocket full of women
Understanding how I'm living, show them hoes how you winning
It's the beginning with the pearls you're given
The world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon
But everyday like 50 say, it's Many Men
They wanna take me out the spot, they want the pussy and the ends
But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs
Then the hoes, then the clothes, I'mma have to let 'em go
You know how the Dogg roll, don't get it twisted
Cause he bang out the East just in case you wanna visit
A touch of the exquisite, mixed with somethin' pimpish
And it's comin' from the Beach where them niggas is a beast
But I just listen, all that shit is in my past
I'm connected to the purse first nigga, the ass last
From Long Beach to Venice is the premise
Want the green like spinach and I'm strong to the finish

But trickin' ain't the route, that's even if you got it
There's a method to you holdin it when they can't do without it
Just put the key up in it nigga if she 'bout it
You can have her and her partner, fuckin' with it for a dolla
If she a baller, she gon' ride with a shot caller
Roll with the Boss Dogg in the back of a blue Impala
And if she follow, then she gon' swallow
All the game you got to give her, be a different bitch tomorrow
But I would never bother breakin' out the Doggfather
'less I knew that she was 'bout him, havin' diamonds on his collar
I'm just an author, spreading game to my partners
Walkin' on the blue carpet with the Doctor

Gettin' blessed on a jet is a way to reflect
Hard work pays off, I'm a boss, you can tell
By the bottles in the pail, and the models that we share
I'm into real estate, in a realer state of mind
We came for trigga' play, kill a nigga for a dime
I'm tryna' chill today, I got a million on my mind
Dice in my hand, one roll, I blow ya mind

Designer jeans and a hand full of dough (Yeah)

Mo' trips, mo' whips, mo' money, I'm mo' rich
Mo' haters, mo' clips, mo' jewels, mo' shit
Half a hundred grand in some rubber bands
Gats all flashed in my other hand
On the other hand, I'm still pitchin' underhand
All softballs, all bases covered man
Mo' trucks, mo' bucks, mo' freaks, mo' butts
I see the vision, from Club Vision to Privé
I get brain, I bust nuts, in each states
Soon as I see what I'm lookin' for
I sit up in that seat and cut em' off on them 24's
There it goes, baby girl come talk wit' tha' boss
I pop a rose bottles, you can kick ya shoes off

Ever seen a fat boy in a big body
Know you wanna see about me, all you do is think bout it
Lease apartments to get kicked out it
Next day, buy a condo to get a kick out it
Mill ticket for the view, this is what I do
When I'm on the beach, all my diamonds salt water blue
So let's party like the pack jam, Pac-Man
Fifty grand, stacked in my lap man
Get a lap dance, and if you get my dick hard
This ya last chance, to up up on that big car
Wit' tha Fat Man, certified Hood Star
But he a millionaire, look bitch you goin' far
This the movement, a few niggas' you wanna move wit'
Gucci on my feet, see I'm only in the new shit
Ha, they say life's a bitch
But close ya eyes for a minute, and just bite this dick, it's Ross

[Chorus]
I was slipping in South West London (Slipping)
No strap, no 'chete, on my ones with the gash (Ones)
I had to splurt from South West London
Wrong place, wrong time
No you can't have a stripe (Listen)

[Verse 1]
Listen
Yo, I'm real, the people know
I go places where you don't go
You can find me in the hood, murking the show
It's all normal, I'm up for making the dough
And if you want to rob me, don't be an amateur
Because if I get away, I'll be back in a mo'
Tell me to convert if you want to
Because I swear the only answer you will hear is: No!
I will return to my country one day
But only when I've got enough dough
I won't get cosy here in England: I'm going back to Trinidad & Tobago
Listen, if I was you I wouldn't watch my dough (Dough)
Because I would never let two pound go (Yo)
And I won't stay around so you can get stripes
You'll see me again, and I'll be on my own
[Chorus]
I was slipping in South West London
No strap, no 'chete, on my ones with the gash
I had to splurt from South West London (London)
Wrong place, wrong time
No you can't have a stripe

[Verse 2]
I'm from the jungle, I won't get lost
I make the flow cold, just like Jack Frost
And I'm the wrong person, you should never cross me
Taking my life, that comes at a cost
I don't stand in your face and floss
I'm easy, I wear a Casio watch
I'm sorry you lost your wifey
She still looks choong with mango lip gloss
Still acting innocent, when you're guilty
Me I still make the beats and they're filthy
Warring MC's everyday, I'm guilty
For the street wars I'm built, they wanna kill me
I react quick though, face any challenger
New to this racket, that's Slazenger
Don't want a manager
Back in the day, I was a scavenger
Street kid Roman Road back to Latimer (Road)
[Chorus]
I was slipping in southwest London
No strap, no 'chete, on my ones with the gash
I had to splurt from southwest London
Wrong place, wrong time no you can't have a stripe
I was slipping in southwest London
No strap, no 'chete, on my ones with the gash
I had to splurt from southwest London
Wrong place, wrong time no you can't have a stripe

[Bridge]
Listen, you wanna know a bit about, falling off? (Falling off?)
I couldn't tell you; because I've never, fallen off
There's the bridge, all you've got to do is: walk across (Walk across)
I'm a wizard, my talent's got no cost

[Verse 3]
You ain't a boss like Wiley
There goes Kylea
Still having beef today, like I'm 19
I know it's my fault partly; I'm too safe
So when you see me in the streets, walk past me
If you've got a question, don't ask me
I've never left the hood
You won't outlast me
As for those who want to bad-mouth me
You know revenge is sweet like candy
Girls make boys turn stupid
Don't be angry, just be even, try to understand me
Because setting me up, is no good
I could have my eyes closed, and I can still see (See)
And you ain't got one over me
Nah, I won't let you run over me
Pull a gun out at me, crews come out for me
I must be someone you all wanna be
I'm a baller from east
Never had a day of peace, where I didn't want to sort out beef
You think that I don't want to get you back, you're wrong, man
My mental state is so street
But I'll just wait until the day I wake up
Come to your house and show you about beef
As a kid I had a knife in a sheath, on a mountain bike shotting weed
No I ain't a chief
[Chorus]
I was slipping in southwest London
No strap, no 'chete, on my ones with the gash
I had to splurt from southwest London
Wrong place, wrong time, no you can't have a stripe
I was slipping in southwest London
No strap, no 'chete, on my ones with the gash
I had to splurt from southwest London
Wrong place, wrong time, no you can't have a stripe"
Back to December,Taylor Swift,"['country', 'pop']","[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time
[Verse 2]
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall

[Pre-Chorus]
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Bridge]
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand
[Chorus]
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
All the time"

Get your big Avias off my mom's table, man

Who come to get you, none, they want guns

Wu roll together as one
I call my brother son 'cause he shine like one, check it

Scriptures hit the body like sawed-off shotty
Like my hair knotty and my nosepiece snotty
Fuck a nigga hottie, that ho pussy probably
Burn like the deserts of Mogabi, for real
Ain't nothing fraudulent here, we pioneer
Commandeer a new frontier, this be the Wu, yeah
36 Chambers of fear, huh, you lost it
Information leaking out your faucets, hmm
Time to forfeit your crown and leave the grounds
There's a new sheriff in town holding it down
It's the two holster, six-shot smoker
Wanted dead or alive, bounty on the poster
Wild in the West, a student of my culture
And life is the test, hold up
Let a nigga catch his breath
I'm still paying dues and the last one is death
Back to the essence with that shit you stressing
This rap profession
Now peep Tical, the son of the Shaolin
Isle, bless my style, criminology pays
The last times and days, Johnny fucking Blaze
[Verse 2: Raekwon]
This goes for niggas who know
Wu will grow like yayo, lay low
Plus cooling in Barbados
Ricans be giving me much shit to touch shit
Stay cool, papa, seen you with enough shit
Back at the lab-a, crack's bagged up
Your niggas act up, what? Blow up they workers if they have to
Señoritas fucking up a storm, buyin' gods margaritas
Sucking his dick up in the whip long
Designed for rhyme crime, nigga, jail time jiggas
Them niggas up in hype Vigors lighting niggas
Silks Wally, wear a Figaro chain, yeah
Jakes beware of black rap millionaires
Rock Airs, leather goose, bears blowing this year
1-800-GAMBINO niggas, yeah

Wu roll together as one (Solid gold throne is shinin')
I call my brother son 'cause he shine like one (Solid gold, check it, son, yo)

[Verse 3: RZA]
Solid gold crown is shining, we're blinding like some diamonds
I'm reclining in the sky on a cloud with silver linings
Double-breasted, bulletproof vested, well protected
The heart, the rib cage, the chest, and solar plexus
Casting stones, cracking two hundred and six bones
And watch your ass get thrown to a sea of fire and brimstone
How dare you approach it with them poems?
The overfiend, light nova beam gleam, show 'em what a soldier mean
The grand exquisite imperial wizard or is it
The RZArector come to pay your ass a visit?
Local biochemical, universal giant, the black general
Licking shots at Davy Crockett on the bicentennial
Happy millennium two thousand
Microchips, two shots of penicillin goes up your adrenaline
Son, it's time for bouting
It's a model you're resembling, the niggas who like following
Trapped inside your projects like a genie inside the bottle and
[Verse 4: Masta Killa]
God stepping forth upon holy ground of the track
It's the sound that surrounds and hurts me like I'm under attack
So I decided to bite down on the mic
So the pain of the track won't deny the fact that I'm the master
For what lurks is an expert that hurts
The individual who tries to visualize under
'Cause I strike like thunder
Niggas couldn't stand my heat, it's unbearable
My wisdom fucks up your respitorial
Systems are fractured by the killer tactics
Style is ragged and thoughts are mad jagged
Enter the entity, my vicinity
Is three hundred and sixty degrees of humidity
Represent the school of hard knocks and Glocks, my
Clan is hostile, got mad moss for blocks, so
Feel the force of impact from the iron side of the gat as I attack the track
From the blind side of the pack, Starks, pass the chrome
Watch a nigga get blown out his motherfuckin' dome-piece
Deceased, laid to rest

[Chorus: Method Man]
Who come to get you, none, they want guns
I be the first to set off shit, last to run
Wu roll together as one
I call my brother son 'cause he shine like one

[Verse 5: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, ayy, yo, I got this under my wing, move, give me room
Holding up your saloon, clean sweep like a broom
Full moons make me howl like a wolf out of breath
Soley on Wu cords y'all heard Genius on Gef
So step back to the lab at high velocity
My team make hand-to-hand sales, we're like a pharmacy
Fuck Geraldo, Pablo's plan bro is Bravo
Goodfellas, we know bestsellers become novels
The man rocking headbands, silk scarves, and jams
Early '80s British Walkers, playboys, mocks, and shams
The laser beam vocalist does well at symphonies
Bad days, watch me snatch ice right outta Tiffany's
Remember them kids that came off with eight million?
Robbed the Brinks and I labelled in royal pavilions
Them flour-heads must have been stupid
Tell me how the fuck black niggas get caught with all that loot, kid?
There's jet money, underground money
Submarines and rings, too bad you fucked up, dummies

You see who's the real motherfuckers
See what you see is you what you see

You're a crossbreed, I'm a knowledge seed
I want action! That's what I need
I never put doubt on my mind
'Cause I know when I touch the mic, it's the rhyme
See murder which is caused
When you fuck with the negative and positive charge
Then they came up out my garage
With the hit that's gonna be large
Tired of sittin' on my fuckin ass
Niggas I know be runnin' around with mad fuckin' cash
Who the fuck wanna be an emcee
If you can't get paid to be a fuckin' emcee?
I came out my momma pussy, I'm on welfare
Twenty-six years old–still on welfare

Every time I get around devils...
Let me calm down, you niggas better start runnin'

You bound to catch AIDS or somethin'
Not sayin I got it, but nigga, if I got it, you got it! What!

Yo, check the bulletproof fly shit, strong like Thai Stick
Then I'll remain to tear your frame while I freaks it
Like some fly new sneaks and shit
Now eat my shit, bitch tried to creep and got hit
Now regulate, and I'll be out to set up a date
Wu-Tang is bangin' like a Ron G tape
RZA pump the shit just like a shotty
Watch me run it like John Gotti
Collidin' on the track like gin and watty
Check the calendar, I warn any challenger
To step up {*whoosh*} feel the blast from the silencer

Move 'em in, move 'em in
Move 'em out, move 'em out
Stick it up {*whip sound*}
Raw hide!

[Verse 4: Method Man]
Comin' soon to a theatre near you, it be the Wu
Yeah, find yourself in the square and see it's true
Actual facts to snack on and chew
My positive energy sounds peace to you
A wise man killed one horse and made glue
Wicked women puttin' period blood in stew
Don't that make the stew witches brew?
I fear for the eighty-five that don't got a clue
How could he know what the fuck he never knew?
God-Cypher-Divine come to show and come to prove
A mystery god that's the work of Yacub
The Holy Ghost got you scared to death, kid, BOO!

Yeah, we always gotta keep it fly
Fly for you to feel what you wants to feel
See Wu-Tang'd like to thank, all the people across the country
All the people in America, all the people outside of America

Set the stage, preferably night-times
Daylight reserved for research and writin' rhymes
Things is harder than the tarnish on the garnets
In his gold teeth to eat, goshdarn it, V hold heat
Goin' all out to the fullest, all dipped
Chrome four-fiddith, no bullets no clip
Black electric tape over the hole in the handle
If you hold it right and hit 'em with it they can't tell
But still, you gotta be careful
Dudes be so scared, they cop pleas by the ear-full
V' personal fave is  ""Please don't kill me""
Empty out your pockets and he probably won't, willy
But if you don't hurry up and shut up, I'll kill you
Now lay down and count to a hundred loud, will you?
When the nickel gleam like it's greased up
Thugs turn to icicles, hard rocks freezed up
This could all be a distraction just to buy time to blast you
So keep something to cut in case you has to
If he was on the island, he'd probably rob a millionaire
And be known for wildin' out like Bob Dylan's hair
These clever war tips
You won't get from cats who never wore skips
Now, let's get down to brass tacks
Follow procedure and count stacks like NASDAQ
*snoring* Don't be caught snoozin'
In the early morning hours from a long night of boozing
Stick 'em up, chump, you know what this is
Do the right thing, you might live to see your kids
All he said was, ""C'mon, don't shoot!""
So shook, I think he shit his Sean John suit
Why you starin'? (Huh?) Run your chain like an errand
And your girl's earrings (Oh shit), and what you wearin'
Survival tactics for when things get too gritty
He feels it's his duty to the people of the city
Just so long as nobody get hurt
It keep your average civilian on point and alert
And don't forget to check her D-cup
Now I bust how he got this duck for his re-up
Then he's back on the bricks, smokin' indo'
Never let a handy fiend fix your broken window
Oh, wanna hate the witty lurker?
Who follow y'all on the late, dressed like a city worker
OK, miss, come up off that bracelet
Just got your hair did, don't make me waste it
So, go to Hades, get the Devil for his stash
But no old ladies unless you're sure they carry mad cash
Like the one from the liquor store
He watched her for weeks now, ready for the quick score
Before he told her, ""Whore, get on the floor""
She pulled out and let off like Quick Draw McGraw (Oh, shit!)
Damn yo, he lucky, she barely nicked the camo
He would've let her have it if he had the ammo
It's all in good fun, true, moral of the story son duke:
Senior citizens'll bust they guns too!"
Heart on a Record,Bornfree,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","I must feel it in my heart wanting properly convey it
Otherwise, I might as well choose to write it, buy it or say it
But something has possessed to express this sentiment
In what I feel is the most intimate canvas I can depict it in
I wouldn’t write you a letter ‘cause ink and page ain’t forever
I couldn’t buy you a gift I wouldn’t think another one could better
I could tell you how I feel and baby you know I’d keep it real but
Nothing compares to putting my heart on a record

If I could crack open my chest and drop the needle in
I’d share with you so powerful a musical as to make your heart believe again
Bleeding ventricles incised by the styli on my polyvinyl myogenic muscular organ
Singing its feelings for you
In an unfaltering tongue
The melodies released from my thoracic cavity could never come from lungs alone
Hold on, don’t let me build a head of steam
Because how much you mean to me can’t be convened
In this or any medium for that matter. I had a crush on you
Ground that into powder, some flowers sprouted and suddenly I see loving you
Potentially. Not simply because you mutually feel me
But it’s only in your iris that I find myself completely
Captivated beyond a means of escape
Lids tightened around me in your dreams please baby never awake
And if it’s fate that ultimately brought us together
Consider everything I say today my acceptance letter into the U of U&I
(chorus)

I don’t think you fully comprehend exactly what it is that you’ve done to me
So allow me to break it down while I still have you here in front of me
I’m stunting if I claim being my lady is a big deal because
Being real, I don’t have much to live for other than the thrill
Creating music brings a broken soul
Truth is, I been a fuck-up but I luck up sometimes and strike gold
I fold before see my hand and usually end up crapping out
I’m a high card but with you I stumbled into a full house
Now, like I said before, music is my baby, true
But how honored would you feel knowing I named my firstborn son after you
That’s exactly what I’ve done metaphorically more or less;
I guess that’s the best I can front for the time being
Yes, I intend to be better prospect in the future
And I’m sure there thoroughbreds out there now that have a whole lot more to suit you
But I come before you humbly and present to you
Not something worth a large amount of money but enough of me to dedicate to everything I love in you

(chorus)

So here we stand in this motionless gesture
Carried by the whispers of the last remnants of music escaping from the orifice in my chest
And you’re beset with all I’ve given so far
That’s understandable, I’m sure you’re more used to diamonds than hearts
Queen. I mean, I just don’t run around proclaiming adorations
Basically I tend to stay in most important obligations
Until now, caking hadn’t been one
Relationships weren’t my style until I stood in a mirror and saw me in one
Hallucinating harder than any green I’ve ever smoked lowkey
I felt this happening before you came to know me
I’d scratched in your initials long before you chose to approach me and I hope we share a similar sentiment
Intimacy is imminent
If you accept what I’ve unearthed from inside me
I’ve taken all this effort in the hopes that you’d oblige me
You should find me in your heart from now until infinity
Because even if you decline you still got the best you could get from me"

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, yeah, I'm a terrorist threat, burn in Hell where the devil is kept
How can we be powerful with incredible debt?
Dump the clip, hittin' you from your head to your neck
I creep with the silencer, leave you dead where you slept
I'm as vicious with the right or the left
And I stand behind my people if it's life or it's death
A knife in the chest, that's the way that we do
But if I was you, I'd be concerned about the avian flu
I pray that you do, but you ain't listen before
You ain't listen when I told you 'bout my visions of war
My system is pure, trap you like a prisoner's war
Anyone who ever met me say my liver is poor
Whoever met me say they dig my rapport
Say that he the only one who ain't a dick on the tour
Kick in the door, with my vodka, believe that
And hand Warchild all the blunts and the weed sack
Fuckin' worm, yeah
[Hook-Vocal samples]

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, you like Napoleon Bonaparte
I throw a dart and blow your bones apart
The lonely part's when you fallin' like you Owen Hart
My fuckin' soul is dark, I wouldn't wish it on you
I wouldn't wish any of my mental conditions on you
I just wish that y'all would leave me for dead
Wish that I would go away and fall asleep in my bed
I'm lethal instead, but I supposedly thrived
Anyone or anything that got too close to me died
Supposed to be live, fuck it, I'm supposed to be king
'Pose to murder everything like an associate of Ming
Listen, I ain't takin' your word, man
Just give me all the ""Cash Money"" like Birdman

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, another holy verse, never listen to what's told in church
My soul immersed in a statue that's as old as earth
I'm fuckin' Odin's curse, the living eight man
Calculate Infinity with Dillinger Escape Plan
I would walk on the Arabian with grey sand
And heal the sickness of the people where I laid hands
I was there when they created the Christ
When the Romans in Judea took the Pagan's advice
I hate what I'm like, hate that I'm afraid of the light
Hate that everyone who love me always hate what I like
Hate that everywhere I go, I get engaged in a fight
Hate that everything I say is just evasive and trife
Enraged with a knife, I don't care who I slice
I could walk into the woods and kill a bear with my mic
I'm here with my mic, fear me and be careful at night
Cause Vinnie vicious like a motherfucking werewolf at night
I'm a beast, baby

Tie My Hands,Lil Wayne,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Robin Thicke]

[Intro: Robin Thicke]
We are at war with the universe
The sky is falling and the only thing that can save us now
Is sensitivity and compassion
Da da da, da-da-da, da da da
Da da da, da-da-da, da da da, ooohh
But I know one thing's for sure
I'm gonna get my kicks before it all burns down

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, some say tragedy's hard to get over
But sometimes that tragedy means it's over
Soldier, from the academy league of rollers
I deny being down though they seem to hold us
My shoulders are strong, I prove 'em wrong
I ain't doing nothing but moving on, let the truth be known
But they talked that freedom at us
And didn't even leave a ladder, damn
[Verse 2: Robin Thicke]
I work at the corner store
We all got problems, problems
No one's gonna fly down low
No one's gonna save us now
How you feel you're not alone
We're all just jealous, jealous
We don't reach the sky no more
We just can't overcome, no

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
What have I done so bad? What is my destiny?
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?
What have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I, knock on the door, hope isn't home
Fate's not around, the luck's all gone
Don't ask me what's wrong, ask me what's right
And I'mma tell you what's life, and did you know
I lost everything? But I ain't the only one
First came the hurricane, then the morning sun
Excuse me if I'm on one
And don't trip if I light one, I walk a tight one
They tryna tell me keep my eyes open
My whole city underwater, some people still floating
And they wonder why black people still voting
Cause your president still choking
Take away the football team, the basketball team
And all we got is me to represent New Orleans, shit
No governor, no help from the mayor
Just a steady beating heart and a wish and a prayer
Let's pray
[Verse 4: Robin Thicke]
These friends they come and go
But I got family, family
These kids so fast they grow
They learn so quickly now
That there's nowhere to go
That there's no future, future
Don't make this here so low
And we can't overcome, no

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
What have I done so bad? What is my destiny?
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?
What have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, and if you come from under that water then there's fresh air
Just breathe, baby, God's got a blessing to spare
Yes, I know the process is so much stress
But it's the progress that feels the best
Cause I came from the projects straight to success, and you're next
So try, they can't steal your pride, it's inside
Then find it and keep on grinding
Cause in every dark cloud, there's a silver lining, I know
[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
See right now we just riding on love
A shot in the dark
We ain't tryin to do nothing but hit the heart
We need love
That's all y'all, that's all

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
What have I done so bad? What is my destiny?
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?
What have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?
You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
What have I done so bad? What is my destiny?
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?
What have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, born right here in the USA
But due to tragedy looked on by the whole world as a refugee
So accept my emotion
Do not take it as an offensive gesture
It's just the epitome of my soul and I must be me
We got spirit y'all, we got spirit
We got soul y'all, we got soul
They don't want us to see, but we already know"

Unthinkable Remix Lloyd Banks,Alicia Keys,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Lloyd Banks]
Huh, you wondering how everything would look
If we do things our way, don't bother to read the book
Cause everything about you right, but I’ll be wrong
Know I’ll be dipping back and forth still stringing your heart along
New perspective,same song, yet I can’t help but have you
Grab the love right out of you, and turn right around to stab you
Cause I’ve been stabbed too, crossed more than box cut feeling buried
Deep in a box that I keep locked up. Shady past but you can brighten up my view
Cause when I’m standing next to you. Ain’t nothing I can’t do but
You deserve to have me with you like you with me
Through thick and thin ?
Six feet, more than loyal ?
Heard a couple about you too, but I ain't flipping out on you
Never mind the jealous focus on what we do
Through tall waters, you're the mask I breathe through, I need you

[Verse One - Alicia Keys]
Moment of honesty
Someones gotta take the lead tonight
Whose it gonna be?
I’m gonna sit right here
And tell u while it comes to me
If u have something to say
U should say it right now (you should say it right now) (are you ready)
U give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it (let it go)
Its become something that’s impossible to ignore
And I can’t take it

I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable will it make us look crazy (crazy)
If you ask me I’m ready
If you ask me I’m ready

[Verse - Two - Alicia Keys]
I know u said to me
“This is exactly how it should feel when its meant to be”
Time is only wasting so why wait for eventually
If we gonna do something about it
We should do it right now (we should do it right now)

U give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
Its become something that’s impossible to ignore
Its what we make it

[Hook - Alicia Keys]
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable will it make us look crazy
Or would it be so beautiful either way I’m sayin
If you ask me I’m ready
If you ask me I’m ready
[Bridge - Alicia Keys]
Why give up before we try
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away
I can’t say I can’t compare
I’m suspended it the air
Won’t u come be in the sky with me

I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby

It's no wonder why they call you 9th Wonder man
I understand clearly
It's NC to CA. Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah. Wu-Tang
This right here, I'm takin' it back with this one right here
Of course got to. Feel like 36 Chambers all over again
It's Bishop man. The game is so empty right now
Oh yeah. Everybody on that glamor and glitz
Empty ass fake rap shit
Everybody talkin' bout how much they love the game
They really just love the fame. They bout the money
Only giving praises to God in they speeches when they gettin' rewards
Now that shit ain't right. You know

[Hook]
When you make it to the top
Got the chickens on your jock
E'rybody always say they ""love you""
But when your next album flop and you 'bout to get dropped
That's when you find out they don't really ""love you""
Rappers talk about stacks in they hoods in they raps
But they don't give back, they don't ""love you""
Got a thug in your life, beat you up every night
God damn boo, he don't really ""love you""
[Verse 1: Bishop Lamont]
When I ride in my ride I don't listen to the radio
Cause niggas spit that same ole', same ole', lazy flow
Ever since T.I., everybody samples Jay-Z's flow
Like swell, awe hell, he might as well direct the video
And when you go to pose, you might as well yell ""Hov""
Borrow some of his clothes and borrow some of his flows
These albums should come with pillows cause all I do is doze
I be sleepin' cause wack niggas ain't reachin'
Me with what they speakin'
Nigga I ain't preachin' (naw)
I'm just talkin' shit
Cause nigga I'm pissed
I miss that Artifacts, Tribe Called and Boot Camp Clik
That Black Sheep, Camp Lo and Souls Of Mis
That Pharcyde and Freestyle Fellowship (what up P?)
The U.M.C.'s ""Blue Cheese"", niggas that was the shit
Boogiemonsters, X-Clan, boy how could I forget?
Man, this rap now-a-days be on some real bullshit

[Verse 2: Pr1me]
I hit 'em with a stiff hard and stiff dick
And you can never play and old dog with new tricks
You stink like Nesquick, you never had a chance
I wrote the circumstance
Had you glancin' my advance
Knew how to sing and dance
The way I'm feelin' relationships are feather weight
So ""Where Is The Love"" like Will.I.am and Timberlake?
Allow me to demonstrate, can never calculate what we create
Keep me here forever, let me elaborate
To jackin' the Coke
Push man was set on the dope
Temp rhymin' fresh on the stove
When they was doubtin' the flow
You bitches wasn't try to holler, you was glad I was broke
Until you heard my pen was deadlier than second hand smoke
Uh
And momma said I need a job with the union
Now I'm famous
Performin' at my family reunions, what an anus
So hanis like I'm high off drugs
If this fame wasn't here would I still feel the love?

[Verse 3: Indef]
Yeah, uh
Bastard son as I chase no love
I found music
When KRS was in the Bronx sellin' drugs
Before extravagant tattoo's and dubs
Fake niggas
Overflow with thick hoes and pro clubs
The fascination of crack I rap fucked up
13 year old girls wantin' they tits touched up
The image of perfection got pressure on young
And can't say they time tables, know how to load a gun
Know how to run from reality and one time
Scene so familiar like the generation befo' mine
Strays be hittin' babies, before Columbine
Lunch line, I used to hit the? with a rusty nine
So I could slip home in one piece
My grand momma loves me and trust me kids it's lovely
I guess now more than ever, brought me to this
War dog, new west, so children follow this

You Cant Stop the Prophet,Jeru the Damaja,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Ohhh! Yo look towards the darkness
Nah nah yo, look towards the light
Yo what! Oh what the—? Yo, what is that?
It's a supernova
Nah nah man, that's a black hole
Yo! Yo!
Yo!
Yo it's... It's! It's!?

[Verse 1: The Prophet]
I leap over lies in a single bound (who are you?)
The Black Prophet
One day I got struck by Knowledge of Self
It gave me super-scientifical powers
Now I run through the ghetto
Battlin' my archnemesis Mr. Ignorance
He's been tryin' to take me out since the days of my youth
He feared this day would come
I'm hot on his trail, but sometimes he slips away
Because he has an army, they always give me trouble
Mainly - Hatred, Jealousy and Envy, they attack me
They think they got me
But I use my super-science and I twist all three
I see sparks over that buildin' - they're shootin' at me
I dip, do a backflip
Then I hit 'em in the heart with sharp steel bookmarks
Ignorance hates when I drop it
But no matter what he do he can't stop the Prophet
[Deceit]
Yo Prophet, yo Prophet, come here real quick
Yo, I just saw Ignorance downtown, let me put you on

[Girl #2]
Word, he down there buggin'
He got them illin' out, they shootin' and everything else

[Verse 2: The Prophet]
Let's continue the saga, mad mad drama
I met this chick, she said she knew where Ignorance was at
I said ""Where?""
She said, ""Downtown""
He had babies havin' babies - and young niggas sellin' crack
I think the bitch is lyin', it's a set up
I can smell it, but Ignorance is runnin' rampant
Aight baby show me the exact spot
Meet me at Hoyt and Schermerhorn at 3 on the dot
So I hops up on the A-Train, I'm bein' followed
My seventh sense senses danger
I turn around, it's Anger
And he brought a mob along, it's the same old song
Despair and Animosity got broke with the swiftness
I don't know what they think this is
I feel a sharp pain in my neck
Now I can't see, I'm like Hiram
They hit me with the dart filled with the pork chop serum
I tried to hold on but before long I dropped
When I awoke I was locked in the barber's shop
Trapped in the barber's chair
Oh no, they're gonna try and cut my hair
But that can't stop the Prophet
[Anger]
Yo Prophet!
Ignorance is tired of you followin' him around
We about to put an end to that right now
Animosity (yeah!), Despair (yo what's up?), get him!

Can't a damn thing stop me
Can't—can't a damn thing stop me
Can't—can't a damn thing—
Can't a damn thing stop me

[Verse 3: The Prophet]
A few minutes passed by, I hear a buzzin' noise
It was that chick with some of Ignorance's boys
She said, ""Prophet, we got you beat;
By the way I'm Mr. Ignorance's wife: Deceit
But enough talk; now for your hair cut""
When the clippers touched my hair, they blew the fuck up
After the explosion there was no one left
'Cause I know Dim Mak/poison hand/touch of death
My vision's still kinda blurry, but I see a clue
Ignorance is at the library
I hurry with lightning speed like The Flash
He's at the big one on Grand Army Plaz'
When I get inside the doors shut and the lights go off
Damn, another trap
I hear a hissin' sound, I smell a funny smell
I gasp, I can't breathe
Ignorance is laughin' at me
Waitin' on my downfall, but he can't stop the Prophet
[Outro: Mr. Ignorance]
Well Prophet
It seems like you're in a bit of a jam
I hope you can unstick yourself
Oh, and what you did to my wife, it was nothing, I have others
Hahahahahaha... hahahahaha... hahahahaha... hahahahahah
The saga continues"

3, 3, 3, D-P 3

[Verse 1]
While others spit that Wonderama shit
Me and my conglomerate
Same crime, bigger trial, Your Honor suck a dick
Let me, live out my dreams until my heart give out
Involved with cream, you know exactly what this is about
Fuck y'all mean, handlin' since a teen
Like LeBron or Sebastian, high school graduates
Straight to the league, I ain't waitin' for my knee to blow
Yesterday I was needin' this dough
Get it? I was kneadin' this dough
Long as your math is fast, if your readin' is slow
Yo, my life ain't rosy but I roll with it
My mind was fine 'til the dough hit it
Then told me that the Mo' did it
And now it's Kosher, shit is so Hasidic
I blow a digit on the diamond at San Tropé visits
And won't miss it, so don't twist it
Young is just as nice and more risks than '96, KID
[Chorus]
D-P 3, YES!
Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
Jacksons go back then we cop us some mo'
The Benjamins go in the stash box under the floor
I'm out for presidents to represent me, now you know
D-P 3, D-P 3

[Verse 2]
My boy Sig said
He was on a tier where no tears can fall
'Cause he was on the block where no squares get off
See in my inner circle, all we do is ball
'Til we all got triangles on our wall
Ain't just rapping for the platinum, y'all record
I recall, 'cause I've really been there before
Never far behind, 'cause I think too forward
All about the grind like me so horny
Warned you early on about my mindset
You thought it was an empty bomb threat
'Til I flew into the building like 100 Osamas
Said to do a few millions
Expose the world to a hustler's true feelings
I came into this game with nothing to prove
You'll never stop a nigga in that type of mood
So every move I make confuse the industry
I'm out for presidents to represent me
D-P 3
[Chorus]
D-P 3
Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
Jacksons go back then we cop us some mo'

Slow Down,Chiddy Bang,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Yeah

[Verse 1: Chiddy]
Hey, I’m the man, right? So I think I’m gon’ live it
Since my mother birthed me I have only been exquisite
And I was on the grind while you was gettin’ the digits
Got this down to a science, you would swear I’m livin’ physics
But my life is different, what good is the success?
If the happiness is missin’, 3:30 I am dismissin’
Any competition, cause I gotta eat
You show me a rapper, that’s someone I gotta beat
And most people red-shirt, because they cannot compete
Think and my wing span says anything’s in my reach
When Atlanta was poppin’ BMF with Big Meech
I was stuck in the school, I was more that they could teach
But slow and steady wins the race, thought I was hare
But I’m movin’ at a tortoise pace, and that’s what I prefer
So get a cup and mix it up, and let it go down, I know now
That life feels better when you slow down

[Hook: elDee the Don]
Slow down
Man I gotta slow down
There’s way to many friends that gossip will go round
Wish I woulda knew then what I know now
But for now, life feels better when it’s slowed down
Man I gotta slow down
There’s way to many friends that gossip will go round
Wish I woulda knew then what I know now
But for now, life feels better when it’s slowed down
[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Uh, I know it now, wish I knew it then
Diminished returns, I burned through a few of them
Remember when I was in a position you were in
Shit'd be different if I had it all to do again
Oh, to be new again, young upstart
From the rough part, tryna make his dreams come true again
I watched gold disappear while pursuin’ it
Seen cats capture the flag, then let it ruin them
A grasshopper tryna learn kung fu again
It’s deja-vu livin’ shit I been through again
A little word from the wise, remain true within
This is from a boss, look at where the Root’s crew has been
Yeah it’s true I got the soul of an old town
And real talk, that what come around go around
Before the drama get to large to hold down
It’s in your best interest to try to slow it down

[Chorus]
.

[Verse 3: Chiddy]
Hey I’m sorry I took long, you probably could swell me sooner
And let me take the time out to dispel the rumors
Chiddy Bang still here
Keep it rollin’ like a victim in a wheel chair
I’m tired of everybody that be gossipin’
They want to know if we making what we be profitin’
Snoop Dogg, nowadays I sip a lot of gin
And at this altitude I’m kinda low on oxygen
Maybe I need to breathe, it’s all or nothing when you’re nothing at all
That’s the reason I’m so excessive when I’m up in the mall
Why’s it takin so long? I got cribs to get
And don’t I lay my plot down like arithmetic
Uh, I said I done it here and south mon is here
I was born to do this you don’t need to check my Punnett square
So get a blunt of what you want and let it go round
And know now that life feels better when it’s slowed down
[Hook]

[Bridge: Chiddy]
And I’mma make it to the stars with the bars
Yellow brick road, my life the Wizard of the Oz
I know gettin’ that job is always gonna be hard
But for now, we gonna plot to take over the world
And I’mma make it to the stars with the bars
Yellow brick road, my life the Wizard of the Oz
I know gettin’ that job is always gonna be hard
But for now

Get Up In The Morning,Chiddy Bang,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Chiddy: Yo what up?
Friend: Chiddy Bang, how you doin’?
Chiddy: Chillin’ man, chillin’, sleepin all day
Friend: (Laughs) Wake up man, we got some shit to do, I got a meeting set up here in New York, so gotta get on that bus. Get up here
Chiddy: Alright, I’m comin’, I’m comin’ right now
Friend: You good?
Chiddy: Yea, I got it
Friend: Aight man, I’ll see you in a little bit
Chiddy: Aight homie

[Verse 1: Chiddy Bang]
Get up in the morning like don’t you feel the power?
Stand up and stretch together and by the hour
I devour a beat, now the rap game ours
Fresh and so clean, be making raps in the shower
Yeah, then I hit the boy Xaphoon
He tell me, “Pro, you don’t know I’m making mad tunes?”
And they wonder why we modest I assume
I remember we recorded in a closet for our room
Now I’m grinding, oh yeah this is perfect timing
We machine, not hype, they figure we may be climbing
But like a punishment, gotta be grounded
I get up in New York, my parents are so astounded
Get up in the morning, and then I hit up Ant
Anything you can accomplish, man, she’ll never say “can’t”
And I got the drive, my 9-5
They kill your dreams but you gotta keep the grinds alive
[Hook: Desmond Dekker]
Get up in the morning, slaving for bread, sir
So that every mouth can be fed
Poor me, the Israelite
Get up in the morning, slaving for bread, sir
So that every mouth can be fed
Poor me, the Israelite

[Verse 2: Chiddy Bang]
Yea, hey yo, I get up, after that I get it all lit up
Feel I got next might as well be playing pick up
When I get up in the morning, see my shortie might be calling
The Man on the Moon, got a buzz like Aldrin
Trust me those records so connected like the cable is
Check it the record, keep it Epic like the label is
They heard your beat in Germany, what can you do?
And when I’m getting up, that’s night time for you
Right I’m the glue, that mean I got that really sticky
Now we be bringing quarters back I got that really Vicky
She thinks she’s really with me, but she ain’t really with me
Ryan Howard with sour I got the Phillies with me
Never abandon him, old war tactics, bring a cannon in
Rap is at a stand still, mannequin
Cool on the floor, born a persona
If that is the kicks, trust me I’m preferably store owner
When I get up
[Hook: Desmond Dekker]
Get up in the morning, slaving for bread, sir
So that every mouth can be fed
Poor me, the Israelite
Get up in the morning, slaving for bread, sir
So that every mouth can be fed
Poor me, the Israelite"

I mean I hope somebody out there can hear this right here
Just listen

You're gonna drive me crazy (Don't do that)
You're gonna drive me mad (Don't do that)
Better things are coming
I said there's truth in that

[Verse 1]
Ayo, it's better things, can you hear 'em sing?
Ain't this like a celebration?
Switch gears to the top we steer
Notice my acceleration
I do it for the have-nots
For the boy playing ball on the block
Xaphoon told me that this was the shot
So I stopped skipping math, but I came with a plot
Plot, I've prolly moved onto my next axis
And if she calling, I don't care 'bout what my ex asks
Why? 'Cause I'm in a lab like Bill Nye the Science Guy
Flyer than fly, I could jump over top of the Empire State Building, just glide

You're gonna drive me crazy (Don't do that)
You're gonna drive me mad (Don't do that)
Better things are coming
I said there's truth in that

Harder to fail, you see a train
Don't be the fool that jumps on the rail
High on the scale, if I nail, girl say
That I am well-endowed like Harvard and Yale
Ladies' man, Jesse Katsopolis
I'm getting shows booked, I'll be the novelist
Superman, metropolis, I profit off my topic pics
Periodically, I'm in my element, Phosphorus
I'm prosperous
Say we loud and too rockerish
Pro, how long are you locked in this?

PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT:
Welcome to the New York Port Authority. Exits are in the back, on the left and right

[Hook: Chiddy Bang]
You know me, I’m a upscale character
Haters, we ain’t mad at ya
To the penthouse we go
It’s time to grind now, so we gotta shine now
Never take a time out
Leave ‘em in the danger zone
You know me, I’m a upscale character
There is not a challenger
To the front page we go
It’s time to grind now, so we gotta shine now
Never take a time out
Now you’re in the danger zone

[Verse 1: Chiddy Bang]
They in the danger zone
I’m in a major zone
They stereotype me
They thought my name Jerome
Because my skin is dark, I witness art
Watch me as I come up from the bottom
And ascend the charts, and then I spark
I play this right
Fork in the road, I made a right
Try to take off while them haters just delay the flight
I know you watchin’ me
Them other boys sloppy
My flow is dead on
Now where’s the autopsy?
Whores watch me, say hello to my stainless
Got my hand in the cookie jar, visions of being famous, I’m saying
[Hook: Chiddy Bang]
You know me, I’m a upscale character
Haters, we ain’t mad at ya
To the penthouse we go
It’s time to grind now, so we gotta shine now

You know me, I’m a upscale character
There is not a challenger
To the front page we go
It’s time to grind now, so we gotta shine now
Never take a time out
Now you’re in the danger zone

[Verse 2: Chiddy Bang]
Yeah, my composition is remarkable
I am a molecule
They are just a particle
And this a article
So you can read all about it
And are they messing with us? I doubt it
The road less traveled
I’m sorry I’ll reroute it
And this goes out to everyone
That shot me down and doubted
Now I’m cumulusly clouded
Serious, higher than a Nimbus
I swear, I’m on the scene like forensics
Just check the stylo
We know heat flow
Them A&Rs tryin’ to find me like Nemo, I mean it

[Hook: Chiddy Bang]
You know me, I’m a upscale character
Haters, we ain’t mad at ya
To the penthouse we go
It’s time to grind now, so we gotta shine now
Never take a time out
Leave ‘em in the danger zone
You know me, I’m a upscale character
There is not a challenger

Now U Know,Chiddy Bang,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]:
We gettin’ busy in the city
Lights look bright and the scenery is pretty
Tell Memphis I’m on my Grizzly, Bear
My mixtape droppin’ in two weeks
We get ‘em sent to us, you coppin’ them new sneaks
So exclusive, I used to think the game was so elusive
Now they feel me like masseuses, I author it, Dr. Seuss it
You win some, you lose, that’s the game for you
The truth hurts, all I did was ease the pain for you
And Chiddy, could you please give ‘em illness?
I’m on the couch, interviewing Dr. Phil shit
It’s the danger zone, I gotta hit the kill switch
On this Pursuit Of Happyness, I play Will Smith
Or Cudi, my MGMT, so good that Gabe Saporta is my buddy
And me on the pad is your doom
This is a big city, let the madness resume

[Hook]:
And we go on and on
We gon’ keep gettin’ til the gettin’ is gone
Cheah, yeah, here we go, here we go
And if you don’t know, now you know
And we go on and on
We goin’ keep gettin’ ’til the gettin’ is gone
Hey, here we go, here we go
(And if you don’t know, now you know)

Here we go, here we go, uh, yeah

[Verse 2]:
Uh, adiós to my haters
They tell me that you should always keep ‘em closer than neighbors
And video gamers, they tell me I got next
Paintin’ pictures like your sneakers, there’s nothing I can’t sketch
So colossal, and yeah I’m feeling like Picasso
I say we got that good nose candy for your nostrils
I’m about my Frito Lay
These rappers want to be Hov, they’ll be DOA
And we okay, healthy, but they say I have a sick grind
Prefer the money like my Mac player, QuickTime
Makin’ moves, can’t let the hatin’ scare me
You, on other hand, Hallmark stationary
What you runnin’ fam, you could never understand
I excel in your career and dance do the running man
And to the studio your girl could come
I am fresh off the bus, now I got a world to run

Dream Chasin,Chiddy Bang,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Skit]
""Alright guys, good shit today at the label. I think it went well.""
""Yo, I’m tired as hell.""
""Yeah, well we got a long ass ride home so try to get some sleep on the bus.""
""We’ll try to.""
""We got a show tomorrow so make sure you get that rest, alright? Before you miss that bus, the last one tonight. Try not to sleep at my house.""

[Verse 1]
Ay, check the plans out
We work hard, I ain’t asking for a handout
If I hit the booth, I don’t have to pass the grams out
And be the well when the other thoughts ran out
They say they lost words. I got them puzzled like the crossword
Harvard, I’m nuts, George Washington Carver
But you can never pay a boss peanuts
If it gets messy, be prepared for the cleanup
But this thing called success is so strange
Because you can get notoriety and still ride the train
Make it in its entirety and search for the fame
But I’m still Michael Phelps, swimming in my lane
Where’s Lois? Me, I’m Superman, here to save the day
Or at least I thought I was, till I
Flew in to save her and I met my opponent
I’m fighting with myself, don’t offer the condolence
I’m dreaming
[Hook]
We chasing the dream
So what is life? The diamonds and the gleam
Get a job while I’m doing it, promise to stay true in it
Doing it, but never let another soul ruin it
And things ain’t what it seem
Make money to spend it, I got my scheme
Work hard while we doing it, promise to stay true to it
Doing it, but never let another soul ruin it

[Verse 2]
It's too haunting, the task is daunting
Trying to get the labels on board while flaunting
But let’s make some music, make some money, get the rides
European ties have models for wives
Sometimes I feel fated to pretend
Unsafe, 'cause my crib is far from gated in
I’m a relic, believe slightly the psychedelic
If I could take off, would you consider me angelic?
Hysteric, I’m the subject and the predicate
They hating on me, tell me where’s the etiquette
If you Goliath, I don’t need to prove I’m better than
I play David, I’m a fourth-year letter man
So Letterman, can’t you hear me knocking on the door?
Hard to breathe at this altitude where oxygen is poor
Think Benz, I don’t know what Pontiac means
And this is what happens when an insomniac dreams
[Hook]
We chasing the dream
So what is life? The diamonds and the gleam
Get a job while I’m doing it, promise to stay true in it
Doing it, but never let another soul ruin it
And things ain’t what it seem
Make money to spend it, I got my scheme
Work hard while we doing it, promise to stay true to it
Doing it, but never let another soul ruin it"
Silver Screen,Chiddy Bang,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook/Intro: Joe Strummer]
All your life dreamed a dream
Somehow connected with the silver screen
All your life dreamed a dream
Somehow connected with the silver screen

[Verse 1: Chiddy Bang]
And yeah I’m back on the scene
Making with a dream them haters they gonna scheme
Like, silver screen that’s all I ever dreamt of
And the day I lose, that’ll be the end of
My journey, tryna focus on ambition
Cause other successes do not concern me
But still I Mac like Bernie
I’m in it rappers, they say we can win a tourney
Now I’m drowning in the page
They don’t understand me, they say I’m hard to gage
Still blowin’ up, take the pin off the grenade
You’re frivolous I’m Nicolas rather me in the Cage
Never, these rappers gonna stay in trouble
Get the US Open like we playin doubles
Hustle for the prettiest screen
Make sure you’re wide a wake in the city of dreams
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chiddy Bang]
And this is my soundtrack
Takin’ off, no plan, you can’t ground that
I’m high grade like smokers that don’t do regs
Life’s a movie better hope it ain’t a bootleg
Stay focused, don’t rigmarole
Responsibility you gotta feed the fish in the bowl, uh
Play it humble, really though I seem rash
Thought I’d catch the people back like a Dreamcast
Play the role, get the scene cast
And tomorrow’s always brighter with the green hash
And I’m 20 below
Could make it to the awards with some strummin’ from Joe
They feel it but can’t repeat it so they hummin’ the flow
I’m up-tempo, might as well be drummin’ the show, uh
And I’m blazin’ it right
Think you Swift well I’m Yeezy cause I’m taking the mic
Yeah

Decline,Chiddy Bang,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Introduction]
PSA: Now arriving in Philadelphia, the last stop. Thank you for riding the Swelly Express
Chiddy: Damn, yo I just woke up son. That was the craziest dream ever dawg. Black Thought came through and gave us some advice and got on the track. Some Hollywood shit

[Verse 1]
They waitin’ for that decline
Pray that I lose my mind, they never want me to shine
But I observe that, trouble I will serve that
Ear to the streets, never will I give the curve back
Still movin’ at a velocity
Still sensing the animosity
Hate mail is what they send me
But I separate letters like an apostrophe
Colossally, didn’t come the same must of had two angles
He was isosceles, but now I’m Socrates
With philosophies
I’m in my tree house please don’t bother me
And now it’s lookin’ like hella smoke
Under age they lettin’ me pass the velvet rope
And this life getting reckless
Feeling like a lone star, Texas
[Hook]
Uh huh I know what’s on your mind
You don’t think were gonna shine
I face you to prove you wrong
Thought I was weak I tell you I am getting strong
This time its gonna be different than the last time
I swear I’m gonna turn this from a hobby and a pastime
Tomorrow gonna be better than today (yeah)
This will wash the pain away

[Verse 2]
Could you cheer for me when you see me?
Had to follow my dreams and they cannot believe me
But, you see I need it for the cake I go
Like Today on the TV and the radio
Retro ’80 flow, hood make it crazy though
Puttin’ work with music but the school made me lazy though
Why cause I couldn’t write enough rhymes
They say that hip-hop is dead we bring the vital signs
Never trippin’, I’m on a different grind
Bring slaughter to your houses, a young Nickel-Nine
See, now tell me would ya get me wrong
If I told you in the studio I met Solange?
If I said I command it like its the Pentagon
Hatin’ on even on the roof I’m upper echelon
But still forever we shine
Turn a negative to positive I never decline

All Things Go,Chiddy Bang,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus]
You came to take us, all things go, all things go
To recreate us, all things grow, all things grow
We had our minds set, all things known, all things known
You had to find it, all things go, all things go

[Verse 1]
It started off with a rhyme and a dream
Made it the greatest and the latest, now we fresh on the scene
Got the sample for the kids, won't you ever grow up?
Went to Drexel and had classes, but I never showed up
I was writing all day 'til my hands would hurt
Professors didn't appreciate it, called me a jerk
New boy need to learn, but I never would
Pay attention in school is something that I never could, uh
And Noah, the beat gotta be steamin'
And we could work wonders over logic and reason
We on the hype, now they call it a buzz
And how we get the party poppin', Baltimore club, uh
MySpace they could replay next
And you gotta have Xaph for the DJ set
No matter how they will play us, they can never replace us
And any way you slice it, now homey, they came to take us
[Chorus]
You came to take us, all things go, all things go
To recreate us, all things grow, all things grow
(Ayo Xaphoon, we back son! We did it!)
We had our minds set, all things known, all things known
You had to find it, all things go, all things go

[Verse 2]
Say hello to the game, the people know my name
And do they really love us, or is this just a fling?
And we be Peter Parker in love with the Mary Jane
So many people gone, so many people came, and
This that brand new spontaneous
Dope flow, intravenous, miscellaneous grinding
Better late than never, I'm calling it perfect timing
But we gon' have a little bit of fun, 'cause when it's all done
You throw your sneaks up and call it a good run
I admit that I would never rather them burn me
I don't know where I'm headed but I know it's a journey
And my bags is packed, so can you hand me my itinerary?
I get attention like a soldier in the military
This is what you gotta notice today
We promise to make sure they never throw us away

[Chorus]
You came to take us, all things go, all things go
To recreate us, all things grow, all things grow
We had our minds set, all things known, all things known
You had to find it, all things go, all things go

You came to take us, all things go, all things go
To recreate us, all things grow, all things grow
We had our minds set, all things known, all things known

Punish Me,Big Pun,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Big Pun]
I was the luckiest man on Earth, my wisdom was worth
Any purse but had a curse that hurt worse than giving birth
My first verse explains some of the games she was playing
I'm blaming myself 'cause in my wealth was where her pain would haven
Behaving like a money-hungry hooker, funny how the money took her
From a average honey to a stunning looker
I look back and reminisce how we used to kiss
And smash hips in the GS I bought her last Christ'
She got too big for her britches but The Bridge is Over
Not the one in Queens, I mean the one she dreaming wasn't sober
Told her how I felt, gassed me when she cried for help
Supplied the guilt trip and I was whipped without a fucking belt
I felt stupid Cupid struck me with a poison arrow
Should have drowned you when I found you crushing in my boy's Camaro
I didn't bother but you probably find your lover dead
You robbed me of my honor, you ain't shit like my mother said

[Chorus: Miss Jones]
Come back come back come back come back to me
Punisher punish me
I've been so bad, so bad
Won't you come back, please
[Verse 2: Big Pun]
Nah baby, I'm not gonna be able to do it, you blew it
Threw it all the way 'cause you was stupid, girl why'd you do it?
I mighta knew it by the way you gave me your baby
Then left a day before I ever saw the son that God made me
It's hard maybe we can make amends, be friends
We're only hurting all of us for certain by forsaking him
Just take it in, don't even say a word, observe the way you were
Preserved, these words so you won't play the herb
Ever again, never pretend that he doesn't have a father
I'm always there and you don't wanna bother
I honor my word on my father's grave, guide him through his hardest age
So he can thrive and survive in these modern days
I wanna raise my little man but you keep resisting
I'm insisting you chill for real before you come up missing
Listen, I don't wanna fight I'd rather do what's right
A boy needs a father that's the most important part of his life

[Chorus: Miss Jones]
Come back come back come back come back to me
Punisher punish me
I've been so bad, so bad
Won't you come back (come back baby)
Come back come back come back come back to me
Punisher punish me
I've been so bad, so bad
Won't you come back, please
[Verse 3: Big Pun (Miss Jones)]
I gave you everything, love letters and sweaters with leather seams
Feathered wings and rings with emeralds right out of Geraldine's
Several dreams of cream fulfilled, the green Deville
Cadillac to mack, matter fact redeemed to bill
I mean for real, I ain't playing mami
How you wanna stay Armani fresh, giving the next nigga my punani?
You want me back 'cause he hit it wrong, now you wanna get it on
With the Long Don, word is bond my shit is strong
(Come back) Girl don't even start again, I beg your pardon
And get your hands off my six-button Cardigan
This ain't no love lost between us far as I'm concerned
Please leave, cut that busted weave I've been dying to burn
Go buy a perm, try and earn some respect
It's better to have loved and lost than to live with regret

[Break: Miss Jones]
Come back (come back baby)... to, me
I want you to

[Chorus: Miss Jones]
Come back come back come back come back to me
Punisher punish me
I've been so bad, so bad

I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes

I wanna ah-ah, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I got to kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy

[Verse 1: Trina]
You know what I need
Somebody that who can come li-li-lick the clit (Alright)
And a nigga who ain't thinking 'bout a Trina LP
And I'll make him go and get my shit
We can go from a fly ass jetta to a Coupe De Ville
Hotel tally ho or the Beverly Hill
A real nigga not the run of the mill
Come and spank me and make me shoot to kill
From the kitchen then you can move me
To the jacuzzi and out the booty
Come and do your duty
Me and fat dick Ludacris making us a movie
Bare naked in a bed of cash
Make st-st-sttutter when I bare my ass
Tell your baby momma bye, she a thing of the past
Cause I'm a bad bitch and I'm off the glass (Okay)
Having sex in lil' jets menagé tois
Getting buck wild no matter where we are
Indie 500 in the back of the car
In a dark ass club or on the back of a bar
Never want, never ever wanna leave
Work for me like league overseas
I want a man to fulfill my needs
To keep my body trembling and buckle my knees
[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawnna]
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes

I wanna do it on the canopy
I wanna do it where your girl gon' see, and get mad at me
I want a nigga that'll grab the weave
And turn my eyes Chinese
Tell me baby can you handle me?
I wanna do it all in your mouth
Then I'll pull the ass out
Make it bounce 'til you pass out
Or we can cut up in the grass
And give the neighbors a flash
Can you tell me who the bad motherfucker now?
Said I wanna take-ta-take-take a nigga back to the crib
And I wanna do all the things, do all the things that I never did
Like up on the top-to-top-top of the projects getting head
Or you can find me in a dro-drop-drop-drop on dubs in the candy red
I like a nigga when he face down, mouth wide
Polo down with them blades on the ride
Keepin' the pound with them K's on the side
But it's okay I'm gon break something tonight
Oh see get on your knees
And I'll show you what's my fantasy
Like up in the coupe, coupe
Tell your bitch she ain't gotta be mad at me

But I got to kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy
You gotta li li li lick me from my ass to my clit
Then you gotta su-suck the pussy while I sit on your dick
And I wanna talk some shit while I feel it get stiff
And then ruba-dub on my tits while I nut on your lips nigga

Especially when a bitch get right on the X
Get it, right on X

Bitches go right, Fox right to the left
Nigga can't fuck, burner his chest
36 D's, Prada on the breasts
Baddest, send him home, na na on his breath
How you think a bitch got my rep?
3 Mills, still BK to the death
Still don't give a fuck
Still pose naked
Still specialize in sittin' niggas faces
Pop magnum's by the cases
X5, bitch, still spend big faces
Big frown, brown, hold first places
You know what you can do nigga?
You can li li li lick me from my ass to my clit
And ruba-dub up on my tits while I nu-nut on your lips, fucka

Running my mouth forces on my rhymes jordans my words the top of the line like school for a nerd you heard?
Or about to hear what I got to dish out but in this kitchen I'm the chef my food won't be spit out
It's Good like Meagan quick to the point like a pin ,call me Ray J, I be in a car dashiiiing (kardashian)

I'm just praying that he make it
I know he will
Mistah F.A.B. be in my prayers forever
Nigga, I never die a hater
Start to think about my life and all the time passing
Can't take nothing back so living with it
Feel gifted for the breath that I'm breathing
Living on borrowed time if you need a reason
Niggas say heaven and hell, but I don't believe it
Just believe in spirits
Just believe in breathing
Please help me if I walk the crooked path even
Please help me if I leave when the pastor speaking
Even though I listen to him for the inspiration
I know life real and we separated
But we gotta get together before the game's over
R.I.P all the angels and the fallen soldiers

The mourning process

Cold nights hell feeling like hell in November
Where's my thoughts
I don't remember
Even though I look happy
I'm still a beginner
Even though I pray to God
I'm still a sinner
One day I'll realize that this time is precious
No movie, real life living like I'm Precious
Bad food, bad family
Dealing with depression
A lot of unprotected sex
Didn't learn my lesson
Please just let me
Life with no judgment
Please let me live my life with no fussing
I already think I'mma die from the way I'm living
I'm by myself eating fast food on Thanksgiving
Just a picture of what I'm doing on a daily basis

I know theres nothing more that we can want
But to crawl, but to step, but to fall as one, All and All Together

Dance together, laugh together, unstoppable when we are together
Friends so young we could have bathed together
We played out, we top and tailed together
Riding a bike in the ends, Barking Odeon we snuck in
We took Shayne's car for a day, car came back, no plates
We could kick back in the kitchen, thinkin of ways we could make a killing
Up on a stage at Palace Pavilion
Boys love girls I bust my new riddim'
We were just friends to the death, Share 1 pound, 1 pad, 1 pen
Pick me up in a stolen, this was the friendship that couldn't be broken

My friends don't care
Me and my girl keep beefing
I think were almost there
Till' the end, been a good innings
I wanna be alone, this world I can't live in
Sofa sitting on my own, silent staring at my mobile phone
Should of pressed his name but I don't
Or when it says connecting I'm froze
And were suppose to all be boys, I can't believe it's come to this point
Destroyed
This must get better cos' I'm oh so fed up
We should be all for one all together
We were the 3 Musketeers but better, where did we mess up?
Where did it all go wrong, every other week its the same old song
Gone are the days when we rave just cos', chilling, jokes, laughs, bond
But now its just awkward, keep looking back but I wanna' move forward
Now I move cautious, this is just foolish, we were happy then broke, this is bad fortune

So if you say it's on, then it's on

Bang this in your whips
Platinum-coated Rollie with the chips in the wrists

I dismissed all you chicks
Split six from the four-fifth
Make you dance, ow

Like a penny with a hole in it, y'all just hopeless
And toke this, I ain't lyin'
Niggas trying to knock me off, keep tryin'
All it takes is one phone call to my street team
Promote that ass, like a soundtrack New Jack Ci-tay
Set It Off with the eight-fitay
Y'all missin' the buck, with the fuck
Bump Biggie in the truck and the buck to my thorough bitches
Lemme see ya do the Bankhead if ya richest

To my niggas straight snitches and to them other chicos
Lady pimp ain't havin' that shit
If you ain't got the cash to stash, suck my dick hoes

Lay another finger on this big bad wolf miss lady rap singer
I be the one to blame as the flames keep risin'
To the top and it don't stop

Niggas dicks, stay lifted when they thinkin' of me
Cause the rhythm I kick, puzzle 'em like arithe-ma-tic
Fillin em with, sluggers off the nine milli luger clip
Bitches bust, we just, keep kickin' up dust
And you can spread rumors
Shit is makin' me sicker than head tumors
Humor me, by huggin' me sayin' you lovin' me
Bet ya phony niggas be buggin', I can tell
Cause the thug in me wanna sell drugs and push keys
Need to get me mo' of deez, VV's and M3's
Smoke weed from overseas pimped out styled Rol-eys

Yall Dont Know,Master P,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Master P]
Say brah
In this game called life
It's charces (choices), decisions, and consequences
I decided to change my life, for the better [ya heard me?]
So anybody that's out there seeking conviction
Because of profanity in my music
Then you don't understand me or my people
See my music is about keepin it real
It's about the constant struggles that I been through in the ghetto
So cain't (can't) no man or woman convey the sounds that I make..
It don't get no realer than this

[Hook: 241] - singing while P speaks
Y'all don't know what we goin through (mo' money mo' problems)
Y'all don't know what they put us through (mo' money mo' problems)
Y'all don't know what we goin through (mo' money mo' problems)
Y'all don't know what they put us through

[Master P]
Too many problems I can't sleep, you either strong or you weak
See I was born to be a G, that's why I learned to flip a key
From the cradle to the grave, you either a master or a slave
Now who wanna get paid?  But I'ma a hustler til I'm dead
Fuckin wrong road but it's the right route..
Now picture me with the lights out!
Who can I turn to when time's hard?
Trust in no nigga, put my faith in God
Cause penetentiarIES, stayed packed (stay packed)
Once you on the bus you might not come back
To my homies doin time, keep your head up (head up)
And to my soldiers on the street, don't get fed up (fed up)
Sometime we do bad, but we all in it
You gotta learn to dream, cause there's No Limit, ya heard me?
[Hook]

[Ghetto Commission]
Don't treat me like a disease, cause my skin darker than yers (yours)
And my environment is hostile, nuttin like your suburbs
I'm from the ghetto, home of poverty - drugs and guns
Where hustlers night life for funds but, makin crumbs
In the slums in the street, in the cold in the heat
Rest in peace and then deceased but we still strugglin while you sleep
And the game never change it's still the same since you passed
We get beat and harassed, whenever them blue lights flash

To the little homies in the hood, claimin wards and wearin rags
Tryin to feel a part of a family he never had
And it's sad, I feel his pain, I feel his wants
To avoid bein locked up, there's do's and don'ts

Use your head little soldier, keep the coke out your system
That ? out your veins, that won't do away with the pain
Only prayers will get you through, ain't no use to bein foolish
Ain't got one life to live, so be careful how you use it

[Hook]

[Outro: Master P]
Haha.. the mo' money you make, the mo' problems you gon' have
The mo' people gon' want, the mo' they gon' wanna take it from you
(The mo' they gon' want to STEAL from you)
So keep your eyes open (they might even kill you to get it)
(Can't believe in nobody but God soldiers)
There ain't No Limit, ya heard me?
(Believe.. none of what you hear and half of what you see, huh)
(Picture me ballin.. think they wanna see a ghetto child
Comin out the Callio' project, makin Forbes magazine, Fortune?
Huh, think they wanna see, a ghetto kid like me, make it in the NBA?
Huh, picture me ballin.. uh-huh, picture all of us ballin
Picture the haters fallin though, uh-heh

I hear what you're saying, but yo, this is all love for me, you know?
~No doubt, smoke them cowards, you stillmatic

[Verse]
Ma, I'm sorry who the fuck I am, I can't trust my fans
Out of luck, no constructive plans
My friends stay powdered up, I'm so drunk, can't stand
You said if I would sober up, I'd be a powerful man
Turned out the street life, you prayed I wouldn't
But every church in the world can't save our children
I stayed out late, you heard shots, thought it would be
Your oldest son on the ground dead, but fortunately
Them bullets had some other names on it, the brother was blind
I hit the L, then, we yell out, ""It wasn't my time!""
I loaded up shells, one by one
You smelled blunts from my room door, little Nasir was at war
And little did I care what you saw
Crew deep with a few heat, now it's time we settle the score
But in the projects, I vision Muhammad, in linen garments
Preaching man, woman, and child, the living Prophet
And I'm similar, Nasir Bin Olu Dara Visqu Allah
Fistful of dollars in the dice game, God
The Ice King, God, the Black Christ, elegant stance
Clothes fit me like a crime boss, the medicine man
I see the world collapsing, young pregnancies
Young girls are unfastening their Sasoon jeans, no prophylactic
All this fast shit and fly jewelry, now makes my eyes teary
N.Y. City, grab a hold and ride with me
Rip the Freeway, shoot through Memphis with Money Bags
Stop in Philly, order cheesesteaks and eat Beans fast
And bring it back up top, remove the fake king of New York
You show off, I count dough off when you sample my voice
I rule you—before, you used to rap like the Fu-Schnickens
Nas designed your blueprint, who you kidding?
Is he H to the izz-O, M to the izz-O?
For shizzle, you phony, the rapping version of Sisqo
And that's for certain, you clone me, your wack clothes line
I'd rather Sean John, you bore me with your fake coke rhymes
And those times, they never took place, you liar
Un was your first court case, you had no priors
You master-fabricated stories of streets and sound slick
Have you surrounded, you and the faggots you down with
While they riding Nas, trying to boost their careers
Corny as Cormega, all you hip-hop queers
Since Illmatic, It Was Written, I Am Nastradamus
That's the answers to the puzzle I gave you; now, here's a promise
My next few albums—instead of projects
They'll be a difficult test inside the cover for the mind's optics
Come in my hood, but bring the guns with you, it's dark
Headed through Brooklyn, Queens, Harlem, Staten, and Bronx
Headed through Compton, Oaktown, South Central, and Watts
New Orleans, Mississippi, Chi-town, every block
I'm trying to have my positive ways, I put my rhymes on page
Did crimes and headline on stage
I signed a contract, so here it is, you have it
Street's Disciple, I'm Stillmatic

At the crib I steady stack bills like buffalo
I'm dumb but flow and you planning what I done before
You can't see me, your CD is CB number 4
Shining on my block, catch you and I run it yo (?)
Basically all you wack rappers is who I'm gunning for
India Jones, nice with mine plus the punchline
On the lunch line I munch mines when it's crunch time
Dumb rhymes, flows for days, yes I got several raps
Mixtape was just us but now we work with several cats
I still live off severance cash, self aware and reverent cats
Das Racist is running rap
Run with that or run it back
Run with that or run it back
Run it, run it back

Be celibate, out of his element
Madvillain never forget like a elephant
Any bent 'cept, idle threats all irrelevant
Get your man's wallet, tell him ""found it"", and sell him it
Well writ, as well as well spit for the hell of it
Before the shell hit
Etiquette, spell it
Pumpin dumplins a hundred and sumthin sumthin
Forest Gump chumps get clumps of nuttin' for nuttin'
Tourist, show 'em where the shore is where the shark's at
Hold up, spark that, park rat
Stirred not shaken
Absurd verbs since word to hot bacon
Wrote this rhyme on standard sand paper
Worked out the plan and plot for grand caper
Vil on the cover of Playbill
Grillin' make ya mother say ""Ill, hey will ya!?""
Ten feet at least, the beast may still ya
Yeah I feel ya
Hey, hey what's better than the healer yet worser than tequila?
A money-gettin' nigga that's thirstier than a squealer
I guess you had to be there, there was free beer
Last of the Ansars
On the microphone, cyclone, like Myanmar
Hand in the jar, got stuck, took it
Use the glasses, juxed a pot luck, crooked
Flashed and not lookin'
Four words: Cash on the spot... bookin'

Never too loud for me, too rowdy and too black and too proud to be

[Verse: MF DOOM]
Living off borrowed time, the clock tick faster
That'd be the hour they knock the slick blaster
Dick Dastardly and Muttley with sick laughter
A gun fight and they come to cut the mixmaster
I-C-E cold, nice to be old
Y2G stee twice to threefold
He sold scrolls, lo and behold
Know who's the illest ever like the greatest story told
Keep your glory, gold and glitter
For half, half of his niggas'll take him out the picture
The other half is rich and it don't mean shit-ta
Villain: a mixture between both with a twist of liquor
Chase it with more beer, taste it like truth or dare
When he have the mic, it's like the place get like: ""Aw, yeah!""
It's like they know what's 'bout to happen
Just keep ya eye out, like ""Aye, aye, captain""
Is he still a fly guy clapping if nobody ain't hear it?
And can they testify from in the spirit? (Nah)
In living, the true gods
Giving y'all nothing but the lick like two broads
Got more lyrics than the church got ""Ooh, Lord""s
And he hold the mic and your attention like two swords
Either that or either one with two blades on it
Hey you, don't touch the mic like it's AIDS on it (Yuck)
It's like the end to the means
Fucked type of message that sends to the fiends
That's why he bring his own needles
And get more cheese than Doritos, Cheetos or Fritos
Slip like Freudian
Your first and last step to playing yourself like accordion
[Outro: MF DOOM]
When he at the mic, you don't go next
Leaving pussy cats like why hoes need Kotex
Exercise index, won't need Bowflex
And won't take the one with no skinny legs like Joe Tex"

Lady Killer,Kano,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Kano]
Watch how I steal her heart like and old school villain
Armed robbery slide down from the ceiling
Hand cuff her tie her up by the bed
Strip search her from the toes to the head
And no I ain't keep posing a threat
So you can forget the code word, code red
Shhhh don't tell nobody
'Cos everybody knows in former for dead
Creep in the club jump out of the van
Trap door back door hold up my gang
Looking for a target to swarm on
Get my Jason Bourne on
Your for real I'm for realer
I'm count Drac, you're dinner
Smooth criminal
But more like an 80s thriller 'cos I'm a lady killer

[Hook 1]

[Verse 2: Kano]
I love her like Ackee and hard food
I'm a teachers pet in the classroom
But I still attend detentions in the afternoon
So I can try steal her heart soon
She was like no at first 'till
I made her say oh yes like Churchill
She sends me pictures on the internet
Thats because I got the Lynx effect
She lets me break all the rules
Even let me skip class in the sports hall
I know Asher Roth said he loved college
But boy I love school
'Cos that lesson last week was awfully crazy I wish we taped it
'Coz she taught me things that I never knew and A stared me to 'cos I'm a lady killer
[Hook 2]

[Verse 3: Ghetts]
When I say I'm gonna kill a woman
Ii don't mean it literally
Seven links a week
One a day, I kill them instantly
And ever since 'Sing For Me'
I just told Kano that I've been mass murdering
I take a woman to the highest heights
And if she feels shaken up, tell her ""thats turbulence""
The last man weren't as fly as I
Every time I hit her I'm delivering a dinner
I fill the belly up I'm heading up for the liqueur
Oh my Godzilla were her words for realer
Bigger than your average nigga
'Cos I'm a lady killer"

Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)

This rhyme you digest through the RZA console
Ask why I slam Nine Diagram pole
Raekwon dropped the bomb, Hunchback Notre Dame
Golden Arms is bronze Buddha palm hit Qu'ran
It blows extreme, mainstream be the theme, supreme team
America's Cream Team, redeemed
Vidal Sassoon, chrome tones hear the moans of Al Capone
Gun POW to the dome and split the bone
Wig blown off the ledge by the alleged
Full-fledged, sledge RZA edge
One dose of my feroc' handheld trigger cuts
A capella spitting shell paralyse if you get touched
And critical mic cords, hanging like umbilical
Cords, dope swords, five star general
Raw be the quote rap style sore throat
Through the fully operational, hand held tote, mhm

A hundred thousand times one, snatch up my styles get done
I hold a title, and here's how my belt was won, check it
Slick majestic, broke mics are left infected
Germs start to spread through your crew through lack of effort
You asked for it, shot up the jams like syringes
My technique alone blows doors straight off the hinges
Masked Avenger, I appear to blow your ear like wind
With a freestyle, sharper than the Indian spear
So sit back and let the king explore
Describe me, the kid's nice and he holds swords
And his name, black attack's the nerve like migraines
With more gains than beggars on trains, livid sharp pains
Poisonous Rebel like Deck, you can't destroy this
You get ambushed, skate, try to avoid this
Side effects of hot raps and hot tracks
A duffel bag full of guns son, dipped in black
My culture, glides and attacks you like a vulture
Ghostface in Madison Square is on your poster

Be on the lookout for this mass murderous suspect
That fills more body bags than apartments in projects
And as far as the coroners know
The autopsy show it was a Shaolin blow
Put on by my family brought to the academy
Of the Wu and learnt how to
Fuck up your anatomy steadily, calm and deadly
Spatter-head lyrics I lick through your transmit
MCs submit to the will as I kill your
Juvenile freestyle, civilize the mental
Devils worship this like an icon
Bear-hugging mics with the grips of a python

You heard other raps before but kept waiting
For the Son of Song, I keep dancehalls strong
Beats never worthy of my cause, I prolong
Extravaganza, time sits still
No propaganda, be wary of the skill
As I bring forth the music, make love to your eardrum
Dedicated to rap nigga, beware of the fearsome
Lebanon Don, Malcolm X beat threat
CD massacre, murder to cassette
I blow the shop up, you ain't seen nothing yet
One man ran, tryna get away from it
Put your bifocal on, watch me a-cometh
Into your chamber like Freddy enter dream
Discombumberate your technique and your scheme
Four course applause, like a black dat to dat
You're stuck on stupid like I'm stuck on the map
Nowhere to go except next show bro
Entertaining motherfuckers can't stop O
In battling, you don't want me to start tattling
All up on the stage 'cause y'all snakes keep rattling
Bitch, you ain't got nothing on the rich
Every other day my whole dress code switch
So just in case you wanna clock me like Sherry
All y'all crab bitches ain't got to worry
Can't get a nigga like Don dime a dozen
Even if I'm smoked out I can't be scoped out
I'm too ill, I represent Park Hill
See my face on the twenty dollar bill
Cash it in, and get ten dollars back
The fat LP with Cappachino on the wax
Pass it in your thing, put valve up to twelve
Put all the other LPs back on the shelf
And smoke a blunt and dial 9-1-7
1-6-0-4-9-3-11
And you could get long dick hip-hop affection
I damage any MC who step in my direction
I'm Staten Island best son, fuck what you heard
Niggas still talking that shit is absurd
My repertoire, is U.S.S.R
P.L.O. style got thrown out the car
And ran over by the Method Man Jeep
Divine can't define my style is so deep
Like pussy, my low cut fade stay bushy
Like a porcupine, I part backs like a spine
Gut you like a blunt and reconstruct your design
I know you want to diss me, but I can read your mind
'Cause you weak in the knees like SWV
Tryna get a title like Wu Killa Bee
Kid change your habit, you know I'm friends with the Abbott
Me and RZA rhyme name printed in the tablet
Under vets, we paid our debts for mad years
Hibernate the sound and now we out like bears
In Born Power, born physically, power speaking
The truth in the song be the pro-black teaching"

I remember when the Cubans was first on Broadway
With dark and yellow gold
I was 11 years old
The inspiration was spread out like a blanket, ask em'
My discovery was beyond the pick, the Lee suit, and the afro
Now from the flair jeans on 169th from College
Watching the dude lean on one-seven-o
With a Kangol 'cross America
I saw the hippies cross
By Herc on Technique needles syncopated time was on time
The same time as the Beatles
I was up there watching James Brown's pockets, stuffed with Jolly Ranchers
When the NFL had the Rams in Los Angeles
Charles Finley in Oakland
And my kindergarten moment was the beginning
'Til the Caribbean people came to New York and sheepskin was bought
The wind breaker

The building never fall down
They are the teeth of the town (spacious thoughts)
They crush us up in they grind
The meat and bone of the mind
We gather here on the block (spacious thoughts)
They key broke off in the lock
I'll meet you down at the well
I'll meet you down at the well (spacious thoughts)

My balloon drops down at midnight
Stranglin' the monkey with the hands of a clock
Good can't help but do a little evil
Evil can't help but
Do a little good
Who's that singing in the kitchen by the stove?
All aboard for the night train!
They say the moon, it smells just like a cherry bomb
Come on home
All is forgiven
Everything costs
Deliver us from evil
And carry your own cross

Growing nobody faster than Jesse Owens
With everything I'm seeing and knowing

Next to my man, Lou Man
The cardigan sweaters
The still sell the New Eras now at Jew Man!

Breaking out in a cold sweat

I may wander, bit I am never lost

Rock it 'till it burst clone, just don't curse the throne
Own his own microphone, bring it everywhere he go

Off of two or three Heines, and boy was they fine, G~
One black, one Spanish, one Chinese
It keeps the woody shiny year-round like a pine tree
Don't sign me, I'm about to get a mil' without 'em
Crowd him off the shelf, he's the villain, and what about him?
So, and he's a jerk and you don't know him
Mad how he expand work but won't show 'em
Poor guys, what a sight for old, sore four-eyes
Now hook me with two apple pies and a small fries
All rise, so far odd as a ruple
So raw, break it down and make quadruple
It's crucial, you could see it in his pupil
And this time when he get it he'll waste it on somethin' useful
Like getting juiced off a deuce-deuce of cokey
Keep it low key, known to pull a okey-dokey
Silly Goose, DOOM is too jokey
Damn he could really use a room or a hoe key
Egads, he got enough styles to start three fads
True dat, she bad, I wonder do she come with kneepads
What a call, what a real butterball
Either I get a strike or strike out, gutterball
Rock it like gear for the fall
With knives inside pockets, prepare for the brawl
Yeah y'all you could say its an earful
Beware, do not touch mic, be careful
And just like he said, I could'a told ya

The muscle-bound karate expert concealed a razor edge
Which could lop the head off of a marble statue once propelled
With notorious world takeover schemes and the most magnificent gadgets imaginable
Villains rapidly grew healthy cash flow
It is explained by a more comedic villain, the bald headed DOOM
This villain rose to incredible new heights of money-making, revenge and extortion

I'm telling you"" (aight?)
And the nigga just got moked out like that, man (tch)
That shit fucked me up, man
(That shit fucked a whole lot of niggas up, man)
Yo, man, I loved that nigga O too (say word)
That was my motherfuckin' heart

[Interlude: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Yeah, dedicating this to my nigga O
We miss you, nigga
Going out to all the young niggas that died in the struggle
Word up, shit is real in the field
You know, sparkin' blunts to all you niggas; word up
[Bridge: 112]
Each and every day
Daydreams of how we used to be
See your family
And that baby's lookin' just like you
Why'd you go away?
I've been missin' you lately
Tell me what you're going through, oh yeah

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Uhh, uhh
I remember sellin' three bricks of straight flour
Got my man a beat down to the third power
He didn't care, spent the money in a half hour
Got some fishscale, reigned on competition like a shower
Got the coke cooked up, a crackhead Kevin
In '88, when Kane ruled with ""Half Steppin'""
A .38, a lot of mouth was our only weapon
We was kings 'til the D's crept in
And now I'm missin' him

[Chorus: 112]
Ooh, I'm missin' you (I'm missin' you)
Tell me why the road turns, why it turns
Ooh, I'm missin' you (missin' you)
Nah nah nah nah nah
Oh tell me why why why why
[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Uhh, we work all week, weekends we play the movies
We rocked flattops, our girls rocked doobies
Made a killin', even though the D's knew me
Eventually, you know they try to do me
Fuck it! Fed up, my nigga wanted to take it down South
Sick of cops coming, sick of throwing jacks in his mouth
Gave him half my paper, told 'em ""Go that route!""
Few months, he got his brain blown out, now I'm stressed
His baby's mother, she trippin', blamin' me
And his older brothers understand the game it be
Kinda topsy-turvy; you win some, you lose some
Damn, they lost a brother, they mother lost a son
Fuck, why my nigga couldn't stay in N.Y.?
I'm a thug, but I swear for three days I cried
I, look in the sky and ask God why
Can't look his baby girls in the eye
Damn, I'm missin' him

[Chorus: 112]
Ooh, I'm missin' you (I'm missin' you)
Tell me why the road turns, why it turns
(Tell me, tell me why)
Ooh, I'm missin' you (I'm missin' you)
Nah nah nah nah nah
Oh tell me why why
(Tell me, tell me why) why why
[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
There was this girl around the way that made cats drool
Her name's Drew, played fools out they money in pool
People swore we was fuckin', but we was just cool
She used to hang while I slang my joints after school
She'd watch my bomb, help my moms with the groceries
My little sister, the girl was kinda close to me
A little closer than the average girl's supposed to be
Far from a lover, my girl was jealous of her
Then she started messin' with some major players
Handled keys, niggas called them the Bricklayers
A dread kid, had a baby 'fore that bitch Taya
Found out her baby's father cheating
Now Drew, she gotta slay her
One night, across from the corner store
Taya ran around the block with a chrome four-four
Squeezed all six shots in the passenger door
The dude lived – what my baby had to die for?
I'm missin' her

[Chorus: 112]
Ooh, I'm missin' you (I'm missin' you)
Tell me why the road turns, why it turns
(Tell me, tell me why, ooh)
Ooh, I'm missin' you (I'm missin' you)
Nah nah nah nah nah
Oh tell me why why why why (oh God tell me why)
Ooh, I'm missin' you (tell me, tell me why)
Tell me why the road turns, why it turns (ooh ooh)
Ooh, I'm missin' you (missin' you)
Nah nah nah nah nah
Oh tell me why why why why
Ooh, I'm missin' you
Tell me why the road turns, why it turns
Ooh, I'm missin' you"
Bad Dont Seem So Wrong,Trae tha Truth,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook:]
Ain't no sense to bitch about it
Cause you all know what's gone wrong
Late at night, when you're in your bed
The bad don't seem so wrong

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Tryin' to justify the violence, reconcile in silence
Dress it up in fancy clothes. Wash it down with diamonds
Drown it out with music. Act like they don't apply to you
Look how wobbly the rules is. You probly could improve if
You was in charge, maybe runnin' thangs
You was involved things would be different
Maybe you could make a difference
Or probably not and things would stay the same
And you go to sleep at night
Knowin things will never change
Wake up in the mornin and you feelin kinda strange
Don't remember last night, so you back at it again
Turn back up your music. Put back on your chains
Fasten on your watch and slide on all your rings
Put back on your glasses that block out all the pain
Hit yo niggas on the phone, and tell em that it's on (Tell em that it's on)
[Hook]
Ain't no sense to bitch about it
Cause you all know what's gone wrong
Late at night, when you're in your bed
The Bad Don't Seem So Wrong

[Verse 2: Trae]
Destined to be a winner. Tryin to pick up where the rest lose
Prayin to the Father, tryin' to figure out your next move
Pain across your face and still you wear it like your best shoes
But yet, you no accept it, cause it just might be your best news
Nothin taken for granted, still you searchin for an answer
Your fightin to be sane, your momma fightin with cancer
Father ain't around, so now you gotta be the man, now
Tomorrow ain't ever promised so you gotta take a stand now
Hard times seem to be the only thing you understand
Fuck seein a mil, you tryin to make it to a couple grand
Even with a couple grand, you gotta try to make it last
You ridin for the fam knowin the Devil tryin' to make ya crash
You gotta hold on, homie if you only knew
Never quit, knowin somebody doin' worse than you

[Hook]
Ain't no sense to bitch about it
Cause you all know what's gone wrong
Late at night, when you're in your bed
The Bad Don't Seem So Wrong
[Verse 3: Trae]
You on the only road to give up. Strugglin where your heart at
Though death is where you end up, they tell me that's where we start at
Either way, you gon make em remember you
Just pray you don't get stuck in homicide for that interview
You ended up in tears when all you wanted was a smile
(All the while) Lookin for hope you end up losin as a child
Realizin nothin helps to take the the pain away
Cause if it was somethin that numb away the feelinm
You'd pray to God to situate a day
It's hard to keep it. Stand up. You're leanin on your last leg
The pressure tryin' to weigh in. You just ran out your last bread
Window of opportunity feelin like it just shut more
They tell you to be thankful. Your response for em is ""what for? ""
It seem like everybody else in a better position
Only thing else left to do is open up your ears and listen

[Hook]
Ain't no sense to bitch about it
Cause you all know what's gone wrong
Late at night, when you're in your bed

Remember, more than an adversary, I'm very quick
I'm ready to hit 'em with this gift I'm equipped to kick
So, grab your coat and your hat, 'cause I'm prepared to clown
Let's gather the set and throw these motherfuckers down
Oh shit, 2Pacalypse is back and strapped
Attackin' the packs, I’m kickin' the facts on stacks of raps
And those that max, relax, and let the Blacks go jack
I'm gettin' taxed, by packs and packs of angry Blacks
I'm ready to go, I'm rippin' the shows
Hittin' the door, gettin' the hoes, clothes
Pumpin' the funk, thanks to the Hump, 'cause the nose knows
Check the pose, froze when you see me close
Punks, you gonna roast, hopes in a cloud of smoke
Broke, choked on some potent dank smoke
Wrote rhymes that'll bring me bank notes
Nope, I ain't the type of fella that you're used to

Bed Remix,J. Holiday,['hip hop'],"[Plies]
It's Plies baby, let me go tuck 'em in
My bay just called me and told me to cum put her to sleep
She said her period just went off, feel like she in heat
I been feinding for her, I couldn't touch her all week
I told her to get naked and be waiting on top of the sheets
I wanted her so bad when I've seen her I didn't have time to speak
I told her on my shoulders is where I wanna see her feet
I put a pillow behind the headboard so it wouldn't squeak
And put her hands around my waist and told her push me deep
I told her I'm gonna work with her all night until she on
I can feel her nails in my back that's how I know I'm beating
I put my ear to mouth I love to hear her breathing
I can tell she almost at her peek by the way she's screaming
I feel her wetness on my stomach and I'm the reason
She's clutching the sheets and running I'm tryna keep her even
Whispered in her ear if you don't nut I ain't leaving
She went from moaning to shaking and now she's sleeping

[Hook:]
I wanna put my fingers through your hair
Wrap me up in your legs
And love you till your eyes roll back
I'm tryna put you to bed, bed, bed
I'm gonna put you to bed, bed, bed
Then I'm gonna rock your body
Turn you over
Love is war
I'm your soldier
Touching you like it's our first time
I'mma put you to bed, bed, bed
I'mma put you to bed, bed, bed
[Verse 1:]
Girl, change into that Victoria Secret thing that I like
Alright
OK, tonight you're having me your way
Perfume, spray it there
Put our love in the air
Now put me right next to you
Finna raise the temp in the room
First rub my back like you do
Right there, uh-uh, right there uh
You touch me like you care
Now stop
And let me repay you for the week that you've been through
Working that 9-5 and staying cute, like you do
Oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Hook:]
I love it (I love it)
You love it (you love it)
Everytime (everytime)
We're touching (we're touching)
I want it (I want it)
You want it (you want it)
I'll see you (see you)
In the morning (in the morning)
[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
I'm staring at you while you sleep
Irreplaceable beauty
Put my face up in your neck and breathe (aww, breathe)
Take you into my senses
Wake up, it's time to finish
Round two, it's round two
Matter of fact it's closer to three
She's like, ""how long I been sleep?""
Shorty, kisses turn into the sweetest things
Like give it to me
And I can feel her tell me

My angel this is wonderful
Thanks, for letting me bless you
Come down, fly, right, drift back into heaven
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh

Keep It Thoro,Prodigy of Mobb Deep,"['hip hop', 'blues', 'jazz', 'r&b', 'pop']","[Intro]
Oh, y'all niggas killers now—oh, word?
Catch you coming out your fucking crib, nigga
Yeah, catch a fucking bullet, nigga

[Verse 1]
Ayo, I break bread, ribs, hundred dollar bills
Peel on Ducatis and other four-wheels
Write a book full of medicine and generate mils
Tour the album, only for more sales
We used to catch those on the block with crills
Now, it's paid shows, promoters post up bills
Sign deals only if the math is real
If we can't match numbers, then you can't have the Head Nigga In Charge and shit
Live-nigga-rhymes artist
Pardon, P-dub shines regardless
Remorseless, haunt niggas like poltergeist
My advice, 'fore you get like that, is think twice
Before you move on it, put jewels on it, who want it?
Loose niggas make the news when we start forming
Snatch stripes off a nigga's uniform often
Don't embarrass yo' delf, you way out your jurisdiction
While niggas bullshit on the grill
I don't fuck around, dunny—it's most real
I keep it thoro, nigga
[Break]
Yo, let me back up for 'em, lemme back up, yo, yo

[Verse 2]
While niggas bullshit on the grill
I don't fuck around, dunny—it's most real
I gave birth to your whole style and feel
How do it feel to hold my dick in public?
Cockblower, duplicate rap cloner
It's me and you do it live on stage for dolo
I smack niggas like you, smash niggas by the tools
Grab niggas by the throat, show and prove
Rhymes cocky, crazy ill, mad rowdy
Did a buck off of my shit and wrapped your Audi
Temperamental, I snap quick, very touchy
Ayo, my attitude is all fucked up and real shitty
I rap like no one out there can fuck with me
You feel different, nigga, see me
I throw a TV at you crazy, bitches say, ""P, you crazy""
A pain in the ass—nah, but fuck you, pay me
I'm no shorty, nigga, I stop your glory
I'm a thorough street nigga for real, you just applaud me
Avoid P, man, take your baby mom's advice
I'm nothing sweet, ill with the guns, you pay the price
When you see me in the streets soldier, salute me
You just a groupie, oh, you gangsta, then shoot me
Who gives a fuck really, I miss my nigga Twin
Kill me so I can join the rest of my force up in the heavens
You rap niggas make me laugh, y'all crazy ass
And I don't give a fuck what you sold, that shit is trash
Bang this, 'cause I guarantee that you bought it
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus

Here we go, turn it up, let it start
From block to block we snatching hearts and jacking marks
And the punk police can't fade me and maybe
We can have peace someday, G
But right now I got my mind set up
Lookin down the barrel of my nine, get up
'Cause it's time to make the payback fat
Tell my brothers on the block–better stay strapped, black
And accept no substitutes
I bring truth to the youth tear the roof off the whole school
Oh no, I won't turn the other cheek
In case ya can't see when we burned the other week
Now we got 'em in a smash, blast
How long will it last 'til the po' get mo' cash
Until then, raise up!
Tell my young black males, blaze up!
Life's a mess don't stress, test
I'm givin' but be thankful that you're livin', blessed
Much love to my brothers in the pen'
See ya when I free ya if not when they shove me in
Once again it's an all out strapped
Keep ya hands on ya gat, now your boys watch ya back
'Cause in the alleys out in Cali I'ma tell ya
Mess with the best and the vest couldn't help ya
Scream, if ya feel me; see it clearly?
You're too near me

To the sell-outs, livin' it up
One way or another you'll be givin' it up, huh

I'm supposed to say peace, sing songs, and get capped on
But it's time for a new plan, BAM!
I'll be swingin' like a one man, clan
Here we go, turn it up, don't stop
To my homies on the block gettin dropped by cops
I'm still around for ya
Keepin my sound underground for ya
And I'ma throw a change up
Quayle ain't do nothing but blow my name up!
Now my homies in the backstreets, the blackstreets
They feel me when they rollin' in they fat jeeps
This ain't just a rap song, a black song
Tellin' all my brothers, get they strap on
And look for me in the struggle
Hustlin 'til other brothers bubble

Holler if ya hear me!
""Hard""
""Tellin' you to hear it""

Will I quit, will I quit?
They claim that I'm violent, but still I keep
Representin', never give up on a good thing
Wouldn't stop it if we could it's a hood thing
And now I'm like a major threat
'Cause I remind you of the things you were made to forget
Bring the noise to all my boys
Know the real from the bustas and the decoys
And if ya hustle like a real G
Pump ya fist if ya feel me, holla if ya hear me
Learn to survive in the nine-tre'
I make rhyme pay, others make crime pay
Whatever it takes to live and stand
'Cause nobody else'll give a damn
So we live like caged beasts
Waitin' for the day to let the rage free
Still me 'til they kill me
I love it when they fear me

Pull over and let me out, it's on on sight
Now let me show this white boy what that Westside Connect like
Booya booya from the gauge as I spit them
The buck shots spray and made them lay as I hit 'em, uh
Ain't got to sweat his punk ass no mo'
1 down and 2 to go, hand me a fo' fo'
Let me get my ride on, get my homicide on

You bustas wanna see me but you can't come close
Because I'm Ace homies with Amerikkka's Most

Now what gave your bitch ass enough heart to diss me
You'll come up missin' and Sen Dog is so wack he ain't worth dissin'

Did you tell ya momma that I had to help ya

You say that I took your hook?
It must be the white boy thinkin' all niggas crooks
Now what, you hip-hop hippies?
How you fuckin' junkies

Strike two, leave 'em standing still in their tracks
Strike three, you can call us two one three
It's the L and the B that makes me act like a G

Had the drums come in real bold

So the big ballad strings will never get played
Pretty melody I wrote will never get sang
Piece of paper that I started with got thrown away
A song about our love will never see the light of day
Why? cause you made it that way
Yea you made it that way

[Hook:]
I was gonna write you a love song
But you screwed it all up
Playing games now you're just
A lame who's shit out of luck
I almost wrote you a love song
[Verse 2: Big Sean]
(Crazy ass bitch)
She threw my watch out the window
Chain in her hand
She running through the crib
Finding anything she can
Our relationship is not the only thing that's out of hand
She even called my momma like
'you need to get your man
Cause your son lying on me
I ain't trying to get a tan
And this the last time he'll have me crying in my hands
So I'm heading to the club trying to find a man'
Bitch you headed to the club trying to find a man?
What is you saying?
Hoes and passionate night gowns
But you the only one I imagined in white gowns
So with your left hand you should let me add a ring to it
Since mr and mrs anderson just has a ring to it
She like 'why you act like that to me?
Then walk right back, mike jack to me?
Everytime we fall out I throw your ass out'
But you just end up boomeranging right back to me

[Hook]
[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I think you crazy, crazy
You need medication
You should calm down
You need meditation
Sending me a text with a hundred exclamations
About how I'm wrong without any explanation at a ll
Before you say another nigga next up
I should call the maid down cause I messed up
I gave you what you need
Even on those shopping sprees
I would throw you paper like extra extra (read all about it)
She said 'what if we reverse roles
And you was front row cheering at my first show
And a couple dollars later and some Louis vuitton clothes
I could fuck a couple niggas thinkin that you said I know
And since I had no feelings for them then it shouldn't hurt yours
And since you thought id never do it, it even hurt more
And I would lie about it but you found out from a source
Whos word was more truthful than yours'

[Verse 4: Suai]
I'm so glad I didn't ever pen it
Now you ain't got nothing with your stupid name in it
And if I would've did it I probably would've stay with you
Listening to the lies you were constantly telling
You did me all wrong
What would even make me wanna write you a song
So glad I moved on
Cause now I gotta new guy that's turning me on
And the big ballad strings about to get played
Pretty melody I wrote about to get sang
A song about his love is gonna see the light of day
Why? cause you made it that way
Yea you made it that way

Obama Nation,Lowkey,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
This track is not an attack upon the American people
It is an attack upon the system within which they live
Since 1945 the United States has attempted to overthrow more than 50 foreign governments
In the process the U.S. has caused the end of life for several million people, and condemned many millions more to a life of agony and despair

[Verse 1]
The strength of your dreamin' prevents you from reason
The American dream only makes sense if you're sleepin'
It's just a cruel fantasy,
Their politics took my voice away but their music gave it back to me
The land where their lumpen are consumed by consumption
Killing themselves to shovel down food in abundance
I guess a rapper from Britain is a rare voice
America is capitalism on steroids
Natives kept in casinos and reservations
Displaced slaves never given reparations
Take everything from Native Americans
And wonder why I call it the racist experiment
Afraid of your melanin, the same as it's ever been
That ain't gonna change with the race of the president
I see imperialism under your skin tone
You could call it Christopher Columbus syndrome
[Chorus]
O! Say can you see by the dawn's early light
(Is it Obama's nation or an abomination?)
(Is it Obama's nation or an abomination?)
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming
(Is it Obama's nation or an abomination?)
(Doesn't make any difference when they bomb your nation)
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through perilous fight
(Is it Obama's nation or an abomination?)
(Is it Obama's nation or an abomination?)
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming
(Is it Obama's nation or an abomination?)
(Doesn't make any difference when they bomb your nation)

[Verse 2]
The world's entertainer, the world's devastator
From Venezuela to Mesopotamia
Your cameras lie 'cause they have to hide the savage crimes
Committed on leaders that happen to try and nationalize
Eating competitions while the worlds been starvin'
Beat up communism with the help of bin Laden
Where would your war of terror be without that man?
Every day you create more Nidal Hassans
Kill a man from the military, you're a weirdo
But kill a wog from the Middle East you're a hero
Your country is causing screams that are never reaching ear holes
America inflicted a million ground zeros
Follow the dollar and swallow your humanity
Soldiers committing savagery you never even have to see
Those mad at me, writing in emails angrily
I'm not anti-America, America is anti-me
[Chorus]
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air
(Is it Obama's nation or an abomination?)
(Is it Obama's nation or an abomination?)
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
(Is it Obama's nation or an abomination?)
(Doesn't make any difference when they bomb your nation)
O! Does that star spangled banner yet wave
(Is it Obama's nation or an abomination?)
(Is it Obama's nation or an abomination?)
O'er land of the free and the home of the brave
(Is it Obama's nation or an abomination?)
(Doesn't make any difference when they bomb your nation)

[Verse 3]
I don't care if him and Cheney are long lost relations
What matters more is the policies, I lost my patience
Stop debating, bringing race into conversation
Occupation and cooperation equals profit makin
It's over - people wake up from the dream now
Nobel peace prize, Jay-Z on speed dial
It's the substance within, not the colour of your skin
Are you the puppeteer or the puppet on the string?
So many believed it was instantly gonna change
There was still Dennis Ross
Brzezinski and Robert Gates
What happened to Chas Freeman? (AIPAC)
What happened to Tristan Anderson?
It's a machine that keeps that man breathing
I have the heart to say what all the other rappers aren't
Words like Iraq, Palestine, Afghanistan
The war's on, and you morons were all wrong
I call Obama a bomber 'cause those are your bombs"
Start From Scratch,The Game,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: The Game]
Aight, the fuck are you lookin at, self?
You wanna piece of me?
Ohh man, shit
The story of my life

[Verse 1: The Game]
If I could start from scratch, I wouldn't change shit
Same red bandana, same four-fifth
Same G-wagon, same hoodrat bitch
Workers in the kitchen cookin' up my shit
Same telephone booth, same connect
That mean the same hollow tips breakin' up in my chest
Same bloody t-shirt, same address
Same Dogg Food album banging in my tape deck
Homie, if I can make '94 today
I'd tell Eazy and Dre to bring back N.W.A
I would've told 'Pac not to stomp out Orlando
Told Puffy and Big about the Rampart scandal
I got too many dead homies, fuck a rap career
I'd give anything in the world to bring back my nigga Tear
Seem like we was just in Magic City yesterday
If I could bring back my homeboy Charles, he would say
[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back

[Verse 2: The Game]
Homey if I could rewind the hands of time
I would've cut off the PS2 at 12:49
Nigga I'm a gangster, I stay on my grind
Who knew 11 minutes later I'd get shot with my own 9
I was two beeps away from a flatline
When you a Bad Boy niggas don't wanna see you Shyne
Dre said it's my turn, he call it Game time
23 inch Lexani's, bitches call 'em LeBrons
I'd give my own life if I could change God's mind
Bring Baby Loony back at the drop of a dime
He let off a whole 'K, got shot one time
That was a cool nigga, I wish he had nine lives
My brother Jevon died cause he chased the cat
It's a dog eat dog world, Jesus please holler back
I got a confession to make, it's called payback
If you don't wanna listen, show me where Pastor Ma$e at

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back
[Verse 3: The Game]
I would've told Big Will they raid every Tuesday and Thursday
When pigeons in your coupe, you gotta watch where your birds lay
Would've told V to stay sober
When niggas beg for mercy, that mean the beef is over
Told Meeks take the Porsche back, drive the Rover
Told Slim hit reverse on that hardtop Nova
I would've changed a couple of lines when I wrote ""Soldier""
So I wouldn't have to live lookin' over my shoulder
My life is like a Impala, ridin' three-wheel motion
I been front to back, side to side
Level my six-four frame out, keep on rollin'
Keep your family far away and your enemies closer
Picture this, The Source sucking Benzino's dick
Tryin' to be the big fish in the pond, you know how them piranhas get
You dead when that green line go flat
If you could start your life from scratch, you couldn't change that

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back"

Yeaaa, Uh
Let me introduce me, I don't gotta pack due to the fact I'm Africa's Rap Bruce Lee
Plus they've been trying to shoot me since I was two feet
So I am never scared, you can Youtube me
Where Im from they will pull your card Mister, you ain't hard mister
I was initiated into manhood at thirteen and it wasn't a barmitzvah
I break a bottle on ya like a bad bartender
Let my star venture out, I got war in me, so let me vent it out

I dont expect you to feel my pain, but with respects to the rules of the game, They dont apply because I made it this far, stage dive like a ghetto rockstar

[Hook]
And if rap gets jealous cause I rock heavy, it don't worry me if mothafuckers dont get it
So if rap gets jealous, cause of where I'm headed, I used to be a public enemy, don't forget it
And if rap gets jealous cause I rock heavy, it don't worry me if mothafuckers don't get it
So if rap gets jealous, baby Im a menace, you know, I came to bring the pain

[ Verse 2]
Ill admit it I could spit it like a fitted knitted cap. That means tight and won't stop like a city cab
That means I'm not white but I figured do it big because the slum needs me
So instead of getting a beat from Kanye(eezy) who would probably take half my budget
I could save the back end and send it back to Mogadishu where my family and friends getting patched up again you can ask hova
The hood is harder than you thought like a fifty chain getting snatched... in Angola? {Not sure}
I don't expect you to feel my pain, but with respects to the rules of the game, They don't apply because I made it this far, stage down like a ghetto rockstar

I'm givin' mad love, I'm snugglin' hugs
Strugglin' thugs, smugglin' drugs
Jugglin' jobs, guzzlin' jugs
So here's a toast to federal checks
Hetero sex, unaffordable medical debts
We travel in packs, unravelin' facts
And gravel in cracks to find babblin' max, gafflin' tracks
I grapple an axe for them bafflin' acts
Of mysterious stab-in-the-backs who dabble in wax
Stealin' my art when I sculpt it
The culprit that stole shit'll end up with his skull split
Then I buried the hatchet, I carry the fat shit
Butter Fingers is here when it's necessary to scratch it
Baby, all I wanna do is swallow one or two
Smoke a little bit and follow one of you
Back home when the party ends
So tonight I'm droppin' naughty hints
To the finest women in the audience

Ayo, biters are like tarantulas, vandalous
Livin' as scandalous as a television evangelist
But I can handle this, I'm the rhyme biter, crime fighter
Caped crusader, takin' care of undeservin' limelighters
I think we live an era meant for me
Experimentally I found a way to spread the terror mentally
When I stumbled upon his resolution
By usin' a special fusion of chemical solution for this fresh illusion
You couldn't see me with binoculars
I'm armed like an octopus
Step on stage and you'll get socked and pushed
Talkin' that junk like you had Black Bart at your back
Come to battle me and you get smacked hard as you act
When I rep-a-resent it and will have a referee in it
Every minute, so when I win it you never resent it
I'm forever demented
Come up with funk, I'll never be scented
You got the point when I cleverly sent it

Eminem is headed skyward
For those who thought that I would
Make you bored and treat you like a piece of plywood
I've got miracle lyrical capability all in me
With the agility to escape a killer bee colony
So get your cameras and capture how miraculous
I rap for all you Draculas
And showed you all how wack you was
I meant it as a diss
‘Cause you don't posses the pizzazz of this
I'm hazardous enough already as it is
Without you addin' fuel to the fire, I'm cruel to the liar
Who fails to recognize my reign and hail rule to the sire
Clinical studies show that I'm cynical
There's no one who's identical
To my fresh and authentic flow
I'm sure the party people can agree
That I'm enchantin' rhythm romantically
Freakin' vocals so frantically
So throw your hands up in the atmosphere
And let them know the only party that was phat was here

Wearing knock off frames tryna claim they got cabbage

I am home now so fuck you and your weak crew

Parents Just Dont Understand,DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
You know parents are the same no matter time nor place
They don't understand that us kids are gonna make some mistakes
So to you other kids all across the land
There's no need to argue, parents just don't understand

[Verse 1]
I remember one year
My mom took me school shopping
It was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister
All hopped in the car
We headed downtown to the Gallery Mall
My mom started bugging with the clothes she chose
I didn't say nothing at first
I just turned up my nose
She said, “What's wrong? This shirt cost $20”
I said, “Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!”
The next half hour was the same old thing
My mother buying me clothes from 1963
And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate
I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips!
I said, “Mom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep”
She said, “You're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet”
I said, “Mom, let's put these clothes back, please”
She said “No, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show”
I said, “This isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowzer
Mom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers
But if you don't want to I can live with that but
You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks”
She wasn't moved - everything stayed the same
Inevitably the first day of school came
I thought I could get over, I tried to play sick
But my mom said, “No, no way, uh-uh, forget it”
There was nothing I could do, I tried to relax
I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts
And when I walked into school, it was just as I thought
The kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought
And those who weren't laughing still had a ball
Because they were pointing and whispering
As I walked down the hall
I got home and told my Mom how my day went
She said, “If they were laughing you don't need them
'Cause they're not good friends”
For the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom
That I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times
So to you all the kids all across the land
There's no need to argue
Parents just don't understand
[Verse 2]
Oh-kay, here's the situation
My parents went away on a week's vacation and
They left the keys to the brand new Porsche
Would they mind?
Umm, well, of course not
I'll just take it for a little spin
And maybe show it off to a couple of friends
I'll just cruise it around the neighborhood
Well, maybe I shouldn't...
Yeah, of course, I should
Pay attention, here's the thick of the plot
I pulled up to the corner at the end of my block
That's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking
I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking
You should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions
I honked my horn just to get her attention
She said, “Was that for me?”
I said, “Yeah”
She said, “Why?”
I said, “Come on and take a ride with a helluva guy”
She said, “How do I know you're not sick?
You could be some deranged lunatic”
I said, “C'mon, toots, my name is the Prince
Besides, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?”
She agreed and we were on our way
She was looking very good and so was I, I must say - word
We hit McDonald's, pulled into the drive
We ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes
She kicked her shoes off onto the floor
She said, “Drive fast, speed turns me on”
She put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas
We almost got whiplash, I took off so fast
The sunroof was open, the music was high
And this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh
She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far
I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car
We're doing ninety in my Mom's new Porsche
And to make this long story short - short
When the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell
I said, “I don't have a license but I drive very well, officer”
I almost had a heart attack that day
Come to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway
I was arrested, the car was impounded
There was no way for me to avoid being grounded
My parents had to come off from vacation to get me
I'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me
My parents walked in
I got my grip, I said, “Ah, Mom, Dad... how was your trip?”
They didn't speak - I said, “I want to plead my case”
But my father just shoved me in the car by my face
That was a hard ride home, I don't know how I survived
They took turns - one would beat me while the other was driving
I can't believe it, I just made a mistake
Well parents are the same no matter time nor place
So to you other kids all across the land
Take it from me, parents just don't understand"

[Verse 2]
Listen, that girl so scandalous
And I know another nigga couldn't handle it
And she shaking that thing like, ""Who's the ish?""
With a look in her eye so devilish, ugh
She like to dance at all the hip-hop spots
And she cruise to the crews like connect-the-dots
Not just urban, she like the pop
'Cause she was livin' la vida loca

[Pre-Chorus]
She had dumps like a truck (Ugh), truck (Ugh), truck (Ugh)
Thighs like what (Ugh), what (Ugh), what (Ugh)
Baby move your butt (Ugh), butt (Ugh), butt (Ugh)

That dress so scandalous
And I swear another nigga couldn't handle it (Ha)
See, you shaking that thing like, ""Who's the ish?""
With a look in your eye so devilish, ugh
You like to dance at all the hip-hop spots
And you cruise to the crews like connect-the-dots
Not just urban, you like the pop
'Cause you was livin' la vida loca (Whoa)
[Bridge]
She had dumps like a truck, truck, truck
Thighs like what, what, what
Baby, move your butt, butt, butt, ugh
I think I’ll sing it again

Glistening (That thong-th-thong-thong-thong)
Your thighs, your knees (I like it when the beat goes, ""Da-na, da-na"")
Your breasts, your feet (Baby, make your booty go, ""Da-na, da-na"")
Oh, please, tell me (Girl, I know you wanna show, da-na, da-na)
Baby, oh (That thong-th-thong-thong-thong)

Da Art of Storytellin Pt. 1,OutKast,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Somebody hit me the other day for a rendezvous
Was it the bitch that fucked the Goodie and the Dungeon Crew?
Let's say her name was Suzy Skrew 'cause she screwed a lot
Makin' a nigga hit that chonk at legitimate spots
Not no parks, backseats, or things of that nature
Had to hate ya, playa
I'm dickin' the ho down — never said I paid her
Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Vader, made her
From College Park and Fayette all the way down to Decatur
Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty — that was shawty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a Bimmer 840
It's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mama beeped me, seven o'clock, it's gonna cost me
But I still wanna cut her, though — maybe she had to work?
I caught her in the mall, wearin' a real tight skirt
She was fine as fuck — I wanted to sex the ho up
She said, ""Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck""
I said, ""Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do
I gotta pick up my daughter, plus my baby mama beeped me, too""
She said she understood and everythin' was kosher
I gave her a Lil' Wil CD and a fuckin' poster
It's like that, now
[Chorus: Sleepy Brown & Big Boi]
It's like that, now
You better go on and get the hump up out your back now
It's about fo' or five cats off in my 'Lac now
We just shoot game in the form of story raps now (Yeah)
It's like that now, t's like that now

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Now Suzy Skrew had a partner named Sasha... Thumper
I remember her number like the summer
When her and Suzy, yeah, they threw a slumber
Party, but you can not call it that 'cause it was slummer
Well, it was more like spend the night
Three in the mornin', yawnin', dancin' under street lights
We chillin' like a villain, and a nigga feelin' right
In the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite of all the bullshit
We on our back, starin' at the stars above (Aww, man)
Talkin' bout what we gonna be when we grow up (Mm)
I said, ""What you wanna be?"" She said, ""Alive""
It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes
I coulda died, time went on, I got grown
Rhyme got strong, mind got blown
I came back home to find lil' Sasha was gone
Her mama said she with a nigga that be treatin' her wrong (Man)
I kept on singin' my song and hopin' at a show
That I would one day see her standin' in the front row
But two weeks later, she got found in the back of a school
With a needle in her arm, baby two months due
Sasha Thumper
[Chorus x2: Sleepy Brown & Big Boi]
It's like that now
You better go on and get the hump up out your back now
It's about fo' or five cats off in my 'Lac now
We just shoot game in the form of story raps now
It's like that now, it's like that now

[Outro]
Grandmama: Keisha, Keisha! Cut that loud mess off, you hear all that thunderin' and lightnin', and get off that telephone!
Keisha: Ugh, alright
Child 1: Grandmama, what’s all that noise?
Child 2: I’m scared
Grandmama: Baby, don’t be scared. It's gonna be alright. It’s just the Lord doin' His work, okay?"

What more
Yes, much more than this
I did it my way

[Verse 1]
It go, ""My way, Chi-Way, this way or the highway""
Shots'll lay you off on your day off, like Friday
The Roc got 'Ye, but they ain't snorting it
They just got him up at Baseline, recording shit
Yeah, I been broke—now I'm good, bitch
I ain't no Kennedy, but I'm hood-rich
So I say ""my way"" to thank you to the ghetto
And everybody else: Thank you very little
I took the road less traveled, the unbeaten path
I been beaten, but never broken through the darkest past
It's sort of like when King spoke and said, ""We free at last""
Ain't nothing free from that point, though, we needed cash
And we need it fast
We broker than Ethiopians, just tryna eat at last
Now all the Blacks cooking up that almost-white
'Cause getting green make 'em treat us like we almost white
Almost

Niggas wanna diss K on they local mixtapes
There they go again, lying to consumers
Get they hair cut in the Little Shop of Rumors
You lil' sloppy with your cockiness, ain't ya?
A lil' arrogant with all your comparisons
'Cause as far as the Chi
I got the most plaques since the beginning of rap
But nah, y'all ain't mentioning that
Y'all just talk about my dough, how I left Chicago
How I'm the only one eating—shut your piehole!
And wanna figure out why I'm getting 'em high, though?
Why? 'Cause you need fire, and I'm a pyro!
And you a parrot, you copy what I do and say
Only difference between you and me—you a gay
""Awww, did he get his feelings hurt?""
""Nawww, he got titties under his shirt""

It go, ""My way, Chi-Way, this way or the highway""
When you walk straight, niggas tend to look at you sideways
I say, ""Fuck that, dog, I get my own way""
Niggas ain't believe me 'til they see me on TV
And seen K freely getting head on the freeway
Then pass her to Freeway just like it's a relay
We stay four-stars or better
'Cause the couches in the rooms got more leather
And we gon' flip Carter when we could afford better
And back before Benzes, when we could afford Jettas
You still dress Ardjo, but only pay partial
Stay getting something off lay-away at Marshall's
Polo and Carbeshers, we into them things, dog
Back in '96, we was living like kings, dog
Forty-cals or better, toting them things, dog
So up the Turkish mink and take them rings off

Chucks on the feet, hundreds on the laces
You ain't sayin' nothin' 'less you talkin' big faces
Same on the T, L's on my jeans
Everythin' clean so I'm fly as angel wings
And I got a bunch of dreams but they don't mean nothin'
Bitches tryna kick it like they Vicki B's husband
See we stuntin', trees he be puffin'
Got nothin' on me, baby you don't need substance
And I ain't in pursuit unless she's Mike Jack Bad
Complex like math, smooth like jazz
Never lose my swag got my back like a sponsor
Iceberg cool still burn like contra
Name another nigga that could take off without a launcher
Fresh, and all my bombs Adams like Yolanda
Chucks on the feet, hundreds on the laces
You ain't sayin' nothin' 'less you talkin' big faces
Same on the T, L's on my jeans
Everythin' clean so I'm fly as angel wings
And I got a bunch of dreams but they don't mean nothin'
Bitches tryna kick it like they Vicki B's husband
See we stuntin', trees he be puffin'

Complex like math, smooth like jazz
Never lose my swag got my back like a sponsor
Iceberg cool still burn like contra
Name another nigga that could take off without a launcher
Fresh, and all my bombs Adams like Yolanda
[Verse 2]
Probably the sickest nigga spittin' that isn't really known
And they think that I'm from Houston cause I like my music slow
Got a high school diploma, I'm gettin' every dollar
Rough neck nigga had to fix my collar
Wake up in the mornin' feelin' big like Texas
Death to any nigga tryna take my breakfast
No hesitation dog you shouldn't even bother
Ask my father even he know I'm a king like Arthur
Gave you a warnin', now you facin' hazards
Shit they fiend for I call it blue magic
Pure shit nigga I call it blue magic
Fuck Maybach Music, this is brand new Jag shit
Fuck Teddy Pain this is Teddy Pendergrass shit
It's like I've never been healthy, sicker than your average
Game on lock, chain on the same
Screens in the whip and they goin' fall like rain
Ice in that bitch, so it's cold like hail
Like hell find a nigga that don't feel me like braille

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I'm a know-it-all, can't tell me nothin'
Greedy genius I just want it all like my cousin
I don't need it but I still take the cars and the girls
Went from bout gettin' the money to about gettin' the world
I'm a real nigga man, I ain't dealin' with the haters
Only time I'll stop writin' is when they run outta paper
Even then, my flow sick, so I probably won't need it
Say you're makin' moves, but I probably won't see it
Nigga you could rap, but you like to front
See me in the 'lac, tell your bitch bring a blunt
My nigga I'm back, meet me in the front
Call this everything that's yours cause that's everything I want"
El Chupa Nibre,DANGERDOOM,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Brak, Zorak & Lois Griffin]
Adult Swim presents: Danger DOOM (And what else?)
Why did you buy this album?
I don't know why you did, you're stupid
Fuck yourself

[Verse: MF DOOM]
Ha ha ha ha!
The super flow with more jokes than Bazooka Joe
A mix between Superfly Snuka and a superhoe
Chew a MC like El Chupa Nibre
Digest a group and sell the poop on eBay
Danger with the vest screamin ""Shoot the DJ!""
DOOM clickin over two chickens, three-way
Four in the 5, a cork on the freeway
Villain find a way to make 'em pay whatever we say
State your intentions
""I really love your tape but I hate your inventions""
Very well - what you want, a brownie?
He took off the mask and whispered ""Put me where you found me""
He kept his paper digits in a chunk
Once joined a rap clique - Midgets Into Crunk
He did a solo on the oboe
Coulda sold a million then the Villain went for dolo
And cited creative differences
Basically they hated, he left no jaded witnesses
Rappers suck, when they spit I doubt 'em
The crap they sing about you wanna slap the fuckin' shit out 'em
Psht - time waits for no man
On a blind date, a lover with a slow chrome hand
Judged him by his shoes, hot smelly Brogan
Budged him with the news, called him pot-bellied Conan
No prick barbarian
A strict beeratarian, a sick pair of Merry Men
The beat is like a swift kick in the rear end
The stiff dick made her lose her lipstick and hairpin
He said ""Djamn! Act like you know me
Even with the mask on, show me what you owe me""
Tell her brush her grill and wash her face and twat homey
Dumile got her like Inuyasha got Kagome
What we have here is a failure to communicate
If you gonna hate, might at least get your rumors straight
About DOOM the Great, a lot more confident
Came a long way since the days we had to rhyme for rent
It was time well spent, vented
Spelt and dented, hell-bented and heaven-scented
A wire is dead, he's in it for the cash flow
I'd like to send a big up to Firehead Lazzo
Let a brother know once you lasso Hasbro
So when he come with Destro he gets no hassle
Could hardly get a word in and
Wonderin' what the damage is to retain Harvey Birdman?
[Outro: Master Shake]
Yo uhh, Danger! It's me your old buddy, Shake
Ahh, I heard you're doin a little project and uhh, y'know
I hear you talked to some OTHER PEOPLE
And I thought you were smarter than that
But obviously I am WRONG cause you know my rappin is the shit
I don't give it out for free though! So uhh, I'll do it
Feel free to call me, at my number, which you have"
The Mask,DANGERDOOM,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Is it much, too much to ask
Not to hide behind the mask?

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
Head on straight, mask on crooked
Exit stage left, with the cash gone, took it
Off like a khufi, the fit was a bit doofy
He tried to get screwy, with that two for you
One two for me, G, cut the cranky attitude
Wet 'em like a handkerchief on a stanky fatter dude
Whether you's a rapper or a dang singer
Once you in, there's only one way out, like a gangbanger
With a new crew key chain, and street name
What set do he claim for fame? Peep game
Just to keep feta and stay dipped
You need it like a letter, or better a getaway whip
This old thing's rusted
Encrusted as the gold rings the old kings busted
Planning in, global starvation and fat herb
Now what in tarnation did I go and do that for?
Stuff happens, like getting snuffed for tough tit rappings
See I told him enough, quit your yapping
The same apply to any and all chumps
The only question he had for y'all was, ""How many lumps?
Three or four?"" Either or
Mon chéri amour so why you need your heater for?
The super villain slid in your party for free
Want an MC, get out of here, kid, you bother me
[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
The day I took my mask off, my face was missing for two days
For the record, G, came back a year later
A whole new identity, Tony Starks pedigree
My money green like my nickname was celery
Who is Ghost? He flashed his toast
Never wore sheets, but bulletproof coats
Oh no! The feds cried for the mask back on
Told them Ghost is dead, he'll return at the crack of dawn
Few years from now, him and his pals
Before the Jetson era arrive, he'll be back summertime 2005
With a half of face iron
The other half water, look like alien science
In the summertime here, you can see the face boil
But the other side, I keep lubed with the Pennzoil
Mad loyal (Uh-huh), when the winter time come (What?)
I gets stuck 'cause my brain all numb
It's like I ate a thousand ICEE's and frozen Pepsi's
Aquaman's pops can't water check me
Disrespect me, indirectly
I seen his feet and they both lefty, he steppin' half correctly
As I stroll the globe and terrorize the planet
With a Bill Clinton mask and them Playskool hammers
Me and DOOM, always be the best on the landing
Superheroes for life until our souls vanish
[Outro: Brak & Zorak]
Check me out, my name is Brak and that's a fact
I got a mom and a dad and they are out back
We sit by the pool and we nibble on snacks
Then we eat a big lunch and we all take naps!
Why'd the beat stop? Hey! Hey!
I got a mask too so gimme the mic!
Cheh! You're no DOOM
C'mon Danger Mouse, gimme that beat!
Turn the beat around! Love to hear per-cussion!
You suck!
Turn it upside down! Love to hear it...
I know talent, and you ain't got it
I WASN'T DONE!"
Perfect Hair,DANGERDOOM,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse: MF DOOM]
Perfect hair, to the second power of forever
Ask him do he need it? Hells yeah, now or never
On a mission with friends of fair weather
Sooner the better, off to Mt. Tuna, wear your leather prepared sweater
And watch out for Catman my brothers
He keep his strand slicked back like Scatman Crothers
A balding boy, sound like Janeane Garofalo
Fiend for a sloppy fro, who seen the evil Coiffio?
Not me yo, I'm leavin', gone
Even if him got them bomb weavin' Kanekalon
No more or less stress than your old boss
The tears burn your eyes less than fresh S-curls sores
And Brenda, the best girl lost
Uncle grandfather bare chest was pearl gloss
Earl tossed, there goes a whole tray of hamburgers
Villain 'til he old and grey like olden day scam workers
Circa one nine seventy-one
On the mic machine it seems his work will never be done
He seeks the ninth level of power
But weak geek might freak it in another hour
Or so, they call the fool retarded hair guy
In school you could spot it when he nodded ""Here, why?""
I think his true name was Gerald
The toupee, the male pattern anime herald
A good laugh like the walk to the bank
Not the plank, talk to the hand and the hot frank dog
[Outro: Master Shake]
Danger DOOM, it's Master Shake, hey buddy!
Ah, did you get those e-mails I sent?
Umm, I'm still waitin, to hear from you
I-I think, maybe you're, maybe you're in the shower
Do you, are you in the shower? Okay
But I'm still, totally, I got some other stuff
Uhh, but I'm, I am committed more to doing yours
So, if you can let me know, today
That'd, uhh, that'd be great, okay?!
Just, just gimme a call! And fa-for the schnizzle
For to do the rap pizzle
And again I'm really sorry, about that other one
The call... Meatwad sucks
Okay, call me back dawg!"

But don't worry
Believe me, he'll get busy
When it comes to
Poetry he's got plenty
La, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
Jump 'em in like jump rope, double dutch
Then turn on the mic with a thumb stroke, subtle touch
Cuddle clutch, is this thing on?
Like the fling with Mrs. King Kong, this spring gone?
Sing a song of slaphappy crappiness
He came to blow like it was strapped to his nappy chest
Surely I jest, the best on a wireless mic
Not an eye test, yet I digress
But why stress? Try and remember when
Maybe bit the tender skin-ned babysitter Gwendolyn
The type to hit and run and go tell a friend
Word to El Muerto cucaracha exoskeleton
He know, flow like interstellar wind
Tow a rap djinn by his toe into hell again
Ahem, one-two, check me too
Loose wreck see through your goose-neck EQ

Ayy, if I may interject
Rap these days is like a pain up in the neck
Cornier and phonier than a play fight
Take two of these and don't phone me on the late night
The beat won't fail me
With more rhymes than times he washed his hands and feet daily
And all that kerosene ain't cheap
Villain been deep since a teenage creep
Peep, he always was a gentleman
And kept the pen and a pencil in his mental den
Right there next to where the Rolodex was
Before it turned up all burnt by his solar plexus
He don't know his own strength
When he's on the bone it's like the microphone's length
And width, ain't it funky like dingy socks?
Feel the full effect off cassette in your Benzie Box
[Hook: Cee-Lo]
His name's DOOM

Money - that and
I wanna get some steady bitches and hoes
And some candy for my nose
Some diamond stones, to roll with my chrome and
Hey, genius, you even know what that means?
Uh-uh, what does it mean?
Where's the keyboards, and the tambourine, and the guitar?
And you know, I mean, the stuff that like, white people like
We had a piano
Somethin bad-ass, like uhh, I don't know
Like uhh, REO Speedwagon or somethin'
Hell yeah!

[Verse: MF DOOM]
Aiyyo, I know this dude right
Carl, he wore tight blue sweats but wasn't glued too tight
All he had upstairs was a crude light
You think that's weird? He lived next door to a food fight
Howdy Danger, much obliged for the beat God
Even though you still eat lard, by the Meatwad
Mesquite charred, speakin of which or who
Voice all squeaky like they tuned it up a pitch or two
A chunk of burned up witch's brew, get your crew
See if they can't get past the stench of the stew
It stank like a septic tank full of pig poo
He mostly only turned into a frank or a igloo
Switch your view to the brother with the fried dreads
Not to be confused with the incense selling thai heads
His name rhymes with Mike Hawk
You could call him livewire, eye sockets, Frylock
Able to shoot electricity through his eyeballs
And blast all through your single sided brick and drywall
More interesting than professional wrestling
When he's online, you can find him on Instant Pestering
What's up with your boy? He's not a soft or hot drink
Whoever don't like it could suck his straw, it's hot pink
On some junk like Gucci on a classy ho
Might splash you in the face with nuclear pistachio
Make a fast break, or that'll be the last mistake
That ass'll make is what you get for messin with Master Shake
Look out, don't block the screen son, lunge across
Tryin to watch Adult Swim, ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force!""
Rock this cult hymn, sock your mean younger boss
Psht - Adult Swim, ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force!""
He often wondered, should he get the logo tatted to his woody?
He could be ""#1 in the hood, G!""
Easily

That wasn't about you
That was about me being upset about something else
I shouldn't have called you but I did
Cause I just, I like you so much
I'm REALLY looking forward to us working together
And just, as of now that I'm calm
And after I've apologized profusely - probably too much
I am available, call me doggie - woof!"

Basket Case,DANGERDOOM,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Harvey Birdman]
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury
We all lived through the 70's
The clothes, the music, the heartwarming
But rarely amusing Ziggy cartoons
Now, later, who are we to look at these two, fine young men
And say, ""You there! I sit in judgment of you!""

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
For being a drunken lush and bad as hell
Read the charge and thunk, sunk in in a plush padded cell
Tempur-Pedic Craftmatic adjustable
Go on try to stare at it, it's not that combustible
I accidentally spilled some kerosene
And dozed off with the L lit, doped up on thorazine
Matter of fact, make mines a double
Few could see the point like a line through the Hubble
DOOM hit the eye in the sky with a pie
Shrink said he thinks he believe he could fly
Spread his wings and flap like a goose
He'll show you how to do it if you help him get the straps loose
Diagnosed as shell shocked from totin' toast
And still could hear the bells rock Doc, another Lodine dose
He claimed he couldn't take the racket
Faked his own escape in a eightball straight jacket
[Interlude: Myron Reducto & Harvey Birdman]
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury
This, animal, here; this ursine fellow UNCLEAN!
He rejected society and retreated
To a cave in the woods to plot his vile - NOD!
And it isn't true that at these times
He often descends into a delusional state
Sometimes actually adopting another person's persona?

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
I started punchin' once I saw son lungin'
He had me put on punishment for eating the last Munchkin
So now they got me down here near the dungeon
Nurses all arguin' over who's to do the spongin
He requested time off for bugged behavior
And rhymed off of thug beats bumped by a neighbor
Who spoke with his fist and kept a mirror with a thumbhole
Cell twelve drumroll, ode to a gum sole
A O.G. like a captain that's retired
Rappers is space cadets yappin', be quiet
And that's an order, ship your daughters to my quarters at once
And don't sip the tap water dunce
He is the super, a stranger who talks to you
Maybe even offer tech support and walk you through
Villain, man in the mask, spit in the face
Show him where to go, inside a hand basket case
[Outro: Myron Reducto, Harvey Birdman, Mentok the Mindtaker & MF DOOM]
The defendant's confession!
Uhh, nothing further
Mentok commands you to procede, with your case!
Just since some people, wear a mask
Don't mean, they, did nothing automatically (Now wait a second!)
Your Honor, I'd respectfully like to have a word with you in chambers
I request an immediate dismissal, on the grounds
On grounds that (Your Honor, I)
Just as the mask, some people wear a mask
Don't mean that they did something"
Hip-Hop,Joell Ortiz,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Yo, do me a favor
Accidentally step on your white sun glasses
We don't wear those over here, this is hip hop (that's right)
This is Carhartt jackets
Timberland boots, unlaced
This is Champion hoodies, chicken wings and french fries
RIP pieces on the handball court
This is us still fightin' police brutality, this is hip hop

[Verse 1]
I ain't tryin' to bring New York back
I'm just a breath of fresh air, that good old New York rap
Slick talk to the track, c'mon, who brought that to the game?
Graffiti all on the train, get up your name
I don't feel how I used to feel
I'm in my 20's so a new Nas joint used to give me the chills
In the barber shop tryin' to cop a new hot tape
Them Rob Lowes is crazy, the doo wop's great
It's hip hop… and yes, I'm a fan first
If you from the south, finger snap till your hands hurt
If you from the west, W's in the air
If you from the East Coast, act like you from here
The good old two-step, the classic head nod
The thirsty iced grill, who wants to get robbed?
That was the energy in the club
On the real, that was the energy that I loved
[Hook – x2]
Aww, man, this is hip hop
Hands up if you forever a fan of hip hop
I wake up hip hop, go to sleep hip hop
Dream about hip hop, ‘cause I am hip hop

[Verse 2]
I ain't tryin' make you dance I just rip beats
But the soul in my voice give you quick feet
I don't know what it's like to not dig deep
When I'm holding this mic I don't just speak, pipsqueak
The tides come in and the Earth shakes
200 hundred mile an hour winds, I'm your worst fate
Birthdate: July 6th 1980
How can your age even matter when you rhyme this crazy?
Aww, man, I gotta thank the Lord
‘Cause with this pen in my hand, I don't think that hard
It just happens, wrist action, classic in the makin'
I kick back and just laugh, I'm happy, I'm amazin'
Look at me, gaze into my eyes, see the poverty?
Now understand why me and this music just gotta be?
It's something that's inside of me
And I can't shake it, so I embrace it, and let y'all taste it

[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Somethin' happen to may body when that track smokin'
Y'all swim more wilder than me, I be backstrokin''
I'm the best and my fans'll second that notion
I'll be the last man standing with my back broken
Crack open a couple of 40's, celebrate Mijo
My competition, man, they squared in the H3
I run circles around them like a skate key
And turn your little buzz into ""Yo, whatever happened…?""
So don't play, B, I ain't talking shit
I just got a awful gift that'll make your office doors just stiff
They won't open, so no braggin'
And no boastin' while I'm hungry
Matter of fact, don't do that when I got a lot of money
Yup, I'm feelin' myself, that sound right
You gotta step in that ring like, ""Listen, I'll pound Mike""
You gotta step on that court like, ""I could hold down Mike""
The way I step on that stage and have the whole crowd like…

Taped Conversation,Young Buck,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Taped Conversation

What young buck gon do
How.. how Young Buck gonna respond

[Chorus x2]
If you see me in the streets rolling
If you see me in the block holding
If you see me rolling by
Remember that you don't know me (you don't know me)

Verse 1:
Bitch niggas do bitch thangs
Look at 50 what he does just to get fame
Record my phone call, when I spoke from the heart
That was a year ago, this was a joke from the start
You a ho, and I know
The only people record conversations is 5-0; now die slow
See here ya go, while you gotta chance
Let a real nigga put a band, on ya hand
Understand I don't bite the hand that feed me
But I will if that hand say it don't need me
Look at y'all on TV, Banks looks uneasy
If he told you how he feel, this is where he be
And they know Yayo is stuck in your a-hole
Half of your staff only there for your pay roll
Hey TIP, lay low, you ain't gotta respond
He had the magic stick; I got the magic wand
I'm the Don
[Chorus x2]

Verse 2:
Real niggas do real thangs
Real niggas never die and never give names
If a real nigga cry then its real pain
So on the real my nigga I don't feel ashamed
Ain't no pussy in my vein I'mma G
Witout me, y'all just the U-N-I-T
Without B, y'all should just give it out free
Cuz in the south WE consider you WEAK
Nigga when I speak, the streets get relief
They really find the truth out about this beef
A victim of defeat when your album was released
When Jay-Z made Kanye look like a beast
BET told Jim Jones it was peace
Just trynna get some new york love at least
But they loving me
I'm laughing at you while you worry bout me
When your punk ass respond, I'mma give you verse 3 haha youll see

[Chorus x2]

Outro:
*whistling*
Come here boy, sit booboo sit
Good dog
Ahh man I guess you must have forgot
Every man got an emotional side to him
Yea, whether he choose to show it or whether he choose to hide it, hahaa
Dont make you no less than a muthafucking man
Nigga I'mma G, 50
So let me talk to your punk ass
Tell you what you wanna hear
You know when you put the shit out you should have told them
That that was a conversation that me and you had
Something bout a year ago, right?
It was a heart felt conversation from Young Buck
So yeah they heard the emotional side of me
But they see the bitch nigga in you 50
Believe that
Cuz see like, nigga looked at you as a big brother my nigga
7 years, I mean we done made millions together nigga
I followed your lead I should say, you know
So I dealt with you from the heart nigga
I thought you dealt with me from the heart too
But now I know.. yeah.. I see.. the devil in disguise
We see now.. the whole world see now
And I know you thinking this shit making you look big
But you really look bad my nigga
Look at what you had my nigga

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
Proof died, what happened? (What happened?)
Marshall stopped rapping (Damn!)
I guess that makes me the captain (Uh-huh), hit the mattress (Okay)
Pistol-packing (Uh-huh), sick assassin (Yeah)
Hit the gas and (Okay), get to mashing
D12 broke up? Who you bitches asking?
Our clique's relaxing in the hills of Aspen
Popping pills and Aspirin
And I'm the machine that brought Marshall back to life
Told him that my rhymes just have to be tight
So I figured that I would grab the mic
Like a nigga 'bout to rhyme right after Christ (Woo!)
Sometimes we get mad and fight, right back to the lab tonight
Grab an O and I have to light
That's only right
Living like a rock star is the only life!
And we are six grown men who are old friends
To my nigga Bugz, DeShaun Holton
All the way down, I'ma hold them
D12, nigga, till the world end (D12!)

Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!

[Verse 2: Swifty]
A lot of niggas try to underestimate me
Till I come back with vengeance and slice their trachea
Y'all been placed on a contract for hating
I'ma waste them, one by one, for tainting
My ability to kill a facility, I'ma send them to Satan
Fast as a child rapist facing
Life or trifle, Henny has made me in waiting
They gon' lock me up under the basement
I'm a one-man army, marine, and navy
You done made me angry, I'm crazy, insane
And maybe I bite the face of your baby
For anyone who try to diss Proof or Hailie
I'ma break their Halo, put them on the reaper's payroll
Erase them and hang they soul
It ain't no hoes here, McVay got a scroll
With names on it, dipped in blood, man, I'm cold
[Chorus: Pat Benatar]
Hit me with your best shot! Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot! Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!

[Verse 3: Kuniva]
I know you thought we were done, we rose up (Uh)
Got a gun to make your whole inside fold up (Blow!)
They hit us with the best shot and we're still standing (Uh)
So tell the world it can lick our scrotum
Straight soldiers, who wanna stunt? (Who want it?)
Who wanna be the fall guy? Who want the pump? (Who want it?)
Who wanna get slumped just for looking at me sideways?
Every time I roll up, I'ma keep it blunt (Haha)
Where did y'all run when we almost lost Marshall? (Huh?)
Y'all did it big like Costco (Yeah)
And we back in this bitch like a tampon
Still, talk dirty, Em's clean like a bar of soap (Ugh!)
And you will soon slip on some buffoon shit (Yeah)
My hand's on a sweeper, yours on a broomstick (Bitch)
So stop looking all stupid, I'm rude and abusive
And strapped, don't make me use it

Hit me with your best shot! Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot! Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place! (A'ight, here's where I come in at)

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I came in this game with bad intentions
And I ain't budged, not even an inch since then
I'm stubborn, evil, and insensitive
I'm like nothing you ever seen, pencil in
Hand, it's like I'm holding the insulin
So you might wanna button it like Benjamin
I ain't frightened of nothing, I injure men
Step right in this mark with my henchmen and
Walk, straight to the stage
I ain't here to cause trouble, get the fuck out my face
Fall back, little cocksucker
I ain't A&W, don't get your cold mugs in my way
Get 'em? Shattered, fucking A
Been this way since B.C., what can I say?
I'm stuck in my ways like double stick tape
Don't get turned to a vegetable, dick face!
You ain't Superman, stay in your lane, Lois
D12 spitting flames like flamethrowers
Spit till we get sprained jaws with metaphors
That cut with the same force as chainsaws
Hope you're coming with your A game
'Cause things have changed and this game isn't the same game, boys
The stakes have been raised, better make lemonade
When they give you lemons, if they want us, let 'em aim for us

[Chorus: Pat Benatar]
Hit me with your best shot! Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot! Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!"
November Has Come,Gorillaz,"['alternative', 'rock', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
Slow it down some, no split, clown bum
Your gold hits sound dumb, hold it now, crown 'em
Where you found them at?
Got 'em 'round town, could've drowned in it
Would have floated, bloated, voted
Sugar-coated, loaded hip shooter
Draw for the poor, free coffee at the banks
Hit through the straw, none more for me, thanks
That blanks the raw, that dank sure stank lit
Sank past the pit for more hardcore prank spit
Crank it on blast, roll past Front Street
Blew the whole spot like some old ass with skunk meat
These kids is too fast, juiced off a junk treat
Who could get looser off a crunk or a funk beat?

Something has started today
Where did it go? What you want it to be?
Well, you know November has come
When it's gone away

Something has started today
Where did it go? What you want it to be?
Well, you know November has come
When it's gone away

Bah, can you dig it like a spigot?
My guess is yes, you can, like ""Can I Kick It?"" Wicked
Liquor shot if you happy and you know it
As you clap your hands to the thick snot of a poet flowin'
Grope a pen and I'm in cope hymen
Doper rhymin' more worther than the Hope Diamond
Acquired off the black market
A wire tappin' couldn't target a jar of spit
The rapid-fire spark lit
(Zzzt!) A rapper bug zapper
And it don't matter after if they's a thug or dapper
Plug your trap or it's maximum exposure
The beats got family members askin' him for closure
Aw, send 'em a gun and tell 'em, ""Clean it""
Then go get the nun who said her son didn't mean it
She wore a filled-in thong of Billabong
That said, ""Nah, fo'real-a, the Villain on a Gorilla jawn?""

Something has started today
Where did it go? What you want it to be?
Well, you know November has come
When it's gone away

Dominant Species,Immortal Technique,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Yo, in a hundred years from now
Everyone who's living on this planet will be dead
So it's inconsequential really, all the shit that you talk
All the bullshit that you stand for
It's more important what, what you're ready to build
What you're ready to pass down to your children
What you're ready to create
You better fuckin' remember that
When you challenge a motherfucker like me
Remember, I'm the dominant species

[Verse 1]
I'm stuck inside the future and life is chaotic
The government is psychotically racist and robotic
The matrix of entrapment is socio-economic
Neurotic conspiracy theory becomes reality
Life is war, and every day's a battle to me
I'm on the brink of insanity
Between extreme intelligence and split personalities
But I elevate to the point of reversing gravity
Revolutionary conceptuality spittin' out of me
Even the dead people in my family tell me they proud of me
Stupidity's not allowed by me, ‘cause I don't got time to play
I'm the black hole lyricist that'll take your shine away
Darkness at any time of day
I'm the Technique and you're nobody so what you tryna say?
Stellar density becomes your physical alignment
1.8 billion tons per square inch confinement
[Hook]
I drop knowledge so heavy it leaves the world unbalanced
Exterminate the spiritual force of all that challenge
I'm the lyrical apocalypse that crumbles the granite
Replacing you as the dominant species on the planet

[Verse 2]
Yo, yo, lyrically I'm infinite, like possibilities
But you don't have the capability, like infertility
‘Cause opening your mouth to question my validity
Is like tryin' to contradict the theory of relativity
What I spit is the epitome of heavy artillery
My enemies are obsessed with me, like the bitch in Misery
But break out, like a father runnin' from responsibility
Every time I step and abuse the mic with versatility
I balance humility, with brutal instinct
I'll make your whole cypher look like those crackers from N'Sync
And I don't care about your link, or your luxury car
I shed light with more magnitude than all of the stars
La Brea Tar Pit thick, so don't ever talk shit
And remember somethin', nigga, while you rave and rant
A roach can live for nine days without its head, but you can't

[Hook]
I drop knowledge so heavy it leaves the world unbalanced
Exterminate the spiritual force of all that challenge
I'm the lyrical apocalypse that crumbles the granite
Replacing you as the dominant species on the planet
[Verse 3]
I'm explicit like video tapes of conjugal visits
Some niggas are too stupid to understand it, like astrophysics
Technique is exquisite, I'll make your thoughts a victory
Get pessimistic with the quickness
If you think that I will just become another statistic
With anything but success when I bless the mic as I spit this
Specifically prolific with Kaprosi’s sarcoma coma type sickness
My style is like a ten-year-old child with a slit wrist
Too much reality for the fuckin' hit list
I got a Black Panther mentality with a spic fist
So you can get dissed, even if you're locally gold
Vocally bold, or globally, multi-platinum sold
I'm emotionally cold, disciplined, and ready to kill
Like spirits in the same room with you, I'm givin' you chills
I drop knowledge while these motherfuckers clumsily spill

[Hook]
And I drop it so heavy, it leaves the world unbalanced
Exterminate the spiritual force of all that challenge
I'm the lyrical apocalypse that crumbles the granite
Replacing you as the dominant species on the planet"
No Mercy,Immortal Technique,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Malcolm X]
""Brothers and sisters, and friends, and I see some enemies
{Laughter and then applause}
In fact I think we'd be fooling ourselves
If we had an audience this large and didn't realize
That there were some enemies present.""

[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
I'm a weapon that fires lyrical projectiles
With no mercy, I'm cold-blooded like reptiles
Touch a pregnant bitch and make her give birth to a dead child
Every time I flex styles
Niggas vacate the premises and become exiles
I manufacture rhymes like textiles of x-files
Enlighten juveniles livin' life with no purpose
Organize an army that will make the devils nervous
Competition is worthless like the electoral vote
If you provoke, I'll break your motherfuckin' neck in a yoke
Your better off throwin' your shitty life away sniffin' coke
Technique will choke you into a spiritual state
And it will take a lake of hydrochloric acid to soften this
I'll fake your parents suicide and kill you in the orphanage
But I inspire ideological metamorphosis
Stop talkin' shit, or I'll make your existence a memory
So you can have me frozen cryogenically for centuries
But I'll break the ice if anyone on the planet mentions me
I'll burn a hypocritical flag intentionally
Explosive revolutionary chemistry's my destiny
[Hook: Immortal Technique]
No mercy is what I chemically bomb on enemies
Your life's a fuckin' mistake, technique is the remedy
Destroy you before you become what you intended to be
And in the future you'll worship those that descended from me
No mercy is what I chemically bomb on enemies
Your life's a fuckin' mistake, technique is the remedy
Destroy you before you become what you intended to be
And in the future you'll worship those that descended from me

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
When I fight you, I won't snipe you
I'll use a HIV-infected needle to strike you
As well as anyone that vaguely resembles or looks like you
And just to spite you I'll force your children
At gun point to bite you, and rip a piece off
To start the beef off of the rest of your petty limited life
I'm comin' at'cha to catch ya by surprise in the cyph
Nobody's stupid enough to back ya when I tactically attack ya
Because my style is nasty like protruding bone fractures
And you're a played-out dirty pussy devil like Margaret Thatcher; but Technique never get captured inside the rapture
'Cause I mastered the art of causin' natural disasters
You should learn the difference
In between the students and the master
My stature is the dispatcher of damagin' decibels
Even though my starvin' people are considered expendable
I consecutively escape the racist, corporate tentacles
I spit raw kinetic energy that's immeasurable
Retaliation for perpetration is unendable
Mercy is not extendible
I'll break your fuckin' brain down into psychological chemicals
[Hook: Immortal Technique]
No mercy is what I chemically bomb on enemies
Your life's a fuckin' mistake, technique is the remedy
Destroy you before you become what you intended to be
And in the future you'll worship those that descended from me
No mercy is what I chemically bomb on enemies
Your life's a fuckin' mistake, technique is the remedy
Destroy you before you become what you intended to be
And in the future you'll worship those that descended from me"

Gilla House niggas baby

We gon' get a lil' somethin straight here in the place to be

[Redman] + (Kool Moe Dee)
Yeah... yo
You now rockin with the best, I'm blessed
I deliver well, that's why I'm up in the S
UPS, through rain sleet or snow
I never break down, my skin made of Goretex
Heard Reggie went left, cause when I do right
Punk niggas out of spite only give me a few mics
Three best emcees, time for new light
Let the streets decide on who nice! (Let's rock the house)
You see to be an emcee is not money in the bank, or
Blowin niggas off like ""Homey we are late!""
A million dollar boss dictatin what I think, shit
His shooter's gettin real nervous in the paint
Five star when I rank, like Le Armitage
Girls lookin like Nicki Minaj, Reggie
Hip-Hop I rock steady, just check my clout
When Jersey in the building, I (rock the house!)

Yo, you now rockin with the best, one of the best
Best believe boy I look so FRESSSH~!
Just tellin you how I feel

[Redman] + (Kool Moe Dee)
Heheh, hey, they asked me how I maintain
The rap game and the streets I can picture in the same frame
You ain't raw? You don't ball
So lose yourself, tryin to keep UP when I change lanes
My weed game green, clientele is swell
It's Cool like LL
DeBarge look alike brother, time will reveal
That I'm doin it, and doin it well! (Let's rock the house)
Even if you read braille you can feel my swag
I'm your seein eye dog with the pen and the pad
Blue collar, when I talk, you can touch
So FUCK how much money you can fit in the bag!
My gift is the gab, the street's the truth
They got a lil' lost when down South came through
I stayed in the booth and began to trip
Cause (can't nobody rock like me, hah, remember this!)

[Hook]
[Redman] + (Kool Moe Dee)
Yo, what you consider the best, what you invest
A half a mill' around your neck? Let me guess
Punchlines after punchline for a check
I did that, when GangStarr had to ""Get a Rep""
My city in debt, that's why I sound hungry
My flow dumb as fuck like Al Bun-dy
Ask Treach, I do it for my lonely
All y'all come and get it if you want me (let's rock the house)
Man, I'm a funny ass nigga
And haters gon' say ""He a funny ass nigga!""
But I'm a asset, good barbershop talk
The game without me is Wu-Tang without RZA
Pour out a little liquor how I murder it
Beef; my boys Fatburger it
Gilla - never heard of it? Shut your mouth

Wolf Gang be on that wrist split splatter
Snortin' coke pattern misfit'll hit Mick Jagger
Me and Jasper bangin' Bastard, beatin' midgets up with ladders nigga
Don't give a fuck, that's that Wolf Gang swagger
Don't give a shit so my dick fuck bladders in your ear
Radical shows that Wolf Gang's radder
With a staggerin' pack of cocaine in the sack of my dick
Where the lips of your teen daughter sits, bitch
Fuck Tyler, I'mma change my name to Uncle Phil
Cause every girl I deal and fuck, it's always against her Will
Dope enough to snort crack and sit the fuck still
In Nellyville's old folks home searchin' tip drills
Get my fill on with this grandmother named Jill
Takin' shots of poon juice to the head for a cheap thrill
Hopefully my dick don't shrivel up, when it's time to bust
In this rusty cunt, that won a cup in collectin' dust
Boogyin' with Jesus and a bunch of Nazi hoes
In the front row at a holy Justin Bieber show
Slowly my Ritalin is kickin' in and Jesus left hand
Begin to make me feel like a little kid again
This isn't rape, this is fuckin' without a condom on
Throw her slightly to the right, so dyke I'm kinda wrong
Wolves is out past dawn on your front lawn
Me and Juan ensurin' you that your slut daughter's gone
At the pawn shop, tryna sell this Baume watch
She's a white vegetarian, I'll get this blonde cock
Lip balm she's some nun bitch from St. John
Told her that her pastor was a faggot and he likes John
He's a janitor recreational rectum manager
I am not, let's consider me a little pecan
That'll get your chest nutted on with an acorn
They swore that I was all fuckin' nuts like a gay porn
Cause I disregard the white dress and the perm weave
And the headrest had to have about eight thorns
I was born back, Wolf pack, nigga fuck that
Somebody tell Satan that I want my fuckin' swag back
[Chorus]
Niggas know it's Wolf Gang, in the mall with
Thirty bitches, and they gorgeous
Wolf Gang, killing niggas, rabble rousers
And Wolf Gang running shit in dirty houses
Wolf Gang (Kill 'em all!)
Wolf Gang (We gotta kill 'em all!)
Wolf Gang (Kill 'em all!)
Wolf Gang, you better kill 'em

[Verse 2]
Box logo on my muthafuckin' chest
Left hand staggerin' on her muthafuckin' breast
Deep down, I'm an emo fuckin' faggot that's depressed
So the fuckin' school suggested me a therapist
I confessed bein' atheist, they said I was possessed
By a demon, cause I wanna see a bitch infested
With my semen and oppressed by my give a fuck less
Of the baby not bein' digested by a fuckin' hungry punk
Feedin' kids to slutty nuns with his cum
Got a fuckin' blog that needs a post? I can get it done
2DopeBoyz I know you like this
(Like what?) This hot cum that's from my dick
Call me a clown but a week from now
You're goin' to hear this and begin to ride on my dick
Like how the fuck did we miss this kid's shit
Oh yeah we're old as fuck, we didn't have our glasses
But fuck y'all, I don't need y'all help

And I did the video for really though

Hostile Gospel Remix,Talib Kweli,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: singers] + (Talib)
Deliver us, deliver us (Yeah)
Deliver us, deliver us (What? Yeah)

[Talib Kweli]
And what the people say? We wanna live it up
And what the people want? Please deliver us
And what the people need? Hey...
I got that, yeah

[Talib Kweli]
I call these rappers baby seals, cause they club you to death
I could call 'em Navy SEALs, cause they government feds
What become of the vets? They drugged up, they fucked up, they in debt
There ain't no love and no respect, it's like a gang it's like a club or a set
Hip-Hop's the new WWF
What do you rap or do you wrestle? Niggas love to forget
We got til it's gone, you think you on, you still hustlin backwards
Your topical norm a tropical storm, it's a fuckin disaster
Back to the topic we on, it all started at Rawkus
They couldn't find the words to describe me so they resort to the shortcuts
Is he a backpacker? Is he a mad rapper?
An entertainer or the author of the last chapter
We living in these times of love and cholera
Synonymous with the apocalypse, look up the clouds is ominous
We got maybe ten years left say meteorologists, shit
We still waitin for the Congress to acknowledge this~!
[Hook: Talib Kweli] & (singers in the background)
What the people want? Please deliver us
We wanna live it up, please deliver us
Th-th-this is the, th-th-this is the, this is the hostile gospel
I'm reaching through the fire � please deliver us
I'm preaching to the choir � please deliver us
Just keep it real with us, you scared to spill your blood
Your words rung hollow, we need someone to follow

[Talib Kweli]
You ain't promised tomorrow, so get your paper up
You can't always just borrow and asks for favors bruh
Stand on your own two, never covet thy neighbor's stuff
Karma's a bitch so watch your mouth and what you sayin bruh
I start a conversation based on general observation
Hip-Hop is not a nation, take it to population
Niggas got a lot to say when locked inside the belly of Satan
Awaitin trial debatin how the hell I got placed in this system
Am I a victim or just a product of indoctrination?
They exploit it and use me like a movie with product placement
You hear the congregation; this is the hostile gospel
The truth is hard to swallow it'll leave you scarred tomorrow
Keep it honest our motto, these niggas keep it bottled
I'm the writer who reach the fighters like speeches by Cus D'Amato
DJs stickin to vinyl like ""Fuck Serato""
Suppliers who ride around the block, in the custom models
Ballin like the struck the lotto you know who the cleanest is
A nigga keep it reeich with the stitch and greedy geniuses
I'm not a hipster, but I flip it like a sneaker pimp
Expose the game, treat it like a bitch
Smack fire out these hoes, cause they snitch and tap wires while I plead the fifth
You can't trust a soul in the biz, so be careful who you eatin with
And sleepin with and also who you chiefin with
You never know they might've added in secret ingredients
[Hook]

[Talib Kweli]
Freedom's a road that's seldom traveled, watch hell unravel
Right before the eyes of the soldier who fell in battle
The single mother who raised her daughter to bear the sacred water
And not take the hand of every man who make a offer
To black kids wishin they white kids, when they close they eyelids
Like, ""I bet they neighborhood ain't like this""
White kids wishin they black kids, and wanna talk like rappers
It's all backwards it's identity crisis
The industry inside us is vipers with fangs trying to bite us
Drug suppliers is the health care providers
We cakin, makin narcotics outta household products
We ain't workin out 'til we exorcise the demons that's inside us
Plus they seem to just provide us with enough rope to hang ourselves
Enough dope to slang ourselves, enough toast to bang ourselves
It's officially nigga season, these niggas is bleedin
That's why I'm spittin freedom we had enough of trigger squeezin

[Outro: singer]
In these tryin days and times
All I need is to be free
I can't do it on my own
Lord can you deliver me?
There are trials still to come
It's salvation that I need
So I'm reachin to the sky
Lord can you deliver me?
Deliver us...
Deliver us, yeah
Deliver us, ohhhhhhhhhh
Oh, deliver us
Deliver us
Ohhhhh Deliver us yes
Deliver us, deliver us, deliver us

For the first time in a long time I did

An amazing conversation
With this girl named Lorraine, who says she's from L.A
And keeps makin me laugh and even asks if she can pay
She could be good for me yeahh
That's when you text me
Tell me that you miss me, I forget about Lorraine
And the fact she's right here with me
She's starin' in my face, somethin had to change
Thought that all these feelings went away

I didn't mean to end his life, I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night, can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight 'fore I end up behind bars
What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry

'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun

I will lose my cool and reach for my firearm

But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm 'bout to leave town, ayy-uh

My swagger's straight through the roof, bitch
Maharishi kicks and Bape Tee's I really do this
Snapping necks since '05, ain't gotta prove shit
Smoking joints with mixed breed bitches, right where the pool is
I never press, just relax, don't start choosing
Taking notes on how to win, fucking students
Left my main chick, now the new bitches I'm scooping
Stacey Dash type, I'm cheating and they clueless
I'm from the gang or the pack or the litter
Better guard your daughter or your mother or your sister
Chances are she is an avid OF listener
And when we exit she will proceed to exit with us
To the Homestead Suites to drink liquor
Party all night, it's her dream to be with us
She'll tae kwon do anything that we mentioned

Do the Creep (ha)
Do the Creep (ha)
And if you wanna make friends at the ATM
Do the Creep (ha)
And do the Creep (ha)

[Verse 1: Andy & Akiva]
Well, we got a new dance, so get up on your feet
It’s real easy to do and it’s called the Creep
Let your hands flop around, like a marionette
Pop your knees up and down, sh-sh-shakin’ your neck
Now pull your waistband up like you expecting a flood
And stick your hair down flat like it was covered in mud
Trim up your pencil mustache and pop them peepers
Put this in your speakers, you a certified creeper
[Hook: The Lonely Island]
When you see a country peach laying out at the beach
Do the Creep (ha)
And do the Creep (ha)
And when a fine PYT walks in front of your tree
Do the Creep (ooh)
And do the Creep (ha)

[Verse 2: Andy & Akiva]
I was six years old when I started creeping
My parents took it to their room and I started peeping
You can imagine their surprise when they lifted their heads
And saw my little ass creeping at the foot of the bed
And they knew I was a creep since the day I was born
Get popping out my momma like some kettle corn
And the doctor caught my head and he starting freaking
Cause I came out clean and I came out creeping

[Interlude: The Lonely Island & Nicki Minaj]
Nicki (uh), Nicki (uh huh)
Nicki, Nicki, Nicki, Nicki (yeah)

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj & The Lonely Island]
When I was a girl, I creeped in the boys' locker room
Hide deep inside, it was my little creep stalker room
As they disrobed, I was oogling and oggling
Little did they know that for me, they were modeling
And I would laugh: ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
And they would dance: la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
So pop your peepers and squeak out your sneakers
Don’t sleep, come on, get your creep on with me

Go on and get you sweating off the bride at her wedding

They say ""Skepta, you must get loads of girls""
The music's picked up now
I tell em like J2k, nah, it's all switched up now
She thinks that if she talks to me they'll call
Her a groupie behind her back now
So she stands far but close enough for her pictures
To have me in the background
I'm kinda used to it now
They say its all part and parcel
And if it's this much for me
Imagine what it's like for Curtis and Marshall
I wanna go hard
But my body keeps telling me to take it easy
So I sit here watching a DVD logo bounce around the TV
My life ended ages ago, now it's all a dream
Sitting here, thinking how this whole thing all started
From What D'Ya Mean, What D'Ya Mean
Now that I'm getting that paper I heard a couple man want me dead
So I went out bought a Gucci hat and put money on my own head
I forever hear people talking like I don't know about street
Fake gangsters must think I spent my music money on chocolates and sweets
You're looking for beef in London? Nah it's not hard to find it
But I'm not scared of a gun, it's all about the man behind it

Sometimes I think that I think too much
I start thinking about thinking
Then I start to get paranoid
I think my windows need tinting
They say why work all this time
To get famous Joseph
Just to have to wear sunglasses
Cause you don't wanna get noticed
Once in a while I take em off
And I'm like ""arrr, that’s too bright""
Must be because I sleep all day then I wake up at night
Then I phone my girl, see if she wants to link
She said she got work in the morning
So what do I do, I go out for a drink
I spend all my time in clubs
It's starting to feel like home
I don't wanna sit in the VIP but sometimes I just wanna be left alone
I hate when I'm in a bad mood and I see all my supporters vybzin
And I apologies to anyone I've taking a pic with when I weren't smiling
They say ""don't you remember me I met you at Party In The Park""
Babe, I can't even remember where I parked my car in the car park
Now she hates me and every time she hears my song she's changing the station
I swear the human brain weren't designed to deal with all this information

Nobody could season, this tracks couldn't reach him
Cause now I'm on the other side of that glass ceiling
Mmm, the underdogs are off the leash
Eh Joseph, pass the muzzles and the leads
The games full of demons, lets get this arm house on
Everyone wants handouts but I ain't Stretch Armstrong

Looka looka looka here looka shorty got back
Should I ask her for a dance? Hold on -- there's too many in the wolf pack
And besides, Dirty Cash talking to her
Buying her fake furs and taking her to The Fever
Quiet as it's kept, that ain't even his Benz
She spends his Franklins at the malls with her friends
Material girl, living in a material world
But it's all right cause it's Saturday night
So mister funkmaster, pump the Bee Gees
And all you college students, play your Ouijas
Check the spelling: r-e-f-u-g-e-e
Get the CD from Sam Goody, hee hee!
You ain't even close with the rhymes that you wrote
Don't be mad cause you broke
Let me clear my throat -- ah huh ah huh
John Forte, grab the mic, let's sway this way

I'm more than just a rhymer, you still a small timer
Hoping that the game treat that ass a little kinder
Every step tango'd
Your beef don't concern me
I'm eating mangoes in Trinidad with attorneys
My crew's slang flow worldwide like a current
With the every spot where nobody got insurance
Brother, do the math -- you ain't half near exotic
My man's claim true; you -- forget about it
Po-po just a nuisance, like my influence
Well, recognize you a lie trying do it
Got juice—told your lady

You gonna save me
God bless the day that my sons survive
We strive to teach the youth, baby, and stay alive

Well, you can tell by the way I roll, shorty, that I'm a ladies man

Condos down the shore

But it ain't in my plan to make moves without the fam
I keep it intact
Yo 'Clef, do the track
John, play the mack while I pay the tax
Business as usual
Watching suspects steal my assets
Get cut with Gillettes
We built this concept, connect like NYNEX
Drinks at the bar, my American Express
[Interlude: Wyclef Jean]
Yo I cook up cook up
The copper pull up pull up
Then I cuff up cuff up
You who's calling bluff
Now you shook up shook up
Cause you lock up lock up
When I love up love up
You who's calling bluff
Hey yo, John is chilling
Dirty Cash dealing
What more can I say, we living
That's what we got, we got it good
And since you understood
We be...

Kenji,Fort Minor,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Mike's father]
""My father, came from Japan, in 1905
He was fifteen when he, immigrated from Japan
He, he, he worked until he was able to buy
To actually build a store""

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Let me tell you a story in the form of a dream
I don't know why I have to tell it, but I know what it means
Close your eyes, just picture the scene
As I paint it for you
It was World War II
When this man named Kenji woke up
Ken was not a soldier, he was just a man
With a family who owned a store in L.A
That day, he crawled out of bed like he always did
Bacon and eggs with wife and kids
He lived on the second floor of a little store he ran
He moved to L.A. from Japan
They called him immigrant, in Japanese
He'd say he was called ""issei""
That meant first generation
In the United States when
Everybody was afraid of the Germans, afraid of the Japs
But most of all, afraid of a homeland attack
And that morning, when Ken went out on the doormat
His world went black, 'cause
Right there, front page news
Three weeks before 1942
Pearl Harbor's been bombed and ""The Japs are Coming""
Pictures of soldiers dying and running
Ken knew what it would lead to
And just like he guessed, the president said
""The evil Japanese in our home country
Would be locked away""
They gave Ken a couple of days
To get his whole life packed in two bags
Just two bags, he couldn't even pack his clothes
And some folks didn't even have a suitcase
To pack anything in
So two trash bags, is all they gave them
And when the kids asked mom, ""Where are we going?""
Nobody even knew what to say to them
Ken didn't wanna lie
He said, ""The U.S. is looking for spies
So, we have to live in a place called Manzanar
Where a lot of Japanese people are""
Stop it, don't look at the gunmen
You don't wanna get the soldiers wondering
If you're gonna run or not
'Cause if you run, then you might get shot
Other than that, try not to think about it
Try not to worry 'bout it being so crowded
'Cause someday, we'll get out
Someday, someday
[Interlude: Mike's aunt]
""Yeah, soon as war broke out, the FBI came and
They just come through the house and, you have to come
All the Japanese have to go
They took Mr. Ni, the people couldn't understand
Why they had to take him because he's an innocent laborer.""

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
So now, they're in a town with soldiers surrounding them
Every day, every night, looked down at them
From watchtowers up on the wall
Ken couldn't really hate them, at all
They were just doing their job
And he wasn't gonna make any problems
He had a little garden
Vegetables and fruits that he gave to the troops
In a basket his wife made
But in the back of his mind, he wanted his family's life saved
Prisoners of war in their own damn country, what for?
And time passed in the prison town
He wondered if he'd live it down
If and when they were free
The only way out was joining the Army, and supposedly
Some men went out for the army, signed on
And ended up flying to Japan with a bomb
That fifteen kiloton blast
Put an end to the war pretty fast
Two cities were blown to bits
The end of the war came quick
And Ken got out, big hopes of a normal life
With his kids and his wife, but
Then they got back to their home
And what they saw made him feel so alone
These people had trashed every room
Smashed in the windows and bashed in the doors
Written on the walls and the floor
""Japs not welcome, anymore!""
And Kenji dropped both of his bags at his sides
And just stood outside
He looked at his wife without words to say
She looked back at him, wiping tears away
And said, ""Someday, we'll be okay, someday""
Now, the names have been changed, but the story is true
My family was locked up, back in '42
My family was there, where it was dark and damp
And they called it an internment camp
[Outro]
[Mike's father:] ""When we first got back from camp, uh
It was pretty, pretty bad.""
[Mike's aunt:] ""I-I remember, my husband said
""Oh we're gonna stay 'til last.""
Then my husband died, before they closed the camp."""
We keep it rocking,Maino,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Chorus]
New York city knows how to party

Roll up in the club like blaow
We gon need our bottles right now
We gon make a toast to the town
Drinks in the air, go shawty(Owww)
Welcome to my city, see the bright lights
Diamonds on my wrists, bright lights
The fast cars, the hot girls, the night life
The blue yankee to the back, the white Nikes
Sipping tequila with divas

People outta town call me Brooklyn
Cause they know how I keep it, Brooklyn

Smoke endo then go to party mode
Put your hands up then go retarded though
Damn, I got the beats to make the ground shake, earthquake
I do it for the empire cause I’ve been fire
You ain't never seena monster like me you a liar

[Jim Jones]
Soon as a step on the scene, you hear the bitches screaming
I’m looking like money, stick up kids scheming
Spent 40 on the watch keep the wrist gleaming
I’m in the hood in the truck, got the whip leaning
In Harlem when I talk it’s like Godspeak
Listen close little momma thats the car chill
Vampire life I hear ya heart beating
Bay chill lil momma fore I start tweaking
And you can catch me up in Sac town
Or in the ghost in the Bronx is the background

Yo, take a trip up top

It’s on as soon as you cross 110th street
Yeah, you see poverty at it’s best
If we ain't in the front of the lobby, we on the steps
Yep, 100 deep in the ?
Feel the floor shake when they start playing B-I
Razors in the mouth, the shotguns is knee high
Some of us rock true some of us rock Levi’s
Ahh, but we all rock polo
Don’t matter what the borrough, NY is the logo
Talking to the popo’s a no-no
That should be a rule that’s global

[Joell Ortiz]
You know they had to to put the papi on it
Like my fans, when I crowd dive, I’mma catch a body on it
Leopold scope shotty on it
I’m the hardest right now, I put my project library on it
Pun gone I’m the new Puerto Rico guy
They basura, they don’t want it with the B-O-I
Your rap image mad gimmick, he no lie
I just go all out like Margarito eye
Yaowa, thats the call of my army
We’ll turn your face to a dance hall like Serani
Now this a party, I got a little change but ain't change

Touch your soul, make it whole, the same for you and I

But people, keep your head to the sky

Folk in your face, you're a superstar
Niggas hang around cause of who you are
You get a lot of love cause of what you got
Say they happy for you but they really not
Sell a lot of records and you roll a Benz
Swoll up in the spot, now you losing friends
All you wanna do is give the world your heart
Record label tried to make you compromise your art
You make a million dollars, make a million mo'
First class broad treat you like a nigga po'
You wanna say ""Wait!"" but you're scared to ask
As your world starts spinning and it's moving fast
Tryin' to stay sane is the price of fame
Spending your life trying to numb the pain
You shake that load off and sing your song
Liberate the minds, then you go on home

[Verse 5: Big Rube]
I must admit, they planted a lot of things
In the brains and the veins of my strain
Makes it hard to refrain, from the host of cocaine
From them whores, from the flame
From a post in the game
Makes it hard to maintain focus
They're from the Glock rounds, and lockdowns, and burials
The seeds that sow, get devoured by the same locusts
Cause it's a hard row to ho
If your ass don't move, and the rain don't fall
And the ground just dry
But the roots are strong, so some survive
So you're surprised, now I'm bustin cries
You got more juice than Zeus
Slangin lightnin tryin to frighten
Plains dwellers, of the Serengeti
But get beheaded when you falsely dreaded
Melanin silicon and collagen injected
Dissectin my pride, fool I don't wanna get it started
We be the lionhearted, without infanticide
It's like that red sprite, you can't imagine it
Unless you lookin at the canvas of life
And not through the peephole of mortality
Single minded mentality
Gettin over on loopholes
Gettin paid two-fold on technicalities
Clickin your heels, scared to voice how you feel
Packing steel
Pickin cotton from the killing fields with no toe, though
I don't think we in Kansas no mo' though
Midwest or Dirty South
Clean dressed or dirty mouth
Whether robbin preachers or killin Poor Righteous Teachers
You a scared demon
Shouldn't be allowed to spread semen
And you cowardly lions never defyin the jackals of Babel
Runnin with they pack, tail between your legs
Though the mane on your head say the story
As you downplay your glory
Cacklin, helpin the shacklin of your brethren happening
Just by rappin'

Ay, nigga tell 'em where you from
Southside, I'm a Southside nigga what?
Nigga stunt, you know I tear a nigga up

[Hook]
They say I'm grimy, I'm greasy
I make a one-eight-seven look easy
Fuck that, I lay my murder game down
Push me nigga, see what I'm about

[Verse 1]
I was a snotty nose, nappy head, dirtball nigga
Saying I can't wait 'til I get a little bigger
After niggas jumped me bumping my head
Thinking I wish I had a gun, I fill a nigga with lead
Took a kitchen knife to finna poke me a nigga
Wishing I had a gun so I could smoke me a nigga
Sold my first five quarter gram pieces in the alley
Where Bizzy had the Bondeville and Kev had the Caddy
Now those were the days, when crime really paid
The nine milli sprayed, I got the fuck out the way
From shootout to shootout, the bricks went fast
Robberies went bad, niggas got blast
Niggas kidnapped Drew grandpa kid
Came through and shot Ms. Leak in the head
You wonder why I got a gun? So I can get down for mine
You need that, out on the grind all the time

It was Kangols, Cazelli shades, Pumas and corn braids
Doo-rags on the waist, brass knuckles, switchblades
Ski mask to get paid, new shells to get sprayed
Hoodrats to get laid, money to get made
Yeah, yeah I had a dream
I was rich, woke up broke, gun in my hand
Saying ''damn, dope cost sixty a gram'
I got to find me a nigga, line me a nigga
And say ""give it up kid, before I put one in your wig""
Picture me thirsty, riding 'round foaming out the mouth
Saying ""I don't get on, I'mma lay a nigga out""
Now diamonds are beautiful and pearls are precious
I hit you and your bitch both over your necklace
I'm wreckless, I spray the semi drunk off Henny
Wipe your blood off the shines, run and sell 'em to Benny
Fuck with me, y'all niggas know Boo Boo get busy

Yeah, I gave Just a buck-fifty, ask him if I cut niggas
Shootouts in Bedford, ask them if I bucked niggas
In four-fifth they call me Boo Boo, the accident baby
Hennessy and cocaine helped to grime me and make me
My eyes don't cry, I'm a fatherless child
Got my ass whooped in Spofford, but never that now
When my name in your mouth you better watch how you talk
I'll send yo' punk ass to therapy to learn how to walk
I bust a clip, I'll hit ya hip, I'm takin your shit
Thats how the eses play, for that SSK
You probably heard through the grapevine, I'm good out in Watts
Bulletproof shit, cruising through them Compton blocks
I'm the beast from the East, but I play on the West
In the drop by myself with my nine and my vest
And you niggas best be on yo' best behavior
I was bred for this shit, front on me I'mma blaze ya

Joking rhymes, like the ""Is you just happy to see me?"" trick
Classical slapstick rappers need Chapstick
A lot of 'em sound like they in a talent show
So I give 'em something to remember like the Alamo
Tally-ho! A high Joker like a Spades game
Came back from five years laying and stayed the same
Saying, electromagnetic field it blocks all logic, Spock
And G-Shocks her biological clock
When I hit it, slid into the shitter,  thought I killed her goose
Her Power U's was pure Brita water filter juice
Keep a pen like a fiend keep a pipe with him
Gentleman who lent a pen to a friend who write with him
Never seen the shit again but he's still my dunny
The only thing that come between us is krill and money

Better rhymes make for better songs, it matters not
If you got a lot of what it takes just to get along
Surrender now or suffer serious setbacks
Got get-back, connects wet-back, get stacks
Even if you gots to get jet-black, head to toe
To get the dough, battle for bottles of Mo' or 'dro
This fly flow take practice like Tae Bo with Billy Blanks
""Oh, you're too kind!"" ""Really? Thanks!""
To the gone and lost forever like ""Oh My Darling Clementine""

When it's his time, I hope his soul go to Heaven
He nasty like the old time Old No. 7
You still taste it when you chase it with the Coca-Cola
Make 'em wish they could erase it out the Motorola

If you want what they got, then go get it, it's all gack""

Not a lot of bling
When he do the thing, bada boom, bada bing
From the womb to the tomb
Get that ricotta, bada bing, bada boom
DOOM, your reputation precedes you
Wait 'til you crack and see what ""weed"" do, you dweeb you
No pun intended, takes one to know one, well no - it's unscented
Yo son, demented when them sent it from the other time
Before everybody and they mother rhyme
What a crime - beats is the same way
Make 'em wanna hit the streets with the heat for a lame's pay
Game day, flag on the play, improper helmet
Drag on the suede from the gem drop of well spit
He didn't listen, titty kissin', the city glistened
Depending on what from what position you're sittin'
In the pissy wind, is this thing whistlin'?
Who let the spinnin', whisperin' djinn in?
The Villain again?
Without a doubt, that's his name
Don't play it out or spray it when you say it out your mouth
Then gave him a cold shoulder for a hour
And told him take a gold shower for fakin' funk, soul power
Stocky, short and cocky
Looked like Apollo Kreig after he fought with Rocky
Rhymed in a broken Eng-a-lish slang, not cockney
Thirteen, his first queen wore hot knock knees
Had to tell her pops, yo stop cockblockin', B
Hold somethin' for your daily yay habit
Then go, bada-bing-bing-bing like ricochet rabbit
How 'bout the sicko say stab it?
There's liquor in the cabinet and a slicker for the crab pit
And Heineken, I told him much obliged friend
What I gotta spend if I only touch her thighs then?
Why his eyes widened
He didn't know your man had a nice surprise hidin'
Took pride in ridin' in a sly wiseguy grin
Real recognize real
On the microphone or wheels of mechanized steel
Please, at least respect your ideals
How you got her walkin' along the stroll in high heels?
He said her mamma was gettin' old
God bless her poor soul, now no more drama is your role
Straight to the head
He know a lot of haters can't wait 'til he dead
Lead to gold, like a ho to a strange whack housewife
Only thing he know: it changes back though, how trife
Rules is rules, don't go there
Stay on sale like a old coat made of mohair
Keep a snotty chicken on E, the Lone Ranger
Why everybody always pickin' on Danger?
And DOOM, maybe it's him
Called up my lady, told her ""Baby, it's slim""
Make me up a margarita, I need to take a swim
Tell them kids remember school - if they let 'em out, cool
But get the hell from out the pool
[Outro: Master Shake]
Hey {​shit}-head, it's me again!
And you know what? I just heard, IT'S ALL DONE NOW!
And somehow, I guess you must have lost my number
You know what?! YOU SUCK!
YOU SUCK! YOUR MUSIC SUCKS!
AND I HATE YOUR SUCKY STUPID METAL FACE!
I hope you burn, you're going down
This is the last big mistake, you'll ever make
YOU SUCK! I HATE YOUR GUTS!

Or even a stroke, heart attack, heart disease
It ain't no starting back once arteries start to squeeze
Take the easy way out phony, until then
They know they wouldn't be talking that baloney in the bullpen
So disgusting, pardon self as I discuss this
They talk a wealth of {shit} and they ain't never seen the justice

Bust this, like a cold milk from out the toilet
Two batteries some Brillo and some foil, he'a boil it
He be better off on PC glued
And it's a feud, so don't be in no TV mood
Each week it's mystery meat, seaweed stewed

But all the while
You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time
[Chorus]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller tonight

[Bridge]
Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
They're open wide
This is the end of your life, ooh

[Verse 3]
They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side (Ooh)
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see
[Chorus]
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller, here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller (Ow!)

[Outro: Vincent Price & Michael Jackson]
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ooh, babe (Thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller night)
Thriller, oh, darling (Oh, baby)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller)
Ooh, babe (Thriller night)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller)
Oh, darling (Oh, baby)
Thriller night, babe (Thriller night, babe)
Ooh
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"
Pale Kid Raps Fast,Watsky,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse]
O, hai! I'm that guy, built so fly in a silk bow tie
Don't know why I'm built so fly
But I am, no lie—oh my!
Rolled by on a lowride Huffy
Sitting on the pegs, shelltoes puffy
Cuff rolled up to my calf
Class out the ass, bad with the swag like Buffy
Gotta be the one to bite the bullet
I'm a sinner, but I bet I could've been a better man
I wanna be Zen, but I go sippin' on some medicine
Instead of meditating, but I get it when I can
I don't wanna wind up in the gutter with a bottle of malt
Liquor, bitter 'cause I never got a call
Telling me that it's all figured out
I'm sick of doubt, but I'm looking at the wall
Part of me was hoping to be caught up in the moment
And be open to the good and the God in me
But I got a lobotomy
And I get that I oughta become a bit of an oddity
When somebody gets offended by the thought of me
""Who's he?"" …You gotta be kidding me!
Do me like Gabourey Sidibe
If you see me with a chickadee
No diggity, it'll be giggity giggity giggity
Gonna send it like a letter from above
With a woman that I love, 'cause I get it like I live
But if my baby's gay, I'll say: ""You go, gay baby
Work that crib! Work that bib! Burp that kid!
Screw police! Flip that car!""
I don't want a Jesus piece
But I want a Reese's Piece and a Kit Kat Bar
I want everybody focusing on getting me to Letterman
To kick it for the betterment
Of innocent Americans who never want to settle
For their pop… or not, 'cause my bedroom rocks
And the beat still knocks when I sort my socks
I'm five-foot-eleven of sex
From the tip of my head to my gorgeous... knees

Who is that boy? How does he rap so good?
I don't know how that pale boy raps so good
How does he do that? Do that?

You ready to do this, nigga?
You ready to come down here?
It's Virginia, nigga
We do this in broad daylight
It's a whole different degree of homicide, nigga
You ready?

[Hook: Pusha T & Pharrell]
I'm from Virginia, where ain't shit to do but cook (talkin' 'bout what?)
Pack it up, sell it triple price, fuck the books (talkin' 'bout what?)
Where we re-up, re-locate, we off them rooks (talkin' 'bout what?)
So when we pull up, it ain't shit to do but look (talkin' 'bout what?)

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
In my home sweet home, I keep chrome next to my bones
Alters my walk to limpin', since I love the feel
I guess I'm passionately pimpin', it 'tis what it seems
That thing imprintin' through the seam of my jeans, by all means
Lost it all, from lives to love
But my faith and my money helped me rise above
See I turned to the Lord when them times got tough
Bullied through the streets, powder I pushed and shoved
In that ol' Virginny, out of ten niggas, nine are guinea
No money, all they know is gimme
Got semis waitin', heat like Caribbean summers
I been there, each year, a different bitch wonder
Who wing she gon' fall under, Push' or Mal', Gonz or Grimes
With me, with thoughts of fuckin' them cross her mind
Look ma, that's right up my alley
I love my family, I want them all happy
In Virginia, we smirked at that Simpson trial
Yeah, I guess the chase was wild, but what's the fuss about?
See, plenty my partners feelin' like OJ
Beat murder like the shit is okay, that's what our dough say
Talk the evil that men do, I'm lost in the mental
I miss you Shampoo, we miss you Shampoo
And your grams too...

[Verse 2: Malice]
Seem like they all got a comment to make
In regards to my paper, now they guessin' my weight
They fast to predict the outcome of my fate
Wonderin' 'bout Clipse and if they got what it take
""Malice, he think he hard, tough guy of the clique
And Pusha, he walk around like he swear he the shit""
You right on both counts, bitch, Clipse is us
And there are some things that you don't discuss
Don't ask me 'bout the Neptunes and what's they fare
Don't ask about the loud screamin' chick with the hair
Don't ask about my music, and how that's comin' 'bout
Don't ask about my album, or when's it comin' out
'Cause I feel like you really being funny on the sly
Now face down, layin' on your tummy or you die
I tried being humble, humble get no respect
Now the first sign of trouble, that's a hole up in your neck
Plus what I look like spendin' my nights in jail?
I could never be a thug, they don't dress this well
I reside in VA, ride in VA
Most likely when I die, I'm gon' die in VA
Virginia's for lovers, but trust there's hate here
For out-of-towners, who think that they gon' move weight here
Ironic, the same place I'm makin' figures at
That there's the same land they used to hang niggas at, in Virginia

Moment For Life,RUSSELL!,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","This is for radio stations that hated my songs
They say "" yo Russell never try, youre﻿ a try hard ""
This is for you guys, knockin' my loose pride
Open your eyes, but you can't cause they're too wide
You're just a poor asian, you'll never make cake
You're a swagger jacker, you're a fake Drake
For those dude who beat me up, thinkin they're tough
To all you people sayin "" dude get your haircut ""
In this moment number one is my goal
The moon is my brain and the sun is my soul
So I'mma keep grindin till the day I see heaven
Till then I'mma just make these songs and go gold, maybe platinum
In this game in this sport
It's me, Phili , Dj Suss and Baby J on the court
Against every other labels tryna clash cuz they're enemies
So basically it's Mars Music versus the industry
Shout to my friends back home right beside me
If I change cause of the industry, remind me
Cause you know me, so please keep mind
Because in theses lines it's Russel then D-Pryde
Momma's really proud on the what we're all about
I love you momma dukes, I promise you a house
And know that ain't a joke, I'm rhyming till I drop
Mount Everest high and I'm still climbing to the top
This time I'll never stop, I'm playin' this right
I remember what J said that really changed my life
He said "" you gotta find a job that absolutely love and when you'll find it, you'll never work a day in your life ""
And that's true J, true say
Since then I looked at music in a new way
Haters hate me like the day before tuesday
Reppin Canada like Blue Jays and Bublé.. uhh
They keep callin' me the new Drake
Haters flyin in the air like a bouquet
Right above the one but I'm never at a zero
And I'm reppin for the asian cuz we never had a hero
Put your glass up, I'm up and higher
Still drinkin' Arizona like I'm sponsored by them
This is for my family, growing like an apple tree
For my mother that had to witness my daddy leave
Like I had to be, but I'mma keep movin'
Shout out to all of my fans who loved my sweet music
And how I speak thru it, who think I'm kinda tight

Replacement Girl,Drake,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'jazz', 'blues']","[Intro: Trey Songz]
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement

[Verse 1: Drake & Trey Songz]
Let me show you what it is
I was birthed up top but was raised at the bottom of the map
Where the girls all thick and the hottest niggas rap
If you lookin' for the good then we got 'em in the trap like, ooh wee
Took 'em from white sneaks to Louis
This metaphor might sound a little confusin' but
Y'all don't really know me if you know me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I done come all way from the Days Inn
And all the hotels that I stayed in
And I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good
And now I say it's sittin' at amazin'
Girls tryna SoHo lobby us
Hear 'em all screamin' then it's probably us
But I can't blame females
Females can't really ignore somethin' this obvious
What you really expect when I strut through town?
Two or three days, I shut you down
Chilin' with the homie Trey Songz
You call him the prince, he rep two up, two down
Anyone I know get used to me
I'm far from the man that I used to be
And I don't ever really kick game
I know you find it impressive whenever you introduced to me
'Cause I'm a good dude who take pride in that
Need good lovin' I'm providin' that
Understand that I'm worldwide, you get it how you want it wherever you be residin' at
'Cause I do things from the M-town
To the UK and from Spain back out to Texas
This album's for my fans, but, yo, this hook is for my exes
[Chorus: Trey Songz]
This one is for you girl, you know who you are girl
You only show your face 'cause you know that I'm a star girl
What you tryna to make it, don't ever mistake it
Girl, my time is limited and I ain't tryna waste it all on you
You had a chance, now it's gone, gone for you
Oh, you had a man now you don't, now you don't
Back to the basics, I think I made it
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Ain't ya never seen a youngin' so fly? (Probably not)
Lookin' for someone your type
I done left behind the love of my life (She gone)
Tryna find another one tonight
And if it's you baby, let yourself be seen
Don't matter skirts, dresses or jeans
I got that work, know what I mean
And I'm flexin' on my ex if you know what I mean

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
This one is for you girl, you know who you are girl
You only show your face 'cause you know that I'm a star girl
What you tryna to make it, don't ever mistake it
Girl, my time is limited and I ain't tryna waste it all on you
You had a chance, now it's gone, gone for you
Oh, you had a man now you don't
Back to the basics, I think I made it
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl
[Verse 3: Drake]
With the other dudes she get picked for some take out
Until they slip up and then they break out
But it's another story over here at Drake's house
'Cause I'm dripped up and I'm draped out
And I'm leaned back, scopin'
Lookin' for a woman that I should wife
Who got just the right amount of loyalty
Yeah but is still anticipatin' us livin' the good life
We go LA, VA, NY, TO
Sunshine and that heatstroke
And them fur hoods in that deep snow
We have breakfast in the bedroom
Break bread downstairs in the basement
Since Jay and Kellz ain't doin' they thing no more
Guess me and the boy Songz the replacement

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
This one is for you girl, you know who you are girl
You only show your face 'cause you know that I'm a star girl
What you tryna to make it, don't ever mistake it
Girl, my time is limited and I ain't tryna waste it all on you
You had a chance, now it's gone, gone for you
Oh, you had a man now you don't , now you don’t

Leaving the Past,Immortal Technique,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
They told me I would never make it, I would never achieve it
Reality is nourishment, but people don't believe it
I guess it's hard to stomach the truth like a bulimic
It's a dirty game and nobody is willin' to clean it
But this is for the paraplegic people dreamin' of runnin'
Ladies married to men who don't please 'em, dreamin' of comin'
Verbally murderous like David Berkowitz when I'm gunnin'
Some cowards on the Internet didn't think I would sell
Scared to talk shit in person 'cause they stuck in a shell
And couldn't understand the pain of bein' stuck in a cell
Hell is not a place you go if you're not a Christian
It's the failure of your life's greatest ambition
It's a bad decision to blindly follow any religion
I don't see the difference in between the wrong and the wrong
Soldiers emptyin' the clips at little kids and they moms
Are just like a desperate motherfucker strapped to a bomb
Humanity's gone, smoked up in a gravity bong
By a Democrat-Republican Cheech and Chong
Immortal Technique, you never heard me preach in a song
I'm not controversial, I'm just speakin' the facts
Put your hands in the air like you got the heat to your back
And shake your body like a baby born addicted to crack
And since life's a gamble like the craps tables at Vegas
I freestyle my destiny, it's not written in pages
[Trumpet Solo]

[Verse 2]
I hate it when they tell us how far we came to be
As if our people's history started with slavery
Painfully I discovered the shit they kept a secret
This is the exodus, like the black Jews out of Egypt
I keep it reality based with the music I make
Blow up the truth in your face with the style I run with
Like the Navy missile that shot down Flight 800
I'm like the Africans who came here before Columbus
And from the 1500s until after the morrow
I watched Latin America get raped in the sorrow
You see, the Spaniards never left después de Colon
And if you don't believe me, you can click on Univision
I never seen so much racism in all of my life
Every program and newscast, all of 'em white
It's like apartheid with 10 percent rulin' the rest
That type of stress'll make me put the fuckin' tool to your chest
Step in my way, nigga, I wouldn't wanna be ya
I burn slow like pissin' drunk with gonorrhea
I'll do a free show in North Korea, burnin' the flag
While J. Edgar Hoover politicians dress up in drag
Tryna confuse you, makin' it hard to follow this:
Capitalism and democracy are not synonymous
You swallow propaganda like a birth control pill
Sellin' your soul to the eye on the back of the dollar bill
But that'll never be me 'cause I'm leavin' the past
Like an abused wife with the kids, leavin' your ass
Like a drug addict clean and sober, leavin' the stash
Unbreakable Technique, leavin' the plane crash
I'm out with the black box and I refuse to return
I spit reality instead of what you usually learn
And I refuse to be concerned with condescending advice
'Cause I'm the only motherfucker that could change my life
[Trumpet Solo]

[Outro]
Some people think I won't make it, but I know that I will
Escape the emptiness 'cause that shit is slow and it kills
The flow and the skill, I made y'all believe it at last
You can make the future, but it starts with leavin' the past

Yeah, uhh, yeah!

[Verse 1]
Use the eyes of the owl, there's a fowl batch
The sour patch kids got me out of wack
And out of gas, the hourglass
Spills as I'm left on the vast sea without a vest
Lost my train of thought, my brain cannot be bought
Trained to train and co-operate with authorit-ay
No way Jose the Che in May
Revolutionary - to the leaders I'm scary
I pose a threat to those who get too close for comfort, and won't conform
Come forward, sworn on my unborn son
If there's one more war I will come for
The poor get poor, the rich just get richer
Get the jist, you see the big picture?
China's ditched from a shake on the Richter
Mother Earth shrugs and we all get evicted
This some sick shit, slightly twisted
Information from our nation's capital
Capitol is all the captain calls for
They just want more (and more)
And more (and more) and more (and more?)
And more (and more) and more (and more!)

Can you turn it up just a little bit?
Can you turn it up? Can you turn it up?

My people crying and be dying, they be dining in the islands
Drinking wine with they wives like everything is fine
Denying that they fighting for the lives every night
To survive since the beginning of time
I-yi-yi, can't believe the evil that feeds
Off this so-called American dream
Lies and deceit make all the Americans seem
Like blood-suckin money hungry fiends
But money doesn't mean a damn thing to me
I just want to be, I want to be free
But unfortunately a fortune is what you need
'Cause the Fortune 500's run the country
It's one company if you're not in company
Would you mind grabbin' me a cup of tea? (Thanks)
If we go hung-r-y in our own country
I wonder what it's like, living in Hungary
Yeah it isn't funny but it's coming, it's about to get ugly
Streets turn to a game of rugby (Y'all don't hear me though)

Take me away
Take me away from here
Take me away from evil

Can you turn it up just a little bit?
Can you turn it up just a little bit?
Can you turn it up? Can you turn it up?

We're buying bubbly and make it rain hundreds
Is it just me or is that some dumb shit?
Yo what the fuck, ho comes, little dumb shit
Let's go I know you can think of something
Donate your dollars, raise a toddler, help a mother, save a father
'Cause poverty is probably our biggest problem
And it ain't gon' stop with Obama (Nah)
To save the world we must start at the bottom (Got it)
Bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom
Bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom

Take me away from here
Take me away from evil

13th Floor/Growing Old,OutKast,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Big Rube]
Conceive true deception multiplied a million fold
Visualize the yin and yang in a battle so intense
That we get em confused
The resident evil specialize in misconstruing
We wanna be at a presidential level—what are we doing?
Fooling ourselves, clowning ourselves, playing ourselves
By not being ourselves
We can't babble no more than we can bob our head offbeat
Nimrod by the time we forty cause we can't get off meat
While we ask no reason for the misplacement of the season
Look at the picture that's painted
Tainted as the mind who's blinded to the point
Where Sodomites get all the rights
We fall for fights with fisticuffs
Get pissed enough to miss the bus
It disgusts me to see my folks run up on
I say stand upon this section of time marked Revelations
And recognize this mind-numbing reality of horror
Known as mankind
Jesus and his twelve disciples make thirteen
A righteous number of righteous men
Even Judas the Betrayer came true in the end
The Devil say the end is the beginning
They teach that we were the product of incest
Invest no level of self into their system of Paganomics
Stand with us and don't look back upon it
Just face this mindstate
Otherwise Babylon

I bet you never heard of a playa with no game
Told the truth to get what I want, but shot it with no shame
Take this music dead serious while others entertain
I see they're making their paper so I guess I can't complain
Or can I? I feel they're disrespecting the whole thang
Them hooks like selling dope to black folks
And I choke when the food they serving ain't tasting right
My stomach can't digest it even when I bless it
I'm confessing one more lesson from the South, we in the house tonight
Now hootie who wants to oppose? Suppose
We rolls through Headland and Delowe
Where me and my niggas would pass the flow
And got down for ours like hind catchers
My mind catches flashbacks to the black past
While mind close niggas laugh at
The Southern slang, finger waves and Mojo chicken wangs
I grew up on booty shake we did not know no better thang
So go 'head and, diss it, while real hop-hippers listen
Started by Afrika Bambaata, so you and your partner
Gather your thoughts

Uhh, born Antwan Patton but my partners they call me Big Boi
It's the nigga the B-I-G, be speaking the truth not talking that shit boy
I'm thinking of checking my traps and busting my raps
And throwing them craps
7 Eleven is no convenience, you pumping your gas but watching your back
For the robbing crew; thinking they're robbing you, you must be cautious
To staying up on your game and pimping these crows, you must be flawless
Like Mortal Kombat, but fucking these wombats got you dizzy
My nigga you know if I wanna be playin
But runnin up on me like you miss me
You catching the wrong vibe, packing your shit and rolling your eyes back
Flexin up on the corner tossin your dice and rollin your Cadillac
But man it seems I'm reaching out and touching the wrong nigga
Don't expect it to be pimping get your index off the trigger
As we bust, us, we leavin em in the dust
So keep that caine up out of your nose
I said my piece and then I hush
As the calendar keeps flippin', niggas dippin'

Our dearly beloved, we are gathered like soap is to lather we come clean
Some issues need to be addressed like envelopes I mean
Oh, like Liberty Bells, yes them bullets keep on ringing
On fire like the Georgia Mass Choir, we keep on sanging
Bringing our folks closer together cause they severed us from the get green
Light and we ain't gon' stop until we hit the big screen
Psych, because no one is free when others are oppressed
So, we hit the stage and then we fly back to our nest
Growing old

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Like some eagles, people don't understand
Just like their parents don't be caring
I'm speaking bout you playing with that phony stuff you sharing
In your raps Mercedes Benz and all your riches
Thinking you got it but get it, get it but you ain't pimping no bitches
'Cause you flauging; falling like leaves into driveways
Isn't it lovely smoking good and sloppy head on highways
Fridays are tight but Saturday just makes it old
Winter nights are hot warm enough to feed your soul
Growing old

See all them leaves must fall down, growing old

First blunts, cuttin' class
First wifey had me nuttin' fast
Used to brag about who I had
Always wore a bag on my dick
Pants sagged on my kicks
Converse weapons, yellow, and purple magics
Bird had that black shit
Shorties jumpin' on mattress
'97, pockets is fat, rock a stockin' cap
Under Yankee hats
God, painted me black, thanks for that
I'm original man
Show improve the mack move right in my hand
Blow dro, murderer M.O., gone for O
Tinted window, Hennessy XO, fuckin' wit Esco
Heavy metal can wet you, yo bless you
Jail niggas go ta hell quicker
Lick you with that huntin' shot
Rockin' VVS rocks, stylin', wildin'
Peace to Queensbridge housin'
Congratulate Flex, five-hundred thousand sold
Fuckin' better than gold, nigga"
Kill,Earl Sweatshirt,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Aw, nigga thought he killed me?
Alright, that's cool, we'll see

[Verse 1]
Strict top of the crop shit
Crushin' muthafuckas like moths in a mosh pit
Dollar cents since shit, sense I ain't lost it
It's in a fuckin' jar with guitar picks and bar spit
Bar spat, past tense, warriors of radness
Fuck lame, get it through your brain like dad's dick
Go ahead, stab a friend, tell him that I'm back, bitch
Earl leave bastards with milkiest asses
Take a firm standin', nine on the tracklist
Earl half the reason the reviews fantastic
Niggas gettin' comfy on the couch, I ain't havin' it
Kickin' gluteus maximus, killin' niggas on accident

[Hook]
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all
Just watch, off 'em!
[Verse 2]
Off 'em, no off days, no debates, bitch
Box logo switchblade, and cocaine
In my back pocket, take Jade on vacation
The hotel switch from Heartbreak to Bates quick
Rippin' out braids with bare hands amazes
The crowd go crazy, hands raised, I'm laced with
Swag by the eighth in case you wanna taste it
Faggots wear Prada, Satan wears RMK shit
Hell's angel, crack Christ 'cross the face
With erasers and use Based God as his replacement
Super Saiyan with ruthless slayings
Eat puss, sweet puss got my tooth decayin'

[Hook]
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all
Just watch, off 'em!

[Verse 3]
Now pan the cameras back to me and Pamela's
Amateur threesome with Hannah Montana's manager
And Miley feedin' me sandwiches for my stamina
And Santa's in the back laughin' cause my back's crampin' up
Mrs. Claus trippin' balls, think she had enough
And by enough I mean we dope as fuck, she had a gram of us
Flyer than your man because I'm lampin' up
At the airport smokin' hash with all the fuckin' baggage handlers
Flowin' like the mothafuckin' aqueducts
Odd Future Wolf Gang, fag damagers, bitch, eat a dick"
U Black Maybe,Common,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: Bilal]
Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybe...

[Verse 1: Common]
I heard a white man's yes is a black maybe
I was delivered in this world as a crack baby
Hard for me to pay attention and I act crazy
Gotta get over from the tip, I watch the fat lady
Sing a song, on how we guerillas in warfare
And I'm the kingest kong
They say we dreaming wrong
Them same strips that them older cats lingered on
Now the Walgreens is gone, hope is killed fiends are born
We leanin on a wall that ain't that ain't stable
It's hard to turn on the hood that made you
To leave we afraid to
The same streets that raised you can age you
With other black birds that's caged too
A rage up in Harlem and the southside
Brothers is starving with their mouth wide open
Floating across state got the workout plans so they can move weight
The fate of the black man, woman, and child: maybe
[Hook: Bilal]
Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind

[Verse 2: Common]
He had game since he used to hoop at Chatham
Neither the ghetto nor defenders could trap him
The stones had his back and they'd pat him
He was living a life they couldn't fathom
Colleges getting at him with all type of scholarships
Even if he went they knew he'd leave college quick
For the pros the one from the hood that was chose
The black rose that grew in the jungle
But humble stud still had rumble in his blood
Women all around giving him trouble love
You know the love when you up they down
Cause you wrap a ball they round
Your win is their crown
Dudes in the circle he known for years
Shared beers and cheers but chose different careers
When paper and fame came they ain't know how to react
Them same studs shot him in the back
Now that's black...maybe

Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside

[Interlude: Common]
When we talk about black maybe
We talk about situations
Of people of color and because you are that color
You endure obstacles and opposition
And not all the time from... from other nationalities
Sometimes it come from your own kind
Or maybe even your own mind
You get judged..you get laughed at... you get looked at wrong
You get sighted for not being strong
The struggle of just being you
The struggle of just being us... black maybe
Black maybe...

[Hook: Bilal]
Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind

Sagaba,Blue Scholars,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Sister sits on the steps
Cigarette rests on fingertips
Takes a sip of slow death deftly through her lips
She blows a kiss
Which I can only resist in vain
She got the gift of gravity pulling to ask her name
She says, ""Sagaba""
What's it mean? She says, ""In Ilocano
It translates into suffering.""
I'm pondering the irony to conjure up the fearlessness to find a conversation
She offers me a square, I decline the invitation
It reminds me of the days when I would chain smoke
Broken with no hope
Like broken like the manner she spoke
We both
Two people seeking
Solace and remembrance
And wondering if miracles were meant for us
But intent was just an innocent thought between a sister and a brother
Who been building in the guidance of a mother
And the storyteller stops
Waiting for the beat to drop
Gathering his thoughts in the wind, breathing in like...
[Verse 2]
Now
I couldn't stand to see the queen breathe her dreams away
And tell me her tomorrow will never become today
I say I used to know a woman just like you
Beautiful but jaded by the multitude of men who'd often try to
Justify their lies with twisted notions of survival
And hide behind their armor when karma completes a cycle
She replied
That just because I knew a woman well it doesn't mean I know them all
She begins to bade farewell
Eyes up to the sky, she sighs, I need nobody
True indeed, sister, but you still need everybody because
We hardly know ourselves if we know nobody else
And only in our loneliness can home become a hell
Exhale
The cloud in the loudest form of silence
Watches as it rises like suns over horizons
The storyteller stops
Waiting for the beat to drop
Gathering his thoughts in the cloud, breathing out like...

[Verse 3]
Dreams be the ashes
Burns and thrashing in the wind
Flying out the burning bush attached to sister's hand
Who whispers, ""word""
Smiling and giving thanks, living in doubt no longer
As she figures out the riddle to the song
Saying why must we suffer now to not suffer later if later
Never comes soon enough to soothe the hatred
And hatred
Is the cancer born out of love's absence
And the absence is the void left from missing every chance to
Challenge our fates and perhaps our very names
Sister says peace and prayers for rain and change
Tosses out her lighter
Walks out of the cipher
For shizzle it starts to drizzle and then I begin to write this
Inhale the imagery a queen walking steadily
Effortlessly
Ready to be
Every woman and now the
Story teller ends
Waiting for the beat to fade
Gathering his thought near the edge of the day like..."
The Realest,Mobb Deep,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Prodigy & Kool G Rap]
This the killa's shit, dun
No doubt, the undisputed

[Chorus: Prodigy & Kool G Rap]
For street niggas living with they lives on the line
For young guns coming up during these times
For police that find drugs let niggas slide
For niggas out slinging like 4 in the night
For your mans not snitching when the pressure is tight
For pistols that don't jam when it's time to strike
For bootleg liquor on a Sunday night
This be the realest shit you heard in your life

[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
Yo, when the gats reveal you cats get peeled
And that's the deal
Fuck a bitch-ass that switch fast niggas that lack the real
When the slugs burst
G Rap be aiming at your mug first
Niggas is blood thirst, we'll see who get plugged worst
We dug earth, the place we put the nickel-plate is to your facial
Bullets ain't racial, kid, they only hate you
My nine'll seem like it's a time machine, B.C. date you
Jacking you more than Ripper
My fifth's an organ shifter, the human organism lifter
You'll be hearing organs if ya leaving orphans, if ya
Let these fours hit ya where the Lord split ya
I forbid ya..to bump heads with those that dump lead
Accurate shots in back of your knot
Leave you one dead, G Rap, Havoc and Prodigy
Let's put these bitch niggas
Where bodies be dun, yo if it gotta be, it gotta be

For street niggas living with they lives on the line

For bootleg liquor on a Sunday night
This be the realest shit you heard in your life

[Verse 2: Havoc]
When the gat spit some niggas get blown off the atlas
It happens unsolved mystery re-enactments
Get practiced what you lack is you think like the average
Jake stoop down and leaving crime scenes entangled
Nothing but cannons get conspicuous
Like a man a little branded with the serial scratched
Bad apple out of the batch, dun they made me like that
If I could push back the clock probably leave it like that
Draw blood for my nigga G.O.D, Ty Nitty and Twin
And Twin is not here plus my kin
Killa B forever with me, quick to settle with me
Into QB to show love throughout the years with me
You got guns we got guns the serious ones
Leaving foul powder stuck in your lungs
We come from where niggas look out for they dun-duns
Love, never disrespect, hit niggas with re-direct

For street niggas living with they lives on the line
For young guns coming up during these times
For police that find drugs let niggas slide

For pistols that don't jam when it's time to strike
For bootleg liquor on a Sunday night
This be the realest shit you heard in your life

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Never prejudge, it be the humble that squeeze slugs
It be the ones standing still that'll peel guns
Spill blood for my dunns thugging for me
Man you don't wanna get involved fucking with P
I spent more nights illing, less nights chilling
The more shots they hold the better they feel it
What be the deal is some killers like to hide behind specs
Others got blatant disrespecting and the rest
Or so young that you wouldn't even expect
To be bursting off guns like a Vietnam vet
On the steps, sitting in the staircase bent
Thinking on ways to take another man's head
Go to war with niggas that's against what I rep
I settle things with a heavy metal fifth
Change clips, switch clothes after I spit
Place niggas back in they space, fuck is on your mind kid
[Chorus: Prodigy & Kool G Rap]
For street niggas living with they lives on the line
For young guns coming up during these times
For police that find drugs let niggas slide
For niggas out slinging like 4 in the night
For your mans not snitching when the pressure is tight
For pistols that don't jam when it's time to strike
For bootleg liquor on a Sunday night
This be the realest shit you heard in your life"
The Lounge,Asher Roth,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Pete Rockwell & Asher Roth]
Johnny, get on the piano, let's do this
Thirty years in the business...
What's up? What's up?
I want to welcome everybody to the Lounge
You know
You've heard of Rapper's Delight? Well, I'm delightful (Cannon)
I got my buddy Asher Roth with me, straight out of the Philadelphia, PA
Here's a little Ham 'N' Eggs coming right at you (The Cannon)

[Asher Roth]
Yo, I got a question (What's that?)
What's a rapper look like? Is he tan? Is he black? White?
Is he blacked out, high on the crack pipe?
Or more the cats that'll ride on the half-pipe?
Don't want to act like I know about the rap type
'Cause matter of fact I can't grasp who rap likes
With their cash do they stash for retirement?
Or go for finer things like rides and diamonds?

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
Yo, I got a question (What's that?)
What's a rapper look like? Is he tan? Is he black? White?
Is he blacked out, high on the crack pipe?
Or more the cats that'll ride on the half-pipe?
Don't want to act like I know about the rap type
'Cause matter of fact I can't grasp who rap likes
With their cash do they stash for retirement?
Or go for finer things like rides and diamonds?
Another question (What's that?)
How do they dress?
Are they best cut threads or are they spend less?
I'm interested, it's caught my attention
Yo, does everybody in rap get arrested?
And with they sex, do they all have hoes?
Or do some have a girl that they learn and they grow with?
I'd like to know, what makes a rapper?
It might be me, but I don't think it matters
[Hook]
What does he look like? Nobody knows
He's just a rapper in plain clothes
And when the curtain falls, after the show
Where does he go? Nobody knows

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
Yo, now it's your call, short, fat, or tall?
What if he's a she and not a he at all?
Or does a broad have to a be a C at least?
Or can it be decreased if she real up on the beat?
And is she realer if she raised in the street?
Or can they still feel her if she raised in CT?
And if they spit do they have to have kids?
Or can they have a mom, a dad, and little sis?
And in the morning do they have to have grits?
Or can they favorite breakfast be eggs Benedict?
It makes me think, is there a rapping type?
And if so, yo, what's a rapper like?
And do they sell drugs, or go to school?
Cocaine or college, tell me what's the rule
I'd like to know, what makes a rapper?
It might be me, but I don't think it matters

[Hook]
What does he look like? Nobody knows
He's just a rapper in plain clothes
And when the curtain falls, after the show
Where does he go? Nobody knows
[Verse 3: Asher Roth]
My name's Asher (Hi, Asher)
And those who care to ask, I tell them I'm a rapper (A rapper)
But I don't look like it, not one bit
I'm short and thin with some pale-ass skin (That's right)
Got one girlfriend and I love her
With two sisters, a father, and a mother
I guess I'm different, like no other
But you can't judge a book by it's cover
I write about what I feel, see, live
My boys like to say I'm the realist it gets
Sometimes I feel like Boston gets
Maybe flip the script on some ROY-G-BIV
Whatever the mood, no matter what I listen to
I always do me, never do you
I'd like to know, what makes a rapper?
It might be me, but I don't think it matters

[Hook]
What does he look like? Nobody knows
He's just a rapper in plain clothes
(Johnny, I'm loving that piano)
And when the curtain falls, after the show
Where does he go? Nobody knows

[Outro: Pete Rockwell]
Oh yeah, once again this is Pete Rockwell, Asher Roth
The Leopard Lounge, everyone, in the back room
Gets a little pep in your step
As the homies say, ""This thing is jamming""
Pour me another Scotch, Margot
I'm just loving this right now
Thirty years in the business, still banging out the hits
This is Pete Rockwell, baby, Asher Roth, signing off"
Game Time,Lupe Fiasco,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","(Verse One: Lupe Fiasco)

As I gently pull up on the scene
I feel like ammunition for a sling shot
I'm trying to get triple sevens on my slot machine
And knuckle up with time like a ring watch
With no wings, hustle man, sitting in rubber band
A Dennis the Menace's weapon of choice with the windows of his soul
Dead intended on the tinted windows of a Rolls
Broken glass on the driver's seat of a Royce
Now how am I supposed to sit for Mister Wilson Drop a dime
Before another penny is spent on this game
Before I cough up the cost and invest another thought
I walk without my bucket of change
But I'm poor, materially speaking so
I can't be leaving this casino, with less than a c-note
Even if it takes a grand to get it I ride
Just to see that my Sedan has been vandalized

(Hook: Lupe Fiasco)
Game time, don't get caught up in the magic keep your brain right
Cause things ain't what they seem like
It don't matter what they say just get the name right
Now that's L as in little, and U as opposite of me
And P as in Pistol and E as in...E
Now players say that boy walking like a man
Treat you like you fam' and talking like a G

(Verse Two: Lupe Fiasco)

Now this is art, taylor made
Sharp, wrists'll kill razor blades
I do my part, chill like barber of Seville
Homie, it's like I'm paid to fade
Turn around and pay my dues with the wages made
Then I tip like what a waitress paid
I'm a ghetto super star
Hand prints chillin' and my name written where the pavement lay
Turn around and place my shoes where the name engraved
Then my game is played, 'till I'm rain delayed
Now thats my zone, far from an actor homes
Like a star map, this a G talking like Sesame Street
Referee the beats that I'm rapping on
They trying to de-rail my train of thought
But I'm Bruce Willis, ya'll don't feel it
While you break yourself like a car jack
This is hard black, like where my palms at
(Hook)

(Verse Three: Lupe Fiasco)
Now back to my scrap with time
My tat with the tickin', I make my fists
Wrap my wrist, leave the ring on, I could never get enough
Punch my clock
Clock my grip
Niggas tryin' to pull my card, stop my shift
Shift me to that graveyard and knock my hustle
They hope I Domino and free up my delivery
And at the same time mark my magnificence
I'm just trying to do the opposite of left
As long as there is the opposite of death
You test, and I might just bring the opposite of life
Till there's no one the opposite of right
Check!
As you bop down writer's block and can't find it...
I address, I correct
You a dress, I'm a pair of pants
I'm a Motorola, you just a pair of cans
Couple Coca Colas and a string
Playa I'm 'bout my green like Martian's skin
A sinner on a side-walk
They Wavin' to from the floats in a parade
The Saint's Go Marchin' In"
The Show,Doug E. Fresh & The Get Fresh Crew,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen
The most exciting stage show you've ever witnessed
Appearing live, Doug E Fresh and the Get Fresh Crew
(Oh my God!)

[Doug & Rick; Both]
Excuse me Doug E Fresh
Yes?
Have you ever seen a show with fellas on the mic
With one minute rhymes that don't come out right
They bite, they never write, that's not polite
Am I lying?
No, you're quite right
Well tonight on this very mic you're about to hear
We swear, the best darn rappers of the year
So, so, cheerio, yell, scream bravo
Also, if you didn't know this is called The Show

[Doug & Rick]
A-yo Doug
What?
Put your Ballys on
Yo Rick, I was about to but I need a shoe horn
Why?
Because these shoes always hurt my corns
Six minutes...
Six minutes...
Six minutes Doug E Fresh you're on
Uh uh on, uh uh on, uh-huh-uh-huh-uh uh uh on
Uh uh on, uh uh on, uh-huh-uh-huh-uh uh uh on
Uh uh on
(Is it real?)

[Doug & Rick]
Here we go (here we go) come on (come on)
Here we go (here we go) come on (come on)
Yo, where's Will and Barr?
Well I don't know they're late
Told 'em the time, oh I forgot the date
Man, you did it again, oh no
Yo, here we go, come on, here we go, come on
Here we go, did you miss the show
No, no, no-no-no no we didn't

No we didn't, well don't get us wrong
Excuse me Doug E...
Excuse me Doug E...
Excuse me Doug E Fresh you're on
Uh uh on

[Doug E Fresh]
Well it started off on 8th Avenue
When I made up the name called the Get Fresh Crew
It was me, my two DJs Chill Will and Barry B
And my right hand man Ricky D
I used to rap and sing, make sounds and things
And for example, here's a telephone ring
*Ring, ring* Hello, is Doug E Fresh in?
No, he's not in right now *click*

But anyway, no more delay
Just check out the new style I display
Now you got to be (fresh)
To rock with (fresh)
And I'm D-O-U-G-I-E (fresh)
And I'm known for the... *Doug E Fresh beatbox*
Not for the... *Fat Boys beatbox*
The human beat box or the entertainer
No other title can fit me plainer
In a passing generation, I am a remainer
And I'm also known as the beatbox trainer
Cashing checks, make sound effects
And after I finish rocking, Slick Rick is on next
(You know it) Slick Rick!

[Slick Rick]
Well, here's a little something that needs to be heard
Doug, I was going downtown (word, Rick?) Word!
(Sure) all alone, no one to be with
Stepped on the D-Train at 205th
I saw a pretty girl (so?) so I sat beside her
Then she went roar like she was Tony the Tiger
I said hold on, there's been a mistake
Honey, my name's Slick Rick not Frostie Flakes
(Oh, golly wolly) Cause she was raising hell
She said, um, my name is Maggie but call me Michelle
Michelle, my belle
Sont des mots qui vont tres bien ensemble
Tres bien ensemble
Slick Rick and I'm rocking the house you know I'm saying
And when I'm on the mic there won't be no delaying
Bust a move, we show and prove
A-yo Doug, do that record Jam On The Groove
[Outro: Doug E Fresh]
As you can see, most definitely, we are (fresh)
Chill Will (fresh)
Barry B (fresh)
Ricky D (fresh)
And I am the original human beat box, the entertainer, Doug E (fresh)"

Nigga, I've been getting my share in like Sonny Bono
I ran the streets... check my bio

But I'm so DC like fat shoes
I skate away, like ""Later dudes""
Never get caught, baby, I'm mashed potato smooth
And just when it stopped, I made it move
Respect me nigga I'm a dog; no Asian food

[Verse 1]
Okay, I'm out here, you niggas done started it, you ordered it
Bullet find a home in ya arteries, pardon me
But them niggas won't touch not a part of me, bet on it
Them niggas belong in a sorority, ain't that a bitch
Burn they bodies up for the authorities, no evidence
You gone stop fuckin' with them warriors from New Orleans
And, I really think that it'd be better if
I just hit your block with that beretta and hop out and let her rip
Let her bang, let her bust, etcetera, etcetera
You niggas is scared of the, southern part of America
Here it come, got a gun, never come without one
Niggas wanna ball, so I guess I gotta bounce 'em
Smokin' on an ounce of that shit from the mountains
People say I need to stop, no I need a counselor
And down here you are gonna need a chopper
And I'mma need a lawyer, and you gon' need a doctor (Why? Because...)

[Verse 2]
Get at em we hit 'em up if they rattin'
Niggas ain't fuckin' with the boy them niggas softer than satin
I'm feeling awful and aggy, yes I walk with the maggy
I tell him park in a alley, and leave 'em parked in the alley
Niggas talking about me, but they ain't talking it at me
Cause if they talkin' it at me, then I'm just talking to caskets
All that talking is pussy bitch you better make ya words strong
Cause the shit gettin' chiseled on ya tombstone
What they do I got a chopper in the UHaul
Make a real nigga bring it back to '92 dog
Bring his ass to the river drop the fool off
Hope he can swim with them concrete shoes on
I got the gun right beside me who don't
Got beef homie I was just getting hungry
When you come bitch you better bring an army
We can do it in the streets and throw a gansgta party nigga (Why? Because...)

[Verse 3]
Thirty shots in the clip, nigga let's trip
Line 'em up, put 'em down on the guest list
These niggas 'bout to make me go Rambo
I'mma take the shit as far as it can go
War is the answer if ya questioning the general
Snap shots at you baby you are just a centerfold
And less Kenny Cole, niggas seem plenty bold
Pull that bitch out alright don't make me get my fishin' pole
Them niggas hoes, really doe
I would swing down there with any O, Forty-Fo' and let 'em go
Let 'em know, that I ain't never been sweet and won't be
Yes I'll be right here on the ground when you want me
Make a nigga have to come back like Rufus Mack

And I ain't never killed no one, Jack

Ten times removed, I forget about where it all began

[Verse 1]
Yeah, no Zack and Kelly but tell me and to The Max we go
And treat these verses like Margarito and Pacquiao
Teachers thought I’d never come out my shell and well
Now I hop on beats and go pistachio
They’ll never steal my dreams like Leo DiCaprio
So before the madness grow, I speak what they have to know
In a town that was small, I crashed in the lawn
The effect that I met was like a splash in the pond
See I, rap for my mom in the back of the car she said
Boy, you crazy, Momma’s little baby
I always told her I would drop a project one day
Now I’m takin' off, my project's on the runway
From suburbs of young nerds to projects that see gun play
To models on the runway, it’ll reach ‘em all in some way
They hit my brother with ten years, he said don’t leave
I said, there’s no weave baby brother I’ve been here

Ten times removed, I forget about where it all began
So this is my beginning
I look to the sky, with a cape on my back
And they tell me the sky, is the limit
But I don’t know why, and when I finally fly
I'm gonna show em all, this is my beginning
I look to the sky with a cape on my back
And they tell me the sky is the limit
But I don’t know why, but I don’t know why

[Verse 2]
July baby but cooler than an October boy
With more lines than a zebra wearin' corduroys
On my high horse, I should go to Troy
Set my flight course, as my wings deploy
Postcards and Polaroids
But not enough time to buy a stamp and show my boys
In Japan eatin' fish that's coy with little soy
Then I’m off to London watchin' this bridge that we built destroy
Don’t take advantage of the simple joys
My Ma text all the time but I miss her voice
And I know you wish you caught me before I flew off
But I was runnin' red lights like Rudolph
Just so I can zoom off, like takin' Nike shoes off
Hit the stage that I grace to amuse y’all
Wanna be a pilot, you gotta learn to fly
And you wanna be a star, your home in the sky
That's why

Ten times removed, I forget about where it all began
So this is my beginning
I look to the sky, with a cape on my back
And they tell me the sky, is the limit
But I don’t know why, and when I finally fly
I'm gonna show em all, this is my beginning
I look to the sky with a cape on my back
And they tell me the sky is the limit
But I don’t know why, but I don’t know why

[Verse 3]
Look, my RCA blast and some jewels that I cut like Cartier
Soon as I stepped outta the chamber like the RZA
Bobbin' to my Digital shit
Plan to lash at all the haters with this physical whip
My lyrics flow like, how much more can lyrical get
When all I try to do is put they soul on spiritual lift
The pastor tell it, I’m abusin' my miracle gift
When I just do like him and use it just to get me some chips
So if the rappin' this male do, just happen to help you
And fell through the cracks, and it happen to fit
Watch it connect your soul, my hustle like Russell
I just hope my grind connects with the globe
And then bring some more label reps to my home
Then I can pass the cake to the next nigga on
Fly maneuvers, Metropolis is on
I say bye to, but I will never be gone

Ten times removed, I forget about where it all began
So this is my beginning
I look to the sky, with a cape on my back
And they tell me the sky, is the limit

And basically, to see a change in me
I'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah
Oh, but you're on my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
Oh, but maybe in time in time, in time, I'll tell you I'm

But it's you I wanna take apart
And I will never ever be the first, to say it
But still I, they know I
I would do it, push a button
Pull a trigger, climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff 'cause you're my baby
I love you, love you, a little bit
I would do it, you would say it
You would mean it, we could do it
It was you and I and only I, mmm

A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit
Little bit in love with me

I hope they never find out
What they already know, know, know
As soon as it's official
We'll have to let it go, go, go
So we don't confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You could teach me many things
I'm just scared to learn a lesson
The pressure's on, both hearts beat like a metronome
Both in sync like a Justin song
Feels so right but it's just, so wrong
I wonder where my world 'bout
When niggas that I know tryna take my girl out
And her friends say I ain't the one to go for
She just jealous cause you always get approached more
Oh well, tell her fall back
Caught up in some more shit, tell her call back
Tell her get a man that ain't cheatin on her ass
Wit a girl that I know, yeah tell her all, that, that
And as for you, I think I know you're the one
The closest I've come, I'm probably a

While they sin, gin, sin sin at Rothschild's and Kenwood Liquors
The winos crooked stagger meets the high stride of the youth
Searchin' for the truth
They rebel and raise hell across alleyways and in classroom settings
They get, high off that trunk bass and 20/20 rims
They rock braids, Air Force Ones, and Timbs
They drink Hennessy, Hypnotiq, and 40's
They call they women hoes, bust downs, and shorties
They keep funeral homes in business and gunshot wards of hospitals full
Prisons packed, bubblin' over in brown sugar
They keep empty, Westside lots crowded, hype's powdered
The well is running dry
The days of Malcolm and Martin have ended
Our hope has descended and off to the side
Waiting for the reinstallment of the revolution
Because we are dying at the cost of our own pollution

Yo, it's like waking up, from a bad dream (America)
Just to figure out, you wasn't dreaming in the first place (no)

[Verse 1: Nas]
If all I saw was gangsters coming up as a youngster
Pussy and money the only language I clung to
Claim to, I mold myself up to become one
Ain't ya happy I chose rap? I'm a monster
Streets deceiving, can't believe my achievements
Cultural strata, persona's that of a non-needer
Cause I don't need nada 'cept for Prada beaver
For cold winters, tattoos got my summer sleeveless
To my G's on the flee from the coppers
Stiff bodies on freeze in funeral parlors
From the slums I come up, a phoenix caked up
Trying to take what I'm eating came up
A dismissive kid
You lucky if you allowed to witness this
Savvy, mild, wild hardly
A man's man, who would've knew the beach houses and wild parties
Jezebels and Stella McCartneys
For years, all that, how can I not be dead?
This old German said I was a thug with a knotty head
Looked at my Benz and called that a Nazi sled
With a face like he wonder where I got my bread
Probably all these stones he see, from my shows overseas
From crime to rhyme
My story is I'm from the home of the thieves

Wake up (Americaaaaaa), this is not what you think it is
America (Americaaaaaa), pay attention

Blessed, the Lord is a G, he gotta be
Who's the God of suckers and snitches? The economy
Lipstick from Marilyn Monroe blew a death kiss to Fidel Castro
He'd want me to spit this
Only the strong survive, Nas bear witness
The hypocrisy is all I can see
White cop acquitted for murder, black cop, cop a plea
That type of shit make me stop and think
We in chronic need of a second look of the law books
And the whole race dichotomy
Too many rappers athletes and actors
But not enough niggas in NASA
Who give you the latest dances, trends and fashion?
But when it comes to residuals, they look past us
Woven into the fabric, they can't stand us
Even in white tees, blue jeans and red bandanas

Wake up (Americaaaaaa), this is not what you think it is
America (Americaaaaaa), pay attention
This is not what you think it is

This is not what you think it is)

Assassinations, diplomatic relations
Killed indigenous people built a new nation
Involuntary labor, took a knife split a woman naval
Took her premature baby, let her man see you rape her
If I could travel to the 1700s
I'd push a wheelbarrow full of dynamite through your covenant
Love to sit on the Senate, and tell the whole government
Y'all don't treat women fair, she read about herself in the Bible
Believing she the reason sin is here
You played her, with an apron like, ""Bring me my dinner dear""
She the 'nigga' here, ain't we in the free world?
Death penalty in Texas kill young boys and girls
Barbarity, I'm in the double-R casually
Bugging how I made it out the hood, dazzle me
How far are we really from third world savagery?
When the empire fall, imagine how crazy that'll be

Don't smoke chronic, but she can sniff the whole eighth
Her Columbian. Like Scarface
And we ain't gotta fuck. She all face
She from the valley, somewhere in Cali

Cum again, invite 'em if you have any fun friends

Walkin' at the light like I can change your life

Biggity bam, did a couple of scams, made a couple of grands
Fast forward to the Ford Escort, I ball with it
Too quick 14 no license, that's some awful full shit
Now must stack ketchup like condiments
Kinda just wish you taught me how to be a man

[Hook]
Growin up all I wanted was a father figure
Me & mom alone every dinner
One day I hope you hear this I pray you doin better
This what it sound like if I sent my dad letters
If I sent my dad letters
This what it sound like if I sent my dad letters
One day I hope you hear this I pray you doin better
This what it sound like if I sent my dad a letter
[Verse 2]
Word is, 10th grade kick out the crib
Like where I go from here, lucky I had a girlfriend
Remember money make the world spin
Runnin around the big body benz wonderin who in this
Thats pedestrian, spoiled kid, never that
Worked too hard to get where I'm at, thinking fuck school
But next semester I be back, I hated rules
But ruling the world I often dream of that, dream of meetin you dad
Moms really getting mad when I call you that
I don't understand , your phone numbers all I ask
She laughs with her jaw dropped like the movie Mask
Damn so I then reply resort to raising my own little man
But I'm too young for that, wait I take that back
I shoulda used the hat, my girl gettin fat
Whatever results make sure that
I'll be there like you wasn't dad

[Hook]
Growin up all I wanted was a father figure
Me & mom alone every dinner
One day I hope you hear this I pray you doin better
This what it sound like if I sent my dad letters
If I sent my dad letters
This what it sound like if I sent my dad letters
One day I hope you hear this I pray you doin better
This what it sound like if I sent my dad a letter
[Verse 3]
Double 09 lately really its been on my mind
The pain eatin me alive one verse at a time
And this heart problem ain't helpin at all
Its a cardiac diagnose, just wanna stay at home
Dying slow so I bought a fast car, and a couple of charms
Now family and old friends wanna be involved
Some nigga tryna marry mom he like my songs
I find it odd sometimes wanna fucking shoot his head off
Am in the wrong, didn't think so moving on
Im working on my new album if you singing songs
But rap is what I does, turnin 20 soon
Then 21 then 22 like Emmitt was
Everybody sleeping on me time to wake em up
(wake, wake, wake em up, wake, wake, wake em up)
Now everybody chasing us like they missed the bus
And girls wanna roll like a blunt, P.S. your only son

[Hook]
Growin up all I wanted was a father figure
Me & mom alone every dinner
One day I hope you hear this I pray you doin better

One day I hope you hear this I pray you doin better

You Got Me,The Roots,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus x2: Erykah Badu]
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Somebody told me that this planet was small
We used to live in the same building, on the same floor
And never met before until I'm overseas on tour
And peeped this Ethiopian queen from Philly takin' classes abroad
She studyin' film and photo; flash, focus, record
Said she workin' on a flick, and could my clique do the score?
She said she loved my show in Paris at Élysée Montmartre
And that I stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart
We knew from the start that things fall apart and tend to shatter
She like, ""That shit don't matter"", when I get home, get at her
Through letter, phone, whatever; let's link, let's get together
Shit, you think not? Think the Thought went home and forgot?
Time passed, we back in Philly, now she up in my spot
Tellin' me the things I'm tellin' her is makin' her hot
Started buildin' with her constantly 'round-the-clock
Now she in my world like hip-hop, and keep tellin' me…
[Chorus x2: Erykah Badu]
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me

[Verse 2: Black Thought + Eve]
Yo, I'm the type that's always catchin' a flight
And sometimes I gotta be out at the height of the night
And that's when she flip and get on some old…
Another lonely night
Seem like I'm on the side, you only lovin' your mic
I know you gotta get that paper, daddy, keep that shit tight
But, yo, I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me?
While politickin' with my sister from New York City
She said she know this ball player and he think I'm pretty—psych
I'm playin', boo, you know it's just with you I'm stayin', boo
And when cats be poppin' game, I don't hear what they sayin', boo
When you out there in the world, I'm still your girl
With all my classes, I don't have the time for life's thrills
So when you sweatin' on stage, think of me when you rhyme
And don't be listenin' to your homies, they be leadin' you blind
Yeah, so what you sayin'? I can trust you?
Is you crazy?! You my king, for real
But sometimes relationships get ill, no doubt...
[Chorus x2: Erykah Badu]
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
That snake could be that chick and that rat could be that cool cat
That's whisperin', ""She tryin' to play you for the fool, Black""
If something's on your chest, then let it be known
See, I'm not your every-five-minutes-all-on-the-phone
And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact
That people bite back and fracture what's intact
And they'll forever be, I ain't on some ""Oh, I'm a celebrity!""
I deal with the real, so if it's artificial, let it be
I've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds
Listenin' to they squads and listenin' to girlfriends
That's exactly the point where they whole world ends
Lies come in, that's where that drama begins, and she like…

Me Against the World,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: 2Pac]
It's just me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
Stuck in the game
Me against the world, baby

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets
Though bodies is droppin' there ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin' while makin' millions
Witnessin' killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Can't reach the children, 'cause they're illin'
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin'
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard-headed bastard, maybe he'll listen in his casket
The aftermath: more bodies bein' buried
I'm losin' my homies in a hurry, they're relocatin' to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressin', my vision's blurry
The question is will I live, no one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna make excuses
'Cause this is how it is, what's the use?
Unless we're shootin', no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world, baby
[Chorus: 2Pac & Puff Johnson]
Me against the world
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world
Me against the world
'Cause it's just me against the world, baby (Hey)
Me against the world (Ooh yeah)
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
I got nothin' to lose

[Verse 2: Yaki Kadafi]
Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself, see
Ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'
Seein' Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons
Already crazy and screamin', I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route for a crooked Outlaw?
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall

[Verse 3: E.D.I. Mean]
Everyday there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein' more reasons for me to proceed with thievin'
Scheme on the schemin' and leave they peeps grievin'
'Cause ain't no bucks to stack up
My nuts is backed up, I'm about to act up
Go load the MAC up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo, it ain't workin'
And evil's lurkin', I can see him smirkin' when I gets to pervin'
So what? Go put some work in and make my mail
Makin' sales, riskin' 25 with a L, but oh well
[Chorus: 2Pac & Puff Johnson]
Me against the world
With nothin' to lose (Ooh yeah)
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world, baby
With nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby

[Verse 4: 2Pac]
With all this extra stressin'
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest through this oppression?
They punish the people that's askin' questions
And those that possess steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress: to make it stop, study your lessons
Don't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let this pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians are hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nothin' like the game; it's just me against the world
[Chorus: 2Pac & Puff Johnson]
Me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
Got me stuck in the game (Ooh yeah)
It's just me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world

[Outro: 2Pac]
Hahaha, that's right
I know it seem hard sometimes
But, uh, remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get
Stick your chest out, keep your head up, and handle it"
Taking Lyfe From Me,brokeNCYDE,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Se7en]
Erase all the pain that's left
This pain that easily became my death
Another bitch that made me stress
Push me away, take my breath
Send me to another place but here
Any place, I don't care, let me face my fears
Looking back at your face for years
Drips of blood, taste my tears
And to think I thought you saved me
It's been years since I lost my baby
One Glock with shots debating
This bitch has got me crazy
You think I'm kidding but I'm not, so keep it away from me
'Cause I swear to God, girl, I'ma set you free
You're not leaving this room until this clip's empty

[Chorus: Mikl]
I thought you loved me, you never gave a fuck
Why did you have to go and take my life from me?
Looking in your eyes, I finally realize
That everything you said was taking life from me
Looking through the sex, the memories feel me back
Why did you have to go and take my life from me?
And then you say you're sad, lost everything you had
Still every day, you're always taking life from me
[Verse 2: Se7en]
Another loss that made me strong
I look back at the days went wrong
And think that if the pain was gone
I wouldn't be here, but another day goes on
Where I just wanna take my life (LIFE!)
Maybe death will make things right (RIGHT!)
And depressed, can't escape this sight (SIGHT!)
I don't wanna see blood on embracing nights (NIGHT!)
Just know that I'm not confused
Cruel words that I said to you
Think now, I discovered you
Until I'm gone, this is meant for you (meant for you)
You think I'm kidding but I'm not, so keep that away from me

Still every day, you're always taking life from me

Cock back on my brain, rewind
It's too late to change my mind
My mouth gripped this gauge this time
I lean back, the bullet escapes just fine
Feeling a little nauseous now
Can't breathe, the bullet has knocked me down
Where the fuck is God at now?
Too much stress, I'VE GOT TO YELL!
Fuck that, I can't breathe no more
Heart stopped, it can't beat much more
Pain caused by this freaking whore
I shot myself and she's in the floor
'Cause she thought I was kidding but I wasn't
So keep that away from me
'Cause I swear to God, girl, I'mma set you free
You're not leaving this room alone without me

There's a monster inside me (inside me)
There's a monster inside me
And everywhere I go there's fucking monsters beside me

[Verse 1: Se7en]
Fuck this, you want to leave like this
I thought you cared to think I would believed that shit
Now you're coming back at me like you need my kiss
Fuck that you don't even just to me exist
You're only with me so you can see if I could achieve at this
It's not the geeving chick I'll never please you with
Please dive into infested razors you mistreated bitch
You need to leave my grip because I don't need this shit
I got enough problems to face with these conceited kids
Who built beef with me everytime I speak or spit
For the jealousy because my style is deep as pits
Fuck that and fuck you hoe believe in this
[Bridge: Mikl]
I hate you, I hate you

[Verse 2: Se7en]
But I'm having trouble hating because I had it wow
Thinking of about how motherfucking sad I felt
I would've gave it up if I didn't have a vouch
You know what now monster I'm glad you're found
Because I'm getting tired of all the fucking lies I trust
The lies enough for me and I despise you much
I'm blind as fuck because like see my eyes are shut
Because all I see in my mind it might get crushed
I'm not thinking about you anymore my vision is lost
I'm on bars behind bars like a prison of dark
Mission to fly my mission was never true
Well I'm forever clue, whatever boo go on and act you never knew

I hate you, I hate you

[Chorus: Mikl & Se7en]
I can't take this pain, (I'm falling)
Deep inside my head, (I'm trying)
To bring you back to me

Everything I said, (I promise)
I can't wash your tears away (Away!)
My heart was beating faster

I can take the pain (pain)
I can take the pain (pain)
I can take the pain (pain)
I can't take the pain

Check one, two, three, four, five, six
Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, one two
I never in my life told you that I want you
But now you're coming back at me like I loved you
Girl you're assuming what you like in Spanish
Te odio, and that's twice in Spanish
That I hate you and that was quite romantic
This guys a damn critic for all the mics he damaged
Have a nice day you weren't meant for me
Dear gosh she wasn't supposed to be sent to me
You must have got the mail and address on the package wrong
But fuck it, it never lasted long
Why the fuck you think I'm spitting this harassing song
We never got back together, never had a bond
Between me and you, the only thing that's sad went on

Mentally demented in this brain that he got
The pain wouldn't stop, was tortured by the rain when it drop
Put a gauge for the thoughts, blast it, it's gone in a flash
Hoping to smash, his feelings and the hope that he had
The dopest in rap, but couldn't ever focus on that
Was too distracted by the smoke that was chokin' his past
When his heart was broken, yeah, shattered like glass
Hiding his face with dark shades, glasses, and hats
But no one deserves, the fucking way he was raised
Prayed every day, his tears never faded away
Filled with hate and dismay, never couldn't handle the pain
So much stress, trapped in this animal's brain
Damaging himself, only hell remains
Til the end, motherfucker, I had felt the pain
Fighting demons in my brain, turn myself insane
Writing stories about my life, I won't shout my name

I'm an emotional wreck, with evil feelings of pain
The acid rain drips on my soul, leaving stains on my brain
Hopefully to maintain my captions, sustaining the real me
Feelings kicking in after, rapture thoughts killing my conscience rapidly
Accidentally puncture my lungs, from the start
I'm doing my part, keeping my heart together, grip glue
From the start, in this dark, I can't breathe no more
Wondering what this life's for, living six feet under
With this corpse, back's torn from the former ashes
Backlashes, Trying to backtrack to what happened
From the early days, it's a maze, I can't feel through this haze
It's amazing what the human body has to give
I have to live, half the battle is trying to win
My devotion is trying to get rid of everything that wouldn't last
My past sticks with me through this mass attack
The tracks leaving my soul hoping in fact

You try to complete me, delete me from your memories
But you need me, how the fuck can I be your worst enemy?
Possessed enough energy, after to build some sense in this
I had a style before the feelings killed my sentences
I still remember shit like it was yesterday, I digested pain
Waited for about five days to see if it ever changed
I had my better days, figuring what I needed most
Writing until I developed arthritis and my fingers broke
Needing this hope, living I know, smear the blood in my raps
Continue writing this song until I fucking collapse
I felt nothing, it was all nothing, nothing seemed to work straight
I was a failure first day I came outta my mother on my birthday
(Doctor, doctor, look, we have another retard)
Equiped me with a bicycle helmet and a pair of knee guards
It seemed hard, but I adjusted to being fucked with
Threw my feelings away and stab myself in the stomach, I loved it

It seem like everybody dress tight now
And I just want my credit
Don't get it, twisted, or dreaded

To the morgue no time soon, brethren
Being broke made my head hurt
So I need the bread or an Excedrin

Fast cars with bad broads in 'em
I proceed to smoke these trees
And stuff piles of cheese in my 501 denim
Where they bullshit begins I end them
And nope, I don't hear these niggas tripping
Closing the cabin door and reving up all my engines
The weed is rolled, the drink is cold
It's new to you, to me it's old
C-E-O
These off brand niggas ain't really the future, Ms. Cleo

To leave weed crumbs and trails of Sour D smoke

All haters expose they self, so it's best to leave it alone
Pop the cork, put the tree in the bong

And he brought them in my crib

Glittered out, stout face, tec, Rae up in the Hilton
Heard Nia Long is in the building
Penthouse fashion, ordered out room service
It looked bugged cause the waiter looked nervous
Lift off the lid, seen two shiny .38's aimed at the kid, what I do, duck!
Rae up in the shower singing, son don't know that it's real
Coming looking like he about peel something
In a tight jam, red down, matching like Santa
If I could just reach my hammer
He bust two shots, I played mice
Ran to the spot where the sun was at, quickly he was blinded by the ice
That's when Rae ran out of the back
Towel on, soap on his arms, spint duke around, fell on my lap
Yo, what the fuck happened?
It was a set up to get wet up
Starks you're bleeding
Nah, his blood fucked my white leather up
Ten G's down the drain
Yo hurry up, we got to get him up
Get the sheets son, let's fix him up
Lock the door, turn the TV off, your kicks is near the light switch
Just give me two minutes to iron my shirt, find my ices
The hit came quick, hit the jack, star six Ghost
Put down the phone stupid, wipe off your prints
Rae ran hysterically, slipped on soap
Landed on his back with his gat, now that's dope
We got three minutes, nobody seen shit, somebody might have heard shit
Singing on some Martin, where my momma bird shit
Fuck your socks, that's when we heard the door knock
Everything all right? Party here, sir, balloons popped
Threw this dude under the bed
A half dressed Raekwon, swallowing diamonds
Had money in juice up on his wedding day
The phone rang off, the tea kettle blew, wifey hitting me
What you want sweetie, lima beans and kidney
Trashed the beeper, slowly I reached for the reefer
Throw a Costa, peep oh son the house keeper
Soap suds dripping from his nuts, cut up gut
Praying how me make it out the telly untouched
[Hook: Ghostface Killah]
Fuck it, a Wesley Snipes movement on a Sunday in Bermuda
We laptop niggas, thugs in a computer
Caught up in the grimy shit
Finding two days later a murder and we got to make this flight shit
It was a Wesley Snipes movement on a Sunday in Bermuda
We laptop niggas, thugs in a computer
A Wesley Snipes movement on a Sunday in Bermuda
We laptop niggas, thugs in a computer

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Ayo, the pressures on, sonny got murk, it's time to move fast
Ayo, Deini it's on, check out the news flash
Flew out the next day, back to the Tony estates
Blew on the first class flight to L.A
It ain't take long, I pulled a few strings on the horn
So where it came from? That nigga we stuck and took the caine from
We should have killed him when we had him
Yo I was holding a Magnum
Yeah we bagged him, but we let him slide in the wagon
His bad little brown ho, from out Chicago
She move his cargo, good at handling Roscoe's
We had our eyes closed, God, we should have seen it coming
He should have seen me coming, running out the showers gunning
Now that I figured it, she put the waiter on
It all came to me, in back of my mind, just like my favorite song
Dawned on me later on, by then the day was gone
How dare this nigga even think that he could take us on
Smoke the Cee Allah, sent the kite through the Pens
Him and Big Dan, known to split wigs, with razor sharp gems
Giants from Attica riots, Halls is quiet
CO's with babies on their arms look tight
And this nigga from down state got shipped up north
Stocky young fella, running his jibs on how he set it off
Then heard that shit, plus got that kite
Money got murdered in his bunk that night
[Hook: Ghostface Killah]
Fuck it, a Wesley Snipes movement on a Sunday in Bermuda

Aint Sayin Nothin New,The Roots,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Black Thought]
What the fuck, what, what, what?
Nothin' new, nothin' new, what? Nothin' new, check
Nothin' new, nothin' new, y'all not sayin nothin' new
I represent the legendary Fifth Dynasty crew
Nothin' new, nothin' new, y'all not sayin nothin' new
Nothin' new, nothin' new, y'all not sayin, check this shit out
It's nothin' new, nothin' new, y'all not sayin nothin' new
Nothin' new, nothin' new

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Ghetto-related rendition the whole world awaited
Y'all Dorito-head cats that 'gnac and stagnated
Black Thought, the Doug E., most war veteran
Crown ruler, soul controller of this lyrical land
Spliff wizard, kid, who is it? Fifth dinosaur ghetto!
Beat detonator, apex my level, next!
My complex patterns of speech is like sex
I mastered the art of makin' you snap your necks
And Chase Manhattan endorse my mic checks
Upset poet threat just collectin' my debt
Yo, I'm overpaid in dues, blood, tears, and sweat
When you fuckin' with The Roots, that's as good as it get
Ultramagnet! We pull you in a Drag-net
Then brainwash your clique and extort your assets
Then roadie all your homies on some old-school shit
Roots Crew represent, the next movement!
[Verse 2: Dice Raw]
Life's a gamble, step up and place your bets
I drift through space, then make my escape on through the 'net
With CD's, cassettes, no C.O.D.'s or checks
Straight from the old school, ayo, Raw's in full effect
I'm like Lex Luther with rifles filled with kryptonite
When you grip the mic, it's like, ""C'mon kids, let's say goodnight!""
You don't like me, but don't even know why should you hate me
You scared to face these so I still remain safely
Confidin', North Phil' where I'm residin'
Never let an outside nigga slide in—this ain't home plate
I dunk on you once inside the paint (Uh-huh)
Flow like this, you can't! (Right)
Take me you out, you ain't!

[Hook: Black Thought]
Nothin' new, nothin' new, y'all not sayin' nothin' new
Nothin' new, nothin' new, y'all not sayin' nothin' new
Nothin' new, nothin' new, tell me what you could do
Yo, we drop the funk, and do the shit

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Yo, head lost, sippin' this Lambic Framboise
Spittin' it for, like, whoever demand the answer
What's the cure for this hip-hop cancer?
Equivalent to this avalanche of black snow
Rap flow to get my people thinkin' mo'
We at the brink of war
What does it all mean? What's it all for?
With knowledge of yourself, then you're through the first door
My people hungry and thirst for more, next music explore
It's heavenly to your ebony daughter next door
So what you think The Roots get the world respect for?
The splendid, authentic hip-hop that's raw-core
Severe world premiere, a superior sophomore
No doubt, wherever you dwell, that's where the bomb fell
Explodin' from the imperial en-sem-ble, for real
From the venue to the avenue
We truly only got respect for a few, y'all ain't sayin nothin' new
[Hook: Black Thought]
Nothin' new, nothin' new, y'all not sayin' nothin' new
Represent the legendary Fifth Dynasty crew
Roots crew comin' through, tell me what you could do
Yo, you lookin' for me? Nah, we lookin for you
Nothin' new, nothin' new, y'all not sayin' nothin' new
Represent the legendary, with nothin' to do
For you, yo, lyrical one-two
Blow up y'all, it's nothin' new, nothin' new

[Verse 4: Dice Raw, Black Thought, & Both]
Look at y'all, you just a army ant, I'm a giant
Arm fist, king of my city, runnin' this shit just like a tyrant
Y'all clowns know what I meant, that's if we at war
Then my henchmen will be at your back door
Uhh, waitin', wise at debatin'
Trippin' over Legos, runnin' up the steps and lookin' for a weapon
But you come out wavin' a white flag
That's why I just backslap [fags] like Shaq did Ostertag
Either take me out or be taken
You think I'm goin' down? Psych! The jury, they're still deliberatin'
I got half of they kids tied up in a basement
Nah, I'm just playin', yo, but that's how I'm playin' though (Right)
Dig what I'm sayin', yo? D-I-C-E
Shove a mic in your mouth, like Ted DiBiase
When you come sloppy, fuck is y'all tryin' to do?
Y'all into some wack shit and ain't sayin nothin' new
[Outro: Black Thought]
Nothin' new, nothin' new, y'all not sayin' nothin' new
Represent the legendary Fifth Dynasty crew
Roots crew comin' through, tell me what you could do
One-two, one-two, yo, we lookin' for you
One-two, nothin' new, y'all not sayin' nothin' new
Represent the Fifty Dynasty crew
Check it out, what? Well, one-two, one-two, one-two
Knahmsayin', yo? It's nothin' new
Nothin' new, nothin' new, y'all not sayin' nothin' new
Represent the legendary, Fifth Dynasty crew
Roots crew, tell me what you could do
You lookin' for me, we're lookin' for, one-two, one-two
Ha hah hah! Y'all ain't sayin' nothin' new
O-o-one-two, one-two
Represent the legendary Fifth, knahmsayin'?
Blowin' your vent, yo, content, yo, it's like that"
Can You Stand The Rain?,Lil B,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","You know we're sitting back....... Its for my ladies

[Verse 1]

Understand I live my life a real artist
Trashing this bullshit my parters out here starving
Looking for a woman from winter to August
That can understand that you build a friendship
Down for each other conservation flawless
And teach you what I know
Cuz the object is to grow
And I can think about all the times that I'm honest
I hold down the house and her heart is my fortress
Only if she ride, I'mma put her through some tests
And if she come back then I get a callback
Cuz in my life, a lot of baggage is extra
We can chill for hours
Jail taught me lessons
Sitting in the room, if your silent like that
Should respect my mind
Cuz theres knowledge up there
And I ain't playing when I say it
I rather keep it real than behind your back faking
[Verse 2]

Cash ain't shit
The heart rules everything
Your brain make it execute
Let me tell you something
Girl compatible with anything
Showed up regardless
We got a secret code that we speak in the morning
No I ain't had this but this a application
That goes through your speakers
Ladies check me out and pause for a second cuz the games looking tragic
I'm trying to have a wife before I even get married
You really peep my mind and you see I'm thinkg fast
I lost a lot of friends so relationships matter
And with it sometimes is the mission
And I dont't trust a human with those decisions
Especially with love, you lose that, you lose your vision
I try to keep my heart in the ocean with the fishes
If you feel that, it means that your based
And you understand my mind, let's go to space

[Verse 3]

A free agent
I came out of high school straight to the pros
Hooks no jump shots
Girls cheerleading
Fans on the benches
Sometimes after games live souls catch my image
I think they crazy, life, world, this shit is mean
That's why I need a lady to keep me in the field of daisies
To keep me home cuz the world hate me
100,000 let's get this money"
I Wish Remix,Yelawolf,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Yelawolf]
I wish a motherfucker the best of a lucka
Suckers can kiss my pickle, adjust your lip up and fucking pucker
I got pull like a trucker, specifically southern Louisville Slugger
Tucked on the Chevy rubber to bust your bubble
Hug your mother, don't lie to your brother
You know Yela's trouble, call the police, look at these bleeding knuckles
Alabama's elephant feet rumble, get pummelled and beat
Underneath the concrete like a street plumber
Give me the bucks from in the trees hundreds of leaves
Cover the Mossy Oak sleeves I got it, believe it momma
Corny motherfuckers we shuck em
And animals, we stuff em, a cannibal, he's bluffing nah
Woke up in the morning with a fucking pen and a pistol
I put one to the paper, I put one to my fears
Stuck up a shop with the pen then I shot up my notebook
I'm reading bullet holes, I wish you fucking would

[Hook:]
I wish a motherfucker would tell me that I ain't hip hop
Bitch you ain't hip hop
I wish a motherfucker would tell me that my shit gonna flop
Bitch your shit shit gonna flop
I wish a motherfucker would tell me that I ain't hip hop
Bitch you ain't hip hop
I wish a motherfucker would
I wish a motherfucker would
[CyHi Da Prince]
Hello all my fellow crooks as I let the cigarello cook
I'm kool-aid, I got that ghetto hook
I got a white bitch who said she went to Pebblebrook
Graduated in '03 and love Yelawolf
I got more numbers than a yellow book
And I took more shots than Carmelo took
So I'm used to being an underdog
Send my goons to come assault every last one of y'all
No wonder all they broads take their pajamas off
Lick up under balls whenever I want to call
I'm a convict but I don't wear orange
I'm so raw, catch me in my rare form
I been fly, my momma gave birth to me on a plane
Nigga so I guess you could say I'm airborne
I'm running my city getting my mayor on
Stay on my grizzly, you know I bear arms

[Hook:]
I wish a motherfucker would try to run up on me, I keep that clip cocked
I wish a motherfucker would tell that ain't kush that's in my ziploc
I wish a motherfucker would tell me I ain't hip hop, bitch my shit hot
I wish a motherfucker would
I wish a motherfucker would

[Pill]
Au contraire mon frere one pure pain giver
Don't ingest this, it might cause corrosion of the liver
Yeah toxic, drop-kick opponents on arrival
This ain't hip hop, this is the manual to survival
Take notes fake folks, imitators and lovers
Of true life G's risen up from the gutter
I'm on somethin', different from the rest of you rappers
And that's real shit, Pill spits exactly what happened
This is chemistry?
Please explain the vivid scenes of what occurred on streets
And I doubt if you know what it really means
Cultural differences divide us and our nemesis
When music is the food for living I think we all forgetting this
Born into poverty, hard torn obviously
Dad gone so we trying to figure out how to eat
Older brother hustling, momma working overtime
Now I'm standing in the kitchen whipping baking soda time
[Hook:]
I wish a motherfucker would tell me this ain't straight drop yams fresh out the pot
I wish a motherfucker would tell me this ain't a trap spot serving it to a block
I wish a motherfucker would tell me this ain't a yam shop, come and order your rocks
I wish a motherfucker would
I wish a motherfucker would"

We street referees, we rock
Jean jackets, thick shirts over turtlenecks
Certified doctors in hoods that still oil techs
But wait, roll cameras, Babyface money blowin like Beech Nut
Call off the mutts, it's me again
Ghost, your host this evenin
(Ladies and gents I'd like to thank you all for comin out tonight)
Tux tight, all sharp, light up a bark, let's mingle
Fetch me a Remy Martin on Diamonds
Flare-leg Gucci joints, I never wore
I might give 'em to my brother-in-law
Fitzpatrick, rich bastard, worth more than Egyptian marrows
Borrow the God jewels, Gucci goggles
That's how the God do, Motown twenty-five
My orals like Smokey's voice, little moist, but choice
We guzzle Dom's, smoke with scratchy throats
Live on the edge, bracelets, shades and classy coats
Jumbo in the club, we play Columbo
Frosty the Snowman, frozen as the milky way
Ice on the floor, El-Producto in the sleeve
In the seam of his mink, he said he don't drink
Think before he talked, he walked like he ordered
Champ room down in Vegas
Vendin machines that shoot Alize', compliments of E&J

The streets is rough out here
Crack game came and had us years

I've got somethin' real important to give you
So just sit down, and listen

Girl, you know we've been together, such a long, long time (Such a long time)
And now I'm ready, to lay it on the line
Well, you know it's Christmas and my heart is open wide (Open wide)
Gonna give you something so you know what's on my mind (What's on my mind)
A gift real special, so take off the top
Take a look inside - it's my dick in a box (It's in a box)

Not gonna get you a diamond ring
That sort of gift don't mean anything
Not gonna get you a fancy car
Girl, you gotta know you're my shining star
Not gonna get you a house in the hills
A girl like you needs somethin' real
Wanna get you somethin' from the heart
(Somethin' special girl)
[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & (Andy Samberg), both]
It's my dick in a box! My dick in a box, babe
It's my dick in a box! Ooh, my dick in a box, girl

And I got just the one
Somethin' to show ya that you are second to none

To all the fellas out there with ladies to impress
It's easy to do, just follow these steps
One - cut a hole in a box
Two - put your junk in that box
Three - make her open the box

Didn't get a gift for her?

This could have been avoided
What the hell are we gonna do?

My mom's been so alone
Ever since my daddy left (Cold)
No one to hold her tight
Life has put her to the test
I know just what you mean
My mom's been so sad and gray (Word)
My dad can't satisfy her in the bedroom ever since he passed away
Hold up
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
I'm thinkin' I'm thinkin' too
Slow up

It's time for a switcharoo

Show 'em how much they really mean

Can't wait to pork your mom
I'ma be the syrup, she can be my waffle

All up under the covers day

Plan B,Jae Apollo,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Jae Apollo]

Putting A lighter to this black lighting up without hesitation
Its causing pain but its feeling like my medication
Bags packed just confirming I got reservations
Question me I won't comply with your interrogation
Situations counteract with my decision making
They say its coming soon but shit I'm tierd of being patient
Time I'm waiting is affecting how I see relations
Now conversations are something I do in moderation
Overwhelmed with stress
And focused on my obligations
Fun is second
My career has all my concentration
Calm collected when any second I'm bound to lose it
Finding a balance cause music is always therapeutic
Seeking comfort just doesn't seem very optimistic
Cause when your me it always seems like no one seems to get it
I went from nobody that no one ever heard of
To me being a star is the only thing I'm sure of
Living in a place of uncertainty
Understand if life is good its still never worry free
So my policy is I'm the one insuring me I'm hearing their opinions I just never let them worry me
[Hook:]

Ugh

Riding by myself both hands on the wheel
I'm just tryna keep it real
I'm expressing how I feel but the world keeps telling me to chill

[Verse 2:]

Lyrical demonstrations exceeding there expectations
Never been good with limits so chill with the limitations
Some of daily frustrations are due to discrimination
You don't like a nigga cool but don't expect and imitation
Being an individual is critical
You tend to follow trends
It's not Apollo who you listen to
A man in the physical
But trying to live my name in the physical
And do what niggas say would only happen with a miracle
Winter 80's Olympics
My team isn't any different
Making selected moves while hoping they all efficient
Trying to make progression while living in a recession
Is enough to make a wealthy man fall into depression
So where this nigga headed?
No where if they get to tell it
They statements ain't false till you can stand and correct them
Now that I'm reflecting its clear for me to see
This is where I put my all I never had a Plan B

Ugh

Riding by myself both hands on the wheel
I'm just tryna keep it real
I'm expressing how I feel but the world keeps telling me to chill"

To me passin them half a bricks
Out the back of the Acura whip (whoo)
{talkin} Uh, I'm jus gettin warmed up, let's warm up, I'm still in my warm up suit y'all
YO, that's how I had it locked
Through the bags on the baddest block
Newest Jag wen I pass the cops
Who's as bad as a savage, I (I)
You niggas brag alot, talkin bout you brought raw
You'se a ball hog you ain't never passed the +ROC+
I still dip and dab,stick my hand in bigger bags
Link a gram or give 'em slabs, trips wit tan in gypsy cabs (outta tan)
I be badder than Krueger, speedin' rapid confuse ya
Keys backin' from Cuba, Tea bags for the users
Relax you're a loser, ease back or get fuller
These cats out the tula, Lean back in Madulla
V's matchin' my mula, sleeves actually cooler
Wrists look like I been playin freeze tag wit the Jeweler
So I'm extra good, runnin' through this reckless hood
I floor, slide off, never would these hefers could
Til' they seen me stun harder then I ever should
Now woody ain't the only bird peckin wood

YO, it's a miracle snakes, how I skip through the states
And the crispiest Apes, all my whips up to date
See this pistol and 8, It'll sit you is space
You won't be able to sleep when I get you a wake
That's a funeral, holla, get a funeral, holla
Necessary you'll get pretty at the funeral parlor
Roses, Dandelions send a few to yo father
We manuever for dollas, in the newest impalas
Listen beat it I'm hot every season I rock
Chinchilla filler, leave you niggas to freeze on ya block
We don't believe that you pop, I'll put this eagle to pop
You'd rather cop the plea and go plead to the cops
And say shit like J, I don't need to be locked
The year, the week or a day, I got a seed on the way
{talkin'} What?, Stop cryin' now, Let's keep it movin'
Sissy I'll let a rattle clap, 60 up in this bastards cap
Dig me I'm what you rappers lack, sicker than all your battle raps
Slither up in the asta hatch, or watch young move
On junk food, Twinkies sit on the caddilac
Shit I go Glock for Glock, let's see you dodge a shot
I get the hotties hot, just off my rocky rocks

Send ten winds, We like the black beatles tour
I pick up the tools, lick up and hiccup you fools
We bitter and bicker wit blickers nigga you'll sit in a pool (not water)
Agua nada, you figure that my figures are cool
Change my clothes for what, I switch up my jewels
Ya'll sing sing sing, I'm from the sing sing bing
Right to the wing ding bing, on to the spring bling fling
Now it's round one dun, ding ding ding
Cash ching ching ching, show me the bling bling king
And I get fresh, shit yes, wrist blessed

Wolves In Sheeps Clothing,Fabolous,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Them niggas is talking baby
Don't mind them, they just talking
They know they can't fuck with me baby
You tell them like that bitch told Scarface
What did she say
I don't fuck with the help

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
They say they're out for dead Presidents, never respect it
First of all, Ben Franklin was never elected
That means him and Big Bills have never connected
They just say it cause they think it sounds clever on records
Secondly God's first should never be second
And if you living wrong, money can never correct it
I'mma say it once then it's whoever direct it
You never get off on me, I'm never the exit
All black everything in my black V
It ain't a game, if it was it'd be a black Wii
I'm on my A game, never on that B shit
You on that B shit, you never gonna be shit
That's how I see shit, cause I am de shit
True story, like that Hollywood E! shit
I say F niggas cause I'm on some G shit
Yeah, that red-and-green stripe double G shit
That was for my homie, just know I'm thinking of you
I told him stay on top so they can't get above you
He told me I dig that, like a fucking shovel
Why it take a nigga to go to jail to say he love you
We be killing them, boy we be killing them
Damn we used to dream to have a million
Now the family get money like Will and them
Accounts rise like we filling them with helium
My baby girl got ass, it's no secret that it
Make you look away and still be peeking at it
She said they come with painted-faces trying to clown on you
How they under you but try to talk down on you
You see, a rat is gonna be that and go for any cheddar
Tell my bitch that I'm no good as if they're any better
But her loyalty keep her from them other boys
Let em holla, she just gonna exist above the noise
[Verse 2: Paul Cain]
Paul is sorta like
A nigga with the swag of a Yao Ming balla type, but more Rich Porter type
A small giant, nigga, we not at all alike
The shit you just discovering I've been doing all my life
Y'all niggas call it balling, I just call it life
I'm still the same as day 1, I dont get caught in all the hype
So wussup Dash, I can't call it Ike
I guess they don't see Paul they only see all the ice
Yellow everything lemon head sour jewels
Rich head to toe aviator fly Howard Hughes
Enjoy the best of everything, we paid our dues
So niggas wanna jump ship and join our cruise
But this ain't no joy ride when my boys ride
Somewhere somebody's boy died and never will your boy hide
I'm on frontline no matter how drastic
But otherwise you can find me where the cash is
In love with the rapids; no, I dont mean white water rafting
I'm talking bout them 4 door Astons
Addicted to fashion, diamonds, flashing
But the money music and fast cars is my passion
I'm no newbie, nor am I a has-been
These whack rappers give me headaches, this just the aspirin
I often speak through my actions
But paint pictures with words that you can close your eyes and imagine"

[Intro]
Yeah, motivation come in so many different
So many different shapes and forms
Angels Exodus
A lot of people said I would never do it
That's what scares me, 'cause you fear what you can't see
That's motivation for life
Based God

[Verse 1]
Give it up one time for the player haters
Y'all motivate me, so I gotta thank you
Long time I was mad I didn't have no paper
Got fucked by the game, contract labor
Same dudes fucked me over act like my neighbors
Niggas slept on the boss now they ask for favors
Text my phone everyday like they know about me
If you don't fuck with me, don't be around me
Niggas reach on anything that they think is poppin'
Groupies same thing
Haters same thing
Suckas same thing
Niggas play it awkward
Do a lot of movin', but you ain't never talkin'
Dudes like me, I'm preaching what I'm walkin'
Keep my head up, always lookin' forward
Front cover of The Fader for you lame haters
[Refrain]
This is motivation, just motivation

[Interlude]
I remember y'all niggas who hated me
Now you niggas on my dick
I remember all you bitches hatin' on me
Now you fuck with me
I remember this one time
I remember one time motherfuckers forgot about me
Had no money in my pocket
Didn't know about when my next show was

[Verse 2]
I got five on it if you got twenty on it
Finna stop smokin' weed 'cause I gotta focus
Clear head to see things that you wouldn't notice
Feel like addition of the best of it
Most people don't care what be stressin' you
So no talkin', plead the fifth often
Finna stay Based 'til I'm in the coffin
While I'm on Earth, I'ma spread the knowledge
Niggas learn from the blocks, they ain't seein' college
Niggas learn from the real and I fuck with mobsters
But I gotta stay level-headed
I know it's no love in the streets, just guns and pavement
Don't talk when you sleep 'cause suckas know we waitin'
Swear to God niggas fuck with Satan
Fake shit, that's motivation
The plan's for The Revelation

This is motivation, just motivation"
Dead Presidents,Jay Dub,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: Nas]
I'm out for Presidents to represent me
I'm out for Presidents to represent me
I'm out for Presidents to represent me
I'm out for dead fucking Presidents to represent me

[Verse 1: Jay Dub]

You know I get high, roll my J's up with Leviticus
And you could call it blasphemous, but really, I don't give a shit
I don't give a fuck if Fred Phelps is feelin' this
Cause yo, your whole Goddamn world view is full of it

All about power, thunderstorms, you're losing it
Trust a damn church, altar boys, they abusing it
Contradicting scripture, your mind, they confusing it
Hypocrisy in every fucking word, they oozing it

Burn down the churches, roll out the hearses
The people been hexed so let's reverse all the curses
Got you verse the world with the Satanic Verses
And scare you into tithe so they can clean out your purses
And I know what you're thinking, ""ey John, just relax!""
Like I'm supposed to accept the Church don't pay tax
You mean them folk at all the funerals, spreading the hate
Get to write off the motherfucking signs and the paint?

And don't even get me started on this hick in the south
With a stack of Muslim holy books, running his mouth
Like our troops ain't got enough shit to worry about
Putting lives at risk, doesn't care 'bout the amount

Just wanna get some attention, make his ignorance viral
Acting like a crucifix ain't just another graven idol
But hey, don't get me wrong, I burnt one up too, I'm liable
But when I burn a Koran, I light it with a Bible

[Hook](Jay Dub)
(I'm out for Presidents to represent me)
(I'm out for Presidents to represent me)
(I'm out for Presidents to represent me)
(But there ain't no fucking President that represent me)

[Verse 2: Jay Dub]

Now lookie here, B. Obama, I know you got your drama
Mid-terms coming up, but honestly I think it's karma
Was really kind of hoping you weren't caught up in the dogma
Support for the gays? Straight manure, you'se a farmer
Don't like Don't Ask Don't Tell? Commander where the orders?
Always talking tolerance, but you're really starting to bore us
You lied through your teeth when you said that you support us
Your ass pro-choice so one day they can abort us?

It's like the rap game which I'm considering of late
What turns me off ain't even that my competition's great
But the rappers and the fans carry 'round a lot of hate
And these the kind of people gave us Proposition 8

And they voted for you to, so what you gonna do?
Gonna set an example, gonna do something new?
Gonna remember what it felt like when it happened to you?
Or does it not matter when the target's more few

See there's always a scapegoat, someone to blame on
Once was poor blacks, now it's fags that we hate on
And the man fucking loves it cause it keeps us distracted
From the fact we still slaves, man, this shit is so tragic

So people, don't think that I'm try'na make a mess of it
But bigotry in hip-hop? I wanna see less of it
Hip-hop can represent, perhaps rap can make the best of it
Even without the help of the President

Way Out,Big Sean,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Man I wish that I could kill her
I wish that I could still feel her
Now I'm at the club lookin for a feel up
Bartender make sure my drink stays filled up
Man look at this mess I'm in
In my darkest hour I can't see the horizons
But I still remember her sizes
Thirty-four, twenty-two, thirty-five it, and
And I'm the man to these broads
With one glance I could get 'em to minaj
Through all of the screamin and all the applause
I'm Mr. Big Shot, but you was my star
Hey Juliet, I guess our book's done huh
You know I ain't book smart
Cause I just thought it was a bookmark
And we coulda picked up where we left off

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
There's nothing left to say now
Cause I'll be on my way now
And I'll be moving way out, way out, way out
There's nothing left to say now
Cause I'll be on my way now
And I'll be moving way out, way out, way out
Outta your way
[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Man I wish that I could shoot her
I wish that I never knew her
Man what I'm sposed to do huh
She my backbone how I'm sposed to manuever
And I know I said it last time
But I swear last time was the last time
But now she say it's all past times
And I feel like I see my flatline
And I'm supposed to be a man and all
But when you get That involved
You gotta start thinkin with ya head
Nah ya real head not the one in your pants and all
Man she was sposed to be my baby
Man we was sposed to see a baby
Man I woulda gave her everything
Better life, wedding ring, everything we never seen

And I'll be moving way out, way out, way out
Outta your way

Man I wish that I could stab her
Remember when I used to grab her
I wish a nigga still had her
It's gon' hurt to see another nigga have her
When I call it's no answerin
She ain't love Big Sean she love Sean Anderson
Man you could probably feel me dyin'
And you could probably hear her cryin'
She killin me from the inside out
Took everything in the crib that was inside, out
She priceless and I can't afford it
You want space baby and I gave you orbit
So come home, Home is where the heart is
She said whenever I'm here I feel heartless
So it's time to part then
I beg your pardon won't be back tomorrow, nah

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
There's nothing left to say now
Cause I'll be on my way now
And I'll be moving way out, way out, way out

I see in my sky
Niggas came in this game
And they stole our style
Now look at these niggas
Say they so hostile
Now we move from pride in now
We more general
Now I think 'fore I speak
These words out my mouth
But the spp--that I be saying
I be blurring 'em out
So I speak with a slur
Like a drunk on a rile
Or a disturbed patient in the
Men-tal house
Cool and lounge
In the house of the slum
Where the sounds and the music
Is as best as they come
It's all good
S is the best said some
Some say we will intercede as one
Heyyyy

This is how we do it
For you niggas who get money
Now you got it if you feel it
Put your hands up in the air

Let's make it happen
Come on
Let's go

It's like I stay at constant war
With these wack niggas
You think I wore a hard hat
With the strap hangin'
Gat slangin'
With my arm in the shape of a L
Letting my fingers walk
I never been down to Earth
I just been deep in thought
Peeping y'all mediocre MCs
Deleting culture
I cry freedom
Like the eyes leaking
From a deceasin' soldier
You think it's over
Not by a longshot
Even if triggered
By the best sniper the mob got
Cause I rock sacrament type slang
Doper than collapsing a light vein
With a needle to your forearm
You wind up in the worst-case scenario
Challenging me
The unseen son of a king
Something extreme
Superheroic boost a moon through a poem's
Landscape to make your hands wave
Like the movements of oceans
Don't make me angry
You bound to get lifted from the canvas
Equivalent to mutated talents of Professor Xavery
S is the best
Ask some
Some say we will intercede as one

Most of these niggas been so late
Sold up
Get ya little high
Ya little Tanq-load over
Once you breathe
Every breath you take
The end getting closer
One life to live
And this bass is
Like the clock it's
Tickin' and tockin'
It don't stop
I'm in a gray-space coaster
You can't see me
Because you're blind to the simple fact of life
That one of these days you're gonna die
And miss the one and only chance
You can fly
Motor-Boy
Where niggas is claiming the fame
Try to humble yourself
And be greater than the name
Rasu'l
This message is stuck on your brain
Live your life...

All the kids looking up to me can suck my dick
It's Portman, motherfucker, drink 'til I'm sick

How'd I get to the point cops be takin' all my time?
Time I could've been spending gettin' cash, gettin' mine
Hoping one day it comes around
One day when I'm
The nigga gettin' money, gettin' cash, gettin' signed
Getting the fuck out the ghetto, 'cause I'm tired of crime
But it's a crime that I feel this fucking way sometimes
But sometimes I feel like this shit here's a waste of time

Everything connects to you
Some say soon it will be over
You can see it in the weather
Out of tune with Mama Nature
What you do comes back to you

[Chorus: Mykel]
We're not alone
We're not alone
We're not alone
We're not alone

[Verse 1: Nas]
Uhh, uhh
Confucius, Confucius, Sigmund Freud
And Farad Muhammad, is it evolution or God?
Searching for the truth is a threat
Seems the closer we get to the truth State Troopers or Feds
Come out to silence you, my house in Malibu probably tapped
'Cause living next door to Demi Moore, plus I'm black
Plus I want vengeance for the poor who's attacked daily
Patriot Act never scared me
Jake in the Taurus, sticky in the jar-as
Niggas I'm with got warrants
America's browning, 20 years from now every town'll be brown and Latin
An African looking Manhattan
I'ma tell you what I seen with my three eyes
Word to me, not a hoax back in '99
A spacecraft in the skyline
In L.A. in daytime, ask Horse if I'm lying
[Bridge 1: Mykel]
Every mother every father
Raise your sons and your daughters
With respect and with honor
From the seed comes a fruit
It's an unbroken circle
All of life is universal
And we're all in the struggle
If I know one thing is true

[Chorus: Mykel]
We're not alone
We're not alone
We're not alone
We're not alone

[Verse 2: Nas]
Evidence remains in debate
Documents of our own Air Force base
Additional terrestrial information
Other planets with life population, my observation
Scientists study pictures of a flying disk
Right on earth anthropologists are finding shit
Visitors probably live with us, they can mimic us
It's sort of what we're seeing in the cinemas
[Bridge 2: Mykel]
Take a look in the mirror
And see the bigger picture
It's good to be alive
(It's good to be alive)
Nobody is an island
We are part of an environment
Only way we're gon' survive
Is if we harmonize

[Chorus: Mykel]
We're not alone
We're not alone
We're not alone
We're not alone

[Verse 3: Nas]
Reginald Lewis, the black billionaire
Before Oprah, Bob Johnson, how'd he disappear?
Conspiracy theories, UFOs in the air
I've seen it with my own two eyes, and I swear
Like Warren Buffet, real money I'm just trying to touch it
The diamond encrusted shit, live illustrious
'Cause we was deprived of it, suffered
Now we pop to prove anything's possible
My pimp strut was invented when they whipped us
Now we diddy bop just to show you that our strength's up
Just when niggas 'bout to see they cut
Global warming about to burn us up
Niggas never really seen paper in this world
American blacks, the teenager of this world
Give us 20 more years to grow up, already geniuses
What I mean is this
I used to worship a certain Queens police murderer
'Til I read the words of Ivan Van Sertima
He inserted something in me that made me feel worthier
Now I spit revolution, I'm his hood interpreter
[Bridge 2: Mykel]
Take a look in the mirror
And see the bigger picture
It's good to be alive
(It's good to be alive)
Nobody is an island
We are part of an environment
Only way we're gon' survive
Is if we harmonize

[Chorus: Mykel]
We're not alone
We're not alone
We're not alone
We're not alone

[Outro: Nas]
Ayo I'm American born, love America
Love my people, love all mankind, all nationalities, you know
I think it's just recently where everybody just started to feel
Like there was an elite group that runs everything
And everybody else was sheep, ignorant
Making all ethnicities, colors and creeds
Niggers, blind to what really is going on
So I say take off the wool from your eyes
Out with the old America in with the new
End all racism, all injustice, all oppression to poor people
Any people anywhere in this planet
Let's come together: a new day is rising"

Yeah, this is for gangsters only
The dance floor's packed and them thangs is on me
These cats wanna hate cause they dames is on me
We strapped in the club, so it's dangerous, homie

This is Dodger Music, this the new blue hat
This the bulletproof coupe with the moon roof back
With the deuce deuce strap, this is new school crack
(Boom boom clap, clap, boom clap)
Make way for young boss, dude move back
Cause dude pack enough heat to remove two Shaqs
Keep his quarters and Jimmy Choo shoes, now who's back
Dynasty for life, y'all know what's good
Middle finger's how we throw up our hood
Bone crushers ready, eating wimps for dinner
Them bullets is blood suckers like a ten percenter
Man, Crooked bomb first boy, please do not this
Nine years later, I'm still on some Pac ish
Got my own label, let's pop Cris'
I'm feeling like Dre at the Vibe Awards, can't nobody stop this

Yeah, Long Beach got nothing to hide
East side, 5-6-2, I say it with pride
Chicks see the C-N-S and they get inside
I use my cars to get broads, I pimp my ride
Nigga, black Mercedes packed with ladies
Half they crazy asses is asking to have my baby
Rappers lately acting shady, have me clap three eighties
You backwards cats amaze me
Nope, I don't feel you fags
Money in the safe but I gotta fill new bags
I don't feel too bad, got beef? Holla
I'll put money on your head like a dollar bill doo-rag

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I don't need no ex, still getting more sex
Hit it, then I let the Horseshoe Gang go next
Still sipping Moet, still hitting your ex
Still got diamonds in that Bill Clinton Rolex
How you living? Is that really your crib?
I got rich, never sat on Rap City with Tig
Actually, you dig, I'll mac milli your wig
I'm black William Bonnie, that's Billy the Kid
I keep clips like them Virginia boys
First you get money man, then you score
I'm waiting for a bad chick to walk in the door
With a body like Kenya Moore, I get in ya more

Fuck It All,Childish Gambino,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all
Seeing all this pussy, I'mma fuck it all

You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all
I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all
Seeing all this pussy, I'mma fuck it all
Fly around the world, eating good, drinking alcohol
You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all

[Verse 1]
Tell em what it is, I'm takin great strides
Hood niggas, hipsters, I ain't trying to take sides
Ex-Girlfriend on my mind, she really fucked me up
Doing shots of whiskey 'till my friends are saying thats enough
I really really miss her, sometimes I wanna fuck it all
Mix some warm Guinness with 20 tablets of tylenol
Call 'em while I'm drifting off, tell her that I love her so
Parents crying harder cause I didn't even leave a note
Saying that I'm selfish and I'm sorry that I left
But it hurts so much to wake up and I left you guys a check
Cause I ain't fucking happy, you don't know shit about me
I think it started when she said she happier without me
I really can't blame her cause I'm happier without me
I don't see what girls are seeing when they say they're all about me
I'm scared they wanna trap me, these hoes are all liars
I double bag my shit and never cum while I'm inside her
I used to be a sweet dude, now I'm so angry
Look at what these girls and these fake niggas made me
Cry when I'm writing, I don't really know why
I think its cause I can't really see myself an old guy
And that scares me, I wanna be around a while
But I feel my purpose goes beyond having raised a child
Bright lights, they tend to burn out fast
So I shine bright, but I'm scared that it won't last

I'm just about to pop, the industry just noticed it
People watching me, I feel like Amber Rose's tits
Friends of mine are over it, people say I changed
And I tell them that I'm glad, cause I don't wanna stay the same
Cause I used to be poor, I used to be unconfident
I used to hate these haters, now its just the opposite
Not only have I changed, I'm becoming something better
And revenge is for the weak, so I have settled my vendettas
With all of the kids who made my early life a living hell
And I hope you're doing well and feeling better 'bout yourself
Don't know if you can tell, but change is usually for the better
I used to like these bitches but couldn't afford to get em
But now I'll take your girl, yeah player pay homage
That's why I fuck these bad mamas, Kate Gosselin
I'm trying to tell the world I'm nothing to be trifled with
Donald Glover staying hotter than some rifle spit
They only wanna fuck with you after you made your way
But when you started out you couldn't pay em to stay
But now I got em lined up in the lobby door
It makes me wonder what this rapping shit's a hobby for
Oh thats right, because I'm gifted in another field, and another field, and another field
They say my public persona don't have enough appeal
I take a lesson from Kanye and give em something real
I'm getting all this attention I wanna do it right
That's why I'm performing for you like every single night
To all my fans who's saying Donald Glover about to blow
Just give me six months so you can say I told you so

I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all

Plus I’m struggling tryna find the keys to my car
Cause I be going hard
Roll the camera, life just like a movie, I’m the star
Wish you was in my position, you too broke to play the part
Of course I keep some bad women
With me in the back, sippin' Rosé with some hash twistin’
All about a dollar, my team into cash gettin’
Straight outta the 'Burgh where we drink and we smash niggas
So when I say I’m balling, that don’t mean that I’m playing, mayne
All my diamonds talking, you can see what they saying, mayne

The Buck Stops Here,Apathy,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Sample]
I get the paper, so I don't care
I get the paper, so I don't care

[Verse 1: Apathy]
You ever have a dollar bill sittin' in your pocket?
Pull it out and take a deeper look at this object
Think of all it's seen, from the jeans of crack fiends
To doctors' Docker pants, stop to glance, see what I mean?
Same dollar bill that's stuffed in a stripper's thong
Could be the same dollar bill that's out shoppin' with your mom
Same dollar bill buyin' drugs for junkies
Is the same dollar bill for your kid's lunch money
Think about it, a dollar bill slips through stores
Everybody's touched one, whether rich or poor
You probably got a dollar in your birthday card before
But days before, it coulda been used to pay for whores
Still can't see it? Let me set you straight
The dollar grandmothers place on collection plates
Politicians roll for blow on Election Day
Hold to their nose until 5-0's investigate
It's underneath pillows when kids lose their teeth
The reason why crews'll beef and lose their teeth
It fuels deceit, breathe it in deep, the dollar's oxygen
Imagine seein' life through the eyes of George Washington
[Hook]
I get money, money I got
I get money
I get money, money I got
I get the paper so, I don't care

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Handed to a man in the corner store for lottery
Taken from that man in the store in a robbery
Given to some kid on the block for a rock
Which is stacked in the pile and gets rolled up in the knot
Then it's given to a man in a van for a Glock
But that man in the van just got caught by the cops
So it's given to the cops so the man isn't locked
Then the cops split it up so the cash isn't hot
The dollar bill's just a small percentage of the whole
It's better to spend that excess cheddar slow
Keep it very basic, gotta be sure to cover your bases
Pull it from the money clip, a tip for the waitress
The waitress is an actress, she wants to be famous
Her teeth are fucked up, so she goes to get braces
She screams for a taxi, hops in the back seat
The cab has an accident and crashed on the back street
She's flung to the concrete, her purse explodes
Leavin' several single dollar bills scattered in the road
A breeze lifts a dollar in the air where it's blown
In front of a child's home, where she plays alone
Now she walks down the street, happier than before
Ringin' bells on the door when she enters the store
And with a smile from the clerk when the transaction's done
In steps a man with a gun...

When you live by the sword, you die by the sword
I'll probably die in the vocal booth spittin' out raw
Die on stage, rippin' down tours
Die from AIDS, trickin' out-a-town whores
Die 'cause I didn't have one in the pipe
Might go out like Raymond, went out on his bike
Or die on a death mission, two TECs spittin'
No vest, section from my chest missin'
Die 'cause the jewels in my necklace glisten
In a V twizzy in a reckless collision
Or die in the streets over somethin' petty
'Cause a broke ass nigga tried to say I ass bet 'em
Die from a shot from a SIG or Glock
From a kid on the block while sittin' in the drop
Or die 'cause I was on, ain't see 'em comin'
Too late, eight shots got my body numbin'
Die for fuckin' his bitch in his bed
Die 'cause a nigga thought I snitched to the Feds
Die with a knife six inches in my head
I could die on death row, sentenced to the chair
Or die 'cause a nigga pulled his Roscoe out quicker
I was high off vodka, hydro, or malt liquor
Die 'cause I knew I shoulda laid that man
Die 'cause the cops tricked me to say that man
Die 'cause I hesitated to spray that man
Die 'cause I hesitated to pay that man
Die 'cause my man passed me a empty tool
Die 'cause I panicked, I couldn't keep my cool
Die 'cause I mixed all them pills with Hennessy
Or die 'cause them niggas was jel, they envied me
Die tryin' to steal the fate of my enemy
I could go out from a case of mistaken identity
Or die 'cause the door wasn't open, it was locked
Die 'cause the 4 was broken, it wouldn't pop
Die 'cause a nigga wasn't focused on the block
Die 'cause them niggas thought the coke was in the spot
Die 'cause another nigga said I said somethin'
Die 'cause that newsy bitch said I did somethin'
Die 'cause a nigga was tryin' to get a name
Or die 'cause it was just my time to feel the flames
Might get sparked, might not feel no pain
Might go out like dark-skinned Jermaine
Take a couple shots to the heart, to the brain
Got all the dough, don't know the cost of the game
Young buck didn't wanna come off the chain
Couldn't handle the rock, got horsed in the game
I could catch a bad break like Big or Pac
I'd rather go out in the Masjid makin' Salat

Something Wonderful,Lowkey,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Introduction]
You do something wonderful...
Chase it all away
For the women of the world, because women are the world
Mixing my emotions throws me back again
I'm just letting you know...

[Verse 1]
I'm tryna be a good man I can't speak for the others
Know the saying heaven lies at the feet of your mother
Mine showed me the definition of hard work and
Smiles through her tears even though her heart's hurting
Speaks her mind and never ever bites her tongue
I guess today you can say I'm just like my mum
Great grandmother was in Beirut in '82
In a flat when it got invaded by Israeli troops
Sleeping in the hallway for shelter from the bullets
And that's why I'll always respect her to the fullest
Physically gone, all memories are kept in a picture
In Baghdad my nan slept with a Beretta in her slipper
You're judged as a man by everything you amount to
And the respect that you show the women around you
So think about that stuff when you diss her
That's somebody's daughter, somebody's mother and somebody's sister
[Hook]
You do something wonderful
Chase it all away
Mixing my emotions
Throws me back again

[Verse 2]
I'm not claiming to be perfect I know what a curve is
But a woman's worth isn't just on the surface
I see too many young women craving affection
Degrading themselves for a male's attention
I know it's love that you're certain that you felt
But messing with these different guys you're just searching for yourself
Would it be whoreish to boast how high your score is?
When a man does it, a player is what you call him
What if it's all just lies when she talks to guys?
Displays promiscuous ways like it's a source of pride
Would it make you squirm if the tables turned
Is that really what it would take to make you learn?
You're judged as a man by everything you amount to
And the respect that you shown the women around you
So think about that stuff when you diss her
That's somebody's daughter, somebody's mother and somebody's sister
I said think about that stuff when you diss her
That's somebody's daughter, somebody's mother and somebody's sister
[Hook]
You do something wonderful
Chase it all away
Mixing my emotions
Throws me back again

[Verse 3]
Certain things are too deep to put in a verse
Let me apologise to every single woman I've hurt
Or disrespected whether family members or ex's
I wanna make amends for however I left it
Men make them, but the women get harmed in wars
I pray for a heart as pure as Assata Shakur's
We put them down on the pedestal we should put them
Behind every good man, there's a good women
Betty Shabazz lost her husband to the handguns
And lost her life when her house was burned down by her grandson
Qubilah saw her father murdered when the hammer sparked
So I feel her pain when she tried to murder Farrakhan
You're judged as a man by everything you amount to
And the respect that you shown the women around you
So think about that stuff when you diss her
That's somebody's daughter, somebody's mother and somebody's sister
I said think about that stuff when you diss her
That's somebody's daughter, somebody's mother and somebody's sister
[Hook]
You do something wonderful
Chase it all away

Throws me back again"

My head is still in the sky, since you walked on by, I'm feelin' high
Got my imagination flickerin' like hot flames is how it seems
You make me wanna ride the Coltrane to A Love Supreme
My brown lady, create environments for happy brown babies
I know it sounds crazy
But your skin's the inspiration for cocoa butter
You provoke a brother, we should get to know one another

[Outro: Talib Kweli]
Baby, what you mean you don't think you look good?
You know what some people put themselves through
To look just like you?
Dark stockin', high heels, lipstick, alla that
You know what?
Without makeup, you're beautiful
Whatcha you need to paint the next face for?
We're not dealin' with the European standard of beauty tonight
So turn off the TV, put the magazine away
In the mirror, tell me what you see
See the evidence of divine presence
Women in the Caribbean, they got the, golden sun
I know women on the continent got it
Nigeria and Ghana, you know they got it
Tanzania, Zambia and Mozambique
And Botswana, to let it speak
How 'bout Latinas, Colombianas
Cubanas, Dominicanas, Tahinians
Of course, the Brooklyn women walk that walk
And the Bronx women walk that walk
Hunnies from Queens walk that walk
NYC, ATL, LA, Cincinnati, the Bay Area
Got the cocoa butter brown skinned ladies doin' their thing
In London and Paris, cocoa butter brown sk..."
Dear Diary,Masta Ace,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'alternative']","[Intro]
Do you ever song a little song like this
When you get up in the morning?

[Chorus: Ray Thomas & Masta Ace]
Dear diary, (Yo) what a day it’s been (Now I hope you ain’t releasin’ another album)
Dear diary, it's been just like a dream (Let me ask you something)

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
Ayo Ace, don't tell me you thinkin' about a return
I'm kind of concerned, when will you old cats ever learn?
It's time to hang it up when you stand on your last leg
When you don't write on the reg and your future is past dead
I'ma tell you ‘cause none of these cats will
You can't still try to rely on your rap skill
You ain't got nothin’ behind you and believe me
Not a label out that gon’ find you and want to sign you
Write your rhymes in the shower, you’re washed up
If there was a law against wack shit, you'd be locked up
These cats in the game pretend that they your friend
But as soon as you walk away, they talkin’ ‘bout you again
Half your old group don't like you and want to fight you
And even made songs about you to try to spite you
Big Beat dropped you and said that you can't sell
And they ain't had a hit since before Pac was in jail
It's like the shit’s up under your nose and you can't smell
Hell, you probably older than Blu Cantrell
You can't tell? It's over, capital O-V-E-R
And that's just in case you can't spell, c'mon
[Chorus: Ray Thomas & Masta Ace]
Dear diary, what a day it’s been (Trust me, I know what I’m talkin’ about)
Dear diary, it's been just like a dream (You need to give it up, ‘kay? It’s over)
Woke up too late, wasn't where I should have been (It’s not ‘88, ‘89 no more)
For goodness’ sake, what's happening to me? (Oh you prayin’ now?)

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
Yeah I heard all of your prayers but I doubt that God got 'em
So break out the suits and ties and the hard bottoms
And get yourself a job with a desk in a nice office
And learn to enjoy all of the garbage that life offers
And don't ever again show your face on a stage
Or write the name Masta Ace on a page, kid ya done
Whoever let you back in the door should get a smack in the jaw
‘Cause you sure shouldn't be rappin’ no more
You already proved that at the Lyricist Lounge affair
Tryin’ to battle with rhymes you wrote on the way there
Maybe next time you'll know not to play fair
Say your best written shit and school 'em like daycare
But through the sad mess and all of the bad press
I can't recall a time in the past when you had less
Ain't nobody out there gon' keep it realer than me
We one in the same, sincerely, your diary

[Chorus: Ray Thomas & Masta Ace]
Dear diary, (Stupid, man) what a day it’s been (What’s wrong with you?)
Dear diary, it's been just like a dream (Psh, let these cats gas you up)
Woke up too late, (Thinkin’ you could put another record out) wasn't where I should have been
For goodness’ sake, (Sad, man) what's happening to me? (Start a family and move somewhere, get a job or something)
Dear diary, what a day it’s been
Dear diary, (Probably checkin’ for your ass) it's been just like a dream
Woke up too late, (You gon’ waste all these people’s money) wasn't where I should have been (You ain’t gettin’ no video)
For goodness’ sake, what's happening to me? (It’s over)"
Rap 2K1,Masta Ace,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Masta Ace]
Last month I spent two weeks on a vacation
I had a dream that I was inside of my PlayStation
Did you ever lay down, take a nap and lose it?
I dreamt I was stuck in this game called Rap Music
I started off underground in a dark room
With a freestyle, a sawed-off pump and a harpoon
That transform to a pen in case of a words war
And opened the first door that led to the first floor
I got attacked by a couple of rap acts
They wore dreads, these army pants and these backpacks
I hit one over the head with a broken verb
The motherfucker tried to hit me with some spoken word
But it didn't work, and I finished him and his boys
And disappeared from the scene without making a noise
I used up four bars but I earned a punchline
And proceeded to Level 2: Land of the Unsigned

[Hook:]
We don't play those games
Would you listen here?
What I'm doing here?
Get me outta here
We don't play those games
This is getting wild
Can you tell me how?
Let me out now
We don't play those games
How'd I get in here?
Let me outta here
What I'm doing here?
We don't play those games
This is no fun
Got me on the run
Rap 2K1
[Verse 2: Masta Ace ]
I got attacked right away when I walked in
By a four-foot manager with a contract and a pen
I put up my force shield to block any attempt
At this shrimp draining my life twenty percent
The floor opened up and I almost fell inside
But I used my mic right, I swung to the other side
And just when I thought I avoided the booby trap
I got slapped by a female MC with a doobie rag
And this chick was trying to be herd like she raised cattle
But I remembered something I seen on the Blaze Battle
Whoever sold you them shoes, they fooled you
I killed her with a verse about her fucked up weave and her fake FUBU
A record exec then appeared in a black limo
And started to attack with a bag full of wack demos
And I will admit: it was hard as hell to kill
So I stabbed him with an invoice and a studio bill

[Hook:]
We don't play those games
Would you listen here?
What I'm doing here?
Get me outta here
We don't play those games
This is getting wild
Can you tell me how?

Let me outta here
What I'm doing here?
We don't play those games
This is no fun
Got me on the run
Rap 2K1
[Verse 3: Masta Ace]
I made it to the next level: Above Ground
My sound scanner then picks up on this bug sound
I pull out the sawed-off pump and I get it cocked
And that's when this A&R crawled from under a rock
And start shooting opinions, I stop, drop and I roll
'Cause if they was to hit me, they'd penetrate to my soul
I hid behind some trees and I held my weapon tightly
His street team was up on the roof trying to snipe me
It took a while to finish em all but I finally did it
Then out comes this powerful beast known as the critic
With a fully loaded magazine and mad drama
My harpoon shots just bounced off of his armor
Now I wish I would've stayed down in the dark caves
I'm running towards these big-ass fans with these sharp blades
But he was right behind me holding a flame thrower
So I jumped through the blades and I died, game over

[Hook:]
We don't play those games
Would you listen here?
What I'm doing here?
Get me outta here
We don't play those games
This is getting wild
Can you tell me how?

Raised by game where niggas ain't phased by fame
Come to the crib, get banged, they take your chain
Stay in your lane, Brokeback ain't the way of the game
My brainstorm is like I stay in the rain
My favorite was Kane, now I'm dope with weight in the game
You was hot but can't stay in the flame
Ghetto pain and windows crack, the fist is like a symbol for black
Can tell the real by how the real interact
In the middle of whack my soul sticks to a track
Kickback records get kicked to the back
I want big cribs and my man Ronnie to get his
Child in a good school and know what her gift is
It's global warming, the world is shifting

Thick and I lasted past these rat bastards

Hey I'm like Muhammad when he fasted
Opposing the fascist, make cuts and got gashes
Scratches over third eyelashes
Punchlines are like jab hits to rappers
Whose careers now ashes it's too many slashes
In his name, came in the game these gun-clappers
From weak lines to clothing lines to an actress
I seen 'em dashing smash hits
I yell run nigga run while I cook up classics
The weak hearted, become Babylon puppets
Making it hard for real hustlas
Touch the sky now and then, with a lady friend
Give thanks to the most that's how the day begins in the game

I just wanna be like Akeelah, an achiever
From the streets of the Chi where some get high for leisure
Selling weed out of cleaners
From rocks to barber shops and beemers
Chicks with blond weaves and strong legs like Serena
The demeanor of the Ghetto, to never stay settled
Aldermen and corrupt men play Pharaoh
GOOD bring business to the hood like Harolds
Five year olds walking by them self in the street
The young die of cancer, I stop eating meat
Greet the gods on 87th St. like peace
Even though it's war to G, got 'em facing the east
The game ain't tasting as sweet
Cats flow is still, and they complacent with beats

Niggas wanna have some, all I want's to have it all
They wanted something different, nigga problem solved
Drunk off the high life, death is when I sleep it off
Life's a hangover and this rappin' shit's my Tylenol
I could call any girl in my phone right now
Have a pillow in her mouth, watch her bite down
She like me cause I'm flier than a kite now
It's funny how I get these write ups on what I write down
Chick on my left arm, she could write The King And I
I'd rather die the truth, these niggas live a lie
Dressed like a gentleman, my mouth is never civilized
See me as a hero, use my little brother's eyes
Always do me like I love self portraits
Now these fake niggas say ""Hey"" like horse shit
People treat me different but I'm still the same person
I don't know what it means, I just know that it's worth it
I know I'm not perfect, but I am original
Wallet stay healthy: vitamins, minerals
Gotta feed the bitch right, stuff her full of spinach
Facebook messages askin' how I did it
No time to respond, time is money, life's a debit card
Spend it on the right shit, these bitches want you overdrawn
Drake with dyslexia, I have gone so far
My life is a green light, I always try and go hard

I am so different, the game's on lid eye
Listen to my mixtape, change your whole shit up
Salad backstage, I just wanna eat alone
Crowd at my shows more mixed than Rashida Jones
Haters say I'm changin', but I haven't changed at all
Indie kids saying that I've ruined all their favorite songs
Hood niggas sayin' that I'm whiter than that Colgate
Hatin' on my progress, I'm a long ways from Bro Rape
Black Clark Kent, all I need's a Lois Lane
But let her spend the night once and watch her go insane
Voice mail, e-mail, sendin' text message
We are not engaged just because I made breakfast
Believe me you don't want this, I'm all about business
Life is a bitch, I must be datin' her sisters
Gotta be different, take chances like pictures
Emerge victorious, stunt on y'all bitches
I'm not at the top, but ya'll niggas know I'm comin' fast
Rap will change after me, all of this will come to pass
Rappers start to use real instruments and shit
Niggas start to copy me, dumb it down and make it rich
I am not a novelty, just the first to do it different
I have always been this good, you were just laughing too hard to listen
Got my career overnighted, maybe you should order one

The only thing I don't know is how fake feel
I'm living everything these other niggas lyin' bout

Guess who's in the house and representing like a congressman
Anything I put my mind to I accomplish it
From writing scripts with Tina Fey to laying down the hardest shit
Who else is doing what I'm doing? No one

Comment left anonymous cause ain't nobody want none

Barf on the track, be amazing and rap-furious
Damn bloggers argue whether or not I'm serious
It's Nas' Illmatic, not Eddie Murphy's Delirious
Got the limelight, you stupid you think I'm sharing this

Got some nightmares, but failing's gotta be scariest

But now, they see we dangerous
Bring your girl around me, let me show her how her body work
She like me 'cause my wallet fat, it should wear a Hawaiian shirt
Comin' for your spot, like I do when I'm inside of her
Got the cold, hard green in my hand, no Heineken
Listen up, listen up, please, check my steez

Watch my math, like 75 minus 6
How can number two be number one? Because I'm the shit, bitch

Revelation 1:14: His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;

Revelation 1:15: And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.

Revelation 1:16: And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.

Revelation 1:17: And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:

Revelation 1:18: I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.

Revelation 1:19: Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;

Revelation 1:20: The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches."

Shout-out to Perfection
Okay

[Verse 1: T.R.U.T.H.]
Livin' without the wealth
Now why I feel I always gotta doubt myself
I'm goin' fa the gold, young Michael Phelps
But it don't feel like anyone would like to help
But that's okay, cause I will persevere
Even with all of my experience I'm still learnin' here
Hottest nigga out, I'm still permin' here
But to tell the T.R.U.T.H., I still have a certain fear
A nigga might die, will I make it to tomorrow?
All by myself, I'm alone like Karl
Art, I start to play out a scenario
I got it but nobody can see it, it's like a hairy toe
I feel a hole in the middle, no cheerio
I feel like I'm goin' all around like a merry-go
Very broke, well man, at least fa the moment
I never let the money part from me like Moses
I feel like I was chosen to lead 'em to the Promised Land
Real life, true confessions of a honest man
Nothin' can really uphold you like honor can
Shit, I'm just goin' with the grain like a pot of sand
I wanna go against it, so I gotta plan
I can never be did wrong, naw, not again
In grammar school I use to always get punked
Kids making fun of me everyday at lunch
A pussy-ass swole nigga scared to throw a punch
So I started hangin' with the thugs now I know a bunch
Fuck with G's from the square and Mo's from the Bodlt
And yeah they kept them guns on 'em, naw they wasn't fa show
I'm married to the game, I'm the groom and the best man
Didn't smoke my first blunt 'til I was a freshman
Started rappin' in the fourth grade
And everybody use to say ""Yeah, yeah, he's just okay""
Well okay, all the way up to 8th
Everybody heard me rhyme, they would say ""Hey""
""Hold up, shut up, nigga, what did he just say?""
And after I put it down a few times I was known as great
Yeah, but that was just grammar school
And I don't care about a lina like a panther do
I'm hot, I'm tannin'
Cookin' niggas up, leave 'em fried like Channing
Ridin' that phantom, higha then a terrace
So fuckin' sick, my flow got Lou Gehrig's
Cherish every bitch you get and I don't even care if
She just broke up with a nigga, cause I would just repair it
I got a big problem but I cain't share it
Feel like my head is goin' round like a ferris
Wheel, I appeal to any and every female
I brought the game right back like retail
Nigga I been through that water like a seashell
You niggas don't measure up like a cheap scale
Said I been rappin' in this game for a while now
Hip-hop's floor, I helped lay the tile down
So you could say I paved the way
The Messiah of rap, I saved the day

Asleep in your chimney, giggle in the darkness
Doll that I made from the hair in your armpits
Cut it while you sleeping, staring at you while you eating
Creeping out your cousins at the baby shower talking about
My crystal figurine collection, correction
Cross-section of a disease man, I'm mean man
I let the bitch hair out
Second best rapper with bitch hair out
I let the Jesus freak, I don't even need to speak
Real ""squeak squeak cheep cheep feed me!""
Macaroni pictures, unholy matrimony scriptures
Corpse bride, alimony lip-service
Sick circus, insane monkey

[Verse 2: Heems]
Shall I begin, let me begin
I will begin, so let's begin
They like, Heems, you should rap in earnest
But honestly, I'd rather burn cess and watch Ernest
Goes to Jail, Goes to Camp or even To The Army
Got a sense of humor so they say the kid's smarmy
I eat Cracker Jacks, bump Ratatat
Give dap a dap, smack a cracker back to his habitat
Chief cheeba for my cataracts matter of fact
I drop real facts, call me Snapple caps
And I eat what I like, like Apple Jacks
Creep in the night, streets with a pipe
Skeet when I pipe, in the sheets with your wife
Chief with the whites on the beach til it's night
Out near a very pretty lighthouse
Got a bright mouth and I'm poppin' right now
They like ""Ayo, stop this damn guy!""
But our shows from Seoul to Shanghai
Mad fly, nauseous, raucous
Walk it how I talk it, awkward but I'm awesome
This is not a tie, don't abide by the law, son
I'm living single, it's a nineties world
Catch me in a bar with like ninety girls
40 Synclaires, 20 Latifah Khadijah types
30 Maxines that'll probably probably freak tonight
This rap shit is nothing for me
Just another way to be stunting for free
And get buck from burnt blunts with my G's
Blunts with some trees, dumplings & cheese
Something for one king, mumbling, humbling, freeze
Kitten smitten with my mittens disease
Heems from Queens like Prince Akeem
They hopping on one leg barking for me
I'm a Spartan at sparking the tree
Marching with me, Al Sharpton and three
Martians with Jesus parting the sea
I'm starting to see, parting is sweet
Such sweet sorrow, such sorrow
Now bring it back like it's borrowed
Bring it back like it's borrowed

Backstage in Paris or face-hunting in Milan, oooh let's go

I'm putting fashionable powders up inside my nose
Looking at these fashion friends
Tryin' to make them fashion ends

Like they was fashion pens
I'm like a fountain pen
I look like mountain men
But I'm not a mountain man
I'm a fucking mountain, man
I fuck with fashion trends
My trends are fashion forward
Two dollar jeans and Gucci visors from the dollar store

Uh! (Uh-huh)
Uh! (Uh-huh)
Uh! (Uh-huh)
One two
Microphone check'a one two
Microphone check'a one two
Microphone check'a one two
Tell 'em what I'm gonna do:

[Master Ace]
On and on and on is how the beat goes
So sell the British Walkers and cut the afros
And dance 'til the feeling is gone in your toes
I wear shorts in the summer, Timberlands when it snows
Sometimes I like to chill, sometimes I like to mingle
Sometimes I get the fever for the flavor of a single
Sexy young slimmy, but not too young, though
That's because Jimmy might end up on death row
Now this here jam is like a special kind of song
It's not too short, but then again it’s not too long
I brought somebody with me, someone you might know
He's bound to wreck your body from the tip of your toe
All the way up to your last hair follicle
[Master Ace as Biz Markie]
Hey hey hey, it’s me the diabolical
Yes, y’all and, it’s time for me to fall in
To a funky beat to make you have a ball and like
Jump, make you move your rump on the floor and like pump
C’mon don’t be a chump, I see four and maybe five
Live party people but the rest did not survive
(Why?)
They had a cardiac arrest
Now, rocking microphones is something I do daily and
Making people dance like if I was Alvin Ailey, and
People just love it when the Biz starts to play
With my [beatboxing] and by the way
Skeezing with a girl is something I get tricky
And I’m the sneaky type to like slip a girl a mickey
And I live the type of life that’s far from affordable
Standing on the corner calling cuties on the portable
Me and master ace is funky (word to miz)
Yo, who is it Ace? (it’s me and the Biz)

[Hook]
It’s me and the Biz (repeat 4x)

[Master Ace as Biz Markie]
Yo Ace, I got an, um, question
Excuse me brother, but can you spare a dime?
[Master Ace]
Naw, but if you want, I can kick a funky rhyme
All I need is a groove that’s as smooth like a harp and
I’m ready to talk ‘nough shit like Al Sharpton
I take the stage and engage in a page and
My name is Master Ace and 22 is the age

[Master Ace as Biz Markie]
Yo, I'm the B-I-Z-M and, like a lot of women
Bought a new car because the first one was a lemon
Gucci, Louis, Fendi. Me and sexy Cindy
Riding around the block as if I was in the Indy.
Everybody pointing cause I am the joint and
They know it's me, because I'm the B-I-Z
Sometimes I lie in bed all day and think about my life
Should I just kick rap and settle down with kids and a wife?
And get a regular job where I'm working 9 to 5
Shit, I'm the Biz and it's great to be alive

[Master Ace]
I'm making crazy hits, a winner never quits
So those that used to diss me in the past are having fits
But I just sit back and kick my feet up on the table
'Cause I'm able to rock a crowd without a cable
Or a Cuban link and (yo, Lincoln wasn't Cuban!)
So I still produce Def Jams like my name was Ricky Rubin
M-A-S-T-E-R and this ain't store bought hip-hop from a jar and
It sure ain't Stephanie Mills playing Dorothy in the wiz [beatboxing]
It's me and the Biz
[Hook]

[Master Ace]
I'm a 100% proof and rag on the roof and
Pulling crazy cuties without a gold tooth and
Wilding, styling, this land is my land
(you're a) prisoner to my music like you was on Rikers Island
A slim, soft-spoken brother from the ghetto
My name is Master Ace and I thought that you should know
You run your rhymes like a horse and force and
Extra booty lyrics on the crowd like you’re the boss and
I think you’d better keep them to yourself
Do it for yourself, put your lyrics back up on the shelf
Now I’m going to pass it to the B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I-E
'Cause I know you want to see him

[Master Ace as Biz Markie]
Ah one two, one two, this is what I’m gonna do
Keep the place jumping, get it wild like a zoo
If anyone can do it, the B-I-Z can
Peace to Marley Marl, Tragedy, and MC Shan
And my cousin Cool V and, TJ Swan E and
The Jungle Brothers swinging from a tree and
EPMD and, Nice and Smooth B and
MC Craig G and, Just I-C-E and
The list goes on and on and on and on
I go to Dapper Dan or Benetton

Hey hey, I got some shoutouts, I know you all bought my new album
I know everybody in Brooklyn bought it
Everybody in Jersey bought it
Everybody in Uptown bought it
Everybody in Philadelphia and California and Florida bought my new album

In the same city where I got my first piece of coochie
Where I sold my first dime, and I held my first uzi

Raised by them hustlas them dealers on the block
It was plenty of them niggas on the spot
What you know bout that?
Turned up fully
The hood raised me, gang-banging made me a bully, ya dig?
Burnt out and any party we at, you know it’s turned out
The people talking the rumours
Now what you heard about?
How I spend 100 thou gettin’ purped out
I’m strapped up, I keep a pistol for these suckers tryna act up
They know I’m famous, like I won’t get in the streets Cuz?

Let me bring you back to summer school, I'm working hard
People grinding everyday, but they don't understand my job
Came from soil where the roots are underestimated
Roses grow from concrete but don't nobody care to save them
I chose my own path, the worlds so uncertain now
People you grew up with, the first ones to bring you down
I made this song for anybody that relates it now
Anybody with a dream or anybody with a smile
I guarantee if you help another person out
You start to see yourself in the eyes of a new born child
Words is bond, so my writing like jail time
No watch, just life, I don't see the time

I sit and think by myself, Does the world hate me?
Not really, But the people is the one who's shady
I spit knowledge and the youth looks at me crazy
How we all equal, But we won't elect the lady
It all starts from the heart for the massive changes
Learn to love or to hate, help the ones who's racist
You would understand if one day we change of places
Life not a soap opera no change of faces
But remain humble, ask questions often
Anytime my next bedroom is a coffin
Live life cause we the only summer out in Boston
Live life cause ain't all about the money flossin'

Pan in hand, my stars align
Step in the spaceship of my mind
Into a galaxy of trees, I leave reality behind
In my own world I'm the ruler, no measure how I do it
Words my energy, the fuel
At rocket speed my mind is movin'
Others I don't see 'em
Solo mission made from feelin'
Don't accept the cards, I deal 'em
Asteroid hits, when revealin'
So they smash like doves
Feels my heartbeat's rushing flood
I'm blessed from above, music my galactic love

LeBron sayin' don't respond, there's no back and forth
This game is mental, man, I play aloud and walk away just to hush the crowd
You trying to touch? Sit down

Just call me 2 Ball Chuck, ain't too tall what
I'll leave Utah stuffed
Man, I love this game, who the hell you called up?
You need points on the paint, I'm the joints when they stained
All my coins in the bank and we're going all the way
Yeah, baby, it's true, I'm talking to you
You already know what to do
Just pass to me, it just so happens to be
That I adapt with this heat so strap in your seat
I got a grasp on this beat, you ain't convinced?
Give it to Tayshaun Prince, we haven't stayed calm since
Leave the ball with delayed palm prints

If you don't like this shit I'm puttin' out, then you can blow me
These dollars in my pocket getting big, I gotta fold it
It's Cheezy in the building, more cheese than macaroni
What the fuck is going on?
I'm in her bush, before I eat, I make her mow the lawn
My career is like award shows, it's going long
I make it look real easy, like I'm showing thong, huh
(Bitch, you know me)
I do a shot, and then I'll sip a Sobe
I'm walking weird 'cause it's Walker that I'm wasted on
People just realizing that I'm awesome, why they take so long?
Skip around the album, it's not hard to find your favorite song
Pussy and these tracks the only things that I go crazy on
Let me slow it down a sec, man, I cannot not be sick
Hook me up with Dimetapp
(Bitch, you know me)
You think you better than I am, then show me
These niggas don't talk that much shit unless you let them
And I let them, 'cause they know if you reply, then you respect them
I've been working for a minute, hope this album's a success
I'm not tryna to do Drake numbers, I'm just tryna do my best
'Cause let's face it, if I wasn't working with Tina on pitches
I would probably flood the market, and go Katrina, you bitches, uh

I'm sorry mama, but there isn't an old me
That nigga dead, but I promise, he won't die in vain
All I trust is money, fuck these niggas like the Crying Game
This is not a joke. You won't listen to what I'm sayin'
And I promise to destroy any nigga who think I'm playin'
Know my verses can be silly, but I'm choosing not to spray rounds
My verse is pedophiles on the playground, okay now?
(Bitch, you know me)
Half-price flat screens, yes, I work for Sony
I kiss her hard and hit the jet, I make out like a bandit
They trying hard to hate me, I just don't understand it
Screamin' at me, ""When you gonna stick to the right business
And stop making rap music for these White kids-es?""
Huh, I make music for these tight kids
Don't be a fucking asshole, one day, you'll have to wipe his
(Bitch, you know me)
I know what I am, and I'll never be hovy
'Cause I am just different, I'm being what I am, man
I don't need a Jesus piece, my jacket cost me 10 grand
I'm going light speed, and I don't care if you can't see us
'Cause I will never stop, like I am cruising in a Prius
You talk from far away because my money's between us
And I'm working hard as hell, until I'm chilling with Aaliyah

I never have a weak day, my life's a long weekend
Fuckin' with ya raw, bitch, my mouth should get tested
Sleepin' on a nigga, hope you feel well rested
Gambino stay on, can't nobody pull the cord out
A nigga fucked up like a hang gliding whore house
Sick boy, yeah, the clique on deck
Yes, I rap absurd, got the game upset
And they rap about the jewelry, the weed they smoke
And I rap about my life, and niggas think it's a joke, nah
I only put real on a nigga
Bitches see the money, try and steal on a nigga
Yes, I'm on fire, you can feel it on a nigga
Step away from the heat; they Shaquillin' on a nigga
Treat niggas like pussy, go hard on 'em
Watch the swagga get swiped like a card, bottom
The swag's unique, I don't even worry 'bout 'em
I got the tortoise shell frames and the argyle
You wouldn't think from the things I'm fashionin'
I'd get more bush than Kim Kardashian
Drop hot shit, yeah, my mouth's a laxative
Born to be the greatest, this is not by accident

Niggas can't see me, I will pay for your LASIK
Buck what ya heard, bitch, I'm flyer than you ever seen
My wallet make paper, call it Evergreen
Ashy to classy, finally got some Vaseline
Live inside a sauna 'cause I always got my self-esteem
Name in your mouth, and it seems as though I struck a nerve
I never fit in like my penis in these tiny girls
I figured I was different from these other guys
When I wrote for 30 Rock, I was under 25
These other rappers wanna fade into the background
I'ma stand out when these niggas done sat down
I always pack heat, yeah, my mouth need a pat down
Money, girls, clothes, I don't worry about that now

Im Alright,Childish Gambino,"['alternative', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse]
This is exactly what I wanted
All my fans love me, dad is proud of me
Mama cries for me
'Cause she know there ain't sleep in my schedule
Having nightmares that I'm the black Heath Ledger
Sleep when I'm dead, these voices in my head
Got me waking up at 4 just so I can write instead
And my friends come and ask me if it's worth it
I tell them that ""It better be, I did this shit on purpose!""
The worst is being worthless, now a nigga priceless
Bloomingdale's coat, I don't have to check the prices
But I only go to feel a sense of control
'Cause I get this shit for free if I wear promotional
And I'm not emotional when I do my work
I get emotional when I order that dessert
'Cause she always ate dessert
And I deserted her
But I refuse to compromise career for a girl
'Cause this music and this writing and this acting is my soul
And if I let it go, there'd be no one left to know
Being happy is the goal, but greatness is my vision
And all these girls are thinking they compete with my ambition
But, baby, I am different
This shit is my life
And if you don't believe me, you can never be my wife
I'm walking in this darkness and I'm tryna find a light
And I'd rather die than be average and chances are I might, because
[Outro]
Things are changing, my life's gone pecans
Thirteen cities in the last eight weekends
All I know is: Baby, I'm so tired
Record on Monday, tape on Tuesday

Fuck this health thing, mama I'm alright"

Your life good, my life is great
This game is a bitch and I'm different, dude
I'm tryin' to fuck this bitch, she ain't in the mood
Seduce her quick
Everyone talkin' bout game needs change ain't changing shit

Too tight need muscle relaxer

I wanna do this right
Leave my heart on stage when I hold a mic
And the game OT, no end in sight
So I write in my sleep, I don't say good night
This must be how the angels felt
I hope that I don't Corey Haim myself
I know that I drink an insane amount
'Cause it helps with the joy and the pain of wealth
These guys don't seem like the friends I need
And they hang backstage drinking beers for free
My mom and my dad in the balcony
The one time that I hope they look down on me
'Cause they proud of me
They call me a role model
Even though my hand glued to that gin bottle
I keep my career going full throttle
Even though the pain will follow

You can fight or run away
I have known struggle
Relax watch me float away
I'm coastin'
I'm coastin' on a dream
I'm coastin'
This one´s for you and me

Not to set trip but my car jets west
As I drift over cliff
The sunset yes
It’s me and myself
I needed a rest
The windows down breathin' deep in my chest
I used to feel hopeless
Now I feel so rare
Seats lean back
Can't see my chair
See my eyes reflect in the sky
I feel so divine givin' thanks I´m alive
Cuz we came a long way since our days in the Ay
Sleepless nights was tryna get right
Now I just glide
Wind in my sails
I toast to the ocean
She balance my scales
West coastin'
Got the breeze at my left
Been leavin' me ???
When life do you well
Stay focused
True indeed it´s a fact
When those hard times come love will bring you right back
When life brings trouble
You can fight or run away
I have known struggle
Relax watch me float away
I'm coastin'
I'm coastin' on a dream
I'm coastin'
This one's for you and me

Now some pop bottles some chase models
As if it´s all live primetime the Apollo
Mighty big pill too many can´t swallow
The pain got ´em trippin´ off things feelin´ hollow
Weight in my brain
Spittin' my slang
Cuz I don´t wanna I don’t wanna go insane
I'm forward on my mission now I´m deep in the game
Got my speakers on blast while I´m switching the lanes
Stay low-pro kinfolk
Started out at Kinko's
Ten years later out to Vegas on a G4
The seats bucket when we puff puff pass
Passports in my luggage got my beats on smash
Attitude of a winner that’s some VMA
So we feel like its summer anywhere that I lay
Ay, it's CA till the day that we out
Stay strong through the struggle that´s what life is about
When life brings trouble
You can fight or run away
I have known struggle
Relax watch me float away
I'm coastin'
I'm coastin' on a dream
I'm coastin'

Feed morphine to more fiends than you've ever seen

Every word like a mirror
Bigger picture I try to keep shit in perspective
Dumbs out, guns out til my time runs out
Capitalistic driving force got no remorse

I'm suicidal
Can't take this pressure or this pain
Too much for these young eyes

Look at me sweatin', palms shakin, hidin' inside
Drive bys and quarter ki's

Sorry for the choices I chose
The bricks that I sold

The concrete roads
Accept me as I come into your presence

Sittin in this jail house
Eleven counts, but only one count

Through my travels I've seen barrels and gavels
Diamonds and Castles
Caught up in this solution called life
When you bitch niggas is shootin', aim right
Say goodnight to the bad guy
Last time you're gonna see a bad guy like me
I'm the last of the dying breed

Find a place in your heart

By what I had been chosen to perform
But then an angel came one day
Told me to kneel down and pray
For unto me a man-child would be born

I knew his life deserved a chance
But everybody told me to be smart
""Look at your career,"" they said
""Lauryn, baby use your head""

Than to wait at Zion's door
I've never been in love like this before
Now let me pray to keep you from
The perils that will surely come
See life for you, my prince has just begun
And I thank you for choosing me
To come through unto life to be
A beautiful reflection of His grace
See I know that a gift so great
Is only one God could create
And I'm reminded every time I see your face

I know none of the guys been in... we don't get in love, right? Oh! Let this black man right here tell what his idea of love is, 'cause not all the time we hear a young black man talk about love. About your personal definition, don't tell me what Webster thinks. Huh?

[Boy]
Willingness to do everything for that person

[Teacher]
Okay, everything like what? Explain. Let him talk, c'mon. If I asked him to talk about a fancy car, he'd be right on point. But we wanna talk about love. You can do it. (To another pupil) What do you think? You said you love somebody, you should know why you love them right?

[Boy 2]
The way they act

[Teacher]
Uh-huh

[Boy 2]
The way they carry themselves, stuff like that

[Teacher]
Okay

[Girl]
The way that they hang with they boys, and they just stand out. It's like sometimes it don't even matter like what they wear or what they look like. It's like, that way, you know?

[Girl 2]
Yeah

[Girl]
It's like you know you want to talk to him, because he stands out, it's like he got a glow or something

[Teacher]
That's deep

[Boy 2]
That's what I'm talking about

[Teacher]
I thought that was a beautiful point. Anyone else want to deal with that?

[Girl 2]
It's sometimes, like when they try to act funny in front of they boys, like when they get around say they love you. They can't love you. 'Cause love-love-love wouldn't do that

[Girl 3]
Love is not phony!

Slaughterhouse up in this bitch, get your bitch, make it quick
Nickel, Quick, Joey, Crook, you know we shut everybody down
Bitch this ain't no club hit, this ain't for no bitches
This is a motherfucking stick-up, quick, everybody down

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5’9”]
I’m about to rob the hardest nigga out here
Yes I’m on my joker shit, I keep a Heath Ledger for the joke of it
I don’t plan ahead of them, I don’t gamble
I just keep a .44 clip, full of bullets that resemble poker chips
I’m so the shit, bitches jumping at my pogo stick
Slaughterhouse you know we sick, everybody down
Take your bitch, same bitch you wake up with, make her trick
'til her fucking thighs hurt, momma if your pussy wet
You shouldn’t have a dry purse, call me Ryan Rhinoplasty
I will augment your ass if you mess with God’s work
When it comes to drama, fighting second, homicides first
I don’t look for drama, drama follows me, so why search?
Everybody, everybody we gon need you quiet, shh
Slaughter got a message, everybody down
I’m a cheddar getter, you a teller, I don’t care, whatever
I’ll just scare the witnesses, I’m the illest in here
Bring a pen and pad and don’t compare the sicknesses
Where the fuck the ruler at, so we can measure sentences
I am better than I’ve ever been, never been better
I don’t follow trends, I set trends for the trendsetters, Nickle

Slaughterhouse up in this bitch, get your bitch, make it quick

This is a motherfucking stick-up, quick, everybody down

As we proceed to give you what you need
As we proceed-
And now: the drive by

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
First I pull up on your block, let my entire torch
Spit fire, burn down your empire’s boardwalk
Bitch I am melting my rims, tires, draw off
Porsche hit the wall, then my pills high as war-off
Crawled out, grabbed the new banana clip
Lascerations on my face, travel agents shit I still plan trip
Ran up on the first nigga who had a whip
Either die a hero, or abandon ship (Get out your car nigga!)
I could kill you now fuck a witness
I’m all about my business, you all about your bitchness
And I ain't bout to slow down, you oughta ask you daughter
About fucking around with Slaughter, You bound to go down
I'mma disappear when you meet the Lord
I'mma be aboard a G4 to Singapore in me and more
Or bring a whore to be a slore
Either or we ignore casualties of war you can meet the floor now
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
I get on my ‘I don’t give a fuck’ kit, fuck the money, fuck the wealth
Fuck your label, fuck your lyrics, you sit on a fucking shelf
Lava so if ain't in the topic of the constant, the discussion fell
Tell the bitch that this dick ain't gone suck itself
Nigga, I ain't no rapper I’m a mercenary
Every verse I bury, some will blame it on the perks I carry
Been in disguise when I failed or I lost
But they won’t know I’m a god until I’m nailed on the cross
And these rappers is a mess, sad is if they best
Magnum to their chest, they could piss me, it won’t matter what they said
They just rhyme, I just climb on the ladder to success
And maybe bring me some niggas that would rather me with less
My advice for the fuck boys: make some hard improvements
Career at a standstill how you gonna start a movement
Slaughterhouse the gang take part in what we doing
Or get steamed rolled over nigga pardon the intrusion

[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
Y'all just heard my man snap, this is rubber band rap
Twisted drop a can cap pop pop a Xantax tell Everybody Down
Paid for life, fucking around
Uppercut a clown, fuck being playful pay homie with a frown
I don’t think y'all understand the magnitude
Mathematical, radical equations are easy to solve for power, yaowa
I’m the square root of a truth table, in the booth able to
Raise the bar from sub-par to the 9th power
I didn't pick at food, I devour
You think you hot dog, I’m walkin' around with a sauer
Kraut and onions, buns and ketchup mustard, relish
Wow I think I'mma fart, Everybody Down!
I don’t want the crown, I rock a fitted navy brown
Well its blue but yall been colorblind since I’d came around
Nobody can see me, I’m pissed off like my pee-pee

Hung around so much, you knew what I was thinkin'

And my peoples'll be mournin'

And get tossed up, reminiscin' how we grew up

Moonlight,Earl Sweatshirt,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Started thinking about a normal life, it got me suicidal
Standing in the kitchen with a noose and a rifle
Hang or bang, hocking loogies in a bible
Dancing with the devil, tonight's our first recital
His hands on my hips, he take control of my movement
A couple of minutes pass and I don't know what I'm doing
Just dance to the music so nobody will laugh at me
But the fucking voices in my head keep asking me

[Refrain: Earl Sweatshirt]
Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?
Nah (You ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?)
Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?
Nah, I'll try tonight (You ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?)

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I live all over, my roomie's a bum
Fuck a bitch, never sober, virgin bitch nun
Sound like she dying when that virgin bitch cum
My used penis beats on this virgin bitch drums
She asking me to dance, I ask for my pants
Ended up with an argument, sirens, ambulance
Scratch her off my list, the situation bias
She made me a milkshake and forced me to try it
Nah, I ain't Nas, get the fuck off my dick
Besides, from the smell of it, I'm hating the flavor
Last night, for the hell of it, I raped her neighbor
Bit her fillings all through my vampire teeth saber
(Ahh, Jesus, please) She screams for her savior
A nun with a bum, fuck you, bitch, better pay up
I need to eat, place to sleep, new shoes, aging feet
Alligator hair heat, Gatorade made her sweet
[Outro: Earl Sweatshirt]
Bitter sweet seven fist fighting with a reverend
Bless sessions niggas fresh as Crest breath is
Devil in my chest, I inhale more cess then
Place one missed call to heaven
You ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?"

You know a nigga never put a pencil on a beat
Spring fresh, At the spring fest
Perfect attendence motherfucker, We bling best
Huh, This a bossed up king set
Is r Cain, Loso and my mane Freck
Can't be cloned, I rise like baked flour
Can't be stoned, I'm high as the Sear's Tower
Live by the code, Ride don't dare cowar
24 straight hours, I'm Jack Bauer
Punish the block, With the milk white powder
Enough water to give the burrough a light shower
Enough hammers grip grip, And cause thunder
I'm just here to get the bread, I ain't talkin Wonder
But the feds takin pictures of me
Da lean like it's on syrup, Need a picture of me
I'm so Brooklyn, I scream aper-pay
I'm so Flatbush, I'm labor day

Den drive right past em like motherfuck em

Come through like Katrina, They call em the block wetters
Blah Blah, Thanks to the rock setters
I'm shinin, Reclinin on this Maybech's leather
I'm in the Rich Yung mock sweater, block letters
Nike airs croc leather, Who rocks better
Ask Greg Street bout the Las Veg suite
The presidential joint with the Ronald Reg sheets
They either throw salt, Or think it's nutmeg sweet
So I keep the heat where the stomach and the legs meet
It's Loso Croft, You can call me Tomb Raider
We break in homes, We the livin room raiders
Snatch wifey, Come back for groom later
Throw in the back of the van like she on room raiders

Constantly splurtin and I could match the dealers car for car

Can I Have It Like That,Pharrell Williams,"['hip hop', 'blues', 'jazz', 'r&b', 'pop']","[Intro: Pharrell]
Ladies and Gentlemen (Oh)
Yes, Sir... let's do it
Yes, Sir... hot... yo

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
On and on and, my nuts I'm palmin'
Take two of these and call me in the morning
You should see the way the chain harness the charm and
Fly, I'm like a bird like Nelly Furtado
Shit, pop your bottles, toast and scream, ""Cheers!""
Get your two-step 'cause this the record of the year
Nigga that brought you Ice Creams, two for a pair
Officially announcing, ""This is warfare,"" 'cause
Back in the day, my clouds was grey
And it seemed liked my angels couldn't blow them away
But then I sold my first verse and copped that NSX
But I was still ridin' in them thin-ass jets, but now
Man, my vision so clear out the window of the Lear
And I'm talkin' on my celly all the shit that you should hear
Listen clearly now
Hello? Can you hear me now?
[Hook: Pharrell & Gwen Stefani]
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
So drop your purse and grab your hips (Uh huh)
And act like you tryin' to get this money right quick
So can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
On and on and, this beat is on and
I control their mind from straight over the phone
And let 'em explore the words, something like a tourist
And never get addicted unless that heady-wop is serious (Yes, Sir)
From Louisville to Jimmy Choos, he's real
She know the time, she sees the Richard Mille
Plat-double skeletal, Tourbillion
It's just like her body, move, it turns her on
She like the way my hands use her body for hand warmers
And all our car doors go up like Transformers
See, I can do it this-a-way, I can do it that-a-way
From the crib in Virginia to that new Miami getaway
So cool it like New Edition unless you hot as you say
I get it, okay, let it boil away
But please run along, 'cause ladies is feelin' wrong
And I got something right for them right after this song
My name is Skate... board... P
Ladies and gentlemen (Oh)

And act like you tryin' to get this money right quick
So can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
On and on and, the temperature is warm and
I spit heat flashes, niggas get nauseous
Bright as a bitch, so analyze with caution
When the light hit the ice, bet a hundred that you vomit
And should I mention the fact the Transition is the track?
No incision to the vision just to get me where I’m at, huh
Little Skateboard, he too grown (Come on)
Ridin' up and down Collins in that that new Two-Tone
It's so cold, you don't wanna feel the chill of it (Uh)
Just stand back and just look at the grill of it (Uh)
I don't smoke but I bet the sense a mil' of it
Totally intensifies the vivid-ass appeal of it
You can be jealous, and grit your teeth (Uh huh)
But all these little niggas got somethin' in reach
So, you want heat? These niggas can front heat
While I'm on my boat party, tryin' to Sunseek
My name is Skate... board... P
Ladies and Gentlemen (Oh)

The Proud,Talib Kweli,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
The proud. Stand tall or don't stand at all, come on. Uhh, yeah. Break it down. What we do?

June 11, 2001. Timothy McVeigh is executed and the country breathe a sigh of relief. Goodness prevails over evil, it seems. Somehow when he's gone, we feel safer. Little do we know

[Verse 1]
Today the paper say Timothy McVeigh's in hell
So everything's okay and all must be well
I remember Oklahoma when they put out the blaze
And put Islamic terrorist bombing, on the front page
It's like saying only gays get AIDS, propaganda
Like saying the problem's over when they locked that man up
Wrong! It's just the beginning, the first inning
Battle for America's soul, the devil's winning
The President is Bush, the Vice President's a Dick
So a whole lot of fucking is what we gon' get
They don't wanna raise the babies, so the election is fixed
That's why we don't be fucking with politics
They bet on that, parents fought and got wet for that
Hosed down, bit by dogs, and got blacks into house arrest for that
It's all good except for that, we still poor
Money, power and respect is what we kill for, for real
[Hook]
It's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride

August 4, 2001. A drunken police officer mows down an entire family in Brooklyn. The judge lets him go with no bail. It reminds us, of just how worthless our lives are to the justice system. I struggle, to explain the situation to my son, it's hard

[Verse 2]
Niggas with knowledge is more dangerous than than niggas with guns
They make the guns easy to get and try to keep niggas dumb
Target the gangs and graffiti with the Prop 21
I already know the deal, but what the fuck do I tell my son?
I want him living right, living good, respect the rules
He's five years old and he still thinking cops is cool
How do I break the news that when he gets some size
He'll be perceived as a threat or see the fear in they eyes
It's in they job description to terminate the threat
So 41 shots to the body is what he can expect
The precedent is set, don't matter if he follow the law
I know I'll give my son pride and make him swallow it all (Damn!)
Fuck the pigs! I think the pigs killed Big and 'Pac too
If they didn't they know who did, they got to!
Who they serve and protect, nigga not you
Cops shot off of ten G's, but they got Glocks too
Let you protect yourself, or better yet respect yourself
Straight into the hospital is where you gotta check yourself
They be getting tips from snitches and rival crews
Doing them favors, so they working for the drug dealers too
Just business enforcers with hate in they holsters
Shoot you in the back, won't face you like a soldier
Kurt Loder asked me what I say to a dead cop's wife
Cops kill my people everyday, that's life

September 11, 2001. Terrorists attack the Pentagon and the World Trade Center kills thousands and permanently scars America's false sense of security. We see the best examples of humanity in the face of the worst. As firefighters, police officers, rescue workers and volunteers of all sorts, fight to save lives. The world will never be the same again

[Verse 3]
My heart go out to everybody at Ground Zero
Red, black, yellow, white and brown heroes
It's more complicated than black and white
To give your own life is the greatest sacrifice
But it's hard for me to walk down the block
Seeing rats and roaches, crack viles and 40 ounce posters
People broken down from years of oppression
Become patriots when they way of life is threatened
It's a hard conversation to have
We lost kids, moms and dads, people ready to fight for the flag
Damn, when did shit get this bad?
America kill the innocent too, the cycle of violence is sad
Damn! Welcome to the world, we here
We've been at, war for years but it's much more clear
We got to face what lies ahead
Fight for our truth and freedom and, ride for the dead
[Hook]
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride

Hold You Down Remix,Laws,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Emilio Rojas]
I'm the spitter they considered inconsiderate
The one and illegitimate son of that fucking immigrant
Just running like a sprinter
From all the responsibilities they've given him
I'm different
I keep them coming back like a recidivist
Hitting them and showing them
The difference of pussy whipped and pistol whipped
And I'm sticking to my guns just like a pistol grip
Listen when I tell you ""eat a dick"" I'm a nutritionist
You bitches, it's Emilio the flow-er
And I'm ripping it, you're sick of it
My living is trash
Vision as vivid as tripping on acid
Addicted to death
Men will be running your body and sniffing the ashes
The women I sex
Can't even learn her pilates and other advances
Running up in 'em and then they be dashing
When I be finishing up with the smashing
Never been giving the government taxes
None of my Benjamins, none of my Jacksons
So they'll be sitting the kid on a pedestal
One of the generals up in this rap shit
That's it. The fuck you want me to say?
Y'all never shutting nothing down, you like Guantanamo Bay
I tell 'em
[Hook: Laws]
Ay yo, I don’t got time to play so
I’m waiting on your say so
You know I’ll hold you down (I'll hold you down)
And y’all got me like ay yo, what more can I say though
I been like this since a day old
Watch me hold you down (I'll hold you down)

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Who would have thought it, southern Nas on the rise
Muddy water flow, I'm cat fish deep fried
Looking down from the old school drop-top
In this game of life I call my whip the sky box
High enough to kick moon rocks
I'm on some tell-it-all shit like the Boondocks
Cuz I'm serving what you need for a fee
I got that dumb packs
Some shit that you can't get up off these streets
So why not come back?
Call it K.R.I.T crack
Never fold I stand behind it
Like GMC, my type of chi you'll never find it
Even when I'm in a grave they'll still try to sign me
Cuz I embody the very spirit of an iron giant
Prime example when the stars align
Universe unravel just so God can say he co-sign
A new breed of rapper, a little rough around the edges
But in due time, I'll fix what we neglected
Cause I can hold you down
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Laws]
My jeans ain't getting no tighter
My competition spotlight ain't getting no brighter
I'm still a sarcastic Brazilian bastard
Who's piece of the pie's thicker than Sicilian
Biggest star coming from the island since Gilligan
Imprisoned murderer who only wants to kill again
Haters getting lazy, comparing me to Eminem
Eh, not quite, I'm just the sickest ever since
You ain't hip hop, you a ballad from Evanescence
I'mma snap and get up in some four element shit
Break you off while you dance
Scratch your face up, tag your place up
Wrap you from the waist up
Bury you alive, on that Biggie and Pac shit
Forget this backpack, just give me the Glock kid
Aim it right at Solar's face when I pull it
And write ""truly yours, from Guru"" on the bullet

""Now if I pull the trigger on these fully loaded lines
You gonna wish I pulled a black nine""

I stay high, even high in this song nigga
Im on silver haze what is you chiefin?
Im in the coupe keeping the rest of the birds sleeping
And I'm high to the tip top
And I'm twisted with a slip knot
Tangled in the grip-lock
And will I ever stop? never that
Light it up bring it back
Bring a ounce not a sack
I got it foggy as a suana in the building
Looking for ur boy, im probably crawling on the ceiling
Fallin on the railing catch me im gone
Im in another zone but trust me im home
Where the blunts be thicker than the arm
And every time Capo roll 'em, he say, ""This one is the bomb""

Trial Time,Mr. Bigg,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Mr. Bigg]
I started selling dope back in 1986
I bought a Cadillac and put them thangs on that bitch
The brains blowed out with the white leather seats
Fienders screaming for that butter cause that other shit is weak
I was only 17 had the neighborhood hooked
Had 'em stealing out they crib cause my crack taste like ribs
I'm up in the morning with the rest of these rookies
You out here selling them dimes, bitch I'm out here selling them cookies
I'm flying out of town getting them thangs for 12-5
400 for an ounce and 650 when it's dry
Pyrex dishes in the motherfucking kitchen
Word around town Mr. Bigg got them chickens
That nigga bought a house for his ma by the lake
And gave his grandma set of keys to the safe
Them jealous ass niggas and them hoes started hating
To see my lil' sister drive a Benz to graduation
I'm tripping on that Hennessey and I'm smoking on them buds
I still got love for them niggas selling them dubs
I remember when I use to do the same shit
Buy a half-ounce and cut it up and sold the block up
I can't put my Glock up; my Glock is my ho
And my ho go everywhere I go
Which one of you fake ass niggas wanna harm me?
I said you better bring the Navy cause I'm gonna bring the Army
[Interlude: Mr. Bigg]
Get yo 12 white folks and take that shit to trial bitch
Y'all motherfuckers talking about giving me 20 motherfucking years
I got four motherfucking lawyers standing right here and we'll strike this bitch up
And if that shit don't work I'll make y'all bitches kill me in this motherfucking court room
So motherfuck you, fuck the judge, fuck the D.A., and fuck all you weak ass hoes

[Verse 2: Mr. Bigg]
I got to make a plan cause them laws is on my ass
I just got a bird and I gotta sell it fast
They know about the down payments on my third house
They know about the diamond in my lil' sister mouth
They know about the Benz and the black Pathfinder
They know about the vacation trip I took to China
They know about the ho I was fucking named Cathy
Heard she got busted with a bird in Tallahassee
And now they tryin' to say that the yay belong to me
I know they trying to get me caught; these niggas keep holding they nuts on me
Dickie suits, and bullet proofs, and steel toes
No fake ass niggas only some real hoes
I pack my shit cause it's time for me to go
I'm getting tired of em kicking in my ma door
And even though they don't find shit they talk shit
Asking questions saying how the fuck you bought this shit
And how the fuck you don't work but drive different cars
We got you on the interstate in a Jaguar
Where that dope and them motherfucking guns at?
We'll let you go if you tell us where yo son at
Shit, I don't know nothing: light it up and type it up
And tell the D.A. get ready cause we gon' strike it up
[Interlude: Mr. Bigg & Mother]
Hello
The damn police kicked my door in this morning looking for you boy
Asking me how I bought my house and cars and taking pictures of our shit
So you need to go somewhere and hide out for a minute cause it's hot down here
Aight mama, I'll holla atcha

[Verse 3: Mr. Bigg]
I'm down in New Orleans with my auntie and my granny
The clean side of this Mr. Bigg family
They know I'm on the run so I can't use the phone
My motherfucking babies they don't even know I'm gone
Lent my mama 20,000 for my babies and the bill money
I'm in the attic smoking weed cause I think this shit is still funny
Make 'em kill me or turn myself in
Shit I'm facing life in the goddamn pen
Tha D.A. wanna see a nigga fry
Bringing niggas back from the pen to testify
Yeah I bought some guns from him
Yeah he sold me some dope
Niggas telling on me that I never even seen before
Everybody wanna sell dope and try get rich
Out on the corner just waiting to get indicted
You told on yourself then you told on me
You mighta heard of me but you ain't never bought no bird from me
Pussy ass niggas got this game fucked up
Telling on niggas just to get they time cut
A SKS with a magnifying scope
If you wanna fuck with me bitch you better get them white folks
[Outro: Mr. Bigg]
Yeah motherfucker, you bitches thought you could hold a nigga like be down baby
But I can't motherfuckin' be stopped
It's gonna take a lot motherfuckin' white folk to take a nigga like me down
Bitch I'm ridin' with the KVD, RV, Down the Bay, Birdville
And my motherfuckin' niggas off at work

All you hoes and all you niggas better
Take that shit to motherfucking trial
I say, all you hoes and all you niggas better
Take that shit to motherfucking trial
All you hoes and all you niggas better
Take that shit to motherfucking trial
All you hoes and all you niggas better
Take that shit to motherfucking trial

Take that shit to trial bitch

Take that shit to trial bitch

Now there's multi, styles in my possession
No question I be nice rappers lose like Masta Ace rollin' dice
Too precise, check the visuals, we'll leave no residuals
Individuals makin gold diggers miserable
So no-no for beef, smoke the coco leaf
Its no relief, as this rap door revolves and I enter
Tecs enter strong like people homes
Blow up mics like I blow illegal phones
Homes is flesh and bones not the fraud you're looking for
The plunder, go under think we one hit wonder yo I spoil it
Flush that 'tuh' down the toiled sip the alcoholic uh
Then Blahzay hit ya with the Whatchamacallit
You bleed red water step into my headquarter out of order

Catch how I never bow still I am to please
Drain what you got like if I was your main squeeze

Simply Amazin,Blu & Exile,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Sample]
To all you talkin' all that bullshit
I'mma put it to you like this

[Verse 1: Blu]
Ayo, I'm tryna make these niggas go bonkers
From London to the youngest in Yonkers
We So-Cal residential lyrical monsters
Gettin' women's attention like I'm rippin' a concert
So put your hands high 'til your arms hurt
I walk the earth just like God works in mysterious ways
Your spirits is swayed, every time my lyrics is played
So please stop givin' these lyricists praise
Cause they bluffin' while they bustin' with a serious face
And it's unbearable, these stereo-rap tracks are terrible
I'm here to take care of you wack cats
And bury you back at wherever you came from
I'm carryin' this game on my back 'til the pain's numb
And I be bustin' on fucks 'til I can't cum no longer
Losses, you gotta take some to grow stronger
I've conquered all you haters like a strong-armed dominator
Big dick condom breaker bit a' baby-mama maker
And ain't no time to take a break, you gotta break the mold
I'm from a place where cats are born to play the gangsta roles
Like hittin' switches, I was gettin' hit with switches
Until I switched positions, now I'm playin' when the game is on
Y'all think y'all bangin' but y'all ain't as strong
My pop a thug, I'm a son of a blood with blue Gators on
The record spinnin' his favorite songs
Now he's bangin' my shit on them same tables that he played 'em on nigga
[Interlude: Sample]
""Sing along with it, if you didn't hear it, you gonna hear it right now""

[Verse 2: Blu]
Cause yo hip hop, it started out in the heart
A young nigga from the park sharp-shootin' with darts
Harpoonin' cartoonists talkin' too much talk
But walk a whole different stroll homeboy
You get sparked by the guy right here?
I make y'all niggas see the light like a bright idea
Heard you was lookin' for my weapon but my tongue's right here
So you can act like a fool
But y'all be done by noon off a' one light beer
So yeah fuck my crew, but let's get one thing clear
Y'all can't keep up with us because your lungs ain't clear
Y'all need a million-dollar budget and some punch lines here
All your boy need is one right ear
And I could probably change the world, fuck you sold-soul rappers
After diamonds and pearls, like you homo-rappers
Y'all some go-go girls, with your go-go gadgets
Exposin' what you holdin' like your soul don't matter
I got a 'go-go get it' mentality, so battle me please
I just throw out some cheese and y'all'll go-go at it
Got you reachin' for your 4-4 'matic
While I stagger motherfuckers with darts, I got my mojo mastered
The game is full of homos backwards:
Mo' hoes than rappers, no flows but keep shows packing
And us? Fuck that we goin' platinum plus
And still ridin' on the back of the bus
Cause the bucks don't matter

""Turn it up, stop frontin', come on, turn it up""

[Verse 3: Blu]
And from the start of this shit, I took a vow to never part with this shit
I put my soul and all my heart in this shit
But in return, I got burned like these rappers had my arteries lit
So now I'm spittin' fire darts when I'm pissed
And you don't wanna see me angry cause I can't be calmed
It's like you tryna get custody of my sound, and I'm the baby's mom
I been in court for this wack shit before
And I had to file divorce you biters would start payin' style-support
A child that don't smile no more
I found the short cut in life, but I'd rather take my time out the door
Fuck a knife, I'm pullin' texts out for war
Cause I ain't good at cutting, fuck y'all, what Exile is for
See I'm the MC and he's the DJ
Manipulate the MP to translate what he say
Catch me on the freeway, 1-10 south 'til it ends at Bridgetown, USA
So roll with us where the gorillas hang
Where the cold killas live, where the gold diggas dig
Where you know niggas bang, cause the walls show the gangs when you pass 'em
Where niggas stay blown like tires, and these haters wanna slash 'em
Platinum chains? Trained'a snatch 'em
You flashin' in the Range? You waitin' for an accident to happen on purpose

I used to have
Peace, serenity, teaching divinity
Break bread, sipping the blood, eating with enemies
Blind, pearl on my mind thinking we finna be
This, that, and the third
Boy did I learn, tables turn
Billy Holiday burned down to play when my nerves drowned my focus away
Swerving in the locomotive
Far from my hopes and motives
Back to boastin' at shows to get a standin' o
From all the fans I know on some of that
Sapphire rapid fire soul stuff I used to hit 'em off with
But now I'm some ol' ""pay the toll"" for the way I played the role
Cautious when I lace a flow cause
Po's think I'm painting codes
Patience grown thin, home sick and haven't been home since
Fuck a rapper
I'm an actor in a film called
Leave me the fuck alone til' I find a real job
Busting chrome grills off at these soft-hearted breakbeats
Bouncin' with 808's and gray ink
Blue heart, red skies
True art died in the heart of my mind
Kept trying to fulfill this
Blank script with realness
Even if it kills this
Poet inside

[Verse 2: Blu]
Used to speak
Sweet with sympathy
Tease to mimic me
Sunshine every line you ever sent to me
Heaven sent, heavenly scent that later crippled me, shit
Simple men don't learn, where was your empathy
Couldn't see the fork in the road
Kept straight forward
Straight towards a humble abode we both hate more
Now that I fumbled and folded that open letter said
Dead men walkin' don't dream
You taped yours
And you told me I could rent it
Thought it was invented for my viewing pleasure
Human error
The apprentice turned teacher, preacher turned God
Couldn't reach ya, just a façade, the main feature
Modified for blogs, podcast the past
Hi-definition, she laughed
Pass the message
Now I'm guessin' that the jokes on me cause I'm the only one threatened
The wretched by the windows sketchin'
Pencil mural of the method
Don't sweat it
Techniques turnin', burnin' incense
Listening to Billy burn my intent
Definitive days that turn my nights to fiction
Friction-less, just a pen tryna pimp this stress
Cause I couldn't keep a lid on my life
Naïve is the dry leaves on the ground
Lookin' past the tree to the blue sky askin' ""Why me?""

Welcome to Hell
I'm the Devil
I've taken over Lil B's soul

[Verse 1]
I'mma bring the pain to you
This is not a game but it's...
Something different when you rising with elegance
There's fire in my eyes and death is on my breath
I cook in Hell's kitchen, so you should watch your step
I'm burning every day, my soul, there's nothing left
Everything I say is contrary to belief
And saying something deep, my speech is rap poison
I choose fake cause I can never stop the bad voices
Yes I made choices, I'd rather take the easy route
That ended up with me killing myself
I'm reincarnated with the based demigods
I took B's soul, his family was surprised
I looked them in his eyes, I can see through disguise
I took him down to Hell, he was wearing suit and tie
He begged for his life, but his life is mine now
I'm Satan, I make deals and death wishes
I hate Based God, want to put him on the guestlist
Give him first class trip to underworld, ghost town
Black stab city, you can see when no one's around
Really want to keep you blind, watch you sleep underground
No more rap songs and no based freestyles
I really can't breathe cause I'm turning to a beast now
Momma said if I want to be the best it's hard work
I chose to live reckless... And now I'm under dirt
But it's Hell on Earth with these presidents and new bombs
War every day, Wall Street scams, our jam
Everyone so they can feel my pain cause I fucked up
Have you ever messed up to the point... Now you fucked up
Lost your own life to yourself, can't believe this
Devil took my soul, I don't believe I couldn't see this
Everybody think cause you alive you couldn't be this
I'm waiting for a soul and I'll see if I can seize it
Pray to the mob boss, pray to the X-Men
I'll see you in hell if you're living with regrets, man
Best words to you, you should learn from the best men
Don't follow the next man, I'm looking for some best friends
Don't nobody care if you're doing what you love, if
You doing what you love, then
Stay away from us...
Stay away from happiness cause loneliness is here
You roaming with the Based God I'm bound to interfere
I'm the Devil

Shots be flying, niggas die, don't make a sound
Chrome .44 on the slow-mo when your body hit the ground

Got shooters, got guns, got bitches, got white, mo'fucka' we run the town
When them shots be flying nigga's diving, dying, running trying to hit the ground
Security, need security when them shots be flying around
Cocaine music nothing stopping that, with Juice 'ey I'm Project Pat
I got the streets nigga' fine with that
Chasing that money, nothing stopping that
Big ass chopper, cocaine mafia, lay a nigga' down if a nigga' try stop 'em
Chopper break it down, I fix a nigga' problem
Low to the ground, and the roof no top

Coming on the mic is Eazy-mothafuckin-E

So listen up close while we rip shit up

Well I'm Eazy-E, I got bitches galore
You may have a lot of bitches but I got much more
Wit my super duper group coming out the chute
Eazy-E, motherfuckers, cold knocking the boots
'Cause I'm a hip-hop thugster - I used to be a mugster
If you heard (Dopeman), you think I own a drugstore
Getting stupid because I know how
And if a sucker talks shit, I give him a (POW)
8 ball sipping, the bitches are flipping
Slow down, I hit a dip and, continue my tripping
Hitting my switches, collect from my bitches
The money that I make so I can add to my riches
Fill my stash box and start rubbing my gat
Feeling good as hell because my pockets are fat
A hardcore villain cold roaming the streets
And wit a homie like Dre just supplying the beats

Rolling through the hood, cold tearing shit up
Stick my head out the window and I say what's up
To the niggas on the corner cold bumping the box
But you know that's an alibi for slanging the rocks
A dice game started so I said what the fuck
So I put my shit in park and had to try my luck
Hard to roll wit my bitch jocking 24-7
Rolled them muthafuckas, ate 'em up, hit 11
Got another point, I made a ten a fo'
Was taking niggas money and was itching for mo'
Laughing in their faces and said you're all making me rich
Till one punk got jealous, cold slap my bitch
He pulled out his gat, I knew he wouldn't last
So I said to myself, homeboy, you better think fast
He shot (gunshots), Then I shot (gunshots)

Now I'ma break it down just to tell a little story
Straight out the box from the gangsta category
About a sucker, a sucker muthafucka
He's addicted, he's a smoker but in Compton called a clucker
He used to have a house car and golden rings
But the cooky cooky crack took all those things
He must've been starving 'cause he broke in my house
Caught the nigga on the street and straight took his ass out
Now I'm wanted for a murder that I had to commit
Yeah I went to jail but that wasn't shit
Got to the station about a quarter of nine
Call my bitch to get me out 'cause I was down for mine
The bitch was a trip cold hung up the phone
Now my only phone call was in the ganking zone
All the shit I did for her like keeping her rich
I swear when I get out, I'm gonna kill the bitch
Well by now you should know it was just my luck
The bailiff of the station was a neighborhood cluck
I looked him straight in the eye and said what's up
And said let's make a deal, you know I'll do you up
Now back on the streets and my records are clean
I creeped on my bitch wit my Uzi machine
Went to the house and kicked down the do'
Unloaded like hell, cold smoked the ho

Just bought a ’77 baby blue Cadillac
Run it down, set it off, let it off, get back
Diss this twist, this is one of my flavas
Guerilla’s, lions and tigers, they all of my neighbours
Swinging from a vine, like step in my limelight
My kids and my wife and my life got my mind right
Now, what do you do when they spray with the AK
Retaliate nigga cause ya life full of melee
We got the heat for the street, let me that dough
Ya boy talkin like we don’t know
Blast pass with the forks, no you rollin’ with the locusts
Been the pimpest and the hippest and I’ve always been the dopest
Peep my style
[Pharrell]
Louis bags you can’t order, thats really raw
Miami cribs on blue water, thats really raw
Blood making the game redder, thats really raw
Nigga we hot like Mayweather, it’s killin’ y’all
P stand for Pacquiao nigga

[Game]
California Nas
I’m more raw than red snapper in the pacific ocean
More raw than the brick as soon as you split it open
Talkin’, the kitchen smokin
Talkin’ the pots bubbling
I got the blueberry on deck but not muffins
My Glock stuffed in my Levi’s
My Levi's on the buttersoft leather
Panamera 4-door Porsche
My chick named Portia
They two in the same, my stick game is torture
Monday night raw, got niggas in figure four locks
Hit the block Y-O, you would think it was four Lox
I don’t rap for Billboard spots
I just wanna fuck as many bitches as I can and cop some more drops
Raw

[Pharrell]
Gargling with champagne, thats really raw
Classic millionaire frames, thats really raw
White tee’s and Jordan 3′s, thats really raw
Windmilling with them shits on, killin’ y’all
Nigga, raw"
Cut You Loose,Slaughterhouse,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9""]
Woo! Hello hip-hop, goodbye music
It's like a love-hate relationship
Riding in the Ferrari while takin trips
Compared to beer taking sips
Sitting somewhere in a Camaro with racing strips
Either way you embrace it
Can't no amount of money or lady replace it
And after all this rhymin'
If I refer to you as a girl niggas'd call this Common
I'm through as a fan
No disrespect to music, I'm talkin to you as a man
How the FUCK is you flossing a Benz?
Listening to this nigga Rick Ross dissing Em?
Jim Jones dissing Jay?
This rap shit done gone a different way (that's right)
I know my lawyers play the lies game
It's okay for Soulja Boy to say Nas' name?
Nothing but ludicrous answers
The game backwards like dancers
Shooting on the same dancefloor you grew up and answer
To them shooters, now them shooters is dancing
FUCK you too!
You corny so I gotta cut you loose
I looked in my book of rhymes, took the sign
I swear I heard a few of my nigga Crooked lines
[Verse 2: Crooked I]
I got these A&R's heart racing
Got them in fear of me sonning they flagship artists for spitting {?}
This is bar raisin'
I'm raisin' the bar so far trying to look at it's equivalent to star gazin'
Think I'd rather be water-boarded (you feel me?)
Than to listen to what y'all recorded (for real G)
Hell no, I will not support it
Rather switch places with the child mom's aborted (kill me)
My skills be on point like a flying dart
Sometimes I feel like the messiah of a dying art
A whole other animal, not the kind that departed on the giant ark
But a vulture with a lion heart
I eloquently breathe fire
I speak for the Eastsiders like I got a Long Beach speech writer
And I could teach riders how to do they thang
So they won't ruin the game for coming off lame
We could be birds of a feather, what does it mean?
Think about it, that mean I put you under my wing
Or I'ma leave this hip-hop thing to all you wack dudes
Cut you loose, you're no good I have to, cut you loose
Call me a hater when I'm tellin the truth (expect it)
SoundScan is unveilin' the proof (respect it)
Here's somethin you could NEVER dispute
The last time I spit a rhyme the roof fell in the booth (I wreck shit)
[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
Man I feel ruined inside
Somebody tell me what to do, I'm a guy
That loves music but I am truly through with the vibe
Sometimes I wish it was dead, rather than look this stupid alive (word)
I found out I been pursuing a lie
It's nothing like, what I thought, man the proof's in the pie
'Cause ain't no pudding in the hood when niggas shoot to survive
But what's my single? Ask dude in the suit and a tie
Who stole the whip, man? I'm losing my drive
I remember when singles used to have cuts on it
Nowadays the rewind button got mad dust on it
Can't bring it back if it's wack, when they come back then it's crack
I'm fiending for somethin good so I can puff on it
Y'all don't even give me a buzz
I can't enjoy a glass of beer if it's really just suds
Nothing there but the air in y'all heads
Man I'm fed dog, I had it up to HERE (done!)
I'm cutting you loose, fucking abuse
I can't believe they in your talks when you discussing the truth
These dudes suck and they bad liars
This is not what I expected when I was 11 stepping up in rap cyphers
(What's goin on?) I thought you had to be mad nice
But apparently you could be trash as long as you look good and have ice
I ain't complaining, I'm just saying though
There's no reason a musician should wanna watch a television
Instead of be listening to the radio
I'm cutting you loose
[Verse 4: Joe Budden]
Look, I used to dream of just bein' wit'chu
Woulda probably gave whatever to be seen wit'chu
On the block on the scene wit'chu
And the most beautiful thing wit'chu
Is we shared the same passion and I could get cream wit'chu
Not a qualm, not a problem, not a single issue
Then we started arguing, having single issues
Something's off nowadays, you don't seem official
SO! ""You're no good I have to cut you loooooose""
I see you with them other artists and it's sickening
Everything's changed since we parted, you been different
Do whatever for bread boo when you started tricking
For real though, ""You're no good I have to cut you loooooose""
How you could thug me?
If I can't be me when I'm wit'chu, tell me how could you love me?
(How you) Get so ugly - eat it, beat it, treat it better than niggas
So you still be dying to fuck me, baby don't interrupt me!
Ain't complete trying to compete but you judge me
What you really think of me, you disgust me
I 12-step my addict itch
So Method Man, you could have that bitch
But now she got neighbors against me, still her favorite MC
I just hit her hard and she got papers against me
It's cool; I get up with you later if meant be
Just text them old heads, tell them mate with they memories"

Wisdom in Theory,TQ,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Demote me
I’ll end up higher
Social status
I have acquired
I am the best
As Required

My faith in your claims, I have outgrown
My mind is a sea of unknown
Little do I accept
Less do I condone
Death is an appointment I’d rather postpone
Identity is an entity very few own

I’d rather be disrespected, than disrespect
I speak the words you better not forget
Thank God that we are all blessed

Do you really want to mess with me
Do you really want know why its called anxiety
Therefor nobody messes with me
So no one can kill me other than me
Like smoking weed can kill me
But thats what they say
They also said speech was free
But last time I assumed talk was free
Obama wanted some guarantee
That he don’t become the next Kennedy
Ice bullets ha-ha-ha
But it don’t mean shit to me
Get me
Wisdom is that of what I speak
Haven’t yet reached my peak
Some call it to pontificate
Walk in my shoes
Agitate in that extreme darkness and fate
To make it more mutual
My point of view is not conventional
Get where I come from
Drill in those screws
So they never get loose
Don lots wrong
But words I will never misuse

You might be awake but your eyes are still closed
What I do next not gon’ get exposed
My motivation is on and off
Like Katy’s man whores (pronounced hoes)

What goes through my mind better stay undisclosed
Got my feelings, composed
Now these niggers, look up to Lil Wayne I suppose
We don’t fucking care, where he keep the world
We all know it lies between the two palms, and off the coast
Dubai’s got the money, they can boast
Weezy do the fucking most
How long that gon’ float ya’ boat?
Your a disease
Better diagnosed
Depression, better diagnosed
You ain’t the cause
Feelings, can be controlled
Don’t got money on my mind
Thats only for the mad
Like a good girl gone bad
Like a good boy gone mad

Dialogue is what you lack
Livin’ like a tick on the past
Damn, feels like we’re going to fast

Yep we puttin’ it in rundown
We shouldn’t but we will now
Life is but a countdown
They callin’ it a cash cow
But when its only for time now
Its an outcast in the uptown
An outcast in the midtown
It will only last in downtown
So they decide to praise religion now"
Shaolin vs Wu Tang,Raekwon,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Kung-fu sample]
Master!
*sounds of fighting*
Toad style.. hmmph
The Shaolin deliberately tried to use the Lord
To learn our Wu-Tang sword fighting!
The Shaolin would never do that!
Wouldn't you? The Shaolin have always looked down at us
Are you afraid the Wu-Tang would become more famous than you?
You?
So you used your Shaolin poison to set up my master and deliberately frame me!
That's nonsense!
It's not nonsense! I saw it myself!
Nonsense! The Shaolin have nothing to fear from the Wu-Tang but our swordfight

Aiyo! Come on! Let go of the ratchet, son, come on, let's go! Come on!

Villagers, gangstas, pillagers, paintbrush
New whips, blue fifths, Louis Shallah, bitch
Ostrich turtlenecks, the Chef, already reps
Lean off the petty jets, we buy the very best
Outfits, powerful rich, pouncers, camel clips
One bump, two lumps, the shotgun, the new jumps
With flying bird, buying herb, new kick, designer birds
She on, and we up, let's re-up, and free'd up
Jakes hate it, Rae made it, Clientele, we gon' sell
You gon' starve, he gon' jail, night boots, swim with whales
Better snub, surgical leather gloves, never loved
We gon' kill, take it to the Hill, we forever real
Old records, old luggage, you ill with no rugged
You shoot and we spray, kill off them old buzzards
We love it, can't stand it, you hid, the The Wu Manual
We found it, stay grounded, we will, we still scrambling

Hold your fire!
You two traitors!
You've mixed the Shaolin and Wu-Tang

Positive Balance,Immortal Technique,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Big Zoo]
Big Zoo, uh
Technique, uh
Positive balances, uh, uh

[Verse 1: Big Zoo]
Pound for pound, I'm the most positive when I bust mine
The Zoo adds on like a plus sign
Addition, that's the key in the ignition
With no pause, I propel to pole position (Vroom!)
Ahead of the pack, light years ahead of the wack
I give a fiend a good book instead of the crack
That's the gold mine, negativity can't hold mine
The black bear's headed for the gold mine (Look out! Look out)
And then I'm positive at Showtime
I make negative MC's switch styles in no time
They change teams, rhyme about kings and queens
Instead of how they sellin' work to fiends
Then I switch thugs into soldiers
Those that have given up on God to praise Jay-Hova (Damn!)
The rap Ice Age is over
And positivity protects the Z boulder boulder
[Interlude: Immortal Technique]
Yeah, you know how it goes
Positivity, yeah

[Hook: Immortal Technique & Big Zoo]
My opinion is solid ground but you're a common hater
Splittin' and dividin' on numbers like a denominator
Third-eye navigator movements are necessary
Everything you see in videos is secondary
You need positivity like you need respect in jail
Because without balance you'll be makin' negative record sales
Neg-neg-negative record sales
Ziga-zam, Technique, like this

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
I jerk off inside books and give life to words
Leavin' concepts stuck together you probably never heard
I love when people think I'm psychologically disturbed
'Cause it means I overloaded their neurological nerves
Rappers try to serve me with disgusting incompetence
But I keep it positive with ultimate dominance
Meditatin' with Native Americans close to Providence
I speak to the spirits of ancestors at pow-wows
But rumor has it that you gettin' raped like Lil' Bow Wow
Now listen, industry motherfuckers, don't get offended
Remember that I'll bring an end to your pretender agenda
And render contenders dismembered
Bend the fabric of time and put your soul in a blender
You livin' a lie like thinkin' Jesus was born in December
Instead of caterin' to labels, somethin' gotta give
I'll rip the electrons out your body and make you positive
I seen a lot of kids come and go with marketing gimmicks
Because without balance, you don't last more than a minute
This ain't a game, I'll beat the shit out you at the line of scrimmage
I rock shows in the ghetto, nigga, you stuck in the village
I wanted to spit on the radio since I was eleven
But I can't afford the pay-ola for Hot 97
So I make paper underground, and I'm soon to blow
Movin' tapes like Biggie's ghost at Bad Boy studios

In my historical oracle, I blast metaphorical
Editorials educatin' in my territorial
Get torn, heavily armed with seventy bombs
That'll blast divine like the heavenly psalm
Your men'll be gone if they explore my deepest thought
I beat hearts in two, then ask demons for chalk
I'm dreamin' to stalk emcees in the dark
I walk blindfolded, the mind's golden, watch how you talk
My style is a art, recognize lyrical purity
All hell breaks loose like a mall with no security
The dopest vocalist, with my third eye I focus with
I proceed, flow with the speed of a Indie motorist
There's more to this than wasted shiny chains and bracelets
I hit tracks, my tongue waits for the brains to blaze it
Amazin' angelic, tell it to your people

Raw poems, bury your body in catacombs
Rip your soul from your limbs like brims from Jim Jones
In the Twilight Zone we disperse cowards
Vampires that stalk earth on reverse hours
Night calls, we target your facade
My latitude is God, darts out my jaws leave eternal scars
You're left breathin' out of tube straws by the marksmen
Harnessin' science for demolishin' the charlatan
Raps will make you parallax
My domain has power to block synapse inside veins
War shots fired off by the army type warlocks
Devil's plan is to have you drip in the Clorox

Possessin' my peeps to walk streets

Elements rushin' you back to hell again

Don't ever come to me with war
I've severed scores of orators
Rappers fall onto all fours like minotaurs

We stand one step above you like a pharmacist
With Ominous, detonate the bomb
Heads dread hallucinogenics since Vietnam
I spit a psalm, create bombs like an Iraqi
Swear on the Bible and then lie to Ecclesiastes
(Assault and battery)
Battle me, that'll be what splits you
Store enormous amounts of energy in a crystal
We boa constrict you, the gods are militant
You faggots couldn't go the length like you was impotent
You ignorant, your whole clique is split in half
You step in Allah path, and face Allah wrath, what!

The real estate

Follow the ride...

Verse 1
-------

Oi! I'm in the house like a squatter, my gate's in New Cross
Home of the original muggers, psychopathic nutters
And plain clothes undercovers, crazy trainspotters
With grass cutters and choppers, eatin' sens' for supper
My premises is like the Nemesis at Alton Towers
Where chickens and cowards only get bloodbaths for showers
Dreads devour punanny punks by the hour
Sweet or sour, it's about respect, money and power
I live in SE8 on the run-down estate
With the highest unemployment rate and crime rate
My mind state reflects my manor, speak ghetto grammar
I used to rap at Black Hammer in my black bandana
And uh, on my estate I see love and hatred
You never know who's your bredren and who ain't your mate, dread
This is the reason that I trust no-one
White or black, break in my flat and get your neck snapped
While you're out graftin' for all your hard-earned pounds sterlin'
And dollar bills, man's drummin' your yard for your valuables
Your Bally shoes, down to the bottle of Malibu in your cupboard
Burglars'll leave you buggered for your chicken nuggets
Daylight robbery means exactly that
I've seen nuff man gettin' taxed and drapes for their papes
No escape, my estate is like Planet of the Apes
Where Puffa jackets with hoods replace the black capes

It's hell where I dwell, it ain't hard to smell

Welcome to the real estate where everything is lethal
People lookin' medieval, peepin' from curtains to see you
Illegal transactions makin' money, no taxin'
Income Support, can't afford food for thought
How could they expect your dole cheques to stretch for two weeks?
Tellin' people to Jobseek? I tell 'em kiss my butt cheeks
Most brains around my way won't even stay in school
They'd rather be in a cafe burnin' and playin' pool
Displayin' tools, disobeyin' rules and that
Makin' moves, bobbin' and weavin', robbin' and thievin' jewels
Repeat chorus

Verse 3
-------

Now some rest in peace, so let peace rest in you
But it's all about survival when you're livin' in the zoo
On the streets of South-East, reside with the beasts
Roam with creeps preyin' on defenceless OAP's
I walk around with a frown, I've got no time to be bound
And if you get tied down it could leave you with tears of a clown
Pound-for-pound I hold my own against the odds
Average bods shoot drugs but that shit's only for mugs
Amphetamines litter my staircase, spliffs litter my lifts
Bloody needles and shit in the pool of piss
This is the present state of most estates, mate, and it's unpleasant
Sounds depressin'? Shhh, listen what I'm stressin'
I'll take you on a guided tour, south of the border
Home of the poorer drug scorer holdin' the borer
Irrational ignorant fools with nothin' to lose
Ghetto bastards get plastered, mixin' whisky with brews

Repeat chorus

Yeah, yeah... Stockwell Park Estate...Stonebridge...Broadwater Farm...

With twelve rich whores, ready to stunt
Roll the blunts, lady, you straighten the pussy, ran Glenny my man
Honest seven hundred gram, be easy

Who Prays For Me,Josh Patterson,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","INTRO-- Dear heavenly father.. I come before you now (piano fades in).. as humble as I know how.. and I.. I just want to ask for forgiveness.. forgiveness for all of my past sins and the sins I have yet to commit, man I.. I just need all tha help I can get right now, and I.. juss ask one simple question... ""Who Prays for Me?""
VERSE ONE-- My father died in '97, ascended riqht to heaven, resting in peace, lays his body but his soul isn't present, every since I was eleven, i've had some suicidal thoughts present, holding in my feelings probably caused most of my dying essence. Reference to idols, procrastinating God's arrival. Doing anything for survival in this crooked cycle.. in which we call 'Life'. But im just trying to live it. I go through many fights and struggles, life might as well be prison, sinning became a habbit, livin so angry and mad at everybody for no apparent reason, sad at a glance of my momma, she could rinse all tha drama away.. Im concerned and dreading the day my moms will pass away, evaluate my life of pain. Consumed by ""worldy things"" im never safe, in fear I ask the Lord will I see an early grave.. Im worried Josh.. Is what you keep saying.. But if you're worrying, then who the hells prayin?!!
HOOK--Who prays for me?
Who prays for me?
Who prays for me?
Who prays for me?
VERSE TWO-- My troubles result in violence, But I scream out in silence, violent memories arriving, releasing stress through my writings, every since i've been rising as a youth, I never told the truth, it seemed like lying was the new, style, it gave my momma proof that she couldn't trust her youngest child, sneaking after school I fell in love with this 'thug lifestyle' and I knew.. That life wasn't promised tomorrow, going everyday in sorrow, because I didn't have no footsteps to follow, tomorrow there's a brighter day is what they always say, while insanity creep into my brain, what's my fate? and when I cease to exist, just know this.. Heaven wasn't my main focus, it was bogus money, that left me detoured and lonely, hopeless and outspoken, all my homies turned into phonies, im broken by pain and betrayal, hopin im not the only.. One whos feeling this anger, sinking while sins an anchor, im lost. Whats the cost, of my life? help me fight, tip-toeing into the dangerous thoughts and vibes of my mind.. To God im only a stranger deprived of time.. Who Prays for Me?
HOOK-- Who prays for me?
Who prays for me?
Who prays for me?
Who prays for me?
OUTRO-- If I dont wake up tomorrow
Will I die alone and scared?
Life is full of pain and sorrow
Often wonder if God cares
Yhu dont have to be there when I
Need you, as long as you can say
That through all mah pain and
Struggles, you dont hesitate to
Pray..

All Yours poem,Josh Patterson,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Your personality's flawless
Your cunning smile is breath-taking
Your perplexing seduction puts many shame
Your movement & graceful walk is perfectly assembled step by step
Your pride & confidence gives all the courage to stay true to themselves
Your posture & perfectly aligned body has the world at a halt
Your deep colored eyes trap me within a maze in which I dont want to escape
Your existance alone proves that God is very much real
Your uncontested beauty & unique nature proves that he 'took out time' to create you
Your angelic appearance brings meaning and life to the word 'beautiful' and
Your 'significant other' wants you to know that this poem and his heart is 'All Yours', no pun intended.."
Next Stop Insanity,Josh Patterson,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Deep in thought, smokin trees with one of my niggas Misery, he never leaves, but causes grief. so I dont like him all that much, but he seems to be the only nigga giving a fuck, about me, so he seizes the oppurtunity, enters into my brain, and on my conscious is where that muthafucka sleeps, he killed my old niqqah named peace, took his keys, now he's driving me crazy.. and on the way there, we met up with my niqqah Tragedy, and he brung this niqqah named Agony, before we could pack up our bags and leave, I began to imagine the, possibility that I could be goin insane, meanwhile back in my brain, I packed up my shame, and gassed up my plane cause I thought i'd always be fly but then Pain came, and sed that we was ridin wit him, sed a storm was comin, and the chances of surving the flight would be slim, so him, me, Tragedy, Misery, and Agony continued on this journey lacking streets, I start squirmin in my seat, and began to scream, but pain shot through my veins and it seemed, tha more I sreamed, tha more Pain was entertained, so I blacked out with my sack out fuckin the Earth, and wen I snapped out, I saw black clouds & then I heard.. ""You have reached your destination: Insanity!! fueled by hatred, you can't escape it, your stripped naked, of your mental peace, only way out is to make your temples bleed.. throw up the steel, and give it a squeeze!!"" However if I never had severed my bonds with Christ, I never wud have developed these crazy thoughts in my mind.. but I guess im payin for it now, layin on the ground, I wait, for anybodys aid, prayin for an ounce of faith, and now you kno tha place, where ii gave it all away.. Insanity's my fate.."
MCs Act Like They Dont Know,KRS-One,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Clap your hands everybody, if you got what it takes
'Cause I'm KRS and I'm on the mic, and Premier's on The Breaks
Goin' out to the hardcore hip hop
Goin' out to the hardcore hip hop
Of course we don't flip flop

[Verse 1]
If you don't know me by now I doubt you'll ever know me
I never won a Grammy, I won't win a Tony
But I'm not the only MC keepin' it real
When I grab the mic to smash a rapper, girls go, ""Ill""
Check the time as I rhyme, it's 1995
Whenever I arrive the party gets liver
Flow with the master rhymer, as I leave behind
The video rapper, you know, the chart climber
Clapper, down goes another rapper
Onto another matter, punch up the data, Blastmaster
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody
Call up KRS, I'm guaranteed to rip a party
Flat top, braids, bald heads or knotty dreads
There once was a story about a man named Jed
But now Jed is dead, all his kids instead
Want to kick rhymes off the top of they head
Word, what go around come around I figure
Now we got white kids callin' themselves niggas
The tables turned as the crosses burned
Remember You Must Learn
About the styles I flip and how wild I get
I go on like a space age rocket ship
You could be a mack, a pimp, hustler or player
But make sure live you is a dope rhyme sayer
[Chorus]
MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know

[Verse 2]
This is what you waited all year for
The hardcore, that's what KRS is here for
Big up Grand Wizard Theodore, gettin' ill
If you see then ya saw I'm in your grill with mad skill
MC's can only battle with rhymes that got punchlines
Let's battle to see who headlines
Instead of flow for flow let's go show for show
Toe for toe, yo, you better act like you know
Too many MC's take that word 'emcee' lightly
They can't Move a Crowd, not even slightly
It might be the fact that they express wackness
Let me show ya whose ass is the blackest
I flip a script a little bit, you ride the tip and shit
Too sick to get with it, admit you bit, your style is counterfeit
Now tone it down a bit
My title you will never get, I'm too intelligent
I'll send your family my sentiments, my style is toxic
When I rock and shock and hip hop it unlock your head, I knock it
It split quick from the lyric
Direct hit, perfect fit, you can't get with it
[Chorus]
MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know

[Verse 3]
Some MC's don't like the KRS but they must respect him
Cos they know this kid gets all up in they rectum
Slappin' and selectin' em, checkin' em, disrespectin' em
Just deckin' em, deckin' em, deck-in' em
Who in their right mind can mimic a style like mine
I design rhyme and get mine all the time
MC's standin' on the sidelines, always dissin'
When I roll up and rush their crew, they start bitchin'
I don't burn, I don't freeze, yet some MC's
Believe they could tango with the likes of these
Cross your t's and dot your i's whenever I arrive
Wide, magnified, live like the ocean tide
You dope, you lied, I reside like Artifacts
On the Wrong Side of Da Tracks, electrified
Comin' around the mountain, you run and hide
Hopin' your defence mechanism can divert my heat-seeking lyricism
As I spark mad izm
The 1996 lyrical style's what I give 'em

[Chorus]
MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know"
Let It Rain,Tinchy Stryder,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1 - Tinchy ]
Black clouds are looking darker
We bring the night to life
I hope you got your lighter
Spark the match and light
Somehow we all survived
Although they dimmed the lights
They try to knock my future down
The trees they tried to hide
They say I’m an optimist
Now look I topped the list
Approved but not to this
From negative to positive
Yeah, don’t fight the planes
No parachutes, we let it rain
From the inn I brought my troops

[Pre-Hook - Melanie Fiona]
Forecast to be grey again
Feels as if it never ends
Hide behind the door
Anymore
[Hook - Tinchy & Melanie Fiona]
Let it rain
Let it rain
You see the drip-drop coming?
Everybody give way
Can’t stop forming
May as well embrace
Let it rain
Let it rain
Let it rain
You see the drip-drop coming
Everybody give way

[Verse 2 - Tinchy]
Said I would'nt last for long
Said I had one hit and wondered my parted songs
Asking whats the label on
Had this came along
Why the hell designer writes
Told my ANR he’s okay but now the game is wrong
Now picture this
Now I’ve got hits they'll miss
I’ve planned it all
To rule, and black the mist
And now it’s ours
Let it rain for hours
From the basement to the rooftops
We just played the powers

[Pre-Hook - Melanie Fiona]
Forecast to be grey again
Feels as if it never ends
Hide behind the door
Anymore

[Hook - Tinchy & Melanie Fiona]
Let it rain
Let it rain
You see the drip-drop coming?
Everybody give way
Can’t stop forming
May as well embrace
Let it rain
Let it rain
Let it rain
You see the drip-drop coming
Everybody give way

[Bridge - Melanie Fiona & Tinchy]
I’m stepping out tonight
There’s a life with more(I hear it calling)
I’m afraid no more (can’t stop me falling)
Behind the grey there’s light (Black clouds)
I’mma reach it by (Running or crawling)
At the end, I know I’m gonna to be alright
Hope they keep it moving on
No time on dwelling on
They hum, we sing along (We’re gonna be alright)
I know you see, In fact they all believe
Them clouds above of me
[Hook - Tinchy & Melanie Fiona]
I let it rain
Let it rain
You see the  drip-drop coming?
Everybody give way
Can’t stop forming
May as well embrace
Let it rain, oh
You see the drip-drop coming
Everybody give way (Yeah)

See life is like a test that I ain't never got no “F” in
Stepping out today, I got leave the crib
Momma stressing , I pray
That ain't no body gon’ pull the weapon out and spray
Cuz I don’t got no strap
And ever since we hit the depression niggas don know how to act
In, fact there goes some niggas there
Hating, I feel the stare
Me vs you shining is like a diamond and silverware
Let ya’ll feel the glare I got to go now
I riding through the city with the windows roll down
Shorty holla, so I pulled up beside her
Im fronting “Whats your name?”
She told me “boy you know me don’t play no games-
Now look they say you blowing up hey is it true, right up?”
I say, “ Girl they wasn’t kidding like your tubes tied up”

I'm hollering hey, good God what a day
I gotta say it feels good to get away
Where ain't nobody stressing over shit they got to pay
Ay tell me whats work without play
All my niggas hollering hey, good God what a day
Hey baby girl tell me can you get away?
Where ain't nobody hollering bout the problems of the world

Okay so word is spreading
That I done jetted to New York- I was just up there doing my thing
So now some folks I used to know is hollering out “J. Cole!”
I got to chuckle cuz I know they used to say Jermaine
So who changed?
Whats in name though, when niggas can't hang though-your shoe strings
Your flow insane plus I got that flame throw, that Luke Payne
Even in the winter we bring, feelings of summer Suzan
We get them hooked like T-Pain
And scoop them hoes like loose change
Can you blame me?- Im just a boy straight out the Ville
These wangsta ass niggas getting played out for real
Your acting like your trill, nigga you bet not!
You talking out your ass, you feinna get your head rocked!

Love In Love Out,Cormega,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by J-Love]

[Verse 1]
When I came home from jail we was brothers
Your beef was my beef
Remember that time with Butta on your video set
When he was talking 'bout shooting
If you don't pay him, then I got into it
Son you gave me a hundred dollars when I came home
I didn't complain I wasn't in it to gain
You my nigga when you hot and when the temperature changed
Now we enemies, 'til we enter the grave
When I got signed to Def Jam I offered you ten grand
You said you didn't want it, then you started acting funny
It started with the cover of YSB
A picture of The Firm, everyone except me
Then my voice disappeared off La Familia
That's when it was clear to me there wasn't no real love
I was out The Firm, unless I signed a production deal
Which I didn't do 'cause son, that wasn't real
I was never jealous of you in fact I was proud of you
I smiled when I heard you on Live at the Barbeque
I respect you as an artist though I'm no longer fond of you
I gave you love from the heart unlike the people surrounding you
[Chorus]
Love in, love out
Nowadays is no honor, only drama
Your friend today can be your enemy tomorrow
Never show weakness, tell 'em no secrets
What's deep is, I had love for you
But due to situations, I can't fuck with you
Trust is a luxury I can't afford
Betrayal's something that I can't ignore

[Verse 2]
My love is real, some earn it, some are unworthy
Some, walk in the presence of men with thoughts to hurt me
And wonder why I throw shade and stay to myself
'Cause I'm me, plus I'm not betraying myself
I'm free from the burden of extending my hand
To my man's that don't deserve it, I only trust fam
When I was locked up, you was doing you excluded me
You should be happy now that I'm doing me
Niggas, acting like I won't give if I have it
I got a question: Who came to Spank wake empty handed?
You smile in my face yet your eyes reveal the hate
Next time you talk about me, mention I ain't fake
I'm living my dream, live yours, I gave sweat and tears
You didn't even buy my CD, you say you my man? (uh)
You so jealous your emotions make you careless
I hope when you hear this it makes you think before you staring
At your last I hear you scheming
I'm reading you your last right
Get your mind off primitive thoughts and get your cats right
I'm not limited, without rap I'd still be getting it
Yours truly, the dealer slash lyricist
[Chorus]
Love in, love out
Nowadays is no honor, only drama
Your friend today can be your enemy tomorrow
Never show weakness, tell 'em no secrets
What's deep is, I had love for you
But due to situations, I can't fuck with you

Betrayal's something that I can't ignore"

I’m goin’ for the gold
My heart is in control, my mind is on succeed
And I am in the lead
Don’t buy into the schemes
The science or stratege
Just giant N-U-T’s brings triumph and relief
I’m reliant on redeem, inspired by the green
Never tieing off of fatigue, never defiant to my team
Never lying on the thing until I’m lying on the thing
Hooked to wires and things I’m a die as a king
If I don’t do it now I’m a try it again
And when I do accomplish it
I’m a try it again, I’m a riot insane
I’m a lion my mane hangs down to my strings
And they’re tied to the game, I stay dry when it rain
I’m tried of the fame
Got everything to gain and I’m proud of the pain
The pride and the plain, the wise and the strange
Denied by the sane besides we’re the same
Whose guiding the train, whose flyin’ the plane
Whose drivin’ the lane
Who dies when it bang, who fires when it bang
Who lies in the aim
Two lives in the drain, who cries when they sang
You hide but you can’t, you hide but you ain’t
I advise you to thank, you’ll find what you can’t
Revive what you taint, survive what you paint
Super-size what you shrank, the fries and the drank

Nothin’s what you did for me, nothin’s what you give to me

Now break all of the limiting, now shake all of the gimicking
The fakery, the trickery, nurse how sick is he, worse I’m sickening

How quick is he, I’ma make sure they mention me for the next century

That ain't nobody gon' pull the weapon out and spray
'Cause I don't got no strap
And ever since we hit depression, niggas don't know how to act
In fact, there goes some niggas there, hating, I feel the stare
Me verse you shining, that's like a diamond and silverware
Let y'all feel the glare I gotta go now
I'm riding through the city with the windows rolled down
Shorty hollered, so I pulled up beside her, I'm fronting, “What's your name?”
She told me, “Boy, you know me, don't play no games
Now, look, they say you're blowing up, hey, is it true, fired up?”
I say, “Girl, they wasn't kidding like they tubes tied up""
[Chorus]
I'm hollering hey
Good God, what a day
I gotta say it feels good to get away
Where ain't nobody stressing over shit they got to pay
Ay tell me what's work without play
All my niggas hollering hey
Good God, what a day
Hey baby girl, tell me can you get away?
Where ain't nobody hollering 'bout the problems of the world
It's just me and my favorite girl
Now all around they holler

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Okay so word been spreading
That I done jetted to New York, I was up there doing my thing
So now some folks I used to know is hollering out “J. Cole!”
I got to chuckle 'cause I know they used to say Jermaine, so who changed?
What's in name though, when niggas can't hang on your shoestrings?
The flow insane plus I got that flamethrow, that Liu Kang
Even in the winter we bring feelings of summer Suzanne
We get them hooked like T-Pain, and scoop them hoes like loose change
Can you blame me? I'm just a boy straight out the Ville
These wangsta-ass niggas getting played out for real
You acting like you trill, nigga you bet' not!
You talking out your ass, you finna get your head rocked
This is where they shooting sideways, boys getting blazed
Can't afford to fly so we get high to get away
Now come here ladies, see we tryna get you loose, pour it up
Take this juice, we gon' mix it with this Goose, don't throw it up
[Chorus]
I'm hollering hey
Good God, what a day
I gotta say it feels good to get away
Where ain't nobody stressing over shit they got to pay
Ay tell me what's work without play
All my niggas hollering hey
Good God, what a day
Hey baby girl tell me can you get away?
Where ain't nobody hollering 'bout the problems of the world
It's just me and my favorite girl
Now all around they holler

Grave Aint No Place,Blaze Ya Dead Homie,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Blaze]
A motherfucker recognize a thug mashin' hard
Straight out the plot of my cemetery yard
Buried so long, nobody gave a shit
Blood and tears, embedded in my casket
Been surrounded, old folks everywhere
Smell of dry piss covered the air
When I heard the voices say arise from the grave
I quickly dug myself out and went to find the 12-gauge
Shotgun, double barrelled sawed off pump
Safety runs thru the target if you test me
Psycho thug, mashin' outta control
Spent too many fuckin' years deep in a hole
But still I'm a killa, feindin' for the streets
Slangin' rocks on a 9 to 5 beat
All that change, now got maggots on my face
I'm back from the dead to give yo ass a taste

[Hook: Twiztid]
The grave ain't no place for a psycho thug killa!
Hustla on the street, neighborhood drug deala!
The grave ain't no place, I should be out mashin!
Never goin' back to my muthafuckin' casket!
The grave ain't no place for a psycho thug killa!
Hustla on the street, neighborhood drug deala!
The grave ain't no place, I should be out mashin!
Never goin' back to my muthafuckin' casket!
[Verse 2: Anybody Killa]
The grave ain't no place to be, too much like the penetentary
Locked away in concrete, I'm buried 6 feet
Guess so, so when you roam, you can find your way home
Cuffs tight around the wrist cause I was bustin' my chrome
Dark visions in the smog when I walk with the dead
Bad dreams in the night keep you shakin' in bed
Is it all in your head cause you're locked in a cage?
And clear your mind and get shanked and live the cemetery way

[Verse 3: Monoxide]
I'm sittin' in the cemetery
I got a plan to kill a pig so I placed a phony call
About a bitch I buried, fuck a cell, I won't ever go back
I got you creasin' in my pocket like a folded up rap
I look in the back, a squad car pullin' up slow
I grabbed the pistol in the hand with the glove, and let it blow
Dashin' off like a theif in the night, to me it was right
I had to end his muthafuckin' life

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Blaze]
They can't keep a dead body locked down
In the ground, of the pen
Came thru the dirt, break free again
Leave my home of the grave, shared with the roaches
Back on the street, keep an eye on the vultures
Flip, my escape out the front gates
When the pigs check yo' friends, ain't no trace
Of a gangsta, I'm already out robbin' suckers
Pistol whippin' bitches, puttin' holes in motherfuckers
Act like you know, Psychopathic on the Glock
And I gives no fuck when I'm mashin' up ya block
Empty out the chamber, so long to your family
Everybody history, nothing left but memories
Friends start to cry and you're one with the earth
Ain't nobody cry for me, not even the church
My rebirth was greeted my a police chase
But I'm a thug motherfucker, I ain't catchin' a case
[Hook x2]

[Skit]
911 Emergency, can I help you?
Would you please send someone to 12 Cherry Nut Lane?
What seems to be the problem, sir?
There's a fuckin' guy beatin' on my door; I don't know what I'm supposed to do... I gotta gun...
Please don't do anything rash
I-I know. I don't wanna have to shoot anybody, but he's bangin'...
Where exactly is he at?
Can-can you hear that? He's banging on the door! Would you go away!
Sir, please calm down
It's hard to calm down; I don't know what I'm supposed to do!
Listen to me, sir. Listen to me...
I don't know if this is a fuckin' Halloween prank or not, but I am scared...ok?!
Sir...
And I don't want to have... to hurt someone!!! Would you please... Send someone over here right now!!!"
Hatchet Execution,Blaze Ya Dead Homie,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Shaggy 2 Dope]
I represent Southwest, Del-Ray Jefferson
Festival ridin', we deemed around the Mexican
Me and Violent J, we murder heroin addicts
With every different saws, screwdrivers, and automatics
I like killin' anybody, I'm like Anybody Killa
I'm stompin' thru yo' city like a little Godzilla
I'll cut ya dick and balls off and make ya eat em'
Then choke yo' ass to death so you won't even need em'
Punk bitch!

[Verse 2: Anybody Killa]
You ever felt like you a freak in the night?
Outcasted to the shadows cuz you don't look right
Hypnotized by the eyes from the average muthafucka
Chrome to his dome, if he cries, he's a busta
There's certain rituals for bein' ghetto
Keep yo' ass underground, when it's dark, go balistic
I'm representin' all the crazy juggalos
With a hatchet in they hand, smokin' blunts after shows
[Verse 3: Violent J]
Think about it, you gotta give it up to Blaze
I mean the guy is fuckin' dead in 47 different ways
Yet he's leavin' Heaven hangin'
And chillin' with his boys
At least until they get his room ready in the Nethervoid
For now he hits the joint until it ain't none left
Which ain't bad for a dead guy supposedly with no breath
Death ain't scary, look at Blaze, he's straight
Even with the maggots and all, he looks great

[Hook: Violent J]
Because I take out my hatchet and I quickly start axin'
I go juggaloco like a crazy assassin
Twiztid and the Posse, we say nothing confusing
Why? Why? Why?
It's just a hatchet execution.....
A Psychopathic execution

[Verse 4: Monoxide]
Throw it up y'all, lemme see yo' set shinin', rhymin'
For this paper, ain't nothin', get back to grindin'
On the Eastside we ride and Drive-By
And if you actin' live, kiss yo' mama and wave her bye-bye
I try to get along and it don't work, I love to hurt
Whip out the pistol and do the dirt
I lay em' all down, shootin' in crowds and head-bustin'
Have yo' people cussin'
He shot that muthafucka for nothin'
[Verse 5: Blaze]
I'm that dead body walkin' retarded and crazy
And I'm down to bust shots at cops on the daily
Still claimin' Eastside but sides ain't shit
Cuz we all got love for the muthafuckin' hatchet
I got a little problem with actin' a fool
I get Violent like J and then I spray up the room
Unfadable, real G's never goin' out
So I died, now I'm back, and I blast, and I'm out!

[Verse 6: Jamie Madrox]
Rock N Rye with Hennessy
Dirty sex in alleyways
Chillin' with the heads, drug dealers, and the runaways
Killa, put yo' gun away
Don't make me take yo' life
Type of muthafucka bring an axe to a gunfight
Represent the family with the utmost pride
And we runnin' with a hatchet, muthafucka, do or die
Die muthafucka is what I'm screamin' when they go
And 187 on a muthafuckin' juggahoe!

Rap Ambush,MF DOOM,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
So we're gonna stand on perimeter
We did have some shots fired right down the street on us
While this was goin on, so we gotta set up a tight perimeter
We got the streets blocked off
To make sure we don't have any drivebys on us
Other than that, the operation went fairly well
Hell no, this shit is crazy
Where is it they're coming from?
I don't believe that shit

[Verse]
Who told you that? Rolled through, brrat!
Old to the new knows who holds the hat
Custom tailored fitted, head stayed same size
Big since first born, well spitted game wise
Same guy, same disguise
Sick aim eye stare at thick dame thighs, click claim prize
And the lucky contestant was sent
A whole year's supply of buckets of yucky excrement
Digital format, provide the ROM
Ride calm, flow was like a roadside bomb (Woo)
Flipped the Humvee, impact was limb-numbing
Cameraman wig back, gunner screaming ""Incoming!""
RPG, rhyme propelled grenade
Time to yell, scramble for cover in the shade
Bright as the midday sun, then it fade
Darkness come quick, some run and get sprayed
Rot dead, hot lead, it's rainin'
Left 'em with they brains kicked in with they trainin'
Dragged the remains into the open by the bootstraps
Dog tag attached to explosive human booby traps
Where's air support? Ears ringin', mortars whistlin'
Bloodshot vision, afterthought: abort mission
Too little too late, as the last man gush
Took no prisoners mush, rap ambush

One more time, one more time

[Verse 1]
I dream of the day I can go back to when I was born
Layin' in your arms, wishin' you was here today, Mom
Wish you'd appear, just for a second from Heaven
My tears would be gone, I wouldn't be rappin' this song
I'd be happy drivin' up to your eight-bedroom mansion
Up late, laughin' about the hard times we faced
The galaxy is so enchantin' beyond, Galileo's understandin'
Past the Milky Way and all the planets
There's somethin' out there greater, but only God knows
Scientists claim we came from apes, but they lies though
That was part of our conversation
I spark one up and start blazin'
Thinkin' of how amazin' she was, an angel gave me love
I'm thankful to ever know a woman so real
I pray, when I marry, my wife'll have one of your skills
But Mom, you could never be replaced
I'd give my life up just to see you one more day, to have—
[Chorus]
One more dance with you, Momma
If I could only have
One more dance with you, Momma
Praying, wishing that I could have
One more dance with you, Momma
If I could only have
One more dance with you, Momma

[Verse 2]
I wish you were here, I miss you more each second I breathe
You resting in peace, forever, I accepted you free
A blessing to me, I see you dressed in all white
Smilin' at me, happy, knowin' everything's all right
If only I could hear your voice and your laughter
Just one more time, my chest would be filled up with sunshine
April 7th '02, that's when the gates of Heaven opened up
For you to stroll through, beautiful Anne Jones
Job is done, raising ghetto kids in the hood
You was my strength to carry on, and now I'm good
Job well done, you lived through your sons and grandchildren
Jesus finally got his bride, Mommy, dance with him!
And you've been my guide through all the trouble I faced
They playin' our song, the life-beat, my hand on your waist
I grab your other hand, I'm tryin' not to step on your toes
Spin you around with my eyes closed, dreaming I can have—
[Chorus]
One more dance with you, Momma
If I could only have
One more dance with you, Momma
Praying, wishing that I could have
One more dance with you, Momma
If I could only have
One more dance with you, Momma

All about the Benji's, competition can't fuck with me
Know these nigga's envy green bottle Remy fifty, in my semi
Waka Flocka Flame, I'm not friendly
I'm so motherfucking neighborhood, let's get that understood
I'm not crossing over, this ain't b-ball
Got partners behind the g-wall, 30 for a murder, dog

Put a little of this, with a little of that
But ain't nothing little about that there, cat
Triple black, back to back
By myself, still back to back
Call me stacks, because I got them racks
Got them green bags, duffel bags, can't hold cash
CEO, labled as, and it cost a price tag, but made me glad
I'm so jazz, I'm so class
I don't need no bronco to make me mad
Bitch ain't bad
Watch them chest and the mouth like a mad, got more bags in his stash

Don't like me because I'm fucking Icy

Babylon,ILL BILL,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Howard Jones]
Imagine you were given one hour
Exactly sixty minutes and zero seconds to put your entire life
And the world around you in total perspective
What would you say? What would it sound like?

[Choir music (By The Waters of Babylon)]
By the waters the waters of Babylon
We lay down and wept and wept for Thee Zion
We remember we remember we remember Thee Zion

[Ill Bill]
We've unraveled the Bible code, the rifle explodes
Demand attention like a knife in your throat
They're controlling the price of your soul
Titans of stone, psychic totalitarian
Biotelemetric mind control experimentation is various
Narcotics made to inflict pain and madness
Assassins with multiple personalities
Active with full access
A backstage pass to cover up spectacular assassinations
And arms deals across the axis
Another witch hunt, religious radicals with big guns
Big plans, invisible cameras built in Japan
CIA behaviour control scientists in the cults
And formed an alliance of cult leaders, also their clients
Tech-savvy hijacker associates board planes
To practice, anxiously awaiting their global audience
Enter the core, I feel this with ease
The ultimate reality series, loaded with cameras, angles, and theories
Now hear me
[Hook]
A golden helmet blinded minds
Among ten thousand swords
Along the road to Babylon
A golden thunder silenced songs
Among ten thousand voices
On the road to Babylon

[Ill Bill]
This operation doesn't exist
The revolution will be classified
Live broadcast from the abyss
Our cities are crack spots and cardboard condominiums
Vicious and trackmarks cross minds lost in delirium
The towers dropped, blind fools, confusion who knew?
Now the world watch Saddam's execution on YouTube
Propaganda machines wage media Jihad
A teen walking to a crowded movie theatre with bombs
Reading the Qur'an, silently obedient to God
Known by many different names: Hashem, Jesus, and Allah
Exploding porn, shadow government protocols
Go to war amongst ten thousand voices on the road to Babylon
Patriot Act, sanctioned exorcism
Iranian and North Korean-built weapon systems
Budgets increase to payroll hundreds of creeps
Number of the beast, bomb London under the streets
The engineer was a popular peer
His value compared to having nuclear weapons to shower the air
A thin line between power and fear
A martyr in tears, goodbye father
Now my final hour is here, help me

I'm Barry Sanders slashing through the path
You a magician's assistant, I'm sawing you in half
You a heathen that rely on the beast
I'm a demon at the fire crucifying the priest
I shine over beats, a motherfucking beast on the mic
I'm a lion out the jungle, raw meat what I like
I bleed in a fight, Vinnie like the taste of his blood
And I'll open up your stomach like the case of a slug
I'm faithful to drugs, putting metal plates in your mug
Dump your body in the motherfucking lake in a rug
Face in the mud, y'all create the facade
That my people have exterminated faith in their God

Turn blood into wine with an insatiable taste
Drink from the goblet of gore, vomiting porn

Get me outta here I'd rather fucking stay in Iran

Niggas count to four and E-Rickets
Out the fuckin' door and
All the time now I'mma wreck the fly shit
Crabs - steady - screamin' oh my it hurts
Please don't put the gun to my ear
I do anything you want say anything you wanna hear
Say fuck Crabs now
I might let you live
Baby Sick got something for you
Should I tell you what it is
What the Piru like
You better tell it fast
Unless you want a rose up your dead funky ass
Wass happenin' Blood? If you say Crab I say killa
Fool, I'm bangin' 24-7 now will the
Niggas with heart - to be one of the few
Tell that dusty-ass Crabs
Just what they should do
Baby Sick said let 'em hear a pop
Drop the Crab - grab the Glock
Boo boo flag and bhakis got flamed up no doubt
The Crab lost his life cause there's never
No way out
[LILI]
Here we go again
Doin' shit just to get paid
Gettin' rough, rugged through blue that you can't fade
Play the B-Side, the C-Side is wack
Gettin' busy with the K gang
Now you know where I stay at
Hey Mr. Do Or Die I saw you mackin' to my ho
But see it was a setup
So I can pull a do-low
Sit your ass up got my niggas like I should
So I call the homie Bone
Yo there's Crabs in the hood
But he got away cause he ran
Through ?? pass Woodworth
Now he's goin' down 1-0-4

[RED RAG a.k.a BIG WY]
Once again it's the Dallas mafioso
The only times I like Crabs when I'm eatin' on gumbo
It's different types of Crabs like the ones that make ya - itch
Tha shit you get
For fuckin' a Ricket bitch
Mess with funky cock trip with no C's
Swap Meet shop on County check recipient
I'm creepin' through the hood like Freddy Krueger your worst dream
When I leave
Your hood is a crime scene
Remember that peace shit don't bring it to the Bottomsville
Like Seven Up never had it - never will
Please M gang everybody is peacin' and the Mafia's peacin'
Niggas you tweakin'
Run run Rickets keep on the hidin'
I'm Red Rag and I'm keep on ridin' no way out
[REDRUM 781]
I keep on ridin' with the strap in my lap
You're fuckin' around and I'll be poppin' hollow point caps
I'm pointin' that niggas snaps on the back of they skull
Blowin' up your hand cause your gang sign is dull
And I've got love for the 'Ru's
The Bloods are included Redrum 7-8-1 Crabs are deluted
My Gathors givin' a kick
Much harder than a push
You fuck with my bitch so you get caught up in my ambush
Work up back to me to givin' a blast
As soon as his Crab-ass party I have to crash
I dash - to the cut
Grab the Gats so I can end them
The Crab motherfuckers want no what hit them
Now, I'm creepin' through the alley like a shadow ready for battle
The backyard is pack with
People like some cattle
The Ricket nigga thought that I was playin'
So I hopped on the walls and start to sprayin'
Aimin' for the door waitin' for the Crab to bum rush
For the head turnin' brains into slush
Payback's the bitch, Blood that's what I'm about
And when I'm on your ass nigga, it ain't no motherfuckin' way out"

Now in the Bity of Bompton
Lime Hood is down with the Mob
Holly Hood and Cross Atlantic off of Bompton Boulevard
Every town has an Elm Street but not a Freddy Krueger
Don't get caught in the Jungle's or a park called Lueders
On Rosecrans pass Oleander at the light
Tree Top is to the left, Fruit Town is on the right
1-5-1's and Westside Pirus slang past dark
And the only other Blood hood is Campanella Park
Hacienda, Swans and Bounty Hunters'll call your number
Rollin' 30's and 20's Outlaws, Sixx Deuce Brims will put you under
Cabbage Patch, Center Park, Harvard Park, Athens Park too

Now, the settin is in the muthafuckin' oneway
Niggas banged up, meetin' up on a Sunday
Run across the street just to get some brews and shit
Well, what do you know? A nigga slippin' wearin' flue and shit
It's on, I take the flag out my pocket
Then wrap it around my knuckles make a fist and lock it
Deposit a blow to the jaw as I bank him
Break a 40 on top of the counter then I shank him
Leave him layin' in the color he hates the most
But it don't matter now cause he's a gangbangin' ghost
Crab is the meat on my menu
Piru is the gang. Hell, I was been through
But I'm a soldier to the very end
I hate Crabs with the passion, my attitude is grim, so
I slip clips in the automatics
Niggas wanna roll through, no, I ain't havin' it
The homies are down and the girls are obedient
Crabs ain't naythin' but gumbo ingredients
Steadily gettin' dip addin' dogs to the roster
What d'you call a ugly Crip? What? A c-monster
[Verse 3: Bloody Mary]
Piru is Crip in reverse but the C's on its back
Your egg shell-lobster lie-ass face is gonna crack
Crip: beware of the true, the glitty-glitty Glock tick-tock
Crabs I stop Piru, yo
Your momma can suck a dogs dick and die
Chicken little Crab scared of the red apples fallin' from the sky
D-Ropped and A-Bomb E-Ricket Blood was shed
A-C-N-D
Another Crab Nigga Dead
Oh muthafuckin' well punk bitches
Come over to my place, I'll take
You on a little trip, it
Starts with the R
Ends with E-D
The riverbed you'll be lyin' and lookin' up at me
Crab-ass ho's
They get the fuckin' middle
Niggas think it's a joke
It ain't no muthafuckin' riddle
Your rat pack'll get packed right in a box, sent to
Your dead homies, momma right down to the block
Niggas felt like they hard and then they gon' try check me
I finna let your ass know
You need to respect me
Cause although you ain't sayin' shit
You gettin' on my nerves
Fluster-ass flue-wearin' niggas gettin' served

Piruuuuuu Loooooove, baaabyyyy

[Verse 4: Redrum 781]
Back on the set after being locked down
Crabs locked down and I love the way a Glock sounds
Crownin' muthafuckas like checkers
And I be puttin' niggas to sleep so they will respect us (ohh yeah)
I got a vision in my head and you're a dead man
When I roll in a stole red minivan
I'm on a mission through the muthafuckin' East Side Inglewood against Compton
A C-K Ride
I glide throught the park in the dark with my gun out
Bickin' back being bool in a little dugout
Wait for the moment to serve 'em
What the muthafuckas don't know
Just might hurt 'em
I cocked back the goddamn hammer
And aim - directly for the fool who talkin' shit up in the slammer
I guess he thought that I forgot but no
I didn't for the one that caught the slug - good riddance
And if you wanna run for the trees
I'mma stop all that - by shooting for the knees

Trip - a bitch in red make a B.G. if
I disagree with the homies cause I ain't mackin' to no Slob bitch
The wrong Kelly to fuck with
To press your luck with
A Kelly you don't want to get stuck with
White ducks better watch their dome
When I'm on 7-6 with my muthafuckin' chrome
It's like a nightmare on Elm street when I creep
And lay them niggas down for the K.P
Blue coat, blue beanie and blue Chucks
On your Avenues shit out of luck and stuck

Last a second, come to checkin' all you slobs with the quickness
Dumpin' with  the Tec you close you're eyes and try you wish this
This was a dream and  maybe one day you'll wake up

And just to let you know I ain't no muthafuckin' ho
Hot feeling full of lead and leave your body on the floor

Have you ever been to heaven at night?
Closing your eyes, the feeling so right
At first you might see just one bright beam of light
Clutching your soul to the toll of the bright
Happy unites and feelings take flight
Blind to the evils, you give them no sight
Focus on floatin', your focus is tight
Like you rewrote an essay for a class, to pass in the night
Have you ever seen an ending so nice?
You feel so free, like you're high as a kite
Like how you feel if you drink some Bud Light, followed by Jag
Models who smile, then tilt their head back
These are a few of the visions I like
Mixed in with light, these are my favorites to dream in the night
This is my heaven at night

Have you
Ever been to heaven at night?

Can we get much higher............
But of course we can baby hahaha

[Los]
Ummm its Los .. again
Okay I take my middle finger, flick it to the wicked media
Critics on my dick, clicking a nigga’s wikipedia
Flow more intricate than the period of pyramids
Whack rappers lack what the Pythagorean Theorem is
My mathematics will trip you have your shoes tangled
I think it’s funny, you come at me from acute angle
I could of grabbed all my weapons and took a T.I
But I ain’t gotta see you to kill you, Book of Eli
Nikka we fly, the first time you hooker glanced
I hit it from the back and did the skully low Brooklyn dance
The Rico from Paid in Full while everybody look and dance
Fucked her in the kitchen, did the Lil B Cooking Dance
I took a chance with Puffy and lost six years
But how he gon fix my problems? He can’t fix his
This year, I ain’t prepared to take my next L
Last year, I got X but this year, I excel, ahem, please pardon my pun
Each part of my jargons like jog, yo he starting to run
He talking to pun, me, you see me sparking my gun
I go retarded with these bars, I'mma talk in my pun
This chick in back of me, bought me a daiquiri
Sat beside me, said hi, I’m Daphne
Actually, you attracted me after I heard you rapping
There’s something ,just happened magically
Automatically grabbing me, sorta drastic dramatically
Staggering off to jack but accurately adapting
To dudes in black hats and the jackets was thinking, jacking me
But I’m packing ratchets for static that happens gradually
Told that bitch imagine me casually falling, casualty
Grab the gat and blasted the cats in hats in back of me
Killed the bitch at the bar then sat back, just had my daiquiri
I think these rappers be scared to step an inch in my sector
‘Cause I school that ass like a Princeton professor
You approach your bars with hesitation
I approach mine with a Harvard’s education
Yeah I dropped outta college and could of went to jail
But I don’t like regular people, I should of went to Yale
I’m just venting hell, think I need a book deal
Can we get much higher? I feel how the hook feel
And I’m rolling in that Rolls Royce, bumping Seal
You know the one with the white bitch on the ugly grill
I ain’t talking ‘bout Seal, I’m talking ‘bout the car
Had to clarify that ’cause niggas be talking ‘bout my bars
Your time’s up dog, I’m cleaning out the cell
I jump on songs and snap like I’m singing acapella
Can we get much higher? I feel how the hook feel. So this it for your career
The way I’m ‘bout to start this bidding war
You gon’ think I’m selling missiles to Korea
It’s official, get it clear, this tre that I’m packing
Ain’t singing you a song when it hit you in the ear
So warn your whole village, I’m coming to kill every king
Right now, the score is them nothing, me everything
I feel like they gave me nothing and them everything
So I ain’t just rapping and bluffing, I mean everything
I’m bout to have y’all niggas mad at me
I wrote this blindfolded, dark twisted fantasy
Can we get much higher? Can we get much higher? Can we get much higher?"
Dizzy,Outasight,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Outasight]
I started out on Burgundy but soon hit the harder stuff
Call this Richard Andrew’s blues
I could feel the morning ‘round the corner and it’s killing my buzz
In the back, I hear the news
You got something that really makes me spin
Like an orange quarter water and a fifth of gin
Punch-drunk love and a wide eyed grin
I was looking to score so I took her to the tin
Rejected, I’m hooked like Kareem
A fiend for obscene, I scream to cause a scene
Um, that’s where it gets fizzy
Another late night feeling kinda dizzy

[Hook]
I’m feeling so dizzy
Shit keeps moving ‘round and getting me all dizzy
Watching the world spin

[Verse 2: Outasight]
Well it’s one shot and two shots and three shots and floor
Every time I think I’m done, I keep on coming back for more
And my job kinda sucks, everyday’s such a bore
And I want a bunch of new shit but I’m poor
All you ask is when you gonna grow up?
And what you gonna do when you don’t blow up?
Go throw another show where no one shows up
Drink too much Jameson and have to throw up
You know what? You probably right
What kinda grown man calls himself Outasight?
But that’s life baby, trying to stay busy
But all this damn talk got the boy feeling so dizzy
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Outasight]
I ain’t saying that I messed up, I been cleaning up myself
I shaved my face and cut my hair and put on a belt
And people come and go like I'm flicking through cable
That's where its gets a little tricky and leaves a guy feeling dizzy

[Hook]"
Good Evening Dream Big,Outasight,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
Good morning, good evening
I hope you like dreaming
You live to learn and you learn to live
It’s positive and negative
I can’t sleep but I dream big
I can’t sleep but I dream big
I can’t sleep but I dream big
Good evening…

[Verse 1: Outasight]
Well it’s hard to get to bed with a head full of dreams
Pocket full of loose change, ripping at the seams
And it’s hard to keep moving with a head full of steam
It’s the green, it’s the scene, it’s everything
Hard to gain perspective when your eyes won’t close
It’s hard to stand tall when you already on your toes
Money can’t grow on trees, yeah, I know
It’s the dough, it’s the show that got me all froze
And I wanna change my whole life
And running out of gas, tell me who gonna siphon
I’m liking my chances but I don’t say jack
Spin the wheel of fortune like I’m Sajak
And all I wanna do is ride in a Maybach
And look real important but please don’t say that
That’s all that matters to me, why can’t I just dream?
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Outasight]
Well it’s hard to find peace when you’re fighting in a war
Hard to see the stars when you sleeping on the floor
Take what you can get, grab for a little more
At the mall, let’s ball, who cares about debt anymore?
No freebies, staying alive like the bee gees
If they renting on easy street, believe me, I’m buying a penthouse, yeah
Until then though, I got to get those flows
That I do through the ghettos and suburbs alike
‘Cause I really like things that are nice
Greed is my only vice but I know it’s natural
So I'mma do what I have to do
And when I finally get some rest, I can dream about shit that is fresh

[Hook 2]
Good morning, good evening
I hope you like dreaming
You live to learn and you learn to live
It’s positive and negative
I can’t sleep but I dream big
I can’t sleep but I dream big
I can’t sleep but I dream big
Good evening, good evening
Good evening, good evening, good evening
Good morning, good evening
I hope you like dreaming
You live to learn and you learn to live
It’s positive and negative
I can’t sleep but I dream big
I can’t sleep but I dream big
I can’t sleep but I dream big
Good evening…"
Slob 187,Bloods & Crips,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Scarface]
I woke up one morning
Ran outside because I seen yellow tape
Another Slob lying down because he tried to escape
Another A-T-L-A-N-T-I-C B-D drive-by
As his mama, daddy screamin', cryin' ask me why
But they don't know that I don't give a fuck
I hope to meet wagon van man hurry up and clean this Slob up
My mama told me stay away from the gang
But at the same time I keep my blue rag and my blue strings
I used to drag a Slob down the street, kick out his teeth
And bang his head against the concrete
And my neighbors wasn't no muthafuckin' snitches
I jacked a Slob for his riches when I done in these ditches
You know last year a lotta Slobs made a mistake
They couldn't wait to join a gang so their lives to be take
By me - another down B-G
Scarface Atlantic Drive Compton Crip I can't stand R-E-D
So that's the main point and the facts
So let me grab my gat - bust back
Cause this is Snoop attack
All Slobs should be dead by the 9-5
Cause in the muthafuckin' graves is where the Snoops lyin'
Y'all niggas keep the world a blue atmosphere
Two C's from Compton Crip Cuz and I'm outta here
[Verse 2: Crip Inch]
Betta watch your back
This is Piru 187
Put a Slob on his back with the Mac-11
A Kelly with a gun won't run and hide
It's a nigga Crip Inch and comin' from the East Side
Watch these Slobs just run and duck
Cause I ain't givin' up nuthin' but bad luck
Gotta kill at will
So I pack my steel
Put a Slob on the ground and Cuz that's real
You might say that I'm too far gone
Mind lost and tossed off the edge of the terrordome
Now I'm off to just makin' a brains hang
Runnin' the streets with the muthafuckin' K gang
One down but I still ain't hurt
Cause I'm killin' Slobs off from here to Gettesburg
The Mac-11 gon' pop pop pop
You get a hole in your head cause I just can't stop

[Verse 3: G-Bone]
Slobs can't getaway from this itchy trigga finger
Straight Slob killin' Cuz I'm a Crip
Fuck them niggas
Peel their caps cack with a muthafuckin' Tec-9
Slob-ass niggas better muthafuckin' recognize
This is the Slob killa A-D double C
Flee dog, B-Dog

Sendin' Slob niggas on the stairway to hell
I can't inhale cause I can't stand that dead lobster smell
So dump that nigga in a dizitch
All Slob killa and that includes a Snoop Bitch
They always set a Crip up and won't give a fuck
That's why I stick the Criplettes cause they cock this bomb as fuck
But you know you gotta watch their punk-ass ho's too
Cause some Criplette got love for Dirus
A ho ain't shit
Sure 'nuff by a Slob bitch
Cause they would fuck a Slob
And come suck a Crip dick
I can't trust the ho and I don't fuck with Slobs
I'm a Locsta and fuck all oo-lobs
This is a muthafuckin' C-R-I-P
Ain't no love for an S-L-O-B
[Verse 4: AWOL]
I'm givin' up the K to some Slobs on they dome
Slobs wanna trip, Slob nigga bring it on
Shot a Slob's dome with this 30-06
Infra-red scope with the 30 round clip
A Compton Crip
Bat man, don't step too close
Cause you's a Slob-ass ex Crip nigga from East Coast
That nigga Dog better watch his dome
My dick still in his mouth so my nigga it's on
You ain't a dog, you's a M-U-T
On the nuts of a Compton B-G
Fuck Bangin' On Wax and fuck a True Blue tape
Fuck everybody hood if they dissin' the K
C, I get it strap and I'm ready for a 211
Catch a Slob and it's Slob 187

[Verse 5: Troll Loc]
S-N-Double 'O'-P to the K
Make way when I spray Slobs just ain't safe
Cause it's on with them muthafuckin' off-brand niggas servin' 'Rus like
Dinner with this itchy trigga finger
Puttin' brains to the side walk to end all talk
Bitch Slobs get chalked when they slip and get caught
Fuck all Dirus and the families have made 'em
Niggas grew up claimin' Snoops and now can't shit save 'em
When the set trip is on Slobs cover your dome
I catch a cap to the hat when I'm gattin' the chrome
Lettin' off in your muthafuckin' hood dead rags better duck
Cause a Kelly is up to no good
See you wearing your colors and watch Troll unload
And leave you dead shirt camouflage with 16 holes
Glock 9 causin' doom like that muthafuckin' Armageddon
When I step in Slob's turn bitch when they see my weapon
To the head cause there ain't no love
Ask you: ""Where you from?"" and blast if your ass say Blood
Cause it's a straight Compton Crip
Teachin' oo-lobs
Fuck all y'all
I'm claimin' Slob 187
[Verse 6: Rider J]
Fuck a Slob, fuck a 'Ru
And anybody else too
See Cuz I gotta do for me
Makin' dollars, cluckin' ends for my A-D-C
A 'Ru or a Snoop ain't hard to do away
Grab my 9 if you miss to straight spray niggas
Any Slob killa
You can't come kickin' in my hood muthafucka cause I peel ya
I'm rollin' through your hood with much Crip
Disrespect
Blue'd up on Atlantic and it's time to set

This shit for real so don't be hard
You not the Slob but still
It's like a dream
That's come true
And caught in the zone
Boom, you're through cause I'm serious
I make your life sad
And before you know your life's been had
You started this shit
Made your own rule but you're just too stupid
Sucker you a Snoop, you in a zone
In which we call Atlantic
Cause when you see us comin' know
Don't panic
I want you
I want your whofe damn life
And now I'm fill up to ends
Even smoke your wife but not your kids
Cause they're too young to know
But you fucked up Cuzz
You gotta go"

Smooth baby
Steady dippin'
And for all the B-K's in 93
But you don't hear me though
Straight everyday bangin'
Slangin' you know what I mean?
Uh, the evil-ass C-Side
Steady dippin'

[DO OR DIE]
Back into my neighborhood, stop at daytime
Get a bag of chips and a dollar whine
Roll down Greenleaf, make a left on Caress
Fire up the endo, can't be smokin' on the stress
Hangin' out with Crip figures (fire up the bud Cuz!)
Ready to smoke them Snoops so my finger's on the trigger
Always ready for some set trippin'
That's why I'm dippin' and dappin', crippin' and dippin' never catch me slippin'
All the women ??? (what's up?)
Raise up the phone
And floss with the switch
Front back
And pause on threes
Rag Top Four
Sittin' on them D's
Checkin' ass for the big booty one (damn, she got ass)
Mackin to the skunk and let her ride shotgun
Roll by the park where the case up for hoes
For them straight-up Crips and ??? G roll (what's up Cuz?!)
To stop them gangstas from hangin' like nuts
Even when One-Time pulls up
One-Time'll get checked like a trick
White boys in his gangstas' click
Move on before you can't pass
In April 3rd come back to haunt your ass
You ain't gon' change this gangsta Crip thang
This plain and simple cause thangs don't change
When you're gone (Shit ain't changed Cuz)
We still be crippin'
And makin' cash money
Steady dippin'

Even Boyz N Tha Hood went do or die
Them Crips is rollin' deep and I'm slidin'
Bustin' to just drivin' them ??
That's why I got to beat a Snoop, I gots to have my 9
My ?? in my Rag Top Coupe
In my Caddy hittin' corners, hit the switches
Droppin' quick move fakers on my tip
Like some tricks
6-0 Rollin deep smokin' them Slob 20's Crenshaw Mafia
I kill them good and plenty
C-Note is one down G-Crip
I got my grip tap down in my cleavage
And if a Snoop wanna jack I got my steel deep yet
Strapped down where the tiger ?? at
Gimme another ?? cause I gots him in the prove
Take him to a motel and pull my Long Beach jack move
Me become a Slob? Aw, never!
C-Note: a Rollin' 20 Crip forever

Much Crip love
On a blue day like this
Packin' a .44
Roll in a Crip 6'
They call me Sin Loc
Yes, the G that ain't no joke
The mystery of mess
With a killa Snoop rat flow
See a Slob's brain dread while I'm dippin'
And I'mma hit the fool up
With two C's cause I'm steady crippin'
Sin Loc a mastermind of respect
So you don't get it twisted
Cause if you do Stretch you get stretched
Sayin' to keeps no bustas outta gangbang fool
Much Crip love and we can't stand die-'Rus
Now if it's twisted then I twisted for your kid sake
See cause I'm roll about mine that means I don't fake
So put your dead rag back into your pocket fool
Only thang you swingin' on us nuts when I drop you
Ain't noboby living like no dead rag busta
And when I'm steady dippin'
Respect is from the shoulders
Cause Sin Loc'll peel any Snoop At his own will
But It's time for black folks to try to take a chill pill
And quit going against the grain on each other
Cause worst than dread, I can't stand to see a dead brother
So I ain't trippin' on them bustas if I catch 'em slippin'
I just don't give mines up and just keep steady dippin'

I see them coming see them coming, yeah
They try to bring me down, but I won’t stop
They want me in the ground, but I won’t stop
‘Til I'm gone man, I won’t stop, no
I, I see them coming, coming
They try to bring me down, but I won’t stop
They want me in the ground, but I won’t stop
Until I'm dead man, I won’t stop, yeah

[Verse 1: Sean Kingston]
Yeah, I think they mad cause I'm driving in the fast lane
But I've been grinding for years, ask hype game
It’s funny how stuff doesn’t change
From sleeping in the car to copping me that Range
I'm all world star, and all them other blogs
All them haters hating cause I am a heart throb
But do I want it all?
All the negativity is not gon' get rid of me
I'm here to make history, I'm speaking it real
Back track to the days when I ain't have me a deal, yeah
So I'mma show the world that I'm ill
Every beat that I get on best believe I'mma kill
So you can have all the jewellery, have all the cars
Have all the fame, have all the broads
You can have the fact that I'm a star
Just so you can listen to these bars
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I see them coming see them coming, yeah

They want me in the ground, but I won’t stop
Until I'm dead man, I won’t stop, no

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Yeah, they talk, yeah, they talk, they don’t walk the walk I walk
I won’t stop 'til I drop, until then, I reach the top
I'mma rock to where I need to be, walk the path of destiny
Definitely been neglected, but God is always testing me
Rest in peace to all the men that died that were protecting me
Objectively, I need to tell you what just gets the best of me
Essentially, people in this world just wanna let it be
A lot of men ain't different though, just let it be, set it free
Never be scared to make change, effectively
Always look at things from different ways, perspectively
Every person in this world can do good
I just want this message understood
Alright stop, everybody’s gotta listen
Make the decision to envision a better place with no division
Religion, everybody needs a mission
Haters need to stop it, just listen
[Chorus: Sean Kingston & Justin Bieber]
I see them coming, yeah
They try to bring me down, but I won’t stop
They want me in the ground, but I won’t stop
‘Til I'm gone man, I won’t stop, no
I, I see them coming, coming
They try to bring me down, but I won’t stop
They want me in the ground, but I won’t stop
Until I'm dead, man, I won’t stop, no"

West Savannah,OutKast,"['hip hop', 'blues', 'jazz', 'r&b', 'pop']","[Intro: Big Boi]
Yeah, I’m back off in this bitch one more time
To drop this rhyme, about where my roots at
Yeah, Westside is in the house
Frazier Homes is in the house
Cloverdale is in the house
And Savannah, GA is in the house, so check it…

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
February 1st, 1975 it happened
Was born in West Savannah way before I started rappin'
My mamma had a nigga at the age of fifteen
My daddy was sellin' that sack, now he's gots responsibilities
Stayed at me granny's while me mammy was at work
And she couldn't watch my every move so shit I started servin'
Around Frazier Home, down in the Westside projects
Changin' over foodstamps, and hittin' a lick was next see
I'm just a playa like that, my jeans was sharply creased
I got a fresh white t-shirt and my cap is slightly pointed East
So flyin', or floatin', a Brougham is what I'm sportin'
Sade is in my tape deck, I'm moving in slow motion, boi
So meet me deep in the streets that's where I learned the capers
Us lickin' blunts, lickin' leaves, rolling reefer papers
I'm slightly slouched, in the seats off in my bucket
But the niggas around the Ave. and the hoes, they love me
They wanna be me and my family too
Because the money that I make be puttin' cable off in every room
So follow the fiends, follow my lead through the nooks and crannies
It's everyday life off in my hood so come and holla at me
But go 'head on, with that foolishness bitch
Let me get lovely with my swerve because I'm true to this shit
And if you coming with eight dollars, you shit out of luck
Because the Westside ain't taking no shorts on the dime
So fire it up
[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
Now, now, now, nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!
(like that now, like this, and it don't quit, and it don't stop)
Nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!
(and it don't stop, and it don't quit, it's like that and ah)

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
See, niggas in the South wear gold teeth and gold chains
Been doing it for years, so these niggas ain't gone change
They coming around the ghetto so you might call em soul
Been wearing furry Kangol's, so that shit is old
You might slang a rock or two just to pay the rent
Five dollars for a table dance so now your money's spent
You listen to that booty shake music in your trunk
As long as there's that ""tic tic"" followed by that bump
I'm down to stick a ho if she got a G-string
'Cause the niggas in the Point ain't changed, man
You might call us country, but we's only Southern
And I don't give a fuck, P-Funk spot to spark another

What's the deal-y? I just touched grounds down in Philly
Brought a pound with me, Feds floatin' around silly
Tryna find Lynn; bitch supposed to be in the Benz
Parked in row 10, her and that slow hoe Gwen
Should've known she was a bitch that we both could've boned
If posted alone, the ass had us both in the zone
But you know the rules, both been schooled by older dudes
I know the jewels, no time for them thoughts, too much to lose
Just tryna vibe until them hoes roll with the ride
Where's your joy and pride? You know, little Des' got your eyes

[Verse 2: Nas]
In the cut, drop CLK, the top's up
Left the mall, bought Little Amal the toy truck
Your boy's, what? Three-years-old now, correct?
He and my daughter age neck-and-neck, they future's set
Trees got me wet
In the background's a old cassette — Fly Stephanie Mills shit
What's the deal with all this shit I'm hearin' up top?
You got arrested, shot a fair one with a cop?
That ain't ya stee', you usually low-key when O-T

The shit touched me, tryna chill, just lit a Dutchie
From a while back, same foul cats who tried to bust me
Caught 'em sleepin' in Spanish Harlem with some Puerto Ricans
Up in Washington Heights, right off the Deegan
Feel awful speakin', for some reason, feel the phone's tapped
Alone with gats, left with a vest to watch my own back

Keep your eyes open, stay wise — shit is mind-blowin'
Look for any sign showin' one-time is knowin'
About the dynasty, shit is not minor leagues no more
Cats bleed in this cold war

We rich now, milked the whole cow, split the growth
Now I'm on the Conduit, headlights on
Fluid in the windshield, wipes gone
This light storm that's formin' in the sky
You comin' home tomorrow? Will you drive or will you fly?
Hold up, my other side

Yo, son, some other cats tried to ruin our plans
Sendin' two decoy bitches with pictures of you and your man
Askin' your whereabouts, I gave 'em no leads
For all a nigga know, them hoes fuck with police

No shit, I'm clickin' over, I'mma tell Sos' quick
Son, them outta state bitches tryna get us both hit

Dolla,Fort Minor & Styles of Beyond,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Mike]
Yeah, like that Y'all
Uh huh, whoo, like that
Fort Minor, S.O.B
Yeah, like this, listen

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Attention please, I only need a second
To make a mental impression directly on any record so
Give me space to move, room to prove I'm stupid with the P's and Q's
Ladies and gentlemen I'm sending you bending
Pretending the pen is a needle, I'm injecting the venom
And I'll be damned if I let another man get to me
I'll bruise you with a shoe to the family jewelry
I'm back with fury, attack quickly
Sick with a BIC pen, all up in your shit man
You never knew the flow was sick as this
Bitch, listen when I'm letting you know
Got a grip on these tracks that you wish you got
Got a clique full of assholes, I kid you not
So when that mixtape's done and that album drops
Ryu and Tak and me got it loaded and locked, believe it
[Verse 2: Ryu]
You still breathing? I'm cocking and squeezing
Tucked still? Nope, I don't give a fuck who sees it
Broad days sitting sideways, stuffed in a small cave
For three fucking weeks 'til you reek like dog waste
Ugh, really, I put a punk in his place
Let's see if he freestyles with a pump in his face
Got something to say? Please, better keep it a secret
The streets got hideous ways of handling beef, bitch
So eat shit, hate it or love it, the underdogs on top
Getting faded telling people to suck it
Bucking 'em down for real while you fucking around
I'm stuck in the house for months tryin to sharpen my skills
So how does it feel? You lames want to claim my throne
You got a better chance getting Danny Hayes on the phone
Good luck, I flame suckers 'til they're black and crispy
Sneaking heat up in the club like a flask of whisky

[Verse 3: Tak]
Yeah, I'm here to crack the roof in
You got a nice watch but your raps are useless
You better cut the crap 'fore I snap some nooses
And leave you all snoozing' on some afternoon shit
I hit the streets with a cake and batter for fun
Just to spit bleach in his face
It's lunchtime punk, open the face
Hit you with a punchline 'til you choke on your teeth
Catch me at the show rockin' in that tipsy mode
Like Angels and Demons unlocking DaVinci's Code
One drop in the cannister, people split the globe
Blowing every planet to shit once I hit the road
You in the tight bitch, cut you with apathy
I'm on the night shift, see I hustle like Cassidy
So kick that shit sound and let the west coast see
One of the illest names, Ribkat from S.O.B
[Outro: Green Lantern]
That's right, Fort Minor
We Major, Mike Shinoda, S.O.B

Six-fifty, three hundred my shirt free
Shoot for the sky like a church league, y'all heard me
Absurd G, chickens clucking for bird seeds
But I gotta apologize, no Greece like Xerxes
Won't heat or burn me, I'm the coolest nigga here
Usually defecation, now I'm pissing in your ear
My tablet is the ratchet and the pistols in the rear
I'll bang if it was bangless, now the tracks no longer here
Metaphor, chilling with better whores
Smoking then later on, I bone them like Skeletor
What would I sell this for, this is free distribution
Style, they straight jack it like mental institutions
Outfits is ruthless, now your bitch is choosing
She floating round winners, now your bitch you losing
Yeah, cause I'm the Super Sega Genesis
Salute me, game: invented it, and you can't get no membership, little bitch

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Six hundred sixty-six, leave it for the tip
Of my dick, head, meltin' off and let it rip
Just like a cannon from the teen in Nick
That's equivalent, to the poison in a cigarette
Tyler, The Creator invented some new shit
And it's probably from the Illuminati, Nazi descent, so
If I give a fuck, it's probably from my dick
When I'm Cheneyin' your daughter, she's tied up inside a tent, yeah
Odd Future Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang presents
We're back like a black bitch's hairline indent
The shit I represent is killin' niggas and shit
That's why I traded R. Kelly my sister for a new hit
I get it crackin' like the lips of a nigga, actor
Or a Dahmer when he invited me in for cheese and crackers
Just to watch the Grammys, man she's so attractive
Now he's mad and tryna run me over out with Gacy's tractor
Hop over, run backwards, with a knap sack of green Supreme hats
Like I was sponsored up by the fuckin' Packers
Shittin' on niggas, my tongue considered a laxative
Maxi pad, leave the beat brown like Rihanna lips
Back washing to my gang, you don't wanna take a sip
Fuck Wolf Gang, fuck what? Here let's take a trip
Take a look, to this bullet, now my finger slipped
My only purpose in life to kill myself up on accident
Freshjive, yeah I get it no charge
Dick soft as fuck, but somehow I go hard
Forearm with my gang name, that's an old carve
Chima Ferguson's bangin', you Ace niggas is Low Card, Wolf Gang
[Verse 3: Jasper Dolphin]
Niggas rollin' deep, burners pulled out
Niggas in the street scared
Cause I got the burner in the hand-

Million Man March,Lowkey,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
You might take my life
But you can't take my soul
You can't take my soul
You might take my freedom
But you can't take my soul
You can't take my soul

[Verse 1]
Whether it's a cancer patient or assassination
Or I fought for emancipation
My intentions were pure you can't debate 'em
But no, never ever shook hands with Satan
My fans are amazing, I thank and praise 'em
When I die, don't cry, just congratulations
A million more feet will stamp the pavement with plans of changes, no exaggeration
We will not be ignored
You will be rocked with the force of the bombs you dropped in those wars
I will not be bought
And I consciencely thought it was wrong, so I constantly fought
Peace is something I would really adore
But we are at war so give me a sword
I'm merely a corpse, but still be assured
When you kill me there will be a million more
[Pre-Hook-Lowkey]
Born alone and die alone
Those words ringin' inside my dome
Best friends are the pen and the microphone
Roamin' until I find my way home
Turn my body cold but my soul is mine
Take a deep breath and I close my eyes
I will go when I'm supposed to die
But in death I will multiply

[Hook-Mai Khalil]
My backs against the wall
But you can't kill us all
Even if you take my life
Still we will survive
We shall overcome
And the tables will turn
Today I die as one but as millions I'll return
But as millions I'll return
But as millions I'll return

[Verse 2]
In these critical times don't be really surprised
If I get victimised by Gideon's spies
I sympathise with that Brazilian guy
On the tube, but we're used to the hideous lie
Your civilians die, millions cry
Our civilians die"", they're militants right?
How silly am I to be figuring why?
The injustice is clear and I feel it inside
Hear me in Gaza, here me in Glasgow
Hear me in Baghdad, hear me in Plasto
Clearly they hear me from here to Chicago
Think things are all good but they aren't though
Peace is something I would really adore
But we are at war so give me a sword
I'm merely a corpse, but still be assured
When you kill me there will be a million more
[Pre-Hook-Lowkey]

[Hook-Mai Khalil]

[Verse 3]
My people are bleedin'
So I'm readin' and seekin' the deepest of meanin's
My demons are breedin'
In my sleep I can feel it, I need to defeat 'em
My temperature's risin'
If tempted I'll rise with the temper of Tyson
Resent all the violence
Cause of people with tension
It tends to divide them
The pen that I write with
Is better than a sword when I strike with the strength of a Titan
My friends are still fighting against all the tyrants
So then why would it end when I die then?
Peace is something I would really adore
But we are at war my pen's killing your sword
I'm merely a corpse, but still be assured
When you kill me there will be a million more

[Pre-Hook-Lowkey]

[Hook-Mai Khalil]
[Outro]
You might take my life
But you can't take my soul
You can't take my soul
You might take my freedom
But you can't take my soul
You can't take my soul

You might take my life
But you can't take my soul
You can't take my soul
You might take my freedom
But you can't take my soul

Wrap it around my knuckles make a fist and lock it
Deposit - a blow to the jaw as I bank him
Break a 40 on top of the counter then I shank him
It's the Piru, the Piru
The G's with the rhymes, 4 clips shot Crabs 8 times with the 9
I got love from the West Side
Straight to the East Side
Rickets and Bloods
Both bump the B side up
This funk in your trunk is the bomb
Set trip, I put the pen and light it up like Vietnam

Bailin' up out the East Side, ready to go, hittin' the door

Thangs, but now us Slobs ain't givin' a fuck
About a copper tryin' to stop us, sayin' fuck them hoes, we stackin' 'em up
And to the top is where we headed, yeah, we major player
Niggas up in my city cluckin' the most grip, we all into birds
And it's worth to the niggas in my - hood

Go for the kill so you can chill 'fore your fuckin' time's gone, niggas

[GREEN EYES]
Now I'm bailin' down the Four, nigga, bhakis creased
Then I laugh when I hear a Crab - hollerin' about peace
Nigga must be brazy, that shit ain't in my vocab
I put a cap in his ass and leave his ass in a rehab
Then head to the hospital, my job ain't done
I wanna bee his ass bitch feet deep, and then some
Leavin' motherfuckers in a big hole
Went to scoop up Young Leak, Hops and my nigga Dogg
Pops lit up one of those fat-ass blunts
Now I'm high as fuck, nigga, on the Crab hunt
The first Crab I bee, my mind goes hostile
I load the gun and put one in his nostrils
For disrespecting
I'm knowin' for checkin' a Ricket
Tryin' to come to - low key and bickin'
With this motherfuckin' dog hollerin' ""What's up Blood!?""
1-0-4 like I said, always draped in red
And if I hear you say ""Crab"" then nigga it's on
And your ass'll die - before your time is gone

I feel like busting a cap in the face of a Slob fool
I've been a Crip from the gitty-up, been cool
Another Kelly at the scene of a crime spree
I get paid, I don't murder motherfuckers for free
It's like you gotta see dead to play your card
Smoke any Young Snoop and National Guard
They got M-16's, no A.K.'s
With 47 ways, I can stand up and gat for days
Grab the strap, grab the beanie
Wardrobe dark so the Slobs don't see me
We calling a truce, but if the Snoops wanna trip
I break up the meeting and tell them, ""Nigga, this still Crip!""
Kelly Park just giving the punch, nigga
Atlantic Drive's up the way, so the Mafia's bigger
Neighborhood has got the gats, you don't hear me though
South side break it down to the syllabul
Spooks Town's in the next room
Acacia Block steady giving niggas the blues
My niggas up to no good
Farm Dogs, Park Village, Nutty Block, and Pocket Hood
Tragniew, Mona, and Carver Park
Steady putting in work on the Lueders mark
Palmer Block, Santana, and Original Front
Gotta kill a Slob every single day of the month
SIix hoods and ducky hoods got to have fun
While the SWAMP put in work on 1-5-1
Tic-toc, another Slob drop
Anzac gangsta Crip and Lantana Block
Set tripping, going from the toe, that's a no-no
You wanna scrap, but I'm reaching for my 44

Reaching for the 44

Punch the Slobs in they motherfucking grill
Hit the Crip-ass niggas in Compton and it's motherfucking real
So listen to the vocal track
And you motherfucking Slobs better step your ass back
'Cause a nigga's getting funky on the real level
Niggas dying, niggas working for the devil
I'ma tell you like this, G
If I have to kill me a nigga, that's just what it's gotta cee
'Cause I'ma scrap off the top
Put a nigga on chill and knock his ass out like a rock
And drop him right like a bad habit
And now you know that I'ma reach for my motherfucking automatic
Yo, dog, want to grab it
And let them niggas know that they can't have it?
I'm busting the shells on a Snoop bitch
And fuck a Snoop nigga 'cause he's a motherfucking trick
So duck your ass, motherfucker
'Cause if you don't, then your monkey ass straight gotta suffer
Suffer some shit from a pro
Just another Crip block and go

I got love for them Crip niggas every day
Hate a Slob like a Muslim on the KKK
Hit up the city [?] I better
LBC, plug a slug in the middle letter
What's up with that Snoop-ass jungle bitch?
Slob that, Slob this, now that's some sick shit
And if you're Slobbing, fuck being a brother
Suck shit, do a stroll and just die, motherfuckers
I think a bootie try to smoke the G the other way
Called up the homies from the hood and then I start to say
""Same old Slob-ass bitches try to straight spray
So load up until you caught and the A.K.""
When the Glock in the dark, homies hitting me up
Now, it's on for them motherfucking chicken bucks
Hit the corner where I was and seen a red shirt
Mad like a motherfucker, so I had to blast first
They saw us running 'cause they feel what we got for them
But we connecting, so they falling like a rainstorm
Time to go, since we sensed Mr. 5-0
Crips on that trip with another fucking Slob out
[Chorus: Ebony]

Looks like another Slob B.K.O
Well, I'm reaching for the 44

[Member of BLOODSTONE VILLAINS]
Straight from the heart, Blood I tell you this
Shootin' that crickets uh, I don't miss
Aimin' at the 5.0 for a target
I thought he was a Ricket
But damn I hit a soldier
Shot him in the head
I caught layin' him dead
Puttin' in work, who give a fuck about the Feds
Claimin' the East Side
The Rollin Fifty's
Who give a fuck about Rickets
They all Sissies
Runnin' In Packs
They better watch they back
Cause the Bloodstone Villains caught you Crabs off the Mac
Puttin' a mean check
Leavin' a man all wrecked
You know gangstas in the hood
They get respect
Here we go again on the smoke roll
Five-Deuce, Five-Six Villains goin' on the Crab patrol
Takin' out Crabs on sight, young Rickets
OG's, it don't matter what you look like
And if you dressed in blue
It's only clue for me to do what I'm gonna do
I'm a gangsta, straight up tear this
Takin' out Crabs to give a way I don't care about this
I do it for fun, keepin' Crabs on the run
I gotta gun
Go get a bulletproof vest son
And protect yourself, for your good health
I put your bitch very up on the shells
Because I'm gonna move you from the ground
Have you stretched out in the box slapped to the ground
And when I'm hangin' don't test me
Chillin' like a Villain so Blood don't stress me, stress me
[Chorus]
5 thousand 6 hundred 5
Bloodstone Villains killing Crabs on the spot
5 thousand Deuce hundred 5
Bloodstone Villains killing Crab with the crime

[GANGSTA RED]
Five-Six, Five-Deuce
And ?? on the Seven
It's Gangsta Red straight flowin' from the head
Checkin' you suckers
Because you're nuthin' but bustas
Cowards In The Pack if you know it's always like that
So fuck you Crabs with your weak-ass raps
It's Gangsta Red on the motherfuckin' mic
And you know we just don't stop
So watch me as I turn this motherfucker out
Two deads ??? equal five
Motherfuckin' Crabs that ain't alive
I did it with the quickness, not care about the witness
Now tell me can you hang with the sickness?
And yeah, it's only right
I jack the Crabs for his ?? just the other night
They all on my shit
Front, back
Hittin' the pancake switch
Rollin' down the Ave and what do I be?
Some motherfuckin' Crabs fall around behind me
So I hit the corner
Reach for my strap goddamn rippin' peel some more Crabs cap
Villain's the game, kill is the thing
Understand what I'm sayin' man
It's just a motherfuckin' Villain time
So Blood don't stress me"

Too many deaths in the family, everybody around me

Another year, another one passed
Man I'd rather see you locked up then dead in that bodycast
But now he gone to a better place
But then we won't never be the same if you ain't standin' face to face
Everybody sheds a tear when they go down
But loc as you reminiscin' you know they still around
So drop your head to the church song
And for the ones that can you take it for them, you gotta stay strong
Some call it a miracle, some call it a blessing
Call it what you want but the homie still left me
And now he gone to them stars above
Them Golden Gates can't wait to let him in and show him love
I reminisce so I shed a tear
Shouts outs to Tiny Half Dead wishing you was here

And right now to this day it still hurts
So when I reminisce on Tiny Half
I put in work
And leave another memory of a dead trick
And I'll be scopin' like a sharpshooter with the 30-06

You wish you could fuck
Bitch, all you can do is dick suck

Fuck that, you don't cook, you don't clean, or press my jeans
You don't scrub or wash clothes
Or buy food or make cream in this bitch
You don't read to the seeds
All you do is watch TV and smoke weed
Get your nails done and feet, scrub the hair-weave
Sleep all day, eat, gain weight, can't breathe
Talking about you're going to leave?
Then bitch leave! What the fuck you're waiting for?
Hit the door, I ain't taking this shit no more!
Spending all my cream on Gucci, Phillies and Coach
Before you moved to my lab, bitch, I ain't never seen a roach
Stains on my carpet, bathroom's more like a fish market
Take all the space in my closet, where the fuck's your logic?
Disrespecting my old earth, aborted my child birth
And every day I catch my credit card inside your purse
You can't speak a sentence without a curse
Talking 'bout you're going to be a nurse
Bitch, to be a nurse you got to go to school first!
When I first met you, you was a ho
I tried to reform you, bomb you, warn you and teach you
But couldn't reach you, and you're still a ho
Your father said you was a ho
And when you leave me, bitch, you're gonna be a ho
Cellulite and gargoyle feet, I'd rather beat my meat
That raggy ass pussy a starving dog wouldn't eat
Started with the body of a model
Pussy tight as a pharmaceutical bottle
And you could swallow a whole avocado
And two forty ounce bottles
To the end of the world, which to I would follow
Now, when I fuck you, the shit echos cause you pussy is so hollow
Turn your fat ass sideways
Your stretch marks look like the US highways
Fuck a new nigga every Friday
Talking 'bout bust a nut, bitch I'll bust yo guts!
(You come so quick, nigga)
Wonder why I come so quick?
With that wide ass pussy and soggy tits?
I'm trying to get the shit over with, and go to sleep!
But when I'm with my real freak on the weekend
Bet that baby we fuck for two and a half hours to three
You'd better study the 1-14 knowledge culture degree
About M-G-T, and G-C-C

Life's ill, sometimes life might kill
Vordul Mega, five digits grab mics, mic strike type ill
Is life real? Yo akh' he builds
When life feels like Earth don't spin, whirlwinds might blend
Life's at a standstill, dangerous cause man kills
And still cats visualize life ghetto like
One mind, sometime these cats see life
Street life in complete light and be like
I'm a live life after this one crime
One line from the Megalah blow spines
Everyone knows the city's ill, cats kill
Still black man holds nine, Gotta chill star C-A.L.L.A.H
Be the light of Shamar, work hard Shamar C-Cipher-A.L.L.A.H
Adapt bars snatch stars and detach large channels

One floor shot silly, spun city one verse hit milly
Little girls spinning curls three sixty, living in a world shitty
Yo they spun young earth, now shitty
NY 5-0 might shoot black head
Nigga sorry I sold space suit to crack head
DTs operate mechanically, po-po in slow-mo
Black kids locked away, add a key
Plus one fourth pound of smoke flow
While lock head Fabian, Ahmed Arabian, laying in
Bodeg holding drama AK, spoke like as-salām-ah OK
Choking vodka mixed with OJ
Wig splits mad quick
Spinning three six O wave, C4 blew the door
Number eight, Summer face tank top with a knot
Number nine said run the place
Took my girl stereo, CD, plus the tape
Brooke star, don't wet that, fucked her face lets stuff the place
Jet back to Santa Cruz, Californ-i-a
Peace to C-God locked up, cat born nine ways
Come home mad soon, live ill, life phases
Like little black girl got shot
Damn it hurts when they spun earth filled with knots
Gonna make a difference so we get locked
Caught in the shit and losing what we got
Come on black equals, equals

And if there's crack in a basement

[Verse 3: Vast Aire]
Crack heads stand adjacent
Anger displacement from food stamp arrangements
You were a still born baby, mother didn't want you
But you were still born
Boy meets world, of course his pops is gone, what you figure
That chalky outline on the ground is a father figure?
So he steps to the next stencil, that's a hustler
Infested with money and diamond cluster
Let's talk in layman terms
Rotten apples and big worms, early birds and poachers
New York is evil at its core, so those who have more than them
Prepare to be victims
Ate up by vultures, the politicians
In a dog eat dog culture, that'll sick 'em
Lack of mineral, we take it personal
A pigeon can't drop shit if it never flew
Every day is no frills, empty krills
Broken 40 bottles and MCs with skills
I rest my head on 115
But miracles only happen on 34th, so I guess life is mean
And death is the median
And purgatory is the mode that we settle in (no doubt)
I've got that Eve's Bayou sense of touch
So I fought, to touch every hand of a fan to read their thoughts
Battered wives, molested children
Roaches on the floor, rats in the ceiling
Cats walk around New York with two fillings
One is in their mouth, the other does the killing
I'm Vast Aire, Kramer, top billing

On the day I was born, Taoist monks banged a big gold gong
With the same insignia that I have tattooed on my arm
In the mist of a rainstorm eclipsed over Asia
The day's finally arrived, the one they prayed for
Gasping in awe they couldn't believe that they saw
The illegitimate son of Father Time and Mother Nature
I've been here before from Earth's core to seashore
One law, be warm, bringin 'em love through war
(JESUS!) Nah, but I appreciate the comparison
I've avoided bein wack, I've avoided three marriages
The Poison Pen pen penances, burn down villages
What I write with ain't ink my ballpoint hemorrhages religiousness
The record business is all luck
I go to a whorehouse for a good deal and get a record deal to get fucked
Now leaving childhood they stole my innocence
""Chi"" contained in the word ""Christ"" - not a coincidence
