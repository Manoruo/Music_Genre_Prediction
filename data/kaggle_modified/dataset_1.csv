No Matter What,T.I.,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Never have you seen in your lifetime
A more divine southern rapper with a swag like mine
Facin' all kinda time, but smile like I'm fine
Brag with such passion and shine without tryin'
Believe me, pain's a small thang to a giant
I was born without a dime, out the gutter, I climbed
Spoke my mind and didn't stutter one time
Ali say, ""Even the greatest gotta suffer sometime""
So I huff and puff, rhymes, lyrics so sick wit it
Set the standard in Atlanta, how to get-get-get it
So you up-and-coming rappers wanna diss, just kill it
I'm officially the realest, point blank, period
Whether I still live in the hood or just visit
Whatever you can do in the hood, I done did it
That's why the dope boys and the misfits feel it
This still his city long as TIP livin', nigga

[Hook]
I ain't dead (nah!), I ain't done (nah!)
I ain't scared (of what?), I ain't run (from who?)
But still I stand (yeah) No matter what, people
Here I am, yeah, no matter what, remember
I ain't break (never), I ain't fold (never)
They hate me more (so?) Yeah I know (haha!)
Here I go, yeah, no matter what shawty, here I go
No matter what, shawty
[Verse 2]
You let the blog sites and the magazines tell it
I'm sure to be in jail until 2027
Rather see me in the cell instead of this new McLaren
God will take you through Hell just to get you to Heaven
So even though it's heavy, the load I will carry
Grin and still bear it, win and still share it
Apologies to the fans, I hope you can understand it
Life can change your directions, even when you ain't planned it
All you can do is handle, worst thing you can do is panic
Use it to your advantage, avoid insanity, manage to conquer
Every obstacle, make impossible possible
Even when winning illogical, losing's still far from optional, and
Yeah, they wanna see you shot up in the hospital
But when life throw punches, block and counter like a boxer do
Been locked inside mi casa too long, I did a song
To make it known that the King lives on, pimpin'

[Hook]
I ain't dead (nah!), I ain't done (nah!)
I ain't scared (of what?), I ain't run (from who?)
But still I stand (yeah) No matter what, people
Here I am, yeah, no matter what, remember
I ain't break (never), I ain't fold (never)
They hate me more (so?) Yeah I know (haha!)
Here I go, yeah, no matter what shawty, here I go
No matter what, shawty
[Verse 3]
Even in solitude, there's still no hotter dude
I show you how to do what you do, you ain't gotta clue
All you do is follow dude, sound like a lotta dudes
I'll weather whatever storm, make it out without a bruise
I understand why, now, with my hands tied
They take shots, cause if I'm out there it's a landslide
But revenge is best served as a cold dish
And suckas will get served, nigga, no shit
Guess it was understood, for me, it was over-with
But I don't quit, if you ain't noticed yet
They couldn't wait to say, ""Goodnight, shawty""
So they could try to rhyme, act and look like shawty
Go get a beat from Toomp and make a hook like shawty
Before ya know it I'm back, what it look like, shawty?
I lost my partner and my daughter in the same year
Somehow I rise above my problems and remain here
Yeah, and I hope the picture painted clear
If your heart filled with faith, then you can't fear
Wonder how I face years and I'm still chillin'?
Easy, let go and let God deal with it

[Hook]
I ain't dead (nah!), I ain't done (nah!)
I ain't scared (of what?), I ain't run (from who?)
But still I stand (yeah) No matter what, people
Here I am, yeah, no matter what, remember
I ain't break (never), I ain't fold (never)
They hate me more (so?) Yeah I know (haha!)
Here I go, yeah, no matter what shawty, here I go
No matter what, shawty"

Love, the dangerous necessity that people seek
Without regard to where they are

Love, the lights are low, your eyes are bright
The music plays, it's sweet delight
It's out of sight, I'm feeling right
Your dress is tight
Oh, how, I want you right now

Strong Will Continue,Nas & Damian Marley,"['hip hop', 'blues', 'jazz', 'r&b', 'pop']","[Intro: Nas]
All I do is stay focused
Looking straight forward at the world and beyond
I feel people pulling me down
I feel some pulling me up
I can't get stuck
I just keep moving forward
I got places to go man
Let's go

[Chorus: Damian Marley]
When the armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak hearted weep and moan
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak hearted wither and  moan
Only the strong will continue
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you
[Verse 1: Damian Marley]
Hey, the victory's found in truth
Like innocence found in youth
Self defeat is your own dispute
And man, you put yourself in your own shoes
Either you're winning or losing
Don't you get it confused
Play a star and you know your own movie
Playing of the role you choose, so
Stand up and fight if you know that you're right
And know you will never fail
Tipping the scale and the wind shall prevail
And the boat shall forever sail
Hey, there ain't no stopping or cruising
Even when you're battered and bruised
Outrun all the sprinters on Mount Olympus
My God's tougher than Zeus

[Chorus: Damian Marley (Nas)]
When the Armageddon's dark and dread
(I get up and make it happen)
A lot of weak hearted wither and moan
(I get up and we get it cracking)
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
(I get up and I get it going)
A lot of weak hearted wither and moan
(We get up and we keep it flowing)
Only the strong will continue (yeah)
I know you have it in you (yeah, yeah)
I know you have it in you
[Verse 2: Nas]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
New York to Cali, for the money, power, respect
It's a journey, some'll get left behind
Cause in life, you cannot press rewind
Get it right, you only have one first chance
To make one first impression that lasts a lifetime
Reputation supersedes itself
Do you believe in Hell? Babylon greed for wealth
Do you deceive yourself and let your ego swell?
And disregard those who most need your help
Thick skin, the dark won't take my soul
Survive spiritual wars, see my welts
And the evil's felt, but the faith is stronger
I saw grown men fall when I was a youngster
But I clench my fists, ready to go against whoever
Tie my Timbs and rise in the end

[Chorus: Damian Marley (Nas)]
When the armageddon's dark and dread
(I get up and make it happen)
A lot of weak hearted weep and moan
(I get up and we get it cracking)
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and tread
(I get up and I get it going)
A lot of weak hearted wither and moan
(We get up and we keep it flowing)
Only the strong will continue (yeah)
I know you have it in you (yeah, yeah)
I know you have it in you
[Verse 3: Damian Marley]
No man live forever, but never say never
Every good he want better, must be a go getter
And always be clever in every endeavor
Cause drastic time call for drastic measure
Yuh birthright to pleasure From yuh navel string sever
The land and the treasure, work for whatever
Jah said don't be a beggar, the Alpha Omega
Will bless every soul no matter which name you prefer
The immortal stepper, believe in every skin no matter which color they are
We never let we don't know here which kind of weather
You're destined to rise like the Son of Rebecca
Don't stop for a second
Everyone reckon, it sure would be good to be there
Whether Zion or Mecca
When the gates are finally closed
And the saints go marching in

[Chorus: Damian Marley & (Nas)]
When the armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak hearted weep and moan
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak hearted wither and  moan
Only the strong will continue
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you


[Verse 4: Nas]
I'm a street lifer
Always harrassed by the cee cyphers
Chief like Geronimo with his peace pipe
I emerged from the street life
This for the homies who relate
Know what it be like
My QB life takin' a turn to the Louis XIII life
Twisted and mangled sort of like Bruce Lee life
Cursed with his son Brandon
If that's you and me, Knight, I pray our fates greater
I speak life I still matter as a rapper, not doubtin'
Even Toni Braxton signed a deal with Craig Kallman
How in, the hell am I supposed stay comfy
When I pay child support, alimony monthly?
Got Maseratis and Ferraris
Only like a woman who's a rider, But only ho's want me
Single life crazy, niggas wives on me
I say stay faithful, they say their man corny
So I'm, stuck with a married woman
So fine, cheatin while they husband
Rushing on the 40-yard line, wonder if
This is what my ex did the whole time
Good niggas seem to always end up
With some hard times, hope not
If a pimp slippin and a ho plot
Ain't nothin to a G in a two-tone drop, kid
And it don't stop, See a nigga dissapearin
With the baddest honeys in the whole spot, yeah"
Say Something,Timbaland,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: Drake]
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
Yeah, it really sucks, but ever since I’ve been long gone
I traded in my señorita for a microphone
I hate the way you fell apart, girl, it's sad to see
Your life is good, but me and you we a catastrophe
If I was unsuccessful, would you be satisfied?
I need a paramedic girl, I’m feeling paralyzed
If I could choose, you will always be a friend to me
The more money I made you acting like my enemy – it's crazy
I can’t help it if you feel ashamed
Thought the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
How can something so familiar be so strange
Closest friends get estranged when the status change, ah
Is it my mistake, thinking that where I am and where you at?
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that had my back
You were the perfect pair and now it seems that we don’t match
Is it the money, want me to give it back?
[Chorus: Drake]
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh! I am the topic of conversation, this is celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I've moved out my mama's basement
To a condo downtown, 'cause it's all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication, to life
You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We could have split this whole thing up 50/50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever-so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
'Cause what's a star when it's most important fan is missing?
[Chorus: Drake]
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change

And I’m easily influenced by the niggas I'm around
See that Aston Martin, when I start it hear the sound
I ain't never graduated, I ain't got no cap and gown
But the girls in my class who were smart enough to pass
Be at all my fucking parties, grabbing money off the ground

Spades or the Opus, baby, what you got a feeling for?

Cartier Louis case with a dope plod
From the mud where they what you leave in your blood
Going in, flipping hundreds get the young plug
Show ‘em where it go
Floating on the floor, getting more dough
Grind hard, go, black diamond show, watch the flame blow
And how you stay grounded? Cash no go
And how you stay mounded? Cash no flow
And how you stay shining? Bentley off the floor
And how you stay high? Purple pine dro
Diamond minks, fur, February snow

Sticking to the script: movie star money
And if you gassed up, I leave the car running
I’m a big smoker, I’m a little drinker
My peace sign is just the trigger and the middle finger
Wha-what you know about it, man ya’ll clueless
I let two women ride me, that's car-poolers
I rock stupid ice, Mr. Water Coolers

Crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
From the gang called Niggas Wit Attitudes
When I'm called off, I got a sawed-off
Squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off
You too, boy, if you fuck with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off your ass, that's how I'm going out
For the punk motherfuckers that's showing out
Niggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix 'em and cook 'em in a pot, like gumbo
Going off on the motherfucker like that
With a gat that's pointed at your ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no telling when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep y'all dancin'
With a crime record like Charles Manson
AK-47 is the tool
Don't make me act a motherfucking fool
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knocking niggas out the box, daily
Yo, weekly, monthly and yearly
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T
Boy, you can't fuck with me
So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck
‘Cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck
As I leave, believe I'm stompin'
But when I come back boy, I'm coming straight outta Compton

Yo, Ren! (What's up?)
Tell 'em where you from!

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Straight outta Compton, another crazy-ass nigga
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm a bad motherfucker, and you know this
But the pussy-ass niggas won't show this
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jacking or craps
Just like burglary, the definition is jacking
And when I'm legally armed it's called packing
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece of pussy and go up in it
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'ma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
But that shows me, slut, you're not opposed to
A crazy motherfucker from the street
Attitude legit, ‘cause I'm tearing up shit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb motherfucker that starts static
Not the right hand, 'cause I'm the hand itself
Every time I pull an AK off the shelf
The security is maximum and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren, but I'm raw
See, 'cause I'm the motherfucking villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'
That's taking place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, your ass is through
Look, you might take it as a trip
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton

Eazy is his name, and the boy is coming

[Verse 3: Eazy E]
Straight outta Compton
Is a brother that'll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous motherfucker raising hell
And if I ever get caught, I make bail
See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem
I see a motherfucking cop, I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass, I smile
To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showing a nigga driving
But don't know where the fuck he's going, just rolling
Looking for the one they call Eazy
But here's a flash, they'll never seize me
Ruthless, never seen, like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload
You see a spark and jump over hesitation
And hear the scream of the one who got the last penetration
Feel a little gust of wind and I'm jetting
But leave a memory no one'll be forgetting
So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!
You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker
This is an autobiography of the E
And if you ever fuck with me
You'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother
Word to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton

Scarface Gucci: my life’s a motion picture
Gucci Tarantino, Casino, Gucci Pacino
I’m Gucci Mane Soprano, more keys than a grand pianoWatching Blow, thinking George'll look out for Diego
I’m smoking on that color purple, working like I’m Harpo
Feeling just like Smokey felt when Craig beat shit out Debo
Call me Gucci Watch Me, freeze me, save me, watch me: TiVo
Your album came out, I rated it ""worst"". Response: I hated it
Boyz In The Hood, got juice and rock jewelry
Cars ""Fast And Furious"", shout out to my boy Ludacris

Gucci Mane not Stephen King but my car crazy like Christine

Don’t you think I’m handsome? There’s no need to answer
My watch is so handsome; better yet attractive
Hoes think it’s cute but my money got my pants sagging

Tell your boy the truth: that his daddy is a faggot
Only reason that you had him was for your fucking taxes"
Superstar Remix,Lupe Fiasco,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1 - Young Jeezy]
Ah, ah, oh my God
All this for me, I must be on my job
First album was a classic, never got an award
Took my first 10 grand and bought a Honda Accord
And then I pack them thangs inside the Honda Accord
And put them on a highway and watch the Honda Accord
""Excuse me engineer, hope you pressing record""
And on behalf of the streets, I just can't be ignored
I stay in all black just like a new Glock
All the broads screaming like they just seen 2Pac
Say his earrings 'bout as big as his ego
Keep a fresh bald head like he just left chemo
This ain't even mine, this is Lupe's single
And every time I watch The Wire, it's like I just left B-More
Call me Marlo, come be my Snoopy
Superstar, baby, why wouldn't you do me

[Hook 1 - Mathew Santos]
If you are what you say you are
A superstar
Then have no fear
The camera's here
And the microphones
And they wanna know
[Verse 2 - Lupe Fiasco]
You on your 15th minute of fame and on the 16th
Beginith the lame, and on 17 you lose everything
The 21st is the worst, wishing you was 11
Popping like you was 7 with the feeling when you was seconds
Reminiscing when you was just in
Now you just him, no longer the trend they dressin'
Now you wondering where all the press went
You no longer impress them
Get arrested, paparazzi will press then
I fell on purpose to stay a freshman
I lose, but Lu attend the school for X-Men
So when I get my cap and gown and put the rapping down
I'll only know half my powers, but I spent half an hour
Like a senior citizen, having a baby shower
Haters wanna budget, but my fans still love it
So you can ask them exactly who I are
Nine weeks at number one, I'm a superstar

[Hook 2 - Matthew Santos]
If you are what you say you are
A superstar
Then have no fear
The crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show
[Verse 3 - T.I.]
OK now, Anyone who know me, they know me to ride
But when the shit was selling slow, it's just my homies and I
Had to get rid of all the phonies and the homies's disguise
So you speaking and I don't reply, homie, don't be surprised
You ain't gotta ride for me, I ain't asked you to
Take a journey on my own, I would gladly do
You go and turn around, now, I call the cab for you
I stand up on my own two, he kissed a ass of who
No way, Jose, we pop Rose, blow dro, that's more than okay
See but don't say, my folks they flip, more yay than Cirque Du Soleil
Keyser Söze, oh they, kill people and get off like O.J
You catch your case, just shut your face, don't get caught singing do-re
Mi-fa-so-la-ti-do, ghetto hero, G Code. I obey
He's so gay. Didn't have no business hanging 'round me, no way
It's okay, life lesson learned, I suggest that you go your way
I be straight, no conversation, man, this all I'm gon say

[Hook 3 - Matthew Santos]
If you are what you say you are
A ghetto superstar
Then have no fear
Cause the gangsters here
And I'm gonna blow the dro
You already know
[Verse 4: Young Jeezy]
Wishing it would stop raining, just finished slanging
Rap ain't selling but I'm still maintaining
Tryna to keep changing, same old shows
Rich get richer and the broke get poor
Q did for came back game swoll
Now Jimmy locked up with 9 months to go
A nigga named slow used to get money fast
Lil' David has a Cadillac I wish I had
Young B got killed, now we miss Big Wrath
When homicide came, guess who they grabbed
I remember Rico everywhere we go
He would pay the DJ just to let me flow
Everything we know, we get it from these streets
Can't wait 'til the day Lil Bud released
Now my sister in jail and my brother is too
In case you wanna know what my mother going through

[Hook - Matthew Santos]
If you are what you say you are
A ghetto superstar
Then have no fear
Cause the gangsters here
And I'm gonna blow the dro
You already know

[Verse 5: Young Jeezy]
I met this lady she said she my auntie
Never got to meet her cause my daddy didn't want me
The light bill due and the water bill late
Time got her, got a little girl yesterday
Just made [?] and he right back in there
Get him out. What he did? I don't even care
Yeah, he got popped when his kids was around
Took his to Chuck-E-Cheese and got gunned down
Now he on the run, hope he never get caught
Charges he facing was not his fault
The police shot the wife, he got a lawsuit
Hit him in his arm for nothing, what would y'all do?
My niece Tina ran away from the group home
I'm tryna get custody, it's taking 'em too long
So if you didn't see me in the video with 50
Just know I'm in the ghetto, somewhere in my city

[Hook - Matthew Santos]
If you are what you say you are
A ghetto superstar
Then have no fear
Cause the gangsters here
And I'm gonna blow the dro
You already know"

The money (Money), cars (Cars)
The clothes (Clothes), the hoes
I suppose
Yeah

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I want the money (Money), money and the cars
Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Verse 1: Drake]
Drizzy
Aw yeah, Trey, I fuckin' feel ya
They be starin' at the money like it's unfamiliar
I get it, I live it, to me there's nothin' realer
Just enough to solve your problems, too much'll kill ya
And when I leave, I always come right back here
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear
A lot of y'all are still soundin' like last year
The game need change and I'm the motherfuckin' cashier
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious, you'll hate me
'Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture, no HD
Yeah, I want it all, that's why I strive for it
Diss me, you'll never hear a reply for it
Any award show or party, I get fly for it
I know that it's comin', I just hope that I'm alive for it
[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I want the money (Money), money and the cars
Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I want things to go my way
But as of late, a lot of shit been goin' sideways
And my mother tried to run away from home
But I left something in the car and so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me, so I cried too
And my stomach was soakin' wet, she only 5'2""
And 40, that was all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up
Damn, my reality just set in
And even when the Phantom's leased, them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things hopin' I never have to fit in
So tryna keep up with my progress, it's like a dead-end
My girl love me, but fuck it, my heart beats slow
And right now the tour bus is lookin' like a freak show
And life change for us every single week, so
It's good, but I know this ain't the peak though 'cause I want the:
[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I want the money (Money), money and the cars
Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Interlude]
Alright well, um, alright. We... we'll fuckin' figure it out. You know what you—you know what you're doin' with it, you know, makin' it to the top. All the way to the top. Yeah, you do it for the money, and not the honey, you know what I'm sayin'? You know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 3: Drake]
Wise words from a decent man
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alisha hand
This lost boy got fly without Peter Pan
And my delivery just got me buzzin' like the pizza man
In-person I am everything and more
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before
But inside I'm treadin' water, steady tryna swim to shore
I'm on a shopping spree to get whatever is in store
Yeah, just call me ""Shoppin' Bag Drizzy""
Or call me Mr. ""Damn, he ain't coppin' that, is he?""
And fans of the freshman is about to get iffy
While this youngin that you doubted is about to get busy
I'ma kill it, I promise, that's how I know you're mad
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads
The big homie, use a flash if you must
And I swear I ain't askin' for much, all I want is the...
[Chorus: Trey Songz & Drake]
Yeah, I want the money (Money), money and the cars
Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be (Yeah), I just wanna be successful (That's all I want, man)
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful (You gotta tell 'em, Trey)
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Interlude: Drake]
Yeah, it's like I, it's like I know what I gotta say
I just don't know... how to say it... to you

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Uh, pardon the swag, but bitch, it's Car-tey
Long bread, I don't eat shortcake, how come I can't
Miss a woman like I can't miss court dates
Cheese, but she's not in this portrait
And yeah, life's fine, but I don't portray
I'm on the other side, but it is a short gate
I don't want the glow, I want the glo-ray
And I'ma fuck the world, but this is just foreplay
Tired of hearin' bullshit, bring on the cow shit
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than our shit
And that's word to Toronto
So high up, I got birds in the condo
Ha, ain't that a female dog?
Ask her who I am to her, and she yell, ""God""
Weezy Baby, I go re-al hard
No further details, boy"
My President,Jeezy,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Young Jeezy]
Yeah, be the realest shit I never wrote
I ain't write this, by the way, nigga
Some real shit right here, nigga
This'll be the realest shit you ever quote
Let's go

[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
My president is Black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My mama ain't at home and Daddy's still in jail
Tryna make a play, anybody seen the scale?
My president is Black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My money's light green and my Jordans light grey
And they love to see white, now how much you tryna pay? Let's go

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Today was a good day, hope I have me a great night
I don't know what you fishin' for, but catch you a great white
Me, I see great white, heavy as killer whales
I cannot believe this, who knew it came in bales?
Who knew what came with jail? Who knew what came with prison?
Just 'cause you got opinions, does that make you a politician?
Bush robbed all of us, would that make him a criminal?
And then he cheated in Florida, would that make him a Seminole?
I say, and I quote, ""We need a miracle""
And I say a miracle 'cause this shit is hysterical
By my nephews and nieces, I will email Jesus
Tell him forward to Moses and CC Allah
Mr. Soul Survivor, guess that make me a Konvict
Be all you can be, now don't that sound like some dumb shit
When you die over crude oil as black as my nigga Bu
It's really a Desert Storm, that's word to my nigga Clue
Catch me in Las Vegas, A.R., Arizona
Rep for them real niggas, I'm winnin' in California
Winnin' in Tennessee, hands down Atlanta
Landslide Alabama, on my way to Savannah
[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
My president is Black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My mama ain't at home and Daddy's still in jail
Tryna make a play, anybody seen the scale?
My president is Black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My money's light green and my Jordans light grey
And they love to see white, now how much you tryna pay? Let's go

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
I said I woke up this mornin', headache this big
Pay all these damn bills, feed all these damn kids
Buy all these school shoes, buy all these school clothes
For some strange reason my son addicted to Polos
Love me some spinach dip, I'm addicted to Houston's
And if them numbers is right I'll take a trip out to Houston
An earthquake out in China, a hurricane in New Orleans
Street Dreams Tour, I showed my ass in New Orleans
Did it for Soulja Slim, brought out B.G. 
It's all love, Bun, I'm forgivin' you, Pimp C
You know how the Pimp be, that nigga gon' speak his mind
If he could speak down from Heaven, he'd tell me stay on my grind
Tell him I'm doin' fine, Obama for mankind
We ready for damn change, so y'all let the man shine
Stuntin' on Martin Luther, feelin' just like a king
Guess this is what he meant when he said that he had a dream
[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
My president is Black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My mama ain't at home and Daddy's still in jail
Tryna make a play, anybody seen the scale?
My president is Black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My money's light green and my Jordans light grey
And they love to see white, now how much you tryna pay? Let's go (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Nas]
Our history, Black history
No president ever did shit for me
Had to hit the streets, had to flip some kis
So a nigga won't go broke
Then they put us in jail, now a nigga can't go vote
So I spend dough on these hoes strippin'
She ain't a politician, honey's a pole-itician
My president is Black, Rose golden charms
Twenty-two inch rims like Hulk Hogan's arms
When thousands of peoples is riled up to see you
That can arouse your ego, we've got mouths to feed, so
Gotta stay true to who you are and where you came from
'Cause at the top will be the same place you hang from
No matter how big you can ever be
For whatever fee or publicity, never lose your integrity
For years there's been some prize horses in this stable
Just two albums in, I'm the realest nigga on this label
Mr. Black President, yo, Obama for real
They gotta put your face on the 5,000 dollar bill
[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
My president is Black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My mama ain't at home and Daddy's still in jail
Tryna make a play, anybody seen the scale?
My president is Black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My money's light green and my Jordans light grey
And they love to see white, now how much you tryna pay? Let's go

Yo, gramps empty the drawer, (oh, please don't shoot)

Put your hands where I can see 'em, so they look like 12 PM
On the dot, see this Glock? Don't make me give these shells freedom
I got, nothin to lose, I've been cut and abused
My slut is confused, my bro can't even strut in his shoes
I'm on the edge, so I suggest you get cooperatin
If I find out you pushed the button and the cops is waitin
I'm a put stains from your brain on all of your remains
(Don't explain, take from in and out the lanes)
(Here's my chain and what I stock in the drawer)
Get to lockin the door and hear me cockin the four, cause you not gonna score
By goin apes and bananas, now, where's the tapes and the cameras
As soon as I escape then I vanish
A clean getaway, no witnesses
And sentences, you know what type of hit this is
Put your hands up

Hey hurry up, get to closin the store

Now where's your safe? (Umm, well ...), oh you gonna stop actin dumb pops
Oh, I think I will steal this soda and these gumdrops
See I ain't got all day, time is wastin
Crack the combination, I'm a need all accommodations
Better withdraw from the largest to the small
You tryin to stall? (I can't recall)
Shhh, I think I hear, AW FUCK! somebody saw us, try to pull this off, followed us
Now they jaw's on the ground, can't be around when the law gets
Close, do what you suppose and you can catch a dose
Anybody you consider as close, is adios
Where's your car at? (I parked it very far), that's not what I asked
You 'bout to make me shoot shots in the mask
(Alright, alright, it's in a lot that's just right outside of the back door)

Now any sudden moves, you will feel the effects of the buck
Where did you park inside the lot? (it's right next to the truck)
I got to think fast and decide, you slide into the passenger side
And you better have some gas in your ride
Hurry up, hand me the keys so I can start up this piece of shit
It ain't work and I ain't waitin for the police to get
Closer, so I can be inside a Wanted poster
No sir, we hoppin out, like everything is kosher
Hold up wait, I can't believe that it just started
You taste some me be weed, what are you retarded?
I ought to (why did you hit me?), cause you a dumb ass
And here they come fast, from a far, I'm seein some flash
It's time to bail, I'm not for doin jail time
Sittin in the cell cause of a failed crime
And why the fuck you up? I know we ain't just run out of gas
Now should I run out of gas, put my gun out and blast

[Break: Elzhi, (Cop)]
(Okay buddy, the gig is up, and now we got you surrounded)

Send niggas to the grave with they face half-gone
Stomach ripped open, the beef back on
That nigga Sheek rude, I'll spit in your food
Tell the women in your family to suck my dick
No respect, fuck that, I'll murder you quick
Mad weapons in the trunk, bitch, take your pick
Stick a grenade up under your fender
Stick a pineapple bomb in ya blender, I don't care about you
You say fuck Sheek Louch? Well, fuck you too (Uh-huh)

One Mic,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Chucky Thompson and Nas]

[Intro]
One time
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood
Mixed with 151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writin' names on my hollow tips, plottin' shit
Mad violence, who I'm gon' body? This hood politics
Acknowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us, roll up and try knockin' us
One knee, I ducked, could it be my time is up?
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop glass burst, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in
Blackin' out as I shoot back, fuck gettin' hit
This is my hood, I'ma rep to the death of it
'Til everybody come home, little niggas is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb
We need more warriors soon, sent from the stars, sun and the moon
In this life of police chases, street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience leavin' victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die with nines out
This is what Nas is 'bout, nigga, the time is now
[Chorus]
Yo, all I need is one mic
All I need is one mic (That's all I need)
All I need is one mic (All I need, niggas)
All I need is one mic (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
All I need is one blunt, one page and one pen
One prayer, tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter fact, maybe more than one
Look back at all the hatred against me, fuck all of them
Jesus died at age thirty-three, there's thirty-three shots
From twin Glocks, there's sixteen apiece, that's thirty-two
Which means one of my guns was holdin' seventeen
Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime, hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, niggas roll up shootin' from wheelchairs
My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air
I let this shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of MACs, two mini nines
If y'all niggas really with me, get busy, load up the semis
Do more than just hold it, explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin' in our way, they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
Lead flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
'Cause we stronger now, my nigga, the time is now
[Chorus]
All I need is one mic (That's all I need, niggas, that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (There's nothin' else in the world)
All I need is one mic (That's all a nigga need to do his thing, you know?)
All I need is one mic (This is all I need)

[Verse 3]
All I need is one life, one try, one breath, I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
Don't wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin' all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is, niggas'll move on you
Only if they know what your weakness is, I have none
Too late to grab guns, I'm blastin' 'cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggas
What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin'
Complete with thick scars
Brothers knifin' each other up in prison yards
Drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a cop'll get killed, body found in a dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range, niggas throwin' dirt on my name
Jealous 'cause fiends got they work and complained
Bitches left me 'cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true, she came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes
Movin' with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin' my melon 'cause none of these niggas real
Heard they were tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track, I'm finally found
You need some soul-searchin', the time is now
[Chorus]
All I need is one mic (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
All I need is one mic (All I ever needed in this world, fuck cash)
All I need is one mic (Fuck the cars, the jewelry)
All I need is one mic (To spread my voice to the whole world, baby)"

Riddle me this, my brother, can you handle it?
Your style to my style, you can't hold a candle to it
Equinox symmetry and the balance is right
Smokin' and drinkin' on a Tuesday night
It's not how you play the game, it's how you win it
I cheat and steal and sin, and I'm a cynic
For those about to rock, we salute you
The dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to
I once was lost, but now I'm found
The music washes over, and you're one with the sound
Well, who shall inherit the earth? The meek shall
And, yo, I think I'm starting to peak now, Al
And then the man upstairs, well, I hope that he cares
If I had a penny for my thoughts, I'd be a millionaire

And now we're gonna bust with the Putney Swope sequel
More Adidas sneakers than a plumber's got pliers
Got more suits than Jacoby & Meyers (Wow)
If not for my vices, and my bugged-out desires
My year would be good just like Goodyear's tires
'Cause I'm out picking pockets at the Atlantic Antic
And nobody wants to hear you because your rhymes are damn frantic
I mix business and pleasure way too much
You know, wine and women and song and such
I don't get blue, I got a mean red streak
You don't pay the band, your friends, yo, that's weak
Get even like Steven (Even) like pulling a Rambo

I've got the girlies in the Coupe like the Colonel's got the chickens

Rally round the stage and check the funky dope musicians

You love Mario Andretti cause he always drives his car well
Vicious circle of reality since the day you were born
And we love the hot butter (Say what?) The popcorn
Sippin' on wine and mackin'
Rockin' on the stage with all the hands clappin' (Yeah)
Ride the wave of fate, it don't ride me, Homes
(Being very proud to be an emcee)
And then the man upstairs, well, I hope that he cares
If I had a penny for my thoughts, I'd be a millionaire

Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely

How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we wasn't gon' speak so
Why we up 3 AM on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me fo'?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
‘Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me

You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got somethin' new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight into the night

I would share the definition of ballin’
With you white folks, but no
The game is to be sold and not told, so fuck you

[Hook: Sample]
I'm just living and a lovin'
Waiting for the moment
When you've got time to kill

[Verse 1]
I'm up before the sunrise, first to hit the block
Little bad muthafucka with a pocket full of rocks
Learn to throw them thangs, get my skinny little ass kicked
And niggas laugh 'til the first muthafucka got blasted
I put that nigga in his casket
Now they covering the bastard in plastic
I smoke blunts on the regular, fuck when it counts
I'm trying to make a million dollars out a quarter-ounce
And getting ghost on the 5-0—fuck them hoes
Got a .45, screaming out survival
Hey nigga, can I lay low? Cook some yayo
Holla ""one-time"" when I say so
Don't wanna go to the pen, I'm hitting fences
NARCs on a nigga's back, missing me by inches
And they say: ""How do you survive weighing 165
In a city where the skinny niggas die?""
Tell Mama ""don't cry"", 'cause even when they kill me
They can never take the game from a young G
I'm Str8 ballin'!

I'm still on parole, but I'm the first nigga serving
Pour some liquor on the curb for my niggas that deserve it
But if I want to make a million, gotta stay dealing
It's kinda booming 'round the way, and today I'll make a killing
Dressing down like I’m dirty, but only on the block
It's a clever disguise to keep me running from the cops
I'm getting high, I think I'll die if I don't get no ends
I'm in a bucket, but I’m riding it like it's a Benz
I hit the strip and let my music bump
Drinking liquor and I'm looking for some hoes to fuck
Rather die making money than live poor and legal
As I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo
I need money in a major way
Time to fuck my beyotch! Ha! And getting paid
You other muthafuckers crawlin'
But me and my muthafuckin' thug niggas—we str8 ballin'!!!

So watch a young motherfucker pull a trigger just to raise up!
But don't let them see you cry
Dry your eyes, young nigga, time to do or die
I keep a pistol in my pocket, ready
On my block, ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit
And I done seen a muthafucka’ peep pain
At point-blank range 'cause he slept on the game
And ain't a damned thing changed
You shaking the dice, now roll 'em
If you can't stand pain, better hold 'em
'Cause ain't no telling what you might roll
You might fold, catch AIDS from a slight cold, nigga

I finally made it, now these jealous bitches trying to fade me!
I ain't going out, I'd rather blast back
I'm on the corner with my niggas watching cash stack
And I came up a long way from food stamps
And taking shit from these low-life ghetto tramps
How could you blame me? If they sweat me I'mma open fire!
What could I do? Pull my trigger or watch my nigga die

I Got It Made,Special Ed,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
I'm your idol, the highest title, numero uno
I'm not a Puerto Rican, but I'm speaking so that you know
And understand I got the gift of speech
And it's a blessing
So listen to the lesson I preach
I talk sense condensed into the form of a poem
Full of knowledge from my toes to the top of my dome
I'm kinda young
But my tongue speaks maturity
I'm not a child, I don't need nothing for security
I get paid when my record is played
To put it short
I got it made...

[Verse 2]
I'm outspoken, my language is broken into a slang
But it's just a dialect that I select when I hang
I play it cool, 'cause cooling is all that I'm about
Just fooling with the girlies, yes I'm busting it out
I'm Special Ed and you can tell by the style that I use
I'm creatively superior, yo, I never lose
I never lost 'cause I'm the boss
I never will 'cause I'm still
The champion, chief one, won't lose until
I choose
Which I won't 'cause I don't retreat
I'll run you over like a truck and leave you dead in the street
You're inviting me, a titan to a battle
Why?
I don't need your respect 'cause
I got it made...

I'm talented, yes I'm gifted
Never boosted, never shoplifted
I got the cash, but money ain't nothin'
Make a million dollars every record that I cut and
My name is Special Ed and I'm a super-duper star
Every other month I get a brand new car
Got twenty, that's plenty yet I still want more
Kind of fond of Honda scooters, got 74
I got the riches
To fulfill my needs
Got land in the sand of the West Indies
Even got a little island of my very own
I got a frog, a dog with a solid gold bone
An accountant to account the amount I spent
Got a treaty with Tahiti 'cause I own a percent
Got gear I wear for everyday
Boutiques from France to the U.S.A
And I make all the money from the rhymes I invent
So it really doesn't matter
How much I spent, because yo
I make fresh rhymes daily
You burn me
Really?
Think, just blink and I've made a million rhymes
Just imagine if you blinked a million times
Damn I'd be paid
I got it made...
[Verse 4]
I'm kinda spoiled 'cause everything I want I got made
I wanted gear, got everything from cotton to suede
I wanted leg, I didn't beg I just got laid
My hair was growing too long, so I got me a fade
And when my dishes got dirty, I got Cascade
And when the weather was hot, I got a spot in the shade
I'm wise because I rise to the top of my grade
Wanted peace on Earth, so to God I prayed
Some kids across town thought I was afraid
They couldn't harm me
I got the army brigade
I'm not a trader, if what you got is greater I'll trade
But maybe later 'cause my waiter made potato and alligator soufflé
I got it made..."

P.I. till I die, and then I laugh at you cats
You happy perhaps ‘cause you got dough and bitches
But no love in the streets, only from 'mos and snitches
Only from the meat-lappin', suckers won't see it happen
Cross that line, then it's time for the heat-clappin'

But fuck it, I ain't trippin', I know Drizzy gon' kill 'em
I'm stickin' to the script like lint on denim
Momma said ""If the rules ain't bent, don't bend 'em""
Real nigga talkin' – shut the fuck up, ho!
Gotta do it one time for Haiti – what up, Zo?
Weezy F. Baby and the F is for Front Do'
'Cause that's where I brang it
Soo-woo if you bangin', motherfucker!
[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, girl, it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss me a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone

[Outro: Drake]
Uh, yeah, forever in our hearts
JJ, we love you boy—H-Town!
I’m gone, I’m gone, when I’m gone
I’m gone, I’m gone, when I’m gone
I just hope that you miss me, miss me
Miss me, miss me
Miss me a little when I’m gone
Miss me a little when I’m gone, gone, gone

99 Problems,JAY-Z,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Chorus]
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 1]
I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes
I'm from the hood, stupid! What type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
I'm like, ""Fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole!
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward.""
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads
Fuckers, I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas, I ain't dumb
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Verse 2]
The year is '94, in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin' law
Got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard, ""Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?""
‘Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low?
Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?
""Well, you was doing 55 in a 54
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are.""
I ain't steppin' out of shit, all my paper's legit
""Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?""
Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
""Aren't you sharp as a tack?
You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or something?""
Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
""Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come!""
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 3]
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy
But a pussy havin' no goddamn sense, try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin'
And he and his boys gonna be yappin' to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' em
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil' for bail ‘cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassin' them
Tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems, bein' a bitch ain't one – hit me!
[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

Nas is like; Nas is like; Nas is like)
Umm, Premo, Nas
Yeah, yeah, yo
(Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is;
Nas is like)

[Verse 1]
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's being born
Same time a man is murdered—the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
My plateau and also what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my sign's for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline, am I sane?
That depends, carry MAC-10s to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs living large, taking it light
Pushing big toys, getting nice, enjoying your life
It's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around their neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and Hell, rap legend, presence is felt
And of course, N-A-S are the letters that spell (Nas, Nas, Nas)
[Chorus]
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (Uh)
No doubt
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel (Uh, uh)
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (Uh)
No doubt (Uh)

[Verse 2]
(Nas is like) Earth, Wind & Fire, rims and tires
Bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver
Planets in orbit, line 'em up with the stars
Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas
(Nas is like) Iron Mike, messiah type
Before the Christ, after the death, the last one left
Let my cash invest in stock
Came a long way from blasting TECs on blocks
Went from Seiko to Rolex, owning acres
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
Dimes giving fellatio, siete zeros
Bet my 9 spit for the pesos
But what's it all worth? Can't take it with you under this earth
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
Before my number's called, history's made
Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die
Making choices that determine my future under the sky
To rob, steal or kill, I'm wondering why
It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite
Sooner or later, we'll all see who the prophet is
[Chorus]
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (C'mon)
No doubt
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing
No doubt (Uh)

[Verse 3]
(Nas is like) Sex to a nympho, but nothing sweet
I'm like beef, busting heat through your windows
I'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather
Like Greeks in Egypt, learning something deep from they teachers
I'm like crime, like your 9, your man you would die for
Always got you, I’m like Pac, dude you would cry for
I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money
Corporate accounts from a rich company
I'm like ecstasy for ladies
I'm like all races combined in one man, like the '99 Summer Jam
Bulletproof Hummer man
I'm like being locked down around new faces and none of 'em fam
I'm the feeling of a millionaire spending a hundred grand
I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
Live it and I write down and I watch it blow up
Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it in ya system every night, now
[Chorus]
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing
No doubt
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell

Ayo, I jumped from the 8th floor step, hit the ground
The pound fell, cops is coming
Running through the pissy stairwells, I ain't hear nothin'
Buggin', only thing I remember was the bullshit summons
So I stopped at the second floor, ran across
Cracks is fallin', my pockets is mean, clean when I vanished off
Took off, made track look easy
The walkie-talkies them D.T.s had, Black, they was rated PG
Run, I will not give up, no, quick, flag the car down (Yo, yo, yo)
Take me to— Ghost, here they come now
Rrt, pull off quick, back up
Hit the bitch dog, turn down Hill, light the Marley spliff
Run, I will not get bagged on a rock
Run, I seen what happened to Un, they bad with they cops
Run, they amp shit, plant shit, destroy evidence
Fuck a case, I'm not coming home when i'm fifty-six (No)
Die with the heart of Scarface and take fifty licks
Before I let these crackers throw me in shit
Bounce if you a good kid, bounce, do the bird hop
Curve, swerve and get served, these cocksuckers got nerve
Heard I was killing shit, they must got word
That I told the chief of Rich Port I don't wanna merge
[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Run if you sell drugs in the school zone
Run if you getting chased with no shoes on
Run, fuck that, run, cops got guns
They givin' out life, like, by the tons
Run if you ain't do shit, you it
That next felony, nigga, is life, three-zip
So, run, hop fences, jump over benches
When you see me coming, get the fuck out the entrance
Run, fuck that, run, cops got guns, motherfucker

It's task force Tuesday, the narcs is in the black car
I got five hundred hundred-packs in my backyard
Clear twelve-twelves that look like stuffed shells
I'm cutting niggas' throats on the sales while they puff Ls
Don't leave nothing unbagged, shave everything
I learned from the OGs to save everything
They come by one more time, they gon' hop out
They two deep, and one is a bitch, she getting knocked out
Then I can get rid of the pack
But I just copped this pretty chrome thing, so I'm dippin' with that, uh
Downshifting on 'em like I got gears on me
Besides that, I got about five years on me (Run)
Scared to death, running like I got bears on me (Run)
My Timbs start feeling like they Nike Airs on me (Run)
It's hard for me to slow down, it's like I'm on the Thruway
My belt's in the crib on the floor by my two-way
Now I'm trying to hold my hammer up, and my pants too
If they don't kill me, they gon' give me a number I can't do
Rather it be the streets than jail where I die at
And I'm asthmatic, so I'm looking for somewhere to hide at
But they too close, and I got this new toast
Imagine if I would've let off a shot or two, you know what I gotta do

Run if you sell drugs in the school zone
Run if you getting chased with no shoes on

Say that it's love, but to me it's looking counterfeit
I get done with one, and move right on to another bitch (Ha)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, college-educated, she graduated
Any bill she can't front, her parents paid it
The show was far, you the only one with a car
And your girlfriends, but being that she's a big fan, of course she made it
Most girls wanna hide the fact that the thrill, they chase it
But you, just wanna get drunk tonight and fuck someone famous
So I just name a time and a place and your game for it
Value player, hotel room, meet you there

Will I see again? (Trying different drugs and girls)

Tired of this bullshit -- this how Michael felt

I let my lady drive; we on the 85
World's waiting with ten stack bag
I walked in with that ""Yeah that's right -- I'm back"" swag
A gang of us but nah, we don't back flags
Red or blue, everybody goes in black bags
Black coupe, black mags, black gut, black rag
Gucci belt, but the jeans in the bag sag

[Scratches: Fakts One]

[Intro: Sample Quote from John F. Kennedy's ""Profiles in Courage""]
“Whenever we stand against the flow of opinion on strongly contested issues.  A man does what he must in spite of personal consequences, in spite of obstacles and dangers and pressures.  And that is the basis for all human morality.”

[Verse 1: Mr. Lif]
Now let's talk about self-expression, true
Expression.  Open your minds without question
No doubt.  Tell me what you're thinking about
Let's try to set aside pride and clout
Can you believe I feel the same exact way you do?
You truly do believe these modern ways have fooled you
Systems exist so we never meet each other
Pretty soon from now, they'll outlaw the word ""brother""
And that's true if they see you walking with a crew
If you don't know, that means more than two
I'll tell you what they'll do: they'll pull over, hunt you over
Kick your ass—nightstick to your shoulder
I know it's unjust.  As if it wasn't enough
If you try to fight back, they're locking your ass up
And Chuck already told you that a cell is Hell
But I'm waiting for the phone so I'll sit for a spell
Call the guard, tell him I'm a piece of God
With no beliefs in his streets or his boulevards
I eat, read so my mental is hard
And the heat from my anger just melted the bars
They reach for their guns, so I put ‘em to sleep
Break their chains and put their shoes back on my feet
He's on the loose with no discernible scars or marks
Just the mind of Mandela and the heart of Rosa Parks
So I dip.  Time to see the governor and mayor
Tell them life ain't fair, see if they care
Well, they do, but only if they’re on the air
So they appear to have a heart and make a flair
But they haven't done shit for us and that's a fact
Their only function is to keep the funny money where it's at
And it causes pain, stress.  Ask me if
We need a different way of life (Yes)
[Verse 2: Mr. Lif]
Headline: Bush Steals the Presidency.  He needs
The backing of the meat.  What could the remedy be?
The country's headed for recession reminiscent of the Great Depression
Are lives worth a world of power?  Easy question
Planes hit the Towers and the Pentagon, killing those
The government wasn't dependent on.  It's easy to
Control the scared, so they keep us in fear with their favorite
Middle Eastern demon named Bin Laden this year
Bush disguises bloodlust as patriotism, convincing
The living to love ""Operation Let's Get 'Em""
But when he realized we don't support their attacks
They needed something to distract—hmm—anthrax
This further demonizes Afghanis, so
Americans cheer while we kill their innocent families
And what better place to start a war, to build a pipeline
To get the oil that they had wanted before
America supported the Taliban to get Russia
Out of Afghanistan.  That's how they got the arms in
They're in a war against the Northern Alliance
And we can't build a pipeline in hostile environments
Here's what your history books won't show:
You're a dead man for fucking with American dough
They’re killing several birds with one stone while you're
At home with anti-terrorism up in your dome
But my eyes are wide-open and my TV is off
Great 'cause I save on my electricity cost
And you can wave that piece of shit flag if you dare
But they killed us because we've been killing ‘em for years"

Broken glass everywhere
People pissing on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far
'Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

[Chorus: Melle Mel]
Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Ah-huh-huh-huh-huh
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
[Verse 2: Melle Mel]
Standing on the front stoop, hanging out the window
Watching all the cars go by, roaring as the breezes blow
A crazy lady livin' in a bag
Eating out of garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A zircon princess, seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watching all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so, so saditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

My brother's doing bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standing on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm going insane, I swear I might hijack a plane

My son said, ""Daddy, I don't wanna go to school
'Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
'Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park 'cause it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun 'cause they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say, 'You want some more?' Livin' on a see-saw""

It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

[Verse 5: Melle Mel]
A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smiling on you, but he's frowning too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto living second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song of deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Driving big cars, spending twenties and tens
And you wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say, ""I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool""
But then you wind up droppin' out of high school
Now you're unemployed, all null and void
Walking 'round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Being used and abused to serve like hell
'Til one day you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young, so

[Chorus: Melle Mel]
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Ah-huh-huh-huh-huh
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
Huh, ah-huh-huh-huh-huh
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
Huh, ah-huh-huh-huh-huh

[Outro Skit]
Yo, Mel, you see that girl there?

No Love,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Haddaway, Eminem, & Lil Wayne]

Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
Young Money, yeah
No more
Love

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne & Haddaway]
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's ""Fuck the world,"" get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers (No love)
I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my nightstands are full of open Bibles
Uh, I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expectin' not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighin' problems on a triple beam
I'm stickin' to the script, you niggas skippin' scenes
Uh, be good or be good at it
Fuckin' right, I got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up, up and away
Man, I'll come down in a couple of days
Okay, you want me up in the cage?
Then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G code
It's Weezy, motherfucker, Blood gang, and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found
[Chorus: Eminem, Lil Wayne, Both, & (Haddaway)]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Yeah)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (Hurt me)
That's right, it don't (Hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you (No more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (Love)
You showed me nothing but hate (Haha!)
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around (Yeah)
And I don't need you (Don't hurt me)
That's right, you don't (Hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)

Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
No! (No love) No! (No love)
And I don't need you (No more)
Get 'em!

[Verse 2: Eminem, Lil Wayne, & Both]
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been
In my whole entire life, I can (Yeah)
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
Uh, I'm a little bit sicker than most
Shit's finna get thick again, they say the competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in
I ain't never giving in again (Yeah)
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em
So why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em? (Yeah!)
They call me a freak, 'cause I like to
Spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em (Haha)
Man, get these wack cocksuckers off stage!
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him? (Oh!)
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch, I'ma let you finish in a minute
Yeah, that rap was tight, but I'm (Yeah!)
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um (Yeah!)
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd (Yeah)
You can see the sparks from hot metal (Yeah)
Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted
The game, my soul started to rot, fellow (Yeah)
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted, ‘cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm topplin' from the top, I'm not gonna stop
I'm standin' on my Monopoly board (Uh)
That means I'm on top of my game
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore (Shit)
When you're so good that you can't say it
‘Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore (Shit)
People just get sick ‘cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore (Ow!)
And you can never break my stride (Nope)
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride
Killin' the flow, slow venom
And the opponent is gettin' no mercy, mark my words
Ain't lettin' up, relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep givin' them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love
[Chorus: Eminem, Lil Wayne, Both, & (Haddaway)]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Uh)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (Hurt me)
Yeah, that's right, it don't (Hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you (No more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (Love)
You showed me nothing but hate (Yeah!)

The Real Slim Shady,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here...

[Verse 1]
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—
[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 2]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a GRAMMY?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 3]
I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Ha ha, I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up!

Love the Way You Lie,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—
[Chorus: Rihanna & Eminem]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"

Although the whole world knows your name, so on the
Biggest stage, they came to see you spit your game, oh-woah
But it shouldn't be difficult to explain
Just why you came back again, you hate the fame, love the game
Cold as ice you remain, fuck 'em all
Tell 'em all eat shit, here we go again

Oh! (Dum, du-du-du-dum, dum-du-dum) (Yeah, yup, yeah)

You don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah, struck a nerve, sucker
Motherfucker, might as well let my lips pucker
Like Elton John, 'cause I'm just a mean cocksucker
The shit is on 'cause you went and pissed me off

Fuck it, I'm a loose cannon, Bruce Banner's back in the booth
Y'all are sittin' ducks, I'm the only goose standin'
I'll set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out
Stick my dick in a circle, but I'm not fuckin' around
Motherfucker, I'll saw you pussy-footin'
I'll kick a bitch in the cunt 'til it makes a queef and sounds like a fuckin' whoopee cushion
Who the fuck is you pushin'?
You musta mistook me for some sissy soft punk lookin' for some nookie or bosom
Go ahead, fuckin' hater, push me!

Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song
""Oh, bitches don't like that"", homie, I'll be nicer to women
When Aquaman drowns and the Human Torch starts swimmin'
Man, I'm a cold soul, I roll solo, so, don't compare
Me to them other bums over there
It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums, yeah
I'm bananas, pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear, you try to diss me, I'll slaughter you
I put that on everything, like everyone does with Auto-Tune
The last thing you want to do is have me spit out a rhyme
And say, ""I was writing this and I thought of you""

Haters gotta go on iTunes to go get me
Gators, matadors, baboons, and those grizzlies
All come out me when I'm on the micropho-N-E
Mic check, two-three; I'm different like blue pee
And my girls be half naked like Betty Boop be
Like a hoopty, man, the boy been riding
And I ain't gassed up, 'cause I'm more like a hybrid
You think I'm stunting, but no, I'm just surviving
And I been here, but my soul is just arriving
Look up in the air, it's a crow, it's a robin
No Ceilings, full dose, I'm prescribing
Medication free, and for meditation, we
Smoke some better tastin' weed that you’ll ever taste or see
S-H-A-R-P as a tack, hotter than
Riding through the desert on a camel back, I done been
Riding through wherever with the hammer strapped, I ain't lying
I can do whatever if I'm planning that
So I got my guns, let's dance, like FannyPack
And we cook the hard, cut the soft, and bring the whammys back
Mafio, bitch, where your motherfucking family at?
Call my nigga Gudda if you trying to get your mammy back
All up in another nigga woman, I be ramming that
Seeing through these see-through niggas like they're laminate
Hip-hop so contaminate, I swear, just examine it
And I'm such a philanthropist, the God to these evangelists
I dress so Los Angeles, but I love Miami, though
I act so New Orl-e-ans, yes, I go pistachios
That means I go nuts on any beat they throw at me
And the bitches is so at me, and you know what they throw at me
Hahaha!

No—No Ceilings"
Infinite,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Mr. Porter & Jeff Bass]

[Intro]
Aw, yeah (It's like this, like this)
It's Eminem, baby
Back up in that motherfuckin' ass
('Til forever, 'til forever)
One time for your motherfuckin' mind (For MC's, MC's)
We represent the 313—you know what I’m sayin'?
Yo, they don’t know shit about this, for the '96

[Verse 1]
Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin', the zany actin' maniac in action
A brainiac, in fact, son, you mainly lack attraction
You look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks runs
My rhymin' skills got you climbin' hills
I travel through your mind and chill your spine like siren drills
I'm slimin' grills of roaches with spray that disinfects
And twistin' necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
Put this in decks and check the monologue, turn your system up
Twist 'em up and indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more car-tunes than animation
My lamination of nar-er-ration, hits a snare and bass
On a track for duck rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be starin' gazin'
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland
I'm infinite
[Hook]
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it, but when I hear the beat
I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm infinite

[Verse 2]
Bust it, I let the beat commence
So I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince
Some fruit to stomp, and then two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leakin' like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper than a jeep-full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's and stand the lonely one
Imitator intimidator, stimulator
Simulator of data, eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
My thesis'll smash a stereo to pieces
My acappella releases classic masterpieces, through telekinesis
It eases you mentally, gently
Sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be infinite
[Hook]
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it, but when I hear the beat
I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm infinite

[Verse 3]
Man, I got evidence, I'm never dense
And I've been clever ever since
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the MO
So I'm assumin' all responsibility
'Cause there's a monster real in me that always wants to kill MC's
Mic nestler, slammin' like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric-smugglin' embezzler
No one is specialer, my skill is intergalactical
I get cynical, act a fool then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy
In fact, I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratchin'
So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo
On my last jam plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be
‘Cause once you make an instant hit, I'm tensed a bit
And tempted when I see the sins my friends commit
I'm infinite
[Hook]
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it, but when I hear the beat
I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm infinite
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it, but when I hear the beat
I'm tempted to make another attempt at it

Let me know, let me know
Ahhh, let me know
Let me know, let me know

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uhh, yeah
This is really one of my dumbest flows ever, I haven’t slept in days
And me and my latest girl agreed to go our separate ways
So I’m single, thinkin' 'bout what we had and missin' you
But I ain't Santa, I got somethin' for these bad bitches too
I mean paparazzi on me, tryin' not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out
Baby don’t hold on too long 'cause that’s how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me eat your muthafuckin' heart out
It's Drizzy, always gone but never hard to find
And since you can’t escape me, do I ever cross your mind?
Because all this shit is new to me, I’m learnin' to behave
And still spendin' every dollar they encourage me to save
But I’m good, I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle
I’m lookin' forward to the memories of right now
Never forgettin' from where I came
And no matter where I’m headed, I promise to stay the same
I'm just
[Chorus: Jeezy & Drake]
I’m just ridin' 'round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl, I’m the realest nigga she been around
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talkin' 'bout the greatest
I just really hope that (I just really hope that you'll think of me)
I just really hope that (You'll think of me)
I just really hope that (You'll think of me)
I'm doing my thang, I'm doing my thang, I'm doing my thang
('Cause I'm tryna be unforgettable)

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
This just might be my realest flow ever
When I say ""for life,” y'all say ""forever""
It's hard but it's fair, I told that girl life hurts
The closest you gon' get to this is a Pac t-shirt
The name's Young baby, you know I live that thug life
The good die young so I’ma need a thug wife
Yeah, I’m talkin' his and her firearms
Know our jewelry probably louder than a car alarm
Yeah, I remember I used to have to sneak the car
Now my insides looking like a Snickers bar
Yeah, I’m talking caramel leathers
Damn right, so fly I need feathers
Same shit in them streets, so what's the dilly?
Young done everything in the A but fuck Chilli
So welcome to my life: no two days the same
Like for y'all to meet the love of my life, her name's the game
[Chorus: Jeezy & Drake]
I’m just ridin' 'round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl, I’m the realest nigga she been around
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talkin' 'bout the greatest
I just really hope that (I just really hope that you'll think of me)
I just really hope that (You'll think of me)

Got my top dropped on this beautiful night
It's a beautiful night to live my beautiful life
Pain hurts like a cut from a beautiful knife
Just know she right here on my hip, my beautiful wife
Yeah, Drizzy we got 'em lil' bruh, unforgettable
You’ll never forget this, ya understand me?

I'm so up there and so out there, you so not here
Hey, hey, you see we so up there and we so out there
Uh, yeah, let me get it right here first. Hey!

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
I'm wakin', up in the morning
Hustlin' to the stage, if I've been performin'
Bustlin' through the hay and bustin' the door in
Lately nothin' messes up my step and scorin'
And speakin' of the Misses, I'm watchin' 'em pour in (Uh)
Just like a drink that I'm enjoyin'
And don't mean bottles, you welcome to join in
Just look at me soarin', feelin' like Jordan

On the top but you just don't get it yet
I don't get cut, I make 'em cut the check
Can't hear me in the stands, let me say it again

On the top but you just don't get it yet
I never got cut but I make 'em cut the check
So hate on but guess what

I know they want me to fall

You know you lookin at winner, winner, winner

I'm steppin' out in the evening
Keep winnin' and screamin'
You gotta be cheatin' but I'm so breezy
I make this look easy
And y'all thinkin' I'm seasoned, you gotta believe me
I went from TVs to screens to DVDs
To CDs to MP3s overseas
I got, no time, the talking is boring
Just look at me soarin', feeling like Jordan

[Verse 3: T.I.]
That's right, you see the, Porsche Panamera, got 'em in hysteria
The turbo super fast and that McLaren even scarier
Hear me turnin' corners, burnin' rubber in your area
I'm hard to follow once I pop the clutch and hit the throttle
I'm recession proof, I don't run to money, money run to me
In this economy, guess I'm considered an anomaly
Bugattis, Maseratis, new Ferraris, I got one of each
My future bright, tight like the pussy out in front of me
Turn pain to progression in every studio session
Passion into perfection, to failure I'm an exception
Fuck if you wanna lose, to battle me is a blessing
You couldn't die at the hands of a better man
I ran from the bottom to the best, no Auto-Tune
Been in the lead, say you seen King follow whom
Never that, I'm the freshest go ask whoever that
King back, money long as a old Cadillac

Mack, bitch - I move blocks and pounds
I move out with small blocks and towns
Move out with small Glocks and pounds (uh-huh)
And I take everything to the table, bag and rock it down
Fuck who watching now; the neighbors, they in pocket now
Fuck you haters -- cop some pocket now
When it come to coke, you can't outwit me; mine cheap
'Bout to take over the city of Philly like John Street
Nigga, ask all y'all fiends, they call me Chef Boy-ar-Beans
Beanie Crocker, cook coke proper
Right amount of flour sifting it up
Coke spots running by the hour, shifting it up
Graveyard shifts, move packs in bundles

I'm in the hood eating with my dog like when we break fast
B's on the hood and the wheel and the brake pad
Shit, when I skate past, bitches shake ass
I sit four-thirty deep in wheels
You 'bout four-thirty cheap in wheels - small Benz
Look at your small rims, small wheel, small grill

Get them digits clear you can come and get them pigeons here
Niggas talk about the crack game slowed up, BULLSHIT
You switched your hustle when the rap game showed up (uh-huh)
While you wasting your time spitting them rhymes
I'm getting mine spitting them rhymes, plus still pitching them dimes
And the spot still sick with da grime
Glock 26 nigga but I'm sicker than nine
I'm live with the pound, small silencer calming the sound
Stick with the seven, strictly Smith with the seven (shit)
When I drop back and cock back
And pop that, I'm popping for keeps -

Only nigga did it was Jay, and he did it when I signed the contract

Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffers and low fades
I keep thinkin', how young can you die from old age?
They always tell me: ""Nobody's workin' as hard as you""
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true
'Cause while all of my closest friends out partyin'
I'm just here makin' all the music that they party to
But party on, party on all night, nigga
I got these new rappers nervous: prom night, nigga
I grow tired of these fuckin' grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
Uh, but I just want to tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
The shit feel like when Fredro Starr
Was in Sunset Park stuntin' hard in his yellow goose - yeah!
And I'm a motherfuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless, and I just started
Was that directed at moi? Can't be
They must be talkin' to themselves, Hov: hands free
Yeah, and I'm just fillin' up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star: no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends: Kelsey Grammer
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doin' you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you
And if you pillow-talkin' with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga
When she through with you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all, even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I got to feel alive, even if it kills me
Promise to always give you me, the real me

Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
(Ay Guru tell, tell homegirl to open that Ace right there...)
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down I'ma make it go

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Oww, hoes turn they heads like owls
I'm the man of the hour
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flow, I'm connected to a higher power
Bright lights'll make your whole city light up
A trillion-watt light bulb when I'm in the night club
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight 'cause the satellite was crispy, uhh
Y'all can miss me with the money talk
The smart money's on Hov', fuck what the dummies talk, uhh
I don't do too much bloggin'
I just run the town, I don't do too much joggin'
Mm, I ain't got a scar yet
'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake, here's how they gon' come at you
With silly rap feuds, tryin' to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini meeting, watch for the traitors, uhh
I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dum-dums could done him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let them tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was cool as the Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would have went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas! Bitches, too!
All I got is this money — this'll do
[Chorus: Drake]
Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down I'ma make it go"
Ghetto Supastar That Is What You Are,Pras,"['hip hop', 'dance', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Man, man
Look at the sky
All the stars, man, the stars is beautiful tonight
Look at 'em

[Hook: Mya & (ODB)]
Ghetto supastar (Supastar)
That is what you are (That's what you are)
Coming from afar (Coming from afar)
Reaching for the stars (Reaching from the stars)
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh (Yeah)
From one corner to another, uh-huh

[Verse 1: Pras]
Uh, yeah, yo, yo
Some got hopes and dreams, we got ways and means
The supreme dream team always up with the schemes
From hubcaps to selling raps, name your theme
My rise to the top, floating on this cream
Who the hell wanna stop me? I hated those who doubt me
A million ReFugees with unlimited warranties
Black Caesar, dating top divas
Diplomatic legalese; no time for a Visa
They just begun, I'ma shoot them one-by-one
Got five sides to me, something like a pentagon
Strike with the forces of King Solomon
Letting bygones be bygones, and so on, and so on
I'ma teach this cat how to live in the ghetto
Keeping it retrospective from the get go
Lay low, let my mind shine like a halo
Pa-Pa-Politic with ghetto senators on the D-low
[Hook: Mya & (ODB)]
Ghetto supastar
That is what you are
Coming from afar (Uh-huh)
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner to another, uh-huh

[Verse 2 : ODB]
One, two, and you don't stop, yo!
My eyes is sore, being a senator
Behind closed doors hitting truth to the seafloor
The rich go North, ignore the tug of war
While the kids are poor, open new and better drug stores
So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more
I'ma reveal everything, change the law
I find myself walking the streets
Tryna find what's really going on in the streets

[Verse 3: Pras]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
Now every dog got his day, needless to say
When the chief away that's when them cats want to play
I told you, mess around you fools like Cassius Clay
Stretch my heater make you do a pas de bourree
Kick your balls like Pelé, pick 'em doing ballet
Peak like Dante, broader than Broadway
Get applause like a matador, cry yelling, ""Ole!""
Who the hell wanna save me?, From B.K. to Cali
[Hook: Mya & (Pras)]
Ghetto supastar (Come on, uh)
That is what you are
Coming from afar
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner to another, uh-huh

[Verse 3: Pras]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Just when you thought it was safe in a common place
Showcase your finest is losing fast in the horse race
Two-faced, getting defaced, out like Scarface
Throw your roll money, let me put on my screwface

[Verse 4: ODB]
Well, I'm paranoid at the things I say
Wondering what's the penalty from day to day, I'm hanging out
Partying with girls that never die, you see, I was
Picking on the small fries, my campaign telling lies
Was just spreading my love, didn't know my love
Was the one holding the gun and the glove
But it's all good as long as it's understood
It's all together now in the hood
[Chorus: Mya & (Pras)]
Ghetto supastar
That is what you are
Coming from afar
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
(Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh)
From one corner to another, uh-huh (yeah)
(All-stars)
Ghetto supastar
That is what you are
Coming from afar
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me (Sing it, baby) to another place (Sing it, baby)
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner to another, uh-huh
(Uh-huh, yeah)
(Heeee, ahhh)"
Thank You,MC Jin,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Jin]
This feels good right here, uh
I'm just happy to be here... I mean
I gotta take a moment to thank those that made a difference
Whether small or big, damn
Where should I start though?

Uhh, first and foremost I gotta give praise
To the Lord above and His almighty ways
Blessin me with the gift to lift spirits
And evoke emotions through these words, every time you hear it
I got the lyrics and flow, I'm capable so
When I blow, just know this one's for April and Joe
Me and my little sister, we grateful, you know?
Wish I could see you more Avah at the rate that you grow
My favorite uncle Franky, for openin your door
When I ain't have a place to stay, I crashed on your floor
Taught me the basic survival tools
Auntie Cathy, every summer kept me in vacation bible school
Mr. Diskin, for more than passin grades
And my fourth grade teacher Mr. Scott who passed away (R.I.P.)
Peep how I met Kamel, corner on the street
We goin to the top, let's do it for Shawna and Jaleek
In the beginnin, no one was on Jin's side folks
Bar and Amaury, whoa Bundy, that's an inside joke
Before bullshit friendships, synthetic for cream
Chilled with my Wall Click - Bryan, Cedric and Jean
So when I moved to N.Y., chose to invest in a few
One love to Patricia Ben and the rest of the crew
To be loved is a privilege, that's what I was told
A gem from my man L.S. more precious than gold
Infamous Joe, lacin my tat so sick
Fong, Young Mac and Ken down at Ho Yips
To Dee, Waah, Chivon and the rest of the Dean's
For believin in a young man, obsessed with a dream
Allowin me to write ""History,"" create my own chapter
All original Ryders and the generation after
The Double-R staff, my thanks worth a million
And the whole 30th floor, at the Universal buildin
You could never walk in my shoes, or stand in my boots
Know how I came up, I'll never abandon my roots
Yeah, C-Rayz, Poison Pen for sharin the stage
Shouts to Stronghold, Tone and the rest of the Plague
Ask Big Zoo, we ten steps ahead of ya
Vice Verses, i2i, E-O-Dub regulars
My man J-Pure, for bringin the heat right
And the rest of the poets, chillin under street lights (whattup)
Just keep the beats tight, shouts to the record spinners
Enuff, Felli Fel, and all The Heavy Hitters (sup now)
Kubichi, K-Sly hold me down in L.A
Might catch me flickin it up, with Von in the Bay
Then it's off to the ""Wake Up Show"" with Tech and Sway
Or Big Nat and Foot, out in V-A (uhh)
It's damn near tradition, to kick a freestyle
Anytime I'm with Eddie Francis out in C-Town
Can't forget, Home Team, as high as I'll be
Supa Cindy, Big Lip, and DJ Irie
The club and mixtape DJ's that break records
Cause thanks to them (uh-huh) we've heard some great records
Shouts out to the Technitions, they get props
Feel free to holla, anytime you need drops (holla at ya boy)
Bob Collina, the only one to call
Anytime ya boy Jin got a run-in with the law
Bert Padell, a.k.a. Big Babe Ruth
Got the Brinks truck outside, let's get paid loot
6-4-6-6, the trips back and forth
From the studio to the crib, I'm never slackin off
How 'bout Will, Spivey and of course Killa Kai
Boondo, Randy, Feron, just a few of my
Close associates, that I love to see
School me to the game, like Joe Box and Brother E
Razor and Mario for all them times we rock shows
To the rest of 176, tato
Holla-Front.com, go register today
Peter Jun, Rock, Lisa, Landy and J
Keepin it fresh, Ellis at the barbershop
Coast to coast lifestyles, reppin the ""R"" a lot
My man Kartoon, bringin the fresh sound
Cookie and Matt, O.G.'s holdin the West down
And of course Swizz, Watts, Carl, Climax
Far East Movement, they got what ya minds lacks
T-Dot, Montreal where I keep mass appeal
Ramiro, Baby Yu, R.G. and Neal
It pays to keep it real, even more to be sincere
Thanks to BET for jump-startin my career
As for ""106,"" who they askin about?
Free and A.J., can't wait to see y'all back on the couch
And MTV, for givin ""Advanced Warnings""
John Singleton, plus the chance at performin
The Source, XXL, Rolling Stone, Vibe
The truth, the lies, the layout, and rides
For every write-up, forever in context (uh-huh)
King Magazine, Elle Girl and Complex
To all the producers for providin the beats
Shouts to Neo, Tuneheadz, Devine and Elite
J.R., Wyclef, Kanye - can I rep
This is real hip-hop, be damned if I let
Y'all tell me otherwise, cause we so live
This one's for, 9-5-4 and 3-oh-5
All the way to 7-1-8, and 2-1-2
And if you ever show love, this one's for you
But I gotta say thanks, even those that hated
Cause, cause - y'all kept me motivated, uhh
[Outro: Jin]
Whooo! You see
A lot of times people don't appreciate the love and support
That they get, from they family and friends
Haters and those that love them too, but not me
See, I never take none of that for granted
So I knew I had to take a moment at least
To let y'all know how I felt about it, c'mon
(I gotta thank, God; I wanna thank, y'all) {*4X*}
Uh-huh, each and every one of y'all, it's only right
Cause without y'all, there is no me
Oh and Chach I ain't forget about you
I know when you mixin this down, you gon' do a real good job on it
I know I probably forgot a ton of people but
Don't think that, you don't count or you ain't important
It's just that, it's a lot goin on right now
I got my L lit, little bit of Hennessy left in my cup
And I don't really drink like that, heh
I love y'all, ""The Rest is History"" baby

Yeah, yo J.J. (What up Block?)
This beat is crazy man it's cold. (Thank you thank you.)
So cold. Block McCloud (Word) Big Lou what up?
(And it goes like this.)

[Verse One] [Block McCloud]
I'm so cold I'm cool, it's like a visit to North Pole
And Block McCloud is the wizard of blizzards
If I don't know ya I'm frigged
Storm by ya like a breeze
But my swagger my steez will make a shorty freeze
And drop to her knees like she coppin' a plea
I'm not iced out or coppin' no V
I'm just poppin' with these
Metaphors makin' sense to all of they charm
As soon as I enter the door, temperature change, droppin' degrees
Like a Masters, a Bachelors, a Doctorate please
I hear myself I'm so sick with the flow, I'll probably sneeze (Achu)
I'm so catchy, common cold, you wanna party with me
Well if I got it, you got it, now you caught the disease
Not your a Mark Of The Beast, a monster like Reef
That stomps through the east
And wants to be freed to conquor the streets
Uh, at night I'm heat
I'm hot, I'm cold on the morning block
Changin' the whole games climate like global warmin'
Hey hey
[Hook]
This world made me what I am
And I am, just adaptin' to the weather
So run on home and get your coat cause I'm so cold
You better run and find some shelter
I'm so darn cold hearted
To hot to handle, to cold to hold

[Verse Two] [J.J. Brown]
My prose froze like an icebox, colder than white cops
So Wind in the City where they hostin' the White Sox
I'm chilly like a chick with silly loot at the night spot
A willy cause I'm Cool Hand Luke but my dice hot
Frosty as the Rockies, y'all just photo copies
Warm until exposed, the way Sodom broke the Nazi's
Go head and get your posse
I hope you know a polar bear
Cause you gonna need a coat this storm
I hear it's pretty cold in there
Jeah
I'm freezin', it's top season for frost season
Up oxygen to your car freezin', ya stop breathin'
(Hey Jay when you gon' quit?)
Homie not even
I don't give a shit, come equipped cause the block's teethin'
Had low temperatures
Brown bounced the predators
Master beat is red as I drown out competitors
Cold as evidence
Ground beneath the sediments
Sounds that crush clowns like mounds of beefin' elephants
You geeks will never get, a skotch of my shine
?No Gargamel like you was book?, but the flow shit is mine
Look
Cool your heels fam
Don't touch the pestilence
Jay got yourself in the clouds bless the medicines
Like hey
[Hook]

[J.J. Brown Speaking]
Ladies and gentlemen. Me and this dude go way back. Celph Titled!

[Verse Three] [Celph Titled]
I love this sound proof foam inside my mic booth
It makes me feel like I'm in a padded room
Insane asylum sick with a deranged smile
And I'll electrocute your recruits
(What's this man mean?)
I'm awful with
Ether or arsenic in my canteen
Rappers can't compete with me
Fuck it I'm a beast on beats
I get mine
I'm grid iron
You eatin' cleats for Easter treats
You singin' summer camp songs
I'm Ol' Dirty Bastard, Janet Jackson's Rolling Stones cover, hands on
I'm cold
From production to lyrics
I'll fuck with the spirits
That unleash catastrophic mayhem fire, that sears kids
Call a bitch to fuck cause I need sex
Like motherfuckin' Terrell Owen's needs Kleenex
So respect
The ring leader, let's ring it off
Jehovah's Witness with a sawed off and I'll ring your door

Oh, I'll watch the exercise video and thought an ab crunch was new cereal

POWER,Kanye West,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Andrew Dawson, Jeff Bhasker, Kanye West, Mike Dean & S1]

[Intro: Kanye West]
I'm living in that 21st century, doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music

[Chorus: Kanye West]
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
(21st-century schizoid man)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
The system broken, the school's closed, the prison's open
We ain't got nothing to lose, motherfucker, we rolling
Huh? Motherfucker, we rolling
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning
Huh? I'll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment
[Chorus: Kanye West]
No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-century schizoid man)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas' thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows he's so fuckin' gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Thinking no one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the powder
'Til then, fuck that, the world’s ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-century schizoid man)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day, goddamnit, I'm killing this shit
I know damn well y'all feeling this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?
How Ye doing? I'm survivin'
I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hidin'?
I got the power make your life so excitin'

[Outro: Kanye West & Dwele]
Now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
Mmm, now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
Now this will be a beautiful death
Jumping out the window, letting everything go
Letting everything go
You got the power to let power go?

[Intro]
Ayo, this song is dedicated
To all the happy people
All the happy people who have real nice lives
And have no idea what it's like to be broke as fuck

[Verse 1]
I feel like I'm walkin' a tight rope without a circus net
Poppin' Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check
I'm 'bout to burst this TEC at somebody to reverse this debt
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage, 'specially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer
Watchin' ballers while they flossin' in they Pathfinders
These overnight stars becomin' autograph-signers
We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small fries and average half-pinters
But player-haters turnin' bitch like they have vaginas
'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money'll brainwash you and leave yo' ass mindless
Them snakes slither in the grass, spineless
[Chorus]
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

[Verse 2]
My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
I'm hopin' things look up, but there ain't no job openings
I feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished
Livin' in this house with no furnace, unfurnished
And I'm sick of workin' dead-end jobs with lame pay
And I'm tired of bein' hired and fired the same day
But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game, play
'Cause when we die, we know we all goin' the same way
'Cause it's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan
When all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan
Or comfortable and roomy in a 6
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
Who walk around depressed, and smoke a pound of cess a day
And yesterday went by so quick, it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball, but I'm too stressed to play
Live half my life and throw the rest away
[Chorus]
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

[Verse 3]
There's people that love me and people that hate me (Yup)
But it's the evil that made me
This backstabbin', deceitful and shady (Mhm)
I want the money, the women, the fortune and fame
That means I end up burnin' in Hell, scorchin' in flame
That means I'm stealin' your checkbook and forgin' your name
This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
'Cause right now, I feel like I've just hit the rock bottom
I've got problems, now everybody on my block's got 'em (Duh)
I'm screamin' like them two cops when 2Pac shot 'em
Holdin' two Glocks, hope your doors got new locks on 'em
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em
And them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em
And while you flaunt 'em
I could be takin' 'em to shops to pawn 'em
I got a couple of rings and a brand-new watch, you want 'em?
'Cause I ain't never went gold off one song
I'm runnin' up on someone's lawn with guns drawn
[Chorus]
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom"
Bad Meets Evil,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Jeff Bass]

[Intro: Cowboy (Jeff Bass)]
I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon
20 years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over
Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em
Quickest damn gun-slingers I've ever seen
Got murdered in cold-blood
That old saloon there was their little home away from home
They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern
And on a quiet night, you can still hear
The footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da 5'9""

[Verse 1: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9""]
I don't speak, I float in the air, wrapped in a sheet
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph
And the noise is spread
Picked up and transmitted through Royce's head (Uhh)
Trap him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed
'Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
Told him each one of his boys is dead (Ohh)
I asked him to come to the dark side
He made a choice and said (Yo)
Who hard? Yo, I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity
Holds that of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the Devil, intelligence level
Is hellier than treble peakin' on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of an atheist
Interceptin' missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life, when the black knight mounted the white horse
And stay over-worked, it's like the Nazis and the Nation
Collaboratin', attemptin' to take over the Earth
[Chorus: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9""]
'Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
We hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Above the law 'cause I don't agree with police either
Shit, me neither

[Verse 2: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9""]
We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts
While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle (Ahh)
Releasin' rage on anybody in squeezin' range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezin' rain
(He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up
And I'm pissed off, 'cause I can't find a decent vein
The disaster with dreads, I'm bad enough to commit suicide
And survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger, it's funny, actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
'Cause I serve any stranger with money
I spray a hundred, man, until they joint chains
While slippin' bullets at point-blank range like they was punches
Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral
Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it
Whippin' human ass, throwin' blows, crackin' jaws
With my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass
I'm blazin' emcees, at the same time amazin' emcees
Somehow, emcees ain't that eyebrow-raisin' to me
From all of angles of us, flash a MAC loud enough
To cast a avalanche and bust 'til volcanoes erupt
[Interlude: Eminem]
Hello? (Billy?)
Ayo, what’s up? (We're comin' to get you)
Stop, they know it's us

[Verse 3: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9""]
I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? (Uh-uh)
I'm the one who burned your house down (Oh)
Well, I'm out now (Shit)
And this time, I'm comin' back to blow your house up
And I ain't gon' leave you with a window to jump out of
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
And you won't see me, like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin' ready to leave
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"" & Eminem]
'Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Against peaceful, see you in Hell for the sequel
(We'll be waiting) See you in Hell (Uh-huh)
Wall Street (Yup), Royce Da 5'9"", Slim Shady (Uh)
See you in Hell for the sequel (Bye-bye)
Bad Meets Evil, what? (Until next time)
[Outro: Cowboy (Jeff Bass)]
And so, that's the story of when Bad meets Evil
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did
Got shot in the back comin' out of that old saloon
But their spirits still live on 'til this day
Shh, wait, did y'all hear that?"
9AM in Dallas,Drake,"['hip hop', 'pop', 'r&b']","[Verse]
These are my One St. Thomas flows
Me, my niggas and some Madonna hoes
That look just like virgins but trust they down to go
Discussing life and all our common goals
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll
Look how the champagne diamonds glow
Fine dining pour another glass when the wine is low
I'm in the crib stacking money from here to the ceiling
Whatever it is I got, it's clearly appealing
These other rappers getting that inferior feeling
I hope you feel it in your soul, spiritual healing
Take a look at yourself, the mirror's revealing
If you ain't got it, you ain't got it the theory is brilliant
People ask how music is going, I heard it pays
I just came off making two million in 30 days
Damn, ""I guess it does"" is what the message was
Sometimes I feel I be spending my money just because
With Weezy I'm just out here repping us
'til I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessing us
Yeah, I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics
Kush got the room smelling like teen spirit
I ask kindly if no one out here would bring defeat up
Until I lose, for now I'm the game's single leader
I fly private so no one tells me to bring my seat up
And book a suite where me and your favorite singer meet up
Who you like, tell me who it is
I'mma make sure that that woman is the next one on my list
I should call it a night, but fuck it I can't resist
This one is for all the niggas from my city trying to diss
Without a response from me you really fail to exist
And I love to see you fail, that feeling there is the shit
I swear, pussy nigga get your bread up
Enjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced your ass to let up
Why your scary ass looking down, pick ya head up
No one told you your disguise was the most ridiculous get-up?
With nose-plugs in now, I can smell the set-up
So you just wasting your time, you only making me better, yeah
I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff
Chase N. Cash that's my brother from the Surf Club
Damn, that nigga always kept it so hood
Back when we would smoke good at the Oakwoods
And have girls fall through like coins in the couch
Now we just fucking all the bitches they warned us about
Scared for the first time, everything just clicked
What if I don't really do the numbers they predict?
Considering the fact that I'm the one that they just picked
To write a chapter in history, this shit has got me sick
But if I really do it don't expect to get a split
Cause this truly is some shit I don't expect for y'all to get
I'm nervous but I'mma kill it cause they 'bout to let the realest team in
Throwing up in the huddle nigga, Willie Beamen
But still throwing touchdown passes
In tortoise frame glasses, hopin' that someone catch it
People say that old Drake, we startin' to miss it
But they need to be a little more specific
Is this what y'all want? In my best Chris Tucker impression
Ducking your questions, fuck your suggestions
Money gets all of my love and affection
Cars all black like the cover of Essence
I'm allergic to coming in second but I never sneeze
Y.M.O.E. nigga, yeah

Uh, yeah, this what yall want

Diamonds From Sierra Leone Remix,Kanye West,"['hip hop', 'pop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Shirley Bassey]
Diamonds are forever
They are all I need to please me
They can stimulate and tease me
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might desert me

[Chorus: Kanye West & Shirley Bassey]
Diamonds are forever
Forever, forever (Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe)
Diamonds are forever
Forever, forever (The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme)
(Forever) Forever ever? Forever ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
(And ever) Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Good mornin', this ain't Vietnam, still
People lose hands, legs, arms, for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin' about the ones that be glowin', I'm talkin' about Roc-a-Fella, my home
My chain, these ain't conflict diamonds
Is they, Jacob? Don't lie to me, mane
See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin'
How when I know what a blood diamond is?
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today
Over here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus piece was so harmless
'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life tryna get that ice
On a Polo rugby, it look so nice
How can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?
Right? 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight, because
[Chorus: Kanye West & Shirley Bassey]
Diamonds are forever
Forever, forever (Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe)
Diamonds are forever
Forever, forever (The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme)
(Forever) Forever ever? Forever ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
(And ever) Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Verse 2: Kanye West & JAY-Z]
Uh
People askin' me is I'm gon' give my chain back (Uh)
That'll be the same day I give the game back (Uh)
You know the next question, dawg, ""Yo, where Dame at?"" (Uh)
This track the Indian dance that bring our rain back (Woo)
""What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?""

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Yup
I got it from here, 'Ye, damn
The chain remains, the gang is intact (Uh-huh)
The name is mine, I'll take blame for that
The pressure's on, but guess who ain't gon' crack?
Haha, pardon me, I had to laugh at that
How could you falter when you're the Rock of Gibraltar?
I had to get off the boat so I could walk on water
This ain't no tall order, this is nothin' to me
Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep, I sold kilos of coke (So?)
I'm guessin' I can sell CDs
I'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man
Let me handle my business, damn
Kanyeez you got me, Freeway then Foxy
YG's, Teairra Mari, Peedi watch me
Bleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as I'm alive he's a millionaire
And even if I die he's in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere, oh yeah
He don't even have to write rhymes
The Dynasty like my money: last three lifetimes
Shirley Bassey's in the rear, sayin' exactly
What I been sayin' practically my whole career
The diamond is forever, I've been minin' this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better
People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'
Instead we rose up from the ash like a phoenix
If you're waitin' for the end of the Dynasty sign
It would seem like forever is a mighty long time (Ha)

The Resistance,Drake,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Yesterday when we were getting high
You were invited, you woulda liked it
I-I- I know you all too well
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye
But you weren't excited
There's no way to fight it
You can stay but shawty, here I go

[Verse 1]
Uh, should I spend a weekend in Vegas?
I'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it
I mean, how could I forget? My memory's never faded
I can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it
I am still here with who I started with
The game needed life, I put my heart in it
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit
Carry the weight for my city like a cargo ship
Uh, I'm 23 with a money tree
Growing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds
It's ironic 'cause my mother was a florist
And that's how she met my pops
And now my garden is enormous
""It's happening, Penny Lane, just like you said!""
I avoided the coke game and went with Sprite instead
Uh-huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up
I'm trying to do better than good enough
[Chorus]
What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say ""You promised me you would never change""
""You promised me you would never change""

[Verse 2]
Uh, am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on?
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on, now that I'm on
I don't really want to worry 'bout getting back on
I'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home
And I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone
But hit ""re-dial"", you'll see that I just called
Some chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all and
Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected
Texted saying she wished she would have kept it
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
Man, I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is
I'm holding on by a thread
It's like I'm high right now, the guy right now
And you could tell by looking in my eyes right now
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now
'Cause we just having the time of our lives right now
[Chorus]
What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say ""You promised me you would never change""
""You promised me you would never change""

[Verse 3]
I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
The other day Lissa told me that she missed the old me
Which made me question when I went missing
And when I start treating my friends different
Maybe it was the fast paced switch up
Or the two guns in my face during the stick up
Maybe 'cause a girl I thought I trusted
Was who set the whole shit up
But in fact I haven't seen them since they locked Big Rich up
I know but same time I'm quick to forget
I'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh
'Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed
Did I just trade free time for camera time?
Will I blow all of this money baby, hammer time?
Yeah, I just need some closure
Ain't no turning back for me, I'm in it 'til it's over"
Up All Night,Drake,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Drake]

Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time
She ain't tryna pop that shit for pimp; okay, well nevermind
I-I-I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothin' nice
Bracelet saying ""you should quit"", cars saying ""fuck your life""
Okay now we outta here, toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up, I got the voodoo for you bitches (yeah)
I'm busy gettin' rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas, boy: stunt double
Fame is like a drug that I've taken too much of
But I never ever trip, just peace, happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does

Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww

Drizzy say get her, I'ma get her
I got the kind of money, make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda—wait, wait—fixate
Which bitch you know made a million off a mixtape?
That was just a keepsake, bought the president
The Louis presidential briefcase, never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks, I ain't talkin' about the Peach State
Man, for Pete's sake, scratch that—sweepstakes
(Ha ha ha ha ha) Fuck I look like, ho?
I look like ""yes"" and you like ""no""
I'm a bad bitch, I ain't never been a mixed breed
On a diet, but I'm doin' donuts in a 6-speed
M6 in front of M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on the menu
But I collect 100 thou' at the venue
And pop bottles with my team, Young Money 'til the death of me

Thank Me Now,Drake,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus]
You could thank me now, uh, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now
Yeah
Well, alright
Here I go

[Verse 1]
Uh, Mahalo from the hardest act to follow
Lately I've been drinking like there's a message in a bottle
Alohas to women with no ties to men
That I know well, that way there are no lies
You can thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas
I'm on the brink of ""influential,"" I'm here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas
I must have been hard to watch, what a year for you niggas
It's December 31st and we in Miami just meditating
You got your resolutions, we just got reservations
Living out a dream it feels like I stayed up
And we just want to party, Patron straight up
Fuck that old shit, I'm on new things
OVO Clique, Red Wing Boot Gang
Yeah we want it all, half was never the agreement
Who'd have thought the route we'd chosen
Would ever end up this scenic?
I can relate to kids going straight to the league
When they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
And that's around the time
That your idols become your rivals
You make friends with Mike
But got to A.I. him for your survival
Damn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous
Cause we want to be them, and they want to be us
So on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment
That you take for granted, y-you can thank me now
And oh my goodness you're welcome, you're welcome
At this point me is who I am trying to save myself from
Rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them
'Cause they think that I can help them
Get back to where they fell from
But drink up, 'cause everyone here is good tonight
Except the niggas that I came with, they good for life
Yeah, that's how you know it's going down
In case another chance never comes around
[Chorus]
Y-You could thank me now (Thank me now), go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now (You, you, you)

[Verse 2]
Uh, shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
I think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women
I think I'll have a chance at love and knowing me, I'll miss it
'Cause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic
Man, the good girls went silent on me
They got a boyfriend, or left for college on me
And all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now
That make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
But do I ever come up in discussion
Over double pump lattes and low fat muffins?
Do I? Or is missing what we had out of the question?
I'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroes
Who was there before it all, I guess that's how it goes
They hear about your cons, but focus on your pros
And love you for who you are from the bottom of they soul
But those same ones from your area will grow into women
That are ready to get married at ""Hello""
Because of what they allowed, where are they all now?
I know they're somewhere watching
So I'm trying to make them proud
Searching for the meaning, you'll find it next to me
They tell me I'm the hottest, guess we finally get to see
I'm feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree?
They say the doors will open up soon as you find the missing key
That's probably why I'm in this bitch shining
Jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded
And the bandwagon's full but you can try and run behind it–
I'm sorry
Poolside drinking, Margarita rounds
Shout out to my city though I hardly be in town
I'm the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown
And I know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down
I'm in a world where things are taken, never given
How long they choose to love you will never be your decision
And I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen
So while I'm still here in this position
[Chorus]
Y-you could thank me now (Thank me now), go 'head (Go 'head)
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said (What I said)
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now
It's a- okay (Okay)"

The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single, dawg, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?
Well if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' about
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out

Get it? Calm Batman, nah
Ain't nobody who's as bomb and as nuts
Lines are like Mom's CAT-scans
'Cause they fuckin' go bananas
Honey, I applaud that ass
Swear to God, man, these broads can't dance
Ma, show 'em how it's done
Spaz like a goddamn Taz, yeah
[Chorus: P!nk]
You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Girl, shake that ass like a donkey with Parkinson's
Make like Michael J. Fox is in your drawers
Playin' with an etch-a-sketch
Bet you that you'll never guess
Who's knockin' at your door, people hit the floors
Yeah, tonight, ladies, you gon' get divorced
Girl, forget remorse, I'ma hit you broads
With Chris's force like you pissed him off
Talented with the tongue, ma'fucker
You ain't got a lick in yours
Hittin' licks like I'm robbin' liquor stores
Makin' cash registers shit their drawers
Think you spit the rawest?
I'm an uncooked slab of beef layin' on your kitchen floor
Other words, I'm off the meat rack
Bring the beat back, bring in two extension cords
I'ma measure my dick—shit, I need six inches more
Fuck, my dick's big, bitch, need I remind you
That I don't need the fuckin' swine flu to be a sick pig?
You're addicted, I'm dope
I'm the longest needle around here—need a fix, ock?
I'm the big shot—get it, dick-snots?
You're just small pokes, little pricks
Girl, you think that other prick's hot?
I'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match
Before I sit back and let him get hotter
Better call the cops on him quick, fast
Shady's right back on your bitch-ass
White trash with a half a six-pack in his hatchback
Trailer hitch attached to the back, dispatch
[Chorus: P!nk]
You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Bitch, am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rappin'?
Does a bird chirp? Does Lil' Wayne slurp 'zurp
'Til he burps and smoke purp?
Does a word search get circles wrapped around it
Like you do when I come through?
I'd like you to remind yourself of what the fuck I can do
When I'm on the mic
Oh, you're the kind of girl that I could take a likin' to
Psych! I'm spikin' you like a football
Been this way since I stood a foot tall
You're a good catch with a shitty spouse
Got a pretty mouth and a good jaw
Give me good brain, watch the wood-grain
Don't want no cum stain—bitch, you listenin'?
Tryin' to turn me down, slut, I'm talkin' to you
Turn me back up! Are you insane?!
Tryin' to talk over me in the car
Shut the fuck up while my shit's playin'!
I'm a shit stain on the underwear of life
What's the saying? Where there's thunder, there is lightning
And they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
Then how the fuck have I been hit six times
In three different locations on four separate occasions?
And you can bet your stankin' ass
That I've come to smash everything in my path
Fork was in the road, took the psycho path
Poison Ivy wouldn't have me thinkin' rash
So hit the dance-floor, cutie, while I do my duty
On this microphone; shake your booty, shorty!
I'm the shit—why you think Proof used to call me ""Doody""?
[Chorus: P!nk]
You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no"
Mahogany,Eric B. & Rakim,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Me and Eric B was coolin’ at the Palladium
Seen a all-world cover girl, I said hey lady I’m
Sorry if you’re in a rush - don’t let me hold you up
Or intervene or interrupt, but
You got the look - I wanna get to know you better
I had to let her know - but yo, I didn’t sweat her
Cause if you would've seen what I was seein'
Almost looked Korean, but European
When she spoke, her accent was self-explanatory
Even her body language told the story
Her name was Mahogany - twin’s name was Ebony
I said my name is Ra and this is Eric B
Since the music was loud, I said let’s take a walk
So we could talk and see New York
Show time didn't start until one o’clock
But once I entered your mind I wouldn’t wanna stop
Caress your thoughts til we was thinking the same
Calm your nerves, massage your brain
Each moment's a mineral, poetry’s protein
Verse is a vitamin, effects like codeine
So tell me how you feel and I’ll reveal
A pill that’ll heal ya pain, ’cause I’m real
She musta OD’d ’cause she couldn’t resist
She spoke slowly when she told me this, she said
[Hook]
Over me, she’s goin’ crazy
She’ll rub me on my chest and call me Mr. Sexy
She said she’d have my kids and help me make my next G
Tell me I ain’t finessed mahogany

[Verse 2]
So I prescribed her, something to revive
And surprise her, she’s liver and much more wiser
From the light I shine when my brain cells spark
Constantly so she can glow in the dark
And soon, you can represent the moon
As long as I keep you in tune
I’ll tell you who you are and why you're here
Take it in stride ’cause it might take a year
It’s funny - how time flies when you're havin’ fun
We got close and it was almost one
She kissed me slow, but you know how far a kiss can go
Fuck around and miss the show
So I told her to hold that thought real tight
We can finish where we left off later on tonight
Back to the scene of the crime on time
As they introduced the fiend of a rhyme
She stood in the crowd with a birds-eye view of me
Thinking of later on of what she would do to me
The back of the room I could see her eyes - gloom
Patient, but hoping that the show was over soon
As the place was ripped in half, she made her way to the front row
So I said let’s go
I packed my mic as they screamed for an encore
The speakers were blown, plus my mic was sore
Besides I got places to go, ladies to see
And she could tell me how crazy she was over me
We drove off - she said she liked the way that I performed
And couldn’t wait to get 'soft and warm', I said
""I was watching you, watching me
Looks I received made it hard to MC""
I can take a hint, so I knew that she
Wanted my agony agony ag-on-y in her bod-y
Drove to some sights, then I took her to the condo
She was pipin’ hot, but I kept my calm so
She asked how come I don’t smile
I said, everything’s fine, but I’m in a New York state of mind
As we reached the kingdom, she said bring some
Champagne, she’ll entertain then sing some
Sentimental, songs real gentle
It hit the spot and you know where it went to
As we embraced I felt her heart pumpin’
I knew she was in the mood for somethin’
So I laid on my back and relaxed
It wasn’t the Perignon that made her collapse
[Hook]
Over me, she’s goin’ crazy
She’ll rub me on my chest and call me Mr. Sexy
She said she’d have my kids and help me make my next G
Tell me I ain’t finessed mahogany

I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shit (Yeah, yeah)
I wish I could (Me too)
Buy me a spaceship and fly (Swear I do)
Past the sky, oh
GLC feel you, baby—I feel you, man
I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky (Man, man, man...)
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
If my manager insults me again
I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up
Then, I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check—wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah, I stole—never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Asking me about some khakis
But let some Black people walk in
I bet you they show off their token blackie
Oh, now they love Kanye
""Let's put him all in the front of the store""
So I'm on break
Next to the ""No Smoking"" sign with a blunt in the mall
Taking my hits, writing my hits
Writing my rhymes, playing my mind
This fucking job can't help him
So I quit; y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love, dude
Lock yourself in a room
Doing five beats a day for three summers
That's A Different World like Cree Summer's
I deserve to do these numbers
""The kid that made that deserves that Maybach!""
So many records in my basement
I'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow!

I've been working this grave-shift

Past the sky
Tryna tell you, man, way past the sky
Oh, oh (Let's go, ugh)

[Verse 2: GLC]
And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob at the same time (Woo)
Thirsty on the grind, Chi state of mind
Lost my mama, lost my mind (Aww)
Life, my love, that's not mine
""Why you ain't signed?"" Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only wanna ball, never wanna fall (Ugh)
Gotta get mine, gotta take mine (Ugh)
Got a Tec-9, reach my prime (Ugh)
Gotta make these haters respect mine (Yeah)
In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule had said 9
Putting them pants on shelves
Waiting patiently; I ask myself
Where I wanna go, where I wanna be
Life is much more than running in the streets
Holler at 'Ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet, sounds so sweet
Yes, I'm the same ol' G
Same goatee, stayin' low-key, nope
Holler at God: ""Man, why'd you have to take my folks?""
Hope to see Freddie G., Yusef G, love my G
Rolly G, police watch me
Smoke my weed and count my Gs
Got a lot of people counting on me (That's right)
And I'm just tryin' to find my peace (That's right)
Should've finished school like my niece
Then I finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow!

I've been working this grave-shift
Aww, man, this pressure
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky, oh
I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3: Consequence]
I 'member having to take the dollar cab
Coming home real late at night
Standing on my feet all damn day
Tryna make this thing right
And havin' one of my coworkers say, ""Yo, you look just like
This kid I seen in an old Busta Rhymes video the other night""
Well, easy come, easy go, how that saying goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
That all had got snatched from me, A&Rs and they faculties
All turn their back on me and didn't wanna hear a rap from me
So naturally, actually, had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe, empty fridge is staring back at me
'Cause nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't wanna ever go back there
So I won't be taking no days off 'til my spaceship takes off, bow!

Buy me a spaceship and fly

She don't believe in shootin' stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's departments
You more like ""love to start shit""
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancin' so sleazy
I get a call like, ""Where are you, Yeezy?""
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
'Til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than a Nazi

I know it's been a while, sweetheart
We hardly talk, I was doin' my thang
I know I was foul, baby
Ayy, babe, lately, you've been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
Frontin', though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago
It'll go get this difficult
Feelin' like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no Visa
First class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just sayin', hey, Mona Lisa
Come home, you know you can't roam without Caesar

""Life,"" by Marshall Mathers
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle in front of your optical to slow you down
And every time you think you've gotten past it
It's gonna come back around to tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they really your enemies with secret identities
And disguises to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
They wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'
What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
Swearin' that they was always down
What is life? I'm tired of life

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of backstabbin'-ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committin' so many sins
Tired of always givin' in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never havin' any ends
Tired of havin' skinny friends, hooked on crack and Mini Thins
I'm tired of this DJ playin' your shit when he spins
Tired of not havin' a deal
Tired of havin' to deal with the bullshit without grabbin' the steel
Tired of drownin' in my sorrow
Tired of havin' to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers sprayin' shit and dartin' off
I'm tired of jobs startin' off
At $5.50 an hour, then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off
I'm tired of bein' fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of havin' to work as a gas station clerk
For this jerk, breathin' down my neck, drivin' me berserk
I'm tired of usin' plastic silverware
Tired of workin' at Builder's Square
Tired of not bein' a millionaire
[Chorus]
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on
While I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks, it wouldn't be enough
Because I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks
If I had one wish, I would ask
For a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of bein' white trash, broke and always poor
Tired of takin' pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not havin' a phone
Tired of not havin' a home to have one in if I did have one on
Tired of not drivin' a BM
Tired of not workin' at GM, tired of wantin' to be him
Tired of not sleepin' without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performin' in a packed coliseum
Tired of not bein' on tour
Tired of fuckin' the same blonde whore
After work, in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of fakin' knots with a stack of ones
Havin' a lack of funds and resortin' back to guns
Tired of bein' stared at
Tired of wearin' the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of steppin' in clubs, wearin' the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people sayin' they're tired of hearin' me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
Sayin' they wasn't feelin' me on ""Nobody's As Ill As Me""
And I'm tired of radio stations tellin' fibs
Tired of JLB sayin', ""Where hip-hop lives""

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on
While I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks, it wouldn't be enough
Because I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks
If I had one wish, I would ask
For a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

[Outro]
You know what I'm sayin'?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit, tellin' me to be positive
How am I 'posed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
You know what I'm sayin'?
I rap about shit around me, shit I see
You know what I'm sayin'?
Right now, I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player-hatin' that's goin' on in my own city
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'?
But hey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm just fed up, that's my word"

I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go berserker than a fed-up post office worker
I murk her with a Mossberg, I'm pissed off, get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter, squirted a frankfurter
For a gangster, you sure did shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving like a terrible towel
How thangs turn around when his fangs come out
Get your brains blown out, that's what I call blowin' your mind
When I come back, like nut on your spine
I'm a thumb tack that you slept on, son
Now here I come, screaming ""Attack!"" like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem 'til he showed 'em defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit, his britches, he outgrowed 'em
He's so out cold, he's knocked out at the South Pole
And nobody fucks with him, rigor mortis and post mortem
He's dyin' of boredom
Take your best rhymes, record 'em, then try to thwart him
He'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
Shit-stained drawers, you gon' fuck with a guy
Who licks the blades of his chainsaws
While he dips 'em in P.F. Chang's sauce?
Game's up, homie, hang it up like some crank calls
You think I'm backin' down?

I'm back for revenge, I lost a battle, that ain't happenin' again

Metaphors wrote on my hand, some are just stored in my memory
Some I wrote on a napkin; I do what I have to to win
Pullin' out all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers?
And tell that psycho to pass the torch to the wacko
'Fore I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern and smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick! 'Dick''s too short of a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick!
Don't call me the Champ, call me the Space Shuttle Destroyer

No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now there he goes in Dre's studio, cuppin' his balls
Screamin' the wood off the panelin', cussin' the paint off the walls
Spewin' his hate to these haters, showin' no love for these broads
He ain't givin' them shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard
He'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark
With the scars, 'til Abraham Lincoln is screamin' out, ""Ahh!""
These metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked
Instead of suckin' him off
They can go get a belt or a neck tie to hang themselves by
Like David Carradine, they can go fuck themselves and just die
And eat shit while they at it, he's fuckin' had it
He's mad at the whole world
So go to hell and build a snowman, girl
The bullies become bullied, and pussies get pushed
Then they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me
'Cause I ain't lookin' back, only forward, this whole spot blowin'
Who coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it?
And while I'm bein' poetic, let me get it stoic and raise the bar
Higher than my opinion of these women's been lowered
So bear witness to some biblical shit, there's a cold wind blowin'
This world ain't gonna know what hit it
He did it, he made it, he's finally famous"

A lot of people ask me
Where the fuck I've been at the last few years
Shit, I don't know
But I do know I'm back now
Haha

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground

[Verse 1]
Dre, I'm down here, under the ground, dig me up!
Broken tibias, fibias, yeah, fix me up
Sixty sluts, all of them dyin' from asphyxia
After they sip piss through a Christopher Reeves sippy cup
Dixie cups, toxins, boxes of Oxy pads
Enough Oxycontin to send a fuckin' ox to rehab
Wack job in the back in a black stocking cap
Jackin' off to a hockey mask at a boxing match
(He can't say that!) Yes, he can
I just did, faggot, now guess again
Better text message your next-of-kin
Tell 'em shit's about to get extra messy
Especially when I flex again
And throw a fuckin' lesbian in wet cement
Faggoty, faggoty, faggoty! Raggedy Ann and Andy
No! Raggedy Andy and Andy
No, it can't be, it can't be—yes, it can be
The fuckin' Anti-Christ is back, Dante
It's Satan in black satin panties
This is Amityville, calamity, goddamn it
Insanity, pills, fanny pack filled with Xannies
Through every nook and cranny, lookin' for trannies
Milk and cookies spilled on my silk négligée, looky
Razor-ba-lades with me to make you ba-leed
Cases of Maybelline makeup lay on a table of weed
Slim Shady? Shit sounds like a fable to me
'Til he jumps out of the fuckin' toilet when you're takin' a pee
[Chorus]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground

[Verse 2]
Six semen samples, seventeen strands of hair
Found in the back of a van after the shoot with Vanity Fair
Hannah Montana, prepare to elope with a can opener
And be cut open like cantaloupe on canopy beds
And Glad bags, yeah glad to be back
'Cause last year was a tragedy that landed me smack-dab in rehab
Fuckin' doctor, I ain't understand a damn word he said
I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch
Two weeks in Brighton, I ain't enlightened
Bitin' into a fuckin' Vicodin like I'm a Viking
Oh, lightning is strikin', it might be a fuckin' sign I need a psychic
Evaluation, fuck Jason, it's Friday the 19th
That means it's just a regular day (Hah!)
And this is the kind of shit I think of regularly
Fuckin' lesbian shouldn't have had her legs in the way
Now she's pregnant and gay, missin' both legs and beggin' to stay
[Chorus]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground

[Verse 3]
Tell the critics I'm back and I'm comin' to spit it back in abundance
Hit a fag with onions, then split a bag of Funyuns
Mad at me? Understandable, cannibal, shoot an animal
Out of a cannon and have 'em catapult at an adult
Captain of a cult with an elite following
To turn Halloween back into a trick-or-treat holiday
Have Michael Myers lookin' like a liar, swipe his powers
Replace his knife with flowers and a stack of fliers
Hit Jason Vorhees with a 40; stuck a suppository
Up his ass, and made him tell me a story
Gave Hannibal Lector a fuckin' nectarine
And sat him in the fuckin' fruit and vegetable section
And gave him a lecture
Walked up Elm Street with a fuckin' Wiffle bat drew
Fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissorhands too
And came out with a little scratch, ooh
Lookin' like I got in a fuckin' pillow fight with a Triple F.A.T. goose
Insanity, can it be vanity?
Where's the humanity in having a twisted fantasy
With an arm-and-leg amputee?
Straitjacket with a hundred and eight brackets
And a strap that wraps twice around my back
Then they latch it; cut your fuckin' head off
And ask where you're headed off to
Get it? ""Headed off to?"" Medic, this headache's awful!
This anesthetic's pathetic, so is this diabetic waffle
And this prosthetic arm keeps crushin' my hard taco
[Chorus]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground

[Outro]
So, it wasn't a choice, it was ""I had to do this""
And now I got 90 days clean
And uh, that's all I have to share, thanks
(Thanks for sharing, Brian
Is there anyone else who'd like to share this evening?)
Yeah, I got something to share:
""When you walked through the door you were queer to me
So come here, baby boy, just come here to me
You're a cock-boy, everybody wants you
You're gayer than you would ever claim to
I won't have to rape you
So, homie, lay down, down, down
Lay down, down, down
Lay down, down, down, lay down, lay down""
Where's everybody going?
This always went over real big in Gay-A
Okay, wait, I got another one
""I just love condoms and lots of cum""
No? Well, shit!"
Live from 504,Lil Wayne,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Dro, fuck with me! (C Gutta!) Yeah

[Verse]
Live from the 504
It's Mr. Crazy Flow, jumping like a bungee, no rope
Even in the dungeon, I glow; even if it ain't sunny, I glow
If it ain't about money, I go... nowhere—I'm nailed to the floor
Money controls where I go, it is the sail to my boat
And it's going down, it's going down, like there's a whale in the boat
See, you can smell that I smoke, and yep, I sip that lean
You hit me with that combination, it make my eyes bleed
I'm a shark in the water, yep, I swim with the big
So I don't have time to deal with Willie the Squid
L-L-Lilypad niggas, L-L-Look at the monster
Y-Y-You don't want to crash, like ""La-La-La Bamba""
See it's me, Ronnie, and Terry; and my new drop is berry
Watermelon, plum; just call it ""fruit punch""
I'm an old rapper getting new bucks
And all you new rappers, you just new lunch (New lunch)
Flow sick, so sick, need a doc, yes
A creature, monster, like the Loch Ness
I gets hotter by the tock, before I sizzle to death
I just tell the clock, ""Gimme a sec""
In the middle of the war—where my enemy at?
I'm running this bitch, like Eric Bieniemy back
'Cause e'ery time I hit a track, I'm like an energy pack
The instruments are crying out, ""Where the sympathy at?""
Yeah, if you betting money, baby, him'll be back
Whatever legends look like, bitch, I'm finna be that
I walked right in hip-hop, like, ""Where my dinner be at?""
I ate that, and I was like, ""Where my dinner be at?""
I hate that women lie, so I lie to them back
Got two bitches in my pants—quiet? Neither them that
A lot of bitches want dick, I give a lot of them that
Let's do a pill, I can fuck you for an hour with that
And to the kids, drugs kill—I'm acknowledging that
But when I'm on a drug, I don't have a problem with that
And my niggas got guns the size of toddlers, biatch
And we aiming right at your fucking collar, biatch—pow!"
Seat Down Low,Lil Wayne,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Yeah
It's me and T, man
T.I.
Dot-com, bitch! Hahaha!
T.I.P., fuck with your boy
Ayy, that is my brothers, ladies and gentlemen
T.I.—and he is the king, bitch
Don't get that shit twisted
And me? I am the best rapper alive—ladies and gentlemen, hello!
This is Da Drought 3
And it's been a minute since I've rapped on a Mannie Fresh beat, but, uh...
I guess I'll go 'head on and show these niggas what to do with one of your beats, man
Listen

[Verse]
I like my seat down low and my window slightly cracked
Riding with a bad ho with her girlfriend in the back
I like to get real high, and I never look back
And you don't wanna try, man—don't I look strapped?
I come from the hardest city, ain't nobody fucking with it
Got a black-and-gold soul, with a fresh New Orleans fitted
And a collar Polo and a pair of Bally Bucks
Young Money, motherfucker, know you worried 'bout us
Cash Money, motherfucker, CMR, I trust
Never had my jaw broken, but his jaw, I bust
And I probably got your girlfriend on my bus
What happens on my bus stays on my bus
And that white widow weed out the jar is a must
If you give me a cigar, then a cigar, I'll bust
Put that white widow weed in the cigar and puff
Look ma, I'm tryna make a porno, starring us
Well, not just us—a couple foreign sluts
Yeah, we could make this a ménage à trois-ing, darling
I be with Jim Jones, and we be balling—balling?
Yeah, baby, we balling, like Rawlings and Spalding
Pint of DJ Screw and that Hawaiian, I am—
Leaning like a three-legged lion, climbing—
Right to the top of the motherfucking mountain, counting
I'm gonna need me and a accountant to count it
Mannie got this fucking beat pounding—it's pounding
But it was just lost until I found it—I found it
Stole it like a scoundrel, Hollygrove hound it
Put this bitch to sleep—fucking right—I nightgowned it
Niggas talkin cheap; tell them niggas, ""Pipe down, bitch!""
Bloods in the building, and now, everybody soundless
Beating up this track like a motherfucking round-fist
Blind, deaf, or crazy, I'ma spit, like a long kiss
I am just a Martian, ain't nobody else on this—
Planet, I know; see, I live by my only
Say, where my cheese, nigga? Where my macaroni?
Baby, I get up in that ass and act a donkey
Candy on candy, nigga, gripping the grain
See, I am the only fire that can live in the rain
I am so, so New Orleans
Like 18-25-TULANE!
[Outro]
Hahaha.... See, you gotta be from New Orleans to know what the fuck I'm talkin bout
And if you don't, fuck you
Hahaha
I say what I want
And I don't want nothing
'Cause I got everything, bitch"

Young Money!
You dig?
Mack, I'm going in

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
'Cause I don't write shit ;cause I ain't got time
'Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-ch-ch-ch-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father, motherfuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancing on the bridge, pussy popping
Tell the coppers, ""Hahahaha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him""
I go by them goon rules
If you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em 'cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

Yeah, motherfucker I'm ill

[Verse 2: Cory Gunz]
I'm illy in here with them Young Money millionaires
Think you really pop a wheelie in air?
Mac Milli, the Vanilli's in here
I'm a rascal, don't get whopped
I get brats who don't give top
I get tassel, pass you with a flow you could never put a brake on
And I break on anything a nigga take on
Feel the napalm from my trey arm, straight long
Throw a nigga like I'm Akon, cause I'm acorns
Where the base gone? get the base blown
Let the Pistons on that chopper
Come on, cops, I'm kamikaze, drop a rock with them Obamas
Illie in the mind, really with the nine, millie when I rhyme
Silly anytime fine, chilly, gitty on the grind
Shitty on a dime, Penny on the line
Plenty's in me, any guineas with 'em
Bigger than a mini, and remind I'm
Illy, and it's all off G.P.s and a PG walk by, beep-beep
Need a freak, skeet, hawk out, big feet on a jeep
She caught by Weezy F
We be the best, truly to death, prove me the rest
Groupies confess, you be the ref, excuse me, I left
Haha!
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
A millionaire, I'm a young money millionaire
What, 'chyall really want it? Nah, y'all don't really wanna do it
If hip hop is dead, I am the embalming fluid
And I don't care who it be, I'm steppin' to it
Notice I say 'it', cause to me, it ain't shit
Get, it?
Call me whatcha like, trick, call me on my Sidekick
Never answer when it's private, man, I hate a shy chick
Don't you hate a shy chick? I had a plate of shy chick
And she ain't shy no mo', she changed her name to ""My chick""
Yeah, boy, that's my girl
And she pops excellent up in Wayne's world
Totally, dude
You should see their faces when they see that this robot can move

A millionaire, I'm a
Young Money, Cash Money, fast money
Slow money, mo' money, never no money
What is that, who is that? I never heard of it
I will take your picture and make a ""Rest In Peace"" shirt of it
Some should take this beat and make a ""Rest In Peace"" shirt of it
Because I killed it, now, don't tell no one you heard of me
It's like the beat was screamin', ""Murder me!""
And I'm a murderer, so I murdered it
And you niggas is what I'm eating, I'll make sure of it
And he who don't believe me, I'll make dessert of him
Sherbet him, I mean, shame on him, or her; Carter, father of
This rap thing, this is my race
Go on, take a lap, man, Weezy Baby's nursery
Now, gon' take a nap, man, it's naptime

My name ain't Bic, but I keep dat flame, man
Who dat wanna do dat, boy? You knew dat, you dat swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't O-U like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
Haha, and I'd rather be pushing flowers
Than to be in the pen sharing showers
See, Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden, and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawnmower
Boy, I got so many bitches like I'm Mike Lowry
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Man, life just ain't life without me
Hip-hop just ain't hip-hop without me

Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
My music's so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Grindin' to see if they can see me lean
I'm tint, so it ain't easy to be seen
Police see me ride by, they can see me gleam
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
I'm ridin' with a new chick, she like, ""Hold up!""
Next to the PlayStation controller
It's a full clip in my pistola
Send a jacker into a coma (Woo!)
Girl, you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryna bone, ain't tryna have no babies
Ride clean as hell so I pull in ladies
Law's on patrol and you know they hate me
Music turned all the way up into the maximum
I got speakers, some niggas tryna jack for some
But we packin' somethin' and what we have for 'em
We'll have a nigga locked up in the maximum
Security cell, I'm grippin' oak (Oak)
Music loud and I'm tippin' slow (Slow)
Twin's steady twistin' like, ""Hit this though!""
Police pull up right behind and it's in his throat
The windows down, got to stop pollution
CD change, niggas like, ""Who is that producin'?""
That's the Play-N-Skillz when we out and cruisin'
Got warrants in every city except Houston but I still ain't losin'

I've been drinkin' and smokin'
Holy shit, cause I really can't focus
I gotta get it home 'fore the po-po's scope this
Big old Excurs' just swervin', all up in the curb and
Nigga be sippin' on the Hennessy and the gin again
It's in again, we in the wind
Doin' a hundred while I puff on a blunt and roll another one up
We livin' like we ain't givin' a fuck
I got a blunt up in my right hand
40-ounce in my lap freezin' my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all
Comin' pretty deep, me and my dawgs
Yo, I gotta hit the back streets
Wonderin' 'bout the six pounds and I got heat
Glock, Glock shots to the block, we creep-creep
Pop-pop, hope cops don't see me, on the lowkey
With no regard for the law
We dodge 'em like, ""Fuck 'em all""
But I won't get caught up and brought up
On charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car, and a blunt to spark
Roll it up if you want, and get it poppin', dawg
Ready or not, we bust shots off in the air

Now would you think it's so? I tried to let you go
Turn on my blinker light and then I swang it slow
And they upset for sho', 'cause they think they know
That they catchin' me with plenty of the drank and dro
So they get behind me, tryna check my tags
Look in my rearview and they smilin'
Thinkin' they'll catch me in the wrong, they keep tryin'
Keep steady denyin' that it's racial profilin'
Houston, Texas, you can check my tags (Tags)
Pull me over, try to check my slab (Slab)
The glove compartment, gotta get my cash
Cause the crooked cops'll try to come up fast
And bein' the baller that I am, I talk to them
Givin' a damn about them not feelin' my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood
I'ma laugh at you and then I'll have to cruise
Jammin' number two on some old DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
This is a message to the law, tell 'em, ""We hate you""
I can't be touched and tell 'em that they shoulda known
Tippin' down, I'm sittin' crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone, findin' a chick I wanna bone
Like they couldn't stop me, I'm 'bout to pull up at your home
And it's on

Ahem, back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand?
How does it feel? Is it fantastic? Is it grand?
Well, look at all the massive masses in the stands
""Shady, man, no, don't massacre the fans!""
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him, just ‘cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it, then squish it, then pass it to a friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can?
Yes, he can-can; don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But, Lindsay, please come back to seeing men
Samantha's a two; you're practically a ten
I know you want me, girl, in fact, I see you grin

Have that I don't? Are you telling me tenderness?
Well, I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner, then
Nail her, baby, say hello to my little friend!
Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut off the middleman
Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl, pay them little attention
And little did I mention that Jennifer's in
Love with me, John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Man, I swear them other guys, you give 'em an inch
They take a mile; they got style, but it isn't Slim

Jessica Alba put her breasts on my mouth (Blup!)
Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis

Looking like someone shrinked his outfit!""

Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya
Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter of fact, bake me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it to make my jailbreak

And there I was, a young nigga with heart, ain't had shit to lose
Pullin' my pistol on them fools, you know the rules
D-R-E, you got me heated; my words like a penitentiary dick
Hittin' bitches where it's most needed
Money and weed, Alizé and Hennessy
To my thug niggas in lock down: witness me
Bail on these hoes in floss-mode
The life of a boss player, fuck what you thought though
My enemies deceased
Die like a bitch when my album hit the streets; niggas can't see me!

[Chorus: George Clinton & 2Pac]
Niggas can't see me
They can't see me
Which way did he go, George?
Which way did he go?
Oh!! Which way did he go?
Which way did he go?
[Verse 3: 2Pac]
You niggas made a mistake
You should've never put my rhymes with Dre
Them thug niggas have arrived and it's judgement day
Hey homie, if you feel me
Tell them tricks that shot me that they missed, they ain't kill me
I can make a motherfucker shake, rattle and roll
I'm full of liquor, thug nigga, quick to jab at them hoes
And I can make you jealous niggas famous
Fuck around with 2Pac and see how good a nigga's aim is
I'm just a rich motherfucker from the way
If this rappin' bring me money, then I'm rappin' till I'm paid
I'm gettin' green like I'm supposed to
Nigga, I holla at these hoes and see how many I can go through
Look to the star and visualize my debut
Niggas know me, player, I gotta stay true
Don't be a dumb motherfucker 'cause it's crazy after dark
Where the true thug-niggas see your heart; niggas can't see me!

[Interlude: 2Pac]
Yo, check this out: stay off his dick

[Outro: George Clinton & 2Pac]
Niggas can't see me
Right before your eyes, I'll disappear from here
You niggas can't see me
You can't see me
I know it's hard nigga, I'm all up in your face
But you still can't see me
You can't see me
All up in your range, but niggas can't see me
20/20 vision won't visualize
I'm in the flesh, baby, but you can't see me
All those glasses won't help you realize
You blinded, you blinded, you can't see me
You can't see me
Thug Life, baby
Don't believe everything you read!
Alizé and weed
You can't see me, right before your very eyes
You won't even visualize, you can't see me
Dr. Dre all day, 2Pac
Niggas can't see me
I dedicate this to you punk motherfuckers!
This one's for you, BIG baby
'Cause you bitch-ass niggas can't see me
Niggas can't see me
You can't see me

See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil
You won't see me
Yeah, first you see me, now you don't
Wanna see me, but you won't
Come to see me, but you can't
Oh, you can't see me
You can't see me
Right between your eyes and you'll never realize
Right before your eyes, you won't even realize
Visualize what you can't see"
Beautiful,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Paul Rodgers]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you tryin' to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
I'm reaching out for you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm just so fucking depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down then I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt
To vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that
I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles—
[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus: Eminem]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
Of the room, just as soon as
I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
For conversation like I want that
I'm not lookin' for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant
Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, ""Ha!
Marshall, you're so funny, man
You should be a comedian, goddamn!""
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles—
[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus: Eminem]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now, I could've either just sat
On my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in
In every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant actin' stupid
Aunt Edna always told me:
""Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that.""
Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen
Stop sign pole at eight-years-old
I learned my lesson then, 'cause I wasn't
Tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
It's probably a 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a
Mile in each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet—
[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus: Eminem]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so

[Bridge: Paul Rodgers, Eminem]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own (Oh)
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone (So)
Are you calling me?
Are you tryin'g to get through? (Oh)
Are you reaching out for me?
I'm reaching out for you (So)

[Outro: Eminem]
Yeah
To my babies:
Stay strong
Your Dad'll be home soon
And to the rest of the world:
God gave you shoes
To fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em
Be yourself, man
Be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny
Don't never let no one tell you
You ain't beautiful (So-oh-oh-oh-oh)"

Man! Let's go
Hey yo, Fif'!
Yeah?
Call 'em and tell 'em...
It's time to hate us again
We're back!
Haha!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
My enemies crack corn, but I don't care
You can be Black, white, or albino, yeah
You can have cornrows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head (*Crash*)
A little bit psycho, but I know that
Think you just don't say it and I won't say it
See, if you don't brag, then I don't brag
I know I'm bad as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need ya'll to co-sign no shit
You can just keep makin' them tired old threats
A little bit like ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf,"" yeah
See me, but don't dare to try no shit
'Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers
The rattlesnake's right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quiet and strike so fast
Like lightening bolts, right out the sky, go bad
From out of nowhere, you might just find your career
Come to it, (Eek!) and I'm just like (Oh, yeah!)
[Chorus: Eminem]
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh, yeah!)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
So Jimmy's can crack corn, but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh, yeah!)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em!)
And where is D12 at, they're like (We over here!)
And where the fuck we goin', we're like (Nowhere!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You jealous little fucks beg for my attention, but
I done told you once, I'm not the kind of attention you want
If I tell you twice, then I won't be so nice
If you keep coming back, that only means you know you lost the fight
They wanna talk shit, let 'em talk shit, 'cause they talk shit (Yeah)
Knowin' deep down, they really just wanna squash it
'Cause no one wants to walk around, steppin' in dog shit
And get doo-doo on the shoe again, soon as they washed it
But the pride won't let 'em, inside's like ""Go get 'em""
And I'm just like ""Why you're tryin' to fight momentum?""
We just keep winnin', by landslides, oh, and um
Shady Limited's, in any size yo' denim
To velour, even our clothing line's on fire
As 50 would say ""Our clothing line's on Fiyaa''
Meanwhile, your minds on us, like mine's on Mariah
And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars
But I'll just keep fucking you like I fucked her
Right in the ass with K-Y, yes, sir!
So full of joy, boy, am I absurd?
Even Chingy would tell you: ""That boy don't curr""
[Chorus: Eminem]
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh, yeah!)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
So Jimmy's can crack corn, but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh, yeah!)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em!)
And where is G-Unit at, they're like (We over here!)
And where the fuck we goin', we're like (Nowhere!)

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Your homie got clapped on, man, I don't care
The cops in my nana crib, but I'm not there
It is what it is, dawg, man, life's not fair
Your friends should've known not to front 'round here
Listen, kid, where I'm from,  the wolves smell fear
They'll strip your ass of your jewels right here
Man, I'ma say this one time, now get this clear
Man, you can catch a hot one like outta nowhere
A beautiful day without drama is rare
Your girl's a freak, man, sometimes we share
Yeah, I wear a condom and you go bare
You probably heard about me, I'm a sho nuff player
In the hood politicin', like I'm runnin' for mayor
Ridin', winin', dinin' and shinin', know what I'm sayin'?
I ain't got time for fuckin' around, and horseplayin'
I'm makin' hits, my homies takin' hits, who's stayin'
[Chorus: Eminem]
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh, yeah!)

Looked at the clock and it say, ""Right now""
Get a pound, break it down, blow it like trial
Panatela Dutchie, wine in my tall glass
Young Money, baby, big shit, like a horse ass
Stacks in my backpack, shades on, hat back
Bugatti, matte black—""Where they do that at?""
South Beach Miami, ho, I'm probably with Tammy To'
My life is a video and the women want they cameo
I just want them pantyhose, and I’m higher than Ger-an-imo
And I got them tools, tell them boys it could get mechanical
Now, pop that pussy like a four-four
I turn you 'round and bend you over like a low blow
It’s Young Money, baby, we the fucking greatest
We done put them other niggas on a hiatus
Beat your bitch with the pump if she deny data
'Cause I’ll serve anyone like a blind waiter
I make my girl cum first; then, I arrive later
I shake you pussies up, I'm a vibrator, haha!

This shit so good, it don’t even smell bad
And you can tell Dad that I’m a motherfucker
You niggas bet' not slip—Ice Road Truckers

Loyal to the game, the game been good to me
Still spitting fire, you niggas wood to me, ha!
We on, nigga; let—let them hoes know
Young Money lay 'em down like old folks
You coming with it? We coming for it
Plenty to go around—now, watch the money orbit
Real shit, people; now, just absorb it
I tried to pay attention, but y'all mad boring
And I got so much swag, I need an ad for it
And I don’t like to brag, so my bitches brag for me
Oh, she a good girl? I got her transforming
She give me hot head, I call it ""global warming""
If we gon' do it, dog, let's do it now
I—I—I am more animal than the zoo allow
Put me in the wild, I’ll be there for a while
You niggas Little League, call 'em Curaçao
Energizer money: it keep going
I’m laid up, I’m free-throwing
Who rebounding? Who gives a shit?
Fuck that, I got 27 years of this
Hit or miss, I hit your missus
You are local news; I’m 60 Minutes
I—I hit the target, I hit the witness
I work out in my office—guess I’m fit for business
Too many visions, completed missions
Still icing out crosses—keep it Christian
We consistent, the streets commend it
Weezy F. Baby, the ""F"" is for ""Forensics""
From start to finish, Usain Wayne
OK, you doing your thing? Well, things change
You plain-Jane, I’m diverse
I save the world second, and I get high first
I’m a mind freak, check my time sheet
Bitch, I bring the noise where the lions sleep
Your flow never wet, like Grandma pussy
I’m always good, like Grandma cookies
Yeah, call me the spleen or the spine fixer
It's going down like the Catalina Wine Mixer
She going down like the hands on my time-ticker
I’m always strapped—Vietnam, nigga
We are fine, nigga, like Amber Rose
We ball, nigga, like Jalen Rose

Nissan, Honda, Chevy, the D's will never get me

In my hoopty I be swerving, the public's who I'm serving
Boost phone forever chirping, I be out there putting work in
Know them dirty boys lurking, if they nab me then it's curtains
So when I go see a person, I spin the block so I'm certain
That it's cool, I'm no fool, see Raul is more than reckless
So I meet him when it's busy at that Meeker/Morgan exit
Off that BQE near Mickey D's
And occasionally treat myself to a nice little fish and cheese
I'm really, really in the street. Being broke's my enemy
Teachers said I'm dumb but I dropped out and I know chemistry
I make that soft get hard and meet my homey Pito
In the parking lot of Home Depot off Northern Boulevard
I got my route down pat, I'm about my stacks
And my mouth don't chat, I let my Pow Pow clap
But I ain't with that though -- I'm trying to get that dough
Beamer, Benz or Bentley - oh no - I stay low in that:

[Verse 2 - Jim Jones]
I remember gettin' souped when I first had the Ac
It was the '9-7 coupe, I didn't know how to act
When Juju did the stash, the body shop on Jerome Seven Fourth
Way before the Boost I had the flip mobile phone
Before that it was the beeper, had one street-sweeper
We all cut class so we hardly knew the teacher
When The Rink was really hot, rockin' minks was really hot
We was on the car waggers wasn't thinking about a drop
Now I scoop you in the Charger, drop you off in the 'ghini
Let you out on the corner right before your boyfriend see me
Keep a low vehicle when I'm low speedin' through
And I'm scoopin' up your ho, they don't notice that it's you
Used to watch my uncle do it, scoop 'em up in the Buick
One chick Dolores turned fiend, she was gorgeous
Speakin' about cars, I think we still got a Taurus

Homecoming,Kanye West,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Kanye West]
Yeah
And you say Chi city!
Chi city! Chi city!

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Kanye West]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then? (Yeah)
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again (Ow!)
-Min' home again

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, ""Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees.""
And from that point, I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to toe 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, ""It felt like they walked and drove on me.""
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, ""'Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me!""
[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you,"" and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do: just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-Town
[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

""Resurrection""

[Intro]
Yeah I'ma get this one off for 87th Street
South Side of Chicago, Chicago everywhere, check it
It's like come on, y'all, get live, get down
Common Sense is in your town
I said come on, y'all, get live, get down
Common Sense is in your town

[Verse 1]
I stagger in the gatherin', possessed by a patter-in that be scatterin'
Over the global, my vocals be travelin', unravelin' my abdomen
It's slime that's babblin' grammatics that are masculine
I grab the men, verbally badgering broads
I wish that Madelyne was back on Video LP
I went against all odds and got a even steven
Proceed to read and not believin' everything I'm readin'
But my brain was bleedin', needin' feedin', and exercise
I didn't seek the best of buys, it's a lie to textualize
I analyze where I rest my eyes
And chastise the best of guys with punchlines
I'm Nestle when it's crunch-time
For your mind like one time
If poetry was pussy I'd be sunshine
'Cause I deliver like the Sun-Times
Confined in once-mines on dumb rhymes I combine
I'm hype like I'm unsigned, my diet I un-swine
Eating beef sometimes -- I try to cut back on that shit
This rap shit is truly outta control
My style is too developed to be arrested
It's the freestyle, so now it's out on parole
They tried to hold my soul in a holding cell so I would sell
I bonded with a break and had enough to make bail
A Mr. Meaner fell on his knee for the jury
I asked No for his ID and the judge thought there was two of me
Motion for a recess to retest my fingerprints
They relinquished Sense, 'cause I was guilty in a sense
[Scratched Hook]
""Resurrection""

[Verse 2]
I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike when in dim light
I use insight to enlight devices hit the skin tight
Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe, imagination's in flight
I send light, like Ben's kite, I've been bright
Get open like on gym nights and in fights I send rights
Don't hook with skins my friends like, I spend nights up in dykes
In spite, I've been indicted as a freak of all trades
(Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo) I got it made
I bathe in bass lines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums
Come from a tribe of bums hooked on Negro and mums
Had to halt with the, malt liquor
'Cause off the malt liquor, I fought niggas
Now my speech and thoughts quicker
Cruise the Southside streets with no heat and no sticker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
UAC got my back and we don't, now check it
I'm a ho but not a ho nigga, ain't scared of no nigga
When it's my turn to go, I gotta go
And I'm gone with the storm

That I actually do in real life or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody
That I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
Well, shit, if you believe that, then I'll kill you
You know why? 'Cause I'm a criminal!
Criminal! You're goddamn right
I'm a criminal! Yeah, I'm a criminal!

[Verse 1]
My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or lez
Or a homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress, hate fags? The answer's yes
Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Starin' at my jeans, watchin' my genitals bulgin' (Ooh!)
That's my motherfuckin' balls, you'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of 'em!
""Hey, it's me, Versace! Whoops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checkin' the mail, get it? Checkin' the male?""
How many records you expectin' to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
Come on, relax, guy! I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an amen! (A-men!)
""Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital""
Preacher, preacher! Fifth grade teacher!
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing 'cause
I watch TV and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from toppin' these charts
And you can't stop me from droppin' each March
With a brand new CD for these fuckin' retards (Duh)
And to think, it's just little ol' me
Mr. Don't-Give-a-Fuck still won't leave
[Chorus]
I'm a criminal!
'Cause every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal!
I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

[Verse 2]
The mother did drugs, hard liquor, cigarettes and speed
The baby came out, disfigured ligaments, indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby, 'cause that baby was me
I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
I drank more liquor to fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin' the word—
My morals went *thhbbpp* when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk off of his own employee
Now, don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
You can't miss me: I'm white, blonde-haired, and my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs as long as it ain't happenin' to him
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Em-
-inem and Kim combined (The maniac's in)
In place of the Doctor 'cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin' his place (Mm-mm-mmm!)
Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you, Dre, you should've kept that thang put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?

Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it (Go, go, go!)
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it and if anybody identifies
The guy in it, I hide for five minutes
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad, so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'ma be a fuckin' rapist in a Jason mask

We came to rock it on to the tip-top
And Hi-Tek make the beat drop, Y-O

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
Redefinition, turnin' your play into a tragedy
Exhibit level degree on the mic, passionately
Niggas is sweet, so I bet if I bit, I'd get a cavity
Livin' to get high, you ain't flyer than gravity
We die hard like the battery
Thrown in the back of me by the mad MC
Who think imitation is the highest form of flattery
Actually, don't be mad at me, I had to be the one to break it to you
You get kicked into obscurity like judo — no, Menudo
'Cause you pseudo, tryin' to compete with reality like Xerox
Towards destruction, you spiralin' like helix, wipe them teardrops
Chasin' stars in your eyes, playin' games with your lives
Now the wives is widows, soakin' up pillows, weepin' like willows
Still more blacks is dyin', 'cause they live and they tryin'
""How to Make a Slave"" by Willie Lynch is still applyin'
Regardless, Mos is one of my closest partners
Rockin' ever since before Prince was called The Artist
Rockin' before Funkmaster Flex was rockin' Starter
When 'Pac and Biggie was still cool, before they was martyrs
Life or death, if I'm choosin', with every breath I'm enhancin'
Stop, there comes a time when you can't run

What?
Lyrically handsome, call collect a king's ransom
Jams I write soon become the ghetto anthem
Way out like Bruce Wayne's mansion, move like a Phantom
You'll talk about me to your grandsons
Cats who claimin' they hard be mad fags
So I run through 'em like flood water through sandbags
Competition is mad, what I got, they can't have
Sinkin' they ship like Moby Dick to Ahab
Son, I'm way past the minimum, enterin' millennium
My raps will hold a gat to your back like Palestinians
Ancient Abyssinian, sure to hold the Gideon
Official b-boy gentlemen, long term, never the interim
Born inside the winter, when? Day after December 10
These simpletons — they mentionin' the synonym for feminine
Sweeter than some cinnamon, the Danish rings by Entenmann's
Rush up on adrenaline, they get they asses sent to them
(Gentlemen!) You got a tenement? Well, then assemble it!
Leave your unit tremblin' like herds of movin' elephant
Intelligent embellishment, follow for your element
From Flatbush settlement, skin possesses melanin
Hotter than tales of crack peddlin'
Makin' 'em WOOP like blue gelatin, swing like Duke Ellington
Broader than Barrington Levy, believe me
The hot Apache red who burned down your chief teepee
You see me?

One, two, three, Mos Def and Talib Kweli
We came to rock it on to the tip-top

I'd like to make it like the sights on TV
Quite the great life, so nice and easy""
Sí, now you can still die from that
But it's better than not being alive from straps
Agreed, a Mead notebook
And a Bic that click when it's pushed
And a wack-ass beat — That's a track that's weak
That he got last week
Cause everybody in the stu' was like, ""That's that heat""
A bass-heavy medley, with a sample from the 70s
With a screwed-up hook that went ""stack that cheese""
Somethin'-somethin'-somethin'; ""stack that cheese""
Mother, sister, cousin; ""stack that cheese""
He couldn't think of nothin'; ""stack that cheese""
He turns down the beat, writer's block impedes
Crying from the next room, a baby in need
Of some Pampers and some food and place to sleep
That, plus a black Cadillac on Ds
Is what keep him on track to be a great MC

Minute Maid got his momma working like a slave
Down baby mama who he really had to honor
‘Cause she was his biggest fan, even let him use her Honda
To drive up to Dallas, went to open up for amateurs
Let him keep a debit card so he could put gas in it
Told her when he get on he gon' take her to the Galleria
Buy her everything but the mannequins, ya dig?

They played your freestyle over 'Wipe Me Down'
They played it two times, said it might be crowned
As the best thing out the H-Town in a while""
He picked up his son with a great big smile
Rapped every single word to the newborn child
Then he put him down and went back to the kitchen
And put on another beat and got back to the mission of
Get his momma out the hood, put her somewhere in the woods
Keep his lady looking good, have her rolling like she should
Show his homies there's a way, other than that flippin' yay
Bail his homie out of jail, put a lawyer on his case
Throw a concert for the school, show the shorties that it's cool
Throw some candy on the Caddy, chuck the deuce and act a fool

I'm on a whole different page right now than you (Girls on the floor)
It feels strange, but umm (Girls on the floor)
I guess it's kinda like, it's kinda like...

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I feel like I'm morphin' into somethin' that's so incredible
That I'm dwarfin' all competitors
Better get your girlfriend in check
It's psychological warfare, endorphins I effect
Your self-esteem shatters as dialect comes blastin' out your deck
She loves me, such passion, you'd expect
This sort of reaction from her, yet you strong-arm
You're fuckin' corny, you try to turn your charm on
'Cause you just think you're Bishop the Don Juan
But if you think that you're fuckin' with me, homie, you're on one
I'm cockin' my head back like Ed Lover, ""C'mon, son!""
She's on my Johnson, she brings my name up constant
Your boys are like, ""She's fuckin' with dude, she wants some""
Homeboy, you better get a clue
She's on my dick 'cause I spit better than you
What you expect her to do?
How you expect her to act in the sack when she's closin' her eyes
Fantasizin' of diggin' her nails in my back to this track?

And I'm in every single slot, and you're not — aww!
I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet: a star
And I'm not about to sit back
And just keep rhymin' one syllable — naw!
Switch it up and watch them haters not give it up
'Cause they're just not good enough, but I'm not givin' up
'Til I get my respect and I won't stop 'til I get enough
'Cause I'm not livin' up to my own expectations (Aww!)
That hater alarm is soundin' off
And Obama took the bomb from my name (Aww!)
So quit cryin' that I took your dame, homie, she's my dame (Aww!)
You sadly mistaken if you thinkin' that I'm not on my game, boy
And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came forth
You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank, boy

Am I makin' you look bad? Well, I got news for ya
Homie, you losin' her
Oh wait, she don't like when I spit it fast
Am I tryin' to show how? Let me slow it down some
It's still gonna be a blow-out
You're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage somethin' to see
If you can save any of it, punk, but none of it's fuckin' with me
Prick, you really feelin' that bullshit?
You think you killin' them syllables? Quit
Playin', these beats ain't nothin' to fool with
They call me Fire Marshall: I shut the shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round
I am also the opposite of what you are like
You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic

Okay, here we go, do-re-mi-fa-so, fa-so-la-ti-da-so
Lyrical Roscoe, kick back the Tabasco
You motherfuckers must just not know the tick-tock, so
Time to show you the most kick-ass flow in the cosmos
Picasso with a pick-axe, a sick asshole
Tic-tac-toe 'cross your six-pack with X-acto
Knives, stranglin' wives with thick lasso
Big bags of the grass, Zig-Zags, I'm with the Doc, so
You know how that go, skull and the crossbones
This is poison to boys and girls who do not know
You do not wanna try this at home, my lil' vato
This is neither the time nor the place to get macho
So crack a six-pack, sit back with some nachos
Maybe some popcorn and watch the show and just rock slow
It's not what you expected, nor what you thought, so
'Bout time that you wake the fuck up, smell the pot smoke

That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high

Faced with a dilemma: I can be Dalai Lama
And be calm or bring drama, a step beyond of Jeffrey Dahmer
Please don't upset me, mama, you're lookin' sexy, mama
Don't know if it's the lala or the rum and Pepsi, mama
Don't wanna end up inside my refrigerator freezer
Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza
How many people you know who can name every serial
Killer who ever existed in a row?
Put 'em in chronological order, beginnin' with Jack the Ripper
Name the time and place; from the body, the bag, the zipper
Location of the woods, where the body was dragged and then dumped
The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model, the make, the plate
And which model, which lake they found her in, how they attacked the victim
Say which murder weapon was used to do what in which one
Which knife and which gun, what kid, what wife, and which nun
Don't stop, I like this, it's fun, the fuckin' night's just begun
[Chorus]
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind
I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind

[Verse 3]
When I'm behind the mic, dynamite's what it's kinda like
You're stuck with the same stick that you're tryna light
Behind the board sits Dre, legends are made this way
Isn't it safe to say this is the way it should be?
Maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms
Here's a dosage of the antidote, now you give him some
He can give her some, she can give them some
Get behind a LinnDrum, make up a beat and cure the sucker syndrome
The spinnin' drum when it comes to lyrics and pennin' some
Startin' from scratch and then endin' up at the ending of
Capable of winnin' a Pulitzer
So unbelievable, it's a titanium cranium that's full of sur–
–prises when the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
You stare into your stereos (High)
Good evening, this isn't even a weed thing
I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drinking
[Chorus]
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind"
W.T.P.,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Yeah!
Oh!
Get up (Where my trash at?)
I said, get up (You know what happens when I'm around, man)
Woo! Let's go
Better watch out now 'cause here we come
And we ain't stoppin' until we see the morning sun
So give us room to do our thing 'cause we ain't come to hurt no one
So e'erybody come and get up on the floor now and grab someone

[Verse 1]
Man, first of all; I'm a boss, I just want to get that across
Man, even my dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto like it's a Porsche
Garbage bag for one of the windows, spray-painted doors
With the flames on 'em, Michigan plates, and my name's on 'em
Baby, Shady's here, come and get him if you dames want him
But he ain't stupid so quit tryna run them games on him
He's immune to Cupid, why you tryna put your claims on him?
'Cause you won't do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back, try not to kick over the gas can
There's a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
We have of just gettin' home, now can I get that lap dance?
She's got a tattoo of me right above her ass, man
In the streets of Warren, Michigan, we call 'em tramp stamps
That means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps down
And show this hussy who's the man now get amped, dance
[Chorus]
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party (White trash party)
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain't no one but us trash
You don't know, you better ask somebody
'Cause we're having a white trash party (White trash party)

[Verse 2]
Pull a fifth of Bacardi from out of my underwear
And walk around the party without a care, like a body without a head
Lookin' like a zombie from Night of the Living Dead
And tomorrow, I'll probably still be too high to get out of bed
'Til I feel like I been hit with the sharp part of the hammer
Mixin' Hennessy and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta (Woo)
I shoot the gift like I'm hollerin' ""Die Santa""
Missed the tree and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders (Yeah)
So quit tryna play the wall like you Paul, and
Get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap, darlin'
'Cause as soon as they throw on some R. Kelly, I start ballin'
Makin' it rain for the ladies in the minis
But I'm not throwin' ones, fives, tens, or even twenties
I'm throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at skinnies
Man, I do this for them bunnies up at Denny's, from the North, East, and West
But when it comes to them trailers in them South parks
Muffle it, 'cause, homie, that hood's tighter than Kenny's
So, ladies, if your belly button's not an innie, then I'm outtie
Now hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy
Come on
[Chorus]
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party (White trash party)
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain't no one but us trash
You don't know, you better ask somebody
'Cause we're having a white trash party (White trash party)

[Bridge]
Now whether you're black, white, or purple, if you're misunderstood
But you don't give a fuck, you ain't doin' shit that you should
Long as you know you're up to evil and you're no damn good
Get on the floor, man, and rep your hood

[Verse 3]
Now, honey, don't let them pricks trip, we should make a quick dip
And go do some doughnuts in the hospital parking lot, 'cause, girl—I got a sick whip
Kick the back window outta my Gremlin
Put two milk crates in the trunk, rip out the stick shift
And make a five-seater, I'll be damned if I feed a chick
It ain't like me to split a piece of dry pita
I be the S-L-to-the-I-M to the S-H-A-D-Y
And I don't need a tank top to be a wife beater
I'll rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down
'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown
I'll tell you now, I'm so raw, I still need to unthaw
You feel me, y'all? I shut the club down like Drake in the mall
But baby, a body like that's against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Coleslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car
Now get up
[Chorus]
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain't no one but us trash
You don't know, you better ask somebody

You see, I'm not as crazy as you thought I was, am I?
('Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm the American Dream
I'm the definition of white trash ballin', I'm right back on 'em
With a— err-chick-err, chicka-chick— I can't call it
Same shit, different toilet, oh, you got a nice ass, darling
Can't wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin
What you mean we ain't fuckin'? You take me for a friend?
Let me tell you the whole story of Shady's origin
You'll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again
Now, it all started with my father
I must've got my pimpin' genes from him the way he left my momma
I'm a rolling stone, just like him, word to Johnny Drama
Keep my entourage with me, baby, I'll make a promise
There ain't nobody as bomb as me, I'm as calm as
The breeze, I'm the bee's knees, his legs, and his arms, I'm a
Superstar, girl, I'm ready for you, Mama
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pajamas?

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuervo, first, I'll kiss your navel
Work my way down, baby, you can lay down on the table
But you may wanna find somethin' more stable
I told you I ain't foolin' from the gate, this ain't the first day of April
But thank you for stayin', April, I'ma make you
Learn to appreciate me, differentiate me
From these phony, little fishy and sissy fake Gs
Skip over the ""huggy bear,"" and all the ""kissy face,"" please
Initiate phase three, missy, now service me
Take another shot of Jäger, shake it so nervously
Take your time, baby, ooh, you're the bomb, baby
Ooh, you're doing that even better than your mom, lady
I told you why I'm Shady, you didn't listen now, did ya?
Relax, woman, you know that I'm only kiddin' wit' ya
Got a twisted sense of humor, it's warped, but I didn't hit ya
I think you're finally startin' to get the picture, I'm just–

I got you caught up in the rapture, make you recapture
The feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped ya
You never wanted someone so bad, you're
Sweatin', but if I'm what you wanted
Why'd you panic when I grabbed ya?
Girl, don't be so frantic, I'm just a hopeless romantic
Don't try to fight the feeling of somethin' that's so organic
You can't ignore it, so don't, just stand before it
Just drop them panties to the floor, let's get to camcordin'
Damn, shawty, I told you this was bound to happen
Soon as you wrote your number on the napkin
I was bound to work a number on your back
And throw your spine out of alignment
My love has got you so blind that
You couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a line-up
So stop at the store, pick a pint up
Let's get the pineapple Schnapps going, no one will knock
'Cause I'ma hang a sign up saying ""Don't Disturb""
Shawty, I'm so superb
I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words?

Space Bound,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Eminem]
We touch, I feel a rush; we clutch, it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible: gained my trust
Don't play games, it'll be dangerous
If you fuck me over, ‘cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya
What it's like to hurt, ‘cause I been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil — spell it backwards, I'll show ya
Nobody knows me, I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these muh'fuckin' hoes
Bloodsuckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be like
Tryin' to start over, I got a hole in my heart
But some kind of emotional roller coaster
Is something I won't go on
So you toy with my emotions, so it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya
Wasn't joking when I told ya
You take my breath away, you're a supernova, and I'm a—
[Chorus: Steve McEwan]
I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you
Right at you, right at you

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you, I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't with you, I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
Gonna be that one? And then once we get 'em, it's never the same
You want 'em when they don't want you
Soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled on to you, musta been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?
Let's cut to the chase 'fore the door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be makin' a mistake, ‘cause I'm a—

[Chorus: Steve McEwan]
I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you
Right at you, right at you
[Verse 3: Eminem]
So, after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryna stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen, so fuck it, I'm tryna stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeezin'
'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick, ain't no possible reason
I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Now I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this

[Bridge: Eminem]
And I would've done anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star, ‘cause I'm a—

[Chorus: Steve McEwan]
I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you

Without you, without you"
25 to Life,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by DJ Khalil & Danny Keyz]

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, twenty-five to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, twenty-five to life
Too late
(Yeah, I can't keep chasing you
I'm taking my life back)
Caught in a chase, twenty-five to life

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I woulda stayed
But I've already wasted over half my life, I woulda laid
Down and died for you, I no longer cry for you, no more pain
Bitch, you took me for granted
Took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt, I can no longer stand it
Now my respect, I demand it
I'ma take control of this relationship, command it
And I'ma be the boss of you now, goddamn it
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out, this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you I have stayed
Faithful all the way, this is how I fuckin' get repaid?
Look at how I dress, fuckin' baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothin' less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothin' left
But you keep treatin' me like a staircase: it's time to fuckin' step
And I won't be comin' back, so don't hold your fuckin' breath
You know what you've done, no need to go in-depth
I told you you'd be sorry if I fuckin' left, I laughed while you wept
How's it feel now? Yeah, funny, ain't it? You neglected me
Did me a favor though, my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
It's unfortunate, but it's—
[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, twenty-five to life
(Yeah, can't take no more)
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, twenty-five to life

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I feel like when I bend over backwards for you, all you do is laugh
'Cause that ain't good enough
You expect me to fold myself in half till I snap
Don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side? I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time? You don't think so, do you?
Jealous when I spend time with the girls, why I'm married to you still?
Man, I don't know, but tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcing you – go marry someone else and make 'em famous!
And take away their freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same shit that you made me eat
I'm moving on, forget you
Oh, now I'm special? I ain't feel special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this helplessness, imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out, I fell for this
So many times it's ridiculous
And still I stick with this, I'm sick of this
But in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get
Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep askin' me why I can't just walk away from
I'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama, I'm drawn to
Shit, I guess I'm a mess, cursed and blessed, but this time I
Ain't changin' my mind, I'm climbin' out this abyss
You're screamin' as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you, you left me off your list
Fuck you, hip hop! I'm leavin' you, my life sentence is served, bitch
And it's just—
[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, twenty-five to life
(I'm gone, man)
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, twenty-five to life
Too late
Caught in a chase, twenty-five to life"

I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

(Haha, yeah, haha)
You know, critics, man
Critics never got nothin' nice to say, man
You know, the one thing I notice about critics, man
Is critics never ask me how my day went
Well, I'ma tell 'em

[Verse 1]
Augh, yesterday my dog died
I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
Said: ""Next time you blog, try to spit a flow.""
You wanna criticize, dog? Try a little mo'
I'm so tired of this I could blow, fire in the hole
I'm fired up, so fire up the lighter and the dro
Better hold on a little tighter, here I go
Flows tighter, hot-headed as Ghost Rider
Cold-hearted as Spider-Man throwing a spider in the snow
So you better get lower than Flo Rida
Inside of a lowrider with no tires, in a hole
Why am I like this? Why is winter cold?
Why is it when I talk I'm so biased to the hoes?
Listen, dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
This isn't golf, this is a blistering assault
Those are your wounds, this is the salt, so get lost
Shit, dissin' me is just like pissin' off the Wizard of Oz
Wrap a lizard in gauze
Beat you in the jaws with it, grab the scissors and saws
And cut out your livers, gizzards, and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in a blizzard with Jaws
So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his drawers
Tickle him, go to his grave, skip him, and visit his dog
[Chorus]
(You're on fire)
That's how you know you're on a roll
'Cause when you're hot it's like you're burning up everyone else's cold
(You're on fire)
Man, I'm so fuckin' sick
I got ambulances pullin' me over and shit
(You're on fire)
You need to stop, drop, and roll
'Cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip-hop shop to blow
(You're on fire) Yeah
(You're on fire) Yuh

[Verse 2]
I just put a bullshit hook in between two long-ass verses
If you mistook this for a song, look, this ain't a song
It's a warning to Brooke Hogan and David Cook
That the crook just took over, so book
Run as fast as you can, stop writing and kill it
I'm lightning in a skillet, you're a fuckin' flash in the pan
I pop up, you bitches scatter like hot grease splashing a fan
Mr. Mathers is the man, yeah, I'm pissed
But I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
Come back and whip your ass with it again
Saliva's like sulfuric acid in your hand
It'll eat through anything, metal, the ass of Iron Man
Turn him into plastic
So for you to think that you could stand a fuckin' chance is asinine
Yeah, ask Denaun, man
Hit a blind man with a coloring book
And told him color inside the lines or get hit with a flying crayon
Fuck it, I ain't playin', pull up in a van
And hop out on a homeless man holding a sign sayin'
""Vietnam vet"", I'm out my fuckin' mind, man
Kick over the can, beat his ass, and leave him nine grand
So if I seem a little mean to you
This ain't savage, you ain't never seen a brute
You wanna get graphic, we can go the scenic route
You couldn't make a bulimic puke
On a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut poop
Sayin' you sick, quit playin', you prick, don't nobody care
And why the fuck am I yellin' at air?
I ain't even talkin' to no one, 'cause ain't nobody there
And nobody will fuckin' test me
'Cause these hoes won't even dare
I'm wasting punchlines, but I got so many to spare
I just thought of another one that might go here
Nah, don't waste it, save it, psycho—yeah
Plus you got to rewrite those lines
That you said about Michael's hair (Whoops!)
[Chorus]
(You're on fire)
That's how you know you're on a roll
'Cause when you're hot it's like you're burning up everyone else's cold
(You're on fire)
Man, I'm so- I'm so hot
My motherfuckin' firetruck's on fire, homie
(You're on fire)
You need to stop, drop, and roll
'Cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip-hop shop to blow
(You're on fire) Yeah
Oh, shit (You're on fire)"

Just shout whenever and I'll be there
You want my love, you want my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart

I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
(Luda)
When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us, nor could ever come above
She had me goin' crazy
Oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she's got me dazing, 'cause she was so amazin'
And now my heart is breakin', but I just keep on sayin'
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh

What's your phone number?

Now, I could make miracles to tempos
This instrumental's writin' for the nymphos: that's the intro
Shook when you rush me, walked up and touched me
Why? Do you wanna fuck me?
Just ‘cause I'm paid in the worst way? True
Lookin' kinda good in your birthday suit
I wonder if you're wild and you act shy
Do you like to be on top or the back side?
Watch me while you lick your lips
Shake your hips, goddamn, I love that shit
Yo, let's stop fakin', be real now
I got a room and a hard-on – still down?
Met you standin' at a bar full of black dudes
Said you wanna see my scars and my tattoos
When we head for my hideout, act right
Boss player when I ride out, that's right
What's ya phone number?
[Chorus: 2Pac & Danny Boy Steward]
If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off?
If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off?

[Verse 2]
Oh, shit, baby is a dime piece, more than just fine
She's personally blessed from the gods
If I seen her right now, she could get me hard
Didn't wanna talk to me just to see my car
Never had sex with a rich rap star
'Til I got her in the back of my homeboy's car
Tell me, why do we live this way?
Money over bitches, let me hear you say
What's your phone number? Are you alone?
Got a pocket full of rubbers, let's bone
Time for your girlfriend to take you home
I had fun, but baby, gotta leave me alone
Picture in my rhyme, take time to rewind these, learning every words I say
If you open your mind, bet in a minute you'll find
It's time, let the Outlawz play
What's ya phone number?

Dear Mama,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
You are appreciated

[Verse 1]
When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home
I was a fool, with the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
[Chorus: Reggie Green & Sweet Franklin, 2Pac]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

[Verse 2]
Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy, 'cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry
'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, 'cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hotplate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
[Chorus: Reggie Green & Sweet Franklin, 2Pac]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

[Verse 3]
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
'Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
[Chorus: Reggie Green & Sweet Franklin, 2Pac]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, lady (Dear Mama)

That's why I'm with you to this day boo, no fronting
Even when the skies were gray
You would rub me on my back and say, ""Baby it'll be okay""
Now that's real to a brother like me, baby
Never ever give my cootie away and keep it tight aight
And I'ma walk these dogs so we can live
In a fat-ass crib with thousands of kids
Word life, you don't need a ring to be my wife
Just be there for me and I'ma make sure we be
Living in the effin' lap of luxury

Wrapped in three-fourths of cloth never showing your stuff off, boo

Spit a rhyme to freeze a clock, take the hands of time and cuff 'em
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man

There's a storm comin' that the weatherman couldn't predict
I start to bug, prick, you better flee, 'cause I get ticked
It's a wrap, I was down, when I was down I was kicked
I got up, I'm back to punch you to the ground, you're tricked
It's a trap, fuck my last CD, the shit's in my trash
I'll be goddamned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last

Zero in on my target like a marksman, the target is you
I shut your lane down, took your spot, parked in it too
Arsenic flow, lighter fluid, saliva—what can you do?
Go get your crew to hype you up, stand behind you like, ""Woo!""
That boy's hot enough to melt Hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
So you can hate him, he don't blame you, frankly, he would too
This game could ill afford to lose him, how 'bout you?

[Verse 3: Sean Paul]
Out of town hard heads get Swiss cheesed up
And you gonna need more than stitches to patch that leak up
Chump like me up my mouth TB'd up
With the plush leather guts steady gripping the butt
Oh you for sure with it, then pull your pistol
Show a nigga you ain't hoe with it
And I ain't selfish I will let you and your folk feel it
Talking big-boy shit
Mean mugging like a motherfucker, my hand on my dick

[Verse 4: J-Bo]
Cause off the rip we keep it jumping like it ain't nothing new
We started off with Shake Em Off so look partner, oh guess who?
It's them boys from the bottom who took you down 85
And hit you with that U-Way so look here don't be surprised
We bucking, blowing, chilling and sipping on something good
I'm peeping out the scenery, wishing a nigga would
In case it just might pop off I'm ready to lock and load
To take you through the South to show you how we throw them bows

Juelz Santana, August 19th, from me to you:
Yo, I'm still popping the Ruger, duke
Still hop in the newest coupe
Still got me a hootie-hoo, still got me
From Rucka, too. And she will swallow a hoola-hoop
Ask around: she will swallow the Juicy Fruit
They can't tell em cats how them bullets
Propelling fast, leave your head and melon smashed
Hella fast in a yellow cab
Uh, comes to doing this, yeah you so great
When it comes to doing shh
Okay, you spit, you've got the flu: you sick
Homeboy, I'm rich! I got the coupe from this
I got the car, the crib, I got the roof from this
Plus I got your girl thinking I'm the cutest Dip
That'll hurt your heart, but I'm working hard
Y'all some hating chumps, back to making bucks
Boy, I'm so used to dishing the bird out
I bought a crib in the tree so I could live in the birdhouse
Dipset, boy, you know what them birds bout
Gun in each hand, so you know when them birds out
My man Black is the utmost nutso
British is dumb known for letting his gun go!
My man James keep the Glock on pop-o
Soon as I say ""get em!"" he says ""Tato, Tato""
He comes through with his Spanish team
2 Hummers: tan and green
1 coupe: a tangerine Lamborghin'
God damn it's mean, god damn the team
Look at his wheels: god damn the feet
God damn it, he keep on stuntin'
God damn, is he gon' keep on stuntin'?
Oh yes I am buzzin', oh yes I am buggin'
Oh yes I am dumpin' on any man frontin'
Oh yes I am, cousin
I don't play that, I ""OKAY"" that

Lose it now, Ruger down, chump: we'll shoot you down

Everybody out at the Rock the Mic tour
We back in the kitchen, rocking the white raw
You copping your pipe for, locking your nice doors
We pop up in like 4 with chickens that like raw
They clickin', they like raw! They fixin' to fight for
Me: look at my ice, for sure, your sight's sore
We all wearing links as I prepare a drink
Glare and think how I got the whole New York wearing pink
Girls, they stare and wink, how I flare the mink
Pop the top, pop the throttle, cock a Glock
Pop a bottle, see ""Paid in Full"" now I'm up in Blockbuster
And I'm paid in full: still on the block, buster
Not for rock, rucker, '01 ride-wrecker
Shogun, show guns, blow one, you not Gutter!
Little inside joke for you cocksuckers

Going Through Changes,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Lately, I really
Feel like I'm rollin' for delf like Philly
Feel like I'm losin' control of myself, I sincerely
Apologize if all that I sound like
Is I'm complainin' but life keeps on complicatin', and
I'm debatin' on leavin' this world this evenin'
Even my girls can see I'm grievin', I try and hide it
But I can't, why do I act like I'm all high and mighty
When inside I'm dyin'? I am finally realizin' I need
Help, can't do it myself, too weak
Two weeks, I've been havin' ups and downs
Goin' through peaks and valleys
Dilly-dallyin' 'round with the idea
Of endin' this shit right here, I'm hatin' my reflection
I walk around the house tryna fight mirrors
I can't stand what I look like, yeah
I look fat, but what do I care? I give a fuck
Only thing I fear's Hailie
I'm afraid if I close my eyes
That I might see her... Shit
[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin' at noon
Yeah, Dad's in a bad mood, he's always snappin' at you
Marshall, what happened that you can't stop with these pills?
And you've fallen off with your skills and your own fans are laughin' at you
It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle? Get up
Be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just whipped out and bust
Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that, he wouldn't fuckin'
Shoot at nobody, he'd fight first, but dwellin'
On it only makes the night worse, now I'm poppin' Vics, Percs
And Methadone pills, ""Yeah, Em, tight verse
You killed it!"" Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like yes men
And they gon' do whatever I says when I says it
It's in their best interest to protect their investment
And I just lost my fuckin' best friend, so fuck it, I guess then—

[Chorus: Eminem & Ozzy Osbourne]
(I'm going through changes) Don’t know what I’m gonna do
(I'm going through changes) But I just keep on going through changes
[Verse 3: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
My friends can't understand this new me, that's understandable
Man, but think how bananas you'd be, you'd be an animal too
If you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's lookin' at you, what you want me to do?
I'm startin' to live like a recluse
And the truth is, fame's startin' to give me an excuse
To be at an all-time low; I sit alone in my home theater
Watchin' the same damn DVD of the
First tour; the last tour, he was still alive
And it hurts so I fast forward, sleeping pills'll make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I'll just take a couple more, yeah, you're motherfuckin' right
I ain't slowin' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma, yeah homie, come on, dole 'em out!
""Daddy, don't you die on me! Daddy, better hold your ground!""
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice? Yeah, baby, hold me down (Daddy!)

[Chorus: Eminem, Ozzy Osbourne & Hailie Jade]
(I'm going through changes) (Daddy!) Don’t know what I’m gonna do
(I'm going through changes) But I just keep on going through changes

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes
But somehow I'm pullin' through
Swear when I come back I'ma be bulletproof
I'ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few
Facts, 'cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth
Shit, it just hit me that what if I would not've made it through?
I think about the things I would'a never got to say to you
I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do
Hailie, this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too
I still love your mother, that'll never change
Think about her every day
We just could never get it together, hey
Wish there was a better way for me to say it
But I swear on everything, I'd do anything for her on any day
There are just too many things to explain
When it rains, guess it pours — yes, it does
Wish there wasn't any pain, but I can't pretend there ain't
I ain't placin' any blame
I ain't pointin' fingers, Heaven knows I've never been a saint
I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history
And just today I looked at your picture, almost if to say
I miss you subconsciously, wish it didn't end this way
But I just had to get away, don't know why, I don't know what else to say
I guess I'm—

Nah, man—not quite finished yet
I'm not just one of your many toys
Ha-ha, woo!

[Verse 1: Eminem & Lesley Gore]
Girl, I think you just might've tried to pull a motherfuckin' fast one, I'm mad
You just hurt my goddamn feeling and that was the last one I had
Does this look like an arcade? Tryna play games? See this saw blade?
See this silhouette of a stalker in your walkway? Better cooperate
Or get sauteed and rotisseried while you're hog-tied
MC's get so quiet you can hear a motherfuckin' dog whistle when I walk by
Colt Seavers on a mule, stuntin' on that ass like the fuckin' Fall Guy
I don't gas my Mercedes after midnight, I treat it like a Mogwai
'Cause it will turn into a Gremlin and run over kids, women, and men
Vrinn-vrinn!—Motor so big, you can fit a midget in his engine
Bitch, give me them digits, why you cringin'? Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin
Will I spend-spend even ten cents on you, since when
Do you think it's gonna cost me a pretty penny? Shit, if I think a penny's pretty
Just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me; Eenie-meenie-miney-mo
Catch an Eskimo by his toe while he's tryna roll a snowball (You don't own me)
But don't make him lose his cool, if he hollers, better let him go, y'all (I'm not just one of your many toys)
'Cause

Now here we go, go, go

Get up, baby, get a move on like a U-Haul, you can rack your brain
Like pool balls; you won't ever think of this shit—yeah, honey, you called?
Well, here I come, Havoc on the beat, I wreak it; Evil—I see
Hear, and speak it—Lady, put your money on Shady, fuck that other weak shit
Put your eggs in the same basket, you can count every motherfuckin'
Chicken 'fore it hatches 'cause you can bet your ass that we gonna get it crackin'
Like the Kraken and Titans when they're clashin', get your brains bashed in
So bad, you will have Kurt Cobain askin' to autograph a bloodstained napkin
Unfashionable, and 'bout as rational as a rash on a fag's asshole
Now let's take that line, run it up the flagpole
With Elton, see if he's cool with it, don't stand there and look stupid
At me, bitch, I ain't in the mood for this shit, get my dick, Google it
'Til it pops up! Y'all are so motherfuckin' full of shit that you're stopped up
Me, I'm always shittin' diarrhea of the mouth 'til your speakers crap out (*fart*) Huh, what?
Girl, you got a hot butt like a lit cigarette (Chig-chigga-ret-ret)
But you won't get a hot fudge sundae from me so do not strut
My way, slut, because—

You don't own me
Now here we go, go, go

And now that I got your panties in a bunch and your bowels in an uproar
I'ma show you why I came, so you stop askin' me, ""What the fuck for?""
Now look you little slut, cunt, whore, I know you want more
Bitch, it's time to put the math back into Mathers 'cause I'm a fuckin' problem—run, boy!
Every flow, got it mastered so every last word that you fuckin' fags heard
Comes straight from the fish's ass, yeah, in other words, I'm a bass-turd
Lookin' at me like I killed Kenny, gas in the tank—yeah, still plenty
No morals are instilled in me, so remorse, I really don't feel any
Eat your heart out, Hannibal, understandable why you're jealous
Fuck an animal, I got cannibal magnetism, can't resist him now—can you, ho?
“Shady, I don't understand your flow” — Understand my flow? Bitch, I flow
Like Troy Polamalu's hair, boy, don't you dare try to follow or compare, boy
I'm raw, you ain't even medium-rare, stay the fuck outta my hair, boy
You can look, you can stare, and point, but you can't touch, I'm too clairvoyant
I don't get it, man, is there a void? All this weak shit, what am I, steroids?
Well, bitch, I'm back with some shit for that ass and your trunk, elephant hemorrhoids

If Proof could see me now, I know he'd be proud
Somewhere in me deep down, there's something in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
You try, it'll be them doors on Dre's Phantom, believe me, clowns
That means ""suicide,"" homie, you'll never throw me
Off of this course, blow me! Bitch, I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, I'm not just talkin' awards, homie
And the ball's in my court and it's lonely
On top of the world, when you're the only one
With the balls in your shorts
To leave their jaws on the floors with no remorse
'Member that when they get to doggin' you boy, homie
So y'all can just get to bloggin' about bologna

Droppin' the torch and it won't be long 'til this sport is O-V-

For you I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick it'll blow up the mic, it'll put the ""dyna"" in ""mite""
Yeah, it'll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
Tap dancin' all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself
Guess that the best thing I can do right now, Doody, for you is to rep
So I'm gonna fuck 'til I die, yeah, I'ma do it to death
And instead of mournin' your death, I'd rather celebrate your life
Elevate to new heights, step on the gas and accelerate, I'ma need two mics
'Cause the way that I'm feelin' tonight, everything I can just do right
There's nothin' that I can do wrong, I'm too strong and I'm just too hype
Just finish the rhyme and I bust it, excuse the corny metaphor
But they'll never catch up to all this energy that I've mustered
So God, just help me out while I fight through this grievin' process
Tryna process this loss is makin' me nauseous
But this depression ain't takin' me hostage, I've been patiently watchin'
This game, pacin' these hallways, you had faith in me always
Proof, you knew I'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes
Come right back on their asses and go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And I'ma show 'em, blow 'em out the water, slaughter 'em, homes
I'ma own so many belts, only place they can hit me is below 'em
Homie, I know I'm never gonna be the same without you
I never woulda came in this game, I'm goin' insane without you
Matter fact, it was just the other night had another dream about you
You told me to get up, I got up, I spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me, ""Naw, Doody, you're not!""; layin' on that table, I knew
I was gonna make it; soon as you said, ""Think of Hailie"" I knew
There wasn't no way that I was ever gonna leave them babies; and Proof
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
Lord, I'm so thankful, please don't think that I don't feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need for one more day to get through
So, homie, this is your song, I dedicate this to you
I love you, Doody

The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you're never over

And it don't stop, oh-oh
And it don't quit, oh-oh
And it don't stop, oh-oh

Hype Boys,Sway,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Hype boys, hype boys, everyone's a killer
Drug dealer with a nine mill-a
That's not sensible, and I can sense the bull
That's why these rappers couldn't see me coming
If they were vaginas, with spectacles
And I've got the testicles to testify the truth
Half these rappers are only gangsters in the booth
And they ain't never been to no Pen, they just hold one
Me, I be no gangster, I'm just telling you the truth
But I run up in the game like ""Bang bang bang bang""
That's why, that's why everybody keeps saying
Have you heard Sway? He's ""Nang nang nang nang""
That guy that guy's heavy in the game
And I've said: why buy this ""Fe-Fi-Fo""?
But them guys could never defeat my flow
Sway, all the way from the U to the K
Roll up with Bacardi in the tee-total
Getting over the CDs I've sold in it
I don’t want them to know that's the gold, innit?
That's the goal, innit?
Half the haters they ain't doing nothing with a mic but holdin' it, they slow with it
So they could never bring the game into the new school
I play too brutal
Plus I’m out of control like a cross-eyed teacher’s pupil
People down in England ain't all wild
But some places in Britain ain't the place to raise your child
Cos even the royal family ain't all smiles
Cos everybody knows, Harry don't look like Charles
See me, I've never been to court
And I've never been on trial, boy
Never been caught even though I've been around, boy
What’s that thing in your hand? Put it down, boy
Cos you're not a killer, you’re a sound boy

And the semi goes ratata, bang, bang

The pound is stronger than the dollar, holla
Sway, I ran up in this game like a robber without a rubber
And now I been around and I'm pro
Won a couple of awards, now a round of applause
And now I'm making Ps and I'm pleasing my people
Not even a Jamiroquai hat could fit my ego
‘Nuff of these rappers ain’t real, they’re just rapping hype
Why you shouting all the time? Don't you have a mic?
Run up in the club like, be-ow, be-ow
Bust two lyrics then, we out, we out
Them boys talk too lee-oud, lee-oud
But they puss like, meow, meow
And they don't really want no war time
This rap game is all mine
It will never be your time, allow it, bruv, 'cos you're small time
And I got more time, so settle down, boy
Before I make you look like something like a clown, boy
What's that thing in your hand? Put it down, boy
Cos you're not a killa, you're a sound boy
[Hook x2]
Hype boys, hype boys
(Everyone's a bad man now)
On the mic boys, mic boys
(And everyone's a bad man now)
And the semi goes bratatatatatatatata (Yeah right)
And the semi goes ratata, bang, bang

[Verse 3]
Are you a liar? If your reply is no, you're lying now
Because we live in a lie
And then we die and then we're lying down
Look at my Adam's apple, it's not that my neck hurts
No, no, it's just the truth is hard to swallow
And you can see that I'm an expert
So let, let me elaborate as I navigate, like a husky
But trust me, the truth is, I wouldn't even trust me
Many rely in religion, that doesn't make sense
Cause that's considered a sin
It is really no winning cause every one harbors a liar within them, it's just that we're different
Being a bad liar is like having a bad lawyer
As soon as they get caught they get the sentence uffed up
A good liar's benevolent, with a memory like an elephant
Intelligent, and knows exactly when to shhhhh
Lies spread around like viruses, so how can I survive in this?
Cause even the truth lies (where?)—in people's irises
So how can I resist? I had to lie to write this verse
Got my talent for twisting words
Hence my title, I'm a ""lie""ricist
When you work the people don't want to leave alone
Cause you gotta make money, you don't need the loan
I'm a businessman underneath the foam
But you lie to the people and lead them on
You're not a bad boy, no, I got a bad boy flow
Cos when in Rome you do what the Romans do
Especially when all roads lead to Rome
You need to stop pretending
Your mixtapes are still in boxes
Cause you don't have a fan in your bedroom
What's that thing, in your hand? Put it down, boy
Cause you're not a killa, you're a sound boy
[Hook x2]
Hype boys, hype boys
(Everyone's a bad man now)
On the mic boys, mic boys
(And everyone's a bad man now)
And the semi goes bratatatatatatatata (Yeah right)
And the semi goes ratata, bang, bang"
Doin It Again,The Roots,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: John Legend]
I keep it doin' it again
Oh, I'm doin' it again
Yes, I'm doin' it again
I said it would end

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Uh, remix, rising up out of the flames like a phoenix
Straining to carry the weight of my brain like a genius
Knowing I'm sowing seeds, let's see whose thumb is the greenest
If I said, I mean it, I did it because I need it
Eat, sleep it or bleed it, write it down and then read it
Asphalt to the cement, your trash talk, deleted
I blast off, then lay 'em out like a Tempurpedic
It's Black Thought, for certain I'ma win eventually
This unsung, underrated, under-appreciated
The one them underachievers had underestimated
Finally graduated, I'm one of the most hated
Something that's so sacred, nobody gon' take it
Face it, I keep doin' it well
Doin' it sans assistance, just do it yourself
Doin' it below the radar, we doin' it stealth
Doin' it again for Illadelph, yo, who else?
We gon' do it again!
[Hook: John Legend]
I keep it doin' it again
Oh, I'm doin' it again
Yes, I'm doin' it again
I said it would end

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Yeah, ayo, I'm on my job, see my eyes focused where the prize be
Even though they tried to rob me and sabotage the spot
Just like 'Pac when they got him in the lobby
Tried to tax and fine me like Ronald Isley
I's a changed man, ain't no if, and's or probably's
Niggas used to know me, they don't even recognize me
Yep, the P-5-D is who the repertoire be
Doin' it again just like Poitier and Cosby
I'm like Martin Luther King, you like Rodney
The difference is I give it everything inside me
Dear diary, the fans still swear by me
Even though I'm late night now like, ""Here's Johnny""
Swimming with them Great Whites now, that's where to find me
Funny how it break right down, but never mind me
Forever grimey, I guess it's just Philly shining
Rock roller, bipolar like Phyllis Hyman

I keep it doin' it again
Oh, I'm doin' it again
Yes, I'm doin' it again

Right here?
Yo, Jam Boy magic, Mr. Fantastic
Masterful mind, the list that I've crafted
Fresh new trick to flip, I'm Dick Dastard
Half smooth criminal and half straight bastard
No mask when your flag get captured
First class, take you to the rap hereafter
Gone in a flash and yet, he gets faster
Sick when he hits the mic like Mixmaster
This the Battle of Troy with no Pastor
Slicker than a can of oil with no castor
Chill in the front of the flight, outclass them
Bring your favorite rapper to fight, I'll trash him
Then I'll leave in a timely fashion
Uh, emcees get the tiny rations
Your girl hold me close as a tiny dancer
You got a death wish? Well it's finally answered, prick

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Yo, Jam Boy magic, Mr. Sarcastic
Rap catalogue consists of all classics
Blackness, cause your (bitch) to fall backwards
Fuck a hood pass, my shit's for all-access
Killing tracks like this, we call practice
Any bullshit y'all twist, we call backwards
Jam Boy sharp as a tack, we all cactus
Waiting on a big payback with no taxes
So if you follow the game, you might catch this
Act like an activist; you know, active
Nigga like me just has to spit acid
Sucker like you just has to get blasted
Ashes to ashes, Frazier to Cassius
No *omoh* (homo), but y'all some pains in the asses
Get turned to toast like raising your glasses
When I'm on stage, girls swing from the rafters
Often nasty like Monster Mashing
Y'all know the voice is tight, hoarse and raspy
Can't place the face, kind of hard to catch me
Kings that pull strings like Dorothy Ashby
Jawns keep telling me I'm great like Gatsby
Caught like a felony, you can't slide past me
I'm lowkey, kind of anti-flashy
Then I'm OG up in a black tie classy
Sun Tzu to Sun Ra, Gargamel, Mumm-Ra
Son of a shooter letting slugs from a gun fly
Should call a Mumbai with the bumbaclot
It's Black Thought, my sound's hard to come by
Last spotted on a yacht getting dumb high
Banging yacht rock with my squad from 215
Straight calling niggas out like the umpire
Any chump tryna front, word 'em up
[Verse 3: Peedi Peedi]
Jam Boy magic, Mr. Get-Busy
You get busy too? Then get with me too, we'll get busy, dig me?
Smooth Remy, tool skinny but hold plenty
.22 long contact, new Bentley
No miles yet, curve backs and cruise and he
Bring it back when you through with it, roger that
Grip tenny, French manies in Vic' panties
Lips candy, dick hard as a fifth of Brandy
Hop in it for 5 minutes then I'm finished
Cause pussy is pleasure but I'm attending my business
Retractable roof, magical coupe disappearing
And reappearing, German engineering this McLaren
Hot jacuzzis, watching movies, Glock and uzis
Shots of Louis, busting cuties popping jeweries
Ooh, Ultramag' MC in a M3
Whole body tatted straight up outta NP"
Intro,J.R. Writer,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Get it clear -- hater, I'm here
Still Standing, welcome to the tape of the year
Haze in the air, I done turned it up another notch
Bulbs in my ear, I done turned it up a couple watts
At the motherfucking spot -- not the ""motherfucking spot""
But your mother's fucking spot, with the butter in the pots
I don't know why I come across humble when I'm not
Might have lost a couple rocks, but I'm up a couple blocks
Suckers need to stop, give me a break
Since '07 I've been getting six figures a tape
While you get what you take; I'm a bit overweight
Picking pounds up like I'm trying to get into shape
Hundred grips in the safe, that's something you know nothing 'bout
So get in your place -- my bad, I mean your mother's house
Huh, I laugh; put up the right cash
And these corns want beef, I'mma crush 'em like hash
The hottest you know; you gotta be slow
I'm still standing, nothing like the Monica show
The Dips split, and they wondering which side I'mma go
But I don't pick sides, and the game's not to be told
I don't switch sides, man -- the game's got to be sold
I'm gonna let the Dip fly until they can't fly anymo'
No, ain't no one iller; what up, Killa?
Ain't speak about two years but what up, nigga?
I'm still J.R., a.k.a. A.R
B.k.a. ""Who are you? You ain't on my radar""
Get it? This my play-yard, and I don't want these pawns around
Play hard, I play you out -- listen, this my stomping ground
I want the crown even though that I'm a champion
You still buying Champions; shit, I'm from Lionel Hampton
130th, burning piff with the burner grip
I don't need a burner to murder this -- I just murder it
I know you heard I'm sick, or if not, you heard I'm sick
And yeah, the flow from outer space, but I'm earthing this
How you sold grams? You ain't never served a brick
It's like you got no hands -- you ain't got a bird to flip
I'm from the murder strip, hood life shady
Nah, I wasn't born a rapper -- the hood life made me
But lately, I've been in the hood like crazy
Put red marks on your head, you'll look like Baby, baby
I am great, skipping on the race
730, but what I meant it's twenty minutes late
Niggas reckless, give the kid a break
Scott Tissue records, I'm shitting on your tapes
But hey, I'm still lamping, Lex with the grill dancing
Still scrambling cause yes, I'm a real champion
Of course, come mess with a real cannon
You thought I fell off, well welcome to Still Standing

GOAT,J.R. Writer,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1 - J.R. Writer]
I'm the greatest of all time
Nigga, ask around -- I've been great for a long time
On grind, I be amazing, I'm off mines
You ain't gotta pass the crown, I'm taking what's all mines
Who don't shine? My wristwatch make the chicks hot
A lil' head in the car -- that's a whip-wop
Then tell her kick rocks, thinking she gon' get guap
Ain't got enough for the train, I tell the bitch, hop
This is real hip-hop, what the kid drop
You couldn't slow the dog down at a pit stop
I play like 'Melo, but I keep a big shot
Shoot you while you pushing your work -- that's a sling shot
I'm already king, I've chin-checked the ring
You waiting on the right pitch, you don't never swing
Mask, black gloves, all-black everything
Black Mag, black snub, floormat, everything
You'll respect me then, would you, shouldn't you
I'm sick of you niggas talking on what you wouldn't do
I mean, look at you -- I make it hard to look at you
Come through and shake the whole block down -- I'm shook of who?
I'm live-er than that, hotter than that
I leave the whole strip red, no Prada to match
I body a track, bottle the crack
These niggas act like I woke up and forgot how to rap
I'm back
[Verse 2 - Cassidy]
Hi haters; I keep getting high, haters
I'm grown, no chaser, I'm high as a skyscraper
Homes, you at home with your mom -- I own acres
I own so much land, man, I'm my own neighbor
You a beggar; you need a loan, a favor
I get cash, you just mad, you got the vapors
A lot of niggas wish they was Cas, but can't be me
My diamonds probably make you go blind, you can't see me
Cause my diamonds shining like the finger on E.T
You on a bus, I'm in a truck with three TV's
I dropped three CD's, but I'm just getting started
My new album coming out -- it's 'bout to get retarded
Shit! Pardon my French, motherfucker
But I'm hustling, got it jumping like Vince, motherfucker
Yeah, the boy in the zone
About to show his ass like the artist formerly known as Prince, motherfucker
And I'm about to convince motherfuckers
That I got more bars than AT&T and them Sprint motherfuckers
Go ahead with that nonsense, motherfucker
Cause you said you make it rain but can't even make it rinse, motherfucker
You never fought a homicide or attempts, motherfucker
You jokes could get smoked like incense, motherfucker
Gee I'm hung, but I ain't get lynched, motherfucker
That's why I walk with a limp, motherfucker
I'm a pimp, motherfucker"
Fireworks,Drake,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Drake]
Money just changed everything
I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Looking down from the top and it's crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear 'em talking, I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me, it could take a bit
Yeah, and my dreams are who I'm racing with
But you can see I'm pacing it so that I'm always chasing it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
October's Own but it's looking like July 4
I just wish they'd let you try it first
This time I'm really going off, fireworks

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means
[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—Oh

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm just such a gentleman, you should give it up for me
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I could tell it wasn't love, I just thought you'd fuck with me
Who could've predicted Lucky Strike would have you stuck with me
Damn, I kept my wits about me luckily
What happened between us that night? It always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden, these gossip rags want to cover me
And you making it seem like it happened that way because of me
But I was curious
And I'll never forget it, baby, what an experience
You could've been the one but it wasn't that serious
There was smoke in the air before, that was me clearing it
That felt good, all in all, I learned a lesson from it though
You never see it coming, you just get to see it go
Yeah, I should've looked up in the sky at first
Now I can see it in her eyes, fireworks
[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream

Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—Oh

[Verse 3: Drake]
Everythin' the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And he's still got his foot out, guilt tripping
It's been years though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my realtor, we built up a better report
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city, I let her explore
And now she's saying she more lonely than ever before
How many of our parents marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the Heritage Classic
Searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first
That's why I'm really going off, fireworks

Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again

With the people that I won't forget
Spending all the money I just worked my ass off for
Doing things that I won't regret
I've been waiting way too long, long, long, long
Telling everybody that I know we about to be on, on, on, on
I ain't trying to look like I lied to these niggas
That I came up with, that's my team
Never would I let a woman come between
What we doing right now, this our dream

I'm the Osiris to this shit right now
Go-to guy for the hits right now

Make the most out of tonight
And worry 'bout it all tomorrow
Understand girl, we fam girl
Can't get me right and not do Wayne
Cash Money, Young Money, pop champagne
Presidential suite, girl: Barack Hussein
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg?
People really hate when a backpack rapper
Get rich and start living that life, dawg
Feels like when you get into that paper, hip hop hates you
They would do it just like I do if they could
It's in our nature—young and rich and out of control
Out in LA blowing clouds of the killa
I came up in the underground, though
So I'mma spend another $10,000 for Dilla
Call me overrated or created or too jaded
Because anyway you put it, bitch, I made it—Yup!

How did I end up right here with you?

Uh, you getting ready so I know we gon' be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyle
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
You say you droppin' 10 pounds preparin' for summer
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself, you the fucking coldest
Intelligent too, ooh you my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a lil' class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think nobody does it better

From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
They get a baller, figure they ain't got to pick a career
Guess they plan on sucking dicks until some millions appear
Like “Voilà!” You do it right he just might buy you a car
Now she play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I'm buying, you decline, that is kinda bizarre
Independent with the demeanor of an R&B singer
Naked ring finger, M3 Bimmer
Champagne Range, triple-white Jag
Closet full of brand new clothes and handbags
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
D&G, BCBG, Versace, Louis and Bebe
You ain't needy, greedy or easy as these other breezy's

And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never but never late is better
They tell me time is money, well, we'll spend it together
I'm down for whatever, you just lead the way
We go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it, I ain't never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
A little something extra, should we ever need it

Moment of silence for the champions
For those who make goin' hard a lifestyle
Never waver
Nothing, gotta get it right now
I'm in the spotlight
When they turn the lights down
Only a champ swings the hardest in the 12th round

I love the 4th quarter
I love the 9th inning
I love Game 7
Bring on the competition
Cause in my heart, can't nobody do it better
Can't slow me down
Won't stop me never

I'm so Cassius Clay
I'm Tyson in his prime
You don't leave with it
I'm Barry Bonds with mine
I beat the buzzer, baby
My stroke is hole in one
You see the checkered flag
Finish line, here I come
And I ain't gotta brag
I let the trophies do it
Around here, we the best
Now come and hold me to it
I specialize in everything that can't be done
Ain't no more talk about it
Moment of silence for the champions
[Hook]
They say we warriors
They say we did it again
(Hands high for the champions!)
We are victorious
We only in it to win
(Stand up for the champions!)
No surrender, no retreat
We take the battlefield over every time
(Yeah, clap your hands for the champions!)
We came, we saw, we conquered everything in sight

Moment of silence for the champions!

Ay yo, ay yo, ay yo
That's the sound you hear from the crowd when we come through
(They screaming...)
Ay yo, ay yo, ay yo
We run the town here, can't you tell when we come through?
They screaming... the champions!
Cause we are... the champions!
Yes, we be... the champions!
Cause we are... the champions!
They screaming... the champions!
Can't nobody compare with us
There ain't no competitors
No wonder why we are
We are the champions

You read the newspapers, you saw the magazines
You got the Internet, but you ain’t gotta Google me
My name is up in lights, my face is well-known
You see us Super Bowl dancing in the end zone
You see us taking shots of vodka out the Stanley's Cup
You see us running out and telling you what, we're fired up
And in my heart, can't nobody do better
Can't slow me down, won't stop me never

I'm Dale Earnhardt, I'm so Michael Phelps
So many gold medals, too many title belts
I started all-state and came up from there
Now I'm a world champ and reppin' everywhere
Call me incredible, work ethic impeccable
I did it for the decimals, and now I can't let it go
I specialize in everything that can't be done
Ain't no more talk about it

That's the sound you hear from the crowd when we come through
(They screaming...)
Ay yo, ay yo, ay yo
We run the town here, can't you tell when we come through?
They screaming... the champions!
Cause we are... the champions!
Yes, we be... the champions!
Cause we are... the champions!
They screaming... the champions!
Can't nobody compare with us
There ain't no competitors
No wonder why we are
We are the champions"

Diplomats, Young Guru, Jim Jones, Santana, Freaky
Came in second half
Shit man, only thing we really wanna know right now is
What? Is what's really good? That's the question

[Cam'Ron]
Suicide sickness, child negligence
Homicide fingerprints, wild evidence (But what?)
But thou shall, respect me bloa, bloa
Clap, clap, pow, pow, bow down, nigga
Be in Columbus never seen Bow Wow (Nope)
We big dogs, all on the chow down
Chow, and Mr. Giles lay back
Santana locked up, get 'em out ASAP
Aight, now boy, not tonight
I where a bomb to the court like it's a ice white
I'm real ice right, still in the hood
But the question for y'all is
(DMX) What's Really Good?
(Cam) Nothing, see me on 55th, black scooped it up
A-k activated, act stupid, one did act stupid
Mac had to move it, from the hood like
(DMX) What's really good?
(Cam) I had to lay 'em down, clip him up, sprayed around
Split him up, he played the ground, leave, nine stayed around
Outlaw on the street, shot four from the three
Southpaw Portuguese (What's Really Good?)
[Hook: Cam'Ron] + (DMX)
To all my ladies, ghetto to ghetto
Heals, sneakers, slipper stilettos, hello
Diplomats are coming to your hood
And we wanna know (What's really good?)
All my niggas, block for block
Rock for rock, top for top
Top a top, stash your clocks under the hood
And niggas wanna know (What's really good?)

[Jim Jones]
Okay I admit
I mean they said I was trippin' had to re-edit the spin
44 lead when I'm spitting
Shots to the head of my victims
Big deserts we grippin' to dry out, you in the desert is slippin'
They go through extreme measures to get 'em
Them chains and them treasures the glistening
You got three hideouts, a bed in the system
My brethren I miss them
So please tell me y'all
(DMX) What's really good?
(J.Jones) Top of the drop when it's missing
MY block when it's clickin', these rocks when they glistening
(DMX) What's really good?
(J.Jones) 145th on this crunk, big 45th in my trunk
Big gouty wrists on you chumps
Mostly me and sometimes them
But mostly me, oh shit man, that's one time them
Squally, so through your set up please
And let me know if you really good
And let me know if you really hood

[Cam'Ron]
I like this beat, drums and bells
Remind me of bullets, bodies, guns and shells
I don't talk the verse, Polly wanna cracker
When she on the stand, you probably wanna smack her
Probably wanna clap her, end your day properly
Air the shit out like the end of State Property
No run away robber, gunner stay half of me the end I see prophecy
(DMX) What's Really Good?
I'm in the buggy mon', with the Rugby on
Air Force Ones, looking like Lucky Charms
Lotta dudes, yelling out ""Fuck me, uh?""
I'll blow this bitch dog, what the fuck we on

[Juelz Santana]
It's Santana, I'm straight out the box homey
Straight to the stoop, straight to the booth when I stepped out the box homey
I still got the sun of the box on me
Grimy clothes, funky arms, my socks dirty
I told you I can count on my boy
I'm in trouble, needed bail money, dialed on my boy
Shit, and just when I thought it was getting worst
I was bailed out scot-free, spittin' this verse, uh-huh
You don't sit in the dirt, clips'll disperse
(Dmx) What's Really Good
(Santana) ME MOTHERFUCKER!!!
Don't play with this, I'm so great at this

Barfight, my jaw tight, my chin is stable

Coat hangers, I'm in the arms, launching on no-namers
I been battling scarecrows, this shit's been a no-brainer
He hoping bail come through
The jail feel like shampoo, that was the cell son blew
The brick get frail, piff go stale
It's like a nigga hustling always seem to tip with the scale

Ample time to do this, have you shot? I thought you knew this
I'm crumbling, no time for fumbling
Selling my sacks, watching my back
Wetting 'em up like splish, leaving 'em in a splash
Of blood, the clock is ticking niggas from my block is missing

Uh-huh, they said he's busy, hold the line please
Call me crazy, I thought maybe he could mind read
Who does the blind lead? Show me a sign please
If everything is made in China, are we Chinese?
And why do haters separate us like we siamese?
Technology turning the planet into zombies
Everybody all in everybody's dirty laundry
Acid rain, earthquakes, hurricane, tsunamis
Terrorists, crime sprees, assaults and robberies
Cops yelling ""Stop freeze,"" shoot him 'fore he try to leave
Air quality so foul, I gotta try to breathe
Endangered species and we running out of trees
If I could hold the world in the palm of these hands
I would probably do away with these anomalies
Everybody checking for the new award nominees
Wars and atrocities, look at all the poverty
Ignoring the prophecies, more beef than broccoli
Corporate monopoly, weak world economy
Stock market toppling, mad marijuana
OxyContin and Klonopin, everybody out of it

Well I've been thinking about
And I've been breaking it down
Without an answer
I know I'm thinking out loud
But if your love's still around
Why do we suffer? Why do we suffer?

Uh-huh, yeah, it's still me, one of your biggest fans
I get off work, right back to work again
I probably need to go ahead and have my head exam
Look how they got me on the Def Jam payment plan
Well, I'm in the world of entertainment and
Tryna keep a singing man sane for the paying fans
If I don't make it through the night, slight change of plans
Harp strings, angel wings and praying hands
Lord, forgive me for my shortcomings
For going on tour and ignoring the court summons
All I'm tryna do is live life to the fullest
They sent my daddy to you in a barrage of bullets
Why is the world ugly when you made it in your image?
And why is living life such a fight to the finish?
For this high percentage, when the sky's the limit
A second is a minute, every hour's infinite

That type of thinking can't get you nowhere (Ugh, oh)
Someone has to care (Uh)
How I got over

Where the people come apart
Don't nobody care about you, only thing you got is God
Out here in these streets, if you get down on your luck
You can stand out with a hand out, but nobody give a fuck
Out here in these streets, every man is for himself
They ain't helping no one else, it's a hazard to your health
Living life in these cold streets
Hey—who's worrying 'bout you, babe?
When you wilding out? Running around in these streets?

Living with the police right behind you
It's always more than a slight reminder
We living in a war zone like Rwanda
Before I go back to the Heavenly Father
Pray for me, if it ain't too much bother
Whatever don't break me'll make me stronger
I feel like I can't take too much longer
It's too much lying and too much frying
I'm all cried out 'cause I grew up crying
They all got a sales pitch; I ain't buying
They trying to convince me that I ain't trying
We uninspired, we unadmired
And tired and sick of being sick and tired
Of living in the hood where the shots are fired
We dying to live; so, to live, we dying
You just like I am

Someone has to care
Man, somebody's gotta care

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
And I swear it isn't fair
In suspended animation, we ain't tryna go nowhere
Out here in these streets, we're so young and all alone
We ain't even old enough to realize we're on our own
Living life in these hard streets, where it's like they lost they mind
Is there anyway to find? Are we running out of time out here?

But I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas
With no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me 'cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office and back at my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze?
Ho, please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said, ""Motherfuck the police!""
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all!
If y'all don't like me, blow me!
Y'all are gon' keep fuckin' around with me and turn me back to the old me

Nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips

So what do you say to somebody you hate (What?)
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (Yup)
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walkin' by
With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Gave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?)
And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
Fuck you too, bitch, call the cops
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here!)
So from here on out, it's the Chronic II
Startin' today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady
Hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Callin' men ladies
Sorry Doc, but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him, Hailie (Dada?)

Comin' up to me with your hands out
Lookin' up to me like you want somethin' free
When my last CD was out, you weren't bumpin' me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me
Like it was some disease, but you won't get a crumb from me
'Cause I'm from the streets of C-Compton! (Compton!)
I told 'em all
All 'em little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none
What, you think I sold 'em all
'Cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What, 'cause I been in the lab
With a pen and a pad tryin' to get this damn label off?
I ain't havin' that
This is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gon' be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque
And fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the Mad Rappers at?
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats
While you were cuddlin' a Cabbage Patch

As far as I can see, I've made it to the threshold
Lord knows I've waited for this a lifetime
And I'm an icon when I let my light shine
Shine bright as an example of a champion
Taking the advantage, never copping out or cancelling
Burn like a chariot, learn how to carry it

It's David and Goliath, I made it to the eye of the storm
Feeling torn like they fed me to the lions
Before my time start to wind down like the Mayans
I show 'em how I got the grind down like a science
It sounds like a riot on hush, it's so quiet
The only thing I hear is my heart, I'm inspired
By the challenge that I find myself standing eye to eye with
Then move like a wise warrior and not a coward
You can't escape the history that you was meant to make
That's why the highest victory is what I'm meant to take

Oh, where's Mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh, that smell? Dada musta runned over a skunk

That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way she'll throw a fit
Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it! (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? (yeah!)

A lot of people counting on me kinda like a digit
It's a cold world, I'm not fronting like it isn't
It's no time for coming up shorter than a midget
Y'all know I'ma raise the bar though like Brigitte
See there a star go, don't blink, you might miss it
It's precious cargo, you gotta be strong to lift it
The light comes in different types, be more specific
Shit, I'm Black Thought, what could be more prolific?
For this love, I go above and beyond the limit
I told y'all I'm above and beyond a gimmick
I get into your head and spread like a pandemic
I never put myself in a race I can't finish
I'm well grounded, founded on the same premise
As any man with a hitlist that's about business
Yo, can a brother get a witness? Dig it
Right on
[Hook: Joanna Newsom]
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the Book of Right On is right on, it was right on
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the Book of Right On is right on, it was right on

[Verse 2: Sugar Tongue Slim]
Okay, I'm above and beyond hot, my measurement in watts
Time rate of flow and energy ain't never gon' stop
Pressure's on, I won't pop, microphone I won't drop
Gemstones niggas cop ain't shit if I ain't in the spot
It's the Orion of the hop, the new star of the hip
I shine a light for the future so my presence's a gift
It's evident I'm heaven sent with Thomas Edison elements
Reverence for what I represent should show my benevolence
This is Philly, I'm repping for the art of the city
Came from southwest Atlanta, gave my heart to the city
Where slugs fly, thugs cry cause every part of it's gritty
Niggas shooting up the club like they party with Diddy
You get the diggy? I flip my incandescence to fluorescence
And in essence I can burn more joules of energy per second
I put them on to lessons while I'm smoking on the blessing
The switch hitter like Pete Rose, right up the session
Right on

[Hook: Joanna Newsom]
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the Book of Right On is right on, it was right on
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the Book of Right On is right on, it was right on

Hustla,The Roots,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Let me tell you what priceless is, some advice to give
A sacrifice is what I made for the wife and kids
They say life's a bitch, but it's one life to live
I want my baby where that cake and the icing is
Out of them crisis-es, off of them vices-es
They see what we do and grow up in our likenesses
Really I don't wanna see em having to fight for this
Story of the family biz, I'ma rewrite the script
Daughter of a hip-hopper, hustla like her grandpoppa
Her destiny done been determined so you can't stop her
From being independent, earning paper and proper
More like a lawyer or a doctor, not a man-watcher
That's where your man got ya, it's a big world out'chea
I'm tryna make a black diamond or a pearl out'chea
And hip the people to the way the world twirl out'chea
And when I thank heaven for my little girl

[Hook: STS]
Please let her be a hustla, baby be a hustla
Hope my baby girl grows up to be a hustla
Better be a hustla, baby be a hustla
If not, then you're only a customer
Please let him be a hustla, baby be a hustla
Hope my baby boy grows up to be a hustla
Better be a hustla, baby be a hustla
If not, then you're only a customer
[Verse 2: STS]
Sugar Slim, I'm slicker than a squid, nigga no kids
No baby mama, Sugar free from the drama
Sugar be where he wanna, no sweat like a sauna
No judge, Your Honor can't tell me to raise mine
Figured that in due time, if and when I do find
True love, Buddha, maybe you can blue-line
Ooh, I'm caught up in the moment for the meantime
G, I'm all about the green like tree pines
See I'm tryna get the scratch like a feline
Hopin' that my seed don't know the struggle like me, I'm
Hustlin' to make a buck, make a buck and fuck it up
Fuck it up and suck it up then go and make another buck
Get the money, get the money, that's what I know
I'm hopin' that my seeds know a little more than I know
I know, I know, but baby this what I know
If we ever settle down, well baby, this what I hope

[Hook: STS]
Please let her be a hustla, baby be a hustla
Hope my baby girl grows up to be a hustla
Better be a hustla, baby be a hustla
If not, then you're only a customer
Please let him be a hustla, baby be a hustla
Hope my baby boy grows up to be a hustla
Better be a hustla, baby be a hustla

Walk Alone,The Roots,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'jazz']","[Verse 1: Truck North]
Trapped, no shield, no sword
The unbeaten path got my soul so sore
Allured by the lust, something money can't cure
The Devil want me as is, but God he want more
Eyes closed, eyes open, great another day, here we go
Like a nigga woke up late in The Truman Show
Living life without a care, mean pokerface
But I'm forced to play solitaire 'til I get up out of here
Move like a wanted man with a bounty on his head
Work alone, sleep alone, eat alone, daily bread
Counting 'til my fingers red, how you gon' judge a man?
Walking in the shoes of a man with a broken leg
Flame on the trail headed for the powder keg
Last place in the race I ain't never led
Like I ain't never bled, time to get up out of bed
Serving in the army of one, it's on again

[Hook: Dice Raw]
Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own
Ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walking alone
Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own
Ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walking alone
[Verse 2: Greg Porn]
I'm in a chess match, I'm in a death trap
I'm tryna find out where the eggs in the nest at
I'm one blood when the sky turns jet black
No love in the world can correct that
I'm in a slow lane, I'm on my Cobain
I'm in the new spot tryna run a old game
I got a new chick, put out my old flame
No peace, no sleep, no love for a young beast
You can put me in a cage
You can put me in the jungle where the lion get blazed
There ain't no hell like the hell I raise
I'd die in the bed I made 'fore I lay with a love I loathe
I'm a snake in the garden of bones
I'm a loner in a world of clones
I'm the piece that don't belong, see I roam
Where the Reaper roam 'till they put my name on a stone

[Hook: Dice Raw]
Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own
Ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walking alone
Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own
Ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walking alone
[Verse 3: Black Thought]
The longest walk I'll probably ever be on
The road to perdition, guess I'm finna get my plea on
I pray these wings strong enough to carry me on
I promise every second felt as if it took an eon
Walking like the lost boys of Sierra Leone
The trail of tears what they got me like a Cherokee on
Between the ears something I require therapy on
For working to the bone like my name Robert Guillaume
I go above and beyond, the duty called, truly y'all
Even though they kind of blew me off like a booty call
Ask me if I'm just another mouli or a movie star
Forced to face the music like a graduate of Juilliard
Walk alone, talk alone, get my Charlie Parker on
Make my mark alone, shed light upon the dark alone
Get my sparkle on, it's a mission I'm embarking on
A kamikaze in the danger zone far from home

[Hook: Dice Raw]
Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own
Ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walking alone
Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own
Ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walking alone"
The Day,The Roots,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: Patty Crash]
When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision, I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

[Verse 1: Blu]
Yeah, it's like everyday I wake up, I stare into space and don't say much
Peer in the mirror, feeling dead from the face up
Coffee pots, cigarettes, morning J's, Baileys
Slowing down my day before it picks up the pace
Beats playing since the night before, thinking about writing songs
Feeling exhausted from times we toured constant
And plus the toxins I sip got me tall
Still tipsy, staring at the city from the spot we call Los Angeles
Every day is like a blank canvas
Carving my initials in the planet like I brand it
Hand picked to live this life we take for granted
Like a child with an upright bass, we can't stand it
Smiling through the trouble we face, tryna manage
My way without pumping my brakes and staying stagnant
Cause I can sit on my ass or just imagine
The madness I did on my path and paint the canvas
[Hook: Patty Crash]
When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision, I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Before I rise and shine like a neon sign
I need the girl of my dreams to give me Einstein
And burn the marijuan' like Buju Banton
It's my only bonafide break from these confines
I need a change of scenery like a montage
These kids bringing me the noise like the Bomb Squad
And everybody coming at me from the blindside
I'm tired, it's hard to open up my eyes wide
I listen to some theme music on the iPod
And walk around the crib doing little odd jobs
Checking my breath, take a view from this high rise
Feeling like I'm checking out a game from the sideline
I got to try different things in these trying times
2010 is different than it was in '9-5
It's come alive time, I picked a fine time
For getting open off life like a fine wine

[Hook: Patty Crash]
When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision, I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
[Verse 3: Phonte]
Uh, yeah, Sunday morning, plan my day out
Whole new blueprint, brand new layout
Deep down still don't know if it'll play out
But for the first time, feel like I done found a way out
Skin getting clearer and it feel like I lost weight
Stop and say a prayer for the times I lost faith
Troubles of the world had me in a cross-face
Chicken-wing, sickening, living so off-base
But now it's like I'm in the last lap of the car chase
And I finally understand my right to choose
My preacher man told me it could always be worse
Even the three-legged dog still got three good legs to lose
So you can stop and refresh the rules
Breathe in, breathe out, let it heal all your exit wounds
Something inside said that's the move
And maybe today I'll restart fresh and new

[Hook: Patty Crash]
When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision, I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

Is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Is gonna be the day"
Black Rose,Klashnekoff,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Klashnekoff]
This is dedicated to a black rose, I bucked her up on road
Skin made of gold and a cocoa butter glow
Got the combo on the go, gave the combos to the codes
07946 double 0..
She said, ""Give me a call and let me know wah blow
We can link and see a show or smoke weed by the river
Watching daffodils blow, you dun know""
As time grows, we expand and grow close
My black rose, I propose we get married
But you’re still in college and I’m shotting green on the corner to make a profit
Staring at the cosmics trying to find the logic
Spitting my life over melancholic beats
But nothing beats, you and I in deep dialogue
My black rose I want to cultivate you neatly
Visualize you and me through my third eye DVD
Babes it’s deep and can’t be described by speech
So I speak through my actions
And treat you like diamonds on consignment
Protect you from the parasites and pirates
I'm prepared to get violent for our love tight like strings on a violin
Momentary silence as she told me she was pregnant
""What pregnant? Babes, I weren’t expecting this""
Embraced her with a kiss overwhelmed with happiness
I know it wasn’t planned and your family’s probably pissed
But it’s too late, the baby’s due June 28th
Your brother’s vexed, your dad dashed you out your mother's place
Said when he die, don't want to see your face at his grave
But fuck him anyway, just pack your suitcase
'Cause from now on, it’s just me and you babe
Babe don’t watch nothing, I got you
[Hook: Stephanie Mills sample]
""Something in the way you make me feel
Feel (I wanna shout), feel
Something in the way you make me feel (Oh)
Feel (You make me feel), feel (I tell you, baby)""

[Verse 2: Klashnekoff]
My dear father when you died I cried blood
So much on my mind that I needed to discuss
But words won’t describe and time is not enough
But trust to my sons I’ll manifest your love
Embrace my young cubs with love and bear hugs
And though the road is rough, I spit my life over dubs
Till my life turn to dust
And as I write these words I’m reminded of the love
And the lessons you taught, still I had to learn the hard way
Through the hard times, you find out who’s your compadres
I stargaze as I blaze high grade
Thinking bout better days before your life got take-away
Couldn’t let you dead in vain, so I took your name
Son of Niah, forever carry your legacy
Until they bury me, yeah
My dear father I love you like cooked food
And I wish you weren’t gone, but I’m dealing with the truth
And every time I hear Sizzla, I'm reminded of you (It’s a rocky road)
And how we cope, only God knows
Walking a thin line between love and hate like a tightrope
And at times when it seems there’s no hope
I still soldier forth holding your picture close
(close to my heart, keep soldiering on)

Acknowledge the rep
I don't know what you cats was thinking
Pay homage, respect
Must've been crazy
Acknowledge the rep
To step up on stage, at CMJ, mention my name

[Verse 1]
I hear these cats, but I ain't listening
A little faint dissing, a little scratch, a little paint missing
But I still gleam and glisten, hot like a stream of piss and
I'm about to have your whole team wishing
That you never got this shit started
You about to be dearly departed
You gotta be nearly retarded
To let me hear my name mentioned, tryna gain attention
Now I'm running through this game lynching
And I heard a few cats tryna take shots on the low
These XFL rappers tryna fuck with a real pro
One thing; who named y'all the High and the Mighty
To me, y'all just sound like a couple of high whities
You had to be on mad coke and ecstasy
To think for a second, you can stand next to me
Look don't ever again mention my name in your freestyles
Or I'll cut off your transmission faster than Lee Myles
And I heard your album, this must be something you're new at
Cause I'd rather hear a Lil' Wayne/Lil' Zane duet
My cellphone stay ringing like a slap in the ear
So I hope y'all don't plan on making rap a career
Cause ever since Heav' was in Vernon I been burning
Next year, y'all be up in Rawkus, interning
And I should've let it known what your government names are
To make sure you Take It Personal like Gang Starr, motherfuckers

Another one, is pointed at your weak ass heart

And believe me, I ain't forget about him, naw
Pay homage, respect
Nope, acknowledge the rep
Just you wait

Yeah I heard of the Boogiemann when I was a youth, scary
And I found out that he was as fake as a tooth-fairy
Since my last mission this nigga's been ass-kissing
I took a minute, I gave your single a fast listen
Tell me this, with no pot to piss in, how you dissing
Your group homes are about to be reporting you missing
And I don't know what was worse, the track or the verse
I'ma get to your producer, but I'm smacking you first
See I couldn't even find one nigga that heard of you
I did find a few cats that wanted to murder you
But I told 'em chill, I let 'em know you was my son
And I promise I can pay support til' you twenty-one
Consider me the clothes on your back and a warm meal
Who knows, this might just get you a deal
And the day that your album go on sale for the first hour
Just remember like Nas nigga, I Gave You Power
I figured I give ya some help, cause you need lots
I make your producer change his name to Speed Nottz
Tell him I say fuck him for doing the tracks
Matter of fact, fuck Fat Beats, for doing the wax
I'ma diss you via e-mail and then through a fax
I'ma diss you by two-way, I ain't gon' never relax
I'ma diss you over fast, slow track or no track
If your shit wasn't so whack, I'd diss you to your track
You that little fish that I catch and I throw back
And by the way, give 50 Cent his flow back
You that cat in the club that get hit with a bottle
Fuckin' with me, you better off tryin' to hit lotto
And don't answer back, this is hard shit to follow
And you can't spit nigga, so you obviously must swallow

[Veres 1: Blu]
Yo, so what you searching for?
From birth, born hurting and yearning for certain somethings
Lurking and murk 'em, got 'em turning this
Bed into a coffin, burning over passions in this passion
Or more or less over what the pastor passed us
Cause see, the past tense, it never really passes
Phases that trap us and cage us like classes
Fogging my glasses, lost in a mass mess
Taskless dilemma to match somebody's status
And I'm average as fuck, no car cats gassing me up
Passing bucks like a casual blunt
Granted, hustling habits on the stump of a mansion
While bums pass, asking for a buck for some bagged bricks
Bad shit going down on the daily
While bad chicks pass in a Mercedes, damn
They say he's the bastard for chasing them
Maybe it's the patterns that make me that made me, crazy

Life is fiction, competition and contradiction
Petty perceptions, window dressing for misdirection
Love is a lotto, I know I know you know what I know
Hope is so hollow, that's why winos follow the bottle
And people pressure, make death a hidden treasure
A guilty pleasure, lonely language inside a letter
It's now or never, move it, move it, love it or lose it
Boys recruited, then included in something stupid
It's things of nature, paid a player and say your prayers
Naysayers, the haters, the major players, the beggars
You 'bout it, 'bout it, don't allow it to pow without it
Then those who doubt it, doomed to die the death of cowards
The world is yours, and the world we can't afford
So ignore the law, start a fire then start a war
If you're sick and tired of your access denied
Free will died long before blogs and iPod

Yo, it's too much strain for nominal gain
I'm going through things; headaches, abdominal pain
Tryna numb it with that Ketel like I'm from the Ukraine
Check the blue flame, lighter running out of butane
What's up with my destructive urge that's unproductive
Choices I'm stuck with, now starting to fuck with
Contaminating family and close friends
Telling me to stop burning the candle at both ends
Ain't like I'm on a coke binge, hanging in dope dens
Or life is just a pool of Patron I'm soaked in
The darker the covenant slash trainwreck for you to rubberneck
You ain't felt the true pain yet so you be loving that
Hit me up at black.gov like the government

That's it, turn the page on the day, walk away
'Cause there's sense in what I say, I'm forty-fifth generation Roman
But I don't know 'em or care when I'm spitting
So return to your sitting position and listen, it's fitting
That I'm miles ahead and they chase me
Show your face on TV then we'll see, you can't do half
My crew laughs at your rhubarb-and-custard verses
You rain down curses, but I'm waving your hearses driving by
Streets riding high with the beats in the sky
All stare, eyes glazed, garage burnt down
The fire raged for forty days and in forty ways
But through the blaze, they see it fade
The sea of black, the beaming heat on their faces
Then a figure emerges from the wastage
Eyes transfixed with a piercing gaze
One hand clutching his sword, raised to the sky
They wonder how, they wonder why
The sky turns white, it all becomes clear
They felt lifted from their fears
They shed tears in the light after six dark years
Young bold soldiers, the fire burns, cracks and smoulders
Five years older and wiser
The fires are burning, on fire, never tire
Slay warriors in the forests and on higher, we sing
Hear the strings rising, the war's over, the bells ring
Memories fading, soldiers slaying, looks like geezers raving
The hazy fog over the Bullring, the lazy ways the birds sing
A new baby's born every day, few men may be scorned today
But look at things the other way
'Cause it may well be your final day
And then the crowds roar, they slay, they all say
I produced this using only my bare wit
Give me a jungle or garage beat and admit defeat
Use war and past injury as my metaphor and simile
Get all applications in to me before the deadline
'Cause it's a fine line between strifeful crimes and a life of crime
But you will reach the day
And it's all mine, you can take it or leave it
I shake and reveal stage tricks like Jimi Hendrix
In the afterlife, gladiators meet their maker
Float through the wheat fields and lakes of blue water
To the next life from the fortress
Away from the knives and slaughter
To their wives and daughters
Once more before the Lord judges over all of us
It's in this place you'll see me
Brace yourself, 'cause this goes deep
I'll show you the secrets, the sky and the birds
Actions speak louder than words
Stand by me, my apprentice
Be brave, clench fists"

Live Fast Die Young,Rick Ross,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
And I wanna show you how you all look like beautiful stars tonight
Oh he sounding good!

[Hook: Kanye West & (Rick Ross)]
They say we can't be livin' like this for the rest of our lives
Well we gon' be livin' like this for the rest of tonight
And you know they gon' be bangin' this shit
For the rest of our lives, so live fast (live fast)
And die young (die young), live fast (live fast)
And die young (die young), live fast, and die young

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Livin' fast, now it's all linen rags
Hard-headed, but my top peelin' back
Tinted glass on my '57, nigga wit' a attitude (Me)
Young and radical, methods are mathematical
Let my convertible marinate on the avenue
Mami, that's half a million, I'm livin' la vida rapido
Die young, but fuck it, we flew first class
Turned you to a rich bitch by your first glass
Up in this bitch and we lit up like a screen
Every time we hit the charts, niggas shoot up like a fiend
Stuntin' like we printin' money with machines
What you see me wavin', Vacheron Constantine
Like Mike, my Spikes stay all white
Twenty-four karat gold, eighty carats worth of ice
Ice insured, fuck life insurance
I live for the moment, and put a bullet on that (Bawse)
Got the club rockin' like a fuckin' boat
I'm the pirate on this ship, all you mates got to go
Good party over here, everybody over here
You know the word travel fast, everybody know we here
All the bottles over here, even spread it over there
All the models over here, but they swallow everywhere
She came to party like it's 1999
If she died on my dick, she would live through my rhymes
[Hook: Kanye West & (Rick Ross)]
They say we can't be livin' like this for the rest of our lives
Well we gon' be livin' like this for the rest of tonight
And you know they gon' be bangin' this shit
For the rest of our lives, so live fast (live fast)
And die young (die young), live fast (live fast)
And die young (die young), live fast, and die young

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
For all my young ladies ladies that drivin' Miss Daisy
Drivin' me crazy, rock the beat, baby
Hop up out the (ERR!) she eat up the pavement
I don't give a (ERR!) baby, he crazy
I'm back by unpopular demand
'Least he still poppin' in Japan, shoppin' in Milan
Hoppin' out the van, screams from the fans
""Yeezy, always knew you'd be on top again!""
And we 'bout to hit Jacob the Jeweler
So I can be like Slick Rick, and rule ya
Dr. Martin Louis the King, Junior
And I'mma never let the dream turn to Kruegers
My outfit so disrespectful
You can go 'head and sneeze cause my presence blessed you
I mean, we walked in this bitch so stylish
Niggas done mistook me for my stylist
And I know it's superficial and you say it's just clothes
But we shoppin' in that motherfucker and they just closed
So go ahead and just pose
When she walked up out the dressing room, the store just froze
And I know they tryna get they cool back
And them ghetto bitches hollin' ""How you do that?""
Uhh, so they could never say we never lived it
And if I see Biggie tonight, I loved every minute
[Hook: Kanye West]
They say we can't be livin' like this for the rest of our lives
Well we gon' be livin' like this for the rest of tonight
And you know they gon' be bangin' this shit
For the rest of our lives, so live fast
And die young, live fast
And die young, live fast, and die young

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Peter Piper pickin' peppers, Rick pitch poems
My leather long enough to keep a thick bitch warm
When that ass is enormous, abs abnormal
And tans in the morning on sands in California
Seems like we gettin' money for the wrong things
Look around, Maseratis for the whole team
Look at Haiti, children dyin' round the clock, nigga
I sent a hundred grand, but that's a decent watch, nigga
I'm gettin' better, cause it woulda leased a drop, nigga
I'mma get my money right, just watch, nigga
She had a miscarriage, I couldn't cry, though
Cause you and I know she was only my side hoe
Uh, I got 'em catchin' amnesia
Time to pull my fuckin' minks out the freezer
See the lynx and you just think, ""Jesus!""
I'm hot 'til the day they freeze us
Young and radical, methods are mathematical
I'm multiplyin' my money through different avenues
Took many to war, shook never before
For my mother I applaud Ms. Afeni Shakur
Ice insured, fuck life insurance
Three bad bitches, don't come concurrent
Still, you know the dope won't stop
And if I die today bury me in a dope-ass watch
[Hook: Kanye West]
They say we can't be livin' like this for the rest of our lives
Well we gon' be livin' like this for the rest of tonight
And you know they gon' be bangin' this shit
For the rest of our lives, so live fast, and die young
Live fast, and die young, live fast, and die young"
What Goes Around,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Salaam Remi]

[Intro: Nas]
Yeah

[Chorus: Nas]
Ayo, it's poison
Ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned, they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescriptin' us medicine which is poison
Doctors injectin' our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison
Niggas up in my hood be gettin' shot, given poison

[Verse 1: Nas]
In hospitals, shots riddle the block
Little children and elderly women run for they lives
Drizzlin' rain come out the sky every time somebody dies
Must be out my fuckin' mind, what is this, the hundredth time?
Sendin' flowers to funerals, readin' ""Rest In Peace""
You know, the usual, death comes in threes
""Life is short"" is what some nigga said
Not if you measure life by how one lives and what he did
And funny how these black-killer companies is makin' money off us
Fast food, Cola, soda, Skull and Bone crosses
[Chorus 2: Nas]
It's all poison
Ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned, they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescriptin' us medicine which is poison
Doctors injectin' our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison
Sisters up in my hood try to do good, given choices

[Verse 2: Nas]
When pregnant, drop out of school or have abortions
Stop workin', hopin' that they find a man that will support them
Up late night, on they mother's cordless
Thinkin' a perm or bleachin' cream will make them better, when they gorgeous
White girls tannin', liposuction
Fake titties are implanted, fake lips, that's life destruction
Light-skinned women, bi-racial, hateful
Toward themselves, denyin' even they blood
I don't judge Tiger Woods, but I
Overstand the mental poison that's even worser than drugs

[Chorus 3: Nas]
Yo, it's poison
Ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned, they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescriptin' us medicine which is poison
Doctors injectin' our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison
Radio and TV, poison
White Jesus, poison
And any thoughts of takin' me down is poison
Who want beef now? My heat shall anoint them, plaow
[Interlude: Nas]
Never to worry
All the wrong-doers got it comin' back to 'em a thousand times over
Every dog has its day, and everything flips around
Even the most greatest nation in the world has it comin' back to 'em
Everybody reaps what they sows, that's how it goes
Innocent lives will be taken, it may get worse
But we'll get through it, y'all, be strong

[Verse 3: Nas]
The China-man built the railroad
The Indians saved the Pilgrim
And in return, the Pilgrim killed 'em
They call it Thanksgiving, I call your holiday ""Hell-day""
'Cause I'm from poverty, neglected by the wealthy
Me and my niggas share gifts e'ryday like Christmas
Slay bitches, and party e'ryday like this is the last
I'm with my heckles, connectin' and we hittin' the lab
This is my level, fuck if it get you mad

[Chorus 4: Nas]
It's all poison
All of my words to enemies, it is poison
Rappers only talk about keys, it's all poison
How could you call yourself MC's? You ain't poison
Think about the kids you mislead with the poison
And any thoughts of takin' me down is all poison
Who want beef now? My heat shall anoint them, plaow
[Bridge: Keon Bryce & Nas]
What goes around comes around, my nigga
And what goes up, it must come down, my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground, my nigga
Just hold it down, we older now, my nigga
What goes around comes around, my nigga
And what goes up, it must come down, my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground, my nigga (Uh)
Just hold it down, we older now, my nigga

[Verse 4: Nas]
This nigga Ike with the Iverson jersey, light-skinned with herpes
Fuckin' sisters in Harlem, Brooklyn and D.C
This is the problem, 'cause he never tell 'em he got it
From lettin' fags suck him off, Rikers Island in '93
Drives a Benz, hangs at all the parties
All the concerts, backstage where the stars be
Rockin' they shirts in bitches' faces like clockwork
""What's your name? Where you from?""
Chain blingin', thinkin' girls everywhere is dumb
Takin' pride in ruinin' their lives
So they could never have babies, and they could never be wives
He never used a condom, give him head? He got ya
Met the wrong bitch and now he dead from the monster AIDS
I contemplate, believin' in karma
Those on top could just break and won't be eatin' tomorrow
I know some bitches who be sleepin' on niggas' dreams
They leave, when that nigga blow, she the first bitch on her knees
Knowin' dudes that's neglectin' they seeds
Instead of takin' care of 'em, they spendin' money on trees
I pray for you deadbeat daddies 'cause when them kids get grown
It's too late for you, now you old and you gettin' shitted on
It's all scientific, mystic, you know, the Earth and the stars
Don't hesitate to say you heard it from Nas
What is destined shall be
George Bush-killer 'til George Bush kills me
Much blessings, be healthy, remember

[Bridge: Keon Bryce]
What goes around comes around, my nigga
And what goes up, it must come down, my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground, my nigga
Just hold it down, we older now, my nigga
What goes around comes around, my nigga
And what goes up, it must come down, my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground, my nigga
Just hold it down, we older now, my nigga"
Black President,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Barack Obama]
They said this day would never come
They said our sights were set too high
This country is too divided, too disillusioned
To ever come together around a common purpose. They said

[Chorus: Johnny Polygon (2Pac sample)]
(""Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president"")
(""Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president"")
Yes we can change the world, the world, the world
{CHANGE THE WORLD...} they say
(""Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president"")
(""Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president"")
Yes we can, change the world
The world, the world, the WORLD...

[Verse 1: Nas]
They forgot us on the block, got us in the box
Solitary confinement: how violent are these cops?
They need a early retirement
How many rallies will I watch? I ain't got it in me to march
I got a Semi to spark, the game's in a drought
Public housing, projects, cooking up in the Pyrex
My set, my clique, either getting money
Or running from homicide trial, that's if they ain't died yet
Trying to be rich, still I'm pledging allegiance
A predicate felon, a ghetto leader
Lending my poetical genius, to whoever may need it
I bleed this from Queensbridge, now living with my feet up
Never defeated, so a president's needed
You know these colored folks and Negros hate to see
One of their own succeeding
America: surprise us and let a black man guide us, uhh
[Chorus: Johnny Polygon (2Pac sample)]
(""Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president"")

The world, the world, the WORLD...

[Verse 2: Nas]
What's the black pres' thinking on election night?
Is it: ""How can I protect my life?
Protect my wife? Protect my rights?""
Every other president was nothing less than white
Except Thomas Jefferson had mixed Indian blood.. and Calvin Coolidge
KKK is like: ""What the fuck?!"", loading their guns up
Loading up mine too, ready to ride
'Cause I'm riding with my crew - he dies, we die too
Yeah, but on the positive side
I think Obama provides hope and challenges minds
Of all races and colors to erase the hate
And try to love one another, so many political snakes
We in need of a break, I'm thinking I can trust this brother
...but will he keep it way real?
Every innocent nigga in jail gets out on appeal
When he wins, will he really care still?
I feel

[Verse 3: Nas]
Say a prayer for ""Do we have to?""
You ain't right, Jeremiah Wrong pastor
In love with a slave master
Sincerely yours, USA's most brave rapper
Jesse carjacker, Uncle Tom kidnapper
Ask around: Bentley coupe off the Richter
Bitch called ""Life"": I pimped her, what
Politics, politricks, Klan-shooter
Deacon for defense, progress-producer
Nothing on the stove, a survival-booster
Gotta do what we gotta do
We ain't got no governors coming through to help
Anything we need done, gotta do for self
New, improved JFK on the way
It ain't the 60s again, niggas ain't hippies again
We ain't falling for the same traps
Standing on the balconies where they shot the King at
McCain got apologies; ain't nobody hearing that
People need honesty
[Chorus: Johnny Polygon (2Pac sample)]

We ain't ready, to have a black president"")

They say, ""Hola, Hovito""
That's what they sayin' when I roll up with my people
My music bangin' like vatos locos, got rap in a chokehold
And I won't surrender it with beats by Timbaland
Cállate la boca, my baby
All I want to do is stroke you all crazy
My dick game is vicious, insane at bitches
Mami keep comin' back 'cause mami came vicious
Catch Hov in the drop, nasty thang, lane switchin'
Once you turn your neck for a sec, your dame's missin'
Bujando, bujando, the cops is comin'
Got that rap patrol behind, yo, get to runnin'
I'm unstoppable Hov, untoppable flows

Yeah, yeah
Naw, I don't fuck around, stay on my J-O
Hov been about that dough since I was a day old
Oh, push perico if I need to for the root of evil
Was born in the belly, that's the way the streets breed you
One life to live, notice you get no sequel
So I truly got to live this like my last movie
Six, ooh-wee, jewels drippin', big tooly
I ball for real, y'all niggas is Sam Bowie
And with the third pick, I made the earth sick
MJ, him Jay, fadeaway perfect
I rhyme sicker than every rhyme spitter
Every crime nigga that rhyme or touch a mic, because my mind's quicker
I'm a '88er, nine-six a reasonable doubt
Temper short, don't take much to squeeze you out
Yeah, you shinin', but the only thing you're leavin' out
You're a candle in the sun, that shit don't even out

Hold up, naw, motherfuckers
Y'all motherfuckers better run to the post office and get a job, motherfuckers
Or starve, motherfuckers
'Cause Jay's been the only one eatin' thus far, subpar motherfuckers
Naw, even though y'all hate, I love y'all motherfuckers
Friend or foe, y'all all my motherfuckers
If you haven't heard, I'm Michael, Magic, and Bird
All rolled in one
'Cause none got more flows than Young
Plus got more flows to come
And if I ain't better than Big, I'm the closest one
So move over, hoes, choose Hova
My food for thought so hot, it give you dudes ulcers
Rovers, roasters, hoes is
Gettin' it in with me, livin' like they supposed to
Watches, chain, front row at the game
Sold-out arena, all screamin' my name, c'mon

When it's rainin' inside and you're all alone
All alone, yeah!

Take a little trip, hater, pack up your mind
Look forward, not behind, then you'll see what you find
I caught a sucker dyin' 'cause he thought he could rhyme
Now if his momma is a quarter daughter must be a dime
I gotta meet her, don't take no shorts, I don't use abbrevi-
-ation, I don't even play the radio neither
Only if I need to know the sports or the weather
I'm a cool type of brother, but yep, your head I'll sever from the neck
See ain't nothing changed, hit the stage
Set a date, sucker, in battle we can engage
I'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you
Throw the Porsche at you, is what I'm forced to do
With my back against the wall, crack his back, y'all
Naw, it ain't went nowhere like havin' hair with stylin' gel in it
Throw a curl in it
Dread that nappy shit up, throw a shell in it
Whatever floats your boat, or finds your lost remote
And this for them niggas workin' at the airport who got laid off
I take my shades off
If you look straight in my eyes, you still might see a disguise

Player, I grind, my focus is crime
Raw with the rhyme, I'm slick with the slime
My words are diamonds dug out a mine
Spit 'em, polish, look how they shine
Glitter, glisten, gloss, floss
I catch a beat running like Randy Moss
Ride that bitch off like a brand new horse
I'm rollin' my stones, gather no moss
Mommy, I'm coming, I hope you get off
Or rock your own boat like Aaliyah, then talk
Back, back, forth, forth
Get that sailor on course, course
Make that track a corpse, corpse
Rap, roll, utterly rocked
With my mouth to the mic and my hand on my cock
Cadillac OutKast, just won't stop

Turn on the TV and everything is lookin' dismal
Went in the bathroom medicine cabinet, Pepto-Bismol
Need it for my stomach 'cause my tummy kinda aches
Like a junkie on withdrawal, fresh up off the plate
Wait, back to the enemy of the state
Is the Republicans or Democratic candidate?
Debate, now even the black box hold the fate
Clueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break
Hate, extreme prejudice, let's dismiss this
If you want to, you can dub it to your hit list
I know you goin' to, we in this to replenish yo' musical wish list
When it come to this music, we stay relentless
Pursuing all that's pursuable
Doing, God-willing, all things that are doable
The only liable limitation is yourself, Dre

Whos the Mack?,Ice Cube,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Sir Jinx & The Bomb Squad]

[Intro]
One of these motherfuckers is different
Straight gangsta mack
Straight gangsta mack
Straight gangsta mack
Straight gangsta mack

[Verse 1]
Who's the mack? Is it some brother in a big hat
Thinking he can get any bitch with a good rap?
Rolling in a fucked-up Lincoln
Leaning to the side so it looks like he's sinking
Into that leopard interior
This nigga think every girl's inferior
To his tongue, get a dumb bitch sprung
As she's selling more butt and don't even get a cut of the money
His name is Sonny and he know the play
And hope to god that he don't find a runaway
That's looking to become a star
He'll have your ass in and out of every car
With every Ron and Rick, sucking every John's dick
Come short of the money, get your ass kicked
You don't like it but you still call him hunk
Last night the nigga put yo' ass in the trunk
You wanna leave, but Sonny started talking fast
And it make you wanna go and sell more ass
He's getting rich, you his bitch and it's like that
Now ask yourself, who's the mack?
[Verse 2]
Who's the mack? It is that fool that wanna pump the gas
Give you a sad story and you give him cash?
He start macking and macking and you sucking
Quick to say I'm down on my luck, and
You give a dollar or a quarter and he's on his way
Then you see his sorry ass the next day
Are you the one getting played like a sucka?
Or do you say, ""Get a job, motherfucka?""
Every day, the story gets better
He's wearing dirty pants and a funky-ass sweater
He claims he wants to get something to eat
But every day you find yourself getting beat
He get your money and he run across the street
Don't look both ways 'cause he's in a daze
And almost get his ass hit for the crack
Now ask yourself, who's the mack?

[Verse 3]
Who's the Mack? Is it that nigga in the club
Asking ""have you ever been in a hot tub?""
I know the game, so I watch it unfold
When I see a boy pinned to your earlobe
He's talking shit and you crack a smile
When he tell you that he can go buck wild
For a girl like you and make it feel good
You know it's drama, but it sound real good
He started dragging and hopefully he can start tagging
The pussy so he can keep bragging
He say, ""I'm 'a leave baby, can you go with me?""
You wanna do it but you feeling like a H-O-E
You grab his hand, you leave and it's over
Cause the nigga ain't nothing but a rover
Ya knew the game and you still ended up on your back
Now ask yourself, who's the mack?
[Verse 4]
Macking is the game and everybody's playing
And as long as you believe what they saying
Consider them a M-A-C-K and with no delay
They are gonna get all the play
But when it comes to me, save the drama for your mama
It's Ice Cube and you know that I'm a
Mack in my own right when it comes to rhyme and rap
Cause all I do is kick facts
Unlike Iceberg Slim
And all of them be claimin' be P-I-M-P
No, I'm not going out that way
I'm just a straight up N-I-double-G-A
Next time, you get over on a fool
And you did the shit like real smooth
Thank Ice Cube for giving up the facts
And ask yourself, ""Who's the Mack?""

Inside fish sticks, outside tartar sauce
Pocket full of celery, imagine what she tellin' me
Blowin' on asparagus, the realest shit I ever smoked
Ridin' to that Trap or Die, the realest shit I ever wrote
They know I got that broccoli, so I keep that Glock on me
Don't get caught without one, coming from where I'm from

I lost the only girl in the world that know me best
I got the money and the fame, man, that don't mean shit
I got the Jesus on a chain, man, that don't mean shit
'Cause when the Jesus pieces can't bring me peace
Yo, I need just at least, ugh, one of Russell's nieces
On, I let my nightmares go
I put on everybody that I knew from the 'Go

Once again, it's the sinister cynical minister Shady
Kryptonite to Superman, he's a dentist to Amy
Administerer of the pain, he just finished huffin' the paint
And muffler fumes like it was nothin', because it ain't
Anything in his way, his enemies he just slays
His venom he sprays, reaches like beams of energy rays
Menacing stares, he glares, making the hairs
All on the back of ya neck stand like Dracula, yep
Spectacular rep, he's a tarantula, gargantuan
Yeah, Angela, so I command ya to start dancin'
Part Manson, part Hannibal, part mechanical shark
Throwing animal parts at Scarlett Johansson
Enter my gas chamber, you gangsta? My ass
He's got his fangs to your neck, he's set to strangle ya ass, hater
You're facin' a task greater, he's chasin' your ass
He's got his face in a mask, your blood stains on his glass table

[Verse 2]
I'm checking the exposure of photos of me exposing
Myself locked inside of a cozy hotel posing
With or without clothing, next to the decomposing
Bodies eroding while I'm dozing off, overdosing
Windows opening, shutting; doors opening, closing
I think there's a ghost, too much hydrocodone and codeine
I was only 'sposed to swallow a half, I took the whole thing
I'm not joking, I think I just snorted my nose ring
I need a drink, I'm standing over the sink hosing
Myself, self-loathing, cause I'm on a brink, mostly
I don't wanna think; this will make everything rosy
Beverly sings, scream while I'm severing three toesies
Totally frozen while I close in
I'm yodelling ""Rosie, won't you come out to play?""
And no sense wasting time, cutting and pasting headlines
In the papers, making shrines of my crimes and capers
My words are whirlwinds, I murder my girlfriends
Go to Europe and put Nurofens in my syrup and stirred 'em
You never heard 'em like this, so don't encourage him
The neurosurgeon, coke mirrors, and lyrics worse than
The kinda person to get Katie Couric to cursin'
Eighty spirits of ladies cause Shady murdered the virgins
Crazy turn of events  that he emerged
Took over the world and reeled in all the children
Lured 'em into the building and killed 'em
Buried 'em in the mulch and mildew and he will do what he feels
And still can spin, straw to gold like Rumplestilskin
Cotton to silk, Motrin to Tylenol 3 pills
The Real Slim Shady's entered the buildin'
There's nothing but crumbled leaves and tumbleweeds up in this bitch
Mildred, he's ill with it, he still shouldn't be healed
There's no one as sick as he, MC's will get fricassed on the grill, then"

You're walkin' down a horror corridor
It's almost four in the mornin' and you're in a
Nightmare, it's horrible, right there's the coroner
Waiting for ya to turn the corner so he can corner ya
You're a goner, he's onto ya
Out the corner of his cornea, he just saw ya run
All you want is to rest 'cause you can't run anymore, you're done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody is watching in the party, applauding it
Here I sit, while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplating my next plot again
Swallowin' a Klonopin while I'm noddin' in and out on the ottoman
At the Ramada Inn, holding onto the pill bottle, then
Lick my finger and swirl it 'round the bottom
And make sure I got all of it
Wake up naked at McDonald's with
Blood all over me, dead bodies behind the counter, shit
Guess I must've just blacked out again—not again!

It's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and

Sitting nude in my living room, it's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube, maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel until I find Hannah Montana then
I reach for the aloe and lanolin, bust all over the wall panellin'
Dismantlin' every candle on top of the fireplace mantel and
Grab my flannel and my bandana, then
Kiss the naked mannequin man again
You can see him standin' in my front window if you look in
I'm just a hooligan who's used to using hallucinogens
Causin' illusions again, brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin, razors, scissors, and pins
Jesus, when does it end? Phases that I go through
Dazed and I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who gave these molecules to
Me, what am I gon' do?
Hey, the prodigal son, the diabolical one
Very methodical when I slaughter them

I cut and I slash, slice and gash, last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I had that
Much fun off a half-pint of the Jack, my last Vic and-a-half
A flashlight up Kim Kardashian's ass
I remember the first time I dismembered a family member
December, I think it was, I was having drinks with my cousin
I wrapped him in Christmas lights
Pushed him into the stinkin' tub, cut him up into pieces
And just when I went to drink his blood
I thought, ""I oughta drink his bathwater, that oughta be fun""
That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me, that might be an artery, son
Your blood-curdling screams just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 a.m. and here I come, so you should probably run
A secret passageway around here, man, there's got to be one
Oh no, there's probably none
He can scream all that he wants, top of his lungs
But ain't no stopping me from chopping him up-up, 'cause…

A six-pack and A Streetcar Named Desire
Who got my back? In the line of fire, holding back
What? My peoples; if you with me, where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped and they tryna twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm
What the blood clot? We smoke pot, and blow spots
You wanna think twice? I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums

[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loop my voice on the LP
Martini on the slang rocks, certified chatterbox
Vocabulary 'Donna talking, tell your story walking
Take cover, kid, what? Run for your brother, kid
Run for your team and your ""six can't rhyme"" groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
My deadly notes reign supreme
Your thought is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts, paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought
I got the fashion catalogs for all y'all to all praise due to God
[Interlude: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang

[Verse 4: U-God]
Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow for
Judgment Day cometh, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape Hell, globe spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky Golden Arms
Tunes spit the shitty Mortal Kombat sound
The fake false step make the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss catwalk, squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anesthesias
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe kill adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sipping on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring kings

[Verse 5: RZA]
March of the wooden soldiers, C-Cypher-Punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square, we stand bold like flare
Escape from your dragon's lair
In particular, my beats travel like a vortex
Through your spine to the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Heart terminal like Grand Central Station
Program fat bass lines on Novation
Getting drunk like I'm fucking ducking five-year probation
[Verse 6: GZA]
War of the masses, the outcome disastrous
Many of the victim families save their ashes
A million names on walls, engraved in plaques
Those who went back received penalties for the acts
Another heart is torn as close ones mourn'
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song

[Verse 7: Masta Killa]
The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
93 million miles away from
Came one to represent the Nation
This is a gathering of the masses
That come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The high chief Jamel Irief takes the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save self from
This relentless attack of the track spares none

[Verse 8: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo, yo, fuck that!
Look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lamping like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink
You had a navy green salamander fiend
Bitches never heard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in '81
Sound convincing, thousand dollar cork-pop convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission
Hold the fuck up, I'll unfasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, black Noble Drew Ali, came in threes
We like the Genovese, sazon season these degrees
It's Earth, 93 million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz

[Verse 9: Raekwon]
A-yo, that's amazing
Gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul hawk
Connect thoughts to make my man child walk
Swift notarizer, Blue-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York Yank visor, word tranquilizer
Adjust the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see y'all, the number one draft pick
Tear down the beat, God, then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor, flex the white gold tarantula
Track truck diesel, play the weed God substantiala
Max mostly, undivided then slide in sickening
Guaranteed made 'em jump like Rod Strickland"

[Verse 1: U-God]
Raw I'ma give it to ya with no trivia
Raw like cocaine straight from Bolivia
My hip-hop will rock and shock the nation
Like the Emancipation Proclamation
Weak MCs approach with slang that's dead
You might as well run into the wall and bang your head
I'm pushin' force, my force you're doubtin'
I'm makin' devils cower to the Caucasus Mountains

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Well, I'm a sire, I set the microphone on fire
Rap styles vary and Carey like Mariah
I come from the Shaolin slum, and the isle I'm from
Is comin' through with nuff niggas and nuff guns
So if you wanna come sweatin', stressin', contestin'
You'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
Phony niggas are outlined in chalk
I'm mad vexed, it's what the projects made me
Rebel to the grain, there's no way to barricade me
Steamrollin' niggas like an 18 wheeler
With a drunk driver drivin', there's no survivin'
[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Rough like Timberland wear, yeah!
Me and the Clan in 'Yota Landcruisers out there
Peace to all the crooks, all the niggas with bad looks
Bald heads, braids, blow this hook
We pack chrome TECs, nickel-plated MACs, black Ac's!
Drug-dealin' styles in phat stacks
I only been a good nigga for a minute though
'Cause I gots to get my props and win it, yo
I got beef with commercial-ass niggas with gold teeth
Lampin' in a Lexus, eatin' beef
Straight up and down, don't even bother
I got 40 niggas up in here now who kill niggas' fathers!

[Chorus: Method Man]
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?!
In the front! In the back! Killa Beez on attack!
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?!
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats!

[Verse 4: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Here I go, deep type flow
Jacques Cousteau could never get this low
I'm cherry bombin' shits… BOOM!
Just warmin' up a little bit (Vroom-vroom!)
Rappinin' is what's happenin'
Keep the pockets stacked and then hands clap and then
At the party when I move my body
Gotta get up and be somebody!
Grab the microphone, put strength to the bone
DUH DUH DUH… enter the Wu-Tang zone
Sure enough when I rock that stuff, huff, puff
I'm gonna catch your bluff, tuff, rough
Kickin' rhymes like Jim Kelly
Or Alex Haley, I'm a nuh… Beetle Bailey rhymes
Comin' raw style, hardcore
Niggas be comin' to the hip-hop store
Comin' to buy grocery from me
Pretendin' to be a hip-hop MC
The law — in order to Enter the Wu-Tang
You must bring the Ol' Dirty Bastard type slang
Represent the GZA, Abbot — RZA
Shaquan, Inspectah Deck
Dirty Ho gettin' low with his flow
Introducin' the Ghostface Killah!
No one could get iller!

Speakin' of the Devil, psych!
No, it's the God, get ya shit right!
Mega trife, and yo, I killed you in a past life
On the mic while you was kickin' that fast shit
You reneged, tried again, and got blasted
Half-mastered-ass style, mad ruff task
When I struck, I had on Timbs and a black mask
Remember that shit? I know you don't remember jack!
That night, yo I was hittin' like a spiked bat!
Until you thought I was bugged out and crazy
Strapped for nonsense, after me became lazy
Yo, nobody budge while I shot slugs
Never shot thugs, I'm runnin' with thugs that flood mugs
So, grab your eight-plus-one, start flippin' and trippin'
Niggas is jettin', I'm lickin' off, son

Wu! Tang! Wu! Tang!
Wu! Tang! Wu! Ta-a-ang!

Homicide's illegal and death is the penalty
What justifies the homicide when he dies in his own iniquity?
It's the master of the Mantis Rapture comin' at ya
We have an APB on an MC Killa!
Looks like the work of a Masta
Evidence indicates that his stature
Merciless like a terrorist, hard to capture
The flow changes like a chameleon
Plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger
This technique attacks the immune system
Disguised like a lie, paralysin' the victim
You scream as it enters your bloodstream
Erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
Movin' on a nigga with the speed of a centipede
And injure any motherfuckin' contender!

After laughter comes tears

[Verse 1: RZA]
Check the script, me and the gods gettin' ripped
Blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip
Had a box, 'boom boom' the bass would blast
We was laughin' at all the girls that passed
Conversation, brothers had began to discuss
(Hey yo, Rob, remember that kid you bust?)
Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far
'Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha
Not knowin' exactly what lied ahead
My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread
Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer
Didn't expect to come across a crazy gunner
""Hey, Shorty, check it, run the bag and the dough!""
But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said ""No!""
Money splattered him, BOW! Then he snatched the bag
Hit his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave
Girls screamin', the noise up and down the block
(Hey, Rakeem!) What? (Your little brother got shot!)
I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet
I saw the blood all over the hot concrete
I picked him up, then I held him by his head
His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was…
Aw man! How do I say goodbye?
It's always the good ones that have to die
Memories in the corner of my mind
Flashbacks, of us laughin' all the time
I taught him all about the bees and birds
But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words
[Chorus]
After laughter comes tears

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Me and my man, my ace Big Moe from the shelter
'Bout to hit the skins from this girl named Thelma
Now, Thelma had a rep that was higher than her neck
Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect
We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed
Three o'clock in the mornin', somethin' got to give
Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next
Here, take this raincoat and practice safe sex!
He seemed to ignore, I said, ""Be for real!
She's not even worth it to go raw deal.""
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
He got butt-naked and stuck the power U
Twenty minutes went by, Moe, I'm out without a doubt
I'm not pumpin' up, I am airin' out
Hey yo, he came out laughin' with glory
I'm surprised he's still livin' to tell his story
But he carried on with the same old stuff
With Stephanie, like a Whammy, he pressed his luck
Moe tried to be down with O.P.P
Ain't nothin' wrong, but he got caught with the H.I.V
Now no life to live, doc says two more years
So after the laughter I guess comes the tears

After laughter comes tears"
What They Do,The Roots,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: Raphael Saadiq]
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yo, yo
Lost generation, fast-paced nation
World population confront they frustration
The principles of true hip-hop have been forsaken
It's all contractual and about money-makin'
Pretend-to-be cats don't seem to know they limitation
Exact replication and false representation
You wanna be a man? Then stand your own
To emcee require skills, I demand some shown
I let the frauds keep frontin' and roam like a cellular phone
Far from home, givin' crowds what they wantin'
Official hip-hop consumption, The Fifth thumpin'
Keepin' your party jumpin' with an original somethin'
Yo, I dedicate this to the one-dimensional
No imagination, excuse for perpetration
My man came over and said, ""Yo, we thought we heard you""
Joke's on you; you heard a bitin'-ass crew, but, um

Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Thin is the line that run between love and hatred
The game is ill-natured, it's nothin' sacred
Aiyo, it's funny what I see some rap niggas do to make it
A few'll blow up, or go as far as they can take it
My nine-to-five is just to hit ya, get the party live
I'm Black Thought, used to rap for sport
Now the rhyme-sayin', rent-payin' life support
I take it very seriously within this industry
It's various crews that try to touch me
But I come with the beautiful things, and I bless the track plushly
Around the world crowds love me from doin' tours
Recipient of applause from all of you and yours
Creator of original sounds that's in the stores
You take home to absorb and sweat it out your pores
Now, who can stop the music runnin' through these veins?
Infinitely go against the grain, that's why my motto's to

Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

Livin' the life of limos and lights
Airplanes and trains, short days and long nights
Keyboards and mics, bass chords and drum kicks
And my mental thick, they hit my head like brick
As I embark on a mission, welcomin' to the dark
When I first spark the art's when the listenin' start
Open your head wide, and let the Thought inside
My style fortified by all of Philadelph-i
My delph more stealth than all the wicked wealth-y
Mentality undetectable by the naked eye
Then I get paid when the record is played
To put it short, ""I want it made"" like Ed, 'nuff said
Then after that, I'm puttin' on my cousin Hamed
We let the ladies blend with the dark-skinned thoroughbred
And discover, my level is that of no other
And Roots crew reign official and true while I'm continuin' to

Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

The Lesson Pt. 1,The Roots,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Lyrically versatile, my rap definition is wild
I wrote graffiti as a juvenile
Restin' on deuce trey and used to boost gray Kangol's
With 555 Souls from the streets of the Illadelph-iadic insane
For monetary gain, niggas is slain on the train
It's homicide for wealth, stealth missions for crack
In the alleyways where niggas get grazed in the back
From stray shots, clips with hollow tips, for your spine
Or either remain calm, catch a rhyme to your mind
Niggas, ya know my style
I run a-motherfuckin-rap-mok with Malik in a U-Haul truck
I stand 5'7"", in command of the party and scam like Uncle Sam
I'm never caught up in the glass eye of your action cam
'Cause I'm down low, artistic, exquisite rap pro that get the dough
It's the Philly borough dread thoroughbred for dolo
I bag solo, like a nigga that boost Polo
Steppin' through the corridor of metaphors
Lookin' over my left shoulder, the mic still feel colder than before
With this jazz shit, I hit your jaw
Dice Raw, get up on the mic, my young poor
I be the nigga blowin' up the spot on tour
Surely real to the core, old school like '84
I never die, and raps 'til my lungs collapse
Then relax until my knack for tracks bring it back
On time, when I rhyme my rep remain
Either go against the grain or your ass is found slain
I overcome, niggas want styles, then I throw you some
Show you some, get on the mic and take it over, son
Dice Raw, the motherfuckin' Wild Noid
Get on the mic and perpetrate in this void
[Verse 2: Dice Raw]
I leave niggas missin' in action like their dads in the projects
My style like an nomad, travel 'round and catch wreck
I'm ill versatile with the skill, no more
Wack MC's wanna flex but their styles, they bore
Got to know the real meanin' of the ill shit, kid
I do mad damage but never will catch a bid
With my knapsack, full of ill shit that I just boosted
From the corner store when I let loose more
Flavor that's me, rippin' heads off from the seams
Niggas didn't play like Jeru and ""Come Clean""
[He heh ha ha ha] I beat down on they heads like drum machines
Or 808's 'cause my style flows out great
And super spectac' with all the raw rap
Pull a metal chair out my knapsack across your back ka-crack
Now do you feel the pain? Of course
I guess you're believin' that I'm insane
When I'm taggin' my name upon the train, I got so much pride
I got so much soul, with lyrics hot
To make niggas stop, drop and roll
Now, check me out one time for your ass
Fat styles equivalent of an AIDS infected Glock blast
Niggas know my style, plus they know they want more
Props from Mount Vernon to Mount Rushmore
Ok, kid, you know my style is buckwild literature
That you can never get when I'm thinkin' your particular
Flavor that you want
I sit back and smoke a fat blunt in class
Teachers can kiss my ass, I'm twice, Dice Riggety Raw
Never take a bad fall, smack your head up against the wall
Like playin' handball, my style's ill
I slam like Hulk Hogan, Dice Raw bettin' on my arm
Niggas know my slogan while I breathe your last breath
Niggas better watch they step, fat bull catch wreck
Ill, gots ta keep you in check
With the hellified beats and hard rhymes
Niggas know my style, when I go the whole nine
I beat down punks, cut 'em up into fruit chunks
Like fruit salad, my style's smooth like Malik
Blunts, so whatcha want? If you got beef then come get it
If ya don't well then forget it
My rap style's exquisite, I'm Raw Daddy
Like niggas with no Trojans on the stage when I rhyme
I gots ta keep my composure
Where I'm from, it's like a whole different world
Hoppin' a train, honey-dip and I'mma snatch your squirrel
Most corrupt, motherfucker in the tenth grade
Juvenile 'cause Jeff McKay could not fade
Don't ask me, honey, I'm not the one for stressin'
If you wanna know, better ask Brother ?uestion
'Cause he know the time like I know the time
When I grab the microphone, it's like summertime
Laid back, to recline in my La-Z-Boy chair
Dice Raw, the Wild Noid, I'm the fuck up outta here

Punked 'em wit' a dozen of pellets all in they skelet

And what she finna have? She don't know
She want neo-soul, this hip-hop is old
She don't want no Rock n' Roll
She want platinum or ice and gold
She want a whole lot of something to fold
If you a obstacle, she just drop you cold
Cause one monkey don't stop the show
Little Mary is bad, and these streets she done ran
Ever since when the heat began
I told her ""Girl, look here, calm down, I'mma hold your hand
To enable you to peep the plan, cause you's quick to learn
We can make money to burn if you allow me to lay this game""
I don't ask for much but enough room to spread my wings
And the world finna know my name

[Verse 2:  Cody Chesnutt]
I don't ask for much these days
And I don't bitch and whine if I don't get my way
I only want to fertilize another behind my lover's back
I sit and watch it grow roots standing where I'm at
Fertilize another behind my lover's back
And I'm keeping my secrets mine
[Hook 1: Cody Chesnutt]
I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushing it right
If Mary drops my baby girl tonight
I would name her ""Rock n' Roll""

Uh huh, Cadillac need space to roam
Where we heading for? She don't know
We in the city where the pros shake, rattle, and roll
And I'm a gad-dang rolling stone
I don't beg, I can hold my own
I don't break, I can hold the chrome
And it's weighing a ton and I'm a son of a gun
My code name is The Only One
And Black Thought is bad, these streets he done ran
Ever since when the game began
I never played the fool, matter of fact, I been keeping it cool
Since money been changing hands, and I'm left to shine
The legacy that I leave behind be the seed that'll keep the flame
I don't ask for much, but enough room to spread these wings
And the world finna know my name, now listen to me

[Verse 4: Cody Chesnutt]
I don't beg from no rich man
And I don't scream and kick
When his shit don't fall in my hands, man
Cause I know how to steal
Fertilize another against my lover's will
I lick the opposition cause she don't take no pill
Ooh, ooh, ooh no, dear
You'll be keeping my legend alive

I push my seed in her bush for life

If Mary drop my baby girl tonight
I would name her ""Rock-n-roll""
Oh, break it down, break it down, down for me

[Hook 2: Cody Chesnutt]
I push my seed somewhere deep in her chest
I push it naked cause I've taken my test
Deliver it Mary: it don't matter the sex
I'm gonna name it ""Rock-N-Roll""

[Hook 1: Cody Chesnutt]
I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushing it right
If Mary drop my baby girl tonight
I would name her ""Rock-n-roll""
I would name her ""Rock-n-roll""
I would name her ""Rock-n-roll"", yeah
I would name it ""Rock-n-roll"""
I Can,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Children's Choir]
I know I can
Be what I wanna be
If I work hard at it
I'll be where I wanna be
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 1]
Be, b-boys and girls, listen up
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold they breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how
Put your hands in the air, and take the vow
[Chorus x2]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 2]
Be, b-boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this
[Chorus x2]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 3]
Be, be-fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers, who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young princess, when you get your wedding ring
Your man will sing, ""She's my Queeeeeen""
[Chorus]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Past My Shades,B.o.B,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: B.o.B]
If you asked me what's on my mind, you probably won't believe it
'Cause if life was one big pool, I'd be in the deep end
So I play my role and never ever speak it, like a secret
And all the while you just try to figure me out (What?)

[Chorus: B.o.B]
But you can't see past my shades
Past my shades, past my shades
And you can't see past my shades
Past my shades, past my shades
And you can't see past my shades
Past my shades, past my shades
And you can't see past my shades
Past my shades, past my shades

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Well, ask me a question, I tell you no lies
'Cause there's nothing to hide, my soul's in my eyes
And I'm ahead of my time but I cannot rewind
The only thing I fear is the mirror in my bathroom
People look and try to see a disguise
But there is nothing that nobody can't see in light
If it's a song with a rhyme or a verse with a line
Then you understand my mind
[Chorus: B.o.B]
But you can't see past my shades
Past my shades, past my shades
And you can't see past my shades
Past my shades, past my shades
And you can't see past my shades
Past my shades, past my shades
And you can't see past my shades
Past my shades, past my shades

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Who else but Lu else?
You know I got two belts, the black and the white one
I begin and I master
I see in my eye glasses
But they saying what I'm seeing through is false like Ross
I can hear him through the wall like ""Walk
This Way"", trying to dissuade my thoughts
I'm a slave to myself and disobeyed my boss
It's all in disarray this parade I walk
They get amazed when they catch a chain I toss
Amidst this array of different ways I talk
And it hangs from your brain if my chain you caught
Like I cough without covering my mouth
I tip the scales like the king of the south
Forgot that I was fat, I lost my way
But now I'm back looking for the shade I sought
And not wonders, I'm Scott Summers
So don't make me take off my stunners
Bobby Ray, you know you got my numbers
And them deer can't see us like hunters
[Chorus: B.o.B]
But you can't see past my shades
Past my shades, past my shades
And you can't see past my shades
Past my shades, past my shades
And you can't see past my shades
Past my shades, past my shades
And you can't see past my shades
Past my shades, past my shades"

Ready or not (Uh-huh), here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me (Yo)

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean & Lauryn Hill]
Now that I escape, sleepwalker awake (Yeah)
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake
Jail bars ain't golden gates, those who fake, they break
When they meet their four hundred-pound mate
If I could rule the world (If I ruled the world), everyone would have a gun
In the ghetto. of course, when giddy-upping on their horse
I kick a rhyme drinking moonshine
I pour a sip on the concrete for the deceased
But, no, don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep
Thinking 'bout the robbery that I did last week
Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
I want to play with pelicans from here to Baghdad
Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist
I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends
A born again hooligan only to be king again
[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & Wyclef Jean]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not (Uh-huh), here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me (Yo, yo, yo, yo)

[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill & Wyclef Jean]
I play my enemies like a game of chess
Where I rest, no stress if you don't smoke sess
Lest I must confess, my destiny's manifest
In some Gore-Tex and sweats, I make treks like I'm homeless
Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess
Capture your bounty like Elliot Ness, yes
Bless you if you represent the Fu
But I'll hex you with some witch's brew if you're doo-doo
Voodoo, I can do what you do, easy
Believe me, fronting niggas give me heebie-jeebies (Ha)
So while you imitating Al Capone
I'll be Nina Simone and defecating on your microphone

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly

[Bridge: Lauryn Hill]
You can't run away from these scars I got, oh, baby

And anywhere you go, my whole crew gonna know, oh, baby
Hey, baby, you can't hide from the block, oh, no
[Verse 3: Pras, Pras & Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, refugees taking over
The Buffalo Soldier, dreadlock Rasta
On the twelfth hour, fly by in my bomber (Drop bombs)
Crews run for cover, now they're under, pushing up flowers
Superfly, true lies, do or die (He's super fly)
Toss me high, only puff lye with my crew from Lakay
I refugee from Guantanamo Bay
Dance around the border like I'm Cassius Clay (Yes, sir)

Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide (Ayo, nobody move)
Gonna find you and take it slowly

Session One,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Eminem]
Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise!
Aw, shit! Yeah
You ready to get this shit started or what?
Aight, well, I brought some friends with me too

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Now I ain't back just for the sake of just sayin' I'm back
I could relax, but I'd rather stack ammo on tracks
Couple Xanax, light a couple wax candles, then black-
-out and relapse 'til I yack Jack Daniels and 'gnac (Woo!)
Burp bubbles, attitude's immaturin', double
Shot of Bacardi, party, vision is blurrin'— woah-ho
I can't see shit, my words get to slurrin'— uh-oh!
You can call me R. Kelly now, you're in trouble!
What's occurrin' before, after, and durin' the show
Has no bearin' on the bad news I'm bearin', woah
What is it, wordplay? No, I'm pushin' you out the do'
So suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow
Now stomp your fuckin' feet 'til you get to squishing a ho
It's pandemonium, standing o when you see him, oh
Damn, baby, you look good, you're givin' me wood
You should pull over like a sweatshirt wit' a hood (Woo!)
It's neck work, get our polly on, you and me both
Break bread while I'm coppin' over this game to pinch a loaf
Now, homie, who's your favorite pain in the ass? Who claims to be
Spittin' the same flames as me? I'm Kanye when he crashed
In other words, I got the hood on smash like I stepped on the gas
Destroyed the front end, deployed the damn airbags from the dash
Went through 'em and laughed, came back an hour after the accident
And bit a goddamn Jawbreaker in half!
So stop fakin' the funk and start shakin' your ass
Slaughterhouse in the house with the Caucasian of rap
And Just Blaze on the track, what's the fuck's more amazin' than that
Slut? Answer me that! Royce, where you at?
[Verse 2: Royce da 5’9”]
I'm right here, Fire Marshall, verbal pair of pliers, I pry apart you
Lump on your head designed by a bar stool (Come on!)
Designed by a cartoon
Before I need to be hired, Jimmy, I'll fire Marshall (Woah!)
The 9 tucked against the linin'
I pull it out and flip your partner upside-down like y'all are a couple 69ing (Ha)
It's like Rick James is shootin' up your house, nigga!
Fuck yo' couch, nigga!
You screamin', ""Fuck the world!"" with your middle finger up
While I'm over here shovin' my dick in a hole in the mud
My bitch know I'm perfectly fit for murder
Because I murdered her, so you can call me Nicole to O. J. to Glove (Woo!)
I got a posse of insane clowns
Blow your brains on your opposite ear and ask you how your brain sounds ([?])
Bad, Evil, we go Alfred E. Neu-
-mann, mad cerebral, you on your last burrito!
(What that mean, Nickel?) It's a wrap if you eatin'
Get a beat, then terrorize that bitch like I'm Middle Eastern
Slaughterhouse on fire, nobody touchin' that
Good day and good night! Ortiz, yo, where the fuck you at? ([?])

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
I'm right here in my Nike Airs, Buzz Light-years (Uh)
Ahead of my mic peers (Yeah), quite scary to look at, a nightmare
Where my book at? I'll write fear in the heart of you tight squares
I harbor the art of you nice wear (Ah!)
It's type weird 'cause that made me hotter than my dear (Uh)
Uncle Al's breath after polishin' off his ninth beer (Haha!)
Homie, chill, listen, I swear
I'm god, I give tracks a Holy-feel, and they bite ears (Ow!)
I'm right here, why wouldn't I be? Just waiting to be hooked to IV
As Mumm-Ra's well, when you look at my pee (Ew)
And this joint (No exception), so just point (A direction)
And record the pig's oink (When I rip his intestines)
This isn't just an infection (Nah)
This won't go away with penicillin injections (Tss)
Millions of questions arose after they did an inspection, what I exhibit (What?)
Seems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it (Ow!)
Aw shiddit, I did it again, when I liddift this pen
I emitted this phlegm, this time it's alongside Edeminem (Haha)
So tell a friend to tell a friend write a disgusting hook (Yeah)
Jump in shark water and swim! Yo, where the fuck is Crook?
[Verse 4: Crooked I]
I'm right here, lettin' the shotty pop, quick as a karate chop
Get your body shot, get your top chopped, like a lollipop
Call it Maserati drop, in the body shop
Get your mommy knocked and your Uncle Tommy molli-wopped (Yeah)
I take your life to the ninth innin'
A knife in the gunfight, I love it, me and my knife winnin'
I laugh when you fall, the shit'll be funny
I'll buy my bitch a new ass and watch her sit on my money (Yo!)
Man, all the bitches holla— they wanna drop my britches
Then jaw on my dick and swallow, leave drawers in this Impala
I ball like Iguodala, I bear more arms than six koalas (Uh)
As soon as I draw, get sent to Allah
Bilinguist don, I kill with the tongue, I'm Atilla the Hun
I'm Genghis Khan, I'm a genius spawn
I pillage your village for fun, an egregious con
A syllable gun, real as they come, Long Beach Saddam! (Brrat!)
Slaughterhouse equals swine flu, are South flying
We do it to try to do without tryin' (Slaughterhouse!)

Alright, ayy, turn my headphones up

My favorite color is red like the bloodshed
From Kurt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin' at my shish kabab
Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve
(“I can't stand white people”)
You thought I was ill and now I'm even more so
Shit, I got full-blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe
I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs at your show
I just remembered that I'm absent-minded
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it
I'm freestylin' every verse that I spit
'Cause I don't even remember the words to my shit (Um, one, two)
I told the doc I need a change in sickness
And gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
Put my LP on your Christmas gift list
You want to get high? Here, bitch, just sniff this

And I was wavin' it at everybody, screamin', ""I suck"" (I suck)
I go on stage in front of a sell-out crowd
And yell out loud, ""All y'all get the hell out now""
Fuck rap, I'm givin' it up, y'all, I'm sorry
(But Eminem, this is your record release party)
I'm bored out of my gourd, so I took a hammer
And nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford
Guess I'm just a sick, sick bastard
Who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket (I ain't got it all)
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage (Oh)
And if you ever see a video for this shit
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit

Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
'Cause they think that I'm a motherfuckin' Beastie Boy
So I told 'em I was Mike D
They was like, ""Gee, I don't know, he might be""
I told 'em, ""Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert"" (Oh really?)
I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness Monster"" (Okay)
Peace out (Bye)
Then I jetted to the weed house, smoked out
'Til I started bustin' freestyles, broke out
Then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick
Made a couple of crank calls collect (Brrrt)
""It's Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, can you accept?""
I want to make songs all the fellas dub
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of
So just remember, when I bomb your set
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset

Calling me at 12:47 in the night
While I'm watching the fight
Looking at the phone, it's no name in sight
Blocked ID, knew something just wasn't right
It's my girl Kandi from out in Miami
Telling me that my man with some bitch in a Camry
Car seat in the back like he started a family
Yo Kan, stop playing, what the fuck is you saying?

[Kandi]
Remember them chicks from the Bricks 'round nine six
That we seen when we hit a lick by the project?

[Nicki Minaj]
Oh, you mean Leah, little sister Maria
I used to go see her in front of the pizzeria

[Kandi]
I didn't say them
They schooled me to some bitch that you knew from back when
Some bitch named Kim
Light skinned, slim, used to rock a low brim
Followed them to the crib, but the lights real dim
They hit me on the chirp, warning me, now I'm warning you
What's it gonna be Nicki, tell me what you wanna do

Damn, I'mma have to send her to her maker
Damn, I'mma have to send her to her maker
Damn, I'mma have to send her to her maker
I'mma send her to her maker
I'mma send her to her maker

They heard about his good sexing, long erections
Nice complexion, Magnums for protection
They even heard about his tongue game
How the nigga give brain, ain't stop 'til the cum came
But that's words of Hip Hop
I popped the bitch top, like a Corona

Call a coroner, it's gonna be a lot of black dresses and chest vest-es
If I find out he got a next Mrs
What you think all the goons is for
Two by the door, a few more out in New York
And I feed 'em curry chicken, I'm all about my green nahmean?
Got some fat bitches in the kitchen
I got a spot like ox and we cook oxtail
Got a scale for what's in the mail
I got whatever on my nigga bail, But if the nigga bail
I'll have him sleeping with some killer whales
Damn bitches wanna fuck with my man
On the other hand, things ain't always what you plan
It's the ones up in your prom picture, salon wit'cha
Now they wanna creep in your man's jeep
I bet you Nicki won't sleep
Cause I'mma put the heat to your beak, You'll bird like tweet tweet
And watch you smoke like a cigarette
Should've left the bitch a pack of Nicorette
Leave all them foul bitches wet
I give a fuck about you and your bum crew

Cazal shades and corn braids?
Pitching pennies, honeys had the high-top jellies
Shooting skelly, motherfuckers was all friendly
Lounging at the barbecues, drinking brews
With the neighborhood crews hanging on the avenues
Turn your pages to 1993
Niggas is getting smoked, G, believe me
Talk slick, you get your neck slit quick
'Cause real street niggas ain't having that shit
Totin' TECs for rep
Smoking blunts in the project hallways
Shooting dice all day
Waitin' for niggas to step up on some fightin' shit
We get hype and shit and start lightin' shit
So step away with your fistfight ways

[Verse 2]
No more coco-levio one, two, three
One, two, three, all it is to me is a mystery
I hear you motherfuckers talk about it
But I stay seeing bodies with the motherfuckin' chalk around it
And I'm down with the shit, too
For the stupid motherfuckers want to try to use Kung-Fu
Instead of a MAC-10, he tried scrappin'
Slugs in his back and that's what the fuck happens
When you sleep on the street
Little motherfuckers with heat wanna leave a nigga six feet deep
And we coming to the wake
To make sure the crying and commotion ain't a motherfucking fake
Back in the days our parents used to take care of us
Look at 'em now, they even fuckin' scared of us
Calling the city for help because they can't maintain
Damn, shit done changed
[Chorus]
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump, but now they blast, right?
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump, but now they blast, right?
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump, but now they blast, right?
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump, but now they blast, right?

[Verse 3]
If I wasn't in the rap game
I'd probably have a ki, knee-deep in the crack game
Because the streets is a short stop
Either you're slingin' crack rock or you got a wicked jump shot
Shit, it's hard being young from the slums
Eatin' five cent gums, not knowing where your meal's coming from
And now the shit's getting crazier and major
Kids younger than me, they got the Sky brand pagers
Goin' out of town, blowing up
Six months later, all the dead bodies showing up
It make me wanna grab the nine and the shotty
But I gotta go identify the body
Damn, what happened to the summertime cookouts?
Every time I turn around, a nigga gettin' took out
Shit, my mama got cancer in her breast
Don't ask me why I'm motherfucking stressed, things done changed
[Chorus]
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump, but now they blast, right?
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump, but now they blast, right?
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump, but now they blast, right?
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump, but now they blast, right?

[Outro]
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump, but now they blast, right?
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump, but now they blast, right?
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump, but now they blast, right?
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump, but now they blast, right?"
Brave in the Heart,Big Pun,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Triple Seis]
I'll battle you all, from the charts to ghetto stars
Face Triple Seis: the God of War like Mars
That leave MC's smashed by my Squad
It's odd y'all never seen relish, but always seem jealous
Of my extreme fellas, rockin' the Beamer sweaters
The ones who paid with their life
I rock for 40 days and 40 nights
And every verse is tight
Better than before: rough, rugged, and raw
Chainsaw metaphor that leave your brain sore
This ain't a game, I'll leave you maimed
Allow me to explain
I thrive on the pain while robbin' your chain
Nawmean, do him and the fiend, grab his wallet
Leave a trail, blazin' like Rasheed Wallace
What's today's knowledge?
Hold your heat like The Peacemaker
I walk the same streets the police take us
Livin' on the corner so won't speak it out my mouth
Respect and got the money, son, that's all that it's about
No doubt, silence of code, violence of mode
Under control, can tell my real niggas really roll
On the low, tryin' to blow trees
And for no reas' we hit a nigga up for mo' cheese
Better relate and start to think, or be the missing link
I got my Hustle on like Larry Flynt
[Verse 2: Big Pun]
We brave in the heart, playin' a part, amazingly smart
Razor-sharp, futuristic raps: state of the art
Takin' New York cats past the stars, first it was Nasty Nas
Now watch me turn a Apple into Macintosh
Computer chip locomotion flow, la cosa nostra dough
Hold your toaster low; business, never personal
Just some words to know if you run the streets
Come in peace or leave in pieces
Even Jesus was killed by the polices
They crucified him, now they inject us with juice to fry 'em
Depends on the state; If death is my fate, then cool, I'm dyin'
If that's my destiny, it's meant to be
Just remember to bury the motherfucker that bent me right next to me Aight, crew? (no doubt Pun)
Aight then, let's fight then
I'm hypened, comin' with the thunder and the lightnin'
Invitin' the comp, ice on the arm
Nights when I storm, snipin' your moms right from the Bronx
Mic in the palm, it's the ghetto god
I rip a nigga's heart out his frame
While I scream: ""Terror Squad!""
Be larger than life, my initials carved in my wife
She said she’d starve if I die, understand I’m a god in her eyes
The father of Christ, sure to be immortal
Guzzlin' beer bottles by the dozen
With Devin: that's mi hermano
[Refrain]
We will be here, forever – KRS
We brave in the heart, p-p-p-playin' a part
Amazingly smart
Remember Pun, that's the ghetto God

[Verse 3: Prospect]
You ain't understand how I push your wig back quick
A little quiet nigga wouldn't think I did that shit
I'm from where the guns love to introduce theyself
Reduce your health, little bulletproofs get felt
Who mind ready, for this big dog who hold a 9 steady
I'm John Blazin when you see the arms razin'
Shit, crime heavy already
I keep it sharper than the long 'chette
Far from a snitch nigga who call Teddy
I click triggers: how you more ready?
Switch quicker than Marbury
I'm a cherry, you a strawberry
If you lost that, mean I'm on top of the whip
You plottin' to flip, fuck around and get shot in the lip
You stop with the quick and never make another move
Even your mother lose
I hurt up your pops to pay your brother dues

[Refrain]
We will be here, forever – KRS
We brave in the heart, p-p-p-playin' a part
Amazingly smart
Remember Pun, that's the ghetto God
[Verse 4: Fat Joe]
Make way for scrill', I don't play, I spray for real
Blow your top with the Glock—that's my favorite kill
Blaze your crib with like thirty shots
I'm already hot, but my last one is with some dirty cops
I play the streets with toast, 'cause the thieves is close
Want to keep your post? Then don't beef with Joe
Still niggas think I won't bring the heat out
That's like sayin' Puff ain't never beat up Steve Stoute
Truth first, Terror Squad: shoot first
War with me and you guaranteed to leave the Earth
I'm dressed to kill, my niggas rep for real
Joe Crack's back like I never had a deal
Hungry and shit, it don't get more lovely than this
Blow a hole through your ribs just for runnin' your lips
The street's a trip: either you deep or you sleep with the fish
I keep a fifth for them niggas that's seekin' to flip"

She said I don't spend time like I really should
She said she don't know me anymore
I think she hates me deep down, I know she does
She wants to erase me, hmm
A couple days, no talking, I see my baby
And this what she tells me

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
She said I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works, I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
It's like I'm her new nightmare, she ain't escaping
It makes me feel a bit complete (Yeah)
Knowing someone you love don't feel the same way about ya
Memories they soon delete (Hmm)
A couple weeks, no talking, I see my baby
I missed you so damn much
Hey, I wish we could start over, I told my baby
This what this bitch tells me
[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
She said I keep on running, keep on running, and nothing works
I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you

[Bridge: Kid Cudi & Kanye West]
Yeah, cause I'm in the magazines, on the TV
No matter where you are, you might hear me (Uh)
I'm in the magazines, on the TV
No matter where you go, you might see me (Hello, haha)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Uh, I'm Yeezy, she say ""Hi, I'm Aria""
No, you a angel, you wave ""Hi"" to Aaliyah
I got a show in Korea, they built a new arena
Why don't you come and watch a nigga tear the whole scene up
I know I seen you before, but don't know where I seen ya
Oh I remember now, you something that I dreamed of
Don C says she cool, but don't let her fuck your cream up
Monica Lewinsky on the dress, she'll take you to the cleaners
Sure enough, a week later, I'm in extra love
And everybody know she's mine so she extra plugged
Every bouncer, every club show her extra love
We just praying the new fame don't get the best of us
But all good things gotta come to a en-a
She let it go to her head, ""No, not my Aria""
The height of her shopping was writer's blocking me
I couldn't get my shit out anyway, I hope you die, Aria
[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works, I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you"

Good evening
This is your fucking captain speaking
We will soon be reaching an altitude of
Four million and a half.. feet
That's eight million miles in the sky
Please... undo your seat belt for takeoff (Chkk)
You are now free to smoke about the cabin (Chkka)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I'm Dre, from back in the day, from
N.W.A, from black and the gray, from
Choking a bitch, to smacking her face, from
Stacking up bodies, to racking AKs up
From racking up hits, to stacking them crates up
I'm still hungry, and I'm back with a tapeworm
And we're what's happenin' in rap entertainment
Me and Shady, as far as competition, faggot, there ain't none

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Speak of the Devil, it's attack of the Rain Man
Chainsaw in hand, bloodstain on my apron
Soon as the blade spun, vrrunn, they run away from
Who wanna play dungeon? No one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon, a great one
Wait, it ain't funny, man, it's urgent, I need one
Two boxes of detergent in a paint gun
And an emergency squirt gun to spray A-1
[Chorus: Eminem]
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smoking with the best)
I said, one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smoking with the best)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon Wireless
A nice environment, surprised entirely
Hypnotized by the sound, I surround the hydrants
Taking lives of firemen; say goodbye, here I am again
Naked wives and Vicodin
Before I begin to get so high, pussy boy, I could spin
Vinn-vinn, fuck the handle, I fly off the hinge
Let that boy off the bench, coach, and throw it to him
There he goes in his trench coat, no clothes again
Baby, make us some french toast and show us some skin
I'll show you every inch grows on my foreskin
Show me nipple, I pinch both, and throw up a ten
Now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again
The sorcerer of intercourse; if it's forced, it's him
Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within
And when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain
[Chorus: Eminem]
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smokin' with the best)

Now where there's smoke, there's fire, where there's fire, there's flames
Where there's flames, there's chronic, either you high or you ain't
I got no time for no games

[Verse 5: Eminem]
Nuh-uh, he ain't playin'
He's gon' get the AK and aim it right at your brain
I'm slightly insane, vodka and creatine
Hpnotiq and Red Bull, it's an incredible energy drink
And it's given me wings, I believe I can fly
While I pee on a girl, you won't catch me CSI
It's as easy as pie, and as simple as cake
Dre, get on the mic and make 'em tremble and shake

[Verse 6: Dr. Dre]
Now put your smoke up in the air, raise your Henny and Coke
And if you really wanna get fucked up, just let me know
We can smoke 'til there's no more lighter fluid to do it
Let's get into it, you're smokin' with the triedest and truest
I got the Midas touch when it comes to rollin' shit up
You motherfuckers ain't smokin', you just holdin' shit up
Now here we go, let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt
I smoke the kinda stuff that make the records go number one
'Cause if at first you don't succeed, won't hurt to smoke some weed
Now them words are just a little more personal for me
Seeing as how I blew up off of puffing them trees
[Verse 7: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Well smoke enough for me, fuck yeah, light it up, Cheech
Come on, smoke me out cuz, give me contact buzz
Get me on track, they love me when I'm on that stuff
But this is Earth calling Shady, man, come on back—What?
Man, we're losing him, he won't even respond back, fuck!
Now look at all the pretty women in here (Damn, bitches!)
Dre, it's hot, I think we better go check on their temperatures
I'll get the thermometer, you get the bandages
Now baby, just bend over, this won't hurt a damn bit, just—

[Chorus: Eminem]
Give me one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smokin' with the best)

Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way

Super High Remix,Rick Ross,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1 - Currency]
You think you got the bond cause I rolled you a joint?
I smoke with all mine, baby girl, what's your point?
Don't front, you in the back of a long line
Trying to get in, cause only members inside
Trees get twisted up like fingers in gang signs
Purple Kushions broke my fall, I fell from a grapevine
Super high, from the free throw line, I'm
Drexler status, glide the espionage
Many a jealous eyes scrutinze the wise
But the Jets in the house like the curtains and the blinds
It hurt to see me shine, that's why they frowning all the time
In they internet videos, digital CB4s
Angry orangutans, I'm arranging my sneakers
I'm the action on the court, you the gum stuck to the bleachers
I think I'm Paul Pierce, I think I'm Rondo
High off that headband, you dying on that hydro

[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa]
I thought of this fresh off a bong rip
My bitch next to me, getting undressed for me
Running bath water, playing her favorite songs
While I get another one lit
Don't usually smoke at all but say tonight she'll take a hit
That's understood
From the smell, and by what I paid
You know it's good
Them niggas with me? They from the hood
Now we through parties in the sky
I'm on the 42nd floor, now that's super high
Champagne, more paper planes than you can fly
Them young niggas fell soon as they tried
When the paparazzi flash, I'll be counting all this cash
Plotting a million about how I can build a mountain out of hash
[Hook - Ne-Yo]
All these cars, all these stars, all around me (super high)
Put your eyes to the sky, that's where you'll find me
Cause we are super high

[Verse 3 - Rick Ross]
I'm getting money, no Illuminati
My pain never went in vain, it's all over my body
Get the spliff in my Mr. Bughatti
Kick it with my lil' homies, a Mr. Miyagi
I gotta buy my niggas each a pound
Tweaking up our sneaker style, passing reefer 'round
Spitting only lethal rounds, speakers beating down
Not talking munchies when I say my niggas eating now
Promoter gave me 40 thou, I think we even now
Pina colada, paper smoking, Garden of Eden now
Taylor Gang is what we bleed about
Jet setters in places you only read about

[Bridge - Wiz Khalifa]
And now, everywhere I go
It's so strong, they ask me where I get my smoke
Bitches don't have to guess, they know
I keep one rolled up, we can do whatever you want
Smoking pina colada papers, baby girl
We don't fuck with them blunts
Unless I'm with the Boss
[Verse 4 - Rick Ross]
If you looking for me, you can find me in the Guinness Book
Only fly bitches ride with the Boss, take a look

Back on my saddle throwing purple out the truck
Candy paint, rally stripe, shining like us

Automatic straps, stash spots under the rack

Foreign grinds, hard times
Getting mines, you know: Uptown

Thank Me Later: first week, I'm taking all bets
Because a million copies isn't really far-fetched
I keep credit cards in cash knots
I keep my darkest shades on 'til the flash stops
It's for my LA girls getting them implants
And all my DC girls getting them ass shots
Got 'em for a reason shorty, go ahead, bust it open
I keep a secret, baby: nothing's heard when nothing's spoken
Haters talk it like my buzz isn't enough promotion
And I just lost a Gucci sandal in the fucking ocean
Damn, I guess the problems of a teen star
Are all that fuels the conversations between y'all
And dog that's funny, pay me what you owe me nigga

I pulled out my strap condom, looked down there and said ""naw""
Cigar full of Kush you need prescriptions to access
Laying on the mattress with your favorite actress
My blunt was going out, I said, ""Baby, pass the matches""
And let her top me off while I'm tapping off the ashes

You gassed up, but gasless
Unleaded, yeah, Bun said it, nigga get past it
Taking what you got, you should've passed it

And I'm close to the edge, so your parents can come push me
I curse so much just to get on they nerves
I got kids actin' a fool from the traps to the 'burbs
My filthy mouth, it won't fight cavities or beat plaque
So I shot the tooth fairy and put my old teeth back
I take a shit on the equator, the size of a crater
And make government officials breathe harder than Darth Vader
It's the chicken and the beer that makes Luda keep rappin'
But no pork on my fork, I don't even speak pig Latin
I go fishin' on my lake, with yo bitch as the bait
Plus I eat many MCs, but I don't gain no weight
The numba one chief rocka, clean out yo' rap lockers
I'm as stiff as a board, y'all more shook than maracas
But my trix ain't for kids, if you dig'um you'll get smacked
I'll clock ya I'll spring forward, you fall back
Every album that I drop has got more than ten bangers
That's cause I'm a shot caller, y'all fools is Crank Yankers
Ain't a damn thing changed but the ice on my chain
To get chicks from Portland, Oregon to Portland, Maine
Now I roll up torpedoes, get blunted with rastas
For a hefty fee, I'm on your record like Bob Costas
I own so many jerseys, I'm a throwback mess
I hit the cleaners and tell 'em I want a full-court press (Ow)
So momma toast your glass while I'm countin' my cash
'Cause every single is a smash, I'm hot as a camel's ass
The competition never just wanna admit that they lost
And that they last about as long as my part in The Wash
From yo' car to a crap game, no one rolls wit'chu
One of Mini-Me's shoes got more sole than you
So by the time you figure out why your record ain't spinnin'
I'm in the strip club smokin' with President Clinton
So stand clear of the long sideburns and goatee
They made the mold of the penis enlarger off me (Me)
I'll be in another room when I hit from the back
Not to mention my refrigerator's taller than Shaq (Yeah)
So yippie kay yay, yippie yie yie yo (Yo)
If you can't swim, don't smoke my hydro ('Dro)
I've been lookin for a woman just to put my stamp on
But a lot of y'all are mo' stuck up than tampons (Woo)
So wash all your sins away and stop playin' (Yeah)
If God's line is busy you might have to two-way him (Mhm)
Then catch me in your backyard, playin' croquet
And when I'm drunk, tell them kids, ""Drugs are bad, mmm'kay?""?
Or watch me swing my chain at the Roscoe's off Pico
Got seven cars, get all my rims at Chrome Depot
And people think I'm bad, they say ""Ooh, he's so evil!""
'Cause I go on blind dates with actual blind people (Ow)
But my album's out the store, yours be on the shelf
I heard you masturbate a lot, so y'all keep to yourself
'Cause these women want a man that stay up and stay strong
Like the NBA, you gotta play hard or go home
All that shit that y'all talkin', y'all can pop it to them
'Cause Ludacris'll beat you down with a prosthetic limb
I put my foot so deep in your ass that you can smell it
And your breath will turn to Foot Locker water repellant
I'm the man, I got money far as the eyes can see
And I'm in a group, I split dough with me, me, and me
So much money in my jewelry that I'm damn near sorry
So I'ma trade my earrings in and get a Ferrari (Woo)
I buy cars with straight cash, have meetings with Donald Trump
Y'all meet with Honda, no payments for twelve months (Uh-huh)

Quick to shake a nigga's hand and show me all of they teeth
And these bitches—I be patting they asses

Rappers think Detroit niggas not as down as them
Or since that I'm down with Slim that I sound like him
Quick to judge me and tell me that my hook might sell
And say faggot shit to me like I look like L
My advice: Quit talking, it's over
I was knocking niggas out when you was knocking sticks off of their shoulders
I got dirt done in my past, I know y'all sweat
I got regrets older than some of you so-called ""vets""

Paparazzi,Xzibit,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Yes, 1996 marks the beginning of a new era
The dysfunctional member of the Alkaholiks family
It’s Xzibit!

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wonder if it’s all worth my while
Xzibit stay versatile, with million dollar lifestyle
And I could feel it as a child growing up
The niggas that was real
And the niggas that was scared as fuck
That's why Xzibit only roll with a chosen few
You ain't really real, I can tell when I look at you
So ease off the trigger-talk, you ain’t killin' shit
It’s not affecting me or the niggas that I'm chillin' with
I don’t believe the hype or buy woof tickets
Nigga, you make a gang of noise and never seen, like a cricket
I guess that’s why we never kick it
A lot of niggas is soft and get tossed tryna fuck with the Likwit
How many niggas do you know like this?
Always claimin' that they ridin' but they really turned bitch
It don’t make sense, either you’re a soldier from the start
Or an actor with a record deal tryna play the part—like that!
[Chorus]
It’s a shame, niggas in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame (Extra large!)
It’s a shame, niggas in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame (Paparazzi!)

[Verse 2]
See, I don’t need no lights, no cameras; just action, goddamn it
Never no superstar, I'm more like a planet
So my composure is kept while others start to sweat
Emergin' from the fog with my fucked-up dialogue
Tryna live high on the hog leaves you bankrupt
And niggas you spent it on would not give a fuck
And that’s deep; how deep? It’s deeper than Atlantis
Home of the scandalous: big bad Los Angeles
Dangerous, vandalous, yo, not to be trusted
Now, how the fuck is you hard
Not being scared by the boulevard?
I'm pullin' that card, and saying ""Gin, mothafucka!""
Flowin' like liquid; soak it in, mothafucka!
I'm breakin' it down, my sound surrounds like death
From the West, puttin' whole counties to the test
It’s all in perspective, breaker 1-9 copy
This is for the niggas gettin' caught up in the paparazzi

[Chorus]
It’s a shame, niggas in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame (Extra large!)
It’s a shame, niggas in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame (Paparazzi!)
[Verse 3]
Niggas smoke stress and crossdress, but I just play the back
Others going through schemes and pipe dreams for a contract
Real tightly rolled, fuck ’em all how I feel
I made a cool half mill' before I had a record deal
Therefore you look and stare like it’s magic
But too much of anything can make you an addict
Whenever devils be startin' static, break out the automatic
I set it off straight, I spread hate, then I vacate
But wait! Who dares to cross this path?
Yo, I do you like math, cut with glass, make a bloodbath
So on behalf of all niggas I get drunk with
Smokin' blunts with, I dispose of your punk shit
He-he, and keep it all in perspective
Carbon copies gettin' caught up in the paparazzi
Once again, it's the Likwidation crew
And we return at you like this

[Chorus]
It’s a shame, niggas in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame (Extra large!)
It’s a shame, niggas in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame (Paparazzi!)"
Thug Luv,Bone Thugs-N-Harmony,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: 2Pac + Bizzy Bone]
Nigga, we doin' this shit from Cleveland to L.A., nigga
Whatever you niggas want, we bring it!
Thug Luv, (biatch!) nigga what time is it?
Yo, I don't give a fuck where you lay at, nigga
It's time to slay these bitch-made niggas!
'Pac, 'Pac run with us, run with us, run with us!
'Pac, 'Pac run with us, 'Pac and Rip, with thug love
They ain't even knowing what type of niggas we is
Where my thugs at? Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
I know you niggas been waitin' for this for a long time
Well, here it is, nigga, here it is!
What you gonna do with it?

[Verse 1: Bizzy Bone]
Well, it must be close to the Armageddon, Lord
You know, that I won't fly by that lesson
You taught me, to pull out my Wesson you brought me
And I'm not stressin' it softly
Get 'em up off me, 'cause all we
Wanted was harmony, been bombing 'em
Yell up out of my ghetto, I won't settle, get on my level
They can't, stop me and pop me
Nigga, they got me? Fuck no
Little Pac gets schizophrenic, let's manage, to damage, all y'all
I'll, talk about 'em, and you don't really want it
'Cause they're cornered, and I'm want 'em, to not jump
I'd rather say that we came to shut 'em all down
So quick to test, bullet, yes, declare war
Roll, I'll flow when I get the gun for the murder
Mo' horror! Why? They did it all, pause for the cause
And I, finna to pull a 9 or pistol, and lit a nigga with mine
Fuck them niggas, it's on
All y'all fall! Bizzy getting bitches to test me
Bless the floor, and any attempt to arrest me, stress me
Lord, looking at death with the last of my breath
Follow, follow, my kids!
But don't sin, in my steps!
Yet the weapon is kept, with the best of my secrets
Deep in the reach, I'm alone, nigga, believe
That I can see it, if needed, and if you really with me
And well then let it be, get the greens and we running up over Cleveland
[Interlude: 2Pac]
Ha, ha! What's poppin', nigga? (yeah!)
Put your muthafuckin' hands on your strap, nigga
Thug Luv, nigga. Yeah, we can do this like gangstas and slug it out (Thug luv)
Or do this like punks, and punk it out
Pull your strap on me (Thug luv), nigga, you better kill me!
Thug Life, baby. Thug Luv

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I'll probably be punished for hard livin', blind to the facts:
Thugs is convicts, in God's prison, hands on the strap
Prayin' so Father please forgive me!
Police be rushin' when they see me
I flaunt it: America's Most Wanted, live on TV
Life: pleasure and pain, stuck in this game, holler my name!
We all gon' die, we bleed through similar veins
Please explain to me, now. Don't panic, when my guns burst
Heard the last jam, nigga? This one's worse!
My nigga Bone held the chrome 'til I came home
Thug Luv players tell these, bitch niggas ""Bring it on""
I caught a plane out to Cleveland late last evening
To help my niggas clean up some niggas no longer breathin'
Now, who do you believe in? Hit the weed and breathe
It's a, cold-ass world; niggas, kill you in your sleep
Watch me, until they stop me, bury, murder me or drop me
I got, Thug Luv for my nationwide posse. Feel me!
[Verse 3: Layzie Bone]
Little thug from the Land, nigga, never ran
Muthafuckas out to get me. They don't understand
It's the #1 nigga out with a nation of niggas
Down to put in some work and do some dirt
Fuckin' around with the band Bone, Thugs-N-Harmony
Follow down the road, we stroll to meet karma
Everything I do, it seem to cause drama
Ready for the war like a knight in my armor, bomb ya!
So quick to test us, nigga wanna crash me, eat dust
For the love of the lust, niggas bustin' on us
Hit 'em up with the buck, 12-gauge erupt!
It's my Art of War, puttin' niggas on the floor
When I'm comin' through the door, bringin' nuthin' but terror
Causing much pain to the nigga that dared us
Tried to put a twist in this thugsta era
Paired up, with a nigga like Pac
And a nigga like me gotta stay high
Thug luv 'til I die, keep my prayer to the sky
But I'm still in the hood, smoke and fry
So I beg, the Lord to save us all: escapers of misery
Bless my niggas in penitentiaries, soldiers of the century, yeah

[Verse 4: Krayzie Bone]
Here to get it, told my niggas they need get, Down
With the dirt, and we don't fuck around
Buck a couple of rounds, and if you're passin' through
Then hit the ground, and don't get caught up in the crossfire, nigga
Artillery thick, and you don't wanna get to fuckin' with this
I'm straight devil, not a punk and pretend
I reload, and buck a little mo'
Flee the scene 'fore the po-po even know
""So, who ya looking for?"" They don't know!
A mothafucka with a leatherface
Hey, man, she said I ran this way, said I ran that a way
Ya hoes'll never know because I got away (yeah)
A criminal mind, to keep a nigga on the level
Sometimes, so get high, and analyze your crime
Correctly organized and with results, you'll be surprised
[Verse 5: Wish Bone]
Oh, nigga, can you feel the vibe? We can ride
Playa hating niggas, you gots to die, it's only right
Fucking with Bone, better leave it alone
Mo Thugs come crack their fuckin' domes
Still in the hood, where the thugs play
Fuckin' with nuthin' but thugs, mane
Ain't takin' no shorts or no losses
We crackin' them domes around my way
Give it to 'em on another level, nigga, get a shovel
You can dig a hole; bitches is dead!
Infrared, to your head. You can beg, you can fled
But still gonna bleed bloody red
Fuck with mine, we'll be seen in the moonlight
'Cause we out ridin', lookin' for you (for you)
Better run for cover, nigga, duck!
We about to bust, Straight got the infrared, put it on his forehead
Make some moves, send flowers straight to his home
Put a card in the muthafucka, send it to his mama
Tell her he was dead wrong, dead wrong
Now he long gone, long gone

[Outro: Bizzy Bone]
'Pac, 'Pac run with us, run with us, run with us!
'Pac, 'Pac run with us, 'Pac and Rip, with thug love
'Pac, 'Pac run with us, run with us, run with us!
'Pac, 'Pac run with us, 'Pac and Rip, with thug love

Rewind,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse]
Listen up, gangstas and honeys with your hair done
Pull up a chair, hon', and put it in the air, son
Dog, whatever they call you, God, just listen
I'll spit a story backwards, it starts at the endin'
The bullet goes back in the gun
The bullet holes close in this chest of a nigga, now he back to square one
Screamin', ""shoot don't please"", I put my fifth back on my hip
It's like a VCR rewindin' a hit
He put his hands back on his bitch, my caravan doors open up
I jumped back in the van, they closin' shut
Goin' reverse, slowly prepared
My nigga Jungle utters out somethin' crazy like, ""Go he there""
Sittin' back in his chair, we hittin' the roach
The smoke goes back in the blunt, the blunt gets bigger in growth
Jungle unrolls it, put his weed back in the jar
The blunt turns back into a cigar
We listen to Stevie, it sounded like heavy metal fans
Spinnin' records backwards of AC/DC
I give my niggas dap, jump out the van, back first
Back upstairs, took off the black shirt
I'm in the crib with the phone to my ear
Listen up so y'all can figure out the poem real clear
The voice on the phone was like, ""Outside right we""
So with my mouth wide, holdin' my heat
Bullets I had plenty to squeeze, plenty for you
'Cause Jungle said, ""Block your on enemy's the""
Hung up the phone, then the phone rang
I'm laid in the bed, thinkin' about this pretty young thing
Who left, she came back, her clothes just fell to the rug
She fell to my bed and gave me a hug
I told her, ""No hell,"" she talkin' 'bout, ""Me kiss""
Bobbed her head then spit a nut back in my dick
Started suckin' with no hands, a whole lot of spit
Then got up and put her bra back on her tits
Got fully dressed and told me, ""Stressed really I'm""
Picked up her Gucci bag and left a nigga behind
Walkin' through the door, she rang the bell twice
I vomited vodka back in my glass with juice and ice
The clock went back from three to two to one
And that's about the time the story begun
That's when I first heard the voicemail on the cell
It said, ""Son, we found that nigga we gotta kill""
[Outro]
Ayo, son, ayo, son, you hear me? You hear me?
Listen, man
This dude right on the block right now, man
I found him, right now, I see him right now
Let's kill him
Yo, this Nas, leave it, peace"
Mind Playing Tricks on Me,Geto Boys,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Scarface]
I sit alone in my four-cornered room
Starin' at candles
Oh, that shit is on?
Let me drop some shit like this here, real smooth

[Verse 1: Scarface]
At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies bein' burned
Four walls just starin' at a nigga
I'm paranoid, sleepin' with my finger on the trigger
My mother's always stressin' I ain't livin' right
But I ain't goin' out without a fight
See, every time my eyes close
I start sweatin' and blood starts comin' out my nose
Is somebody watchin' the Ak'?
But I don't know who it is, so I'm watchin' my back
I can see him when I'm deep in the covers
When I awake I don't see the motherfucker
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a cane like my own
Some might say, ""Take a chill, B.""
But fuck that shit! There's a nigga tryin' to kill me
I'm poppin' in the clip when the wind blows
Every 20 seconds got me peepin' out my window
Investigatin' the joint for traps
Checkin' my telephone for taps
I'm starin' at the woman on the corner
It's fucked up when your mind's playin' tricks on ya
[Verse 2: Willie D]
I make big money, I drive big cars
Everybody know me; it's like I'm a movie star
But late at night, somethin' ain't right
I feel I'm bein' tailed by the same sucker's headlights
Is it that fool that I ran off the block?
Or is it that nigga last week that I shot?
Or is it the one I beat for 5,000 dollars?
Thought he had 'caine, but it was Gold Medal flour
Reached under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
Ain't no use to me lyin', I was scareder than a motherfucker
Hooked a left into Popeye's and bailed out quick
If it's goin' down, let's get this shit over with
Here they come, just like I figured
I got my hand on the motherfuckin' trigger
What I saw'll make your ass start gigglin'
Three blind, crippled and crazy senior citizens
I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go because I'm paranoid
I keep lookin' over my shoulder and peepin' around corners
My mind is playin' tricks on me

[Verse 3: Scarface]
Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doin' dope
Can't keep a steady hand, because I'm nervous
Every Sunday morning I'm in service
Prayin' for forgiveness
And tryin' to find an exit out the business
I know the Lord is lookin' at me
But yet and still, it's hard for me to feel happy
I often drift when I drive
Havin' fatal thoughts of suicide
Bang and get it over with
And then I'm worry-free, but that's bullshit
I got a little boy to look after
And if I die, then my child'll be a bastard
I had a woman down with me
But to me it seemed like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this shit
But to me she was just another bitch
Now she's back with her mother
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm feelin' lonely
My mind is playin' tricks on me
[Verse 4: Bushwick Bill]
This year, Halloween fell on a weekend
Me and Geto Boys are trick-or-treatin'
Robbin' little kids for bags
'Til a lawman got behind our ass
So we speeded up the pace
Took a look back and he was right before our face
He'd be in for a squabble, no doubt
So I swung and hit the nigga in his mouth
He was goin' down, we figured
But this wasn't no ordinary nigga
He stood about six or seven feet
Now that's the nigga I be seein' in my sleep
So we triple-teamed on him
Droppin' them motherfuckin' B's on him
The more I swung, the more blood flew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too
Then I felt just like a fiend
It wasn't even close to Halloween
It was dark as fuck on the streets
My hands were all bloody from punchin' on the concrete
Goddamn, homie!
My mind is playin' tricks on me"

I don't know what you heard about me

But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P (Now, Shorty)

Now, Shorty, she in the club, she dancin' for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana
She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her, 'cause they want her
I spit a little G, man, and my game got her
A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear sayin' they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar tryin' to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me 'cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga tryna holla 'cause I want some head
I'm that nigga tryna holla 'cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch, hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid

If you fuckin' with me, I'm a P-I-M-P
Not what you see on TV, no Cadillac, no greasy
Head full of hair, bitch, I'm a P-I-M-P
Come get money with me if you curious to see
How it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch some TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P

Girl, we could pop some Champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone, I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems, I can solve 'em, they big or they small

She got on Payless; me? I got on gator shoes
I'm shoppin' for chinchillas in the summer, they cheaper
Man, this ho, you can have her, when I'm done I ain't gon' keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin' know
This ain't no secret, you ain't gotta keep it on the low
Bitch, choose on me, I'll have you strippin' in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Niki my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your ho out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch

You love to hear the story, again and again
About these young brothers, from the City of Wind
Like juice and gin, in the city we blend
Amongst the hustle, titties and skin, fifties and rims
Y'all know the Sprewells and trucks that's detailed
Heartless females that wanna ride in 'em
Felt the Southside venom in raw hides and denim
Pimp minds collide with 'em, a system that tries victims
We livin' in, my man in the fast lane pivotin'
On the block white is selling like Eminem
On the block it jump off like Kim and 'em
On the block it's hot, you can feel it, in your skin and then
Shorties get the game but no instructions to assemblin'

Cats is colder than four below, with self I go toe to toe
Wondering if it's for the art or for the dough
Though I know to grow a nigga gotta learn to let go
Though I know the dough I got to bring back to the ghetto
Arrows on tarot cards pointin' to the grind
Po' livin' in more prisons, pointin' to my mind, shine the light up
Clench my fists tight, holdin' the right up
Freedom fight in dark gear for the years to get brighter
Situations, and jaws get tighter

Emcees and actors that seize and capture
Moments like the camcorder

So die motherfuckers, die motherfuckers, die
Nah we ain't gonna kill your ass yet, we gonna make you suffer
[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
In a sec, I throw the TEC to your fucking neck
Everybody hit the deck, Biggie 'bout to get some rec
Quick to leave you in a coffin for slick talkin
You better act like CeCe and keep on walkin'
When I hit ya, I split ya to the white meat
You swung a left, you swung a right, you fell to the concrete
Your face, my feet, they meet with stompin'
I'm rippin' MCs from Tallahassee to Compton
Biggie Smalls on a higher plane
Niggas say I'm strange, deranged because I put the 12 gauge to your brain
Make your shit splatter
Mix the blood like batter then my pocket gets fatter
After the hit, leave you on the street with your neck slit
Down your backbone to where your motherfucking'shit drip
The shit I kick, ripping through the vest
Biggie Smalls passing any test, I'm ready to die!

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
Yes, I'm ready
Yes, I'm ready
I'm ready
Yes, I'm ready
Time to go, we gon put you out your misery motherfucker
Niggas definitely know what time it is (Yes, I'm ready)
The Notorious one in full effect for '93 (Yes, I'm ready)
Uhh, uhh Yes, I'm ready
Suicidal, I'm ready!
So die motherfuckers, die motherfuckers, die
Yes, I'm ready
So die motherfuckers, die motherfuckers, die
[Outro: Puff Daddy]
Now I lay me down to sleep (Yeah)
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
'Cause I'm ready to die
(I'm ready, I'm ready)
All y'all motherfuckers come with me if you want to
(I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready)
Biggie Smalls the biggest man
(I'm Ready)
Rocking on and on in '93, Easy Mo Bee
Third Eye and the rest of the Bad Boy fam

Now or Never,The Roots,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: Dice Raw]
Everything's changing around me
And I want to change too
It's one thing I know
It ain't cool being no fool
I feel different today
I don't know what else to say
But I'ma get my shit together
It's now or never
(Now or never, now or never)
(Now or never, now or never)

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Uhh, I'm sick, sick of waiting in vain, tired of playing the game
Thinking of making a change, finally breaking the chains
Every phase, every happening craze
When it's said and done, my head is right back in a haze
I'm ready for the next chapter and page to start acting my age
And part ways with Black Thought from back in the days
I'm stargazing from the back of the stage
Questioning if who y'all praise is worthy of praise
What's the phrase ""bygones is bygones?""
Niggas who used to be the underdogs is icons
People say the light shines once in a lifetime
Is this midlife kind a crisis a little bit like mine?
I'm thinking not now but right now
I need some kinda sign that the future is bright now
I fuck around, do the right thing like Spike now
The quick and the dead, which one is my lookalike now?
I'm moving ahead
[Hook: Dice Raw]
Everything's changing around me
And I want to change too

[Verse 2: Phonte]
Yo, opportunities lost because I blew them
On the sunniest days of my life, I cried through them
Mom was out the picture, and pops, I barely knew him
And I would pray to God but I'm tired of lying to him
Tired of tryna run from the things inside of us
Got a lot of fam and a lot of admirers
Who tell me that I should aspire to be changed
But when I think of changing, it's like, 'Why even try this shit?'
My mind hazy and my thoughts, they get distorted
I know my good and bad deeds both get recorded
You do right so your soul can last
But my role is cast before I even audition for it
So I don't really see an end to my vice
It's just false reformation, no end of my strife
Feel the evil overpowering, you can go ahead, throw the towel in
Cause nigga, that's the end of the fight
When you can only see the tunnel at the end of the light
Lights out, party over, it's the end of your life
And I'm out

Everything's changing around me
And I want to change too
It's one thing I know

It's now or never

(Now or never, now or never)

[Verse 3: Dice Raw]
When I look into the mirror and see my own image
It feel like there's something else far in the distance
Something I wanna see, but something that's resistant
And every day, the haunting is growing more persistent
I never noticed it before, but now I can't miss it
And the constant pounding's driving me ballistic
I ran from it for years, but it's still next to me
And it's growing stronger, taking even less of me
I can't fight it now, I know it's just destiny
And I just wonder what's gon' happen when it catches me
Will it leave me face down in the Chesapeake?
Or will it just start bringing out the best in me?
But is the best in me really just the worst in me?
And if so, yesterday could be my anniversary
In sinner's court, sip port and have church with me
I'm trying to get rid of these ghosts that's cursing me
I'm feeling change is an absolute certainty
Cause what's going on is a state of emergency
[Hook: Dice Raw]
Everything's changing around me
And I want to change too
It's one thing I know
It ain't cool being no fool
I feel different today
I don't know what else to say
But I'ma get my shit together
It's now or never

You shut the *beep* up, what can you do?
We been ridin' in this car for 5 hours
What you gonna do?
I ain't doing *beep*, I'm gon' ride this car
But I'ma tell you a story though, let me you somethin'...

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Yo, uh, I rock baguettes with hoodies, it's like extra goodie
I couldn't break dance y'all, or electric boogie
I was obsessed with Cookie, I wanna sex her cookie
She said forget her nookie, wipe my nose, go get them boogies
I gave Cookie nuggies, with the girls, got known
This my two brim hat, call me Sherlock Holmes
Whole world got blown, so I tell hoes
Fuck Lee's and shell toes, these KangaROOS are Velcro
(Know I kept a little two dollars in the zipper part, right there)
Timberland moccasins, dimes in them penny loafers
A-train, one bus, sure I had plenty chauffeurs
Uncle, plenty holsters, dolgers, soldiers, hostess
Not golf but like golf, he had plenty gophers
Can't get paid on an earth this big?
You worthless kid, Cam don't deserve to live
Back then I played for Gauchos, went over the Riverside
Young life, turned left, we back over the riverside
Blood played for Stone Gym
That's when I told him and Jim
We ain't balling for real, where's the stone gems?
Where's the chrome rims?
That's when you changing lanes
Here we change your lane, we'll gain a sprain
Change the game, and not naming names
But 'caine fame's like Dana Dane's (cocaine)
(?) for lifers, the TEC kept us righteous
'Cause yes expect the crisis, when it's connects and prices
I had to hustle harder, move up my muscle merger
Seen New Jack City, cop me a couple Carters
And that's word to my father, send a bird to my father
Dove love, R.I.P. on his early departure
I'm just merely an author, but I'm purely a baller
Every Friday, 'cross the street, and I creep with Ms. Parker
[Chorus: Jaheim]
Get the whips, the kicks, and clothes

So we can get with the models (all of the reasons)
And hit the strip with the Dip, we're 'Set to blow
Now you know, all of the reasons why we chase the dough

Get the whips, the kicks, and clothes
So we can get with the models (all of the reasons)

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Killa! Uhh
I'm that nigga man, let me break it down real simple for y'all
Uhh, listen, yo, and I'm very prestigious (very)
You have various leases
All my pieces, painted them, cherry and peaches
Chics, Cherry and Peaches
They had cherry deheaters
If I want a toast, hustled up various reefer
Ithaca, Indica, hydro, Y-O
Haze on delivery, live hoes, five fo'
But kept the fo'-five, for wise guys with eyes low
Pick me up from fo'-five, CL-55, whoa!
Playin' Grand Theft Auto, they like Diablo
My crews' the triad, Zeek, Santana, Capo!
But they some slimmies who
Can rock a Jimmy Choo shoe
Next day velour sweatsuit, construction Timmy boots
Don't be no guinea boo, you rock that Fendi you
You drinkin' Henny too
Coupe color is Winnie Pooh
And they skinny who, they had my favorite rum
Not a six-fo-five-fo, but made in jump
Shout Che Che La Funk, he keep the K in pump
He ain't never scared, never scared, raise the trunk
We'll just lay and dump, play the punk, spray the chump
The way they running I GUESS they could relate to Gump
Forrest, that is

Now, ever since a nigga was a seed
Only thing promised to me was the penitentiary, still ballin'
Ridin' on these niggas ‘cause they lame
In a 6-1 Chevy, still heavy in this game—can you feel me?
Blame it on my mama, I'm a thug nigga
Up before the sun rise, quicker than a drug dealer
Tell me if it's on, nigga, then we first to bomb
Bust on these bitch-made niggas, hit 'em up, WESTSIDE!
Ain't nobody loved me as a broke nigga
Finger on the trigger, Lord forgive me if I smoke niggas
I love my females strapped, then fuck her from the back
I get my currency in stacks, California is where I'm at
Ridin', pass by while these niggas wonder why
I got shot but didn't die, let 'em see who's next to try
Did I cry? Hell nah, nigga, tears shed
For all my homies in the pen', many peers dead; nigga, still ballin'

Still ballin' until I die (Until I die)

When these guns involved, I become a dangerous man

Question is: will you fuck-niggas ride for real, huh?
Bitch nigga, this is G-rated
Plus your homeboy won't make it, street game Fugazi
I'm elevated to the top of this shit
Done fucked around and put me and 2Pac on the bitch

And I ride for any nigga who believe in the shit; still ballin'

You can bring your crew, but we remain true, motherfucker

Two murdered on the front page
Shot to death, bullets to the head

Motherfuckers know I'm comin', so they runnin' to their graves
Watch! Swoop down with my nigga from the Pound
‘Cause Trick don't give a fuck
Where you coward niggas now?

Busters thought we was frontin'
So reload and keep dumpin'; still ballin'

It’s Been a Long Time,Rakim,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: Samples with Scratches by DJ Premier]
“It’s been a long time” (x4)
“Rakim… the microphone soloist”

[Verse 1: Rakim]
Follow procedures, the crowd couldn’t wait to see this
Nobody been this long-awaited since Jesus
Who wouldn’t believe this? I heard the word on the street is
I’m still one of the deepest on the mic since Adidas
They said I changed the times from the rhymes that I thought of
So I made some more to put the New World in Order
With mathematics, put your status above the average
And help you rappers make paragraphs with graphics
‘Cause new days is dawnin', new ways of performin'
Brainstormin', I write and watch the night turn to mornin'
On and on and, I got the whole world respondin'
Rock, I keep it hot, blow the spot without warnin'
The emperor well-known for inventin' a sentence full of adventure
Turnin' up the temperature
Rush with adrenaline, how long has it been again
To be in the state of mind that Rakim is in?

When I’m out proppin', either hangin' or shoppin'
People see me, stop and ask me when the album droppin'
The wait is over, in formation like a soldier
Like I told ya; greater, stronger, now that I’m older
I broke the code of silence with overloads of talents
My only challenge is not to explode in violence
I’m Asiatic, and blazin' microphones' a habit
At least once durin' the course of a day — it’s automatic
In ghetto apparel, mind of a Egyptian pharaoh
Far from shallow, thoughts travel like an arrow
Allah’s monotony, so far, they can’t stop me
You know Ra want property like Muammar Gaddafi
More thoughts than Bibles, recitals taught disciples
A sawed-off mic, so words scatter like a rifle
Thoughts that’s trifle, I’m bustin' these for you
Aye yo, technical difficulties is through

[Verse 3: Rakim]
When I flow tonight, I'll show ‘em new heights I go to write
They know I strike with new prototypes to blow the mic
Critics and biters don’t know where my source of light is
Still leave authors and writers with arthritis
Cursed kids like the pyramids when they found the style
First to ever let a rhyme flow down the Nile
The rebirth of hip-hop’ll be dropped now
‘Cause the crowd didn’t hear the original in a while
So be alarmed, what you ‘bout to see is the bomb
Like 3D in ‘Nam, vivid like CD-Rom
Info kept like internet.com
My notebook’s my bond like the Holy Quran
Since I came in the door, said it before
But, no, I ain’t down with Eric B. no more

Dont Sweat the Technique,Eric B. & Rakim,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
Don't sweat the technique
Don't sweat the technique

[Verse 1]
Let's trace the hits and check the file
Let's see who bit to detect the style
I flip the script so they can't get foul
At least not now, it'll take a while
I change the pace to complete the beat
I drop the bass 'til MCs get weak
For every word they trace, it's a scar they keep
'Cause when I speak, they freak to sweat the technique
I made my debut in '86
With a melody and a President's mix
And now I stay on target and refuse to miss
And I still make hits with beats
Parties, clubs, in the cars and jeeps
My underground sound vibrates the streets
MCs wanna beef, then I play for keeps
When they sweat the technique
[Hook]
Don't sweat the technique
Don't sweat the technique

[Verse 2]
They wanna know how many rhymes have I ripped and wrecked
But researchers never found all the pieces yet
Scientists try to solve the context
Philosophers are wondering what's next
Pieces are took to labs to observe 'em
They couldn't absorb 'em, they didn't deserve 'em
My ideas are only for the audience's ears
For my opponents, it might take years
Pencils and pens are swords
Letters put together from a key to chords
I'm also a sculpture, formed with structure
Because of my culture, I'm equipped to construct the
Technical styles that'll be full of technology
Complete sights and new heights after I get deep
You don't have to speak, just seek
And peep the technique

[Hook]
Never sweat the technique

[Verse 3]
I speak indiscreet 'cause talk is cheap
Then I get deep in the beat then complete the
Poem's physique, never weak or obsolete
They never grow old, techniques become antiques
Better then something brand new 'cause it's real
And in a while the style’ll have much more value
Classical, too intelligent to be radical
Masterful, never irrelevant, mathematical
Here's some soothing souvenirs
For all the years, you fought and sought the thoughts and ideas
It's cool when you freak to the beat
But don't sweat the technique

Never sweat the technique
Don't sweat the technique
Don't sweat the technique"
Trying to Find a Balance,Atmosphere,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
They love the taste of blood
Now I don't know what that means, but I know that I mean it
Maybe they're as evil as they seem
Or maybe I only look out the window when it's scenic
Atmosphere finally made a good record
Yeah right, that shit almost sounds convincing
The last time I felt as sick and contradictive as this
Was the last time we played a show in Cincy
""Get real"", they tell me
If only they knew how real this life really gets
They would stop acting like a silly bitch
They would respect the cock whether or not they believed in it

[Verse 1]
Doesn't take much and that's messed up
Because these people do a lot of simple shit to impress us
While everyone was trying to out-do the last man
I was just a ghost trying to catch some Ms. Pac-man
Hello ma'am, would you be interested
In some sexual positions and emotional investments
See, I'm not insane, in fact I'm kind of rational
When I be asking, ""Yo where did all the passion go?""
East coast, West coast, down South, Midwest
Nowadays everybody knows how to get fresh
Somebody give me a big yes
God bless America, but she stole the B from Bless (and kept it)
Now I'm too fucked up to dance
So I'mma sit with my hand down the front of my pants
You can't achieve your goals if you don't take that chance
So go pry open that trunk and get those amps
[Chorus]
In the days of Kings and Queens I was a jester
Treat me like a God or they treat me like a leper
You see me move back and forth between both
I'm trying to find a balance
I'm trying to build a balance

[Verse 2]
So now I keep a close eye on my pets
Because they make most of they moves off of instinct and scents
It's eat, sleep, fuck, and self-defense
So straight you can set your clocks and place bets
Wait, let's prey on the blind, deaf, dumb, dead
Hustle, maybe a couple will love what you said
Emcees drag their feet across a big naked land
With an empty bag of seed and a fake shake of hand
Yeah, I got some last words, fuck all of ya'll
Stop writing raps and go play volleyball
Gotta journey the world in a hurry
Cause my attorney didn't put enough girls on the jury
Guilty of dropping these bombs in the city
But I'm innocent, love is the motive, that's why I'm killing 'em
Guilty of setting my fire in all fifty
But I'm innocent, blame it on my equilibrium

[Chorus]
In the days of Kings and Queens I was a jester
Treat me like a God or they treat me like a leper
You see me move back and forth between both
I'm trying to find a balance
I'm trying to build a balance
[Outro]
Now all my friends are famous
It's either one thing or another
They all don't know what my name is
Probably know both of my brothers
The one is a hard workin' savior
The other's a hard workin' soldier
I'm just your next-door neighbor
Working hard at tryin' to stay sober
You wait for the car at the corner
Pretend like you know what the plot is
Won't quit till I hit California
And make you my Golden State goddess"
Juice Know the Ledge,Eric B. & Rakim,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Eric B]

[Verse 1]
Sip the juice, I got enough to go around
And the thought takes place Uptown
I grew up on the sidewalk where I learned street talk
And then taught to hawk New York
I go to Queens for queens, then get the crew from Brooklyn
Make money in Manhattan and never been tooken
Go Uptown in The Bronx to Boogie Down
Get Strong on the Island, recoup and lay around
Time to build my juice back up
Props stack up, suckers get smacked up
Don't doubt the clout, you know what I'm about
Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
Shakin' 'em up, wakin' 'em up
Breakin' 'em up, rakin' 'em up
Standin' on shaky ground too close to the edge
Let's see if I Know the Ledge

Corner's triflin' 'cause shorty's here
I get cock-D liftin' forties of beer
Here's a sip for the crew that's deceased
If I get revenge, then they rest in peace
Somebody gotta suffer, I just might spare one
And give a brother a fair one
Stay alert and on P's, and I do work with these like Hercules
Switch to southpaw, split your right jaw
'Cause I don't like y'all, I'm hype when night fall
Smooth, but I move like an army
Bulletproof down in case brothers try to bomb me
Puttin' brothers to rest like Eliot Ness
'Cause I don't like stress
Streets ain't the place for innocent bystanders to stand
Nothing's gonna stop the plan
I'll chill like Pacino, kill like DeNiro
Black Gambino, die like a hero
Livin' on shaky grounds, too close to the edge

Shells lay around on the battleground
Dead bodies are found throughout the town
Try to put shame in my game to make a name
I'mma put it on a bullet, put it in your brain
Rip the block like a buckshot
Who cares where it goes? Just keep the casket closed
No remorse when a life is lost
I paid my dues, paid the cost
And my pockets are still fat
Wherever I'm at, I get the welcome mat
Even if my crew asleep, I'm one deep
I attract attention, people like to peep
So come say hi to the bad guy
Don't say goodbye, I don't plan to die
'Cause I get loose and I got troops, and crazy juice
In control of many like Ayatollah Khomeini
Hang out with Smith and Wess', don't try to play me
I'm at war a lot, like Anwar Sadat
But no warnin' shot, my gun is warm a lot
When I cook beef, the smoke will never clear
Areas in fear 'cause this here's severe
Livin' life too close to the edge
Hopin' that I Know the Ledge

[Verse 4]
A brand new morn', no time to yawn
Shower's on, power's on
Late for school, I catch the train
Girls sip the style and whisper my name
I push up like an exercise
Check they intellect and inspect the thighs
Select the best one, pull her to the side
Keep her occupied for the rest of the ride
Read her my résumé, she know already? Cool
Just meet me after school
We can moan and groan until your moms come home
And you'll be callin' me Al ""Dope"" Capone
Sweatin' me, she didn't want to let me loose
Come get me, that's if you want to sip the juice
'Cause the streets await me, so I take my gun off safety
'Cause a lot of niggas hate me
Comin' out of the building, they set me up
Sprayed with automatics, they wet me up
In a puddle of blood, I lay close to the edge
I guess I didn't Know the Ledge"
Microphone Fiend,Eric B. & Rakim,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse: Rakim]
I was a fiend before I became a teen
I melted microphones instead of cones of ice cream
Music orientated so when hip hop was originated
Fitted like pieces of puzzles complicated
'Cause I grabbed the mic and try to say, ""Yes y'all""
They tried to take it and say that I'm too small
Cool 'cause I don't get upset
I kick a hole in the speaker pull the plug then I jet
Back to the lab without a mic to grab
So then I add all the rhymes I had
One after the other one, then I make another one
To this the opposite then ask if the brother's done
I get a cravin' like I fiend for nicotine
But I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean?
I'm ragin', rippin' up the stage and
Don't it sound amazin' 'cause every rhyme is made and
Thought of, 'cause it's sort of an addiction
Magnetized by the mixing
Vocals, vocabulary, your verses, you're stuck in
The mic is a Drano, volcanoes eruptin'
Rhymes overflowin', gradually growin'
Everything is written in the cold, so it can coincide
My thoughts to guide
Forty eight tracks to slide
The invincible, microphone fiend, Rakim
Spread the word 'cause I'm in
E-F-F-E-C-T, a smooth operator operating correctly
But back to the problem, I got a habit
You can't solve it, silly rabbit
The prescription is a hyper tone that's thorough when
I fiend for a microphone like heroin
Soon as the bass kicks, I need a fix
Give me a stage and a mic and a mix
And I'll put you in a mood or is it a state of
Unawareness, beware, it's the re animatora menace to a microphone, a lethal weapon
An assassinator, if the people ain't steppin'
You see a part of me that you never seen
When I'm fiendin' for a microphone, I'm the microphone fiend
After twelve, I'm worse than a Gremlin
Feed me hip-hop and I start tremblin'
The thrill of suspense is intense, you're horrified
But this ain't the cinemas of ,'Tales From the Darkside'
By any means necessary, this is what has to be done
Make way 'cause here I come
My DJ cuts material, grand imperial
It's a must that I bust any mic you hand to me
It's inherited, it runs in the family
I wrote the rhyme that broke the bull's back
If that don't slow 'em up, I carry a full pack
Now I don't wanna have to let off, you should of kept off
You didn't keep the stage warm, step off
Ladies and gentleman, you're about to see
A pastime hobby about to be
Take it to the maximum, I can't relax see, I'm
Hype as a hypochondriac 'cause the rap be one
Hell of a antidote, somethin' you can't smoke
More than dope, you're tryin' to move away but you can't, you're broke
More than cracked up, you should have backed up
For those who act up need to be more than smacked up
Any entertainer, I got a torture chamber
One on one and I'm the remainder
So close your eyes and hold your breath
And I'ma hit you with the blow of death
Before you go, you'll remember you seen
The fiend of a microphone, I'm the microphone fiend
[Outro]
The microphone fiend
The microphone fiend
The microphone fiend"
Not Yet Free,The Coup,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1 - Boots]
In this land I can't stand or sit
And not get shit thrown up in my face
A brother never gets his props
I'm doing bellyflops at the department of waste
And everyday I pulls a front so nobody pulls my card
I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice looking hard
I'm lookin behind me beside me ahead of me
There'll be no feet making tracks here instead of me
But I can't disregard just what the news says to me
I'm twenty-one, so I've reached my life expectancy
At any minute I could be in some shit that kills my skinny ass
From motherfuckers doin the sellout strut or probably Oakland task
My relationship with OPD has been like one big dis
Long arm of the law grips my dick so tight it's hard to even piss
Oh, I forgot, ain't even got a pot to do it in
Up at the church they're tellin me it's because I live in sin
So I grin, but nevertheless my mind won't dwell
I must be trippin cause I thought I was livin in hell
Capitalism is like a spider, the web is getting tighter
I'm struggling like a fighter, just to bust loose
It's like a noose asyphyxiation sets in
Just when I think I'm free it seems to me the spider steps in
This web is made of money made of greed made of me
Of what I have become in a parasite economy
[Verse 2 - E-Roc]
In the winter there's a splinter with the smell of the rain
And the scent of the street, but all I smell is the pain
Of a brother who's a hustler and he's stuck to the grind
Of a sister who's a hooker, got to sell her behind
Desperation makes a brotha get a little more bold
The circumstance gets deeper when it's damp and it's cold
So I spend my time thinking bout the ultimate gank
Can I get my crew together, pull a move on a bank?
I be the picture perfect hustler for the piece of the pie
But my daddy always taught me just to reach for the sky
Now my dream and aspirations go from single to whole
As I realize there's a million motherfuckers in the cold
No need to be told, cause when you got a million po' people
Gettin ganked, by a few that are rich and evil
But it's illegal, to wonder how they livin fat
(One two three) everybody get a gat

[Verse 3 - Boots]
Ahhhhhh yeah
Niggas, thugs, dope dealers and pimps
Basketball players, rap stars, and simps
That's what little black boys are made of
Sluts, hoes, and press the naps around your neck
Broads pop that coochie, bitches stay in check
That's what little black girls are made of
But if we're made of that who made us
And what can we do to change us
The oppressor tries to tame us
Here's a foot for his anus!
Well since the days when I was shittin in diapers
It was evident the President didn't like us
Assassination attempts, I'd root for the snipers
My teacher told me that I didn't know what right was
Well, she was wrong cause I knew what a right was
And a left and an uppercut, too
I had a hunch a sucker punch is what my people got
That's why I was constantly red, black, and blue"

Woke up this mornin' (Yeah)
You got yourself a gun (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Got yourself a gun

[Chorus: Nas & Alabama 3]
Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines, so
I got mine, I hope you got yourself a gun
You from the hood, I hope you got yourself a gun
You want beef? Hope you got yourself a gun
And when I see you, I'ma take what I want, so
You tried to front, hope you got yourself a gun
You ain't real, hope you got yourself a gun

[Verse 1: Nas]
My first album had no famous guest appearances
The outcome, I'm crowned the best lyricist
Many years on this professional level
Why would you question who's better? The world is still mine
Tattoo's real, with ""God's Son"" across the belly, the boss of rap
You saw me in Belly with thoughts like that
To take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie
Me and 2Pac were soldiers of the same struggle
You lames could huddle, your team's shook
Y'all feel the wrath of a killer, 'cause this is my football field
Throwin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads, apparel
But the QB don't stand for no quarterback
Every word is like a sawed-off blast 'cause y'all all soft
And I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in
It's for the hood by the corner store
Many try, many die, come at Nas if you want a war, get it bloody

Barber's preciseness, Bravehearted for life, it's
Return of the golden child, son of a blues player
So who are you, player? Y'all awaited the true savior
Puffin' that tropical, cups of that vodka, too
Papi chu's, tore up, wake up in a hospital
Throw up? Never, 'member I do this through righteous steps
You Judas thought I was gone, so in light of my death
Y'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos
Call me God's Son with my pants low
I don't die slow, put them rags up like Petey Pablo
This is NASDAQ though, in my Nascar, with this Nas flow
What could beat that? Not a soul reppin'
Hit the record store, never let me go, get my whole collection, yo

I got mine, I hope you got yourself a gun
You from the hood, I hope you got yourself a gun
You want beef? Hope you got yourself a gun

You tried to front, hope you got yourself a gun
You ain't real, hope you got yourself a gun

It's the return of the prince, the boss
This is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit soft
Sip Cris', get chips, wrist glist', I floss
Stick shift look sick up in that Boxster Porsche
With the top cut off, rich kids go and cop The Source
They don't know about the blocks I'm on
And everybody wanna know where the kid go
Where he rest at, where he shop at and dress at
Know he got dough, where does he live? Is he still in the Bridge?
Does he really know how ill that he is?
Got all of y'all watchin' my moves, my watch and my jewels
Hop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that
It's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains
Look at my tennis shoes, I iced that
Who am I? The back twister, lingerie ripper
Automatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter
Keepin' it gangsta with ya (Uh)

A Life in the Day of Benjamin André Incomplete,OutKast,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse]
I met you in a club in Atlanta, Georgia
Said me and my homeboy were coming out with an album
You looked at me like, ""Yeah, nigga, right""
But you gave me your number anyway, you were on the talcum
Powder—how's about them oranges?
Moved away from home to school with big plans
By day, studied the history of music
By night, just to pay for that shit, you'd dance
To get your pants was a Mission Impo–ssible
We were both the same age, but I
Suppose, wasn't on the same page, but in
The same book of life, so I'd page you when
I felt you that were getting off of work
Or either when you're on your way to school
We started hanging like Ernie and Bert
And in my idle head, I'm thinking, ""Cool""
Just when I think I'm going down your shirt
You're hiking up your skirt now
The events that followed had me volley
If your hometown would be Heaven or Hell
The angelic nastiness you possessed made you by far the best
Therefore, hard to tell
You'd drop me off by the Dungeon
Never came in, but I knew that you were wondering
""Now, are these niggas in this house up to something?
Selling crack, sack by sack, so they could function?""
W-W-Well, yes and no
Yes, we were selling it, but no, it wasn't blow
Cook it in the basement, then move it at a show
Then grab the microphone, and everybody yelled, ""Ho!""
Meanwhile, the video starts playing
BET, college radio, and a van
Packed full of niggas with a blunt in their hand
And one in they ear—you know what I'm saying, but
I kept your number in my old phone
Got a new chip-flip with the roam-roam
So it took me a minute to retrieve seven digits
But I promised I would call you when I got home, but
When I got home, I never did
By the time I did, heard that you'd had a kid
By some nigga in Decatur who replied, ""See you later""
When he got the good news—that's life, shit
Now, I'm nineteen with a Cadillac
My nigga had a Lex with the gold pack
Got a plaque, but I'm living with my Pop-Pop
So I got a Glock and a LoJack
Yeah, kinda fast for that fella in class who used to draw
And never said much, 'cause half of what he saw
Was so far from that place you wanna be
That words only fucked it up more; follow me
Are you starting to gather what I'm getting at?
Now if I'm losing you, tell me, then I'll double back
But keep in mind: At the time, ""Keep it real"" was the phrase
Silly when said now, but those were the days
When Spring Break and Daytona
And Freakniks made you wanna
Drop out of college and never go back
Move to the South, but that ain't a Kodak
Moment, on went myself and Big Bo—
Well, you knew hm as ""'Twan""
That's right—you were around before this shit begun
Well 'Twan had a daughter and
Sorta was made to mature before the first tour
We hit the road like Jack
Laughed and cried and drive it back with some 'gnac
Girls used to say, ""Y'all talk funny. Y'all from the islands?""
And I'd laugh, and they'd just keep smiling
""No, I'm from Atlanta, baby, he from Savannah, maybe
We should hook up and get tore up and then lay down; hey, we
Gotta go because the bus is pulling out in thirty minutes""
She's playing tennis, disturbing the tenants
Fifteen-love, fit like glove
Description is like fifteen doves
In a jacuzzi catching the Holy Ghost
Making one woozy in the head and comatose—agree?
Enough about me, how's about you? How's the lil' kid?
She was about two the last time we spoke
I hadn't smoked or took a shot of drink
'Cause I'd start the second album off on another note; now—
That note threw some niggas in the hood off
But see, I'd balled out, and 'fore I'd fall out
I'd slow my Lac down to a nice speed
The brain was that fried egg, I might need
New direction was apparent
I was a child looking at the floor, staring
So changing my style was like relief for the primitive beast
Yes, I was on the rise, yeast was the street
To make bread, never primary concern
Just to hop on these beats and wait my turn
I'd meet Muslims, gangstas, bitches, rastas
And macaroni niggas: ""impastas""
So on a trip to New York on some beeswax
I get invited to a club where emcees at
And on stage is a singer with some thing on her head
Similar to the turban that I covered up my dreads with
Which I was rocking at the time
When I was going through them phases trying to find
Anything that seemed real in the world
Still searching, but I started liking this girl
Now, you know her as Erykah ""On & On"" Badu
Call Tyrone on the phone, ""Why you
Do that girl like that, boy? You ought to be ashamed""
The song wasn't about me, and that ain't my name
Were young, in love; in short, we had fun
No regrets, no abortion, had a son
By the name of Seven
And he's five; by the time I do this mix, he'll probably be six
You do the 'rithmetic, me do the language arts
Y'all stand against the wall blindfolded; we throw the darts
To poke you in the heart and take you from the start
To when luxury transportation meant a MARTA card
Or either when your girlfriend that went to Mays' mama
Or her daddy let her borrow the Benz, because she smart
Or maybe if your neighbor does you a huge favor
And he sells you that Rabbit that's been sitting in his yard
You fix it up, you trick it out
You give it rims, you give it bump
You give it all your time because that's all you can think about
And that's as far as I got
(*music fades*)
[Radio Interview]
""And that's as far as I got, and where I wanted to go, knowing, the whole summer, that's all you could think about. Even though if you cut it off and start that bitch up, you need a jump, like you need and you want to grow, and you change all the time. So that Rabbit that you thought about that whole summer—the next summer, you didn't want that Rabbit no more. You wanted something bigger and better.""
""So the summer passed and now the Rabbit's old?""
""Right... right, so now you want a Cadillac..."""

Every time I get on this microphone, I like to spit
Inking hit up after hit, this penmanship is so legit
I came equipped like a prophylactic, now they riding dicks
Like styling on these suckers out here tryna buy they bitch
Now they rich, try convince everybody to trick off
But a true boss done paid the cost, she giving away them drawers
Word to the brown, James, he some chicken chow mein
Really, mayne, you done said the silly things
And the fella Dana Dane, boy, you cuffed and claimed a dame
Hey, my main thang got my last name, yah dah dah mean?
Ha, ha, ha, ha

I—I'm on my grind, shawty
Don't block my shine, shawty (What?)
Hold up, hold up, guess who just showed up?
Rolled up, Rolls cut', drop with the doors up

Don't block my shine, shawty
Wait a minute (Wait a minute), chill a little, sit a minute
I can't close my safe no more, 'cause I got too much money in it

They put Gucci in a cell, then Madea went to jail (Well damn)
I make music, I make movies, I make Tyler Perry sales
Loud smell coming out the Lamb, fuck it, what the hell
Gucci Mane, so I'm Gucci'd down, she got on Chanel (Chanel)
In the cut, rolling stupid kush like I'm in a rush
In the club with a half a pound, hunnid-fifty blunts
Zone 6, East Atlanta's own, fuck with me the long...(Gucci)
So I shine like it's showtime, all my jewelry on (Brr, brr, brr, brr)
On the block with my stupid watch, boy, you need to stop
When I stop, everybody watch, car don't have a top (Nyoom)
In a stretch, cost a stupid check, roll another pack (Racks)
And I'm gone, I can't even flex; Eastside, where you at?
It's Gucci!

I can't close my safe no more, 'cause I got too much—
[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Can't be tripping 'bout no paper 'cause the safe is not so safe
The piggy bank got legs and feet
And can get up and walk away, shawty
With my southern drawl, awkwardly I spray
Like the backside of a skunk, in the stash house with the pump
Pistol grip in my lap at all times in the 'Lac
From Atlanta to Savannah, can't a nigga stop that
Not when God's got his hands on me, only the strong surviving
The weak-minded are falling by the wayside, they try
But we shall overcome and succeed, indeed
With success, there comes a great responsibility
We chose to lead, not follow; it's a hard pill to swallow
Better get prescriptions filled 'cause there might not be tomorrow
Ha, ha, ha, ha

The whole city is mine, prettiest Don
I don't like the way P. Diddy did Shyne with different lawyers
Why it's mentioned in my rhymes? Fuck it
It's just an intro, hate it or love it, like it, bump it or dump it
Write it, across the stomach spell ""God son""
Life is like a jungle, black, it's like the habitat of Tarzan
Matter of fact, it's harder than most can imagine
Most of my niggas packed in correctional facilities
Half of them passed on, MAC strong, couple of shots
Made the ghost leave a body, now they hauntin' the block
Where they used to stand at, somebody's takin' they place
A younger man perhaps, hand slaps, can't understand that
Same walk, same talk, I wonder can that be possible?
A thug dies, another step inside his shoes
And they will hurt you, layin' low with a bottle
I'm blowin' circles, my state of mind purple

Light it, light it, uhh
Yeah… light it up
Light it up, uhh

[Verse 2]
Y'all just wanna deal with drama
Talk about niggas who got things, y'all ready to kill his mama
Everything you into is underworld related
You sell your man out, not even your girl is sacred
You don't trust a soul, hold up, you moldin' soldiers
To pull guns quick and always look behind the shoulder
Think of how many dudes died tryna be down with you
Everybody's under six feet of ground, but you
Still standin', still roamin' through the streets, that's real
You a survivor, knowin' all the beef is ill
You got a bunch of thugs with you even now that's ready
Trustin' your judgment, quick to put it down, they deadly
The hood love you, but behind your back, they pray for the day
A bullet hit your heart and ambulances take you away
That ain't love, it's hate, think of all the mothers at wakes
Whose sons you killed and you ain't got a cut on your face?
Unmarked police cars roam the streets hard, the heat is God
Somebody tell these shorties reach for the stars
Instead they tell 'em how to reach through the bars holdin' a mirror
Lookin' down a tear in jail, makin' weapons to kill ya
Weed smoke, three tokes, nigga, pour more Henny
He sighs with eyes that seen a war too many
Cold-blooded murderers, universal
Hood to hood, blowin' smoke, state of mind is purple

Light it up, light it up, light it up, uhh
Light it up… light it up, light it up, uhh
Uhh… uhh, uhh, light it, light it, uhh

[Verse 3]
These hot-headed youngsters always get into trouble
Reactin' before thinkin', they easily irritated
And murder's premeditated, it's a fact that we sinkin'
When we should be climbin', in a nutshell, it's just jail
Drug sales, liquor and diamonds, niggas rewindin'
Instead of movin' forward to blow up, so what's the science?
People shoutin', police pushin' the crowd
And on the ground's a young soldier with meat hangin' out him
Am I hallucinatin' off the hazin'?
Or did I just see a nigga shoot another nigga's face in?
It's a ugly nation, cops circle the block with mug shots
Photograph pictures of suspect faces
It's usually two or three niggas who innocent
But if they lock the wrong ones up, then someone'll snitch
A divide-and-fall strategy, they aren't fair
I dig in my bag of weed that's covered with orange hair
This Color Purple'll make Whoopi give me the pussy
And Celie, Oprah and Danny Glover gots to feel me
This is how I escape the madness
Too much of anything'll hurt you, so my state of mind's all purple"

But sometimes, it's like that I love me more
I love the peace, and I love the war
I love the seas, and I love the shore
No love for no beach; baby, that's law
But she doesn't see, therefore I spoil
I trick, I fall, run up in raw
I love her with all my heart
Every vein, every vessel, every bullet lodged
With every flower that I ever took apart
She said that she would give me greatness, status
Placement above the others
My face would grace covers of the magazines of the hustlers
Paper, the likes of which that I had never seen
Her eyes glow green with the logo of our dreams
The purpose of our scene, an obscene obsession for the bling
She would be my queen, I could be her king, together
She would make me cool, and we would both rule, forever
And I would never feel pain
And never be without pleasure, ever again
And if the rain stops, and everything's dry
She would cry just so I can drink the tears from her eyes
She'd teach me how to fly, even cushion my fall
If my engines ever stall and I plummet from the sky
But she will keep me high, and if I ever die
She would commission monuments on her bosom to him
Or maybe she'd retire as well
A match made in Heaven set the fires in Hell, and I'll be

Younger outstanding achieving up-and-comers
The ones that had deadbeat daddies and well-to-do mommas
But not well enough to keep 'em from us
The ones that were fighting in class, who might not pass
Rap record-pressured to laugh at a life not fast
""Can you feel it?"" That's what I got asked
""Do I love her?"" Said, ""I don't know""
Streets got my heart, game got my soul
One time missing sunshine will never hurt your soul
Quote to a crying, dishonored baby mama
Who's the mama to a daughter that I had fathered from afar
My new lady gave me a Mercedes
And a necklace with a solid gold key like the starter of a car
The opener of a door, or two pounds of raw
You gave me a baby, but what about lately?
Then ha-ha-ha-ha-ha'd, right up in her face, G
There's more fish in the sea, I'm on my mission to be, be
[Chorus]
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
Lord please have sympathy
And forgive Michael Young History as
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what

[Verse 3]
Come, these are the tales of The Cool
Guaranteed to go and make you fail from your school
And seek unholy grails like a fool
And hang with the players of the pool
Fast-talking on the hustle
No Heaven up above you, no Hell underneath ye
And no one will receive thee
So shed no tear when we're not here
And keep your faith as we chase
The Cool

[Outro]
(Cool!)"
Penny for a Thought,Saul Williams,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Cancel the apocalypse!
Cartons of the milky way with pictures of a missing planet
Last seen in pursuit of an American dream
This fool actually thinks he can drive his hummer on the moon
Blasting DMX off the soundtrack of a South Park cartoon
Niggas used to buy their families out of slavery
Now we buy chains and links, smokes and drinks
They're paying me to record this, even more if you hear it
Somebody tell me what you think I should do with the money
Yes, friend, tell me what you think I should do with the money
Exactly how much is it gonna cost to free Mumia?
What's he gonna do with his freedom? Talk on the radio?
Radio programming is just that - a brain washed and gleamed of purpose
To be honest, some freedom of speech makes me nervous
And you, looking for another martyr in the form of a man
Hair like a mane with an outstretched hand
In a world of harsh thoughts, reactionary defensiveness, and counter-intelligence
What exactly is innocence?
Fuck it, I do believe in the existence of police brutality
Who do I make checks payable to? (How 'bout I pay you in prayers?)
A young child stares at a glowing screen, transfixed by tales of violence
His teenage father tells him that *that*'s life, not that Barney shit
A purple dinosaur that speaks of love, a black man that speaks of blood
Which one is keeping it real, son?
Who manufactured your steel, son?
Hardcore, ancient elements at the earth's core
Fuck it, I'mma keep speaking 'til my throat soars
An emcee told a crowd of hundreds
To put their hands in the air
An armed robber stepped to a bank and told everyone
To put their hands in the air
A Christian minister gives his benediction while the congregation
Hold their hands in the air
Love the image of the happy Buddha
With his hands in the air
Hands up if you're confused. Define tomorrow
Your belief system ain't louder than my car system
Nigga walked down my block with his rottweiler, a subwoofer on a leash
Each one teach one
The DJ spins a new philosophy into a barren mind
I can't front on it
My head nods as if to clear the last image from an etch-a-sketch
Something like Rakim said:
I could quote any emcee, but why should I?
How would it benefit me?
Karmic repercussions
Are your tales of reality worth their sonic laced discussions?
Suddenly, the ground shivers and quakes
A newborn startles and wakes
Her mother rushes to her bed side to hold her to her breast
Milk of sustenance heals and nourishes
From the depths of creation life still flourishes
Yet we focus on death and destruction, violence, corruption
My people, let Pharaoh go
What have you bought into? How much will it cost to buy you out?
What have you bought into? How much will it cost to buy you out?
What have you bought into? How much will it cost to buy you out?
(spoken)
How much it gonna cost to buy you out of my mind?
Penny for a thought. Y'all niggas is half-steppin', wastin' my time
Please, nigga, what? You talkin to me?
Please baby, baby, baby can I borrow - canIborrow a nickle, a dime
A dime, a quarter?
Penny for a thought. Penny for a thought
How much will it cost to buy you out of
Buyin' into a reality that originally bought you?
Dime a dozen. Y'all niggas a dime a dozen
Penny for a thought, nigga. C'mon, penny for a thought
Think fast, think fast. C'mon, time is money

Time is money, money is time
So I keep 7 o'clock in the bank and gain interest in the hour of God
I'm saving to buy my freedom, God, grant me wings
I'm too fly not to fly
I soared further past humans without wings so I soar
And fine tickling the feathers of my wings
Flying hysterically over land. Numerically
I am seven mountains higher than the valley of death

Seven mountains higher than the valley of death
Seven dimensions deeper than dimensions of breath

We are performing an exorcism on all this keep-it-realism
Violent sensationalism
In the name of the hip hop that nurtured me, cultured me
We are ordering all evil entities to exit this body, leave this body
In the name of microphone fiends and a young boy's b-boy dreams
We told you to leave this body, leave this body
All evil entities, all wannabe emcees
Decoys, decoys
Send in the true b-boys, the true b-boys
Be men, motherfuckers. Be men
In the name of Scott La Rock
In the name of T-La Rock
Motherfuckers that remember how to do the reebok
Walk, hop
I told you to leave this body

Murder Rap,Above the Law,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: KMG]
""Yo, Cold 187. They tryin' to give you a murder rap. And you ain't even like that. Yo, serve these niggas, 'cause they deserve to get dissed.""
(Yeah)
(Check this out)

[Verse 1: Cold 187um]
When I sit down and write and recite for the mic I hold
Make sure my beats are loud and bold and Cold
187, that is my name, makin' it simple and plain
Here to rearrange and change
The things that I couldn't do in the past
Don't be surprised when you got a shotgun up your ass
Perpetrators, that one was just for you
I'm gonna leave ya in your seat remaining without a clue
Glued to my style like a fiend on coke
But if you say the wrong thing, I wash your mouth out with soap
Dope, is not the answer
No, I'm not a Cancer
No, I'm not a hero or zero
But a Leo in stereo
And this is not a demo
K-Oss and Go Mack be cuttin' the flex tempo fast
[Hook]
Now I got a murder rap
'Cause a brother like me said well
Now I got a murder rap
'Cause a brother like me said well
Now I got a murder rap
'Cause a brother like me said well
Now I got a murder rap
'Cause a brother like me said well

[KMG]
Yo, fingerprints ain't nuthin' without the murder weapon
Keep steppin'
Homicide tried to sweat, but we let 'em have it
You can see they fear through they teeth
Treat 'em like Rolaids and give 'em some relief

[Verse 2: Cold 187um]
I feel action speaks louder than words and verbs
And adjectives, I live the life, the given gift
Not who's first, second or third
Not he said or she said or what you heard, nerd
'Cause when you live like that, your life is mangled
In other words your life is all tangled up
I'm not a sucker, always go for mine
Powerlord that's hard from the start, and he will always (climb)
To the top as high as he can achieve
Sometimes that's even higher than the others believe
I'm not a doctor, not a poet, I don't have a degree
Not arrogant, egotistical, I'm the epitome
We take recon, these suckas are lying
Transform into another world as I recite these rhymes
187, he's as hard as it comes
And I don't have to brag
About the size of my gun, son
[Hook]
Now I got a murder rap
'Cause a brother like me said well
Now I got a murder rap
'Cause a brother like me said well
Now I got a murder rap
'Cause a brother like me said well

[KMG]
Criminals don't use lyrics and define themselves as notorious
Brothers gotta learn Hip Hop anger rages inside themselves
Your freedom will never resist to my contact K-Oss and the homie G

[Verse 3: Cold 187um]
187 breakin' back, backbone of my group
Fat kid in my posse and I'm gettin' loose
'Cause I'm takin' out posses, causin' bodily harm
Makin' moves to improve as I begin to brainstorm
I'm not inferior, not takin' no crap
Last sucker tried to diss me, cold got his neck slapped
'Cause power's my name, sometimes I'm insane
And if I get too mad, I have to rearrange
Your position as a MC, that's the way it should be
The way I get over, I use terminology
That's comprehensive, redemptive
That's evidently not related to the style that you hear everyday
B-boy destroyin' a toy, employin'
While the other suckers are depressed, I'm enjoyin'
What I'm doin', and ruin anyone's hope for my position
Tell em KMG, they on a mission
[KMG]
They on a mission
They keep wishin you can't come off
187, you're a menace in your own mind
So take heed and proceed with caution
When he rhymes

Now I got a murder rap
Here's a murder rap to keep ya dancin'
Now I got a murder rap
Cause a brother like me said well"
My Favorite Mutiny,The Coup,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1 - Black Thought]
Move, if you got the nerve
Lash out for your just deserts
It's not just a word
Some of y'all heads up in the clouds
I'mma bring y'all back to earth
It's Black back to burn
The Bullshit y'all talkin' 'bout
Out ya mouth. I'm not concerned
Cause y'all got to learn
It's y'all turn like Detroit Red
When his head had an ultra perm
The long walk will burn your bare heels
So throw on your boots
The game camouflaged like army suits
But I can see it more clear cause I came with the Coup in here
Ring the alarm and form the troops
Send 'em out into the world, go to war in a fluke
Eye to eye with the enemy you sworn to shoot
Now I'm comin' at ya neck, sick of hearing something wrong with me
Motherfucker something's wrong with you
With a Chief just way too smart to question
The enemy the brothers of a dark complexion
The governments of the world is shark infested
They heavy on weaponry like Charlton Heston
Man yeah it gets low here uh, real low
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
[HOOK]

[Verse 2 -Boots]
Death to the pigs is my basic statement
I spit street stories 'til I taste the pavement
Tryin' to stay out the pen while we face enslavement
Had a foolproof hustle 'til they traced the payments
I was grippin' my palm around some shitty rum
Tryin' to find psalm number 151
To forget what I'm owed, as I clutch the commode
And read ""put down the bottle and come get the gun""
Let's get off the chain like Kunta Kinte with a MAC-10
They want us gone like a dollar in a crack den
Steadily subtracting seeds & stems
Mind cloudy through the wheeze and phlegm
Numbing my brain off of that and the Jesus hymns
If we waiting for the time to fight, these is thems
Tellin' us to relax while they ease it in. We gettin greased again
The truth I write is so cold, It'll freeze my pen
I'm Boots Riley it's a pleasure to meet you
Never let they punk ass ever defeat you
They got us on the corner wearing pleather and see thru
All y'all's gold mines they wanna deplete you
I ain't just finna to rap on the track, I'm finna to clap on 'em back
And it's been stackin' to that
Five hundred years before Iceberg ever leaned back in the 'lac
Before they told Rosa black in the back
Before the CIA told Ricky Ross to put crack in the sack
And Gil-Scott tradin' rappin for smack
This beat alone should get platinum plaques
I'd rather see a million of us ecstatic to scrap
Cause if we bappin' 'em back we automatically stacked
[HOOK]

[Verse 3 - Talib Kweli]
This the cut like truancy
Riq, Boots and me
Activatin' the community
Up in the bay like Huey P
And sucker free, it remind me of the BKer's love for me
But the beast got it twisted, I'll untangle it
Black mind intertwined like the ropes they used to hang us with
This is my favorite shit, I came in the game with a new way to spit
That got you questioning who you bangin' with
Take it back to Imhotep
Go a step deeper like a Poor Righteous Teacher with Holy Intellect
Killer flow for all my real niggas left
But inform the family of the jigaboo that there's been a death
Once again you can feel hip-hop
Underground, still about my guap
Gangsta like, fuck the cops
Talib Kweli revolutionary MC, and that ain't about to stop

Always Coming Back Home to You,Atmosphere,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","To all my killers and my hundred dollar billers
To emo kids that got too many feelings

He held the register open while he counted her change
I was next in line which meant I was invisible
From where I stood I could see that the till was full
He didn't look the type to play superhero
So I stepped forth and paid for my cigarettes
Crept out the store's front door to chase a little breath
Bangles in my head, shake the song off
Another manic Monday night, its gonna be a long walk

A car pulled up, a fixed up Cutlass
A woman and a child climbed out and left it running
They went inside of the deli, placed an order
With the extra dollar fifty bottled water cause the daughter's picky
When they came out mommy gave me a glance
That said man can love an angel but he's got to take the chance
Already knew the deal, I lit one up and walked
So they got back in they Oldsmobile, belted up, and took off
Thug love on the corner by the Walgreens
Looking at me like I'm just another square Saltine
As I get closer I notice they showing each other sketches
Out of their notebooks, reminded me of my old roots

I walk past with a nod and a reminisce
Swear to god hip hop and comic books was my genesis
Respect the life and the fashions of the children
It's the only culture I've got, exactly what we've been building

All of a sudden I'm in front of some man
No, he's a young'un, but he's got a gun in his hand
He looks fifteen, he looks frantic, no, he looks afraid
Immediately apprehensive 'til I heard him say
""Do you want this? It's not mine, I promise
I found it on my block in between a couple garages
Didn't want to leave it for a child to stumble over
I don't even know how to hold it""

It was a thirty eight, the poor man's machete
Held it in my hand, thinking damn man it's heavier than expected
Wedged it behind my belt buckle
Knowing that it's evil, even thought that I could smell trouble
The extra strength felt weak
But over there on the corner saw what I needed
And proceeded to cross the street
Put the heat in the mail box to lose it
Figured that the post office knows what's best to do with it
Mosey down the road, thinking about the old
I used to roam this zone through two feet of snow
Right here, this used to be a record shop
I've gotten love, I've gotten drunk, I've gotten beat up in that parking lot
I've had my Lake Street pride for 3 decades
These alleyways, and these streetlights have seen my best days
Before I was a germ learning how to misbehave
All the way to the grave, south side is my resting place

Took a right on Lyndale I'm getting near
But then the road became empty and the people disappeared
The clouds ran away, opened up the sky
And one by one I watched every constellation die
And there I was frozen, standing in my backyard
Face to face, eye to eye, staring at the last star
I should've known, walked all the way home
To find that she wasn't here, I was still all alone

No matter where I am, no matter what I do
I'm always coming back home to you
They can leave me for dead they can take away my true
I'm always coming back home to you
Through the lies and the sins that ride the wind that blew
I'm always coming back home to you
As sure as the life in the garden that you grew
I'm always coming back home to you
No matter where I am, no matter what I do
I'm always coming back home to you
If only I had known what you already knew
I'm always coming back home to you
From the heaven I've had to the hell I been through
I'm always coming back home to you
I'm always coming back home to you"

Girlfriend on some hatin' shit
She like: ""Shit, that's Kells, bitch!”
And then I stop like red light
Scooped em up like hitch-hike
Then I let them come with me
Step up in club with one on each sleeve
Doug E. Fresh kid bout to spend that cheese
And after that you know they gonna leave with me
We out of here, get them to the crib
Straight to the mansion, show em how I live
And you can tell that the sex is major
Cause only one day later

Meet me right by Macy's, babe
Leave your purse, I'm crazy babe
Walk in and go crazy, babe

You play me in your car and you play me in your home
Now it's time to download Kells on your ringtone
From ghetto girls, college girls, all the way to strippers
To fine dro smokers and all the Henny sippers
Big chip spenders, big money tippers
At the bar taking shots with my niggas
No fake niggas, no hating niggas
But shots of Patron for all my real niggas
G-g-girls in the hotel getting it on
And they ain't leaving til six in the mornin'
Even superstar chicks too drunk to drive home
Wake up next day and, uh"

Yeah, I got money on my mind (Ah), that's why I'm twice on my grind (Grind)
I'm nice 'cause I rhyme like it's my life on that line (Line)
The second I'm provoked, I snap into a point that ain't controllable
Then, it's either war or another quotable (Ah)
Don't let me get a hold of you dudes, I murder you on camera
Get Kelly's lawyer and get a mole removed (Aha)
I probably shouldn't have said that—fuck y'all!
On the record, off the record—if I'm on the record, I'ma off the record (Ah)
I need a push when I'm tired of rhyming
Go 'head—diss me, 'cause me and George Bush got a lot in common
We both got no sense, we love to go to war
And we stay looking for weapons of mass destruction (Tss, ah)
This industry is Hilary Clinton, literally—listen
You ain't got no choice now—roll with a nigga
If you twisted enough to picture a devil mixed
With a angel that's sick, drunk inside a Range Ro'—that's this
Wish I could stick every rapper in this bitch in the building
Let 'em cypher while I fly a plane through that bitch (Tss, ah)
'Cause I hate y'all, I'm tri-polar with the eight-ball
I want you on my album, I'll pull out the K and make y'all (Brrrat!)

Wittiest! If you call a laptop ""a labtop""

Bitch, when Hell freeze over and Wayne sober up
By the way, fuck all DJs! I'm just kidding (I'm just kidding)

No intention of ever dying, nigga—life too sweet
Two words for who don't like me: ""Fight"" and ""me""

You at the top, you shot—your spot is now taken
Psychotic is the ploy; how the fuck you rapping and you gay?
And you been spotted with a boy, like a Dalmatian?
I switch up, I prolly be instantly selling
Got a clip full of pellets known as ""MC Repellent""
While you talking 'bout your money and I can't have none of it
I'll hit a nigga low, just for the Zab fun of it
I will never lose, never lost—I'ma prove it
Except for my virginity, but I was tryna lose it
I be on some Tom Cruise shit
Standing on the couch in the club, laughing 'bout my dime new chick (Oh!)
She the shit, but if you ask her, she useless
I'm in her pocket, 'cause I got a rocket down under, like Houston
So I'ma keep being me, and you should keep being you
If being you offends me, indeed, it's gon' be me and you

I said I used to keep the porch lights on
And now I keep the Porsche's lights on
Just to let them know their foresight's wrong
Where this rapper goin' with that obscure ice on?
He a lame, I'm just tryna get my mature life on
OD, OD, everybody know me
Even fans that resemble them kids in the O.C.
Oh me, oh my, them girls love me like Seth Cohen
So get a grip, get a glass, pour the X.O. in
I dare one of these niggas to say I'm not insane
Pick a road 'cause where you drivin' is not a lane
And rest in peace to Pimp C, life is not a game
Takin' over the world, no Pinky, just a lotta brain
He 'bout to send them the shit that I'm on
You prob'ly could have predicted I'm on
My sense of judgment's officially gone
Up into the air all the smoke from the Swisher is blown
I'm grown, I'm grown
I'm livin' in this elevator zone alone
I'm up so high I'm never comin' down
And you say you got them hoes, but they never comin' round
I got Penthouse walls, I stay high above your ass

Stop the violence – how, when every line
Is like the motherfuckin' Watts riots pourin' out of my pen?
Aight then, be easy, I'ma get back
Gentleman with a superlative use of syntax
And I done gave up the narcotics
But I can't leave the crib without some xanax in my wallet
Hello, my name is Travie, and I'm a life-aholic
Told 'em all these beats is like the Wallace to my Gromit
The Alfred to my Bruce Wayne, stripes on my candy cane
One without the other, Soul 4 Real without the Candy Rain
Super trooper like a gun-totin' handyman
Ask me how I'm livin', bet I tell ya fine and dandy, man
Check his vital signs, they peakin' off the meter, man
I'ma live forever in Neverland with Peter Pan
Fuck pullin' the 9 out, I'll pull a Amy Winehouse

I got I got my veins cluttered with this bud
And this name of it is Fame and it's all up in my blood
Tryna suppress the too fresh feeling I got, ooh yes
I'm in it for the hugest duplex, livin' like I'm Hugh Hef
Every other night I need a brunette for group sex
Leave 'em with a bruised neck, then I yell: ""Who's next?""
Stand 'em in a line
This is New Factz City, take this crack between your thighs
(Yeah, Mickey, what you mean?)
I'm promethazine, fuck the Queen
Sniff the white horse of success and then let him lean
(Let 'em see…) Tryna match my high on life
(Then let 'em dream…) Gotta catch the spot on my flight
First-class, known of the aroma of the smoker life
Got me like a stoner, a zoner, but nah, it's never over
(Mickey, what you mean?) I stick my tongue out
Sippin' Remy conceited, I'm teasin' every bum out
Hung out with celebrities from every drug house
So when you remember me say that I was strung out
(Mickey, what you mean?) I'm a addict for the green cash
I'ma OD, so fluck goin' to rehab
[Hook: Drake]
And I'm so prestigious
I brought my niggas from the hood to the beaches
I'm livin' good, grippin' wood with all the features
Jesus, my money straight, no creases, p-p-peep this
We got bottles over here
Kush is in the air, we good (OD, OD)
Bitches over there, we good (OD, OD)
Money on the floor, we good
OD, OD, everybody know me"
Bohemian Rhapsody,Queen,"['rock', 'blues']","[Intro]
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
[Outro]
(Ooh)
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows"

What’s Your Fantasy,Ludacris & Shawnna,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Ludacris & Shawnna]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now

[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawnna]
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, ""Ahh ahh,"" you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, ""Ahh ahh,"" you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I wanna get you in the Georgia Dome on the 50-yard line
While the Dirty Birds kick for t'ree
And if you like in the club, we can do it
In the DJ booth or in the back of the V.I.P
Whipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top, lick it don't stop
Keep the door locked, don't knock while the boat rock
We go-bots and robots, so they got to wait til the show stop
Or how about on the beach with black sand?
Lick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man
Table top or just give me a lap dance
The Rock to the Park to the Point to the Flatlands
That man named Ludacris (woo!) in the public bathroom
Or in back of the classroom
How ever you want it, lover-lover gonna tap that ass soon
See I cast 'em and I passed 'em
Get a tight grip and I grasp 'em
I flash 'em and outlast 'em
And if ain't good then I trash 'em
While you stash 'em, I'll let 'em free
And they tell me what they fantasy
Like up on the roof, roof
Tell your boyfriend not to be mad at me!
[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawnna]
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'

And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, ""Ahh ahh,"" you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
I wanna get you in the bath tub
With the candles lit; you give it up 'til they go out
Or we can do it on stage at the Ludacris concert
'Cause you know it got sold out!
A red carpet dick it just roll out
Go ahead and scream, you can't hold out
We can do it in the pouring rain
Running the train, when it's hot or when it's cold out
How about in the library on top of books?
But you can't be too loud!
You wanna make a brother beg for it
Give me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud
We can do it in the White House
Try to make them turn the lights out
Champagne with my campaign
Let me do the damn thing
What's my name, what's my name, what's my name?
A sauna, jacuzzi, in the back row at the movie
You can scratch my back and rule me
You can push me and just pull me
On hay in middle of the barn
Rose petals on the silk sheets
Eating fresh fruits, sweep your woman right off her feet
[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawnna]
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'

Then I wanna, ""Ahh ahh,"" you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I wanna get you in the back seat, windows up
That's the way you like to fuck
Clogged up, fog alert
Rip the pants and rip the shirt
Rough sex: make it hurt
In the garden all in the dirt
Roll around Georgia Brown: that's the way that I like it, twerk
Legs jerk, overworked
Underpaid, but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
Maybe your girl and my friend can trade
Tag team, off the ropes!
On the ocean or in the boat!
Factories or one hundred spokes!
What about up in the candy store?
That chocolate, chocolate make it melt
Whips and chains, handcuffs
Smack a little booty up with my belt
Scream ""help!"" Play my game!
Dracula, man, I'll get my fangs
Horseback and I'll get my reins
School teacher, let me get my brains
[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawnna]
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, ""Ahh ahh,"" you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'

From New Jerse to the curb, make absurd figures
Stop lyin', picture me poutin'; dog, could you fish in a fountain?

Word, on everything, on everything, you still in spinners
Know what I feel in the winter? 80 degrees, deal with a winner
I know some rowdy rowdy niggas that rock a Audi proudly
One thing 'bout me: doubt me, bounty Saudi shout me

[Interlude - Beth Melillo]
Did you know that a 3 year old has the physical strength to shoot a gun?
Juvenile gun possession is a problem
If a child obtains an improperly stored gun
The adult owner is criminally liable (killa!)
The restrictions are endless

[Verse 2]
Yo, sell you crack for a dub, it's a package of love (it's all love)
The car's far, I'm at the bar, got my gat in the club (poppin' Sizzurp)
And my ratchet is snub (snub), just for you actin' a thug
You will get smacked with some bub, I got my mask and my glove
Yup, we wildin' again, the cops you dialin' again (what)
Guns matchin' my jeans (what's that?) I'm just stylin' my friend
I better get squashed (why?)
When that telly is ready, I medley a deadly, a sauce
That'll petty a steady already get heavy and hard
And I got them mami's screamin', ""Dammit, man!""
Really, ""Dammit, Cam!"", hand in hand to a Phantom tan (God Damn)
Pam pam man, no man or land could jam with me (nope)
Damn fam a jamboree, posse gangs and family (where we at)
In front of the corner store under the canopy
Chick wanna stand with me, she gotta drink a can of pee (here, drink this)
That's a pineapple soda (what's this) this a pineapple Rover (what happened?)
Don't sit on the hood, time after time I done told ya"

Babe, you know it gets no better than this
It's like, sunshine on a rainy day
It's like a high, could you take me away?
Take me away, away
It's a beautiful bliss, oh (When you feel like this)
Beautiful bliss, oh (When you spill out hits)
Beautiful bliss, oh, oh, oh (When you fly as a bitch)
And you ride with this, and you ain't bothered a bit now, baby

[Verse 1: Wale]
Fresh out the airport, fresh out the chair with the clippers
Like Shaun Living', thinking, hmm
I'm tryna get it like Sean get it
If Lord giveth, a mil' and a MILF light skinneded
It's slight blemishes and life system
But I'm giving it foundation when I write lyric
That Anvil Neidhart minus bright knickers
Maybe not quite the star but my heart's in it
When Bret Hart meet Brett Farve
A sharpshooter well exceeding any figure four
You see my figure more or less six or more
I invest in my larynx and lungs and this voice I project
My project is like what pros inject
And a nigga so fly I should be droved in jets
It's ironic they call me a fresh breath
No joke, you see them boys sign me to the scope, right?
[Chorus: Melonie Fiona & Wale]
Babe, you know it gets no better than this
It's like, sunshine on a rainy day
It's like a high, could you take me away?
Take me away, away

Beautiful bliss, oh (When you spill out hits)
Beautiful bliss, oh, oh, oh (When you fly as a bitch)
And you ride with this, and you ain't bothered a bit now, baby

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I phone home to the real they wanna know just how it feel
Who woulda thought a lil nigga from the Ville could get a deal?
Ay, tell them niggas at the top we want yo spot we are for real
And yeah, we heard you got it locked but like them socks, we on your heels
So you best be on your toes nigga, especially on your flows nigga
Cause man they keep on checking for me, especially all your hoes nigga
Catch me on your doorstep, you see me, let me in
All I wanna do is eat, I'm like a freaky lesbian
Now all I wanna do is ball on TV, need ESPN
They heard I'm 'bout to blow so all my enemies say let's be friends
And all these rappers know just where I'm 'bout to go so catch me then
Where all the girls we knew that screamed fuck you going let me then
I'm definitely in a class of my own, at dinner with Hov
Hoping that he pass the baton, he just passed the Patron
Ain't nothing given dawg, it's earned if you just living, dog, you learn
I let you niggas see the light, I'm like the prison yard, I yearn
For that living large, but mama I ain't done yet
Sit back and watch your sunrise, kick back and know your son set
Forever I ain't run yet, and I never will, Nas told me life's a bitch
Pac said fuck the world and I ain't come yet, you up yet
My punchlines like gut checks I'm raw-dog, I'm rough sex
I'm on deck, I'm up next, I'm God blessed, I'm success
So fuck stress, you can get the fuck from 'round me
And if you listening, know you wondering where the fuck they found me
I'm from the Ville, boy, ay Wale, good looking

And you ride with this, and you ain't bothered a bit now, baby

[Verse 3: Wale]
Another day up in my ES, wish it was an LS
But elastic is my wallet, fuck it
I don’t be stressed like relaxed, muscles
Your feedback ain't plusing, and you can keep it running
Ha, like a muffler, when we not in summer
They like A-list actors, they not no stunners
Too much practice now for me to malfunction
So any beat that function, I breathe on and puncture
Leave it like a female vagina punctu-
Waiting, showing you her beauty if she's naked
It's like the view of a painting or a lakehead
This just how beautiful my day is
Peep me how I'm raising up the capital from Nathan
Capital I'm raising like I'm through punctuating
Or shift keys or an I placement cause
Shifted keys gets your capital raised up
Motherfucker, hah!

I'm never faded though
Haters wanna see me broke, but me and the dough related, ho
It's like my only son, where I go, he come
Niggas dumb to be braggin' bout that stupid shit
Nah I don't stunt on niggas, I show'em how to do this shit
I'm somethin' like the light-skin version
Of the very same baby that The Virgin Mary raised
That's word to everything
Nigga life a scary game but I'm playin'
You sucka niggas lie in everything that ya sayin'
Shame on y'all, you tryna ball with the game on pause
A nigga pull the thing on y'all, y'all stain y'all draws
Fuck you niggas, but this ain't raw dog
I got protection, lethal weapons, and they aim on y'all
I'm like the man on mars; I'm high as hell
Watch me blow like I exhale, I excel in this rap shit
Cause y'all spittin' that wack shit
And every nigga suddenly be rappin' bout that trap shit
So while you niggas copy cat the cats that made classics
I just massacre the streets, I'm a master of the beats and the rhymes
I'm rappin' for the freaks and the dimes
And I shine like a mothafuckin' diamond
You shine like a mothafuckin' dime
That's word to my mom
I don't mind if you niggas hate
Just know you hatin' on that nigga, nigga get it straight
I'm spittin' hungry like ain't shit up on my dinner plate
The kind a flow that make a nigga hyper-ventilate (ugh)
See let me demonstrate
I grew up with nothin', it hurt me to see my mother poor
The only pops a nigga ever seen around was Huxtable
And so the muscle flow is something you can't get no muzzle for
Look how the buzz will grow
Ballin' 'til the buzzer blow
Man I'm hungry, does it show?
Ain't nothin' funny, fuck a joke
I'm gettin' money til my pockets need a tummy tuck
I hope you niggas woke now, impermanentely
Send you to hell, you meet the devil, sign a permanent lease
Word on the streets is I'm the prince nigga, check the splendor
And I can't wait to be the King, nigga: young simba
Word on the streets is I'm the Prince nigga, check the splendor

Does fame in this game have to change who you are?
Or could I be the same one who came from a far away life
Just to make it in this broadway lights
Now I'm shinin in the broad, day-light - go figure
A slow transition from a lil' broke nigga from the 'Ville
Got a deal, a real life saver
Dreams of being behind the wheel like, Jada
I chill now, cop a lil' ice later
Cole, you got a glow like a lil' Lightsaber
So, clap for him, then applaud Hov
He gave 'em the platform
Flow so sick thought he wrote the rap for him - no sir
The flow cold as a shoulder of a gold diggin hoes
When a broke nigga 'proaches
Told ya I'm focused man, I'll let you muh'fuckers soak it in
Clap for him

Dear Lord, what am I here for?
Is it the girls, or the money or is there more?
I know the world ’bout to come to an endin’
So, before it does, let me finish all my sinnin’
I see the devil grinning, as if he winning
This just the bottom of the 9th inning
I’m coming back like light-skin and
What a sad sight, lookin’ at my gas light
Damn, man, I just threw ten in
Look, 5 dollars won’t get you what it used to
And, look, love don’t mean what it used to
And everybody and they momma on YouTube
Is it just me or is this unusual?
Don’t wanna lose you, just wanna reach y’all
So let me slow down to the beat y’all
Put the remote down, move ya feet y’all
One time for the boys holdin’ heat y’all
Keep that tucked ‘fore somebody get hurt
See me, I’d rather cut let ya body give birth

Turn this up, clap ya hands like this was church

Never talk to those that sat on the benches

My homie, Santana—yeah, that's my ace
But you may know us as ""I Can't Feel My Face""
[Interlude]
Yeah
Weezy, bitch!
Don't give a fuck about you at all!
I'm paid
Been that way for a long time
Looks like I'ma die like that
'Cause if I ain't, I'ma just die
Haha

[Verse 2]
Yeah! See, they don't know where I came from
But they know where I'm goin'
And I'ma tell you just how the top feels when I'm on
In the game I'm no cheetah, I'm a tiger, I'm a cougar
I'm a panther, I'm a Bengal: Ochocinco
I'm illy, shirt softer than Gillie
In a pair of Gucci flops, feeling freer than Willie
When them niggas left I, it got a little bit chilly
But I just let it burn like the end of the Philly—Weezy!"
Touch the Sky,Kanye West,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus 1: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team: I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists, I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line: ""Dawg, in due time!""
Now he look at me, like, ""Damn, dawg! You where I am!""
A hip-hop legend
I think I died in that accident, ‘cause this must be Heaven
[Chorus: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
Now let's take them hi-ah-igh-igh-igh-ighhhh
(Top of the world, baby, top top of the world!)
A-la-la-la-lah-la-lahhhhh
(Top of the world, baby, on top of the world!)
Now let's take them hi-ah-igh-igh-igh-ighhhh
(Top of the world, baby, top top of the world!)
A-la-la-la-lah-la-lahhhhh
(Top of the world, baby, on top of the world!)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was havin' nervous breakdowns
Like ""Man, these niggas that much better than me?""
Baby, I'm goin' on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm tryin' to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song
[Chorus: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Yes, yes, yes, guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd
Here like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb
Peachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm layin' on the street
I'm tryna stop lyin' like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm layin' on the beat, en garde
Or touché, Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge
Come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are, like uh
[Chorus: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

We back at home, baby!
Sky high, I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!

Lights Please,J. Cole,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Yeah, I had this little bad thing, somethin' like them tens
She gave a nigga mad brain, somethin' like The Wiz
But, you see, the sad thing fuckin' with her is
Is the chick ain't even have brains, dummy like a bitch
So I tried to show her about the world
And about just who we really are
And where we've come and how we still have to go really far
Like, ""Baby, look at how we live broke on the boulevard""
But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra
Then all I really want is for her to go down low
Before you know it, she wet enough to get drowned slow
And all that deep shit I was previously down fo'
Replaced by freak shit I am currently down fo'
You see I peeped it, pussy is power
That proud feelin' we get knowin' that pussy is ours
And how it feels to feel that feelin'
You feelin' when you be drillin' that shit
Got her sayin' you be killin' that shit
And all the pain the world cause, she be healin' that shit
And naw, that ain't your girl, dog
But you be feelin' that chick
And you just wanna tell her everything she might need
But in the meantime it's lights, please
[Chorus]
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright

[Verse 2]
So now we in the hotel, mirrors on the ceilin'
She say she wanna blow L's, I hear her and I'm willin'
But every time I smoke, well, a nigga mind gone
So that every word I spoke, well, I'm tryna put her on
But she couldn't hear me
I told her all about how we been livin' a lie
And that they love to see us all go to prison or die
Like, ""Baby, look at how they show us on the TV screen""
But all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans
Then all I really want is for her to get on top
Before you know it, she workin', jerkin' it nonstop
And all that next shit I was previously talkin'
Is now that wet shit that I'm currently lost in
And while that sweat drip, I am reminded
All the times my brother told me that pussy is blindin'
I'm findin', the more I grow
The more y'all seem to stay the same
Don't even know the rules, but yet y'all tryna play the game
And ain't it shameful how niggas blame hoes for givin' birth
To a baby that took two to make?
Coward nigga, you a fake
How you gonna look in your son's face and turn your back
Then go start another family?
Dawg, what type of shit is that?
She said it's okay, rub my head and told me to relax
Laid a nigga down proper, like she was recordin' tracks
Said ""I know you wanna change the world
But for the night, please
Just reach over and hit the lights please""
[Chorus]
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright
Lights please, ah-ah-ah
Lights please, ah-ah-ah
Lights please, ah-ah-ah
Lights please, turn off the lights
Lights, please

Alright, if y'all niggas heard the first one, The Come Up and shit, then you would have heard part 1 of this joint right here. It's ""Dead Presidents"", you know classic nigga, that's classic Jay shit. So I did it, threw it on the first mixtape, this is about a year ago. We let niggas hear like you know the mixtape whatever, and there was always this one nigga that stuck out to me like a year ago. This nigga's like ""yo"". like I thought I did my thing on this shit, that was like two of my favorite verses that I did, but he was just like ""Yo"", like, ""Yo you didn't come right man. If you gon' come on Dead Presidents son, you gotta come, hard son, you gotta come harder than that son, you gotta come harder than that."" I was like, man what you mean I came hard? But, that shit always stuck in my mind, so doing this next, you know, doing this The Warm Up I was like, damn, I gotta get on it again, I gotta do it again. Just almost like, just to prove to that nigga and kinda prove to myself that you I can, I can maybe get a little..."

You dig?
Let me slow down
It’s so Inkredible

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave, you dealing with some rich niggas
We the lost symbols, speak in cryptic codes
Ancient wisdom valuable like gifts of gold
I embark on life, my path is all math
I understand the codes these hackers can’t crack
I understand that folks expect me to fold
Community control to violate parole (No)
I won't fail, but a lot of men will
I’m iconic in the field like Solomon's Seal (Woo)
Ugh, it’s just the intro
Allow my flow time to sink into the tempo
Free Mason (What), freelancer (Yeah)
Free agents (Me), we faster (Ha)
Big contracts, big contractors
Built pyramids, period, we masters
No caterpillars, it was just a lot of niggas
A lot of great thinkers and a lot of great inventors
All-white mansion, I’m the child of God
All-black diamonds, times were hard (Woo)
New Rolls Royce, guess you made it, nigga (Ha)
All-white neighborhood, you they favorite nigga (Nigga)
My top back like JFK
They wanna push my top back like JFK (Ayy)
So— So I ""JFK""
Join forces with the kings and we ate all day (Oh)
Right now, I could rewrite history (Woo)
I stopped writing, so fuck it, I’ll do it mentally

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Niggas couldn’t do nothing with me, they put the devil on me
I'd have preferred niggas to squeeze the metal on me
Rumors of Lucifer, I don’t know who to trust
Whole world want my demise—turn the music up
Hear me clearly: If y’all niggas fear me, just say y'all fear me
Fuck all these fairytales
Go to Hell, this is God engineering
This is a Hail Mary pass, y’all interfering
He without sin shall cast the first stone
So y'all look in the mirror, double-check your appearance
Bitch, I said I was amazing
Not that I'm a Mason
It’s amazing that I made it through the maze that I was in
Lord forgive me, I never would've made it without sin
Holy water, my face in the basin
Diamonds in my Rosary shows He forgave him
Bitch, I'm red-hot
I'm on my third six, but a devil I'm not
My Jesus-piece flooded
But thou shall not covet—keep your eyes off my cupboard
I'm a bad motherfucker, it's Hov, just say you love it

I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga

If I ever die
Never let it be said I didn’t win
Never, never say
Never say, ""Legend didn’t go in"" (I'ma go in)
I just wanna die on top of the world
Making love to my favorite girl
I'm making beautiful music, we making a movie
We knew we was born to do it

Wished I had told ooh was (the) only one (uh oh)
But it's too late
It's too late
He's gone

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You sweat her, and I ain't talkin 'bout a Coogi
You a big L, and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
(Brother Numpsay!) Groupies say I'm too choosy
Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies
Say she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays, I still have it my way, gone!

[Hook 1: Kanye West and Cam'ron]
Gone
We striving home
Gone
I ride on chrome
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Y'all don't want no prob' from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern, and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn
Caught something on the Usher tour, he had to let it burn
Plus, he already got three chil'r'n
Arguin' over babysitters like, ""Bitch, it's your turn""
""Damn, Ye, it'd be stupid to diss you
Even your superficial raps is super-official""
R-R-R-Roc Pastelle with Gucci on
With TVs in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap, now he at the top with Doobie Long
'Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on, gone

Killa Cam, hustler, grinder, guerilla troop
Oh my chinchilla blue, blue, you ever dealt with a dealer
Well here's the deal, ma we going to the dealer, woo
No concealing, no ceiling I don't need a roof
Act up, get out, I don't need you, poof!
Poof, be gone, damn, tough luck, dag (Dag)
Niggas still doing puff-puff-pass (Puff, pass)
Pull the truck up fast and I tell 'em
Hey, back in a touched-up Jag, shit
Y'all niggas wanna get in Cam's cerebellum
An old man just gon' tell 'em too late
Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm gone
My last girl want me back then I'm on
Fine, stay, you got the grind, hey
Came back, read what the sign say (Too late, he's gone)
Yes, I know you wanna see my demise
Yeah, you church, boy, acting like a thief in disguise
Ain't even my size, see the greed in my eyes
Ask Abby, I hustle, brought weed to the Chi, chyeah
And that ain't even a lie, please believe me
Gave Weezie a piece of the pie and
You can ask George or Regina
The whole West Side I explore with the Bimmer now

We striving home
I ride on chrome
Listen, homeboy, move on
That's your best bet, why's that, Cons'?

[Verse 4: Consequence]
I been pouring out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And trying to help his Momma with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got afoul on what could've gone wrong
Now they asking ""Cons, how long has this gone on?""
And maybe all this money might have gone to my head
'Cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the Feds
So I had gone to the dread, but he had gone up to bed
And when I came the next morning he was gone with my bread
And with that being said I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But looking back now, I should've gone to the crib
And rented Gone With the Wind, 'cause I'da gone in by ten
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talking shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is telling me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for twenty years doing time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, 'cause I'm gone

[Verse 5: Kanye West]
I'm ahead of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind
In the 1-9-9-9
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me ""Benz or Rover?""
Man, if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteen-year-old?
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play your role
My dog worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural
Fired a week later, the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirro'
How we out in Europe, spending Euros
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'ma open up a store for aspiring MCs
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything including the mannequin
They got a new bitch, now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm
Shorties at the door 'cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
They said, ""Sorry, Mr. West is gone"""

W-w-waves on swim so they hate on him
Anyway, I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree

Just left Money Gram in the lemon Lamb'
Hot damn, make me scream like Summer Jam
I mean that nigga must be from the motherland
Anyway, I think I met him in the sky
When I was a Geisha, he was a Samurai
Somehow, I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly

Yo, I'm hot like 95 Fahrenheit
On a summer night, tight spot where bodies rot
Rats drink from water drops, in the streets, niggas
Little kids scared cops, with red dots
Philosophical gangsta, with violent priors
Going back like black and white TVs with pliers
Leaning on broke down cars with flat tires
Flash iron on anybody trying on the blocks I'm supplying on
Madicon, my peeps, tie ballons up
And swallow 'em, and the P now got goons, lots of 'em
Cops see them and run, don't want no drama
Certain parts of the streets, the beast don't want a part of
Martyr, hood haunted like the Dakota
Where John Lennon was shot up, but he sang for peace
He begged for freedom, hanged with wild Jamicians
From Kingston, who drink Irish Moss
Listening to Peter Winston, Machintosh
Lightning hits the top of the church steeple
When I'm writing, semi-automatic, no hyphen
It's frightening
[Hook x4]
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move with

[Verse 2]
I take summers off 'cause I love winter beef
Started '87, with the shotty in the sheep
Three-quarter length, beige, dressed to kill
Bust a shell at the ground, pellets hit the crowd
Nobody like a snitch, everybody shut they mouth
Woolrich, Carhart, gun powder stains
Smelling like trees, sensimille on the brain
Scheming on your girls, bamboos on your chain
Got ill up on the train
Twisting off a cap of a English in my vein
Might've pushed you on the tracks
Deaf crack fiends who can't speak, scream noises
Cause she bought a jum of soap from one of my boys
It's just another day in the hood
And I'm with some wild brothers, up to no good
We saw the movies, like Tony Montana, and 'em
But our style was let them pile, then we robbin 'em
Money dudes, make 'em come up out they shoes
Run they jewels, word is bond, where my man Nino going
And I had to make a song, speaking on my old life
For the thieves who come out at night

What's the deal it's 1995
And a nigga wanna live the type of life that people dream
I want things, a crib, a car, while living the life of a king
I know I take for granted at times for what I got
Still hustlin' and bustlin'
And now and then I stand a pop or two to come up
A steady battle through the days
Mamma think I'm wrong because I wanna get paid
The system ain't given T-mo a chance
22 on the loose and black
Trying to get the noose a little slack around my neck

Service to what, who
Damn, you got caught sought away out
The trait is getting full, calling up your pull
But pull ain't got it
I fell cold inside like
A man sleeping on pavement
Under the bridge of I-20 west
And stress on the face of the man
Cussing out the atmosphere with nobody close enough to hear
And who dat miss they fee
Cuz all they personal shit
Is sitting on the front lawn of Apple Tree
And for those who ain't got take
Before the owner shows back up with the U-haul
Police you call
But wasn't no marshall there to watch your stuff
See I stand tall to this world
Like a kid walking rapping his rhymes to himself
A book on a shelf of many

Style free with Cool Breeze
Til it's thick like dat fog
Stacking away my extra for a engine for tha hog
Dropping a point from the East
From a location out tha trees

Victims rarely get a chance to think twice
[Cee-Lo]
As he laid in the final resting place
He had such a peaceful expression in his face
My visions blurry from crying
But it ain't hard to see that
At any time it coulda been me
It's about 90 degrees outside
But yet it felt like I'm froze
The ceremonies come to a close
I toss a rose but just can't seem to walk away yet
Damn I done fucked around and got upset
But it ain't nothing we can do
It's bigger than me and you
One day our time coming too
So ain't no use in being sad
Leaving here was probably the best gift he ever had
We should be glad
Maybe his life was something
That he had to give to show me
That I need to be responsible about how I live
I won't complain about my pain
But I just ain't gone let my niggas die in vain
So Bean I'm gone make it for you
The cycle that these young black men keep goin through
I'm gone break it for you
And start takin care of me
And me consist of all my friends and my family
From now on, until I'm gone
Born into these crooked ways
I never even ask to come so now
I'm living in the days
I struggle and fight to stay alive
Hoping that one day I'd earn the chance to die
Pallbearer to this one, pallbearer to that one
Can't seem to get a grip cause, my palms is sweatin' ..."

Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

[Chorus 1]
Yes, I did
So I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little something, show you how we live
Everybody want it but it ain't that serious
Mhm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this

[Refrain]
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

[Verse 1]
You don't see just how wild the crowd is
You don't see just how fly my style is
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know, I just want it better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But every time I wanted layaway or a deposit
My dad'd say ""when you see clothes, close your eyelids""
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son
In the movie, I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
'Cause every summer he'd get some
Brand new harebrained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd send me back to school with a new wardrobe, but ayy

Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

When it feel like living's harder than dyin'
For me givin' up's way harder than tryin'
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion
I wish her heart still was in rhymin'
'Cause who the kids gon' listen to, huh?
I guess me if it isn't you
Last week I paid a visit to the institute
They got the dropout keepin' kids in the school
I guess I cleaned up my act like Prince'd do
If not for the pleasure, least for the principle
They got the CD, they got to see me
Drop gems like I dropped out of PE
They used to feel invisible
Now they know they invincible

That you were a champion in their eyes?

This is the story of a champion
Runners on their mark and they pop their guns
Stand up, stand up, here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one

Young Forever,JAY-Z,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Mr. Hudson]
Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson (Jay-Z)]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever? (Uh)
Forever young (young)
I wanna be (Aye, may the best of your todays)
Forever young (Be the worst of your tomorrows)
Do you really want to live forever (But we ain't even thinkin' that far)
Forever (ya know what I mean?)
Forever young

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
So we living life like a video (video)
Where the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold and the music's always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today, 'cause there's no tomorrow
Just a picture perfect day that last a whole lifetime
And it never ends cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark they can't erase, neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut, I'll be fine
I'm forever young
[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young (forever young)
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Fear not when, fear not why, fear not much while we're alive
Life is for living, not living uptight, 'till you're somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye's
Are not for legends, I'm forever young, my name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over Pyrex pots
My name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barbershops
Young slung, hung here, showed that a nigga from here
With a little ambition, just what we can become here (yeah)
And as the father pass the story down to his son's ears
Young'll get younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby, this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young
[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Just let it run..
Slamming Bentley doors, hopping outta Porsches
Popping up on Forbes' list, gorgeous (hold up)
Niggas thought I lost it, they be talking bullshit
I be talking more shit, they nauseous (hold up)
I'll be here forever, you know I'm on my fall shit
And I ain't with foreclosure, I will never forfeit
Less than four bars, Guru bring the chorus in
Did you get the picture yet?
I'm painting you a portrait of Young

Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young"

Yeah, hahahaha
Whoo, shit
Mmm
Oh, oh, mmm
Ehh, ehh
Aight, guess what? I ain't comin' in yet
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh
I'll come in a minute
Ayo, this is my love song, it goes like this
Hey, yeah

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark (Fuckin' faggot!)
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix Hen with Bacardi Dark
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
And my prediction is you're gon' probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And everything's spinnin', you're beginnin' to think women
Are swimmin' in pink linen again in the sink, then in
A couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart-eyein' you
Get in your car, start it, and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a 42-car pile-up
Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking for life on this planet, sir, no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me outta this place, I'm outta place
I'm in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so
[Hook: Eminem & Dina Rae]
‘Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)
‘Cause every time I try to tell 'em ""no"" (No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
In third grade, all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubik's Cube
Seventeen years later I'm as rude as Jude
Schemin' on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I've got no game, and every face looks the same
They've got no name, so I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want
However, I do show some respect to few
This ecstasy's got me standin' next to you
Gettin' sentimental as fuck, spillin' guts to you
We just met, but I think I'm in love with you
But you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like, ""Yo, what the fuck we'd do?""
I gotta go, bitch, you know I got stuff to do
‘Cause if I get caught cheatin', then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run, these drugs are probably
Gonna catch up sooner or later, but fuck it, I'm on one
So let's enjoy, let the X destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more
'Til we walk around lookin' like some wind-up dolls
Shit's stickin' out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now, I'm gonna try to find some more

They won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend?
Screw it! And what's a little bit of alcohol poisonin'?
And what's a little fight? Tomorrow, you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Marijuana is everywhere, where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin'
‘Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'
They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignorin'
Even though you wake up feelin' like shit every mornin'
But you're young, you've got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded
And graduated to better drugs and updated
But I still got a lotta growing up to do
I still got a whole lotta throwing up to spew
But when it's all said and done, I'll be forty
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch tellin' stories
With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids in my lap
Babysittin' for Hailie while Hailie's out gettin' smashed
[Hook: Eminem & Dina Rae]
‘Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)

Aw, man, yeah
You ever be in the club, man
You get in a fight
And people that you don't even know jump in?

[Verse 1]
You feel like you wanna hit somethin', your fist clenches, you're pissed
You just wanna get someone with shit, jump on this
You're 'bout to get your shit pushed in, I'm just inches away
From splittin' your shit wide open, no stitches can save
You'll die with your eyes open, you hope this isn't the way
You end up going out, but I guess it just is, I'm afraid
Razors, scissors and blades make Jason say, ""Isn't this great?""
On-lookers participate in this ass-kicking debate
That's startin' to take place in the middle of the street
Little did you know there'd be an all-out brawl soon as you heard this beat
Emergency personnel rush to the murder scene
But it's too late, it's absolute pandemonium, whisked away
In an ambulance is your fate, nothing nobody told you
When you left the house today could've made you anticipate
Such an ass-whipping, okay, 'til the anger dissipates
You'll get punched in the face, reciprocate, come on! (Woo!)
[Chorus]
So what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
I said, so what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

[Verse 2]
You step in the place with enough misplaced anger to catch a case
Anxious to get in some shit, got your gangstas all with your ladies
You better go get your mace 'cause Shady said so
You may wanna pick up the radio and bang it against your face
That's how fuckin' rowdy you feel, now do you still wanna grill?
If you don't wanna get the shit beat out of you, chill
'Cause if you doubt me, you will, yeah, got me a pill, found me a thrill
I got a couple of drinks here, and I'm bound to refill (Woo)
Girl, howdy, how do you feel, ma?
This cocksucker did not spill my drink, oh, hell nah
He must be trying to kill my buzz
I will not budge, so what the deal, ridaz?
Now here they all come and they got your back in, like, two seconds flat
And that's probably a record, yeah, you wasn't expecting that
'Cause they want in on the act, there's a Cognac bottle
We snuck it in 'cause the beer that they was serving here was only tap
I'm bitin', I fight dirty, you might get kicked in the nuts
You're frightened like, ""This guy might hurt me""
You're quite certain he's nuts, I've hit myself in the face harder
Play smarter, you may start her over, you need a chainsaw to
Dig your way out or go powder your nose, pussy
The louder you yell, the harder I slap the shit outta you hoes
You set it off, faggot, so now how do you 'spose
We settle it? Hit me in the nose, we'll see how it goes
[Chorus]
So what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
I said, so what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

[Verse 3]
It's sheer hustle, I bob, weave, deflate your beer muscles
We're tusslin', the crowd's startin' to cheer us, and
Adrenaline's rushin' through us just like a geyser gushin'
Too much Budweiser in my blood, I'm stranglin' your windpipe for nothin' (Woo!)
My signature's ligature marks, look at you all
Big with your remarks 'til I swing an icepick at your heart
At least that's what it feels like when I pick ya apart
And dig at ya, and break you down like the bitch that you are
The predicament starts when I throw a brick at your car
The pain inflicted upon you is so sick, it's bizarre
Shit, this is almost ridiculous, addictive as far
As havin' me wanna rip out your fricking ligaments— arr!
You hit like a bitch, you scratch me with your nails for that
You catch an open hand slap like a female like bap
In fact, I'll have the crowd smackin' you themselves
Where's D12? I don't feel like doing this by myself, come on!

So, what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
I said, so what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

Yeah, what the deal?
I'm feeling hard as hell right now, homie
I almost feel
Invincible and shit

Flow stronger, the clip longer, will air niggas
Lay 'em down flat, I stay around straps
We don't lounge or frown, we bounce back
From the wicked streets of Philly, all we do is gain stacks
Face facts - I been done it since ""1-900""
I been sickening since Hot 9-7
I been stunting since black man man had the black Lexus 400
Then I done it 450 -- had the Lexus to Land

So you need to fall back and concentrate on your music, bastard

'fore I plug you bitches shows, get your shows shot up
You are not killing nothing, you are no shotta

And I'm achieving, y'all leaking, y'all goals on hold, holla

Things just ain't the same for gangsters
I'm back without a track from Kanye, it's all good
The dash on the 760 is all wood
I got the heat in the stash, I use the nine lethal
We different people, and when egos collide
The pride coincide and it bring on the evil, look
Fact is, he too busy, I'm too gutter
I was fucking with him when niggas was like, ""Who is he?""
But like the Scriptures say, quickly they forget
Quickly let me reminisce
If a nigga ever try me, we'll see who could spit
Any rapper, anybody, I'll body the list
Y'all smoking bullshit, I'm smoking firey piff
Since the age of thirteen, I acquired the gift to spit
And I'm coming, when that Philly Freezer running with it
Non-stop gunning when they making them hits, holla"

I'm never around, you constantly seek it
You'll never be down, I know where your peak is
9 1/2 weeks is better than 12-steps

And your soul is in control, trying to lead it from me
And your heart no longer pledge allegiance to me
Damn, I'm missing the days when you needed the D!

Dont Ever Fucking Question That,Atmosphere,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Slug]
Enough to hold you to the brightest of lights
To place you dangerously close to that sun
Enough to acknowledge the flaws you can't ignore
And recognize the cause of what's done is done
More than enough to put my name behind my ideals
And neglect my logic twice daily
Enough to keep me looking for my Lucy in the sky with gems
When I remember how you used to call me baby
Enough to look in my mirror with detest
For every tear you shed regardless of why you wept
Enough to curse any man who can't appreciate the depth
Of the ocean I swam till I ran out of breath

[Hook]
I love you, don't ever fucking question that
That's why we'll probably never get along
If I was better at finding the right words to say
I wouldn't need to write these motherfucking songs

I love you, I love you (faded)
Never, don't ever fucking question that
Don't ever fucking question that
[Verse 2: Slug]
Riding the public transit, I study the blank stares
To answer my questions of how and why I got so many grey hairs
I take care of the nervous that runs through my extension cord
And I reflect on that reoccurring dream where we met the Lord
Single file lines, to give her a pound one at a time
But when I faced her, I attempted to embrace her, she looked so fine
I awokened from my sleep before her bodyguard had a chance to beat me
To submission and I still walk with my religion
I watched the children scurry in circles around a two-way mirror
Worrying about which side of the glass projects the reflection clearer
I hear the whispers of the wind trying to get me to grin
Gassing me up about the love that I plucked and I've been stuck within
For every eclipse that stares at me
From the other side of a paper cup of espresso
I light a match beneath a kettle
And for ever set of lips that become attached and equipped with that program
To seek success, I bleed my ethics out a slow drip
I know a man who met a woman, don't remember where
Big beautiful eyes and light brown hair
She was from the 'burbs, he was from the south side of the city
This was back when Franklin Avenue was still pretty
Two different worlds apart, but the world is just a small town
We all know how people like to get down
Here we go, Aquarius, Pisces
Feel the flow of the fluid as I swim through it to free my soul
Push shoved to came, without the glove, numbed the pain
The magic from up above what it does for the brain
Make the love, paint the picture, write the song
The player met a virgin, made a Virgo, named him Sean
Make the love, paint the picture, write the song
The player met a virgin, made a Virgo, named him Sean
Make the love, paint the picture, and write that song
Till the break of dawn

[Hook]
I love you, don't ever fucking question that
That's why we'll probably never get along
If I was better at finding the right words to say
I wouldn't need to write these motherfucking songs"

Hello?
Aw shit, nigga! The fuck time is it, man?
Oh, God damn
Nigga, do you know what time it is?
Aw shit, what the fuck's goin' on?
You aight?
Ah, nigga, what the fuck is wrong with you?

[Verse: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell
'Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell (What you talkin' 'bout, man?)
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven with the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Timbs and black hoodies (Aw, man)
God'll probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin' my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies, loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice (You talkin' some crazy shit now, nigga)
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse (Ah)
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wish she got a fuckin' abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger (Yo, get a hold of yourself, nigga)
Suckin' on her chest just to stop my fuckin' hunger
I wonder; if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies (You're buggin', B)
My baby mother's eight months, her little sister's two
Who's to blame for both of them? (Nah, nigga, not you)
I swear to God I want to just slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit (Nigga, what the fuck?)
And squeeze until the bed's completely red (It's too late for this shit, man)
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddha head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't— I can't believe (Ayo, I'm on my way over there, man)
Suicide's on my fuckin' mind, I wanna leave
I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
But nah, you wouldn't understand
Nigga, talk to me please, man!
You see, it's kinda like the crack did to Pookie in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back (Ayo, ayo, man, I'm out)
Should I die on the train track like Ramo in Beat Street? (I'ma call you when I get in the car)
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me (Ayo, where your girl at, man?)
My baby mama kiss me, but she glad I'm gone (Yo, put your girl on the phone, nigga!)
She know me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I reach my peak, I can't speak (Ayo, you listenin' to me, motherfucker?)
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak (Ayo, c'mon, nigga)
I'm sick of niggas lyin' (Cut that), I'm sick of bitches hawkin' (Ayo)
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin' (Nigga, yo, yo, Big! Ayo, chill!)

[Verse 1]
I wear my scars like the rings on a pimp
I live life like the captain of a sinking ship
The one thing that I can guarantee
I'm like a stepping razor, I suggest you stay fair with me
Been paying dues for a decade plus
Before that I was just another face on the bus
Tappin' my foot, to the beat on the radio
Dreaming 'bout the mic and the money and the ladies
Oh mom, I promise I'm gonna be large
Some day I'ma stop trying to borrow your car
Gonna go far, with charisma and skill
Until they put my face on a million dollar bill
Atmosphere, it's just a ten letter word
Discretion is the name of my cement-feathered bird
And if you didn't hear, then fuck what others heard
I think you got the sickness, I suggest you get it cured
Caught up in the mix of a bottle full of fix
I'mma hobble down the street till I reach Knob Creek
It's not that I don't like you, I just don't want to speak
You fucking freak, now keep your days out my week
The world keeps a balance, through mathematics
Defined by whatever you've added and subtracted
I'm pushin' on the hammer to trigger the brain
Embrace how I live, 'cause God loves ugly
[Chorus]
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly

[Verse 2]
Once upon a time in Minneapolis, yo
I damn near had to steal the show
I stepped on the stage - ""Who is it?""
My name's Slug, I've come to kill a couple minutes
And what's up with the way that everybody gathers around
Each other, so they can steal each others' sound
If it's all about getting down, with the get down
How long I gotta wait for these fools to sit down?
Appears more clear in its simplest form
Nobody sees tears when you're standin' in the storm
Abandonin' the norm, and handlin' the harvest
Measurin' the worth by the depth of the hardship
I welcome all the hatred you can aim at my name
I held onto the sacred ways of how to play the game
When the soldiers started runnin' short on rations
I began tappin' the egg to spark the hatchin'
Make it happen, and take this captain to the gallows
I keep steering us into an area that's shallow
Talking to my shadow, he advised me not to worry
Said, I should plant my tree and let it rise out of the fury
So give me some light, a little love and some liquid
I'ma creep through the night and put a plug in the spigot
And when the water grows, and the dam starts to overflow
I'll float atop the flood holdin' on to my ugly
[Chorus]
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly

[Verse 3]
Why scream, when you can lose yourself inside the widescreen
Let life be a bowl of melted ice cream
Or be the deer that's caught in my high beams
I'm rolling with the brights on
Scared stiff, reality is just too much to bear with
Paranoid, walking around, careless
No wonder you're in love with your therapist
Go to sleep my little time bomb

[Chorus]
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly

And she still wonders why I'm so insecure
She giggles because I sleep with a-
Could I throw my panties on stage?
Like, can I be a fuckin' groupie and just fuck you cause
You're on stage and other girls want to fuck you?
See bands like us don't get groupies
Nawww
Yeaaahh
You're so full of shit, I'm sure you guys have-
No, it's not full of shit, I mean, have you ever heard our songs?
I mean, basically, exactly, that's what I'm sayin'

[Refrain]
Smile, smile with me, smile with me, smile with me
Please won't you smile, smile with me, smile with me
Smile with me, please won't you

[Verse]
Oh look at her, she's lookin' as good as dinner
And she's lookin' back at me as if maybe I'm a winner
I'm in my late twenties little girl don't flirt with me
I've got the capabilities to program your circuitry
You don't have to believe, do yourself a little justice
Don't let Slug undercook your muffins
Oh wait, did I say that, I did, must be losing it
Cause it almost felt that it might just have some truth in it
Now back to the platter at hand
She said she's twenty-one and quit school to go work for the man
A switch up in the plan, now she's happy as a chorus
'Cause now she makes rent and now she drives a Taurus
Unwindin' and hangin' out at the bar
I wonder if she knows that I'm not really a star
She seems to be impressed with my lack of an ego and
My self-aware style, I like the way that she smiles
She wanna know how I find the words I use
I don't really know but I can lie if you want me to
Angels sing to me in my sleep
I sold my damaged soul for the magic of speak
Now she's laughin', she likes the sarcasm
Naturally, I'm askin' if she's got a captain
A captain, you mean a man at home, the answer is no
I came to this bar alone
Well heavens to Betsy, enough about boyfriends already
Just tryin' to keep the conversation heady
As much as I would love to run and play in the forest
Ain't no way this girl is gonna break into my fortress
I've never made a practice, of introducing the mattress
To women that I meet at my own gig
I don't know, can't imagine anything as small as
Alcohol and hormones turnin' out to be anything big
Baby's hella beautiful, even kinda bright
I've got the fire of a vampire inside me tonight
It might be alright, everything seems tight
I've got a good buzz and she's givin' me the green light
So tell me girl, what you doin' after
She says hopefully hangin' out with my new favorite rapper
Now wait a minute, that's not fair, you're throwin' 'boulders
I can tell by the way your hair touches your shoulders
Be straight with me and I'll be me with you
I can think of some of us that we should do
So if you think I'm comin' home with you tonight
You're probably right, probably right
A few more beers, a couple more laughs
Undressing my past with the questions she asked
Yes, I love cats and I would love to take a bath
If I would spend the night, would you massage my back
She's closin' in for the embrace
And slightly tucks her head under my face
Her hair smells so good, I gotta have a taste
Where's your Ford, let's ditch this place
In the parking lot, she sparked it off
She must be starving for someone to hit the heart
I've never been kissed with such passionate bliss
Pornstar damn near tore my lips apart
Honey, slow it up, hold it up, start the car and
Leave this garage, let's go to your apartment
Lyndale Avenue, on the way to her rest
Her drunk-ass turns to look at me and she says
You're so beautiful from the hair to the soul
I can't believe that I've never met you before
It feels like I've been waiting for you my whole life
She missed the red light, hit a pickup truck and we both died"

Picture me rollin' in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggas, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance
I swear somebody be tellin'
Know there's dope bein' sold, but I ain't the one sellin'
Don't want to be another number
I gotta puff a gang of weed to keep from goin' under
The federales wanna see me dead
Niggas put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottweilers by my bed, I feed 'em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live?
Will God forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
When niggas shootin' at your crib
Mama, I'm still thuggin', the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just schemin' on ways
To put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin'
Flossin' a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beatin'
And my hands are swollen

I got keys comin' from overseas
Cost a nigga 200 G's
I'm a street commando, Nino for example
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
So I got to floss 'cause I'm more like a boss player
Thug, branded to be a women-layer
So many player haters, imitators steady swangin'
Make me wanna start back bangin'
So I'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
Packin' 40 Glocks, contain 'em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy comin' from my enemies
While I'm sippin' on Rémy
In front of black Lexus, Chevy's on the roam
'96 big body, sittin' on chrome
As we head up out the zone, stone-facin' is on
You can admire, but don't look too long
I'm livin' a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin'
It's hard to imagine, picture me rollin'

And, uh, diggin' the plots (so what?)

[Verse 1]
I once knew a nigga whose real name was William
His primary concern was makin' a million
Bein' the illest hustler that the world ever seen
He used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams
A corrupted young mind at the age of 13
Nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend
She put the pipe down, but for every year she was sober
Her son's heart simultaneously grew colder
He started hangin' out, sellin' bags in the projects
Checkin' the young chicks, lookin' for hit-and-run prospects
He was fascinated by material objects
But he understood money never bought respect
He built a reputation, 'cause he could hustle and steal
But got locked once and didn't hesitate to squeal
So criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real
You see, me and niggas like this have never been equal
I don't project my insecurities on other people
He fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles
So he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil
A feeble-minded young man with infinite potential
The product of a ghetto-bred capitalistic mental
Coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed
Dancin' with the Devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed
But he was sick of sellin' trees and gave in to his greed
[Hook]
Everyone tryin' to be trife never face the consequences
You probably only did a month for minor offenses
Ask a nigga doin' life if he had another chance
But then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance
Dance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block
But that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock
Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot

[Verse 2]
So Billy started robbin' niggas, anything he could do
To get his respect back in the eyes of his crew
Startin' fights over little shit up on the block
Stepped up to sellin' mothers and brothers the crack rock
Workin' overtime for makin' money for the crack spot
Hit the jackpot, and wanted to move up to cocaine
Fulfillin' the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain
Tired of the block niggas treatin' him the same
He wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs
But when he tried to step to 'em, niggas showed him no love
They told him any motherfuckin' coward can sell drugs
Any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs
Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a Blood
Even Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in the club
But only a real thug can stab someone 'til they die
Standin' in front of them, starin' straight into their eyes
Billy realized that these men were well-guarded
And they wanted to test him before business started
Suggested rapin' a bitch to prove he was cold-hearted
So now he had a choice between goin' back to his life
Or makin' money with made men up in the cyph'
His dreams about cars and ice made him agree
A hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be
And so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three
[Hook]
Everyone tryin' to be trife never face the consequences
You probably only did a month for minor offenses
Ask a nigga doin' life if he had another chance
But then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance
Dance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block
But that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock
Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot

[Verse 3]
They drove around the projects slow while it was rainin'
Smokin' blunts, drinkin' and jokin' for entertainment
Until they saw a woman on the street, walkin' alone
Three in the mornin', comin' back from work, on her way home
And so they quietly got out the car and followed her
Walkin' through the projects, the darkness swallowed her
They wrapped her shirt around her head
And knocked her onto the floor
""This is it, kid, now you got your chance to be raw""
So Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair
And dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there
She struggled hard, but they forced her to go up the stairs
They got to the roof and then held her down on the ground
Screamin', ""Shut the fuck up, and stop movin' around!""
The shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed
So Billy stomped on the bitch until he'd broken her jaw
The dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doin'
They kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped movin'
Blood leakin' through the cloth, she cried silently
And then they all proceeded to rape her violently
Billy was made to go first, but each of them took a turn
Rippin' her up and chokin' her until her throat burned
Her broken jaw mumbled for God, but they weren't concerned
When they were done and she was lyin'
Bloody, broken and bruised
One of them niggas pulled out a brand new .22
They told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through
And if he killed her, he was guaranteed a spot in the crew
He thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead
And so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head
[Sample]
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back

[Verse 4]
Right before he pulled the trigger and ended her life
He thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice
And he felt strong standin' along with his new brothers
Cocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover
But what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter
'Cause he was starin' into the eyes of his own mother
She looked back at him and cried 'cause he had forsaken her
She cried more painfully than when they were rapin' her
His whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate
His corruption had successfully changed his fate
And he remembered how his mom used to come home late
Workin' hard for nothin', because now what was he worth?
He turned away from the woman that had once given him birth
And cryin' out to the sky, 'cause he was lonely and scared
But only the Devil responded, 'cause God wasn't there
And right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold
And so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul
They say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it
After that, they killed his mother, and never spoke about it
And listen, 'cause the story that I'm tellin' is true
'Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs, and I raped his mom too
And now the Devil follows me everywhere that I go
In fact, I'm sure he's standin' among one of you at my shows
And every street cypher, listenin' to little thugs flow
He could be standin' right next to you, and you wouldn't know
The Devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked
White, brown, yellow and black — color is not restricted
You have a self-destructive destiny when you're inflicted
And you'll be one of God's children that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot
So when the Devil wants to dance with you, you better say never
Because a dance with the Devil might last you forever

[Intro: Immortal Technique]
Oh, y'all motherfuckers thought it was over, huh?
Well, it’s not, you didn’t count on a fallen angel gettin' back
Into the grace of God and comin' after you
Y’all niggas ain’t shit, your producers ain’t shit
Your fuckin' A & R ain’t shit
I’ll fuckin' wipe my ass with your demo deal
Yo, Diabolic, take this motherfucker’s head off!

[Verse 1: Diabolic]
Go ‘head and grip Glocks
I’ll snap your trigger finger in six spots
You’ll have to lip lock with hypodermic needles to lick shots
I’ll watch you topple flat
Put away your rings and holla back
Can’t freestyle; you’re screwed off the top, like bottle caps
Beneath the surface
I’m overheatin' your receiving circuits
By unleashin' deeper verses than priests speak in churches
What you preach is worthless
Your worship defeat the purpose
Like President Bush takin' bullets for the secret service
Beyond what y'all fathom, I shit on cats and jaw tap 'em
Show no compassion, like havin' a straight-faced orgasm
Tour jack 'em, have his half-a-10 bitch suck my friend’s dick
In the meantime, you can french kiss this clenched fist
Diabolic: a one-man brigade spreadin' cancer plague
Fist-fuckin’ a pussy’s face, holdin' a hand grenade
So if I catch you bluffin', faggot, you’re less than nothin'
I just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reduction

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
You motherfuckers are nothin', you cannot harm me
I’ll resurrect every aborted baby and start an army
Storm the planet, huntin' you down, 'cause I’m on a mission
To split your body into a billion one-celled organisms
Immortal Technique’ll destroy your religion, you stupid bitch
You’re faker than blue-eyed crackers nailed to a crucifix
I’m 'bout to blow up, like NASA Challenger computer chips
Arsenic language transmitted revolutionarily
I’m like time itself: I’m gonna kill you inevitably
Chemically bomb you, fuck usin’ a chrome piece
I’m Illmatic, you won’t make it home, like Jerome’s niece
I’ll sever your head diagonally for thinkin' of dissin' me
And then use your dead body to write my name in calligraphy
This puppet democracy brain-washed your psychology
So you’re nothin', like diversity without equality
And your crew is full of more faggots than Greek mythology
Usin' numerology to count the people I sent to Heaven
Produces more digits than 22 divided by seven
You’re like Kevin Spacey: your style is usually suspect
You never killed a cop, you, not a motherfuckin' thug yet
Your mind is empty and spacious
Like the part of the brain that appreciates culture in a racist
Face it, you’re too basic, you’re never gonna make it
Like children walkin' through Antarctica, butt-naked"

Hello, hi you

Feed you to Piru

Fuck your man
You ain't a pimp unless you get the same bitch
To fuck your man
And fuck your clan
And all my bitches know that's my plan
Oh god damn

Suck my dick with red lipstick and don't let it smear
And I got a lot of tattoos, and I meant every tear

I got money on my beeper, dead trees on my phone
They call me Mick Jagger 'cause I roll a lot of stones
It's a whole lot of clones but only one Sweet Jones
Turning whores to carnivores, they just can't leave my meat alone
It's been a long time since I hustled on the block
But every corner that I hit, I left it screwed up and chopped
Marooned up and dropped, like my Biarritz on top
Let the motherfucker bleed until it drip the last drop
I'm still that young boy that had a pocket full of stones
But now, it's nicks for sixty bricks, gripping wood and flipping chrome

And we don't bar no 'plexes, we way bigger than other men though

Whichever way the wind blow, that's the corner we bend, Joe
Don't know where you been, bro, but it's no quiz to me, you win though

No disrespect to Islam nor Imam or Pastor
No answers to questions the media's askin'
Why we fight each other in public in front of these arrogant fascists?
They love it; puttin' old niggas verse the youngest
Most of our elders failed us, how could they judge us? Niggas
There's verbal books published by niggas, produced by niggas
Genuine niggas, so I salute my niggas
Not mad 'cause Eminem said, ""Nigga,"" 'cause he my nigga
Wigga, cracker, friend - we all black within, okay?
We all African, okay
Some Africans don't like us no way!

Slain artist named Lucky Dube, hijacked
Some say N-double-A-C-P, keep us sidetracked

Not the man you go to war against, patience, I'll get you
If that means I can't sleep a whole year, I'ma get you
I'm official not ""A-Tisket"" or ""A-Tasket""

They smoke hibiscus, they plants or trees, advanc-ed weed
Don't forsake us, you all are fake bloods like move make-up

We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks
Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man
Fuck a yard, God, let me see a hundred grand
Could use a gun, son, but fuck being the wanted man
But if I hit rock bottom, then I'ma be the Son of Sam
Then call the crew to get live too, with Swoop
Bokeem, my brother Jungle, Big Bo cooks up the blow
Mike'll chop it; Mayo, you count the profit
My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it
It's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs
'Nuff respect to the projects, I'm ghost, one love

[Chorus]
Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent

[Outro]
One time for your mothafuckin' mind
This goes out to everybody in New York
That's living the real fucking life in every projects, all over
To my man Big Will, he's still here
The 40 side of Vernon, my man Big L.E.S
Big Cee-Lo from the Don, Shawn Penn, the 40 busters
My crew the shorty busters, the 41st side of Vernon posse
The Goodfellas, my man Cormega, Lakey the Kid
Can't forget Draws, the Hillbillies
My man Slate, Wallethead, Black Jay, Big Oogie
Crazy barrio spot, (Big Dove), we rock shit a lot, PHD
And my man Preemo from Gang Starr

P.I.M.P G-Unit Remix,50 Cent,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar outta me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Now shorty, she in the club, she dancing for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana
She's feeding fools fantasies, they pay her cause they want her
I spit a little G man and my game got her
A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear saying they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar, trying to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country; think she like me cause I'm from New York?
I ain't that nigga trying to holla cause I want some head
I'm that nigga trying to holla cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch: hit the track, catch a date, and come pay the kid
Look baby, this is simple, you can't see?
You fuckin' with me you fuckin' with a P-I-M-P
[Chorus: 50 Cent]

Yeah, I'm young, but I ain't dumb
Got some tricks, but I ain't one

I let 'em do as they please, as long as they get my cheese
Even if they gotta freeze, or if it's a hundred degrees
I keep 'em on they knees, take a look under my sleeve
I ain't gotta give 'em much, they're happy with Mickey D's, PIMP

[Verse 4: Young Buck]
We keep it pimpin' in the South, you know how it go (dirty dirty!)
We drive old-school, white walls with mink floors
I spin the G-Unit piece, and get em' dizzy
Handcuff her if you love her or your girl coming with me
When your neck and wrist glow, she already should know
That money make the world go round, so lets get mo'
It's time to show these playas how it should be done
You got pimp potential, you might/could be one, G-UNIT!

In Hollywood, they say ""there's no business like show business
In the hood, they say, ""there's no business like ho business""

Choppin' holes in all the walls, that's all they saw, hey!
[Verse 5: The Game]
Hip-hop ain't dead, it just took a couple shots

The king comin', no, I'm not Jay-Z
Too many niggas hate me, but they scared to face me
This ain't a movie, dawg (Nope!) not Waist Deep

Bangin' underwater, fuck around and soak ya
Louisiana gunner, I'm 'bout my holster
And if you gettin' greasy, I'm an ulcer

Of New Orleans where the Bloods at the B-hive
Ain't nothin' sweet unless it's Presidential
'Cause that is where I sleep, now give me my key

[Verse 8: N.O.R.E.]
New York, get the blood money (Dirty cash!), still sweet
We the Black Wall Street by the swap meet with heat
Def Jam, they gon' flop him
And Reggaeton ain't hot in the building no more
It's OKAY! I get it poppin'
Back to the forest trees for deep, these little mes
Who took believers a opportunity to breathe
And you ain't gotta go overseas to see Iraq shit
You can come to LeFrak, Queens and get jacked quick

[Verse 9: Jadakiss & Styles P]
One blood, we used to the spillin'
Came from the hood so we used to the killin'
Used to the black males makin' crack sales in the building
How else you get the Benz with the suede on the ceiling?
Blood in, Blood out, me and homie back-to-back
Boatload of work and we about to pitch a shut out
I'm New York's king, I'm New York's hardest nigga
Anything in between's a motherfuckin' target, nigga
D-B-L-O-C-K, he spray
The hawk'll find a nice home right where your cheeks stay
We got a mean team, hip-hop's dream team
Them boys is only in the projects on green screen
Yeah, no security, I'll put you on the respirator
I'm the bomb; I'm the motherfuckin' detonator
One dutch, one bud, one burner, one slug
Want a couple casualties, but we'll settle for just...
(One blood!)

Shooters waitin' on the word, ""Just say it, Los!""
I let these niggas live (Yes!), I told 'em pull the plug
Have them goons pullin' gloves, leave the room full of slugs (Yes!)
Catch me traffickin' on maroon-colored dubs (Yes!)
Couple Africans with balloons full of drugs (Yes!)
If they like me, tell 'em line up
While I sit behind ten and point 'em out like a line-up

[Verse 11: Juelz Santana]
Mic check, one two, one two (Check!)
I'm strapped, you strapped, let's play two-on-two (Let's go!)
You're eyein' us in the iron bus (Boom!)
Leak you, two liters of red juice: Hawaiian Punch (Ha!)
So what you boys gon' do to me? (What?)
I'm born street, your life's sweet: MTV's Laguna Beach (Damn!)
Mama told me not to play with fire
But she never told me I would grow to be a lighter

One love to the gangs (Yeah!), but I'm in the things
Save the colors for the cars, see, we kill for the fame (Ross!)
The boss made it, yeah, we floss flagrant
Shame how I lost your life savings up in Las Vegas (Ross!)
I'm a heavy better, I'm a heavy seller (Tell 'em)
Keep white in the office, call it Jerry Heller
Lettin' off a hundred rounds (Rounds), let the barrel pick (Pick)
And we gon' sit here and wait for the Darryl case

Chi got Lords and Gangsters, show me where them niggas at
Chi got Two Sixes and Kings, show me where them killas at

He got the kush, I got the dope, let's get it poppin', nigga!
Hurt him in that cherry six-four, shit, ain't no stoppin', nigga

Glock holdin' on the hip, rollin' with two clips
Got two tiny locos ready to take trips
Shake and make trips, high stakes to take grips (Grip)
But they know what's crackin', cuz, 'cause as we huddle (Ayy!)
They hold cards down, nigga, like spades and pinochle (Nigga)
West Coast gangbang, riders erasin' 'em
Got funny niggas raisin' up and riders replacin' 'em, cuz

[Verse 15: Daz Dillinger]
Draped in blue, notorious gangsta crew
R.I.P. for niggas who don't stay true
Deep down in the crevices (Woo!), see, them checks better win
Dwellin' in the land of the gangbang profession
I'm legendary, yes, yes, a West Coaster
Throwin' up two Cs with two guns in my holster (Woo!)
I'm from Long Beach City, a Crip next to Compton
Down with my nigga, Game, if you niggas want problems
From the streets to the suites, anywhere, we can meet
Del Amo to Compton, Slauson Swap Meet
Worldwide (Wide), get swept away by the tide
YGs and BGs, OGs, it's time to ride!

[Verse 16: WC]
Who the riders shooting through the gutter lane?
Trued up in them Carolina blue Hurricanes (What up Blood?)
From the Westside, strivin' to dead 'em
Where them killers throw that third letter up
Like Raymond Washington and Tookie Williams
Blue jeans, blue strings, blowin' blueberry green
Cadillac on blue Ds and a blue tee
Money thick as blue cheese, chuckin' up the dub
What the West be without Snoop and Dub C and one blood?

[Verse 17: E-40]
The Bay Area, fuckers, we pop 'em
Open you up if you got a problem (Ahhhh!)
Up top, born in California
Clean your clock, open your can of tuna (Doot-doot-doot!)
Make a choice, it's either Hell or it's Heaven
Get your chest laid out with the FN-57 (Bo! Bo! Bo!)
This ain't nothin' to do with nobody
In the Yay, there ain't nothin' to do but catch bodies

I'm comin' straight up outta P-A-T like Compton in all black
But when we say ""What it do?"", they never say, ""Holla back!""
Bun Beeda, I'm OG, like '95 Air Max
Neon green outta Flight Club off of Fairfax
Ask the Hundreds, it's doable, I done done it
At the summit of rap, and I'm watchin' you haters plummet
Run to it or run from it, to Bun, it don't differ
Wipe the streets with ya like you a Swiffer as a gift
One blood

[Verse 19: Chamillionaire]
I'm the realest youngsta that's breathin'
And I don't gotta give a reason
Chamillionaire a millionaire, y'all competin' to be competin'
My purpose is to get the cheese
And that's a purpose that you're defeatin'
So shut your mouth, have a seat and be quiet 'til I'm finished eatin'
My label tells me I'm greedy, hoggin' all the room on your TV
Like Eric, they think it's Eazy but it isn't easy, believe me
Need to make a room in B.E.Television if you wanna be me
Game said he made room for Jeezy, I had to make room for me, G

[Verse 20: Slim Thug]
It's one blood if you Blood or Cuz
From that number one Thug, it's still one love
I rep my blue boy team, but I do it for green
I do it for my Folks, Vice Lords and Kings
All the trappers, future rappers, standin' out on the blocks
Tryna get up out the hood, man, and stack up a knot
Put your sets in the air, scream, ""Fuck the cops!"" (Word, fuck 'em)
We gon' rep for the hood, man, like it or not (Thugga!)

[Verse 21: Young Dro]
My feed mashable, murders are catastrophical (Okay)
Cars is improbable, I'm overcomin' obstacles (Okay)
Trappin', I made it logical (Okay), my topic is impossible (Okay)
I got a partner named Shoe Strang 'cause shorty real crossable
Shark meat to Pappadeaux, cars be tropical (Yeah, yeah)
All guns choppable, all blocks are mobbable (Yeah, okay!)
I'm unstoppable, my Calico is toxable
Lyrically diabolical, kushin' is now cigarable (What it is!)

[Verse 22: Malice & Pusha T]
Redrum, redrum, such power in the tongue
Never in the wildest, wasn't talkin' to them
Style on niggas but feel it to the numb
Japanese thread, brought flavor to these bums
Consider me the savior, look what the Lord gave ya
My celebrated presence like the return of Rayful
Frolic in the snow so playful
And revivin' the track like we flowin' through jumper cables
What duo you know
Get XXL kudos while coppin' off Julio?
Yeah, classic shit, we mastered this
Left for dead, I'm back, I'm Lazarus

[Chorus: The Game]
Remix, remix, remix
Remix, remix, remix
Remix, remix, remix
Remix, remix, remix (Remix!)

[Verse 23: Ja Rule]
Nigga, one Crip, one Blood, L.A., New York
The Game, the Rule, one love, guns up
Hands down, can't touch the flow, it's a bit much
The style, wanna keep up? I'd advise you to speed up
With money movin' like coke these days gotta re-up
G up, cop some heaters and dare a nigga to act up
You see us in dual-seaters and throw it up
It's all hood, niggas, rep your sets if you Cuz or (Blood!)
Niggas, we all bleed!
These niggas can't breathe!
Only because the guns are drawn and aimed to part
Niggas that got bullets with names on them
Want 'em? Come get 'em! Niggas, y'all know where to get at me
Look at me, now pass me, maybe you can be half me
You bastards, I'm laughin', bullets stickin' in family
Who sadly gets torn between one Crip and one (Blood!)

[Outro: Ja Rule]
Y'all niggas know me, haha, yeah!"
Mafia Music,Rick Ross,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse]
Yeah, I got a feelin' nigga, really that my money be the root
Look up at the stars, she like, ""Honey, where the roof?""
Pull up, hear the dogs, Canaries, they gon' woof
Even once had a job pourin' tar up on a roof
That boy had it hard, no facade, it's the truth
So now when I menage and get massaged it's the proof
Proof's in the pudding and that baking soda cakin'
Paper that I'm makin' got her takin' photos naked
Listenin' to niggas like whistlin' at Wendy Williams
I flip my middle finger, I'm chillin' on twenty million
The rumors turn me on, I'm masturbatin' at the top
These hoes so excited, so they catchin' every drop
I'm dodgin' debacles like potholes in Jamaica
We cut down the weed, bury the paper on the 'maicas
Martin had a dream, Bob got high
I still do both but somehow I got by
Creflo prayed, Mike Vick paid
Bobby Brown straight, Whitney lost weight
Kimbo Slice on the pad when I write
That Mayweather money lookin' funny in the light
But who really cares? We just throw it in the air
Celebratin' wealth, pourin' Moet in her hair
Excuse me, her weave, the bluest of weed
Trunk full of white, car smell like blue cheese
That boy get salad, beef bowel movements
BMWs on them big thangs lookin' foolish
Shawty sitting low, big thangs popping
Tip on the Glock from a Crip up in Compton
Shootin' at the cops, fuck one-time
I gave her to the block, I fucked one time
We Boyz N the Hood, and nigga, you lil' Tre
Suppress ya appetite, we takin' ya lil' tray
Love my handgun, but my choppa still the shit
Banned in 1994, but I'm ""2 Legit 2 Quit""
1996, kilos was the shit
But that was better than roofin', that shit be bad fo' ya skin
Niggas was ruthless, Lord knows that I sin
But I thought about my future and the loops I could pin
Walked out on the gig and I turned to the streets
Kept my name low-key, I ain't heard from in weeks
I came up wit a strategy to come up mathematically
I did it for the city but now everybody mad at me
Motherfuck 'em all, they sweat from my balls
If I drop another album, I did that for my dawgs
Ten Maybachs everybody ridin' big
I just sit back like, ""Look what I did""
Then I bow my head and beg for forgiveness
Once I said my prayer, everybody back to business
Smokin' on a blunt in my own restaurant
People lookin' from a distance think I'm Big Daddy Conch
Reincarnated, spirit of a G
Beef I'll make you thinner, take a seat so we can eat
A Farrakhan aura, pause on the pork
You eat from the bowl, while your dog need a fork
Niggas ain't loyal, snakes slithered in they coil
I'm laughin' at you cuz, kill you niggas when I'm bored (yeah!)
We steppin' on you crew 'til them motherfuckers crush
And makin' sweet love to every women that ya lust
I love to pay ya bills, can't wait to pay ya rent
Curtis Jackson baby mama, I ain't askin' for a cent
Burn the house down nigga, you gotta buy another
Don't forget the gas can, jealous stupid motherfucker
To another chapter, paper that I captured
Caught up in the rapture off gunshots and laughter
Homicide is humor and nigga you lookin' funny
Women love to stare cause they know they see the money
I open up her mind by openin' bank accounts
Deposit a hundred stacks, break-up, won't take it out
Baby that's a gift, maybe you could live
I knew it wouldn't work but, I just like to give
Used to run the street, young nigga bare feet
Now I'm in the suites and I'm eatin' crab meats
Ice so right, other rappers envy
They callin' all my jewelers up, askin what he spendin' (whaaat?)
Thinkin' 'bout Boss, not thinkin' 'bout them
This a letter to my enemies, one I won't send
Amen"

This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Not!)

I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)

[Verse 1]
This is why I'm hot: I don't gotta rap
I could sell a mill sayin' nothin' on the track
I represent New York, I got it on my back
Niggas say that we lost it so I'ma bring it back
I love the Dirty Dirty 'cause niggas show me love
The ladies start to bounce as soon as I hit the club
But in the Midwest, they love to take it slow
So when I hit the H, I watch 'em get it on the flo'
And if you need it hyphy, I take it to the Bay
'Frisco to Sac-Town, they do it erryday
Compton to Hollywood, soon as I hit L.A
I'm in the low-low, I do it the Cali way (woo!)
And when I hit the Chi, people say that I'm fly
They love the way I dress, they like my attire
They love how I move crowds from side-to-side
They ask me how I do it and simply I reply
[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)

I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)

[Verse 2]
This is why I'm hot, catch me on the block
Every other day, another bitch, another drop
Sixteen bars, twenty-four a pop
Forty-four a song, nigga, gimme what you got
I'm into drivin' cars, fresh up off the lot
I'm into shuttin' stores down just so I could shop
If you need a bird, I could get it chopped
Tell me whachu need, you know I get 'em by the flock
I call my homie Black, meet me on the Ave
I hit Wash Heights wit' the money in the bag
We into big spendin', see, my pimpin' never drag
Find me with different women that you niggas never had
For those who say they know me, know I'm focused on my cream
Player, you come between, you better focus on the beam
I keep it so mean, the way you seen me lean
And when I say I'm hot, my nigga, this is what I mean
[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)

I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)

[Verse 3]
This is why I'm hot, shorty see the drop
Asked me what I paid and I say ""Yeah, I paid a guap""
And then I hit the switch that take away the top
So chicks around the way, they call me Cream of the Crop
They hop in the car, I tell 'em ""All aboard""
We hit the studio, they say they like how I record
I gave 'em Black Train and I Did You Wrong
So every time I see them, man, they tell me that's they song
They say I'm the bomb, they love the way the charm
Hangin' from the neck and compliments the arm
Which compliments the ear, then comes the gear (Woo!)
So when I hit the room, the shorties stop and stare (Ha!)
Niggas start to hate, rearrange they face
But, little do they know, I keep them things by waist side
I reply ""Nobody got to die""
Similar to Lil Weez 'cause I got the fire

[Intro]
(Talking)
Uh, Hahaha, Uh
Only I can get away with something like this
Y'all know my name

[Verse 1]
I'm an uptown boy with Soho flava
The beat is D minor but I'm oh so major
I do my own thing so I owe no favors
Can't do it now then I won't do it later
Haters wanna see the boy get lost in the sauce
But it's gravy so boy get lost
Nah I ain't cocky I'm just stating the obvious
H-O the boss and I'm making his pockets rich
Hate it or not I am great and about to get greater
Hit the Peja like I play with Stojakovic
I keep it real and my ladies do the same
High class chicks that be crazy in the brain
Style so mean, swag is vicious
Smile O.D, ass delicious
Stay getting money no need for ebay
My heart is Harlem world, but I'm loving BK
[Hook]
I ain't got no problem wit girls out in Harlem but
(They ain't nothing like a Brooklyn girl)
See I had a dope fling wit a girl on Queens but
(They ain't nothing like a Brooklyn girl)
The Bronx is live that's where my mom resides but
(They ain't nothing like a Brooklyn girl)
(Damn sure ain't nothing like a Brooklyn girl)
(D-Damn sure ain't nothing like a Brooklyn girl)

[Verse 2]
My girl Angie can't be a groupie or whore
She bout getting money in her juicy couture
Do she get bored with the Gucci of course
So the Louis she sports til it ain't new anymore
Then she cop another one makin hoes gettin madder
Gettin more money so the price don't matter
Ain't seen her in a minute know her ass got fatter
And if you think she bad then her friends are way badder
Kendra's a Christian never seen freakin
In church every weekend she need to be deacon
Had a model bitch name Viva we ain't speakin
But I had her screamin whenever I was beatin
She been callin, creepin, crawlin
Maybe she would chill if I would beat it often
And Rhonesha's fly and she sweeter than Splenda
Cause no one ever slows her agenda
(Hook)

[Verse 3]
As we smoke da la la la
BK gettin money no 9-5
Mamase mamasa mamakusa
It don't make sense but admit it, it's kinda hot
BK girls down wit that ride or die
So I always keep one right by my side
See I love New York I ain't gotta lie
So if you messin wit my ladies it's homicide
I gotta friend named Shayna
She like Bill Bellamy and how to be a player
Shorty is a player can't nobody play her
Can't nobody game her cause she ain't a gamer
Baby girl ballin kinda like the Lakers
If you would trade her like Shaq then see ya later
Player she do it so easy it's kinda like a layup
She could lay up wit your boy wit no make up
Keep doin her and I'mma keep doin me
Even on the road I'mma keep 2 or 3
Bad BK chicks that speak fluently
In the Hamilton language girl speak to me please
I remember when I couldn't get a girl for shit
Now I can't get rid of any girl for shit
So when they look at me I don't look away
I spread love it's the Brooklyn way
Now let the hook play

Just Begun,Reflection Eternal,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Talib Kweli & The Singers Unlimited]
We've only just be—...
Oh, yes indeed
I like this, I like this
...-gun
Ayo, Hi-Tek
Do me a favor, man—speed it up a lil bit

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli & Jay Electronica]
From the intro, you know I'm so influential
'Cause I'm glowin' like a candle
The focus is so essential, dog, what you tryna get into?
I steady the flow, ready to blow like snotty tissue
They snitchin' like Donnie Brasco, I'm countin' like Monte Cristo
The ghetto full of betrayal like Iago and Othello
Your fellow neighbor will slay you, they'll smoke you like cigarillos
Police want that info, they'll grill 'em like Portobellos
I'm murderin' instrumentals
'Cause I rap with the conscience of villains, killers and monsters
So revealin' and honest
I'm still fulfillin' the promise
So nice, I kill 'em with kindness
Hittin' like Muhammad Ali, you more like Tatyana
All this is probably karma, you dishonored the father
Whether it's God Almighty, or the almighty dollar
We follow the prophets like Islamics or the Dalai Lama
Your bullet points so hollow they could prolly pierce body armor (Ugh)
Look in the scope, my people still a target (Ugh)
[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
Smile on my face, tears of a sad clown
Feelin' out of place as I whistle the cab down
""If I tip extra, can I huff a cig?""
Blow my smoke out the window, droppin' ashes on the bridge, ugh
I'm in New York now, like Akeem and Semmi was
Tryna get the lobby door open from a semi-buzz
I just wanna go to the slum
And throw my money on the floor like the Notorious BUM, ugh
Build a home, teach a class, start a revolution
Free the mind, heal the body, talkin' evolution
This that Black Elohim Anunnaki rap
That Farrakhan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Qaddafi rap
I dedicate this to my niggas in New Orleans
Rockin' black and gold stockin' caps, and fleur-de-lis Shockey hats
I'm in the courtroom screamin' ""Who Dat?!"" on the devil
Servin' gumbo with a shovel, dog, I'm on another level
Me and Kweli come together like two pieces of metal
We magnetizin' the ghetto

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Yeah, now, here's the memo:
I'm a rebel without a cause, a bezel without no flaws
And shawty, you straight, but you look way better without no drawers
Let's sweat out this alcohol (Yeah), bet I'm about to ball
And never let up, look how I just crept up without applause
Fed up with all the frauds and left y'all without a job
The center of attention, this is clever, I'm Pau Gasol
Really, though, I'm LeBron, really don't got my mind
On this new school of rappers, I will really go Columbine (Uh-huh)
And throw up the diamond sign (Uh-huh)
Boy, you know I'ma shine (Uh-huh)
Flow is in Ramadan (Uh-huh)
'Cause couple years ago, the game had they pajamas on (Yeah)
But now they on my dick, man, I should throw a condom on
Ayy, 'cause a nigga comin' raw like I ain't got one on
And I ain't stoppin' nor coppin' no pleas
I just lock-and-load, squeeze
Dog, I'm on a higher level, I'm on top of nosebleeds (Damn)
Niggas say they sick, but when they rock, they don't sneeze
Like the nigga on the block wavin' his Glock, but won't squeeze
Please... Hey
[Verse 4: Mos Def]
Look, hold your applause until the ceremony end
Yours truly, truly blessed, yet again a noble pla-anted
Supermagic, abracadabra kid
Mysterious master djinn, blacker pen
Arrowhead with the long-barrel stem, and his apparel fresh
Harbor lights shinin' out the black power grid
With the Black Power grip, and pure power don't power trip
Push the cellar ceiling up and make the tower tip
The Gladwell point and Babylon Palace
All about nothin', where it's all about the dollar
And mansions on the fault line of a shaky market
The Devil at the dance hall thirsty for a partner
Get off him, there is not a parcel or a portion
Or a measure of a fortune more awesome, gorgeous
The funky Four Horsemen and one more
With Hi-Tek on the score, once more, of course
You're welcome, thanks
Appreciation for your participation
Special dedication
Celebration, bitches!"
How Do U Want It,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: K-Ci & JoJo]
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it yeah?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad, I'm about to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby, just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit, you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me, but I can't comprehend the meanin'
Now, if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police, catch me if you can
Forgive me, I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame, I'm a simple man
Mr. International, player with the passport
Just like Aladdin, bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me; Champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a ho need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin', baby, I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy, nigga, now tell me how you want it

How do you want it?

Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk? Am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor, it's like erotic
Ironic, 'cause I'm somewhat psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches
Like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster
I'm up inside ya, I ain't quittin' 'til the show is over
'Cause I'm a rider, in and out just like a robbery
I'll probably be a freak and let you get on top of me
Get to rockin' these, nights full of Alizé
A livin' legend you ain't heard about
These niggas play these Cali days
C. Delores Tucker, you's a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga, you destroy a brother
Worse than the others; Bill Clinton, Mister Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game's told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Once I'm released, I'm makin' millions, nigga, top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' about us, I could give a fuck
Like we the first ones to bomb and cuss
Nigga, tell me how you want it

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Raised as a youth, tell the truth
I got the scoop on how to get a bulletproof
Lickin' shots off from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager
Game rules, I'm livin' major
My adversaries is lookin' worried
They paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin', fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me
But I'ma mash out and peel out
I’m with a clique that’s quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga, it's some new shit so better get up on it
When you see me, tell a nigga how you want it
How do you want it?

They used to talk, when I wasn't around
(Lasers)
You see me now
(We're not)
I'm beaming
(Losers)

[Verse 1]
I get my energy from my inner G
I be in outer space but I got inner peace
So tell my enemies that they can't injure me
I know that irritates, you have my sympathies
Well you should protest, yeah you should picket me
I'm on a losing strike, I'm on a winning streak
I'm out in left field, I'm speaking mentally
But that's a better place than where the benches be
I'm feeling really good, me and my different beat
Me and my different drummer; he play the timpanis
See that's what got me here, you hearing me
Me on my ""black man in the future"" shit, call me Billy Dee
See I'm just forward looking, that's how I really see
See while you Valentines, I'm thinking Christmas trees
And that's how this would be, even at Micky D's
Semi-colon, closed parentheses

They said my future was dark, see me now
Just look around, I'm beaming
They used to talk, when I wasn't around
You see me now, I'm beaming

[Verse 2]
Do you remember me, the guy from verse one
Failure's my last name, Never's my first one
You see I hood a lot, and yeah I nerd some
Hood's where the heart is, nerd's where the words from
Don't represent either because I merged them
It's kids who wanna leave, and I encourage them
Go out and see the world, never return from
Yeah you don't come back unless you learned some
And baby girl what does it matter where your purse from
Your hair done, your nails did, your ass fat, but you're dumb
Mix Melissa Ford with Maya Angelou
Become a top model and Sojourner too
I try to follow this, what Muhammad do
It's such an old soul, inside this sonic youth
It's why I'm Ferrari'd up, and I'm conscious too
I don't prophesize, I promise you

They said my future was dark, see me now
Just look around, I'm beaming
They used to talk, when I wasn't around

Yeah it's me again, the guy from verse two
Well this the last one, it's almost curfew
It's almost night out, so turn ya lights on
Where all my 760s with ya brights on
Yeah they are the ones to keep your eyes on
Like how we used to do to keep the house warm
Now those the type of eyes I not cry from
You see the tears of fire run out my crying songs
Now the world shoulders is what I'm crying on
The world's fast lane is what I'm driving on
What am I driving at, I'm trying to drive it home
I'm in the drivers seat, but you can ride along
It's never cyclops, it's never I alone
I'm telling your story wherever I perform
Now if they looking for me, you tell 'em I've gone
Out in the bright lights, right where I belong

They said my future was dark, see me now

Uhh.. yo
Whattup? Whattup?
It's time man (word, it's time?)
Straight up (it's time, man)
Aight, set that shit off (set it off then, nigga)
Set it off (set if off)

[Verse 1]
Broken glass in the hallway, bloodstained floors
Neighbors look at every bag you bring through your doors
Lock the top lock, momma should've cuffed me to the radiator
Why not? It might've saved me later from my block
N.Y. cops, hookers crawlin' off the stroll, coughin'
Stitches in they head, stinkin' and I dread thinkin' they be snitchin'
But who else, could it be, shook at these, unmarked vans
Parked in the dark—NARC's, where's your heart?
Hustlers starve—they bust a U-ey, I jog
To my building—come out later wearin' camouflage
See the sergeant and the captain—strangle men
Niggas gaspin' for air 'til they move no more and just stare
With dead eyes—tired of riots, shit is quiet
Simple-minded fools infiltrate grimy crews
Overcrowded cribs, uncles home from bids, sisters pregnant
Fathers on drugs, moms is smokin', beds is piss-infested
Had 8 partners growin' up, 8 turned to 7
7 turned to 6 niggas, got 2 in heaven
6 of us holdin' it, now it's 5 rollin' thick
The 6th one's parole flipped, 5 niggas went to 4 quick
When he went O.T., college life
Converted into gangbangin', 4 niggas still hangin'
Years passin' and slang changin'—3 of us now, 4th nigga ain't around
We all thought he was real—he did the snake shit
Fake shit—beat his ass down
Yo his mouth could've got us all wasted, what a fuckin' clown
All I got left in the end is 2 of my best friends
And we all goin' out to the death for these ends
What?
[Chorus (repeats in bridge)]
New York, New York (New York state of mind)
New York, New York (New York state of mind)

[Bridge]
You heard about it, you see about it
You read about it, it's in your papers
It's in your daily news (""Get money!"")
New York chronicles, every day
The crime rate, the murder rate
The money rate, the paper chase (aight?)
You know what I mean?
New York state of mind, baby (oh, yeah)
Check it out (yeah)

[Verse 2]
I'm at the gamblin' spot, my hands on a knot
New York Yankee cap cover my eyes, stand in one spot
I take a nigga dough, send him home to a shoebox
You lost that nigga I put your dollar in the jukebox
Hear my favorite song, all these niggas sing along
All the cigarette smoke's cloggin' my lungs
Hoodrats flashin' they tongue
Young thugs blastin' they gun, we got reputations
Bitches and niggas both on parole or probation
Shit is sick, niggas got gats, army fatigues
I got my eyes glued on whoever walk in or leave
'Cause I ain't playin', niggas'll run up in here and shoot up this shit
Stick yo' ass up, niggas'll find the loot in your kicks
Bunch of triple-cross niggas, just New York niggas
Lift you off your feet when they was just talkin' with you
Some of these dudes the Feds be on 'em, you knew 'em for years
Be the type when you walk in a pub, they offer you beers
That ain't gangsta, niggas is up North with tatted tears
Your name's on the affadavit, you ratted kid
Faggot-ass niggas that be scared to do they bids
Fuck you, we run you out of N.Y, you can't live
Got your quiet niggas, that relocated down South
Comin' back to floss, then you got the jealous loudmouths
All of a sudden we got Crips and Bloods, D.T.'s
Runnin' round quick to split your mug, it's easy
To score but it's hard to get the shit off
Niggas fightin' over hundred sales, jump in the car and drive off
When the fiend come around the block, happy as hell
Niggas mad 'cause they ain't get a piece of that sale
Cutthroat connivers, universal, ghetto survivors
Go to any hood that's live and make it liver
A lot of niggas schemin', some real, some niggas frontin'
But I'm a big dreamer, so watch me come up with somethin'

Put that knife in ya, take a little bit of life from ya
Am I frightenin' ya? Shall I continue?
I put the gun to ya, I let it sing you a song
I let it hum to ya, the other one sing along
Now it's a duet and you wet when you check out
The technique from the two TECs and I don't need two lips
To blow this like a trumpet, you dumb shit
This is a unusual musical, I conduct it
You lookin' at the Black Warren Buffett
So all critics can duck sick
I don't care if you C. Delores Tuck-it

For three years, they had me peein' out of a cup
Now they 'bout to free me up, what you think I'm gon' be, what?
Rehabilitated? Man, I still feel hatred
I'm young, Black and rich so they wanna strip me naked, but
You'll never have me like Christina Aguiler-y
But catch me down the Westside, drivin' like Halle Berry
Or the FDR, in the seat of my car
Screamin' out the sunroof, ""Death to y'all""
You can't kill me, I live forever through these bars
I put the wolves on ya, I put a price on your head

So, bye-bye to all you groupies and gold diggers
Is there a bumper on your ass? (No, nigga!)
I'm doing a hundred on the highway
So, if you do the speed limit, get the fuck out of my way!
I'm D.U.I., hardly ever caught sober
And you about to get ran the fuck over
[Chorus: Ludacris & Mystikal]
Move, bitch! Get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way
Move, bitch! Get out the way (Watch out, watch out)
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way (Watch out, bitch!)
Move, bitch! Get out the way (Watch out, watch out)
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way (Watch out, bitch!)
Move, bitch! Get out the way (Watch out, watch out)
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way (Watch out, chii! Roow!)

[Verse 2: Mystikal]
Here I come, here I go
Uh oh, don't jump bitch: move!
You see them headlights? You hear that fuckin' crowd?
Start that goddamn show, I'm comin' through
Hit the stage and knock the curtains down
I fuck the crowd up — that's what I do
Young and successful — a sex symbol
Now bitches want me to fuck 'em — true, true
Hold up, wait up, shorty
Oh what's up, getting my dick sucked, what are you doing?
Besides minding my fuckin' business
Trying to get my paper, child support suing
Give me that truck and take that rental back
Who bought these fucking TV's and the jewelry bitch, tell me that
No, I ain't bitter, I don't give a fuck
But I'ma tell you like this bitch
You better not walk in front of my tour bus
[Chorus: Ludacris & I-20]
Move, bitch! Get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way
Move, bitch! Get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way
Move, bitch! Get out the way (40!)
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way (Dia)
Move, bitch! Get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way

[Verse 3: I-20]
2-0, I'm on the right track
Beef, got the right mack
Hit the trunk, grab the pump, punk I'll be right back
We buying bars out, showing scars out
We heard there's hoes out, so we brought the cars out
Grab the pills 'cause we popping tonight
Beat the shit outta of security for stopping the fight
I got a fifth of the Remy, fuck the Belve and Cris
I'm selling shit up in the club like I work in that bitch
Fuck the dress codes, it's street clothes, we all street niggas
We on the dance floor, throwing bows, beating up niggas
I'm from the Dec', try to disrespect D.T.P.
And watch the bottles start flying from the V.I.P.
Fuck this rap shit, we clap bitch, two in ya body
Grab ya four, start a fight dog, ruin the party
So move bitch, get out the way ho
All you faggot motherfuckers make way for 2-0
[Chorus: Ludacris]
Move, bitch! Get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way
Move, bitch! Get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way
Move, bitch! Get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way
Move, bitch! Get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way

Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Hey, hey!

[Verse 1: Boots Riley]
Well if you thrust, eventually you gonna gush
And I'm implying I ain't had no business crying
'Cause we used the rubber twice
And we knew that shit was dying to bust
Well, we was only seventeen
But you was older in between
And in my fresh Adidas kicks
I used to come more clean than Jeru jerkin' off in a can of chlorine
Sophisticated with the game I was spittin' in
A nymphomaniac but which lacked discipline
Or experience, feet on my chest when I was put to the test
You said ""goddamn nigga, that ain't how ya get it in""
Dashboards for leverage, tall cans for beverage
The weed can make you courageous
Make a Honda Civic seem so spacious
Make five minutes seem like ages, anyway
[Chorus: Keneice]
You smell like Care-Free Curl and Nowalaters, baby
Said you like high-top fades
And Jesse Johnson's ""Crazay""
Seventeen, all on you like chicken and some gravy
Learned a lot, thank you much today I'm still campaigning

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Hey, hey!

[Verse 2: Boots Riley]
The lake don't smell so bad, now do it?
Don't trip off your hair, baby; just re-glue it
The windows is fogged up, can't nobody view it
Put down the O-E and turn up the Howard Hewett
In some months we had things to discuss
Like how we blew it, we got amniotic fluid
And a baby floatin' though it
Hey, imagine if it look like us
It was way up in the vaginary
And I'ma love my kids whether real or imaginary
Quit school, work for the parents at the mall next to FashionBerry
Operation cash and carry
Manual labor from six to noon
Making six doubloons, got a baby that's fixed to bloom
And he we fixin' to groom, plus grits the spoon
So let me twist the plume
We inhale and emit the fumes
[Chorus: Keneice]
You smell like Care-Free Curl and Nowalaters, baby
Said you like high-top fades
And Jesse Johnson's ""Crazay""
Seventeen, all on you like chicken and some gravy
Learned a lot, thank you much today I'm still campaigning

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Hey, hey!

[Verse 3: Boots Riley]
I was composed, I didn't even crack a frown
I was supposed to let my pants fall down
And show my ass when I found
Out the baby was four months early and around ten pounds
I heard a lot of bad things about teenage mothers
From those who don't really give a fuck about life
They say ""it ain't so much that they startin' out younger
It's just they supposed to be more like a wife""
Meaning you ain't shit without a man to guide you
If your mama tried to feed you that, she lied too
Fate can grab any motherfucker that ride through
If jobs are applied to, knots can get tied too
Plus I know that you must have been scared
It made it easy when the feelings were shared
Flashbacks are 20/20
I know you wasn't for the dollars 'cause you knew I had funny money
Yelling all loud like I'ma tear the whole hood up
You said leave 'cause the real daddy stood up
He said I was a mark for believing in you
Now it's more that I'm seeing is true
There's a few things I'd like to say in this letter
Like I wish I would've seen him grow
And ask my wife, I learned to fuck much better
And thank you for letting me go
Yeah, thank you for letting me go
For real, thank you for letting me go
[Chorus: Keneice]
You smell like Care-Free Curl and Nowalaters, baby
Said you like high-top fades
And Jesse Johnson's ""Crazay""

Poet Laureate II,Canibus,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: James Dickey sample]
Uh, I don’t understand how a writer would ever get writer’s block, so-called. My problem is having too much and being unable to get it down

[Verse: Canibus]
Yo, why is the Ripper so ill?
That would be an unpardonable breach of confidence for me to reveal
He said, ""One of these days, all eyes would be on me
When they look up in the sky and see the neon C""
Rhymes inscribed on a nickel disk encased
In glass with an ion beam for longevity
For more than ten centuries, impressions and memories
The first time-machine inventor will mention me
Canibus was a visionary indeed
He believed light could travel in multiples of c
The organic supercomputer that solved the mysteries of
Klein Kaluza with two blue metric rulers
Liked Cool J, but thought Stephen Jay Gould was cooler
And he never liked to propagate rumors
Smoked Canary Island cigars
Liked American luxury cars and beautiful Asian broads
He had a strong mind, he used to philosophize
About rhymes while he was pruning his bonsai
He claimed that he had written the greatest rhyme of all time
But he would never take it out his archives
He wrote two songs per day
And was constantly experimenting with his wordplay
In his youth he did a report on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
He got an F but he deserved an A
I followed his career from the first day
It seemed a lack of support contributed to his inert ways
I seen him pull in twenty-four hour workdays
With deferred pay, undeterred by the word ""shame""
Public humiliation was the worst pain
He was spinning out of control like a Class 5 hurricane
He said he wouldn't want another MC to suffer the same
Especially when there's nothing to gain
He was the illest alive but nobody would face it
He spit till his tongue was too torched to taste it
Privately funded corporations carbon dated his latest creations
To extract the information
They found it utterly amazing
They claimed the body of his work was the same thing as a priceless painting
Never mattered to him that art galleries hated him
'Cause Thomas Kinkade called and said he would take ten
Complete enigmas wrapped in puzzles encrypted in language
With sound but without shape or signature
Kept files in his garage on MS-DOS
In a fire-proof pod, we thought it was odd
Outside there was a shed with an Oppenheimer lock
He apparently kept more wax than Madame Tussaud's
We were in total awe 'cause it blew our minds
So many rhymes that were intricately designed
He was Poet Laureate of his time
And if you don't mind, I'd like to share some of his rhymes
Alone in my room looking through the 32X telescope zoom
Adjusting the focus of the moon
One should not assume the philosophy of David Hume
Is nothing more then a subjective conclusion
What is the maximum field rate application?
The runaway glaciation surrounding the ocean basin
Affects the population fluctuation
On a continuous basis but that's just the basics
The juxtaposition of Canibus' position
The precision of something no other has written
Way above and beyond what was intended
The unparalleled malleable enunciation of a sentence
You didn't go to college obviously
I can tell by your ungodly unintelligible terminology
A remarkable odyssey, the rhymes of modern speeds
When the brain orders the body not to breathe
Your competency is not up to speed, you're not in my league
You couldn't possibly be hotter then me
Or oppositely your minus twenty-five degrees
You'd squeeze but the condensation makes rifle barrels freeze
Allow me to speak figuratively, nigga please
My intellectual properties are about the size of Greece
Your counselor advised you not to speak
My counselor advised me to keep rhyming until they stopped the beat
In the words of Joseph Heller, ""I learned how to write better
Even though it sort of irked me""
He said he didn't understand the process of the imagination
But he felt he was at its mercy
Which explains my point perfectly and certainly reinforces
The reason why nobody's probably ever heard of me
Couldn't understand what I mean by ill
Unless you try to translate what I print to film
This is the line, the reel, the circle of time
The cycle of eternity, the emergence of one line
Academic phonetics render critics tongue-tied
And personifies dry humor of cum laude alumni
A wise man sees failure as progress
A fool divorces his knowledge and misses the logic
And loses his soul in the process
Obsessed with nonsense with a caricature that has no content
My style is masterful, multilateral
I could battle a fool and be naturally cruel
Words of scorn are a disastrous tool
From an existentialist's view I'm a better rapper than you
Grab the mic and rip your physical fabric in two
My attitude is fucked up but admirable
Different methods interpreted into different forms
From entirely different perceptions and seen from different norms
Not just spitting a poem, there’s much more involved
There's much more pieces of the puzzle for you to solve
Forty-eight orders of mechanical laws
And rays of creational cause enhance the cadence of my bars
Maybe I am self-absorbed
But that's the effect, to find the cause you should ask my A&R
Today is what it is, but only because yesterday was what it was
Permitting you heard of Beelzebub
A tale of demons and drugs, pissy drunk in the club
With the DJ doing the needle rub
Chances are you'll never see me son
Yeah I know my name's Canibus but I can't help you if you need a dub
I came to holla at some big booty bitches and listen to the speakers thump
Where you get conceited from?
I'm so nice on the mic they wanna beat me up
It's deep as fuck, I ain't seen it all but I've seen enough
Really unbelievable stuff
There's a lot of times when I want to speak but I'm stuck
I should leave this rap shit alone
And kick my incredible rhymes in the privacy of my own home
My imagination is my own
The liberty to speak to freely lyrically on the microphone
With a pen in my hand, I bring motion to the Enneagram
And become ""Can-I Millenium Man""
Engrave my back with the emperor's stamp
Been spitting scientific rap since the 17th century began
Trying to escape the wicked empire of Def Jam
And the land where lyrics are bland and heretics hang
Every warrior has an axe to bury
But he has to learn to discern between enemy and adversary
I said to myself, ""Germaine, this is insane
It's suicide, it's controlled flight into terrain""
I fought to regain control of the plane, but went up in a ball of flames
And got banned from the Hip-Hop hall of fame
For two bars I kept hearing in my head
Over and over again, it cost me everything
I'm convinced now that more than the truth is at stake
Where people create language that pretends to communicate
Euphemisms are misunderstood as mistakes
But its a byproduct of the ghetto music we make
From an extroverted point of view I think its too late
Hip Hop has never been the same since '88
Since it became a lucrative profession
There's a misconception that a movement in any direction is progression
Even though the potency of it lessens
Big money industries writing checks to suppress the question
And nobody gives a fuck no more, no one goes to the book store
Ever since the confluence of Moore's Law
But I stay in the lab like Niels Bohr and his son Aage
Edward Lorenz and Leo Szilard
Lyrically I took rap music and turned the knob
To the right full throttle and added panache
Why would I argue with my own conscience over the truth?
That's like me telling myself, ""Don't tell me what to do""
Dialyses and analyses of battle MCs
Sometimes I say things I myself can't believe
My lyrical is so skillfully elliptical
I can understand how it makes you miserable
You wonder why I never let you play your beats for me
Or why I keep my studio enshrouded in secrecy
You wonder what's my infatuation with Alicia Keys
""Canibus why don't you speak to me?""
Yo, I meant it when I said no one can shine on a song that features me
That's why I said it so vehemently
You need to replace the hate with respect
I'm probably the best yet, Poet Laureate
[Outro — James Dickey sample]
Generally I take… I go with the given, you know, with what comes ta me over, the celestial wireless… Whenever it comes. You’re lucky when you get it"

Oh, never I write, but if ever I write

No bra with that blouse, that's so necessary
No panties and jeans, that's so necessary
Now why you fronting on me, is that necessary?

Follow me, follow me, I'm the leader
And when I park cars, I don't pay for the meter
I remember I was younger, as a kid it was the best
I used touch to on all the pretty girls at recess
I'm at my peak, yes, I won't leave yet
Serial style, cereal aisle, I need Chex
I can make these rappers run like a hard drill
Rock band, show you how the guitar feel

Somebody tell Roth that I don't love college
'Cause the real world's kinda like Real World
And it's drama, so you are Svetlana
And I'm just a rhymer, swimming in the water
Tryna dodge the piranhas and fly to Bahamas
Pretty little momma, Chiddy in the spot
Where you at, pretty lady? Show me what you got
They say, ""Why you rapping for the kids for?""
I say, ""My clothes come fitted, the Lids store""
This summer you can catch me on a big tour
I'm high grade, I think they need to quiz more
And let me get wit' ya, don't let the kid hit ya

57, yes, yes, good for a D-Boy
Hand my MAC-11 to the engineer to record
Got the baddest women in the world for me to feed on
Double deck yacht, docked Boss, blowin' weed up
Revenue incredible, it put me on a pedestal
Columbia to Mexico, I figured was a better route
Look at me, a model now, models and them bottles 'round
A Blood holla, ""Ballin,'"" but the boys in blue, they shot 'em down
Gang-affiliated, colors prosecutors painted
Cause the niggas I employed name synonymous with mayhem
Instrumentals that are mental, Maybach kind of mental
400 off the lot, the block is monumental (Boss)
Some things your money can't buy
Like Heaven in the sky, even a better ride
In the rear, so many instruments I hear
Tucked behind curtain, no sign to fear
I'm higher than a lear, this Maybach music
Designer shit I wear, make hoes lose it (Boss)
Close your eyes and inhale the smoke
It's Maybach music, the realest shit I wrote, nigga

Perfectly like a Picasso, Rembrandts and Rothkos
I'm a major player, 40/40's in Vegas at the Palazzo
They said it was not so
Certain things your money can't buy
Like being this fly, 'til then, I'm just gon' ride
I'm like G Rap with better transportation
On the road to the riches, reach my final destination
In the lear, closer to Aaliyah, say a prayer
Hope I get to see her when I disappear from here, baby, yeah
But I don't see the endin' through these millionaire lenses
Just the two M's on the emblem
The partition roof, translucent and humidor
Refrigerators, where Ace of Spades or two I store
True story, my closet is like two stories
Straight to the happy endin', cause I don't do stories
Shawn Corey, real rap

And that muscle be that muzzle, when I stuff it in your grill
Stuffed shells, thanks to crack, I crack crab and lobsters
Not all mobsters imposters, gotcha
Boy, I got a eagle view, standin' on my balcony
Can only stay a week or two, so many people out for me
I bulletproofed the Maybach, got a killer's intuition
Holdin' on that MAC-11, Makaveli premonition
Waitin' on my Suge Knight, one nation under God
Since I chose a thug's life, guess I gotta play my part
Never will I die, my name symbolized
The hustle for young killers coming from the other side
Some things your money can't buy
Like Heaven in the sky, even a better ride
I'm large, my black car, menagin' black broads
Massage for frauds, I'm livin' large, my fat rocks
It's eat to kill in the field of hip-hop
Runnin' up on the car, you get popped, mopped and dropped

57, 62, tell me how you wanna move
Yeah, you know I got them both, beat your ass black and blue
(Yeah!) I was barely gettin' pretty women
Now I scoop Emmy winners like kitty litter
Any winter, Fendi denim like a slender nigga
Lookin' in the mirror, I can see the real contender
Celery for Eben Gregory, I'm on my dinner
So what the fuck is you telling me other than your gender?
I'm a boss, and I'm ridin' like a small Vogue
Niggas make your wheels and ride 'em 'til they fall off
Yeah! Ross!
[Chorus: T-Pain]
Hey! Realest shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach
Whatever I send out, homie, I'ma make back
Can you believe that? Whoa-ooh-ooh
You gotta see it (Hey!)
'Cause I don't plan on goin' broke, put that on my Maybach
'Cause I'm in it to win now, niggas can't take that
Listen to my Maybach music
To my Maybach music

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Well, all right!
Hehehe

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
All-black Maybach, I'm sittin' in the asshole
Classy as a mother, still gutter like a bad bowl
Benjamin Franklin on X how that cash roll
That's right, them mils do, like damp clothes
I eat your meal, too, we don't feel you
And we be strapping up like the Navy SEAL do
Sweet as banana-split every time I peel through
Fresher than Will Smith and Uncle Phil too
Watching TV in the Maybach in traffic
I'm on my feet like Tough-Actin' Tinactin
I'm running this shit, you should try tackling
Lil Wayne in one word? Immaculate
You see the Biggie, see the Jay, the 2Pac in him
The Kurt Cobain, the Andre Three Stacks
And then I'm back to doin' shit like I do's it
Maybach Music!
[Chorus: T-Pain & Lil Wayne]
Hey! Realest shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach (Yeah!)
Whatever I send out, homie, I'ma make back (Young Mula, baby!)
Can you believe that? Whoa-ooh-ooh (Oww!)
You gotta see it (Hey!)
'Cause I don't plan on goin' broke, put that on my Maybach
'Cause I'm in it to win now, niggas can't take that

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Post-Chorus: B.o.B]
Dreaming… of falling
Dreaming… of falling

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah, let's pretend like it's '98
Like I'm eatin' lunch off of Styrofoam trays
Tryin' to be the next rapper comin' out the A (A-Town)
Hopin' for a record deal to ignore my pain
Yeah, now let's pretend like I'm on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane
Okay, and everybody know my name (Bob)
And everywhere I go people wanna hear me sang
Oh yeah, and I just dropped my new album
On the first week I did 500 thousand
Gold in the spring, and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And let's pretend like they call me the greatest
Sellin' out arenas with big-ass stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Let's try to use imagination
[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Okay, let's pretend like this never happened (Never)
Like I never had dreams of bein' a rapper (Rapper)
Like I didn't write raps up in all of my classes (Classes)
Like I never used to run away into the blackness (Yeah)
Now, let's pretend like it was all good (Good)
Like I didn't live starin' in the notebook (Notebook)
Like I did the things that I probably knew I should (Should)
But I ain't have neighbors, that's why they call it hood (hood)
Yeah, now let's pretend like I ain't got a name (No)
Before they ever called me B.o.B or a.k.a. Bobby Ray
I'm talkin' back before the mixtapes (Cloud 9)
Before the videos and the deals and the fame (Yeah)
Before they ever once compared me to André (Three stacks)
Before I ever got on MySpace (Yeah)
Before they ever noticed my face (Yeah)
So let's just pretend and make wishes outta airplanes
[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?

And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream
But those days are gone
They're just memories
And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream
But those days are gone
All right…

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend things woulda been no different
Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin
They could blow away with the wind
""Marshall, you're never gonna make it
Makes no sense to play the game
There ain't no way that you'll win.""
Pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move and schools weren't changin' again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he could rip stadiums and just lazy as shit
""Fuck a talent show in the gymnasium, bitch!""
""You won't amount to shit—quit daydreamin', kid!""
""You need to get your cranium checked.""
""You're thinking like an alien, it just ain't realistic.""
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed at
And his alarm went off to wake him, but he didn't make it
To the Rap Olympics, slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gon' have a hard time explaining to Hailie and Lainey
These food stamps and this WIC shit
‘Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall in his lap, so he ain't even here, he pretends that—
[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now"

Wanna run up? Put the smackdown, crack down

Million stops, earthquakes from the beats, move the streets
I got the treats and it's a rap now
My sex is engulfed in a small pack of pow wow
I weigh the crowd for having a sound
That astounds the pounds, of leading to the track to the ground
And surround clowns with more color in they faces
In any circus in any town, uptown, downtown
Straight up and down, holler at the moon, now
Straight bring it to your face, kid
Blind ya like the police, sprayin' that mace, kid

I'm inhaling it, exhaling it, it makes me more intelligent
I feel like I’m still mailing it or selling it, they smelling it
Kush, purp, strong dro. What I need cologne for?
They tried to send me to rehab but I said
""No, no I won't go""
Damn it's really loud, smelling like a whole pound
Kush cologne, haze is her perfume
Bubba kush for breakfast, with my Captain Crunch
I smoke ten blunts before lunch
Know that sounds like that’s too much
I'm so high, I'm so in the sky, everybody know
Marijuana is my fragrance, probably smell it on my clothes
I smoke that bubonic sonic, I've been sipping gin and tonic
You lil' boys is hooked on phonics, Gucci hooked on chronic, Sonny

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 3: E-40]
I'm in this booch hella keyed (hella keyed, man, I'm sacked)
Man I've been smoking hella weed (Hella tweed man, and I ain't talking about Twitter, man, I'm talking about tweed)
Lick it twist back down
Probably won't know how I go home
Baby wanna suck my bone
She gotta fuck me jeans on
Fuck me dress on, fuck me jeans on
Fuck me dress on, fuck me jeans on
Anything holling a dane
Tryin' get brain butIdon't know her name
Looking at my chain
Let me explain
Kush, cocaine but I don't make it rain
Gimme the gudda bitch, no extension
Pay me up or pay me no attention
Send a botch, like you send it
Make her upload, all up in it
Retirement plan, Booch you my pension
Hater repellant, my brand new invention
Everything that I say I meant it
Rasied in the Bay where its’ so pimpin’
Raised in the Bay where it’s so pimpin’
Raised in the Bay where the bitches tempting
[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 4: Devin the Dude]
Kush is my cologne, I got many fragrances
Shit gets so expensive but I hardly have to pay for shit
Every puff is like a squirt, smell it all off in my shirt
Coworkers give me compliments every time I go to work
What kinda cologne you on?
Dro is like my aftershave
Have me feelin and smellin so good yo I don’t have to bathe
But by all means, I must keep my balls clean
Make sure my dicks legit then I go take care the small things
And it all seems worth it
450's kinda steep but I deserve it
Weed smell so loud that you think you heard that purp

Worst Enemy,Gucci Mane,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Listen to this track, bitch

[Chorus]
I’m my best friend, and I’m my worst enemy
And no one else can hurt me unless I let them, is you feeling me?
And misery loves company and I had my share of misery
No mystery, my infamy got me in hip hop history
First 2Pac died, then Biggie died, and that greatly impacted me
Then history repeated itself through me and I made history
(It’s Gucci)
So I don’t turn around no more, I look at whats in front of me
I’m focused on the future 'cause yesterday is history

[Verse 1]
A hard head makes a soft ass
Guess your Ma didn't teach ya that
Pick a spot to beef with me and that spot I will meet you at
Well let me check my schedule
I’m free Tuesday three weeks from now
You bring your crew I bring my crew
Just pick a time and side of town
Zone 6 is my stomping ground
But I guess you know that by now
But everywhere you go you hear me
That's why you're upset right now
Bought a Phantom and a Lamb' but I’m in my 'Vette right now
I raped the game without a rubber, bank accounts are pregnant now
That day they tried to murder me, a day I can’t forget about
And I don't wish no death on homie
Just want him to hear me out
Think about the past and all the many things we talked about
Think of all the people influenced by what comes out our mouth
[Chorus]
I’m my best friend, and I’m my worst enemy
And no one else can hurt me unless I let them, is you feeling me?
And misery loves company and I had my share of misery
No mystery, my infamy got me in hip hop history
First 2Pac died, then Biggie died, and that greatly impacted me
Then history repeated itself through me and I made history
So I don’t turn around no more, I look at whats in front of me
I’m focused on the future 'cause yesterday is history

[Verse 2]
I am not the perfect person
May don’t spit the perfect verses
I wouldn’t hurt a girl on purpose 'cause I feel they don’t deserve it
I admit my words can hurt, I dissed Tiny she didn’t deserve it
Our song didn’t interpret it right and I’m sorry for it
T.I. many times encouraged, told me face the game with courage
Clay gave me some great advice and still today I thankful for it
Me, Jeezy, and T.I share one thing in common: all are poets
Role model to young people tho at times man we still ignore it
And y’all gon owe respect to me and I don’t like apologies
Just diss me 'til you satisfied
I swear it doesn’t bother me
Sticks and stones will break my bones and bullets won't reflect off me
But words and insults only show the world how y'all respectin' me
[Chorus]
I’m my best friend, and I’m my worst enemy
And no one else can hurt me unless I let them, is you feeling me?
And misery loves company and I had my share of misery
No mystery, my infamy got me in hip hop history
First 2Pac died, then Biggie died, and that greatly impacted me
Then history repeated itself through me and I made history
(It’s Gucci)
So I don’t turn around no more, I look at whats in front of me
I’m focused on the future 'cause yesterday is history

[Verse 3]
All my homies ain’t my homies
Half friends no longer want me
I'm still hungry as I was when I did my first live performance
Things I got I know they want it
Things I done, they haven’t done it
Though they say that they my friends
I know that these niggas opponents
We can joke and laugh and party
But I know their smiles are phony
But I still pray that the Lord give 'em all the things they wanted
All the money in the world can’t get the joy I’m felling, homie
Like the third day with a woman like you and not for your money
You can help someone and love someone but still they'll turn and burn you
So I warn you in advance, watch out cause so called friends will con you
Think MJG said it best man will I ever know
Who my friends through thick and thin, cause so called friends will turn to foes
[Chorus]
I’m my best friend, and I’m my worst enemy
And no one else can hurt me unless I let them, is you feeling me?
And misery loves company and I had my share of misery
No mystery, my infamy got me in hip hop history
First 2Pac died, then Biggie died, and that greatly impacted me
Then history repeated itself through me and I made history
(It’s Gucci)
So I don’t turn around no more, I look at whats in front of me
I’m focused on the future 'cause yesterday is history"

I wanna see what's under therrrrrrrre...baby

[Verse 1: Drake]
Who's that peekin in my window?
Uh, you should let some more skin show
And if one of these websites get the info
Wii can work it out, no Nintendo
I just hit Alt + Tab
Switchin' in between two convos
I should just call cabs
And bring 'em both here to the condo
Yeah, normally it ain't a question
We would cross paths like an intersection
But she just too far away for affection
So I pray that we never lose a connection
Cause I remember Stacy, she prolly hate me
She used to threaten she had a man to replace me
She talk that shit, I just hit the escape key
And then she get mad and wanna go and erase me
And I remember Amy, she used to AIM me
She stayed up late, and used to blame me
She said I'm too wild, she wanna tame me
I told her even Photoshop couldn't change me
But you-you-you, you got me open girl, why lie?
We ain't even tryna settle, so why try?
End the night with a kiss and a bye bye
No strings attatched, your love is so Wi-Fi
[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
Uh, I love it, girl
The way your legs ?light up? when they're in them shoes, ohhh
I love it, girl
The way your lips looks after you apply the gloss
Ah, I love it, girl, girl
You look right in the screen then take it o-off, off

(She's my digital girl)

[Verse 3: Jamie Foxx]
My homies never see you
But I always got you right here for me
Tucked, in my Louis computer bag
Wherever you are, I could be
I type you a message full of X's and O's
You shoot me a video and then upload
Even though I hate this distance, it keeps me persistent
One day I'll have your ass up in this kitchen

[Hook: Jamie Foxx] (The-Dream)

(Oh baby, yeah baby!)

[Verse 5: Kanye West]
When you take the picture, cut off your face
And cover up the tattoo by the waist
Let the MC Serch 'til I reach 3rd base
And when I get home I'ma hit home plate
Wait, could this be considered our first date?
""'Ye, the picture just looks so trash""
Your body make a baller spend cooked coke cash
Plus every good girl wanna go bad
In Playboy mags like Stacey Dash
Or Kim Kardashian, be a lady aaaaat, it
You know what's a crazy thing?
Some girls'll make you wait longer than A.C. Green
Passion of the Christ, 33-Year Old Virgin
That's disrespectful baby, don't encourage him
I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican, or Persian
Dashiki, kimono, or turban
They say I dress white, but my swag so urban
Tryin my luck, I hit her with the text say
""Baby you up,"" Question mark
And she respond, ""YES-S-S-I-R""

I know you thinking, thinking that it must be
Armor-All flow 'cause it never get rusty
I ain't gotta say it, man, dog, trust me
Bust somebody head, GLC, where was we?
Still rock the Prada—'fore that, rock the Starter
Niggas had the Georgetown, the Magic way harder
Thinking back to the projects, and they way they tore 'em all up
Like when I do a project, and come back and tear the mall up

[Chorus: Common & Kanye West]
We coming from the Southside, Southside
Southside, Southside
Southside, Southside
Southside, side of the Chi
[Verse 2: Common]
The broads, the cars, the half-moons, the stars
I'm like Jeff Fort the way I get behind bars
Burn CDs with no regard for the stars
Come to the crib with conflict diamonds and they ours
Back in '94, they called me Chi-town's Nas
Now, them niggas know I'm one of Chi-town's gods
We eating, Joe, you still talking no carbs
A conscious nigga with mack, like Steve Jobs

Your fly is open, McFly
The crowd is open, I think I know why
I'm back from the future, seen it with my own eyes
And, yep! I'm still the future of the Chi
Back in college, I had to get my back up off the futon
I knew that I couldn't cop a coupe with no coupons
Look at that Neutron on his green like croutons
People asking him, ""Do you have any Grey Poupon?""

You in the building, but the building's falling
You wouldn't be balling if your name was Spalding
My mind get flooded, I think about New Orleans
'Bout to school y'all niggas; you should call him August
I'm the sun that goes down, but I'm still revolving
Southside, w—w—walk it out, while still, you're crawling
If rap was Harlem, I'd be James Baldwin
With money in the bank like G. Rap, we're calling

We coming from the Southside, Southside

With niggas masked up like Phantom of the Opera
Dreaming of the day they push a phantom to the operas
Can't wait 'til they say, ""'Ye ran up at the Oscars""
""Papa, I heard his life is like a movie""
Like when Em played him and Mekhi played a rasta
Mexicans gon' love it like it was for La Raza
But this is for the mobsters, holla

The un-American idol, tower like the Eiffel
Lean with it, rock with it, Black like the Disciples
Know when to use a bible and when to use a rifle
You rap like you should be on the back of a motorcycle
Caught a case of robbery, and beat it like Michael
Your career is a typo; mine was written like a haiku
I write to do the right things, like Spike do
Through conflicts that's Crucial and drama that's Psycho (Oh!)

Exhibit C,Jay Electronica,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Intro: Just Blaze]
Hey!
It's coming
Ladies and gentlemen; this time around
The revolution will not be televised, woo!
As we proceed!, To give you what you need!
'09, brother!, Get live, brother!
Ladies and gentlemen of the court
In the hearing against The State of Hip-Hop vs. Jay Electronica
I present: Exhibit C

[Verse 1: Jay Electronica & Just Blaze]
When I was sleepin' on the train
Sleepin' on Meserole Ave out in the rain
Without even a single slice of pizza to my name
Too proud to beg for change, mastering the pain
When New York niggas was calling southern rappers lame
But then jacking our slang (Oh!)
I used to get dizzy spells, hear a little ring
The voice of an angel telling me my name
Telling me that one day I'ma be a great mane
Transforming with the Megatron Don, spittin' out flames (Oh!)
Eating wack rappers alive, shittin' out chains (Woo!)
I ain't believe it then; nigga, I was homeless (Uh huh)
Fightin', shootin' dice, smokin' weed on the corners
Trying to find the meaning of life in a Corona
'Til the Five Percenters rolled up on a nigga and informed him:
""You either build or destroy, where you come from?""
""The Magnolia projects in the 3rd Ward slum""
""Hmm, it's quite amazing that you rhyme how you do
And that you shine like you grew up in a shrine in Peru"" (Ooh!)
Question Fourteen, Muslim Lesson Two:
Dip-dive-uh, civilize a eighty-five-uh
I make the devil hit his knees and say the ""Our Father""
Abracadabra, you rocking with the true and living
Shout out to Lights Out, Joseph I, Chewy Bivens
Shout out to Baltimore, Baton Rouge, my crew in Richmond
While y'all debated who the truth was like Jews and Christians
I was on Cecil B., Broad Street, Master
North Philly, South Philly, 23rd, Tasker
Six Mile, Seven Mile, Hartwell, Gratiot (Oh!)
Where niggas really would pack a U-Haul truck up
Put the high beams on, drive up on the curb
At a barbecue and hop up out the back like, ""What's up?"" (Buh!)
Kill a nigga, rob a nigga, take a nigga, bust up
That's why when you talk the tough talk, I never feel you
You sound real good and you play the part well
But the energy you givin' off is so unfamiliar
I don't feel ya (We need somethin' realer! Ooh!)
[Verse 2: Jay Electronica & Just Blaze]
Nas hit me up on the phone, said ""What you waitin' on?""
Tip hit me up with a tweet, said, ""What you waitin' on?""
Diddy send a text every hour on the dot saying
""When you gon' drop that verse? Nigga, you taking long""
So now I'm back spittin' that heat, could pass a polygraph
That Reverend Run rockin' Adidas out on Hollis Ave
That FOI, Marcus Garvey, Nikky Tesla
I shock you like an eel, electric feel, Jay Electra
Oh my God! Keep going!

[Verse 3: Jay Electronica & Just Blaze]
They call me Jay Electronica—fuck that
Call me Jay Elec-Hanukkah, Jay Elec-Yarmulke
Jay Elect-Ramadan, Muhammad as-salaam-alaikum
RasoulAllah Subhanahu wa ta'ala through your monitor (Ooh!)
My Uzi still weigh a ton; check the barometer
I'm hotter than the motherfucking sun; check the thermometer
I'm bringing ancient mathematics back to modern man
My mama told me, ""Never throw a stone and hide your hand""
I got a lot of family, you got a lot of fans
That's why the people got my back like the Verizon man
I play the back and fade to black, and then devise a plan
Out in London, smoking, vibing while I ride the tram
Giving out that raw food to lions disguised as lambs
And—by the time they get they seats hot
And deploy all they henchmen to come at me from the treetops
I'm chillin' out at Tweetstock, building by the millions
My light is brilliant
[Outro: Just Blaze]
Woooo!
I rest my case
'09, Act 3
First chapter of the end
The last chapter of a new beginning
If it's so
The things we do without even trying...
Be better than a lot of y'all records, don't get mad
Morning after, world premiere
Me!
For real, though?
I ain't even gon' say nothing
Matter of fact; I ain’t saying—
I don't even know why I'm sayin’ this
Jay, you should get Puff to do this over
We moving out, onto the next record
And, um, I'ma let this just ride
Ride, ride, ride

It Aint Hard to Tell,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Large Professor]

[Verse 1]
It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'
Hit the Earth like a comet—invasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian: half-man, half-amazin'
‘Cause in my physical I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Moët with Medusa, give her shotguns in Hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale; it ain't hard to tell

[Verse 2]
The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop
Place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L
School a fool well, you feel it like Braille
It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill, like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills, I'm Ill plus Matic
I freak beats, slam it, like Iron Sheik
Jam like a TEC with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze, like heroin in your nose
Nas will rock well; it ain't hard to tell
[Verse 3]
This rhythmatic explosion
Is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep? Well, let me try again
Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
I dominate break loops, givin' mics men-e-strual cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packin' like a Rasta in the weed spot
Vocals will squeeze Glocks
MCs eavesdrop, though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas' raps should be locked in a cell; it ain't hard to tell"

I rap for listeners, blunt heads, fly ladies and prisoners
Hennessy-holders and old-school niggas, then I be dissin' a
Unofficial that smoke Woolie Thai
I dropped out of Cooley High, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
Jungle survivor, fuck who's the live-r
My man put the battery in my back, a difference from Energizer
Sentence begins indented with formality
My duration's infinite, money-wise or physiology
Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
Choco blunts'll make me see him drop in my weed smoke
It's real, grew up a trife life, the times of white lines, the high pipes
Murderous night times and knife fights invite crimes
Chill on the block with Cognac, cold strap
With my peeps that's into drug money market interact
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler, I guess that means peace
For niggas, no sheisty vice to just snipe ya
Start off the dice-rollin' match, from craps to cee-lo
With side-bets, so roll a deuce, nothin' below
(Peace, God!) Peace, God – now the shit is explained
I'm takin' niggas on a trip straight through memory lane
It's like that, y'all…

""Comin' outta Queensbridge""
""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""
""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""
""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""

[Verse 2]
One for the money
Two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alizé, niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine, God
Check the prognosis: Is it real or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama
For real, a nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis; my razor embraces many faces
You're telephone blown, black, stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petro, dramatic automatic .44 I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed, so
My pen taps the paper, then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin' for somethin', some'll prosper, some fail
Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
I reinforce the frail with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say ""Peace""
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat; that nigga's name made bell rings, black
Some fiends scream about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin
Yo, fuck, rap is real! Watch the herbs stand still
Never talkin' to snakes, 'cause the words of man kill
True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my vein
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane

""Comin' outta Queensbridge""
""Now, let me take a trip down memory lane""

Aiyyo, Nas? Kick that fuckin' rhyme!

[Verse 1: Nas]
Check it out
When I'm chillin', I grab the buddha, get my crew to buy beers
And watch a flick, illin' and root for the villain, huh
Plus every morning, I go out and love it sort of chilly
Then I send a shorty from my block to the store for Phillies
After bein' blessed by the herb's essence
I'm back to my rest, ten minutes, some odd seconds
That's where I got the honey at, spends the night for sexin'
Keep lubrication, Lifestyle protection
Picking up my stereo's remote control quickly
Ron G's in the cassette deck, rockin' the shit, G
I try to stay mellow, rock, well, a cappella rhymes'll
Make me richer than a slipper made Cinderella, fella
Go get your crew, hops, I'm prepared to bomb troops
Y'all niggas was born, I shot my way out my mom dukes
When I was ten, I was a hip-hoppin' shorty wop
Known for rockin' microphones and twistin' off a 40 top

You know the hard times, kid
Shit, cold, be starvin' make you wanna do crimes, kid
But I'ma lamp ‘cause a crime couldn't beat a rhyme
Niggas catchin' 3 to 9's, Muslims yellin' ""Free the mind""
And I'm from Queensbridge, been to many places
As a kid, when I would say that outta town, niggas chased us
But now, I know the time, got a older mind
Plus control a 9, fine, see, now I represent mine
I'm new on the rap scene, brothers never heard of me
Yet I'm a menace, yo, police wanna murder me
Heini Dark drinker, represent the thinker
My pen rides the paper, it even has blinkers
Think I'll dim the lights, then inhale, it stimulates
Floatin' like I'm on the North 95 Interstate
Never plan to stop, when I write, my hand is hot
And expand the lot from the Wiz to Camelot
The parlayer, I'll make your heads bop, pah
I shine a light on perpetrators like a cop's car
From day to night, I play the mic and you'll thank God
I wreck shit so much, the microphone'll need a paint job
My brain is incarcerated
Live at any jam, I couldn't count all the parks I've raided
I hold a MAC-11, and attack a reverend
I contact eleven L's and max in heaven
[Chorus 3: Grand Wizard + Nas]
One time 4 your mind, one time
It sounds clever
One time 4 your mind, one time
Yeah, whatever
One time 4 your mind, one time
Yo, from '92 to '99

[Outro]
Yeah, that shit was crazy phat, pah
Know what I’m sayin'?
But check it, you got another verse for me
I want you to kick it, you know what I'm sayin'?
Kick that shit for the projects"

Heat in the kitchen, pot on the stove

I been running this rap game since I was 20 years old
I hung with the worst of 'em, bust 'til I burst 'em up
Floss 'em up, toss 'em up, Hardaway, cross 'em up
Pardon me, I'm bossing up, pressure up, bless you bruh
Don't mess with us, we like the U in the 80's
Back to back, set a trap, hit the lick, hit it back
Hit the trick, jump the track, bitch I want my money back
Time and time again while I'm sipping on this gin
Al Davis said it best, ""Just win baby, win""

Born to Roll,Masta Ace,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Brainiac, dumb-dumbs, bust the scientifical
Approach to the course and the force is centrifugal
Can you find ya way through the lyrics that be catching 'em
Throw another rhyme across the room they be fetching 'em
And they take a loss, take a loss to the Master and I
Throws crazy blows and they knows I be plastering
All across the room on the ceilings and the walls too
Punk little suckers didn't know I had the gall to
Come around they block with my cock-diesel system and
Turn it up to 10 and then start to diss them and
They didn't wanna battle if they did when they saw me
They'd a opened up they trunk but they try to ignore me
Hey little suckers I know you hear me callin' you
Thought you wanted some but I see that you all into
Frontin' ain't no future in your frontin' so let's get it on
Like Marvin Gaye,(hey) take the cash and sit it on
The hood of ya wick-wack low-ridin' Cadillac
Back up ya boys and let's start the battle
Act like, ya know, the Masta Ace don't play when it come to my bass, aahhhh
[Hook]
Check it out baby, check it out y'all
I was born to roll (repeat several)

[Verse 2]
Drivin' down the block like what else should a brother do
It's Saturday, it's Saturday, the heat might smother you
Rolling down my windows yeah I have a air-conditioner
But I got the sound I want the whole world to listen to
Waitin' at a red light, Kentucky Fried Chicken in
Low End Theory tape in, bass crazy kicking in
See this Puerto Rican Latin Chico Rico Suave
In a red Corolla eh yo does he wanna play?
Pullin up beside me, looking like he want it
Show me what you got then watch me get up on it
Holding up traffic but we can't hear they horns
'Cause he got musica grande yeah he got it goin on
But I think I better school him 'cause he don't know the time
So I'm turnin' up the boom 'cause he cannot mess with mine
Brothers hear me hitting from like 50 blocks away I
Wanna turn they heads so you know I gotta play
High decibels passing through a residential district
See a few cuties and I turn it up like Bisquick
Mira, mira man don't sleep, I got tha, I got tha, I got the woofers in my Jeep

[Hook]
Check it out baby, check it out y'all
I was born to roll (repeat several)
[Verse 3]
Black boy, black boy turn that shit down
You know that America don't wanna hear the sound
Of the bass drum jungle music go back to Africa
Nigga I'll arrest you if you holding up traffic
I'll be damned if I listen, so cops save your breath and
Write another ticket if ya have any left and
I'm breaking ear drums while I'm breaking the law
I'm disturbing all the peace 'cause Sister Souljah said war
So catch me if ya can, if you can here's a donut
'Cause once you drive away, yo ya know I'm gonna go nuts
And turn it up to where it was before nice try
But ya can't stop the power of the bass in ya eye
I wonder if I blasted a little Elvis Presley
Would they pull me over and attempt to arrest me
I really doubt doubt it, they probably start dancing
Jumpin' on my tip and pissing in they pants and
Wiggling and jiggling and grabbing on they pelvis
But you know my name so you never hear no Elvis
Strictly the hardcore dirty street level hits
God's on my side so watch what the devil gets
Positivity hitting 50 levels deep
Coming out, they coming out the woofers in my Jeep

Seasons,CunninLynguists,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Masta Ace]
One two
It's Masta Ace, Cunninlynguists
We about to get into the seasons
The seasons of hip hop
How we gonna start it?

[Verse 1: Masta Ace]
As we spring back to the past, it was all happening fast
We glorified coke and smoking crack in a glass
When b-boys danced to the latest jam
You could say this man was the greatest fan
When shoelaces were fat, and all the rapper's faces were black
And light-brown, a box with the right sound was all you needed
When it blast, they must move
You just proved you're hard like L in Krush Groove
And songs started to drop, Ain't nobody start at the top
Before Preme learned the art of the chop
This is way before SP's and MPC's
And long before CD's and MP3's
The game started to bloom and blossom
And masters ready for the cermony, like a groom in costume
Growth from the rain of the previous years
I took notes from what I heard through these devious ears
Yeah
[Verse 2: Deacon the Villian]
As Summer's heatwaves ascended in it's splendid manner
Green was flooding our scene, although the skin was tanner
""Fuck The Police!!"" jumpin over radio scanners
It was hot in the shade, wet paint all over the canvas
Fuck Vanilla Ice cones, we had T, Cube's Amerikka's Most
And wanted that Chronic on the Left-Coast
Talent pools were full and fresh for swimming
Backstrokin' through Dark Sides and Illmatic beginnings
Them lemonade stands would make you street platinum
It was 2 Live, Florida crews caught heat for rappin'
But free speech pollination kept bees colonizing in hives
And stung Delores Tucker right in her pride
The Tribes ocean splash was rising the tide
Strictly 4 My Niggas that were Ready To Die in the ride
I wish the summer's vibe could've lasted forever
To bad we had to have a change in that weather, that shit was beautiful

[Hook]
""Seasons Change, mad things rearrange""
""Play me in the winter
Play me in the summer
Play in the autumn
Any order""
[""Seasons Change, mad things rearrange""]
""Trees bright and green turn yellow brown, autumn caught em
See all them leaves must fall down""
Verse 3: [Kno]
As the East vs. West winds blew, causing two
Legends to Fall like maple leaves from escalated beef
Assumed that the worst was over
Til these cats started wearing shiny costumes like the 31st of October
The weather's colder, but the word jacket/jack it
Is what they did to people's styles
Not what they covered they backs with
Tactics of the skill impaired
No Limit to what they'll do when the green is scarce
Some be Thanksgiving for who they know
While others get jerked for loot
Cause getting signed ain't a turkey shoot
No respect for the pilgrims who paved the way so you could rock that
Just pop crap and Plymouth Rock-Rap
Beyond gimmicks and fake plastic tits
Outkast and Raekwon dropped fall classic discs
Born to Roll, so I'm taking you back to school days of autumn
Before the bottom dropped out in 2K

[Verse 4: SOS]
By the dawn of the new millennium we saw bright chains
Winter brought along platinum causing the ice age
No more Gold, no more YO! MTV RAPS
Now we got R&B cats stealing classic rap tracks
In winter it's snowed in like the temperature's below ten
Citizens open up shows for more snowmen
Scrawny boys rock bubblegooses to pose like grown men
And you can catch freezer burn from women when they show skin
Jolly, fat, white men get paid when rap hits the shelves
And artists themselves get treated like Elves
Matter of fact, Santa's gotten so greedy when a rapper sells
You even need clearance to sample Jingle Bells
What the hell! You need cells and 2 ways for chicks to bone ya?
And so much ice on ya body that you can get pneumonia
Even at the beaches of Daytona it's gotten colder
But it's about time for the cycle to start over (echo)
How we gon' start it?"
Like Toy Soldiers,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down...

[Chorus]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Verse 1]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it
My crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe-to-toe with a Benzino
It don't matter, I never drag 'em in battles that I can't handle
'Less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross, and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some JAY-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object, for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy somethin' I helped build?
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' ****
And that was just outta respect, for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV, down-talkin' the man
Who literally saved my life, like fuck it, I understand
This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' the shit could pop off at any minute, 'cause—
[Chorus]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Verse 2]
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated, 'cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated—it ain't just words no more, is it?
It's a different ballgame, you call names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it, 50, smash him! Mash on him, let him have it
Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?
Well, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then!
But I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we've just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
Who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important
It is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man, if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at the jaws, well, then I can, 'cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience
'Cause—
[Chorus]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers"
Tangerine,Big Boi,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: T.I. & Big Boi]
She said her name was Tangerine, damn, the American Dream
She all about her fucking cream, shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine, she shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine, she shake it like a tambourine
She said her name was Billie Jean, said she wanna show me things
I pulled out a stack of green, shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine, shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine, shake it like a tambourine

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Now let's set it straight, B-I-G don't cut for cake
I put her on a plate until she's no longer awake
They just lay fast asleep when I hit 'em with the snake
Put that venom up in 'em until I leave 'em with the shakes
On display, she's a model but she only model shoes
Not fake like a prosthetic leg or prostitute
How'd she choose? She just whispers in my ear, ""I'm with you""
I'm the type of dude that sends your baby momma out for food
And I also like her throat action with a passion
Love in her mouth for dental satisfaction
That means I hit the head like Greg Louganis then I'm splashing
Ugh, bust one back in the 'Lac stabbing (Hootie hoo!)
She knows what's happening, there's no reason to doubt it
If you ask her how I got it she say, ""How he had went about it was""
And then you wake up from a bad dream
A nightmare, settle down, 'cause she right there

Okay, midnight, fit like four or five chicks
In the drop 66, bumpin' Southernplayalistic
Yeah, we riding through the city like Monday Magic City Nights (Hey)
Pass dees around, momentarily they feeling like (Okay)
Getting right, good girls got them getting busy like (Yeah)
Big dykes, eating so much pussy they forget pipe (What about me?)
All got boyfriends, tell me they don't hit it right
They come see me so they can come be freaks
In the backseat, everything fast like a track meet
All I can see is titties, pussy lips, and ass cheeks
Actually, no exaggeration, no imagining
Real talk, my reality is your fantasy (Yuh)
Keisha, Kim, Tameka, Shay, Alisha, and Gloria
Chasing this broad tryna find euphoria (Gotta find, ayy)
Name notorious (What?), dick game glorious (What?)
Find me, shawty, when your boyfriend boring you (Ayy, ayy)

Shake it like some Texas Pete dropping on your collard greens
Make it hotter and she want a dollar do you follow me?
Shake it like a tambourine, shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine, shake it like a tambourine
Smelling like some tangerines, rolling like she on some beans
Garter belt full of green, booty busting out the seams
Shake it like a tambourine, she shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine, about to shake it like a tambourine (Okay...)

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Once upon a rhyme I knew this girl and she was fine
As everything outdoors, the kinda girl I describe her like—
Michael Jordan when he's froze in a pose of a jumpman
Top flight security on these hoes, man
She drop it low only for me to pick her up
When she's liquored up, I'm leaving my fingerprints on her butt
Ten-hut at attention as we stand for this woman
General Patton, boy, stop, we think she's coming
Loving the way that I'm licking her down, boy, you bluffing
Nothing, while a nigga like me be straight up royal flushing
But this ain't about playing no cards, dummy
Her get me open my sugar and she go hard for me
Even take a charge for me if the coppers caught us riding
To get a tray of fruit and a pack of one-point-fives and
I'm all the way on them papers, she all the way on my team
We burn it down like California trees in the breeze (FIRE!)
[Hook: T.I. & Big Boi]
She said her name was Tangerine, damn, the American Dream
She all about her fucking cream, shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine, she shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine, she shake it like a tambourine
She said her name was Billie Jean, said she wanna show me things
I pulled out a stack of green, shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine, shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine, shake it like a tambourine"

Hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still, I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

You're gonna be, a shinin' star

And then you'll see, you're gonna go far

Is it cause they like my gangsta walk?

Dear Hip-Hop,King Chip,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
Dear hip-hop, please
Don't you forget about little old me
Oh, I'm just a little O.G
And I done seen the game change up on me

[Verse 1 – Chip tha Ripper]
Way back in my day, when it was all about spitting music was crazy
I fuck with Nas and Master P was my Jay-Z
Jigga was spitting but I couldn't understand it
I knew it was some fly shit, it just never landed
'Til I hit the ninth grade, by that time 50 done step in the game
But I had been bumping that shit from mixtapes
And I got hip to Canibus in like sixth grade
And that crazy motherfucker just took over my brain
It's a little Big L in my raps today
Even though he gone, nah, he ain’t gone, you listening to him
Just from reciting the lines you’d think that I knew ‘em
Bumping that Redman not giving a fuck about nothing
Imagine if I was getting high, I wasn’t even puffing
Hiding the CD from my momma, shit had too much cussing
Baby I ain’t gonna leave you for nothing
Can you just write me back, please?
[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Naledge]
I found the blueprint way before school was my hustle
Beyond a reasonable doubt, I was a nigga with attitude
Illmatic, no reason for me to be mad at you
‘Cause life is too short, even when you ready to die
Picture this: a little nigga comin’ up in the Chi
Using common sense, give my mind a resurrection
Though I used to love her, never lost my erection
Underground king, po’ pimpin' in the muddy waters
It’s just me against the world, get rich or die trying
Three feet high and rising
Now I see clear like vising; whoops, I mean Visine
So far gone, plus I wanna be king
Not a college dropout, seen graduation
In my lifetime is just your imagination
For now I’m just a lyricist lounging ‘til I reach my salvation
Please

[Hook]

[Verse 3 – 6th Sense]
Don’t forget
Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
I was ten years old with the flow I reminisce
They called me White Mike before I became the 6th
Hip-hop showed me love with a hug and a kiss
Used to tape the radio when it was on late
Used to cop mixtapes when they was on tapes
You couldn’t pull the wrong record out the wrong crate
Truthfully, it used to seem every song’s great
Influenced your walk, fashion and your speaking
Every third weekend, was at the Nuyorican
I was underage so I used to have to sneak in
Student of the game, open-minded for the teaching
I paid dues, yeah, I knew dude’s reaching
I give a fuck about the songs y'all leaking
I’m done preaching, sip the Hennessey, burn the incense
Dear hip-hop, yours truly, 6th Sense

Anxiety,Black Eyed Peas,"['pop', 'rock', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
I feel like I wanna smack somebody
Turn around and bitch slap somebody
But I ain't goin' out bro (no, no, no)
I ain't givin' into it (no, no, no)
Anxieties bash my mind in
Terrorizing my soul like Bin Laden
But I ain't fallin' down bro (no, no, no)
I won't lose control bro (no, no, no)
Shackle and chained
My soul feels stained
I can't explain got an itch on my brain
Lately my whole aim is to maintain
And regain control of my mainframe
My bloods boiling its beatin' out propane
My train of thoughts more like a runaway train
I'm in a fast car drivin' in a fast lane
In the rain and I'm might just hydroplane

[Hook]
I don't fear none of my enemies
And I don't fear bullets from Uzi's
I've been dealing with something that's worse than these
That'll make you fall to your knees and that's
The anxiety
The sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoias brought me to my knees
Lord, please, please, please
Take away my anxiety
[Verse 2]
My head keeps running away my brother
The only thing making me stay my brother
But I won't give into it bro (no, no, no)
Gotta get myself back now
God, I can't let my mind be
Tell my enemy is my own
Gots to find my inner wealth
Gots to hold up my thoughts
I can't get caught (no, no, no)
I can't give into it now (no, no, no)
Emotions are trapped set on lock
Got my brain stuck goin through the motions
Only I know what's up
I'm filled up with pain
Tryin' to gain my sanity
Everywhere I turn it's a dead end in front of me
With nowhere to go gotta shake this anxiety
Got me feelin' strange paranoia took over me
And its weighin' me down
And I can't run any longer, yo
Knees to the ground

[Hook]
I don't fear none of my enemies
And I don't fear bullets from Uzi's
I've been dealing with something that's worse than these
That'll make you fall to your knees and that's

Paranoias brought me to my knees
Lord, please, please, please
Take away my anxiety
The sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoias brought me to my knees
Lord, please, please, please
Take away my anxiety

Seven,Army of the Pharaohs,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Planetary]
Yeah! Yo, uh
A lot of rappers try approaching the omen
My poems will punish your people while I’m up at the podium
Pharaohs folding 'em, like washed clothes again
I'm a vulture when the flow go choke your kin
Broke, I leave most of them, slow, I keep my motionin'
Eye on the prize
I silence the wise, my lyrics make a scientist cry
Making a secret society expose their purpose
Making 'em unleash info and explode in my surface
I'm taking my time to birth this, rap entity earthless
It's show time, there's no time, be ready when the curtain split
I'm hurtin' shit, too powerful for painkillers
On the concrete jungle we walk like trained guerillas
Untamed, and my niggas is Kane, Kool G, Rakim, combined into one frame
We like the new mecca of immaculate rappers
Vinnie Paz, call the goons, now we back with the clappers

[Verse 2: Chief Kamachi]
Yo, remain silent, kill him with what I mentally says
Bloody Fez, choke you like an Indian rez
Kamach, animal Turk, sick with a cannibal smirk
Welcome, this where the murderers lurk
It's my mind, that make sure that the Sun can work
Scorch bodies, leave all of your gunmen hurt
Pharaoh sultans, create a serious cult jam
And my hand is where the tears of the pope ran
They stay watching like they keep me on a scope cam
I'm in Heaven with the angels that smoke grams
You need God, that's why the earth so damned
International, trying to get my flow banned
That's cool, if I don't kick these prayers
A lot of floods and famines gonna hit these years
Kamachi back on the chapel stairs
Open the clouds, let the thunder clap your ears
[Verse 3: King Syze]
You wanna put your money up? Then muthafucker then put it
For your family's sanity man, I wish that you wouldn't
Niggas got nice flows, just dont know where to put it
And I know your whole life your raps are edited footage
And y'all mixtape niggas couldn't see my plateaus
All up in my presence, while y'all actin' bashful
King Syze casting an ecliptic rap flow
Y'all little light niggas couldn't feed my shadows
From, city to city, intersection to section
But you reflexin', with or without a weapon
I'm always steppin', never scared
But always and forever prepared
Yeah the ones who drink gas man is revvin' their gears

[Verse 4: Reef the Lost Cauze]
You now rocking' with the foulest clique in the continent
Total dominance, rise to prominence
In my prime like Optimus, stand in astonishment
At this conglomerate, an axis of evil
I know where Osama is, he down in Camp David
Down and dirty like a damp basement
The champ must demand greatness
From himself, or be another contender
There's hundreds of niggas
Dead left under the river
From the days of slaves
To hurricanes in Orleans
See my people's graves floatin' amongst the waves
There's hell to pay, but
The devil don't take checks
I tried to send a message to God
His phone don't take texts
I need a new plan, a crook with knowledge
Times is hard homie, why I took them dollars
Man, my momma got a mortgage
And my little baby sister need books for college
I rob all of y'all
[Verse 5: Doap Nixon]
Hey, yo, they want the hood in here so they called me first
I give 'em rappers gatorade cause they ball with thirst, UH!
This is more than music
But these niggas is mad trash
That's why the stores refuse 'em
Yo, I'm out in Georgia, went straight to the block
I'm seein' cats motorcyclin' dawg, I'm doin the walk
I'm an O.G., call my Italian niggas a wop
Though their papers ain't right, but they got weight on the block
I love 'em uh
Hand to hand, see your hands ache
I drunk so much syrup dawg I stopped eatin' pancakes
Ya niggas cool dawg mine's absurd hot
Stop frontin' like you's a killer money, your nerves shot
Yo you's a Paxil nigga, dumpin' Zoloft in coffee
AOTP what exhaust be
Can't keep it gear, cause I'm blinging with F's
But I got my mind right so swing your shit to the left

[Verse 6: Demoz]
Nigga if I had 24 hours to live
Fuck 24 hours, gimme 24 seconds
Vin I'm drivin' off a bridge
Broken rib, no windshield, covered in kerosene
Gasoline tank filled to the top
Magazines of these phony rappers ripped in pieces
No priest is, strong enough to take me out of my zone
I broke Jesus, choke niggas who squeal
Rob niggas who steal, kill niggas who kill
I'm too sick for a pill
Man these niggas ain't real, they real fake
They say they a man but they fuckin' reveal snakes
That's when you put 'em in the trunk with their grill taped
Rip in reverse then run into a steel gate
I'm a suicide driver, never been a liar
If I don't kill you later, I'mma kill you mañana
You don't want no problems
You don't want no drama
Nigga I'mma take a trip with your baby momma, suicide driver
[Verse 7: Celph Titled]
Ya better cross your T's
Cause we'll dot your eyes
You can say that you specialize but pharaohs will optimize
Backstage will get a bitch back smacked there
The mac glare like dirty south pimp slap clap snares, YEAH!
Holy paragraphs, what kind of shit is that?
I'm Jesus in the flesh so this is motherfuckin' Christian rap
Y'all just Christmas wrap, must be the secret Santa
My reindeer aim near, pierce you with the antlers
I made 'em go easy, and called off the wolves on my AOTP radio CB
Cause y'all ain't worthy of grenades and RPGs
Slit throat, hope you float with sardines and seaweed
Cause this is C-E-L-P-H demonic symphony
Listen to the hell we make
And a year before your kids tenth birthday came
You didn't have to wait for candles on the cake to see the nine flame

[Verse 8: Vinnie Paz]
Respect a G, my clique clap at you incessantly
I lay back and drink alcohol excessively
It ain't a rapper that's alive today that's testing me
I got degrees in being ignorant and weaponry
A 40 oz and Dutch Master is the recipe
That's my shit there, that'll be the death of me
Give me a death mask, better yet an effigy
I understand the math of death and it's complexity
I understand how you was violently murked
I understand how you was raised under the lies of the church
But understand and recognize that I'm cursed
With the ability to end your fucking lives with a verse"

We’re back!
Pharaoh clique, motherfucker!
Yeah!

Apathy! Celph Titled! (Kamachi!)
Vinnie P! Outerspace! 7L, ES!

[Verse 1: Apathy]
I put you up on the IV, not the Roman Numeral 4
But the IV that leads to the funeral floor
Wax gets melted, breaks bones, fractures pelvics
Speeds through space and cracks glass Astronaut helmets
Face it, motherfucker I could pay to get rid of you!
I've got more heads in the hood than Pagan rituals
A new tyrannical force for you to fear
Known to kill and keep human ears as souvenirs
A shape-shifter, face slitter, paper getter, tape your sister
Wake your sister, make your sister, take it in the face
And if you're facing us, block off a thirty-block radius
I throw more blows than boxing Doctor Octavius
[Verse 2: King Syze]
Ever since we made some noise I learned people love a winner
We the quality of deep dish rims, y'all the hub spinners
Tough sinners, break bread with Jesus at dinner
Protected by a heavenly force, fuck a minister!
Niggas know better, no one's letter is better than mine
Every time I rhyme, it's metal, the terror level is high
Plus I testify, it's best you die
Then to find the truth deep down in a mountain of lies
Downsize, I'm ousting you guys deep in the dirt
Clocking in and out of rap, have y'all fiending for work
When I'm breeding, yo it's treason what the semen is worth
Non-believing, make me steaming, make you meeting the earth

[Verse 3: Crypt the Warchild]
Ayo, it's my world and I won't stop
And if you stand in my way you bound to get popped
In the land where you lay and fade from stray shots
I demand that you pay and stray from strange blocks
I'm the man that you pray don't spray the flames hot
I could tan in the blaze for days and stain cops
I astound and amaze, y'all praise the same God
I'mma pound out your brain and scrape the graveyard
Have you shout out in pain, y'all say y'all Bravehearts?
I'mma box up your frame and play the same card
And I'm out for fame, space-bars, and quasars
Pharaohs locked the game, no shame, we hate y'all
[Bridge 1: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah! Raw motherfucking rap!
Hardcore shit! '94 shit!
Shoot the fucking place up, yeah!

[Verse 4: Des Devious]
A-O-T-P, blast through your army fatigues
Damage your team, the competition done it with ease
Gun in my sleeve 'cause nowadays homicide is my steez
Collecting my cream, I'm living your dream and peeping your scheme
Put you on lean from right hooks, pausing your jux
You fake crooks need to hit them books
Learn the rules of the game, two to your brain, three to your frame
Incredible pain, you getting drenched in that ""November Rain""
We the opposite of that wack shit, trash man, the clack rapid
You die tragic, five-six professional assassins
Rocking these mics and repping my fam with passion
Remember its Q-Dement', you bastards!

[Verse 5: Esoteric]
Tell your man and your parents
We be demanding ten grand an appearance
At the minimum, my venom damage your lyrics
We be like Manny Ramirez, compatible with the radical
Magical and emphatical, I'ma battle 'til I shatter your clavicle
Call me admiral, raising the temp of the room
I'm the emperor, remember I'll never surrender
I dismember platoons, your petty men are buffoons
We send 'em to their doom the second my venom enters their wounds
I mentally bloom, exhume tombs with dope lyrics
2Pac is alive and well, Big L ""The Devil's Son""
Rise from hell with dope lyrics
Live in regret, A-O-T-P these shook rappers hit the deck
[Verse 6: Chief Kamachi]
Courtesy of the streets, make it a microphone Middle East
My specialty, only rhymer enveloping my lyric sheets
Knock turbans off of sheikhs, use a pipe bomb
Downtown Israeli boutiques, full of dead tourists
With they dreams no longer in arms' reach, that's what I call
Dealing with calm speech, when I alarm your peeps
Inscribed in a peasant's palm is a blessed psalm
If you draw and your weapons wrong, there ain't no stepping on
My forty-five is my weapon, my culture's a holster
Where seven-inch slugs is kept in, squarely I step in
Tilting my clips and blue Stetson, God is my essence
So you could check these rhymes for reference, adept to any preference, pussy!

[Bridge 2: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, baby!
Kings of the motherfucking underground!
Y'all motherfuckers don't want it with us!
This that raw shit!
Throwback shit!

[Verse 7: Celph Titled]
I make Evel Knievel music, I come through stunting
Every verse is the same, just flipped a little something-something
Baby, I'm crazy, a crazy baby, a sick infant
Born with an intent to spit slick sentences with sick penmanship
Shoot at your Chicago fitted and knock your socks off
Aimed at your door but hit your head, shot your locks off
I heard you was afraid to say my name on your record
Cause you's afraid I'd put your motherfucking frame on a stretcher
I can't change laws son, that's a government issue
But I'll break laws with a gun that's a government issue
It's the Army, we got power in numbers
And that's nines, forty-fives, three-five-sevens, and M-500s

[Verse 8: Planetary]
Some people say I'm superior when I shit it
Vivid visionary spit, vocabulary ridiculous
I am a tyrant, I'm Violent by Design
I silence the scientific with every line of the rhyme
Mozart of street rap, breaking the barriers
Space Harrier, filled with forties and pit terriers
Ready to mangle, anybody cross a line
I saw the sign then ran with the Army, lost in time
Ready for war, but won't rock no dick trees
I rock mics, you think it's a hundred and sixty degrees
Who stomp crews, batter and bruise cliques
Kill bitches and stab you tricks
With loose lips

[Verse 9: Vinnie Paz]
I'm slightly disturbed, Pazienza is nice with the words
That's the reason that I'm fly, like the life of a bird
I don't care if you dead, let God have ya
Cause I'mma stay rugged and raw like Marv Hagler
That's something you don't know about you small rapper
Nice with the left, nice with the right, the jaw tapper
Allah backer, murder every track that I'm on
You just spit a fucking verse wack, then you gone
Fuck fame, I studied the fame closely
They build you up, then you get rocked like Shane Mosley
It's pain, homie, and your blood in my pen
It's Army of the Pharaohs and we flooded with gems

Involved with cream, you know exactly what this shit's about
Fuck y'all mean? Handlin' since a teen, I dish out
Like the point guard off your favorite team, without doubt
My life ain't rosy but I roll with it
My mind was fine till the dough hit it and told me that the Mo' did it
And now it's kosher, shit is so Hasidic
I blow a digit on a diamond in a minute but, no bitches
Watch how I'm walkin', 'cause even the thoroughest niggas be NARC'in
Tryin' to strike a bargain, hopin' that they might get pardoned
Shit I'm involved with got me pins and needles
And my cerebral breeds the wickedest evil, thoughts that this sport'll feed you
Peep facts, in the game so deep fiends could catch a
Freeze off my kneecap, can y'all believe that?
Got the city drinkin' Cristals, re-up the fee

My rise to riches surprised the bitches: think harder

Niggas'll coast in the SL but can't post bail
Niggas'll roast a L, but scared to throw your toast, well
I'm here to tell niggas it ain't all swell
There's heaven, then there's hell, niggas
One day you're cruisin' in your 7, next day, you're sweatin', forgettin' your lies
Alibis ain't matchin' up, bullshit catchin' up
Hit with the RICO, they repo your vehicle
Everything was all good just a week ago
'Bout to start bitchin', ain't you? Ready to start snitchin', ain't you?
I'll forgive your weak-ass: hustlin' just ain't you
Aside from the fast cars, honies that shake they ass at bars
You know you wouldn't be involved
With the underworld dealers, carriers of MAC-millers
East Coast bodiers, West Coast cap-peelers
Little monkey niggas turn gorillas
Stopped in the station, filled up on octane, and now they not sane
And not playin', that goes without sayin'
Slayin' day in and day out, when money play in, then they play you out
Tryin' to escape my own mind, lurkin' the enemy
Representin' infinity with presidencies, you know?

[Verse 4: Juelz Santana]
Now when they see Cam and his (boy), they say damn (oh boy)

Cannons and bandanas, blammers we don't brandish
Blam at your man's canvas then scram with your man's leaded

[Verse 5: Cam'ron]
Until that man is vanished

All I Do Is Win Remix,DJ Khaled,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: T-Pain]
All I do is win, win, win, no matter what

Who hotter than me (Khaled), I'm wearin' the crown
We can't stop, won't stop; go hate on me now

I could never get enough when it come to gettin' fetti
Niggas ain't ready for my Ferrari Scaglietti
Mario Andretti, money comin' fast
My honeycomb hideout is made of all glass
I could never be a racist
Wake up every morning just to count white faces, Neo in the Matrix
Glorious as Morpheus, employed all warriors
I'm mean as a scorpion, Dr. Kevorkian

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Fire and brimstone, yo
Everytime I come you gotta know a nigga comin'
Get a lot of money when I'm in the buildin'
And I come and say there ain't motherfucker money better, better, better, better!
Uh-huh, Okay
Niggas know I got you when I hit you with the pitter-patter
Whenever they see me then you hear a lot of chitter-chatter
Niggas know there ain't nobody better, better, better, better!
I watch a lot of niggas when I'm in the cut
So sick when I come and hit 'em in the gut
You will crown me king (no matter what!)

Ok, let's shine my friend
Get up on my grind again
Some niggas will be happy that I chose to rhyme with them cause

Her heart racing like she snort cocaine
I got a billion reasons you should know my whole name
Got the most paper Mr. New York Times
I'm a natural born winner nigga New York mines
Everybody getting money but I cop the first six
Now I run the game so I toss the first pitch
Yea, I'll let you wife her but she still my first bitch
If it's less then nine digits nigga, that ain't fuckin' rich mother fucker

[Verse 5: Nicki Minaj]
Uh
Ayo, all I do is win, ain't that the reason that you really mad
Undisputed hailing all the way from Trinidad
I ain't mad ma, see you on your bummy swag
I'm in that money green Jag, lot of money bags
I told Khaled you the best but I'm the bestest
Better run for cover if your name is on my checklist
You could talk slick, all the way down to the welfare
Ask the IRS bitch, I'm paying for your health care
[Verse 6: Fabolous]
I'ma make this here official, Let me clear some issues
First off I am not for Britney Spears initials
Thats no B-S, at your re-quest

Finish em, I'm through with em
They gon have to jump me, it's gon take a few of em

Get Em High,Kanye West,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Kanye West]
Uh-uh, I'm tryna catch the beat
Uh, I'm tryna catch the beat
I'm tryna catch the beat, uh-uh, uh-uh
I'm tryna catch the beat

[Chorus: Kanye West]
N-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands
Get 'em high
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man
Get 'em high
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
Keep 'em high
And if you're losin' your high, then smoke again
Keep 'em high (Now, now, now, now)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My flow is in the pocket like wallets, I got the bounce like hydraulics
I can't call it, I got the swerve like alcoholics
My freshman year, I was going through hella problems
'Til I built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college
My teacher said I was a loser, I told her, ""Why don't you kill me?""
I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna follow
My heart, and if you follow the charts
Or the plaques or the stacks, you ain't gotta guess who's back, you see?
I'm so Chi that you thought I was bashful
But this bastard's flow will bash your skull
And I will cut your girl like Pastor Tro'
And I don't usually smoke, but pass the 'dro
And I won't give you that money that you askin' for
Why you think me and Dame cool? We assholes
That's why we hear your music and fast forward
'Cause we don't wanna hear that weak shit no mo'
[Chorus: Kanye West]
N-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands
Get 'em high
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man
Get 'em high
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
Keep 'em high
And if you're losin' your high, then smoke again
Keep 'em high (Now, now, now, now, now, You've got mail)

[Verse 2: Kanye West, Sumeke Rainey & Talib Kweli]
Now who the hell is this
Emailing me at 11:26
Telling me that she thirty-six, twenty-six plus double-d?
You know how girls on Black Planet be when they get bubbly
At NYU but she hail from Kansas
Right now, she just lampin', chillin' on campus
Sent me a picture with her feelin' on Candice
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis
W-H-I-T, it's getting late, mami
Your screen saver say Tweet, so you got to call me
And bring a friend for my friend, his name Kweli
You mean Talib? Lyrics stick to your rib (I mean)
That's my favorite CD that I play at my crib (I mean)
You don't really know him, why is you lyin'?
Yo Kwe, she don't believe me, please pick up the line
She gon' think that I'm lyin', just spit a couple of lines
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time
And get her high (Yeah), ow
[Verse 3: Talib Kweli & Common]
I can't believe this nigga use my name for pickin' up dimes
But never mind, I need some tracks, you tryin' to pull tracks out
And my rhymes is finna blow, you trying to blow backs out
Well, okay, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm
Ayo, ain't you meet that chick at that conference with your moms?
Her sister the bomb, but she got the bougie behavior
Always got something to say like a OkayPlayer-hater
Anyways, I don't usually fuck with the Internet
Or chicks with birth control stuck to they arm like Nicorette
You really fuckin' that much or tryna get off cigarettes? (Keep 'em high)
If she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet (No)
I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate
I got the Bubba Kush and her sister could get a hit of it, yeah (Yo, yo)

[Verse 4: Common]
Get 'em high like noon or the moon
Or a room filled with smoke, a hype filled with dope
Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune
But I still filled the notes with real nigga quotes
Real rappers is hard to find like a remote
Control, rap is out of
Used to, but still got love
That's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs like Tiger Woods in the hood
Should have my own reality show called ""Soul Survivor""
I stole on live-er niggas than you
You's a bitch, I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me?
They say hip-hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect me
Marsha's too sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
Too many featured emcees, and producers is popular
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin' a
Album, how come you the hot garbage of
The year? It's clear your image is looped up
Label got you souped up, tellin' you you sick
When you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster, chimped up
With a pimp cup, illiterate nigga, read the infra-
Red across your head, I'm bred king like Simba
Bolder than Denver, I ain't a mad rapper
Just a emcee with a temper
You dancin' for money like Honey, I did this my way
So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye
Spittin' through wires and fires, emcees retirin'
Got your hands up, get them motherfuckers higher, then
[Chorus: Kanye West & Common]
N-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands
Get 'em high (Yeah)
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man
Get 'em high (Mm-mm, uh-uh, uh)
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
Keep 'em high (Keep 'em high, keep 'em high, uh-uh)
And if you're losin' your high, then smoke again
Keep 'em high"
Thats That,MF DOOM,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse]
Already woke, spared a joke, barely spoke, rarely smoke
Stared at folks when properly provoked, mirror broke
Here, share a strawberry morning
Gone, an more important spawning, torn in, poor men sworn in
Cornish hens switching positions
Auditioning morticians, saw it in a vision, ignoring prison
Ignoramuses enlist and sound dumb
Found 'em drowned in cow's dung, crowns flung
Rings a Tinkerbell, sing for things that's frail as a fingernail
Bring a scale, stale ginger lingers
Seven figures invigor
Nigga, fresh from out the jail, alpha male
Sickest ninja injury this century, enter plea
Lend sympathy to limper Simple Simon rhymin' emcees
Trees is free, please leave a key
These meager fleas, he's the breeze
And she's the bee's knees for sheez, G's of G's
Seize property, shopper sprees, chop the cheese
Drop degrees to stop diseases, gee-whiz, Pa!
DOOM rock grammar like the kumbaya
Mama was a ho hopper, papa was a rolling stone
Star like Obama, pull a card like oh, drama
Civil liberties
These little titties' abilities riddle me, middle C (Ahhhh!)
Mmm, give a MC a rectal hysterectomy
Lecture on removal of the bowels, foul technically
Don't expect to see the recipe
Until we receive the check as well as the collection fee
More wreck than Section Z, what you expect to get for free?
Shit from me, history
The key, plucked it off the mayor
Chucked it in the ol' tar pit off La Brea, player
They say he's gone too far
DOOM'll catch em after Jumah on cue lacka!
Do whatcha gotta do, grarrrr
The rumors are not true, got two ma
No prob, got the job, hot bod, heartthrob
Scotchguard the bar with cotton swabs, dart lob
Bake a cake, sweet, Jamaica trade in treats on the beach
Make her skeet til her feets meet
[Bridge]
Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did you miss these rhymes when I was gone?
As you listen to these crazy tracks
Check them stats then you know where I'm at
And that's that

[Outro]
Look, there's Doom now!
I followed him to the studio, but I was too late to stop him
That's right! You'll never stop me!
You're dead! You're all dead! Doom!"
Against All Odds,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
To my niggas that went out in line on duty
21-gun salute! One love, one thug, one nation
(Let’s get down, let’s do this!)
21-gun salute! (Come on, yeah, let’s do this!)
21-gun salute!  (Come on, come on, let’s do this!)
All the time I be…

[Hook]
Hopin' my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio gettin' blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke

[Verse 1]
21-gun salute, dressed in fatigues, black jeans and boots
I just appeared in the crowd, all you seen was troops
This little nigga named Nas think he live like me
Talking 'bout he left the hospital, took five like me
You live in fantasies, nigga, I reject your deposit
We shook Dre punk ass, now he out of the closet
Mobb Deep wonder why a nigga blowed 'em out
Next time grown folks talking, nigga close your mouth!
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
Done seen too many real players fall
To let these bitch niggas beat me
Puffy, let's be honest: you a punk or you will see me with gloves?
Remember that shit you said to Vibe about me bein' a thug?
And you can tell the people you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's goin' on
Payback, I knew you bitch niggas from way back
Witness me strapped with MAC's, knew I wouldn't play that
All you old rappers tryin' to advance
It's all over now, take it like a man
Niggas lookin' like Larry Holmes (look at De La Soul!)
Flabby and sick
Tryin' to player hate on my shit, you eat a fat dick
Let it be known, this is how you made me
Lovin' how I got you niggas crazy

Against all odds, up in the studio, gettin' blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke
Against all odds, hopin' my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote

[Verse 2]
I heard he was light-skinned, stocky, with a Haitian accent
Jewelry, fast cars and he's known for flashin'
Listen while I take you back and lace this rap
A real live tale about a snitch named Haitian Jack
Knew he was workin' for the feds
Same crime, different trials, nigga, picture what he said
And did I mention?
Promised to payback, Jimmy Henchman, in due time
I know you bitch niggas is listenin', the world is mine
Set me up, wet me up, niggas stuck me up
Heard the guns bust, but you tricks never shut me up
Touch one of mine, on everything I love
I'll destroy everything you touch
Play the game, nigga; all out warfare, eye for eye
Last words to a bitch nigga: ""Why you lie?""
Now you gotta watch your back, now watch your front
Here we come, gunshots to Tut, now you stuck
Fuck the rap game, nigga, this M.O.B
So believe me, we enemies, I go against all odds

Against all odds, up in the studio, gettin' blowed

This be the realest shit I ever wrote; against all odds

[Verse 3]
Puffy gettin' bribed like a bitch, to hide that fact
He did some shit he shouldn't have did, so we ridin' for that
And that nigga that was down for me, restin' dead
Switched sides, guess his new friends wanted him dead
Probably be murdered for the shit that I said
I bring the real, be a legend, breathin' or dead
Lord, listen to me, God don't like ugly, it was written
Ayo, Nas, your whole damn style is bitten
You heard my melody (This nigga sounds like Rakim!)
Read about my life in the papers
All my run-ins with authorities, felonious capers
Now you wanna live my life
So what's a ""chazzer,"" Nas? Niggas that don't rhyme right
You've seen too many movies
Load 'em up against the wall, close his eyes
Since you lie you die — goodbye!
Let the real live niggas hear the truth from me
What would you do if you was me? Nigga

To the truest shit I ever spoke; against all odds

21-gun salute, one love to my true thug niggas
(Outlaw! Outlaw! Outlaw!)
21-gun salute to my niggas that die in the line of duty
Representin' to the fullest, bein' soldiers with military minds
That play the rules of the game, 21-gun salute
I salute you, my niggas, stay strong
I ride for you, I rhyme for you, I roll for you, it's all for you
To all you bitch-made niggas, I'm comin' for you
Against all odds, I don't care who the fuck you is
You touch me, I'm at you
I know you motherfuckers didn't think I forgot
Hell nah, I ain't forgot, nigga
I just remember what you told me
You said don't go to war unless I got my money right
I got my money right now, now I want war"
As the World Turns,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus]
(I don't know) Yes, man
(Why this world keeps turning) As the world turns
('Round and 'round) We all experience things in life
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
Trials and tribulations
(I don't know) That we all must go through
(Why this world keeps turning) When someone wants to test us
('Round and 'round) When someone tries our patience
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)

[Verse 1]
I hang with a bunch of hippies and wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches and light up like jack-o-lanterns
Outsidaz, baby, and we suin' the courts
'Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source
Yo, they never should've booted me outta reform school (Uh-uh)
Deformed fool, takin' a shit in the warm pool
'Til they threw me out the Ramada Inn
I said, ""It wasn't me, I got a twin""
Oh my God, it's you, not again (Ahh)
It all started when my mother took my bike away
'Cause I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
After that, it was straight to the 40 ouncers
Slappin' teachers and jackin' off in front of my counselors
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
Fuck the next lesson, I'll pass the test guessin'
And all the other kids said, ""Eminem is a thizz head
He'll never last, the only class he'll ever pass is Phys Ed""
Maybe true, 'til I told this bitch in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps, she need a Slim Fast
(Who, me?) Yeah, bitch, you so big
You walked into Vic Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig
(Well, I have never)
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in a headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
(Wait, wait, wait, wait)
I felt the evilness and started transformin' (Rrrahh)
It began stormin', I heard a bunch of cheerin' fans swarmin'
Grabbed that bitch by her hair, drug her across the ground (Come here, bitch)
And took her up to the highest divin' board and tossed her down
Sorry coach, it's too late to tell me stop
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly-flop
[Chorus]
('Cause I don't know) As the world turns
(Why this world keeps turning) These are the days of our lives
('Round and 'round) These are the things that we must go through
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now) Day by day

[Verse 2]
We drive around in million-dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
Outsidaz, and we suin' the courts
'Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source (Yo)
Hypochondriac, hangin' out at the laundromat
Where all the raunchy, fat, white-trashy blondes be at
Dressed like a sailor, standin' by a pail of garbage
It's almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailer park bitch
I met a slut and said, ""What up? It's nice to meet ya"" (Hi)
""I'd like to treat you to a Faygo and a slice of pizza
But I'm broke as fuck
And I don't get paid 'til the first of next month (Sorry)
But if you'd care to join me, I was about to roll this next blunt
But I ain't got no weed, no Phillies or no papers
Plus, I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
So give me all your money and don't try nothin' funny
'Cause you know your stinking ass is too fat to try to outrun me""
I went to grab my gun, that's when her ass put it on me (Stop)
With an uppercut, hit me with a basket of laundry (Ooh)
I fell through the glass doors, started causin' a scene
Slid across the floor and flew right into a washin' machine
Jumped up with a broken back, thank God I was smokin' crack
All day, and doped up on coke and smack
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
Now I wanna kill her, but yo, I gotta catch her first
Ran through Rally's parkin' lot and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in and shot her fuckin' porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
Looked around the room
That's when I seen her bedroom door shut
""I know you're in there, bitch, I got my gun cocked
You might as well come out now""
She said, ""Come in, it's unlocked""
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked, watchin' gay porn
She said, ""Come here, big boy, let's get acquainted""
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
She came at me at full speed, nothin' could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
I started to beg, ""No, please let go""
But she swallowed my fuckin' leg whole like an egg roll
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
Just tryna buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick
Duh-dah-duh-dah-duh-duh, go-go gadget dick
Whipped that shit out, and ain't no doubt about it
It hit the ground, caused an earthquake and power outage
I shouted, ""Now, bitch, let's see who gets the best""
Stuffed that shit in, crooked and fucked that fat slut to death
Ow, ow (Come here, bitch)
Ow, ahh (Come here, take this mothafuckin' dick, bitch, come here)
[Chorus]
('Cause I don't know) And as we go along
(Why this world keeps turning) Throughout the days of our lives
('Round and 'round)
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
We all face small obstacles
(I don't know) And challenges everyday
(Why this world keeps turning) That we must go through
('Round and 'round) These are the things
That surround us through our atmosphere
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
(I don't know) Every day
(Why this world keeps turning) Every single day the world keeps turning
('Round and 'round) Keeps turning
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now) Keeps turning
(I don't know why this world keeps turning)"

Yo can't hine yeah

Here we Gooo
The 1st time around
I left the cars at the house
And I put the diamonds down
Them things come and they go it's bout the rhyme-in Now
I'm seeing it clearer, the season is nearer
And still I must change, I'm like a broken bill
Conservative for the most but I'm out spoken still
They not sure it'll work but their all hoping
He'll emerge the victim, my words are pictures
And yes the colors so loud that you heard my scripture
With four walls
Give me the right brush and I draw all
I promise I been thinkin' before ya'll
I barely get tired, I'm rarely inspired
And you accomplish in a week is What I'm daily required
I'm meetin' quotas while you rappers having sleep overs
Spending nights in studio try to be Hova
Be in the throne instead of being ya own
But look
[Hook:]
Young Check your freestyle
I am fast approachin' on the weekend
It's me, Niko, Bryans here, D10
Freestyle shit bout to segway to the verse here we go

[Verse 2:]
It's like I'm makin' moves in my city though
My ex girls wanna be up in the video
They ex girls are steady tryin' to get with me though
Important and vital
I'm caught in a cycle
And this is all I know
And yes I know it well
I try to explain
And my effort comes to no avail
I'm from the place where they release records and no one sells
And still they claim king
Nigga it's the same thing
All day long
But that's the screw face
Rappers will friend you at first but really they two faced
Hoping you trip and slip over your own shoe lace
That's why I tuck em in not givin' a fuck again
D.R.A you add the K.E a hundred grand and you labels can not
Play me
I'll never go broke
Fuck em I'm flashin' the pan
I am a passionate man
Planted with cash in my hand uhh
[Verse 3:]
Look... I got few days left
And I'm a make use of every single one
Untill every singles done and till every record is sold
And till every string is strung
They tell me to take a breather and Drake everything will come
Dog... it's always been the same
It's all love
Like no score in a tennis game
For the son of Dennis James
Owner of the city downtown on a Friday
Streets behind me like I took a picture in a driveway
I roll down strips and hosed down whips that when turtles wax up
They will close down richmond
With no down shiftin'
Haters will say I'm adequate
I think I got the type of flow to make a addict quit
19 years I been pimpin' since then repurchased Trap Muzik 4 time since then
Seamless transition I'm the new fresh prince gettin' pennies for my thoughts
So I put my 2 cents in
Top of the mornin' I am dropin' a coin in plus
I'm changin' the game you see me swapin' a joint in
They put fire out bring the buyers out and try to box us all together
For they buy us out
They profit from the event
We handin' fliers out
We profit from the attempt to hand desires out
But rich is how we're all endin' up
So if you selling charter Jetts call Brenden up
Holla!"
Hold it Down,Big Daddy Kane,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Big Daddy Kane]

[Intro: Big Daddy Kane]
Something about the things that we do
To make it funky for you
And as you listen to the rhyme
You'll see that it just gets better with time

[Verse 1: Big Daddy Kane]
Rappers stepped to me, but they didn't get none
I'm the Kane so you know the outcome
The microphone crooner, should have set the tone sooner
Hip hop to me is like boxing to Roy Jones Junior
The genuine, search and you'll find
That on the microphone I can handle mine
Here's a view to a kill as I flipped the skill
When it's time to rock the mic like Al Skratch, I get ill
I come equipped to fight and if I flip tonight
Effects on emcees are similar to kryptonite
The water flows that be hard to distinguish
It's best to relinquish, you don't want the God to bring this
I'm marvelous at the art of this
Even if you got assist, stepping to me is a lot of risk
I release skills that's abundant
To explode and drop on you like Flight 800, what
[Hook: Kelly German]
Keep it moving, world renown
Showing and proving, that we can hold it down
Keep it moving, world renown
Showing and proving, that we can hold it down

[Verse 2: Big Daddy Kane]
Here's a percentage of that old vintage
Macaroni flow but its more than an image
Don't let the smooth taste fool ya, let me school ya
On what it is, straight up, square biz
Swift maneuvering to crush the crew you bring
Last thing them want tell me is Kane go do your thing
Who the king? Asiatic non-equivalent to any
Plus I play the game a more harder way than Penny
The plan that I mobilize for dough to rise is no surprise
That it comes from what I vocalize
I'm the best you can get as I hit you with
The stroke of death, and I ain't even broke a sweat
But this is where I draw the line, you're sure to find
Lyrics I be dropping is too much for the mortal mind
What's being caused is many emcees I'm seeing lost
The hip hop laws should be reinforced
You made a record this year, oh you're hot?
Something fishy about your style, who flow you got?
You thought that you could hold me down? No, you're not
Now back up off me, here I come to blow the spot
[Hook: Kelly German]
Keep it moving, world renown
Showing and proving, that we can hold it down
Keep it moving, world renown
Showing and proving, that we can hold it down

[Verse 3: Big Daddy Kane]
Alright, here I come to get some
But instead, you don't want the love to spread
I heard that jealousy and envy is a dumb one's tool
So Daddy says nothing, he keeps his cool
I been through your tribulations and conflicts
Anything possible to keep me out the mix
But ease back, boy you better freeze that
Where my rivalries lack, I'm still nice with these Black
I rap with the safety cap so that you don't get it twisted
And be another statistic
How many more to try is sure to die
Slaughter I, all that playa-hating only makes me fortify
To get the papers to me is a necessity
And I don't want a piece of the pie, I want the recipe
I can't lose with what I use
I'm the reason why the lady sings the blues, don't get it confused

[Hook: Kelly German]
Keep it moving, world renown
Showing and proving, that we can hold it down
Keep it moving, world renown
Showing and proving, that we can hold it down
[Outro: Big Daddy Kane]
Hold it down, baby, hold it down
Hold it down, baby, hold it down
Hold it down, baby, hold it down
Uh, uh, uh, uh"
La-La-Land,Big Daddy Kane,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Don't you know it ain't what you got y'all it's how you use it
Any way you choose it, baby, yes I doos it
Laying it out with swift vocabulary
I hope you hear me, here comes the Brooklyn theory
At your service, got you shook and nervous
Now, what you gonna do when Black Caesar comes to surface
My purpose is making sure you bless me right
So I can climb aboard that money train with Wesley Snipes
Daddy love how I get down ain't no secret
And every night, my backyard is just like the freaknik
What you mean from hot sexy mamas to cool prima donna's
Easy pickings on the chickens got them up in the camp
It's that old tramp, the one who keep your pum pum's damp
I see the honeys in the frontier looking for what you want dear
Yes, there's a lot of game run here

[Chorus]
All the playas in the game
Another year
And ain't a damn thing changed
We get together and we do our thing
Repeat
[Verse 2]
On stage at arenas or a show in the park
I shine so bright my black ass glow in the dark
If you're ready or not, if you're petty or hot
Here comes the reign of Kane about to get in your spot
Your tough talk's monotonous, beware as I be droppin' this
Lyrical apocalypse all through your metropolis
Sexual Chocolate the velvet smooth voice
That be the people's choice and get the girls moist
No time for timid fear, cause there ain't no limits here
Got the world in my hands you ain't even found the hemisphere
It's real scary how rap skills vary bringin' dollar bills near me
Making dough rise like Pillsbury
Now get this it's time we start stepping to our business
I come as living proof so bear witness
Not to contradict myself but see really
I'm untouchable but making sure you people feel me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I talk that talk from the gutter my game don't stutter
I can tell you why white milk be making yellow butter
Some cats, they be shifty, some cats they be iffy
So I move swiftly, play the field like Ken Griffey
Because, I be the all mighty, relax like Tai Chi
Making it irie
I flow over tracks when the beats are mean
Girls I go downtown when the streets are clean
Make it happen all my peoples
More chips than Doritos I know we all trying to see those
So I return to give you more again
Because my name dates back until the game's origin
See what the fact is, is you need practice
With girls I just mack this, stick em in just like cactus
Watch me now, baby it's all right
I got bunions on my game from it being too tight
[Chorus]"
Terra N Ya Era,Big Daddy Kane,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","You looking in the mouth of madness, skilled out since I had this
I'm talking bout nothing but pure D badness
My acceleration is compatible to a bima
My pockets looking greener, from the funky cold medina
Don't tell me bout the things that you done did cause I done did it
Don't tell me bout the skins that you done hit, cause I done hit it
And once I rock these, with a style that's cock deis
Good God, I get the crowd together like knock knees
Now, I don't act hard, I just mack hard
Baggin' video looking honeys with the big back yard
Yes lord, girls I'm gamin' leaving the microphone flamin'
Throwing up hip-hop signs cause that's the set that I be claimin'
Guerilla war fares for those who love to pull your card
Grimies from Fort Green to Malcolm X Boulevard
Now, if that's what you're hoping then it's the wrong things you're scopin'
I may not rap bout slittin no throats but trust me kid I'll get you open

Verse 2
Here comes a taste of the rawness, like you never saw this
Once I grip the cordless, my victory is flawless
Chaos and havoc, lyrically psychopathic
At times get pornographic, lord man I gots to have it
Then I commit to hit you with this composite that's ultimate
Too legit splendid come get wit' it for your comfort
But then sloppily, rappers try to copy me
Take pieces of my property, and use it all unproperly
And probably, been focusing a while to copy my style
But child what I'll compile is too versatile
I'm too superior, it's sort of like comparing a
Spanking new Desert Eagle to a rusty little derringer
But skip the tool, let's try to deal here with the jewel
That I'm droppin on you, now let me take you all to school
You see, to graduate in hip-hop you must be smart
And no you don't have to know how to paint to make your rhymes a form of art
Poetry and literature is what makes this English fanatic
Now dig this, I drop science but still deal with mathematics
And since I don't be dealing with what's considered a mystery
I learned the dead presidents to pass American History
Got my degree in rapology
Hip-hop had to set me free, look mom, a real emcee
So you want yours now, well don't get caught with your drawers down
Cause word life, this industry is half corrupt just like the Dogg Pound
Verse 3
Rap godfather
Oh goodness gracious, you better make it spacious
For the vivacious, ostentatious, who feel courageous?
I put it on them using my tongue as a sword
But at times get broader than broad for those who insist to get floored
Whatever it takes to see your nerve gone, and word born
Black Caesar gonna get his swerve on
My name should be referred to in medical terms
Cause I get way up in the cut and I'm talking way worse than germs
You like to chase it playin catch like Tom & Jerry
But on the contrary, I'd rather sip the Dom Peri
Lay back in harmony, because it's so bizarre to see
That all the hard core rappers are slowly turning R&B
Well pardon me, you contradict yo'self, I see you not perfect yo'self
You like that type music yo'self, stick yo'self
What happened to black men of pride 'nuff men have died
Nowadays what's been applied, in hip-hop is genocide
That's when the rappers go get the clappers
Can't you see they trying to strap us just to trap us, good god it's backwards
One nation under a groove, that's how we move
It's time to teach the youth get it together show and prove
Me no run with the gun or speak of none for action
When you get done scream I'm the one, it looks like an illusion
I deal with equality so never call my brethren son
Yes mon, me got mad flava just like jerk chicken"
Do U Really Know?,Big Daddy Kane,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Kane talking]
Here's a little food for thought
As I tell it, cause if it happened to this cat
Then it can happen to you
Do the knowledge

[Verse 1]
I was sittin' outside double parked after dark
I think it was the corner of Nostrand and St. Mark
That's when this stray cat walked up to me
Now I was sure he would be
But you woulda thought he'd know me
Tellin' his life story to me
He said 'Yo Kane', since way back in his life
Days of Rappers Delight, yo he was after the hype
He rocked the Kangols, Adidas when Run and them had that spot
When I came out, he had a flat-top
And when Naughty came out, a couple years ago
He even tried the braids up in his hair, but they ain't hear him tho
Vexed and down, you know next he found
Heavy D was blowing up, so then he tried to gain extra pounds
No thanks to that, they ranked him wack
Only thing that's left to do, was to go gangsta rap
So now he rhyme about the keys being sold
The G's being fold, the trees being rolled
Now sure he should, he started acting like he from the hood
Talking thug game and had his record sales doing good
And so now, you on the road to riches
Referring to the womankind as hoes and bitches
Yeah, you the man now because you rap different
But you got your 7 year old daughter listenin'
The twist begin
When that the image you projecting
It starts to reflecting on your shorty cause she checking
[Chorus X2]
Do you really know
What's the path that you really need to go
And what example you really need to show
The good rep or the hood rep
While she's walking in her father's footsteps

[Verse 2]
It be that excess drama, wonder rhymer
That could make one rapper, convert to, gun clapper
That acting buckwild, boy you know that ain't your style
Plus your thug profile is now reflecting on your child
You thinking that it couldn't happen
But then it happen
And now you're rappin, came back to haunt you
Because you want to
Be in her face puffin' li with your crew
You even let her take a sip or two upon your brew
Instead of tryin to shed light, to keep her head right
So that she wouldn't do the things that the next kid might
Oh now you never did consider tho
Your kid could go
Trying to do the things she saw you do up in your video
You went upstairs thinking that she wasn't able
Slipping, left your Glock sittin' pon the coffee table
So as you hang, with your gang, doin your thang
BLOWE! unexpectedly to your ears the shot rang
Came down, never thinking that you'd see what you saw
Right there, layin in blood across your livin room floor
So now, as you sit in grief, total disbelief
Cause everything that ever mattered
To you is all shattered
Instead of concentratin' heavily on what your rep be
You should have been thankful for your child like Cheryl Pepsi
Cause if you would have stayed aware
To whose in your care
She wouldn't be no casualty to your career""
[Chorus X2]

[Verse 3]
Where did they find you?
You came into this game and let this new trend blind ya
A&R's was wrong to sign ya
You gotta be true to this game to stay in the art
But guys like you get bent apart
Because you ain't got it in the heart
Representing who? you better not be getting new
How you gonna be guerilla when you never been up in the zoo
Your whole persona's theatrical
Ain't nothing bout you natural
Here, show me now, how many gats you pull
Cause when you talk that talk
You gotta walk that walk
Or leave it up to the real OG's up North
Cause those who dramatize, realize, and be advised
You couldn't handle 3 to 5
Cause many seeking fortune and fame
Got caught in the game
Thinking the thug status was supporting the claim
All you gangsta acts y'all be guerillas on tracks
But relax, cause this is just wax
Tell em again
You gangsta acts be guerillas on tracks
But relax, cause this is just wax
One more time
Y'all gangsta acts y'all be guerillas on tracks
But relax, this just wax, nigga, damn

Take me away from the hood, in a casket or a Bentley
Take me away, like I overdosed on cocaine
Or take me away like a bullet from Kurt Cobain, suicide

From a block close to where Biggie was crucified
That was Brooklyn's Jesus, shot for no fuckin' reason
And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces?
‘Cause that's Jesus, people – and Game, he's the equal
Hated on so much, Passion of Christ need a sequel

Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile
Damn, I know his mama proud; and since you helped me sell my dream, we can share my mama now
And like M.J.B. no more drama now
Livin' the good life, me and Common on common ground

Made my grandmother pray for good
It never made her happy, but I bet that new Mercedes could
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood
And it took so many of my niggas that I should hate the hood
But it's real niggas like me that make the hood
Ridin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should

Let no amount of money ruin this thing of ours (Uh)

We collidin' with life as we speak
We knee-deep in coke, we key-deep in ice
We flood streets with dope, we keep weed to smoke
We all fish, better teach your folk
Give him money to eat, the next week, he's broke

Word on the street, you reap what you sow
Not out of fear, but love, love for the game
Roc family first, we never change, man

Knocked a nigga off his feet, but I crawled back

That's the ritual (Yup), Big Ran, I ain't forget you, fool
And all that bullshit you tryin' to get through
This is crew love, move music or move drugs
Rival crews, get your black suits up, I'll never change
[Chorus: Kanye West & JAY-Z]
Never, never, never, never change
I'm still fuckin' with crime, 'cause crime pays (I never change, c'mon)
Out hustlin', same clothes for days (I never change)
I never change, I'm too stuck in my ways, I'll never change
Who you know? (Never, never, never, never change)
I'm still fuckin' with crime, 'cause crime pays (I never change)
Out hustlin', same clothes for days (I never change, c'mon)
I never change, I'm too stuck in my ways, I'll never change

This is Jay every day

Toss It Up,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Segue from ""Hail Mary""]

[Intro: 2Pac]
The money behind the dreams
My right hand, my other Capo in this big motherfuckin' war we got
My other Capo in this big-ass
Conglomerate called Death Row
Snoop motherfuckin Dogg, Tha Doggfather
And who we hear comin' through right now?
Makaveli the Don
Feel this, Killuminati

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Lord have mercy, father help us all
Since you supplied your phone number, I can't help but call
Time for action, conversating, we relaxing, kicking back
Got you curious for thug passion, now picture that
Tongue-kissing, hand full of hair, look in my eyes
Time to make the bed rock, baby look how it rise
Me and you moving in the nude, do it in the living room
Sweating up the sheets, it's the Thug in me
I mean no disrespecting when I tongue-kiss your neck
I go a long way to get you wet, what you expect?
Late night, hit the highway, drop the top
I pull over, getting busy in the parking lot
And don't you love it how I lick your hips and glide?
Kiss you soft on your stomach, push my love inside
Got you lost in a love zone, stuck in the lust
I got the bedroom shaking, back-breaking
When we're tossing it up
[Verse 2: Danny Boy & Jojo]
Feel this baby, I like the way it's going down
When nobody's around, slip-slide ride
Giving me that nice smile
The thing I like, what I want to give all night
You and me alone, everybody's gone, toss it up
Baby let's get it on!
I like the way you please me, baby
The sexy way you tease me, shorty
The way you move your body
It really drives me crazy
Your body's hypnotizing, your smell is so exciting
So baby come on home with me
I like the way you give it to me, baby

[Chorus: Danny Boy & JoJo]
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up

[Post-Chorus: Danny Boy & JoJo]
Play on, play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on, play on
[Verse 3: K-Ci & Aaron Hall]
Oh, it's K-Ci baby, mmm, that want you lady
Oh, don't act so shady
Baby, your taste as fine as gravy
The way you move that thing
You make me wanna sing
Girl, you make my bells ring
Make them go ting-a-ling!
Nasty man, I'm here again
Don't want it to ever end
It's feeling too good
Gimme some more, oh lady, lady
Your body the kind I like, a
Big booty, titillating delight
Back it up, yo, let me in there
Toss it up for me

[Chorus: K-Ci & Aaron Hall]
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
So won't you play on
[Verse 4: 2Pac]
How do you want it? What's your phone number? I get around
Cali Love to my true Thugs, picture me now
Still down for that Death Row sound, searchin' for paydays
No longer Dre Day: arrivederci!
Blown and forgotten, rotten for plotting child's play
Check your sexuality, as fruity as this Alizé
Quick to jump ship, punk trick, what a dumb move
Cross Death Row, now who you gonna run to?
Laugh at you suckers 'cause you similar
Pretending to be hard, oh my God, check your temperature
Screaming ""Compton"", but you can't return, you ain't heard?
Brothers pissed 'cause you switched and escaped to the burbs
Mob on to this new era, 'cause we untouchable
Still can't believe that you got 'Pac rushing you
Up in you, bless the real, all the rest get killed
Who can you trust? Only time reveals
Toss it up

[Outro: 2Pac, K-Ci & Aaron Hall]
On and on, yeah, and on
Let me see you toss it up (Toss it up)
Won't you toss it up (Yeah, no doubt)
Won't you toss it up, yeah (Let me see you toss it up)
Play on player, play on
Yeah (Let me see you toss it up)
Let me see you toss it up
How can some non-players do a song about tossing it up
And then want to do a player song?
(You so fat, you and Lil' Kim need a weight scale to lay down in bed
We are not little kids, you fat ass, you feelin' threatened)
How can non-players do it? (You know who I'm talking bout)
Teddy Riley, who? Puffy? who?
Puffy, I read your little interview buddy, c'mon
You still ain't touching us, all that peace talk
I don't care if you kiss my ass from here to across the street, boy
It's on! Toss it up, we took you on
And we took y'all beat (Toss it up)
You know who beat we took, and we took y'all beat
'Cause you wasn't rocking it right! (Toss it up now)
Tired of suckers rocking beats that don't belong to them, toss it up, it's on, it's out there now, it's our beat now
Yeah, toss it up now!"
Get By,Talib Kweli,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Kanye West]

[Verse 1]
Yeah
We sell crack to our own out the back of our homes
We smell the musk of the dusk and the crack of the dawn
We go through episodes too/two, like Attack of the Clones
Work 'til we break our back, and you hear the crack of the bones
(Just to get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by)
We commute to computers
Spirits stay mute while your egos spread rumors
We survivalists turned to consumers
(Just to get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by)
Ask Him why some people gotta live in a trailer, cuss like a sailor
I paint a picture with the pen like Norman Mailer
Mi abuela raised three daughters all by herself with no help
I think about her struggle and I find the strength in myself
These words melt in my mouth, they hot like a jail cell in the South
Before my nigga Cor' bailed me out
(To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by)
We do or die like Bed-Stuy
See the red sky through the window of the red-eye
Let the lead fly — some G. Rap shit, Livin' to Let Die
[Hook]
This morning, I woke up
Feelin' brand new, I jumped up
Feelin' my highs and my lows and my soul
And my goal's just to stop smokin' and stop drinkin'
And I've been thinkin' — I've got my reasons
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
By, by-by-by-by, by-by-by-by
By-by-by-by, by-by-by-by
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
By, by-by-by-by, by-by-by-by
By-by-by-by, by-by-by-by
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
We keep it gangsta
Say ""Fo' shizzle"", ""Fo' sheezy"" and stayin' crunk
It's easy to pull a breezy, smoke trees and we stayin' drunk
Yo, our activism attackin' the system
The Blacks and Latins in prison
Numbers have risen, they victims lackin' the vision
Shit, and all they got is rappin' to listen to
I let 'em know we missin' you, the love is unconditional
Even when the condition is critical, when the livin' is miserable
Your position is pivotal — I ain't bullshittin' you!
Now, why would I lie? Just to get by?
Just to get by, we get fly
The TV got us reachin' for stars
Not the ones between Venus and Mars
The ones that be readin' for parts
Some people get breast enhancements and penis enlargers
Saturday sinners — Sunday morning at the feet of the Father
They need somethin' to rely on
We get high on all types of drug, when all you really need is love
(To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by)
Our parents sing like John Lennon — imagine all the people watch
We rock like Paul McCartney, from now until the last Beatle drop
[Hook]
This morning, I woke up
Feelin' brand new, I jumped up
Feelin' my highs and my lows and my soul
And my goal's just to stop smokin' and stop drinkin'
And I've been thinkin' — I've got my reasons
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by

[Outro]
Yo-yo-yo, yo, yo
Some people cry, and some people try
Just to get by, for a piece of the pie
We love to eat and get high
We deceive and we lie, and we keepin' it fly
Y-y-y-yo, yo
When the people decide to keep a disguise
Can't see they eyes, see the evil inside
But there's people you find
Strong or feeble in mind, I stay readin' the signs
Y-y-y-yo, yo, yo
Some people cry, and some people try
Just to get by, for a piece of the pie
We love to eat and get high
We deceive and we lie, and we keepin' it fly
Y-y-y-yo, yo
When the people decide to keep a disguise
Can't see they eyes, see the evil inside
But there's people you find
Strong or feeble in mind, I stay readin' the signs
Y-y-y-yo, yo

The 4th Branch,Immortal Technique,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
The new age is upon us
And yet the past refuses to rest in its shallow grave
For those who hide behind the false image of the son of man
Shall stand before God (God, God, God, God, God, God, God)
It has begun, the beginning of the end
Yeah ... yeah ... yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
The voice of racism preaching the gospel is devilish
A fake church called the prophet Muhammad a terrorist
Forgetting God is not religion, but a spiritual bond
And Jesus is the most quoted prophet in the Qu'ran
They bombed innocent people, tryna murder Saddam
When you gave him those chemical weapons to go to war with Iran
This is the information that they hold back from Peter Jennings
'Cause Condoleeza Rice is just a new age Sally Hemings
I break it down with critical language and spiritual anguish
The Judas I hang with, the guilt of betraying Christ
You murdered him, stole his religion, and painted him white
Translated in psychologically tainted philosophy
Conservative political right-wing ideology
Glued together sloppily, the blasphemy of a nation
Got my back to the wall 'cause I'm facin' assassination
Guantanamo Bay, federal incarceration
How could this be the land of the free, home of the brave
Indigenous holocaust, and the home of the slaves?
Corporate America dancin' offbeat to the rhythm
You really think this country never sponsored terrorism?
Human rights violations, we continue the saga
El Savador and the Contras in Nicaragua
And on top of that, you still want to take me to prison
Just 'cause I won't trade humanity for patriotism
[Chorus]
It's like MKUltra, controllin' your brain
Suggestive thinkin’, causin’ your perspective to change
They want to rearrange the whole point of view of the ghetto
The fourth branch of the government want us to settle
A bandanna full of glittering generality
Fightin' for freedom and fightin' terror, but what's reality?
Read about the history of the place that we live in
And stop letting corporate news tell lies to your children

[Verse 2]
Flow like the blood of Abraham through the Jews and the Arabs
Broken apart like a woman's heart, abused in a marriage
The brink of holy war, bottled up like a miscarriage
Embedded correspondents don't tell the source of the tension
And they refuse to even mention European intervention
Or the massacres in Jenin, the innocent screams
US-manufactured missiles and M16s
Weapon contracts and corrupted American dreams
Media censorship blockin’ out the video screens
A continent of oil kingdoms bought for a bargain
Democracy is just a word when the people are starvin'
The average citizen made to be blind to the reason
A desert full of genocide where the bodies are freezin'
And the world doesn't believe that you fightin' for freedom
'Cause you fucked the Middle East and gave birth to a demon
It's open season with the CIA buggin' my crib
Trapped in a ghetto region like a Palestinian kid
Where nobody gives a fuck whether you die or you live
I'm tryna give the truth and I know the price is my life
But when I'm gone they'll sing a song about Immortal Technique
Who beheaded the president and the princes and sheiks
You don't give a fuck about us, I can see through your facade
Like a fallen angel standing in the presence of God
Bitch niggas scared of the truth when it looks at you hard
[Chorus]
It's like MKUltra, controllin' your brain
Suggestive thinkin’, causin’ your perspective to change
They want to rearrange the whole point of view of the ghetto
The fourth branch of the government want us to settle
A bandanna full of glittering generality
Fightin' for freedom and fightin' terror, but what's reality?
Martial law is coming soon to the hood to kill you
While you hangin’ your flag out your project window

[Outro]
Yeah
The fourth branch of the government AKA the media
Seems to now have a retirement plan for ex-military officials
As if their opinion was at all unbiased
A machine shouldn't speak for men
So shut the fuck up, you mindless drone
And you know it's serious
When these same media outfits are spending millions of dollars on a PR campaign
To try to convince you they're fair and balanced
When they're some of the most ignorant and racist people
Giving that type of mentality a safe haven
We act like we share in the spoils of war that they do
We die in wars, we don't get the contracts to make money off 'em afterwards
We don't get weapons contracts, nigga
We don't get cheap labor for our companies, nigga
We are cheap labor, nigga
Turn off the news and read, nigga ... read
Read... read"
Mighty Healthy,Ghostface Killah,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
My God, so they are killers
I've heard lots of people say once a man's a killer, they just keep on killing and killing
They sort of develop a taste for blood
Yeah, that's right
They kill one man, or kill ten
It's all the same (Yes)
After all, they can only hang you once

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Both hands clusty, chillin' with my man Rusty
Low down, blew off the burner, kinda dusty
The world can't touch Ghost, purple tape, Rae co-host
Monty Hall expo, intellect, you read pro
Son's triflin' fuck, wildflower on the cycle and
Picked up the broom thought I was Michael-in'
West Brighton Pool, now I'm into Iron Duels
Turn nuns to Earths, Whoopi, she at Allah school
Inhale break beats of Hell a-alikes propel parallel
Duracell knot, you flashed a burnt cell
Snap out of Candyland, kids, the old rumor is
Blacks become immune and shit, we never did
Like eating dead birds, trust the pharmacy over herbs
Men marrying men, ill they got the urge, pulsar
Scissor hand wig vanished in the winter, living off land
You god damn right I fuck fans, king me
Check, checkmate, props like the micro chip founder
Neck to neck stock with Bill Gates now
[Bridge: Ghostface Killah]
When we hug these mics we get busy (Busy)
Come and have a good time with G-O-D (G-O-D)
Make you snap your fingers or wiggle (Wiggle)
Scream, shout, laugh or just giggle (Giggle)
Shake that body, party that body
Don't fuck with Ghost, you'll feel sorry
That's word, I'm not the herb
Understand what I'm saying, saying, saying?

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Hit mics like Ted Koppel, rifle expert
Let off the Eiffel, burn a flag in your grass, spiteful
Ringleader set it off, rap Derek Jeter
Culprit, prince of the game, wish you could see us
We lay low, glitter wax full bangles
Priceless ropes, lay around the God, get tangled
Woolly hair, eyes fiery red, feet made of brass
Twelve men following me, it be the God staff
Move, every script's like Miramax
Smashed the big boy, totaled it, Wilshire and Fairfax
Sun beamin', wifey on the beach sipping Zima
Wu 'binos to Latinos, we love Selena
Overnight, God schedules, FedEx
Pretty silhouette, velvet nice, DNA scroll genetics
Too hot to handle, one thought from scrambling the mandolin
Hundred game Wilt Chamberlain, smack 'em, say when
He rollin' up, face wrinkled up, hands is on his nuts
Yo kid, stop fronting on the grounds 'fore you get touched
It's Canada Dry sess with Allah, son
We want rye, we want it so bad we might cry
[Outro]
For every blow, depends on breath control
So it's the first thing you must learn
Fortunately it's easy
You'll soon learn
My God, so they are killers
Killing and killing
They sort of develop a taste for blood
My God, so they are killers
My God— My God, so they are killers"

I stayed late tonight, right?
You know what happen when I stay late, haha
Yeah
Boi-1da!
I swear, it's like this every single time
Toronto, I got you
I got us
Yeah

[Verse 1 - Drake]
I'm a hard guy to get along with, get on a song with
When shit be going right, well, I just flip it to the wrong shit
The team that I belong to, the artists I put on with
Don't ever ask for nothing 'cause them niggas got their own shit
Me and Weezy are like a mouth full of hot peppers
Black Ferrari with the red seats, I call it ""playing checkers""
I'm never doing verses, I'm forever giving lectures
If you trying to meet with money, I'll be happy to connect you
Life is better than it's ever been
Scheduling million-dollar meetings with the president
Someone cut the lights on, where is Thomas Edison?
Got a a new condo, watch me as I settle in
I deserve a MTV show for me and my people
And if you tryna zone, I got a whole Swisher Sweet full
Rappers all liars and they women are deceitful
Add until they subtract me, I'll never be your equal
Last-Place Drizzy is the nigga in the lead now
Weezy told me, ""Just write every single thing you need down""
And he got it for me, and I'm as happy can be now
'Bout to start balling like I'm coming off a rebound
Yeah, and I should have the most bragging rights
Because a nigga spit crack—bag it tight
Hate when rappers say they tryna get their swagger right
'Cause I done came on more fire than a dragon fight
Fuck you, pussy-ass hater, you should do you
You ain't heard of me, then you should go and get a Blue's Clue
Oops! I mean a red clue; Wayne's here, suu whoop
Bet he felt that like the end of a pool cue
But I ain't banging, I ain't waving no flag
I'm ATF, but they ain't seeing no badge
It's Heartbreak Drake, I hate to see 'em so sad
I can son you, see a little me in your dad
I'm the same yellow boy that used to play up on Degrassi
Can pocket 20 thousand to be anywhere they ask me
Cash like Johnny, Banks like Ashley
Burning like a Camel Light; stupid ho, ash me
But don't ask me shit about me
And know the game really ain't shit without me
She might have to pay me, but I dick her down free
Wanna know if it's the truth? Then pull the zipper down and see
(No homo, though)
[Break: Lil Wayne]
Yeah
Um...
I'm going in

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Drizzy, I got us, this is my promise
I'ma bring that barrel to them bitches' eyeliners
And what I make up would fuck up your skin
I pick the buck up and buck-buck, then buck-buck again
I would buttfuck your friend, then suck up her twin
I put the buck up to him
Then buck-buck and buck-buck and buck-buck again
Suck nut, you duck, fuck your unloving kin
Now, don't rub it in
Like Lubriderm on a new tattoo, I had to
Kick my princess up out my castle
Dad, who? Never had that dude, always had a black tool
Even when I was at school, 'cause bullies aren't bulletproof
Red scarf, hoodie too, probably ain't as hood as you
Stupid motherfucker, the only thing in the hood is you
I do everything good as you; no, I do everything better
I get paid for every letter, A-B-C, et cetera
Fetch a bone, like a dog, motherfucker
I am going for your neck in a sec
Intercept, bring it back like work in a trunk
And my exit coming up, yup, I am headed to the buck
Like, buck-buck again! Might fly to L.A. and just fuck Karrine
Nahh, fuck Karrine! Let's get bucks again
And fucking spend them bucks, and then, just fuck Karrine
If I told you, I'ma do it, I did it
Got my city on my fitted, 'bout to pop it, let's get it
Let's get it, motherfucker, what you waiting on?
It is 'bout a minute past pissed and I'm about to get shitted
I'm with it if money is the ""it"" you want me with
And I probably just spit on the chick you want be with
And I hate a bony bitch, only like 'em only thick
And I own hip-hop; if you don't spit, I'm gon' evict
And I just sold a lot of property to a buyer
And I think his name was kinda like ""Drake Drizzy Rogers""
Or ""Drizzy Drake Rogers,"" I'm too busy to play father
And when it comes to the game, I'm too willing to play harder
So harder, I go, there he go
They chant ""MVP"" when I shoot a free throw
C.E.O., Jaz, what it do?
The haters on their face and in their ass is a shoe
Faster than you, badder than you
Radder than you, et cetera
I told you, I get paid by the letter, like:
""A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P-Q-R-S-T-U-V-W-X-Y""
ZZ Top, yes, he rock
And me and Drizzy both wrote on Detox
That was just a footnote; how long can he could go?
Wondering when he stop? Bitch, when the beat stop
So I'ma keep rocking 'til the sheet rock bend
Then, the heat I send burn skin

[Verse 1: Big L]
The Big L be lightin' niggas like incense, gettin' men lynched
And when tensed, I'm killin' infants for ten cents
'Cause I'm a street genius with a unique penis
Got fly chicks on my dick that don't even speak English
I'm makin' ducks shed much tears, I buck queers
I don't have it all upstairs, but who the fuck cares?!
I'm grabbin' brews, takin' fast swiggas
I get cash and stash figures and harass them bitch-ass niggas
After you, your man'll get scarred next
And if your squad flex, I'm lettin' off like Bernard Goetz
A TEC-9 is my utensil
Fillin' niggas with so much lead, they can use they dick for a pencil
I'm known for snatchin' purses and bombin' churches
I get more pussy by accident than most niggas get on purpose
I got drug spots from New York to Canada
'Cause Big L be fuckin' with more keys than a janitor
[Verse 2: Lord Finesse]
Now, it's the dictator whose style's greater
It's the man with more wild flavors than motherfuckin' Now & Laters
And rappers I hit 'em well
They automatically go to heaven fuckin' with me 'cause I give 'em hell
So don't try to front, troop
When your style is played out just like an Oshkosh jumpsuit
I'm out to collect figures
I'm on some Wu-Tang shit, so protect your fuckin' neck, nigga
Not a role model, I'm a bad figure
When it comes to rap, I got skills out the ass, nigga!
I got it locked like a warden
Rap without Finesse is like the NBA without Jordan
So all you new jacks kickin' wack raps
It's a fact that I'll be on your fuckin' back like a knapsack
It ain't shit you can tell me
Because bitches still jel' me without a motherfuckin' LP

Yo, I got a death wish
That's why I talk so much fuckin' shit
I want these bitch motherfuckers to try to flip
So I can fill up this clip
And stick the gun between they lips like a cigarette
And let 'em smoke the four-fifth
Ah fool, ah goodbye, no need to try to lie or cry
It's time for motherfuckers to die
Because to me death is like sex
And if my brain was a deck of cards, I'd be missin' a whole deck
Strap up a MAC, clack, clack, motherfuckers are runnin' like rats
The blind bats are fuckin' crazed cats
'Cause the Microphone Nut's loose
And you're wonderin' how the fuck did this madman get cut loose
From 25 consecutive 25-to-life bids
For murderin' up some fuckin' white kids
These were the kids of the prison guards
Then I startin' killin' squads of prison guards in the prison yard
One-two, everybody's through
The Microphone Nut flew over the prison walls without a clue
And now I'm back to haunt shit and talk shit
Whoever flaunt shit, I leave 'em unconscious
I run through ya with a maneuver and German luger
Wreck like Das EFX straight out the fuckin' sewer
Please show me where the crack is at
While they quarter crack the sack I crack they backs like Cracker Jacks
So I'm the one you should run from
Because the Microphone Nut is like a motherfuckin' stun gun

The way I rock, no way you could stop
I stop, pop and drop when Jay gets hot
When I'm in the zone, better hold ya own
'Cause I like to break when I finish a poem
Pound for p-p-pound the best around
No way you can get up when I get down
I shake, rattle and roll and wreck shit like none
And beat a nigga ass half silly on the one
Fuckin' A, fuckin' Jay, ill with skill
So ladies, step up, I get around like a wheel
I'm never chokin' off chronic, skills are bionic
Bitches are screamin' like Onyx
Respect that I'll peel a punks cap back and sign it
Creep through your block, fuck a Glock, I step

Fresh to def she is
From her steps to her set she is

Fresh, uh-huh—yes, she is
Had a feeling that it would be a day like this
The orchestra in my mind, don't play like this, naw
But I'm prepared for it, got a little rare for it
Brushed off my Airs, even cut my hair for it
Cause normally I don't care for it
Don't even be looking for light like that, then there go it
Yeah, right over there, so I prepared to pour it
Little scared, my stare lowered, momma said have no fear
Plus I'm already out of my chair
Gather up my Airs on my square from here forward
It's nothing, right
So here go it, whispered in her ear
It's kinda crowded in here would she care to blow it

Won't you please come down and hug me
Think I found love in this club tonight
[Verse 2]
Never met her before
But I think I like her like a metaphor—it's hard to get
In the car we sit, from the intro
She rolled down the window, just in case I was a schizo
I compliment her on the common sense
I'm calm, a little more confident
Uh huh, and then we lose consciousness
She says that I've been waiting for you
And I know you've been chasing me too, since they kidnapped
Me from a castle, I've been thinking of you
I told a fire-breathing dragon he better not harm me
Or be sorry when he meets my one man army
And thou has come to rescue me
My knight in shining armor, yes, you be
Woken up by the horn of an SUV
I said, ""See? Too beautiful to let you sleep
You're my sunshine""

[Verse 3]
Relationship is just thirty minutes long
It's kinda heavy, maybe a little strong
Gonna take much more than once
Can't trust what each of us say at least for a month
Or two, before I bid you adieu
Do this one thing for me: out of the trillions
Of numbers that's in the world just leave me a few
That lead to you
Won't be long then, I'll see you in the morning
Cool?

[Verse 1: Chuck D + Flavor Flav]
Back, caught you lookin' for the same thing
It's a new thing, check out this I bring
Uh, oh, the roll below the level, 'cause I'm livin' low
Next to the bass, (C'mon!), turn up the radio
They claiming I'm a criminal
But now I wonder how, some people never know
The enemy could be their friend, guardian
I'm not a hooligan, I rock the party and
Clear all the madness, I'm not a racist
Preach to teach to all ('Cause, some, they never had this)
Number one, not born to run, about the gun
I wasn't licensed to have one
The minute they see me, fear me
I'm the epitome, of ""public enemy""
Used, abused without clues
I refuse to blow a fuse
They even had it on the news

""Yes"" was the start of my last jam
So here it is again, another def jam
But since I gave you all a little something that I knew you lacked
They still consider me a new jack
All the critics you can hang 'em, I'll hold the rope
But they hope to the Pope, and pray it ain't dope
The follower of Farrakhan
Don't tell me that you understand until you hear the man
The book of the new school rap game
Writers treat me like Coltrane, insane
Yes to them, but to me I'm a different kind
We're brothers of the same mind, unblind
Caught in the middle and not surrendering
I don't rhyme for the sake of riddling
Some claim that I'm a smuggler
Some say I never heard of ya, a rap burglar
False media, we don't need it do we?
(It's fake that's what it be to ya, dig me?
Yo, Terminator X, step up on the stand

Don't believe the hype, it's a sequel
As an equal can I get this through to you
My '98 booming with a trunk of funk
All the jealous punks can't stop the dunk
Coming from the school of hard knocks
Some perpetrate, they drink Clorox
Attack the Black, because I know they lack exact
The cold facts, and still they try to Xerox
The leader of the new school, uncool
Never played the fool, just made the rules
Remember there's a need to get alarmed
Again I said I was a time bomb
In the daytime radio's scared of me
Cause I'm mad, plus I'm the enemy
They can't come on and play me in prime time
Cause I know the time, cause I'm getting mine
I get on the mix late in the night
They know I'm living right, so here go the mic—sike
Before I let it go, don't rush my show
You try to reach and grab and get elbowed
Word to Herb, yo if you can't swing this
Learn the words, you might sing this
Just a little bit of the taste of the bass for you
As you get up and dance at the LQ
When some deny it, defy it, I swing Bolos
And then they clear the lane I go solo
The meaning of all of that, some media is the wack
As you believe it's true
It blows me through the roof
Suckers, liars, get me a shovel
Some writers I know are damn devils
For them I say, don't believe the hype
(Yo, Chuck, they must be on the pipe, right?)
Their pens and pads I'll snatch cause I've had it
I'm not a addict fiending for static
I'll see their tape recorder and I grab it
(No, you can't have it back, silly rabbit)
I'm going to my media assassin
Harry Allen—I gotta ask him

(Yeah, boy, part two bum rush the show)
Yo Griff get the green, black and red, and
Gold down, countdown to Armageddon
'88 you wait the S1's will
Put the left in effect and I still will
Rock the hard jams, treat it like a seminar
Reach the bourgeois and rock the boulevard
Some say I'm negative, but they're not positive
But what I got to give, (The media says this?)
Red, black, and green, you know what I mean?

[Outro: Flavor Flav]
Yo, don't believe that hype
They got to be beaming that pipe, you know what I'm saying?
Yo, them Megas got 'em going up to see Captain Kirk
Like a jerk and they outta work
Let me tell you a little something, man;
A lot of people on daytime radio scared of us
Because they too ignorant to understand the lyrics of the
Truth that we pumping into them clogged up brain cells
That just spun their little wooden skulls they call caps
You know what I'm saying?
But the S1s'll straighten it out quick-fast, in a hurry
Don't worry, Flavor vision ain't blurry, you know what I'm saying?
Yo, Terminator X

Kanyeezy you did it again, you a genius, nigga!

[Chorus]
Lucifer, son of the morning! I'm gonna chase you out of Earth
(I'm from the murder capital, where we murder for capital)
Lucifer, son of the morning! I'm gonna chase you out of Earth
(So you need to change your attitude 'fore they asking what happened to you)

[Verse 1]
Lord forgive him, he got them dark forces in him
But he also got a righteous cause for sinning
Them-a-murder me, so I gotta murder them first
Emergency, doctors performing procedures
Jesus, I ain't trying to be facetious, but
""Vengeance is mine"" sayeth the Lord, you said it better than all
Leave niggas on death's door, breathing on
Respirators for killing my best boy, haters
On permanent hiatus as I skate
In the Maybach Benz, flyer than Sanaa Lathan
Pumping ""Brown Sugar"" by D'Angelo
In Los Angeles, like an evangelist
I can introduce you to your maker
Bring you closer to nature, ashes after they cremate you bastards
Hope you been reading your psalms and chapters
Paying your tithe, being good Catholics, I'm coming
[Chorus]
Lucifer, son of the morning! I'm gonna chase you out of Earth
(I'm from the murder capital, where we murder for capital)
Lucifer, son of the morning! I'm gonna chase you out of Earth
(So you need to change your attitude 'fore they asking what happened to you)

[Verse 2]
Yes, this is holy war, I wet y'all all with the holy water
Spray from the Heckler-Koch automatic
All the static, shall cease to exist
Like a sabbatical, I throw couple at you, take six!
Spread love, to all of my dead thugs
I pour out a little Louis, 'till I head above
Yessir, and when I perish, the meek shall inherit the Earth
'til that time, it's on and popping, church
Like Don Bishop, the fifth or palm cock either
Lift up your soul or give you the holy ghost
Please I leave you in somebody's cathedral for stunting like Evel Knievel
I let you see where that bright light lead you
The more you talk, the more you irking us
The more you gon' need memorial services
The Black Album, second verse, is like
Devil's pie, save some dessert for us

[Interlude]
Man, I gotta get my soul right
I gotta get these devils out my life
These cowards gonna make a nigga ride
They won't be happy 'til somebody die
Oh man, I gotta get my soul right
'Fore I'm locked up for my whole life
Every time it seems it's alright
Somebody want they soul to rise
I chase you off of this Earth
(Let me get serious for y'all, one second)
[Verse 3]
I got dreams of holding a nine milla to Bob's killer
Asking him ""why?"" as my eyes fill up
These days I can't wake up with a dry pillow
Gone but not forgotten, homes I still feel ya
So, curse the day that birthed the bastard
Who caused your church mass, reverse the crash
Reverse the blast then reverse the car
Reverse the day and there you are, Bobalob
Lord forgive him, we all have sinned
But Bob's a good dude, please let him in
And if you feel in my heart that I long for revenge
Please blame it on the son of the morning, thanks again"

Won’t tear one tissue, no tears, no tissue, not an issue
Don’t cry for me
I peep these niggas from deep
Got a front row seat even if you don’t speak
Silent partner, I hear you loud and clear
Left a fingerprint, you ain’t gotta be there
I’m just waiting til’ you dig a hole big enough to put your whole body in
Then I’m gon' body them
It's nothing but a hobby to him
Simple as a serve in volley to him

Why kill a puppet and leave Geppetto alive?
Why not wait to catch them all together?

How is niggas dissin' me
I made it possible
For niggas to make history
How is this possible?
Please explain this shit to me
How is it logical?
Have we forgotten our history?
Let’s open our bibles
It's like the disciples, dissing Jesus and becoming his rivals
Shunning the one thing that they owe they life to
You let that man hype you to go against your idol
Knowing good and god damn well this what I do
Think I’m in the office, I’m off my grind?
That’s how kids become orphans
You lost ya mind?
I keep my enemies close
I give ‘em enough rope
They put themselves in the air
I just kick away the chair

Cause even when you win, ultimately you lose
Real niggas like, “Why Hov talking to Dude?”
You sellin' in low 2's, only time you went plat
My chain was on your neck, that’s an actual fact
So I’m prayin’ that it spills outside of the booth
That’s when ya’ll niggas outside of your truth
Outside of your league, that’s not what you do

Don’t look at Hov like he done something wrong to ‘em

I have asked America's foremost young poet to read his latest poem for us)

[Verse 2]
Hit you with the funk it's like, ""who cut the provolone?""
Government officials put taps on my mobile phones
Nations overthrown hold my own on my zone
Prone to leave your dome blown poem after poem, homes
Jones for the tones roam with me turn your motor on
Overall this war just got it goin' on
Overgrown child never growin' old sowin' oats pokin' notes
Till the never nose ho overdose
On my flows those flows goes deep
Hold your nose bros knows foes yo don't sleep
Slow your roll, show my soul, total hold
Domination don't ya know
I'm the comet like Muhammad with the verbal rope-a-dope
It's the

Paragraph president
He's been sweeping the nation with a hard hitting campaign
Paragraph president
As a politician he regards himself as a national harmonizer
Paragraph president
And so mister president we urge you to do something about the deplorable
State of our nation
I pledge allegiance to the pen and the pad
And the mic and plates of America
And to the republic, kiss my ass
Thugs fakin, actin' hard to get this killer beef
That was given to me
I must bust it for all

[Verse 3]
Leave your city burnin' like Gomorrah
Stamina, blaze up your space, plus I got it on camera
And I'm a animal, animator landin' a
Blow cleaning clocks nothing left for the janitor
Punching through your granite a goodwill ambassador
From another planet I could kill and smash ya up
And it won't stop and I can't stop - better-er
Can erupt and it does had enough amateur?
A rammin' ya feel the goats horns slammin' ya
Ham it up every single time that I stand in a
Crowd of emcees backin' up when I'm actin' up
On a frenzy after ya yellin' ""that's enough!""
And it tempts me, that it does, and I'm glad it does
When I flip see spatula style's stackin' up
Many big threes rappers on never catchin' up
Passin' up, ride passenger, is it black enough?
Spectacular! Now ya know who's attackin' ya
Crackin' up mashin' top mind capturer

Live From the Plantation,Mr. Lif,"['hip hop', 'alternative', 'r&b']","[Spoken: Mr. Lif]
Oh, my fucking god, man
Oh, fucking serious
Jesus Christ, man
Already?
Man, time flies like a motherfucker

[Verse 1]
Rise and shine
Yet another day to toss away
What does my clock display?
It says eight
Shit, I'm late for work again
So then
I dip with my pad and my pen
Step into the work place with my work face
Wince at my time card, 'cause I'm scarred
Mad 'cause I sacrifice my day and it gets me
A trifling hourly wage of six-fifty
Nifty
Now I'm off to slave quarters
With a whole bunch of other people's sons and daughters
Working so they can be mothers and fathers
Laboring real hard
Hoping the boss offers
More petty cash to us bums and paupers
Kissing his ass, 'cause they hoping they prosper
Here's the math
You work a third of your day away
The government takes a third of your check, correct
You go home and drink
'Cause you don't get an ounce of respect
And your spirit is wrecked
Life is a gift to be enjoyed every second, every minute
It's temporary, not infinite
Yet, I find myself looking at the clock
Hoping for the day to fly by
So I ask myself why
I'm doing this remedial work for second graders
I'm an educator with mega flavor
So
Maybe I should just jump up and get ill
Maybe I should let these people know they're being killed
Maybe I should try my very best to chill
And get paid, 'cause I gotta pay bills
Rah
[Scratches]
""'Cause I've had it""

[Spoken: Woman and Man]
Excuse me, brother, could you please stop making that noise so I can talk?
Thank you
Now, the boss says he wants you to come up with more copies of these checks
Hey there, champ, big boss man says you've been late three days in a row
Better sharpen up
And the boss says he wants you to move your desk to the basement
And can I have this stapler?

[Spoken: Mr. Lif]
Aw, this fucking place sucks
Same shit every day
Like to wring the boss's neck, though
If only dreams could come true

[Verse 2]
Dead boss
Somebody call Red Cross
I guess he got caught up in my mental holocaust
How much did it cost?
Just a little piece of my mind for peace of mind
(But he's bleeding)
Oh, no, leave him
He'll be fine
He'll heal on his own
If you just give him some time
Considering the fact that his face is misaligned
His legs are over there lying right next to his spine
(Lunchtime)
[Spoken: Mr. Lif]
Jesus, I must have been daydreaming, man

[Verse 3]
My boss walks by, he's looking just like an asshole
Smiling 'cause he jerks niggas for minimal cash flow
He's cool to my face, but I swear, I heard him laugh, though
Tickled by the fact that I'm the modern-day Sambo
And just when I think that I'm about to go Rambo
I call up my man and he says he understands, yo
We all are being murdered by a similar process
Whether you work at the candy store or slave at the office
The purpose of our life is just to serve the economy
They misinform our minds to paint a picture of harmony
But if you're listening, you know that shit's out of tune
'Cause the function of our life is just to work and consume
Fuck reaching out to help the next, there ain't any room
Just close your eyes and block your ears and march to your doom
But since I ain't really getting paid for my time
I pulled out my pen and started writing a rhyme
Can't you see that I'm busy, jerk?
Don't dare approach me with busy work
Take another step and get hurt
By the man that embodies mad years of anger
A cool bro', soon to be the Boston Strangler
Everything inside of me's about to erupt
'Cause a righteous individual dislikes the corrupt
I knew he'd lock me up if I started a brawl
So I jetted and I punched the clock the fuck off the wall
[Spoken: Mr. Lif]
Yeah, that's right, motherfucker
You can't keep on underpaying people
And mistreating them all the time
That's gonna result in crime
As a matter of fact, you know what?
Fakts, yo, cut this motherfucker up, man

La La La,Chris Webby,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
We rollin' trees and smokin' la la la la la
Another weed song from me
Burnin' more trees than Cheech Chong
Red and Meth all roll together in the same L
We smoke blunts all day, you can't tell? Hell
I'm stompin' in with my boots on
Rollin' to the diner with my half off coupon
Fuck, I been burnin' since I was newborn
So high flyin' through space with Jimmy Neutron
That's how I do mon, rock the rhythm
You would think I had a mothafuckin' pot prescription
Like the doctor's flippin', my grass stay fresh cut
Sticky icky wet stuff, put it in the next dutch
But last time I had a checkup, the doc said my brain was not fully developed
Fuck, but it just don't matter, I'mma have to roll the next blunt fatter, ha!

[Hook]
La la la la la
Just break it up and smoke that (la la la la la)
Now twist it up and smoke that (la la la la la)
Now light it up and smoke that (la la la la la)
And then you keep on burnin'
[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
The way this weed hits your chest, should invest in Kevlar
Chillin' on Saturn, cruisin' in the XR
Everyday I got the best bars
And the best weed same color as Reptar
Yes, we stay lightin' up the purple
In my own entourage, smokin' like Turtle
Fuck all the commercials, they all straight lies
Actin' like I'm gonna kill a mothafucker cause I'm high
The most I'm likely to do is open the fridge
Chill on the couch, and never end up leavin' my crib
Shit, but that's just how I do
Stay high, seein' from my birds eye view
I walk into a room and everybody starts sniffin'
""Like, oh my God, I can guarantee that's Christian""
""It's nine in the morning yo, what the fuck's with him?""
And I'm like, ""Chill! I've got a weed addiction"", like

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
We lightin' ganja ganja, every day we burn dutchies
And always we stay around more trees than Fern Gully
I earn money, spend on weed, and burn money
Got the dice in my hand, can't take my turn from me
I rip like a beast when I hit the beats
But it's just weed when they say I'm equipped with heat
Please, shit's leavin' you in disbelief
I'm that monster at your door, bitch, trick-or-treat
The way I freestyle, shit, it really baffles me
Cause I'm a pot head, call me Johnny Appleseed
I got a dub and a dutch, let's roll and spark
Til we start to see shit like Joan of Arc
I know I'm smart, I know I'm nice
That's why ya'll can't see me like a poltergeist
Smokin' la la la, give that bowl a light
Grab the bong even tighter than I hold the mic, like

Damn
Forgot to do somethin', let me see, uh
Oh, yeah— it ain't over, motherfuckers
The motherfuckin' saga continues
Y'all motherfuckers ready for N.W.A? Well, get the fuck up
A bitch is a bitch, so if you're poor—
It was once said by a man who couldn't quit, dope—
Ice Cube writes the rhymes that I say
But now, since he stepped the fuck off
Here's what they think about you
That punk Ice Cube—
Here's what they think about you
Cube was suckin' so much New York dick
Here's what they think about you
Real niggas? Them niggas Dre and Yella used to wear lipstick and lace
Here's what they think about you
Why y'all let his punk ass in the group
Here's what they think about you
When they was in London, they wasn't no good without fuckin' Ice Cube
Here's what they think about you
When I bought the tape, all I know is I wanted my motherfuckin' money back
Here's what they think about you
I smell—
Here's what they think about you
N.W.A. ain't shit without Ice Cube

N.W.A. ain't shit without Ice Cube
Fuck all y'all
[Verse 1]
Goddamn, I'm glad y'all set it off
Used to be hard, now you're just wet and soft
First you was down with the AK
And now I see you on a video with Michel'le
Looking like straight bozos
I saw it coming, that's why I went solo
And kept on stompin'
While y'all motherfuckers moved straight outta Compton
Living with the whites
One big house and not another nigga in sight
I started off with too much cargo
Dropped four niggas, now I'm making all the dough
White man just ruling
The Niggas With Attitudes? Who you foolin'?
Y'all niggas just phony
I put that on my mama and my dead homies
Yella Boy's on your team, so you're losing
Ayy, yo, Dre, stick to producing
Calling me Arnold, but you been a dick
Eazy-E saw your ass and went in it quick
You got jealous when I got my own company
But I'm a man and ain't nobody humping me
Trying to sound like Amerikkka's Most
You could yell all day, but you don't come close
'Cause you know I'm the one that flow
You done run a hundred miles, but you still got one to go
With the L-E-N-C-H M-O-B
And y'all disgrace the C-P-T
'Cause you're getting fucked out your green
By a white boy, with no Vaseline

Now you're getting done without Vaseline
Now you're getting done without Vaseline
Now you're getting done without Vaseline
Damn, it feels good to see people, on it

[Verse 2]
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peeling
Who gives a fuck about a punk-ass villain?
You're getting fucked real quick
And Eazy dick is smelling like MC Ren's shit
Tried to tell you a year ago
But Willie D told me to let a ho be a ho, so
I couldn't stop you from getting ganked
Now let's play big bank take little bank
Tried to diss Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it
'Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
Cut my hair? Nah, cut them balls
'Cause I heard you like giving up the drawers
Gang-banged by your manager, fella
Getting money out your ass like a motherfucking ready teller
Giving up the dollar bills
Now they got The Villain with a purse and high-heels
So don't believe what Ren say
'Cause he's going out like Kunta Kinte
But I got a whip for you, Toby
Used to be my homie, now you act like you don't know me
It's a case of divide and conquer
'Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga gotta run and hide
Yelling Compton, but you moved to Riverside
So don't front, MC Ren
'Cause I remember when you drove a B210
Broke as a motherfucking joke
Let you on the scene to back up the first team
It ain't my fault, one nigga got smart
And they ripping your asshole apart
By taking your green
Oh, yeah, The Villain does get fucked with no Vaseline

Now you're getting done— get— getting done
Now you're getting done— get— getting done
Now you're getting done without Va— Va— Va— Va— Vaseline

I never have dinner with the president
I never have dinner with the president
I never have dinner with the president
And when I see your ass again, I'll be hesitant
Now I think you a snitch
Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half pint bitch, fucking your homeboys, you little maggot
Eazy-E turned faggot
With your manager, fella
Fucking MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella
But if they were smart as me
Eazy-E would be hanging from a tree
With no Vaseline
Just a match and a little bit of gasoline
Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on
'Til that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation
Off the massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga, what you thinking 'bout?
Get rid of that devil real simple
Put a bullet in his temple
'Cause you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew
With a white Jew telling you what to do
Pulling wools with your scams
Now I gotta play The Silence of the Lambs
With a midget who's a punk too
Tryin' to fuck me, but I'd rather fuck you

C'mon! (Woooo!)
Yeah

So what if you flip a couple words? I could triple that in birds
Open your mind, you see the circus in the sky
I'm Ringling Brothers, Barnum & Bailey with the pies
No matter how you slice it, I'm your motherfuckin' guy
And just like a b-boy with 360 waves
Do the same with the pot, still come back beige
Whether right or southpaw, whether pot or the jar
Whip it around, it still comes back hard
So easily do I W-H-I-P
My repetition with wristses'll bring the kilo bidness
I got Creole C.O. bitches for my niggas
Who slipped, became prisoners, treats taped to the visitors
You already know what the bid-ness is
Unnecessary commissary, boy, we live this shit
Niggas wanna bring the '80s back
That's okay with me, that's where they made me at
Except I don't write on the wall
I write my name in the history books, hustlin' in the hall
Nah, I don't spin on my head
I spin my work in the pot, so I can spend my bread

If it wasn't for the crime that I was in
But I wouldn't be the guy who rhymes it is that I'm in (that I'm in)
No pain, no profit
P, I repeat if you show me where the pot is (pot is)
Cherry M3's with the top back (top back)
Red and green G's all on my hat
North Beach leathers, matching Gucci sweater
Gucci sneaks on to keep my outfit together
Whatever, hundred for the diamond chain
Can't you tell that I came from the dope game?
Blame Reagan for making me into a monster
Blame Oliver North and Iran-Contra
I ran contraband that they sponsored
Before this rhymin' stuff we was in concert

Money over broads, you got it—fuck Bush
Chef, guess what I cooked?
Baked a lot of bread and kept it off the books

Way before the bars, my picture was getting took
Feds, they like wack rappers
Try as they may, they couldn't get me on the hook, ugh

I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what’s up witcha?
I hate callin’ the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I’m urgin’ all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You’re never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin’ on me to be there like missin’ rubbers
I’m on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain’t the life that I’m used to
Reintroduced to people I’ve been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won’t remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I’m halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin’ like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don’t drink every bottle I own, I be agin’ shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin’ shit
Which one of y’all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I’ve been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don’t really fuck wit
Fuck is up?
Havin’ lunch and debatin’ Ferrari prices
23 and goin’ through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I’m not sayin’ I’m the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven’t hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it

Ready for Whatever,T.I.,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Hate the price of fame 'cause it cost too much (Uh-yeah, boy)
Lame niggas, these niggas talk too much (Uh-yeah)
I'm ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em (Uh-yeah, boy)
I said, ""I'm ready for whatever,"" hey, hey (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Even though my head in the clouds, I'm planted on the pavement
How I'm walking 'round, people staring at amazement
I play a lot of games on where I be, and I ain't playing with it
They so judgmental, maybe they don't understand:
If your life was in jeopardy e'ryday, is you telling me
You wouldn't need weaponry, just because of your felony?
Consider this, at least: I got e'rybody sweating me
On the streets, it's people who won't rest unless I rest in peace
Killed my folk a year ago; still, in my sleep, they threaten me
Paranoia stressing me; ain't nobody protecting me
I'm dealing with the pressure from my partner dying next to me
Think 'cause no one's arrested, they coming for me eventually
This was all the things I was going through mentally
This could be the reason I ignored the penitentiary
Not mentioning New Orleans niggas coming in the city
Killing all summer long, ain't nobody pay attention
[Pre-Hook]
Now, is it that hard to understand if you listen?
Either die or go to jail—that's a hell of a decision
But I'm wrong, and I know it; my excuse's unimportant
I'm just tryna let you know that I ain't think I had a choice, for real

[Hook]
I had straps in my ride (Ride), gotta go to prison (Prison)
You waiting on me to die, you gon' be waiting for a minute (Yeah)
Boy, I'm ready for whatever (Whatever), somebody better tell 'em (Tell 'em)
I be here when the smoke clears and everything settles, for real
Can't afford the price of fame, 'cause it cost too much (Too much)
Plus, these sucker niggas lame, and they talk too much
Yeah, that's why I'm ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em (Tell 'em)
I be here when the smoke clears and everything settles

[Post-Hook]
For real (For real)
For real (For real)
(Yeah, I know what you thinking)
Ayy, for real (I'm for real)
Yuh, I say, ""When e'rything settles, for real"" (For real)

Ayy, ayy, for real (Ayy, for real)
(Naw, not exactly)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, for real (Ayy, for real)
(I tell you how this shit went down for real, dog)
I say, ""When e'rything settles, for real""
[Verse 2]
I'm a man, I ain't perfect—I admit it: I'm guilty
But understand; feel me (Yuh): I was riding filthy
'Cause niggas out there plotting (Plotting), to rob me and kill me (Yuh)
Five hundred thousand every year spent on security (Hey)
My future was bright, but now, it's gettin blurry
'Cause niggas in a hurry to find me and bury me
But surely, God'll deliver me up out it
I'm a fighter to the heart; I forever be about it
I'm a father to my sons (Sons), asset to my community
Look, all that I done: My good outweigh the negativity
Ayy, mentally, I was focused on not letting history repeat itself
That’s why heat was kept in the vicinity
(Yes, officially, I broke the law, but not maliciously)
Through all of the publicity, was anyone considering
My position and the logic hid in my decision? (Ayy)
But they caught me with it, now I'm off to prison, period (Bye)

[Pre-Hook]
But is it that hard to understand if you listen?
Either die or go to jail—that's a hell of a decision
But I'm wrong, and I know it; my excuse's unimportant

[Outro (Spoken)]
Ayy, I said listen, homeboy. You can talk all you want, mayne, you know what I'm saying? Everybody talk to the King, you know what I'm sayin? Everybody's entitled to an opinion, you know what I'm sayin? They like yesterdays, everybody got one
But the fact of the matter remains: if you ain't walk a mile in my shoes and you ain't lived a day in my life, you ain't survive the shit I done survived, you ain't had to deal with the shit I had to deal with, homeboy—you can't muhfuckin' judge me, partner
I mean, look at folk like Sean Taylor. You know what they said?
They said, had he had a strap, he'da lived today. You know what I'm sayin?
Now, true enough, I was dead wrong, I broke the law, I deserve to be punished. I understand that, aight? Cool. But listen, man, I got a house full of kids, a mama, and an old lady, whose life is my responsibility. You dig that?
Now, for all of y'all who think I was just ridin' around on some dumb shit: you know I'm smarter than you man! You know I'm smarter than you dawg! Ay, if you think I was just being stupid, shawty, I got some muhfuckin' oceanfront property in Idaho for sale, homie. If you believe that, I got a bridge in Brooklyn I wanna sell you, partner
Ay, man, real talk: In order to understand my train of thoughts, you have to put yourself in my position. You can't expect me to think like you, 'cause my life ain't like yours, you know what I'm sayin?
If you don't understand that, you don't understand English. I'm done talking"

[Verse 1]
I was born with a dick in my brain, yeah, fucked in the head
My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed
'Til one night he snuck in and said
""We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed""
Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?
""After I fuck you in the butt, get some head
Bust a nut, get some rest,"" the next day my mother said
""I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid!
The bastard won't even eat nothing he's fed
He just hung himself in the bedroom, he's dead!""
""Debbie, don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there, stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck
I'll bet you he's fakin' it, I'll bet you, I bet
He probably just wants to see how upset you would get
I'll go handle this, of course, unless you object?""
""Aw, go fuck his brains out if any's left in his head!""

If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane!
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane!
[Verse 2]
""Did you get him?"" Nah, fucker tried to bite my face off
I just got fuckin' chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop
Took his eye out, picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding-dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong
Then he set the lawnmower out on the dang lawn
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off
Everything except his tank top and his training bra
Ain't he raw? Yeah, maniac, that's Shady, dawg
Man that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he dawg?
Shady, dawg, what be goin' through that fuckin' brain of yours?
Say no more, what the fuck you waitin' for? Sing along!

[Verse 3]
Don't you know what felch means? (""Yeah"") Well then, tell me
Would you rather get felched or do the felching?
Fuck 'em in the ass, suck the cum out while you're belching (Urrp!)
Burp, belch, and go back for a second helping
Can you dig what I'm saying, man? Can you smell me?
I want you to feel me like my stepfather felt me (Oh...)
Fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelping
""Shady, what the fuck you saying?"" — I don't know, help me!
What the fuck's happening? I think I'm fuckin' melting!
""Marshall, I just love you, boy, I care about your well-being""
No, Dad, I said no! — I don't need no help peeing
I'm a big boy, I can do it by myself, see?
I only get naked when the babysitter tells me
She showed me a movie like Nightmare on Elm Street
But it was X and they called it ""Pubic Hair on Chelsea""
""Well, this is called 'Ass Rape' and we're shooting the jail scene!""

If you could count the skeletons in my closet

It's 16 fever and that's since april
My Corvette paid for, my old-school paid for
The hummer roll up? That means you assed out

We push white sacks out, them backs get pushed out

Say ""you can't afford it"". Yo, I can't ignore it

Riding drop-top in the winter with the heat on
Bad yellow bitch keep my passenger seat warm
Leg hanging out the window, you ain't got these on
Bitch, holler! It is Lil Weezy
They cannot see me, they are like Stevie
I am bearing a ton like Levy
I circle your house like BB
Colder than the heebie-jeebies, never give freebies
Seventy-five thousand for these fees, shit
I can get a hundred thousand up in these jeans
Big stacks, my pockets on Creatine

And I'm just murdering niggas, free of charge
You dig? Just holler back, I see you, Sarge
I'm so motherfucking high, I can eat a star
Yeah, let me upgrade you
You may not be a model, but I can front-page you
You know I'm nasty, excuse my behavior
Let me just taste you, we can fuck later
Sitting in the coupe, looking like a racer
Top peeled back like the skin of a potato
Seat way back, listening to Anita Baker
Riding by myself, smoking weed by the acre
Hollygrove gator, ain't nobody greater
Leave you with some bulletholes the size of craters
You ain't heard the latest, Weezy F. the greatest
Battle anybody, nigga, fuck whoe'er your favorite
It's a new game, and I'm the coach like Avery
Leave it to the flow, we getting dough like the bakery
I don't really want to, but these niggas making me
Put a motherfucker on ice like the Maple Leaves
That's a hockey team, and I ain't on no hockey team
But I'm a champion—where's the fucking Rocky theme?
Damn, rest in peace, Apollo Creed
I'm a monster, every day is Halloween
A lot of syrup, lot of pills, and a lot of weed
And I keep my pockets green like a pod of peas

Deez nuts in your mouth, and can you swallow, please? Haha

I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned
Bitches, what's up with ya?
I hate calling the women ""bitches,"" but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I'm urging all daughters to kiss their mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls counting on me to be there like missing rubbers
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain't the life that I'm used to
Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won't remember?
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feeling like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don't drink every bottle I own, I be aging shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engaging shit
Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think that you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I've been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck with, fuck is up?
Having lunch and debating Ferrari prices
23 and going through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I'm not saying I'm the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I'll never forget none of that

You be careful crossin the street
Hey mister, you forgot your things, hey mister

[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
I got a job with the mob, makin g’s
Doin some pickups, deliveries and transportin keys
Yeah they got me like a flunkie money
I’m drivin' around with ten kilos inside my trunk g
And I’m holdin the suitcase
With a half a million dollars on my lap in front of my face
And I’m tryin to ignore it
But sometimes I get tempted to go dip and make a run for it
The thought alone makes me shiver, damn
What if I get caught? they’ll find me floatin in the hudson river
But if I escape, I’ll be in shape for my life
But they might, get my kid and my wife
See I’m supposed to make a stop
To an uptown spot, run up the block and make another drop
But I got somethin else in mind
So at the next stop sign I pull out and load up the nine
I got the money and the hit
Went through the brook nonstop cause I ain’t droppin off a block of it
Then I thought of a plan
So I drove to my house and got my girl and my little man
C’mon baby, pack your stuff, get ready
Damn, why your face all sweaty?
Just hurry up, don't throw no fits
I’m a dead man walking, understand, we gotta split
I switched the locks on the door
Started packin gucci bags like I was goin on a world tour
Grabbed the luggage and the gun
C’mon we gotta go, you gotta brother on the run

Don: What?

Now I’m drivin and I’m lookin at my passport
I’m outta here soon as I hit Kennedy Airport
Loaded the other automatic
I don’t believe this, I'm like a sitting duck stuck in traffic
I’m gettin nervous as hell g
A lincoln continental pullin right up beside me
Puts down my girl and then I bent low
Bullets are flying through my window
The enemy is on attack
Drew the nine and cocked the hammer and I fired at the guinea's back
I gotta take my respect
My bullets hittin crazy mafia members in the neck
Looked at my girl, a bullet struck her
Put in another clip, cause I ain’t givin up nothin my brother
Hit me rollin up in trenches
Sprayin at my car, only missin me by little inches
Stepped on the gas pedal, how bad my girl is harmed?
Man they only hit her in the upper arm
Now I’m drivin off sidewalks, makin sharp turns
My son is in the back catching heartburns
I got the car shakin' wildly
I made a turn, and then I then I ditched the bimmer in a dark alley
They drove right past, now all this chasin stuff is done
Yeah they got a brother on the run
[Hook: Mobsters Talking]
Don: I want Him dead!
I want his family dead!
I want his house burnt to the ground!

[Verse 3: Kool G Rap]
The next thing I know, it was daylight
And I been sleepin with the engine running all night
I started pullin on my ho
What man what? wake up stupid, we gotta go!
Pulled out the alley, then I dipped
Looked down and picked up the nine and put more rounds in the clip
You know I’m headin south no doubt
Don’t care about my whereabouts, as long it’s a hideout
Finally we crossed the border, I pulled into a station
To fill up the tank, and get a drink of water
Pullin over to park my ride
That’s when I noticed this limousine comin up on my left side
Then the sucker started rammin' me
Then I looked, it was the Luciano family
Looked at my girl she started cryin, my finger on the trigger
Pulled it- bullets started flyin
Now I’m hittin all them bastards
I’m droppin em fast, while I blast the blood splashes
Then I finally done it
I took em all out, but I caught one in the stomach
Now I’m lookin for survivors
So I ran up on the side of the car, and hit the driver
And then I laid low
Catchin' breath the only one left was Don Luciano
So I snuck up on the sucker
Put my gun to his head, whassup now motherfucker?
He said, wait, I want to talk
(three gunshots) I put his brains on the sidewalk
Another life I had to waste
He fell on his back, and then I spit right in his guinea face
He saw the barrel of the devil’s gun
Now they no longer got a brother on the run"

Ambitionz Az a Ridah,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble!
Now, you know how we do it, like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind, nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah

[Verse 1]
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public (Hahaha)
My attitude was ""fuck it,"" 'cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
(And [?]) Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah (Excuse me, baby)
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her (Got ya)
Then I spit some game in her ear, ""Go to the telly, ho!""
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke (Hahaha)
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay us
I got no time for these bitches (Hell no,) 'cause these hoes tried to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin'
Competition got me blitzed on that bullshit they stressin' (Booyah)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so (Haha)
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row (Yeah)
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on a scheme to come and trick us (Haha)
But thug niggas be on point and game tight (Yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart are strapped up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous, 'cause deep in they hearts they wanna be me
Uh, yeah (Haha,) and now you got me right beside ya
Hopin' you listen, I catch you payin' attention
To my ambitions as a ridah
[Chorus]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me (My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
(I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah)

[Verse 2]
It was my only wish to rise above these jealous
Coward motherfuckers I despise, when it's time to ride
I was the first to hop inside (Let's go, nigga, let's go,) give me the .9
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life (Yeah, nigga!)
That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel (That's all you niggas got? Hahaha)
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama (Dear Mama,) come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught (Shoot)
Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then, nigga, die for it
Let them other bustas try, at least you tried for it (Hahaha)
When it's time to die, then be a man and pick the way you leave (Yeah, nigga)
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

[Chorus]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me (My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
[Verse 3]
My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Stay off the block, evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years (I'm back, baby)
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
(Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck) Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish
My powers, so now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace (Them niggas cowards)
They cowards, that's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas (Bitch-ass niggas) on my team so indeed they wet me up (Punk niggas)
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it (Hahaha)
Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it (Yeah, right)
Witness the realest, a who-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cries from all your people when they find her, must remind ya
(Thug life) My history'll prove I been it
Revenge on them niggas that played me and all the cowards that was down wit' it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya
Hopin' you listen, got you payin' attention to my ambitions
As a ridah

[Chorus]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me"

One, one two
Check me out right here yo

[Verse 1: Puff Daddy & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Yo, the sun don't shine forever
You can turn the track up a little bit for me
But as long as it's here then we might as well shine together
All up in my ears
Better now than never, business before pleasure
The mic is loud, but the beats isn't loud
P. Diddy and the Fam, who you know do it better?
Yeah right, no matter what, we air tight (YEAH!)
So when you hear somethin', make sure you hear it right
Don't make a ass outta yourself, by assumin'
YEAH! Now the mic is lower, turn the mics up
Our music keeps you movin', what are you provin'?
Turn that shit all the way up, yeah
You know that I'm two levels above you baby
Music's gettin' louder
Hug me baby, I'ma make you love me baby
This shit is hot!
Talkin' crazy, ain't gon' get you nuthin' but choked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
And that jealousy is only gonna leave you broke
So the only thing left now is God for these cats
And BIG you know you too hard for these cats
I'ma win 'cause I'm too smart for these cats
While they makin' up facts (uhh) you rakin' up plaques
[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
In the commission, you ask for permission to hit 'em
He don't like me, hit him while wifey was with him
You heard of us, the murderous, most shady
Been on the low lately, the Feds hate me
The son of (*Satan*), they say my killing's too blatant
You hesitatin', I'm in your mama crib waitin'
Duct tapin', your fam' destiny
Lays in my hands, gat lays in my waist
Francis, M to the izz-H phenomenal
Gun rest under your vest by the abdominal
Rhyme a few bars so I could buy a few cars
And I kick a few flows so I could pimp a few hoes
Excellence is my presence, never tense
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike
Anyone - Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
Action, pack guns, ridiculous
And I'm, quick to bust, if my ends you touch
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch
Two auto-matoes, used to call me fatso
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows
Militant, y'all faggots ain't killin' shit
Oops Cristal keep spillin' shit; you overdid it holmes
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone
Hold hands and say it like me
The most shady, Frankie baby, fantastic
Graphic, tryin' to make dough, like Jurassic
Park did, quick to spark kids who start shit
See me, only me the underboss
Of this holocaust, truly yours, Frank White
[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
We got the real live shit from front to back

[Verse 3: Puff Daddy]
Put your money on the table and get your math on
Break it down, split it up, get your laugh on
See you later Dog, I'ma get my stash on
There's a bed full of money that I get my ass on
I never lose the passion to go platinum
Said I'd live it up 'til all the cash gone
Ain't that funny, only use plastic, craft it
To make classics, hotter than acid
P-D, rollin' on your tape or CD
The Billboard killa, no team illa
The Fam-o, ammo, is every channel
We been hot for a long time burnin' like a candle
What you can do is check your distribution
My songs bump in Houston like Scarface produced 'em
You ain't gotta like me, you just mad
'Cause I tell it how it is, and you tell it how it might be
[Verse 4: The Notorious B.I.G.]
We got the shit mapped tight, brass knuckles and flashlights
The heaters in the two-seaters, with two miras
Senoritas, kiss rings when you meet us
P. Diddy run the city, show no pity
I'm the witty one, Frank's the crook from the Brook'
Mad he broke the neck of your coke connect
No respect, squeeze off 'til all y'all diminish
Shootouts for twenty minutes, until we finish
Venice took the loot, escaped, in the Coupe
Break bread, with the 'Kiss, Peniro, Sheek Louch'
Black Rob joined the Mob, it ain't no replacin' him
Niggas step up, we just macin' them, placin' them
In fune-rals, criminals turned aroused
To Brick City, nobody come off like P. Diddy
Business wise, I play men
Hide money on the Island Cayman
Y'all just betray men, we spray men, I position competition
Another day in the life of the commission

We got the real live shit from front to back
To my niggas in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?

You Must Love Me,JAY-Z,"['pop', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Kelly Price (Jay-Z)]
Throughout my life (uh huh uh huh uh)
No matter what I've done (right)
You've been merciful and your love endureth (yeah)
Through all things (yeah)
For that I am eternally grateful

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Since my date of birth bought you nothing but hurt
Play those video games, stole change from ya purse
Sat on the cold court bench 'til I was arraigned in ya skirt
Saw the pain in ya face, still you maintained a smirk
All you did was motivate me, ""Don't let 'em hold you back""
What I do? I turned around and I sold you crack
I was a bastard for that, still I'm drowning in shame
Just remember one thing now: you're not to blame
You was newly separated tryin' to escape ya world
And through my thirst I didn't help you I just made things worse
I hated me and everybody that created crack
Had me thinkin' the newest kicks and the latest gat
Still haven't apologized, so please play this back
While I try to come to terms with such a heinous act
You know in more than one way cocaine numbs the brain
All I did was think about how the funds once came
Then I ran across this memory and it stung the brain
How can you ever destroy the beauty from which one came
That's a savage, you're the reason
Why me and these beats make a marriage
Why I rhyme above average and I ain't shit
Glad you got yourself together, no thanks to me
Strong and beautiful the way thangs should be
You must love me
[Chorus: Kelly Price]
You must love me...
Say that you love me
All I know say that you must love me
Ohh yeah

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
We used to fight every night but I never would suffer
Just smile, my big brother's tryna make me tougher
As we grew fussing and fighting continued
As I plundered through ya stuff and snuck ya clothes to school
Got intense, real intense as we got older
Never believed it would lead to be poppin' one in your shoulder
Where my rings? Knew you had it 'cause you took too long
As Mickey, Annie and the girl that bought it looked on
Huffin' and puffin' gun in my hand told you step outside
Hoping you said no but you hurt my pride
Made our way down the steps
Maybe you thought it was just a threat
Or maybe ya life was just that crazy
And you was beggin' for death
Try to justify this in my young mind
But the adrenaline and my ego hurt combined
Drove me berserk, saw the devil in your eyes
High off more than weed
Confused, I just closed my young eyes and squeezed (gunshot)
What a sound! Opened my eyes just in time
To see ya stumbling to the ground
Damn, what the fuck I done now?
Runnin' around in a circle thinking I'm assed out
Hot gun burnin' my waist, ran straight to Jaz' house
Like a stranger damn I just shot my nigga
And ran off into the night as if it was not my nigga
Left the scene, how could I go out that way?
Still you asked to see me in the hospital the next day
You must love me
[Chorus: Kelly Price]
What after all the wrong I've done
You must love me...
I know you must
You must love me...

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Everything in my power and within my frame
To protect you from this life and keep you away from the game
But you was one of the few people that I can trust
And the fact of the matter I slang these pies for us
You put the pressure on me daily, rarely would you let it go
Was a thousand and one times I had to tell you no
But it was one of those days when nobody was around
And I needed emergency trip out of town
Searched my mental Rolodex for all the numbers I know
As you stared in my face asking me could you go
I agreed said send her everything'll go smooth
Just tell her what to do and everything'll go through
Strapped her body with them thangs as you boarded the plane
Couldn't explain the strange feeling that I caught in the vein
I'm thinking why would I send you when I knew it ain't right
I'm thinking what would make you sacrifice ya life
You must've love me

[Chorus: Kelly Price]
(""You must love me"" repeats in background)
After everything that I've done wrong
I know inside you must love me
I know that you love me
You showed me I know it
I know
Say that you love me
Say that you love me
I know you must love me
Oh yes you do
Inside I know it
You've always shown it
You love me yea yeah
Oh yeah
I know that you love me"
Better on the Other Side,The Game,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Diddy & Boyz II Men]

This the type of song that make the angels cry (Mike Jack)
I look up in the sky and I wonder why? (Why?)
Why you had to go, go, I know it's better on the other side (You were the greatest)
You were chosen from the start (Chosen, oh), never gon' let you go (Oh, oh, oh, God chose you, will never forget you)
It's from my heart, woah-oh (The King, we miss you)

[Verse 1: The Game]
Who's Michael Jackson? You're Michael Jackson
I'm Michael Jackson, we all Michael Jackson
I guess what I'm askin' is, everybody bow their head for a legend, don't breathe for a second
Now let the air out, grab the hand of somebody you care about
So you can hear my message, my confession, somebody tell Usher
I seen the moonwalk, I guess the young thriller touched him
Like he touched me, like he touched you
So carryin' his legacy, somethin' I must do
And I trust you lightin' candles, concrete visuals
Me and my brothers listen to Jackson 5 in the livin' room
First thing I did when I heard, was call Puff
'Cause him and Mike tried to stop the beef between us
Who was us? Me and 50, that beef is dead
Him and Mike Jackson gonna take us to the ledge

It's from my heart, woah-oh (Oh, oh)

[Verse 2: The Game]
As I'm pourin' out this liquor, candles start to flicker
When list my Air Ones, MJ was my nigga
Not the one that play ball, the one with the Hollywood star
And since I'm a Hollywood star, I'ma tell you my story
Never had a family that close
Never see Berry Gordy walkin' through Interscope
But just like me, they always had Mike in a scope
No matter what you say, I'ma love him and he's still dope
Let me take you back to '85 when I was in a zone
Dancin' for my mama, 'Thriller' jacket with all the zippers on
Now i'm doin' 90, 'bout to crash in this Aston
Listenin' to Outkast, I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
Anythin' I can ever do to better you
Your son was our king so we won't Corretta you
I'm writin' this letter to all the Jackson kids
We all Jackson kids, time to let us through

This the type of song that make the angels cry (Oh woah)
I look up in the sky and I wonder why?

You were chosen from the start, never gon' let you go  (Oh, oh)
It's from my heart, woah-oh

People could say what they wanna say about you (Oh)
We gon' remember the miracles that you showed us (Oh)
Through your music, through your dance (Oh woah)
Through your philanthropy
You were the one that made us all realize that we are the world
You were the one to show us we can moonwalk (Yeah)
You gave us the beat (Hey)
Gave us the rhythm (Hey-ey)
Gave us the soul (Oh)
Through us, your legacy lives on (Anything)
You can't stop now, we won't stop now (Anything, oh)

Hope you don't forget my name

Stop the music playing loud and clear

And I refuse to lose, no
I've never been the type to quit
You'd probably give up now and just turn back around but that's one of many differences
Because I don't care what the distance is
I told you I'd take it all the way
I couldn't just walk away and just pretend like I don't have more to say
Stop the music playing loud and clear
Cause they don't want to hear
Oh Lord they don't want to hear
But its loud and clear
And its deep inside my soul
They can't hold me down no more
They got to let me go!

Coz I know what I've gotta do
I couldn't stop now even if I wanted to
They told me give it up its impossible
I never bury my head in the sand like the ostrich do
And I'm young and I still got a lot to prove
I can't stop, won't stop, unstoppable
Elevator looking down on all obstacles
Until I heard a voice from the other side of the room, telling me to
Stop the music playing loud and clear
Cause they don't want to hear
Oh Lord they don't want to hear
But its loud and clear
And its deep inside my soul
They can't hold me down no more
They got to let me go!

But they don't mind throwin' a brick
White people go to school
Where they teach you how to be real thick

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody's doin'
Just what they're told to
And nobody wants
To go to jail!
[Chorus]
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own

[Verse 2]
All the power's in the hands
Of the people rich enough to buy it
While we walk the street
Too chicken to even try it

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody's doin'
Just what they're told to
And nobody wants
To go to jail!

[Chorus]
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own

[Verse 3]
Are ya' takin' over
Or are ya' takin' orders?
Are ya' goin' backwards
Or are ya' goin' forwards?
[Chorus]
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own"

Damn
Damn
Heheheh
Ugh

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Damn, Cole World
I never thought I see that day that you my old girl
Now I’m stuck here hollerin' at ol' girl
Got one, got two, three, four girls
Shotgun in the drop made a right
Hut-one, hut-two, told them hoes take a hike
Then it’s on to the next—on—on to the next one
Hard to move on when you always regret one

[Verse 2: Miguel]
I wonder sometimes
I wonder if I was wrong
Tryna do right by you got me here
Now all I am is alone
[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Cause her eyes, and those hips
And that ass, don’t compare, at all, no
And at best, all they do is distract me but now
Deep down, when I face it

[Chorus: Miguel]
All I want is you
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now
Now that you’re gone, gone, gone

[Verse 3: Miguel]
'Cause being your friend is killin' me softly
Hear voices, wonder where I went wrong
It was my fault and the wrong time
I wonder so often, regret gets exhaustin'

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Cause her eyes, and those hips
And that ass, don’t compare, at all, no
And at best, all they do is distract me but now
Deep down, when I face it

[Chorus: Miguel]
All I want is you, mmh
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now, sugar
Now that you’re gone, gone, gone
All I want is you, ooh-ooh, ooh
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now, baby
Now that you’re gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
[Bridge: Miguel & J. Cole]
Cause they don’t smile, huh, or smell like you
And they don’t make me laugh, or even cook like you
And they don’t photograph, nah, they don't sex like you
Let's face it (yeah) I can’t replace it (yeah)
That's why all I want is you now

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
I hit the club when you left me thinking that could heal shit
Tryna celebrate my Independence Day, Will Smith
Baby girl, who I’m kidding? Still sick, real shit
All my new hoes seem to get old real quick
And could it be, you everything that these plain bitches couldn’t be?
Is it a sign from the Lord that I shouldn’t be?
Lost in the player way, sorta get old to me
Got me on layaway, girl you got a hold on me
I say, ""I’m wrong"", you say, ""Come again?""
Damn, said I was wrong, look don’t rub it in
I got a lot on my mind, got a flock full of dimes
Like a line full of hoes, how they coming in
Just sayin', don’t wanna have me then somebody will
I’m playin', weight on my chest like I body build
I’m prayin', you ain’t content with tryna do your thang
And come back baby, boomerang, 'rang, huh

[Chorus: Miguel]
That's why all I want is you now
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now, sugar
Now that you’re gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

Ayy, ayy, I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems (Uh)
Niggas hating but I love them even though they trying to scheme
But I'm past that (Past that), a nigga's stock is rising like the Nasdaq (Uh-huh)
They say I’m the future but yet I’m giving niggas flashbacks
Of better days when you ain't have to settle for whatever played
I represent the struggle, nigga, I say what they never say
Whenever they spit that bullshit they spittin'
This that pulpit, I’m hittin' niggas with the gospel (And the lord said)
Hostile with them hoes, I got a dollar in my pocket plus a dream
Yeah you laughing my nigga but everything ain't what it seems
What it means to know your mama or your father on that pipe
On that hard white, I’ll tell you what them scars like
I’m speaking through these bars like a nigga in the jail
Tired of siftin' through my mail, I feel like Cartwright, bills (Bills and bills and bills)
For real, a nigga ill
Just let me do the talkin', man, I know how niggas feel

I got a dolla and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seem
Every lady ain't no ho and every bitch ain't no queen
Every nigga ain't no dog and every nigga ain't no king (Uh-huh)
Shit be happening for a reason, everything is everything
Every nigga can't dunk, some white man can jump (Haha)
They shootin' niggas 'fore they even tell 'em put their hands up
Crooked cops got a nigga scared to drive
Probably thinkin' that I’m slangin', man, I see it in their eyes
But inside of my pocket is a dollar, plus a dream
Yeah, you swear your girl is faithful; everything ain't what it seems
See, I seen how she glance and looked away like she want it
I ain't sayin' I'ma fuck her, but I could if I wanted
Know it hurts that she flirt with a nigga, this is worse
I bet if I was to hit, man I wouldn’t be the first (Nah)

Spit it like I get it from the Bible for your survival

I hear my phone ringing in the morning, 9 o’clock
And it's you (God damn), can't even front, I press ignore (Yeah)
I still got your letters layin' in my dresser drawer (Haha)
You tellin' me about all the things you did for me (I know, I know, I know, I know)
When I was broke, you sent me dough and that was big for me (I know, I know, big for me)
See you was there every year when I needed you
And you were so quick to give I had to be with you
Remember when I used to call you on your phone line
I knew it was official when my mama cosigned (Haha, yeah)
But in no time, a nigga graduated

But I was usin' you, you gave a nigga major stacks (Major stacks)

I heard motherfuckers sayin' they made Hov
Made Hov say, ""Okay, so? Make another Hov!""
Niggas wasn't playin' they day role
So we parted ways like Ben and J-Lo
I shoulda been did it but I been in a daze though
I put friends over business end of the day though
But when friends' business interests is Day Glow
Ain't nothin' left to say though, I guess we forgot what we came fo'
Shoulda stayed in food and beverage
Too much flossin', too much Sam Rothstein
I ain't a bitch but I gotta divorce them
Hov had to get the shallow shit up off him
And I ain't even want to be famous
Niggas is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
And I ain't even know how it came to this
Except that fame is the worst drug known to man
It's stronger than, heroin
When you could look in the mirror like, ""There I am""
And still not see what you've become
I know I'm guilty of it too, but not like them; you lost one
[Chorus: Chrisette Michele  & Jay-Z]
Lose one, let go to get one (One, one, one)
Get one, lose some to win some (One, one, one, one, you lost one)

Sorry, I'm a champion, you lost one (One, one, one, one, uh)

I don't think it's meant to be, B
For she loves her work more than she does me
And honestly, at twenty-three
I would probably love my work more than I did she
So, we ain't we, it's me and her
'Cause what she prefers over me is work
And that's where we differ
So I have to give her free time, even if it hurts
So, breathe, mami, it's deserved
You've been put on this Earth to be all you can be like the Reserves
And me? My time in the army, it's served
So I have to allow she her time to serve
The time's now for her, in time she'll mature
And maybe we can be we again like we were
Finally, my time's too short to share
And to ask her now it ain't fair, so yeah, she lost one

[Chorus: Chrisette Michele  & Jay-Z]
Lose, one, let go to get one (One, one, one)
Get one, lose some to win some
One, one, one, oh yeah, she lost one

Sorry I'm a champion, you lost one (One, one, one)
[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
My nephew died in the car I bought
So under the belief it's partly my fault
Close my eyes and squeeze, try to block that thought
Place any burden on me but please, not that, Lord
But time don't go back, it goes forward
Can't run from the pain, go towards it
Some things can't be explained, what caused it?
Such a beautiful soul, so pure, shit!
Gonna see you again, I'm sure of it
'Til that time, little man, I'm nauseous
Your girlfriend's pregnant, the Lord's gift
Almost lost my faith, that restored it
It's like havin' your life restarted
Can't wait for your child's life to be a part of it
So now I'm child-like, waitin' for a gift
To return, when I lost you, I lost it

Lose, one, let go to get one (One, one, one)
Get, one, lose some to win some

I come attackin' this enrage to disengage the missin' page
To the newest in age that's hittin' stage
(Now why that be?) For I be one that knows the art
To get you up and out your seat if you was Rosa Parks
Tell me, how much can you take from me, the man that make
Rhymes that be so butter, my breath smell like Land O'Lakes?
You know the lick, see me hit 'em like a brick
Plus my posse run thick, not that click from Mario flick
Beware of one of the best they be
You wanna test the God? I hope you mean the SAT
Because your poetasterous style, it plain, bore me
Pardon the vainglory, but here's the Kane story (come on!)
[Chorus]
Bringin' you that uncut pure, knockin' at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo' hands up to the sky-

[Verse 2]
Ah, man, fuck the chorus
And let the lyrics sit up in the track like rigamortis
I spit a few to listen to when this I do it's as if you
Was invisible, it'll make your life miserable
Hip-Hop icon, keep a grip just like a python
I be that wrong one to get fly on
Boy, you got to get that player hatin' out you
That's the other side of the game and I ain't Erykah Badu
Black Caesar, don't you even reach my way
You soon to find a vital point that's on Priest Pai Mae
I heat it up to where I pasteurize half the guys
A fast demise, disaster lies as he dies
Confront one of the best at rhymin'
What I write it be so rough that my ink pen done need alignment
The untouchable, don't want to tempt me
I come kickin' through your door, unlawful entry
It be me, even though none of y'all want to see me
For real, damn, I know how Jehovah's Witness feel
I remember how I formed it up
Because I took what was raw and then I warmed it up
I turned the fire down to simmer as I calmed it up
But take a look, I think the Kane about to overcook
Come and get it, but you better come with paramedics
'Cause you couldn't bring it to me if you worked for Fed Ex
I come cuttin' through, split his gut in two
I touch 'em, what him do? You know the style ain't nothin' new
(Let's go!)
[Chorus]
Bringin' you that uncut pure, knockin' at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo' hands up to the sky, high
Get on down, baby, we keep it live
Bringin' you that uncut pure, knockin' at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo' hands up to the sky, high
Get on down, baby, we keep it live

[Verse 3]
A good game it lets the plot thicken
But the thing that just ain't clickin' is the way y'all legalize trickin'
You talk about your ride when you don't even got one
But I can pull a hot one when inside of a Datsun
The wicked in the bed, plus the wicked in the head
When I shoot the game, it's like my tongue got infra red
Let the Messiah take you higher as I supply ya what you require
Desire and admire it entire
Sudden impact as I'm guttin' 'em, black
Closest thing to me would be (what's that?) Nothing in fact
I come with more in skill to always score and kill
Females adore and thrill, sweeter thing than Lauryn Hill
As I return with a vengeance, here comes the day of independence
Approach 'em all with some bad intentions
In other words, I'm makin' 'em resign
Diminish mine, runnin' through 'em like a finish line
[Chorus]
Bringin' you that uncut pure, knockin' at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo' hands up to the sky, high
Get on down, baby, we keep it live
Bringin' you that uncut pure, knockin' at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo' hands up to the sky, high
Get on down, baby, we keep it live"

Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop ""that's right""
Shot you, shot you, shot you, ""that's been real right""
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop ""in City Of Angels y'all""
You know, yeah...

[Verse 1: ColdUm 187]
They always yelling out freeze
When I'm on the back streets gettin' mine
Dodging the law, dodging the chalk line
And if y'all feel me
I'mma keep it real for this episode
Takin' you all into some critical overload
What must I do to live in the City of Angels?
Pack a full clip with one cocked in the chamber?
Cause it remains to be the same to me
I gotta be an O.G. like my daddy and my grandpappy
Don't ever test mine
Don't ever disrespect mine
Better yet I tote a 'Tech in case you ever cross the line
Yo, I'm like the crow, Low down and dirty
As I handle my business and as I take you on this journey
It ain't no City Of Angels where I'm at
It's just people playing get back and more get back
Yo, a lot of drama on my block but I never stress
Because I'm built like a Presidential Rolex
A lotta people die over the red or the blue
A lotta players hustle cause they got to
But if I ever go out before I'm supposed to go
I'm goin' revenge myself like the Crow...
[Hook 2X: Frost]
L.A. should be crazy-Ass-Place to stay
Where the rider die and players play
I've been around the world and around the way
24/7 like every way

[Verse 2: Frost]
I see the clock strike half past
I'm movin' fast, quick to blast
I'm like an angel in the city with the devil's path
And everybody's out to get me
So I quickly stick and move
And if he moves I trip, my finger's itchy
I got a vision, I'm on a mission
Listen, I can hear them but I can't trust my intuition
I'm wishin' upon that midnight mystical
And through the darkness, I'm hoping for a miracle
I can't holler till you hear me
I gotta get me through the madness even though I'm guilty
And as I reload I'm all alone set to explode
Like a pathological murderer that's in the zone
I know the working, the spirit's lurking
I'm hurting, the triple six with the kiss got my soul searching
When I awoke I choked on a cloud of smoke
It was a dream and in my dream, I seen a black crow...
[Hook]

[Break: Frost Talking]
Another day in L.A. comes to an end
The dark of the nights starts to set in
Lots of peers going down under the seek lights

[Verse 3: KM.G]
Welcome to the city of drag where my pants sag
And my homies still reying on the flag
Yeah, life starts to twist and turn
And it hits you at another angle
Just some more drama in the City Of Angels
Violence is brought forth through many years
Broken memories, we cried so many tears
Ooh the Devil plays the repo man
And he's sucking up souls
As fast as he can
It ain't no question
It's in our nature
A 45 brings out the criminal behaviour
When the clouds in the sky turn black and gloom
As soon as the smoke starts to fill the room
Your heart starts to beat, it's like the ritual
And the feeling that you get is somewhat spiritual
I'mma have to let you know how reality goes
Makes you fly like the Crow as you slide into limbo...

Earth Wind  Fire,Big Daddy Kane,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","I'm from Brooklyn, New York C

I be the Earth motherin', smotherin' MC's
Sha Queen covering 360 degrees

See I blow like the wind when I flow to this song
Cause a riot like Kaiser like that then I'm gone

I bring the fire burn it down to the ground
Think of dissin' me, Kane will leave that ass rotisserie (What)

Earth, wind, fire we be those elements
It's evident, as we come to represent

[Sha-Queen]
I feel the need to get iller than
All these fuckin' wack Mc's, realest Bitch that ever been
Dropped the hit single that was flying through the roof
I'm lyrical living proof, you can't handle the truth
After you heard me spit, still convinced that you ill
Who you tryin' to fool me or yourself, bitch for real
Everybody know the deal, you ever get a hunch
To fuck around with Sha-Queen, then I know you out to lunch
Break that meaning down, that means disturbed in your mental
And that's absurd, I kick the illest shit you ever heard
Every rhyme to the last line and pronouns and verbs
Too hard to see with your two eyes, then check with your third
My frequency's not tainted with thoughts of whores
That can only get raw on all fours, with sore back doors
Precisely, far from your average girl
So, sit back and shut the fuck up, cause Sha rules the world, word
[A.B. Money]
Listen there was a man in Brooklyn, New York C
Where the guys are fly and the ladies looking pretty
I'm a let you know, that stuff you pop is junk
Cause when I flow, it's the flavour of the month

Hold up don't worry about nothin', tot shit in a smash like crash dummies
This fast money, make me wanna fuck around and blast money
I heard your spot makes a lot and give you props
This deal is hot, runnin' from the cops'll get you shot
But don't sweat it, dry them niggas up like prunes
The war's on like Platoon
Shot through a crowd like a cartoon
Rappin' is fundamental, that's right, re-arranger
Hit you like Mortal Kombat, you in danger
I got the chronic, six million bionic
This rap shit make me wanna scream like Onyx
I'm comin' through, that's right I'm gonna split ya
Soul survivors on this track, we comin' to get ya
Woop, woop, five-o's comin' in the exit
Keys jinglin', nine danglin' to wreck shit
Step into my cypher, haven't you ever heard a
Throwin four five six, ceelo, to one twenty third a

[Chorus: Sha-Queen]x2
Earth, wind & fire you bout to learn
We can make the world turn, or make the world burn
The three deadly elements for your concern
Cause anything you want up out of life you got to earn
See now bring it brother well, well

[Big Daddy Kane]
Since hip-hop genesis, I been at this in the mix
In Bed Stuy tenements, rippin' rappers endless
But I won't sit and dwell upon the things I been had
Instead I appear, and take your fuckin' spot like Sinbad
Now, tell me who shall be first to suffer crucial
If you don't know defeat then allow me to introduce you
So how you want it, coming through beatin' ya down
Watching disaster strike when Busta Rhymes ain't even around
The Prince of Darkness be that one man
That made them Al B Sure lookin' niggas get a sun tan
What I drop should not be followed by anyone else
At times I'm scared to kick a second verse after myself
As I proceed, followers take heed
I made many men bleed, I made hairlines recede
This rap skill here, I destined for a mill-aire
And this is one ass whippin' you will wear, you still here?

[Chorus: Sha-Queen]x2"
Shame,Big Daddy Kane,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
There's no myth or fable about the pimpin' at your label
What goes on under the table, why you think your deal is so unstable?
Now, whose the macaroni, A&R's acting phony
Once you make the matrimony, then he start to slackin' don't he
Or could it be the president that's being hesitant
Playin' his artist like a corner workin' specimen
And I ain't kidding you when I say it's political
The way they make a ridicule of artists can be pitiful
You know damn well there shouldn't be no company CO
Trying to show me about rap that's 53 or so
But yet and still they want to add advice, trying to keep their status right
When they should be working records for Gladys Knight
Who shape artists, man they catching rape charges
Once you sign on the dotted line, they lead you in the blind
Then you find, your state of revenue remains the same
Cause you getting less points than Steve Kerr be getting in a game
And just because it be too hardcore to judge it
They won't even touch it, and get to frontin' on the budget
When new artists come out, I can foresee the worst outcome
Cause everybody I know got beat their first album
So I took my contract to a lawyer so he can check it out (He don't know)
Then I took it to Dionne Warwick so she can  read my hand (She don't know)
Chorus
It's a shame, when artists gotta deal with cheats
They got game, for every young rapper they see out on the streets
You sign your name, they get like Big Red on the Five Heartbeats
Now who the blame, when you starvin' and your record label eats

[Verse 2]
Preach brother
They say the truth will set you free, but I see signs of treachery
Go on perpetually, here's how they get you G
They use the tricks, just to juice your mix
But cross be in their heart like a vampire stabbed with a crucifix
I had the enemy in my vicinity with the false identity
Of a friend to me to injure me
They ride along just to guide you wrong
Play like they beside you strong, and start to faking moves like Olajuwon
Who side you on, revealing all that low down dirty dealing
I can see your skin peeling it changed like a chameleon
First you believe in them, but once you disagree with them
They try to get Magilla repertoire and that ain't even them
And all those who has betrayed, be fast to fade
Cause they cast a shade, with the masquerade
What's dealt, is low blows below the belt
Lord have mercy, I know how Julius Caesar must have felt
I start to think back when I was just a youth
I should have listened to the words of the God Born Truth
He said, ""look out for black snakes they all up in your cypher
Black snakes you can't see therefore they sneak up and they bite ya'""
They get to flippin' cause they think you slippin'
So remember, don't get to slippin' cause they get to flippin'
And trippin', what's that you grippin', beside your hippin'
You think my heart is skippin', go save that game for Scottie Pippen
[Chorus]
It's a shame, to see how far left people be going
They got game, to think that all this time you said you know them
It ain't the same, Aah, so now you see the way they flowin'
Now who they blame, ain't nothing but a wolf in sheep's clothing

[Verse 3]
Now, wait a minute, I'm starting to see lotsa, hip-hop imposters
Is rap a category at the Oscars?
Too much Nino Brown up in your life
Cause since then, man I done seen Wesley Snipes playin' a drag queen
But yet and still you want to mimic the stars of cinema
Pretending huh? So full of it they need an enema
Cause see dig, they all like to talk big
But then they want to renege, when there's a curling iron in their wig
You talking loud and saying nothing, what's the world becoming?
The frontin', now pay attention you may learn something
Now, I ain't knocking you, but come on let's be logical
You know that it's impossible to stop the unstoppable
I would suggest that they, go back and check my resume
Cause tunes that I made yesterday, can hang out with the best today
Peace to Easy Mo, cause he makes the beats to flow
And I grab the microphone and flip it like pizza dough

[Chorus]
Shame
Now who the blame
I need to be the Mayor, so I can change the things around here
I need to be the Governor, I need to be the Governor"

Coming from the shore, got stop by the one time

So many niggas to die three strikes

Retrospect for Life,Common,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Common]
Yo, we gotta start respectin' life more y'all
You look at your brother man you gotta see yourself
Gotta see the God within him
We brothers gettin' changed real quick over nothin'
We losin' too many of ours
Gotta recreate y'all
Yo, check it

[Verse 1: Common]
Knowin' you the best part of life, do I have the right to take yours?
Cause I created you, irresponsibly
Subconciously knowin' the act I was a part of
The start of somethin', I'm not ready to bring into the world
Had myself believin' I was sterile
I look into mother's stomach, wonder if you are a boy or a girl
Turnin' this woman's womb into a tomb
But she and I agree, a seed we don't need
You would've been much more than a mouth to feed
But someone, I would've fed this information I read
To someone, my life for you I woulda had to leave
Instead I lead you to death
I'm sorry for takin' your first breath, first step, and first cry
But I wasn't prepared mentally nor financially
Havin' a child shouldn't have to bring out the man in me
Plus I wanted you to be raised within a family
I don't wanna, go through the drama of havin a baby's momma
Weekend visits and buyin' J's ain't gon' make me a father
For a while bearing a child is somethin' I never wanted to do
For me to live forever I can only do that through you
Nerve I got to talk about them niggas with a gun
Must have really thought I was God to take the life of my son
I could have sacrificed goin' out
To think my homies who did it I used to joke about From now on I'ma use self control instead of birth control
Cause 315 dollars ain't worth your soul
315 dollars ain't worth your soul
315 dollars ain't worth it
[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
You said you would be here when it rained
Why didn't you stay

[Verse 2: Common]
Seeing you as a present and a gift in itself
You had our child in you, I probably never feel what you felt
But you dealt with it like the strong black woman you are
Through our trials and tribulations, child's elimination
An integration of thoughts I feel about the situation
Back and forth my feelings was pacin'
Happy deep down but not joyed enough to have it
But even that's a lie in less than two weeks, we was back at it
Is this unprotected love or safe to say it's lust
Bustin', more than the sweat in somebody you trust
Or is it that we don't trust each other enough
And believe, havin' this child'll make us have to stay together
Girl I want you in my life cause you have made it better
Thinkin' we all in love cause we can spend a day together
We talkin' spendin' the rest of our lives
It's too many black women that can say they mothers, but can't say that they wives
I wouldn't chose any other to mother my understanding
But I want our parenthood to come from planning
It's so much in my life that's undone
We gotta see eye to eye, about family, before we can become one
If you had decided to have it the situation I wouldn't run from
But I'm walkin', findin' myself in my God
So I can, discipline my son with my rod
Not have a judge tellin' me how and when to raise my seed
Though his death was at our greed, with no one else to blame
I had a book of African names, case our minds changed
You say your period hasn't came, and lately I've been sleepy
So quit smokin' the weed and the beadies and let's have this boy
[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
You said you would be here when it rained
Why didn't you stay
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
Now the situations made things change
Why didn't you stay"

But they say where you goin', you ain't even gonna need it
(Die!) I seen you ridin' round, shinin' with your fine round
Diamonds, pretty green eyed lady
Been on the sideline, plottin' while you primetime, poppin'
Hungry niggas want a piece of your pastry
I suggest you protect your bakery
'Cause they comin' for your head
And there's a bounty on the chain
That's hangin' from your neck, you see
[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
I don't know what you been told
In your ear, but I hear it's goin' down
Somebody gotta (Die!)
Know, oh, what you been told in your ear
But here's what's goin' round
Somebody gotta (Die!)

[Verse 2: GemStones]
Hit a nigga, put the mini Mac strap, clap
Any nigga think he gettin' G's down here
Enemy to any nigga gettin' money on my honey
Man, I heard Michael Young is the real clown here
Run upon a nigga from the back with a Mac
Gon' be strapped 'cause a nigga finna squeeze off ten
Run upon this nigga 'Lac, rat-a-tat-tat
Click-clack, where this nigga at? I needs in
Shit is going down if ever I see him
Rub a nigga out like Oxy 10
And keep a couple of dollars up in the wallet
To pay the coppers so they can never box me in
(Die!) That's what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Ridin' around polishin' this big pistol
I'ma catch him in the wind, pray the gun don't jam
So, until we meet again, nigga, it's cool

Ain't nobody with a shotty out plannin' to do a robbery
Itchin' to catch a body
Creepin' in a stolen jaloppy out there waitin' on you
I'm sittin' in this stolen car, finna rob this nigga
Should I let the mini-Mac or the shotgun hit him?
I been waitin' all day tryna spot this nigga
I can't let him get away, I'ma pop this nigga, UGH!
Plus, they don't know about the chopper in the trunk
The Glocks in the box and the nine on tuck
The bulletproof glass, the 40 in the stash
I pull the steering wheel and it pop on up
40 caliber stashed up in this cash box
Bulletproof windows, you couldn't break 'em with a padlock
AK in the trunk, where the sounds bump
Two twin Glock 40's, and a 9 in his damn crotch
Man... (Die!)
We finna go up in this club, show a little love
Get a few drinks, holler at some girls
Snatch up a pair, leave outta there
Put some dro' in the air, then go and get some grub
They finna go up in the club, show a little love
Get a few drinks, holler at some girls
Snatch up a pair, leave outta there
Put some dro in the air, then catch a few slugs
Ayy, ayyy, pull over right here, I gotta take a pee
And don't go nowhere, nigga, wait for me
And if some niggas do kill you in the next few minutes
Just remember, my nigga, it's a heaven for a G

Alertin' the service, bringin' marines with kerosene flasks
Guns and masks
Jumpin' through glass with sig 229's and mp5's

When I was a baby my pacifier was a grenade pin
And yes, I'm from Tampa, no I'm not a Buccaneer
But I'll be buckin near your main arteries ya fuckin queer
The sun is here, cover your eyes
All my attributes is dangerous

My hip bone will send your clique home
With they ribs blown back and they wigs sewn to they six pack

Don't open doors for bitches, so which one would you choose?

Catacomb Kids,Aesop Rock,"['rock', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
I was a dark, dumb student, no hooky rookie
Day tripping on visions of chickens that look like R. Crumb drew em
They grew em in a royal dirt of Suffolk County's
Flooring with the blood of an alcoholic clergyman in his forearms
Long Island was porn stars and puppies pushing sniffles
Fit into the aforementioned or slipped through the pinholes
Zook slipped through the pinholes
Crispy the God sender
Who thunk over a quarter plunk to local Mortal Kom vender
Both the formal squad censor, look down
Either side across the marsh before it was awesome cars
My calling card cavalry cooking an '85 Dodge Ares
Gas for Huntington and back barely
Equipped with Super-Soakers full of piss
And an uncanny knack for constantly upsetting pigs by doing stupid shit
The kid piloted his ring king dummies to King Kullen
Where he hollered fuck the world from a parking lot in the suburbs
What's this
A couple spray cans and a little litter
But they'd look at us like swindlers with them Ricky Kasso jitters
So fuck em, a glutton sunk into the alley for props
But things will still go bump when them halogens pop
Believe I'll be there when it happens
The shaking of the plates off the mantle
The snaking of the flames off the candle
The lady of the lake off the answers
Admitting the mistakes to their deplaning cadavers
Now it's rest in peace Will Peterson whose heater sung disturbingly to
Further re-evaluate your beast of burden's urgency
Damn doggy, good times, thanks
I wrote your name in wet cement by the Brooklyn Banks
What's this
[Refrain]
I'm an activator
Made a fire, made a wheel, made a snack for later
Catacomb kids cuddle up and test the flavor
When the towns speed freaks sleep
Trap the traitor, he will ask for papers
What's this
Say I'm an activator
Made a roof, made a weapon, made a flag per acre
By the snotty little muzzle of a latch-key neighbor
When the folk push aggie over some dap with gators
He will catch the vapors

[Verse 2]
Couple Playboy mudflaps and hell on his heels
Beautifully echoed in the pace at which he shovel his meals
Like not a farmer among us had a harvest survive the winter
So dinner split a lima bean in triplets, pick a winner
Took a couple summers puking pills behind the dumpster
As the largest Pez dispenser on record recouped his numbers
One shoe in the soupy gutter
One shoe in the velvet heaven
Where the mermaids told him shake em by the lake of melted weapons
What's this
You could dance purty with the hooligan nation
Who will be patiently awaiting zoo-keeper facelift
Extra the days of yore painted similar uber-ape shit
We've merely updated the ancient 8-bit
Yeah I'm dumber than a cow on a roof in a flood
Who's not as dumb as the watered-down beef from the burgers that jumped
I'm dumber than a Taz on a beach chair with a martini
Who's not as dumb as the tat wit the same scenery
What's this
Sparky nails pig stigmata for all good sport
Garbage pail kids unite at the mall food court
They chase cheese fries with Binaca
They had shut the school down early
There were bombs inside the lockers
No concept of the problem
We responded like a snow day
It was clobber shit to flotsam
Til the cops said it was okay
Okay show the squadrons back into their boxes
Like his Breakfast Club of hotheads show no progress to the doctors
And I walk into the office, coughing awful ether often
Flood a parking meter fever, knuckle up for Love and Rockets
It was reign of the razor laser
Day of the cloudy howdy
Flight of the shelter melter
You can bow without me

Hide 'em in the wall, well, how long will the drywall take?
Well, fuck it then, I got nothing but time, I'll wait
Until it dries, for the moment, I guess you're all safe
After I sand it and buff it, I guess that I'll paint
My chainsaw's out of gas, my regular saw ain't
Now here I come again, damn stomach rumbling
You can even hear the evil spirits coming from within
Someone's in the back of my damn house, rummaging
It's a girl, she looks pretty thin, but I want her skin
Vinn, on the hunt again, when will it ever end?
Evelyn, why you trying to fight? You will never win

Pull the lever then; trap door, death is evident

Now what you know about Buffalo Bill? Nothin', so chill
Fuckin' ho, you better fuckin' hold still
Make sure none of that lotion in the bucket don't spill
Cut 'em, gut 'em, and just get to stuffin' those girls
Man, I think she had enough of those pills
Sedate her, then I wait, I come back later
Just-a clutching those steel
Blades, baby, when I cut ya don't squeal
I hate the loud noises, I fuckin' told you!
I keep hearing voices like
""Wouldn't ya like to go and get your butcher knife
And push it right through her
While you put ya shish kebab skewers into her
Barbecue her, would you do to her what you usually do
To a girl whose skin's newer?""
(In a world of sin you are, this is turning into a
Torment tournament of sorts, Christmas ornament you are)
I'll be sure to Ginsu ya 'til there's no more skin to ya

Then put 'em on your head like hat, hey back to you, Lu
Black power, I'm just runnin' with a barrel full of black powder
With a hole in it holdin' it wheezin' deep, breathin'
Runnin' from the fire on the trail I keep leavin'
I can't shake it, I swear it's heat seekin', I keep seekin'
Somewhere to hide from it, duck and dive from it
But it keep keepin' up, just when I think that I've done it
It keep sneakin' up, oh, leakin' barrel of black powder
How that flame keep reachin' us?
Just one of the long-winded, extended metaphors of Lu's
This time I use an example of a fuse to demonstrate
How I can't lose, I would put it down

And goddamn, I might have to carry this forever
Well I'm crazy to the game till they bury me insane

Truthfully, I have trouble with second verses
Cause the first one be so intimidatin', it be bullyin'
Pickin on it, instigatin', pointin' out all the second one's limitations
Like, ""You ain't nothin but a imitation, like, bits o' bacon
Then he gets the chorus and the beat to get together
Then they all gang up on him and get to hatin'
But then around the eighth bar he tires of their conspirin'
Commiseratin, then he finds his inspiration
To spar, he takes a few seconds of judo lessons
Gets back on beat, then punches the guitar
They stand in awe, like, ""When did you write that?""

Well, if you want Shady, this what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you, Debbie!
[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass (*smack*)​​
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents; my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit-for-tat with
Anybody who's talking ""This shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six year old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me; you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me
[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Seared Foie Gras with Quince and Cranberry
One day, I'm gonna say something really impressive

Hey yo quick life lesson, never touch a man's (god damn)
While he's resting or while he's bench pressing
Hey yo quick life lesson, never touch a man's (god damn)
While he's resting or while he's bench pressing

Hey yo quick life lesson, never touch a man's (god damn)
While he's resting or while he's bench pressing
Hanging out with Pan, playing flutes for affection
Hoping to seduce so I use this erection
Uh, viewer discretion, sex drug reference
Smoking all your weed, about a quarter pound of headies
Stroking on your sheets while you organize the wedding
Flowing on the beat, got to fortify my sentences
Yeah strengthen my oratory weapons
Forget the pen, Emerson in a second
Past life present, shots is like deafening
Heard around the world like the Giants won the pennant
Ain't no need to get defensive
Like Revis for the Jets or Arenas when he bets
I was messing, please don't be so aggressive
You wasting T-cells when you hating on my flesh and blood
Don't be mad that this rap's my profession
And I go to class in the same clothes I slept in
And watch hoes arm wrestle while I'm reffing
Over the top, psych, nah, mic checking, uh
Just you wait until we get to the intestine
That real shit, Ms. Frizz kind of life lesson
Magic School Bus type riding on the record
""The science of the mind, I am highly interested""
No religion, if I did it would be Buddha
Or maybe Hindu, cause Ganesha is remover
Of everything that's pseudo and that's including you know
Losers starting rumors that I'm similar to Bruno
Cool, yo, that doesn't bother me a tiny bit (Nah)
I'm confident, I'll take it as a compliment
Anonymous nonsense, well, that's time spent
I'm too wild, trying to take it on back to '9-6
Illadelph Halflife, All Eyez have been nixed
Beats, Rhymes and Life and Stakes is High shit
It Was Written in the scriptures, ATLiens exist
By Ironman and Dr. Octagonecologyst
So quit it with your Cristal sipping, wack spitting
That's finished that instant that Asher Roth steps in
Admit it, that kid is bad with it
Fast-witted, tactitic, too brash to ask critics, 'cause
They just bums, disgrunts who couldn't cut it
So they judging others on how to do something
But fuck it, I ain't trusting nothing but my gut
Try anything once except for fucking up the butt
And hugging on the nuts of some owner of some buzz-nuss
All for some bucks and some buzz cause, tut tut
I'll be doing this just for fun stuff (like what?)
Jumping in the mud in my swim trunks"
Public Service Announcement,JAY-Z,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Jay-Z]
This is a public service announcement
Sponsored by Just Blaze and the good folks at Roc-A-Fella Records

[Just Blaze]
Fellow Americans, it is with the utmost pride and sincerity that I present this recording as a living testament and recollection of history in the making during our generation

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Allow me to re-introduce myself
My name is Hov, OH, H-to-the-O-V
I used to move snowflakes by the O-Z
I guess even back then you can call me
CEO of the R-O-C, Hov!
Fresh out the fryin' pan into the fire
I be the music biz number one supplier
Flyer than a piece of paper bearin' my name
Got the hottest chick in the game wearin' my chain, that's right
Hov, OH—not D.O.C
But similar to them letters, ""No One Can Do it Better""
I check cheddar like a food inspector
My homie Strict told me, ""Dude finish your breakfast""
So that's what I'ma do, take you back to the dude
With the Lexus, fast-forward the jewels and the necklace
Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this
I shoot at you actors like movie directors (*laughing*)
This ain't a movie, dog (oh shit)
[Interlude: Just Blaze]
Now before I finish, let me just say I did not come here to show out, did not come here to impress you. Because to tell you the truth when I leave here I'm GONE!
And I don't care WHAT you think about me—but just remember, when it hits the fan, brother, whether it's next year, ten years, twenty years from now, you'll never be able to say that these brothers lied to you JACK!

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Ving ain't lie
I done came through the block in everything that's fly
I'm like Che Guevara with bling on, I'm complex
I never claimed to have wings on
Nigga, I get my ""by any means"" on whenever there's a drought
Get your umbrellas out because that's when I brainstorm
You can blame Shawn, but I ain't invent the game
I just rolled the dice, trying to get some change
And I'd do it twice, ain't no sense in me
Lying as if I am a different man
And I could blame my environment but
There ain't no reason why I be buying expensive chains
Hope you don't think users are the only abusers
Niggas getting high within the game
If you do then, how would you explain?
I'm ten years removed, still the vibe is in my veins
I got a hustler spirit, nigga, period
Check out my hat yo, peep the way I wear it
Check out my swag' yo, I walk like a ballplayer
No matter where you go, you are what you are player
And you can try to change but that's just the top layer
Man, you was who you was 'fore you got here
Only God can judge me, so I'm gone
Either love me, or leave me alone
Now, back to our regularly scheduled program, L'Album Noir: The Black Album"
My Dads Gone Crazy,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","*Television static*
*Eminem begins to snort cocaine*

[Speech: Steve King & Hailie Jade]
Hello, boys and girls! Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships. Do you have a daddy? I'll bet you do!
*Hailie opens the door*
*Eminem snorts cocaine*
Who's your daddy?
Daddy, what are you doing?

[Intro: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
Ha-ha!
Okay then! Everybody, listen up!
I'm goin' to hell! Who's comin' with me?
Somebody, please help him!
I think my dad's gone crazy!

[Verse 1: Eminem, Hailie Jade & Dr. Dre]
There's no mountain I can't climb
There's no tower too high, no plane that I can't learn how to fly
What do I gotta do to get through to you
To show you there ain't nothin' I can't take this chainsaw to?
(Rahhnnn!) Fuckin' brains, brawn and brass balls
I cut 'em off and got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall, with my framed autographed sunglasses
With Elton John's name on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, I've been lyin' my ass off
All this time, me and Dre been fuckin' with hats off
(Suck it, Marshall!) So tell Laura and her husband to back off
'Fore I push this motherfuckin' button and blast off
And launch one of these Russians, and that's all
Blow every fuckin' thing except Afghanistan on the map off
When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?
(*Knocking*) Hailie, tell 'em, baby! (My dad's lost it!)
[Hook: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy!
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, maybe?
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy! (Crazy)

[Verse 2: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
It's like my mother always told me:
""Rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana and codeine and
Goddamn it, you little motherfucker
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say, then don't say nothin'!""
Uh… Fuck that shit, bitch!
Eat a motherfuckin' dick, chew on a prick
And lick a million motherfuckin' cocks per second
I'd rather put out a motherfuckin' gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch
Eat pussy and have pussy lips glued to my face
With a clit ring in my nose, than quit bringin' my flows
Quit givin' me my ammo; can't you see why I'm so mean?
If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M.O.
I wouldn't have to go eenee-meenee-meini-mo
Catch a homo by his toe, man, I don't know no more
Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal anymore? (Dad!)
[Hook: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy!
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, maybe?
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy! (Crazy)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
At the same time, can make you dry your eyes
With the same rhyme, see, what you're seein'
Is a genius at work, which to me isn't work
So it's easy to misinterpret it at first, ‘cause when I speak
It's tongue-in-cheek, I'd yank my fuckin' teeth
Before I'd ever bite my tongue, I'd slice my gums
Get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit every time I sung
Like R. Kelly as soon as ""Bump and Grind"" comes on
More pain inside of my brain, than the eyes of a little girl
Inside of a plane aimed at the World Trade
Standin' on Ronnie's grave, screamin' at the sky
'Til clouds gather; it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And that's pretty much the gist of it
Parents are pissed, but the kids love it
9 millimeter heaters stashed in two-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither
[Hook: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy!
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, maybe?
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy! (Crazy)

Congratulations,Drake,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Uh, black hearts on my cardigan
At the crib tellin ya girl that we should order-in
Tell G to put his feet up on the ottoman
We just up against a bunch of rappers I go harder than
Damn! I'm so Catriona smarter than
A lot of these niggas swear the coach just brought the starter in
Yeah, and I'm the type to tell ya daughter things
I float high, don't try and cut my water wings
I'm still myself
Suicide bars, I kill myself
Charge it to the game, I bill myself
And I don't feel y'all, but I feel myself
Aunty Doe, tell 'em I deserve a mazel tov
I'm rappin' like a Shepherd with the muzzle off
I'm next to blow, pause
And I can't hear the critics talkin' over the applause {crowd cheers}
Yeah, I tried to tell 'em, Future let 'em know
Send the haters all my love, X and O
I got a black box where suggestions go
But I don't really give a fuck, it's prolly best you know
My reality is brighter than your dreams are
I got your dream girl ridin' in your dream car
Yeah, and the visual is stunnin'
I hope they document what I'm becomin'
Congratulations
[Verse 2]
So what you want an award or somethin'?
I'm at the private airport boardin' somethin'
I see nothing from afar but I'm far from nothing
Put on your poker face, I'll pull ya card if you're bluffin'
But I ain't with the hard talk
I got a monopoly, catch me on my boardwalk
Like I said we pull your card and find out you're a Hallmark
Just know I'm breakin' world records, no false start
I don't see your point unless it's gunpoint or somethin'
My deal like Weezy first week, one point somethin'
And my verses gettin' stupider
Wayne if you're on Mars, can you pick me up from Jupiter?
Phone blowin' up, so I'm cuttin' off my cellular
I'm a superstar, noted on to my nebula
I will break a leg, break an arm and a fibula
When I break it down, when I, when I break it down
I hug and kiss the drum kick
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit
But, you could never beat my ass, pause
Again, dammit y'all, again
Y'all, pretend that we are, some men that get it on, and in
I'll die before I lose, 'cause I was born, to win
If he don't fuck with y'all, then don't bother him
And yes, I fuck this game but I won't father them
Right, uh
[Verse 3]
It's like, these days man, I'm booked and I'm busy
Dad named me Drake, Footz named me Drizzy
They tried to tell me I'd never be nothin' but a protege
But if you watched the VMAs, there's nothing more to say
I got the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like you bought a poppy
And damn, how I get so nice?
I just spent it all once, 'bout to get rich twice
Surprise party bitch, now it's on and poppin'
I always choose dough like it's my only option
'Cause money always knows best
Chain snatch flow, they say ""Get it off your chest""
And I'm what all the fuss about
And if they talkin', I bet I'm what they discussion 'bout
Hit me at the office, same extension
Consider me the reason y'all should pay attention"

Now, can I get a encore? Do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waitin' for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise!

[Verse 1]
Who you know fresher than Hov? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah, hearin' me rap is like hearin' G Rap in his prime
I'm Young H-O, rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country, but the blueberry still connect
On the low, but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand openin', grand closin'
Goddamn, your man Hov cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him?
With no pen, just draw off inspiration
Soon you gonna see you can't replace him
With cheap imitations for these generations

Now, can I get an encore? Do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waitin' for?

(*Sighs*) Look what you made me do! Look what I made for you!
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
Wearin' the 4-5, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens
Cocksucker, take one for your team!
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales to sold-out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream 'til your lungs get sore
[Interlude]
Owww, it's star time
This man is mean, he's killin' all y'all jive turkeys
Do y'all want more of the Jigga man?
Well, if y'all want more of the Jigga man
Then I need y'all to help me bring him back to stage
Say ""Hova!"" – c'mon, say it!
Are y'all out there? [crowd chants ""HO-VA! HO-VA!""]
C'mon, louder!
Yeah, now see that's what I'm talking about
They love you, Jigga! They love you, Jigga!

[Break]
I like the way this one feel
It's so motherfuckin' soulful, man!
(Whoaaaaaahhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh)
Yeah [crowd still chanting] okay

[Verse 3]
So this here is the victory lap
Then I'm leavin', that's how you get me back
After a year of them 16's, it's 1.2
And that's 2.4, and I'm only doin' two
You wanted to gain attention, new dudes
I can get you BET – and TRL, too
You want to be in the public, send your budget
Well, fuck it, I ain't budgin'
Young did it to death, you gotta love it
Record companies told me I couldn't cut it
Now look at me: all star-studded
Golfer above par like I putted
All ‘cause the shit I uttered was utterly ridiculous
How sick is this?
You want to bang, send Kanye change
Send Just some dust, send Hip a grip
Then you gotta spit a little somethin' like this

Told me to keep two, bring him back eight
And I only brought him five and stuck his ass for three
Do you think that Clampett will sick his goons on me?
See Martel Homes, that's my claim to fame
That's where I learned my slickest tricks in the dope-d-game

When I'm too sober, year older, now I'm almost legal
Wanted to live the life of Cadillacs, Impalas and Regals
Fuckin' around wit hoes, bustin' nuts in they mouths
Kickin' that same southern slang
Lookin' for love off in yo' jaw, ho!

See never did I think when I got grown
That some pee wee sacks had been done took this town
See, life's a bitch, then you figure out
Why you really got dropped in the Dirty South
See in the 3rd grade this is what you told
You was bought, you was sold
Now they sayin' Juice left some heads cracked
I betcha Jed Clampett want his money back
See East Point Atlanta threw this road block
Talkin 'bout all this blow traffic got to stop
So the big time players off John Freeman Way
Had to find themselves another back street to take
'Cause back in the day we was outta control
We didn't understand, ""Naw nigga, that money ain't yours""
That's when me and Big Slate took an oath and sweared
Never would we talk, never would we tell
So when they pulled up bumpin' ""Rock The Bells""
We took what we want and left them quiet as hell
What you niggas know about the Dirty South?
What you niggas know about the Dirty South?

Now that Cobras got the boys on Delowe on they back
Gipp hollered at Miss Ann, she said they didn't get trapped

A lot of faces ain't around, a lot of folks got shot
Scatta Mack droppin' G's while that Cristal pop
Been on the grind with Cool Breeze, droppin' pounds with B
Eric Neal is the coolest from my century
Mack town keeps growing, old school like Charles
Stankin' like dem Lincolns in Piedmont Park
Perry Homes to Herndon Homes, to all the Homes
Adamsville to Poole Creek, shit, just don't sleep in the Dirty South

One to da two da three da four
Dem dirty Red Dogs done hit the door
And they got everybody on they hands and knees
And they ain't gonna leave until they find them keys

See powder gets you hyper, reefa makes you calm
Cigarettes give you cancer, woo woo's make you dumb
What you niggas know about the Dirty South?
What you niggas know about the Dirty South?"

To y'all ill-wishers who wanna take part
In me getting robbed, well follow ya heart
And I'll waste ya, hell, I raised ya

Chapter 13 Rich Man vs. Poor Man,Common,"['hip hop', 'jazz', 'blues', 'r&b', 'pop']","[Intro]
Let's talk about money
Ynot get the money
Common Sense want the money
Let's talk about money

[Common]
I be the one they call Petey
I'm Poe as Edgar Allan
But I'm a poet when I'm freestylin'

[Ynot]
Egad it is I, master Ynot, never the less
Fresh like air, well dressed, yes the LS is here
I appear on piers with my peers
The Imperial like margarine, I'm butter
Yes, fly like my Lear, I jet

[Common]
Lookin' at my fake Gucci, it's about that time
It's time for some percolator
I circulate around the block black
So give me a six-pack and a half of Harold's Chicken
A good combination
When I get bubbly, I do it in moderation
One brew, one brew, I said one brew at a time
[Ynot]
Well I'm a two timer of women that are three times a lady
May Sadie say Sade and may Ms. Goldberg say
""Yo Whoopie, there it is""
Call me E cause I equal MC squared
In the Biz, marks know I got the key, to get the girl's noses
Open like the vapors, more pub than the papers
More papers than the press, oh yes, I gets paid

[Common]
Yes, check it
I didn't grow grow up up po' po'
But once you get grown, and out on your own
Bills upon bills upon bills is what you have
Before you get your check then you already spend half
See I make money, money doesn't make me
I'm a reflection of my section and my section 8

[Ynot]
Enough
I own 8 sections of the world, where I'm sexin' 8 girls
To have them comin' in (ohhh yes) 8 seconds
I told Victoria her secret you suck, like Sucrets
I Ultrawhite my secretary, I went to Tibet
To bet on my horse you bet your life
Mine was better and now your deader
Than a (door knob) eah wrong
[Hook]
(Ynot) So what's your name?
(Common) I'm the Com, the broke Com Sense
And when I don't got scratch, I do feel tense
And if you givin' your papers to a broad you'se a dummy
(Ynot) Cause without no money
""Ain't a damn thing funny"" (3x)

[Ynot]
Rhymes I exchange like stock, I'm live like stock
I rock like Prudential, making (haha) from O
That's mucho dinero, like Robert De Niro
A robber's dinero, a hero like the sandwich
A Manwich has mills like Stephanie Mills, dills like pickles
I'm fancy, man, I tickles like the French
Not Johnny but like Bench I press on like Lee
I stan' like Lee, while you stagger like Lee
Most likely I'll dagger that bull-ish I pull ish like a magnet
Or Dragnet, I don't drag I gets net income
Yo, bums I rush like adrenaline
I'm royal when I flush, your highest hush'll get mushed
Like a sleigh dog, I slay dogs who are under me
I'm over men; call me Doberman, cause I'm a Pinscher of pennies
That's pretty, leave your city green from all the money I spent
I stay fresh like a mint from mint
I meant my mint, know what I mean? I'm nice
Real friendly like an officer, friendly and a gentleman
Friendly like neighbors, not Jim
But like Gomer I got piles of loot
Attention salute, I kill loot but won't dilute
Even if I threw garbage on the ground I couldn't pollute
Man, I'm too rich for that, bitch!
(Ynot got the money)

[Hook]
(Common) So what's your name?
(Ynot) I'm Ynot, I own a mansion and a yacht
I got essentials and credentials and honeys at my feet
And when I walk the street, I'm never lookin' bummy
(Common) Cause without the money
""Ain't a damn thing funny"" (5x)

[Common]
Ynot, let me tell ya a story
Okay it was a black man a white man and a Chinese man
The black man of course he was po' (yeah)
The white man, he was rich (uh-huh)
And the Chinese man, he owned a sto' (aight c'mon)
Okay the black man lived on Beat Street
The white man lived on Wall Street
And at the Chinese man's store is where they all meet
Not really on the good foot
Cause the white man kept steppin' on the black man's toes (damn!)
And in his shoes there were holes
But the white man didn't care, shit;
He didn't have to wear it (uh-uh)
The scratch that he had, he got from his parents
With his tight ass, he woulda been poor white trash, but anyway
Everyday the black man would ask him to spare change
But at him, the white man would stare strange
So the black man got fed up
Cause wasn't nobody feedin' him and feedin' him
And took red by his neck and started beatin' him and beatin' him
The Chinese man got 'noid and broke out like a peon
And now the black man own the store
And the name of it is Leon's
(...What's that?)
Barbecue, that is! (Oh...)
Rib tips, hotsauce, mild sauce, fries, and chicken

[Hook]
(Common) So what's your name?
(Ynot) I'm Ynot, I own a mansion and a yacht
I got essentials and credentials and honeys at my feet
And when I walk the street, I'm never lookin' bummy
(Common) Cause without the money
""Ain't a damn thing funny""
(Ynot) Now what's your name?
(Common) Well I'm the Com, the broke Com Sense
And when I don't got scratch, I do feel tense
And if you givin' your papers to a broad you'se a dummy

Doo Wop That Thing,Lauryn Hill,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Yo, remember back on the Bully
When cats used to harmonize like (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
Yo, yo, my men and my women
Don't forget about the deen
Sirat al-Mustaqeem
Yo, it's about a thing, uh, yo, yo
If ya feel real good wave your hands in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere!
(Put them up, put them up)
(Put them up, put them up)
(Put them up, put them up)

[Verse 1]
It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again
(A win win, come again
A win win, come again)
[Hook]
Guys, you know you'd better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

[Verse 2]
The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (like you got yen!)
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky, silent men
The punk, domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
Uh-uh, come again (Yeah)
Hey, yo-yo, come again
My French men, come again
My sister, come again

Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out

Class!
Hey, we’ve got some very intelligent women here, man
Do you think you’re too young to really love somebody?
(No! No, no, I don’t think so)
I say it for me, uh, I’m an adult I say, wait
“You’re too young to be in love, this is silly
You’re infatuated or whatever, you got nice jeans
You wear fancy Adidas”
I mean, it might be something I don’t know
(It's the difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody)
Well, you tell me. What’s the difference?
(Okay. You can love anybody but when you’re in love with somebody you’re looking at it like this—you’re taking that person for what he or she is no matter what he or she look like or no matter what he or she do)
(You’re crazy! You fall in love, you can fall out of love)
(You might stop being in love with them but you are not gonna stop loving that person)
(Maybe they ain’t never been loved before or been in love before, they don’t know what the feeling is to be loved)

She killed it, we could end that conversation with that, right?"

Uh!
And he never lies
And he never lies
Uh, yeah!

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
He just sits, and watches the people in the boxes
Everything he sees, he absorbs and adopts it
Mmm, he mimics and he mocks it
Really hates the box, but he can't remember how to stop it
Uh, so he continues to watch it
Hoping that it'll give him something that he can box with
Or how to locksmith, see, the box is locked in a box
Ain't got the combination to unlock it
That's why he watches, scared to look away
Cause at that moment, it might show him
What to take off the locks with
So he chained himself to the box, took a lock and then he locked it
Swallowed the combination and then forgot it
As the doctors jot it all down with they pens and pencils
The same ones that took away his voice
And just left this instrumental like that
[Chorus: Jonah Matranga and Lupe Fiasco]
And he never lies (He never lies, he never lies, uh)
And he never lies (Uh, he never lies, he never lies, no)
And he never lies (He never lies)
Cause he never said anything at all

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
He just sits, and listens to the people in the boxes
Everything he hears, he absorbs and adopts it
Anything not coming out the box, he blocks it
See, he loves the box and hope they never stop it
Anything the box tell him to do, he does it
Anything it tell him to get, he shops and he cops it
He protects the box, locks it in a box
When he goes to sleep, but he never sleeps
Cause he stays up to watch it, scared to look away
Cause at that moment, it might get stolen
And that's the last of the boxes
So he chained himself to the box, took a lock and then he locked it
Swallowed the combination and then forgot, it
As the doctors jot it all down with they pens and pencils
The same ones that took away his voice
And just left this instrumental, like that

Yo I'm hot like 95 Fahrenheit
On a summer night, tight spot where bodies rot
Rats drink from water drops, in the streets niggas
Little kids scared cops, wit red dots
Philosophical gangsta, wit violent priors
Goin' back like black and white TV's wit pliers
Leanin' on broke down cars, wit flat tires
Flash iron, anybody tryin' on, the blocks I'm supplyin' on
Madicon, my peeps, tie ballons up
And swallow 'em and the P now got goons, lots of 'em
Cops see them and run, don't want no drama
Certain parts of the streets, the beast don't want a part of
Martyr, hood haunted like the Dakota
Where John Lennon was shot up, but he sang for peace
He begged for freedom, hanged wit wild Jamicians
From Kingston, who drink Irish Malts
Listenin to Peter Winston, Machintosh
Lightning hits the top of the church steeple
When I'm writin', semi-automatic no hyphen
It's frightening.... {*scratches*}

I take summers off, cause I love winter beef
Started '87, wit the shotty in the sheep
Three-quarter length beige, dressed to kill
Bust a shell at the ground, pellets hit the crowd
Nobody like a snitch, everybody shut they mouth
Woolrich, Carhartt, gun powder stains
Smellin' like trees, sensimille on the brain
Skeemin' on ya girls, bambooze or ya chain
Got ill up on the train, twistin' off a cap
Of a English in my vain, might of pushed you on the tracks
Deaf crack fiends, who can't speak, scream noises
Cause she bought a jum of soap, from one of my boys and, it's
.... Just another day in the hood
And I'm, wit some wild brothers, up to no good
We saw the movies, like Tony Montana, and 'em
But our style was let them pile then, we robbin' 'em
Money dudes, make 'em come up out they shoes
Run they jewels, word is bond, where my man Nino goin'
And I had to make a song, speakin on my old life
For the thief's who come out at night

Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
'Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em (You don't need him)
You know what makes me unhappy? (What's that?)
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman (Yeah, yeah)
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
(Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?)
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't, we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies (Oh, yeah-yeah)
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up
[Chorus: Dave Hollister]
(Keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
(Oh-oh, keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter

[Verse 2: 2Pac & Dave Hollister]
Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right (Oh, yeah-yeah)
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay your rent
And in the end, it seems I'm headin' for the pen'
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night, my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity (Oh, no, no, no)
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up, huh
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
Said it ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy, huh
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive 'cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up
[Chorus: Dave Hollister]
(Keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
(Oh-oh, keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter

[Verse 3: 2Pac & Dave Hollister]
And, uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more (Oh-oh)
'Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain, you was dealt this hell of a hand
Without a man, feelin' helpless (I know you were)
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless
While the tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You're steady hopin' things don't all fall this week (Yeah)
'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it (Yeah)
And don't blame me, I was given this world, I didn't make it (Oh, yeah)
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends (Oh, yeah)
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up
But, huh, please, you got to keep your head up"

Rob

[Verse 1: Robin Thicke & Lil Wayne]
I heard some shouts, like, ""Down on the floor"" (Baow)
Then even louder, ""We got shooters"" (Yeah), shooters (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
I turned around, I was starin' at chrome (Hello)
Shotgun watches door, got security good (Check)
Jumped right over counter, pointed gun at, wink
He tell her, ""I'm your shooter, shooter, shooter"" (Let's go)

And to the radio stations, I'm tired of bein' patient
Stop being rapper racists, region haters
Spectators, dictators, behind door dick takers, it's outrageous
You don't know how sick you make us
I wanna throw it up like chips in Vegas
But this is Southern, face it
If we too simple, then y'all don't get the basics

My reply was simply, ""Pow,"" c'mon

Now let's get down to business, bitches!
'Cause it seems like y'all just keep on tryin' to diss this
Nigga that you know that's been down for years
I've clowned for years, and y'all could never fade my peers
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
Nine, ten—Eiht, you can't win
'Cause all the way around, nigga, I gets respect
And you's a nigga that can't even get no props in yo' set
Tragniew Park you say, huh?
Wanna be rippin', but now it's time to do some set trippin'
So listen close, 'cause I don't want y'all to miss
That I'm 'bout to break it down for this bitch, check it
Acacia, Poplar, Maple, Spruce, Cedar, Elm
Westside Trees sprayin' all the fleas
That's from the three and four hundred block P-Funk riders
(So niggas watch yo' ass at that center divider *gun blast*)
Now Aaron Tyler, tell my why you seem so tame
When I caught you at the airport, shakin' like a crap game
You looked up and you seen my niggas comin'
And you looked like yo' bitch-ass was 'bout to start runnin'
But all I wanted to do was kick a little conversation
(Yo, whatup?) And see if we can fix this little situation
But would I fuck you up was what you wondered
Yeah, that's probably why you
Changed your little pager number (punk-ass!)
But bitches like you don't grow
You can't even look me in my eye, let alone go toe to toe
And callin' me skinny, you's a clown
I'ma call you Theo 'cause you weigh 92.3 pounds
Wack-ass actor, movie script killer
Fool, don't you know? Quik is still the nigga
Compton psycho, boy, you oughta quit
Your records don't hit, and bitches don't jock your shit
You need to stay down, you Compton clown
And get off of the nuts of the niggas with guts
Because I'm down with the Trees, I'm down with Death Row
I'm down with Black Tone, and I'm down with the fo'
So when we cross paths and I hope that's soon
I'ma boot yo' mothafuckin' ass to the Moon
You need to quit bangin' under false pretense
'Cause if don't make dollars, it don't make sense
[Hook]
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
Because you gotta give it up to the crown prince

[Verse 2]
Now I'ma swing it to the right and
Right into the left hand
Take a deep breath and
Cook it like a chef and
This is dedicated to the C-P-T
No, better yet T-T-P, or the niggas that look up to me
I make it my business to be that true forever
And whenever I can come clever, well, that's my endeavor
So whether or not you understand
That there's only one DJ Q-U-I-K
With no C still you can't be me
Because I'm floatin' in my Lex and
Depositin fat checks and
Gettin' mad sex while I floss the NSX and
Doin' what I wanna, and you's a goner, nigga
For thinkin' that you can catch me slippin' on a street corner
Remember Compton's in the house, and Quik is in the hood
Sippin' 'Yac with all my niggas 'cause it's to the good
So don't knock it 'til you try it
'Cause Eiht, he tried to knock it
But he's still walkin' round with my nuts in his pocket
So put the P in it, represent and sip that Miller
And for those of y'all concerned, this is still Eiht Killa
Let me take a load off my scrotum, little pest
If it don't make dollars, nigga, you know the rest

So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense

Now I done sold my fuckin' soul to the shit that I kick
While you groupie-ass niggas keep on ridin' the dick
You oughta know that DJ Quik
Ain't your average everyday motherfucker (hah)
Slick like a snake 'cause I stuck ya
Now, I never had my dick sucked by a man befo'
But you gon' be the first, you little trick-ass ho
Then you can tell me just how it taste
But before I nut I shoot some piss in your face
You fuckin' coward, tremblin' like a nervous wreck
'Cause when I caught yo' ass, you put yourself in check
And when you left my presence you left speedin'
You ain't no fuckin' killer, you's a comedian, biatch!
Tell me why you act so scary
Givin' your set a bad name with your misspelled name
E-I-H-T, now should I continue?
Yeah, you left out the G 'cause the G ain't in you
Remember that time you was rollin' on the Westside
And a little brown bucket pulled up on your side
Caught at that light in your Camry in the midst of a real killer
Tell me, did you feel a little nervous? (hell yeah)
You was in the shadow of death
With two trey-five-sevens pointed at your chest
Hmm, whatchu gon' do? Where was your niggas that kill at?
You ain't got no killers, so kill dat!
Holdin' up your hands and beggin for a pass
You lucky they didn't just to get to dumpin' on yo' ass
'Cause this game you think is funny is some real shit
So you need to be more careful who you fuckin' wit, biatch!

If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense

Shouts goes out to my well-known road dog
What's up Donzelle Tru?
They don't understand it, baby, they can't fade us out here on these Compton streets (biatch!)
It's bigger than they can imagine
To the whole entire Death Row family
Both sides, whassup, niggas?
And my nigga big Suge, known for keepin' shit poppin'
To my nigga Big J, my little nigga Hi-C, little straight G
And that little singin'-ass nigga Danny Boy
Y'all don't understand, y'all can't fade this

I'm so happy

[Verse 1: Big Gipp]
My Grand be gone after a 103 years of blood sweat and pain
And never complained
The last words that the nurse heard was the song she sang
Died tired of this living thing
Most I knew never made it to drinking age
Sometimes I fight Gipp
Should I spend or should I hold on for what tomorrow brings
Fly ain't that roll egg, so many lips in my head
Seeing some act up from one taste out the cup
Can't build me up to cut me down
Gipp is in your game, but Gipp won't play your game
In the day after...

I been this way since birth
Heaven upon sent a newborn to tell it like he see it
No lies thru the eyes of an angel suggest you don't table
Every angle be obtuse, ain't no truce, it's war
It won't stop, to compromise wouldn't stop the bloodsheddin'
It's Armageddon in the streets of each inner city
Ain't takin' no pity on this unjust callin' it trust
I'm on the bus starin' out of a window
Thankin' 'bout them happy days I had
Over the summer growin' up fast to face life and harsh realities
That come wit the territody didn't know when I was young
So many get hung to hang
Take away the bad and bring back
The good that die mostly over bullshit
Takin' a gun and pulled it on an innocent friend of mine
That could have been yours
How can I stop the war and all the crime inside the minds that's
Programmed to destroy
From the beginning when will it end...
On the day after judgement will I be ready

Gotta pay for restitution with heavily on my mind
Free fom mental debris hose me down
There my physical trame lay returnin' to its rightful place
A quest for forgiveness answer...
The death toll talley but my soul was spared
How is your prepared medium rare if you dare disobey
Well done race you the last one to orion star
Smellin' like shit in a glass jar
The bomb light years away from earth secure a space for my family
The mother of my first conceived and all the weak relatives
I hurt only...when I laugh
On display afta judge none careless atmosphere
Opportunity knockin' answer it knewin you would
Good thangs come to those dat wait...
Took a los on church strait
The nifty fifth whut better place
Fo' mo enenmy to hide than behind religion
Done gee seen on I pray for you but I won't follow you to yo end

I know of a place not too far away
That maybe you and I can both go someday
But I gotta make sure cause I ain't tryin' to stay here
Don't y'all realize that the end is so near
But don't have fear cause you still got time
I hope you wanna come when I'm done with the rhyme
Let me explain so you won't claim you didn't know
And you can make sure that this is where you wanna go
It's all about preparing yourself for the return
And a trip to your soul is the only way you'll learn
But if you choose not to go that ain't my concern
I guess in hell you'll just have to burn
The devil tell lies and try to trick yo soul to receive it
They tell you that my Lord ain't coming' back and you believe it
Regardless if you listen to me
In the end we'll see...

Thirty-five cents to my name and that's fo' a blunt man
The way thangs goin' today I might as well be dead, so dread
The voices on the radio got me seamed
Can't put a smile on my face cuz my pockets ain't straight
At least not the way I want 'em to be
Early as phuckk, eight fifty-one
Last night I barely got some Z's ... sleep...uh
I can't ol' Burd in the next room havin' nightmares
It sound like wind blowin' when she weep, speak

Y'all scared to come near it, you ignore the voice
In your head when you hear it
The enemy is after yo' spirit but you think it's all in yo' mind
You'll find a lot of the reason we behind
Is because the system is designed to keep our third eyes blind
But not blind in the sense that our other two eyes can't see
You just end investing quality time in places you don't even neeed to be
We don't even know who we are, but the answer ain't far
Matter of fact its right up under our nose
But the system taught us to keep that book closed
See the reason why he gotta lie and deceive is so
That we won't act accordingly
To get the blessings we suppose to receive
Yeah it's true, Uncle Sam wants you to be a devil too
See, he's jealous because his skin is a curse but what's worse
Is if I put it in a verse y'all listen to some bullshit first
We ain't natural born killas, we are a spiritual people
God's chosen few
Think about the slave trade when they had boats with
Thousands of us on board
And we still was praising the Lord now you ready to die
Over a coat, a necklace round your throat, that's bullshit
Black people ya'll better realize, we losin, you better god damn fight and die

Everyone call me man
Taylor Gang or die
And this project is brought to you by
Champagne and paper planes too
Rostrum Records in this bitch
Taylor Gang, Heavy Hustle, Deal or No Deal
Yeah, bitch

[Verse 1]
I'm screaming fuck them niggas who hated
I'm money affiliated
Speculating me landing
Must have got me mistaken with lame niggas
Know you gon' get high as fuck
As long as the planes with you
Left that major situation alone
And became richer
People talking down
But see me I'm the same nigga
Leave your bitch around
We gon' drink the champagne with her
We don't touch the ground
See a cloud with my name it
Only e-z widers please
No cigars for me and my gang
Fool, I'm a legend in these streets
Cause how I do my thang
And don't wear the fitted
I got the city on my chain
Oh man, still they hate and talk smack
Knowing if I was gone
There'd be no throne to throw your rocks at
Cruise at maximum altitudes
I'm tryna top that
So in touch with the real
Them suckas tryna stop that
But I, live or let die, party get high
And tell them lames to deplane or let fly
[Hook]
Don't know what they hate for
I'm just gettin' my paper
Well, maybe they'll love me more when I'm gone
I don't wanna leave, but I need to, it's such a shame
They gon' miss this plane
They gon' miss this plane
They gon' miss this plane
They gon' miss this plane
I try to believe you
I don't wanna leave but I need to

[Verse 2]
Stuck alone in this wave race
Say I'm living too fast
Don't plan on changing my pace
Got one foot on the gas
There's never a need for brakes
Smoke e-z widers with hash
Fuck bitches from out of state
Valet bringing my cars
A waiter to bring me plates
Shrimp and filet mignon
We celebrate buying drinks
With a couple of broads
My niggas and who got love for me
It's lonely at the top
I'm tired of having company
Uh, so while you busy trying to fit in
I'mma stand out
And view my life through this lens
To see how it pans out
Substitute teacher ass niggas need a handout
Middle finger, screaming fuck them niggas who hated
I'm money affiliated
Pop another bottle, that chronic smoke integrated
Speculating me landing, must've got me mistaken
I'm speaking as the captain of the plane
You's a runner on the jet way
Fool
[Hook]
Don't know what they hate for
I'm just gettin my paper
Well, maybe they'll love me more when I'm gone
I don't wanna leave, but I need to, it's such a shame
They gon' miss this plane
They gon' miss this plane
They gon' miss this plane
They gon' miss this plane
I try to believe you
I don't wanna leave but I need to"

Hello, what it be
To you and yours

Salutations to all, you can call me Cudi
Or Mr. Extravagant 'cause I'm getting my money
Way my doors are swayin', it's like a bird on wheels
You can come to Ohio and you can see how it feels
And this the premier of that new-new here
It's gonna take you beyond
Where a jet can't Lear
But all you gon' hear
Is somethin' crazy in fact
How I be burnin' the booth
We'll get you looser than Yak
Yep-yep, you got it right
Now don't get left
Get on your good foot
It's only right that you step
And keep boppin' to this shit unfamiliar
If your main line got time then I be drillin' her
I keep you in my realm
I keep you in the sound
I keep myself up high
Because the haze by the pound
And my imagination
You can look all over the nation
But they ain't see

You can look all over

Hot shit like mine

Hot shit like mine

[Verse 2]
Salutations my niggas
I'm aware that I'm different
You can still keep it hood
While you're smokin' just listen
It don't matter your race
Just take a blunt to the face
And we all gon' rock
Got to keep up the pace
And them girls gon' twerk
Because the vibe is poppin'
As well as the bottles
Keep it rockin', don't stop 'em
At the Motel-8
We can park out front
Yeah the flow is unleaded
You sucka niggas will front
'Cause I'm Super-Cudder-Realistic-Leaner-Alidocius
And rap ferocious
I been coaching the league
I bobble head the public
If you love it, M dub it
Blood, sweat, and tears; homie, I'm made of it
Finish the class if you think nothing 'bout it
Tell 'em like grandpa, you don't know nothing 'bout it
Wear kicks once, then the Leaner come up out 'em
I been sayin' it, you was playin' him
Now you know

[Verse 3]
What it be to my ladies
With the bodies that kill
We ain't boppin' on money
Fuck with me 'cause you real
See you shakin' it fast
On some Mystical shit
You could slap that nigga
If he call you a bitch
Yeah I see you with that
But you should be on this
It's that Henney and Coca-Cola
Come over and sit
Won't you tell me your name
Tell me where you be at
I know you know that them hot
But I don't wanna hear that
You see I aim for a check
Before I aim for sex
Niggas aim for death
They tryin' to fuck with the blessed
Ain't no fuckin' with amateurs
Run passed the novice
Sip hella lean
To see who talks the slowest
Ain't no stoppin' me at all
You'd need a sawed-off, or maybe a chainsaw
And even at that
The crack that I brew is still new
Y'all niggas think acute
But Cudi is obtuse

Aye, knock knock, bang bang, where the cash at?

Come up swinging at you thugs Aflac
Then I fall in the suede black Maybach
See, I'm back for the money like I left that
See I be running on the route where the cash go (where the cash go)
And any nigga interfering with the cash flow
See, you can get pumped on like a Citgo
Make his body bounce bounce like a 64
Tall clips, chrome lips, see the big gold
I'm a duffle bag boy like I move coke
Big crack through the music so the flow dope
I keep my money over bitches til the door close
I need money like a bitch need dick mo'
I'm trying to see it like a motherfucking cash flow
Rubber bands in my pants, understand, bankroll

And where my money? Young nigga's gotta have that
Rubber bands by the grands in a big bag
Pockets fat like I'm carrying a backpack
A couple grand for the Louis band knapsack
Understand I'm the man who you can't match
Money man minivan full of brown bags
Bet a grand, any man never top that
Touch money and the gat pop those straps
Get in the Coupe and the top drop right back
I ain't playing, creep your avenue and I'll blast
Bust shots like a New Year's Day blast
And I ride all day like a bus pass
Grinding hard for the bread and the cash flow
Kick doors, wave 4's, where the cash go (where the cash go)

Momma dead broke, daddy fucked up
I'ma make them come and hit me with the RICO
God damn it, I'm still in the dope spot

Gold shoes, stepping out with a dope bitch

They know where Carter at, straight off the launchin' pad
Marchin' on the moon motherfucker, I been to Mars and back
Cleaner than laundry mats, jumpin' in somethin' from
Other countries, companies, junkie, you cannot order that
I flew that and took the water back, order, go to Iraq
And get a car with gas and tell them crackers, ""War with that""
All I need is an automatic: tick, boom
I'm a goon, I go zoom; smell the fumes from the vrooms
Young Tune in the room, gimme room or you doomed

I would never be another groom unless I assume

Sorry world, but my mommy dropped me where the clinic be
So if you tried to mimic me, you'd prob'ly catch some sick disease
Six degrees, leanin' on that prometha-tha-tha-thazine
I'm a centipede, these men move at women speed
I'm 'bout my spinach, cheese, dough, cheddar, fetti, gwap
Money, moolah, mozzarella, et cetera, et cetera
Fuck competitors, fuck these rappers, fuck these editors
Fuck the head of the state, fuck the gates surroundin' the prisoners
These motherfuckers the prey; I'm the Predator, see me dreadlock
Tough as Bamm-Bamm from Bedrock
I'm tied to the game like wedlock, say ""Hello red dot""
Say ""Goodbye life"" and say ""Hello Satan""
A devil in the flesh, a rebel at its best, no complainin'

That's right, bwoy, it's goin' on, right here
Thug Life, God bless the dead

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
God bless the dead and buried, nigga, don't worry
If you see God first, tell him shit got worse
I ain't mad, I know you representin' the crew
And I can picture you in heaven with a blunt and a brew
Fuck the world, pain was a part of the game
If you a baller, money went as quick as it came
My role models gone or they locked in the pen
Straight hustlers caught up in the whirlwind
The other day I thought I seen my homeboy Biggy
Sayin' shit don't stop, nigga, no pity
We all hoods and all we ever had was dreams
Money makin' motherfuckers plot scandalous schemes
In the gutter you learn to have a criminal mind
I was addicted to tryin', never meant to do time
My epitaph will read ""was the last of G's""
Kicked the shit to make the white man bleed
God bless the dead
[Hook: 2Pac]
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Man, ain't nobody promised me a thang
I been caught up in this game
Ever since I was a little motherfucker wantin' to hang
I can see 'em in my head – pow!
Memories of my nigga but he dead now
Lookin' back in my yearbook
All the years took half my peers, they're stretched for years
And if I die, will they all shed tears?
Two to the dome, leave me alone, let me get my head clear
Paranoia got me lookin' in the mirror
Behind me, life without my 9, I'd rather do the time
See, I'm old enough to know that ain't no justice
[Fuck the police] and all the courts same way they fucked us
And why the hell am I locked in jail?
They let them white boys free, we be shocked as hell
In my mind I can see it comin'
And all the time it's a plot to keep a nigga runnin'
I keep a gun and never run unless I'm comin' at ya
Cry later but for now let's enjoy the laughter
God bless the dead
[Hook: 2Pac]
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead

Rest in peace to all the motherfuckers that passed too early
All the young motherfuckers that was took in they prime
Real motherfuckin' G's, this one is for you
Yo Stretch, Biggy
Yo Big, this is to you, my nigga
Springfield Hollis Crew, Thug Life, YG'z
Sendin' they respect, ya know what I mean?
You my nigga for life, forever
You're always gonna be with a nigga
No matter what, don't forget that!

[Verse 3: Stretch]
I pray before I go to sleep, ""Dear God!""
Say my grace before I start to eat, 'cause times is hard
So I'm droppin' to my knees, ""Oh why!""
Why you had to take my nigga with the rock-a-bye?
You had to take a good one, a ghetto hood son, Uzi weighin' a ton
Niggas terrified of drama from the young gun
Hearin' that they did it outta fear don't amaze me
But it's mind-blowin' so I'm flowin' goin' crazy
Slipped, forgot the gun, but he didn't run like a punk
He shoulda had the gauge in the trunk
But spunk is what he had, kid, I'd rather attack Big
Now you 'bout to smell the aftermath of what the mag did
Wannabe suckas wanna test, I'm tellin' you, yes
The teflon's 'bout to rip through your fuckin' vest
Guess who? I'll make a mess of your crew quick
The spirit Biggy Smallz and the thuggin' clique, yeah

Breathe Easy Lyrical Exercise,JAY-Z,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
So I had to memorize these rhymes until I got home, you understand?
So, and they'll do— you know
Once you memorize a sentence, it's like an exercise
Y'all niggas can't be serious right now
I'm the all-time heavyweight champion of flowers
I'm leading the league in at least six statistical categories right now
Best flow, most consistent, realest stories
Most charisma
I set the most trends
And my interviews are hotter
Holla

[Verse 1]
I jog in the graveyard, spar in the same ring
That was housed by the building where Malcolm X was slain
I spring train in the winter, 'round early December
Run suicide drills over and over
With the weight of the world on my shoulder
That's why they call me Hova
I'm far from being God, but I work goddamn hard
I wake up the birds, so when the nerds asleep
I'm catching my second wind the second the first one ends
I am focused, man, and I'm not afraid of death
I'm going all out, I circle the vultures in a van and
I run the block (Run), pull up in a drop (Pull up)
Push up on my money (Push up), I'm in great shape, dunny (Woo)
I keep jacks jumping, thirty-six sets
Like a personal trainer, I teach coke to stretch
I pump in Roc sweats, all-white trainers
The ghetto's Billy Blanks, I show you niggas what pain is
Maintain your stamina, Hov will damage ya
Spot you two rhymes, y'all niggas is amateurs
The fifth a deadlift
If niggas don't wanna get shot, then y'all niggas better squat
I drop your set for rep
No need to hit the showers, the spit from the fifth leave you wet
Lyrical exercise
Y'all niggas ain't tired, right?

One, one, two, two, three, three, four

Suckers, get your weight up (Uh), not your hate up
Jigga Man is diesel when I lift the eight up
Y'all ain't ready to workout with the boy
Your flow is brain on drugs, mines is rap on steroids
I lift every voice when I sing, my ability
Make yours look like an exercise in futility (Woo)
Bring your squad, biceps, triceps, and quads
We don't struggle with undeveloped muscles
Y'all ain't real, that's y'all Achilles' heel
Same routine when you see me, you know the drill
I spot ya
I lift the weight of the watch off your arm, remain nice and calm
Put down your things
Trinidad of the game, know my way around your ring
No matter how many pounds you bring
It sounds like the same old thing
R-O-C is the strongest team, fuckers

One, one, two, two, three, three, four

Still saggin in my crispy Dickies
But my gangsta's fly, I make sho' the wrist is extra crystal-y
Cock it on the side for the next telly is
Ghetto nigga on Lambo's mailin list
Money don't make you rich
But it's funny how it'll make a snow bunny suck your dick
I have a hater in the shrubs where you park your shit
I had a homie blowin you up when he hit the fence
To the Steady, Slick bring the gangsta shit
Like the hankerchief, once you add on the Paisley print
On the rights where I dang a lick
But since I learned red and blue make green it's Tek hits

[Hook]

[Krondon]
It's the premier kids cast to build the pyramids
A '08 Escalade's in prepaid appearances
It's hard to even entertain a few, an invalid
Lame in the brain can't talk or remember shit
I don't blame him - the daddy ain't around
Left him lonely in the hood without good home trainin
Frustrated, pissed cause probation
Got him pissin in a cup without proper occupation
So they - get up, get out, and get it like Goodie Mob
Niggas must be crazy thinkin we won't do the job
Dookie colored droptops sob, with the feet tall
Hi-Tek beats bump from Lynn Street to Crenshaw
Steady means stupid stand up, start elevatin
Violate and come to your final destination
Mouth{?} pacin - Pacific Ocean main land
Chasin retail, re-up in rotation

Super Supreme,The Lady of Rage,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Now I be drilling emcees
When my lyrics spill like Valdez, oil
Bubble and toil, the brew without the bitches
I'm wicked as the witches
Hitting hard as switches
Once again, Ms. Big Britches
I'm putting my weight down
Who's gonna take down, one hundred seventy-five
Break a sucker down to dust, ah-hah
Do what I must *inhale* oooh what a rush
Now hush, someone's calling my name (RAAAAAGE!)
The only girl to knock you out the frame
Call me Mrs. Butter-cause-I'm-worth it, I work shit
Overtime, definitely blow your mind
When the instruments become mental (I what?)
I flow through the dental frame, cock back and take aim
All you cavity creeps, the baddest to be
Start static with me, it's definite catastrophe on MC's
Sheeeyit, Super Supreme
When it's time to let off steam, I'm a microphone fiend
'phone fiend, Super Supreme, Afro Queen
Ahh..
Now.. I..
Breaks them down to their very last compound
When I come stompin on the ground
My territory, I mark it
Like dogs pissin on trees, umm, don't piss me off because
(why?) I might go off baby
Flow from the larynx
Take a puff and blow MC's like clarinets
I ride beats like a Yama'
Cause more drama than your baby's momma, PAUSE like comma, HAH
Right in your face it's, live and direct, the
Lyrical murderer, you best +Protect Ya Neck+
You can Inspectah Deck over the hills
I don't fake Jacks, I'm not yo' everyday Jill

I, shoot the gift, more swifter than Kris Kringle
You talk about, gettin with me, miss me
Cause you'll be left misty blue
Shit your drawers, piss em too, HEYYYYY
Suckers get dumped in my dungeon
MC's hard as tress, but I'mma play Paul Bunyan
Chop chop, like an axe, my vocals stickin like thumbtacks
Ha hah hah, don't try to mock me cause my voice is on wax
It's, fireproof and that's the God's honest truth
Hard as a brick (*UTFO sample*) ""Bite it!"" and it'll break your tooth
Or teeth chief, and that's the end of the beef, chew it
Cause I don't see a damn thing that you can do with it
Sheeyit, Super Supreme
When it's time to let off steam, I'm a microphone fiend
'phone fiend, Super Supreme hah, Afro Queen
Ahh.. definitely rough..
Now I gets sick like chlamydia from here to Syria
Drip burnin lyrics like venereal diseases
Strategic procedures (done at the what) done at the leisure
More +Flavor+ than Khadeija, inject you with my anaesthesia
Break them down to one cell like an amoeba
ARRI-VAH.. derci, you crab MC's irk me (ungule vato) but
I'm known as a heavyweight, my grandmother
Told me to clean everything off my plate when I ate, so I
Crunch'n'Munch, on you suckers out to lunch
Definitely hittin em with the hardness
That'll leave em all punch drunk, uh-huh
I'm rated top choice
With a grip on the mic like Royce Gracy
Ultimate champion, stand +Alone+ like +Acey+
Takes me about a sec to catch wreck (so what?)
So you can play like Rex and go fetch cause I'm too high tech
So once again (UHHHH!) let's break it down to the nitty
You used to be the shit, but now you're just plain SHITTY
Hah, now, I leave you, with a mouth full of lumps

Ladies,Lakim Shabazz,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Lakim Shabazz]
Time to jam, I got about grand ready to splurge
Suddenly I got the urge to watch some bodyslam
Ready to go clubs-hoppin', my pockets full of money
And I'm feelin' real funny
[?] figure eights in the place cold stun me
Then I got approached by this light skinned honey
Said, ""Don't look surprised, see, I know who you are
Let's separate here and have a drink at the bar
My name's Sexy Betsy, you are a rap star
You got it goin' on, I think you're gonna go real far""
Tried to flatter me, said my lips look sweet
And juicy, ""And I bet it takes like a peach
What do you think?"" I said, ""Sex on the Beach""
A few more looks, I had her hooked like a leech
Five minutes we hung out, honey girl strung out
Now I could've took honey girl home without a doubt
She start to stare, run my fingers all through her hair
You know what happened? A patch of it came out
I was surprised, didn't wanna believe
That my hand had to feel honey girl's hair weave
So I chilled, I didn't get ill or rowdy
Said, ""See ya baby, I'm Audi like gowdy""
Thought it was real but it was fake, see, I was blind
You never know what you find
Dealin' with
[Chorus]
Ladies
Got to have you lady, you sexy baby
Ladies
Bamboo earrings and things like that don't phase me
Ladies
Yes, I'm speakin' to the fly women of the world, peep it out
Ladies
Gimme a lady anytime and keep the fly girls

[Verse 2: Lakim Shabazz]
I like ladies that's light skinned, brown skinned
The tone of skin to me makes no difference
I don't understand why some brothers frown
When they're approached by a woman who's dark or brown skinned
Some light skinned women think they're too good
Stay in the mirror all day and they think that they should
Find a man who's much more darker than them
Why choose your man by the color of skin?
I don't front, I tell straight facts
What I say has a very strong impact
I want you to know the eight shades of yellow
Eight shades of brown and it equals 16 shades of black
You need to wise up, cut out the bull crap
Whoever told you that need to be slapped
I don't smoke dust, not on a pipe or crack
The color of your skin to me doesn't mean jack
Because I know the right way to angle you
Most women are swift and changeable
Listen up laides, see, I got a thing for you
So now I'ma [?] a few
Because I think it's 'bout time I let you know
I'm into women, but I'm not a superhoe
They're so mysterious, there's somethin' about 'em
You can't live 'em and I can't live without 'em
[Chorus]
Ladies
Got to have you lady, you sexy baby
Ladies
Bamboo earrings and things like that don't phase me
Ladies
Yes, I'm speakin' to the fly women of the world, peep it out
Ladies
Gimme a lady anytime and keep the fly girls
Break it down

[Verse 3: Lakim Shabazz]
Get on the dance floor, make sure you don't trip
Don't front now, I see you're pluckin' those lips
Get a grip on a groove and don't slip
Shake it all around and roll your hips
Hourglass bodies that look sexy, sassy
I'm the type that won't let a honey pass me
I'm not a dog, my name's not Lassie
Every once in a while I feel kinda nasty
Cool and calm, composure's kept
But some honeys think I'm only out to get my thing wet
My main goal is to control your soul
On the dancefloor 'cause like Keith, I'll make you sweat
Because you're so tender
Leavin' me breathless, so this message I send ya
They're so mysterious, there's somethin' about 'em
You can't live 'em and I can't live without
[Chorus]
Ladies
Got to have you lady, you sexy baby

Bamboo earrings and things like that don't phase me

Yes, I'm speakin' to the fly women of the world, peep it out

Gimme a lady anytime and keep the fly girls

[Outro]
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?
This is how I feel about you ladies in the '90s
'Cause y'all so sweet and tender
So I had to kick one out for you, yeah
This is Lakim Shabazz in full effect, 1990

I talk shit like my shit dont stink
I don't front like I'm rich,I don't rock no link
I never, puff piff, and my clothes ain't pink
I ain't a punk ain't a pimp but I walk with a limp
Im real cool, educated but never graduated school
I was a little kid on Ritalin that was ridiculed
Most rappers yall put on pedestals are pitiful
Myspace pedophiles, completely predicable
Pick apart my flow pattern completely invincible
Try to read off the notebook the words are invisible
Visualize this if you can invision
Spitting so precise its like Christ has arisen when he writes
Alright, alright, I let ya catch up
This ain't nothing but a button to make ya self destruct
Structure strategies
Suckers get stripped quicker than whips in the hood
So get going while the going is good
And if ya didn’t ya should
Shut up and open ya ears
Spit out a flow so fierce every foe disappears
I been ferocious for years, so fuck ya bogus careers
Yall got it popping, well nobody even notice ya here
You like mosquitoes in ears, buzzing but swiftly get swatted
As quick as I’m spotted these muthafuckas pussies are clotted
You get it you got it, you got me so the chicks be exotic
Even my peoples up in boston say I’m simply retarded
Pumping that hydroponic, aquatic fluid, the speakers blewing
Shit I speak is deep as druids, im street, and speaking fluent
Influence like influenza when I spread in ya centre
This menace will send a sickness up in ya bitches placenta
So suckers surrender
With different rapper, chicken macka, trick attracter
Old school muthafuckers be like listen to the whippersnapper!
Bitch attacker, dick her after, hang her from the kitchen rafter
Chip stacker, click clacker nobody can spit it badder
Kill that chitter chatter throw some blows and ya chin’ll shatter
There ain't been a sicker cracker since Serch or Mr. Mathers
It’s the baddest average, ap’s after star status
So he gases up the masses then its ashes to ashes
Now let me breath on it, kill mc’s on it
Fuck ya girlfriends face and blow seeds on it
Yall musta really got it twisted thinking ap’s so chill
You see that sign up ahead? welcome to assholeville
Im in a whip blowing donuts, with two ho sluts blowing both nuts
My girl hear this, she gonna go nuts
Im easy e, loeced up, im bobby brown coked up
Fucking Jessica Simpson after her and Nick broke up
Im sittin on the border of heaven and hell
Praying to god and Satan at the same time so records will sell
With every breath I exhale
Another crucifix nail, is impaled just to make certain I failed
But I ain't stopping til I’m dropping that’s just simply not an option
Get it popping or im pumpin' oxyconton in Wisconsin
I rap and produce to
A felon and boost to
Beileve me cause cd's ain't sellin like they used to
Believe me coz CD’s ain't selling like they used to…"

Motivated to win, like I ain't won yet

Tonight it's goin down like free fall

Doing that shit to demean Dogg
But when I bring it to you, you be like ""What you mean Dogg?""
Then we go back and forth, like it's ping-pong
Knowin I should just ring ya bell, ding dong!
But that's one thing about this shit partner
Every move is so watched by these rich boxers
So why should I lose all my rich sponsors?
I'm gone then you suddenly hip-hoppin?
Sheeit, sip the gin then I'm in the wind
Pop a beam like a M&M
So strong yet a nigga thin
Rappers stay sayin Slim so Shady but ain't talkin Eminem
So fuck you, him, and him
I was gangbangin befo' a nigga entered in
No facade, I went from the yard
To a three-car garage to, instant menage it's
Vintage, relentless, I mean this, I promise
No Suge, No Dre, I'da did this regardless
And thats what I'm supposed to think
Flinch at me like I'm supposed to blink

Ponytail still swangin, hair still braided
Laker to a Clipper I won't be faded

Look, this is me, still the same
They want the hits, I play the game
No auto-tune, but you can feel the pain
It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein
What up, Lil Bro? What up, Slum Ville?
I hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still
The fans thinking that we all signed for one mil
Equal opportunity rapping, that shit is unreal
That ain't how it works, that ain't how it goes
And I been getting high just to balance out the lows
And I could use a writer just to balance out my flows
But I never share my thoughts, this is all a nigga knows
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes
These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised
And I would be performing this as long as I'm alive
So every word I utter will be mine
[Chorus]
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me

[Verse 2]
(Don't take this the wrong way but, uh)
I never cried when Pac died
But I probably will when Hov does
And if my tears hold value then I would drop one
For every single thing he showed us
And I'll be standing in a puddle
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble
And I'ma keep it honest, I'm so tired of being subtle
It's just me, 40, O, and Nik standing in a huddle
Staring at the members of my team
Who get questioned 'bout they profit from this million dollar scheme
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams
I hope you tell your families this shit ain't what it seems
But y'all the reason for a lot of my devotion
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless
And know I pop bottles 'cause I bottle my emotions
At least I put it all in the open

Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new

Look, fuck all y'all, we ignore feelings here
Premature millionaires, welcome to my realest year
Yeah, I swear that we making a killing here
I should be on top of the world just chilling here
But it's funny having fans
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance
And build you up, so you could be the biggest in the game
And realize when you're there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same
Yeah, and plus things are just surreal at home
People think I've changed just 'cause my appeal has grown
And now security follow me everywhere
So I never actually am alone, I just always feel alone
I think I'm scared of what the future holds
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those
Every girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed
All my old friends think I got a new crowd
And people seem to notice every time I do smile
I guess that mean they come few and far between
Even though I'm living out what you would call the dream
And my uncle ain't even messaging me
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me
I hope this isn't one of those forever things
It's funny how money can change everything
[Chorus]
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me"
Thug Passion,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: 2Pac]
Alright, new drink: one part Alizé, one part Cristal
Thug's passion, baby, y'all know what time it is
This drink is guaranteed to get the pussy wet and the dick hard
Now, if you with me, pour a glass and drink with a nigga
You know what I mean?
I ain't tryin' to turn you all niggas into alcohols... alcoholics
I'm just tryin' to turn you into motherfuckin' thugs
So come and get some of this thug passion, baby

[Verse 1: Kastro]
Man, I could, pull like they dick would, be good until it's relevant
But I'm a straight soldier that I'll roll up a nigga like it's heaven sent
Trippin' over dead presidents, they got these derelicts
I thought was down with this business, tryin' to clown and get a cent
And so rather than stand forever, been thinkin'
Drinkin' over a felony and hell of me and how it will be in hella shit
People tellin' me to cool out, but they ain't feelin' me
A motherfuckin' fool 'bout my fuckin' cheddar cheese
And it pleases, passion of mine, thuggin'
Huggin' plenty of G's and laughin' while passin' through times
And all these backstabbers be watchin', just keep it plain
I'ma keep it the same partner, just take it the simple game
I can, pinkle with rain twinklin', diamonds and things go blinkin'
Enough to hold me 'til I'm old and wrinklin'
These adversaries, they gon' have to be worryin'
'Cause I'ma be illin', fulfillin' my passion
'Til I'm buryin' my thug passion
[Chorus: Jewell]
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby, ohh

[Verse 2: Napoleon]
Now what if me turn this Hennessy into a robbery?
The prophecy probably suddenly switch how it supposed to be
And dirty money can't be evil 'cause it's fillin' up my tummy
Born in a position, death collision was futuristic
Twistin' riches, but there's only one way to make more
So I'm standin' on the corner tryin' to hustle in the snow
And my bigger bro, couldn't know
But buy a .44, blastin' at playa haters wantin' more
With a thug passion

[Verse 3: E.D.I. Mean]
Puttin' down, mashin', control by this thug's passion
Unlike them other bustas pistol blastin', I'm askin' what happened
To the niggas who kept it real like they claim to?
That's what money and fame do, see, they ain't true
Travelin' this road, my poor soul has been consolidated
With all this bullshit that I done tolerated
How I made it can be easily stated
It's like my hardest bring the grip with the passion
Left me to fuckin' greatest, load up and take shit
[Break: Yaki Kadafi]
Make it to some high dollar gangsta shit
Jack a stack 'til we got enough bank to split

[Verse 4: Storm & Jewell]
Creep with me, through that immortal flow (That's right)
Thug passion got you tremblin' like Death on the Row (Yeah)
Make your move, so I can throw your mind a curve
While I'll be blowin' up the scene, like my nigga Mr. Herb
Take a toke, as your heart goes full arrest
I got the bomb, so nigga, fuck the rest
You need a thug to get you flowin' and let that loc see smoke
Feelin' the strokes of the 9 squeeze tight and slow

[Chorus: Jewell]
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby, ohh

[Verse 5: 2Pac]
They say money don't make the man, but damn, I'm makin' money
Observin' you motherfuckers 'cause some of you bitches funny
Say you want it, but you bullshittin'
Lickin' them lips, you got me 'bout to act a fool quick
Sippin' on some Alizé and Cristal
Meanwhile, buy me a drink and get to winkin' at me
She smiles; a nigga's full of passion, satisfaction is everlastin'
""How does it feel?"" What I'm askin' while I'm rubbin' on that ass
""Why you laughin'?""See, I'm diggin' as if I'm curious
Full blown and furious, baby, get a grip, when I be doin' this
It's so physical, my attraction
Driven by alcohol, beware of my reaction
Baby, I'm born to ball, thugged out on Death Row
You better recognize and picture what I said so
Now you can feel it, it's a potion for my niggas in motion
Forever blastin', bitches ain't ready for this thug passion
[Chorus: Jewell & DJ Quik]
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
Thug passion
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby, ohh
Thug passion
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
Thug passion
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby, ohh
Thug passion
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby, ohh
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby, ohh"
That Funny Feeling,Lupe Fiasco,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Yeah
It's Hirst verses and Murakami rhyming
All my raps is superflat, all your raps is super wack
Tell him that the future's back, DeLorean rolling down the block
You can call it shooting craps, and my roof is back
And my wings is up
Kingda Ka without Kahlua, so you ain't got to pour the king a cup
Young Yakuza but, none of my fingers cut
So I can still sip Red Zinger with my pinkies up
Made man, you can call this cleaning up
I'm OCD, I never think it's clean enough
That's what defines me, I never think it's mean enough
Lines deeper than those waiting on a sneaker, cuz
You gone need two heads like the King of Clubs just to figure out the meaning of
I'm just achieving buzz, so stay out of son way like you're drinking blood
This is what it feels like to be in love

[Verse 2]
I mean come on, I mean look at what I'm dropping here
Do this for the block and the blogosphere
No, you ain't ready for the heavy, so I'll keep it light as jogging gear
I don't want the throne, I want the helicopter rocking chair
Jay gave me a co-sign like I was RocaWear, but be clear I'm not the heir
I'm the water, fire and the earth
That means I'm doing dirt, spitting flames and quenching thirst
And plus the real God has been on my side since birth
I hope that he forgives me, I hope I do his work in every single verse
Now I might do a dance, I might even jerk, tell them niggas don't hate
Only God is great, Enemy Of The State"

Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way

[Verse 1]
Up and early for the hope of a brand new day
See a homie you ain't seen since back in the day
Fresh haircut fitted with a fat-ass fade
End of work, we chilling on a Saturday
How you felt when you first heard the Daddy Kane
Rakim, KRS - hey I had that tape
Cooling out with ol' girl on a fat-ass date
Find a hundred dollar bill wow man that's great
Get promoted at your job up to management
Plot a long time finally a plan has made it
Sometimes I feel I wanna shout, man it's real that way
When I think of things that make you feel that way
[Hook]
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way

Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way

[Verse 2]
Christmas Day when your mama got your first bike
Type of feeling when you went and won your first fight
How your team felt winning championship games
Celebrate in a huddle dancing in this rain
Have a thought see a shooting star cross your screen
Put in hard work finally you're living your dream
Deaf man get his hearing now in come vibes
Blind man gain his sight see his first sunrise
Young man speaking out, now he's loud and clear
Birthin' your child, smile so proud you wear
Going in your third eye for the styles you hear
Making music that'll bump for a thousand years
Eating right feeling conscious like health is first
Said a prayer that's sincere and you felt it work
Times I feel I want to shout, man it's real that way
When I'm thinking things that make you feel that way
[Hook]
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way

Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way

[Verse 3]
All up in her vibe something coming over me
Summer days more likely that you notice breeze
Winter days more likely that you notice heat
When I'm gone, more likely that you notice me
In the dark it's more likely that you notice light
In the light more likely that you notice night
Hungry, more appreciation for that meal
Dead broke, more appreciation for that scrill
A bad day'll make you really notice ones that's good
And that'll make things a little better understood
Times I feel I wanna shout, man it's real that way
When I think of things that make you feel that way

Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way

Yeah, what rap crew I gotta snatch up out the game (bitch)
Who must I smack for sayin my name?
Somebody gon' die, it's probably YOU
You couldn't fit Bizarre's body in my shoes
Niggas quick to talk, all hood 'til I pop up
Plus, you just act tough cause Suge got locked up
I am above y'all, when you droppin your raps to diss me
I only recognize the top of your hats
And I don't like Proof punk-ass, he think he tough
He keep thirty niggas with him, cause he weak as fuck!
I ever catch you by yourself, I'mma fuck you up
Snatch your little cheap-ass chain and piece you up
You better hope you and the white boy keep in touch
And be a good little hype man, or your lease is up
Since Slim signed 50, I don't see your teeth as much
That's good, cause you got a grill like a fuckin truck!
DAMN HOMIE, it's history, over, hang it up
Go somewhere and hang up some 50 posters, PUNK
You speak too late, y'all prolly gon' go up to them awards
And get yo' ass whooped by B2K
I just wish Eminem would stop tellin' everybody he ain't speakin' to me
Like I'm one of his hoes or somethin'
How 'bout this, I ain't speakin to you, chump
And I'mma keep pickin on your weak ass crew
(You bitch!) Bizarre you a fat stutterin fuck
You a joke, I choke whoever buttered you up
I've been ridin by your house, you don't come out too much
You hidin, when I find you I'mma snatch you out of that truck
And tie your fat stankin ass to your couch and just
FEED YOU, you already look like you about to bust
Nigga you can run or hide; I'll be on your porch
With a cheeseburger tryin to lure you outside!
Cause he's in it, Bizarre say G-g-g-g-g-g-unit
I bet you throw some extra ""g's"" in it
Just like a stutterin' fool can't reach intelligence
He sweats when he raps, cuz he got a speach impediment

About to dig his own grave with a fork and spoon
(You bitch!) Denaun and Swifty please
Give it a year, both y'all be rakin' 50's leaves
What do I know, that other nigga y'all got in your group
I don't even know his name, but he can shovel my snow

My lil' sister got six puppies that's braver than y'all (barking sounds)
Niggas is startin' the beef I'm 'bout to end with the quickness
I'm 'bout to end this quicker than Bizarre can finish a biscuit
Quicker than quick shit, y'all ain't felt the half
Quicker than Eminem can pinch Elton's ass
Don't call me, I ain't ready to squash it yet
Kiss my ass! I don't wanna talk to Hex!

Sign with Murder Inc. and hit you with a song a day

What did you do, got on the phone and called him up
You don't wanna talk to Royce, but you talk to us

I hit you harder than that white girl that broke your nose
You and Royce can squash this with one talk
Step around from your security and talk to that man

I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man, it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested, guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My mama couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel, man
I ain't one of the Cosbys, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from

But homie, this is my day
Class started two hours ago, oh, am I late?
No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it

Ooh, they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apolog'ing
Let me know if it's a problem then
Aight, man, holla, then

Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a–uh–depending how you dress her
So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between, but way more fresher
With way less effort
'Cause when you try hard, that's when you die hard
Your homies looking like, ""Why, God?""
When they reminisce over you, my God

And this my down girl too - ain't no groupie deal
We left the movies with Uzis, Suzuki wheels
To the Jacuzzi, I tell you, my boo be's real
I mean she do be winnin', Louie spinnin'
Go to the crib, she got the Gucci linen (Linen)
I see boo be grinnin' (Grinnin')
She looked and said, ""Cam, I know that you be sinning""
""Naw! I'm a changed man, look at the Range, ma'am
(Look) I got a whole new game plan""
Looked and said, ""That's nothing but game, Cam""
She was right, she was up in the Range, man (She know me)
Dropped her off at the L, now I'm flippin' the cell
That's right, I had to call up L
Yo L, what up? I hit, what else?
Plus dome, say word, and we got it on tonight
[Chorus: Freekey Zekey & (Toya), Both]
Hey ma (Wassup?)
Let's slide (Alright)
Alright - and we gon' get it on tonight
You smoke? (I smoke)

Well, good - 'cause we gon' get high tonight
Got drops (Got coupes), got trucks (Got jeeps)
Alright - 'cause we gon' take a ride tonight
So ma (Wassup?)
Let's slide (Alright)
Alright - and we gon' get it on tonight"
Voices of the Voiceless,Lowkey,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Lowkey]
From West End to the West Bank
I write righteous rhymes with my right and wrestle the devil with my left hand
Never work for a Zionist, never been a yes man
My art is like Rembrandt painting pictures of death camps
The average person is allergic to the words of wisdom
This is for everyone of Saddam's Kurdish murder victims
And all the pure souls that never had the chance to speak
Truth pumps in my arteries and causes my heart to beat
For soldiers haunted and tortured by guilty memories
Who realised too late to reveal their real enemy
It's all dead wrong
For every victim of racist persecution from Auschwitz to Hebron
My words may sting cowards
For people that were atomised by the Thermite in the Twin Towers
Those living through the wars
Ask me what I do this for
Put the world in its place before it put you in yours

[Hook]
(Singer - Rochelle Rose)
What happens under darkness shall come to light
Can't silence us even though you try
(Lowkey)
You can try to avoid us but it's pointless
You can never avoid the voices of the voiceless

(Singer - Rochelle Rose)
Take our freedom, Can't take our pride
Come what may we will survive

(Lowkey)
You can try to avoid us but it's pointless
You can never avoid the voices of the voiceless

[Immortal Technique]
Keep my third eye hidden under my New York fitted
A crazy unmarried man that deserves to be committed
The future is encrypted in my troubled lyrics
Dream that I've been somewhere for weeks, then wake up in a couple minutes
Sweat dripping with visions of population control
Thoughts overflowing my world like the melting of the North Pole
My people are targeted by military crack committees
So I'm bucking at the feds like natives in Rapid City
Reality savage, my words are like a riot in Paris
The voice of the voiceless, that voice is social imbalance
So stand strong or sit harder in your mental palace
Blinded inside a Kingdom united to its old habits
But now, Middle Passage coming, War Chant, African drumming
Gatling gun humming
Rapid fire mechanism, reckless living
That checks the rhythm of perfectionism
Slave condition
While you're singing God save the system
[Hook]
(Singer - Rochelle Rose)
What happens under darkness shall come to light
Can't silence us even though you try

(Lowkey)
You can try to avoid us but it's pointless
You can never avoid the voices of the voiceless

(Singer - Rochelle Rose)
Take our freedom, Can't take our pride
Come what may we will survive

(Lowkey)
You can try to avoid us but it's pointless
You can never avoid the voices of the voiceless

[Lowkey]
Detain my body, but you can't imprison my mind
If it's my time I'll probably die with my fist in the sky
These are the thoughts of a man who can't escape from his coma
Cries of a young virgin girl who got raped by them soldiers

[Immortal Technique]
Birthing a screaming bastard, post colonial nation
Subject to childhood diseases, famine, war and inflation
Education molded you into your masters image
And you forgot who the fuck you were before the war was finished
[Lowkey]
You're hearing the ghosts of Nagasaki, You're hearing Hiroshima
Beautiful babies being born with the weirdest features
You might never see me in the charts
But Inshallah my seed can see peace in Iraq

[Immortal Technique]
But peace and freedom can never be given
That's historically forbidden, Cos only collision is the recipe
Changing the course of destiny
So I'm strapped with weaponry

[Lowkey & Immortal Technique]
Cause the government don't give a fuck about protecting me

[Hook]
(Singer - Rochelle Rose)
What happens under darkness shall come to light
Can't silence us even though you try

(Lowkey)
You can try to avoid us but it's pointless
You can never avoid the voices of the voiceless

Take our freedom, Can't take our pride
Come what may we will survive

You can try to avoid us but it's pointless
You can never avoid the voices of the voiceless"""
My Darling,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah, look

[Verse 1: Eminem]
If I were to rap about the crap that's out
That's the route you probably want me to take
‘Cause you're just dyin' to know what I think
Hear my take on some other rappers
If I was to say somethin' about Paul Wall
You'd probably crap in your pants, ‘cause I'm white and he's white
So he's like my competition, I mean, right?
Nope! Paul Wall is dope, and so is Bubba
So bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-but, I don't compete with nobody
I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali shuffle
And dance around my opponents, do donuts
Sometimes I play possum, like I'm asleep, it's awesome
I'm like a sleepin' giant, and when I awake I'm like Dre
I just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey
And sink my teeth in 'em, and fill 'em
Full of poison, and make a noise like a snake before I kill 'em
And let 'em know that I just don't feel 'em
And smack 'em with the backward E, the Eminem emblem
I was taught if you gonna murder somebody you should face him
Tell him why, look him dead in the eye, then waste him
And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
Then swallow the shell, all the hollow who dwell
In the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls
For this rap game and it g-g-goes
One-two-three, chk-chk, one-two-three
Chk-chk, one-two-three, that ain't the hook, now follow me
There's nothing else for me to say, my public adores me
Everybody bores me, they're just so corny
So at night before I sleep, I look in the mirror
The mirror grows lips and it whispers: ""Come nearer!""
[Chorus: Eminem]
My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

[Verse 2: Eminem]
""Shady, I know you're in there somewhere, come here!
Talk to me, sit! Here, pull up a chair!
Why don't you cut your hair?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Dye it back, come on, try it!""
Ahh, no! I told you, leave me the fuck alone, will you?
""But I'm here to rebuild you,"" — but I already killed you!
""But Shady, we were meant for each other
Think about your mother,"" — yeah, so what of her?
""You think about what she did to you and your little brother
All them foster homes,"" — fuck you, motherfucker!
I had you beat! — ""No, I was playin' possum
Remember? I let you watch your little girls blossom
I gave you enough time, your soul's mine
I'm taking it back,"" — you fuckin' bitch, why?!
""Because I love you, look a little closer
Isn't that us on that poster? Ha-ha-ha-ha!""
[Chorus: Eminem]
My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

[Verse 3: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
""Shady, listen! (Shady!) You hear that?
They're screaming for you, I can bring your career back!""
But I don't want it back — ""Yes, you do,"" — no, I don't
""Yes, you do! You're gonna regret it later,"" — no, I won't
""I'ma get Dre on the phone, I'll just call the Doctor""
Go ahead, I already talked to Dre yesterday
""Well, I got him on the phone right now!""
(Slim!) You're lying! (Yo, Slim!) How, why now?
What up, Dre? (Check this out, Slim, I gotta talk to you
I don't know, it just seems like ever since you got off your
Drugs you became a lot softer)
But Dre, all Shady is, is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka
(Well, just think about it, Slim, I'm here
Just hit me back and let me know what's up) — fuck this mirror!
""I'm not in the mirror, I'm inside you
Let me guide you,"" — fuck you! Die, you son of a bitch!
""Put the gun down!"" — bye-bye! Boom!
Okay, I'm still alive, — ""So am I too!
You can't kill a spirit even if you tried to
Ha-ha, you sold your soul to me, need I remind you?
You remember that night you prayed to God
You'd give anything to get a record deal? Well, Dre signed you
This is what you wanted your whole life, Marshall, right? Ooh
Look at this house, look at these cars: they're so nice, woo!
Oh, but you didn't know fame has a price too?
That you just now seeing the downside to
Lose your best friend from high school, your wife too
Ain't even sure if your kids like you
Come off tour, can't even sleep at night without NyQuil
Become a Valium addict, start a rehab cycle
But together we can break the cycle

You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling

I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

Running From the Storm,Hilltop Hoods,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Pressure]
It's the calm before the storm that sends that feeling to my frontal lobe
As thunder roams the sky at night I seek shelter yet run alone
The rain soaks me to the bone, assisted by the winter wind
(The chill is blisterin'), my patience for this world begins to thin
Handed in by heavy clothes, the hail rains heavy blows
Heavens chose to endeavour the weather, my very foe
Can barely close my frozen hand around my own fucking dream
With each breath, puff and steam, the night it cools my blood stream
The freeze gripping my chest, my knees strip into flesh
My screams echo through the night but no-one's listening unless
They seeing eye to eye, but it's like the fog slowly buries me
They light their lights then scar my vision, shows me momentarily
The edge of the roadside, thanks to cars I'm covered in spray
Then I try and hitch a ride, the traffic moves the other way
Then I ain't see the sun for days, just like my lifes energy
I stagger on relentlessly and see something ahead of me
I cramp by shelter, I'd take a life for some space
And knowin' lightning never strikes twice in one place
I fight for a taste of the dry life, better known as the high life
But I'm expelled into the winds and that's heralded the story of my life
I keep on through the raging storm and all these distorted sounds
Thoughts of how I'm getting mine no matter how watered down
I'm quarter drowned, quarter frozen, quarter lost, quarter fucked
Man it's been raining for days and I think I'm wet enough
Enough, treading water just to be the next man's shelter
Enough, drowning victims even though you know I felt ya
I've got enough problems of my own, find a sanctuary
Within the eye of the storm, I feel the calm anger me
[Chorus: Suffa]
Ignore the storm clouds gatherin' on the coast
And not give into emotion, be strong, keep on
Running

[Scratches: DJ Debris]

[Verse 2: Suffa]
I walk through life like a drunk in a bar
I no longer see the light that comes from the stars
Cause clouds hang overhead like paintings in the gallery
And rain pats on my head, voices in my head sing ""Battle me""
I challenge the sky, and the sky spits and runs
So the moistures at my heals and I run quick and fast
From the mystic dancer, that is the weather the pattern
It's either clapping, attacking - a peaceful night can never happen
Weather rains for days and leaves you soaked to the bone
I exhale steam like I was smoking a bone
I try coping alone but the rain goes through the night
And then opens my dome like raining blows in a fire
I've been inside for days, I've been trapped in the south side
Cause the fogs a haze and the sky's a blaze outside
I put in my headphones and listen to some Daddy O
To try escape the drone of rain pissing on my patio
But the rain always comes back, never stops, never fades
Banging on my window like cops, in a raid man
What, would I trade, for sunlight I feel like grabbing these
And knockin' myself out, relieving Suffa from this cavalry, ah
The winds are wailing, even howling at my shutter's
Gutters overflowing, blowing the wind, it whispers 'Suffa...'
I wish another day would come and bring the sun in tow
Cause this storm's a raging ocean and I'm sucked in by the undertow
The thunder throws a frightening blow, the lighting glows and disappears
It appears, that it'll be days before the fog and mist will clear
Sticks and logs and missiles here, watch that they don't take a
Eye out, cry out - and get drowned out by mother nature, nature uh
[Chorus: Suffa]
Ignore the storm clouds gatherin' on the coast
And not give into emotion, be strong, keep on
Running

The Soul of the Beat,Hilltop Hoods,"['hip hop', 'blues', 'jazz', 'r&b', 'pop']","[Verse 1: Suffa]
Look
10 stories below if you ever try finding me
I'm the one with rhymes so high tech I write in binary
So if you don't understand them all, that's understandable
The vibe is intangible, the rhyme is like an animal
A beast of the night, he likes to feast in the light
He gives no peace on the mind, with the beats that you like
I'm servin' bowls of soul, in the form of a lyric
You know me, I'm the difference between soul and spirit
Everybody freeze, just hold and hear it
Feel the cold and fear it, if you're bold come near it
Man, feel it, I put soul into mic control
Like jazz artists put soul into rock and roll
You gots to roll with us or else you're against us
My flow to me's like poetry just less pretentious
Weak MCs befriend us, they're just as bad as each other
Never be phatter than Suffa so why not battle each other?
And just leave me alone like a hermit in a cabin
The vibe is alive, reverberating like a Hammon light
That's right we got vibe, it's never won, it's heaven-sent
So, Hilltop Hoods represent, represent
Evidently when we
Represent our weakness is never ever evident
I represent the kids from the side of the street
Never silencing me and the feeling that's inside of this beat
[Chorus 1: Suffa & Pressure]
""This is the beat"" the hills shows you Suffa
""This is the beat"" that made you call an ex-lover, it's like
Summer nights on the porch with a beer
""This is the beat, y'all, of the year""
""This is the beat"" to put the Pressure to your points
""This is the beat"" to make you scream ""it's the joint!""
They got tunnel vision, well, let me make it clear
""This is the beat, y'all, of the year""

[Verse 2: Pressure]
We slam hittin'
Crushin MCs for their ambition then
Sticken high frequencies over your transmission
Now listen
While all these crossovers transition
They barely scratch the surface, while I delve deeper than Hans Christian
Anderson, battling, damn boy you must be dreaming
Couldn't understand the first of my double meanings
You're double teaming with trouble seething
I flex like exaggerated biceps over all these muscle he-men
I hear their mic from screamin (maggots)
Honestly none can follow me, from what I been through
I still read true the prophecies
Unconsciously I took doses of dopeness like an apothecary
And if harnessed properly, effects monopoly - no stopping me
""This is the beat"" for all my mates sucking piss
After Hours, Terra Firm, Cross-Bred, pump your fist
""This is the beat"" for those who wanna fuck with this
Now everybody wants something but they can't get none of this
Just my line is composed
Will leave their mind comatosed
Like unleveling their blood pressure til' their rhyme overdosed
Many months closed 'cause they nonbelievers
I walked a water passed all these stranded MC's
And told em' to catch a breather
Why touch what you don't know?
Learn your words, you washed and dried up
Why fuck with what you know - hurts just to learn to wise up
Open your eyes up for the now, 'cos tomorrow it's too late
'Cause this is the beat to leave your sorrows in your wake
[Chorus 2: Suffa & Pressure]
""This is the beat"" to put the Pressure to your points
""This is the beat"" to make you scream ""it's the joint!""
They got tunnel vision, well, let me make it clear
""This is the beat, y'all, of the year""
""This is the beat"" the hills shows you Suffa
""This is the beat"" that made you call an ex-lover, it's like
Summer nights on the porch with a beer
""This is the beat, y'all, of the year""

[Outro: DJ Debris]"
Sojourn,Hilltop Hoods,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
I don't represent a city (What?), I represent the whole earth
Suck my head inside my chest so I can soul search
Suffa MC gets deep in the cut like infections
Seek perfection like women getting collagen injections
Suck the fat outta them hips and put em into them lips
But now your arse is in your mouth and you can't stop talking shit
I bring the sound to please like the autumn breeze
Bring the leaves down to the ground from the trees, underground I'm at ease
Above ground a mother grieves for her daughter killed
Lost to a pill (a pill) her loving boyfriend bought her, feel
Like I wanna holla, put our trust inside a dollar
Not a chance to advance when we choose lust over honour
Wanna all week, a leak spills death into the ocean
And we swallow our tongues like we swallow our emotions
Let's suffocate our wilderness in cement and granite
Then our children gets to inhabit and build on this dead planet
That we leave, and I watch the evening shadow the sun
Another night, another fight, another battles begun
And kids don't box no more, now it's bats, knifes and machetes
Annoyed and paranoid, I think they're all coming to get me
Sweat me like I was the one that made their girlfriends leave them all
I'm the reason they're outta work and the playing fields uneven
It's even for everyone bro, we're disadvantaged equally
Instead of trying to hurt me, try to stay calm and just speak to me
[Chorus]
You feeling me now? (You feeling me now?)
You feeling me now? (You feeling me now?)
You feeling me now? (You feeling me now?)
You feeling me now? (I hope you're feeling me now)

[Verse 2]
Uh
I hope you're feeling me, like contact on nerve endings
Sounds superb bending nouns and verbs, blending words
Sending them in the form of a verse
Sending you pains like the winter rains
Bring them crops relief from the haze of the summer days
And the droughts dried out them fields and broke that father's heart, a farmer's heart
Now they're heading to the city for another start
And the city's filled with ghosts that's known as homeless vagabonds
Ain't no bench they ain't seen, alley they haven't gone
Rattle on, rabble on
Sing that song Mr Vagabond and tell me all the roads you travelled on
From here to Babylon and babble on
That liquid in the flagon gone, liquified your brain
Till you're asking who you are, where you're from, what's my name?
What's in a name? Is it the same that's in a person?
Entitled to identify you as society's servant
Man I'll never be subservient, the pride inside is permanent
Bring on your coup I'm serving it, now raise your flag, I'm burning it
On my journey when inside my journey was a sojourn
It was either go left, go right, go crazy or go learn
About the self, because sometimes the self it gets forgotten
And you only achieve contact once you've hit rock bottom
Not stopping 'til I face every problem, faced every bend
Face every corner, every turn and keep faith in my friends
And family come stand with me as the world turns
We'll warm our hands by the fire as the world burns
[Chorus]
You feeling me now? (You feeling me now?)
You feeling me now? (You feeling me now?)
You feeling me now? (You feeling me now?)
You feeling me now? (I hope you're feeling me now)"

Dead Homiez,Ice Cube,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Up early in the morning, dressed in black
Don't ask why? Cause I'm down in a suit and tie
They killed a homie that I went to school with (Damn!)
I tell ya life ain't shit to fool with
I still hear the screams from his mother
While my nigga laid dead in the gutter (Shit!)
And it's getting to my temple
Why is that the only time black folks get to ride in a limo?
It makes me so mad I want to get my sawed-off
And have some bodies hauled off
But no, I pay my respects and I'm through
Hug my crew, (whaddup Cube?) and maybe shed a tear or two
Then I wanna get blitzed
Grab my 40 ounce and then I reminisce
About a brother who had to be the one and only
So I dedicate this to my dead homiez

[Verse 2]
Another homie got murdered on a shakedown {3 gun shots}
And his mother is at the funeral, havin' a nervous breakdown
Two shots hit him in the face when they blasted {2 gun shots}
A framed picture and a closed casket
A single file line about 50 cars long
All driving slow with they lights on
He got a lot of flowers and a big wreath
What good is that when you're six feet deep?
I look at that shit and gotta think to myself
And thank God for my health
Cause nobody really ever know it
When it's gonna be they family on the front row
So I take everything slow, go with the flow
And shut my motherfuckin' mouth if I don't know(Word!)
Cause that's what Pops told me
But I wish he could have said it...to my dead homiez
[Verse 3]
I remember we painted our names on the wall for fun
Now it's ""Rest in Peace"" after every one
Except me, but I ain't the one to front
Seems like I'm viewin' a body after every month
Plus, I knew him when he was yea big
Pour beer on the curb before I take a swig
But somethin' ain't right
When it's a tragedy, that's the only time that the family's tight
Lovin' each other in a caring mood
There's lots of people and lots of food
They say ""Be Strong"" and you're tryin'
But how strong can you be when you see your Pops cryin'?
So that's why Ice Cube's dressed up
Because the city is so fuckin' messed up
And everybody is so phony
Take a little time...to think about your dead homiez"

Just another day out in sunny LA
There's dealers in the streets and the coppers don't play
Got my 501 jeans, my crew neck sweater
Saggin' in my pants cuz I don't know better
In any weather we stay the flyest
Killas on my side case u suckas wanna try us
Numbers in my phone, I'm so player
Feelin' so good I think I might run for mayor

I might run for mayor
Nigga ask your momma I'm a muthafuckin' player
If I see your girlfriend starin', I'm a take her
That's word to my cousin up in Oakland with the scraper
501 jeans yeah that's my flavor
Crew neck sweaters in the club, fuck a blazer
Button up under case the bouncer is a hater
Straight to the bar for a couple shots of jaeger
If I see a nice thin light skin I'm a game her
Tell her I'm big Mibbs and I'm runnin' for mayor
She digs my speeds and guess where I'm a take her
Back to the crib where I can blaze her
Modern Joe Frazier second round knock out
When I pull the cock out, baby see you later
I think around 8 or 9 I'm a wake her up
Kick her out, then go pick up my paper
[Hook]

I might run for mayor
Cruise through the city in a booger green pacer
Got ya girl wit me, I'm so player
Pullin' hoes since Bo Jackson was a Raider
Everything's tailored, from the Chuck Taylor's
Check the steering wheel in my car, that's gator
Sip liquor straight, I don't need chasers
Drink a pint of hen, I'm cursin' like a sailor
I'm so major, sit back and watch me
Bought my 501's and my sweater from the swap meet
Music up loud, coppers wanna stop me
Mad cuz I'm young black makin' that broccoli
Hangin' wit the possie, niggas wanna copy
But I'm too fly so the squares can't jock me
Watch how they jock me, I'm so player
Feelin' so good I think I might run for mayor

[Hook]

Yeah I might run for mayor
I'm scandalous with the papers
LA county, the planet of the gangsters
Get ya cameras and tapers
Ya boy hustle hard like Rambis for the Lakers
Riding by zoom but we boom wit the base muffle
Fly as a space shuttle, cool as a rain puddle
Who wanna make trouble
Pimp hand heavy no half stepping
Like old school Daddy Kane for ya
Its a shame on you, what you lames gone do
You's a bitch, we make it rain on you
Yea the dames come through
We decked out with hoes, draw circles around tens
Then ex out the O's, boy check out my pose
Stan Smith classic fresh out the grove
Look who crept out the stove
Keep a bad one like she fresh out the Vouge
Then we go shopping like we fresh out the clothes
Gimme that, shopping bags, popping tags, I'm a smash
From the side of the tracks, where the homies talk trash
You can only sight see if you got a pass, the mayor

Superstar,Lupe Fiasco,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: Matthew Santos & Lupe Fiasco]
If you are what you say you are (Yeah, yeah) a superstar (Gon' say now)
Then have no fear, the camera's here (Ugh)
And the microphones
And they wanna know-oh-oh-oh (The return)
If you are what you say you are, a superstar (What)
Then have no fear, the crowd is here (Yeah!)
And the lights are on (Haaa!)
And they want a show-oh-oh-oh, yeah (Free Chilly!)

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah! Ugh! a fresh cool young Lu'
Trying to cash his microphone check, 2-1-2
Wanna believe my own hype, but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees, what have you brung? You?
Did you improve on the design, did you do something new?
Well, your name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You! The more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you—you come too
And then it hit me—standing outside of Heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me: I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gumshoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle, I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung ""Blue""
Go back, whatever you did you undo
Heavy as heaven, the devil on me, two tons too
Ha, ha, ha, ha-ha-ha
[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones
And they wanna know-oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement, past the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid and (Pyoom!)
Out through China, nearly misses airliners
Magnified times five, this was pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze (Woo!)
Now, that's important to say
'Cause even with all that, most of us don't want it to faaaade
We want it to braid
Meaning, we want it to grow, meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called, and he told him to wait
Unstrap him from the chair, and put him back in his caaaage
The audience ain't fazed
And they ain't gon' clap, and they ain't gon' praise (Ugh)
They want everything back (Back) that they've paid
'Cause they've been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim
Ha, ha, ha, ha-ha-ha
[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show-oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
So, chauffeur, chauffeur, come and take me away
'Cause I've been standing in this line for, like, five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along, and when I got to the front
They told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&Ms are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every song's her favorite song; and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say, ""You need to go and see that""
And everybody claps, 'cause everybody is pleased
And then, they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like, ""Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha""
""Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha, ha""

If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones

If you are what you say you are, a superstar (Superstar!)
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show-oh oh oh (Yeah)

My momma gave me Donny Hathaway
""Young, Gifted and Black""
I miss the positivity, I wanna bring it back
But Rap nowadays is by a bunch of ignorant cats
No ""Young, Gifted and Black""
Just guns, bitches and crack
I react by turning off BET
And Sambos telling me what blackness is supposed to be
Used to give us world news, now it's all videos
Replaced Tavis Smiley with reality shows
If you let the TV define what black is
You think ice and violence is all we think that matters
I guess this is what happens when rappers look up to thugs
And kids look up to rappers
To some of y'all if I don't talk about the gat enough
Or sell crack enough, I ain't black enough
But I rather be a pro at being myself
Than be an idiot trying to be somebody else, what

Been there for a while
Moms taught me how to catch this route when I was a child
Another kid walks up, freakin' a Black & Mild
Fifteen, same age I learn shit's wild
An older lady walks up, greets us with a smile
Asks how we both doing and sits down
She knows what's it's like to grow up in the South
Civil Rights when the whites was hosing us down
I started thinking to myself that even though the times were tougher
They still took time out to speak to one another
But look at us, me and this young brother
Acting to proud to break down and speak to each other
So inside I felt ashamed
Not sure of how to but I wanna change
And as long as I'm alive, then the fact remains
That it's never too late for us to break the chains
Come on, y'all

Live alone in a paradise

Love lost, such a cost
Give me things that don't get lost
Like a coin that won't get tossed
Rolling home to you

Ah, one look in my eyes
And you can tell that's true

Run around the same old town
Doesn't mean that much to me

Look at how the time goes past

Rolling home to you

Ain’t no nigga pay for my studio time
See me at the top and want to claim my fame
Nigga took my chain, yeah motherfucking right
You better off saying a nigga took my life
Want to assassinate my character but I ain’t acting

Eyes wide shut, I don’t see these niggas
Cause deep in your heart you want to be me nigga
Want to stand in my shoes, want to fuck my hoes
Want to live my life, want to rock my shows

I keep an AR with them loose ass clips
What type of real nigga name himself after a bag
Nigga you’s a ho, a Louis Vuitton fag

Ice tray on my wrist yea it shines so bright
Make moves in the day and I ball by night

Yo, sit back, relax, catch your contact
Sip your con-gi-ac
And let's all wash this money through this laundromat
Sneak attack, the new cats in rap worth top dollar
In fact, touch mines and I'll react like a Rottweiler
Who could relate? We play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch 'em and break
Undress 'em, tie 'em with tape — no escape
The Corleone, fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own zone
Or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome

Lower your tone, face it, homicide cases get thrown

Yo, my people from Medina, they will see ya when you re-up
Bring your heater, all your cream go between us

Yukons and ninja black Lexus
'Mega the pretty boy with mafia connections
It's The Firm, nigga, set it!

Yo, my mind is seein' through your design like Blind Fury
I shine jewelry, sippin' on crushed grapes, we lust papes

And now the projects is talkin' that somebody-gotta-die shit
It's logic — as long as it's nobody that's in my clique

Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me

And Baba Shallah spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke
Raw though, an ounce mixed with leak, that's pure though
Flippin' the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar was mad dripper
He had a fuckin' villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama, but wait, it's half-and-half
Ki's is one and two-fifth, so how we flip?
32 grams raw, chop it in half, get 16
Double it, times three, we got 48, which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight, we back to 16
Now add the other two that 'Mega bringin' through
So let's see, if we flip this other ki
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three
We got three quarters of another ki

Sneakin' in through the back door, booty MCs get ambushed
Rammed and squooshed, slammed and pushed, crammed and mushed
Then I move it on down from the right to left
So bite the method, prepare to fight to death
To get jacked, attacked and cracked in two
Smackin' through 'til you're black and blue for actin', true
I'm dreaded like a man whose hair is all strands
Crews battle me, sniffin' on aerosol cans
I'm stomping 'em, kicking 'em, choking 'em, stamping 'em
Clompin' 'em, sticking 'em, poking 'em, clampin' 'em
To electric chairs and tightenin' bolts
Hit 'em with frightening jolts of lightning bolts

Faster than you can snap your fingers for answers
Cancer is in the flesh, alive and breathin'
Survivin' by connivin' and thievin'

It felt like I was bein' attacked by spiders
Developing a fear from biterphobia

If I detect ya, I'ma pulverize
Dissect your brain, diggin' in your skull for lies
Then I'ma torture
With material iller than a stark ravin' mad serial killer
I'm more dangerous than a loaded chamber is
A major risk to a plagiarist
So, beware of the aura
A terror the horrible will scare ya tomorrow
It's the airborne assault of the rappers
Either start developing skills
Or head for the border and run like hell up in hills
The choice is yours
Besides all these noises force me to scream 'til my voice is hoarse
'Cause I'm sick of these jabber jaws
And crabs that grab at yours
And saboteurs that bite like Labradors
You're in range of my double-barrel and your life is in danger, trouble and peril

I trample and stamp liars like they were campfires
'Cause vampires bite on my balls and clamp pliers and swing on my big thingamajig
So, I'm bringin' my nig, Proof, for backup when I sing at my gig
'Cause biters are fallin' head over heels in love with every rhyme that I've said over reels
That's how I became paranoid
Chewing my fingernails, pulling my hair, annoyed
'Cause every time you bit, it was deliberate
So, I'm forced to hit a little quicker with an ultimatum
I assault and slayed 'em with rhymes and insults
And made 'em difficult to fade 'em
Energetic and imaginative pronouns and verbs
Predicates and adjectives will reach out and grab you 9 times out of 10

""John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the Tec""

When I pop the trunk, hit the deck
""John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the Tec""
Head for the hills before you get wrecked
""John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the Tec"" (Repeat 2x)
[Psycho Les]
Here I come up your block, drivin' drunk
Smoking skunk, waiting for a fucking punk
To beef, so he can get killed by the psycho thief
Retarded like Biz, eating cats like Heath-
Cliff, light the spliff, crack the quart and
If I kill you first nigga, be a good sport and
Die, don't give me no hassle
I snatch up your bitch, take her to White Castle
To crack her asshole, so I can fuck her
Hit that doo doo brown, then buck her
The crazy rapist smelling like much vaginas
Carjacking punks, pulling 'em out they Pathfinders
It makes me want to scream, but I just chill
By the end of the week, how many punks must I kill?
I'm sticking up picnics, I'm robbing 'em good so after dark
Stay the fuck out the woods (You fucking punk!)

When I pop the trunk, hit the deck
""John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the Tec""
Head for the hills before you get wrecked
""John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the Tec"" (Repeat 2x)

[Psycho Les]
Come on girl, don't give me that shit
Blast my nine to your spine, take your money then split
Audi, now your ass is ghost to me
Beatnuts on the loose sticking Hindu grocery shops
So what's up hops?
I shoot you with no problem, I'm used to shooting cops
I'll let you go this time, but next time you pop
That shit, your ass gets dropped
[JuJu]
Yo, it's the gun-slinging lunatic demons outta hell
Intoxicated punks letting off bad smell
Beatnuts forever, die hard motherfuckers
Low-key deadly, taking out all suckers
Before you even step and try to play me, son
Bring heavy ammunition so you don't have to run
Take heed, this ain't something you should laugh to
Yo I'll shoot your moms if I have to

When I pop the trunk, hit the deck
""John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the Tec""
Head for the hills before you get wrecked
""John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the Tec"" (Repeat 2x)"
Hate Me Now,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by D Moet, Pretty Boy & Trackmasters]

[Intro: Nas and Puff Daddy]
Escobar Season has returned
It's been a long time, been a long time comin'
It's life or death for me now
But you know, there's no turnin' back now
This is what makes me, this is what I am
Feel me? Let's go

[Chorus 1: Puff Daddy and Nas]
You can hate me now, (Q.B.)
But I won't stop now (Real niggas)
'Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts)
You can hate me now (C'mon)
But I won't stop now
'Cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

[Ad-lib over Chorus: Puff Daddy (Nas)]
Well, you hate me, I'm gon' hate you too
It's as simple as that
Die motherfucker, die motherfucker, die!
You don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
Go down any way you want it to go down (do it now)
Weak, jealous motherfuckers! (do it now, do it now)
Fuck y'all!
[Verse 1: Nas]
Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, flows that I try
Close your eyes, picture me rollin', Sixes, money foldin'
Bitches, honeys that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winner
Best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ringside try watchin' my paper
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence for this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin' more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
But you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest

[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
Money is power, motherfucker!
I got millions of thugs on salary

[Chorus 2: Puff Daddy]
You can hate me now, (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (Cmon)
You can hate me now (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now
[Ad-Libs: Nas and Puff Daddy]
Do it now! I told you, do it now!
Let's go

[Verse 2: Nas]
You wanna hate me, then hate me; what can I do
But keep gettin' money? Funny, I was just like you
I had to hustle hard, never give up, until I made it
Now y'all sayin': ""That's a clever nigga, nothin' to play with.""
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same OG
People warned me: ""When you're on top there's envy""
Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us
Sayin' we left the hood but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?
Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the streets, hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that – what you expect, hoe?
Nickname Esco, took this game to its threshold
Best flow, I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that, 'cause niggas feel this, right?

[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
You think I'ma come this far
And let you niggas stop me now?
I hate you too!
[Chorus 2: Puff Daddy]
You can hate me now, (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
I like this, I like the way this feels

[Verse 3: Nas]
It's a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes, nine milli's and thirty-eights
Hell or the Pearly Gates; I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
Took a little time to claim my spot
Jamming up the border to this game stop, and I side with the Lord
Ride for the cause while drivin' niggas shot at my doors
Plottin' I'm sure, to catch me with they Glocks to my jaws
Tried stickin' me up, but I flipped on these ducks
Instead of me, ambulances were pickin' them up
Niggas fear what they don't understand
Hate what they can't conquer, guess it's just inferior man
Became a monster, on top of the world, never fallin'
I'm as real as they come, from day one, forever ballin', c'mon!

[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
You ain't never seen a nigga like me ever in your life
And that's what you can't understand!

[Chorus 2: Puff Daddy]
You can hate me now, (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

[Outro: Puff Daddy and Nas]
You can hate me now, (C'mon, niggas!)
But I won't stop now (Do it now! Get this shit over with!)
It ain't gon' never stop, niggas!"
Surviving The Times,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
But that's the whole, tragic, point my friends!
What would I do if I could suddenly feel
And to know once again that what I feel is real?
I could cry, I could smile
I might lay back for a while
Tell me what, what, what would I do if I could feel?

[Verse 1]
I was young, I was survivin' the times
Waitin' for my moment, I was destined to shine
Little Ray had an NSX, I was hopin' I'm next
Wantin' bracelets, never hada rope on my neck
Unless I was holdin' Taiyeh chain – Rest In Peace
Even though that night you flipped on us, you warned us
If you came back and we still on the corners, we goners
Movin' on to move your arm in your watch
To another time on the block
‘Cause this 40 Side where they say shorty rhyme
Tragedy, he used to come through all the time
I'm talkin' Juice Crew, not what the word define
He had a sister named Erin, for sure was fine
That was my first crush, I bought my first mic
I wrote my first verse, I was about nine
I was about mine, fantasize house buyin'
Met Paul, he wore some big glasses
Him and Melquan took me where G Rap lived
I was happy just gettin' some answers
I ain't even know what a record advance was
I'm seein' hoes sex in the studio bathroom
With rap dudes, thinkin', ""Wow, she moved me!""
Same girl then right now's a groupie
Back then she was like the star in a movie
Large jewelry and expensive Gucci
Next stop, Paid In Full posse recruits me
Knew they were some millionaires, their ropes were dookie
Eric B man lookin' like touch it, he shoot me
You see, every time Ra didn't show
I get to record demos at attempts to blow
I wonder, could they tell? How did they know?
Sixteen years later, here I go
[Chorus: Nipsey Russell]
""What-what, what-what, what would I do?""
""What-what, what-what, what would I do?""
""What-what, what-what, what would I do?""
""What-what, what-what, what would I do?""

[Verse 2]
I'm with Akinyele in the street, tryin' to get us a deal
G Rap tried to get us to sign to Cold Chill
But Fly Ty didn't have the contract we wanted
Clark Kent just signed Das, he didn't want us
Russell said I sounded like G, the nigga fronted
Reef and Matty C offered me a little money
Shit a little funny, feel a little laughter
Rebel of Hip-Hop comin' through a white rapper
My boy MC Serch, nevertheless
Took me to Columbia, back then CBS
Chris Schwartz, RuffHouse, he was the best man
Now buggin' because the label had just dropped Def Jam
Could you picture Russell needin' a check, man?
But he smart, he plotted a plan for Polygram
Life is ill, again life's a movie
Then the roster's Cypress Hill, Nas and Fugees
Before I sold records, no promotion
The rap world like, ""What's all this commotion?""
Went plat, mad bottles I'm toastin'
20/20 hindsight, but how did they know then?
[Chorus: Nipsey Russell]
""What-what, what-what, what would I do?""
""What-what, what-what, what would I do?""
""What-what, what-what, what would I do?""
""What-what, what-what, what would I do?""

[Verse 3]
Invincible, lyrical, miracle man, huh
Uh, but back to the matter at hand
‘Cause 10 years ago we all strived to be 25
Some cats didn't make it alive
Dated some stars but respect their privacy
Copped mad cars, layin' back in the driver's seat
Held myself down, just steerin' the wheel
Here I am, completed my whole record deal

[Chorus: Nipsey Russell]
""What-what, what-what, what would I do?""
""What-what, what-what, what would I do?""
""What-what, what-what, what would I do?""
""What-what, what-what, what would I do?""

What would I do
If I could reach inside of me
And to know how it feels
To say I like what I see?"

[Intro: Frogg]
Woah, a-get yo' hands in the air
And get to clappin' 'em and, like, back and forth
Because a-this is what you thought it wasn't
It be's the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O, the double G
And check out my man, he goes by the name of, um, er-

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit yo' style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke, and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi, Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm comin' up quick to strip yo' cash
Bought a ticket to yo' concert just to come and whip yo' ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin' so fast it'll make yo' eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson (Pssh)
The proof is in the puddin', just ask DeShaun Holton
I'll slit yo' motherfuckin' throat worse than Ron Goldman
[Chorus: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', ""Fuck the world"" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlastin', I melt vanilla ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
Flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss yo' magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make yo' freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is lyrical combat, gentlemen, hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, M&M was the old initials (Bye-bye)
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit outta proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' yo' dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
With more holes than an afghan

So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', ""Fuck the world"" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)

Somebody let me out this limousine (Hey, let me out)
I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend
Shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain-dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure
I'll bite yo' motherfuckin' style just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school, I never said much, too busy havin' a head rush
Doin' too much rush, had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, ***** the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home but I don't got the key to get in

[Intro]
A lot of people ask me, am I afraid of death?
Hell yeah, I'm afraid of death
I don't want to die yet
A lot of people think that I worship the Devil
That I do all types of retarded shit
Look, I can't change the way I think
And I can't change the way I am
But if I offended you, good
'Cause I still don't give a fuck

[Verse 1]
I'm zonin' off of one joint, stoppin' the limo
Hopped in the window, shoppin' a demo at gunpoint
A lyricist without a clue, what year is this?
Fuck a needle, here's a sword, body pierce with this
Livin' amuck, never givin' a fuck
Give me the keys, I'm drunk, and I've never driven a truck
But I smoke dope in the cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open your scab (Yeah)
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptyin' full clips and buryin' guns in the mud
I've calmed down now, I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brain's gone, my soul's worn, my spirit is torn
The rest of my body's still bein' operated on
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin' this time
[Chorus]
For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
To all the friends I used to have, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For every time I reminisce, yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

[Verse 2]
I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast, when your blood spilled, it was still blue
I'll hang you 'til you dangle, and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I wanna crush your skull 'til your brains leak out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains
So tell Saddam not to bother with makin' another bomb
'Cause I'm crushin' the whole world in my palm
Got your girl on my arm, and I'm armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on
And the pants to match (""Here, Momma, try 'em on"")
I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives
(Shittin' on rappers) Causing hospital accidents
God help me, before I commit some irresponsible acts again
[Chorus]
For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For all the friends I used to have, I miss my past

I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spent a million a track and went over my budget (Oh shit)
Now, how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?
I can't rap anymore, I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doin' some bugged twitches
I'm withdrawin' from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the women, fuck bitches
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a clique, I'm a posse
Kamikaze, strappin' a motherfuckin' bomb across me
From the second I was born, my momma lost me
I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place
My worst day on this Earth was my first birthday
Retarded? What did that nurse say?
Brain damage? Fuck, I was born durin' an earthquake

For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too

Bully,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Yo, check it out
It's fucked up
'Cause I don't see either one of us budging

[Verse 1]
""I'm withholdin' my anger though I'd like to be the strangler
Of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck
It's my right to insist that he acknowledge my existence
But he just displays complete lack of respect""
That's what he says to himself as he uses his magazines to trash me
As he sits with both his feet up at his desk
Smokes a bag of his weed and starts imaginin' things
And he just can't see that he's manically depressed
And in his jealousy and envy, it just whirls him in a frenzy
As he turns on MTV and sees my face
He don't exist in this world so he just twists and he twirls
Spirals and spins 'til he hurls himself into a rage
And it's destroyin' him slowly 'cause he does not even know me
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes
So he just tortures himself, he has no fortune and wealth
So he extorts someone else to get his dough
And now he's actin' like a bully so he tries to push and pull me
But he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad
And he has no choice but to scream and raise his voice up at me
'Cause it annoys him to see that I ain't scared
[Chorus]
You ain't no motherfuckin' bully
And I ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
And I know it must be fuckin' wit' you emotionally

[Verse 2]
Now I'm not tryin' to make no more enemies, no more unfortunately
There's so many other motherfuckers there just are
They just keep houndin' at me now that I'm down with 50
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja (Ha-ha-ha-ha)
But his ass is such a puppet, Irv could shove his whole hand up it
And just make him say what he wants him to say
But Suge has Irv on a string and Irv's so nervous that he
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay
So now Ja thinks that he's so tough and Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down
But our building's made out of bricks so you ain't takin' out shit
And, dawg, you just did a song with Bobby Brown
So now you try to pull the race card and it backfires in your face hard
'Cause you know we don't play that black and white shit
Plus this stylist you fucked when you was ecstasied up
Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch
[Chorus]
You ain't no motherfuckin' bully
And I ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
You must be takin' too much E

[Verse 3]
Now what bothers me the most about hip-hop is we're so close
To pickin' up where we left off with Big and Pac
We just lost Jam Master J, Big L got blasted away
Plus we lost Bugz, Slang Ton, and Freaky Tah
It's like a never-ending cycle that just seems to come full circle
Everybody's gotta be so fuckin' hard
And I'm not excludin' myself 'cause I been stupid as well
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart
But as we grow as men, we learn to let shit go, but then again
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand
We all got reps to uphold when someone steps on our toes
It's no exception, it goes for every man
But if Irv really gave a fuck about Ja like he claims he does
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
But he just keeps feedin' him pills so if that E doesn't kill him
Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed
Dawg, I'm talkin' to you straight if the situation escalates
Any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game
And if I get killed for this rap, I got a million in cash
That says I will get you back in Hailie's name
[Chorus]
You ain't no motherfuckin' bully
And I ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
Irvine, get your boy off of that E

Get at me, dawg

One Day at a Time Em’s Version,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Sometimes it's hard to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear 'em anymore
Got me heartbroken, fine, so many babies screamin'
‘Cause they seeing destruction before they see a human bein'
So they start smokin' weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
‘Cause they all broken, why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly? Somebody else's child
Caught in gun smoke and we, can all make a change
So I'm told, but I haven't seen the change unfold
I'll keep hoping, please, if you prefer to breathe
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open, greed brings only misery
A way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens rise
Don't be afraid to try, too many of us die
For the door to open wide, my brothers speak wise
Stay focused on the prize, though everybody dies
[Verse 2: Eminem]
We can only learn to take, our anger and our hate
Control our mental states, settle down and set it straight
Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump our brakes
Before we said it, regret it later and let it escalate
‘Cause by then it's just too late, there's so much we can take
And there's only so much someone can swallow and tolerate
To the point that he just breaks, snaps, and it's all it takes
You think that we was learnin' from other rappers' mistakes
But we ain't, its grain to go against
With every artist comes the image he portrays
And the picture that he paints
But in the midst of all this anger and this angst
Never once did you hear me say I'm a gangster
And I ain't hear no complaints
But I know that I will always continue to grow
As long as I lead, and never follow in no one else's shadow
There will never be another me, and that I can guarantee
That's why the fuck I remain sucker free
To this day, the game will never be the same
No matter how much fame and success they attain
There will never be another me
And no matter what they do, there will never be another you
You can search, but you'll never find
You can try to rewind time, but in your hearts and your minds
We will never die, we are forever alive
And we continue growin', one day at a time
[Verse 3: Young Noble]
Don't get caught in the publicity and caught in the hype
Rappers are regular people minus money and lights
Searchin' for fortune and fame and superstardom
All the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew's the hardest
There's not a hip-hop police, the villains is watchin'
And the kids think beef is they only option
Outlawz born filthy, guilty as charged
My memories of Kadaf' while Makaveli lives on
You think the industry is fun, ain't no pity with guns
And when your money is up, that's when your enemies come
So if he died and came back, would he try to save rap?
We needin' a change, the drama remains the same

[Verse 4: Hussein Fatal]
I spend my whole life fightin' myself
That I can't win, so I'm invitin' some help
And every now and then, I take rights from the left
I'm still, just like a kid, lookin' for stripes on my belt
Yeah, and that there is a fight in itself
So I just pray and hope God, take a like to myself
No matter how much I try to stay alive
I'ma die a man, still standin' and in love with my pride

[Verse 5: E.D.I. Mean]
Heard frivolous beats, we past that
I'm tryin' to keep some income coming in
And collect on my ASCAP
The rappers in the game ain't changed (No)
And I finally realize that we're not in the same game
The hatin' will never end, so I guess I'll deal with it
Them .45's will pop killas, yes, I'm still with it
The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
Gotta stay leery, and keep your eyes on the rollers
They do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us
So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rollin'
One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind
\And we continue growin', one day at a time, damn"
Say Whats Real,Drake,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'blues']","[Verse: Drake]
Why do I feel so alone?
Like everybody passing through the studio
Is in character as if he acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart
To give these bitch niggas the cue to go
So they stick around kicking out feedback
And I entertain it as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back, but
It's hard to think of them polite flows
When Stefano Pilati suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full, now this shit just being lipo'd
Always said I'd say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets, showing you the basics
I can't live and hold the camera, someone gotta tape this
And make hits like a bitch that's married, I ain't miss
24 hours from greatness, I'm that close
Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South
Watchin' Hov's show, embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out
So I park about five houses down
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonder where my mind is, accounts in the minus
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless
And promoters try to get me out to they club
And say I have fun but I can't imagine how
'Cause I just seen my ex-girl, standing with my next girl
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now
And shit could get weird unless they all down
And so I stay clear, we from a small town
And everybody talks and everybody listen
And somehow the truth just always comes up missing
I've always been something that these labels can't buy
Especially if they tryin' to take a piece of my soul
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez, ""Damn, Drake fly""
And he just be like, ""Silly motherfucker, I know
That was your bad, how could you pass up on 'em?
He just take them records and he gas up on 'em
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em""
Oh, they did, Po, at least they tried to
And that's what happen when you spitting what's inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you however they decide to
Nah, but 40 told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
'Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest, coulda fooled me
Boy, and to my city I'm the 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy
Understand, I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit, I'm gettin' better still
Little niggas put my name in they verses
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
Future said, ""'Cause this 'Ye shit, you better kill""
And I think this got this Making-of-a-Legend feel
Problem with these other niggas, they ain't never real
[Outro]
Yeah, that's all I can say"

Wavin Flag,K'naan,"['pop', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
When I get older I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a wavin' flag

[Chorus]
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, oh

[Verse 1]
Born to a throne, stronger than Rome
A violence prone, poor people zone
But it's my home, all I have known
Where I got grown, streets we would roam
Out of the darkness, I came the farthest
Among the hardest survival
Learn from these streets, it can be bleak
Accept no defeat, surrender, retreat

[Pre-Chorus]
So we struggling, fighting to eat
And we wondering when we'll be free
So we patiently wait for that fateful day
It's not far away, but for now we say
[Chorus]
When I get older I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, oh

[Verse 2]
So many wars, settling scores
Bringing us promises, leaving us poor
I heard them say 'love is the way'
'Love is the answer,' that's what they say
But look how they treat us, make us believers
We fight their battles, then they deceive us
Try to control us, they couldn't hold us
Cause we just move forward like Buffalo Soldiers

[Pre-Chorus]
But we struggling, fighting to eat
And we wondering, when we'll be free
So we patiently wait for that faithful day
It's not far away but for now we say

[Chorus]
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, oh
When I get older I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, and then it goes
And then it goes
[Bridge]
And everybody will be singing it
And you and I will be singing it
And we all will be singing it

[Chorus]
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, oh
When I get older, when I get older
I will be stronger just like a wavin' flag
Just like a wavin' flag, just like a wavin' flag
Flag, flag, just like a wavin' flag"
Cleanin Out My Closet,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're prolly sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!
[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Ha!)

[Verse 2]
I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
‘Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
‘Cause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show
[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)

[Verse 3]
Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, you're gettin' older now, and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick, he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral (Ha-ha!)
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? (Hehe)
Well, guess what? I am dead—dead to you as can be!
[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet"

Dawg, you gotta see him when he drive by

So I could put my ""love below"" by her ""speakerbox""

And gave me dome at Katy's home, baby, this the life!

Player, give me some brew and I might just chill
But I'm the type that like to light another joint, like Cypress Hill
I steal doobies, spit loogies when I puff on it
I got some bucks on it, but it ain't enough on it
Go get the S, the T, I D-E-S
Nevertheless, I'm hella fresh, rollin' joints like a cigarette
So pass it 'cross the table like ping pong
I'm gone, beatin' my chest like King Kong
It's on, wrap my lips around the forty and when it comes to
Getting another stogie, fools all kick in like
Shinobi. No, he ain't my homie to begin with
It's too many heads to be poppin' to let my friend hit it
Bit unless you pull out the fat, crispy
Five-dollar bill, on the real, before it's history
‘Cause fools be havin' them vacuum lungs
And if you let 'em hit it for free, you hella dumb-da-dumb-dumb
I come to school with the Taylor on my earlobe
Avoiding all the dick teasers, skeezers, and weirdos
That be blowing off the land, like, ""Where the bomb at?""
Give me two bucks, you take a puff, and pass my bomb back
Suck up that dank like a Slurpee, the serious
Bomb will make a niggy go delirious, like Eddie Murphy

Face whenever I can, don't need no crutch
I'm so keyed up till the joint be burning my hand
Next time I roll it in a hampa to burn
Slow, so the ashes won't be burning up my hand, bruh
Hoochies can hit, but they know they got to pitch in
Then I roll a joint that's longer than your extension (hahaha)
‘Cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free
Hell no! You better bring your own spliff, chief
What's up? Don't babysit that, better pass the
Joint, stop hitting, ‘cause you know you got asthma
Crack a 40 open, homie, and guzzle it
‘Cause I know the weed in my system is gettin' lonely
I gotta take a whiz test to my P. O
I know I failed, ‘cause I done smoked major weed, bro
And every time we with Chris, that fool rollin' up a
Fatty, but the Tanqueray straight had me

My yester-night thing got me hung off the night train

Hit the stroll to 9-0, so we can roll big hashish
I wish I could fade the eighth, but I'm low budget
Still rollin' a two-door Cutlass, same old bucket
Foggy windows, soggy Indo

Then ease up, speed up through the E-S-O
Drink the V-S-O-P up, with a lemon squeeze up
And everybody's rolled up, I'm the roller

Hold up, suck up my weed is all you do
Kick in feed, ‘cause where I be we needs half, like Umfufu

Ever So Clear,Bushwick Bill,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Bushwick Bill & (Tamica)]
See, most of my life I never had shit
I felt like an outcast, treated like a misfit
Damn near didn't make it on my day of birth
Thinking, ""Was I really supposed to be on this planet earth?""
I take a deep breath and then another follows
'Cause hard shit is kinda hard to swallow
See, it's rough being a loner
Not knowing any given day and time I could wind up a goner
See, people got it bad from jump-street
And being short is just another strike against me
I used to get funny looks 'cause I was small
And trying to make it was like running through a brick wall
Given the odds I was up against, bro
The average nigga would've quit a long time ago
But now I've got a record out
I'm doing shows, people paying to see me turn it out
Now, I'm the spice around town
It's funny how an album can change a nigga's life around
I got friends and bitches on my dick
But when they look at Richard all they see is Bushwick
Sometimes I don't know a friend from a foe
And every different day it's a different fuckin' ho
And now that my pockets are getting bigger
I'm meeting hoes who only wanna juice a nigga
They tell me that they love me and all that
But really they just wait for me to fall flat
So they can get me for my income
Take me for all I got, and then some
Like Trina, you dig?
I fucked up and got too attached to the bitch's kid
Knowing that she used the baby to use me
Took him out my life, mentally abusing me
But as the time went by, I got another slimmy
And she was just like the first one screaming, ""Gimme""
But not in the exact same way
She had a different type of game she liked to play
Her name was Crystal, she played the quiet type
And for a little while, shit seemed alright
But just like the first ho, homie
When shit got hectic, the bitch broke out on me
And it's getting out of hand, G
'Cause nobody seems to understand me
Reminiscing got me feeling kinda low
I broke out the Everclear and then I drunk some mo'
Until it was all gone
Now I'm looking for somebody to take my pain out on
But not just anybody, G
I'ma take that on Tamica, 'cause she's the closest to me
Full of that Everclear and high on that buddah
Get to the house, all I'm thinking 'bout is shooting her
'Cause shooting her would be sweet
But you know what'd be sweeter? If I make her shoot me
Call me crazy, but that's what I'm thinking
I'm tripping, from all that smoking weed and drinking
But I knew she wouldn't do it on her own, so I provoked her
Punched her, kicked her, and chocked her
She still wouldn't grab the gun
And at that time, I wasn't thinking about no one
Damn near crazy, I went and grabbed the baby
(Bill! Gimme the baby! Gimme the baby!)
Held him by the door and said I'ma throw his ass out, ho
She went to crying, ""Somebody stop him""
I said, ""You better grab the motherfuckin' gun or I'mma drop him""
She snatched the baby out of my hands
We started fighting, punching, scratching, and biting
When we fell on the bed, check this shit
All kinds of crazy shit was going through my head
So I ran and got the gun and came back to her
Loaded it up and handed the gat to her
I grabbed her hand and placed the gun to my eye muscle
She screamed, ""Stop,"" and then we broke into another tussle
Yo, during the fight the gun went off quick
Damn—Ah shit, I'm hit
[Interlude: (Tamica) & Bushwick Bill]
(Oh, Lord! Oh, Bill!)
Ahh... my eye, I can't see
(Oh, I'm so sorry!)
Why you shot me in the eye?
(Oh my God, somebody help me!)
I would've shot you in the body
(Oh, I'm sorry!)
Why you shot me in the eye?

[Verse 2: Bushwick Bill]
Riding in the ambulance, everything is hectic
I can't get a grip, I just can't check this
Everybody's crying, could it be I'm dying?
Bullet in my head, in the bed I was lying
Where's 'Mica? I wanna tell her I love her
With an IV in my arm, I took a picture for an album cover
Goddamn, this shit's a trip, G
Five different doctors with needles tryna stick me
I hear my family hollering, ""He needs us!""
During the confusion, man, I seen Jesus
My mom's on the phone, long-distance, from New York
Here comes the doctors again, trying to rip me apart
I got a monkey on my back, I can't shake this
I'm having suicidal thoughts, hoping that I don't make it
But I'ma make it, 'cause something's steady urging me
Five hours passed, I made it through surgery
And the doctor said I wouldn't make it through the night
But God told me, ""Everything is gonna be alright""
And I'm glad that I'm here, G
But it's fucked up I had to lose an eye to see shit clearly"

Never chase girls, chase dreams first
Motion picture drive, I concluded that my Dreamworks
So I pace right, never see my brake lights
Never trust a person but fam. Too many great whites
Never work without merit, never live but don’t cherish, cause we only born to perish
This is a luxury, tariff
Here to preach a brand new sermon, Eric
And it’s hysteric, they say you too pretentious, don’t get into that
Never the same, I went left like a Democrat
I would like to present you with this rap award
And I got more gigs than a Apple store
Ayo, you wildin’, boy, you ain’t even stylin', boy
It’s like I’m on a boat, feeling lonely on this island, boy
My life will never be the same
If never ever was, you’ll probably feel my pain

Give me the light, Sean Paul, ‘02

I thought I killed it, though they could not hear my vocals
Damn, and they say why you roll that great stuff?
I take a pull and wonder why the Beatles break up
Imagination is magic, so when I wake up
Feel like I’m lookin' out at Hogwarts
Would it be wrong to have meetings in my ball shorts?
The flow excessive like cops, when they using what you call force
Xaph, this beat, you probably should have brung to West
I swear I’m never like a nun when it comes to sex
And yea, I p-p-p-poker face, her best bet

Three loaded clips, four niggas roll, one nigga drives
Five hundred Benz, six reasons why this kid should die
We shooting every mothafucka outside
Pulled on his block, jumped out the car
Guns in our hand, at the same time everybody ran
There that nigga go, hiding in the crowd
Let the trigger blow, seven shots now he lying on the ground
Blood on the floor then we shot some more
Niggas he was with two niggas hit, one nigga fell
One tried to run, go get him son
Make sure he's done 'fore we bail, I ain't tryna go to jail
Must handle beef, code of the street, load up the heat
If these nigga think they could fuck around
Real niggas do real things by all means
Niggas knowing how we get down, it goes

Driving through roads, Suburban Chevrolet
Six tinted windows, and I'm on my way
To get up with my hoes, I pull up to they house
Not a freak to be heard, nobody came out
Ringing the bell, where in the hell, could they be at?
I'm about to leave stepping slow, where my truck was at
Who the fuck is that? Could it be a jack?
Now pull my strap, it's my man and we have the same plan
There them bitches go, Civic '94
Looking funny though, open up the car door, funny smile
Fuck two already, third ass was heavy
""Nas this is Sherry, Sherry this is Nas and his man, ready?""
Walked in the house, snatched off they clothes
Ran through them hoes, plenty ice, that they all seemed to like
Can't find my man, heard a blam-blam
Now I'm wondering, ""In this scam, do I even stand a chance?""
He killed the hoes, took all they dough
Fire in his eyes, higher than the sky coming down the stairs
Now he wanting mine, reaching for my nine
Aiming with our guns at each others face, at the same time
My nine on his lips, his fifth on my chin, I start whispering
""Put your gun down, we can skip town""
Rocked him to sleep, pushed back his meat
Lift off his chain, took his shit, emptied out close range

Wordsmith,Chino XL,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: Chino XL]
Perfection, flawless, masterpiece, no mistakes
Back in the 1800s, I was burned at the stake (I am the Wordsmith)
Metaphor Mephistopheles, degrees I’ve achieved, the brain
Fluid it takes to believe would equal the seven seas (I am the Wordsmith)
I could reveal the true name of God, you’d go insane upon
Hearing it, release enough winds to blow down pyramids (I am the Wordsmith)
I’m the Michelangelo of syllables.  Since I freestyle
Genesis been Biblical—that’s something you got to give in to

[Verse 1: Chino XL]
Since born in my mama vaginal sauna
As a sonogram, I been fond of phonics
It’s ironic.  Even as an embryonic
Fed through an umbilical—don’t that sound biblical?
I’ve been a terror since I teareth out of that uterus
Evil plans were made to defeat us as a fetus
Though now I walk in infamy, as a child, they had it in for me
Was raised with guns and infantry in diapers at an infancy
The childhood of a hood that was raised in the hood: cops said
“Put your hands in the hot sky,” threw my hands down on the hot hood
Can’t whine or drink wine—nine planets planned it
‘Til it became apparent my parents shouldn’t have been a parent
State to state, we ran some.  I wasn’t worth no ransom
Money, won’t you hand some?  A nigga wasn’t handsome
Raised the mind like Charles Manson’s.  Knew I was some man’s son
But which one?  That made me strong, created my poison tongue

[Verse 2: Chino XL]
While you cut school ‘cause you ain’t feel too good
I cut school ‘cause my cuts ain’t heal too good
Through all the physical abuse, my mind escaped through the gift
Of wordplay, I memorized encyclopedias and dictionaries.  I wrote
Anthems from antonyms, harmonies from homonyms
Created cinema from synonyms, livid to eliminate that
Illustrious life you’re living in, wrote rhetoricals in rhythms, I could
Paralyze with a parable, make rhymes out of religion
Crucify you with a prefix or suffocate you with a suffix
Wrote lectures so infectious, it’s known to infect the listeners
Who dissing us?  Yo, punks, you wait.  I punctuate
My karma’s the comma that put you inside of a coma
Hyphen, dot, dot, semicolon, leave you semi-swollen
Question mark, you pregnant?  Oh, you’re not.  I love you, period
To sum it up, language is my essence.  Fucked up
In all my adolescence ‘til my moms was out of lessons
Laws, I store convenient.  Still, I robbed the convenience store
Love Mom/fuck Mom—shit, I ain’t love me no more
Mentally, it didn’t register, bitch!  Empty the register, bitch!
You’re just a cashier, bitch!  Give the cash here!
I’ll shoot you in your cabbage, hijack a getaway cab, bitch
Words ain’t making me no loot, don’t change no Dow Jones average
Regardless, we’re Godless.  They stole my innocence in a sense
The judge sentenced me to three lifetimes sentences
To write my life and times in sentences, art my dark arch
Nemesis.  They want me off the premises—that’s what the premise is
Locked on a tier where you can’t shed a tear at
Studied more Shakespeare than any African shakes his spear at
And the whole world fear that (Uh huh), and it hurts.  I got
Caught killing time, but then I got away with words

People can say whatever they want about me, but agree
That I am the Wordsmith (I am the Wordsmith)
They can try to ignore everything that I’ve achieved, but agree
That I am the Wordsmith (I am the Wordsmith).  Yo
The love of words is deep in my veins, helps me
To silence my pain.  I am the Wordsmith (Oh, I am the Wordsmith)
Even if never move a million units, it’s my blessing
How I do it.  I’m the Wordsmith (I am the Wordsmith)

I’m in
A game full of morons (True) and they keep putting more on (True)
I tutor the Tora, I'm in the core of the Quran
The mind’s what I represent, and emcees better re-present
I’m taking this rapping bullshit to the fullest extent
I have reservations why Indians are on reservations
Told the board of education I was bored of education
As far as this go, I leave you deader than disco
Rocking sex and violence over sax and violins
Through your mind’s camera lens, you’re in need of an ambulance
I’ll knock you to the asphalt—it’s your own ass’ fault
Your last thought: I’ll never sell myself short to be famous
And taking it up the anus just ain’t us
The world could get the penis of this classical-trained pianist
My P.O. was p.o.’d, handed me a cup, told me to pee in this
The linguist musician, my college position’s my intuition
Told me I wouldn’t be affording tuition
My education’s all on my own, so I might have been
Born yesterday, but I rhyme like there’s no tomorrow

Speak Your Mind,Immortal Technique,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
You have to speak the truth
You have to speak your mind

[Verse 1]
Every time I speak my mind I'm lyrically critical
The pinnacle of being revolutionarily pivotal
Beyond anything ever studied that's metaphysical
Man, fuck a minority, I'm not politically minimal
But obviously terminologies that are statistical
Are manufactured to be unequivocally subliminal
Transmitted by monopolized media visuals
So I riddle hypocritically pitiful criminals
Habitually utilizing typical rituals
With false pretense in attempts to be spiritual
To individuals who believe in Biblical miracles
Instead of themselves, 'cause they're not thinkin' original
And the color of their skin makes them feel invisible
Like microscopic miscarriages lynched with the umbilical
Only a fuckin' imbecile would think they're uncorrectable
'Cause you're susceptible to becomin' more than a spectacle
Remember that your flesh, your blood, and your body are dissectable; I'll beat you until you're a vegetable
And wake up in a hospital, covered in poisonous chemicals
In a fetal position with your face sewn to your testicles
Thinkin' that you were kidnapped by extraterrestrials
You got heart? I'm the blood that pumps in your ventricles
Technique, I'm like your soul, nigga, indispensable
With no respect for those who cower at the hour of revolution
'Cause the government owes my people restitution
Instead of sedatives like cocaine and prostitution
Conclusion is that you'll have to violently silence me
'Cause I raid the airwaves of cutthroat piracy
In school my teachers blinded me, but now I can see
Now I'm mentally and revolutionarily free
Broadenin' horizons about what my people could be
If we wasn't set up to get shot, locked, or OD
You see families bleed because of corporate greed
And monopolizin' weed is virtually impossible
So it won't be legalized, and that's another obstacle
But I'm still rollin' up pocket fulls of tropical
The government's involved directly, so it's unstoppable
Like a nuclear rocket full of biochemical toxins
That invade the ecological
Improbable that the average intellect could understand
So I encrypted this into hip hop that's in high demand
And spread it through the ghetto of every city like contraband
Stomp a man of any complexion with a devilish nature
'Cause I'm tryin' to save the Earth
But you're just gettin' in line to rape her"

Brendas Got a Baby,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Dave Hollister]
Brenda's got a baby
Brenda's got a baby

[Verse: 2Pac]
I hear Brenda's got a baby, but Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name
""That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family""
Well, let me show you how it affects our whole community
Now Brenda really never knew her moms
And her dad was a junkie, puttin' death into his arms
It's sad, 'cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow
But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
Who really didn't care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came, they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
She's twelve years old and she's havin' a baby
In love with a molester, who's sexin' her crazy
And yet and all she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world where the two of them are together
Whatever, he left her and she had the baby solo
She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know, so
She didn't know what to throw away and what to keep
She wrapped the baby up and threw him in a trash heap
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries
She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes
Now the baby's in the trash heap, bawlin'
Mama can't help her, but it hurts to hear her callin'
Brenda wants to run away
Mama say ""You makin' me lose pay
There's social workers here every day""
Now Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money, no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
She tried to sell crack but end up gettin' robbed
So now, what's next? It ain't nothin' left to sell
So she sees sex as a way of leavin' hell
It's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute found slain, and Brenda's her name
She's got a baby

Before we go any further
Friends

[Verse]
As you call 'em, they call you when they need something
Trees for the bluntin', to G's for the frontin'
I found a way to get peace of mind for years and left the hell alone
Turn a deaf ear to the cellular phone
Send me a letter or better, we could see each other in real life
Just so you could feel me like a steel knife
At least so you could see the white of they eyes
Bright with surprise, once they finish spitting lies
Associates, is your boys, your girls, bitches, niggas, homies
Close, or really don't know me
Mom, dad, comrade, peeps, brothers, sisters, duns, dunnies
Some come around when they need some money
Others make us laugh like the Sunday funnies
Fam be around whether you paid or bummy
You could either ignore this advice or take it from me
Be too nice and people take you for a dummy
So nowadays, he ain't so friendly
Actually they wouldn’t even made a worthy enemy
Read the signs: ""No feeding the baboons""
Seein' as how they got ya back bleeding from the stab wounds
Y'all know the dance, they smile in ya face, y'all know the glance
Try to put 'em on, they blow the chance
Never let your so-called mans know your plans
(How many of us have them?) A show of hands
(Friends) is a term some people use loosely
I'm real choosy on what I choose to let crew see
You telling me; I try to act broke
Jealousy the number one killer among black folk
Fellas be under some type of spell like crack smoke
Ghetto Cinderellas lead 'em right to your stack, loc
Just another way a chick'll lead to your end
I checked the dictionary for the meaning of friend
It said: ""person one likes to socialize with
Sympathizer, helper"", and that's about the size of it
Most of the time these attributes is one-sided
To bolster the crime, they're apt to shoot you through your eyelid
And they can't hide it, going wild like a white bitch
Sometimes ya need to cut niggas off like a light switch
(Flick!) And when things get quiet
Catch 'em like a thief in the night, what a riot
I first met Mr. Fantastik at a arms deal
Don't let it get drastic, think of how your moms'll feel
When it get for real, steel get to sparkin'
Everything darken, it ain't no talkin'
For somethin' so cheap, it sure buys a lot of trouble
Ya better off focusing than tryin' to plot to bubble
Or else it'd be a sad note to end on, the guns we got is
(One's we can depend on, friends)
Some come in the form of co-dependents
A lot of times only end up being co-defendants
Ten bucks say they tell for a lower sentence
And leave you up under the jail, begging for repentance
It don't make no sense, what happened to the loyalty?
Honor amongst crooks, trust among royalty
I'd rather go out in a blaze than give 'em the glory
(How many of us have—) a similar story?
(Friends) before lovers, we used to have some type of over-standing
Just so when I let her get the man thing
She know it's no strings, we could do the damn thing
But ho, it's no rings, just how the tramp swings
Will she see him again? That depends on
""How good was the skins?"" and ""Could she memorize the lessons?""
It ain't no need to pretend
Even though she let him stab it, she know they're just friends
[Outro]
Friends
How many of us have them?
Friends
Ones we can depend on?
Friends
How many of us have them?
Friends
Before we go any further

[Skit]
Fellas! Don't be silly! I know who my friends are!
And the next nice neighborhood I move into, you guys'll get crack'
(Negro humor always escaped me.)

[Outro Skit: Character 1; Mr. Fantastic; (Invisible Woman);
Dr. DOOM; Character 2]
The most powerful, the most mysterious monarch in all the world
Guided by a fighting force that never sleeps
That never relaxes its vigilance
For none is as feared, none has as many foes
As DOOM, the awesome armorclad lord of
I know who Doom is (Then tell us)
He happens to be the most dangerous man in the world
I’d hope we’d never hear from him
I’d hope we’d never have to battle him
But now the worst has happened and I must tell you what we’re up against
I first met DOOM years ago
When he wanted to be alone, alone to pursue his forbidden experiments
One day while conducting a secret experiment
[Explosion sounds] Later, when he recovered from his injuries
Instead of having learned his lesson, DOOM was bitter, angry, vengeful
[Woman screams] What have I done to myself?
My face, it is hideous
He traveled the world, seeking a cure for his disfigured face
(I’m sorry sir, there is nothing we can do for you)
He traveled through remote villages, where strangers are seldom seen
He continued his search, never showing his face
Unless threatened by bandits who prey on travelers
Who foolishly wander alone through their domain"

Is Brooklyn in here tonight?!?!?!?

[Hook: Notorious B.I.G.]
Where Brooklyn at?

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I'm right here, Big
Your boy sitting on top like a hair wig
Bed-Stuy fly, Bushwick sick
East New York walk the Brownsville grill, ill
You see, I got a Fort Greene lean
Clinton Hill chill, Red Hook look, man
Ain't no shook hands in Brooklyn
Son, your life can get took, man
Then threw off bridges
One hard top, two soft bitches
Ride through the borough with two four fifths-es
Phantom open up like two door fridges
I make 'em change the New York digits
From 718 to 187, from 212 to 211
Your boy's back with a new one son, huh!
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I'm right here Fab, waving the flag, I'm from Nostrand Ave
I came to take the game in my Daddy Kane chain
Niggas gave it up smooth
They ain't want to hear the bang, BANG
I'm back on my bully shit
That Flatbush, Bushwick black hoodie shit
Half a billie in the bank roll
Bank stop anybody, what's your bank, ho?
Big B's on the wheel
Spread love the Brooklyn way, B how's it feel?
I'm on my Robin Thicke shit
Shit ever gets thick, back to robbing niggas quick
Trick, click, ante up
All you niggas Britney, pull your panties up
Whole borough is with me, hold your cannons up
Buck one for Bucktown, Brooklyn, what the fuck?!!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Uncle Murda]
I'm right here Hov!
East New York, Uncle Murda feeling good
I hooked up with Jigga, got my grandma out the hood
Marcy is back -- now look at niggas
Now they can't say Jay ain't sign a Brooklyn nigga
Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
Shooting somebody up or getting off the packs
Or going to the club looking for something to yap
Or running up in the crib like, ""Where the safe at?""
East New York will shoot you -- they dap your homey
Brownsville will rob ya -- they clap your homey
Bed-Stuy will get you killed for a hundred grams
Get a Coney Island nigga to pull the trigga, man
Ask Flex -- he used to run the Tunnel
Brooklyn had dudes scared to rep they borough
Uncle Murda, I'mma rep to the fullest
Like Shyne, in the club I throw bullets
[Outro: Fabolous]
Ha son!!! It's a like it or not thing, nah mean?
This one is for Brooklyn, I'm in my Bed-Stuy fly, you know
Bushwick sick, I walk that East New York walk, Brownsville grill
Got my Fort Greene lean, ha ha, Clinton Hill chill, Red Hook look
That Flatbush push, nah mean Cypress Hill feel
Crown Heights tight with it, the Williamsburg swerve
Coney Island styling on 'em, Canarsie flossing
Park Slope dope you know, ya dig?"

A superhero in the flesh
Even at my worst, I'm the best
For the finish, I stretch
When they advance me this check
Coulda bought my way to heaven but I blow it on my neck instead
What you expect when you ain't have shit
And they ain't paying half of what you asking
Couldn't even see the pussy even if it's Cassie
Lot of hoes are down for taking pictures cause you're flashy
You can't even imagine, maybe Kim Kardashian
Number one song and a Grammy, now I'm smashing
Maserati crashing, swerving through the traffic
Wrap it 'round a pole, sell a mil off the tragedy
I defy gravity, flyer than I have to be
Talking to the Lord, ""I can't stay, who gon' save hip hop after me?""
It's like a torn ACL to an athlete, Boobie Miles, Friday Lights, capture me
In my hometown

[Hook]
King city, K-King city ('round my hometown)
Third coast representer, Mississippi sipping lean (memories are fresh)
King city, K-King city ('round my hometown)
Third coast representer, Mississippi sipping lean (ooh, the people I've met)
300, 300, my stomping ground (are the wonders of my world)

300, 300, my stomping ground (are the wonders of this world)
King City, M-Town, Hometown Hero (are the wonders and now)
[Verse 2 - Yelawolf]
Alabama homie, I wear it like a hat
I'm a small town boy, I'm so proud of that
Some people leave it, they fall til they fall flat
I just wanna bring it home, and give it all back
Cause given all that, what's been given to me
A successful rapper, huh?, I might as well hit the lottery
So instead of becoming a diamond-wearing novelty
I rock beads and buy my mama some property
Tell the white boys in the pick up truck that Yelawolf is coming home
For the Chevrolet dunkriders in the projects and the trailer park zones
You might've seen my face in a couple pages in the XXL
But if I can't walk around in my own neighborhood, then leave that shit on the shelf
Took the keys to the old Chevelle, cause if I'm in a boat by myself
Then everything I catch will go bad, see all I wanna do is share
Give it away, give it away, everybody come take what you can hold now
Gadsden, I love you, lemme introduce the world to my hometown

[Verse 3 - Big K.R.I.T.]
It's just Ciroc in the cooler
Not a day off, but I'm still Ferris Bueller
Winners never lose, so how dare you confuse us
They quote what I spit like Confucius
He say, she say, rumors all day
The rap game is high school, and life's a hallway
Like what clique you in
The Beamer or the Benz
The Bentley or the Lambo
Like here we go again
Don't sit at my table
VIP, I got this
If you ain't popping champagne after every game then don't pop shit
Homecoming queen with my picture in her locket
But I know what's up with her hands in my pockets
They love me cause my swag is so jock-ish
Freshman year, saw a ring like I'm boxing
You voted most likely to never ever top this
I'm Michael Jordan, Dennis Rodman

You find me offensive, I find you offensive
For finding me offensive, hence, if
I should draw the line or any fences, if so, to what extents, if
Any, should I go? 'Cause it's getting expensive
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say I cause extensive psychological nerve damage to the brain
When I go to lengths this far at other people's expenses
I say you're all just too goddamn sensitive
It's censorship, and it's downright blasphemous
Let's end this shit now, 'cause I won't stand for this
And Chris-stiff-pher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too, I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me, I even believe I
Had one of those twenty-five-cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must've put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault, 'cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luthor
I killed Superman, I killed Super—
Man, and how ironic
That I'd be the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic
[Chorus: Eminem]
'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you

Now in the Bible, it says:
""Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed
Have homosexual sex
Unless, of course, you were given the consent to join in
Then, of course, it's intercourse, and it's bisexual sex
Which isn't as bad
'Long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before, during, or after
Performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to as such more commonly-known phrases
That are more used by today's kids in a more derogatory way
But who's to say what's fair to say and what not to say?""
Let's ask Dr. Dre—Dr. Dre? (What up?)
I got a question, if I may (Yeah)
Is it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend? (Yeah)
And watch his butt-butt when he tees off? (Yeah)
But— 'ut, I ain't done yet
In football, the quarterback yells out, ""Hut-hut""
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts, but, just, what if
It was never meant—it was just an accident
But he tripped, fell, slipped, and his penis went in—
His teeny-tiny, little, round heinie, and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't need to go into any more details, but
What if he pictured it as a female's butt?
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up
'Til then, I'll just walk around with a manly strut, because

You find me offensive, I find you offensive—
Shit, this is the same verse, I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider sense is telling me Spider-Man is nearby
And my plan is to get him next and
Open up a whoop-ass canister
God damn it, Dre, where's the goddamn beat? (Yeah)
Anyway, anyway, I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good-at
I am the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic
Demonic—yup, yup, don't worry, I'm on it
I got it, high-five Nick Lachey
Stuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away (*Pfffffff*)
And as she flew around the room like a balloon, I
Grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can, and zoom, I
Headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter-jelly-chicken-tuna sandwich
And I ain't even gotta make no goddamn sense
I just did a whole song, and I didn't say shit

Ms. Rodeo, tell me where your day go
Part-time waitress, she really want to make it
In the ""City of Lights"", it's hard to see clear
She don't really care about anyone advice
And nothing here's real, and everyone's alike
Cause everyone dreams of the millionaire's life
She barely eats at all, if she do she eats light
Indulging a meal when a toilet's insight
Expose those fries, can't hold those down

This is Heaven on Hell
This is how she want to live
But she ain't really tripping, she's on Beverly Hills

She sing, model, and dance, but can't sit still
Believing the screens or anything there
But reality shows ain't real
So pretentious with no potential
She goes to catch up, although her rent's up
In her defense she a part of the crowd
She going to borrow some money
So she can party at Chows
It's apart of her goal
It's all she knows
Graduated from Rosé, addicted to blow
Addicted to stardom, a wish to blow
So she kisses the stars
And she gives them a blow
After every show, a dream she hold
Inhibitions is gone, she just want to be known
She want to be know, she just want to be known
Pulling down her skirt

Never ever pay rent

Lease on the whip
Beach on the weekend
Hotel suite, room keys is a gift
Dream of the fame or a ring on her finger
Now you just a whore to the known entertainers
Word spreads fast that your knees spread quick

Look, cocaine addiction, apartment eviction
To add to the list of Beverly Hills victims
Hold on you can see my vision
Next time you look down on a nigga

Im Illy,T.I.,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Rebel for the hell of it, hella rich
Never have to sell a brick again—must I tell a bitch again?
The bullshit, I'm addressing; check, I'm on some next-level shit
Never been fucked in the game: I'm celibate
Rarely out my element, barely out the ghetto with
One foot out and one foot in, intelligent as fellas get
Listen, let's settle this; be clear—
I could fall back seven years; still, it ain't no one ahead of me
Consider it a blessing if you get to stand next to me
Five-star general, OG veteran
Caked like Entenmann's, blowing that celery
Stack that cash like the U.S. Treasury
Every single thing I ever did was done heavily
Rap until you're seventy, still ain't no catching me
Put it on my pops, Big Phil, and Beverly
Be standing on the top still after they bury me
Nose in the air: So stuck-up, arrogant
Ain't got long, hot songs: Best cherish it
'Cause when I drop mine, that's over: finito
You payin' for your foul like a free throw—bow!
Now, how could a nigga think that he could see me?
Other than the magazine covers or the TV?
Know I sold more mixtapes than your CD
You're waiting on your big break, praying you could be me
And you ain't made it far as D.C
On the low, I been all around the globe
Like a god, how they treat me
Broads hit they knees, eyes closed when they greet me
Mouth wide open, just begging me to skeet-skeet
You in a deep sleep—stop dreaming
I'm six albums in; for ten years, I been firing hot semen
The limelight's mine, I'm gleaming, beaming
Ask why I say I'm king? Bitch, I got my reasons (Hey!)

Wrist so frostbit (Yuh), neck so chilly (Bling)
All on my mind is to get more millys (Guap)

Really? (Yuh) Nigga, I'm illy (Ayy)

[Verse 2]
Where niggas get off? Piss off! (Yeah)
Me and mine ought to take time to pop a lid off
Shit, all over the whereabouts of me
Is y'all sick in your fuckin' mind? You figuring I'ma fizzle
Never cooled off: Tip scorching
Minimal injury, though they wishing me maximum misfortune
Number one, hands down; flows paint portraits
Everybody thinks you stink like horse shit
House full of chicks on some Girl Next Door shit
A king of oneself, thirty mil' out the store, quick
Of course, this case—lost all my endorsements
Tripled up on real estate, still buying more shit
But Tip bankrupt, according to your sources
I'm still caked up, along with more reinforcements
Tore shit up from the lobby to the rooftops
Officially the hottest nigga rapping since 2Pac
'Fore you rap 'bout me, best ask 'bout me
I'm out my fucking mind, need counseling
Please, don't doubt me; trust me, drama ain't nothing
It's all fun and games 'til somebody start busting
Limit my discussion when rappers be battling
I find out about it, better get to skee-daddling
Pack your family bags, move 'em out to Seattle, and
We ever cross paths, you'll need ambulance and bandages
Live life glamorous, so extravagant
Mandarin, Oriental, worldwide traveling
Hip-hop champion for real, though
You couldn't fuck with me with a Brazil ho, nigga

Too Many Rappers,Beastie Boys,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro - Nas]
Mic check, mic check

[Hook - Nas] (Beastie Boys)
One (one), two (two), three (three)
Too many rappers, and there's still not enough MCs
It goes three (three), two (two), one (one)
MCA, Adrock, Mike D, that's how we get it done
Like ladies and gents, attention
Nas in the house with Beastie Boys
We can turn it out
Perpetrators, we can point 'em out
So if you got somethin' on your mind, let it out

[MCA]
Yo, I been in the game since before you was born
I might still be MCing even after you're gone
Strange thought, I know, but my skills still grow
The 80s, the 90s, 2000s, and so
On and on until the crack of dawn
Until the year 3000 and beyond
Stay up all night, and I MC and never die
Cause death is the cousin of sleep
[Ad-Rock]
Because I'm back with a bang, boogie, oogie-oogie
Strawberry Letter 23 like Shuggie
Oh my God, just look at me
Grandpa been rappin' since '83
I'm supersonic like J.J. Fad
Got crazy-ass shit pullin' out the bag
Don't forget the tartar sauce, yo, cause it's sad
All these crab rappers, they're rappin' like crabs

[Nas]
I have carte blanche, the vagabond
Nas is the narcissist, my pockets are rotund
I'm no killa, but compared to you, I'm more real'a
You ain't a shot, a mobster, or a drug dealer
A slug peeler, you're not
Mafioso, no
You ain't got the cut-throat in ya, beginner
I ain't tryin' to hear your racket
You work with police, dog, you snitch, you rat
You wear that jacket

[Mike D]
How many rappers must get dissed
Gimme eight bars, and watch me bless this
I start to reminisce, ooh, when I miss
The real hip hop with which I persist
Like rum in mojitos
Bullets and banditos
Matzoh balls in soup
Jackets and troop
Yes, y'all, this is one for the history books
Nasty Nas, what's the word?
Count it off on the hook
[Hook]

[MCA]
Cause this the type of lyric goes inside your brain
To blow you bullshit rappers straight out the frame
My lyrics spin 'round like a hurricane twister
So get your hologram on off-a Wolf Blitzer
Too many rappers to shake a stick at
I oughta charge a tax for every weak rap I had to listen to
Cause we be makin' stacks like Stax Records
My squad, we gotta pact -- we're never coming wack

[Ad-Rock]
To all you crab rappers and hackers
And circuit benders tweaked on Splenda
I take the cake, I stole the mold
The golden microphone, well, that's mine to hold
And why all these biters all up in my crotchspace?
Sniffin', buffin', huffin'
And mean muggin' with a Blimpie Bluffin
Back up off me, suckas, you ain't sayin' nothin'

[Nas]
I'm broader than Broadway, I was the project hallway
Dual tape recorder, lacin' oratorials all day
I'm just getting started on this beat, this is foreplay
And when this song's finished, y'all can sing along with this
By the way, I have a strong fetish for Christian Louboutin steppers
I hear Russian blonde's the wettest
But anyway, I better pay homage to my fellas
And that's what's on my mind and the rhyme, who's next up?
[Mike D]
Mike D, the man of mystery
History in the makin', and now we're takin'
Titles, awards, and accolades
Scarin' the competition as I sharpen my blades
We come together like peanut butter and sandwiches
Like pen and paper, like Picasso and canvases
Rockin' stadiums and shitty bars
Go back in time, send a fax from my car

My guts on a cut like this one
Make sure you don't miss none
Of the rhymes from the clean and crisp one
People of the planet Earth, man, it hurts to see
People livin in poverty, there's got to be a better way to live
We gotta learn to give more love, that's the only alternative
Just the other day I was speakin to my man Rob
And I said, ""Yo Rob, what's up hops?""
He said, ""Lak man, I just can't stand
And I don't understand the ignorance of a blackman
Too many crackheads, tackheads and bloodshed
Brothers and sisters are fightin instead of unitin
We need to cut it out, we're self-destructin
You know what we need, Lak?"" ""What Rob?"" ""We need more lovin""

(Gotta get some lovin)

We're self-destructin
That's why we gotta get more lovin
Love the fact that you're black if you are black
Beamin up to Scotty is wack, this ain't Star Trek
Be not weak but be strong and watch out for the attack
Of those that might try to hold ya back
I'm the type of guy that likes to spread peace
Not the type of guy that'll leave your achy
You've been sleeping too long, you need your bed reached
Wake up before you end up a dead sheep
Innocent till proven guilty, yeah, that makes sense
The blacks, we're guilty till we're proven innocent
To get where I got to my approach was different
Now you know why I'm so militant
I got a handful of love, yeah, take a crunch
But be positive, you come negative, you get punched
One bad apple don't spoil a whole bunch
We can make it - get my hunch?
Stop your snakeous mischievin, your lyin and thievin
And love the fact that you're alive and breathin
Love is the key, see, to unity, without it there's nothin
So let's all show a little more lovin

Break it down like this

Love could be the start of many things
We all know the sorrow and joy it brings
Set your goals in life and believe in your dreams
And maybe one day it might come true, yo, know what I mean?
Stop complainin, we need to crack down
I heard of Chinatown but never of Blacktown
By any means necessary I'm not havin it
Anymore we need our own establishments
People of the world, it's plain to see
We need to spread a little more l-o-v-e
Nothin in the world is gonna come to you free
So let's get work together and make money
Some of us are so blind we don't understand, see
We're jealous and envious and wonder why can't we
Live in unity as one big family
I show a lot of love for those that are down with me
And we'll hold on through thick and thin
Cause we're brothers and sisters, more than just friends
Destroy negative and build the positive
Do what you wanna do, that's your prerogative
Stick together, no matter the weather
Let no one stop ya, I'm sure you can prosper
We need to cut it out, we're self-destructin
Play ya part, open your heart and spread some lovin"
The Manipulation Pt. 2,Wale,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Wale]
I got that better love, that no one better love, that here today gone tomorrow but this forever love
Let me mine you until your vagina is wet enough and fill your mind with pleasant thoughts
Champaign by your tub, rose petals as she walk, you know the floor don't need to see you
I got that good stroke, come be my Mona Lisa
You see, them other guys pay their mind to your physical features
And I can admire your body but your mind is much deeper
And I found me a keeper, and I found me a winner, and I found me a queen
What we eatin' for dinner? You know I cook it and clean it and do whatever for you
Black mother of the earth you know I forever owe you
I would never ignore you ‘cause I'm forever loyal
Let's fall in love, let me put my seed in your soil
See it'd be an honor to create life with you; can I lay right with you? And wake you up with light kisses?
Good mornin' sunshine, see the more I see your eyes is the more that I admire you
Whenever you tired I be right there beside, the pillow talk and confide, make your secrets all mine
May I sleep between your thighs and wake up deeply in your heart?
And you're mindful forever and repeat when we get up
I ain't even gonna front girl I think you is the one, so let's fall asleep with the moon and I will greet you with the sun

I don't respect no brain unless we talkin' that saliva spit
Ho I got a lot of bread, lot of whips, lot of chicks
You can be demolished then be gone without acknowledgement
This just how it got to be, this is how I got to live
I don't care about your drive unless you talkin' ridin' dick
You is just a groupie bitch and groupie bitch, no I am sick

Hey yo, Doctor, here's another proper track
And it's fat, watch the sniper, time to pay the piper
And let that real shit provoke
See, you's a wannabe 'loc, and you'll get smoked, and I hope
That your fans understand when you talk about sprayin' me
The same records that you makin' is payin' me
Motherfuck Dre! Motherfuck Snoop! Motherfuck Death Row!
Yo, and here comes my left blow
'Cause I'm the E-A-Z-Y-E and this is the season
To let the real motherfuckin' G's in
You're like a kid, you found a pup, and now you're dapper
But tell me, where the fuck you found an anorexic rapper?
Talkin' 'bout who you gon' squabble with and who you shoot
You're only sixty pounds when you're wet and wearin' boots
(Damn, E, they tried to fade you on Dre Day)
But Dre Day only meant Eazy's payday
All of a sudden Dr. Dre is the G Thang
But on his own album cover he was a she-thang
So, nigga please, nigga please
Don't step to these muthaphuckkin' real G's

[Verse 2: Dresta]
Every day it's a new rapper claimin' to be dapper than the Dresta
Softer than a bitch but portray the role of gangsta
Ain't broke a law in your life
Yet every time you rap you yap about the guns and knife
Just take a good look at the nigga and you'll capture
The fact that the master is simply just an actor
Who mastered the bang and the slang and the mental
Of niggas in Compton, Watts, and South Central
Never ever once have you ran with the turf
But yet in every verse claim you used to do the dirt
But tell me, who's a witness to your fuckin' work?
So you never had no bid'ness, so save the drama, jerk!
Niggas straight kill me, knowin' that they pranksters
This is goin' out to you studio gangstas
See, I did dirt, put in work, and many niggas can vouch that
So since I got stripes, I got the right to rap about that
But niggas like you, I gotta hate ya
'Cause I'm just tired of suburbia niggas
Talkin' about they come from projects
Knowin' you ain't seen the parts of the streets, G
Think you started tryna bang around the time of the peace treaty
Wearin' khakis and mob while you rhyme
Little fag tried to sag, but you're floodin' at the same time
And your set don't accept ya; scared to kick it with your homies
'Cause you know they don't respect ya
So, nigga please, check nuts
Before you step to these muthaphuckkin' real G's
[Verse 3: B.G. Knocc Out]
Well, it's the Knocc Out, definition ""Original baby gangsta""
Approach me like you hard, motherfucker, I'ma bank ya
Shank ya, with my fuckin' shank, if I have to
Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are fuckin' actors
Pranksters, studio gangstas, busters
But this time you're dealin' with some real motherfuckers
G's, nigga please, don't try to step
'Cause if you do, then a peeled cap is all that would be left
See, young niggas like me will break you off somethin'
Claimin' my city — but Dre, you ain't from Compton
Niggas like y'all is what I call wannabes
And ain't shit compared to real muthaphuckkin' G's

I never met a O.G. who never did shit wrong
You tried to diss the Eazy-E, so now, nigga, it's on
You and your Doggy Dogg think that y'all hoggin' shit
Both of you bitches can come and suck my Doggy dick
Beatin' up a bitch don't make you shit, but then again
Some niggas think it makes a man
Damn, it's a trip how a nigga could switch so quick
From wearin' lipstick to smokin' on chronic at picnics
And now you think you're bigger
But to me you ain't nothin' but a bitch-ass nigga
That ain't worth a food stamp
And at Death Row, I hear you gettin' treated like boot camp
Gotta follow your sergeant's directions
Or get your ass pumped with the Smith & Wesson
Learn a lesson from the Eaze
Stay in your place and don't step to real muthaphuckkin' G's

Kookies,MF DOOM,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
It's horrible
One lonely evening alone, home
End up with carpal tunnel syndrome
And here I am, known for giving heavy back aches
Grown and living off of Little Debbie snack cakes
Supposed to be checking emails
All I got is messages from ass naked females
I don't know a Jenny
She said it's free and I won't owe her a penny
And that's the last time I saw her
But thousands of more horrors on online Gomorrah
And Sodom, they got 'em with they curls out
And they got a better sales pitch than the Girl Scouts
I wonder what I owe her
For a whole box of caramel coconut samoa
(""Nite nite!"") Uh, okay honey, sweet dreams
Now it's time to get serious like Peek Freans
A metal handful, wipe it on the quilt
Wife wake up and I'm kill't over spilt milk
Locked in, looking at your picture
Fully clothed winter and I'm right there with ya
Thinking about the last time I split your wishbone
A man could only wish you do the same 'til he get home
Fat chance, at least he get snacks
That'd have to do 'til a brother get back
Until then smack One-Eyed Jack
And hope one of his peoples can hook him with a tri-pack
That's three different flavors
Chocolate, vanilla and strawberry wafers
Acting all hard, 'bout to get beat up
I'll show him what time it is once I get this sheet up
Soon as he fell off the beat down
All I hear is, ""13th cell, put the sheet down""
Damn C.O., what the hell do she know?
Besides the fact she wanna get dug out on the d-low
A workaholic with a fountain in the ink pen
Out in the mountains and I stopped drinking again
In the wee hours, he's gotten farther
Needing three showers, being hot and bothered
The wiz with her legs bent, pregnant
God bless the day she wondered where her egg went
I need a L, it's hard to drink without it
And could use some kookies but trying not to think about it
Watching ""BET"" on jazz for knowledge on file
Every other commercial, college hoes gone wild
Soft batch, I prefer the other bunch
Like we got for lunch, chocolate fudge butter crunch
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
He don't mess with the Ritz Bits
Wheat Thins, Saltines or Triscuits
Matzos or Cheez-Its
Catch sugar fits every time that he sees
Chips Ahoy, double chocolate chunk
Something with the bubble and the junk in the trunk
Even the Oreos, no matter what weather
Always kept 'em dipped in milk and stuck together
In the game he's shameless
Even uses a code name: Famous Amos
It's cheaper than a short stay at the Days Inn
And good like 25 cent oatmeal raisin
Give a hand to who invented the camera
Skip past the graham, animal and Grandma’s
Shh, make sure she don't wake from her dream chill
Or get caught with a handful of cream fill

""Oh, honey! What are you doing? That's so nasty!""
It might seem ill
""Ew! Go wash your hands!"" (No)
Kookies
""Get out of here!""
[Outro: Samples]
""DOOM is master of the world.""
""I'd sure hate to see that ugly mug of yours in my history book.""
""You've disturbed me for the last time.""
(Voice 1): Hey, y'know something gang, that DOOM ain't really all bad
(Voice 2): What do you mean, Ben?
(Voice 1): Well, on account of him I had me a real good time. Y'know, I mean, between you and me I kinda like being black
(Voice 3): Well, maybe if we're lucky he'll attack us once more and send you back, Benjamin
(Voice 1): Ah-haha very funny, very very funny
(Voice 2): He must be mad
(Voice 4): Well, if anyone can do it. Nevertheless let's get out of here, while we can

So you've got so many diamonds
You wear all the finest clothes
And your grill is shining
As you're driving down the streets of gold
But you can't blame me
If I set this stage on fire
Ha!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Momma always told me I was crazy
And my hoes say I'm amazing, but I don't listen to a lady
But the bitch say I'm hot, and I say ""No bitch, I'm blazing""
Like, what the fuck you expect? I'm a motherfucking Cajun
I feel caged in my mind, it's like my flow doing time
I goes crazy inside, but when it comes out—it's fine
Like wine; wait, watch...
See? I get better with time like a watch
Osh B'Gosh, Posh Spice husband
Couldn't kick it like I kick it, bitch! I Kix it
No cereal, like a landing, I sticks it
Wherever she asks me, after she licks it
""That's too explicit""; well, why you listening?
*Sniff* I smell smoke, and something's sizzling
That's her pussy
So, hey, pussy; play with pussy or play pussy
[Chorus: Betty Wright & Lil Wayne]
But you can't blame me
If I set this stage on fire
Hahahaha!

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
They say, ""You're nobody 'til somebody kills you
Well, where I'm from, you're nobody 'til you kill somebody
And you know what they say; when you great
It's not ""murder,"" it's ""assassinate""
So assassinate me, bitch
'Cause I'm doing the same shit Martin Luther King did
Checking in the same hotel, in the same suite, bitch
Same balcony, like, ""Assassinate me, bitch!""
It's Lil Tunechi
I don't rap, I film movies
With my rap, you could call me
""Mr. Director's Chair,"" yeah, and that's a wrap
Cut! On to the next...
Not the next scene, bitch, the next check
Some say the X makes the sex 'spec-
So play with the pussy or play pussy

[Chorus: Betty Wright & Lil Wayne]
So you've got so many diamonds
Hey, pussy, lay pussy
You wear all the finest clothes
Do what I... say, pussy, and I say, I say
And your grill is shining
Lay pussy, lay pussy, lay, pussy, haha
As you're driving down the streets of gold
Hey, pussy, haha!
But you can't blame me
Hey pussy, don't play pussy
If I set this stage on fire!
Get 'em!
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Straight off the corner of Apple and Eagle
Braveheart, bitch, like the times are medieval
Married to the game, divorced the cathedral
Standing on the corner selling porcelain to people
Forced into evil, it's all in your head
It's all so cerebral, call me Knievel
You follow and I lead you, straight to the needles
The bottles, the battles, the beetles'll eat you
Momma named Cita—I love you, Cita
'Member when your pussy second husband tried to beat ya?
'Member when I went into the kitchen, got the cleaver?
He ain't give a fuck, I ain't give a fuck neither
He could see the devil, see the devil in my features
He could smell the ether, you can see Cita
You can see the Cita, see the Cita in my features
And she don't play neither

When it come to these bitches, I'm still a backbreaker
Let the vocals get the pussy, let the track rape her
Tires on the rims skinny but they fat paper
Like I'm fresh out, bitch it's time to stack paper
Port of Miami, my Chevy still candy
My chopper still fully, I empty it gladly
Never Hollywood even though I got it good
I ain't gotta goon, but fuck it somebody gotta do it

Got a broad in Baltimore who movin' all the raw

When that chopper clap it drop like a Dre beat
Stray dog ass bitches wanna give me rabies

Them boys fire hazards when they got them choppers on 'em
Fuck crime stopper, better call em helicopters on 'em

Who ever knew I would afford cologne by Tom Ford
Trips to Hawaii with Diddy on Concordes
Quarter milli in the Louis, bitch pretty as Apollonia
I got a funny feelin' fuckin' Feds watchin' me
At this point only the goverment could stop me

Mama loved me, pop left me
Mickey fed me, Annie dressed me
Eric fought me, made me tougher
Love you for that, my nigga, no matter what, bruh
Marcy raised me, and whether right or wrong
Streets gave me all I write in this song
Hootie babysitted, changed my diapers
Gil introduced me to the game that changed my life up
East Trenton grew me, had me skipping school
Valencia's boyfriend Volvo had me making moves
Mama raised me, pop, I miss you
God, help me forgive him, I got some issues
Mickey cleaned my ears, Annie shampooed my hair
Eric was fly, shit, I used to steal his gear
I was the baby boy, I could do no wrong
Years going past fast, let's move along
Kitchen table, that's where I honed my skills
Jaz made me believe this shit was real
Labels turned me down, couldn't foresee
Clark sought me out, Dame believed
Primo laced me, Ski did too
Reasonable Doubt, classic, shoulda went triple
Mama loved me, pop left me
Grandma dressed me, plus, she fed me
Banana pudding was in the hood then
Puffing on L's, drinking pink Champale
Ty rolled with a nigga, V.A. spot
Tone, Mike 'Zo and them niggas, V.A.'s locked
Biggs fucked with a nigga, what's up, Hoff?
Bee-High hated the fact I put rap to the back
Money pouring in, clientele growing now
Birth of my first nephew, time to slow it down
October 21st, Lavelle came to the world
Followed by three more boys and then a baby girl
Mama loved me, Ti-Ti, Uncle Jay
Loves you to death, won't let no trouble come your way
Oh, can't forget my man down in Maryland
He's gone 'til November, how can I not remember?
Tell your moms I'm there for her and Tiembra
And your son, too, it's nothing I won't do
Unless you was me, how could you judge me?
I was brought up in pain, y'all can't touch me
Police pursued me, chased, cuffed, and subdued me
Talked to me rudely 'cause I'm young, rich, and I'm Black and living a movie, not living by rules
New rap patrolling the city, follow my crews
Bleek, you're still with me, nigga, what did I say?
Your time is coming, you one hit away
Beans, I ain't tryna change you, just give you some game
To make the transition from the street to the fame

So let's go let's get let's get it hey
I know you need something different trying to get away
I use that as a segue
Let's hit a spot where they only speak Reggae
Like no one can do it this long
She said ""Aye Kan', who you tryin' to be, Akon?""
Sorry the drink had me wildin' a little bit
But my link had me stylin' a little bit
I think I'm gonna hit the island in a bit
But what I said had you smiling didn't it
She laughed at this, but after this
You know I gotta take that off
Young Halle told me, ""Make me feel good""
So I gave her the Monster Balls

Yeah and you should let them boys know too
Show them niggas every single thing I showed you
I'm here feeling like 50 back in ’02, and everybody sayin' I'm the man, so true
Yeah but what does it take to feel secure?
A place with wooden floors and space to put awards
A couple of parking spots and maids to do the chores
The cars you always wanted, the women that you adore
Well I got it, I got it
I wonder if I'd be happy without it, I doubt it
I try not to really think about it
I made it but I'm still playin' like I'm bein' scouted 'til I'm out it

This OG got my whole suite cloudin' up
And I bet you I be out of time before I'm out of luck

Uhh, please make your long story shorter
Cause time is of the essence for the king of first quarter
Numbers do the talkin' I have nothing for reporters
I just hope we make these flights and don’t get held up at the border
Yeah, so you can spare me all the accolades
I'm the reason you can find my city on an atlas page
Half a million dollars later and my taxes paid
And I'm still spendin' money from my actin' days
Damn, life is such a lovely thing
Feel the perks that a 7 figure budget bring
Tell your girlfriend that I can pull some fuckin' strings
So we're courtside when LeBron get a fuckin' ring
Yeah, I bet I be there I be there
You see that ’62 sittin outside? That's me there
I'm jumpin to the top its my leap year, prepare
Putting in that overtime I never said it'd be fair
I'm always left wishin' I could have done it in person
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin'
I got new girls but none of they love is for certain
And call old girls but none of they numbers are workin'
Damn, what happened to us?
Life can always change, you have to adjust
How come when I got a party you stare at me in disgust?
They pay us just to have fun you should see that as a plus
Especially when I come flyin' through the door
And kindly ignore, the paparazzi outside tryin' to record
Why has every woman never dined here before?
Am I the only 23 year old wine connoisseur?
The Rothschilds, the Cru's, the Gajas and the Opuses
It's always nice when you're out with someone that notices
My condo got that art gallery openness
I'm just really hopin' that that isn’t what your motive is

The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain, my fifteen seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
Roc-A-Fella's only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here
They say he bougie, he big-headed
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is

I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas

Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
That'll take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwa-li or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with JAY-Z
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye
I'm almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant, can y'all blame him?
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
Last year shoppin' my demo, I was tryin' to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga
I'm Kon, the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
""Oh my god, is that a black card?""
I turned around and replied, ""Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express""

[Outro]
So this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop Picked the ""Truth"" beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like ""Who that spittin'?"" I'm like ""It's me."" He's like ""Oh, well okay.""
Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth
Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, 'cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with

So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?

And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, ""Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap""

No ID: ""Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap""

[Saxophone Solo]

I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer

[Hiphop: ""I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper""]

I'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that ""Truth"" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then
I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, ""Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off ""Xxplosive"" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on ""This Can't Be Life.""

And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop 'cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' 'cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, ""Oh you a real soulful dude.""

[JAY-Z: ""Oh you a real soulful dude, man""]

And he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said

[JAY-Z: ""Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here""]

""Tell me what you think of this."" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, ""What you think of it?""

[JAY-Z: ""So what you think of this?""]

And I was like, ""Man that shit tight,"" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...

[Donda West: ""Come on, let's just go""]

...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...

[Donda West: ""Kanye, baby, we're here""]

...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, ""Heart of the City."" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did ""Nothing Like It"" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, ""Yo play that one beat for him."" And I played ""Heart of the City."" And really I made ""Heart of the City,"" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX

[Hiphop: ""No I think Jay gon' like this one right here""]

And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, ""Yo what's up I'm Kanye.""

[Dame: ""Yo, you that kid, Kanye?""]

""You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats""

[Dame: ""Jay got classics, G.""]

You know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like ""oh shit."" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, ""yo Jay I could rap."" And I spit this rap that said, uh ""I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips."" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, ""Man that was tight.""

[JAY-Z: ""That, that was cool. That was hot.""]

That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, ""H to the Izzo,"" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. ""Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z."" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, ""yo but I rap too."" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them ""Jesus Walks"" and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, ""Naw."" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...

[Jessica: ""Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.""]

I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up

[""Y'all niggas is stupid""]

Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad

[Joe: ""We gonna change the game, buddy.""]

Dame was like, ""Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.""

[Dame: ""You gotta make sure it's not wack.""]

Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'

""I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
I got 11 plaques on my walls right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.""

Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like ""oh shit""

[Dame: ""Oh shit it's not even wack.""]

""I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.""

[Dame: ""it's actually kinda hot.""]

Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like ""yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick""

[Dame: ""you don't wanna catch a brick""]

""You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on."" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, ""oh, word?"" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, ""oh he's just a producer-rapper,"" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, ""yo... Capitol pulled on the deal""

[Mel: ""Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.""]

And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, ""man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?""

So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?"

Ego Remix,Beyonc,['pop'],"[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I got a big ego (Ha ha ha), I’m such a big ego (Uh-uh-uh)
I got a big, (eh-eh-eh), ego, she love my big, (eh-eh-eh), ego
So stroke my big, (eh-eh-eh), ego
I like to joke around a little bit, but here we go
Welcome to the wonderful world of gold-plated Earl, 'cause
Every thing I throw up, blow up
Talking to the girl She said, ""Know what, grow up, you nasty,""
""I don’t understand why they trippin’, if you ask me""
Flow is just the nicest, I emit the propane
I just spit, probably just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club try and get as fresh as me
What you want, dawg? Tryna stay recession free
And spit, refreshingly when I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty you should bring a extra tee
Now I’m standing next to Jay who standing next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you’re here with me
That’s good for my ego, me and my ego
And it go wherever we go my ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league, one day I play Kobe
I walk up to Puff and he already know me
Coulda let the dream killers kill my self esteem
Or use the arrogance as a steam that power my dreams
And my ego
[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
It's on baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call into work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why? Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it, I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets, you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this cause he can back it up

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
Usually I'm humble, right now I don't choose
You can leave with me or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident
You decide when you find on what I'm working with
Damn I know I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet them thighs
Matter a fact it's my smile or maybe my eyes
Boy you a sight to see, kind of something like me
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
I talk like this cause I can back it up
I got a big ego, such a huge ego
But he loves my big ego, it's too much
I walk like this cause I can back it up

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I, I walk like this cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this cause I can back it up
I, I can back it up, I can back it up
I walk like this cause I can back it up

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this cause he can back it up

[Outro: Beyoncé]
Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, if you ain't know
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano...
Whoa...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Magnificent,Rick Ross,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Rick Ross]
Baby, you a true thoroughbred, a born winner
I expect you to be magnificent
It's the boss
It gets no better than this (Maybach Music)

[Chorus: John Legend]
Swimmin' in women, champagne sippin'
Gold emblem with, two M's in it (ha-hah)
This pimpin' is so magnificent
Stop dreamin' it, I'm livin' it!
Oh I, I can show you
Oh I, show you better than I can tell you (ooh-whoa-ooh-whoa)
Oh I, I-I can show you
Oh I, oh I, oh I

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I'm the Magnificent with a sensational style
Far from bein' shallow 'cause she caught me with a smile
Try to figure out my style, baby that'll take a minute
But if all we got is time, you can't be actin' timid
So we back to playin' tennis, meanin' goin' back and forth
She the one that I adore, so I tried to enter raw
Conscience intervenes, concentratin' on my cream
I'm the king, make a move, pawns all the way to Queens
I'm a don, I'm a boss, I'm a profit, I'm a G
I'm a CEO, which means that I profit off of me
All white tees, still rockin' my Nike Airs
Fresh outta flight school, 'cause I'm fly right here
Ain't nothin' free, I'm chargin' to breathe air
If it's not on Maybach, really who the hell cares?
My money long, my nigga, my money strong
If you ain't gettin' money that mean you done somethin' wrong
Boss!
[Chorus: John Legend]
Swimmin' in women, champagne sippin'
Gold emblem with, two M's in it (ha-hah)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm the Magnificent with a sensational style
Down to all of my automobiles, with no miles
Yellow Corvettes, black rally stripes
And I never phone ahead, all she do is hear the pipes
Project bitches, upscale kittens
Fuck her for a minute, that night we countin' digits
Maybach money so I always had a vision
I would always tell my niggas but, ain't nobody listened
Words work magic, haters wreak havoc
Ain't nothin' on my back but the delicates of fabrics
I made a transition from the thieves
To the biggest executive Def Jam's ever seen
Lyor's dream, Sean John suit
And a S. Dot ring, Chandon for my crew
Bad hoes in pursuit, Masspike on a two
Gunplay he a glue, goon with an attitude, holla
[Chorus: John Legend]
Swimmin' in women, champagne sippin'
Gold emblem with, two M's in it (ha-hah)

Stop dreamin' it, I'm livin' it!

Oh I, I-I can show you
Oh I, oh I, oh I

I'm the Magnificent with a sensational style
When I decorate a home, marble flowin' like the Nile
Nigga you a clown, here's the number you should dial
Yeah it start with 305, but we end at four pound
""Sak pase"" to Zoe Pound, for lifers in O-Town
All them Carol City killers, they're likin' it broke down
Money is a must, Tommy guns on a bus
Allan Zamren on the case so you know what you could suck
Wear red all the time, but really I'm color blind
Wanna catch my attention, nigga? Throw up a dollar sign
One time for the Crips, young G's buyin' cribs
And I smoke with Vice Lords when I visit Mississip'
The game never change, money still a focal
But it's time to rape the game, like Puffy did Total
Like Rev Run in the tub, still smokin'
In memory of Shakir, Boss gotta shout Oakland
[Chorus: John Legend]
Swimmin' in women, champagne sippin'
Gold emblem with, two M's in it (ha-hah)
This pimpin' is so magnificent
Stop dreamin' it, I'm livin' it!

I murder a rhyme, one word at a time
You never heard of a mind as perverted as mine
You better get rid of that 9, it ain't gonna help
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?
I'm waitin' for Hell, like hell, shit, I'm anxious as hell
Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen, I was puttin' shells in a gauge on a shelf
I used to get punked and bullied on my block
'Til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
(Hey Ma', Ma'!)
I used to give a fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much press
I'm stressed, too much cess, depressed, too upset
It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick (Yes)
Grew up quick (No), was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say's right
You think of my name now whenever you say, ""Hi""
Became a commodity 'cause I'm W-H-I-
T-E, ‘cause MTV was so friendly
To me, can't wait 'til Kim sees me
Now, is it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect?
Read my lips, bitch! What, my mouth isn't workin'?
You hear this finger? Oh, it's upside down
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now

I take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
Just to see if he's influenced by me, if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit, he's an innocent victim
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
(*Scratches*) My name is Slim Shady
I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational (*scratch*) ""Back is the incredible!""
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the Internet
Tryin' to lure your kids with him into bed
It's a sick world we live in these days
""Slim, for Pete's sakes, put down Christopher Reeve's legs!""
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
""Slim, it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it""
Mind with no sense in it, fried schizophrenic
Whose eyes get so squinted, I'm blind from smoke in 'em
With my windows tinted
With nine limos rented, doin' lines of coke in 'em
With a bunch of guys hoppin' out, all high and indo-scented
And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me—

I take seven {kids} from {Columbine}, stand 'em all in line
Add an AK-47, a revolver, a 9
A MAC-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
And that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time
‘Cause I'm Shady, they call me as crazy
As the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, NSYNC, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
‘Cause all these fans screamin' is makin' my ears ring (Ahh!)
So I just throw up a middle finger and let it linger
Longer than the rumor that I was stickin' it to Christina
‘Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez and Puffy, you know this
I'm sorry, Puff, but I don't give a fuck
If this chick was my own mother, I'd still fuck her with no rubber
And cum inside her and have a son and a new brother
At the same time and just say that it ain't mine—what's my name?
[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)

I'm gonna make it anyway
Gonna make it, can't give up now

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I just feel like quittin', I still might
Why do I put up this fight? Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin' ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin' a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
And I clam up, I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
Just been stripped, I have just been 'vict'd
So I must then get off the bus then split
Man, fuck this shit, yo, I'm goin' the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road

I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan

Time for me to just stand up and travel new land

I'm walkin' these train tracks, tryna regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, in the same pants
Tryna chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, Momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset, ‘cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much, man, I'm just tryna do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo, I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please, I'm beggin' you, God
Please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job
Yo, I hope you can hear me, homie, wherever you are
Yo, I'm tellin' you, dawg, I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me, baby, I'm never too far
But yo, I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go back to this 8 Mile Road

I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
(It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land

Time for me to just take matters into my own hands

[Verse 3]
You gotta live it to feel it; you didn't, you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
To be walkin' this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
Of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen, heard, smelled or met a real MC
Who's incredible or on the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin' a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go?
Who must I show to bust my flow?
Where must I go? Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket?
‘Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little rabbit's foot, fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin' to doubt shit
I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo, my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army, tryna salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryna travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battlin' mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one, this city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
What I'm doin', I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo, it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin', no, next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these Free World leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road
[Chorus]
I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
(It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back
(I'ma make it somehow)
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'
(It's alright, it's okay)
Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
(I'ma make it somehow)"
Nail in the Coffin,Eminem,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
This motherfucker, man! Just won't shut up, will you?
Talking 'bout I owe him
Bitch, you owe me! I'm promotin' you right now
Yo, let's put the nail in this coffin!

[Hook]
I don't wanna be like this
I don't really wanna hurt no feelings
But I'm only being real when I say
Nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap (Nope)
And old men have heart attacks
And I don't wanna be responsible for that
So, put the mic down and walk away
You can still have a little bit of dignity

[Verse]
I would never claim to be no Ray Benzino
An eighty-three-year-old fake Pacino
So how can he hold me over some balcony without
Blowin' his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me? (Ugh!)
Please don't—you'll probably fall with me
And our asses'll both be history (Aah!)
But then again, you'd finally get your wish
‘Cause you'd be all over the street, like 50 Cent (Hahahaha)
You fuckin' punk! Pussy, fuck you, chump!
Give me a one-on-one, see if I don't fuck you up
Tryna jump the Ruff Ryders and they cut you up
And you put Jada on a track, that's how much you suck
Dick in the industry, swear that you in the streets hustlin'
You sit behind a fuckin' desk at The Source butt-kissin'
And beggin' motherfuckers for guest appearances
And you can't even get the clearances
'Cause real lyricists don't even respect you or take you serious
It's not that we don't like you—we hate you, period
Talk about a mid-life crisis, damn
Last week you was shakin' Obie Trice's hand
Now he's a buster? What the fuck's with that?
Get on a track dissin' us, kissin' 50's ass
And askin' me what I know about indictments, bite me!
Bitch, I got two cases and probation—fight me!
What do I know about standin' in front of a judge like a man
Ready to take whatever sentence he hands?
What you know about your wife slicin' her wrists, right in
Front of the only thing that you have in this world- a little girl?
And I put that on her, when this is all over
I would never try to make her a star and eat off her
I don't know shit about no choppin' rocks
But what you know about Hip Hop Shops rockin' spots
Where you're the only white boy up in that bitch, just rippin'?
Pressin' up your own fliers and your stickers, stickin'
Them bitches up after spendin' six hours at Kinko's
Makin' copies of your covers of cassette singles
To sell them out of the trunk of your Tracer
Spendin' your whole paychecks at Disc Makers
What you know about being bullied over half your life?
Oh, that's right, you should know what that's like, you're half white (Haha)
Vanilla Ice, spill the beans and rice
I'm eatin' you alive inside, Jesus Christ!
If you're that much of a gangsta, put the mic down!
You should be out killin' motherfuckers right now
Kill a motherfucker dead, kill him dead, bitch!
Shoot 'em in the fuckin' head—go ahead, bitch!
Slap my mom! Slap the fuck out of her!
She can't sue you, she wouldn't get a buck out of ya
‘Cause you're broke as fuck, you suck, you're a fuckin' joke
If you was really sellin' coke, well, then what the fuck
You stop for, dummy? If you slew some crack
You'd make a lot more money than you do from rap (Haha)
You'll never have no security, you'll never be famous
You'll never know what it's like to be rich, life's a bitch, ain't it?
Raymond? Here, let me break this shit down in layman's terms for you
Just to make sure that you can understand us
And Canibus ain't using too many complicated fuckin' words for you
Here, and let me slow it down for you
So that you can understand if I say it slower
Let it go, dog, it's over

I don't wanna be like this
I don't really wanna hurt no feelings

Haha… talkin' 'bout... I have motherfuckers... callin' your crib
Bitch, you ain't even got a fuckin' crib!
You ain't even got a fuckin' phone… fuckin' bum!
Threatenin' to... shut me down at your lil' fuckin' Source magazine if I come back on you and attack you
Bitch, you attacked me first!
Take it like a man, and shut the fuck up!
And fuck your little magazine too
I don't need your little fuckin' magazine
I got XXL's number anyways
And y'all can't stand it, ‘cause they gettin' bigger than y'all
Oh... and by the way... how'd I look on the VMA's?
When you was watchin' me from...
Whatever fuckin' TV you was watchin' me from
In Boston… the mean streets of Boston
Fuckin' sissy! And you got us scared up in here, motherfucker
Suck our motherfuckin' dicks!

Don't get it twisted, y'all... The Source has a white owner!"
Billionaire,Travie McCoy,['pop'],"[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shiny lights, yeah
A different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes, like, here, lady, have this
And last but not least, grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the ho-ho
Aha, get it?
I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go, I'ma have my own theme music
[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Travie McCoy]
Oh, every time I close my eyes (What you see, what you see, bruh?)
I see my name in shiny lights (Uh-ha, uh-ha, yeah, what else?)
Oh, yeah, yeah, a different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare (For what?) for when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh, when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Let's go)

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
I be playing basketball with the president
Dunking on his delegates
Then I compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli' in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twennies, tens, and bens completely separate
And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me
Would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket, pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars & Travie McCoy]
I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad (So bad)
Buy all of the things I never had (Buy everything, ha-ha)
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen (What up, Oprah? Ha-ha)
[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Travie McCoy]
Oh, every time I close my eyes (What you see, what you see, bruh?)
I see my name in shiny lights (Uh-ha, uh-ha, yeah, what else?)
Oh, yeah, yeah, a different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare (For what?) for when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Sing it) when I'm a billionaire

Queens Get the Money,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Jay Electronica]

[Verse]
Ayo, Queens get the money, niggas still screaming, paper-chasing
Where presidential candidates is planning wars with other nations
Over steak with Masons
Pregnant teens give birth to intelligent gangsters
They daddies faceless
Play this, by your stomach, let my words massage it and rub it
I'll be his daddy if there's nobody there to love it
Tell him his name Nasir, tell him how he got here
Mama was just having fun with someone above her years
Niggas is still hating
Talking that Nas done fell off with rhyming
He'd rather floss with diamonds
They pray ""Please God, let him spit that 'Uzi in the army lining'
That 'shorty doo-wop rolling oo-wops in the park reclining'""
Take 27 emcees, put 'em in a line and they're out of alignment
My assignment since he said retirement
Hiding behind 8 Mile and The Chronic
Gets rich but dies rhyming
This is high science
Now add 23 more from Queens to B-more
I'm over their heads like a bulimic on a seesaw
Now that's 50 porch monkeys ate up at the same time
Nasty Nasdaq, y'all gon' bow holmes, this Dow Jones
.80 cal chrome, needed time alone to zone
The mack left his iPhone and his nine at home
My queen used her milkshake to bring y'all to my slaughterhouses
I do this for the group home kids in boarding houses
This that ""nigga"" shit that's on the album
For them niggas inside the chalk line in 40 houses
Bring back Arsenio
Hip-hop was aborted so Nas breathes life, back into the embryo
Let us make man in our image, spit it
I'm Huey P in Louis V
At the eulogy throwing Molotovs for Emmett
And you ain't as hot as I is
All of these false prophets is not messiahs
You don't know how high the sky is
The square mileage of Earth or what pi is
I'm the shaky hand that touched George Foreman in Zaire
The same hand that punched down devils
That brought down the Towers"
Real,Lupe Fiasco,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Food & Liquor

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, my man said he wanted something real
Real, real, real, real
Something he could recognize, something he could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
Baby girl said she was in the mood for something real
Real, real, real, real (FNF)
Something that could make her move, something she could feel
Feel, feel, feel

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Lust, sometimes can override trust
She said that's why she gave it up
My man said blood spilled out of everything he touched
He crushed everything, he crushed
Ruined everything he loved, he just wanted the rush
Blamed it on the times being rough
Doing dirt with the devil, chasing after the dust
Make a fuss if it's them, but we hush if it's us
[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
That's why, my momma said she wanted something real
Real, real, real, real
Something she could be proud of, something she could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
She said they so used to not having nothin' real
Real, real, real, real
That they don't know how to act, they don't know how to feel
Feel, feel, feel

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Life, ain't meant to come around twice
Yeah, that's why I gotta get it right
They said I got it honest, now I gotta give it light
But sleep on it, that's why God give you night
I mean, I had a dream that God gave me flight
Too fly for my own good, so God gave me plight
If I wake up in the morning now I gotta give 'em sight
Make 'em see, break 'em free, ain't a G, show you right

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco & Sarah Green]
The game is not to give 'em nothing real
Real, real, real, real
Nothing that they could use, nothing that they could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
Give 'em a bunch of lies and teach 'em that it's real
Real, real, real, real
So that's all they'll know, that's all that they'll feel
Feel, feel, feel
[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Struggle, another sign that God love you
'Cause on the low, being poor make you humble
Keep they names in my rhymes to try and keep 'em out of trouble
'Cause being poor also teach you how to hustle
All they want is some shoes or some rims for they bubble
Now that I got my own I can hit 'em with a couple
Cuff my homies so they ain't got no reason to cuff you
That's my plan, if I can on the man up above you

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco & Sarah Green]
That's why, I gotta give 'em something real
Real, real, real, real
Something they could recognize, something they could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
To my homies on the block I gotta give 'em something real
Real, real, real, real
Something that'll make 'em stop, something they can feel
Feel, feel, feel

[Outro: Lupe Fiasco & Sarah Green]
Yo! FNF are real; really real, yea
You know what it is, woo
Baby girl said she was in the mood for something real
Real, real, real, real

So real, so real, so real"

Geah.. whassup?
To all my street niggas, project niggas
Real niggas, worldwide
Let's reflect, everybody got a story
We all ghetto B, here's mine
Geah

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
See I was, born in sewage, born to make bomb music
Flow tight like I was born Jewish
Used the streets as a conduit
I kept arms .38 longs inside my mom's Buick
At any given moment Shawn could lose it, be on the news
Iron cuffs - arms through it, or stuffed with embalming fluid
Shit, I'm going through it - mom dukes too
Tears streaming down her pretty face, she got her palms to it
My life is getting too wild
I need to bring some sort calm to it
Bout to lose it voices screaming ""Don't do it!""
It's like '93, '94, 'bout the year
That Big and Mack dropped and Illmatic rocked
Outta every rag drop, and the West had it locked
Everybody doing them, I'm still stretching on the block
Like ""Damn, I'ma be a failure""
Surrounded by thugs, drugs, and drug paraphernalia
Cops, courts, and their thoughts is to derail us
Three-time felons in shorts with jealous thoughts
Trying to figure where your mail is
Guesstimate the weight you selling
So they can send shots straight to your melon; wait!
It gets worse, baby momma water burst
Baby came out stillborn, still I gotta move on
Though my heart still torn, life gone from her womb
Don't worry, if it was meant to be, it'll be soon
[Chorus: Jay-Z]
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
Chill dog
Second oldest born, from Michelle Brown my mother
Hell bound, grew with two sisters and one brother
Pop wasn't around, so many stories that's another
I'm thinking damn; how my older sister going make me tougher
When steel sharpens steel, I'ma keep it real
I'm tired of trying to hide my pain behind the syrups and pills
Dead to the world, stretched out like a corpse for real
Y'all niggas thinking what y'all reading in The Source is real
What my life like, you looking at the source, it's real
What your life like? Mine dog, of course it's real
Passing judgment, you niggas second-guessing Beans
'Cause you don't eat swine don't make you Mu'min
Dog you know a couple suras, out the Qur'an
I guess you all on your din and I ain't on mine
Stop that Akki, 'fore I send shots though your body
Make 'em feel hell on earth before Allah drop me
I feel the line's drawn here, nutting more can stop me
'Til them feds pick me up, or them boys pop me
There's only three things that make Mack not act like Beans
Amatullah Tisha, Po Aldin, Samir Amin
My seeds dog, gotta teach 'em that before I leave, dog
Shit I know that I'ma see 'em when I leave, dog
I come back in the afterlife
Like fuck it, I done touched hell twice; what's the meaning?

This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us

[Verse 3: Scarface]
Life.. yeah.. uhh..
Now as I walk into the studio to do this with Jig'
I got a phone call from one of my nigs
Said my homeboy Reek, he just lost one of his kids
And when I heard that I just broke into tears
And see in the second hand; you don't really know how this is
But when it hits that close to home you feel the pain at the crib
So I called mine, and saddened my wife with the bad news
Now we both depressed, counting our blessings 'cause Brad's two
Praying for young souls to laugh at life through the stars
Loving your kids just like you was ours
And I'm hurting for you dog; but ain't nobody pain is like yours
I just know that heaven'll open these doors
And ain't no bright side to losing life; but you can view it like this
God's got open hands homie, he in the midst.. of good company
Who loves all and hates not one
And one day you gon' be with your son
I could've rapped about my hard times on this song
But heaven knows I woulda been wrong
I wouldn'ta been right, it wouldn'ta been love
It wouldn'ta been life, it wouldn'ta been us
This can't be life
[Chorus: Jay-Z]
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us

You 'bout to witness hip-hop in its most purest
Most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest known artist
Chip off the old block, but old Doc is (back)
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Vrinn, vrinn! Yeah, here I come, I'm inches
Away from you, dear, fear none
Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1, so

When I'm gone, time to get rid of these rap criminals
So skip to your lou while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you're used to it
Flow's too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit
The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
In eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up, there's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People, when you're rappin' and you know what for

To Marshall and Andre's carnival, c'mon!

It's just like old times, the Dynamic Duo
Two old friends, why panic? You already know
Who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton played career Russian Roulette
And never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so Levy?
Turn on these beats, MCs don't see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog, fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear
Into the mountains, nothin' but clowns down here

Now let's get down to business

Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down

Back with his friend Andre
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because (Marshall!) and Andre are here to stay
And never go away
Until our dying day
Until we're old and grey (Marshall!)
So until next time, friends
Same blonde hair, same rap channel
Good night, everyone!
Thank you for coming! Your host for the evening (Marshall!)

While emcees were burning ism I earned degrees in journalism
Learning the system and about how freedom of speech is worth killing for
But watch what you say in all those interviews
You're in limbo? Well, we're in limbo too
Contact the dead to get advice from Ann Landers
Transmit personal problems like head lice in bandanas
The big man on campus has delusions of grandeur
Doing a thesis on ebonics, unconsciously using poor grammar
Your mannerisms are suitable to cancer victims
How much opposition does it take for your stance or position
To dance to this rhythm? (you're jignorant, baby)
Dance to this rhythm (go ahead, baby)
Ah, forget it; it's actually accepted for rappers to have no ethics
Their albums would benefit if they put in half the effort

While you put out another ""fuck you, faggot"" record

I blame my hate mail on typographical errors, correct the misspellings
And then send out ""thank you"" notes for the love letters
Accept rejection when I get a return to sender
Reject acceptance when the girl's got an agenda
I've entered this brave new world of true cowards
Talking about, ""no one goes to shows no more, they're too crowded""
So they stay home and burn shit, then they say
""I downloaded your life off the net, totally worth it""
It's 2000, time to stop acting like assholes
It ain't about backpackers or cash flow
Fashionable afros, salon-style dreads or frat clothes
And it ain't about these fucking loud mouths shouting ""battle!""
African medallions didn't sell platinum albums
That's part of the reason why you think hip-hop died
It was here before you were. It'll be here in the future
Life's not a bitch, she's just sick of being personified

That Ain't Right [hook]

This household is filled with the half-deads
They've got a mouthful of pills because they're crack heads
They shout that I'm ill, but they're doubtful of skill
With the type of stabbing that turns my back red
I don't blast lead, I write until my pen explodes
All over fashion dreads and your Ecko clothes
I don't listen when they say ""shit ain't ever gonna change""
And they say I ain't got no soul"

3rd World motherfucker (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
I’m from where the gold and diamonds are ripped from the earth
Right next to the slave castles where the water is cursed
From where police brutality is not half as nice
It makes the hood in America look like paradise
Compared to the AIDS-infested Caribbean slum
African streets where the passport's an American gun
From where they massacre people and try to keep it quiet
And spend the next 25 years tryin' to deny it
I’m from where they cut your hands off if you make a fist
And niggas grow coca, 'cause the job market doesn’t exist
Except slave labor, modern-day company store
And peacekeepers don’t ever ever ever come here no more
From where the bombs that they used to drop on Vietnam
Still has children born deformed, eight months before they gone
I’m from where they lost the true meaning of the Quran
'Cause heroin is not compatible with Islam
And niggas know that but grow that poppy seed anyway
'Cause that food-drop parachute does not come every day
I’m from where people pray to the gods of their conquerors
And practically every president's a money launderer
From where the only place democracy's acceptable
Is if America's candidate is electable
And they might even have a black president, but he’s useless
'Cause he does not control the economy, stupid!
[Hook]
Lock and load your gun where I'm from, the Third World, son
Been to many places, but I’m Third World born
Guerrillas hit and run where I'm from, the Third World, son
You polluted everything and now the Third World’s gone
The water is poison where I'm from, the Third World, son
700 children died by the end of this song
Revolution'll come where I'm from, the Third World, son
Constant occupation leaves the Third World torn

[Verse 2]
I’m from where the Catholic Church is some racist shit
They helped Europe and America rape this bitch
They pray to white Spanish Jesus, whose face is this?
But never talk about the black pope Gelasius
I’m from where Soviet weapons still decide elections
Military's like the Mafia: you pay for protection
Catamite sex tours is what the country sells
And rich white businessmen make the best clientèle
I’m from where they too pussy to come film Survivor
And they murder Coca-Cola union organisers
I’m from where the justice system está podrido
Fuck government, niggas politic over perico
Rebelde conocido, enterado vivo
Como otro Argentino desaparecido
'Cause RICO laws don’t apply to the CIA
And motherfuckers make sneakers for a quarter a day
I’m from where they overthrow democratic leaders
Not for the people but for the Wall Street Journal readers
From where blacks, indigenous peoples, and Asians
Were once slaves of the Caucasians
And it’s amazin' how they trained them
To be racist against themselves in the place they was raised in
You kept us caged in
Destroyed our culture and said that you civilised us
Raped our women, and when we were born you despised us
Gentrified us, agent provocateur divide us
And crucified every revolutionary messiah
So I'm a start a global riot
That not even your fake anti-Communist dictators can keep quiet
Fuck your charity medicine tryin' to murder me!
The immunisations you gave us were full of mercury
So now I see the Third World like the rap game, soldier
Nationalize the industry and take it over!

Welcome to the Slim Shady Mecca, Rebecca
It's the village in New York, right next to the Tribeca
That's my sector, homosexual dissector
Come again, rewind selector
I said, nice rectum, I had a vasectomy Hector
So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya
Hannibal Lecter in the guy section, I bet ya
I tantalize ya and in less than five seconds I get ya
They say once bitten then twice shy, well lie next to the guy
With nine ecstasy pills and five extra
Boxes of ribbed condoms in quantities, why yes sir
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills from my dresser
That's my kind of vibe, what else should I try, Lester?
Drop-kick the bitch before her second trimester
Perform the home abortion with Dexter, then I guess I'll
Dig her fetus out with a wire hanger, then digest her

How should I begin it and where does it all end?

All my Westside bitches throw it up
Put a balloon inside your pussy, queef, and blow it up
Man, I think that he just fell off the deep end, sure enough
So you better change the station to keep from throwing up
Man, you seen it all before, you're all too familiar with it
There's a penis on the floor and two balls, so you know who did it
You know you with it, girl, don't front, oh no you didn't
I won't rape all the Pussycat Dolls? Nicole, you kiddin'?
I'll pee on Rihanna, see man, I do what I wanna
Spray perfume in the sauna room, crazy-gluin' Madonna
To the La-Z-Boy sofa, fold her in two, then sit on her
Imagine the visual for that, man, who would've thought I
Could ever be such a relentless prick, unleashing his vengeance
But the chick's so old, she looks like she outlived a life sentence
I never meant this rhyme to be so offensive
If you weren't so defensive, it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive

Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quicksand
Here, you need a hand, big man? Grab hold of this branch
With both hands, man, they don't understand, I'm just a sick man
Now everybody's pissed at me
Like it's my fault his name rhymes with so many different words, jeez
So one last time, Mr. Christopher Reeves
Won't you break it down for me and just spit the verse, please?
""Eminem, I'm coming to kill you (inhale)
Always hated you, and I still do
You'll never fill my shoes, my Superman costume (inhale)
Doesn't even fit you, they don't feel you

Knick knack patty whack give a dog a bone
Yo, don't give him nothing but a microphone
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
You said I'm not the E, you wanna make a bet?
Remember this: Lounge, you in the danger zone
I figured you would, now leave me alone
You pick and you wish on a four-leaf clover
To be the E double E over and over
You're intrigued by the way I do my thing
(Do what?) Pick up the mic high and make it swing

[PMD]
I have the capability to rap and chill
Cold wax and tax MCs who tend to act ill
It's like a Dig'em Smack
You smack me and I'll smack you back
I get goosebumps when the bassline thumps
A sucker MC arrives, now it's time for lunch
When I'm cooling on the scene, I notice one thing
I'm not Bounce, so sucker MCs cling
I consider myself better than average
Yo, I rock the mic like a wild beast savage
[Erick Sermon]
I'm in the bottling state, I can't concentrate
I make a move like chess, then I yell ""checkmate""
You know why I get zanier and zanier?
Because of EPMD mania
When I walk through the crowd I can see heads turning
I hear voices saying ""That's Erick Sermon""
Not only from the women, but from the men
You know what? It feels good, my friend

[PMD]
I'm the P double E, the Thrilla of Manila
Better known as the MC cold killer
PMD's goal is to keep the place jumping
And if not we feel we owe you something
It's like lotto, you have to be in it to win it
But if the beat is fresh then Diamond J will spin it
If J spin it, then it has to be def
To make you dance until there's no one left

'Cause you a customer

[Erick Sermon]
Praying like a prey when the fox in action
I smell blood, no time for maxin'
Camouflage in the green, my back is arced
Plus you in trouble 'cause it's after dark
My eyes close like Steve Austin, I got you in the square
I would let you run, nah, that ain't fair
So I clear my visions so I can spot him
Snatch him by the neck and say ""Hmmm I got him""
[PMD]
My neighbor MCs, you're in over your head
My rhymes are hungry plus they haven't been fed
The process of elimination is quite simple
Let you grow like a blackhead and pop you like a pimple
Slice you like lettuce, toss you like a salad
Revoke your MC license if your rhymes are invalid
As we go on, sucker MCs sound wacker
Like a parrot says ""Polly want a cracker""

[Erick Sermon]
It was a rap contest, nothing we couldn't handle
At a house they had the mics on the mantel
Looked at the DJ and said ""May I?""
Lit it up like the Fourth of July
Because I float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
No, I'm the E of EPMD
I have a strong point of view on the way things run
Just shut up and listen and learn my son

[PMD]
Absorb that ass like Bounty, the quicker picker upper
To tell you up front, you're nothing but a sucker
The style we're using, no doubt copastetic
You try to bite and yet sound pathetic
'Cause I'mma rhyme like a tailor, flow like a sailor
As the beat gets stronger, MCs get staler
Not bragging or protagging, surely not fagging
MCs surrender, raise the flags and
Give up the titles 'cause the signs are vital
I keep a voice tuned at a slow and swift idle
And you a customer

[Erick Sermon]
I need a man meal sandwich, yes I need Manwich
I feel good, now it's time to do damage
I feel like battling, you know what I mean?
When I rhyme one time to release the steam
When I grab the mic I get dramatic like an actor
You know why I get over? I'm the master
I do a show, pack it in 'til it's clamming up
Look for the microphone then I jam it up

[PMD]
You said you see me jamming at New York Tech
You got one right fella, you deserve a check
How did you know? You must have been jocking
How would you know the places I be rocking?
Don't follow me fella, every move that I make
I'm hostile now so I'll give you a break
Research upon me but don't go past the limit
Here's my card and on the back is my fan club digits

[Erick Sermon]
There's two things to check out in the words that I'm saying
Plus listen to the guitar playing
The bro is bad, the strings he's plucking
Fire rhyme after rhyme, watch MCs duckin'

[PMD]
MCs, it's the final countdown
You look tired, can you go the round?
If you can, I'll slap your hand and give you credit
And if not, I'll turn around and say ""Forget it""

Relax your mind, let your conscience be free
And get down to the sounds of EPMD
Well you should keep quiet while the MC rap
But if you tired, then go take a nap!
Or stay awake and watch the show I take
Because right now - I'm 'bout to shake and bake
The E-R-I-C-K is my name, I spell
Thanks to the clientele, yo I rock well
I'm not an MC who talkin' all that junk
About who can beat who, soundin' like a punk
I just get down and I go for mine
Say ""check one-two"" and run down the line

[Verse 2: Parrish Smith]
To the average MC I'm known as The Terminator
Funky beat maker, new jack exterminator
Destroying a ploy, well your rhymes are now void
Never sweatin' your girl (Why P?) 'Cause she's a skeezoid
When I'm on the scene I always rock the spot
I grab the steel with the crown on top
In the beginnin', I like to let my rhymes flow
And at twelve, I press cruise control
Sit back and relax, let my rhymes tax
Maintain MC's while the Double-E macks
Always calm under pressure, no need to act ill
Listen when I tell you boy

I be the personal computer information on rap
Like the B-I-Z Markie says, I'll make your toes tap
I format the rhymes, step by step
Make 'em sound def to maintain my rep
Prepared to come off, in case of a diss
Not worried about a thing, 'cause we can do this
I can turn the party out just by standin' still
Make the ladies scream and shout while the brothers act ill
Take total control of your body and soul
Pack a nine in my pants for when it's time to roll

[Verse 4: Parrish Smith]
I'm the P double-E M-D-E-E
And one thing I hate, is a bitin' MC
When I enter the party suckers always form a line
Then they ease their way up, and try to bite my lines
I did thousands of shows, dissed many faces
And deal with new jacks on a one-to-one basis
But every now and then a sucker MC gets courageous
And like an epidemic it becomes contagious
But never the least they all R.I.P
For all those unaware it means Rest In Peace
'Cause M.D. -- stands for Microphone Doctor
And the capital P (capital P) capital M (capital M)
Capital D-E-E's no doubt the chief rocker
Don't like to get ill, but if I have to I kill
So believe me boy

Catch every word I'm sayin', no there's no delayin'
Don't hesitate to motivate the crowd I'm not playin'
Seein' is believin', you catch my drift?
Don't try to adapt because I'm just too swift
(How swift?) I'm so swift and that's an actual fact
I'm like Zorro, I mark a E on your back
I don't swing on no ropes or no iron cords
The only weapon is my rappin' sword

[Verse 6: Parrish Smith]
Intimidate MCs with the tone of my vocal throne
When I'm pushin' on the microphone
'Cause I'm the funky rhyme maker, MC undertaker
The one who likes to max and relax
And when it's time, issue dig-em-smacks
I keep their hands clappin', fingers snappin', feet tappin'
When it's time to roll Uzi patrol is packin'
The PMD, the mic's my only friend
And through the course of the party, I kill again and again
So if you're thinkin' bout battlin' you better come prepared
Come with your shield and your armor geared

Catch a flick at the movies, dance or bowl
What I choose I refuse to slack while I'm back
I take a chance jack, so I must attack
With knick knack paddywack so I won't lack
Oh, my style is def, and as deadly as crack

[Parrish Smith]
While I'm slayin' music's playin', a sucker is delayin'
Battle in the trenches where the funky beat playin'
'Cause with a partner like E Double don't come a dime a dozen
Not kin or blood-related, but you can call us cousins
'Cause as we climb the charts, better known as statistics
Brothers on my jock while I'm kickin' ballistics
Droppin' hits like 'I'm Housin,' 'You Gots To Chill,' and more
The proof is in the pudding (Yo, check the Billboard)
People round town talkin' this and that
Of how we sound like the R, and our music was wack
Dropped the album Strictly Business and you thought we would fold
Thirty days later, the LP went gold
So what you sayin'?
So what you sayin'?
[Erick Sermon]
Now party people it's time for the exquisite
No knock knock who that over there or who is it
It's the E-R-I-C-K, yes, the Boy Wonder
No foulups, no bleeps, no bloops or no blunders
So hot, so you can say I'm blazin'
Or Luther Vandross says, yo I am
""Sooooooo amazing, and I've been waiting""
For a sucker to attack yo me the E-Double
'Cause me and PMD is like the funky fresh couple

[Parrish Smith]
I fight fire with fire, that's why most retired
And when we needed a piss boy, you was hired
'Cause you was mesmerized, for that style that we was bringin'
In an all-out battle, P comes out swingin'
'Cause I'm just the type of brother that's out to get mines
And if the odds against me, I still drop lines
And get mines on time, that's why most resign
Sit in my La-Z-Boy chair, relax my head and recline
Sip a Pepsi or Coke, with a twist of lime
Or crack a forty-oh, and then I go for mine
So what you sayin'?
So what you sayin'?"

[Intro: Raekwon, Nas & Ghostface Killah]
No tricks, no tricks, baby
Yeah, ayy, yo, Rae, check me out, y'all
It's the science (Fly wonderful, yeah, y'all)
Tony Starks and, umm, Lex Diamonds (Tony Starks)
My nigga Nas
Word up
Stay wise
All types of shit, yo, son
Hit these kids mad, couldn't know our story, right?
Show those crabs how to rhyme (Yeah, baby)
Shake a nigga with a few of them joints
It's only like five percent out of a hundred
Do it to 'em, baby

[Verse 1: Nas]
Through the lights, cameras, and action, glamor, glitters, and gold
I unfold the scroll, plant seeds to stampede the globe
When I'm deceased, by then the beast arise like yeast
To conquer peace, leaving savages to roam in the streets
Live on the run, police paying me to give in my gun
Trick my wisdom with the system that imprisoned my son
Smoke a gold leaf, I hold heat nonchalantly
I'm raunchy, but things I do is real, it never haunts me, while
Funny style niggas roll in the pile
Rooster-heads profile on the bus to Rikers Isle
Holding weed inside they pussy with they minds on the pretty things in life
Props is a true thug's wife
It's like a cycle, niggas come home, some'll go in
Do a bullet, come back, do the same shit again
From the womb to the tomb, presume the unpredictable
Guns salute life rapidly, that's the ritual
[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Perhaps bullets bust, niggas discuss mad money
True lies and white guys, we can see it through the eyes
Catch the most on tape, kilos disintegrate
Pyrex pots, we break, fiends licking plates
In the building, niggas building, like little children, staring
Them older niggas ain't caring
Sirens circling, fiends are lurking in your baggage
Oh, one's gone now, what? Smack him in his cabbage
In the woodwork
Crack sales bubble like Woolworths in the projects
Richest niggas rocking all the real worth
Police questioning, rooftop cats invested in
Trading in they Lexuses, GSs, sending messages
Two and two makes four, Cristals crazily pour
Gun wars, my crew feel 'em like swords

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
With the green leathers, hundred-pound snakes and cakes
Fiends found in lakes, jealously jakes we shake
What I strive for is what I live for
Infatuated by material things in this wild life of war
Like somewhere over the rainbow, I see a big pot of gold
Future stacks, so I hold
Thousands of cracks bagged up inside the shoebox
Don't keep jack in my lab, don't wanna see 2Pac
Got two spots on New Lots flooded with rocks
Shootouts making me hot, crooked cops, bag Tony and the ball drop
In denial, I'm banging niggas for slot time
Hurry up, duke, I'm next on line
And what the fuck is you looking at?
By the way young blood hit me off with that Green Bay hat
Watch your back inside the hall, new niggas slide through
Like doors, yo, you're staring in the mess hall
Your adrenaline runs, cigarette niggas be swindling
New jacks surrendering, come home not remembering
Made bail with different size kicks on, a white dress shirt
Looking gay in the yard and you got hurt
Flashbacks of the day room, mop wringer style
Your faggot ass got bashed trying to turn the dial
You told your boo you was wildin'
Once you heard Wu, out of the blue, your family's from Shaolin
High class cooks, throw on vests out of phone books
Infirmary niggas are screaming, ""I got juxed""
Sharpened toothbrushes, one-ninety mixed with baby oil and shit
Your man's in the kitchen stashing ice picks
Well I'ma end this with a big red cherry on top
Me, Nas, and Rae got the best product on the block
[Outro: Raekwon & Ghostface Killah]
Cream, my whole team is eatin' off of this good shit (Word up, throw your hands up)
Good shit, nigga, next time, no more reload shit (Cock back the MAC if, say whatever your Hawaiian style)
Keep your eyes open and your wallet in your front pocket (Exoticness, fly shit)
RZA, Ghost, and Chef, and Nas, niggas in the profit (Floatin' on a nine-five in the wind)"
Put It On,Big L,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Kid Capri]
Hey, hey, hey
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on

[Verse 1: Big L]
Ayo, you better flee hops, or get your head flown three blocks
L keep rappers' hearts pumpin' like Reeboks
And every year I gain clout and my name sprouts
Some brothers'd still be virgins if crack never came out
I got the wild style, always been a foul child
My guns go ""BOOM BOOM!"" and yo' guns go ""pow pow""
I'm known to have a hottie open
I keep the shotty smokin'
Front, and get half the bones in your body broken
And when it comes to gettin' nookie I'm not a rookie
I got girls that make that chick Toni Braxton look like Whoopi
I run with sturdy cliques
I'm never hittin' dirty chicks
Got thirty-five bodies, buddy, don't make it thirty-six
Step to this, you're good as gone
Word is bond, I leave mics torn when I put it on
[Chorus: Kid Capri]
So put it on, Big L, put it on!
Come on, put it onnn, and onnn, and onnn!
Come on, put it on, Big L, put it on!
Come on, put it on, represent, put it on, Come on!

[Verse 2: Big L]
Nobody can take nothin' from Big L but a loss, chief
The last punk who fronted got a mouth full of false teeth
I'm known to gas a hottie and blast a shotty
Got more cash than Gotti
(You don't know?) you better ask somebody
Big L is a crazy brother, and I'm a lady lover
A smooth kid that'll run up in your baby mother
I push a slick Benz, I'm known to hit skins
And get ends and commit sins with sick friends
'Cause I'm a money getter, also a honey hitter
You think you nice as me? Haha, you's a funny nigga
I flows, so one of my shows wouldn't be clever to miss
I'm leavin' competitors pissed
To tell you the truth, it gets no better than this
I'm catchin' wreck to the break of dawn
In this song, yo, it's a must that I put it on

[Chorus: Kid Capri]
Yeah, so put it on, Big L, put it on!
C'mon, put it onnn, big fella, put it on and on!
Put it on, Big L!
Put it on, represent!
Put it on, c'mon, put it on!
[Bridge: Patois Chatta]
Some boys see me gun nozzle and take a we fi joke
Boy, you gwan dead before you see me gun smoke
See me gun nozzle and take me fi joke
You gwan dead from a me you provoke

[Verse 3: Big L]
I drink Moët, not Beck's beer, I stay dressed in slick gear
Peace to my homies in the gangsta lean, I see you when I get there
And it's a fact I keep a gat in my arm reach
I charm freaks and bomb geeks from here to Palm Beach
I'm puttin' rappers in the wheelchair
Big L is the villain you still fear
'Cause I be hangin' in Harlem and shit is for real here
If you battle L you picked the wrong head
I smash mics like cornbread
You can't kill me, I was born dead
And I'm known to pull steel trigs and kill pigs
I run with ill kids and real nigs who peel wigs
My rap's steady slammin', I keep a heavy cannon
It's a new sheriff in town and it ain't Reggie Hammond
Peace to my peoples, the Children of the Corn
'Cause we put it on, adiós, ghost, I'm gone

[Chorus: Kid Capri]
So put it on, Big L, put it on!
C'mon, put it on, big fella put it on and onnn!
Big L, you gotta put it on and on!
Put it on, Big L put it on ond on!
Word up, knahmsayin?
My man Big L, runnin' things for the nine-four
And nine-oh-s, you know what I mean?
It's the Kid Capri, in full flair
And we gon' put it on a little somethin' like this
Big L, c'mon!

Im Housin,EPMD,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Parrish Smith]
Coolin' on the scene like a horse in a stable
A brother got ill and tried to snatch a fat cable
I stepped back, like it wasn't no thing
Punched him in the jaw with the fat gold ring
I had an ace in the hole when it came to that
(Yo P you was packin'?) You know I'm strapped
Posse kept rollin' it was hard to get with 'em
So I stepped back, and unbuttoned my Lee denim
They kept coming, just like I figured
So I stepped back, and started sprayin' niggas

[Erick Sermon]
What a way to go out, out like a sucker
But I'm on track, like a Long Island train conductor
That can head on a mission, suckers who be dissing
Always on my jock like a snake always hissing
Grabbing and tapping me like Luther Vandross
Take me to the bar for the drink and make a toast
Givin' best wishes to the best MC
The E the D-O-U-B-L-E
Because I'm housin'
[Parrish Smith]
Coolin at a party, no better yet disco
Head feelin mellow from a bottle of Cisco
Move
To crush and fry a sucker MC like crisco
Every chance I get, I try to kill
That's one less sucker new jack, who tried to act ill
I keep the place jumpin' 'til the party's through
Whether it's disco, hardcore, or rhythm and blues
Take off your coat, won't you stay a while
Check out the voice that is smooth and mild
It's like Wheel of Fortune, go on for big money
Come cold rock the party, and leave with your honey

[Erick Sermon]
Gimme the cue, check one two
Don't try to come off on me, because you doo-doo
Treatin me the E Doubl-E, like a stepchild
Well let me tell you homeboy you're livin' foul
MCs, you know who you are
(On the bandwagon) Why P? (Cause you a star)
This is the year that when the joker's are wild
When a fag can't hack it and try to bite the style
I get hip to the scheme, before it happens
If it gets wild, then I start cappin'
But for now, since everything's calm
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
As I proceed to rock, the girls are clockin'
Some brothers act hard but the rest are jockin'
Because I'm housin'
[Parrish Smith]
I come on strong, like a bodybuilder
Cast a spell upon a sucker, like witch Matilda
Deliver a rhyme like Federal Express
My intention's not to dis, but impress
For ladies and gents, who money was spent
To see the E-P-Double-E-M-D (yes the main event)
In concert... not worried bout oohs and boos (because we do work)
To make your body jerk
(To make your girl want to leave her man and start to flirt
With the P) Double-E MD Double E'n
I'm not skeezing, but pleasing
All party goers, also behind show-ers
Who like the not, fast slow flow of rhymes that form in my dome
Out the mouth, to the microphone
Because I'm housin'"

Mama love you
And I know you ain't no little boy no more
But you'll always be my baby
It seems like only yesterday I was holding you in my arms
Now look at you now, Biggie
But I worry about you
I worry about you all the time
Hangin' out on the corner
All times at night with the cruel people
Baby, that ain't nothin' but trouble
I always taught you that you could have whatever you dream
Well, I want you to hold onto that dream, baby
Hold on to it real tight, ‘cause the sky's the limit

[Break: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
How's everybody doin' tonight? (Alright)
I'd like to welcome to the stage (Alright, alright)
The lyrically acclaimed, ha (Woo)
I like this young man, because when he came out (Hahahaha)
He came out with the phrase:
He went from ashy to classy — haha, I like that (Alright, alright)
So everybody in the house give a warm
(Uh) Round of applause for The Notorious
B.I.G, ha
The Notorious B.I.G, ladies and gentlemen
Give it up for him, y'all!

Uh
A nigga never been as broke as me, I like that
When I was young, I had two pair of Lees, besides that
The pinstripes and the gray
The one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While niggas flirt, I'm sewin' tigers on my shirts, and alligators
You wanna see the inside? Huh, I see ya later
Here comes the drama
""Oh, that's that nigga with the fake""
Blaow! ""Why you punch me in my face?"" Stay in your place
Play your position (Uh), here come my intuition (Uh-huh)
Go in this nigga pocket, rob him while his friends watchin'
And hoes clockin', here comes respect
His crew's your crew, or they might be next
Look at they man eye, big man, they never try
So we rolled with 'em, stole with 'em

The milks was chocolate, the cookies — butter crunch

I had enough heart for most of 'em
Long as I got stuff from most of 'em

They depicted me the boss, of course
My orange box-cutter make the world go round
Plus I'm fuckin', bitches ain't my homegirls now
Start stackin', dabbled in crack, gun packin'
Nickname Medina, make the seniors tote my ninas
From gym class to Inglés, pass off a global
The only nigga with a mobile, can't you see like Total
Gettin' larger in waists and tastes
Ain't no tellin' where this felon is headin', just in case
Keep a shell at the tip of your melon, clear the space

Smokin' spliffs with niggas, real-life beginner killers

I ain't have to be in school by ten, I then

Syringe sold separately, Frank the Deputy
Quick to grab my Smith & Wesson like my dick was missin'
To protect my position, my corner, my lair
While we out here, say the Hustler's Prayer:
""If the game shakes me or breaks me
I hope it makes me a better man, take a better stand""
Put money in my mom's hand
Get my daughter this college plan so she don't need no man

Never great cause God is great, so ain’t no goats, ain’t no gates

Brace yourself, teeth straight, fix your face for Pete’s sake

Take that cool shit, make it lame, take that nerd shit, make it bang
Yeah, you heard us make it bang, yeah, ya heard me make it bang
Melt the change and make a ring, take that ring & make a bracelet
Take that bracelet make a chain, look how far my necklace hang
Connect that chain up to a crane, pull the game up by the brains
Could not move it just with brains so I had to use some bling

Sneak that message to the masses, you can call me Chocolate Rain
You might think my wallet drained, look how far my pockets hang

Cause he was a beast in the way that he controlled her
Rest in peace to Patrick, rest in peace to Stacks, kid
Rest in peace to rap, no, rest in peace to wackness

Boy, stop!
You ain't no DJ

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
I double dare, matter of fact, nigga, I double dog dare
Any rapper to take it there with this player here
Let's be clear, I'm a leader, not your peer
Valedictorian of this rap shit every year (year, year, year)
Like beer and pretzels with the game, I go good
I'm the Hansel to your Gretel, you's a dame, understood?
Overstand, ho ass nigga from my hood, I'm embarrassed
By the lack of class, sat in the back of class
But passed with flying colors with yo' backwards ass
You're like the caboose and I'm the engine locomotive
To let loose steam in the booth, scream, awooo!
Dream Team, nigga, fuck that pillow talk, keep sleeping
While I'm beating down yo' street up in that green thing
Greetings, Earthlings, I've been lurking deep in the shadows
Gathering artillery for the battle
Now, on the front line, I stand, microphone in my right hand
Left foot on the gas, don't make me put my foot in yo' ass
[Hook: Big Boi]

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
My momma gave birth to a 10-pound, 6-ounce dream
And God said look for the burning bush, now I turned to weed
So I jumped in my shell when I saw my momma burning trees
Hard white, I trickle nickel bags
Ice cold true shit, in the booth with blue lips
On your grave like a tulip, in the bar like a pool stick
808 Toomp shit, Magic Mike, poof, bitch
Ain't nowhere to rest, nowhere for you to sit
I stole your couch and I took your truck to move it with
Sofa any one of you wanna get to' up
I'mma tattoo, Kodak you, close up
Ain't no UFO, no, Yela's a supernova
Dogs are barking as soon as that trooper roll up
30 aught 6, Momma, don't gotta load up
'Cause I'm from The Varsity, it may be hard to get RC Cola, hold up

""Yeah, you're famous, so what?
I bet you can't hitch that semi up to this tow truck""
Rich with a hundred dollars, soul like a batch of collards
Yeah, I'm pale but I'll impale you with an Impala
Roll with pimp scholars, ATLiens
A-L-A-B-A-M-A agains, come and check my weight again
Baby, I know I ain't that crazy, the scale says heavy
Must be my dick the way bitches been hanging on it lately

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Yeah, we stay banging on the daily, soul funk crusader maybe
Tailored alligator soufflé, escalade all in yo' ladies
Space invader, I'm the lyrical Darth Vader
Give thanks, pussy nigga, I don't expose you as a hater
Got Decatur, East Point, College Park and the SWATs
Campbellton Road closed, road block, watch out for the cops
Gotta think outside the box, know how to connect the dots

Hustlers Ambition,50 Cent,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Sample: Maze]
Like the fire needs the air
I won't burn unless you're there, you're there
Oooh I need you
Like the fire needs the air
I won't burn unless you're there, you're there
Oooh I need you

[Intro - over Sample]
Yeah, I need you, I need you to hate
So I can use you for your energy
You know, it's real shit, feel this

[Verse 1]
America got a thing for this gangster shit, they love me
Black Chukkas, black skully, leather Pelle Pelle
I tag SPIT over Ramo's shit, I'm a vandal
Got that silver duct tape on my trey-eight handle
The women in my life bring confusion and shit
So like Nino in ""New Jack,"" I holla ""Cancel that bitch!""
Look at me, this is the life I chose
Niggas around me so cold, man my heart done froze
I built an empire on the low, the NARC's don't know
I'm the weatherman, I take that cocoa leaf and make that snow
Sit back, watch it turn to dope, watch it go out the do'
O after O, you know?
Homie, I'm just triple beam, dreaming, niggas be scheming
I fiend to live the good life, the fiends are just fiendin'
Conceal my weapon nice and neat so you can't see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me
[Chorus]
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (Buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (Fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I don't know shit about gymnastics, I somersault bricks
And black talons start flying when a nigga flip
I cook crack in the microwave, niggas can't fuck with me
Man my co-d's call me Chef Boyar-50
Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in they weed, shit
Send me them seeds, I'll grow them what they need
Them ain't Chia pet plants in the crib, that's chronic
And I'm selling them for 500 a pop, goddamn it
I sell anything I'm a hustler, I know how to grind
Step on grapes, put it in water and tell you it's wine
If you analyze me, what you will find
Is the DNA of a crook and what goes on in my mind
Is contagious, hypnotic, it sounds melodic
If rap was the block or a spot, I'd be that potent product
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
And you can locate me wherever that dope be
Getting money man
[Chorus]
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (Buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (Fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)

[Verse 3]
It's the Hustler's Ambition, close your eyes, listen see my vision
Mossberg pumpin', shotgun dumpin'
The drama means nothing, it's part of the game
Catch me in the coupé switching lanes or in the jeweler switching chains
I upgrade from dirty ""BS"" to clean VS
Rocks that I copped from proceeds from the spot
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Play the curb and get nauseous, watching the spinners spin
I made plans to make it, a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite your ass out to my estate
Them hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Pour Cristal in the blender, make a protein shake
I'm like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hefner'll tell you he ain't got shit on me
The feds watch me, icey, they can't stop me
Racist, pointing at me, ""Look at Niggaraci"" - hello
[Chorus]
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (Buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (Fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)"

This is heavy, new Bentley color: vanilla and cherry
Andretti on Pirelli, make a movie out the ghetty (Ugh)
Where my ring and my confetti? I'm Kobe Bryant-ready

My Colombian connect told me the Mexicans have moved in
And he know just how I get it, so we 'bout to introduce him

Got a Black chick that be boosting, got a white girl that be boofing
Gotta watch her 'cause she use it, but she fuck me like she stupid (Ayy)
And she always ready (Ready) to give me that Becky

Hit the club, ordered bottles, seen them sparks in the sky

I'm makin' mo—vies!
I'm so hood, remix!

[Chorus: T-Pain, DJ Khaled & Young Jeezy]
(I'm so hood!) Yeah, I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place
We always gon' be the best, man
'Cause you and your man is plannin' to hate (We run this, man)
(I'm so hood!) And I got these golds up in my mouth
I make hit records, man, this is what I do
If you get closer to my house, then you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm out the (Hood!) And if you feel me, put your hands up
I'm out the, this the remix
(Hood!) My hood niggas, can you stand up?
Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
I gave you We Takin' Over (Yo Khaled)
(I'm so hood!) If you not from here you can walk it out
Ay, Young Jeezy (I got 'em, homie)
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talkin' 'bout
You got me? (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Verse 1: Jeezy, Ludacris & T-Pain]
I'm so H to the double O-D
Walk around, there's goddamn money on me
Pockets so fat, don't make no sense
Whips so clean, it don't need no tints
Watch so bright, it don't need no light
You know where it were, don't need no mic
Niggas like, ""Young, what you get for your show?""
Tell 'em, ""Same thing I used to get for the blow""
Set 'em on the run, nigga, what I got to lose?
Put 'em in the vans, I ain't talkin' 'bout the shoes
Do the speed limit, watch out for the lights
Pussy ass niggas, gotta watch out for the dykes
Seventeen-five, yeah nigga, I said it
Seventeen-five, yeah nigga, I meant it
And when we do it bad, but I'm doin' good (In my hood, Luda!)
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so motherfuckin' (Hood!)

[Verse 2: Ludacris & T-Pain]
Look here, everybody come equipped with bangers
Throwin' up our middle fingers
And you know I don't slip
So I gotta keep ten in the clip and one in the chamber
Better be walkin' with angels
And never take candy from strangers
Through the stress and strife
Had to earn my stripes like I played with the Bengals (Hood!)
I'm in the zone, holmes, goin' for the two-point conversion
I'm so hood that Ludacris shoulda been on the original version
But this is the remix, with the cheap tricks, hittin' sweet licks
And I cut the braids off
But the waves and the fade'll make you seasick
See this is the way that we ball
And this is the way that we brawl
So put a fist in the air if you care
That united we stand and divided we fall
When the South's in the house, better watch your mouth
'Cause we on that hood shit
I'm hood rich, comin' around your hood, bitch
I swear I'm so—
[Chorus: T-Pain, DJ Khaled & Busta Rhymes]
I'm so hood! (Remix!) and if you feel me, put your hands up
(Hood!) My hood niggas, can you stand up?
Khaled, they actin' like we ain't

The kings of the streets and the gods of the hood
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Busta Bust, bitches!
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm so hood!

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes & T-Pain]
See all I know is how to go and get my money again and again
Top down, let the money blow in the wind
With a bad bitch sittin' in the passenger seat
With a doobie-wrapped head full of bobbie pins
You know I keep that thang when I walk
See the dialect different from the slang in my talk
Baby still leavin', got a crackhead frontin'
Got another bad bitch that'll boost for the spark (Hood!)
I'm used to leavin' the strip last
Hustlin' until the sun comes up gettin' cash
So much bread in all of my four pockets
It look like a nigga got hips with an ass
And from the DNA in my blood
Niggas idolize me and try to do what I does
And if that other nigga ain't really from the hood
You can easily die, tell who that fake nigga was (Hood!)
And even though I spit a little rap
Got niggas in the hood tryna sell the most crack
Violator, I send a nigga to do it
Just to make you spend a lot of money just to get your shit back!
Y'all niggas know where I'm from
And I rep it to the fullest 'til the day that I'm done
So hood where we live, if a nigga sold drugs
And he rich, momma still proud of her son! (Hood!)
[Verse 4: Big Boi & T-Pain]
Daddy Fat Saxxx so hood like the Cadillac
Ornament, on from the Babylon
Call an ambulance to come and pick that ass up
Cause the nigga never had the chance
They tryna dance with the devil in a pale moonlight
Advance on a level that they can't do right
Lay hands on a fella like the man in blue lights
Whoop, whoop, do it twice (Hood!)
Your boy the B-I-G
I'm nicer than MC in your top three
You cocky, I cock, squeeze
Bust them things, now you sloppy
Speed it up, slow it down then screw it
Don't bite the flow cause I got that fluid
Run through the crew on some whole other new shit
Newness, bitch, we do this

[Chorus: T-Pain, DJ Khaled & Lil Wayne]
I'm so hood! (Remix) and if you feel me, put your hands up
(Hood!) My hood niggas, can you stand up?
(I'm so hood!) If you not from here, you can walk it out (Alright)
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talkin' 'bout (Weezy!)
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm so hood!

Home sweet, Home Depot, you will need a hammer
It go down like Frasier, I ain't talkin' Kelsey Grammer
I be shittin' on you boys, I need a Alka-Seltzer sandwich, ugh (Hood!)
Since I heard Plies, I done bought the Phantom back
And went and got me a fifty-two inch Maybach (Calca, ghetto gatka, haha)
I'm eatin' like a big dog, I'm so full, I'm so good
I'm so straight, you so fake, I'm so real, I'm so hood (I'm so hood!)
Yup, crack, crack, crack, crack-crack-crack-crack-crack-crack

[Verse 6: Fat Joe, T-Pain & Birdman]
Yeah nigga, welcome to the Crackhouse
I should own a McDonald's the way I bring the MAC's out
I'm from the hood where every nigga lies
Flip a couple grams, they tell you they bakin' pies, shit (Hood!)
Still got my name carved in that central bookin'
Gave that pussy a scar and told her, ""Good lookin'"" (Yeah)
You's a crack baby, that means your momma paid me
You can't even blame me, that's what the hood made me

[Verse 7: Birdman & T-Pain]
Martin Luther King, Calliope, Magnolia, Melpomene
Gettin' that money with a triple beam
We ride on Clyde, on Josephine
Saints is my team, that's what we breathe nigga
That's how we eat, get this money on the streets nigga (Hood!)
VL my street, blood, five star G, blood
Fly as a bird, got these eagles on my seat, blood
Then head back where I stay, 3rd Ward, we get that cake
Thirteen is where I lay, shouts out to M-I-A (Hood!)

[Verse 8: Rick Ross & T-Pain]
Mo' money, mo' problems, don't call me conceited
Just call me the boss, always got what you needed
M-I-Yayo so hot, but my neck got the fever
If you sneeze, you get shot, Gunplay makin' believers (Hood!)
I just bought me a ranch, watch the hundreds stacks
No, those ain't Rolex diamonds, what you done to that?

You fine as hell
I guess I met you for a reason only time could tell, but well

Do you like the finer things or are you a simple woman?
Would you drink with a nigga, do you smoke weed?
Done be ashamed, it ain't no thang, I used to blow trees
Getting lifted
I quit the shit, I might get high with you
It's only fitting cause I'm looking super fly with you
A flower you, a powerful, you do something to me
Cause girl I caught the vibes
Like you threw something to me-so I threw em back

Real slow yea I'll make you feel special
I can feel your heart beating fast
From the passion, ya hands reaching for the sheets to grab
And now ya leaking, freaking ain't no speaking but you moaning!
Ya so fine I got to give it to you
[Hook]
Ay can I hit it in the morning?
Can I hit it in the morning?
The sun rising while you moaning

[Verse 3]
I got a slight obsession-of watch your face while ya moaning
Do you like caressing or do you like aggression?
You the fighting, wrestling, biting pillows
Do you want it in the dark or while the lights is still on?
I'm fantasizing in my mind bout how your body feel
While we sweating you dripping wet from what your body spill
Now if your nervous and hesitant just let it go
See baby lately seems my life been hell and heaven knows
That you looking like an angel-sent from the heavens, God bless your every angle
Got a nigga tangle in your spider web
I'm doing shit I never might of did
And I ain't stopping baby even if the light is red
Your body's right as rain
So where the hydroplane
That ass is fat baby ain't no way to hide your frame
Thank God I found you
Just holla when you want it
Cause girl your so thorough"

[Verse]
I walk the night in rhyming armor, bomb a nigga like a winter coat
Have him on Death Row searching for an Interscope
Yet I sparkle like Irene Cara
Symbolize dope, like sirens do terror
Mary Lou just had a baby someone else decapitated
Flashbacks of past raps make me so glad I made it
Players is getting traded
I drop a gem on, them who's style is jaded
My juice is grated
Shit is so banging niggas say it's gang related
On philosopher's rink of thought, I've skated with precision
Crews is getting split like decisions
Com'a let it ride and collision
Vision like Coleco or intele, I battle stars in stellar
Regions, my thought scheme was my like my offspring
Now, it's teething
My reason to rhyme applies to season and time
Seizing the mind, body and regions divine
In mom's cookouts, I'm leaving the swine
Verbal vegetarian, squash beef with Ice Cube
Came in this rap life nude
Now I'm fully clothed with flows
You tricks can't hide behind expensive cars and clothes
Old niggas I expose like Luke does hoes in videos
With classic material, imperial and rugged like
Got mag, but my slugs a mic
You fake like a smile, like a hug I'm tight
Skip ladies, this is rip a muthafucka night
Auricle air-outs, niggas don't even run for cover right
Downtown interracial lovers hold hands
I breathe heavy like an old man, with a cold can of Old Style
Hold a Stone Isle profile
Mix between Malcolm X and Sef when I go wild
Hold mics like a second nut until the second coming
Humming coming towards you with power like forwards do
Hip hop, you my bitch and like a Ford, I'm exploring you
Some wack niggas be cool, with them I stay cordial
Flow at room temperature, cats is presumed miniature
Like golf, soft like Tiger Woods
At real nigga angles I've stood with ways that's geometric
Don't need to rob banks with dyke broads to set it
I levitate to the occasion, lounge like a lyricist
Rhyme wise, you a rest haven
You sat by the door spooked like I was Wes Craven
You need to do more deleting and less saving
A praise in hell, raising heaven
As the bill on my pager leavens
What you should have known from day one
You will on day seven

When I was little, my father was famous
He was the greatest samurai in the empire
And he was the Shogun's decapitator
He cut off the heads of 131 lords
It was a bad time for the empire
The Shogun just stayed inside his castle and he never came out
People said his brain was infected by devils
My father would come home, he would forget about the killings
He wasn't scared of the Shogun, but the Shogun was scared of him
Maybe that was the problem
Then, one night, the Shogun sent his ninja spies to our house
They were supposed to kill my father but they didn't
That was the night everything changed

[Intro: RZA]
See, sometimes
You gotta flash 'em back
See, niggas don't know where this shit started
Y'all know where it came from
I'm sayin', we gonna take y'all back to the source

Now on with the mental plane, to spark the brain
With the building to be born
Yo, RZA, flip the track with the what to cut

[Verse 1: GZA]
Fake niggas get flipped in mic fights
I swing swords and cut clowns
Shit is too swift to bite, you record and write it down
I flow like the blood on a murder scene
Like a syringe, on some wild out shit to insert a fiend
But it was your op. to shop stolen art
Catch a swollen heart from not rollin' smart
I put mad pressure on phony wack rhymes that get hurt
Shit's played like zodiac signs on sweatshirts
That's minimum and feminine like sandals
My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble
Energy is felt once the cards are dealt
With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
That attack the mic-phones like cyclones or typhoon
I represent from midnight to high noon
I don't waste ink, nigga, I think
I drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink
'Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed
Through clouds of smoke of natural blends of weed
Only under one circumstance, that's if I'm blunted
Turn that shit up, my Clan in Da Front want it

Now, when the MC's came to live out the name

I'm on a Mission that niggas say is Impossible
But when I swing my swords, they all choppable
I be the body dropper, the heartbeat stopper
Child educator, plus head amputator
'Cause niggas' styles are old like Mark 5 sneakers
Lyrics are weak like clock radio speakers
Don't even stop in my station and attack
While your plan failed, get derailed like Amtrak
What the fuck for? Down by law, I make law
I be justice, I sentence that ass two-to-four
'Round the clock, that state pen time, check it
But the pens I be stickin' with, you can't state the crime
Came through with the Wu, slid off on the DL
I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells
Now come aboard, it's Medina bound
Enter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound
It's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel
So deep, it's picked up on radios in tunnels
Niggas are fascinated how the shit begin
Get vaccinated, my logo is branded in your skin

When the MC's came to live out the name

Yeah, I never brag how real I keep it, 'cause it's the best secret
I rock a vest prestigious, Cuban link flooded Jesus
In a Lex, watchin' Kathie Lee & Regis
My actions are one with the seasons
A TEC squeezin' executioner
Winter time, I rock a fur
Mega popular center of attraction
Climaxin', my bitches, they be laughin'
They high from sniffin' coke off a twenty-cent Andrew Jackson
City lights spark a New York night
Rossi and Martini sippin', Sergio Tacchini
Flippin' mad pies, low price, I blow dice and throw them
.45 by my scrotum, manifest the 'Do or Die' slogan
My niggas roll in ten M3's
Twenty Gods poppin' wheelies on Kawasakis
Hip-hop's got me on some ol', sprayin' shots like a drum roll
Blankin' out, never miscount the shells my gun hold
I don't stunt, I regulate
Henny and Sprite, I separate
Watchin' crab niggas marinate

Remy on imaginary graves
Put my hat on my waves
Latter Day Saints say religious praise
I dolo, challenge any team or solo
You must be buggin' out, new to my shit, home on a furlough
Ask around who's laid up, sharp and straight up
Mafioso, gettin' niggas' wakes sprayed up
Skies are misty, my life predicted by a gypsy
I'll one day walk into shots, drunk off champagne from Sicily
This be the drama, I'mma pause like a comma in a sentence
Paragraph's indented
Bloodshot red eyes high, yellow envelopes of lye
Openin' cigars, let tobacco fly
Condos are tune-proof, we're lookin' out the sky's moon-roof
Shittin' like gin and prune juice
Yo, the system wants the coon's noose, hang 'em high
Courtrooms filled up
It's off the hook while I just wrote a statement

Damn
Look how muh-fuckers use a nigga
Just use me for whatever the fuck they want
I don't get to say shit
Just grab me, just do what the fuck they want
Sell me, throw me away
Niggas just don't give a fuck about a nigga like me, right
Like I'm a f-, I'm a gun, shit
It's like I'm a motherfucking gun
I can't believe this shit
Word up, word up

[Verse 1]
I seen some cold nights and bloody days
They grab me, bullets spray
They use me wrong, so I sing this song to this day
My body is cold steel, for real
I was made to kill, that's why they keep me concealed
Under car seats, they sneak me in clubs
Been in the hands of mad thugs
They feed me when they load me with mad slugs
Seventeen precisely, one in my head
They call me Desert Eagle, semi-auto with lead
I'm seven inches, four pounds, been through so many towns
Ohio to Little Rock to Canarsie, living harshly
Beat up and battered
They pull me out, I watch as niggas scattered
Making me kill, but what I feel, it never mattered
When I'm empty, I'm quiet
Finding myself fiending to be fired
A broken safety, niggas place me in shelves, under beds
So I beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred
Keeping me full up with hollow heads
[Chorus]
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might've took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild

[Verse 2]
Always I'm in some shit
My abdomen is the clip, the barrel's my dick
Uncircumcised, pull my skin back and cock me
I bust off when they unlock me
Results of what happens to niggas shock me
I see niggas bleeding, running from me in fear
Stunningly, tears fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys
For years, I've been used in robberies
Giving niggas heart to follow me
Placing peoples in graves, funerals made 'cause I was sprayed
I was laid in a shelf wit' a grenade
Met a wrecked-up TEC with numbers on his chest that say:
Five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five and zero
Had a serial defaced, hoping one day police would place
Where he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him
Tired of murdering, made him wanna be a plain gun
But yo, I had some other plans, like the next time the beef is on
I make myself jam right in my owner's hand
[Chorus]
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild

[Verse 3]
Yo, weeks went by and I'm surprised
Still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides
Besides me, it's bullets, two vests and then a nine
There's a grenade in a box, and that TEC that kept crying
'Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year, he's rusty, it's clear
He's 'bout to fall to pieces 'cause of his murder career
Yo, I can hear somebody coming in
Open the shelf, his eyes bubbling
He said it was on, I felt his palm troubled him
Shaking, somebody stomped him out, his dome was aching
He placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waiting
My creation was for Blacks to kill Blacks
It's gats like me that accidentally go off, making niggas memories
But this time, it's done intentionally
He walked me outside, saw this cat
Cocked me back, said, ""Remember me?""
He pulled the trigger but I held on, it felt wrong
Knowing niggas is waiting in Hell for him
He squeezed harder, I didn't budge
Sick of the blood, sick of them thugs
Sick of wrath of the next man's grudge
What the other kid did was pull out, no doubt
A newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase
My owner fell to the floor, his wig split
So fast, I didn't know he was hit, it's over wit'
Heard mad niggas screaming, niggas running, cops is coming
Now I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me

Man, duke, I was in love with this girl,, duke
I was tore up, dog, I'm tellin' you, man
Shit is wild, man, for real
It's, she's from, let me tell you about her

[Verse 1]
Yo, in she came with the same type game
The type of girl givin' out the fake cellphone and name
Big fame, she like cats with big things
Jewels chipped, money clip, phone flip, the six range
I seen her on the Ave., spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front
She spot me like paparazzi, shot me a glance
In that Catwoman stance with the fat booty pants, hot damn!
What's your name, love? Where you came from?
Neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up
The Schwinns at the Reebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of?
I tried to play it low key, but couldn't keep it down
Asked her to dance and she was like, ""Yo, I'm leavin' now""
An hour later, sounds from Jamaica
She's sippin' Cris' straight up, skankin', windin' her waist up
Scene 2 — my fam's throwin' a jam
Fareed is on the stand, big things is in the plans
The brother Big Mu makes space for me to move
""A-yo, this my man Mos, baby, let me introduce""
I turned around (Say word!)
You was the same pretty bird who I had priorly observed
Tryin' to play me for the herb (Yeah, that's her)
Shocked as hell she couldn't get it together
I just played along and pretended I never met her
How you feelin'? ""Oh, I'm fine"", my name is Mos ""I'm Sharice""
I heard so much good about you, it's nice to finally meet
We moved to the booth reserved for crew especially
And honey love ended up sittin' directly next to me
I'm type polite, but now I'm lookin' at her skeptically
'Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry
Designer fabric, shoes and accessories
Chinky eyes, sweet voice is fuckin' with me mentally
We conversated, made her laugh — yeah, you know me, bro
Even though I know the steelo, she wild sweet, yo
I'm 'bout to murk, I say peace to the family
She hop up like, ""How you gon' leave before you dance with me?""

She blew my whole head with that, duke, I was like, word?
I played it low though
I was like, yeah, aight, come on then, let's go
Niggas was mad, niggas was so sick, I tell (ya)
Yo, honey was so blazin', she was just..
Yo, she looked like Jayne Kennedy, word bond, to my mother, man
She was that ill, man
She take me to the dance floor and she start whisperin' to me..

[Verse 2]
""Yo, let me apologize for the other night, I know it wasn't right
But baby, you know what it's like, some brothers don't be comin' right""
I understand, I'm feelin' you
Besides, ""Can I have a dance?"" ain't really that original
We laughed about it, traced her arms across my shoulder blades
They playin' Lovers Rock, I got the folded fingers on her waist
Heatin' my blood up like the Arizona summer
Song finished then she whispered, ""Honey, let's exchange numbers""
Scene 3 — weeks of datin', late night conversation
In the crib, heart racin', tryin' to be cool and patient
She touched on my eyelids, the room fell silent
She walked away smilin', singin' Gregory Isaacs
Like, ""If I don't, if I don't have you""
Showin' me her tan line and her tattoo
Playin' Sade, Sweetest Taboo
Burnin' candles, all my other plans got cancelled
Man, I smashed it like a Idaho potato
She call me at my J.O., ""Come now"", I can't say no
Ginseng tree trunks, rockin' the P-funk
Cockin' her knees up, champion lover, not ease up
Three months — she call, I feel I'm runnin' a fever
Six months — I'm tellin' her I desperately need her
Nine months — flu-like symptoms when shorty not around
I need more than to knock it down, I'm really tryin' to lock it down
Midnight, we hook up and go at it
Burn a stoge and let her know, sweetheart, I got to have it
She tellin' me commitment is somethin' she can't manage
Wake up the next mornin', she gone like it was magic
Aww, damn it! My shit is on Harrison Ford Frantic
My 911's unanswered by my fly Taurus enchantress
Next week, Mu hit me up, I saw Sharice at the Kittie club
With some bangin' ass Asian playin' lay it down and lick me up

Beef rap, could lead to getting teeth capped
Or even a wreath for mom dukes on some grief crap
I suggest you change your diet
It can lead to high blood pressure if you fry it
Or even a stroke, heart attack, heart disease
It ain't no starting back once arteries start to squeeze
Take the easy way out phony, until then
They know they wouldn't be talking that bologna in the bullpen
So disgusting, pardon self as I discuss this
They talk a wealth of shit and they ain't never seen injustice
Bust this, like a cold milk from out the toilet

A rather ugly brother with flows that's gorgeous
Drop dead joints hit the whips like bird shit
They need it like a hole in they head or a third tit
Her bra smell, his card say, ""Aw Hell!""
Barred from all bars and kicked out the Carvel
Keep a cooker where the jar fell
And keep a cheap hooker that's off the hook like Ma Bell
Top bleeding, maybe fella took the loaded rod gears
Stop feeding babies colored sugar-coated lard squares
The odd pair swears and God fears
Even when it's rotten, we've gotten through the hard years
I wrote this note around New Year's
Off a couple of shots and a few beers, but who cares?
Enough about me, it's about the beats
Not about the streets and who food he 'bout to eat
A rhyming cannibal who's dressed to kill and cynical
Whether is it animal, vegetable or mineral
It's a miracle how he get so lyrical
And proceed to move the crowd like a old negro spiritual
For a mil', do a commercial for Mello Yello
Tell them devils, ""Hell no, sell y'all own Jello""
We hollow krills, she swallow pills
He follow flea collar three dollar bills
And squealed for halal veal, if y'all appeal
Dig the real, it's how the big ballers deal
Twirl a L after every meal (""Food!"")

What up? To all rappers: shut up with your shutting up
And keep a shirt on, at least a button-up
Yuck, is they rhymers or strippin' males?
Out-of-work jerks since they shut down Chippendales
They chippin' nails, DOOM tippin' scales
Let alone the pre-orders that's counted off shippin' sales
This one goes out to all my peoples skippin' bail
Dippin' jail, whippin' tail and sippin' ale
Light the doobie 'til it glow like a ruby
After which, they couldn't find the Villain, like Scooby

Makeshift Patriot,Sage Francis,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
I’ve heard enough of you young fellas, who think you know it all
You know nothing, you have not seen a shot fired
And you’re waving the damn flag
Frank, what’s up man?
Watchin' some bullshit, on the news
Fuckin' bullshit. Reporters, tryin' to win a fuckin' Emmy

[Hook]
Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself at half-mast
Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself at half-mast
Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself at half-mast
Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself via live telecast
Coming live from my own funeral
Beautiful weather offered a nice shine
Which is suitable for a full view of a forever-altered skyline
It's times like these I freestyle biased opinions every other sentence
My journalistic ethics slip when I pass them off as objective:
""Don't gimme that ethical shit.""
I've got exclusive, explicit images to present to impressionable American kids
And it's time to show this world how big our edifice is

That's exactly what they attacked when a typically dark-skinned Disney villain
Used civilians against civilians and charged the Trojan horses into our buildings
Using commercial aviation as instruments of destruction
Pregnant women couldn't protect their children
Wheelchairs were stairway obstructions
Now I have to backpedal from the shower of glass and metal
Wondering how after it settles we'll find who provided power to radical rebels
The Melting Pot seems to be calling the kettle black when it boils over
But only on our own soil so the little boy holds a toy soldier
And waits for the suit and tie to come home. We won't wait till he's older
Before we destroy hopes for a colder war to end
""Now get a close up of his head""

Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself at half-mast
Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself while the stock markets crash
The city is covered in inches of muck
I see some other pictures of victims are up
Grieving mothers are thinking their children are stuck
Leaping lovers are making decisions to jump!
While holding hands, to escape the brutal heat
Sometimes in groups of the three
The fallout goes far beyond the toxic cloud where people look like debris
But all they saw after all was said, beyond the talking heads
Was bloody dust with legs looking like the walking dead calling for meds
Hospitals are overwhelmed. Volunteers need to go the hell home
Moments of silence for fire fighters were interupted by cell phones
Who's going to make that call to increase an unknown death toll?
It's the one we rally behind
He's got a megaphone, and he's promising to make heads roll
So we cheer him on, but asbestos is affecting our breath control
The less we know, the more they fabricate. The easier it is to sell souls

Talking Interlude:

""There is a new price on freedom, so buy into it while supplies last
Changes need to be made: No more curbside baggage
7PM curfew
Racial profiling will continue with less bitching
We’ve unified over who to kill, so until I find more relevant scripture to quote, remember; our God is bigger, stronger, smarter and much wealthier
So wave those flags with pride, especially the white part""
We sell addictive 24-hour candlelight vigil in TVs
Freedom will be defended at the cost of civil liberties
Viewers are glued to television screens
Stuck, cause lots of things seem too sick
I use opportunities to pluck heart strings for theme music

I'll show you which culture to pump your fist at, and what foot is right to kiss
We don't know who the culprit is yet, but he looks like this
We know who the heros are. Not the xenophobes who act hard
""We taught that dog to squat
How dare he do that shit in our own back yard!""

They happened to scar our financial state and char our landscape
Can you count how many times so far I ran back this same damn tape?
While a cameraman creates news and shoves it down our throats on the West Bank
With a ten-second clip put on constant loop to provoke US angst

So get your tanks and load your guns and hold your sons in a family huddle
Because even if we win this tug of war and even the score, humanity struggles
There's a desperate need of blood for what's been uncovered under the rubble
Some of them dug for answers in the mess, but the rest were looking for trouble

The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself at half-mast
Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock

It's the makeshift, the patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself, don't waive your rights with your flags"

Ow, baby

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
I don't believe it, it's almost too good to be true
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 1]
The way she moves, she's like a belly dancer
She's shaking that ass to the new Nelly jams, I
Think someone's at the door, but I don't think I'ma answer
Police saying ""freeze,"" (Oh), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, freeze?
Please, I'm a human being, I have needs
I'm not done, not 'til I'm finished peeing
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing
Mr. Officer, I'm already on my knees
I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee
Pee, pee, yes, I make R&B
I sing song, it go ring-a-chong, a-ching-chong-chong-chong-ching
Psych, I joke, I joke, I kid, I kid
If I offend, I'm sorry, please, please, forgive
For I am Triumph the Puppet Dog, I am a mere puppet
I can get away with anything I say and you will love it

The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go

Nick, I ain't never seen an ass like that
Every time I see the show on MTV, my pee-pee goes
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 2]
Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
Now they getting older, they're starting to grow bum-bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Police saying ""freeze,"" (Oh), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, freeze? Geez, I just got my seat
I have ticket, look, I put it away, my zipper's zipped
Please do not remove me from this movie theater, please
I did not even get to see Mary-Kate shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great, big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Pee-wee Herman, this movie's PG
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free
Free, yes, free, right back on the streets
What do you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you'll laugh 'cause there's a puppet on my hand (Hahaha)
[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
Hilary Duff is not quite old enough, so
I ain't never seen a butt like that
Maybe next year, I'll say ""ass"" and she'll make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 3]
The way she moves, she dances like a go-go
In that video, she sings, ""Get out, you bozo""
I need a new boyfriend, hi, my name is JoJo
Police saying ""freeze,"" (Oh), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, freeze? My computers will be seized
And my keys to my ranch, I just bake cookies
Mr. Officer, lookie, take a whiff of this
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me, no, not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word ""pee-pee""
Pee, on the radio, but I think I did
Janet, is that a breast? I think I just saw a tit
Psych, I joke, I joke, I kid, I kid
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Arnold, get down

The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go

Too bold, too cold like wet salam—

If the girl got a voice, then she talk about me, me!
He say, she say, I say me
We'll be in the M-I-A-mi
With me, and T, and Big Ronnie
And the homie Streets prob'ly somewhere on the beach
And Tez and E prob'ly somewhere in the Jeep
And Marl' in the Phantom with Mr. G
And me! Me! It's all about me!
Play with me and it's all-out beef
Beef! Yes! Chest! Feet!
Tag! Bag! Blood! Sheets!
Yikes! Yeeks! Great Scott—
Storch, can I borrow your yacht?
Watch me and my clique go all-out
Like the ball in the stands, we balls out, ugh!
Boy, I don't know what y'all 'bout
But I just spit like a dog mouth
Pink ice, just looking like a hog mouth
Vroom! I had to bring the hog out
Light them trees, bring a log out
Every day Christmas, I'm eggnogged out
And hip-hop is my new-bought house
My flow just grew legs and walked out—bye"

[Verse 1: Ikon the Verbal Hologram]
The War of Gods and Men
I condemn them who believe
In ancient fallacies and the heresy of thieves
Burn the unholy in your filthy religion
Paganism and the prism of three-dimensional prison
I walk through the liquid of the Seven Rivers
And deliver rhyme schemes that cut like verbal scissors
Or arrows
The sacred science of the pharaohs
Millennium prophesies of tarots
Murdered cattle, discovered near the crop circles of the land
While we fight wars for political whores like Mary Magdalan
The Hologram plans his incision
Apparition of Tibetan black magicians
My compositions will turn men into slaves
Holographic aspects of particles and waves
Propel the spacecraft in the Pleiades
Dwell in the abyssal plains like the Horse of Hades
The Wheel of Infinity, the Chamber of the Trinity
Levitators of the fifth level magician of divinity
Like a pentadrone, I sent your dome into the forest
Of Ibilis
Like the wilderness of Tan
The Verbal Hologram! The Verbal Hologram!
""My perception of poetical injection is ejaculation
The Immaculate Conception"" [Pharoahe Monch] (repeat 4X)

[Verse 2: Ikon the Verbal Hologram]
The decaton, the higher arc modron
Encompass my soul in a beam like proton
I am Voltron With helmeted head and lotus flower
Incantations, wind walking teleportations
I dwell in a body that can't be slain
The verbal flame, he atomic spark of pain
So I drain, the energy from your Chakra system
Watch me glisten like the sun
The Chosen One, The cyborg relation
My shit is crazy like Free Masons
Meeting camp crystal lake with Jason
Complex wind, City of screaming metal in the Vatican
I shatter him who walks on the plains of Hell
To sacrifice El, Young El, Young El
A dark fall for all who battle the mystic meditation
Face decapitation and material contamination
By the spiritual deviation
Translation of ancient civilization
Nonaton, overseer of law and order
The verbal slaughter, Hologram walks on water
Immune to illusion and scientifical blows
Armed with black magic, spears, and crossbows
Feeble attempts to apprehend the Hologram
Overstand, I kill man like Wodan
So no man step into the darkness of the set
Study with Chinese masters like Jesus in Tibet
Staff of Moses, urn of ashes
Morphing my soul into solids, liquids, and gases
