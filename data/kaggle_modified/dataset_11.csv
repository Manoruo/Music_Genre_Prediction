Crime,Mr. Dream,['rock'],"It's a crime, the way they chop up my girlfriends
It's a sign, we shouldn't fight anyway
We got time, to dig em out of the dustbins
They're not mine, but i'll dig em out anyway

It's like a twist
It's in the wrist
It might get weird so don't flake
So stuffed with sound
So pound for pound
So old you just can't kill

It's a crime, the way they chop up my girlfriends
It's a sign, we shouldn't fight anyway

Too cold to drink
Too fat to sink
Too old but not antique yet

We pushed 'em down
We took the mound
We put our foot on it
Come on, judges, it's in your hands
I won't blab on but I can't stand-
All the crime, and ways they chop up my girlfriends

It's a sign, we shouldn't fight anyway
Shouldn't fight anyway"
Scarred for Life,Mr. Dream,['rock'],"Missed my alarm, I woke up late
I'm standing on the other train
The window smeared with blood and brain
And now I'll never be the same

He took off on a summer day
An early weekend at the lake
She washed up hairless, had no face
And now he'll never be the same"
Holy Name,Mr. Dream,['rock'],"Oh, it never made sense to me
Ya cut it but it never bleeds
An ocean but it wasn't deep
And detrimental to the team

Go
Run around the lazy screens
Cause losers have to wash the sheets
And losers never move their feet
So shoot it when you're hot
Not servin' (damnation, damnation)
Not servin'
Not servin'
Not servin'

Whoa
It never made sense to me
Another nut in the machine
It doesn't look like blood to me
But everybody's red, oh
Not servin' (damnation, damnation)
Not servin'
Not servin'
Not servin'

Callin' in the pros
Stealin' all the signs
Suckin' down the wine, the wine...

All the wings but no control
All the things we oversold
Make the cuts, collect the gold
All the wings but no control"
Shotgun Tricks,Mr. Dream,['rock'],"Not a game to me
It's always real to me
It's always fun, it's never dull
Cause honey, in my eyes, everything's a target

Line 'em up for me
Mow 'em down for me
Nice and slow
Nice and slow

And honey go get my
Shotgun
Go get my (shotgun)
Bang bang bang bang bang

I've been to Hell
Everyone cries there
The demons are great
But no one has eyes for the truth that flows so cold

That's how it feels
That's how it feels to me
It's all like ""drop dead,"" to me
So honey go get my
Shotgun
Go get my (shotgun)
Bang bang bang bang woo-hoo
I've been to Hell
Everyone cries there
The demons are great
But no one has eyes for the truth that blows so cold

Hey!
Stand back
Stand still
Cause I'm bad news"
Walter,Mr. Dream,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Walter's got a big problem
The secret's out, after 32 years and 5 months
The man's got shit for brains
Shit for brains

Ha ha ha, the end of the charade
Ha ha ha, the difference that it made
Disappointed in me, disappointed in you
It's still amazing that we never knew, never guessed for so long

People saying that keeping his mouth shut
Is proof that he ain't dumb
He ain't dumb"
Unfinished Business,Mr. Dream,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","The road we take won't define us
The ice we break has no ability to complain
We got strong, we moved on, we thew dance-offs on the lawn, they can't hurt us
We got conned, we respond, we bring tow trucks to the prom, they can't hurt, hurt us

It's almost done
It's almost done
It's almost done
Then we're strong, number one, point our spaceships at the sun

The limbs we shake won't support us
The laughs we fake have no ability to explain
We went long, we got soft, we tapped sleepers they went off, who can hurt us?
Number one, we piss bronze, raced some race cars, got us blondes, who can hurt us?

It's almost done
It's almost done
It's almost done
Then we're strong, number one, point our spaceships at the sun

Well hey, we got strong, and we moved on, they can't hurt us
Oh and, we got conned, we respond, who can hurt us?

Sound of da Police,KRS-One,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Produced by Showbiz]

[Chorus]
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast (Yes indeed)
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast (Yes indeed)

[Verse 1]
Stand clear, Don man'll talk
You can't stand where I stand, you can't walk where I walk
Watch out, we run New York
Policeman come, we bust him out the park
I know this for a fact, you don't like how I act
You claim I'm sellin' crack, but you be doin' that
I'd rather say see ya, ‘cause I would never be ya
Be an officer? You wicked overseer!
You hotshot, wanna get props and be a savior
First show a little respect, change your behavior
Change your attitude, change your plan
There could never really be justice on stolen land
Are you really for peace and equality?
Or when my car is hooked up, you know you wanna follow me
Your laws are minimal
‘Cause you won't even think about lookin' at the real criminal
This has got to cease
‘Cause we be getting hyped to the sound of da police
[Chorus]
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast

[Verse 2]
Now here's a likkle truth, open up your eye
While you're checkin' out the boom-bap, check the exercise
Take the word overseer, like a sample
Repeat it very quickly in a crew, for example
Overseer, overseer, overseer, overseer
Officer, officer, officer, officer
Yeah, officer from overseer
You need a little clarity? Check the similarity!
The overseer rode around the plantation
The officer is off, patrollin' all the nation
The overseer could stop you, ""What you're doing?""
The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing
The overseer had the right to get ill
And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill
The officer has the right to arrest
And if you fight back they put a hole in your chest
(Woop!) They both ride horses
After 400 years, I've got no choices
The police them have a likkle gun
So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one
(Woop-woop!) I hear it all day
Just so they can run the light and be upon their way
[Break]
Yes indeed
Yes indeed
Yes indeed
Yes indeed

[Chorus]
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast

[Verse 3]
Check out the message in a rough stylee
The real criminal are the C-O-P
You check for undercover and the one P.D
But just a mere Black man, them wan' check me
Them check out me car, for it shine like the sun
But them jealous or them vexed, ‘cause them can't afford one
Black people still slaves up 'til today
But the Black police officer nyah see it that way
Him want a salary, him want it
So he put on a badge and kill people for it
My grandfather had to deal with the cops
My great-grandfather dealt with the cops
My great-grandfather had to deal with the cops
And then my great, great, great, great—when it's gonna stop?!
[Chorus]
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast

[Break]
Yes indeed
Yes indeed
Yes indeed
Yes indeed

[Chorus]
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police

Touch It,Pusha T,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: Kanye West]
I'ma need you to touch it, touch it, touch it

Can you just touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Please, pretty please
I just wanna see you down on your pretty knees
Or maybe you could touch it, see where it leads
Go 'head, just beat it like you was Billy Jean
You grown and you sexy, you following the fiend
That coconut Ciroc, see that's all we really need
You in college now, so you too old to tease
I hoping you can polish like Pledge what I need
And I ain't being selfish, we can't call it greed
Cause I return the favor like playing to the screen
I'm moving too fast, cause just when I believe
You came to shut it down like Drake and the Dream

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I need you to touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
Could you please touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
[Verse 2]
Yeah, she claiming that she didn't know
How to kiss it like she standing under miseltoe
My love game got you feeling so official though
I let you referee, just let your whistle blow
I'm never out of bounds, I'm on a higher ground
I'm never empty handed, coming from out of town
The Commes Des Garcons, the Christian Louboutin
The J Brand jeans look like you drew 'em on
I don't deny it, baby I just buy it
Once I get the mood right, maybe you should try it
Alas, I'm past on my past
I ran like the flash and I saved the best for last

I'ma need you to touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
Can you just touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something

[Verse 3]
See we can take it slow, or we can take it there
I'm thinking lap dance and you should take a chair
We both give a little, we just play it fair
You see this back and forth, for me it's kinda rare
Put out cards on the table, let's play truth or dare
Let your hair down, I don’t have you pegged as a square
Just let loose as you ride in that ruthless
You my new girl, you allowed to give me goose neck
We don't give a damn, who's watching
Me slowing down, not an option
And the buck hair's waving in the wind
You are such a champ how you take it on the chin
[Chorus: Kanye West]
I'ma need you to touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
Can you just touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something"

What you talkin' 'bout? It's L-O

Big ups to all my haters!

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Guard your woman dawg or I'll take her
You'll hear her scream from College Park to Decatur
I was a snotty nose with no paper
Now my crib sittin on twenty-two acres
Get it right fool, I gets money (yep)
If you think Luda's not filthy, you's a dummy (yep)
I was allergic to the roof on the cutty
So I took the top off like a Playboy Bunny
Catch me pimpin in a robe and some slippers
Riding down 85 while I'm stunting on my Gixxer
Mouth full of Swishers or riding with your sister
And six David Beckhams or a trunk full of kickers
Take a picture of the mister, it'll last long
And these haters get stretched out like a bad thong
So partner mash on or get mashed up
Think you can fuck with Luda then put a million of your cash up, hi!

Went from two ounces to a Maserati
First rap check, bought choppers for everybody
Before they know what's under my shirt, the Glock 40
Get 25 a show, next month I want 40
Born a real nigga, but I'ma die a goon
Just bought a new chopper, gon' use it real soon
Got the streets on lock homie, I can't lose
Put me anywhere, I'm the realest nigga in the room
Take a look at me, I'm what you call street approved
Got a lot haters, but even more tools

Feet hanging out the window, jock my shoe game

Anyway back to me cause this is who it's about

Where these niggas don't exist in the hood
Because it's filled with real motherfuckers like it should
As about New York I rep the Double B

So ask me why-why, but I feel that God owe me my life
For the things he did, but I turn my pleasure into sin
Blazed out sheddin' tattoed tears

[Chorus: 2Pac + Young Noble]
I said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Outlaw)
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears; now, I
Said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears

[Verse 4: Kadafi]
Shit.. ain't no unity in my community it's do or die
Seein my opprunities through these bars of hell while gettin' high
As life replays like time; underhanded schemes
To get that cream and thangs while livin this life of crime
My enemies want me squeezed
They get dumped like 3's, with 57 wasted at they knees
Please beware we thugs revolution size
Criminals dare be last mental me intitutionalize
Locked down, got many shell shocked, now
Holdin' down fort like I'm stuck in court cell block style

[Verse 5: Kastro]
Yo I been losin' sleep, stay awake way past late
Visions of killers en masse at the blast mayne
As I lay here gatted down and tatted
Knowing now it's hard to slow down for a addict
It's been years of stugglin, guzzlin beers
Beefin' and never even, ain't no love in the air
And I suffer my shit in hell, talking to the heavens
Walking thru the valley of death with my fellas
I lost a lot, starting with hope I tried
And for every tattoo I got a moment I cried
I'm thru with the lies, the two in my eyes, yell pain
Step in my shoes, nothing to lose, but my brain
I'mma hold it down tho', with all the struggle to bear
Ain't nothing to fear, crying these tattooed tears (haha)
Come on...

[Chorus: 2Pac + Young Noble]
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears (Oh my)
And I said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Haha)
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears (Baby)
I said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears"

[Verse 1]
I thought I hit rock bottom, they ban my album, point the finga
I guess nobody loves a real nigga-slash-rap singer
I thought I'd bring a little truth to the young troops
I brought proof that the niggas need guns too
It's not to be a racist, but let's face this
Wouldn't you if we could trade places?
I got lynched by some crooked cops, and to this day
Them same motherfuckers on the beat gettin' major pay
But when I get my check they takin' tax out
So, we payin' for these pigs to knock the blacks out
Ain't that a bitch, some officers are gettin' rich
Whoopin' on thugs and robbin' drug dealers for they shit
As far as jealousy, bein' a celebrity
No matter who committed the crime, they all yell at me
And the media is greedier than most
You could sell 'em your soul or they'll be on ya til a nigga's ghost
And everyday I read the paper there's another lie
They show my picture for the crimes of another guy
Now how's that for the life of a big shot
A dead cop, a lawsuit, a little kid shot
I play them nuttin' ass marks in the park
For tryin' to earn they stripes in the dark
Just 'cause I come there, don't mean I'm from there, peep
Only jealous motherfuckers beef, and point the finga

As I run up on em madman, a nutcase with a screw loose
A zoot troupe full of foolies with toolies
Niggas run to me don't come to me with beef
Take your jewels and your jeep, boom boom! Let that ass sleep
It's gettin' hectic, niggas run, quick
Buckshots are the payback for dumb shit
All you niggas on the block tryin to test me
Best wear a vest or get open like, sesame
I'll run up on you mad deep; while you're tryin' to sleep
I'm steady pumpin' bullets in your sheets
Wake up, motherfucker, don't stutter
Point blank by a nigga from the gutter, yeah!
Gimme mine, gimme mine, gimme, mine
Ban my rhymes, now It's back to bustin', nines
And bustaz can't get none, hell no
A quick flurry and he's buried with a swelled jaw
I came up from the amateurs to pro hits
At 5-0, so you know I take no shit
And everybody wants to kill a bringer
Of bad news, so they choose, to point the finga

One two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, til these motherfuckers kill me
I bring skills and I build, kill at will
Smoke sess til I'm ill, still feel me?
I say one two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, til these motherfuckers kill me
Pick it up, pick it up, give it up
Best to duck or get fucked for your bucks
Scream one two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, til these motherfuckers kill me
I can't give up, it's a black thang
And I ain't goin back to the crack game

Papaz Song,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: 2Pac]
Daddy's home...

Heh, so??
You say that like that means somethin' to me
You've been gone a mighty long motherfuckin' time
For you to be comin' home talkin' that ""daddy's home"" shit (nigga)
We been gettin' along fine just without you
Me, my brother, and my mother
So if you don't mind, you can step the FUCK off, POPS...FUCK YOU!

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Had to play catch by myself, what a sorry sight
A pitiful plight, so I pray, poor starry night
Please send me a pops before puberty
The things I wouldn't do to see a piece of family unity
Moms always work, I barely see her
I'm startin' to get worried without a pops I'll grow to be her
It's a wonder they don't understand kids today
So when I pray, I pray I'll never grow to be that way
And I hope that he answers me
I heard God don't like ugly, well take a look at my family
A different father every weekend
Before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends
I'm gettin' sick of all the friendships
As soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick
How can I be a man if there's no role model?
Strivin' to save my soul I stay cold drinkin' a forty bottle
I'm so sorry...
[Hook]
I'm so sorry
For all this time (I'm so sorry)
For all this time
For all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
For all this time (so, sorry)
For all this time
For all this time, so sorry baby!

[Verse 2: Wycked & 2Pac]
Moms had to entertain many men
Didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again
I'm gettin' a bit older and I'm startin' to be a bother
Moms can't stand me cause I'm lookin' like my father
Should I stay or run away? Tell me the answer
Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer
Grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff
Moms was tough 'cause his papa wasn't man enough
Couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities
Instead of takin' care of me, he'd rather live lavishly
That's why I'll never be a father
Unless you got the time it's a crime; don't even bother
That's when I started hatin' the phony smiles
Said I was an only child
Look at mama's lonely smile!
It's hard for a son to see his mother cry
She only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys
I'm so sorry...
[Hook]
I'm so sorry
For all this time (I'm so sorry)
For all this time
For all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
For all this time (so, sorry)
For all this time
For all this time, so sorry baby!

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Man child in the promised land couldn't afford many heroes
Moms was the only one there, my pops was a no-show
And oh, I guess ya didn't know
That I would grow to be so strong
Lookin' kinda pale, was it the ale or pops was wrong?
Where was the money that you said, you would send me
Talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly
Asking 'bout school and my welfare
But it's clear, you ain't sincere, hey who the hell cares
You think I'm blind but this time I see you comin', Jack!
You grabbed your coat, left us broke, now ain't no runnin' back
Asking 'bout my moms like you loved her from the start
Left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart
So don't even start with that ""Wanna be a father"" shit
Don't even bother with your dollars I don't need it
I'll bury moms like you left me: all alone, G
Now that I finally found you, stay the fuck away from me
You're so sorry
[Hook]
I'm so sorry
For all this time (I'm so sorry)
For all this time
For all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
For all this time (so, sorry)
For all this time
For all this time, so sorry baby!

[Verse 4: 2Pac - impersonating his father]
I never meant to leave but I was wanted
Crossed too many people every house I'd touch was haunted
Had to watch the strangers every brother was a danger
If I wanted to to keep you breathin', had to be out of range-a
Had to move on, done lost my name and picked a number
Made me watch my back I had no happy home to run to
Maybe it's my fault for being a father livin' fast
But livin' slow, mean half the dough, and you won't get no ass
Hindsight shows me it was wrong all along
I wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong
It took a little longer than I thought
I slipped, got caught, and sent to jail by the courts
Now I'm doin' time and I wish you'd understand
All I ever wanted was for you to be a man
And grow to be the titan you was meant to be
Keep the war fightin' by the writings that you sent to me
I'm so sorry...

[Hook]
I'm so sorry
For all this time (I'm so sorry)
For all this time
For all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
For all this time (so, sorry)
For all this time
For all this time, so sorry baby!"
Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Yo, law
Is it cool if a nigga just get fucked up for this one?
Yeah, Mr. Fuck-a-Cop is back
And I still don't give a fuck, yaknahmsayin'?
Puffin' on this indo (Guess who's back)
In the studio with my partners out here  (Guess who's back)
Pacific Heights in the house  (Guess who's back), know what I mean?
(And madder than motherfucker)

[Verse 1]
I was framed, so don't make the same mistake, nigga
You gotta learn how to shake the snakes, nigga
'Cause the police love to break a nigga
Send 'em upstate 'cause they straight-up hate the niggas
So what I do is get a crew of zoo niggas
Straight fools into rules and do niggas
And one-time had enough of me
I'm still raw so the law can't fuck with me
They wanna send me to the pen', punk, picture that
I stay strapped, motherfuckers better get your gat
It ain't easy bein' me, I can't take it
Life as a celebrity ain't everything they make it
And ever since the movies these hoes try to do me
If they can't screw me, they find a way to sue me
Now can you picture me coolin' at a night club?
Nothin' but love, but motherfuckers wanna mean mug
Since I wear a lot of gold, they plot
Don't know what I got and get shot with the hot ones
And, aw yeah, I wanna feel guilty
But you punk motherfuckers tried to milk me
You'll get smacked behind the ear with my phone or my pager
It's beepin' while I cut you with my razor
I'm not violent, I'm petrified and nervous
I got no mercy for these niggas tryin' to serve us
But if you catch me outta pocket, then I'm got
You love to shoot a nigga but you scared to pop a cop
Now drop it
[Chorus]
Strictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my niggas, makin' G's

[Verse 2]
Reflected and disrespected, plus I'm rejected
You're just another rapper, who swears he's makin' records
That's what they said whenever I would walk by
I never tripped though, always kept my head up high
Eventually I knew that I would find my way
After the darkest night always comes a brighter day
And some would say, that turned away is all you'll get
I just said ""Bet!,"" and never let 'em see me sweat
'Cause in the end, I knew that I would have it all
While non-believers were prayin' for my downfall
And some would call and tell me that they wish me well
But in my heart, I'm knowin' that they wish me hell
Yo, get a real job, rappin' doesn't pay the rent
I hit the studio, 'cause that's where all my money went
Never surrender, it's all about the faith you've got
Don't ever stop, just push it 'til you hit the top
And if you drop, at least you know you gave your all
Be true to you, and that way you can never fall
But beware, these backstabbers ain't no joke
Just like a rope, they hang on you until you're broke
And when you're broke, they move onto the next dope
And there you are, can't even pay your car note
And when you reminisce, thinkin' how you got dissed
Remember how it felt and then remember this
Be true to you, believe that there's no one bigger
'Cause they can all suck dick, it's strictly for my niggas
[Chorus]
Strictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my niggas, makin' G's

[Verse 3]
This is for the critics if you live up
Pick up my shit or I'll be back doin' stick-ups
I better see five stars next to my picture
If not, 2Pac will cop the Glock and come knockin' to getcha
I told you once, motherfucker, I'm a nut
Play me like a butt and you'll be bleedin' when you're fucked
Niggas know what's up but they be tryin' to hold me down
I'm comin' outta Oaktown, bitch fuck around
And it ain't where you from that makes you hardcore, nigga
It's the way you throw them thangs in the war
And to the marks that be talkin' all that shit
Screamin' out the next nigga's name like a bitch
And the niggas that I ran into recently
The motherfuckers at the club that pulled the piece on me
You little bitches shoulda pulled the fuckin' trigger
Now you live in fear of a heartless-ass nigga
Mr. Troublesome, niggas tried to play me with the gat
But like Terminator, nigga, I'll be back
Yeah, and I'll be back with a fuckin' army
You tried to harm me, ring the alarm, G
'Cause most motherfuckers love to act up, without they backup
When they get jacked up, they crack up
It's strictly for my niggas at the show
So they know, not to play me like a ho
Strictly for my

Won’t be a day that Maurice don’t stand up

Now, I'm up in this bitch, they light up like independance day
When you around the real, you keep it real everyday
My niggas keep it real, so I hear what they say
Either you gettin' paid or you payin' to play
Either you on your grind or you stay out the way

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
A lotta shit done changed
New clothes, new car, new thangs
The same boys that used to be at the bottom came up
That’s what they say
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the roof top
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the roof top
[Verse 3: Curren$y]
Just made a million, got another million on my schedule
The pick up on my Ferrari, you jets or you jetless
You niggas ain't help us, on second thoughts you did
They hatin' was the fuel for this shit
So you wrote your own check off a ho ass
Sweatin' bullets at home, wonderin' if she comin' back
Whodi you a simp and she can smell it on ya
That's why you only see her when you buyin' stuff for her
We was sneakin' in then it was general admission
Now we own the arena decidin' who allowed in it
My windows ain't tinted, pimpin', I ain't trippin'
Had showered that shit, I'm just ballin' and chillin'
We plotted this out, one night in the city
Now we Los Angeles, medicine cabinet twistin'
Our habits are expensive, we gotta have it
TwitPicin' when we get it and they mad at us, fuck them niggas

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
A lotta shit done changed
New clothes, new car, new thangs
The same boys that used to be at the bottom came up
That’s what they say
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the rooftop
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the rooftop

She got service road curves, and highway eyes
The road to her soul, just follow the road signs
And holla if you hear me, I love it when she's near me
I hate when she's away, and Satan'll see the day
That Hell freeze over before I let her go
And let one of you bitch niggas get her, no, no, no
You don't know how to treat her
You don't know that I need her, hey
Do you know that I need ya?

Of 3rd Ward, bone hard, street veteran
And it all started in '93
High school, he was a fool, he was only 18
With the dreams of becoming a ghetto superstar
Rollin' in foreign cars through the streets of 3rd Ward
It was all momma leave 'em with, a trace of Mo-E
And promethazine, now he the codeine fiend
And his team was the coldest, every day they rolled thick
Niggas and hoes on dick cause that's that Screwed Up Clique
The Barre Baby, the Barre Baby

Sippin' on some drank the color purple like Celie
Really, they say I should chill before it kills me
But so will a car crash or a nine milli (That's true)
And I ain't even mention cigarettes or airplanes
So grab a Sprite, here's a pint we can share, Wayne
Yeah mayne, tastes so sweet
And I ain't gonna have a seat cause I don't wanna fall asleep
So just pour it in my drink and I'ma sip until I lean hard
Drank got me moving slower than a retard
So press record, and hear these hot raps (You know I got 'em)
I'm in the booth, cup on me like a jock-strap (I ain't lying)
And I will not nap until the bottle's empty
Then I pour a little more for Pat, Screw and Pimp C (Rest in peace)
And I would stop but believe that I can't

This is the finish my friend, this is the end
It's a revolution it's a civilian revenge
There's no need to move or adjust your television
Whenever an era dies, another era begins
These American fights, these American wars
These American stripes, these American stars
But these American cages have American bars
We hunger for truth so we headed for y'all
Towers are crumbling, bridges are falling
Limits are fading, the normal is boring
Looking at time move progressively forward
Looking the days just vanish before me
You wanted a Benz but you couldn't afford it
Now you would kill to put your foot in a Taurus
It's a different of madness and never look backwards
But this is the crisis, prepare for disaster

Freaks Come Out At Night,Whodini,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: Jalil/ Ecstasy]
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
(the freaks come out)
The freaks come out at night

[Verse 1 : Ecstasy]
Discos don't open till after dark
And it ain't till twelve till the party really starts
And I always had to be home by ten
Right before the fun was about to begin
Crowds of people lined up inside and out
Just one reason, to rock the house
But in the day time the streets were clear
You couldn't find a good freak anywhere, cause

[Hook: Jalil/ Ecstasy]
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
(the freaks come out)
The freaks come out at night
[Verse 2 : Jalil]
Now when freaks get dressed to go out at night
They like to wear leather jackets, chains and spikes
They wear rips and zippers all in their shirts
Real tight pants and fresh mini skirts
All kinds of colors runnin' through their hair
And you could just about spot a freak anywhere
But then again, you could know someone all their life
But might not know they're a freak unless you see them at night, cause

[Hook: Jalil/ Ecstasy]
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
(the freaks come out)
The freaks come out at night

[Verse 3 : Ecstasy]
Now the party's jumpin', the place is packed
And when the crowd's like this, I'm ready to rap
But before I could bust a rhyme on the mic
Freaks are all over me like white on rice
Freaks come in all shapes, sizes and colors
But what I like about 'em most is that they're real good lovers
They do it in the park, they do it in the dark
But most freaks are known for breakin' hearts
You could never tell what a freak was thinkin' of
And you may never catch a freak without at least one glove
And they don't walk, when they step, they strut
And nine times out of ten they drive you nuts
But take my advice, you don't stand a chance
Freaks are so bad they got their own dance
So if you wanna live a nice quiet life
Do yourself a favor, don't come out at night, cause
[Hook: Jalil/ Ecstasy]
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night

Mayday,Flobots,"['alternative', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Born in the flood, bloody fingerpaint sets
Black marketed, fresh water cannons forget me not
Epitaph airbrushed with death
White tees, wife beaters
Button up, reattach flesh!

[Verse 1: Jonny 5 and (Brer Rabbit)]
In between the lines (In between the lines)
Outside of the law (Outside of the law)
Underneath the veil (Underneath the veil)
We dig our foundations (We navigate the globe)
Trying to find a pattern to break the mold (Pattern to break the mold)
With a family to feed (Family to feed)
There's nowhere we won't go

But what if we're caught
They say I'm a snitch
Shot at the checkpoint
Found with his throat slit
There's spray paint on the teleprompter
Anchorman screams that he's seen a monster (Mayday)
There's bloodstains on his shirt (Mayday)
They say that he's gone berserk!
[Verse 2]
Sometimes when I wanna shut out this world
Want to rip up this page
Want to pour out this heart
Want to get up on this stage
And my lips become percussion
And my fists become the rage
And I pound on this table
'Til it gives me something to say
Then I think about things that I've seen
Right in front of me that I don't wanna believe
Gimme one of these mics
Let me let 'em know: the way that
It is is not how it's gonna be
Not if we don't let 'em get ahead of us
The present tension's no threat
It's just a fence across the path
That we're already ready to walk
Rock solid footsteps
Let 'em put up obstacles
And prove that it isn't possible
​Fuck​ that! We don't give 'em any weight
True liberty and freedom's at stake
Peace will never become passé
Live my life until my last day
It was half-past eight in the Bat Cave
When the cracks in the plaster
Collapsed and gave way to gaps in the pavement
(Mayday, mayday) Put it on blast
For the passengers and messengers
Cause this is a disaster
Where the fuck are the rescue workers?
Not far, off pissing on a cop car
In the hall with a Pop Tart
Sipping liquor in the rock bar
Everyone climb to the frontline, lunchtime's cancelled
All hands on deck to pull survivors from the landfill
Onlookers, passers-by, brush off your shoulders
Shake off that rubble, break free from your standstill
[Hook 1]
Signs of a better world, causes we understand
Failures we expected to occur and bring redemption for our sins
Safety from the crowds
In the shadows on the run, we write our own Cider House
Rules to keep alive
Rituals that prove their worth
Search for systems we can trust
Rhythms we can lock into

[Verse 3: Brer Rabbit]
This is madness, salvage teams can't bandage
Hope when it's damaged or broken compassion
There's not enough rope in the van
When the world is collapsin', our mode of action
Broadcast through the glass, all we can manage
Donate with the plastic scrapped from the salad
Hopin' to balance, emotions invalidated
Staged on four-to-three aspects
Just ballast for sadness
Lives shattered are standard fare for
Cameras and channels stare no abracadabras
No faster answers or mantras for disasters
Remastered or plastered
We got it all backwards
Do you know the faction you're backin'?
It's another man down, another mother gone
Child drowned, another silent song
Solitude, another kind of strong
I miss you, another strung along
Missing in action
Another page is blackened
Burned, turned, ashes to ashes
Dust off the flags and the caskets
[Hook 2]
We will never find another you
Despite the life of love we knew
These lightning times are trouble, who
Can count the strikes that punish through?
The bonds we thought would never break
And never will, and never change
And never fade, but there's the rage
Of losing you to their mistakes!

[Verse 4: (Jonny 5) and Brer Rabbit]
(In between the lines) Signs of the next movement
(Refuge from the crowd) Outside of the law
(Causes we understand) Hands that trace
Instructions for descendants in the
Shadows on the run (Underneath the veil)
Failures we expected to occur
And bring redemption for our sins
(In between the lines) In between the lines

[Outro]
In between the lines, outside of the law
Underneath the veil
In between the lines, outside of the law
Underneath the veil
In between the lines, outside of the law
Underneath the veil, we carve our foundations
In between the lines, outside of the law
In between the lines"

Yo this is your boy Koncise here man im just sitting here thinking to myself you know how hard is it for someone to get signed you know what because im a thug you dont wanna show a brother love sign me watch the magic happen baby watch it yo

Verse 1:
When im on the mic
I feel like everything is alright
Though inside im losing my mind
Back to the streets
Rolling wit my piece
Only fear of being deceased
Is nobody hearing me speak
But because im real
They dont wanna give me that deal
And thats ok
I can find other ways
Of making my pay
Still i got some shit to say
So one more time
To the brothers out there doing time
To the brothers out there on the grind
Or looking to get signed
You can do it
Just stay true to it
Who'd of thought thuggin would lead me to it
Institutionalized in this life meaning i am used to it
Steady trying to make some chips
Find time to bump and grind wit a bomb bitch
If i was signed i'd probably be rich
To me that's just a bonus
My thoughts are to focus
Living my life in thuggish ways lookin out for the popo and there dope snitch
If we can find time to recline then we could smoke this
Listen to the words in this song as i approach this
I got some streetwise knowledge for y'all so i wrote this yeah
Chrous:
You should stay real
You can make em' feel
What you about
What you got
Stick wit your Glock
You can get to the top
As long as you just stick wit what you got come on

Verse 2:
Livin wit no fear
Feelin like only hope can get you there
Times are hard
Catching cases on the verge of life behind bars
Still thoughts running through your head
Of how you gonna get some bread
Just to feed your kid
Wondering if the sacrifices are worth it
This world is far from perfect
But if you just stay true
The real people will choose you
Thats why im breaking it down for you
Do what you gotta do just to get through
Find your spaceship
Survive this life you can take it
Stay real dont fake it
One day you will make it
Dont be nobody else
Use the cards you get dealt
Stand up and make your pressence felt
Stick wit what you got dont change yourself
Stay real come on
Chorus:
You should stay real
You can make em' feel
What you about
What you got
Stick wit your Glock
You can get to the top
As long as you just stick wit what you got come on

Verse 3:
If you wanna get what you after in this life
If you wanna be rich or if you just wanna get signed
Just take one day at a time
It'll come one time one day
You gon' get your pay
You gon' say what you came to say
Til that day comes
Keep doing that shit even if you gotta use guns
I ain't worried bout what you do on the block
As long as you respect me for what i got
Thats alright
Cause my futures clear in sight
Papanui born and raised
It's gon' be westside til my dying days
Lets get high take the pain away
Stay real stay true today
Yo
Chorus:
You should stay real
You can make em' feel
What you about

Stick wit your Glock

Hold up, your mouth is dry, don't worry, water mops it

I get her to pop a pill, and come and fuck the set
And I fucking rep!

Singles double when triple-beams take over
Now holler 'cause these Impalas got extreme makeovers (Woo!)
Couches covered in plastic, babies all in the street now
Wear the wrong color, catch a Rodney King beatdown
Kids hit with switches, mamas is quotin' scriptures
While Luda's getting head, more gums than baby pictures (Woo!)
Cock my .40 Glock and my partner just bought a replica

Welcome to my hood
Where board members and faculty backin' me
If you ever try attackin' me
That could be when I eat 'em, especially when I beat 'em
When they see a bunch of killas and hustlas on the side of me
I'm an anomaly to 'em, put 'em on crutches
With succulent verses, I'm just the one that's kicking the ruckus
Munch as I smoke a Dutchess, and model bitches that cut us
And motherfuckers that love us, and enemies wanna touch us
I'ma spit a flow as if it was a sin (Haha, what!)
Then the gangstas are resting up forever (Ah...)
See a silent four-, put it on the fin (What!)
Then you know to never test him
It'll be a category F5 (Ayyy)

Love to the Hundreds, and everybody that runnin' them north
And the whole city, and I'm from the westside (Wan', today)

Welcome to the gully where we no take bad up
Big spliff in ah mi hand (Haha) and Hennessy in ah mi cup
You see the gyaldem we have up is like some angels abduct

Good coke, hard rock, stashed in the body shop
Only way to break them bricks down is karate chops
Niggas gettin' left right in front of the Marble precinct
Leave 'em like them Jordans, red-dot, leakin'
I'm fifteen when I first startin' coppin' pies
You 46 just turnin' Blood? Stop it, Five
It's like the only way to make it is supplyin' things
Hoop dreams, dunkin' over cars, let the choir sing

[Verse 10: Game]
Yo, it’s that black raw, black dawg
Pullin' up on that black Hog
Compton, that's my backyard
That's where I used to get them sacks off
But now I got platinum plaques in the back of the 'Bach
And I'm back with Dre again
Aftermath, We The Best, me and Khaled, Dre and Em
Detox, RED, that's back to the back
Step in the club with my hat to the back
Nigga, I'm so hood even though I'm living good
Niggas still in the VIP strapped with a gat
Drop a couple stacks, then, it's back to the trap
Couple hoes in the back, red wheels on the 'Lac
REDRUM if you try it; nigga, it's Westside!
Throw it up! Now!

Well, everybody walkin' with they hand on they steel
And the model is a supply and demand, and at will
You been outta line with the wrong man and get killed
When you damned if you will, damned if you won't
Lot of dudes sayin' that they can, but they don't
And a lot of boys sayin' that they Gs, but they ain't
Mess around, get laid down in the paint
Better do what you say, say what you do
'Fore I come around your hood, broad day, with the crew
They got them FNs, ARs and Ks with 'em, too
And they will gladiate all day, what it do! (what it do)
R.I.P. to the trillest that did it
To my Gs on lockdown, acquitted
Stick with it, think I'ma stop reppin' PAT, forget it
RIVERDALE! Waka! Flocka! Waka! Flocka!

Welcome to Clayton County (Ugh! Ugh!)
My house got surrounded (Ugh! Ugh! Flocka!)
Enemies tryna drown me
But my hood still around me (RIVERDALE!)
Rookie of the year (Yeah!), no Freshmen cover
Shawty 16 years old, with four baby mothers (Flocka!)
First rapper ever to jump off the stage on BET (Uh-huh)
And since Pac go to Hollywood to keep it street (Ugh!)
First Woo to put T. Rodgers on the TV (Flocka!)

Sippin’ yac while I elevate my mind state
Hand by the burner in case a nigga try to violate
Never going down, stay rising like Andre
Cause my corner back every thing the don say
Long Beach, yeah I yell it out in every song
Err’y day, err’y night till I’m carried home
Forever known, big ballin’, try it in the city
Then yelling out swish way before it in the net
And I ain't knocking a niggas hustle, it’s all a game
And when they mention the best, will they call your name?
There's only winners and losers, ain't no in between
You either hit the hall of fame or you fall to shame
And you ain't got to wonder where my place at
Pepsi blue rags sorta poppin, bitch taste that
One hit of the bong will blow ya face back
LMFAO to the bank, boy, ASAP

I do it cause I feel it
Live it like I’m talkin’
Flow so straight but won't a nigga try and walk in it
I’m so high, yeah the weed, I’m still sparking it
My bitch bad and my diamonds still sparkling
Got the competition shaking like parkinsons
Bread's in the bag, call it good marketing
Life’s a bitch but I don’t cartigan
Thats what a word to the third letter
Shots, shots, shots to me and my cheddar
Run these emcee’s I’m tougher than leather
Vietnemese eyes tighter than ever
Fuck with the Dogg I’m biting whomever
Cause I don came from a long path
Only God knows how long the Dogg has
Cause like time we all pass
So if you ever taste success, just pray it’s from a tall glass

And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery, Get away from me loneliness
Get away from me fake bitches, I can’t take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks, I can only make only hits
I’m an only child lost in the World
Where did the lonely kids, go when the bell rings
It's feeling like hell rings
It's bringing me back down, he's checking my background
Its ironic what's happening, imagine if I didn’t have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I’m spaced out, dawg, I be on that Moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moonwalk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we ain’t finna change, so we won’t agree again
Till then I’ll be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed

[Hook: John Legend]
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground

They fear the ruffneck niggas with the lunatic behavior

Stabbin for a fee, it gets hard on the fuckin streets
It's like a madness, fuck making gravy
I rhyme and do crimes, 'cause either way pays me
A little rough with a hardcore...theme
Couldn't rough something rougher in your...dreams
Mad rugged so you know we're gonna ... rip
With that roughneck nigga named 2Pacalypse
Representing YG'z yo

I thought about bumpin, but motherfuck jugglin
I know it lasts longer, gets my pockets thicker
But I'd rather use my gun 'cause I get the money quicker, so bust it
Look as I cut the records hard to eject
A quick clip threw my body down, uhh! It's another hit
I got energy to blast now you want the task here
'Cause of the light a motherfucker shot that ass up
But rugged and rough is how I'm steppin
Mac is the weapon, and it's always kept in
Eye on the Mac 'cause the dogg got it goin on
If you come up steppin you'll be lit like a hick
So you better chill, 'cause I got too much money to get
A street thug in the motherfuckin house, I'm strugglin
Get drunk but I don't think
I'm just in it for the money, don't be a punk snitch
When I yank up my gun, don't run don't bitch

You'll get your stupid ass blown out the frame

Ain't nothin changed, set it off, I let the brains hang
Guess who's back to put niggas on they back
Till I [?], niggas running free better fall back
I'm fifty niggas deep, beat sleep
With a Mossberg wrapped in my sheets
Three deep in my Jeep chief run with the Young Gunz
Strugglin and strivin, that's how the dough come
Now get gunned by the one with the gun for the low goal
Throw a bolo so low when I flow yo
Much too high to read the signs, I'm blind
Clickin on the nine, out to get mine
I go big up, big up, gotta make the room, boom
Blowin motherfuckers to the moon

My mind made up, unnecessary lay-ups
You can still win, ain't got a rich or star player
Fuck a hater, still remain a, self made nigga
Live bigger, credit cards, no limits

I don’t shop online, those are all gimmicks
Only make moves when your heart's in it

Standin' on the trunk rooftop, view the city
Batman spotlight, gotta save you bitches
Joke's on you, Jack
Who the fuck you gon' call when your shit towed, by the repo?
Can’t tell your girl, so she the centerfold
Now you gettin' played like Casios
Uh, casino’s, C-notes and chips like Frito’s
Got a free coat when Costa Rico
Most hoes only know two words
Like, ""Gimme those"", still buy 'em though
Currently ballin’ so I gotta let ya know
Flash through the tint, roll the window, tilt the brim

Diss me cause they hungry
Made a meal that you couldn’t eat

Of course I kick doors for white whores
But my wife mary-jane I never get divorced
Cause she be tha only one fit for a playa
The green eyes and the pretty red hair
The hoes sick cause them jelous bitches wanna
Baila como Juana, Maria-Juana
You was born in Mexico but I took the chance
And brought your ass across to the promise lands
I love to lay you down so soft in my swisha
Act like a freak and let all my niggas hit ya
I got your picture on all my walls
Mama caught us kissin wanna call the laws
My family thinks you nothin but trouble
Can't see how you helped me through the struggle

Oh let the mary-go-round, pass the sweet

Oh let the mary-go-round, pass the sweet"

[Verse 1]
Ok not a moment to waste, taste the hunger on my breath
I heard somewhere that stress was bad for my health
I ain't dead yet, pathetic maybe, my girl shady
Say I ain't stable, so she don't wanna have my baby
It's kinda crazy, Indeed she feels he'll be
A mothafuckin' threat like me, why not? I ain't that bad
My playa pizzazz was good enough to flip, smack and fuck her ass
But I think I'll pass on the goo goos and gah gahs
Rather fuck hoes that shake they ass like maracas
I think, she think I'm no good, got it from her mama
She always starting some shit, I think that bitch is drama
We never get along 'til I'm pulling on her thong
While I'm digging in her skin, ask me ""why I do her wrong?""
C'mon love let's do it one more time
You bound to get yours so I gots to get mine
Sing her a lullaby in the sheets, so that ass can go to sleep
While I plot and creep on paying rent this week
Might have to slang some dick to this lonely chick
Got a Benz, kinda fat, but she got big tits
(chorus)
I ain't shit
I think they wanna see me fail, laid out, played out fulla shells
Man I ain't shit
I'm hollering fuck a job for real, I think I might rob and steal
Man I ain't shit
Shawty homegirl like ""leave that dude,"" why she trippin'? I fucked her too
Man I ain't shit
I'm out here on my last dime, I think I play Xbox to pass time
I ain't shit

[Verse 2]
All I got is dreams of cream and mad green
Smoke 'til I pass out, live life supreme
Cartier frame Polo no stain
Still keep that heater underneath the woodgrain
Puerto Rican mamis that massage my body
Feed me fruit, suck me off in groups, call me papi
I was playa loungin', champagne drinkin'
Another hour woke up, fuck wishful thinking
Eyes full of crust, roll the blunt, shower up
Burn it down, what now call my nigga Buck
Asked him ""What's the move?"", Tell me what's the play?
I'm dowm for the caper just tell me where they stay
The ski mask way, never beg a borrow
If it go good today do the same shit tomorrow
For real, Fuck what you think that's how it is
Plotting on robbing niggas while I'm watching Cribs, I ain't shit!"

2 Weak,K.Flay,"['alternative', 'hip hop', 'r&b', 'blues', 'jazz', 'pop']","Plates stacked high, stress keeps piling
We don’t even talk, I hate the silence
And I’ve been feeling like an island
Blinded, trapped in the middle of my mind
I’m in a state of disarray
Aimed for a bang, but I went astray
Got amends to make wish I could end today
Regret in my heart plus the rent to pay
I can’t sleep
Lungs collapse so I can’t breathe
Face the past, no not for me
Forget about a friend my company’s my misery
And we’re happily living in a box
About to collapse like jenga blocks
Holes widen in my socks as I watch the clock
And just pray to the sky for the time to stop

Trying to find a way to make up for my indiscretions
Watched you fall apart so you would think I learned my lesson
Imagine that you magically appear
But I’ve been looking you’re not here
I'm too weak to be strong for you
I’m too weak, baby
Late last night cried in bed
Need to turn off my head
It’s been on overdrive
Feel like shit, no surprise
Suppose that I should open up
But I hide from the truth like most of us
Keep the deceased too close to us
Rules of the game just so unjust
Wish that my dad could be seeing this
Wish he wasn’t cursed with the beast
Wish he didn’t treat every bottle like a secret
Wish in an another world he’d say I quit and he’d mean it
And I need to be locking my thoughts up
Wanna be wonderbread, but I feel like matzah
The cost of living right on the brink
Got time to waste but no time to think

Trying to find a way to make up for my indiscretions
Watched you fall apart so you would think I learned my lesson
Imagine that you magically appear
But I’ve been looking, you’re not here
I'm too weak to be strong for you
I’m too weak, baby

Inevitable it’d be this way
Stuck in a role and it’s on replay
Following the lines in my palms
Thinking to myself where did I go wrong?
Where did we go right where did you go I’m just trying
To get some kind of grip on this grand design
And the answer I get the sense that it’s senseless
Said I wish you left but I never really meant it
And now I’m upended
Energy all spent
Feeding my hunger to be torn asunder
And still I keep wondering why
Night after night I wake in a cold sweat
I’m 24, not even old yet
Afraid to move forward but taped up the rear view
Scared of what it means to be near you
I, I wanna be, be somebody
Someone golden
I, I wanna see, see underneath
Every ocean"

Yeah, 100 percent independent, I'm the fuckin' boss
I sold eighty thousands of a quotable in The Source
The hood is not stupid, we know the mathematics
I made double what I would going gold on Atlantic
Cause EMI, Sony BMG, Interscope
Would never sign a rapper with the White House in his scope
They push pop music like a religion
Anorexic celebrity driven financial fantasy fiction
Contradiction cause the life we was given resembles life in prison
Fed time with Manuel Noriega
The real Noriega, who did America 100 favors
With Contras, the Shah and the CIA
Movin Escobar's coke through the M-I-A
This is +The 3rd World+ speakin, through a dead man walkin
And everybody talkin 'bout the South takin over
It's true motherfucker, but it's comin over the border
Fuck your chain, my people'll kill you for water
Fuck fans nigga, I got soldier supporters
That'll cut your throat if you strapped with a tape recorder
That's right motherfucker, welcome to the New World Order
Where the truth is always censored by corporate reporters
The government, runs the drug politics on the corner
That's why I never stress rappers and their employers
I put a bag over his fuckin head and torture your lawyer
Cause it's too simple to shoot ya - I'll taser the roof of
Your mouth and electrocute ya, I'll root you out with the Ruger
The German Luger, U-boat, and the troops in the scuba
Nigga you can't overthrow me like the island of Cuba!
Niggas'll never find your body, like the bitch in Aruba
And I maneuver through the state department and their friends
With secret deals like the Nazis and IBM
And now you know this ain't a trend or a fashion
This is my life and my passion, fuck tryin' to cash in, nigga!
I need more than advancements and a rented mansion
So while you little house niggas is singin and dancin
I'll kill you and take your land like an Israeli expansion

I'm just riding through the valley on my bicycle
Just pedalin' pedalin' pedalin' pedalin' pedalin' along
I'm heading to the studio by Sherman and Coldwater
And when I get there I'm gonna sing this song

[Hook]
I'm gonna sing oh yeah, oh-my-my
I don't give a fuck about a DUI
You can take away my license
But you can't take away my pride
I'm singing oh yeah, Oh-my-my
I'm a keep drinking until the day I die
Two wheels is the way I ride

[Verse 1]
I got my backpack strapped on my back real tight
Inside of it got a cord and a mic
And a couple tall cans, coors and bud light
That I found in my refrigerator drawer from the night before
I take flight out the door with my bike
Its such a californian sight
Small breeze got the palm trees swaying back and forth in the light
Melodies in my head im gonna record em' tonight man
I start pedalin' I start smilin'
I'm in the bike lane freestylin'
I make a quick pit stop on the corner
To pet a little dog and chat with its owner
It's the type of day you just can't feel bad
The same type of day Ice Cube once had
Trying to make it to the lab but I don't pedal fast
I sit back and watch as the rose pedals pass
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Cruising down Sherman a couple blocks left
Rhymes in my head and they're all kinda' deaf
Man, I can't wait to lay em down but my first venture
Is to the store for a couple more thirst quenchers
I pick em up and then add them to the contents
Of my heavy ass bag then I paddle fast no nonsense
Hit the studio with no delayin'
I give a dap to my homie Bailey on the way in
I start drinkin' I start recordin'
Three hours later I'm out the damn door again
Gotta pedal to the store again
I'm feeling festive this require captain morgan
Another bike ride, staring at a night sky
Trying not to swerve as the cars fly right by
I stay fresh like fucking bag salad
And I don't give a damn if my license ain't valid

I let you slide in my home, you was safe
I thought my ability to provide you stability
Was what was really G, okay silly me (silly me)
I was Billy Dee, smooth cat but really street
Really she attract niggas like the +A Milli+ beat
And I happen to rap but somethin 'bout this beat strange
Soon as I try to flow with it, the beat change
Never thought she change (never)
But what you thinks a upgrade really just could be a seat change
Love changes

I miss the cool nights sittin in the Carlo
Now it's like ""boooo"" we sittin in Apollo
It used to be all good, then shit just went malo
And that's bad, matter fact that's sad
Cause when you lose a friend it's hard to handle the loss
They do some bitch shit, gotta give ya man a divorce
End up watchin ""Friends"" like Joey, Chandler and Ross
Ya see, most of these niggas ain't never love 'em (never love 'em)
And these bitches just think whatever of 'em (whatever of 'em)
So maybe playin dumb was kinda clever of 'em

Now of course I want peace on the streets, but realistically
Paintin' perfect pictures ain't never worked, my misery
Was so deep, couldn't sleep through all my pressures
In my quest for cash I learned fast, usin' violent measures
Memories of adolescent years, there was unity
But after puberty, we brought war to our community
So many bodies droppin', it's gotta stop, I wanna help
But still I'm steppin', keep my weapon, must protect myself
The promise of a better tomorrow ain't never reached me
Plus my teachers was too petrified in class to teach me
Sippin' Thunderbird and grape Kool-Aid, callin' Earl
Since my stomach was empty it seduced me to fuck the world
Watch my lil' homies lose they childhoods to guns
Nobody cries no more, ‘cause we all die for fun
So why you ask me if I want peace if you can't grant it?
Niggas fightin' across the whole planet
So it could never be peace

[Hook: 2Pac]
Will there ever be peace, or are we all, just headed for doom?
Still consumed by the beast?
And I know there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
‘Cause there could never be peace
[Verse 2: Kastro]
Somebody owes me. Will they control me? Not
I ain't a hater player, but I want all you got
Y'all babies had babies, now we fightin' each other
My dawgs got frabies, they bitin' each other
And it ain't hard to find a friend like mine
Bigfully is a bullet and he don't mind dyin'
And I gotta be blind, missed sign after sign
Time after time after time after time
And I don't like nobody, they don't like me more
And I'm good with that finally, but they heard it before
Dawg, we livin' in a prison, losin' our religion
On Thanksgivin' we thankful, just for livin' in Hell
Damn, homie, I don't mean to be harsh
But there's a devil in the ghetto tryin' to tear it apart
And if we make it up out, we still stuck in the dark
Will there ever be peace? Just a piece of my heart. Never!

Thangs is changin', nigga, you better read the signs
I'm only concerned about me and mine in these times
The world is a ghetto and peace is not a part of it
We all believe God's new plan to make it out of this
Niggas spendin' too much time hatin' on each other
Niggas buyin' guns, loadin' 'em up, aimin' at each other
And the victim is you and me, it's sick, but it's true indeed
The good die, mostly over bullshit, repeatedly
Deep in me there's a part that wants nothing but love
But the rest of me know, war is what's waitin' for us
So I stays ready, keep my pay heavy and boss up
Stack my funds and my guns, never rely on luck
Askin' God to point out the impostor
Never let no weapon formed against me prosper
‘Cause there'll never be peace, so don't rely on it, soldiers dyin' for it, and in the ghetto, they cryin' for it. But fuck peace!

Why? ‘Cause I gotta be thuggin'

How the fuck can you have a childhood
And you at the funeral every motherfuckin' weekend?
Pssh, and you motherfuckers talkin' about peace?
Nigga, it ain't no motherfuckin' peace
You ain't seen the news motherfucker? You ain't heard? Lil' babies gettin' smoked, motherfuckers killin' they whole family
Lil' kids gettin' thrown off buildings

The problem is all inside your head she said to me
The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You probably gonna think that I'm talking
About you and you're Goddamn right, I am
Look at you, this is the minimal I could diss you
Subliminally, but I think criminal instinct
Has pushed me to the brink, ""My pussy does it stink
He still loves me 'cause he puts me in his ink
He does, doesn't he? Still is, isn't he?
Nah, I'm just playing tug of war with his heart 'cause he misses me
I can still fuck him and leave him whenever I feel frisky
And there's no risk of disease 'cause he ain't with anyone, is he?""
This bitch really thinks she can get me
If she still wants me, driving across country
Strapped up to the front seat, missing all her front teeth
Thinking to herself ""when's the next time he's gonna punch me?""
I told this cunt she's gonna overdo it once
And once she does, she'll be stuffed up in a trunk
Crunchy, scrunched her up in a ball
Bunched up nice and comfy
Fuck around get dumped up in a lake 'fore you dump me
You cunning little cunt, deceitful witch
You thought you had me, till my shrink told me this

I feel like a serial killer, I keep dumping bodies in the lake
I'ma get caught and sent up the river
I shiver when I think of the company I keep
How do I know she ain't gonna kill me when I sleep?
I shriek, every time she hands me something to drink
Sex kept us together when we slept together everything
Was all better, she made me feel like a king
Slowly she began lowering my self-esteem
She'd go to the club and not answer the phone when I call her
And I just bought her a truck for fifty-thousand dollars
Accused me of doing drugs and scream and holla
Then I find a bag of coke on her, some marijuana
And all I know is every time I go
To them hiding spots, wherever she hides her blow
The little bags of dope, there was a pile of coke
That's growing smaller, and that was just a while ago
And I wouldn't even let on like I know
What was I supposed to do? Call her out on it, we'd just argue
Say she put it there on purpose and flipped the whole script
Ooh! She's a manipulative evil bitch
A cunning little cunt, little deceitful witch
She thought she had me, till my shrink told me this

[Verse]
Put the needle on the record, and a needle in your veins
If Luda's on your record, it will never be the same
'Cause Luda makes hits, other rappers make claims
I cut the braids off, but ain't a damn thang change
Lets get one thang clear, the South's right here
Still got the Grammy for the album of the year
12 mil sold still flying on lears
Over 30 million dollars in the past three years
'Cause I gets money, money I got
The first in the hood with the bentley drop top
The Jacob goes tick, Audemars go tock
Fruity Pebble diamonds, they say I'm on rocks!
I get that gua-po-le, own twelve properties
Only game I play: real life Monopoly, properly
And ain't no need for apologies, sorry is as sorry does
Follow me, 'cause...

It Aint,Geto Boys,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Scarface]
Niggas hangin' deep on the cut
Sippin' on a motherfuckin' 40 ounce of Gooden
Ain't shit changed in my hood since '86
In 1987 I was swore into the clique
All the triflin' bitches in my hood smoked moes
And all the real gangsta ass niggas rode vogues
Drop Monty Carlos, El Dogs and Caddy Coups
Firin' up fry flaggin' hoes out the roof
Car down crush bustin' fresh paint
Eight in the back you hear my Alpine crank
All of my niggas they had a truck load of dope
Cause back in the gang you can get it by the boat
It's 1993 new bounds are being broken
If you ain't bangin' then you gots to be smokin'
Cause I remember back when the nigga had green
Seen him at the pipes and now the nigga is just a dope fiend
Funny how a nigga, sold a key or two
Is down on his ass and all of a sudden he remember you
Everythings cool I'm the niggas man
Reachin' out his arm tryin' to shake a nigga hand
But I just walked away and left his shit to hang
Cause back in the game I had a motherfuckin' thang
And that's why I walk with my hands on my dick
A nigga say ""What's up?""
I look around and I say ""This!""
And I could give a fuck if the nigga gets pissed
Cause if he wants a chunk I'm a get up in his shit
[Interlude]
Like it ain't shit
I thought you knew
It ain't shit

[Verse 2: Scarface]
Creepin' comin' up a yellow stonin'
Put my shit in park and drunk a St. Ises with my homey
Reminisced on fast times past times and shit
Smokin' on some bud I came across my nigga Kick
I gave my boy some dap and asked him what's the haps
Chillin' with this girl and a gat across his laps
I knew he had some drama I didn't even have to ask it
Now where were them bitches at it's time to kick some asses
He told what had happened and now I'm thinkin' ""fuck""
I'm callin' up South Acres it's time to get 'em up
My motherfuckin' neighbourhood is quick to get with static
Never showin' fear cause these niggas never had it
Everybody's trapped, quick to go to war
Quick to kill your ass quick to jack your car
So if you see some shit then I suggest you punch it
Cause what's about to happen you may not be able to stomach
Killers killers killers steady smokin' fry
So nigga lay it down or die motherfuckers die
Fuckin' with my family you dick is in the paint
So don't think that it's shit cause niggero it ain't
Shit to break 'em off I'm breakin' 'em off with chunks
Siggedy south iggedy acres ain't no motherfuckin' punks
And drive-by shootin' ain't the motherfuckin' shit
Cause niggas plot hits after motherfuckin' hits
Killin' you ass for kicks doin' shit for the murder
And since you want me to die you gots to die cause you deserve ta
Now here take this motherfuckin' slug (bang)
Cause fuckin' with the kid is the grounds of being drugged
Mister mister Face the hardest nigga being heard
Cause all I have in this world is my balls and my word
I'm sick of motherfuckers thinkin' they run shit
Until you face to face wiith Scarface you ain't done shit
I'm killin' off you mark ass niggas with a slug from a Glock motherfuckers
I'm a born killer, I really thought you knew bitch
I'm slappin' hoes and cappin' fools

Comparing yourself to me is like a Benz to a Chevrolette
And clown rappers I'm bound to slay
I'm saying hi to all the cuties from around the way
Yeah 'cause I got all of them sprung, Jack
My girls are like boomerangs
No matter how far I throw them, they come back

Yo it's a must that I get papes
Peace to all the DJ's who gave me love on they mixtapes
And once again the man's back with a dance track
So here's your chance, Jack, to get loose and let your hands clap
I got juice like Boku, mad crews I broke through
Brothers be mad cause I hit more chicks than they spoke to
And everytime I'm jammed I always find a loophole
I got a crime record longer than Manute Bol
And my raps are unbelievable like aliens and flying saucers
No more iron horses 'cause I'm buying Porsches

Put one in your belly, leave you smelly, then take your Pelle Pelle
I'm the neighborhood lamper, punani vamper
Mess around you'll find my silk boxers in your Mommy's hamper
And nowadays girls want you for your money
I'm like Hev, I got nothing but love for you honey
And since I'm looking slick and my pockets are thick
I need surgery to get chicks removed from my (chill)

Sleep Apnea,Buck 65,"['hip hop', 'alternative', 'r&b', 'jazz']","[Spoken]
In my darkness
I speak now upon this object of nature
And now upon that
And find it impossible to soothe my restless head
However much I wish it
This perpetual action of mine deprives me almost wholly of sleep...

(Buck 65)
I haven't slept, sleep being the cousin of death
And as I lay there awake at night there wasn't a breath
That exited my body that didn't coincide
With the recycled evaluation of feelings that I know inside
Boy Scouts have had their way with my stomach
And a marionette hangs limply from my most important muscle
I simply can't imagine living on the moon
Hope that I can climb my way back to dreamland pretty soon

(Buck 65)
Prosthetic throwing arm, isn't it fantastic?
I won a one way ticket to hell in a handbasket
It seems like I got it made, and then I begin to feel
Like I'd give up all my winnings for another chance to spin the wheel
I don't know if I have a prayer or a hope in heaven
All I know is that I'm afraid to read my horoscope
It makes me wanna holler or at least let out a yell
I'd give up my next life if I thought that it would help
I don't wanna play no more, I just wanna get to sleep
Cuz most likely sleep will let me forget about the other people
That haven't been able to make me stop feeling
Like demons are hiding behind the walls and in the ceiling
My catcher always told me you can't hit what you can't see
Your absence actually aggravates my fancy
And my own stubble tickles me and irritates my sensitive skin
I'm surprised at how uninventive I've been
I'm frozen, but my mind's made up and I've chosen
To lock the door behind the next person that goes in
Raindrops keep falling on my cheeks
And on my trusty little halo over my head, and so it's getting rusty
I've been poked by so many fingers
That getting poked by fingers don't bother me no mo'
I feel like a jellyfish, uncephalized, uncivilized
Unspecified, unspecialized
Currents carry me, my own endurance buries me
Deterrents make me weary, so I wear this ring for reassurance
Currents carry me, my own endurance buries me
Deterrents make me weary, so I wear this ring for reassurance"
Im Going Home,Bobby Brillo,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]

When I take you to the club and we're drinking, it's on me
Champagne, Grey Goose, and the Henny, it's all free
I'm not ballin' but I'd treat you like any baller or G
Buy expensive dinners and keeping it VIP
And you know me, I'm smooth like your cootchie is bare
They call me Bobby to the Brillz or the Brillionaire
I got you boo, cause I'm one hell of a dude
I don't mean to be rude but can we finish off in the nude?
If you don't dick dive, get out of my ride
If you don't ride bone, leave me alone
If you don't suck dick, get out of my crib (get out my crib)
I bought you food and all of your drinks
And you ain't down to touch my dink
I listened to your stupid jokes
That shit ain't jokes

[Hook]

If you ain't tuggin' on me
And you ain't rubbin' on me
And you ain't fuckin' on me
Then I'm goin' home
If you ain't slidin' on me
And you ain't grindin' on me
And you ain't ridin' on me
Then I'm goin' home
If you ain't trickin' on me
And you ain't lickin' on me
And you ain't sittin' on me
Then I'm goin' home
If you ain't ho-in' on me
Your mouth ain't open on me
And you ain't blowin' on me
Then I'm goin' home
[Verse 2]

I thought we had an understanding as soon as my money has landed
Now I'm blowing all of my dough for unspoken sexual plannin'
Why are you being such a tease after wine and expensive cheese?
I should be getting a reach-around even, or at the least!
Bitch, Please! Why do you think I'm made of rubies and gold?
Trying to call up some other groupies that be waitin' on hold
And they ain't scared of puss, they ain't about to be cold
They know what's up when I be going out and spendin' my dough Holla!
So touch my dick, or get out of my whip
If you don't lick balls, don't come at all
If you don't lick ass, don't spend my cash (don't spend my cash)
Cause we went out and we had fun
And now your acting like a nun
Don't act like you ain't seen a dick (come on man!)
Cause that's bullshit!

Yo, for real tho man, seriously
I spend all my shit on you all night
And your like ""I love Bobby Brillo""
And the all of a sudden, when it's fuckin' crunch time son
You ain't puttin' out, what the fuck?
What you think I am, a motherfuckin' ATM?
You can go fuck yourself man
Yo, I'm goin' the fuck home
I'm taking my fuckin' zip and I'm taking my fuckin' grip
And I'm flippin' you the bird, quite honestly
Honestly I'll be a fuckin' gentleman
Until you fuckin' pull some shit
You pull some shit, you pull some fuckin' gold digger shit man
What you think I'm Thurston Howell man, I ain't got fuckin' money
Holla at Bill Gates bitch, Peace!

Can I Live Freestyle,Pusha T,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Coming live in direct from Abu Dhabi
Recorded in Emirate's palace
I bring to you the Fear of God
Liva Don
Noah on the boards
Steven Victor on the camera
Virgil what up

[Verse]
They say this took confidence, I just call it patience
Cause I had too much pride to take this motherfucking cadence
Knowing the Feds watch me, private paparazzi
Still chasing me for war crimes like a Nazi
Against all odds, see the judge tryna' Pac me
Lucky dice roll got my lawyers screaming, Yahtzee
Who the fuck can stop me run away freight train
Mike Vick's redemption, big doggin like a great dane
12 cylinders 50 grams of willing ya
These rappers get away with pushing these child Illingers
Now it's hard feelings, I just put my ceiling up
Planetarium Push, the I-Max experience
They say I talk coke for 9 years long
That means my rap sheet is more than 9 years strong
You niggas would have thought that I was 9 years gone
But I am still in the mix like 9 ounces and a straw
Nigga get your bag on, bitch get your bag on
Balenciaga Hobo so heavy that you drag home
Yeah, see my verses let you tag along
Swim in the oasis of this drug dealers Babylon
Three bitches, three different flights
Glad it was four sides at that Paul Williams fight
The Wynn, the Bellagio, the Palms three nights
As long as they are separated they are my three blind mice
You can't just rap this, the same mindset
That had me hide it in the mattress, now got me round the atlas
Wish every doughboy could get a fair crack at this
They say when one ends, that begins a new chapter

Let the Rhythm Hit Em,Eric B. & Rakim,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Let the rhythm hit 'em

[Verse 1]
I'm the arsenal, I got artillery, lyrics are ammo
Rounds of rhythm, then I'ma give 'em piano
Bring a bullet-proof vest, nothin' to ricochet
Ready, aim at the brain, now what the trigger say
Tempos trifle, felt like a rifle
Massage and melodies might go right through
Simultaneously like an Uzi, nothin' can bruise me
Lyrics let up, when lady say don't lose me
So reload quickly, and you better hit me
While I'm lettin' this fifi get with me
You steppin' with double oh seven, better make it snappy
No time to do your hair baby, brothers are bustin' at me
Beats and bullets pass me, none on target
They want the R hit, but watch the God get
Quicker, the tongue is the trigger, 'cause I'm real fast
Let off some rhythm at 'em, let 'em feel the blast
Penetrate at a crazy rate, this ain't no .38
Hit 'em at point blank range, and watch 'em radiate
Runnin' out of ammunition, I'm done with 'em
You ask me how I did 'em? I let the rhythm hit 'em
[Hook]
Let it hit 'em

[Verse 2]
I push a power that's punishin' , prepare to be a prisoner
The hit man is the, brother with charisma
Showing you that I have, powerful paragraphs
Followers become leaders, but without a path
Ya mentally paralyzed, crippled ya third eye
Rhymes are blurred, then it occurred that you heard I
Reduced the friction, with crucifixion
Let loose the mix then, boost the piston
Eric, hit 'em with some of that cut like a lumberjack
And me gettin' hit back, it won't be none of that
I'm untouchable, you see me in 3D
When I let the rhythm hit another emcee
Lyrics made of lead, enters your head
Then eruption of a mass production will spread
When music is louder, full of gunpowder
Microphone machinery, when I see a crowd of
Party people, pumpin' their fist like this
Ya hide in the back, thinkin' that I might miss
But the R is accurate, plus I'm packed up with
Educated punch lines that I have to hit
Whatever I aim at, I line 'em up
Ya body is weak, feel with pain, that time is up
You been hit with somethin' different, isn't it?
Rakim is gonna radiate, nothing's equivalent
Nothin' can harm me, why tryin' bar me?
You couldn't fuck around the Ra with an army
You'll get wrecked by the architect, so respect him
I disconnect 'em, soon as I inject 'em, with radiation
Put 'em by the basement, bust his chest open
Bash his face in, let it split him
Since he brought his main man with him
He ask me how I did 'em? I let the rhythm hit 'em
[Hook]
Let it hit 'em

[Verse 3]
Dance floor's dangerous, packed in like a briefcase
Rhythm with real rough rhyme, beats with deep bass
Girls with tight pants, maybe they might dance
Tonight if the R's on the mic, there's a slight chance
The crowd is crucial, MC's grounds are neutral
Now that you're here, let me introduce you
Get ready, I'm hard to read like graffiti
But steady, science I drop is real heavy
Radiant energy, that'll be the penalty
Touch the third rail, on the pain of remedy
The prescription's one every hour, now it's a habit
Ya need another hit from the freestyle fanatic
Attention: follow directions, real close
Keep out of reach of children, beware of overdose
Too many milligram, no one made an iller jam
My rhyme is the rhythm of thoughts that kill a man
Ideas for the ear to fear, might split him
He'll never forget 'em, he'll rest in peace with 'em
At least when he left, he'll know what hit him
The last breath of the words of death, was the rhythm

[Hook x4]
Let it hit 'em
[Verse 4]
Now throw you hands in the air and yo, go
Rakim will do the rest of this slow
If I speed they know, they;ll blow the hell up
If I slow up they'll catch up, hell no
Wicked as I kicked it, don't need to remix it
'Cause I prefixed it, reversed and switched it
To perform to perfection, section for section
Rhymes keep connectin', ya guessin' what's next and
Blood pressure rises, ya damn near lost it
Ya hit the ground burnin', and woke up frostbit
'Cause when I explained, ya can't complain for pain
Travel through the brain, hit a vein, then remain
Let it radiate, vibes will vibrate, why did you violate?
Now I'ma have to let the style break
Moans now, the tone is ingrown
After this gets thrown, gimme another microphone
Before I get that, fifi I met
Whisper ""I wanna reach her intellect""
Kiss her, 'cause I wanna give her the most respect
So I shine and let my light reflect
Hold her, mold her, make her feel older
Lay her on my shoulder, everything I told her
Makes her feel secure, whenever I'm with her
And you know how I did her, me and the rhythm hit her"
Both Hands,Childish Gambino,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]

They can talk that shit when the chips are up
But the chips are down, cause I put them there
And I got a hot chip like the indie band
This is Christmas man and my flow is Miami
And the only gold that I have is my Emmy bitch
Yes and a nigga stay down like I'm in a ditch
These niggas never did shit different, I was tired of it
See the other side of it
Hate how they say how hip-hop is dead and everybody is the same now
I am not the same, how could I ever be?
I am so fly and on fire like a phoenix wing
I go light speed, you go slow pace
And I go hard like G-O in bold face
Used to do me cause I had to, now a nigga like to
Cause I get cheese like the mice do
I'm a work of art, crush niggas like I'm crushing on Annie Clark
They stopped sleeping on me, good morning, like Alonzo
Go ahead and cut that shit out like a tonsil
Yes I stay weird and fuck chicks like I'm Gonzo
Sleeping on a cow pie, tired of the bullshit
Dick is her baby, why does she abuse it?
Eight shots and a beer and I'm passing out
Glasses, leather jacket, I'mma ask you out
Spend the night if you got your own tooth brush
I really think I'd like you, but not too much
I got big plans, yeah I feel myself hard like both hands
Yeah, I feel myself hard like both hands
[Verse 2]
This is all fun, yeah my work is vacation
Me and six shots, that's a bad combination
I don't need your money, this is free, download it
Play it at a party, watch it pop like a soda
Thick, indie black girl, double stuffed Oreo
Make a shit rapper pissed off like a urinal
You cannot see me, I can change your perspective
Sick boy clique, that's an animal collective
Fuckin' withcha raw, like I don't need protection
I am just a rapper, I'm in search a perfection
Spit hot shit, yeah my mouth is a toaster
Shit look easy like a turd in a short skirt
I am not a fairy-tale, I earned this shit
Leave a track on the stove and watch me burn this bitch
Sick as a dog, fly as an angel
I am just a rapper better learn sign language
Cause I don't talk, yeah I fight, Teddy Ruxpin
Yeah I got paper like I just ate a muffin
This is all wrong man, this is all wrong
Have a nigga have a hit and then they sing the same song
That is so not me, I'mma change it all up
Doctor knows I'm sick dude, I don't need a follow up
Tell me when you can't take the track any longer
Weird Soufflé, yeah the noise makes me stronger
I have gotten stronger, tongue like a shotgun
If you let the track loose, you can watch me pop one
Sick boy bitch and it's back to the future
Cause I'm McFly and it's not what I'm used to
Cause they used to call me other name of a rooster
Sky is the limit, like a jet pack booster
Fuckin' with a nigga like he fuckin' with a time bomb
Can't see a nigga motherfucker turn your eyes on
I am so different y'all don't even know the half of
I do not talk, motherfucker I'm a Rapper!"

9 to 5 to survive, theres gotta be a better way
Waking up early to punch in the clock
How I look, a grown man with my lunch in a box
But my kids need socks and shoes, I'm walking through
The office, boss yelling ""Who you talkin to?""
Dont you know on the streets I woulda- nevermind
The past is the past, I gotta leave it behind
But man, back on the block I was a bonafide hustler
Spot popping off until the police rushed us
Handcuffed us, I thought I was gone
Coulda cried, thinking I'd miss my son being born
But I was blessed, beat the case, now I'm tryna reform
But these white folks, make it so hard to move on
You gotta, jump through hoops, anger management coups
But the fact I'm still standing here today is proof that...

Shee was standing at the bus stop, sucking on a lolli-pop
Eyes collard green, lean, thicker then a pork chop

But this girl was so divine that I had to make her mine
Called her phone a few times, she thought I was funny
Fell for it like a dummy, it was all for the money
Gyeah...growing up in the hood
You would think Id understand,but I never understood
Why she really came around, when my dough wasn't good
Now you could call it puppy love cause I got dogged out
Now on all my note books I got her name crossed out
But she lost out, I just lost profit, when she left me in cold
Heart broke like like my pockets and...

All stressed and depressed from just watchin the news

Shake that attitude and do what you can
Set a couple goals follow through with your plans
Time waits for no man and tomorrows not promised
So if shes still alive shoot a call to your momma
Cause the fighting and the drama, its just not worth it
Nobodys perfect, ain't none of us worthless
We all got a place, and we all got a purpose
Now I'm not taking y'all to sunday service

Blowin' doors off hinges
I'll grab you with the pinchers

Now remain calm, no alarm
'Cause my farm ain't fat
So what's up with that?
I've got friends and family that I respect
When I think I'm too good, they put me in check
So believe when I say I'm no better than you
Except when I rap, so I guess it ain't true
Like that, y'all, and you just don't stop
Guaranteed to make your body rock

Now-
Get your clothes right out the dryer
Put Armor All up on your tire
Sport that fresssssh attire
Tonight we goin' out, set the town on fire
Set the town ablaze
Gonna stun and amaze
Ready to throw a craze
Make your granny shake her head and say ""those were the days""

[Chorus]
Now check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about
Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out
Let's turn this motherfucking party out"
Confessional,Copywrite,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
My face has had more hits than MySpace
That's why my nose is crooked and leans sideways
All because I'm hard headed
Used to be inside the bar gettin' hard liquor
Just maxin' my card limit
Was missin' my ex girlfriend and it
Felt like the world ended
Started blackin' out, the days of when I'd hurl, finished
So in Colorado and Kansas
I got jumped cause my dumbass had swolled bottles of Xanax
Quit drinkin' and takin' pills and all those problems would vanish
That's what happened with Icon but I won't argue semantics
In '09, I've dealt with way too many natural losses
In March, my new girl dumped me
Fuck it, I'm past it, I'll chalk it
Then just when I was able to laugh it off, nauseous
Last May, my mom passed away from natural causes
Bad enough in June all month I'm reminded my dad's gone all day
Now what, I gotta write a song called May?
Guess that's life a bigger problem, just another day
I lost my dad the month of Father's Day
My mom the month of Mother's Day
Now grandpa's sick, I dont know what the fuck to say
[Hook]
I step off stage and I'm the only one
Mom and pops had an only son
No fans, just a man findin' freedom in truth
Spend my soul in a confession booth

[Verse 2]
I am a sinner saved by the grace of God
At 31 years of age, countless tears are on my face
How am I here, I'm amazed; I've been scraped and scared
I lost both parents, but hey, pray both spirits are safe
I hope they are okay but God's still got my sister and grandparents
But grandpa's got cancer and I can't bare it
They say the chemo's shrinken it, can't think of it not workin'
They say meds help his pain, but of his brain, I'm not certain
It's been four months without my best friend (mom)
My mom was always in my corner, even when I was arrested
Even, when I was in the wrong she'd defend me
But she's with God now believe you me, I'm green with envy (of both)
I can't believe my life some times, I need to write some rhymes
Keeps me sane when everything else isn't quite sublime
My sweet mother used to keep to me in line
Any women who reminds me of her I need by my side
They say seek and you'll find, Believe me if tried
And I won't stop
She can be my wife and I can be my own pops
Reincarnated, finished cheating
Never understood what gives men a reason for woman beating
Not saying that my dad did it
Maybe once he wasn't bad with it
But the one time he did it left a bad image
So I've learned from other peoples mistakes
And tried to learn from evil they've placed
On people I've faced
Yup, these are the breaks
But sometimes the parts are too broken
To grab a tube of super glue and stick the pieces in place (confessional)
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Im trying to do with ought my selfish ways but
All I can think about is my self today
See I owe it to myself, but I dont know if I can go within my self
And make changes like sobering myself
The irony, The higher I can see, I'm lowering my health
Plus it's cold up in my cell and there's no one here to help
Yeah I served a little time for a DUI
See you drink, but they don't wanna see you drive
""Officer, they don't have slumber parties at the bar
So pardon me if rum and Bacardi Breezer is in my car""
And I can make claims that alcohol isn't my main thing
Yet I'm the one sitting with lemon squeezed in my gray drink
Fuck, I had a stressful year
Quite a eventful and regretful year
I had to shed some tears
I had to grab some liquor, I had to get some beer
To get some clear thoughts to fuckin get me here
Hit this fork in the road; Lookin' back losing all that I know
And then lookin' forward, what more do I know?
I know pain-addiction-pain-death-pain
Took the right path slowed down and said bye to the left lane
Cause life in the fast lane was stifle and mad strange
Vicodin mad canes, try to lighten my past pains
But my habits could end my life in a bad way"

You’re super cool
You’re live and elemental
You’re sweet and you’re true
You're so true
Oo-ooo-oo-ooo
You’re plain and yet so special
It's nothing like you
You’re so cool
You’re sweet and rude
You’re so plain that it's special
Its nothing like you
Well aww hoo
Oo-oooo-oo-ooo
You make me stand up, and holla
""Do the Hoochie Coo!""
You’re so cool
[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
They told me pain only shows you where you going
You get to laugh then that shows you where you been
And when you get the cash that only shows you how to sin
Like when you getting fast money and you blow it in the wind
Where we from success one in a million
We thought success was getting money in front the building
End of the summer we was counting up the killings
Like they killed baby boy tryna run up in the building, now--
Love: I bruised one of her rose petals
She was from the concrete and came up out the cold ghetto
But so gentle
But it appears like, on a clear light it could thunderstorm
Want some more?

[Hook: Mos Def (w/ Dan Auerbach singing in the background)]
Oo-ooo-oo-ooo
Pure heart
I love ya, pure heart
Pure heart
Uh-ooo-oo-ooo
Ha, it's nothing like you
You’re so
Do-doo-do-doo
You’re live and elemental
You’re sweet and you’re rude, so cool
And fiery too
You’re plain and elemental
You’re sweet and you're rude
You’re so true
[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Most say I’m politically incorrect
But most people scared, they spit it so indirect
I been accused of, same thing as you but, I refused to follow rules of who--
The complexion of politics done changed
And the computer glitch put so many problems up in the game that uh--
I'd probably still be selling ‘caine if I, didn't get a chance at the stardom or the fame
Being humble is a hard quality to achieve when your ego is crazy with no modesty
We make good music just using The Black Keys
And I'm flyin' through the hood in my newest of black V's, Peace!

[Outro: Mos Def]
Wahoo-oo-ooo
You’re plain and elemental
Ain't nothing like you
Your pure heart"

Now shit is so wack, nobody listen

Ladies and gentlemen, get ready, here I come

Now lemme get up in it, wait, wait, wait, wait

Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me ya ears
Start repentin' cause the ending is near
But don't panic, you can't function if you livin' in fear
Pay attention, you gotta listen to hear
(Wait just a minute), who the fuck you think talkin' to?
Put you on hold, get a specialist to walk you through
Kweli, the flow captain of fast and slow rappin'
I'm so crackin', you ain't heard? Ya shit appear like closed captions
King of the bars and I'm goin' hard, pause

Bangin' on the system, fightin' my kinda war
Loud as a whisper, quiet as a lion's roar

Get it now, get it fast, get it right
Get it big, get it locked, get it done, get it tight

But you don't really hear me though
I spit clearly so it's live outcha stereo
To your heart while it's beatin' in ya chest
When you speakin' to execs and they see behind the desk
To ya spirit, nothing weaker than the flesh
So while you try to keep it fresh, you gettin' deeper into debt
Real hip hop is missin' from the shelf
Yup, it's what you felt when you listen to yaself
Only a few is makin' cuts that's spinnin'
So before you spend ya hard earned spinach

They ain't down with no leaders

Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed
And enlarge my coast, and that thine hand might be with me
And that thou wouldest keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me!
And God granted him that which he requested


[Verse 1]
I'm sittin' here watchin' my daughter being born
Feel like I should thank God that nothin' went wrong
Back in my days I was headed straight for the graveyard
Runnin' from school cause enemies never stay far
Wear my colors watchin' Colors
Chasin' after my older brothers
Cause they was always into shit
Good thing we had different mothers
Playin' football in the streets with the homies
And local drug dealers kickin' back makin' money
Cause the crack fiend was always there
So I start sellin' that cane cause nobody never cared
Mama at the post office workin' that late night shift
Takin' care of my sisters cause my daddy wasn't shit
Sweatin' over the stove and on a school clothes
Open the refrigerator like where did the food go
Tryin' to do whatever I can to be a man, hope you understand
Even when shit goes wrong it's part of God's plan, Amen

Bangin' Snoop Dogg spinnin' this basketball
What the fuck is going on
In a nigga head
All of my homies gone to jail or they end up dead
Got my first tattoo tear when I was nineteen
Chasin' a pipe dream
Crenshaw boulevard chillin', that was the night scene
And like the movies, niggas act a fool
When you pushin' a Beamer, who gives a fuck about a school
Mom's set a curfew, but I was breakin' all the rules
Kicked a nigga out the house so I started forming my crew
Gettin' a little bigger on my own
In the twelfth grade Crips schemin' on me
Cause they know my trap self made, tryin' to get by or getting high
That's how I survived, be a leader not a follower
That's how them coward's die
Pay 'em no mind but keep my chrome to the end of time
Feeling like no nigga can see me I think they're going blind

[Verse 3]
Seemed like just yesterday a nigga was only 21
Showing the little homies how to use a fucking gun
Now look what I become, nigga was on the run
From the Compton slums, they right, like father like son
But I'm missing them days when I couldn't roll up a blunt
Bust the windows out of cars just to only drive it once
Yeah them was the days but now a nigga getting paid
Pouring down rose for my niggas in the grave
My nigga Big Will and my homie P D

And I swear to God funny how the time fly

[Interlude: P. Diddy]
Ayo, I'm from New York, man!

Gats, I pull it, heads be duckin' when New York be bussin'
Take that

[Verse 2: P. Diddy]
Welcome to New York, motherfuckers, where we don't play
And out-of-towners get got like everyday
And a gangsta's a gangsta in every way
Sittin' low on 22's; this what long money do (C'mon)
Now the don's on it, Diddy shine on it (That's right)
Tell Flex to run it back and drop a bomb on it
Sunday, we layin' low in Halo, sippin' Cris and we straight
Monday, we go to Bungalow 8
Tuesday, I'm in Spa, drunk, doin' the shake
And for the rest of the week, we just follow the freaks (Let's go)
You can spot us out of town by the way that we walk
The way that we talk, cocky, the state of New York (That's right)
Hot now top down at the Rucker game
New coupe, no roof, playa, what's my name? (Woo)
Now Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Staten
Uptown, what now?! Let's make it happen

[Interlude 2: P. Diddy]

If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere
We still here! And we buildin' four more new towers!
[Verse 3: Murphy Lee]
Who say St. Louis ain't hip-hop? Dirty, we hop to what's hip
I'm a lunatic with too much grip to let us slip
I'm so St. Louis, ask my tattooist
I was like ""The Waterboy,"" now they sayin, ""You can do it!""
I'm Baby Huey, one of the best in the Louie
Sip Louis, smoke louie, dressed in Louis
Home of back porches, Chucks, and Air Forces
Old-school cars be trailblazin' like Portland
The girls are the best like Travis with fat asses
I call 'em ""gimme girls,"" they always tell me I can have it
All got habits, marijuana to static
By two cats and coats with automatics (Rrrah)
St. Louis, the Truth like Sojourner (Wha)
Don't need a burner we learn from Ike Turner (Wha)
I tried to told ya don't cross that bridge (Wha)
Without permission from the St. Lunatics

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg + Jermaine Dupri]
Palm trees, bad bitches and wannabes (Uh-uh)
O.G.'s like me eatin' on pollaseeds
Now and Laters, jellybeans, and Wallabees
Real niggas from the set I hardly ever seen (Yeah)
Mostly heard, sell a bird off the cizzurb
And when we dip, we hop and then we swizzerve (Woo)
A lot of homies like to wear the pizzerm
Hair longer than hers, sharp with the fizzur (Haha)
Doggy Dizzogg, you know I like to bizzall
Like Kobe to Shaq so take that (Take that, take that)
Long Beach is on the motherfuckin map
The city by the sea, R.I.P
JD (That's me), you know about the LBC (Uh-huh)
My niggas love the Steelers, cold hearted killas
Real cap peelers, real niggas feel us
Ain't no squeelers, a lot of dope dealers (Oh)
Bang diggy dang dang Dogg Pound Gangsta Crip Gang
Yeah we do the damn thang (Do the damn thang)
Go to Pomona, scoop up Kokane
Head to the church house to get a little workout
Smoke out, drink up, now put ya bank up

Crank up the beat, raise up the heat
I'm throwin' a block party on 2-1 Street, fo' sho'
[Outro: Jermaine Dupri + Ludacris]
Welcome to Atlanta remix, hey

Big beats, hit streets, see gangsters roamin'
And parties don't stop 'til eight in the morning
Welcome to Atlanta where the players play
And we ride on them things like every day
Big beats, hit streets, see gangsters roamin'
And parties don't stop 'til eight in the morning"
Game Over Remix,Tinchy Stryder,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Ghetts]
You ain't my spar you’re a target
Me I'm like somebody marj in the market
Me? I put a carcus in a basket
Head, feet, arms to his armpits
Ain't you noticed?
I gotta stick like what’s his name… Moses
Red sea I ima part it like I can't swim
Lets see who departs when I'm when I’m barring
Everyone
And it's clear like Evian
You ain't doing nothing new my bredda
Swear down your just doing what I've already done
Came in the game at 19 my friend
And I took you over by the time I was 21
Don’t ever compare yourself to me
I'm a sawn of shotty rudeboy your a pellet gun
Make a lot of money from a war like Peggy done

[Verse 2: Slix]
My sweat's undeniable
The man are all washed up and dryable
When it comes to the war I’m fireproof
I don’t choose to win, I desire to
Some say I boast some say I brag
But I remember
When I never had jack
There were brown cheese all over the rag
Nice to see your swag!
(No Cilla Black) Flee
So high that I gone past fly
Money on mine grind on mine
We get it in
Fuck getting by
We live dreams
Fuck living life
I’m crazy labels call me barmy
Girlies are nothing they Just Cavalli
If there Ain't money they can run past me
It will take my death to pass me
[Verse 3: Griminal]
Yo, is it my go? Should I go?
You know why I flow
I’m psycho, like Spyro
With a biro with ma eyes closed
When I roll
Then light ‘em up like a light bulb
Why I boast
When guys know
That I’m hotter than the devil still the coldest
Only when I’m rotting in the ghetto with roaches
And you are not on my level you a novice
But I’ll show you what a pro is
I get a pen and some paper
Then im fully equipped
So driven you would have thought I'm pushing a whip
I get dirty like Fuda and Slix
Not striding you ain't itching all over the kitchen
Full of You ain't shittzing me
I live down the dance got my shorts
Got so many lines I’m as hard as a book
What's rhyme? Rhyme's not as hard as it looks not max
But im still a star in the hood
Grimsom!

[Verse 4: Fuda Guy]
Urrrrgh
They roll with a leng, man I roll with a witch doctor
I shake his left hand one time (game over)
Black clouds are a sign I’m gonna take over
[?] cruising, kinda like a range rover
My bars carry me like my names Oprah
I’m gonna make bread son gonna buy a big toaster
Now my doctor will come ‘n’ put a hoax on ya
Leave your insides hurting
Lung cancer, spleen rupture
I penetrate souls, I’m a soul puncher
I’m known to the underworld I’m no stranger
Light skin, but I can turn darker
I’m a real prodigy, yeah fire starter
Violate me once guarantee I will mark ya
Show me girl twice yeah guarantee I’ll shaft her
Flatten me three times don’t cause me laughter
[Verse 5: Wretch 32]
Game on, chain on or off
This is my scene, Wretchro monologue
Try and find me, I’m so gone I’m lost
And you are getting fucked if you’re not on top
Not on box, stopwatch. Oh!
Be there in a second I’m a lean G-Shock
By my Roley, I’m the essence
Let me get ticked off,, I evolve, rap athletics
So they can’t get over the bar I am setting (hah)
High junk, check your bars, in the wreckage
I’ve already seen your future in my past
I Am Legend, Wretchro

[Verse 6: Dot Rotten]
The earthquake is real
I get cash to flow for a couple of months
What suckers and chumps wanna stop me from fucking it up well
Stuck in the slums what stopping or not somethings become what these young bucks
Covered in gut shells
Money and guns ain't nothing to ask for so why don’t you go get something back
Nothing but fuck hell
I squash beef when I'm talking because, when I'm judging these fucks they ain't on stopping enough
(Girl) I get pressed when I'm cutting em up stop crushing the bombs see everything under the suns
(Still) I come on a bus like nuttin a slut what's everywhere any other MC covered in blood
(Well) I'm too cute you're a puddle o' slut I took the game like a picture and I'm lovin a loss
You know I be hard the earthquake that's coming to crush ya D.R
[Verse 7: Roachee]
Ludacris’ out of the game
Start strapping like a deranged brain, crazy as me
It’s becoming even more erratic with age
And when the automatic sprays, it’s guranteed to change your head shape
Black clouds and acid rain
Got a couple mad cows giving smashing brain
So it’s happy days
My blazed hatred explains why its always ugly face and we’re ain't on the same wave
And I still don’t know how to behave
So when I’m hated I put everyone on display chains
I confiscate safes, empty the contents and stick it in my safe and might save for blades
Head gone recording for heaven’s sake
See Flo not boarding any planes to Spain
No sunshine just gun crime
So until the game’s over, I was spraying aids

[Verse 8: Maxsta]
That much sicker when I flow em like
Pirate hit a nigga in his boat
The [?] when I'm funny I'm like whats wrong I'm out for the money and the girls
Pinky and the brain but I'm chillin in ma gaff with the box on
So don’t ever get ahead of yourself
So chart heavy when you can't say the flows aren’t heavy
True I'm on track like I got a gold car ready
Flat cap on you know I'm messing about
Clap lead for me like I'm stressing it out
Scratch heads when I'm rapping what you telling me now
I'm 10 times better like I wrote turning me round
So you stand with me out like an enemy fry
You only got a couple bars you ain't getting around
But I actually feel like I ain't a ghetto now
Get an x-ray you'll see they cutting me

[Bridge: Tinchy Stryder]
And now I’m reloading
Started with some junk but now it’s time to throw some blows in
Told them with the flag they better know me when I stroll in
Girls so high in the sky you see my black clouds revolving
It’s over, the curtains drawn the doors are closing

[Verse 9: Tinchy Stryder]
Yeaaah
I’m a big boss in a district
So I cuff em down two locks on a wrist
Stop with the gimmicks
I’m fucked with the lyrics
I’m elevating you're stuck in a lift
Run up on the game like a check move cos he’s
Some dark blue bally's
Who stole wellies?
King Kong bars don’t see two strallies
Fuck the whole game up and I'm no prozzy
Yeah, talk to me, money talks you can't afford the fee
Ima walk till them Nike six zero’s exclude any apostrophe
Those are what a fees for, this kinda money ain't fitting in a shoe box (no way)
I'm relaxing taking my shoes off, game over, victory white wash"
When Im Gone,Wiz Khalifa,"['pop', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
And they say all I rap about is bitches and champagne
You would too if every night you seen the same thing
Money wall to wall, young famous nigga, spend it all
When you die you can't take it with ya
Bottle of Rose if I’m drinking with ya
Cause most niggas is broke, they bank is injured
Them bitches gonna ride with who they think’s a winner
And I'll be smiling in case they take a picture
Oh, I'm smoking weed, drinking liquor, make a hundred
On a show spend it all on my niggas
When I go shopping I tell them pick one
'Cause they was with me when nobody seen a vision
Always about my business, don’t play the cards
I talked to the niggas who dealed them, uhh
Royal flush, now look up them niggas and baby girl you see us, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm gonna spend it all why wait for another day?
I'ma take all this money I own and blow it all away
'Cause I can’t take it when I’m gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can't take it when I’m gone, gone, gone
I’m gonna spend it all why wait for another day
I’ma take all this money I own and blow it all away
Cause I can’t take it when I’m gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can’t take it when I’m gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
[Verse 2]
Hella hoes in my car, they wanna feel that maximum speed
Never had an absence of weed
Tired of being at the bar, everything Louie V
Plus the most exclusive tree in my jar
Making my bank, spending it all
And that expensive shit you paid for, she had it on
She taking it off, most of these niggas just talk, ain't caking at all
Back in the day money was short, I’m making it taller
You know what I mean, some say it’s a problem
Blowings my greens, not saving my collards
No NBA, they say I’m a baller
Live for today, stunt like my father

[Chorus]
I'm gonna spend it all why wait for another day?
I'ma take all this money I own and blow it all away
Cause I can’t take it when I’m gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can’t take it when I’m gone, gone, gone
I’m gonna spend it all why wait for another day
I'ma take all this money I own and blow it all away

'Cause when we, first got together started hanging out you was
Skeptical at first had to figure out if
I was the kinda guy to try to dog you out, but

Okay, when you hit the mall, pop tags spend a few G's
Hit the runway to a new season
It ain't nothin', I spoil the one I care for
Feel like I ain't doin' enough, that's when I shared more
I give you dis, give you dat, what you need, love?
You know I got it holla at me if you need love
And affection 'cause I'll be your protection
Kinda hard job, but I do it to perfection
And you can tell that I ain't tryna let you go
I get wit you when I can, so that's how I let you know
And you be trippin' 'cause sometimes I gotta go
But you the first one I holla to right after my shows
And I was trippin' in a sense, I was tense
But my body loose around you, what I'ma do without you
I gotta get it together, say whatever
But since I met you, my life seem so better

Phat People,Childish Gambino,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Billy Scafuri]
One, two, three, check it out
On the road to sandwiches and chicken wings
Fat people do phat things
Using salt and pepper for their seasonings
Fat people do phat things
Check it out
It's B to the I to the double L-Y
My friends all know I'm not an ordinary guy
I like little things, like chicken wings
BBQ sauce, honey mustard, onion rings
And when my cell phone rings it goes jingle-jing
I say hello, I say hello, I say who this be?
They say it's Fancy Ned, I got a fancy head
I'll eat a fancy ass sandwich on some fancy ass bread

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
The wait is over, shut up, bend over
I hang with monsters, I chill with Grover
The boy Ebola, my boy fat too
And my girl so fat that they call her Oprah
I got that green like a bowl of okra
Loose change so fat can't fit my sofa
I head to the bank, call the shit my grocer
It's Sex in the City, get the fat mimosa
Me and B, we fat boys, hang with fat girls
Driving fat toys, fuck Dan Aykroyd
I'm live on a Saturday night
I got two fat girls, I'm doing it right
Like my name John Goodman
I got the fat crib so I'm doing real good, man
And I'm up to no good, man
This is how I get fat, call the shit cooking
[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Fat people do fat things
Fat people do fat things
Fat people do fat things
Fat people do fat things

[Verse 3: Billy Scafuri]
I tip waitresses, I tip scales
My style is kind of fat like an Orca whale
I'm sipping whole milk as I stare
Thinking I can be your Oprah, you can be my Gayle
Cause I am a fat boy, never been to Bally's
Married to this fat life, call me Kirstie Alley
Married to the snack life, counting every calorie
Might just open up a fat boy art gallery

[Verse 4: Childish Gambino & Billy Scafuri]
What else you do, B?
I'll make it easy
What else you do, B?
For girls to squeeze me
I'm phat but my numbers run
Listen, son, I'mma show them how it's done
When my swagger weighs a ton
Stickin' straws inside of girls, you can call me the Capri Sun
[Verse 5: Childish Gambino]
I make the girls drip, so I guess I eat Gushers
Screaming out yeah like I'm eating out Usher
In your dad's bedroom where I fuck you
Knockin' on the door, so you're screaming out ""nothing""
But they all know it's something
You didn't think I'd tear the pussy up, did you pumpkin?
But better and better like Benjamin Button

[Verse 6: Billy Scafuri & Childish Gambino]
I hang out with Chester Cheeto
Cooler than the ranch on your Dorito
Hotter than the peppers in your burrito
Getting cheddar and cream, if you know what I mean
Yeah, I know what you mean, homegirl mistaken
She think Gambino won't bring home bacon
Or bring home Swiss cheese, my dough got holes
Cause all these hoes want shoes and nice clothes
They want the Macy's, the Neiman Marcus
The Fendi purses, the Gucci parkas
I know you want it, don't get me started
They see Gambino and they act retarded

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Fat people do fat things
Fat people do fat things
Fat people do fat things
Fat people do fat things

Eat snacks, mother fucker, eat snacks
Eat snacks coming out of packs
Guaranteed to put a little fat on your back

It's like a bitch you can't shake
I still wanna

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Sleeping with the finest, the thread count is bindless
Security blanket of cocaine, I am Linus
In this climate I’m Kareem Burke tied in
The Roc's silent partner I ain't throwing up the diamond
Throwing on the shearling, collars up, bottles up
Sparkles to the table, got him feeling like he’s Merlin
Whirlwind, powder makes your world spin
Learn from OGs, Alfa Romeos and Sterlings
Updated that, upgraded that
Suffocation blue, in the inside's potato sack
Yeah, talk money, shit, I’m made of that
Cocaine parties like the 70's, I cater that
You know what fame is?
Sitting with the woman of your dreams and forgetting what her name is
You know what pain is?
Flushing two bricks and trying to have a nigga strain it out the drainage
[Hook: Pusha T]
See my face on the news and it ain't Tivo'd
I still wanna sell kilos
It’s like I’m throwing rocks at the Pen begging for the Rico
I still wanna sell kilos
Searching for the fishscale like I’m tryna find Nemo
I still wanna sell kilos
That's what happens when you Michael
And they try to treat you like Tito
I still wanna sell kilos

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Grew up watching momma car repo'd
A little nigga staring through the peep hole
How you think I felt knowing daddy wasn’t there
Recycling cans cause nobody ever cared
Get it how you live, always echoed in the streets
When we talking business, talking on the phone cease
Feds listening to conversations through my OnStar
Piecing puzzles together solving homicides of I's
Dice game chatter, better bring your stash out
Red velour, I’m in the white glass house
Half a ticket bitches quick to drop it on the scale
City of dope where real nigga sell yay'
Everyday a nigga dies and we can’t ask why
Showing more love to bitches fucked on the side
Tony Montana, tailor made suits in the church
Rolls Royce Corniche, trunk full of work

See my face on the news and it ain't Tivo'd

And they try to treat you like Tito
I still wanna sell kilos

Testarossa top models, G4s
Gucci pass the crease off, everything I climb in, I win
Richard Mille Tourbillon, remarkable timing
Black label everything, logos in the lining
Bell Biv DeVoe, push poison like a copperhead
Powder falls, smoke clears through the walking dead
The Rosé bottles pour for the champions
You'd think it was a Grammy win, celebration spills
Through the morning like an Ambien, bitches love my ambience
Chain swinging, ticker taping like it’s Mardi Gras
Thousand niggas deep, never needed body guards
Thousand ki's that I’m about to do Pilates on
Wear the king's crown like the grill a Maserati’s on
Catty corner parked, doors ajar, on a stripper
Blew a fuse and caught a body on, cocaine storaging
Liva living dreams, y'all DeLoreans is pouring in

Wax Goes Bananas,Wax,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
If there was a crowd right here right now I would make em say all right
And if you know a damn thing about me you know I could do this all night

[Verse]
Big Wax I'm the best you know
My flow SHIT got CUNTFACE tourettes syndrom
I'm straight nutty, sorta like my penis hole when I'm horny
If y'all bananas, I'm Chiquita's whole inventory
At 16 I was rappin' great and I've stayed hot like Christina Applegate
Shit that makes chick teens masturbate
Rappers straight looking up to me like I'm Sistine Chapel paint
I care less each day
About what all you hating internet geeks say
Judging by the way that your always thinking of my ass
I'll assume you're and gay and you probably wanna fuck my ass
My YouTubes like porn to you dudes
Probably keep my picture in your drawer with some lube tubes
And while you think about my dick and balls
I'll be at your girls house rippin' off her frickin' drawers
I got her face down hog tied
Pussy so wet you think it just got off the log ride
And when I do my thing she be screamin' ""you the king""
Inside her so much she nicknamed me Nuva Ring
She moans and she moans
When I twist around her nipples like rotary phones
There are so many Joneses but only one Wax
And its no need to clone cause God's already done that
The lord must me a silly guy
Cause my brothers a fuckin' beast and he don't even really try
I know it seems like a circus act
But name a set of twins that rap better than me and Herbal rap
Damn it mom! We should have been a boy band
Raw spitting at the audition up at Disneyland
Is Mickey Mouse in the frickin' house Anaheim?
Shout outs to my peeps in the chocolate-covered banana line
I say stupid shit, whatever
Ain't nobody that can do this shit better
Line up all the rappers in the game that you say are hot
And for each one of em hand me one Jager shot
And watch me down em all, then clown em ell
They try to follow my lyrics like they that bouncin' ball
This ain't karaoke night
Fly with me and Herbs its a very smoky flight
That purple berry kush got me feelin' like Elvis, thank you very much
Man, my teams all got medical cards
So if you fuck with us it best be on a federal charge
Obama, don't wanna get no drama
Its californ-ia brah we all blow ganja
The highest Hosanna, I'm the hottest know son, I'm
Fuckin yo momma, them I'm out like the road runna
My shit tough like a brillo pad
I stand tall y'all got the same shit that willow had
Y'all motherfuckers fit inside a shoe box
Me and EOM Paul Bunyan and his blue ox
You're an all around little girl, we NBA, y'all are small town intramural
We get compared to Guru and Premiere
You get compared to Sulu, you queer
My shit is random, my shit is damn dumb
Big on YouTube like Tantrum vs my man Dumb
I gets foul like and one
Have the fuckin' priest at your church like God Damn Son!
I'm fresh like croissant restaurant
And you're a big dummy like Lamont, what you want?
Y'all ain't fuckin' with the ill tones
Steppin' in the ring before you got your skills honed
Lil clone, you must be crazy player
If your lucky you'll get saved by the bell like A.C. Slater
Cause even on a cold day in hell
For you to beat me there is no way in hell
No fucking way, you are so fucking gay
You should go fucking play a game of cro fucking quet

Back Home,Asher Roth,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
Yeah, as comfortable as a mug
The rug under my feet, you see it keeps me from pulling it up
I'm young, I got my lunch packed and brown bagged do not look fat
I even think I got a snack pack
And dad pays for gas in the hatch back front seat
Lean back when I leave it there he always gets mad
Turn the bass on the BOSE up to full let it blow roll the windows down and lets roll
I'm home
Feels so good knowing there's a bowl of cereal
And milk in the fridge when I wake every morn
Never fold my own laundry, dog are you feeling me?
I pay no bills, no rent, no utilities
As, good as it gets
But, no regrets
When I turn my back on it
Tell my parents I'm gone and
Don't wait up, be late when I make the name famous
The smile on my face size of the Great Lakes (Great Lakes)

[Verse 2: Whatzisface]
When I get back home I'm ma kick my feet up
Got man food to eat up
Went to take a poo
Who left my seat up? (what the?)
I read the paper while I'm pushing them trouble times
Plus, the can fit for a king, wiping with double ply
Toothbrush new, and clean my shoes with it, yep man
Shower all clean no pubes in a wet drain
No dudes on my couch, or chicks in my crib
But just a, ill that I rolled, and a six in my fridge
I got my, hand on my balls while I hang up my drawers
And wіth my, full on pause I ain’t taking nο calls
Sο if уου, know lіkе I know being home ain't a chore
Sο I'm ma sit οn my couch, chill watching ѕοmе porn
Cause when the rents gone dog I bе οn ѕοmе Ferris

Oops, mу bad, seems thіѕ іѕ thе wrong address

I’m іn thе basement cold chillin' (chllin')

I’m straight tripping, grades slipping I’m οn punishment
Cаn’t even slide tο that house party where аll thе honeys wеnt (damn)

Working fοr whoever paying mе except thе police
Stay up аll night kicking raps аnd smoking don’t gеt nο sleep
And еνеr ѕіnсе I brοkе thаt table іn thе kitchen

Welcome to the land where it just don't stop
Trunks pop, tops drop, and the front end hop
Paint flop screens on, acting bad in the zone
Yeah it's on riding chrome, balling at my home
Texas plates don't hate, showing up in the state
Can't wait get it straight, while the front end break
Paid the cost to be the boss, looking good when I floss
Sunshine let it down, turn it up and clown
Fool around hit your block, trunk going on knock
Let it up let it pop, light up the whole block
Southside how we hold, on a gangsta stroll
Music hitting so hard, knocking off side molds
Hit the highway, cruise control, go on let it roll
Po' up the drank fire it up, make sho' the windows closed
On chrome high side, throwing up the Southside
Giving niggas dap coming down, wrecking the slab

Swisha burna bouncing turner, sitting low on 4's
I'm pulling through the lot, slamming do's on buttons
And I'mma slide slide, slippidy slide
Pop trunk let it down, show up in my ride
Roll out the red carpet, never buy it to park it
Valet piece and chain, starch is my jeans
Hit the club showing love, tip the dancer a dub
Got killa in the club, for after the club
One more time for they mind, I'mma gon put it down

And you laced on the game, that cost a fee
Bouncing on the track, with P-A-T
Now they see how it be, I'm just a G
Cocked up on three, blowing on a whole tree
C.B. in the drop, crawling down on boys
Right behind him is the Lincoln, my favorite toy
Candy red with the screens, and I'm riding on cream
Mean mugs triple beams, make reality a dream
Sipping lean sticky green, make em cloud the whole scene
Europeans what the deal, making all haters chill
While I show my naked skills, gripping wood grain grills
Running lights shining bright, floating smooth as a kite
Trunk cracked Fat Pat, breaking all haters hats
Where they at where they at, 'fore I pull out my gat
Looking good it's understood, flossing for my hood
Taking pride in my ride, like every playa should

Which Side Are You On?,Rebel Diaz,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Which side are you on?

[Verse 1: G1]
See I gotta draw the line, I can't take it no more
If you ain't down with revolution, what you waiting for?
Making money for suckers and our communities poor
Ripping flags off of coffins, man, this ain't our war
Colonized and terrorized by the world's biggest killers
The US government, the biggest weapon and drug dealers
Filling prisons with children, incarcerating the future
Myspace and Facebook got us stuck on computers
Stuck on stupid bumping music that's abusive to the shorties
And the nonsense that you spitting, they just listen and absorb it
I've been dormant, I've awoken, I'm a giant, I'm ready
I'm with the APPO in Oaxaca and we holding machetes

[Verse 2: RodStarz]
I rock hard like Palestinian children holding slingshots!
I'm with every single kid that's down for hip hop
For the culture, the life, what it really stands for
This music is resistance, it's the voice of the poor
I'm on the side of the workers, the teachers, and lunch ladies
On the streets with brown mommies raising our brown babies
I'm with youth organizers cleaning up the Bronx river
I'm like Jaime Escalante when I stand and deliver
I'm with Evo Morales, man, he running Bolivia
Distribution of the land so we could all live bigger
I'm with Hugo and Fidel, Grandmaster and Melle Mel
I'm with the Panthers up in Queens, justice for Sean Bell
I'm with Camacho Negrón, I'm with Ojeda Ríos
Freedom for Oscar Lopez, time to get an appeal
I'm with Abu-Jamal, I'm with Assata Shakur
I'm with the compas in Immokalee getting a penny more!

I'm for a world without borders and a better tomorrow
I'm with Mothers on the Move, I'm with sistas on the rise
I'm with La Peña del Bronx, keeping culture alive
I'm with the kids at the Batey, watching a beat battle
Mean mugging all these yuppies in shorts and brown sandals
I'm with parents everywhere fighting for good schools
And for all these good women to find some good dudes
I'm with Salvador Allende, I'm Super Anti Momio!
Con el pueblo en la Havana grito Viva Cuba Cono!
For immigrants, activists, unions, and freelancers
For DJs, MCs, bombers, and breakdancers
I'm with editors, engineers, Indymedia
I'm with my family and my crew, Rebel Diaz
I'm with DJ Disco Wiz, a Latino pioneer
Cause it's dope when the elders break bread with the kids
[Verse 4: G1]
I'm for telling the truth, exposing the lies
Think about the dead soldiers when you're driving your ride
Them people died for the oil and Daddy Bush's revenge
I'm with the widows, the children, and the lonely best friends
I'm with Families Stayin' Together as ONE
I'm not for the raids and the deportations!
I'm with Victor Toro and the M.I.R
So watch out for those snitches in that unmarked car!
And for Lil Saulito, we gonna fight for your moms
So we gonna shout her out, twice in one song
I'm for twelve million workers and Elvira Arellano
I'm for a world without borders and a better tomorrow

One more cup and I might take off
Seems like haters never take a night off
But you know I’ma tell them that they can get lost
Cause I’m feelin myself, it’s my world
I’m spending money like a rich white girl
I’m gon' ball like I’m 7 feet tall
I don’t know about y'all, but I’ma get off, cause I’m feelin myself

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Oh, what a feelin, the champagne is spilling
All this dirty money got me bathed in them millions
Came out unscathed from the days of my dealing
The driver of that car wasn't made for a ceiling
Still up on my Nino, smelling like a kilo
But I’m downy fresh soft white like my pillow
Feelin myself so if he know like we know
Cross that line and get shot like a free throw
Rather be on fire at the tables out in Vegas
Under bright lights, middle finger to you haters
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I’m feelin myself

Baby take your chance, never mind what you’re hearing
I can change your life tell me what are you comparing
Put you on the red carpet tell them what you’re wearing
Shop 'til you drop they say sharing is caring
More than my winnings, we can share opinions
Like baby steps, we can share beginnings
Walk before you run, but she so independent
And I could see us fly, the sky is the limit
We so real, got my own quarter mill
Counting money on the bed, watching Deal or No Deal
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I’m feelin myself

Uh, word
You don't get this everyday, word

With so much drama in QBC, it's kinda hard bein' Escobaro
El Dorado Red, sippin' Dom out the bottle
My life's like a Donald Goines novel
We wave glasses like bravo
Drunk niggas with mad problems
Shot pockets, niggas on the block rock this
Box cocaine, cook it and chop it
Lookin' to profit in triple ways
Goin' through this difficult stage called life
With each year, my physical's praised
Niggas slip beyond the reach of help
Caught in the street, thinkin' they can teach theyself
When all we wanted was a piece of wealth
And randomly feed our family, these streets are insanity
Amber me, caught inside a thugs fantasy
Richest nigga in showbiz is what I plan to be
Heavy desire, hold this 9, ready to fire
You know me, show me the money like I'm Jerry McGuire
It's on..
[Verse 2: Nature]
It's time we set it straight, connect with Dre the correct way
Predictin' platinum in less than a day
So for that we toast, this one's for us while y'all lackin' hope
All I do is write raps, stack, relax and smoke
Watchin' my dreams come true
Stayin' humble in the eyes of others
Politicin' with the wisest brothers
It's Nature, one of the latest, peep how I play this
Straight from the Bridge, one of your kids' favorites
From now 'til the day that I'm stiff
Foul flagrant, pay the rent, always stay swift
Stuck in my ways, type chauvinistic
Since a youth, I had a thing for big Coups
Flooded rings and older bitches
Holdin' my riches in lump sums for trust funds
Fully recovered thugs lust to bust guns
While some'll get drunk, beat wives and cuss sons
A slow process called life, lets show progress

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
When I said I hold my own, I wasn't frontin'
Never claimed to be the baddest, for skills, I got a little somethin'
Comin' through, new clique and tracks
Known for blazin' on The Chronic, that's what put me on the map
Nothin' could give me more pleasure to start this
I worked the hardest
Ducked the farthest, makin' me illest producin' artist
Done crimes, ran from one-time
Could catch me with my crew bustin' rhymes in the Sunshine State
No case, to build I chill with millionaires
Out to make a killin', for real, my resolution this year
Few places I walked, most imagine
New faces I met at beauty pageants
Past cuties now wanna do me
Yo, I never forgot where I'm from
I check for family and every nigga who was down from day one
If you ain't speakin' money language, I can't hang
You know your conversation is weak, so it's senseless to speak"
Dead by Design,Canibus,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'alternative']","[Intro: Professor Griff]
Canibus
Throwing melanated molotov cocktails
Engineer directly out of Full Sail
Ripping the jacker, ain't nobody nastier
Spitting and grabbing facts and data to enhance ya
Canibus the lyrical adjective killer

[Verse 1: Canibus]
My Melatonin Magik is enhanced by the melatonin tablets
Come take a walk with Canibus
Ardipithecus Ramidus, what the fuck is Melatonin Magik Bis?
I still ain't understanding this shit
Okay, my brain is a microchip
My two balls with a cane is a macro-dick, I rap so sick
I created swine ploo out of an infinite mix
You tried to diss but can't even spit, you just stand there and wish
With your hand on your hips, man you a bitch
Who the fuck is you to criticize a lyrical king
You see, that's my problem, I spit a thousand bars y'all was silent
I ain't heard nothing about it
I had to give you three years to recognize
And then I realized, can't nobody even fuck with my rhymes
The Internet is an early telepathic building set
My lyrics are international nuclear missile threats
The blogosphere is where you vent frustration and discontent
But children don't understand the concept of consequence
So yes, it's immature to express disrespect
But no I will not accept what the media says
They are the reason we are being misled
There are forces above them that feed off our stress, suffering and debt
I am Dead by Design, cause nobody tells me what to rhyme
I make up my own fucking mind
There are more of us than them
But at the same time they are gods and we are just mortal men
Thirteen levels above 33, let me say it again
They are gods and we are just mortal men
I cannot imagine their power
They put a black family in the White House just so they can take away ours
You tryna to plan a great escape? You're a coward
They gon' march into a gas chamber make us think we're taking a shower
Mommas and babies is crying
The children of Zion belong to Skynet, nobody knows who's behind it
So if you don't care, fine then, I don't care either
But I ain't spineless like you, I'm a true believer
In the metaphysical aether, you listening to the lyrical reaper
The spiritual teacher, empirical speaker
After this album they gon' call me a leader
But I'm not, Killuminati just gon' murder me like Pac
Blood sacrifice or not, I don't even wanna be alive
If it's like that, then fuck Tiamaat
You can laugh at my appearance
Well fuck you for standing there staring, fuck everything on this planet
Including the evil spirits, notwithstanding the aliens
Acting like they don't hear us, there's no need to fear us
Just come done and help us, I love James Brown more than I love Elvis
But that don't mean I'm selfish
Soft but hard on the outside like shellfish
Crispy, crunchy, black crawling out of Hell's pit
You scream for hardcore, I felt it
But what you gon' do when they kill me on some Eminem and L shit?
You won't do a motherfucking thing
Cause let me tell you why, you a coward and you don't know shit
Cause if my Brothers stand next to me, the energy expands collectively
The world was never ready for me
And they ain't ready for their own freedom neither, they perish from the heater
The fire breathers crawl out of their cage to eat 'em
Like thin crust pizza, Cthulhu creatures with rough features
Jeepers creepers, good luck with Jesus
How many meters? Reload and squeeze it
I run up in the Vatican with demons, just to get even
That's where the biggest demon is
It's no secret, but nobody else sees it, so they won't believe it
But that's when I calm back down, the key word is back down
I got possessed by my own raps, wow
Knock knock, who's home? The black Dan Brown
I didn't mean what I said, please don't kill me now
My ghostwriter's not around, plus it was just a freestyle
But at least I got better beats now
Meanwhile, motherfuckers still mad, I feel bad
I'd apologize but you acting like a real fag
What the fuck I'm supposed to feel like?
Twelve years later I still don't get acknowledged for shit that I write
But I don't want to talk to you now
It'd be a motherfucking miracle if you even see me walking around
They still ask me about 'Second Round' even now
(Interviewers voice) Canibus can you tell us of what happened again? - Look at this fucking clown
Can't get over it, they ask me a loaded question
And act like I was the one promoting it, hang up on 'em
You a cyborg unit with no soul to it
Stupid surrogate, twelve years later I'm on some other shit
And so is the whole world, look at the mother ships
And so is the whole world, look at the mother ships

After this album they gon' call me a leader but I'm not
The Illuminati just gon' murder me like they did Pac

When your pockets are thick, mad chicks be on a brother's tip
When ya sporting jewels and driving in a groovy car
All the ho's gonna sweat you like a movie star
To get in your pockets that's what them girls wanna do
But if you not rich them chicks gonna front on you
No matter how strong your rap
You only knock boots when you got loot and you on the map
'Cause if you broke you'll get a whack slut
If you got dough you get a ho with a fat butt
With fresh gear, long hair and a cute face
And if you live alone she's gonna pack her suit case and move in
Then you start losing all your bucks
Soon you broke as a joke and out of luck
Then she takes off and breaks off, your ho's gone, so long dear
I'm outta here a good relationships been torn
'Cause when you on top everything's okay
But when you broke you gets no play

[Chorus: Showbiz]
If you don't got ends, you won't be getting no skins
And if you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash, you won't be getting no ass
And if you're not clocking loot you won't be knocking no boots
[Verse 2: Big L]
Girls of the nineties ain't nothing but crooks
It's all about what's in your pockets not how you look
That's why you can't talk to just any whore
Leaving brothers for the next man 'cause he's got a penny more
They want a drug dealer, not a scholar
Some girls barely speak but always asking for a dollar
And if you pushing a fresh Benz, they'll be your best friends
Yeah, as long as you collect ends
You think she's all yours, but as soon as your dough go
Your ho go, now you solo
But when you was makin' papes selling jumbos
You bought dumb clothes for all of them bum ho's
And you was taking 'em to the movies every weekend
Now that you dead broke, the girls stopped speaking
'Cause nowadays girls want you to trip
The only thing they can get from Big L is a big...
'Cause when you on top everything's okay
But when you broke you gets no play

If you don't got ends, you won't be getting no skins
And if you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash, you won't be getting no ass
And if you're not clocking loot you won't be knocking no boots
[Verse 3: Big L]
I tell it how it is 'cause I'm a bold figure
And I hate a money hungry girl a.k.a. gold digger
It ain't even funny
Some girls don't even know me asking me can they get some money
I'm looking nothing like your poppa
I wouldn't give a chick ten cent to put cheese on a Whopper
They wanna know why I'm so fly
A girl ask me for a ring and I put one around her whole eye
Chicks used to diss, but now they wanna kiss
Yo Showbiz, I'ma break it down like this

If you don't got ends, you won't be getting no skins
And if you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash, you won't be getting no ass
And if you're not clocking loot you won't be knocking no boots
If you don't got ends, you won't be getting no skins
And if you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash, you won't be getting no ass
And if you're not clocking loot you won't be knocking no boots

It's like that y'all and that's a fact y'all
I hit hoes from the back and don't give a jack y'all
It's Big L y'all, I'm living swell, y'all
I do my thing, that's why my name ring bells, y'all
If you don't got ends, girls be fronting

And live for the moment, not by the past, homie live each day like it’s your last

All my life, I couldn't fit in, like a bad shoe
I was always too square, too cube, too tall, too weird, too blue
Forget them high-school’s hotties now I'm too cool
I guess I came a long way from that young kid
The school's most popular lame, no friends, no style, no clothes, no ends
Just a bed, fell asleep, never woke up again ('Gain)
Yeah, and my last prayer was don't ever let me end up like the people that's down here
'Cause the one that fear change be the one that don't care
Look at themselves and see somebody else in the mirror
But you can always pick me out of the crowd
Loud mouth with my very own style
And what I know now is don't ever pretend
And live every single day like you won't see it again

So take my name, remember this face, keep the change and have a nice day
And live for the moment, not by the past, homie live each day like it’s your last

Then you better go live it, cause whatever you love could be taken away
So live like it's your dying day

I dedicate this to my teachers that never believed in me
And the mother that conceived, but ended up leaving me
I just wish y'all could see me smile, this big's grin on the TV now, oh
And I took it from the bottom to the top
From the holes in my socks, Ramen noodles in the pot
Used to rob them on the block, now they stop me in the drop
Middle finger up and that ain't gonna stop
I used to take orders, now I make bets
I used to scrub floors, now I sign checks
I used to push carts, now I push songs
I used to be there, now I am so gone
I fired myself, found a job myself
Established my name and then I signed myself
And what I tell myself, is you did this by yourself
And when I'm on so long, I'll be by myself
I'm gone

So take my name, remember this face, keep the change and have a nice day

Wish I could know what they're thinking when they heard my first hit
'Cause I remember them wishing that I wouldn't get big
Now I bet they’re wishing they wouldn't of said that shit
I came out of a dying city brought back life
Everything they said I couldn't do I did about twice
Multiplied by the bottles that we popped each night
That equals out to a celebration, bitches more ice
Make it toast to the underdogs, toast to the team
Toast to the fact we this close to the dream
Pour one for my exes, used to talk reckless
But now I push Benzes and rock Rolexes
Came from the city and until they come and get me
Turn around and see the whole east side's still with me
And that's how we live it, you mans don’t change
Look, it's still the kid, still can’t tell me a goddamn thing, Kells

[Chorus: blackbear and Machine Gun Kelly]
So take my name, remember this face, keep the change and have a nice day
And live for the moment, not by the past, homie live each day like it's the last
And if you only have 24 hours, 1400 minutes before your dreams gone
Then you better go live it, cause whatever you love could be taken away
So live like it's a dying day

[Outro: blackbear]
Yeah, it's a long way home at the end of the road
I'll be pavin my own way, to the top, I be here to stay
So take my name, remember this face, keep the change and have a nice day
And live for the moment, not by the past, homie live each day like it's your last, yeah (Yeah, yeah)"

Yea
We fresh off-mutherfuckin South Beach
Yea, uh

[Verse: J. Cole]
Sometimes play the villain, sometimes play the hero
Sometimes I be Dilla, sometimes I be Preemo
Sometimes I be feeling, I got a big ego
Other times a nigga swim around like Nemo
Uh, small fish in a big ass pond
Pushed around like a mower on a big ass lawn
I get my weight up, inflate up
And make these old niggas open the gate up
At the mansions that they laid up in
Like, ""Hello my name is Cole"" - I'm walking right up in and well known
Don't give a fuck it you gon hate it man, hey fellow
Either you follow me or swallow me bitch
And I done hit to many hoes to ever pause that shit
Now since I just seen my face up in the XXL
A few chicks want to text ""let's chill""-how obvious
Girls from all over the world is my hobby
And I got a chick who stay in DC like a lobbyist
My old chick from Raleigh that I still like to parley with
Just to hear that accent, now come and get that back bent
The moans turn to screams, I can feel her climaxing
Now if you faking that baby you need to try acting
Hollywood shit, had a nigga feeling like the milkman
Deliver that through the body good dick
Feeling like I got game that Karate couldn't kick
Therefore I'm bagging things that you probably wouldn't get, what up
I'm a talk until you tell me shut up
Uh, and we can walk the beach until the sun up
Huh, I ain't gon lie I'm trynna get some cut up
Ay, so what up
Hey, you heard that huh?
Oh you ain't heard of me well I prefer that
Uh, I text my number to you did you get that?
Huh, well when you lonely baby you can hit back
And I'll fix that
Tell me is you with that, hey

Ay tell em is you with that
Yea, ay baby is you with that? Yea"

Check, yeah, the track got hot once I got on
I wear my heart on my sleeve Comme Des Garcons
I know I’m the shit, my French Pardon
A king in the booth I get my troops march on
We outta here, bars drop ya thinkin’ I’m a enigma
Cause I been had swag back when it was charisma
You know I’m a champ by how I’m raisin' my fist to
Not be number one I couldn’t live with that stigma
I figure, I was at the top and I’ll never slump
Neva pump fake nigga I’d rather dunk
You feelin’ good about yourself go head bet a hun
I take ya girl then ya pride, then the cheddar come
You’ve neva won and ain’t dreamed about ever winnin'
Second place the highest place that you ever been in
I do whatever for the cheese, I’m forever grinnin’
This verse amazing and it couldn’t a had a better endin’

[Verse 2: CurT@!n$]
Curtains, I’m the best at it, number one
With the flow, KRS at it
And I’m handin’ out L’s like Nike I’m a chess addict
You try to battle but you lost like a Meth addict
I’m like Meth at it, I’m the fuckin’ man
I done ran them all like Cunningham
No gun in hand, but these warning shots
Try to diss me, then I’m on your block
You lookin’ shocked, like we done fucked up now
I stay in the cypher like puff, puff, pass
No Spliff, but I’m a star like Busta man
Already said it once, but I’m gone tell ‘em again
I’m number one, uno, no dos
I’m like an atheist I got no hope
For your week raps, you can keep that
I got the game all Twisted like Keith Sweat
[Verse 3: Big Sean]
What you know about, being the best at
Any place you reside or rest at
Used to have to check back, now I hand back checks
And can’t remember the last time I seen flat chests
Out of town luggage lookin’ like a chess match, Louis
Or a tournament, chain look like a ornament
Me and your bitch fornicate and she ain’t on no foreign shit
But I hit her from behind and leave a wet back
And then I pass out
Then I took ya girlfriend & turn her to my mascot
Hometown hero but I never pull my mask out
Bet the crowd love me love me like I hit the last shot
Sometime your first shot, can be your last shot
So see what I do when the ball get’s passed out
Yep, but everybody call me Big
Go hard or go home, so I don’t ever see the crib, bitch

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Say, I’m bout to handle my business, who is this
The Big Dawg of the South, don’t forget this
Now sit back and bear witness like LeBron
To the King, AKA boss I’m so the Don
All that, been that, now I’m ahead
On some other shit tryinna get my hands on my bread and don’t
Let it be said that I do not run it, run it
I bet you what you tried to do, I done done it
Ridin’ foreign cars, doin’ foreign shows
Makin’ foreign money, fuckin’ foreign hoes
Held down VIP and popped bottles
Made it rain up in the club and knocked models
Later for that mane, it’s all in the rear view
I got my eyes on the prize in the clear view
Ya gunnin’ for the top spot and yeah I hear you
But me I ain’t three and I’m nowhere near two
So looka here dude"

I said they actin' like they better, but they never been the shit
Hows it feel to have a hundred thousand people on ya dick?
Well, it feels good, homie, you should probably try it
If you never rocked a sold out show, then keep quiet
I gets busy on a track, workin' double time
Tryna find a foreign pussy just to put my tongue inside
I be on the top of the charts, you just an underline
Tearin' through the streets, all these hatin' suckers run inside
Furious, fool probably wanna come and stomp me out
Mad they got a girl, and I'm all that bitch talks about
Been gettin' money since I walked around my father's house
The dads be cop and search when I come and take they daughters out
Paper come in large amounts, I'm eatin' like I should
Surf and turf shit, sink my teeth in somethin' good
They mad I ain't hood, nah, I came to party hard
You grillin' at me, but I smile back, bitch, hardy-har

Come on down, grab your girl, maybe spin her around

So you probably heard I rap a ton, havin' fun
Never have I had a gun
Vomit when I spit like I devoured somethin' bad for lunch
Tryna figure out the way to get me rich, I have a hunch
Like Velma up in Scooby-Doo, confusin' like a Rubix Cube
Usually don't do this, I be stupid, just a nuisance
All you seem to hear about, I'm in ya ear; Q-tip
Yeah, that's dude sick, sleeve with a few tricks
Breathe in a huge spliff, weed come in two zips
You light it, then I burn it, like a furnace when the herb hits
Like it 'cause I earn it, smokin' good veggie turnips
Bitch, I'm fallin' from the sky like bird shit
Makin' movies everywhere I go, call me Ernest

Come on down, grab your girl, maybe spin her around
Ain't no other motherfucker gettin' the people this wild

Mr. Nobody,Reks,"['hip hop', 'r&b', 'alternative']","[Bridge]
Nobody, nobody
Me against the world, trust it’s no party
‘Cause all that glitters ain’t gold
So I’ve been told
Been down them lonely roads where the nights get cold
When we was kids we used to say
“Oh the places we’ll go
Oh the places we’ll go
We’ll go so many places”

[Hook: Sample of Hope’s “The Rain Don’t Last” (+Reks)]
Could it be the world’s grown colder? (So cold)
Maybe I’m a losing soul (Well maybe I can’t win)
The more I try, it just gets harder (So hard)
And my pain is getting old
Somebody said that nothing lasts forever
Just the storm so I’ve been told
But it seems that when it rains, it pours
And you know (I try)
[Verse 1]
What becomes of a born loser?
I used to believe I was conceived to be king
Mommy was a drug user
Daddy died young, as a son I have seen
Many nights where he abused her
He was just a teen, and she was just a teen
When I was brought into their life hula
Hoop of deceit and lies
My poor bleeding eyes
Used to watch Nikki on the scooter
A daughter with no father may never realize
A man’s touch, a man’s trust, scrutinized
You either treat her like your queen or your bitch, right?
I had a lite-brite
It used to light up my life until the bills weren’t paid, and day became night
‘Zay became like my big brother
He would hand me down ‘nough hand-me-downs, get me through a few summers

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Daddy didn’t preach good loving
Just about the time Momma had me in the oven
I was something in the making
Praising Momma raised a boy through the dramas of a Papa’s leaving
I’m a believer in Karma
So when Daddy died of AIDS, complicated days of a young and
Coming of age, I’m in a daze
Let me cut straight through the chase
I lived it, no twistin’ it
Christmas was gifts from the gov’ment
Watching my Momma plummet
Baby boo in her stomach, womb
By the stove in the winters
Heart cold in the summers, summers
Couldn’t fight the belly rumbles
Humble beginnings were mine
Family lying, uncle dying
Time and time again head to that Welfare line
A ladder to climb through hard times
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Momma got the lupus in her bones
Roof is caving in like the upper support’s gone
Move to the South, still Massachusetts home
So through the sunshine, the heart is a cold zone
Harder to pen storms through wind storms
When Com. Sense said Borrow a Dollar, economy was strong
Now we try to borrow tomorrow to get from
Yesterday’s somber with limited income
Outcome: We out of luck and some
Hence I’m living from buck-to-buck
Fuck what Clinton, Bush, and Obama do
Politicians got us in the hole I just can’t fit my Momma through
It’s possible to do impossible, but by pursuit of proper route
Obstacles, keep writing and cock and shoot
Screaming “who got the loot” like Notorious B.I.,
Chose another brother now I’m victorious, see why?

Arm & Hammer boxes, we love foxes, leaning in the Tropics
Blood money, boats is abnoxious
Standing in the mess hall when, nose froze
Posing like a king, I'm rocking New Balances, new silencers
Glass table'll choke, twenty four challengers
Half of my niggas is slow, but they dough island
You know the pantries is full, ranches with bulls
And wolves there, who sit around, fronting in Wu-Wear
I slam a Noodles hat, pull hair, two tokes and Ghost
In a ghost, I be back in the wrong year
Long sleeve, one cuff up, rugged gold teeth
Fronting with Colombian niggas who gave me raw meat
Due to the gangstas that died, forever ride
To the rats in the manholes, who hate, niggas live
But it's all good, you from a poor hood, I guess
Back in the Guess with the Champion hood, what?

Pay a cop off, fly you your coke in
My house is worth 2.9, my Benz is worth, he want mine
Nowheres, we call that shit high heels
Dedicated heat rock sprayer, spray your mother and your lover
Better pay up, these guns is from Grenada
Wild fight, customized dice, get nice in the Trump Tower
Drunk bitch, spaghetti and sliced

This is my world, I just let you live in it
But the lease is up, you faggot niggas get evicted
How many times I gotta tell you cowards, mind your business
Oh, you still yapping? Time to catch 'em slipping
Doing dirty, we don't mind getting our hands dirty
And you can't fuck with any bitch because her ass dirty
Cuz when it pop off, we just up in shorty ears
And you just stuck with it, and how us niggas got you there
That little bad caramel with the long hair
Got you lined up, and caught in the crosshair

Yeah
It's Joey
Slaughterhouse
Check me out now, look (it's that On Top music!)

[Verse]
Psychotic is what they call you, ignore you going by my logic
That allure’ll secure you looking through my optics
Yet and still put a pill in front of me, I'd pop it
Tried to stop it but couldn't look at my eye sockets
My God it makes me skyrocket
Realest to ever do it, you can believe that shit if I jot it
And if you couldn't tell I'm on my own time
Prisoner of my own mind, problem is I don't mind
Niggas askin' what I deem as success
Life's a bitch, I'm just lookin' up her dress, I could give a fuck less
All of a sudden they see me on Joe Budden TV and I'm goin' national
But they judge me and that's a broken gavel
Shocking to me how quickly niggas will go and bash you
Never had withdrawals, pitfalls, what coke and hash do
Never stood in place while everyone was going past you
Keep your opinion to yourself nigga no one asked you
Get used to me, far from what I used to be
Provided, still throw you aside if you not of use to me
Self-destructive I love it anything that abuses me amuses me
I just hope the whole world excuses me
Hip-Hop got him under all types of scrutiny
I think that the shit's dead neck into noose to me
Wholeheartedly don't want no part of what's a part of me
Moving lethargically still I dare a nigga to spar with me
What I aspire to be never inspired me
Big fan of karma, catch twenty-two's, irony
Y'all don't understand the types of demons that's inside of me
Rebel with a cause if I do it it's done defiantly
Raged looking for the machine aiming a Ruger
Old soul I don't fuck with the young'ns I ain't a cougar
Say a prayer for the losers aware of intruders
Everybody around me like the hair on Medusa
And so its time to make a move, exit
Rubber-band covering the bruise, left wrist
Faith in the man I can't prove, exist
I really got nothing to lose but a death wish
I ain't worried about jewels and a necklace
Me I live life shrewd, reckless
Nigga I ignore the rules and the message
Walk away from the shit smooth with a peck kiss
Y'all ain't hearing me, no fear in me
Only nigga brave enough to conspire against a conspiracy
Y'all want to be sick, get a MRI and mirror me
But minus any streaks not a peak gon be clear as me
Joey!
Yeah!
Its, Its!
Almalgam Music!
Whats up!
They don't understand him though!
Y'all will get it, some things just take time!
Somethings take longer than others, that's what she said!

My nigga they came back with some of that old school original west coast shit, nigga. That got all of y'all on his dick in the first place, yeah. So run that shit, E, yeah.""

[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
Cruisin' down the street in my '64
Jockin' the freaks, clockin' the dough
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shooting some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rolling Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about making that GTA

[Hook: Eazy-E]
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash, we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, cause I ain't said shit

[Verse 2: Eazy-E]
Donald B's in the place to give me the pace
He said, ""My man JD is on freebase""
The boy JD was a friend of mine
'Til I caught him in my car trying to steal a Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly cluck-head pulls out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know, I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page
[Hook: Eazy-E]
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, cause I ain't said shit

[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
Bored as fuck and I wanna get ill
So I went to a place where my homeboys chill
Niggas out there making that dollar
I pulled up in my '64 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinking
And from the 8-ball my breath start stinking
Left to get my girl to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said something that made me mad
She said something that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talking shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp, slapped the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I bombed on pops, knocked his ol' ass out

[Hook: Eazy-E]
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, cause I ain't said shit
[Verse 4: Eazy-E]
Now I'm rolling hard, now under control
Then wrapped the '64 'round a telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh, brother
Throw it in the gutter and go buy another""
Walking home and I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
A undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Now Kat got beat for resisting arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin' his Guess
Now G is caught for doing the crime
Fourth offense on the boy, he'll do some time

[Hook: Eazy-E]
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, cause I ain't said shit

[Verse 5: Eazy-E]
I went to get them out, but there was no bail
My niggas caused a riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial straight cut a fart
Disruption of a court, said the judge
On a six-year sentence, my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out, ""Fire,"" then came Suzy
The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi
Police shot the girl, but didn't hurt her
Both upstate for attempted murder
[Hook: Eazy-E]
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, cause I ain't said shit"

Then I get there, beat it up and satisfied is how I leave her
Yeah, thats how I cook the beef, you can call it beef stew
Love spanish chicks man, mmhmm y tu?
Didn't find her in a school, do you think that Im a fool?
Keep my balls in the pink pocket, call it shootin' pool
Moved my cheese, all the sudden gotta sneeze
Im not gonna be the same, no polo horse on the tee
So you guys go run and flea, cuz there ain't no referee
I'll rush you guys the whole game, commentator speak
Sirroco on the field, makin' history ain't no mystery
He's been stirred up, blowin' up, no chemistry
Started off with nothin', now became somethin'
Im married to the money and you niggas just be cuffin
Nah I ain't bluffin, im juss bein raw
And if im a problem, its the rap game's fault
Ok im six foot seven foot eight foot tall
Im a dog on the beat and the beats gettin mauled
Maybach top locked but not my hot Glock
Got the nine in my drawers so she know she gettin' cocked
Always doin' it big, so no time for small talk
Big money on the schedule, no time for small clocks
Ralph Lauren I rock, from the fitted to the socks
You claim you go hard while I charge like a ox
From start to finish, the first and the last
Rapper that stands tall on the podium of glass
Ya homeboys' my hit men, so gon' take a sit man
On a daily basis I keep the cookie happy, im the clitman
Sharks in the water, but im showin' no fear

Stay travis barker strapped, so I'm finna shoot the Glock
When im done wit ya, not gonna have a head to guide ya walk

If you got beef, then ya boys you can call
Ben gordon flow, yal juss love to talks

There's a new cherub in town

[Buck 65]
As I cross the finish line
Holding on the handlebars
With one hand the battle scars and rusted metal forks
And the busted pedal vanishes
Something wasn't normal there
All the other campers were dressed up in formal wear
And everybody's angry
So I decide to form a story
Keep a low profile, and try to find the dormitory
Thinking I was too late, I asked my room mate about the jackets and dress pants
And he said ""The best chance to stay out of trouble, ain't a heavy task at all
Be at the gym at 9, for the first game of basketball
Otherwise, you could be collecting dead animals around the campsite
By kerosene lamplight
Just like them guys in tuxedos, it's a ripoff
So whatever you do, just be in time for the tip-off""
God in heaven dead animals?

There was a horrifying silence
Now I'm not the type to be glorifying violence
But I'm gonna get physical like Olivia Newton blasting off to oblivion
Shooting if I got to
It's game time right, and I'm rockin' the spot, shot-blockin' and whatnot
You know, me and my team were controlling the fourth quarter
I gotta piece of the rock and no guards were patrolling the north border
But instead of dunking, I jump back, give myself a kiss, pull up from 12th and miss
Game over
We put one in the win column
But I'm scratching my head like I got some sort of skin problem
Feeling like a sleazy punk
I could have had the easy dunk

Jesus Fucking Christ why didn't I dunk it?

All the players hit the showers, so did the referee
Everybody left the gymnasium, except for me
I stayed behind for a good 20 minutes
Maybe 24 to slam a whole whole bunch of times, and many more
Just to show improvement to myself until it goes on for long enough
And when I finally went to put my clothes on...
A message written on a piece of paper from a notebook saying ""put this on""
With a tuxedo on the coat-hook in the locker was there"
Every Ghetto,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Nas]
Uh, yeah, uh
Blessings of life to the children, they say life is like five days
Words of a old man with silver hair, in his wheelchair
His eyes were bloody while describin' what lies before me
Said evil bitches and jealous men would try to destroy me
It occurred to me, this old nigga's words couldn't be realer
I'm on top now, slightest drama, I'll have to kill ya
'Cause animals sense weakness, sharks smell blood in water
Ishmael, Moses and Job knew the divine order
Shit is plastic material, havin' no life
I crash whips and leave it no matter the price
As long as I survive, cop a new five
Circle the block where the beef's at
And park in front of my enemy's eyes
They see that it's war, we life stealers, hollow-tip lead busters
There's no Heaven or Hell, dead is dead, fuckers
And your soul is with God, your mind keeps lurkin' the earth
Watchin' your own murder reoccur

[Chorus: Blitz]
For every struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born, and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning
For every struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born, and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning

It's Blitz, nigga, the streets glory, many die for me
Got knocked, refused 3 to 9's, went to trial for me
Basically I'm just reality, loaded with foul stories of lust
Greed and contempt, no street is exempt
Extended clip shots, hoods barricaded for six blocks
I sip shots, watchin' 'em hustlers pitch rocks
Oil paintin' pictures of my pain, illustrate the city in vain
Fallin' deep into the pits of the game
This is for the sickest state of mind, in these fatal times
Vest crimes, nickel-plated nines and niggas for the dime
Hear the sounds of them babies cry, still I'm sayin' why do we reside
In the ghetto with a million ways to die?
Stayin' high to relieve the pain, breathin' in the game
Exhalin' guilt, sin and shame, misery and strain
What the fuck will tomorrow bring, luck or anthrax?
I stand back, hopin' I'll make it through tomorrow

[Verse 3: Nas]
My skin is a art gallery, right, with paintings of crucifixes
Hopin' to save me from all the dangers in the music business
Was once a young gangsta hangin' with youth offenders
But since I tasted paper it started losin' the friendships
Watchin' kids freeze in winters, they still poor
How could I tease them with Benzes and feel no remorse?
Drivin' past them in the lively fashion, diamond colors clashin'
Red stones, blue stones, red bones and black ones
Fuck did I expect with bucket seats in a Lex
And spendin' time in Chuckie Cheese with Little Des?
Got guns when I'm with my daughter
Hate to bring a violent aura in her presence
She know what daddy taught her, it's lessons
Black princess, it's a ugly world
I put my life up for yours, see I love that girl
Could you believe even my shadow's jealous?
My skin is mad at my flesh, my flesh hates my own bones
My brain hates my heart, my heart makes the songs
Though my songs come from the Father
I'm lonely, hold me, it's gettin' darker
[Chorus: Blitz]
For every struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born, and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning
For every struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born, and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning"

Déjà vu,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Through the lights, cameras and action; glamour, glitters and gold
I unfold the scroll, plant seeds to stampede the globe
When I'm deceased, by then the beast'll rise like yeast
To conquer peace, leavin' savages to roam in the streets
Live on the run, police payin' me to give in my gun
Trick my wisdom with the system that imprisons my son
Smoke a gold leaf, I hold heat, nonchalantly
I'm raunchy, but things I do is real, it never haunts me
While, funny-style niggas roll in the pile
Rooster heads profile on a bus to Rikers Isle
Holdin’ weed inside they pussy
With they minds on the pretty things in life
Gettin' props is a true thug's wife
It's like a cycle, niggas come home, some'll go in
Do a bullet, come back and do the same shit again
From the womb to the tomb, I presume the unpredictable
Gun salute life rapidly, that's the ritual

[Hook]
Here's a toast to my foes, trees & women
(Déjà Vu)
It's like a whole new beginning...
Here's a toast to my foes, trees & women

[Verse 2]
Blunts, thugs and alcohol; what a mixture
Just picture your life as a whole judged in court, they convict ya
They tellin' you your state of mind like you worthless
So he curses, his mom's sayin' Bible verses, that's all she works with
But miracles never leave the churches
Instead, it hits the pockets of the preacher just to purchase
A house with a swimming pool, labels me a sinnin' fool
I'm just a nigga who inherited a winnin' jewel
To be a trendsetter, whenever subject to respect this
And all respect due is the essential
To street life, hustlin’, the struggle, broke ghettos
Boilin' coke settles slow inside a glass kettle
Darren Levy on my TV, lifestyles of livin' easy
Got my crew tense, plottin’ up gyps to get whips with BB's
Pushin' cakes, knew anorexics with ten plates
Celebratin' elevation in the seeds that we make
So How You Like That?

[Hook]
Here's a toast to my foes, trees & women

[Verse 3]
Escobar life, gems and raw Timbs
Gators for pretty boy haters
In Vegas with chicks trickin’ fortunes
I'm glistenin', housing cops whistlin'
Still I'm driftin' in a high, blunts is like insulin
95-I, I drive high, zonin'
Stash box zone in my trunk, I flash knots, teeth golden
Look at me now, Ma, blowin’, but how far?
Cars, cash and bitches got me out more
And things you never dreamed I could vouch for
Snake niggas slither on they a-alikes
I ain't a Christian, but I find that we pray alike
Never the one to ask for the time to a saint
A mask and nine, I think, will make my problems sink
Down a canal, similar to how we drink
Distinct diamond-flooded Sphinx shines on my links
Drug money, snortin’ bitches, in the end of times
Got my nine, 'til I flatline, nigga, gimme mine

The Door,Invincible,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Freedom is breathing the fresh air
And the feeling of rain on the face
As you came in this place
Yet shamed and disgraced
The plan was the state
Made sure she caught the blame in the case
Another number without a name or a face
2 million filling their prisons
Now they claimed it was safe

[Verse 1]
Prison bars start looking like bar codes
Freedom of soul
Case closed
By an arm in a dark robe banging a gavel
To send you traveling carloads
On gravel and stark roads
Like cargo
To a place where the heart grows cold
You hear another prison door slam shut
By hard-nosed politicians making commission
Off of starved souls and
Prisons monopolize the cash flow
Go directly to jail and do not pass go
I'm bound to get locked down
Than in a gown, cap, and tassel
Profiled the suspect
Handcuffed and shackled
The most attacked and hassled
By the cops in the hood
Though you at the top of the hood
And in the back with the lasso/lahso
The apso's gotta fill their quota of stocked goods
I might get the axe like chopped wood
It's not looking good
When the 5-0, the P.O.s, the D.A.s
The C.O.s are in large with the CEOs
They business partners
[Hook]
Come out with your hands up
Put 'em in handcuffs
We got locked
You hear another prison door slams shut
The door to opportunity closes
As it grows, the net profit it grosses
Come out with your hands up
Put 'em in handcuffs
We got locked
You hear another prison door slams shut
The door to opportunity closes
And then another prison door slams shut

[Verse 2]
He used to beat her mercilessly
But they wasn't coming around when she called the emergency
They said the state couldn't intercede
Until she made him bleed
Then they charged her in the first degree
Another door to opportunity closes
She discloses that she had a felony charge
On an application for a job
Its determination
What's she gonna do to survive?
There's no public assistance when you've got a drug conviction
Listen, you hear another prison door slam shut
Mandatory minimums
Can't ignore these are women
Living in unsanitary conditions
With strip searches by male guards
On cell blocks
Don't be shell-shocked
When I spit verses
The door to opportunity closes
When mothers lose custody
And nothing's for free
In the home of the brave
Where we get enslaved
If we don't behave
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Who's the enemy?
The women we define as criminals?
Corporate crimes get a slap on the wrist
And defined as political
Say farewell to welfare
No one else hears
It falls upon deaf ears
Wage is minimal
Get down on (?)
The war on poor
Drugs, and terrorism
Is a war on the
Democracy we never had
Just look at Florida
Elections get obtained and extorted
Foreigners detained and deported
Over the border, facts distorted
Putting people in a cage
Judge 'em with your legal ways
Lethal injection is modern-day lynching
Ain't it a shame
We ain't taking preventative measures
Like building better schools
And starting a needle exchange
So when you locking people up
You imprison yourself
More than a prisoner who lives in a cell
Your fear of losing your false sense of security and material wealth
Got you a life sentence to a living hell
We tipping the scales
And then you hear a prison door open
We kicking down the door, now it's broken
We fighting for this freedom and hoping
Saying live from the D to Oakland
No more prisons in the '04!
No more prisons in the '04!
Say, no more prisons in the '04!
No more prisons in the '04!
[Outro: Angela Davis]
You know, the 13th amendment abolished slavery for all except those who are being punished for committing a crime
So in a lot of ways what we see in the penitentiary system in this country is the continuation of the system of slavery
But the question is creating some new institutions, institutions that really will speak to the problems that people have, who go to prison. Rather than this prison system, which continues to reproduce the problems for which people are sent to prison"

Confidential informants disguised like us
Jail doesn't resonate with guys like us
Told Wesley at the Oscars to slide like us
Didn't listen, so prison is what they did to him

Yeah, sooner or later the people in this country are gonna realize the government does not give a fuck about them
Government doesn’t care about you, or your children, or your rights, or your welfare, or your safety
It simply doesn’t give a fuck about you
It’s interested in its own power, that’s the only thing, keeping it and expanding it wherever possible…

[Diabolic]

I ain't no ‘conscious political rapper’
I just say real shit

[Verse 1]

I see the truth in lies
Music let you see it through my eyes
Its do or die, kill or be killed; choose you’re sides
I may just shoot the five, or maybe shoot the 5
Cops cruisin’ by my block rockin suits and ties
I lead the likes of freedom fighters full of foolish pride
Pale horse, close as you and I since William Cooper died
Unified front, guns to the sky: drunk
Screaming at the top of my lungs
You only die once!
Living on the edge, mission torn to shreds
Pigeon on the ledge, had to snitch and warn the feds
But I was born and bred to give the blind some higher learning
And the tides are turning like a drunk driver tires swerving
This ain't no quiet sermon, see i’m an Irish/German
Genes spliced with Tyler Durden, fighting till I die for certain
So take a look into my eyes, you’ll see the fire’s burning
And afterwards let’s reveal the guy behind the curtain
[Hook: Deadly Hunta]

Witness the modern day slavery
Forget the chain, I rip them full of shit
They want to tag you with the microchip
This a modern day slavery
Why don’t you open your eyes?
And realize…
Were living in a modern day slavery
They give us crack and gun
To kill each other in the slum
While their dictating fascism
Modern day slavery
It’s them wolfs in disguise
Oh yeah, yeah…

[Verse 2]

While Bush throws the horns of Satan
I see the wars he’s waging
Like he owes a mortgage payment to some oil corporation
And what my daughter’s facing makes me wanna stop rhyming
And start stock piling Glock nines and rock climbing
Corrupted presidents, disappearing evidence
And symbols that could represent the future in the present tense
I tried to talk to God from a crucified position
But then I lost my job, now im losing my religion
Some alcoholic slob on a suicidal mission
Against the odds, nothing to lose but my conviction
And to you politicians living in your fathers shell
I hope you rot in hell, sharing Jeffrey Dahmer’s cell
I hope he eats you while you alive and gotta yell
And your fate repeats eternally on stage at Rock The Bells
So everybody else can get a taste of retribution
When generation X is laughing through your execution
[Hook: Deadly Hunta]

Witness the modern day slavery
Forget the chain, I rip them full of shit
They want to tag you with the microchip
This a modern day slavery
Why don’t you open your eyes?
And realize…
Were living in a modern day slavery
They give us crack and gun
To kill each other in the slum
While their dictating fascism
Modern day slavery
It’s them wolfs in disguise
Oh yeah, yeah…

[Diabolic Talking]

Now’s not the time for picket signs
Or letters to your senator and etcetera
If you love your children, if you love yourself
You’ll throw down the fucking hand that’s dealt
And cut the puppet strings attached to your life
Fuck it! See you in hell muthafucka!"
Spacious Skies,Invincible,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook 1]
I want to be with you
Yes you
Forever

[Verse 1]
Recollecting when we first met
Friends of yours advised me come pursue ya
Hypnotized by your spell and smell
Sprung by your perfume
I flew over – no delays or run-ins with the steward
Yeah, our love was younger, newer then
When we were honeymooners
Now our days with sun are fewer
Nights are numbered
Lunar eclipse, glitter and glitz
Hate to admit
Dismissed a hundred rumors
As imagination's figments
Spread like tumors
Diagnosed malignant
Radiation patient hunting for the cure
You’re so immature
Unreliable
Never liable
Blaming the entire globe
And call 'em evil-doers
But I’m sure
There’s no reparations
For sweat and lost energy
Considered best comrades
Became my worst enemy
Hurtful abusive
Blood curdles and oozes
Under the surface of epidermis
The purplest bruises
Truth is, you're gorgeous
But hunger for power gorges
With armed forces
Contorts your slim figure to enormous
[Hook 2]
Oh beautiful
With your spacious skies
I wanna love you but you hide behind a fake disguise
Oh beautiful

[Verse 2]
Planned your birthday party for July Fourth
I was dis-invited
Ride your high horse
To a black tie affair with your peers
Who can apply force
Oh beautiful
Really wanna make this fit
Promised me to change ya ways
But keep on repeating the same mistakes and slip
Blow your candles, make a wish
Erase the taste
In melting pots
Blood on auction blocks
Now felons caught in cells
I seldom thought
We’d 86 relationships
Obsolete like laser discs
Jealous thoughts possessive so in
Self defense I’m raising fists
Still you fail to hear
The trail of tears
And broken treaties
Border walls we
Wrote graffiti
Tag it like your toe
You’ll go alone and greedy
Even though you know you need me
No pretending we co-dependent
You killin' in my name I get the blame
Your co-defendant
So much arrogance
It's an embarrassment
See a therapist
For your paranoia of terrorists
While terrorizing
Analyze the flaws in your character
Do you really love me –
Or just lust for power -
America?
[Hook 2]
Your flirtatious eyes
Fiending for power
And the taste
Between the waist
And thighs
Oh beautiful
[Hook 2]
Oh beautiful
Just don't waste my time"
Just the Way You Are Remix,Bruno Mars,['pop'],"[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
First rule, never let 'em change you
Rule two, do you to the fullest (To the fullest)
And never be ashamed to
You're just good at what they can't do
And they hate that, they wanna paint you
In they color, put you on another
But what they don't accept, and what they don't see
The best thing is what you already be

[Verse 1: Bruno Mars]
Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?""
I say
[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are
Yeah

[Verse 2: Bruno Mars]
Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are
[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh yeah
The definition of real is
If you don't feel, then you don't you feel it
Don't conceal it, don't be fair
You look great, don't need silicone to build it, or botox to kill it
You just killing off spirit
And you the one that you gotta live with
So don't get caught up in appearance
And see the inner beauty
When you look off in the mirrors

[Post-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing just the way you are

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah"

Murder on the fuckin' beat
Ima be here for a while, take a fuckin' seat
Ya'll wack rappers is unwanted, like rotten meat
I swear my rhymes are delicious, so fuckin' sweet
And you can get some, I call it ""Trick or Treat""
Assassination with my rhymes
With my pen, I fill up lines
I've been keepin' this in, it's time to unwind
I keep it G, unlike most of mankind
I'm rappin' for the fuck of it not tryna get signed

[Verse 2]
Killin' any wack MC
Who dares step to me
I mix everything together in my raps, recipe
You shall die if you test me, the Big E
I'm being watched all the time, but I ain't no TV
Verbal rape in every lyric
I swear all the pain, you can hear it
I take this steering wheel called life and steer it
There's a CoolGuy in the house, you fear him
But yet, all you people wanna do is hear him
My lines are filled with craziness
Most of these niggas' rhymes, are filled with laziness
You girls are addicted to me, fuckin' crazy bitches
Protesters that go against me get eighty stitches
I'm too hot, is that why there's an empty kitchen?

The Emperors Clothes,Invincible,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
First they hit with phase one
Air strikes, all day and all night
Phase two, rockets hit the Gaza Strip with phosphorus
Phase three, ground attack
How we gonna counter-act

[Refrain]
Boycott, divest, and sanction
Boycott, divest, and sanction
Boycott, divest, and sanction

[Verse 1]
Israel, you should be ashamed
Kill and maim thousands of civilians in our name
Claiming you hitting terrorists but children in your aim
Even murder relief workers, blood spilling from they brain
While they tried to drive the ambulance
Damn they couldn't stand a chance
Even bomb students, hospitals, mosques, Rafah, and Khan Yunis
Shot em in the back like the cops to Oscar Grant
And in each case the good old United States sponsored that
Seven million a day that we pay tax
And AIPAC's lobbyists is robbing us
Sometimes it feels like there ain't no stopping this
But now nobody can deny it cause you made it too obvious
Naked truth exposed like the emperor's clothes
The struggle's getting hotter and the temperature rose
Since 1948, when you formed the state
Palestinian people still defending their homes
They ain't been surrendering, no
[Refrain]
Boycott, divest, and sanction
Boycott, divest, and sanction
Boycott, divest, and sanction
Cause they even bombed the United Nations

[Verse 2]
Look, I'm Israeli, my government's so arrogant
War criminals who call Palestinian's terrorists
For resisting extinction and occupation
Comparing this to genocide and reservations of Native Americans
It's a massacre, kick out their ambassador
Divest from their apartheid like South Africa
Boycott em like King to Montgomery buses
Show them we want peace but only with real justice
They murdering the media and witnesses left
We gonna stop shopping at all the businesses that invest
In building their settlements and gentrifying our corners
Illegal walls over there and the US-Mexico border
Build a worldwide movement til the truth is heard
And supporting the Israeli's who refuse to serve
All the C.O.s who AWOL when deployed to Iraqi stations
All the people rallying while the cops are chasing
If we enlisted in the system, we got an obligation
We ain't got the patience, time to stop the occupation, yeah

Boycott, divest, and sanction
Boycott, divest, and sanction

Locusts,Invincible,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Finale]
Condos remodel my old turf
For what it's worth, soul got left in the earth
On a search I stood in front of Compuware
The Hudson Building spoke first and said I was here
From old bricks all over downtown
To Sears with the Roebuck attachment
Purple Gang used to move through your block
Like a Mafia pageant
Move around in my town
Where spittas talk
And if you leave, forget us
And try to come back?
I hope you turn into a pillar of salt
Every jackhammer cracking the concrete
That's a lost and forgotten piece of the D
We’ll never see in a book or paper
Replaced with a temp casino
Strip mall, liquor store
Another stadium doubling as a palladium, eateries
The D speaks to me
Now watch yesterday get swept away beneath a pile of debris
Committees picking from a lottery
For the hottest riverfront property
Sign over your deed
Shocking to see us go from Peoplemover to people movers
Let the people choose a better way
They set up shop and sped away
Landmarks come and go like a john with a pro
Led astray and they run up on Detroit for consumption
So I look back and see my city
Under construction
Look back and see my city
Under construction
[Hook]
By the locusts
Surrounding suffocating the city and trying to choke us
Ravaging the crops making the situation hopeless
But we staying focused
Never let the locusts approach us

[Verse 2: Invincible]
Locusts and buzzards circle and hover above the
Abandoned houses shattered windows with the crooked shutters
Cross the street construct a cookie cutter condominium
Lining Woodward, it's the prime meridian
You divide the city and
In the hood, wonder why you pay two times the premiums?
They been redlining the dark-skinned
Owners of homes where they loan with a sharks fin
Arson the property probably for the insurance policy
It's a prophecy that's self fulfilling
They claim to cure us of poverty, BUT
It's serving removal
Of residents with urban renewal
The reverend is the realtor
Here to save and heal ya!
They even “buy ugly houses”
And its memorabilia
Of a myth of a city that's a mystery
Auto industry’s widow
On the auction floor they start to bid low
On houses with hanging gutters and peeling shingles
Purchased at a nervous pace and a cadence
I heard a wrecking ball hit a building that's mistaken for vacant
A sleeping city awakened
By bulldozers and the wool pulled over our eyes
It comes as no surprise
Why the rents are more from the French to Ford
To the Ilitches
Trying to pillage the village and milk it for all that it's worth
While they killing us
But we still got resilience
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Invincible]
Selective memory, convenient amnesia
Enemies scheming on land seizures
Pretend to be well meaning but stampede us
I know you not supposed to bite the hand that feeds ya
But it's poisonous, spread injustice like fungus candida
Predatory planning
Eminent domain
Mowed down Motown
For parking lot next to the game
Empty sentiment of development for pennies to gain
Forget memory lane
This is history
It's like erasing Proof–only remembering Eminem’s name
Many stories
Only one written in pen will remain
With jobs – we at least in a drought
Met a construction worker hates demolishing buildings
But gotta feed his seeds and his spouse
Told me the city pushes people into leaving they house
They cut the lights and gas it freezes em out
Who decided the divide between suburb and ghetto corner?
Henry Ford swinging his chain, the Nazi medal of honor
[Verse 4: Finale]
I'm looking at this strip
Where Lottie the body she probably shook them hips
The malnourished and wild flourish
Among style murderers
Who wanna pile dirt on us
The word on the street is that we won't last long
And is it me?
But if the history of my city was passed on
Could we physically, in spirit and mind, find a way to move
And grab at this song?
And I was young but snuck in
Mahogany put stars in orbit
Unsupported foundation, we aborted sound
Allowed rape and now
It's a bar where men and women got to frequent
And spit a slick thing in each of your ear
And sip a mixed drink and beer for sport
And now the block can not hear
And how we got here
We’ll never know
They showed a broken up Hip Hop Shop board on VH1
Like, ""ay come here come see where they from""
And that shit was too hard for me to chew
Like I hate gum
And y'all can play dumb like Jim, man
All I want is another Lush Lounge for us
A new united sounds around to bus
So people can see us
Before the debris and dust and what was
And I am not trying to rap, man
I'm time travelin'"

We been together for a few years, shared a few tears
Called each other nicknames like Sugar Plum and Poo Bear
I'm always on the road, hardly ever home
Always busy this, busy that, can't talk on the phone
I know you aggravated, walk around frustrated
Patience gettin' short, how longer can you tolerate it?
Listen, Ma, I'm just motivated
I do this for us, stuck on the grind, tryin' to elevate it now

Ayo, to really be honest you stuck with me through my whole struggle
Can't even express through words how much the kid loves ya
I'ma stand as a man, never above ya
Well, I could tell that you different from most, slightly approach you
And the ill shit about it? We don't sex every day
But when we sex, we tease in a passionate way

Cuttin' up in the streets like we would never get old

It's somethin you need to know, you make me wanna get physical
You make me wanna get intimate, into it, I'm fixin to blow
All my heart, and all my time
I'll give you everything that you wanted, baby just name your price
Mine is yours, and yours is mine
Trust me that's a fact girl, you ain't gotta ask 'cause
I don't know if you ever been told
But I got whatever you need, girl
And whichever way we roll
No one could ever take what we've got
Right here between one another
Don't care what they say, you gon' be my lover
And if it's in love baby, I wanna fall
Just promise me baby, you'll be here through it all

[Chorus: Nelly & Kelly Rowland]
I'd do it all again if I have to, throw this money at you
Girl you know you got me gone
I'd do it all again if I have to, you ain't gotta ask boo
Boy you know you got me gone
Kelly got me gone (she got me), gone, gone (she got me), gone
Girl you know you got me gone
Nelly got me gone (gone), gone (gone), gone, gone (gone)
Boy you know you got me gone
[Break: Kelly Rowland & Nelly]
Boy you know you got me , gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone

[Chorus: Nelly & Kelly Rowland]
I'd do it all again if I have to, throw this money at you
Girl you know you got me gone
I'd do it all again if I have to, you ain't gotta ask boo

Canto,Rebel Diaz,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Fred Hampton]
So we say, we always say in the Black Panther Party
That they can do anything they want to to us
We might not be back, I might be in jail
I might be anywhere
But when I leave, you can remember I said
That the last words on my lips were that
I am a revolutionary!

[Hook]
For the love of revolution
For the life that I lead
Y es por eso que yo canto
Con la familia que yo quiero
For my beautiful niece
Y es por eso que yo canto
For the future of the youth
That remind me of me
Y es por eso que yo canto
Para Chile, for Chicago
For the kids in hallseez (?)
Y es por eso que yo canto
[Verse 1]
I dedicate this to them kids
That remind me of me
Those rebellious motherfuckers
That I call MCs
It's them kids on the corners, in them circles
Spitting rhythms, ripping cyphers
Smoking purples and state(??), they still children
Buying 40s, giving money to the kid with ID
Six heads on one blunt
But they sharing the weed
Fuck school, they told jokes
And they never took notes
All they did was fill their notebooks
With some marvelous flows
Staring out the window
Daydreaming of shows
The limelight
The right life
How they bound to blow
And it's a dream that they all share
Who gonna get there?
I found a reason for my rapping
I ain't gonna fake it
I want a crib for my moms
On the beach in (??)
Y es por eso que yo canto
I want to open up a school
In the Bronx by the river
Y es por eso que yo canto
I'll be happy with a crib
And some land in the back
Y es por eso que yo canto
Sit back, smoke in the air
Dip and cognac
Y es por eso que yo canto
[Verse 2]
Sipping water out the wine glass
Smile on my face
Funny farmers hat on
To keep the sun out my face
I'll be content with teaching children
And building the young struggle
If hip hop organized
The whole world would be in trouble
Bush, run for cover
You be getting bum rushed
We'll get Bambaataa as the President
We all gon' crush
It's graffiti on the wall
But it's not advertising
Just a warning from the youth
About the future uprising
It's not surprising
That we seeking freedom
I don't believe 'em
I'll be happy with a Cavalier
Like my dad drove
A living room with chandeliers
And a matching carpet
I choose to rap cause sometimes
It's my only option
It's my freedom of expression
It's the voice of the oppressed
Y es por eso que yo canto
It's the power of the word
Man, you gotta use it
Y es por eso que yo canto
[Verse 3]
Cause I truly do believe
That I'm the seed of revolution
I rap, therefore I am
Part of the vocal contribution
To the call that's worldwide
Fight the struggle within
Organize, read books
Practice discipline
Use the culture as a weapon
That's unknown to them
Speak slang in a language
That's code to them
Make music, breakdance
Write your name on the wall
Write a paper theorizing
How they killed Biggie Smalls
2Pac and Malcolm X
How they killed them all
Be a leader on the block
You taking over the game
But instead of gangbanging
And acting selfish
You like a Panther in the morning
Serving breakfast

Body slammin' bitches make Dre a bigger man
Khaki sportin' Locs in a G ride

Now this is mo' mean than fo' fiends with Glocks unloading
Scrapping for a bag of gold rings and codeine
Whole life savings hid under the molding
""Mama Said Knock Them Out"" and I'm quoting
You're voting, which you're hoping
Will stop the guns from smoking
Is someone fucking joking?
They're bankers in sheep's clothing
I know places where the kids keep croaking
Lacking the essential vitamins and protein
Hustling and hyphy are eloping
I'm the best man busting shots and toasting
Sipping Grey Goose get clipped off the bird
Come Sunday morning get tripped off the word
TV and them preachers got pimp talking verbs
Setting us up to get ripped off and stirred
You flipped all them birds so your funds act right
Here come the drought whole thang's half price
My high school career counselor's advice:
""Lil' niggas act nice for your beans and rice""
I got some light baby, take it to the head
Who gives a fuck if it's permed or dreads
Never snitch to the locals or the feds
See they tryna break us so they don't have to break bread
Cause Uncle Sam ain't the baker, he's the butcher

My slave name's Ray Riley, you can call me Boots
Cause we gon' boot 'em outta power then spread the loot
We need to drive that freedom train, not ride caboose
And you can tell by the way I walk my walk
That there's a coroner behind me holding chalk
Cause he works for the county who works for the state
Who works for the boss man eating off your plate
We ain't one dimensional, max-detentional
Looking for the liquor store, what them hubbas hitting fo'?
We raised by the street light, praised for the street fight
Days we ain't eat right, hazed to complete life

It's a war going on, the ghetto is a cage
They only give you two choices: be a rebel or a slave

Since my home street days in the blue Buick
Niggas been fighting so long seem like I'm used to it

Pay or quit, it's more of us than the lies your mayor spit

Is you a ""have"" or you a ""have not""?
When you run out of bullets, grab rocks
'Cause the prison don't slam locks
It don't open when your fam knocks

And I know power respect that, so 'serve and protect' that

And even if you a friend of the blue
You can get it too, snitching is never forgettable

And call it freedom
It's a cold game
And it's the same from the top of the food chain
All the way down to the little homie in the street gangs
Slanging cocaine, it's how they do thangs
It's the American way
Imperialism, have it your way
Whatever it takes
Whoever gets fucked in the process, that's okay
That's how they play
So you can't blame us
Them dead white men on that paper ain't us
We still gotta hustle for the benefits, man
My grind is my stimulus plan...

[Outro: legislator]
And my constituents are concerned about
Where the 700 billion dollars is going
They want to know
Because they get up every morning
They work hard
They give up their tax dollars
And they're trying to figure out
Where did the money go?
Where's it going?

If you know your gwan die (why step?)
Show no mercy (when bruising crews)
You get hit with more bricks than New Jerus

So check out how these herbs get touched
(Unless your broads giving us brains), nigga you ain't servin us

(Our true lies break more punks than) Harry Renquist
(Every week) with the best speech
Roll with cats who smoke more trees than the slash and burn techniques

Red fleets, Pulp Fiction style, (leaving your car with red seats)
We make like fly swatters and smash pests

Yo, I hold the record for the most ignorant rhymes said
That’ll knock that cowboy hat off of Imus’ head

Two letters: I’m O.T.; two words: I’m gettin’ money
Two verses: I’m gettin’ twenty
And that’s thousands
Hoo-ridin' through L.A. in a Bronco with Al Cowlings
The head honcho, I’m out browsin’
And I ain’t lookin’ for bulletproof Hummers
Just for bullets that shoot Hummers
And Beamers with moonroofs for the summer
For easy access to jump out poppin’ and turn ya brains to au gratin
Rotten, as a young kid I never was the dude to call
Too busy turnin’ G.I. Joes into voodoo dolls
Put my cigarette out on ya nose
Get blood on my suit? I got a thousand of those
Can’t come close, my discography’s the one with the most
'Cause I appear on more tracks than Dale Earnhardt’s ghost

Smacked wack labels up for bogus shit they released
And when Moses split the seas I jumped the gap on water skis
(Did you look back?) Nah, nothin’ more to see

All that really matters is if your rhymes was ill

Looks like it's gonna be a great day today
To get some fresh air like a stray on a straightaway
Hey you, got a light? Nah, a Bud Light
Early in the morning, face crud from like a mud fight
Looky here, it's just the way the cookie tear
Prepare to get hurt and mangled like Kurt Angle rookie year
The rocket scientist, with the pocket wine list
Some even say he might need some pus-sychiatrist
DOOM, are you pondering what I'm pondering?
Yes, but why would the darn thing be wandering?
She's like a foundling, barely worth fondling
My posse's on Broadway like Mama, I Want to Sing!
Mad plays the bass like the race card
Villain on the case to break shards and leave her face scarred
Groovy, dude! Not to prove to be rude
But this stuff is like what you might put on movie food
Uh, what is jalapeños?
Get it like a whoopin' when you holla at your seniors
Dolla he can overhear the hashish fienda
He just came from over there, the grass is greener
Last wish: I wish I had two more wishes
And I wish they fixed the door to the matrix, there's mad glitches
Spit so many verses sometimes my jaw twitches
One thing this party could use is more... ahem
Booze, put yourself in your own shoes
And stay away from all those pairs of busted Timbs you don't use
He only keep 'em to decorate
If you wanna peep 'em, select a date
And bring a deep check, like checkmate
I kid you not, on the dotted line signed
Ever since a minor, kids considered him some kind of Einstein
On a diamond mine grind,  she was dumb fine
But not quite the type that you might want to wine and dine
Couldn't find a pen, had to think of a new trick
This one he wrote in cold blood with a toothpick
On second thought it's too thick
His assistant said: ""DOOM, you sick,"" he said ""True"" through acoustics
Psycho, his flow is drowned in Lawry's seasoning
With micro power he's sound and right reasoning
It's easy as pi, three-point-one-four
One more one false move and they're done for—"

I'm taking back what's mine

Even if I die, I'm gon' be a fuckin problem
Do you believe in ghosts, motherfucker?
Real live black... ghosts
Feel me?

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Some say I'm crazy, these punk-ass cops can't fade me
Mama tried to raise me, but had too many babies
Papa was a motherfuckin, joke
Used to find dope in his coat
And nearly choked when he'd tell me not to smoke
Daaamn, don't get me started
My mama smoked so goddamn much
When she was pregnant I'm surprised I ain't retarded
At night I can't sleep, count sheep
As they pass through the glass of my neighbors five deep
Starin at the wall, heard a scream
Wake up in the mornin'
See the blood in the hall from the murder scene
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
On the corner, where the niggas slang they crack
And the undercovers jack those that don't watch they back
(Five-0) I daydream about the dope world
Take a puff from the blunt and watch the smoke swirl
My mossberg goes BOOM, what's another plug
Snatchin drugs, pumpin' slugs in these other thugs
(GIVE IT UP NIGGA) Don't run out of breath
Every step could be death 'til you blast
And be the last nigga left, then I'll be ghost

Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die

A seven-deuce full of niggas goes by
Thought I was trippin' the second time they rolled, by
Recognized the plates, the faces looked familiar
Everybody swear they know the nigga that's gonna, kill ya
Don't murder me murder me, kill a nigga in his sleep
Let me die as I rest in peace, deep
Back to these niggas in the seven-deuce
A Mac-10 out the window bout to let it loose, what could I do
Run for cover and return fire
DIE MOTHERFUCKIN DIE, hope your ass fry, don't ask why
But I let off everything I have
An empty clip, hit the ground as a nigga dash
On my ass was the motherfuckin cops now
Barely breathin tryin to keep from gettin shot down
BOO-YAOW is the sound, bullet whizzed by
Still runnin like a nigga got nine lives
Don't know why but I'm running to my fucking block
Took a shot, tired of running from the niggas and the cops
Time to be a ghost

And then we'll be ghost

The handcraft of a master, the flicker, the flame

Monster mash, prop for what? From S.O.B
Shout to Honeycomb, what would I be without wax?
Just another empty battery shell in the pack
String on the puppet, laughin', claimin' I'm all of that
When I know in fact, everything you claim is all crap

Yo, got the fuse lit, keepin' it movin', so
Freakin' abusive, people are pukin', so
Sick of the music, suckin' the fumes in
So don't get it confused, I'm not you, stupid
Hundred-proof booze in the back, all tipsy
Bring two clips, I'm clappin' all sixty
Swing through quick and bust if one's empty
Your chances of leavin' the club fifty fifty

[Verse 3: Apathy]
Wanna fuck around with Hell's recruits?
I'll stomp Satan in his face 'till it melts my boots
I'll use the sun for my throne, universe as my home
And your skull as a crown to adorn my dome
Watch porn with your girl, slip a mickey in her Becks
Put a hickey on her neck, then the titties I caress
Under matchin' Vickie set's, I'm the one that chickies sweat
Make 'em suck it 'till their jaw's fucked up like 50 Cent's
Most of you faggots stay postin' that jacked shit
But when we retaliate, it's never some rap shit
Swing on your mandible and bring out mechanical
Devices that splices flesh from the intangible
I spark fire like electrical shocks
And ready the Glocks, to clash with Connecticut cops
You're on some Brad Pitt shit, so you better go watch
The movie Seven, cause you'll find your wife's head in a box

Rush you bustas, get touched with nunchucks
You tough tough, askin' to really get fucked up
Who cares what you been through? I'm goin' against you, so
Sharpen your skills while I sharpen my Ginsu
Gas and ashes, and medical kits, but see
That's what happens when chemicals mix
The birth of a strange creature, umbilical split
But for now, the main feature, you said it was sick

[Verse 5: Celph Titled]
The word on the streets is that I'm hellbound, cause I bully Christians
But I stay up in the armory, developin' pulley systems
For launchin' grenades strategically, onstage with heaters illegally
Got the sound man shook at my vocal frequency
Back at the crib, bitch better strap on a bib
Cause when I'm bustin' off, it's drippin' off the tip of her chin
Chickens and hens, you know I keep 'em bendin' over for me
With my chef hat, stuffin' poultry on the upholstery
Celph Titled's known as a gangsta to some
I got the powers of the gods, acclimated to one
All these young cats with Glocks, tryin' to clear the floor
I'm old school, when I'm pullin' out my Fearless Four
Hear the sound of the clap? Bury your face
Cause the mag that I pack needs a carryin' case
I'm not from the Aryan race, but I'll still persecute you
Ride around in the trunk with a little hole to shoot through
[Verse 6: Ryu]
I'm ""Word Perfect,"" back in the circuit
Been, top ten since you were snatchin' purses
Golf club thug, a nickel and dime hustler
All them mob flicks are makin' you rhyme tougher
When the nine clicks, you freeze
Two sick emcees, get cool quick when I'm shootin' the breeze
Who's this? Ryu and Tak, with Ap and Celph
Spittin' heat 'till the plastic melt, watch it

Claim you wanna stay, but you have to go
Grab the gun powder, blast the Calico
Time to saddle up, this ain't a talent show
You wanna battle what? Bullets that travel slow

Blunts for fingers and hollow tips for teeth
Wiretaps for ears; Nike Airs for feet
Blasphemy for prayers; the system for a heart
Rap music for beats; heroin for the son
And he's married to the streets; crack pipes for lungs
And he never sleeps, just spies with dice in his eyes
Love life, 'cause he like when it dies
With baking soda soul he cough up pleasure
Clothes made out of dollar bills that he sewed together
He knows he's clever, jail is his house
All the liquor that pours out and goes right in his mouth
Rides around on a stray bullet with prostitutes
Pimps, dope dealers and killers tied to it to pull it
TV in his head, strippers slide down his legs
And he known to ride around with the Feds
He's out there, out there, out there, out there, out there, [?]

Don't call me Ghost no more, call me The Phantom
Real brothers love [?] street brothers understand him
This is to the man with his hand on his Cannon
Right at this moment, I know we need an atonement
But Malcolm is dead, and Martin is dead
The gun is the barber, let me know who want a part in their head
And I'm back to the clip, filled the top, ill grill with a bop
Police comin' through, kids steal a rock
I don't give an F, like I wanna die
'cause I'm gon' die, you too, figure, don't boo who, figure
Wanna play the game, find out whose who, figure
After you do that, find out whose true, figure
Lot of brothers died over BS, nonsense

Gotta learn the rules real fast, move fast
Stand up and mash [?] know that you ass

Drag them and their corporates to their own battle
Instead of sending us to the slaughter like cattle
Me and the whole unit we will start to ramshackle
Listen very closely you can hear the fire crackle
You could weigh the air which he was breathing out his nostrils
Couldn't understand why we were seeming so hostile
Said ""we spread democracy"" like he was preaching gospel
Slapped him in his head and said ""Now shut up, Sergeant Roscoe!""
If this is not explicit, lemme tell ya straight out

Then bathe in water I wouldn't drink before gasoline

Inhuman super malice for GOP uber alles
Baby suicide bombers hurdle suitcases in a nursery

Then try to wash it down with a two dollar bottle of water
Get on the train and think of terrorists with box cutters
Gun concealer cause I see a realer reality
And what I breathe through my nasal cavities, killing my batteries
Bombs in metropolis, out all eye sockets
Esophagus melted out some shiite group will get their props for this

Cops tape the scene up, gunner downs 9
They're chasing away kids playing hop-scotch in this chalk outline
Two F-16's, screech an iridescent sky
Look down, we're not in Iraq, we're in N.Y
Rats in the streets, we move underground like earthworms
Two coasts couldn't abort Satan in his first term
The army in the subway, walking with toolies
I'm on the train with the back of the dollar bill still talking to me
Drive with my left, I know what's right - my weapon hand
Like the map of DC streets still shows a pentagram
License on the car window when I pass through
You've seen the news, no joke, New York pig department will blast you
My Weathermen party is invite only, soldier
Cause with one wave of King G. Dub's scepter it's over
The right to assemble puts the bureau's team on you
Look into my file and nod to this while Jello screams on you

[Outro: Jello Biafra as George W. Bush]
By our efforts we have lit a fire in the minds of men
It warms those who feel its' power, it burns those who fight its' progress
And one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world
It is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth
Of democratic movements and institutions in every nature and culture
With the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world
Except right here at home! Hee-hee-hee-hee!
Yee-Haw!
Don't mess with Texas! (x4)
Connie...Connie, give me some pretzels
Mommy, mommy, give me that bible
Give me that bible with the pages cut out and it got that cocaine in it
C'mon, c'mon, don't mess with Texas!
(snorting sounds)
I'll fuck anything that moves!"
Realized,Lil Wayne,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
What?
What?!
Look-
Okay, let's cut the crap
I'm straight gangsta - forget the rap
I only stick with that cause my ma don't wan' see me flip the crack
And I'm quick to click and spit the gat
I be dipped in black
Sip the Coke mixed with Jack - Calico, clip to match
Like: where them cats who trippin' at? - Point niggas out
Cause right now I'm full of that spinach that'll knock Lennox out
The Mack-10 is out, as well as the gauge and the pump
You turn the page on the newspaper, see my face in the front
I lock it down for all my niggas that still caged in the dump
So if I come, nigga, just save me a blade and a pump
I'm raised in the slum where the bad grow
Unlike no other, I'm real gutta like bad bowls
I stash O's in the drawers of my trash hoes
I flash dough at the laws when they pass slow
I mash low in a stolen hot RAV-4
The Macks blow bullet holes for my cash flow
Is that so?
[Chorus]
I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all
If you don't get the hell when he swervin' by
That's your issue - God bless ya - you deserve to die

[Verse 2]
Look
Which one of these niggas playin' with me?
I'mma strap up and slam his parent's street
When I blast, bullets spit faster than MC Hammer beats
I be damned if he get a chance to sleep
I clamp the magazine in my gun and cut his family tree
I flash the piece at your lil' woman and make her dance for me
Then jam the freak with a broom - blood leak from her panty crease
There has to be some explanation for this insanity
Yeah, y'all niggas faker than that boy (fill in the blank)
Now give me the dank
Niggas claim they want war when I suggest you live in a tank
What's your kid gonna think?
Come home and find your wig in the sink
I dig in the bank, and pull out eighty, then cruise to Haiti
For fifty G's I get ten ki's and straight out weight it
I lock my area down - you can ask these boys
They know Weezy got more white than the Backstreet Boys
Never catch me unattatched without them plastic toys
It get drastic, boy
Niggas that's askin' for it
Weezy, nigga
It's Weezy, nigga
Who? Weezy, nigga
It's Weezy, nigga
[Chorus]
I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all
And if you don't get the hell when he swervin' by
That's your issue - God bless ya - you deserve to die

[Verse 3]
I hope y'all niggas understand that I ain't playin' or jokin'
Bust shots, make you think the Grand Canyon open
Leave a busta bandana smokin' from hot hollows
Me and my niggas flip your coke, then cop hot hoes
Two pistols, desperado gun busta
Pump one under your chest and knock a lung from ya
Hung under them killers and duck the pigs
And all of our diamonds shine, and our trucks are big
And, nigga, I don't really care if I don't sell a million quick
Cause right now I'll quit and go and sell a million bricks
I sticks to what I love, and that's the street
And stay away from what I hate, and that's police
And I keep a trigga somewhere on me to start blowin'
And leave a nigga somewhere lonely with his heart showin'
When we all knowin' that Weezy have never been fake
The metal will spray and let the bullets tear up your face
Who want this Weezy, nigga? Who want this Weezy, nigga?
Weezy, nigga; Lil Weezy, nigga
[Chorus]
Say, I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all
Say, I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all

Soul Plane,Cam'ron,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Cam'Ron]
....I could tell you how a female fake a nut for a relationship
Or how a nigga fake a relationship for a nut
How a smart nigga can play stupid but a stupid nigga can't play smart
But I'd rather just tell you about me and the things I do...You ready baby?

[Verse 1: Cam'Ron]
Got the fiends dancin, like Soul Train
Stamp on the dope, Soul Plane
They losin hair, get em Rogaine
Sell Kung-Fu, nothin like Coltrane
To keep you informed, won't catch em in a uniform
Before that, you'll see a unicorn
I blew the horn
Two girls hopped in
Oh-ten nine-eleven, homie I'm boxed in
Don't start a mess, Ima architect
Ya bum ass shirt stink, it need Carpet Fresh
White tee, Louis jeans, my Audemar the best
Two chains, hat, please don't disregard the specs
They from Switzerland, boy-boy I gits it in
Money all around the world where you niggas friends?
Actually, factually, a car you livin in
I'm three times coke baby, I need the dividends
[Bridge]

[Verse 2: Vado]
As I'm sittin on this mailbox
Waitin for my bitch to leave the nail shop
Auntie lookin at me like I sell rock
Point-blank range, call it shell-shock
I, started off makin ounce moves
Was invited to a dinner with The Council
Two-piece, black rose on my brown suit
In two weeks, I was eatin with my mouth full
In the streets like the seventies
Long Cadillacs, bumpin Frankie Beverly
Mama known to work and go to church faithfully
I ain't gotta ask, every day she pray for me
She knew soon I'd be seven up
By the window like X with my weapon up
Fuck ya intro I'm the next best gunner up
Stand in first place with my medal yous a runner-up

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Cam'Ron]
Niggas runnin around, wit street dreams
Til I put em to sleep - Sweet dreams!
I played dirty, so I keep clean
The back of Deleanor is where I meet fiends
Got the whole plate, you don't have three beans
Did Eighth with a eighth in Lee jeans
Tonight, got the chauffeur
Showin off the loafers
You cowards: turkeys, the bullets: Stouffer's
[Verse 4: Vado]
Dom P, Cliq, and Rose
Fruit bowls, few hoes, on the Dolce
OG's round the table but I won't say
Let's make a toast to everyone on the coke chase
Coupe rose, two-tone, parked with no plates
You too close, you gotta ask, can you approach me?
I told em sports wasn't my forte
How can I be like you, and get all this dope cake?

[Outro: Vado]
Let me know, you feel me right?
Live niggas know the game its sad but they ain't got the change to play it
You talk a good one, but are you good son?
Keep it real wit ya self
Before you end up dealin wit ya health, man
You know me, Vado!"

Slipped up on some major mail then went back to jail on major bail yo

Man most cats they dont play cuz their mom get high
I can still recall the day I saw a gangsta cry

Dont b no perpatrator
Fuk around b on a respirator
Goin up to heaven on a escalator
Cuz they sent u to hell on a ellavator yo
Rite in front of corner stores with the 4 5 slugs
Some might say its u or me
But their ain't no luv
Crack a smile like a beer bottle
Dont worry bout the bullet cuz it feels hollow
Keep ur foot on the gas throttle
Thez motha fukas ain't no role models
Blow ur mind with an evil disguise
Wiggin this nigga rite in front of ur eyes
Were he got shot thats were he lies
Layin there dead with open eyes
Blow u over on a street corner
Its all about that b soda
Braken arms and shoulders
Cuz this drama is thick as quotas
They busted u and u bust back
And just like a whipe u gonna snap back
How they gonna fuck with u fuck that
Kill them all so they dont come back
Mind state
Crime rate
Hell waits but jail baits
Man if u make a mistake dont even wait

So mutha fuka its a dirty shame

[Verse 1: Legacy]
She said it's funny how these young boys killing her
And they ain't got that long stroke, so I Reggie Miller'd her
She put it in my face I'ma eat that hungry
Made her come so many times she needed gas money
Girl, I fetus that tummy, all up in it
Got a tight grip so I never fall up in it
Michael Myers killing the kitty, I think I kinda like her
And her body blazing, I got her wetter than a fire fighter
Ain't no off switch for me, it's like a tattoo
Girl, I'm a beast on the half moon
I am iller than it may seem, they all say that I'm amazing
When I'm in there she be shaking, it's like making love to Haiti
And she all up in my head like an mp3
Then I hit it hit it hit it like an MPC
Based on that plot she give me 2 thumbs down before she test it
But the climax was epic
[Hook]

[New Boyz]
I felt that 100 lil' mama like to get it
She like it when I hit that g spot, come and kick it
I put it down and spin her body like the ones and twos
We going hard knocking boots like it's 92
Looking in her eyes, hands strolling up against her thighs
Thinking bout 'Becky' cause the radio just played Plies
Now my song is on and she getting her orgasm on
Taking over the stage and speak into my microphone
Baby get it wet like I just fell in a river
This skinny nigga hungry your body is for dinner
And then I go dddd... to sleep
And you don't hear nothing but that private water leak
Sounds good don't, it yea you messing with some freaks
That you down and you see that your a legend from the beasts
Got a jungle in my room, take a journey through my sheets
Got you feeling so good, climaxing to the beats

All my LA girls put your hands up
And all my ATL girls put your hands up

Sharp Darts,The Streets,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: Mike Skinner]
Sharp darts, spitting masters, spitting darts faster
Shut up, I'm the driver, you're the passenger
Bar brain's superior, the pressure blows the dial on your barometer
Do you understand or do you need an interpreter?

Now, my style is distinguished, all fires are extinguished
Ask your girl to sing and she'll sing this, I'm a scientist
Have no prejudice, that's my hypothesis
Make your analysis, ever heard a beat like this?
I walk the beat like a policeman, no karma pedestrian
In five-hundred years, they'll play this song in museums
I'm the bold adventurer, the UK's ambassador
Holding up Excalibur, your beats are inferior
Don't wanna embarrass ya, so call your solicitor
The jury voted unanimously against ya

Shut up, I'm the driver, you're the passenger

Now this one's fat like your mother, contains enough calories
Resonating all your favourite frequencies
I've got a worldwide warranty, satisfaction guarantee
If you ain't happy then just send it right back to me
'Spec to BC, it's time to fuck loyalty
One day, I hope to earn some hard royalties
From a bit of sample robbery, hook burglary
Noise thievery or wholesale piracy
So watch your back, I'm inclined to sample
I'll dismantle and make you all examples

Same Old Thing,The Streets,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Mike Skinner]

'Round here, nothing seems to change (At street level)
Same old thing every day (That's it, that's it, that's it)

Whose round is it?
Down that beer quick, smash my glass back down
Fall over the table, all rowdy and pissed
Seems the only difference between midweek shit
And weekend is how loud I speak
And whether I try and pull a girlfriend, that's it
Who's got dough?
Ayy, you know I'd pay, but I'm broke, only got coinage to show
Putting off walking home on my own to my throne
Two empty takeaways, ashtrays, the remains of the day stoned
Pick a bottle off the table, peel the label, tell a fable
Offer opinion for free on a solution to the latest big news story
""Football and Smut Daily"" as I ponder winning the lottery
Buy a drink, chat to a lady, the girl's well fit
Definitely, not maybe, she's rude
I'd shag her and make tea, right there
[Chorus: Kevin Mark Trail & Mike Skinner]
'Round here, nothing seems to change (At street level)
Same old thing every day (That's it, that's it, that's it)

Can't lounge in the boozer all day, got manoeuvres to make
Gotta see a man about a dog, can't be late, I'm always late
Raining cats and fog, but nice and dry in the Black Dog
Down it in one, my son
Can't sit here, gotta run, things need done
If they don't win this and the next one
They're getting relegated to the third division
At street level, real people, same repeated sequel
Rock and roll, four to the floor
Like last night, yesterday morning
And the night before, and the night before

Apparently
There's a whole world out there somewhere (It's right there)
I just don't see it (Right there)
I just don't see it (Oi, oi)

You feel so good
Rest of my life I wish I could
Hold you tight and take a flight out the hood
Was I foul or just misunderstood?
Mild-mannered or up to no-good
It really doesn't matter, either way I should
Maximize the moment and hold ya close
Jump in the drop Spider and cruise down the coast
Who loved you the most?
I was never ghost
When lives was on the line
Confusion in ya mind
Runnin outta time
Drama of all kind
But there's faith in our mind
We're spiritually inclined
Sometimes I flip
Sometimes you flip
Sometimes we wild out and act like lunatics
We movin too fast, the whole world's in a rush

The people we meet, the hands that we shake
Whether its Morton's or Sizzler steak
But everything will be okay
If we do it my way, my way, my way
Cuz I believe in romance
Kissin while ya slow dance
Me bouncin baby? no chance
No matter the circumstance
Whatever it takes gurl, I'll swim to France
Cuz ya beauty's unmatched

Unconditional love, forever we are attached
Deal with the drama, we can find our way back
With or without the Maybach

Popping when she wasn't looking
I guess it runs in the family

Save the greenery
I'm looking for them labels reading
May cause drowsiness be careful when operating machinery
Beautiful pharmaceuticals
Residue in my cuticles
Sniffing them when its suitable
Wishing they made 'em chewable

A couple meds to ease the pain of the papercuts

40 milligrams, a 40 and im faded

Yeah yeah, it's a new year
Hip Hop Weekly baby, we made it to 40
Hahaha, yes sir
Let's go
Can I talk to you?
I ain't gon' rap to y'all right now
I'm a talk to you
We call this talkin', haha
Start this year off right you know what I mean?
Yeah, let's start the year off right
It's 08 baby, we gon' begin 08 by puttin' some perspective in the air
You know? Yeah lemme holla at y'all man
It might sound like a rap, but I'm talkin' to you
It ain't a rap, I'm talkin' to you
Here we go, lemme talk, yo

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
Yo, I'm drawin' pictures with every word that I'm usin'

Draw what you never saw while you draw your own conclusions
The world is crazy, look at the news it's confusion
And rebel views that I'm usin' in my music ain't for amusement
I let the words from my heart penetrate mics
Change the hood and I change, cuz art imitates life
Dog, I don't think your bark demonstrates bite
How ironic, we don't view the dark in the same light
I see yo' press people, packin' them Des Eagles
You see some evil doers who ain't makin' they bread legal
I see a whole country that was stolen from the red people
The whole press a treat us lesser even though we bled equal
That's why I love my shows, smiling faces from different races in the crowd
And it ain't a racist in the crowd
We raisin' the roof so high, the stage is in the clouds
Then it's back to the hood, where the racism is proud
Prejudice police wanna throw my crew in that Patty
Wagon, cuz we get our sag on, and hustle gladly
Momma say my father rocked jewelry and drove a Caddy
So even though he didn't raise me I'm stuntin' like my daddy
I'm buyin' diamonds with dough, I ice my cream
Know you consumers love hooks I'm doin' it like Kareem
Yeah, been in more crossfires than Chrysler's team
First I dream of what I recite then I recite my dreams
Listen, cuz dreams are real as the air we breathe
They put us in a good place, how dare we leave
Through the door of success the selfish barely squeeze
I kick the door open, make spares then I share these keys
It's hard work tryin' to chase whatever's considered to glitter
Nigga, it ain't no failures only quitters and bullshitters
So long before ""Rest in Peace"" is etched on my stone
Nigga, I bet I stay cross-legged out west on the throne
You heard it, the boss said it, one of the best spitters known
That vision is prophetic, yes, let's get it on, yes
I've been there before that's why I know what I'm doin'
I'm a old soul, older than ancient Minoan ruins
I was buried under volcanic ash, then I rose
Dusted off my clothes, first words I spoke, is ""where the hoes?""
Back then I had golden threads woven in my robes
Now I hear ""bling blaow"" from diamonds glowin' in my lobes
I'm mind bafflin', time travelin' on all you losers
I'm presently the best and I'll make history in the future
[Outro: Crooked I]
Yeah, y'all know what it is
You know what we doin' right?
C-O motherfuckin' B ho
Treacherous
And I'm on the West Coast
My name is Crooked I thanks for listenin', yeah
I was just talkin' to ya today
It might of sound like rappin'
But it was really talkin'

If I can't work to make it, I'll rob and take it
Either that or me and my children are starving and naked
Rather be a criminal pro than to follow The Matrix
Hey, it's me, the monster y'all done created, I been inaugurated
Keep the bright lights out of our faces
You can't shake it; it ain't no way to swallow the hatred
Aim, fire, holler 'bout a dollar, nothing is sacred
We gon' pimp the shit out of nature
Send our troops to get my paper
Tell 'em, ""Stay away from them skyscrapers
Ain't long 'fore you get y'all acres""
I'ma show 'em who the glo-bal gangster
Sentence me to four more years, thank you
I'ma make you feel a little bit safer, because it ain't over—
See, that's how we get your fear to control you
But ain't nobody under more control than the soldier
And how could you expect a kid to keep his composure
When all sorts of thoughts fought for exposure again?

Aw yeah! You know the bassline in the background, baby!
New Orleans, you know what time it is? (Buck jump time!)

[Hook]
That Calliope (Buck jump time!)
That Melpomene (Buck jump time!)
Magnolia (Buck jump time!)
St. Thomas (Buck jump time!)
Lafitte (Buck jump time!)
That Iberville (Buck jump time!)
Desire (Buck jump time!)
That Fischer (Buck jump time!)

[Verse 1]
Listen to the rhymes back-to-back
That I wrote for the project rap
This rap is wild, a number one hit
When you ever heard a rapper bust like this?
Uptown, Third Ward, that Calliope
Melpomene, Magnolia, the home of dope
St. Thomas, Lafitte, the Iberville's hard
And that Seventh Ward St. Bernard
The Fischer from that one point five
Where the brothers at from that wild Desire?
Where the Floridas at? Y'all ready to roll?
Where that wild buck jumping going Hollygrove
Gert Town, Pigeon Town
Seabrook -- this whole city throws down
That Uzi Ward, jack rope and geese(?) symbolizes New Orleans East
Them brothers wild, they don't give you a chance
Jumped everybody at the St. Mary's dance
Brothers go to popping, you're running like stallions
Ahhh ahhh! Pop, he got your medallion
Remember St. Mary's dance? Please!
Brothers used to be hopping out of trees
Wild horde New Orleans lord
I heard they kicking colors in the St. Bernard
The point behind this whole rap
This city is cold as any other on the map
New York this, California that
Forget that talk, this is where it's at
They're talking bout California like it's so dope
Let me see Cali walk through the Calliope
The projects, Wards, all on time
New Orleans number one in this rhyme
New Orleans!
New Orleans!
New Orleans!
New Orleans!

New Orleans number one and you know that's true
And if you disagree, forget you!

[Interlude]
All right, since we got y'all bucking
Y'all know the usual, you better look for the nearest zone
Cause this dance is about to get wild
We're gonna find out what Ward is kicking it, y'all

That Third Ward kicking it? Hell yeah!
That Fifth Ward kicking it? Hell yeah!
That Seventh Ward kicking it? Hell yeah!
That Eighth Ward kicking it? Hell yeah!
That Ninth Ward kicking it? Hell yeah!
That Tenth Ward kicking it? Hell yeah!
That Twelfth Ward kicking it? Hell yeah!
That Seventeenth kicking it? Hell yeah!

All right, check this out! You know what we looking for?
Check this out everybody -- it's time to get wild
Where's that Uzi Ward?

I Dont Care,The Roots,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook x2: Dom]
I don't care, as long as the bassline's pumpin'
The drumline bangin' away
Make one move and I'll blow you away
One false move and I'll blow you away

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yo, I don't really know but somebody said
That the O.G. flow, it could fuck witcha head
And the po-lice know that the green black and red
Too strong to con-trol, they study what I said
Dig it my name is 'Riq, and when I'm on the mic
I'm known to spit somethin that these MC's hate
I couldn't care less what you feel, what you say
'Cause I gotta put it to you in my own special way
I'm a MONSTER!
You know I'm certified sick
I came from the corner where nobody got shit
Took the cards I was dealt, turned it into hot spit
Now I'm not only a passenger, I'm in the cockpit
Been a long time comin', I was caught in the scramble
Of cats, tryin' to do the same thing that they man do
Eagles born to fly, rivers made to ramble
""A Dangerous Mind"", I'm a prime example
[Hook x2: Dom]

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Super-fans wanna run up on me sparkin' the ground up
You need to fall back, could be NARC's around us
You in a hot area for marchin' powder
If you holdin' chowder, just walk without it
Them real crook brothers don't talk about it
They never make a move 'til they thought shit out, kid
I knew a lot of men who did bids for mayhem
They made a lot of money, they money never made them
The game of survival is filled with rivals
Knives and fo'-five slugs flyin' in spirals
The wicked is diseased and it ain't all viral
Could be greed and gluttony bubblin' inside you
Dawg, follow your pride, the rhythm'll guide you
Yo, follow them guys, them niggas'll rob you
And have you up in somethin' that don't really involve you
But you don't give a fuck, you wanna pump the volume, I know

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Yo, aiyyo, the waistline thumpin', the face kinda jumpin'
The game lookin' sweeter than a bassline bumpin'
Don't come 'round these parts and waste time frontin'
Them trick-ass marks'll get the eight-five dumpin'
It ain't really 'bout nothin'
Philly just love cuttin'
They shut shit down before the law start shuttin'
Get your route right, cousin
Be out nightclubbin', relaxed
And wanna get lights out tonight brother, perhaps
It's the percussion that keeps shit, kinetic
For some it ain't as fame, more sweet the street credit
Some cats that play dirty didn't live, to regret it
But move to the music, he can live through the record
I'm a Philly boss player, a dope rhyme sayer
It's Black Ink back, gettin' cake by the layer
By the stack, comin' at us, get your weight right, yeah
If not, you makin' a mistake right there, for real

This ain't where you wanna be, then she can leave, beat your feet
On every beat I go honey-baked ham, I'm a beast
If it's beef, leave you shiftless, laying on the street
Is it hot in this mothafuckin' booth or is it me?
Me and Jazze Pha go way back like Jazz and T
Smoking weed in a leaf, bitches sweat me like I'm Keith
There's a very strong smell coming out the VIP

Got a Fleet, I can't bring one out, I drive 'em by the three
In a league of my own, he don't own a pair of cleats

He say he go as hard as me, tell him that I wanna see
Do six months, then get out and spend 2 million in a week

White Flag Warrior,Flobots,"['rock', 'hip hop', 'r&b', 'metal', 'alternative']","[Intro: Jonny 5]
We request to negotiate
We come to you unarmed
We desire to communicate
You cannot do us harm

[Verse 1: Jonny 5, Brer Rabbit]
They want sacrifice
They have schemes and ask me to follow their path to the afterlife
I've got an appetite
For nice things and pipe dreams that my enemies could be blasted by
New metaphors
Views that are better for you can't survive or find your competitor
Rise together or fight separate wars
I pray I'm never forced to be a predator
Spectres spectate we won't last
They're glad to hate when gladiators breathe their last
Scream en masse when the dreams do clash
Like swords in the war, let me bleed on that
But they feed on that, say we need strong backs
Call us weak and don't redeem contracts
But the feast won't last when this beast attacks
The sons and the fathers will be free at last
[Pre-Chorus: Tim McIlrath, Jonny 5]
(This is love, this is not treason)
(This is love, it's not treason)
(This is love, it's not treason)
(This is love, it's not treason)
(This is love) They see sharks in the estuary
(It's not treason) They claim the ark is Bartholomew's
(This is love) They say war is necessary
(It's not treason) But we say war is child abuse

[Chorus: Tim McIlrath, Jonny 5]
We'd rather make our children (We request to negotiate)
Martyrs than murderers (We come to you unarmed)
We'd rather make our children (We desire to communicate)
White Flag Warriors (You cannot do us harm)

[Verse 2: Brer Rabbit, Jonny 5]
Core-to-core, we're the ones we've been waiting for
We hold steady, steadier than stevedores
Not tevias or matadors, on matters of what came before
Forgive the debts and settle scores
And test the mettle, either/or
What's your plan go to do with me?
If the bell tolls, let freedom ring
And find the new ways if we must be king
Instead of leading the young to our suffering, huh
We pass testaments down scream back at heaven
For testing us like Wednesday's at 11
Want to recruit and train us to act evilly
Save it for the shooting range, and smack DVDs
Won't study war no more this millennium
It's never again for me or anyone
So think harder when you refer to us
Rather make our children martyrs than murderers
[Pre-Chorus: Tim McIlrath, Jonny 5]
(This is love, this is not treason)
(This is love, it's not treason)
(This is love, it's not treason)
(This is love, it's not treason)
(This is love) They shell dwellings to quell the shillings
(This is not treason) And lift taboos to seduce the cowards
(This is love) They say we're too yellow bellied
(This is not treason) But we say we're the new superpower

[Chorus: Tim McIlrath, Jonny 5]
We'd rather make our children (We request to negotiate)
Martyrs than murderers (We come to you unarmed)
We'd rather make our children (We desire to communicate)
White Flag Warriors (You cannot do us harm)

[Bridge: Tim McIlrath, Jonny 5]
(This is love) We seek ways to not be liable
(This is not treason) We claim to speak for a higher truth
(This is love) We stand opposed to the homicidal
(This is not treason) We tell you you are fireproof

[Chorus: Tim McIlrath, Jonny 5]
We'd rather make our children (We request to negotiate)
Martyrs than murderers (We come to you unarmed)
We'd rather make our children (We desire to communicate)
White Flag Warriors (You cannot do us harm)
White Flag
Warriors
We'd rather make our children
We'd rather make our children
We'd rather make our children (Do what you want to our courage)
We'd rather make our children (Ask us what you will)
(Demand from us a sacrifice)
(But do not make us kill)"

High School Party Live,Bo Burnham,['pop'],"This next song is a, uh, first-hand account

[Verse 1]
High school party, senior year
Boys and girls they're all sipping on beer
I like soda, where’s the soda?
Am I the only fucking person here that likes soda?
I see you from across the crowd
I said the party is bumping and the music is loud
You’re really drunk and you’re looking sad
It’s like a date rape ad
Girl, then we start to dance and
Girl, baby this is romance
Girl, I’m starting to grow down below
Shit, why did I wear sweat pants?
Girl, your body's like what
Conjunction junction, that’s a fine ass but
I’m like a cashew in a lollipop
Just keeping sucking till you get to the nut
And I said let’s rob an Asian kitchen, or stroll down the block
Either way girl, we’re taking a walk/wok
You’re going to love me the way my uncle did
Except you’re not gonna to go to court for doing it
Be a guillotine or my girl instead
Either way, I said you’re giving me head
I’m gonna love you, baby, the right way
Shawty with a body looking hotty when I say
Girl
We go into the bedroom exchanging nervous laughter
Why’s it called dry humping if I always need a towel after?
You spread your naked legs and I see that wound that never healed
Even though you’re yelling for me, I can tell your lips are sealed (I've been around)
We’re both aware of my erection
You ask if I have protection
I say ""No. I mean, I tried to buy 'em once I was in the convenience store, my old baby sitter walked in, I had to hide them near the Tic-Tacs. I was so embarrassed, I peed myself a little bit.""
[Break]
Girl
Girl

[Verse 2]
Insert a euphemism
A sexy mental prism
Increase my pelvic rhythm
Fill you with my syllogism
I know your body and I know how to please you
Don’t thank me, thank Wikipedia
Guys don’t go down, well I am
What the fuck is that
I should have brought my diagram
Ooh, did you feel that
That was an educated guess
Ooh yeah, did you feel that
That one was a sneeze, my bad
I'm allergic to one type of cat
High school party, senior year
None of that happened 'cause I wasn’t invited"
Box Chevy 3,Yelawolf,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Yelawolf and I feel like a king in my box Chevy
Tell them other wack muthafuckas to get they pine box ready
Catfish Billy is deadly, don't get slapped with the medley
Still sippin' on Jack D to my neck and my head start feelin' heavy
Doin' one-twenty five down I-29
Really think I need to start slowin' down
But I can't 'cause I got a pretty little blonde thing
Sittin' to my right that's blowin' me now
Oh yeah, she's headin' me
I think her name might be Becky
I was about to drop her off
But I had to switch lanes to get the brain she begged me
Aww naw, do you come in twos?
Please choose a couple of friends that could hop in and cruise
Now we goin' steady, but I'm not lookin' for longevity
Pipes in the back, the lights of the night reflect sights through the dash, I'm nice to ride pass

[Hook: Yelawolf]
My wheels are super clean, paint job it glitters and gleams
And I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats
My box Chevy
This whip is built for queens and you wanna be seen with a king
Well I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats

Tilted off Jim Beam, sittin' low, to the side I lean
And I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats

[Verse 2: Rittz]
Fuck a limousine, I'd rather ride Caprices
My speakers vibrate the concrete beneath us
Ridin' 85 northbound, shakin' doors down
So I turn the speakers louder, pissin' off polices
Fuck a five-star chick, got a pornstar bitch
Ridin' shotgun with me, gettin' so wet
Now she goin' down on me givin' roadhead
Bustin' on her forehead then I take her back to the homestead
Peace, back in the Caprice took a sack of weed
And crumpled it inside a cognac blunt wrap
Then it's time to jump back on the highway 85
Slumpin' in my seat like I'm hunchback
And my Chevy lookin' so dope
Old school Vogues on it got it floatin' like a rowboat
Gold flakes in the candy paint drippin' on the road
Drivin' slow like a mothafuckin' showboat, ho
Don't act like you don't hear me comin'
I got the Willis Drummond and it's comin' out the clarion
Twelves in the trunk, flatscreen TVs in the headrest with Something About Mary on, carry on
I be turnin' heads every time when you see me in the Chevy
Man, it's evident she car-struck
And I'm far from hard up so quit trippin' like a bitch
And get in the car, slut, girl you know you wanna ride

My wheels are super clean, paint job it glitters and gleams

[Verse 3: Yelawolf] (Only on Trunk Muzik 0-60)
In the background with a six-pack now
And I’m out lookin' for the ladies
Peanut butter seats have seat girl my peanut butter needs jelly
I'll chase you like Chevy if you ain't afraid to get messy
If you know the game then I'll let you call the shots like a referee
Now I’m drinkin' a deuce deuce, swig it slow
Feelin like I’m Deuce Deuce Bigalow
Pick a bitch like I pick a piccolo
Go anywhere you wanna go, pick a road
Interstate 59, 20, 75, 285, 85 southbound
Twins pipes like pow-pow
Hundred spokes on the Vogues like wow, wow, wow

Truth, Deuce, Jeffree Star
She wants to lick my body, and I want to lick her body
So let's all have a party, lick each other, let's get naughty
She thinks that I'm a hottie, and I know she likes it doggy
Ooh, ahh, ladee dadee, ooh, ahh, touch my body

[Chorus: Deuce]
Girl, let's get freaky now, lick you all up and down
I got them lips, I'll make you drip till you twist all around
I wanna feel them legs 'cause it ain't time for sex
You've got them hips, you've got them lips, I wanna feel the rest

[Verse 1: Jeffree Star]
I like boys and girls and rock stars
Even virgins wanna come into my snack bar
Don't hate me 'cause I fucked your favorite band
Beer bottle up my pussy, let's do a keg stand
And let me show you how to sit on that dick
America's Next Top Model, click, click
I'm the ring-leader, girls follow my trends
Got Hannah Montana doing anal with my friends
Pull my hair, scratch my back, beat me like Rihanna
I love ass-to-mouth and black cock like Obama
We showed you how to Turn Off the Lights
So give me some fucking Twilight neck bites
Deuce is gonna get your coochie real loose
So I'mma line up your men and play Duck, Duck, Goose
[Chorus: Deuce]
Girl, let's get freaky now, lick you all up and down
I got them lips, I'll make you drip till you twist all around
I wann feel them legs 'cause it ain't time for sex
You've got them hips, you've got them lips, I wanna feel the rest

[Verse 2: Deuce]
Oh, look who's back with his favorite transvestite
In the back, sitting VIP, that's right
And you're still waiting outside with a girl
Mad 'cause I got through the front line
With a gun, yeah, it's all fun
Till you're laid out with your brains out
And you end up on the other side of the club with your face down
While the club bangs out of control
It's out of this world
The way you shake them hips make me like ""damn girl""
The way them lips taste makes me think damn sure
That you're sucking dick straight from the men's bathroom
A little drip, drip 'cause you stuck your dick quick
Inside some bitch and then you realized ""oh shit""
Took that shit out, and it smelled like cold fish
A little chlamydia ain't gon' do shit

[Chorus: Deuce]
Girl, let's get freaky now, lick you all up and down
I got them lips, I'll make you drip till you twist all around
I wanna feel them legs 'cause it ain't time for sex
You've got them hips, you've got them lips, I wanna feel the rest
[Verse 3: The Truth]
I'm from the West Coast, Bentleys and palm trees
You can tell he's Armenian, looking at his car keys
Got a problem? Add it up, damn right, I'm tatted up
California, stand up and go and put your hands up
I'm sipping on whatever so she can look better
I don't want no problem, so I brought the condoms
Truth is in the house, she must be in some luck
I seen her at the club and heard she wanna fuck
I'm gangster like white walls, sitting on a Regal
I hear no, I see no, I speak no evil
Rock your boat, baby, I'm the coolest skipper
Live up in this hospital, ain't nobody sicker
I'm balling, baby, my jewels speak for itself
Got the LVs on the bag just to match the belt
I like the smiles on your bitch, and that's a fact
I'll put some miles on your bitch and send her ass back

[Chorus: Deuce]
Girl, let's get freaky now, lick you all up and down
I got them lips, I'll make you drip till you twist all around
I wanna feel them legs 'cause it ain't time for sex
You've got them hips, you've got them lips, I wanna feel the rest

[Bridge: Deuce & Truth]
These ladies go crazy
They wanna have all my babies
They love me 'cause I'm famous
And haters hate that I made it
Oh baby, oh baby
Let me get in your Mercedes
I know you got a friend or two maybe
I hope she ain't think we dating
I'm heroin, I'm like ecstasy
All these girls want sex from me
Blowing up my phone, always texting me
All they wanna do is get next to me
I'm schizo, I'm loco
They mad 'cause I'm rolling solo
While I'm rich, trying to get that mo' dough
And in the bed, these girls say I'm a mofo
[Chorus: Deuce]
Girl, let's get freaky now, lick you all up and down
I got them lips, I'll make you drip till you twist all around
I wanna feel them legs 'cause it ain't time for sex

[Verse 1]
Remember when I leave
That the one in the mirror ain't me
It's just someone that I call B.o.B
It's kinda me, but it's not
It's just a mask, that I got
So that I can rap and get off my block
Reminiscin' my past when I was a toddler
Sittin' in grass and playin' with blocks
To failing my classes, now I'm on lockdown
Not writin' and readin' a lot
Money and weed is in my shoebox now
When I'm tryna get me a Glock (Bow!)
'Cause I thought I was at the end of my line
Then I found out it was all in my mind
That's why I'm here, to end all the fear
We all gon' die and leave from here like yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
I was a man with no name
Now I'm attributin' mo' fame
But all of this ain't gonna matter when I die
And say goodbye
So long, sayonara

(Oh) Yeah (Oh) I'll be in the sky
(Oh) Yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh) yeah, yeah, yeah
(Oh) Yeah (Oh) I'll be in the sky

[Verse 2]
Everybody here gon' die one day
So while I'm here I'ma find my way
That's my forte, that's why I'm here
To open up your ear and speak this real
Beatin' down your block with a tooth
The gold teeth don't really match with a suit
Nowadays folk would rather rap than go to school
'Cause they feel if they black, then they gotta have a tool (Blah!)
But it don't really seem that bad
After all, everybody wanna kick back
They wanna sip 'gnac, they wanna sip Goose
They wanna get down, they wanna get loose
They wanna get blowed, they wanna see the truth
They wanna get old just like you
But since ain't nobody gonna be responsible
I'ma have to be the one to show, let's go
[Pre-Chorus]
I was a man with no name
Now I'm attributin' mo' fame
But all of this ain't gonna matter when I die
And say goodbye
So long, sayonara
I'll have to catch you tomorrow maybe

Oh, all right (I'll be there)
I'll be in the sky

Ima get my head up and never look down
Get inside my jet, UP! And never touch ground
With every sec' taken
I will never break, and
I will stay strong 'til my ""tea-time"" comes around

[Verse 1: Kevin Altitude Gatez]
Tic toc, tic toc, tic toc, to the tic toc
The clock just tic tocs and it wastes no time tic-talking
I hate all these suckers who waste my time shit talking
Stick a dick in you mouth bitch and jus quit talking
I flow so high so I can crap on this shit-hole
People just don't know what it takes to be me, No!
I'm just too tall and your shoe size is just too small
Your game is foul, like trynna play soccer with two balls
Where is the fair-play?
Life ain't no fairytale
There ain't no hero, ain't no Peter, ain't no Mary-Jane
We gotta do our own thing
Live your life your way
We just can't get along, so please just get away
Love life in your lifetime and your love-life must be life-time..
..Long and just praise God and maybe you'll get enough time
Fly with me, don't hate me, let me show you how
Just get your head up and never look down
[Hook: Kevin Altitude Gatez]

[Verse 2: Kevin Altitude Gatez]
Tic toc, tic toc, tic toc, to the tic toc
The clock just tic-tocs and it wastes no time tic-talking
Listen I ain't just talking
I'm trynna tell you whats popping
More effort and more time, will I succeed? Man let's solve this
Play this shit, I just rhyme
I ain't really trynna re-define..
Hip Hop 'cause its fine
I'm just trynna make it extra fine
Extra spice in that extra big ass hot pot
Kids want they iPods, rejectin their iGods
Life's like that, but do you even fear that He might come
All I ever asked for was the spot light from that bright sun
I do me and I do me in the best way I know
And I stick to my principles, even after that light glows
People talking bullshit, in their music making us lose it
Then they chill, and they wine and dine like Blue Six
Calling me a rapper, to me is an understatement
But it don't matter, I see a bigger picture, now let me paint it

[Hook: Kevin AltitudeGatez]

[Verse 3: Kevin Altitude Gatez]
Does hard work really pay
Do you even listen to what we say
Such a low number of peopl who understand the music we make
But they all crowd up when they get the smell of the cookies we bake
But I know  I got my shit in order as long as I do D.R.A.K.E
Never ever in your lifetime
Should you ever come and play around fire
Word of advice, who ever said you can blow me out, is a liar
But you all gonna help me blow
Like a huge ass birthday cake
'Yal marinate my success like Spur ribs and steak
I konw there will be flaws and falls as stakes rise
But What goes around, comes around like a  U-ramp and I just skate
Devoted to my music, only death can do us part
I'm such a fucked up nigga that all I want is a fresh start
So love life in your life-time and your love-life must be life-time..
..long and just praise God and maybe you will get enough time
Fly with me, dont hate me, let me shw you how
Just get your head up and never look down

I've got this feeling when I stand up
I'll have to bend my neck so my cranium don't touch the ceiling
I'm defiant, call me Andre the giant
Hell of a monster of a man
But my tongues the only weapon I'm conceiling
Wanna know why I'm so huge? Because my lyrics are mass appealing
I'm metaphorically massive
But stick thin through, due to the lack of food I'm eating
My size and shape's deceiving
You better start to hide your face
Because whenever I ride the bass I'm causing seismic quakes this evening
I'm an Ogre, thought I told ya, I ain't no big friendly giant
And this ain't David and Goliath, so go to war and you won't triumph
With your slingshot I think not, it's time that you retire
Devs arose from the fire to acquire, a status and position that is higher
Yeah my life has been quite frantic
That's why I make sure that mycantics are gigantic
So make sure u keep it locked like M.I.5

For too many years now
I've been underground like a prehistoric fossil
But this god sent aposols to colossal not to be
Splashing cash and popping bottles
Because my rhymes are astronomical
Their lines are nothing but comical
Quite frankly bloody diabolical (Geez)
I guess my size is overwhelming
You don't possess the capability to fight monsters like Van-Helsing
Because im massive
Every syllable, every metaphor, every passage
I'll be the oversized savage, like the croc in lake placid (RAHHH)
I'll sweep u off your feet just like white water rapids time
To bins thought like jack or consequences will be tragic
But this ain't fairy tale magic (NOO)
I'll force you to resign just like a poor old poor mechanics
Who compose as you like
Thats why I'm the giant round the mic
In a business where u can't afford to panic
And now it seems like the time has become a virtue
But its worth the wait
I'll place my size 10 on the curb
And then till the earth will shake till the day im in a box
I dont deserve a break

Ask you something:
Do you think I'm common like sense is?
That heaven didn't send this
Uniquely perfect dude so just discard me like a toy, then
But you know, I know, I'd make a damn good boyfriend
Oil can, oil can
You think I'm the Tin Man
You took my little heart and you kicked it like a tin can
Ain't you heard I got the kind of shine can make your skin tan?
In the lean time don't come crying for the thin man

My girlfriend know I got a fetish for fine hoes
I'm worldwide so she know I’m gonna find hoes
Sneaking in my iPhone, looking through my call log
It hurts looking at her face to ask her what she crying for
I’m so fresh I’m wondering ""why didn’t I design clothes?""
This rap shit is something that you gotta be designed for
Meetings at the label saying they gon' make Sean blow
Turned the radio on and do I hear Sean? No
Man please do not gimmick me, put me on the shelf and not remember me
And treat me like a John Doe
I wish that I could drop my nuts in they tonsils
(ahem) Shut up bitch swallow
And I been signed to Ye for well over a year now
It’s clear now, I'mma focus on my career now
You taught me to create a process
Saying that you changed my life dog it’s me being modest
But honestly I wish that I could take you off tour
Put you in the studio so you could focus more on my shit
And I don’t mean to sound selfish
But I am not an artist that's selfless
I’m feeling like a crab in a bucket

Niggas making diss records in efforts that I see it
Waiting on my reply but they never will receive it
You are not half of what I am and can’t be it
You are just a hundred-and-one percent bitch
Recognize a star like you pledge to the allegiance
And I don’t want fans, I want believers
Race to success so I'mma keep pedalin'
Cuz my mama man she deserve everything
So if I find a girl with beauty and brains like her
Then best believe she gon' get a wedding ring
But I don’t know if I believe in love to be honest
Cuz every girl love the headliners
Take her to my hotel all my niggas there
And best believe they gon' give us all a hair line-up
And that’s why girls wanna leave us
Tell 'em where we are but they never gon' believe us
Won’t stop till we end up on that show Cheaters
But I bet you couldn’t spot me if a nigga wore cheetah
And I be in the strip-club Teasers
Giving all the girls what’s needed
Honest dog had so many problems dog
I could hand 'em out and be labeled a fuckin' teacher
So respect my hand gesture
I dare any nigga try and come test us
You a mothafuckin' act dog, a A.C.T. that’s why niggas try and test ya

And everyone in my field of vision's just crops for the harvest
I'm a hell-born Seraphim
Four faces with torn feather wings
Spawning four deformed Nephilim
Burying peace pipes, digging up the hatchet
Deep throat my dick 'til it singes in your stomach acid
We unattractive ferocious creatures
I got master degree burns after a heatstroke of genius (genius)
Rush the doors from dusk 'til dawn
My entourage plot on top of Scotland yard 'cause we above the law
Withstand the force of a juggernaut
We're the recipe for disaster and this beat's cooking up a storm
All powerful being
During hours of sleeping, I levitate between the ground and the ceiling
Advanced lifeforms found in my semen
Haven't started to rap yet, this is just the sound of my breathing
A mental plane like Enola Gay
I'm slashing open throats of backstabbers with my shoulder blade
Step off the planet, it would float away
Tormented by growing pains of my ever evolving brain
I sever ties with heaven skies
And wage wars that makes Armageddon resemble a training exercise
Third eye blessed with second sight, a Cenobite
I've survived the new Mexico desert testing sites
If I do start to smoke weed
I'll take two tokes and won't breathe out for a whole week and OD
Battling me, you won't get cold feet
The mere thought of facing Possessed'll freeze the fluid in both knees
Product of a Warlock and a Witch, knock you for six
Piledrive you down a bottomless pit
Push my luck over the top of a cliff
I don't bite the hand that feeds me, I chew it off at the wrist
I forge a sword from a thunderbolt
And I'll rub in salt into bullet wounds just to the make the slug dissolve"

[Verse 1]
I'm from the Gunshine State so my gun must shine
I'm tryna impregnate Beyonce's sister just one mo' time
So, take a toke of this, you won't be breathing well
I'm all about biscuits and trees like a Keebler Elf
I snuff bikers, give a fuck, ride a unicycle
With plush tires right through the offices of Ruff Ryders
Here's a thug reminder; a goon quick tip
You belong in the ladies room because you be on some bitch shit
I'll never stop writin' rhymes like this 'cause
Show you what a point blank shot to ya ribs does
You seen the holes those shells made?
You a hotel maid 'cause all you do is fold and that's so gay
I tried to kick a field goal
I missed the ball my shoe flew off
And hit you in the fuckin' head with a steel toe (sorry)
For real though, I got this underground bullshit
Wrapped around my finger
Not a rapper or a singer that's quite as ill as I am
Pop out your eyes and scramble them bitches next to the bacon in my frying pan
I was a stick-up kid, it was fucked up but fun (Why?)
'Cause I used a Nintendo Duck Hunt gun (Fuck 'em)

Pull up right next to you at the drive-through

Lick a shot, speed off with the perfect timin'
Yeah the tires screech, no it ain't Dustin Diamond
You fuckers suck at rhymin'
Weak impostors I've been iller
You're Ben Stiller, it's time to Meet the Fockers
You don't greet me proper
I'mma slam your head motherfucking face down flat into a greasy saucer
Pass the cheese and salsa, I'm makin' nachos
I told you we gon' make it rain so bitch bring a poncho
I'm the best at war, that's what the heckler for
Play me like it's chess and I'll smack you with a checker board
You should check my rapport, it's quite impressive baby
This year I'm eatin' real meal like filled with extra gravy
You was an extra for a lady in a cheap film
In a nasty scene and left the camera lens with skeet film
Without a doubt, yeah we know what you about
You love sausage so much, when you talk you spit sauerkraut

Uncut Raw,AZ,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
No need for lactose, pure straight out Bolivia, Peru
Uncut baby, what?
(Fuck you!)

[Verse 1]
Life is a struggle, that's why niggas I know stay on the juggle
Some hustle to double, others hug you then mug you
Poverty-stricken, they even turn a church kid into stickin'
It seems sickenin', but what? Whatever makes the pockets thicken
Fuck police and no remorse for the beasts
That's lost on the streets, that pistol whip a priest for a crosspiece
I'm lost, chief, runnin' through strips, thinkin' of top dealers
Fillin' TEC clips with 'cop killers' that could stop gorillas
Shovin' a stub nose in butt holes
I'm nuts, so skitzo, clepto
Killin' shit up throughout the metro
My thug essence'll always keep me plugged with drug investments
Sketch my reference, takin' papers considered preference
And violations will lead to kidnappin', decapitation
So what you're facin' is realism that's into activation
Livin' off land with five honies playin' my hand
Me and fam, sippin' off Guinness stout and eatin' clams
It's all part of plans, a vet chillin' in Tamps, West and Stans
Outta state connects, slugs, sex, drugs and grands
[Refrain]
What?
For my hype niggas (Uncut), trife niggas (Raw), 25-to-life niggas

[Verse 2]
This is as, pure as opium, purified for street players to open 'em
Space, like three L's laced with coke in 'em
Shots awoken 'em, fake uniform Jakes approachin' 'em
Six trips, to young clips and killers coachin' 'em
However though, fake ass niggas'll never know
'Cause my method's perfected, I'm movin' skeptic and never show
I'm soon to blow, stack doe, lay on the low
While I'm sippin' Cristal, I mess with Long Island and Mo'
A part of nature, me wan' acres in Jamaica
Puffin' exotic trees without seeds rolled up in leaf paper
So exhale, 'cause if I don't live to tell
Then fuck it, farewell, I'll see the rest of y'all niggas in hell

[Refrain]
What?
For my hype niggas (Uncut), trife niggas (Raw), 25-to-life niggas

[Verse 3]
So all my goodfellas, heroin, coke and weed sellers
What the fuck cats can't tell us if they ain't got bread to bail us?
Happy to survive, I haven't seen it all, Peter pay Paul
From the connivers to the livest, they crack fool
It's all war, the streets are filled up with guns galore
Plenty young for war, gettin' their minds strung for sure
Yo, dun, cock the 4

Motherfuckers think we're playin', back 'em down
Holdin' niggas for hostages, what? What?
Chill, chill, chill

Speakers Going Hammer Freestyle,Pusha T,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: Soulja Boy]
I wake up, early in the morning 'round the crack of dawn and
Wave to my neighbors like what's up?
And tatted up, get bang in my truck
Everybody in my city show me love
Because I have the speakers going hammer
(The dough boy version though, yeah)

[Verse: Pusha]
Back up in this bitch niggas free to go
It was all good just a key ago
Price for the 20 all I need to know
Still moving snow like it's 3 below
You trace hard, while I cake hard
You niggas Lil B's to the Based God
I been cooking, is you mistooken?
Chi town plug got the city jukin'
Givenchy motorcycle leathers
Mad Max, 5 stacks for a look this weathered
Small circle bad bitches all think they clever
The mixed ones whole shape and recycle better
Sit them on a curb when I'm done with 'em
She oblivious her girl wanna come with 'em
Can't blame her; other niggas can't run with 'em
Usain Bolt through these bitches then I'm done with 'em

[Outro]
So Liv
I picks her up, right?
She tells me: Oh I thought I saw you earlier
This guy had a Range Rover just like you
I said Range Rover where? This ain't no motherfuckin Range Rover
This a G55; 130 thousand dollars of winter throwaway money
You must be out your fucking mind
See I could tell you ain't gonna be around long
You ain't doing enough motherfucking homework on your nigga

El Chupa Nibre Remix,DANGERDOOM,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Two two
One two, two two (""Uh-uh, uh-uh"")
One one (""Y'all ain't gon' cut my front but"")
(""'Less I get one of them, sport"")
(""Sport radio thangs with the earbuds"")

[Verse]
The super flow more stupider than Richard Pryor
Combined with Bazooka Joe jokes, and spit fire
Eat MC's like El Chupa Nibre
Except for when I defeat and knock they beat off eBay
Danger in the street, shootin at a DJ
DOOM countin chickens like the Colonel on D-Day
""We 'bout to fry, so burn 'em all"" he say
Villain gettin paid off the same joint three way
... You rang? ""Can you spare some sugar?""
By his right ear was a smear and a booger
Pour my coffee, he replied ""Of coursely""
Still chewin the mask whispered ""Eww get off me""
His money chunk he couldn't spare a thin dime
Once was in a rhyme crew ""Monkeys Into Crime""
What happened? He coulda went platinum
Then he discovered the secret plan— they had to gat him
... It wasn't hard to find the file to pull
They had they differences, all irreconcilable
And that's a pile of bull— they're bad
That's why they don't tell no tales, nor wear plaid
His upper lip and dome stayed stiff
I made him try to riff over a homemade gift
A statue with overfoam chrome sprayed Kif
With a handwritten signature from dude who played Biff
The Simpsons, but ""Back to the Future Part II""
And leave it up to you, to choose who
When he cruise through, he know how you foolsies do
Get him catch him dreamin and you creep him like a Suzie Q
He said ""{Fuck you, bitch} you don't know me
Watch I bring the truck through, switch like you owe me""
If you in luck, I get richer off you, blow me
Dumile got her like Inuyasha got Kagome
Well, now what do we got here?
Miscommunication can lead to hot beer
Although he's not here, his agenda was clear
Clearly a big spender, who wears a lot of gear
DOOM the Great, no low self-esteem
Got to go get the wealth growin green gleam
He make it seem mean as a pre-teen choir head
Sire said, the first time he seen Firehead
The squire, what about Barbera?
It's closer than it seems like in a car mirror
Dancers turn gangsta, what be surely wilder
His student was a cell buddy, name of Early Cuyler
[Outro: Squidbillies & Sheriff]
Where's my damn chicken?
Damn
Well, ya know that boy can perm
How much do I owe ya?"

Got niggas hatin’ on me hard cause my paper right
Money from the floor way up to the sky
Now they wanna know and they wonder why
I got my wings when I was young so I tend to fly
I put my chain on, they saying it’s homicide
And I’m killin’ ‘em

It ain't even fair
Got the Mazi’ out, look like Nicki here
White drop head, call it white chalk
Burgundy insides, 57 sauce
And nigga I’m killin ‘em, bring the body bags
Count a million, fill the body bag
In my murder coupe, call it toe tag
Spend a grip nigga, call me 4 Jags
And nigga I’m killin’ ‘em, call a murder case
Got my Rolli’ on, got the murder face
Roll another blunt, dust my shoulders off
Niggas hatin’ Young, watch me shake ‘em off

That eagle right here if you wanna feel fly
No games though, no names spoke

Stuck in the car with my nigga I’m ready to ride
We on our way to the top, watch that paper rise

First 48, first 48
Took out 50 racks and blew the first 48
I ain't worried about spending bread cause I got more to make
Soon as they see that Maserati they gone surely hate
Hundred for a show, can you afford a date
And that’s just one show, imagine what my tour gon make?
Police ran up on my tour bus
But hey my niggas more money more problems
More lawyers on the case

Heard they little diss but I’m just being the big person
Never been trained, still my aim near perfect

A River That Flows Forever,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","{*singing in other language*}

[Danny Glover - over singing]
When your hero falls from grace, all fairy tales are uncovered
Myth exposed and pain magnified, the grace pays uncovered
He told me to be strong, but I confused to see you so weak
You say never to give up, and it hurts to see you welcome defeat
When your hero falls so league the stars, and so does the perception of tomorrow
Without my hero, there's only me alone, to deal with my sorrow
Your heart ceases to work, and your soul is not happy at all
What are you expected to do, when your only hero falls

[Afeni Shakur - over singing]
As long as some suffer, the river flows forever
As long as there is pain, the river flows forever
As strong as a smile can be, the river will flow forever
And as long as you are with me, we'll ride the river together..
..And as long as you are with me, we'll ride the river together

[Singing - over chanting]
We'll ride.. the river together, as long as.. you are with me
The river.. will flow forever, as long as.. you are with me
The river.. will flow forever, as long as.. you are with me"

I always wanted to do this shit
This is it, what

Nigga, yeah

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Fresh up off the plane
Real niggas embrace my music and bitches go insane
Even the kids throwing up the gang
They don't bother pronouncing my name, they just look at my chain
Boy, how much you spent on it?
This ain't nothing but hard work and what you can get from it
Ain't no toilet paper, but this smell like the shit don't it?
Smoking chronic and drinking gin 'til we get sick stomached
And them suckers ain't gotta like it 'cause your bitch love it
I'mma roll it, she gonna light it
Tell me she in desperate need of a pilot
I told her kick her feet up
We gonna go to my crib, soon as I roll this weed up
Call some friends of yours and we could all have a smoke-out
You ain't gotta hold it too long, this is rapper weed
Couple hits is all you gonna need
In my Versace frames, I'm blazed
Somewhere on the island, smoking some ray
Middle of the day, drunk dialing
Be surprised by how high a nigga get
I'm a different kind of fly, we ain't on the same shit, nigga

No need to apologize, you should know how fly niggas do
Only EZ-Widers, been done with them cigarillos, fool
I been on the road, shopping and killing them interviews
Heard I left a major deal, but my paper major still
And all of them fans in love with me, 'cause I say what's real
So I can never give a fuck how a hater feel
But, uh, every time they send a driver for me and Will
I call it doing my talking on the field
At first niggas was tough, they don't wanna be gangstas now
Traces of my flow, yeah, they copy and paste my style
Wouldn't think I notice it, while in my hotel
Smoking with your bitch, fool
And this is it, what
Relax your feet, put on some music, roll a zip up
And we gonna smoke it 'til it's gone, ever see me cough?

Get Better,Dan Le Sac vs. Scroobius Pip,"['hip hop', 'alternative', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Scroobius Pip]
Imagine a song, that really reached out and touched kids
And not in a Daily Mail way, innocence corrupted
But in a way where criticism remained constructve
And wasn't too politicised and children weren't instructed
To behave in a way that was unrealistic
Or made out the way they live was somehow sick and twisted
But simply pointed out reasons to get it together
Not shouting ""get a job"", but just saying

[Hook: Scroobius Pip]
Get better, get better, get better, get better
Get better, get better, get
Get better, get better, get better, get better
Get better
Get better
Get better, get better, get better
Get better, get better, get
Get better, get better, get better
Get better
[Verse 2 Scroobius Pip]
You see the young mother capital is where I live
Little kids being raised by slightly bigger kids
Society seems unphased that this is how it is
While I'm constantly amazed that this is how it is
They confuse love at first sight with lust at first lie
It must have hurt right when trust first took flight
You're young, you've no rights, you long for new heights
But some of those nights leave more than love bites
Tops cropped, skirts stop at the top of their thighs
And the boys got that hungry look in their eyes
They wanna be grown up and have respect you see
But they're acting uneducated sexually
I ain't saying' be celibate
Go out and have your fun
But there's plenty you can do without impregnation
And there ain't nothing wrong at all with having children
Just build yourself a little before you try to build them
And

[Hook: Scroobius Pip]
Get better, get better, get better, get better
Get better, get better, get
Get better, get better, get better, get better
Get better
Get better
Get better, get better, get better
Get better, get better, get
Get better, get better, get better
Get better
[Verse 3 Scroobius Pip]
I see small town syndrome growing in size
There's not a lot to do, so the kids they decide
To get drunk every night, a glazed eyes disguise
Do drugs every night, tired from their lives
People getting off their faces for a quiet night in
Kids rolling around the streets rowing and fighting
But it's all just because life ain't too exciting
And it's easier than trying to do the right thing
But there are other choices --- if you want them
You don't have to tow the line and just float with the flotsam
You can build your time better when you find a passion
The Internet and public services give free education
So it really ain't a case of rich or poor
It's a case of self-motivation and nothing more
Like Billy says, whether you have or you have not wealth
The system might fail you, but don't fail yourself
Just

[Hook: Scroobius Pip]
Get better, get better, get better, get better

So we ride and we smoke 'til we can't anymo'
And keep floatin'

Uh
Pass it to your man, roll another one and (Keep floatin')
When it's almost done
Why don't you go and break down enough for another one
And roll me some?

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Hey, then you can pass that, the kid who rock a snapback
Steady blow this hash back until my thoughts are abstract
High to get by, that's how we livin' in this day and age
I bring some color to a world that's filled with shades of gray
Throwin' this cake away to blaze and sip some Tanqueray
Remember spectatin' 'til they picked the kid to play the game
Now I'm an all-star, blasted out the ballpark
In my Lamborghini, speedin', you a golf cart
California dreams, Amsterdam reality
Life ain't what it seems, these the thoughts that weed pull outta me
Blow through a thousand trees, the whole entire crowd get skeed
Livin' in what seems to be fiction, I'm on a balcony
I light one up, this for those who ever doubted me
Then light another, this for those who hold it down for me

Passin' around the weed, no problems at all

So much smoke, we got the words high wrote in the song
Girl, I try to come and make you smile
I'm gone, so will you wait a while?
As soon as I come home, we gon' smoke and then I'll stay a while
Some people hate my style, some people love it though
And all these kids who wanna clone me, they ain't comin' close
Politickin' joints, we countin' none of your votes
I'm gettin' everybody high, so you can puff on ya roach
Shorty used to all these players, tell her, ""Fuck with a coach""
I just want you to come over, roll me somethin' to smoke
Hey, my mind be cookin' rhymes up, live until my time's up
Hate me then they love me, tell 'em try to make they minds up
Barbers and they line me up, ID was on the beat

When someone decides to put a bullet through your shoulder
Peirce your heart let the blood drain away
Like a video you watch your life fade away
I'm just being honest but my minds already corrupted
I'm tryna be real unlike them fake ass muthafuckas
I'm just livin' my life way it was chosen to be
A killer part of the greatest it was destined for me
But thats the way life is u could be part of the best
Or u could end up wit the blood leakin' out of your chest

Can U Get Away,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: 2Pac and Anya talking]
Whassup? It's 2Pac. Can you get away?
Let me come swoop you up
(You know I got a man)
I know you got a man, but he ain't gon' mind if I take you out
(Of course he gon' mind)
Let me take you to lunch, I'll have you back before he even get home, before anybody see
(I can't, he ain't gon' let me
Aww c'mon! Pleeeeeease...
(Nah)
Oh aight – what's wrong with your eye?
Why you got on glasses?

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Ever since I met ya I could peep the pressure
It's like your man don't understand, all he does is stress ya
I can see your state of misery from the introduction
Ain't 'bout no suckin' and touchin', just harmless discussion
Maybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day
Late night phone conversations – would that be OK?
I don't wanna take up all your time, be the next in line
Tell me your size, let me find you things with you in mind
I can see you're cautious and I'm careful not to scare you
The anticipation of love makin'
Got you shakin' when I'm standin' near you
News of precision will prepare ya
In case you get scared, just ask the man in the mirror
Now the picture's gettin' clearer
All he does is hit you hard
I tell you to leave him, and you tell me keep my faith in God
I don't understand, I just wanna bring ya home
I wonder should I leave you alone
And find a woman of my own
All the homies tell me that you don't deserve it
I contemplate – but in my heart I know you worth it
Tell me, can you get away?
Ebony, can you get away?
C'mon… Let's go… Can you get away?
Can you get away?

[Hook: Anya Pinto & (2Pac)]
So much pressure in the air (I know, I know)
And I can't get away (Just for a little while love)
I'm not happy here (I know it's hard but, can you get away?)
So much pressure in the air
(Let's go man, get up outta there, can you get away?)
And I can't get away (Do you love him?)
I'm not happy here (Do you love that man?)

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Could it be my destiny to be lonely?
Ain't checkin' for these hoochies that be on me
‘Cause they phony
But you was different, I got no need to be suspicious
‘Cause I can tell, my life with you would be delicious
The way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted
I'm sittin' here hopin' that we can find some way to kick it
Even though I got your digits, gotta struggle to resist it
Slowly advance when it's my chance not to miss it
You blow me kisses when he ain't lookin'
Now your heart's tooken
My only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook
Wanna take you there but you scared to follow
Come see tomorrow
Hopin' I can take you through the pain and sorrow
Let you know I care – that someone's there for your struggle
Depend on me, when you have needs or there's trouble
I wanna give you happiness and maybe even more
I told you before, no time to waste
We can hook up at the store. Can you get away?
[Hook: Anya Pinto & (2Pac)]
So much pressure in the air (I know it is)
And I can't get away (Yeah, you can)
I'm not happy here (You ain't happy, huh? Can you get away?)
So much pressure in the air (I know… is he beatin' on you?)
And I can't get away (Did he punch you?)
I'm not happy here (Throwin' you around the house?)

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
I sit here reminiscin' and I hope you listenin'
In the position to pressure and offer competition
Me and you was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonely
‘Cause now it's on for you and me, all I can see
A happy home – that's my fantasy
But my reality is problems with your man and me
What can I do? Don't wanna lose you to this sucker
‘Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta
Don't wanna rush ya, but make your mind up fast
Nobody knows, on who controls will it last?
Before I ask, I hope you see that I'm sincere
And even if you stay with him today I'm still here
I refuse to give up, ‘cause I believe in what we share
You're livin' in prison and what he's givin' can't compare
‘Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know
Passionately yours and I'll never let you go
Tell me, can you get away?
[Hook: Anya Pinto & (2Pac)]
So much pressure in the air (Can't get away why?)
And I can't get away
I'm not happy here
(Let me take you away, all I wanna know, can you get away?)
So much pressure in the air (Man)
And I can't get away (Course you can get away)
I'm not happy here
(If you really wanted to get away, you could get away)

[Outro: 2Pac]
You ain't got to go through all this drama and this stress
With this old half a man, ya know what I'm sayin'?
I ain't tryin' to put you in a position
Where you gotta give up your lifestyle for everything
You need, but now… he ain't even takin' care of you
He beatin' on you and shit; look how you look!
You too motherfuckin' raw to be with that nigga
Ya know what I'm sayin'?
Shake that sucker to the left
Let me show you what this life is really about
Ya know what I'm sayin'? You need to be on first class
Need to be goin' to Hawaii, seein' the world
Seein' what this world got to offer you
Not goin' to, ya know what I'm sayin'?
The emergency room, gettin' stitches
‘Cause this nigga done got jealous. Don't cry, it's all good

[2Pac and Anya talking again]
Can you take me from here?
Shake that man, get away
Can you take me from here?
I'ahhhhhm unhappy here
And I need you to show me love
Because it's so much pressure now
And I neeeeed to get awayyyheyyyeahhh"
Cab Fare,Souls of Mischief,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Tajai]
Yo, the jam was fly, oh my now it's over
My batch of pals cut so Tajai must catch a
Taxicab, dag nab why'd they leave me
Stuck in the late night alley, Cali's
Not so hot that everyone should be sweating
Yet nobody's smiling plus crews are piling
Staring, thinking what they'd look like wearing
My gear, I sighed when the yellow cab neared
He sped up cos dreads made him think I'd vic him
Now I gotta dodge thugs like I'm playing chicken
An Englishman, an Irishman
Five or ten Caucasians passed me in their taxis
Oh no such luck I'm gonna get bucked for my apparel
As I seen the black gauge barrel
Just then a fat cab came to my rescue
Damn I'm glad black men drive them cabs too

[Opio]
It seems nowadays cab rides are rather pricely
Especially when the driver goes for self
In spite of the directions that are given
They are driven to cruise backstreets
That treats them to a pricely fare, exactly
What happened to myself when I chose to call a taxi
It pulled up to the curb and I hopped into the backseat
Gave him the destination, said he'd never heard of the place
And I'd have to tell him as we went along, and then placed it in drive
When I said make a left he made a right
Alright, I get it, you wanna make some slight
Detours so you can be sure that you get yours
And when I turn my head you up the bill a little more
I told the cabbie to stop, he didn't think I watched it
Fake reached into my pocket and then jetted like I was Rocket
Ismail his tail light was broken as a token of appreciation
He started chasing but I smoked him
[Phesto]
What? You can't escape me
Mop head, drop dead, deceased
Say your final summons if I catch you
Bet you regret you ever ditched me
Driving, conniving
Guys been robbing me lately
He went up Blake Street
But I'm following, swallowing up steps
He ran to the left, I made a left and crashed
Into a rose bush, my nose crushed on impact
But yo, I'll get him back

[A-plus]
I didn't have enough for a car, what a bummer
I had to get a job driving taxis last summer
All the other drivers knew that my car was spectacular
Cause I had a tight, very bright yellow Acura
Piling in 9 or 10 skins at a time, G
Funny how the honeys with the money always find me
Paying their green to see what color my house is
Feeling like Del cause they would sleep on my couches
I'd charge senior citizens extra, cause they never mention
I'd take all the money from they pension
And I'd drive a blind man around for a while
Even if he only had to travel just a mile, with a smile
And don't let your dog off the leash
Cause if he stepped then I would have to squash the beast
And if you didn't have the right change, don't even ask me
Or I would have ran your ass down with my taxi"

I gotta couple of V's wit' the kits, MPV's on my wrist
A lot of glamour and glitz, but shawty I don't need it
My beginnin' was a humble one, a hustler I'm a son of one
Taught me how to number run, I went from that to number one
Had a hundred ones, I bought a slab, flipped another one
Sold my little three-eighty east, and said I need another gun
The littlest in the trap, and got it poppin' like some bubblegum

Every verse I ever gave ya, it was fact, nothin' fiction
I'm a livin' legend.. no stuntin', no reppin'
You can check my track record, I'm highly respected
I'mma gangsta in the game, go ask Lil' Wayne
Ask Judge Johnson, how many times he saw my face
For, ""pistol here, pistol there,"" ""violation here, violation there""
You can ask Rank, I ran the jail when I was there
I held it down, where-ever I go
When I'm in the A wit' the King, or in Detroit in the snow
I'm a pro, whether it's movin' snow or movin' 'dro
That's between me and you, I can get it for the low

In these motherfuckin' stupid ass niggas' faces!!
Was the fact that it's a whole bunch of kings down here
And as long as you takin' care of yo' business and doin' king shit you a king!
What these niggas shoulda been tryin' to do was tryin' to get close to the nigga
And get some understandin' about the type of game
He was tryin' to put in these motherfuckin' niggas' ear holes!
Understand what I'm sayin'?
So I'm layin' back I'm watchin' the game from the sideline
Know what I'm talking 'bout?
And I'm seein' all these ol' pussy ass niggas out here
Talking 'bout they this and they that, but they really ain't doin' nothin!
Cause they motherfuckin' paper ain't right
When I see them in the street, they diamonds fake! Know what I'm talking 'bout?
They shit ain't cut right, ya shit ain't right!
Shit cloudy and chipped up, know what I'm talking 'bout?
And them niggas talking 'bout they ""trill niggas""
Don't even know what the motherfuckin' word mean!
Know what I'm talking 'bout? This comin' from the O.G. style trill
Know what I'm talking 'bout? Not these ol' fake ass niggas
Tryin' to come on the scene later on and tryin' to take glory for some shit
Some other niggas paid dues for, know what I'm talking 'bout?
So this is what is.. we bringin' Georgia and Texas together
All you ol' BITCH ASS NIGGAS that ain't down wit' the play
Move on to the side, all you old school rappers like 'Pac say
You niggas flabby, lookin' like Larry Holmes
BACK YO' BITCH ASS UP!! And, and, and, and move around for the South
Cause it's our time to shine, know what I'm talking 'bout?
Now let's do this shit!"
Darkness Dream On,CunninLynguists,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Deacon]
Searching' for answers is like searching' for Atlantis
I'm working poor and I'm just hurting for some chances
This school of a livings like prison on a campus
Show me the Monet, and the pixels in that canvas
Advance through my imagery, I view my evil deeds
When I went to Jack in Tennessee to erase memory
When I called on Mary J be my serenity
So I don't see that all my enemies resembled me
I'm feeling faceless heading for a bitter state
I'm trying to place but my heart ain't even in the race
I've came far enough that turning' back is time wasted
Imprisoned by fear, I don't need no iron bracelets
What's my fate, how can I escape my heart
Running blind, an open mind could break this dark
A major spark might just make a star in this....

[Verse 2: Natti]
Way under in slumber is my true self shown
A glass house cracked from a few stones thrown
Pane in the windows of a once happy home
I’m a Cheshire Cat laughin’ at the caged birds' song
A caterpillar shroomin usin’ fumes from my bong
To cloud a land wondering what fuels what is wrong
Lust in my loins, vengeance in my heart
Thrust from my groin that could populate an Ark
Thoughts in my mind only popular in dark
I can’t let come to light so I might suffocate the spark
That might just spark the fuse that blows my views of self apart
Opinions of my health, my self, and wealth go off the chart
My struggle to keep balance ain’t a challenge it’s an art
Outside my sleep is silent ‘cause inside the war is fought
Every night, as I fade to the...

Don’t give me that bullshit

What if I told you that the battle was on?
Would that rattle ya bones? or would you be down to kill in the name of the throne
Drop bombs on innocent people or innocent homes
With automatic weapons or military drones
While me and my friends play croquet
And make bets on which country liable to fold next
Under the pressure of my fingertips
Any day or any time
They just cattle
We don’t need they kind any how
Talking population control
Gotta make room for the young, so it’s out with the old
I got tanks that need usin’, I’m lettin’ em go
For the low and some c-4 charges that’s ready to blow
I got the ticket on sativa ‘cause my patnah the supplier
And all my homeys down to invest in my empire
Sink the economy with no natural evidence
They complain, but that’s a part of being president

If I could get away with murder
I’d take my gun and I’d commit it X 2
[Verse 2: Natti]
I could use worship as a warship, bible and sword
Turn men and women to minions over Heaven’s rewards
Promise Islamic bombers Heavens harem of whores
For taking out a couple of floors
The holiest wars bring profits/prophets and I don’t mean Moses
Unless he’s on the screen when the NASDAQ opens
Horatio Caine won’t be able to blame me
For the third party bodies that his followers slain
Ashes and burnt remains all left in the name
Of
Whoever you praise, I just made it a game
Called winners and sinners, but they one and the same
You can play along with us at home
We livin’ in Rome, destined to fall
Didn’t you hear? I ain’t worried about the views of the public and peers
Shit, Hitler was once Time mags' Man of the Year
I’ma get it with hope while I’m peddlin’ fear
I’m a wolf in a wool cap with robes to match
Leadin’ the flock right down the hatch
I’m the fox in the hen house, the Devil You Know
In a black Cadillac, wrist glistenin gold
On my way to eat steaks with TD Jakes
So if you wanna dine with Christ you gon’ need these tapes
And if you still don’t know how cold I am

She the girl of my dreams, also my nightmares
Cause she be jigglin' it, killin' it in her nightwear
Between mean glances that we might share
The space between us is like a lightyear
All in my phone like she AT&T
All in my Facebook pretendin she me
Cus her ""Not Hot"" single friends feedin her nonsense
The ghetto's trying to kill me and my chick's an accomplice
With black gloves (black gloves) black mask (black mask)
Full lips (full lips) fat ass (I like that!)
Text messaging ridiculous comments
I'd have to wash my mouth out to read you the contents
She might literally love me to death
We had a stairway to heaven til' I fell down the steps

And I guess that I settle cause I’m a slave to huge breasts
But it ain’t worth it
Ask me again if my mind has changed on the situation in five days
And I couldn’t say for certain
And so we stay in this deranged arrangement
Nailing ‘tween the breaks of these unwavering debates of ‘who’s the
Crazy person’?
She got them fuck-goggles on me
My judgement Impaired like I was drunk on kamakaze’s running a busted Kawasaki
Callin the love doctor cause I need a fix of this chick and it’s sickening
Wish I could quit, but my dick is mixing the signals and shit
Half of the time, I see past these disastrous signs
And half of the time, I keep asking if I’m happy to lie
If blame can be assigned, then I guess I’ll have to try this food for thought:
You can always see the shape of the pan in the pie

High as the sun of a beach
Right here, quite near to perfecting my speech
But my sleeping habits on average keep me missing my sheets

In the studio blazin the beats
Or clubbin with fly birds, rubbin squeezin their Tweets
Flaked on my intervention, I've been missin for weeks
On an international binge with the friends that I keep
Then come home and roam around in my PJ's, for three days
Eatin sour cream n cheese Lays
Relapse itch hit, I'm scratchin like DJ's
Tracks in my veins show I'm feenin for replays
You say free bass? I'll be right there
I like mine with a nice cut and light snare
Get it to me rapido and I might share
Rappin makes me happy so, why stop why care

Peep, about how a black nigga was born in hell
And right then and there it's no hope
Cause a nigga can't escape the gangs and the dope
Damn! And when its black on black, that makes it shitty
Can't survive in the Compton city
And fool thats bet
Cause when you grow up in the hood, you gots ta claim a set
Chyeah, Its not that you want to but you have to
Don't be a mark, cause niggas might laugh you
Straight off the mutherfuckin block
Can't deal with bustas so they asses get clocked
Chyeah, who gives a fuck about another
Only got love for my fuckin gang brothers
Chyeah but I'm young so nobody would wonder
That the hood would take me under

Always strapped and eager to peel a cap
The hood done took me under
Always strapped and eager to peel a cap
The hood done took me under

Now I'm a few ages older
Got hair on my nuts and I'm a little bit bolder
And puttin in work, I has to do my fuckin part
I'm down for the hood and its planted in the heart
Fool, at school slappin' on the girls asses
Fuck the white education so I skip a lot of classes
Cause ain't no teaching a nigga white reality
Teach me the motherfuckin' gang mentality
Pop, pop, pop, drops the sucker
If he's from another hood I gots ta shoot the mutherfucker
Chyeah I'm in it to win it and can't quit
Fool, and ready die for this shit
One times can't fade the gang tuff
Putting my foot in your ass to make times rough
I'm the neighborhood terror but I never wondered
That the hood would take me under

Who I thought was my homie dropped the dime
So I gotta peel his cap with the nine
Fool, if its on then its on, fuck ya G
Because how the odds are looking fool, its either him or me
So I loads up the strap and I step
Cause my brain cells are dead and all I think is death
Revenge, chyeah, that's what its all about
See the sucker, take the mutherfucker out
Stare the fool down with the eye contact
He try to swing so I draw on him with the gatt
Blast was the sound that one times heard, uh

Was it worth it I've always wondered
Maybe if the hood didn't take me under

From Aretha to Aaliyah

To Bob Segar to

Joe Louis n' his arena and now me

Paradime the mic of overachievers

Smoking sewer caps, bottom feeders, and parking meters

A bunch of bad dudes in the mad brew and tattoos

So think twice before you pass through

Or get clapped through whack crews get hurt

We can take you for a ride (ride)

Or take you for your shirt (shirt)

I did it in the Bronx, I did in in Queens

And you can see me do it, do it, down in New Orleans
Fat backs and greens

I'm the scene of amazement

You'll be picking all your teeth up from the fuckin pavement

Is that Kracker with a C

No Kracker with a K

You could take Gratiot south, but that's a real rough route
You'll get found face down with your pockets hangin out

Got a bullet head dick with a thirty aught six
And from a thousand yards I'll hit ya right in the lips...shit

I keep climbing, but these charts ain't shit

Call me Kracker just be fuckin up spots like bleach

Worst in my division I got bitches on the file

From the Mississippi River on back to Belle Isle

I got style, but it dosn't show

I got more love for Detroit then you'll ever know

I know cats that sling crack and cats that scrap

Cats that bust beer bottles over baseball caps

Cats that get drunk and like to spark up skull cats

They keep sawed off chillin up in the trunks

Whores an 44's, scoops n' blow Faygo bitch

We run the mitten from the river way up to the farms

Immune to the decadence, I found some meaning
Places I've been in, slapping the demons
Cleansing the heathens, Land's End to St. Stephen's
Rhyme with no reason, son of the fifth season
Soon as I'm on the case, soon as I'm leaving

Rap life, you should've taught me better
From the very first day when I very first met ya
I seen the trends, the fads and the phases
The whole host of points of view brought to the stages
The sound of ""P"" made me feel more conscious
Tuned up my mind to the system design, but
Those were the days, the era of yester
Now the whole scene's progressed to pimps and OGs
Now I'm the fogey kicking the bogey
With nothing in between and no place for me
Yes I'll take to the trends and split the cliches

Defender of the soul fight and the soul decay

Friends ‎– how many of us have them?
Friends ‎– ones we can depend on
Friends ‎– how many of us have them?
Friends ‎– before we go any further, let's be
Friends

[Verse 1]
Is a word we use everyday
Most the time we use it in the wrong way
Now you can look the word up, again and again
But the dictionary doesn't know the meaning of friends
And if you ask me, you know, I couldn't be much help
Because a friend's somebody you judge for yourself
Some are ok, and they treat you real cool
But some mistake your kindness for bein' a fool
We like to be with some, because they're funny
Others come around when they need some money
Some you grew up with, around the way
And you're still real close to this very day
Homeboys through the Summer, Winter, Spring and Fall
And then there's some we wish we never knew at all
And this list goes on, again and again
But these are the people that we call friends
[Verse 2]
When we first went out together, we barely knew each other
We had no intentions, on becoming lovers
But in no time at all, you became my girl
Me and you, one on one, against the world
Talkin on the telephone for hours at a time
Or else I was at your house, or you was at mine
And then came the arguments and all kinds of problems
Besides making love, we had nothing in common
It could've lasted longer because it started out strong
But I guess we went about the whole thing wrong
'Cause out of nowhere it just came to an end
Because we became lovers before we were friends

Friends ‎– how many of us have them?
Friends ‎– ones we can depend on
Friends ‎– how many of us have them?

You say you and your girl friend were so tight
You took her out with you and your guy one night
She even had a set of keys to your home
And you shared mostly everything you owned
But as she shook your hand, she stole your man
And it was done so sweet, it had to be a plan
Couldn't trust her with cheese, let alone your keys
With friends like that you don't need enemies
You wonder how long it was all going on
And you’re still not sure if you’re glad he’s gone
You say, well if she took him he was never mine
But deep inside you know that's just another lie
And now you're kinda cold toward people you meet
'Cause of something that was done to you by some creep
But nevertheless, I'll say it again
That these are the people that we call friends

Five Minutes of Funk,Whodini,"['hip hop', 'blues', 'jazz', 'r&b', 'pop']","Now the party didn't start 'til I walked in
And I probably won't leave until the thing ends
But in the mean time, the in between time
If you work your thing, then I'll work mine
We came here together so we could have fun
Me and you baby, goin' one on one
Now this is the last chance for us to get off
So either get loose, or you aught to get lost
'Cause I'm just about ready to do my thing
'Cause I'm the stone cold, New York, Rap Machine
I'ma give you what I got, and baby that's plenty
And never has one man rocked so many
I'ma make you wet and make you sweat
Just to see how funky you can get
Now when I'm on the mic, I do serve well
And I go by the name of the Rapper Jalil

Four minutes left

Now sit back, relax, put on your head gear
Get ready for a trip through the Atmosphere
Gonna take you for a ride through the Twilight Zone
I don't need a space ship, I use my microphone
So hold on tight, with all your might
'Cause Ill be rappin' like this for the rest of the night
Its Jalil, yo, your master rapper
And when I'm on the mic its a sheer disaster
'Cause MC's crumble when we rumble
Some think I'm soft just because I'm humble
So all you MC's, I hope you're real good listeners
'Cause in this battle, I'm takin' no prisoners
I'm slayin' MC's right on the spot
'Cause I'm the the master of the Rap, the doctor of the Rock
The Jack of all Trades, The Master of One
And the thing I master is called havin' fun
We got three minutes left to rock this funk
To separate the good stuff from the junk, so
Get in the groove, and feel the sound
And once you're inside, spread yourself around
From the bottom to the top, the top to the bottom
Come on Master Dee and get funky while we got em
Three minutes left

Me and my partner, from the start
We usually get together, after dark
Sometimes to rap, sometimes to sing
In the Summer or the Winter cause it ain't no thing
And ever since I first came 'round
Side by side, we'd throw down
We came here to this here place
To serve you all right to your face
Because this jam here is our show stopper
We didn't wanna use it but I guess we gotta
We're the men of the hour, makin' the ladies scream and holler
Too hot to trot, too sweet to be sour
I'm gonna set the record straight
And I hope that it is not too late
If you want the best, I won't settle for less
Put your money on me, I'm your best bet
Come on
One for the treble
Two for the Bass
Three for the ladies
Four for the plaid
Five, minutes of funk, this ain't no junk
So pull your bottom off the tree stump
Ladies real pretty, from city to city
But now we're gettin' down to the nitty gritty
From the bottom to the top, the top to the bottom
Two minutes left

I'm gonna rock em, while I still got em
Our rappin' shower has style and power
And this, is our disco hour
I don't know what all of you have heard
So it's up to me to spread the word
About the man that we feel has got to be real
Our crowned Prince on the wheels of steel
He goes by the name of Grandmaster Dee
So if its alright with you, its alright with me
We gonna rock you people's minds with ease
With some help from the Maestro, if you please

One minute left

I'm sorry, your five minutes are up, please begin your ending, or your volume will be interrupted"
Rule,Nas,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Nas]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Nas, uh
Yo, yo
Life, they wonder, can they take me under?
Nah, never that, nah, yo, yo

[Verse 1: Nas]
I come from the housing tenement buildings
Unlimited killings, menaces marked for death
Better known as the projects where junkies and rock heads dwell
Though I owe to it my success
With survival of the fittest every day as a child
I would think I'm a part of U.S.A. and be proud
Confronted with racism, started to feel foreign
Like, the darker you are the realer your problems
I reached for the stars, but I just kept slipping
On this life mission, never know what's next
Ancient kings from Egypt up to Julius Caesar
Had a piece of the globe, every continent
Yo, there's Asia, Africa, Europe, France, Japan
Pakistan, America, Afghanistan
Yo, there's Protestants, Jews, Blacks, Arabics
Call a truce, world peace, stop acting like savages
No war, we should take time and think
The bombs and tanks makes mankind extinct
But since the beginning of time, it's been men with arms fighting
Lost lives in the Towers and Pentagon, why then
Must it go on? We must stop the killing
Tell me why we die, we all God's children
[Chorus: Nas and Amerie]
All this hate can't last forever (Uh, come on)
It's time that we stand together (Yeah, for the world)
Everybody wants to rule the world (What? What? What? What? What? Come on)
World (Peace)
World (Peace)
World (Peace)
World

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yo, there's brothers on the block, posted up like they own it
That's they corner, from New York to California
Got blocks locked down
Like, ""Dog you safe whenever you with me, see, this is my town""
So the youngsters grows in ghettos, goes to prison
At a early age already know what's against him
So in order for him to survive
One day he must open up his eyes to the setbacks and rise
'Cause everybody wants a shot
In this land of opportunity, look at what this country's got
There shouldn't be nobody homeless
How can the president fix other problems when he ain't fixed home yet?
The Earth wasn't made for one man to rule alone
To all colors and creeds is to whom it belongs
I want land, mansions, banks, and gold
The diamonds in Africa, oil in my control
The world's natural resources, all its residuals
But then comes foes, I have to guard it with missiles
And I become the most wanted
But is it worth hearing a million people problems and followed by Secret Service?
I guess, attempts at my life with loaded barrels
So move over Colin Powell or just throw in the towel, yo
[Chorus: Nas and Amerie]
All this hate can't last forever (Uh, come on)
It's time that we stand together (Yeah, for the world)
Everybody wants to rule the world (What? What? What? What? What? Come on)
World (Peace)
World (Peace)
World (Peace)
World

[Verse 3: Nas]
Y'all know that's my style, to hit you at the right time
No other compares to what Nas write down
Tell you my dreams, show you my pain is yours
You could get what you love, be a chain in cause
You alive right now
There's so many that's dead or locked up inside the beast, I'm a highlight now
It's whatever man think of manifest to the real
The plan is to wake up 'cause time reveals
All this hate can't forever last
All my ghetto heroes in Heaven, it's like you right here and never passed
You just transcend, I know I'm gon' see you again
Hoping I reach the world leaders and win
Ain't nothing without struggle, listen up, it's critical
We used to fear arms, now the weapons are chemical
In hip-hop, the weapons are lyrical
To be the best, you challenge the best, then the blessings are spiritual
Top of the world for the kid, none less
Poppin' any rapper's head off his shoulders, no contest
I know the Most High hear me, so fly you can't near me
You scared of a mirror, my theory is that knowledge is power
To every projects and every street corner, we gotta get ours now
[Outro: Nas and Amerie]
All this hate can't last forever
It's time that we stand together
Everybody wants to rule the world
World

[Outro: Skit]
Yo, niggas ain't forget shit, know what I'm saying?
Niggas ain't forget nothing, man
Men, women and children killed by the police and shit
Niggas ain't gon' forget that, man, you know what I mean?
Yo, what this war just show me is, like
Whatever you want out of life, whatever you feel is rightfully yours
Go out and take it, even if that means blood and death
You know, that's what I was raised up on, that's what this country's about
This is— This is what my country is
And my country's a motherfucker"
Crackhead Superheroes,Mighty Casey,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
We don't need another hero
They're just crackheads and crack ho's
Wacko's and weirdo's
It sounds funny but I know that it's true
That deep down inside man they just like you

[Verse 1]
I heard The Flash was on speed and the Hulk was on crack
Batman got bagged up fpr beating on blacks
Spiderman shooting up, you could tell by the tracks
G.I Joe killed a hundred little kids in Iraq
Wonderwoman went down, she had hard times
Now she sniff coke and she strip part time
And I heard Professor X was molesting all the X-Men
Messed with Jean Grey's head since she was a freshman
Democratic Autobots Republican Decipticons
Bush is like Starscream Cheyney's like Megatron
Fuck the whole world up, fighting over ?
Don't give a fuck about who the fuck they stepping on
Now you got Lionel cheating on Jitara
Add a couple furballs and say he hate the father*
That's how I know all these heroes ain't that super
Cause Clark killed Louis, she was fucking with Lex Luther
[Hook]

[Verse 2]

Watch who you look up to, find out what they up to
Some of them nuts too, messed up and fucked up too
They like to fuck too drink and do drugs too
Some of them gangsters, some of them thugs too
Some like to front too, some is corrupt too
Watch your back they might try to corrupt you
They say trust me when they mean fuck you
They say love me but nah they ain't love you

Watch who you idolize look into they private lives
You mighty see they whole life is a lot of lies
Rip off a lot of guys, lie committ a lof crimes
And when they do get caught they don't apologize
They just lie again blame it on some other guys

Watch who says who's good and who's evil
Cuz evil plays good and these villains play heroes"
The Longest Text Message,Childish Gambino,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus]
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you

[Verse 1]
First off, let me say I'm drunk off of shitty wine
So I'll probably use the B word a couple times
I used to love your fucking mouth, you had enough of mine
But what's the reason for, you never gave me any sign
When we were making out, you kind of act like it was nothing
Like you were doing it to prove you could do it or something
You know I'm fine with getting fucked by girls who are my friends
You fucked me in a different way, I guess it all depends
Texting on my day off, ""Hey babe what's going on?""
""Sorry I can't make it out"", sad face emoticon
It's funny how I see you with these bad boys you hanging on
I told ya I'm a soldier need a girl scout to tag along
Face down, ass up, that's the way you left me
I thought there was a spark but we were missing Lisa Leslie
""You know it's fucking childish to write a song to get me!""
I'm always fucking childish, you knew that when you met me
[Chorus]
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you

[Verse 2]
You ain't that fine, bitch what the fuck you heard?
I love these shitty ass chicks I guess I'll never learn
I hate it when you think you really getting something good
And you don't listen to your dudes when you really should
I got so many fucking girls, I can't even count 'em
There's probably six or seven girls who think this song's about them
Never kiss in public, but at home I am affectionate
Fucking bitches left and right, my dick is ambidextrous
I know you probably texting this lyric to your friends
Saying ""This nigga think he all that. He fucking sucked in bed"", well uhh…
I think we both know that I worked that ass
I hope your dude can keep it stretched, yoga class
I'm trying hard not to use a specific reference
But you'll probably know that it's you after the first sentence
So let me quit while I'm ahead like a penis tip
If I never was in love with you I hope you know I'm meaning it

[Chorus]
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you

Whered You Go,Fort Minor,"['alternative', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
She said, ""Some days, I feel like shit
Some days, I wanna quit and just be normal for a bit""
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along, but the trips always feel so long
And I find myself trying to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, working my day around the call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here, singing, ""Where'd you go?""

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Come back home, you know, the place where you used to live
Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile
But now, you only stop by every once in a while
Shit, I find myself just filling my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doing fine, and I’m planning to keep it that way
You can call me if you find that you have something to say

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here, singing, ""Where'd you go?""

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, no longer debating
Tired of sitting and hating and making these excuses
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless
It seems one thing has been true all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back, I won't be here and you can sing it
[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

[Post-Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home

Cult Shit,"Tyler, The Creator","['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
I'm recordin' that shit on the fuckin' little mic
By the little camera thing on the fuckin' Mac book
So this shit is choppy and bad quality, but fuck it
Wolf Gang, Ace Creator

[Verse 1]
Somebody tell Justin Beiber that I'm fuckin' coming
Ain't no point in runnin', I'm a nigga, just a little quicker
So I catch him stretchin', have him guessin' where his cracker throat
Chop his balls off and use his skin to make a baby coat
Ain't he dope? No, he the same as shit that Tyler wrote
This is Ace, Wolf is in the back with Travis snortin' coke
Riley's here, Connie's dead, pickin' pussy pisses pike
She won't leave, dick as big as Kelly Price's appetite
Apprehend a couple men, triple six is fuckin' sin
Make Queen Latifah and Sydney go slap a couple dykes
Wrap around 'til they hit the ground and they hear a sound
That doesn't make sense like nigga kids wearing cap and gowns
This my album, and when your parents try to come around
Do the fuckin' exact opposite of turnin' it down
And when they try to get parental and start talkin' loud
Tell them that you're from the Wolf Gang and you're fuckin' proud
Then start barkin' loud 'til the neighbors wanna calm you down
But call the pigs, who'll probably come in bout a half an hour
Tell them that your sorry, you're a cow, took a fuckin' shower
But make it in time for shitty re-runs of Rocket Power
This is the shit that is makin' me cynical
The clinical attempts at schizophrenia's critical
Fuckin' voices follow me, emulatin' like twitter roll
O.F. is a cult, assume that I'm the fucking general
So when I mention suicide, I'm being Mr. Literal
The coke inside nine capsules, fuck it let's split a roll
Life is like a phone booth, these pigeons is the fuckin' toll
1-800-fuck-this-shit
Seven years old in my heart, so I'm stayin' gold
But when I fuckin' go, Lucifer will probably have my soul
It's hot down there, fuck that, bitch I'm hot as coals
Out the microwave, mixed with a bowl of yellow raviol
And a firetruck and Arizona durin' summertime
In a turtle neck, thermal jeans, spit purple wine
Wolf Gang pete and gon' live, running outta time
The fuck I give is the same as the next line
[Outro]
(Fuck everything) That's what my conscience said
Then it bunny hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead
So the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement
Actions speak louder than words, let me try this shit"

Shot is stacked
Rock your hair
Watch my mirror
Stocking caps so I watch my style
Cock and grab
Open up shop and draft
Quarter bags all of that
Water lasts shorter halves
Have ya comin back cause I'm fourth of stash
Extort the hash
Extort the wrath
Cope the past
Brought my mags
Sort my cash on the docks
Flock a hop
Keep it in a proper spot
Adopt a cop
Rob a spot

Drop a pot
Slide a lot
Jackpot a lot
Already got a lot of wine, but not in my ride, I'll stop

He'll mangle us
Who playing with us?
And saying this stuff?
And fuck with gangs and stuff?
I aim to bust
You straight up tough
No thanks to us
We're famous, duh
A game I love
To train my sluts
To give brains and cuss
Learn pain and plus
Get tricks to claim the bust
Think they nuts
Slurp them up
Hook or work them up
Wake them up, break them up
Taking crust shake them up
Make it stuck in your twat
Hit the streets, bend the blocks
Sin or not, hit the daily spot
Gin or scotch, top notch
On my roster
Mobster eating pasta
Chop her in the closer, crack her like a lobster
Have my ho to rob you
Then dodge you
Any ho need work?  I got a job for you
Go see the supplier
Make like you a buyer
Then buy slut, trick these fake playas
Often what they say, you'll buy em up messiah
Wait and bring it bacj to my empire
Chingy keep these heffers on the strip and on fire
Try her

Chrome grille in front of it, belts on the back of it
My chromey shoes runnin' shit
Shorty on the side of me is straight up off the King cover (Cover)
Don't care what anybody say long as the king love her (Love her)
Wish I could tell her that I don't but it would kill her
I just keep on grippin' grain (Drippin' stain), bein' trilla
Ain't another brother realer, blowin' thousand dollar killa
With that Filipino flow that I just got in from Manila
'Bout to snow up in my city so let me put on my chinchilla
In the 'Rari doing donuts like my name was J Dilla (Dilla)
All about the skrilla so just point me to the dealer
Keep the work up in the attic and the money in the cellar (Cellar)
Your girl up in the second, automatics for the fellas (Fellas)
You see us in the back then all you gotta do is tell us

What up? What up?

Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1: Fabolous, Lil' Mo]
Baby girl, you know my situation
And sometimes I know you get impatient
But you don't put on a show to get ovations
Take it to court and go through litigations
And I respect you, gangsta
Treat you like a princess and put some on your neck to thank ya
She's my pinch hitter
When the startin' lineup ain't playin' right
I come off the bench wit' her
It might sound like I'm gassin' ya
But it take time to get from the backseat to the passenger
We been creepin' and sneakin' just to keep it from leakin'
We so deep in our freakin' that we don't sleep on the weekend
Wifey's a little bit uptight
Wonder why I keep coming home in the middle of the night
It'll be alright, if y'all bump heads, it'll be a fight (Mmm)
But I said it'll be alright, c'mon
[Chorus: Mike Shorey, Lil' Mo, Both]
I really wanna be wit' you (Be wit' you)
But I gotta be real wit' you (Real wit' you)
I can't leave you alone (No)

You ain't never step outta line or get outta pocket
So I made sure canary sent out your locket
To protect you, I'll get out and cock it
And you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket (Oh)
You gon' play dumb if cops do come through
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through
But I know the boutiques and shops you run through
So I cop her one and cop you one too
You always get a daily page, weekly ring
Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger
Or worry 'bout you tellin' the whole world I'm your man while I spring her
At first you was somethin' I denied
Somethin' I would slide just to do somethin' in the ride
But shorty, there's somethin' you provide
'Cause the entrée ain't as good (Mmm)
Without somethin' on the side, you know?

Uh
Uh-oh, I might be leavin' the earth soon
My girl gon' kill me if she smell the scent of your perfume
It's gon' be a clip tossed if I go back
With stains of your lip gloss on my throwback
She won't care if I'm a platinum rapper
If she catch me wit' a empty Magnum wrapper (Ooh, yeah)
So keep it on the down low, call the car celly (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You seen what happened with Mr. Bigg and R Kelly, uh
You know I care for you (Care for you)
Anytime this chick is there for you (There for you, yeah)
These feelings I'ma share wit' you
Which makes it a little more clear for you

Everyday it's the same thing, L.A. ain't changed
Niggas still playa hating, but Dre ain't changed
I'm just a lot smarter now
Cause these niggas is banging ten times harder now
Niggas bringing they ass up in the wrong part of town
Better turn their car around
Rolling the window down (Hey can we talk it out?)
(Nah, get the fuck out!)
Johnny got a shotgun
And he ain't even strong enough to cock one
Fuck trying to job hunt
Niggas got AK's
Niggas is way crazier than Dre was back in his N.W.A. days
Niggas spray strays and shoot without looking
Niggas walk by and blast, without leaving a footprint
I think the attitudes are twice as worst
It takes half the time to get your whole life reversed
Always trying to play Rambo with they ammo
Make a nigga wanna stay in family mode

[Verse 2: Knoc-turn'al]
Late nights is full of lead that whistles as it goes by
Murder arrives, anytime
Bullets take flight when the fo'-five ignites
Some hearts skip a beat, some get blew out, and never re-light
With you in the site of youngsters with automatics
Busting on shit to lay everything down even tourists to non-affiliates
These days, gun play is official with green lights on every block
Though the sign tells you too it's not best to stop
On every corner, Cali niggas are dumping
You'll be shaking your soul loose from the box at the coroner's
Making death not so foreign to ya
Niggas got Rugers and M14's with enough ammo to leave
An armored truck Swiss cheese
I've learned to stay away from house parties
I've seen too many go and end up absent without leave
Ain't no warm welcomings
My eyes have witnessed the bend in on
Nights that don't sleep, and fireworks until dawn

Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is

[Verse 3: Hittman]
Now tell me, what the fuck is this man?
Niggas doing brothers in worse than the Klan
Can't even stand
In front of your building and chill without yielding
Twelve year old children that kill, blood spilling
Thugs be illing, unnecessary slugs filling the sky
Usually drilling the one that wasn't willing to die
Yes sir, in the Killing Field I got my life preserver
And I'll do my time for murder
These niggas got the nerve to question me
'Bout the colors that I got on?
I see that red dot on your knot
'Bout to get your whole crew shot on
A Soldier of Fortune, I'm the wrong man to plot on
Took him out on the spot before he even got on my hit list
Peep this
I cock back, you bow down
Bust round, bloody the ground
Retaliation sounds like this

[Verse 1]
These bitches think their better than Latin Hustle but there wrong
I'll kill all these motherfuckers by the end of this song
Headshot to the dome one shot and you're gone
Let u cry as I crush u breakin' all of your bones
You stepped in the death zone
Now you pray the price
Cause these bitches steppin' to me bout to lose they life
They think they can betray me, but they crazy
They might as well be underground pushin' up daisies
Nigga u might hate me but your hate is my power
And I could knock your ass out just like the twin towers
Shout out to the homies Young E and Lil' Ace
Latin Hustle in this bitch takin' over the place
Exposin' u for what u really are a rappin' disgrace
And if u wanna talk shit then say it to my face

[Verse 2]
Judge me cause ima girl ill leave your ass
In the past Bitch u wanna judge me ill shoot the shit out your ass
Put u in a mask Nd fill it wit a toxic gas
And watch u gasp and gasp until ur muthafuckin' heart blast
In fact ill use u as a demonstration
Best respect me if u test me, ill kill u withhout complication
And ill be all over the news like an alien invasion
Cause Latin Hustle's takin' over this white ass nation
Look u now your ass is gettin' burned by me
I'm Lady Flow ima girl but your the real pussy
I'm murderin' your ass, its over, take your fakin' ass and leave
Find a new place to fake cause we takin' over the streets"
Till I Get There,Lupe Fiasco,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Album on hold, whole world on hold
The crowd is like, ""HO!"", operator's like, ""Hold"" (""Please hold"")
Man, now ain't that cold
I'm just tryin' to talk to my homie that's up in the hole
And homegirl not tryin' to be a ho, even though she on a pole
Can she get a second chance? No
Whoa, like the opposite of go
That ain't how it's supposed to be or butterfly
But for the sake of rhyming, let's just say butterfly-ee
The truth stings like Muhammad Ali
I tell 'em, tell 'em, don't homicide me
I'm just a little old hope with his back against the ropes
Fightin' for his fans and fightin' for his folks
But the boos from the crowd can become so loud
If I can block 'em out then, I could knock 'em out and
Dance around the ring but until then I'll sing

I'ma keep it cool and I'ma do me
It is what it is and it's how it's gon' be
Until I get there
Till I get there
And yeah I got flaws, I know I'm not perfect
But all the ups and downs will soon be worth it
When I get there
When I get there, whoa, oh
[Verse 2]
Doctor, doctor please, the fame ain't painless enough
""That's cause you ain't famous enough
You got a little game but your name ain't ringin' enough""
He said ""Take two of these, put some change in my cup""
I said I wasn't poor, he gave me some more
Prescribed me a publicist and pointed to the door
Out, ouch
I'm tellin' you this all from a therapist's couch
""Tell me about your mother, what she's all about""
Prescribed me a interview and then told me to bounce
Damn, jeez
The world is so cold, I'm glad I bought these skis
Went right off of the bunny slopes and right into the trees
Rendered unconscious, they rushed me to a concert
Instead of green jello and maybe chicken soup
They fed me magazine covers and video shoots

[Hook]
I'ma keep it cool and I'ma do me
It is what it is and it's how it's gon' be
Until I get there
Till I get there
And yeah I got flaws, I know I'm not perfect
But all the ups and downs will soon be worth it
When I get there
When I get there, whoa, oh
[Verse 3]
And when I finally make it, I'ma stunt so hard
Evil as Knievel, I'ma jump so far
Way up in the atmosphere, I ain't comin' back
Be a jerk to them jerks, yeah, that'll make 'em hurt
""Huh?"" said a young boy in the mirror
A young version of me, so I started to tear up
He said ""You need to cheer up, your mind need to clear up
You're already here, just be yourself from here up""
Then he disappeared and I felt something familiar
Somethin' I was taught, somethin' I had lost
If you are afraid or fear that you gon' change some
All you gotta do is just remember where you came from

[Hook]
I'ma keep it cool and I'ma do me
It is what it is and it's how it's gon' be

'(Brrrrrr!) Tell them now rasta!'

[Verse 1: Klashnekoff]
K (K!) lash your rasclat neck off
I'll split you in half like a gun blast from Lennox (Lennox!)
Hotter than flammable rocks
From the manor when man are animal nyammin you like fox
Experts slosh, we specialize in handlin' cop
With man's hatching and planning plots looking to jam in your spot
But their stamina's not up to par get ripped apart like red Rizla to raas, (raasclaat!)
This Terra Firm 'dargart' state of the art
But tell them jankrows to stay in their yard
Or get stabbed with a stake to the heart
I'm tryna walk a straight path but d'y'know say it's hard
Sick thoughts of flinging on mask
And killing your claat
Keep runnin' through the back of my head like old dance steps
Get dropped on your doorstep like Dando
Many man ran prang cuz my nang flow's badder than Taliban still ban shows
Spit flows over bhangra, spit so cold make you shook out like it was SOCA
Terra Firma take over take you through the mind state of a tortured soldier
Who tells tales of unspeakable horror with lyrics lethal like borer
Leave you leaking on the floor star
That's why I don't watch no talk
I read auras and books written by forbidden government authors
Infiltrate your border like ITN reporters
Then return with the slaughter
Captured on camcorder, I'm trapped in a damn corner chatting to Pandora
'Bout boxing a man for her
But she don't know me, Klashnekoff
That black cunt from out of Stokey
Banana boat mango munching monkey kick off your door like Jumanji
Dash you off the 28th floor like it was bungee, ah wah di bloodcleet

It's Murda, them man can't test the Terra Firma
It's Murda, they'll find your body buried in suburbia
Murda, pride take man for fucking with Tina Turner
It's Murda, Murda, Murda, Murda

[Verse 2: Klashnekoff]
I'm not ready to die but ever ready for bury a guy
They're not ready for I
I can see the fear in they eye
Scared of the rhymes that ricochet and tear them inside
Some fear for they lives
Prepare and try to stare in my eyes
Wife cry bucket of tears
When the brere get iced but that's life
It's all live, ride rhythms like a dive spit cyanide saliv'
And blind your left eye
Subliminal crime, snipe you in the back of you mind
With killer quotes and one lines that cuts throats like knives
Baffle the fives can't fathom how the fuck did he die
One tux and a tie with twenty-one bucks to the sky
Asking me why a brethren is deeper than I
This piece by my side lookin' to eat a piece of the pie
So come in peace or draw your piece or please reach for the sky
My ether is nine, like nine, millimetres times nine
Millimetres times nine, millimetres from your spine
So take time my rhymes take life like Tek-9's
And we take wives from guys who flex their chest size

Badder the spanner banner with a black bandana
Darren-D the dan dapper wrap the trees like strappa!
Stab the beat with a dagger the Hackney hack attacker
Shabby like shabba shabby like Shaggy verse just shut up
In this sick, sick city situations get butters
Man switch like Baracas, Come swingin' like McGuigan With a barrage of punches The spit boxin' champion
Who spark man unconscious and knock out their dentures
See the drugs don't work, they just make you worse
Man smoke a little merch and feel say he can't get hurt; that's absurd
You'll get sliced up and served like hors d'oeuvres
Buried six feet deep like sword in the dirt
While you frauds shot work from the back of your Mercs
I reverse the hearse stick 'em in the back of the boot
And baffle you fools you cunts can't 'ackle this youth
Or tackle my crew get beaten 'til you're blacker than blue
While I'm strapping a zoot you on the floor catching a boot
Looking to catch a blag blood but that's a catch 22
And you done know the crew

What up Jean, you know theres a lot of nonsense in the streets right now, you see it right? Tell 'em whats up

[Jean Grae]

Possibly I could, dropping some knowledge I should
But I ain't finish college and I'm not a Kanye, got it? Good
Intelligent rhetoric, brain packed like a tenement
Aimed back at the tenants, my face crack in a venomous rage
I really wanna blaze all you, burn you like 8 whores do
Hurl you like Florida storm furniture
Permanent marker Jean is tagging blacking up on your partners penis
Pardon the phoenix I mark you plus I bark the meanest
Hardly elitist, I know the struggle
I mostly bubble underground like a soda below some broken rubble
At ground zero, I get down nigga, like them brown people
Saturday Night, Geechi Suede and Sonny Cheeba, lift ya
I'll levitate the scriptures just so I can see 'em better
Each and every letter was conceived by Jean I'm the Coretta
Scott King of my day I mean, standing by my mate, my king
Planning for Jamaica honeymooning, vacationing
Cd breaking in, skipping on this track like I've been scraping it
Scraping it, scraping it, bring it back
Sicker than rap. I'll stick you with a picket axe
Pick up your soul and then control it whats bigger than that?
You don't like the way I flow? ""She needs more emotion""? No
I'll give you emotion its you holding your broken nose
And leave you comatose with a pound of Columbia snow
At your side when the cops arrive, they'll just say you overdosed
This ain't a battle, I would make your cranium rattle
Skull in pain as if a hundred veins had popped a dangerous madam
The Heidi Fleiss of words, like a verse, find a purse
I could make you love me if you fuck with me violence occurs
New York pimp game the worst chick since the birth of the words
That I first met on a Thursday I think I'm cursed
Don't blink niggas, cause I will figure
A way to kill you in a second with my ring finger
Think quicker, my visions multiplied like liquor drinkers

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Now, they say you ain't never suppose to envy no man
Can't tell that to a dingy old man
Who see a young nigga getting plenty of dough, man
Icy Audemar, Henny gold band
With a mean girl like Lindsay Lohan
That's why I keep the 9 in the Bentley door pan
Trust it's gon' bust you roll on us
Know it's gon' blow fo' my dough
Why would you try with that guy?
Scene told you he'd keep it G
We can bang like the two chains on my neck
The hood is Iraq, I'm Hussein in the 'jects
The coup's up, take the new lane for a sec
12"" thump, new Kane in the deck nigga
Right now with a squeezer in a 'cuzzi
And I'm goin out like Keyshia with the UZI, yeah
[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
They talk about it, we all about it
They making plans, we sit and count it
Our cheddar stackin' just like a mountain
You heard about it, she running her mouth
She want's to ride it, she's trying to hide it
I'm cool as Hell but she's too excited
Her man look like he wanna fight
But he ain't doing nothing but running his mouth

[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.]
Fuck around and feel the fury of a high nigga
When I get busy throw your hands in the sky nigga
I got the illest of the ill mentality, niggas be grabbing me
Knowing that they'd rather be stabbing me
All up in my back trying to take my track
When I used to sell crack I ain't had problems like that
Street rules, watch your pockets and your jewels
A nigga front, throw the gat to the fool
Next who wanna move is getting blasted
Streets to a flows from the ill ghetto bastard
As I release masterpieces like adhesive
Stuck to your ass, like tissue when your wiping fast
MC's have a hard time believin'
I'm Marked For Death, Hard to Kill like Steven
When Jake come, I'm leaving, the black man's motto
You got a better chance playing lotto
What you want nigga?

Ayo, now watch me dip-dip-di-dive all over the beat
Now watch me drip-drip-dri-di all over the street
The general consensus is you'll be the dominating fleet
Bitch raw, and let me continue to bring the heat
You know who been the kings of the block, the kings of the drops
The kings of the crack music and the kings of the clubs
Niggas fire then drop shit like the purest of powder
That's why most of these niggas little songs be sounding like our's
Couple years ago, niggas probably thought I was dying
Now same niggas are idolizing put our face in the shrine
Yeah, I took a little time to cook and show you what's really hot
How the fuck any of you niggas think you filling my spot?
Why you niggas getting mad at us? We shit on your floors
All in your house nigga, our strategies is different from yours
Listen, you come you can do it while I continue to preach
Snoop, Fab, Big and Bust of the stand if you can't reach

Who fucking with Fox? Who want it with I?
Bust a shot for me and Big from the ville from the sky
Got my joan fross shit on, hop off my dick

Pull up the Phantom, show 'em how we switch

Bedstuy what up y'all, what up with your girl
How she leave dude broke tell them boys on work
I'm in the G5 jedi, Brooklyn what's your chrome
Cause that niggas lying home if the tutti with the dead-eye
My nigga Neck got hit up in his truck
On Nastrand Ave, ain't the same since Homo got touched
Nasty with the pistol, nasty with the clit
See I'm a beast with it, fucking 'til I'm crippled
Ill Na Na, squeezing the llama

Yo, uh
Lifestyles of the young, black, and genius
Sons strapped with guns packed in jeans
And the blunts got my lungs black as Jesus, (yea)
Play where killers hung at and slung crack for leisure
And tell a nigga run that, get gun clapped for sneakers
Young niggas emulate what's coming out the speakers
So everything we learn came from rappers, not teachers
'Cause if we can't relate, then how the hell you gonna reach us?
Surrounded by crooked cops and preachers (yeah)
Who am I trusting?
No time to think about illegal when your stomachs touching
By any means, nigga, even if the gun is busting
I see the world for what it is now
I see the odds is looking slim for our kids now
'Cause, uh, it wasn't set up for my people to rise, (yea)

And I don't blame 'em, it's a cold world, live it up! (live it up)

And rollers on the block, my niggas on the curb, cursing them (fuck)
Another day in the Ville, do I stay in and chill? (no)
Or go play in the field?
Help my mother paying these bills, you tell me, nigga!
We young, black, some strapped
Them whites got they lunch pack for school, we had our guns packed
And all a nigga wanna do is take his momma from that
But they'd rather lock us up and make sure we don't come back
You kill a nigga over beef and cheddar? Even better
Just one less coon they won't have to arrest soon
Fuck a crooked cop three times
Bitch, I'm getting cake and ain't a nigga finna eat mine
That's why a nigga looking like a street sign (yeah)
Posted on the corner 'til it's sleep time
Wake up and it's feeling like somebody hit the rewind (why?)
'Cause them ghetto birds circulate, my niggas still cursin em
Another day in the city, my niggas say it with me, yeah

Question is - can I get some? Know what I'm saying?
Ack-rite, bitch
When I see you in the spot, you just act right, you know what I'm saying?
When I yank you by the fuckin' arm
Don't be looking at a nigga crazy
Just give up the digits and be the fuck out, you know what I'm saying?
Let me break it down for y'all

[Verse 1: Hittman]
It was just one of those days
When I wanted to catch sunrays
It`s fun to gitt blunted on a Sunday afternoon
Nigga Bathed & got groomed, grabbed the gat for misbehavors
And the chocolate flavored boom, lost in hip-hop tunes
Zoom-zoom like the Commodores
Wonder will we have drama or, end up clowning whores
Round up four good-to-go girls
Like them Barbary Coast girls, riding shotgun, baby
I be postin all-world in the ride
Sipping 151 done gave me too much pride to back down
Soon as we get to The Beach I'mma put my fuckin mack down
I'm playin lead, not the background
It's time to put Bronson on the map now
Walk with my hand on my Johnson, crack a smile
Cuties peep my style, if I don't get some ackrite
I'mma have to ack-wild
[Hook: Hittman]
Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice
(Aight? And a give a nig' some ackrite)
I'm the type of nigga playa-haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
(Aight? So give a nig' some ackrite, right)

[Hittman]
Uhhhhh.. drink kicking in, I'm stimulated
For those that don't know big words: I'm FUCKIN FADED
Eighty-three degrees, ease to a shaded spot
Our first spot was cool till some gangsters made it hot
Now we plot and pose
Plus we watchin hoes, with lots of flesh exposed
Getting swarmed by those type of niggas
With no game but brown-nose
So I impose only like pros can
""Yo, is this your man?"" ""No.""
Grab the bitch's hand, ""I'm Hittman.""
Bling! Gold chain gleam
""You're very eligible for my summer league team.""
Maybe too extreme cause the sister got steamed
Then Miss Thing tried to scream on my brethren
I got mad, spit phlegm on the name
Stefan, tattooed on her arm
Ho you ain't the bomb, must be a dyke
Gitcho' lips swoll, or give a nig' some ackrite
[Hook: Hittman]
Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice
(And a give a nig' some ackrite)
I'm the type of nigga playa-haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
(So give a nig' some ackrite, right)

[Hittman]
Fronting on the ack-rite, causing me to act up
Good Samaritans save that ho from getting slapped up
My homies crack up at the scene I made
Yo my actions ain't serene when a nigga's on fade
If it wasn't for the one-time brigade
I woulda sprayed at the hooker tramp
As cops parade I'm afraid it's time to break camp
Make tracks, where else can we go to take hoes
From fake macks? {*CAR HORN*} Aiyyo, chase them girls
In that black Maxima, the passenger, almost fractured her
Neckbone, looking back at us
Plus, they on the dick cause the Caddy's plush
They blush, I bumrush the huss, with the largest crush
Try to swing an ep tonight so I don't have to keep in touch
Keep it on hush without the tippin`
Macking interrupted by some niggas set-tripping
Clip in the strap, I showed these niggas how to act

Eatin' this fuckin track like there were nothin' here for dinner
Attentions what we all want I am in the center
And its rightful I'm spiteful I found out who you wife'd fool

Pretty women notice me and fall like some autumn leaves
Guess they think alot of me
Everything you oughta be
My money is a part of me so fuck you and your policies
Sometimes I get the feelin' I am the peoples property
Life is crazy complicated then I smoke alot of weed

Drink alot of liquor have alot of sex
Addictive lifestyle it'll prolly be the death of me
Hope my momma never hear this shit and then think less of me
You don't know how this pressure be I guess I got some stress in me
Times I wanna spaz show the world the Kanye West in me
But fuck it im'ma star the American dream
Like we not out and I.I. smoking the Canadian green
I'm higher than Aladdin and his arabian queen
Carpet in the sky told you I was fly
Came to knock em down so I love the way they lie
I run this enterprise got a complicated mind
And I dumb it down for you stupid niggas every time
I'm sicker every line they wish that I'd decline

Tryin to come up on somethin, bubblin
I'mma say this really really really loud
Y'all wanna bubble I'll bust them, rush them
Trust him never, on a whole 'nother level
If God the creator then y'all niggas devils
The fight won't end 'til the war get settled
And Bone gon' win cause them Bone niggas rebels
Playa, yeah, nigga!
[Hook]

[Krayzie Bone]
They don't wanna see me shine
Everybody wanna sound like Bone though, come back in the Bone zone
If you just beginnin with the daddy you don't know
They call me the granddad, Granddaddy of the Bone flow
Well little lazy rappers, obviously we never figured
This would be the lick and we'd be next to shine
And we got everybody screamin and singin
But these out-of-shape suckers need exercise
So I'mma get up in their mental
I'mma work 'em out over the instrumental
Give 'em a criminal rhythm, the lyrical nympho
Wanna see the wicked, better know what you're in fo'
First offense, that could be forgiven, you didn't know
Second time I got up in 'em like here we go
No matter what they sayin we still the most
Realest, that ever did it (did it) feel me flow
Everybody want a little bit of this
The lil' Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish and Flesh
A little taste so they can test and make 'em see how we the best
And how we realer than the rest, don't flex cause the pump gon' get 'em
I'm like a bullet to the chest, suffer cardiac arrest
That's so hard that I can still get their heart and leave 'em dead
Give 'em all they can get
Send them suckas to the lyric cemetary or the rap hospital
Never no competition!
[Hook]

[Flesh-N-Bone]
C'mon, now let me take you back to The Land
You know where, the heart of it all
In 1993 when we was up out the scene
The fellas with hell of a harmony with the flow hooked up with Eazy-E
Shook up the industry and y'all just in time, to get another facelift
Certainly this somethin that you wouldn't wanna miss
The drama when it hit the fan, we got 'em trippin off the gift
And split a wig up with a pretty sick twist
We working like a surgeon on your dome
Exactly what I cut you with is sharper than a scalpel
Actually, it's too many Bone Thug clones and they all malpractice
Arrested and send 'em to the gallows
My Trues brought a style that's unfound
And you can feel it naturally but we ain't no magicians
Really ain't no thang to make a fraud disappear
Steady givin what they love to hear
We make 'em listen up close, everybody know we got the dough
We choppin nothin but missiles, still the nigga who the greatest
Y'all lost, can't even afford the cost
This is authentic and nothin that's dealin with the worldwide bosses
We got the sauce, baby we got the juice
We keep 'em in a frenzy fiendin for mo'
On the ThugLine with F.B.G., 7th Sign and Mo Thug
Once again we about to blow, we about to blow
Set it off explode, set it off explode!
[Hook]

[Wish Bone]
I'mma treat it like a race and I gotta win it
Ahead of you bums with the Bone flow Thug invented
Haters wonder why them thug niggas still gettin in
Nothin changed the game like we did so we here, still with it
Gotta tell the truth, we changed thangs
Bringin somethin new that's everlasting
I'mma keep it real, it's next to nothing
Doin the same thing is less creating
Flow just borin, your spit's just corny
What happened to old bitin self? Writin battles done face to face
I miss those days, these days
Ghost writers, fake artists with nothin to say
I'mma give it where it's due, my street dudes just stay cool
I know I got you when I need to pop it you'll let loose
And you don't wanna see a Thugsta hit with a Grey Goose
Or we could buy the bar, just stay cool and we good
Recognize street thug, coulda been all hood
The flow's so love, thugs reppin in all hoods
Pick up on it, never fully get it, this Bone flow
Smilin, hatin but you see me on the low low
In the game with the number one, straight from the Cleveland slums
Straight off the block, never hustle to the flo' though
Keep it or not, how them Bone Thugs came through
Yeah yeah, we took it to another level (level)
Level (level) level (level) yeahhh!

[Hook]

[Bizzy Bone]
As soon as I'm receivin the call, now give me the ball
I run with the dawgs then keep the ball
Now meet me at the mall, you can check on every shelf on the wall
They makin money off the Bone Thugs, equipped for the show
With a knife in my back, everybody rappin fast
But the harmony ain't in it and now that's too much to pass
Now that's too much to ask
Let me pick up my brass ball style and change up, c'mon
My trigger finger's uncovered my carpel tunnel was gone
It was written and rippin problems like water flowin in humbles
I'm walkin with seven shovels, the grave diggers and others
Nobody understands the man, clones now shut up
I'm quicker than a boogey wicked monster, never just like the movie
We know when to pray to God, do whatever
We get the hustle on in the spring, fall
In summer and winter months we gon' praise - Jesus!
Don't even represent us like we ain't said nothin
Present the flow then grow, know where we come from
Sun gon' shine in, equinox rhymin
Layzie perfect timin, grab my gun!
What's up to my nigga young Hova, Twista
Bun B, Pimp C, A.C. Killer
Get your money, get your paper
Elevate like my nigga DMX, here's a prayer, God bless playa

Uh, I used to rock a double XL
Now the ladies all say I dress well
With a nice pair of jeans, LRG or Evisu
Crew neck sweatshirt, hat and some clean shoes
Pockets stayed equipped with some paper and some gold piff
Pack of gum, squares, Blackberry and a phone clip (Goddamn)
Got Most dope clique, bunch of mothafuckers lookin' fresh
Crooks and castle dress, sloppy sloppy haters shouldn't mess
Walkin' by your lady and I'm sorry if I took her breath
You was just baby, cryin' 'til you end up shook to death (Bitch)
Fade away like an Etch A Sketch
Don't second guess, ain't nobody better dressed (Uh-uh)
Text hoes wearin' less clothes than her mama like
Church girl, always go to school, she the honest type (Haha)
But when it comes to boys, she like 'em bad
So holla at the kid, I got swag

And ain't no other cats lookin' like the kid
Yeah, none of y'all fuck with Mac (Ha)

Teach you how to dress real stylish, I'm the wildest

I'll give you something to talk about
Come around me fronting I'll air you out, I go off

[Verse 1]
I don't shoot shit off dog I gun it down
Walk up on niggas and run 'em down
Pull a stock out that K throw a hundred rounds
Won't stop 'til your box lowered underground
Put you in the urn, your bones will burn
The rap guerilla the wack rap ringtone killer
I'm here, to find a nigga equally realer it's rare
You can meet me in the square if you dare to come near
I have no morals, just a whole lotta piss
And a dick for you, bullets and a clip for you
This the ignorance at least it looks that way
When you witness it kill at witnesses
Bury the hatchet, matter of fact bury the casket
Kill niggas bury the ratchet
Pick it back up if I have to, I used to bump niggas
And pump niggas out for the practice
The shit starter, the shit finisher, I don't know what's harder
When they release ya or when they sentence ya
The realness, back like I promised
Ready to dig a nigga shit like a colonic, I go off
[Hook: 50 Cent]
I know it's them again from last time remember them
They can't believe we back up in the club
Because you sippin on that Henny and my bitch will get the semi
And you fuck with me I'm gon' let it off
I go off! Off in this bitch like it's legal
A nigga move around with the Eagle
I go off! We say you get it if we don't believe you
This is 50 Cent and Beanie Sigel, I go off

Big Pop, of the prop on deck
Versace or LV's on the specks
My Gucc Los light up the ground when I step
Look beat it, the kid ain't mine I contest
I suggest, you aim above neck
The vest cover the chest the pine cover the Heck-
-ler and Koch, I don't rock for the cops
Horse with the stick in the hands of the jock
Everyday gear that I wear on the block
Can you picture me rolling? (Can you see clear like Pac?)
Who shot ya!? Who want beef with Big Poppa
Feel a thousand deaths when I drop ya
I feel for you like Chaka Khan I'm the don
Make niggas talk through the wire like Kan
A trip to the morgue turn a duck to a dime
You can catch me on my shit, stuck to a grind
On a mission, tryna turn a buck outta dime
Or in the kitchen, tryna turn a fuck outta nine
Nigga listen, I earned every buck that was mine
I ain't never cry over a fuckin dime don't make me go off

First gear pop the clutch
Second gear throw it up, third gear I'm on stuck
Fourth gear I'm at Twelve O'Clock
I know I probably get it in, twelve a block
But it's price to low some I'm scared to cop
Guns a blow, and I ain't scared to pop
I know niggas upstate doin life in the box
I know niggas upstate doin life with they pops
It's the bully whether you like it or not
The chain cool but you don't look right in a watch
So give it up smooth, yeah or the rifle'll pop
We'll get you some shoes, probably look nice in the box
Flow smooth, light on my feet like Heav D
Money Earnin all day but I ain't from Mount V
Just threw a bell on the scale of the tree
I don't know make 'em two hundred every pea
Without rap I could double on a D
Shitt, make it snow in a blizzard like Jeez
You don't know a noone 'nother like Sige
You don't really wanna see me in the streets don't make me go off

She moves, she moves like a breeze
I swear I can't get her out of my dreams
To have her shining right here by my side (shining like a star)
I'd sacrifice all them tears in my eyes

Aicha, Aicha - passing me by (there she goes again)

Makes her feel like she is blessed from above
Falls asleep underneath her sweet tears
Her lullaby fades away with his fears

Aicha, Aicha - passing me by (there she goes again)
Aicha, Aicha - my, my, my

She needs somebody to lean on
Someone body, mind & soul
To take her hand, to take her world
And show her the time of her life, so true
Throw the pain away for good
No more contemplating boo
No more contemplating boo

Lord knows the way she feels
Everyday in his name she begins
To have her shining here by my side

I Believe I Can Fly,R. Kelly,['r&b'],"[Verse 1]
I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

[Refrain]
If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

[Chorus]
I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly (Woo)
[Verse 2]
See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, ho-oh

[Refrain]
If I can see it (Woo), then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

[Chorus]
I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
Oh I believe I can fly (Woo)

Hey, 'cause I believe in me

I believe I can fly (I can fly)
I believe I can fly (I can fly)
Hey, if I just spread my wings (I can fly)

New Friend Request,Gym Class Heroes,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
I remember when I first laid eyes on you
My man Tom introduced us but I was too shy to say hi
When I finally built up enough nerve to drop a line
You made it clear you wasn't just another myspace mistress
And I didn't take it personal
When you ignored my request to be your friend I spilled my guts and hit 'send'
Waited 2 weeks for a response and got nothing, honestly it made me only want you more
Week 4 rolled around and I was this close to letting go
But something wouldn't let me even though I hardly knew you
It was plain to see we were meant to lock lips
You knock me out with the brass knuckle tats on your hips
I was on this website late night lurking
When I got a message from you that was labled 'urgent'
You said you weren't impressed by lame dudes with no game
They're all the same tryin' to get your instant messenger name
But the fact that you're hittin me back made me smile
You must've saw somethin you liked when you was skimming through my profile
You caught me at the most pivotal moments
And now I'm emailing my love a dozen digital roses
[Hook]
So click approve, so simple
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose
Just click approve, you're killing me here
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose

[Verse 2]
Let's face it, it's a sad situation
When we have to resort to keyboards as a means of making relations
But I don't have the patience, I get straight to the point
So this is me at my most honest
No egos, no Gym Class status, just Travis
Love it or leave it, but you gotta admit
On a scale of 1 to awesome I'm the shit
Just get over it, it happened god damnit, I'd been waitin too long
I even wrote a song about, like to hear it, here it go
If I'm being too annoying, let me know (just let me know)
But its hard for me to not hate
When I'm on myspace I never see my face in your ""Top 8""
Approaching 6 weeks now, it's kinda obvious that you're either occupied or playing a game
All my money's on the latter, this is not a ""lol"" matter
Why would you pass up a chance this great?
If there were two forces and I split them down the middle, I could swing back
And forth for three days (rephrase)
If I had two horses, and I beat them with authority
I'd gallop all the way to Canada to see your face
But all I got is this Powerbook and ""Ichat""
Besides I hit you all the time and you never write back
I stay on my feet (shit)
And be persistent until my name is under ""who you'd like to meet""
[Hook]

Who cares if we don't know each other's last name
All I know is that I'm smittin with your pictures wishin you would feel the same
I'll admit I get a lil jealous when other dudes leave you comments
Don't let it gas you up, it's all nonsense
Make me out, romancing the thought
Of me and you speaking in tongues in this mansion I bought
But it's all wishful thinking
Just give me some kind of sign to let me know I'm not freakin you out
And if you love then what I'm speaking about, then say something
I check my inbox 10 times and there ain't nothing
You probably busy doing something sexy
I just hope I'm in your thoughts next time you log in
And if not, ain't no love lost between you and me
I'll be here when your man ain't fully down as he used to be
So yeah its time to sign out, my vision's getting blurry

Trap or Die 2 Remix,Jeezy,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Jeezy]
New paint job, get you a new blow job
28, 36, I miss my blow job
I got it here, you get it back nigga thats your problem
Sound like a snow job
And you already know niggas won't starve
And you already know niggas gon' rob
Don't make me go and change the grill, get a nose job
You know I pedicure the wheels, get a toe job
Nigga I'm still spending twenties from my old job
You niggas get up off my dick, that's a ho's job
He said he want another one I told him no prob
He just bring the quarter back like Brett Favre

[Chorus: Jeezy]
I said trappin ain't dead
This niggas just scared
Niggas just playin' they don't want no bread
Everybody in the game, say they trap like you
Well go against the grain, this is trap or die 2
[Verse 2: Jeezy]
See I'm bout to give you game nigga, no charge
Still broke after that, then that's your charge
Pulled up full of hoes, then that's my charger
Pulled over full of o's, that ain't my charger
A extra point 5 is what I could charge ya
Since you coming right back I'm thinking ""Why bother?""
One thing about that girl, she a freak though
Good when she soft, better when she cheap though
You know Jizzle put the fork, put the pole in her
Go up in the sofa, pay a toll in her
And she go hard, and she go hard
T Pain and Kanye yea she go hard
And that blow hard, just like my flow hard
Concrete shit, I'm talkin floor hard
Nigga I been hiding 8balls in the backyard
Back when Ball and JG was coming out hard

[Chorus: Jeezy]
I said trappin ain't dead
This niggas just scared
Niggas just playin' they don't want no bread
Everybody in the game, say they trap like you
Well go against the grain, this is trap or die 2

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
We flipping the shipment and whipping again
I'm through with it once, we gon' cook it again
I'm trill to the end, never snitched on a friend
Pulled up in a Benz and I fronted him 10
I'm so subconsciously, copping the coca
My lingo bi-coastal la cosa nostra
Dominican thug, Dominican plug
Be shooting up drugs like Sammmy Sosa
My philosophy, Sun Valley my property
Gucci the czar, it's not a democracy
And if you don't like me? (gun shots) stops all animosity
Black T, black gloves,in my black Saab
I took some blow from your woe, call it black rob
And how I dodged that other charge, man I guess God
The same nigga moving caine out Econo Lodge
Im on an interracial date,twins, 2 pairs
And I'm a bachelor but I'm still in love with white squares

[Chorus: Jeezy]
I said trappin ain't dead
This niggas just scared
Niggas just playin' they don't want no bread
Everybody in the game, say they trap like you
Well go against the grain, this is trap or die 2"

ILL Bill, Apathy
Brooklyn goons to Snowgoons
Demigodz, LCN
Dough rakers

Watch out where them Snowgoons go
We make the sky bleed black snow
Not after your cash, we're after your soul
We make the sky bleed black snow
Watch out where them Snowgoons go
We make the sky bleed black snow
Not after your cash, we're after your soul
We make the sky bleed black snow

[Verse 1: ILL Bill]
I'm a diamond in the rough, leave hollows in the gun
Leave large holes in your skulls, you ain't never coming home
You'll never fucking survive, I'm leaving nothing alive
Nobody's gonna escape, everybody's gonna die
Like the Angel of Death creep up with the four-fives
And chrome nines, no love lost and no smile
No mercy, no retreat, no surrender, coke and heroin
I'm the man on the street like a old school metalhead
Riding dirty, mind perverted, shooting pornos behind the iron curtain
Do more dirt than Tide detergent
Fuck peace, I'm a violent person
My mind's a distorted and fucked-up pile of wires and circuits
Uncle Howie Records, there be drugs around me forever
A foundation of terror that rise together
Buck off nines and motherfuck dimes together
We fight till the motherfucking death and die together
La Coka!
[Hook: Apathy]

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Motherfucker I'm Zeus
In a bubble goose with Timberland boots
They try to hang me with a noose, I rip the tree from its roots
You in cahoots with Lhus
Suffer if you got a den of some hating troops
I got a blender full of forbidden fruits
The force of my flows could fracture forty bottles
Got a posse of apostles and pussy from supermodels
I'm a monster in mosh pits, powerful as Pac spits
Launching rockets from Glock clips and my six
The Mossberg moss and that kill sound clash
Only fuck thick chicks with a big round ass
Outlast motherfuckers, I'll be taking out trash
Need to get up, get out, just listen to Outkast
Ap's flows smack foes, jack dough, mack hoes
Spitting rhymes, making dictators resign like Castro
And heavy ammunition is the weapons of choice
Run up on these motherfuckers like, ""Sprechen Sie Deutsch?""

Now calling all revolutionary youth
Dam Marley alongside K'naan
Gunpowder philosopher what some boy feel like...Paper!

[Verse 1]
I made the list this year
I'm honor roll, you ain't know East African rock 'n roll
You don't know what time it is like your clock is old
You ain't know we all packin' like the block is sold
How could it be from the deepest darkest of zero
To become king of New York like De Niro
And he ain't even from New York that's what's weird yo
But where he's from they just ratatatat-ratatatat
So come now don't you try to play the hero
Around here we've got pirates with torpedoes
Alongside all the warlords and beardos
The only city nigga's blacker than tuxedos
Baby girl let me get all up in your earlobe
And if you shut me down you can kill my ego
Which is my enemy makes you my amigo
So either way you and I are button and needle
And they say I might become big as a Beatle
But I don't let it get to my head or feet yo
And I got more street cred than legal
But just in case we keep a big, des-eagle
[Hook]
Yeah, I come prepared, I come prepared, I come prepared
Yeah, I come prepared, I come prepared, I come prepared, always
Yeah, I come prepared, I come prepared, I come prepared, yeah Zion youths
Yeah, I come prepared, I come prepared, I come prepared

[Verse 2]
What was I on before this flow or sequel?
Somethin' about how I thought I was a Beatle
I'm trippin' but it was something lethal
It was fresh but possessed something Medieval
I came solo I ain't even bring my army
The type of niggas that are always ruining the party
You know those socially inadequate Somalis
Who walk in uninvited and you're VIP
And Africans love them some B.I.G
But 2Pac is official H.N.I.C
And my job is to write just what I see
So a visual stenographer is what I be
Superman, superstar give me super-fat dough
So I can be super-rich and super phat so
But maybe not super fat but super stacked though
So I can fix some money shit on super bad clothes
How many immigrants are in this here sedan
And is anyone carryin' any contraband?
Not really but I'm late for my concert man
And here's a card for my lawyer Mr. Sam Goldman
[Hook]
Yeah, I come prepared, I come prepared, I come prepared [4X]

(Damian Marley)
So mek a boy know the kalashnikov nuh play type-o
If him feel him have the balance fi a walk tight rope
And a gamble with him life like a casino
And have somebody fi save him like them save Nemo
Cause the Marleys and Somalis are some mad people
We a travel with some long strap in a vehicle
And a screech across the border like a Latino
Moving through the LAX's and London Heathrow
Wait, man a gangsta we no star freak show
No gimmicks nor shenanigans a real street flow
Fi mi women haffi flyer than a Flamingo
Real bullet we a bust and a no Placebo
K'Naan have so much gun him open gun depot
And we take way boy gun just like we a gun repo
So tell some fassy MC there's no more free throw
Soon as we finish a clip another clip reload because

Star of the Show,Wiz Khalifa,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
See I've been going on and on forever
Them haters probably wonder when I'm gon' stop, never!
Most of this been good but I've seen some bad weather
And niggas who want shit now wouldn't even give me an umbrella
But I ain't tripping, I made a million on my own
May come to your surprise but I pictured it all along
When I was 16, finna get put out my home
Now the man making money, my nigga, my money grown
And I can do what I what, went from being hated on
To niggas try to go down the same road I made it on
Ain't no love lost but wasn't no love shown
So now when niggas call I just don't pick up the phone
I'm breaking down the weed, put it in the bong
Blow a hundred racks, put it in the song
Party every weekend, hardly ever home
Don't get a chance to see me face to face
So you have to talk about me when I gone

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Stay away from the fake or phoney (phoney)
Niggas who can't support their own
So keep hating me from the crowd
Everybody wants to be the star
Of the show-ow-owww (ow-owww)
The show-ow-owww (ow-owww)
The show-ow-owww (ow-owww)
The show-ow-owww (ow-owww)
[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
The drinks poured up, weed's rolled up
And all my jewelery ice aged, the piece frozed up
I only like to see the hoes who keep their nose up
Have any nigga in the world but she chose us
I remember them same hoes ain't even notice us
Get you to buy a drink then it's over cuz
We back around the time that she sober'd up
Shit ain't been the same since the limousine showed up
The best moments of my life
Never peeled this much plastic off of Polo in my life
Rarely gon' to see, smoking with ya wife
Plus anything you want I can afford to buy it twice
It's the way we know
Wake up in the morn' like ""where did all my paper go""
Grow some more weed and get medicated
Everyday is a holiday so we celebrate it

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Stay away from the fake or phoney (phoney)
Niggas who can't support their own
So keep hating me from the crowd
Everybody wants to be the star
Of the show-ow-owww (ow-owww)
The show-ow-owww (ow-owww)
The show-ow-owww (ow-owww)
The show-ow-owww (ow-owww)
[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Niggas losing their roles
Can't play their position
One day they're down for the team
Next day they're missing
Same ones was all in the front
Suppose to be there for support
And half the time it's the ones you care for
Fuck you here for? Huh?

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
You wanna be a, big shot, only number one
Everybody wanna be a superstar
Big shot, only number one
But everybody wanna be the star, though
You wanna be a, big shot, only number one
Everybody wanna be a superstar
Big shot, only number one
But everybody wanna be the star, though
You wanna be a, big shot, only number one
Everybody wanna be a superstar
Big shot, only number one
But everybody wanna be the star, though

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Uhh, the money come, the money go
And when it come down to it
That's something niggas with real money should know
We partied a lot and drank, now they don't talk to me
I started off not so great, now I'm on top of things
[Verse 5: Chevy Woods]
Yeah, yeah, uh, yeah
I guess the difference is we ain't thinking the same
So if I'm guilty of change, I guess I'm the one to blame
I see the bigger picture on the wall in a frame
Spent a couple of days OT making it rain
That was cool but I was thinking ocean views
Polo trunks shades on and boat shoes
Cantox lick the oil, my nigga and I ain't slipping
You won't stall me out, uh, bad transmission
So if for the better, yeah, nigga different
That west coast weed, my homie Wiz twisting
Mattress money put up cause now my money different
Got a lot to say but ain't never try and listen
Record all night in the studio in the morn'
Playing back what we did, now tell me if that's wrong
Crack the Rozay, and pop a top or two
And toast to what this hard work got us to"
All the Money In the World,Rick Ross,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Rick Ross]
You know gettin' money, becomin' a young millionaire
You can lose sight of the things that is important to you
I'd never trade my old girl for all the money in the world
I'd never trade my daughter Toy for all the money in the world
I'd never trade my only boy for all the money in the world
I put my last name first

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I can hear my daddy sayin' ""lil' nigga go get 'em""
Passed in '99 cancer all in his liver
Shit different since we last spoke, his son's a lil richer
I'd never rap again if I could tell him that I miss him
Why the fuck I own the world when I can't share it with him
Bust his ass his whole life, just want to break bread with him
Cryin' in my mansion as I'm holdin' on his picture
It's a cold and lonely world, I'm flyin' solo on you niggas
Bein' the only boy, definition of a man
All the money in the world still not a big enough advance
Still all the money in the world still not big enough advance
For me to turn my back on me bein' the man that I am

Turn off the lights (turn off the lights)

I gotta stay focused and remain her little soldier
Brace a few wishfuls and the streets begin the whisper
Prayin' for you niggas still stockin' up my pistols
Lil nigga gettin' murdered and buried in all-white
Eighth grade school y'all figure that's alright
Tryna figure out where I'm goin' with my life
As I'm steppin' on the brake and hangin' a sharp right
Did my thing in the streets, seen in the streets
See me at the park on the swing with my niece
Watch chipped up, still won't switch up
First time singin', so you gotta turn that bitch up

Oh man, when I close my eyes
I can see you about a million times
It's true over and over, over and over
Yeah, but then again, it kinda makes me laugh
Cause you're the one that put me on this path
I guess I gotta keep rollin' strong
I feel I can't go wrong
Cause I can hear you walkin' with me
I can hear you talkin' to me
I know you hear them sayin' ""La-la la la la la-la""

Binoculars,The Left,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Verse One

Yo, my life is complex to say the least
So I try to find release in every moment that I grace a beat
People view me as strong cause they don’t see the weakness
That’s caused by my inner demons that I battle frequent
So I’m frequent in my prayers to elude the madness
That goes on across the globe as I watch the masses
Plummet in despair
I watch people complain while other people just pray for a little rain
That seems kinda strange just when you sit and observe
And notice that society driving people berserk
Trying to mask the hurt, but it’s hard to hide the obvious
Like remote control planes hittin’ the twin towers
As I’m preparing myself to meet the final hour
I’m giving Dawah within my actions the lord’s power
Cause that fire’s a real thing
Contrary to your belief’s everybody gotta meet the King

Bridge/Chorus
Open your eyes look, through binoculars, pay attention, yeah

Verse Two

Misconception is the brute to the false perception
That often leaves loss people to the misdirection
Electing fools for leaders playing the guessing game
While the qualified leaders are locked in the cage
From Mandela to Rap Brown, the same cycle
Been going on since pharaoh knew of a coming rival
This is a survival transcended to spirit form
Between heaven and hell is where your souls torn
From Philistine to Kashmir to people suffering
While we watch from a distance and plan to do nothing
Desensitized to lies told through the airwaves
We’re quarantined from the truth like it’s a bad plague
Pray for the best, but trust me the worst is yet to come
Motivatin’ the people who lack the overcome
Cause with every success story a struggle follows
As we push for a bright future to come tomorrow

Bridge/Chorus

Truth always stand clear from falsehood, man
You ain’t never got to question it, regardless, yeah, The Left"
Vomitspit,MF DOOM,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse]
It's the beat, he hear it in his sleep sometimes
Blare it in your jeep so your peoples can stare at them rhymes
Real rhymes not your everyday hologram
Even when ribs was touchin', never swallowed the ham
He'd rather eat a sand sandwich salad
It might need salt like your man's bland ballad
A lot of stuff happens that the news won't tell you's
Blues on L juice, snooze, all hell loose
Rake it, take it like the good, the bad, the ugly
Break it, rollin' through ya hood in the caddy buggy
Butter softly, leather flossy, fatty juggy
Always threw me off when she told me, ""Daddy, funk me""
I'm like, ""Anywho's""
Seeds walkin' all out in the street without any shoes
I guess it's better than some funky socks
You need to get her some skips before she catch the monkey pox   (Hahahahaha)
Instead she wanna hear the beatbox
Take pills and make fake krills as sheetrock
Sing it, bring it, back to your laboratory
While he's in his oratory, glorious like a horror story
The mask is like Jason
They told the place not to let the basket type case in
He could be some kind of wacko
Waitin' for the chance to heat the pipes like a crack ho
He busted in, blessed be the Lord
Who believe any mess they read up on a message board
If so, I got bridges for the low low
Same bitch a-go dry snitchin' to the popo
Here, orange peel stogs for the whole tier
Feel like I've been gone over a year, came home to old gear
It was the shit when I first scooped it
At least I get to sit out in New York and curse stupid
Plead the fifth, sip wine stiffly
Patiently come up and be spiffy in a jiffy
Gift for the grind, criminal mind shifty
Swift with the nine through a fifty nine fifty
Well edumacated, he heard it when he meditated
In deep theta, let her hate the creep later
Dedicated cheap skata who keeps data
Say he stay self medicated to sleep later
Side effects is similar to sugar pill
Whoever go next on the mic he put a booger, ill
And made his exit on some calm shit
Begged him on the regular for kegs of more vomitspit

And your head is a bleeping target
You don't want me to see you with my peeking Tommys
Wizzle Fizzle, I keep it New Orleans
Sleeping with women that sleep with the Hornets, yup
A country boy in something foreign
'Bout a hundred thousand more than what you're in
You're not 'bout it, you freeze up like popsicles
Pop up on bicycles, pop y'all like spot pimples

Some people want nothin' out of life
And some people want it all
Some people ain't livin' life right
But fast money make God call
I'm prayin to the angels, but worship the devils
Yeah, a nigga rich but I'm livin' like a rebel
Ridin' with my strap on, foot on the pedal
Them silly beef raps, now they on another level, level
I grew up on a crop side, the New York Southside
Stayin' alive was no jive
Standin' on the strip you get stuck like Velcro
Jake jump out, you see heads and elbows
Run nigga, run nigga, here they come nigga
Throw that pack nigga, toss that trigger
Kid I'm still in the P's, girl I love the Audi
If yo' ass pregnant girl, leave the party
My stashbox so big, it could move the shotty
God it ain't my fault, if I shoot somebody
I ain't in it to lose, I'm in it to win
Sex, money, murder, take the safety off my sins (yeah!)

Buckle down, do anything for the dollar

Shiny trey-pound, black 9-mil
Mink Gucci leather got me shoe crazy
Quarter mil' vehicle and I'm a oops baby
And if I'm wearin my chain it's .380
Like Fat Joe, nigga you crazy?
Man fuck friends, this T-dot-O-dot-S

And shootin' by the fifty, ain't a damn thing funny

I love that money, I need that money
It gives me shelter, it's there when I'm hungry
It feeds my kids, it fills my fridge
It pays my bills and the mortgage on the crib
It keeps me icy, it make hoes like me
It gives me seats at the Garden next to Spike Lee
It made me rich, it made me change
I seen a lot of places and bought a lot of things
You got me haters, you got me drama
You paid for the lawyers, you paid for the llamas
You make niggas goners, you rule all the corners
When somebody dies, you gotta pay the mourners, mourners

King Without A Crown,Matisyahu,"['rock', 'hip hop', 'r&b', 'blues', 'jazz', 'pop']","[Verse 1]
You're all that I have and you're all that I need
Each and every day I pray to get to know you, please
I want to be close to you, yes I'm so hungry
You're like water for my soul when it gets thirsty
Without you there's no me
You're the air that I breathe
Sometimes the world is dark and I just can't see
With these, demons surround all around to bring me down to negativity
But I believe, yes I believe, I said I believe
I'll stand on my own two feet
Won't be brought down on one knee
Fight with all of my might and get these demons to flee
HaShem's rays fire blaze burn bright and I believe
HaShem's rays fire blaze burn bright and I believe
Out of darkness comes light, twilight unto the heights
Crown Heights burnin' up all through till twilight
Said thank you to my God, now I finally got it right
And I'll fight with all of my heart, and all a' my soul, and all a' my might

[Hook]
What's this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
I give myself to you from the essence of my being and I
Sing to my god, songs of love and healing
I want Moshiach now, time we start revealing
What's this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
I give myself to you from the essence of my being and I
Sing to my god, songs of love and healing
I want Moshiach now
[Verse 2]
Strippin’ away the layers and reveal your soul
Got to give yourself up and then you become whole
You're a slave to yourself and you don't even know
You want to live the fast life but your brain moves slow
If you're trying to stay high, bound to stay low
You want God but you can't deflate your ego
If you're already there then there's nowhere to go
If your cup's already full then its bound to overflow
If you're drowning in the waters and you can't stay afloat
Ask Hashem for mercy, and he'll throw you a rope
You're looking for help from God you say he couldn't be found
Searching up to the sky and looking beneath the ground
Like a King without his Crown
You keep fallin' down
You really want to live but can't get rid of your frown
Tried to reach unto the heights and wound bound down on the ground
Given up your pride and then you heard a sound
Out of night comes day and out of day comes light
Nullified to the One like sunlight in a ray
Makin' room for his love and a fire gone blaze
Makin' room for his love and a fire gone blaze

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
See I lift up my eyes where my help come from
And I seen it circling around from the mountain
Thunder!
You feel it in your chest
You keep my mind at ease and my soul at rest
You're not vexed
Look to the sky where my help come from
Seen it circling around from the mountain
Thunder!
You feel it in your chest
You keep my mind at ease and my soul at rest
You're not vexed"

My fully loaded nine will shoot through your metal door
Have ya nigga's far and out like white kids at grocery stores (Aaah!)
Battle Bizarre and it's just too deadly
Even a rapper with amnesia who met me still couldn't forget me
If I don't get all my fuckin' dough
Y'all gon' see more fights and spits than the Jerry Springer show
'Cause I'm a nasty, dirty, filthy bitch
For ten rocks even a basshead with AIDS would suck my dick
'Cause I'm quick to snatch a nigga out his Polo
I'm the reason niggas come ten deep and end up leavin' solo
(I'm by myself!) Me losin'? Y'all niggas must be buggin
We can battle for ten minutes and let your cousins be the judges
I'm the illest rapper to come out thus far
I'll shoot anybody; even the bitch who gave me CPR
Step to the Outz' and end up getting burned
Fuck around and get raped like one of Bill Clinton's interns
[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'll shove a gun in ya grill, greasy and heated
Smothered in hot mustard, so when I feed it to you it's easy to eat it (Eat this)
You need to be immediately treated
While you breathin' and you'll be leavin' the receivin' room this evenin' with Jesus
You hate on us and we'll be waitin' on eight corners
Swarmin' ya hood with a thousand angry skateboarders (C'mon)
I hop in a Jeep, slam on the gas and charge you
And bombard you in the car that your mom bought you
Fuck around and get choked and found in a moat
Floatin' around drowned, face down in a boat (Damn)
I'll pile five dudes in a Pinto and pull up
To the 7 Mile drive-through at McDonald's and pile-drive you
I got the power to snatch a motherfucker out of his car
When he rides by me at ninety miles an hour
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face
With white out, 'cause y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows

[Verse 3: Fuzz Scoota]
I'm dressed to please sucking nips
Yeah, she get it the same way that I fucked the chick
Stuck my hands in her panties like bitch suck my dick
87 freak 187 heat the passion rolls I'm passin' clothes
You like it in the ass is what I'm askin' hoes
Aren't you Fuzz he has sold more albums then the Jacksons sold
I love you baby if I'm not with you then I'm blastin' foes
Telepathically harrasing foes
I know your little sister is fourteen but her ass can grow
Ice-berg took down Titanic elastical
Given my fans the exact shit they askin' fo'
Fuzz Scooter fucking one man bout to show
You passing one blunt bitch we passing four
I rode your ass and smoked take one pull and smoke your head up
I'll send you to tell 2Pac to keep his head up
I went to the fighting really Canibus who can get up
I knew this shit was over from the fucking blood that he spit up
Ran a couple more miles should have done more sit-ups
I want his dumb ass to jump up bitch and get lit up
Call your bitch like, ""Bitch, come and pick this bitch up""
On battle you be sweeter then I get this shit up
I'll stomp you too you get up
Or stomp you to the cops come
Eighty nigga's came when your fucking block got dumb

Your mail go back like Emmitt Smith's hairline
With Jordache devils and Calvin Kleins

How would I look with Mike's complexion
Eat me, freak me, take your hand and beat me
All I wanna say is I don't really give a fuck
Cause Most he be mega
Copped the Playstation but still play the Sega
And in the PJ's I DJ and blow amps
Bad as Shrimp Scampi with the food stamps
Huh, I'm not a stranger to danger
On the streets I be known as the jaw rearranger
Heavy with the metal, Mel-Man rule
White boys say it now ""Cool, cool, cool!""
I bring the fizzy that's the obvious
I got a grip but the only clip I load be the floppy disk
In the SP or the MV, see three G

Bitches flirtin' with the giggles and chuckles
You'll never get the jizzy bare knuckle

Hold up! Back to the clinic
Uhh, aah, poked your bitch in the eye
Then I step like Omega Psi Phi (AWROOF!)
I walk the earth like Moses
Any mackadocious, I grew up with roaches
Shows, I turn out
I got dough but still call my hoes on my burnout
But can't phone long distance
I'm a rich nigga still gettin' public assistance
Rockin' shit on a task cam
Got MC's talkin' 'bout ""I love you, man""

A lil' discotheque nestled in the ghettos of Niggaville, USA
Via Atlanta, Georgia
A lil' spot where young men and young women go to experience they first little taste of the night life
Me? Well, I've never been there
Well, perhaps, once, but I was so engulfed in the Ol' E', I never made it to the door
You speak of hardcore
While the DJ sweatin' out all the problems and troubles of the day
While this fine, bow-legged girl, fine as all outdoors, lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear
Competing with ""Set It Off"" in the right
But it all blends perfectly, if you let the liquor tell it
""Hey, hey—look, baby, they playin' our song!""
And the crowd goes wild, as if Holyfield has just won the fight
But in actuality, it's only about 3 a.m., and three niggas just done got hauled off in the ambulance, sliced up
Two niggas done started busting—""Wham! Wham!""
And one nigga done took his shirt off, talking 'bout, ""Now, who else wanna fuck with Hollywood Court?""

Yes! When I first met my SpottieOttieDopalicious angel
I can remember that damn thing like yesterday
The way she moved reminded me of a brown stallion horse with skates on, you know?
Smooth, like a hot comb on nappy-ass hair
I walked up on her and was almost paralyzed
Her neck was smelling sweeter than a plate of yams with extra syrup
Eyes beaming like four karats apiece, just blindin' a nigga
Felt like I chiefed a whole O of that Presidential
My heart was beating so damn fast
Never knowing this moment would bring another life into this world
Funny how shit come together sometimes, you dig?
One moment, you frequent the booty clubs, and the next four years, you and somebody's daughter raisin' y'all own young'n
Now, that's a beautiful thang
That's if you're on top of your game and man enough to handle real-life situations, that is
Can't gamble feeding a baby on that dope money
Might not always be sufficient
But the United Parcel Service and the people at the post office didn't call you back because you had cloudy piss
So now, you back in the trap

Told y'all my battlery, and go to war happily
How you gon' call my bluff, when you scared to send a fax to me
My factulty guns drawn, one wrong move dudey
And it's too heads on ya body, into a gangster movie
For lot being real, scared to pop wit the steel
It got skeletons in my house, every closet is filled
Now how does it feel, with this Baretta to ya dome
And to know that ya mom's know, that you was never coming home

[Hook] w/ Ab-libs

You know what I'm sayin'
You want beef, we taking it to yo face

Tommy the Cat,Primus,"['alternative', 'rock', 'metal', 'r&b', 'jazz', 'blues', 'hip hop', 'pop']","[Intro: Les Claypool & Tom Waits]
Well, I remember it as though it were a meal ago
Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter may have nestled its way into his mighty throat
Many a fat alley rat had met its demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of this awesome prowling machine
Truly a wonder of nature this urban predator
Tommy the cat had many a story to tell
But it was a rare occasion such as this that he did

[Verse 1: Tom Waits]
Well, she came sliding on down the alleyway like butter drippin' off a hot biscuit
The aroma, the mean scent, was enough to arouse suspicion in even the oldest of tigers that hung around the hot spot in those days
The sight was beyond belief
Many a head snapped for double, even triple takes as this vivacious feline made her her way into the delta of the alleyway where the most virile of the young tabbies were known to hang out
They hung out in droves
Such a multitude of masculinity could only be found in one place and that was O'Malley's Alley

[Verse 2: Tom Waits]
The air was thick with catcalls, no pun intended
But not even a muscle in her neck did twitch as she sauntered straight to behind the alleyway
She knew what she wanted
She was looking for that stud bull
She was looking for that He-cat
And that was me
Tommy the Cat is my name and I say unto thee
[Chorus: Tom Waits]
Say baby, do you wanna lay down with me?
Say, baby, do you wanna lay down by my side?
Ah, baby, do you wanna lay down with me?
Say, baby
Say, baby

[Chorus: Les Claypool]
Say, baby, do you wanna lay down with me?
Say, baby, do you wanna lay down by my side?
Ah, baby, do you wanna lay down with me?
Say, baby
Say, baby
Say, baby, do you wanna lay down with me?
Say, baby, do you wanna lay down by my side?
Ah, baby, do you wanna lay down with me?

Say, baby, do you wanna lay down with me?
Say, baby, do you wanna lay down by my side?
Ah, baby, do you wanna lay down with me?

Intro Shaolin Finger Jab/Chamber Music,Wu-Tang Clan,"['hip hop', 'country', 'r&b']","[Intro: Kung Fu sample, RZA, (Method Man) & Raekwon]
I must tell you that the Clan is a danger to the public
But still for many men just to hear of the name
Fills them with hate and loathing
But why? They've never harmed anyone
I'm afraid they did
*beat drops*
In the past there's something that they would like to forgive
First, I'll tell you about their style, planned techniques
The main style
""Shaolin Finger Jab!""
Yo..
*sounds of fighting*
(Uh-huh)
We are watchin' your whole group
You been busy here
Around the clock, all we need is your orders to move
Met a lot of crosses last night
Young and old!
You been busy here
I respect that!
Yeah, (Ayo), yeah
Chamber Music fuckin' the party up-in (Yo)
Come on! You know what it is
(Thou must bust shots all the time, kid)
(Ayo, ayo, ayo) We're back!
[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Peep The Jump Off, ain't nothin' sweet, get dumped off
Frontin like you won't get deaded and bumped off
Drastic son, master guns that'll run up in plastic ones
And then go, crash in the slums
One tight army, few good men that'll rep
Invade you strongly, Prince of Wales swimmin' on feet
Props'll sell, all yellow L's, cops sleepin' on nails
Niggas get realer than real, yo
Flash the brown, last time was crowned
All navy Woolridge, Wu kicks, movin' them pounds, yo
Last on niggas, great adventures of my niggas
And Castro pictures, sendin' a rash out the kitchens
Like the wind, invite the grin, watch niggas rewrite the trend
Wu niggas did it again, yo
Unhighly, octane, die cast metal frame
Lame, let another man with heat handle beef

[Chorus: Method Man]
Chamber Music fuckin' the party up-in
Chamber Music fuckin' the party up-in

[Verse 2: GZA]
Yo, spark the intro, relevant info
Load up the keyboard, 105 tempo
Most heated battles, I've blasted MCs
Some said that the bullets flew by like angry bees
Wu entered on the level where we would wait and listen
While one flashed metal, eight calculate position
The world snapped, once we combined our rap
Drastic measures, priceless treasures on Nap'
Our swords swing, windchill Mount Aerie
Native plant standin' on the tall-grass prairie
Snares and kicks, off the project bricks
It's no act the producer played the role with drumsticks
The warning came unnoticed
It's like the shot on the dock of the bay
That slayed Otis, the Nine-Lotus
Each one adjust to his own environment
Formulate this great LP, a hundred rounds spent
Niggas bent on the fruitless search for nourishment
They long for this proper guidance, encouragement
[Chorus: Method Man]
Chamber Music fuckin' the party up-in
Chamber Music fuckin' the party up-in
Chamber Music fuckin' the party up-in
Chamber Music fuckin' the party up-in

It be the Lost Tribe, 7 days locked in the dungeon
Foamin' at the mouth, mad dog in this production
The uncontrolled substance got me spittin' up bars disgustin'
The last temptation of the son of David Ruffin
Hold my mic sideways when bustin'
On Judgement Day runnin' through Hell, yellin' and cussin'
At MC's in my circumference, y'all niggas hand-cuffin'
These hoes and ain't read them they rights or nothin'
Keep lustin', yeah and I'ma a keep hustlin'

You know me, every time you kiss that ho you blow me
You blow trial trying to walk a mile in my Sauconys

[Verse 4: Masta Killa]
We just touched down, Wu shuttle, private jet
Stepped off the plane, the world wept
Roll with the Witty Unpredictable
Talent All Natural, rock with the Beatles of hip-hop
Mathematical imperial manifestation of greatness
Make wiz's scream and shout at the top of their breath essence
Captured on tape is precious
Bless mic pure deafness, awaken from you sleep mistake
When the God bring rain, hail, snow to the earthquake

It's a fly love song

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
To the effect of nothing, effective fronting
Is what I don't allow so let me tell you something
I am a bonafide
Not too modest and not a lot of pride
Soon to have a ride and a home to reside
If my mama is sick I'm by her bedside
Used to watch the show on Channel 4 called Riptide
Wash my wears in Tide cause it's too damn cold out-tide
That's how the runnings go
If there ain't no dough then there ain't no show
So take your roly poly fat promoter (ass)
To the Chemical Bank, and get my cash
If you wanna see the people scream and laugh
You best Quest, you ask the Quest, you ask real fast
Cause I don't wanna see 'em, start bucking
Throwing chairs in the air while you be ducking
What what? Don't step to me with that
If you promoting a show make sure it ain't wack
Or else I'm leaving (""Let me tell you"")
I'm leaving (""Let me tell you"")
I'm leaving (""Let me tell you"")
Your wack show
[Interlude: Q-Tip & Phife Dawg]
Yo man what's up with that?
Yo don't sweat me
C'mon, five hundred, that was the deal
C'mon man, don't try to play me out
We don't need you, sorry!
And the Abstract rapper says

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
I want chicken and orange juice, that's what's on my rider
And my occasional potato by Ore-Ida
Don't forget my pastry make sure they're tasty
I'm not the type to be pushy or hasty
See I'm the type of bro that's reared in the ghetto
Took a few shorts before
Now the only ones I take are the ones that I wear
Ain't taking no shorts no more, now
Please act proper 'fore I call the CrimeStoppers
Don't dip on the dough, cause that's a no-no
Make sure you count your money real slow
Be alert, look alive, and act like you know
It's, the 90s, time to make moves
Not, the 80s, do away witcha womb
So what? You got a crew
I got one too, they're called the Brooklyn Zu
Don't break fool, let's be reserved and cool
We don't have to act like we in grade school
Just make sure that we're taken care of
And we'll do a fly show for ya bub, check it out

Good Night and Good Luck,Drake,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","I guess this is goodbye, Goodnight and Goodluck
I'm sitting outside man I'm right in the truck
Bags packed, pack of black and milds lighting them up
I'm looking down on these niggas while inviting them up
I'd like to know the reasoning behind subliminals
Like who told them to mention me?
I am elevated homie, you are elementary
Telling them you selling dope and never sold a Century Sam
Saying you get denied off your entry exam
You get flow and you done fo', converse in one verse
About you fraud niggas that shoot never and run first
And ask Juicy if I Stay Fly
On the cellphone, and got a ten on the other end like an eight bi
Six two and they tell me you ye' high
They can't but they try, still get offended if I don't say hi
To me it's kinda gay if I'm saying hi to like eight guys
So I just walk past and keep it cool till the hate dies
I do nothing that would offend these cats
But I wish I had a spot where I could send these cats
Like here, sit on this island man and pen these raps
Bust them shots, pretend you trap, do whatever man
Long as you never find your way home I'm cool with it
I left you a shovel there, you know what to do with it
I never bust a gun, I'm Mister C-T-V
At least, I'm not Mister Dick Riding C-T-E
Rappers believe me, I'm cuttin' records with Jody Breezy
And that nigga would even admit that you flowin' Jeezy
Slow your roll this ain't a diss song
This song, will let you know I'm not the one to pick on
White with the yellow, the over easy I'm a swiss on
Only got a couple girls that I'm willing to kiss on
With the rest I turn the charm that they cannot resist on
If they wanna smoke they get they purple goodie twist on
But I can't call it, maybe you mad cause you fellas looking celibate
Two things that you are though is jealous and irrelevant uh
And I'm official, what's officially true
Is callin' names would only be beneficial to you
I just tiring you niggas, ya'll the michelin crew
I know a response is something that you itching to do
And YOU? you're smaller to me then a thumb tack
Music enjoy it, well I'm just tryna bring the fun back
But you making out all these dumb tracks, ya LL sixteens
Cause I listen to them and I don't call it come BACK
It's more like a shame or disgrace
Considering I'm the one that you aim to displace
But you the one I blame in this case
Without you to experience much of that desired fame at this rate
Your awkward ass singles, the lamest mixtapes
And this is what's making you say you came to get Drake
And I'm thinking the hood's right for you
The sun shines on my career it's goodnight for you, uh
I'm thinking the hood's right for you
The sun shines on my career it's goodnight for you, nigga"

If I ever disappear (look), best believe I'm comin' back, stunt hard

On that same shit again (alright), all I ever do is stunt hard

I tell her, I'm getting motherfuckin' busy
So many spins my records is motherfuckin' dizzy
Haters wanna turn to their girl and be like, ""Who is he?""
But I bet a million she tell you that's motherfuckin' Drizzy
And I'm focused on my survival
Keep an eye on the door, focus on my arrival
Who do you look up to when you're better than your idol?
And how you 'posed to look when you do it with your eyes closed
I'm everything you just haven't become
I spend my time trying to outdo what hasn't been done
Now hopefully live to see what they say that I'm gon' be
And if not then I hope future does in the memory of me
Get your team in order, assembly is key
And all my niggas shut up at the mention of a plea
They rather be apprehended and keep quiet than to be
On the stand jeopardizing an inch of their loyalty
Pick a lane, pick a lane, that's all I ever heard
But I'm just trying to swerve, without hitting the curb
That's why I spend thousands on bottles so I can pop them
And take photos with hater niggas and crop them
I am not them, I photoshop them out
'Cause they don't understand what I'm about
Yeah, the Chris Paul of this fall
Sittin' this tall, I float high, goodbye, I will miss y'all

If I don't do nothin', I'mma stunt my ass off
Money sittin' in the pocket, 'bout to get a passoff
And I smoke that shit that smell like when you take your cast off
And I got them beach bitches, like David Hasselhoff
Baby I'm an acrobat. Sweetie, I'm a stuntdevil
You can't get on my level cause I am so unleveled
I'm a young rebel and I got a babyface
I need a young Pebbles, I need a stunt double
Yeah, me, Drake and Kid and you know it's trouble
We got 'em drownin' in the flow, you see 'em blowin' bubbles
Yeah, I stick my landin' in a freak drawers
I'll have her bouncin' back like Dominique Dawes
Yeah, but I ain't stuntin' these hoes
I been pimpin' since Hulk Hogan was N.W.O, yeah
I'm wild, Drizzy tough, and the Kid vicious
The three horseman, we just need Sid Vicious
Yeah, I'm on the cup of that tilt
And if you hatin' on me I'll say fuck you like wilt
Yeah! I'm a wilderbeast. You're just a wildebeest

And I go hard in my dunk like Vince Carter
I hustle harder, I live in the Carter
I think forward, all I see is tomorrow
I need meat I'll turn your shop into a horror
So if you tryin' to see more, better feed me
I'm back on my grizzy like ""Izzy"" after ""gr""
Don't he look like a black grizzly in that black fur
And the feds will never get me like a backwards password
Black spur, ghost I'm like Pacman, Casper
Vanilla Ice got 'em hangin' over the banister
Ask her, am I her man? Her answer is yessir
Shit, I'm tourin' state to state
I played the RTA 'bout a quarter a day
Now tell them bitches

Mom tried to keep her out the sexy clothes
Prom night she wore dressy clothes
Took her all night to get ready for
Retro now she want 80′s clothes
No colleges no scholarships so she put on some Navy clothes
Pregnant now its bigger clothes
Delivered now back in littler clothes
Different girl when the liquor flow
Stripper name, stripper clothes
Stripper pose on stripper poles
Then take off her stripper clothes
Right in front them gigolos
Cocaine where she stick her nose
Burnt out, turned out, bull dyke now she walk around in niggas' clothes
Turned out now she walk around in niggas clothes
Out the sad, out the bad

Who are you now?
It’s like everyday you change
Who are you now
Your style, your clothes, your name
Who are you now
So who are you now
Who are you now
Who are you now

So you spend all your time to fit in line
To fit in the crowd and even in your mirror’s eyes
Yourself you can’t identify
And just like the Energizer rabbit
You just be spinning round
And as it intensifies, your life it de-materializes

[B.o.B]
Today’s stylings, injecting like a virus
From TV screens to your iris
You buy what you are provided with
Whatever your size is
You lay it flat then iron it
And if you fight it, its like David verse Goliath
Cause that skin you supposed to hide it
Dress it up and deny it
Can't even go natural no more cause if do you probably won't get hired
So tell me who’s lying
If I am, I’m lying
On the ground but I’m flying
And they still tryna find me

No matter what you do, nothing ever goes right
If you feel like me, let me hear you say AYO

[Verse 1 - Joe Budden]
Nah, it ain't pills
So if I ain't myself as of late then it relates to another ordeal
Don’t suggest out ya mouth that maybe I’m stressed out
Or it's God tryna test Mouse
Everything about me is changing and its new to me
I’m 29 going through a new puberty
Unusually the niggas that make moves take cues from me
And sayin' that I’m acting real foolishly
Well let me just explain my state
See I’m thinking at a whole nother rate
I hungry but I’m ordering with my eyes so there’s too much on the plate
Which means I can’t digest what I just ate
Wait, I’m bearing too much, stop me if I pop me an oxy
I’m not me, will somebody stop me or copy
And tell me calm down nigga, relax
I tell em calm down let me relapse

Yo, they telling me, the change is significant
Standing in the front but can’t see what they witnessing
I’m tryna take criminals, litigants, goon type niggas and turn em into business men
Change thinking patterns, give em business sense
Make ‘em model citizens, hang me if it’s a sin
Watch the cash come, patience I’m past
I’m tryna create demand for a girl who never had none
Be more bright, you fighting me all night
We’ll if I died tomorrow I’mma make sure you be alright
Turn students in to teachers, followers to leaders
But I strain my arm the further I try to reach it
Don’t misread it, I ain't book smart but lets stay on the same page, let me be the bookmark
I know more, I can’t take no more so I show more
I kill me so you can have anything you hope for

Ay, you ever try pulling a hat trick without magic
Shit, I’m doing outta habit, it’s outta habit
Cause I’ll flair up, high temper I’ll react quick
And go and try to fist fight a nigga without a ratchet
It’s funny, we all go and ask for wealth
But won’t none of us, ask for help
Well maybe I need to get some
And I’m like fuck giving niggas a fish
Follow me and I’mma teach you how to catch one
Still they tell me I’m delusional
But there’s other niggas under this illusion too
It’s Karma catching up and misusing dudes
I can’t think straight, look at what confusion’ll do

I'm a product of Reaganomics
Neurotic, they saying I'm it
Just got up, inhaling chronic
The oddest, I'm staying honest
I'm 'bout to make it famous
So you can take that J-O-B and you can shove it up your anus
I ain't never understood how the world works
But I always understood why the girls twerk
For a baller, not a 9-to-5
Barely making it with disgust behind your eyes
So I just grip my piece, rip-off fleece
Out to take your lip off, chief with my peeps
We ruthless, if you got money induce it
Goofs get toothless, we loose off two-fifths, we useless

And people holla ""How you do that there?
Why your pants hanging low and why you grew that hair?""
Lighting a bleeze with my people riding a Regal
Always in trouble with coppers 'cause we drivin' illegal

Aw nigga don't trip, I'll kill you if you fuck with my grip
I won't hesitate to let off a clip
Aw nigga don't trip, you gon' make me get on some shit
Run up on you quick, wet up your whip
Aw nigga don't trip, you gon' get your monkey-ass hit
Runnin your lip, tryin to fuck with my clique
Aw nigga don't trip, in case you didn't know who this is
It's 50 Cent bitch, G-Unit
Aw nigga don't trip

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I come through your hood, stunting in my yellow Lam'
Murcielago, top down, nigga damn
I'm the biggest crook from New York since Son of Sam
Cruising, bumping Buck's shit, Ruger in my hand
Thinking the East ain't enough, it's time to expand
I plan to head out West and plant my feet down
A nigga big as King Kong in the street now
I do a little house shopping, and buy me a crib
It's palm trees and pretty bitches out in Cali kid
I touch the Hollywood paper, go and shoot me some flicks
Have some supermodel bitches come and suck on some dick
Mama'd turn in her grave if I married a white chick
But Becky'll suck the chrome off a Chevy and shit
Niggas be wearing fake shines, I'm rocking a lil' charm
30 carats on the pinky, kiss the ring on the Don
Crack open that Cali bud, stuff the weed in the palm
[Hook: 50 Cent]
Nigga you hustle, but me I'll hustle harder
I got what you need; them trees, that hard, that powder
My niggas move G-packs, every hour on the hour
They shoot when I say shoot, so I'm in a position of power
You fuck around if you wanna

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Where I'm from you learn to blend in or get touched
I don't need niggas for support, I don't walk with a crutch
Niggas know my steez, they don't fuck with me son
You got a appetite for hollow-tips, I feed you my gun
This is that Ferrari F-50 shit, it's real laid back
Type shit you recline to in the Maybachs
I got two shooters now on the run from the fuzz
You get the same shit for ten bodies you get from one cuz
I live life in the fast lane; hundred miles an hour
Chrome and some wood grain
You know a nigga still really tryin to move 'caine
Make a little extra money on the side mayne, I ain't playing
I'm up early with the birds, word, putting that work in
Pirellis on the Porsche chirping, I'm making moves
I got a hundred mil from music, a hundred grand from crack
Gonna see my jeweler so I can blow a stack

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Nigga you hustle, but me I'll hustle harder
I got what you need; them trees, that hard, that powder
My niggas move G-packs, every hour on the hour
They shoot when I say shoot, so I'm in a position of power
You fuck around if you wanna"
Jackie Boy,Omar LinX,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Omar LinX]
Oh if these walls could talk, I would talk right back
I would talk, I would talk 'til they fade to black
The Jack Daniels don't soothe me no more
Oh Jackie Boy, Jackie Boy, show me the door
Show me peace, show me grief, show me what it means
To live a life so sunk it's not worthy to breathe
It's too early to see, it's too late to retreat
So the ship sails on to its perfect defeat
And I try to stay aboard
But when it rains, it pours
I drink a bottle of the captains 'til I wash up on shore
Don't tell me how to live this life, I live this hell
I doubt the devil had an army until the angels fell

Now wake up
I’ll seek you out
Flay you alive
One more word and you won’t survive
And I’m not scared of your stolen power
I see right through you any hour
[Verse 2: Omar LinX]
In such a place you either breathe or you suffocate
It's such a waste, don't you see what you've done to me, got
Holes in my heart like the holes in my liver
It seems the less she take is the more I give her
So, never the winner, forever the stranger
You hate me for what I was
Forget the good I do
A strange place where I keep my feelings
Call it Fort Knox with a see through ceiling
Cause where I stand I don't see the path, I see the past
I see the problems that await but I don't seem to act
So nothing's learned, no triumphant return
I never put out the fire, I just watch it all burn, thinking…

Felling any foe with my gaze
Steadily emerging with grace

[Verse 3: Omar LinX]
It's time to say goodbye
There ain't no more hellos
I set it all on fire
That's how the story goes
Turn the page, let it fade, watch it decay
See the flame, let it rain, watch it be tamed
I see the bandage, I know that you know you damaged
I pray that you feel what I feel
And only hope that you panic
The message is in the bottle
The current will help deliver
There is no return to sender
Like everything that I give her
I can fill the flask up
But can't get past us
I'm in the storm, stayin' strong, but can't get back up
A sudden change, the wind, will spin his game we're in
But when there's nothing to hold, you'd rather sink then swim
Sing it
Eyes on fire
Your spine is ablaze
Felling any foe with my gaze
And just in time
In the right place
Steadily emerging with grace"
Genabis,Canibus,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Canibus]
Genabis
This is Genabis, remember this

[Verse 1: Canibus]
In the beginning, I discovered wordplay
I experimented with some syllables from the first to the third day
On the fourth, I searched for the words to say
How to compress complex verbiage in the least amount of space
I was perfect at it and mastered the tactics
On the fifth day I decided I would combine it with mathematics
On the sixth day I became a fanatic and I couldn't kick the habit
I would just look in the mirror and practice
On the seventh cycle, I had to take the day off
I was exhausted, I guessed my work will never pay off
But if it happened it to Him, it could happen to me
And if it happened to me, it was destined to be

[Chorus: Canibus]
Yo, Genabis, Exobus, Levitibus
There ain't a mic on this planet I'm restricted to touch
I read the cosmos, what God wrote predicted as much
The inhabitants lack faith but resistance is tough
Genabis, Exobus, Levitibus
There ain't a mic on this planet I'm restricted to touch
I read the cosmos, what God wrote predicted as much
The inhabitants lack faith but resistance is tough
[Verse 2: Canibus]
They backslide back to church and call a minister's bluff
They rather remain unenlightened then listen to Bus
I blew the fuck up, even though it was short and abrupt
I was the first rapper to ever to close orbit the Sun
One small step for man, one huge step for mankind
I am the red giant of rhymes
Solar deflectors incinerate you whole in one second
Flow is untested, those that I've threatened fold under pressure
At 120 beta cycles, high volts ignite your eyeballs
Until you see the fire in front of you
Optic cone's rods, melt one at a time till you realize you in Hell
Rip the Jacker's not done with you
I terrorize the rap community with impunity
Blow you to pieces and move elusively through the debris
What my enemies want to do to me is old news to me
Those in pursuit of me will never get through to me

[Chorus: Canibus]
Yo, Genabis, Exobus, Levitibus
There ain't a mic on this planet I'm restricted to touch
I read the cosmos, what God wrote predicted as much
The inhabitants lack faith but resistance is tough
Genabis, Exobus, Levitibus
There ain't a mic on this planet I'm restricted to touch
I read the cosmos, what God wrote predicted as much
The inhabitants lack faith but resistance is tough
[Verse 3: Canibus]
First rapper to speak over beats dogmatically
Mixed with Elizabethan drama and tragedy
My motto is to dress casually and live lavishly
Look at the Victorian tapestry in back of me
Notice the post renaissance pictures I drew
Hand sketched drawings of the deserts in Nazca Peru
The followable audio propagates the possible truth
For proof I'm the illest so the choice is not unto you
See the standard ideological definition of a rap model
Puts Canibus in scholarly periodicals
The article is substantially impressive, more than a message
A working thesis from several different perspectives
The Rosetta stone of sentences for rap music's tentative
Entered apprentices, this is Genabis
The Rosetta stone of sentences for rap music's tentative
Entered apprentices, this is Genabis

[Chorus: Canibus]
Yo, Genabis, Exobus, Levitibus

I topped 'In the Club', I'm still sipping the bub
The drama, I'm with it, I get biz, you get it
I breezed on that shiddit, I split your widdig
That's why a nigga's bidded, I can't forget it
I said I didn't do it, witnesses said I did it
I'm fresh out on bail, my Benz is all kitted
Five TV's, my rims is so sidick
I cruise through, your bitch just fell in love with it
Baby, come in, girl, I want to give it to you
Once I'm in, it's on, I'm a freak with it
Money comes quidick, hot shit, I spit it

Cam buying condos, I'm buying the whole building
I'm pissing on grown women, R Kelly do it to children
You bet against me, boy, I'mma hurt your feelings
Because over and over, I'mma keep on winning
My Rolls Royce's tinted, your Phantom's rented
That's why we never ever ever see you with it

When 50 in the club, shit just goes out of control
You can blame it on Em, or blame it on Dre, okay?

Can’t call, new phone, but I’m still on that same shit
Bossin' 'cause I came into this game without a boss
Um, and I’m eatin' good so I just gotta floss

And I'm out here tryna stack cheese, right here in these haters' face
They all tried to murder me but that's how the world be

Snapback hat and a throwback, ask Greg Street, he know that

I signed myself, you can find me with that muscle behind me
I'm grindin', my AR-15 same color as my timepiece

F64,Devlin,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Yeah yeah
They want 64 bars, I want 64 whips and yards
And I don’t care who they think that they are
Cause I will laugh at your staff as I carve them in half
I’m positive like H.I.V
I’ll bury emcees on SB.TV
So deep that they'll only have the reaper to meet
Say hello to the demons for me
And don’t think cause I’ve just been signed that I still ain't the most venomous grime emcee
I catalysed half of the scene into making songs with the hearts on their sleeve
So tell your whole team that I’m iller
You can’t see me like an evening with Cilla
That’s why I find them hard to believe
When they're talking greased like they're larger than me
If you ain't heard of me, thats perjury
None of them men couldn't verbally murder me
I’ll break in my doctors surgery
Ransack the drugs and then get arrested for burglary
It’s quite sick, cause only 6 years ago, none of them cunts had ever heard of me
I’m like a cigarette I’ll hurt you internally
But they can’t put me down, they keep burnin’ me
So fuck anyone hatin’ on me
I’m great in the scene and that’s blatant to see
I’ll kill you off like an ancient disease
My name spread like the great plague of the streets
You can’t turn the tables on me
There ain't an MC I'm unable to beat
So take my advice and wisely retreat
Devlin the biggest emcee this side of the sea
Minute and a half, I’ll bury anybody with the lyrics in my bars
Ripping you in half because I’m lyrically advanced
If you look up in the sky I’ll be sitting on the stars
I’m walking down the road to Zion, like Damien Marley and Nas
All your staff will get scarred if we ever cross paths
It ain't long like giraffes
You will be laying on your arse and asking where the fuck you are
I’m the captain, you can’t take charge of my craft
You’re in deep with Jim if you can’t swim
I won’t even throw you a raft
Scream SOS I’ll just laugh ’cause I’m back with a bang, like a bomb in Iraq
With a crash and a flash and a spark
I’ll creep in the night like a thief in the dark
So anybody reckoning they're levelling with Devlin
Will get left fucked like their features are feminine
‘Cause you can’t keep up with the pace and the rate that I keep on developing
So investigate like Kojak, and you'll know that
I injected the whole grime scene with a shot of adrenaline
Now watch me resurrect grime from the dead again
‘Cause whether you like me is irrelevant
You can’t deny talent when it's evident
I’m off the scales of an inadequate measurement
Most of these men have got a vocal impediment
My names Devs, I’m a local degenerate
So I drink and I smoke for the hell of it
Play the beat and I’ll carry on deadin' it
This is war that's 64 from Devlin!"

For the verses, for the hoes

Telling them Kells' the hardest that they come
Gave the real what they want and I did that
So come and blow a blunt with your boy give it here let me split that
And I bet they won't forget that

Forgot how they used to be before the deal

Stomped until reposed and paramedics couldn't find a pulse

Rather chase they beer, instead of chase careers
Spit what I feel til every hair in my beard's covered in tears

Felt more worthless than being deaf with ears
Blastin' Primal Fear, drinkin' Belvedere
Bitch, I smile at parties but I am rarely there
Is it me or should I permanently wear confetti gear?
Make you warm inside, you ain’t see the warning signs?
I can treat these whores like slime, and they would even form a line
And that shit is fortified, until I treat em sorta kind
Cause to them the biggest crime is just tryin' to explore they mind
I hate you and I love to, make me wanna cut you
Punch you in the stomach 'till your period is punctual
Shoulda kept [?], only a couple months due
And you all up in the club to find another fuck to fund you
Silly ass bitches, wimpy ass niggas
Hit the gas until you split the dash of a pretty ass pickup
I hate people cause y’all treat each other poor
I think I'll like you better in a morgue

One of Four Thank You,Aesop Rock,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
One of four
My name is Ian Mathias Bavitz. I was born in 1-9-7-6, at Syosset hospital, located in Long Island, NY. I am 6 foot 4, I weigh 2-0-0 pounds. I have brown hair and green eyes. I enjoy writing songs, painting, movies and diner food. I have two brothers; Chris and Graham, and two parents; Paul and Anita. In august of 2-0-0-1 I went crazy. This was originally not for public consumption. This was made for four people—four people that literally saved my life. They know who they are—and, uh—I mean, I could live to be a thousand years old and never re-pay them. I don't think this song would pay for them. But hopefully by putting it out, push the bank a little further

[Verse]
This ain't a burner for the whips (no it isn't)
This ain't even Aesop Rock fly earthworm demeanor (no it isn't)
My name is Ian Mathias Bavitz and I was born in Long Island, New York
Seventy Six, before Graham and after Chris... OK
In August of 2001 my seemingly splinter-proof brain bone scaffolding imploded
I kept it on the hush, but nearly tumbling
To the cold hard concrete on mere bodega trips
For cigarettes and soda, shook me to casper
Dizzy with a nausea chaser, motor sensory eraser
Gorophobe tunnel vision, guilt, self loathing arrangement
Rose rapidly out a bog I'd never fished in
That abates three separate foreign meds
While I seems to hook lines and syncro simple fishing
Simple primitive self taught, easing of soul, mind and body
But the symptoms rejected my cave-man modus operandi
So now it's one fish belly up, through medicated mileage
Shrinks that get 250 an hour for awkward silence
And, I'd be lying if I said all of this
Made even the slightest fragment of sense to me
That's frail... Simply put
I don't know what happened, or what's still happening
I literally feel like I'm teetering on the blunt edge of my sanity
JAIME, I killed the robots and I'm sorry
Broke down in front of you, embarrassed
But you lent a heart and hand that only you could
You're one of my best friends and yes I'd take that bullet for you
That's my word, which is about all I have left
TONY, I know you know I'm crazy, cause you told me
But that didn't ever bother you, I hold you as my brother 'til death
And I got your back if ever the drunk goblin step
For makin' a cat laugh when I was walking with the dead
KATHRYN, mother figure, older sister, concerned beyond limits
Letting me know I wasn't the only one with this
Continuous offers for vacation, Chicago visits
Talked me through repair of a head full of broken pistons
RAIA, for the late night movie rentals and the company I needed
An' you knew it, but I just wouldn't admit it
You listened to me blab about my issues for hours
Offer incredible advice, gave me a hug when I was finished
Am I a jack of all trades? No... I like to write songs though
Are they good? I dunno...
But I could tell you that I only write shit down when I believe it
So take this how you want, but know I mean it
I want you all to know that I'm scared
Now my fuckin' crooked soul never faced a monster like the last few months
Ever in my whole life... I wish I could explain this better (I can't)
But the pieces won't formulate it to anything even close to cohesive
So I guess this is my feeble way to thank you
Four soldiers that extended something sacred off the purity of kindness
I owe you all my life and please don't argue with that statement
'Cause without y'all, I may not have a life to offer, take it
[Chorus]
Thank you
I wish I could explain this better (Thank you)
I'm sorry for burdening your pleasures (Thank you)
I love you all with all that's left of me (Thank you)
For helping try to kill what made a mess of me (Thank you)
Somehow, someway (Thank you)
I'mma get you back someday (Thank you)
Just gotta figure this all out (Thank you) So;

[Interlude]
I guess it is kind of funny when you look at it from a step back. How one man can literally buckle under the same pressures other men operate normally under. I have scoped this out from all angles, multiple times. I have been over everything in my head, till I can't think anymore. But I guess some times, when you can't breathe, there are people there to breathe for you. I am lucky enough to have those people around me. Thank you for helping me to not die. Thank you for helping me to not die

[Outro]
Pocket full of pennies, and a soul gone tilt
Cockpit full of memories and a drain full of guilt
Pocket full of pennies, and a soul gone tilt
Cockpit full of memories and a drain full of guilt

Pocket full of pennies, and a soul gone tilt

Dear diary, it's been just like a dream
Woke up too late, wasn't where I should've been
For goodness sake, what's happening to me

My Wendy starting to look like Fendis
My swagger's past Benjies but I'm so friendly
""Hodgy what you on the internet looking at Bentleys?""
Sawed-off to go unlawful and the niggas wanna tempt me
The bitches work for me, she's my chef
She give me breakfast, then brush my teeth, Crest
I put all of my eggs in one basket, less with finesse
Now I'm the best, Hodgy Beats on this Johnny Quest
Put your ass to the test if you fucking make a mess

This is my recital on the roof with the rifle
Pull the trigger once, bullet sprays in the fuckin' spiral
I'm sick bitch, awfully viral, yeah

I'm [?] the game
Not what you lose but what you gain, understand
Turn down the bass in my vocals and crank up the gain
I like my shit gritty, crackhouse with acid titties

I don't care about a diss, muthafucka make a hit
Nigga fuckin' here, [?] watch 'em crank up the volume
I'm bolder than my Blackberry, pop white and black

Into the paper, like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines
I escape, when I finish the rhyme

[Verse 1]
My pop said he was in love when he made me
Thought about it for a second wasn't hard to see
I could hear he was sincere, wasn't game or promotion
The entire affair's probably charged with emotion
When love call your heart I guess you got to pursue
12-11-73, my life is testament
Praise the beneficent, element that breath
Devoid in the form that make love manifest
I spent my early years in Roosevelt Projects
It was a bright valley with some dark prospects
In '83, Vendy C was the host with the most
I listened to the Rap Attack and held the radio close
I listened to the Rap Attack and held the radio close
This is far before the days of high glamour and pose
Aiyo, power from the streetlight made the place dark
I know a few understand what I'm talking about
It was love for the thing that made me wanna stay out
It was love for the thing that made me stay in the house
Spending time, writing rhymes
Trying to find words that describe the vibe
That's inside the space
When you close your eyes and screw your face
Is this the pain of too much tenderness
To make me nod my head in reverence?
Should I visit this place in remembrance?
Or build landmarks here as evidence?
Nighttime, spirit shook my temperament
To write rhymes that portray this sentiment
We live the now for the promise of the infinite
We live the now for the promise of the infinite
And we believe in the promise
(love x10)
Yes yes y'all, and we don't stop because...

My folks said they was in love when they made me

Speech align with the rhythm (right), designed with the rhythm
Ears and eyes keep in good time with the rhythm
I shine with the rhythm, the Black Star Galactica
You're big number fatin', we ancient like the abacus
After us, I see most proceed to be trees
Sprouting leaves, givin' breeze to the we who believe
I M.C., which means I Must Cultivate the Earth
Straight back, straight facts, heartbeats and hard work
I be the ""Funky Drummer"" to soften the hard Earth
(Amin) Pray Allah keep my soul and heart clean
(Amin) Pray the same thing again for all my team
From Restoration to Fort Greene, and on out to Queens
Uptown To Booggie-down, yo just look around
Shook up the world like Ali in 6-3 (right)
I'm reaching a height that you said cannot be
I'm bringing a light which you said we can't see
Saw the new day comin', it look just like me
Sun bursts through the clouds, my photo ID
I bring light to your day and raise your degree
The universal magnetic, you must respect it
From end to beginning: bright, true and living
Ever changing but sustaining magnificent

Building the now for the promise of the infinite

Help,NvizoN,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","And I firmly believe that not a thing will come to me freely
I lay back, watch some TV, relax, and then take it easy
Buried deeply beneath the struggle, release it on a cd
Wipe the old slate cleanly, believe it that you can't see me
When I put the shades on and cover my head up in a beanie
Feel forced to be dirty like the opposite of Greenpeace
I mean, I can never escape who I was in the past
Fading fast, hoping that the new me is the one that lasts
Transparent enough that I seem to be made of glass
Seemingly OK with the way that I shrug it off and laugh
When really I'm struggling for a simple hold or a grasp
So I rap, and pray to God that I'll make it back
To my roots to record another track that holds my soul
Every accent in my flow shows another boy trying to be grown
Trying to grow up, and trying to grow old
Trying to know what I will do until my times up
Maybe I won't be doing this, and that's fine but
I want my own control and I want to feel whole
And I want to not worry about how I'm gonna roll
Because possessions are not the goal so I want a piece of mind
18 years of age, taking stage, still looking for what I'll find
I've learned that I'll never be what you want me to be
But I can be everything I want to be, and that's why I dream
Nothing is stopping me but my own doubts and inhibitions
Reminiscing over all the times that I should've listened
But I didn't because I was too hard headed to take given
Advice so I might last until the sunlight or to another time
Where I can grip the mic tight and make life right and fine
Tell me, if I left tonight would you remember my memory
Or would it fade instantly into oblivion like chivalry
Come with me, because I can't walk alone, a home isn't a home
When the provider can't provide on their own
It's time for me to become a man ahead of schedule
Need to learn to take a pull when pushing doesn't work at all
Like a door with the handle broken off I'm not easy to access
Lost in my mind and I haven't made it back yet
I'll only catch glimpses of life in this world
And at best, I'll cry out for help but I can't believe in myself
With every new dawn breaking, I glimpse a bit of the hand that's dealt
To me, and I have the dead man's hand, too dark to see
If my solution was a stones throw away, I'd still miss it
Because I overlook simple details that get called dismissive

It hurts me
It hurts my soul
It hurts my heart
It hurts my soul
It hurts my heart

It hurts my soul
And It's tearing me apart

It hurts my soul
It hurts my heart'"

Made up my mind while ya'll made up yo beds
On a cold wooden floor is where I lay my head
Born in 1975
Never thought I'd make it this far
Still battlin' in this racial war
Tryin' to find solutions to the situation I'm facin'
Only thing that's free is my flow that yall be chasin'
Lettin' my niggas know before I go
I drop that knowledge like dropping books
Let's stop the crooks from robbing of your brains and such
Using welfare as a crutch
I'm in it for good
You enter my hood you won't be findin' much
Hope that when I'm gone ya'll remember this
What we stood for, fuck that fame and that glitz
It's beginning to look a lot like the ending
Got to be more careful, know what corners you be bendin'

What could I possibly have done?  You really want me to steer child populace back on beaten path?
Oh god, like teachin morals!
I can't be a part of something I ain't soaking my feet in, man
I'm from the dungeon So from here on out it's hark the herald nothing
Listen, I quit.  That's it
But for the life of me, one thing has plagued my being from the get-go
Why place these most blessed and sacred honors upon an alley cat like this
I just don't get it
Oh... my god, it just dawned on me... wait a second, oh... god...
[2x]
You have been a witness
You have seen the days when
I applied lies in a billion different ways, and now I harbor bad karma
Doomed to cope with the fact I dodged the ring but gotta show these cats the ropes


Bad karma
Please leave these little wings to erode
Please leave this little halo to a child with a lighter load
I'mma hold this tight like a life lesson told through a mic"
My Bitch 50 Cent Jay-Z and Suge Knight Diss,The Game,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: To 50 Cent]
Let me tell you a story about this bitch I know
Grew up on the south side sucking dicks for dough
Give her a half a dollar, she'll put on a show
Do anything to be in a Dr. Dre video
The bitch went Hollywood
One trip to the West Coast
She got fucked by this white bitch had her legs wide open
As long as my pockets were fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
My pretty young thing keep my nuts drained
But all the time she was plotting on my Aftermath chain
Bitch couldn't stay in her lane
Started running with this ho from the south
Gold grill in her mouth
She put her on the track
Gave her her first thong
Introduced her to her two girlfriends from back home
Fucked the industry, tryna take the fast route
Ran into a gangster and he turned they ass out
[Refrain]

[Verse 2: To Jay-Z]
From the projects hustled all day
Niggas called her Sophie from around the way
Used to play hard to get so they thought she was gay
Bougie bitch who ever thought she was raised in B.K
Moved out the hood
Changed her name to Jay
Told everybody she'll be working with a mill one day
I was introduced to her back in 96
She had a wavey haircut and some big ass lips
At first she was hard to hit
Come to find out the last ten years she been sucking Big dick
Got a family now
A house made of bricks
Four grown ass kids and ain't none of them shit
She still my bitch so I stayed around
But she always tryna dash when other dame's around
She tryna play The Game but I got the bitch number
She said she won't but she'll be back next summer

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: To Suge Knight]
Last but not least my gangsta bitch
From Compton always in and out of jail and shit
Bitch tried to burn Snoop
Stole Chronic from Doc
Blew the whole West Coast, even tried to fuck Pac
Type of bitch to stand on Beverley Hills
Word on the street she got a few real niggas killed
I look up now she on my dick
Telling me how she always gonna be my bitch
Pop up at award shows always following me
Bitch doing dumb shit, got a college degree
No pre-nupt, one nigga got stick with her
I was smart knew always not to fuck with her
What goes around comes around, scandolous shit
Somebody tried to kill that bitch
Burned the bridges and ain't had one friend left
Niggas that know her called her the devil in that red dress"

Ay, ay nigga ain't you Tech N9ne nigga?
Yeah, what's up man?
Ay, that new shit cool
That shit hot [?]
Real life bro that shit hot

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Back up wait a minute, why you lookin' at me like that?
Do you really wanna trip or you flippin' the script?
Do you wanna rap with a nigga or we bangin' suwoop in the whip?
I don't ever want us to come to bussin' off shots
Nigga misery can't produce enough cops
And I don't know if you wildin' or what
All you wanna do is freestyle in the cut
Fan or foe, (foe) I don't really know, (know)
Off at the show, (show) niggas they know, (know)
What it looked like was a good night
Now it's lookin' like a motherfucker wanna jack all me dough
Come up to me; my kids and me chillin'
Better think twice I'm a 56 Villian
But they wanna talk about a ditty, when I did it
Man, I thought I was about to get a bullet in a minute
You should be careful how you walk up on us
Got a bonus for all opponents if they want it
I know they wait for Tecca Nina moments
Fan or foe they be poppin' up and hit you, don't it?
We don't know if they be trippin' or not
Probably 'cause all of us live on the block
When you rappin' niggas want what you got
Tough as ever when you up on the top
Show some respect when you approach me
Don't you be muggin' me
Might have that drug in me
Pluggin' a nigga for merely shruggin' me
Ain't nothin' wrong with people peepin'
Geekin' whether man or ho
But a grammar so bamber stammer
I don't know if you fan or foe!
[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
If he trippin' we can go
Peepin' like he seekin' dough
Wanna throw or wanna flow

[Verse 2: T-Nutty]
Now be easy how you speakin', bro
T-Nutty the young floheakin' though, don't be jokin'
Show your ass and you'll be walkin' off with it broken
Run up on motherfuckers in the open
Makin' them shut up wolfin' with that ho shit
Cut the shenanigans, nigga you fakers are mannequins
Thinkin' you slicker than lotion?
Back up wait a minute, why you lookin' at me like that?
I'm just a nigga with a little bit of fame
But if you get to trippin', then I'ma givin' 'em my gang
Never catch me slippin', you can get it out your brain
Mayne, fan or foe
Sucker nigga tryna get his hands on my dough
But if you really want it come on and try to get on it
You can be the opponent chokin' with hands on your throat
Man, I'm a loc, one to pack round from Sactown
Better watch out for the blow-blow
Blackout, blackout, blackout, blackout, brrah
Stay with my killers that be knockin' noodles
Wakin' the game up like a cock-a-doodle
Think you gon' catch me slippin' at a show
Nutt factors lookin' like they Shaka Zulu, I see through you
With all the fake shit, you filled with hatred
Hopin' and wishin' you was my replacement
Comin' so vicious, you gon' have to face it and try to taste it
'Cause I laced it like a tennis shoe when I been a fool
Like C-Bo, Lynch and X-Raided but this is a different interview
Factors up nigga

It may not be a bad idea if I never go home again
'Cause niggas lookin' at me like I'm a chicken dinner
Lookin' back at niggas like I'm Shauntay Henderson
Are you a foe (foe) so I gotta carry the fo', (fo')
I think they recognize me, I don't really know though
'Cause they walkin' up fast and givin' me doubt
And when they pass me askin'
""When yo new shit come out?""
Me and my dawgs at the picture house
And they be huddled up and got me thinkin' pick one out
I pick the nigga bigger than me, pull the trigga to see
If he tough enough, make 'em what he tryin' to be
But he a fan though, don't know how to approach ya, vulture
Get to close how I posed ta
Posed to know the difference from fan or foe when you muggin' though
Can't even live in peace and when I eat with my peeps in the place
You in my face with yo mixtapes
And if I ain't tryin' to listen to it we get into it
If I'm off of that fluid then it's time to do it
'Cause a nigga from out south out the mouth
Yo girl be lovin' me, givin' me mouth to mouth
And it ain't fair that the music got her doin'
What she wanna do when you ain't there
And you too salty softy
When you see me out you betta get up off me
If ya girl actin' a ho I'll turn a fan to foe

So baby keep moving your, moving your, moving your thing
And that'll keep you in the, you in the, you in the ring (or maybe not)

Ay, girl – you make – me want to know

You do it like a pro, lil' lady
If so bring it here, let it show, lil' lady, there it go

Hands Held High,Linkin Park,"['hip hop', 'rock', 'alternative', 'r&b', 'metal']","[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Turn my mic up louder, I got to say something
Lightweights step it aside when we come in
Feel it in your chest, the syllables get pumping
People on the street, they panic and start running
Words on loose-leaf sheet complete coming
I jump in my mind and summon the rhyme I'm dumping
Healing the blind, I promise to let the sun in
Sick of the dark ways we march to the drumming
Jump when they tell us that they wanna see jumping
Fuck that, I wanna see some fists pumping
Risk something, take back what's yours
Say something that you know they might attack you for
'Cause I'm sick of being treated like I have before
Like it's stupid standing for what I'm standing for
Like this war's really just a different brand of war
Like it doesn't cater to rich and abandon poor
Like they understand you in the back of the jet
When you can't put gas in your tank
These fuckers are laughing their way to the bank and cashing the check
Asking you to have compassion and have some respect
For a leader so nervous in an obvious way
Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world watching at the end of the day
In the living room laughing, like, ""What did he say?""
[Refrain]
Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
In my living room watching, but I am not laughing
'Cause when it gets tense, I know what might happen
The world is cold, the bold men take action
Have to react or get blown into fractions
Ten years old, something to see
Another kid my age drugged under a Jeep
Taken and bound and found later under a tree
I wonder if he had thought the next one could be me
Do you see the soldiers that are out, today?
They brush the dust from bulletproof vests away
It's ironic, at times like this you'd pray
But a bomb blew the mosque up, yesterday
There's bombs on the buses, bikes, roads
Inside your market, your shops, your clothes
My dad, he's got a lot of fear, I know
But enough pride inside not to let that show
My brother had a book he would hold with pride
A little red cover with a broken spine
On the back, he hand-wrote a quote inside
""When the rich wage war it's the poor who die""
Meanwhile, the leader just talks away
Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay
The rest of the world watching, at the end of the day
Both scared and angry, like, ""What did he say?""

Amen
Amen

With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen)
As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen)
With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen)
As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen)
With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen)
As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen)
With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen)
As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen)
With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen)
As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen)

Da Payback,Mia X,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
I came here tonight to settle the score
Females are women and girls, not bitches and hoes
To all the niggas that's stunting off the weak-ass rhymes
It's payback time

[Verse 1]
So what up, get up, boot up, c'mon
What up, get up, boot up, c'mon
What up, get up
Lick up, suck up, get up, pay up
Get up, what up, what up, what up

Niggas all around that's dissing the women
I came to get you straight cause I mean it yes to win it
I tried to let you slide, but now I'm getting pissed
Mia X is in effect so don't be starting no shit
Now, ""Suck a nigga dick for an outfit""?
And, ""Suck a nigga dick for some K-Swiss""?
Well, eat a lady's pussy for a home-cooked meal
And blow the ass for a 40, bitch
Lying on your dick non-stop
That's something that a woman just crams to understand
You ain't seen no guts, don't get no guts
The closest thing to some pussy is your hand
""Biggity-bounce, baby, bounce""? Bitch, I ain't no ball
You get excited if I ride it, but your dick too small
Doing damage to my backbone? Please!
You're barely tickling the walls -- bitch, you're just a tease
And make my pussy scream for a six-inch dick?
I'm pushing eight-pound babies, so you talking shit
Ride that dick with a boot in my mouth?
You get the gat for the cat cause I wear your ass out
Leave your mind without a clue, thoughts without a trace
Just waiting for a turn for the pussy in your face
You said the pussy wasn't nothing but meat on the bone
Til you took a little stroll in a comfort zone
Nigga, stop talking that shit
You can't wear a pussy out with that weak-ass dick
I say nigga, stop talking that shit
You can't wear a pussy out with that weak-ass dick
Now why your dick so small?
Cause your nuts look like chiny balls, bitch
Now why your dick so small?
Cause your nuts look like chiny balls
Well, I didn't get no nut, nigga
So you can't get your fucking hair cut, nigga
I say, I didn't get no nut
So you can't get your fucking hair cut

[Verse 2]
I met this nigga, his name was Duke
The bitch tried to take me to the Rochambeau
I said, ""Cheap motherfucker, better come again
And let's mosey on over to La Quinta Inn""
When we got in the room, he started to stunt
He said, ""I'ma bring the noise to your little cunt""
So when he pulled down his pants and introduced me to cat
All I could say is, ""Where it's at, where it's at""
The dick was small, he had no balls
I said, ""You ain't doing damage, no damage at all
Lay back and let me do that right""
I made him shake, shiver, scream, wiggle, moan, and cry
You know, the nigga couldn't hang like I already knew
Made him pay me three bills, took the car keys too
Pulled up and blowed for Bunny and Mice
Rolled through the Calliope, wasn't nothing nice
A nigga said he was starving, needed his hair cut
Well, get on your knees and lick this butt
Hardcore is what I am, coming at you correct
Cause niggas ain't worth the blood on your Kotex
Oops oops, got some hair in your teeth, bitch
You graduated from tits and now you're sucking clits
Oops oops, got some hair in your teeth, bitch
You graduated from tits and now you're sucking clits
Shake for the Third Ward, shake for the Fourth Ward
Shake and take his money
I said, shake for the Sixth Ward, shake for the Seventh Ward
Make him lick that honey
Shake for the Eighth Ward, shake for the Ninth Ward
Shake it girl, shake shake shake
Or just shake for the Tenth Ward, shake for the Twelfth
Let them put the dick it's in an earthquake
Shake for Hollygrove, shake for the West Bank
Shake for the projects too
Hop for your neighborhood, hop for New Orleans
Know the rough hunting niggas, this for you

[Verse 3]
I ain't popping for no stunters, I use my head
And pop this pussy for a mink instead
I don't want no Shoney's or Denny's
But we could wine and dine at Copeland's, please
I don't need four golds in my mouth
But you can put Louis the Fourteenth in my house
I want a herringbone set and I want a purse
Bitch, I want to do me in verse
Met another nigga but he didn't like rubbers
(What?!) So he couldn't be my lover
Practice safe sex and keep the coochie clean
Because a nigga might turn your shits purple and green
And all you niggas out there claiming you don't eat
Everybody knows that that's a L-I-E
But since your ass do lie, I wish your nose did grow
Cause it would please me much better than what you got below
So where they at, get the gat and bounce baby to this
Uh, real woman shit
Niggety-niggety-nigga, I need some gear
So hustle that money and bring it here
And niggety-niggety-nigga, you better move fast
Bring me that Explorer filled up with gas
And make sure it's clean when I rep
So don't give me no-no-no don't give me carpet no sack(?)
And if I meet another nigga bumping in his shit
The pussy-ass nigga gotta deal with it
Cause ain't no nigga like a trick daddy nigga
Cause a tight motherfucker ain't shit
So if you squeak when you walk, you ain't legit
And you better just get on, bitch
All the ladies say, ain't no nigga like a trick daddy nigga
Cause a tight motherfucker ain't shit
So if you squeak when you walk, you ain't legit
And you better just get on, bitch

Now, this young nigga, he had a Benz
He had a pocket full of ends
So I pussy-whipped that ding-a-ling-ding
Cause I'mma get paid for doing my thing
Call me a bitch, or even a slut
But nigga, you know you paid for the guts
So talk that shit with your fake punk ass
But don't forget to tell them how you tricked that cash

What up, get up, boot up, c'mon
What up, get up, boot up, c'mon
What up, get up
Lick up, suck up, get up, pay up
Get up, trick up, what up, get up, what up

[Verse 4]
The Uptown women, they hauling fast
And quick to knock a motherfucker on his ass
The Downtown women got poison taste
You could smell our perfume when we walk in the place
Sassy and classy, but don't forget
With the blink of a eye, we'll handle a bitch
No medallion earrings, that's played-out shit
A bitch is down for a car and a tennis bracelet
I want Venaditi, not Polo
I want DKNY, and not Girbaud
I want Anne Klein tennis, bitch, not K-Swiss
So nigga, get on the corner and sling that shit
And if your ass get shot, that's what you get
But motherfucker, I want the disability check
Now, you could say that's cold, but that's the way it is
You gotta show a nigga that you're all about biz
I don't feel sorry when it comes to ends
I'll leave your ass for three days in a shitty Depends
Now that you're paralyzed, do what I told you to
And make that tongue work for you

A licky-licky-licky-sucky-slurp it-licky-sucky
Licky-sucky slurp it, lick it, do it, nigga
A licky-licky-licky-slurp it-sucky-licky-slurp it
Licky-sucky slurp it, lick it, do it, nigga

Ain't no nigga like a pussy-eating nigga
Cause a slurping motherfucker ain't shit
I say, ain't no nigga like a pussy-eating nigga
Cause a scary motherfucker ain't shit
And ain't no pussy like a high-priced pussy
Cause a no-budget pussy ain't shit
I say, ain't no pussy like a high-priced pussy
Cause a no-budget pussy ain't shit

So nigga, if you want a nut
You better dig in that pocket and trick up
And if you go around saying I suck that dick
You better tell them how you did that lick
All the ladies say, nigga, you want to get a nut
You better dig in that pocket and trick up
And if you go around saying I suck that dick
You better tell them how you did that lick

And all the niggas say, bitch, stop talking that shit
And keep them messy-ass hoes out my business
And if you keep on hanging with them hoes
You're gonna find your fucking ass solo
Say bitch, stop talking that shit
And keep them messy-ass hoes out my business
And if you keep on hanging with them hoes
You're gonna find your fucking ass solo

You got to be real to take care of your woman
You got to be real to take care of your children
You got to be real to take care of your mouth
You got to be real to keep your business in the South
So where the real niggas at, where the real niggas at?
Where ya at, peace me out, where ya at?
Where the real niggas at, where the real niggas at?
Where ya at, peace me out, where ya at?

You got to be real to take care of your children
You got to be real to stand by your man

Masters of the Universe,Binary Star,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Senim Silla and One Be Lo]
The two-headed dragon breathes fire, blows flames
Veins pumping octane blazing pain, same brain
Same ankle that enabled Kain to slew, that's a sharp blade
Whether you're willing or able I see your stockade
I'm from an age where the eye displays caption
It's passin' the fact that what you're really tongue lashin'
Yo, and we strikin' their backs like they caught Kunta dashin'
Can't escape slavery, boy, I'm still the master
Of natural disaster; this rap tongue-twister
Emerging from Waterworld, the mighty whirlwind
Microphone cyclone blowing in your ears, like your girlfriend
Until the worlds end all these minds putting work in
Employ these toys on a job and we'll see
But what the hell was they thinkin'?
Must've been drunk, what the hell was they drinkin'?
Wild Irish Rose, drunk as hell in a Lincoln
Head-on collisions in these rap competitions
My crew cats' record turn their frames into scrap metal
(Off to the junkyard)
‘Cause ain't nobody's on my rap level, you can ask the devil
It ain't no way in hell these contenders can hinder
Remember: Guard your fender from a friender
Mr. Senim Silla, sinister swindler, I brought you stigmas
When your hides cross a land of temper
This is a warning to you men
We're joining these tournaments of journalists
And live by the pen, now die by the sword
Tears through your gourd, gouge you through the mic cord
This fine bladed expores, watch as fine wine is poured
Now toast to this
As we pour a little out for those who be approaching this
Be approaching this, be approaching this, be approaching this
Be approaching this, be approaching this, be approaching this
[Verse 2: Senim Silla & One Be Lo]
Battle vocalist, the One Man Army in a war against Iblis
Lack of knowledge means I'm weaponless
Don't just step to this
I sent Pharoah messages, like Moses
Taking my people on an exodus
We on the run, I split the m-i-c open
Kids try to follow, but get swallowed in the ocean
Preacher of the truth, non-believers making mockery
It ain't no stopping me, I fulfill all prophecy
Similar to David with the rock
I sling shots at your bestest warrior
Plus I'm ill with the poetry
You know it's me, but you still couldn't catch us
Maneuver on the mic or lose heads, like John the Baptist
When I rap this, wack MC's feel the rapture
Others fugitive style your brains couldn't capture
Ever since the beginning of time, let there be light
That's the first day, I wrote my first rhyme
I'm still writing, I seen you looking at 'em
But don't even think about biting
Forbidden poetry is a life, dig these
Your ass couldn't hide from me with fig leaves

[Verse 3: Senim Silla & One Be Lo]
We move fast, like Quickdraw McGraw
When it's time we get raw
Our crew come together, like jigsaw puzzles
We moving on the double; a t-r-o-u-b-l-e, we spell trouble
For you cats and dogs without muzzles
Barking in my face, that'll carry no weight, like space shuttles
We rock the mic, like rubble
Binary Star came to reign; drip, drop, rain puddles
Subtle, anonymous, rap hippopotamus
Milk homogeneous, deeper than a pit that's bottomless
The knowledge is: to see us, you must be an astrologist
Stars, quasars, Sirius, synonomous"
Society Is Brainwashed,ILL BILL,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: ILL Bill]
Every society honors its live conformists and dead troublemakers
I'm the Son of Satan, sculpted the culture of the ancients
Burn me at the stake with my left hand stuck in The Matrix
I'm the apex, I steal science off of spaceships
Blackwater contractors captured off of camcorders
After mass slaughter, violent massacre, Masters of Order
Burning effigies of presidents and American flags
Veterans clash for the chance to sell terror for cash
Babylon destroyed the Beis Hamikdash
Death cults, murder squads
Exploding churches and burning mosques
Throw your dice, now your destiny's cashed
And these seeds of war were planted over centuries past
And the mysteries remain unsolved, colossal pyramids on Mars
Visitors beyond the scriptures of Allah
God is on the side of the ones with money and large armies
Pray for death amongst these brainwashed zombies
Society is brainwashed!

[Hook]
I bet you can't see what I can see
That's right!
Here's a few things we have to address
I bet you can't see what I can see
When I'm in the streets, I always remain cautious
He's good, goddamn
[Verse 2: ILL Bill]
November 5th, 2001, less than two months after 9/11 occurred
The infamous William Cooper was murdered
Ex-Naval Intelligence Officer
Renowned author of 'Behold A Pale Horse'
He paid the cost
I can't say I agree with everything that he wrote
But I admire him for speaking his mind though
Never holding his tongue for nobody, how society is brainwashed
Guns in each others faces for the same lies
Same everything and same nothing
Same bullshit materialism, the Third World man's luxury
This false flag fuckery, an AIDS infested junky
Your Lady of Liberty can't fuck me
Can't touch me, The Black Pope, superior general
Tim Osman riding like a Piru from Inglewood
Bring the hood up to a hovering mothership
They already made the switch to the One World Government

[Hook]

[Verse 3: ILL Bill]
Amongst the Ivory Tower witch doctors, witnessed  an explosion
On the Groom Lake landing strip, silicon sorcerers abandoned ship
Famine gripped the planet with the gigantic Satanic fist
Believed to be linked to Al-Qaeda through a sandwich business
I don't advise you to believe, these could be camera tricks
All I'm saying is to ask questions, amateurs
What Hollywood tries to pass off as fantasy
Might already have happened in actuality
And vice versa, if Jesus Christ was a person
Who was Mithra? Who was Krishna?
Who was the first to be baptized, crucified, resurrected?
Betrayed and made into a martyr for someone else's redemption?
Old men start wars for young dudes to die in
Madison Avenue telling you what you should be buying
Religion and science always profess peace
But in the end who created the deadly war machine?
Society is...

Geezers Need Excitement,The Streets,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chorus: Mike Skinner]
Geezers need excitement
If their lives don't provide 'em this, they incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense
Geezers need excitement
If their lives don't provide 'em this, they incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense

[Verse 1: Mike Skinner]
Out the club about three, to the takeaway
The shit-in-a-tray merchants
Shop's got special perchant for the disorderly
Geezers looking ordinary and a few looking lairy
Chips fly around to the sound of the latest chart entry
An incendiary, waiting to blast
No harm with a contest who can throw the furthest
Behind the counter they look nervous
But carry on cutting the finest cuts of chicken
From the big spinning stick
Then over flies a chip, flips and hits you on the back
You spin 'round on the attack, ""Fuck you playin' at?""
He looks like a Cheshire cat, almost falls down
Your frowns and Superman eye-lasers don't even register
By now, you wanna level this twat
And forever you're gonna regret that, your choice of path
So mash his head up and your girl's now fed up
But stop to think and it's never going to be the Jackie Chan scene
It could've been to end up
[Chorus: Mike Skinner]
Geezers need excitement
If their lives don't provide 'em this, they incite violence

[Verse 2: Mike Skinner]
So you owe someone money subbin' scunny
Best pay me, Billy, ""No worries""
One-fifty on Sunday, then in some way, that turns into Wednesday
Then goes straight to pay on a hazy evening in the local bar-café
What a way, what a way
Just to recap for those at the back, this is everyday tit-for-tat
You owe your dealer and can't pay him back fee
Suddenly, he's the baddy
So you tell your mates you could have him anyway, to look geez
But he's a shady fuck, Bimmer three series
Lock, stock and two fat fucks backin' him up
Can't convey enough of his desire for the paper stuff
In a blunt fashion, Billy's angry with a passion
So please just accept it ain't happenin'
And go back to your runnings
'Cause you might get yourself in trouble one of these days
[Chorus: Mike Skinner]
Geezers need excitement
If their lives don't provide 'em this, they incite violence

[Verse 3: Mike Skinner]
Get a hold of this bird after pub closing hours
Would your girl like this? No, don't think so somehow
In the winter showers
But she'll never know and your face will never show shit
This is how goes it, besides, she was well fit, and who could resist?
Move up to the next place, a smooth club to flex bass
Beats, and your best mates
All down, nice sound, Smirnoff Ice rounds
MCs clowning, rudeboys frowning
Everything's sweet, everything's tucked in
And 'round here, we're all downing
But all of a sudden though, just through the smoke
It's your bird laughing and joking with a bloke
Ain't just that either, as she moves closer
In a shape what looks like they're lovers, he's tonguing her
All rage sweeps up through your torso
You're more so ready to go over and show him who's man
Football fan style, leave it in the can for awhile
'Cause even as they smile, he's still got choices
Don't listen to them voices
That at the end of the day you may just have caused this
So leave the forces
[Chorus: Mike Skinner]
Geezers need excitement
If their lives don't provide 'em this, they incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense
Geezers need excitement
If their lives don't provide 'em this, they incite violence

Suicide Girl,Army of the Pharaohs,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[hook] x2
I don’t know what she’s doing now
Last I heard from her she said
She felt as if she should be dead
I guess in fact she usually does

[Verse 1: Planetary]
I never could understand the fact she ain’t returned my calls
I was the only one that I told her I loved her through all the flaws
I would always be the one to show her light in the tunnel
I swear to God I need her back, I know she’s lost in the jungle
I know she need me, can’t believe we grew apart so quick
She loved trees like me, the way the New Eras fit
She loved Tommy Hilfiger, Rugbys, and Adidas
A match made before Heaven, why the feelings have to leave us?
But they didn’t leave my heart so fast
I still wish I had her near and had a beer for her glass
Even though I know that’s her downfall from the past
Still wanna shop for old time sake if she asks
Little shot of Crown Royale, maybe 151
So if you see her let her know the plan to have us some fun
Well guess what? Today front page of the daily news
My queen betting the beam dead right ? what the fuck?
[Hook]
I don’t know what she’s doing now
Last I heard from her she said
She felt as if she should be dead
I guess in fact she usually does

[Verse 2: Doap Nixon]
Ever see a jawn so confused and assed out?
She’ll suck any dude off chasing the cash route
She went from pompoms to kine bud
I watched the innocence transform, obsession to buying drugs
Little Tooty was a cutie, I swear God
Carmel complexion, good grade with a hair bob
Ten years later now she’s bobbing to head jobs
In and out of strip clubs like a career job
And she can’t see that she’s killing herself
Cause a couple dollars got this drunk feeling herself
It’s ill how this little girl could be ruthless
She can make a nigga with three degrees look stupid
She even tried to trick a couple dollars from Cupid
Emotionally it'll drain your ass out till you’re useless
The price is high when you wanna ride
With a jawn that’s suicide, she’s a suicide, c’mon

[Hook]
I don’t know what she’s doing now
Last I heard from her she said
She felt as if she should be dead
I guess in fact she usually does
[Verse 3: Apathy]
She said I must confess it turns me on when I cut my flesh
There’s nothing left, I’m hollow, I’ll follow death
If it’s a change from the mundane Mondays
You know my pain, I’m empty inside, my veins pump Novocaine
Sometimes I feel like life isn’t real
And my brain is too busy and my mind don’t ever heal
I could never shut it off so I’d rather shut it down
Do it right the first time, I ain’t trying to fuck around
And she smiles for her friends but the smile is a mask
Any memories of happiness are filed in the past
I can sit in my garage foot revving on the gas
A slash and a gasp or a violent blast
I don’t believe in Hell unless it’s what I’m in
I wanna free my soul, straight jump out of my skin
She exhaled and sighed, eyes opened wide
Suicide, it’s a suicide, biddy-bye-bye

[Outro]
I don’t know what she’s doing now
Last I heard from her she said
She felt as if she should be dead
I guess in fact she usually does

It’s so hard for me to explain
I guess she has a strange approach
It makes her seem beyond reproach
Until you find out what she is"

We in the studio
I said, we in the studio
Is this mic on? Check, check

[Verse 1]
I'm thankful for my position I was given in life
Cause I know some people living who ain't living this life
Read about starved children who ain't eating this right
Drug lords declare war, selling cheaper the price
Stunting dummy drug money, yeah them sneakers is nice
Get your swag from the blacks selling bags of the white
Niggas can't get a job, so we self-employed
If the coppers come a-knocking, we gon' help that boy
Bail money, welcome back home out of jail money
White girl pale money, sunny when we sell money
See seashell money, we sell money
Rain, hail money, heaven what the hell money
Dusty paper, stale money, I thought they restricted it
Did for most people but we out here getting it
[Hook]
Bunch of hands under her dress, we get the feeling that she's faded
And she's willing screaming Wolf Gang, whip me off, get me off
The sex, it turns to children, then the children turn to villains
Villain wolves screaming kill them all, fuck 'em all
And that go for anybody that come around here, that ain't from around here
Ho, you too, you ain't special, Wolf Gang kill them all, fuck 'em all

[Verse 2]
She handles herself with class
She got a nice ass but she can't run no games on me
She claim to like the stores and the clothes
Jeans bleached with the holes, but she can't get my bank homie
Too smart is no good, if she smart for no good
It's so good, she can't flaunt her thing on me
She can be full of swag, drive a Jag
Poppin' tags on the Ave but she can't get her cake from me
That sounded like the hook I threw at her and the swag I reeled her in
Said she came to feel me in, when she really came to fill me in
Like baby what's the deal with it? Seem to be attracted
By the fiancee and finance that no wifey concealin' it
Dealin' with life's shuffle, then fold
Dippin' with the duffles I hold, if we are a couple, let's go
To the place where we lead in the life to some sleep
Bring the pipe, blow the weed, punchlines to be received

Put one up for shackle me not clean logic procreation
I did invent the wheel, in a previous generation
While the triple sixers' lassos keep angels roped in the basement
I locate modern halos and pass 'em out to the cavemen
Y'all catch a 30-second flash frame
Dirty cooperative med platoon
Bloom, head-trip split fantastic!
Fathom the splicing of major-league low-life
With anti-hero earthworm mentality – Godzilla!
I pace my game for zero-hour completion
See, a cretin's still a cretin, even speakin' altered moniker
American nightmare lost in the monitor
I'll hold the door open, so you can stagger through
Then send berserker-bred Jukies in after you
It's Gutter, and I spell it with the 'G' I stole from ""Get the fuck up!""
Noise crutch stolen wretched refuse of my teeming dumb luck
Still I promise: temperance towards breed still bleeding Amish
See, the freaks sucked out the wattage
While three bears invade the cottage
And I can't sleep now! Yeah, the police'll laugh
You won't be laughing when your covered wagons crash
You won't be laughing when you're hosted
By the ghost of Christmas past
You won't be laughing when your blow-up doll's got a headache and won't give up the ass
I'ma lay my kicks to rest when I'm impressed
So I staple-gun 'em to my feet
This origami dream is beautiful: pull the tail, watch the wings flap
But you really can't do a thing with that

Swallow up the pieces, spit 'em at your species
Beached in a city of lost barnacles and leeches

Night Light, Day Light, Night Light, Day Light

I'm pretty sure I got a pulse
Plus we Shimmy cross the centerfold, and our night light engulfed
Just let me keep the crumbs (Please!)
With seven deadly stains, adhere the blame to crystal conscience
The result's a dead-beat tryin' to make a dollar off a bomb threat
Okay, link me to activism chain, activate wild-style Pluto orbit
Set a course, then push the button
I swallow spores born by the laws
Of a morbid glutton– Alley gospel
I can spot a duck battalion by the Charlie Chaplin waddle (gone)
Zig-zag and zig 'em again
Before the pig can pull a badge out for the lash out
Another thick installment of one night in Gotham
Like, ""Houston, we have a problem: they're buffing the trains the same day the graffiti writers bomb 'em!""
Who split holiday freaks on box-cut cinema high road bellow?
Head gripped, watch red bricks turn yellow!
I'm tryin' to meet the wizard, but a tailgating tin-man holding a oil can won't let a hermit crab break in his new shell-toes
Life's not a bitch: life is a beyotch
Who keeps the villagers circling the marketplace
Out searching for the g-spot
Maybe she didn't feel y'all shared any similar interests
Or maybe you're just an asshole – maybe I'm just an asshole!
Kiss the speaker wire (*kiss*)
Sammy Swashbuckler pagan threshhold
Stomach full of diner food, wingspan cast black upon views
Here to help release the rabid hounds or pick apart your mood
I got this friend of polar nature, and it's all peace
You and I seek similar stars but can't sit at the same feast
Metal Captain, this cat is askin' if I've seen his bit of lost passion
I told him: ""Yeah,"" and gave him one last look and smashed him

I wake up in the morning to Ciroc and some pancakes
Give a fuck about a bar, bitch, this a mixtape!
Give a fuck about a car, bitch, this a Rover!
You drivin' a mistake like me dissin' Hova
But I don’t give a fuck, nigga, do it all again
Rule number one, never make a rap nigga friend
But I run up on a muthafuckin' rap nigga Benz
In Miami feeling like Khaled, “All I do is win""
Eighty thousand on the bracelet, watch got a face lift
Drivin' through the hood in this muthafuckin' spaceship
Feelin' like the first man on the moon
Draped in all black, whole club full of goons
Pumpin' bottles 'til them pretty hoes move
Tonight I’m fuckin' with bitches with scars and bullet wounds
Live in that Ferrari, sleep in it like a tomb
Soo Woo straight up out my mama womb, nigga
[Chorus: The Game]
I'm in all red like my brake lights
In the kitchen on the stove
Tryna get my cake right
I work late nights, graveyard shift
Nigga gotta keep it trill
I’m blessed like the angel on Rolls Phantom grill
Don’t make me hit my brake lights
It’s a cold world, but it don’t taste right
Gotta get it baked right
Eyes in the rear view
So I can see clear through the haters

[Verse 2: The Game]
From the cradle to the grave nigga, do it hard body
But I never fuck with a bitch with a hard body
Soft as a peach, life is a beach
And I’m in Venice laid on the beach, white sheets
With a dime-piece starin' at my timepiece, what it say?
By six o'clock we be chillin' at the Mandalay, nice
Chandon on the ice
Swimmin' in this fuckin' money, buy a hatin' nigga life
Ask about mine, nigga, I reply twice
Bitches run around my house, three blind mice
Get lost in this muthafucka
But I never get crossed in this muthafucka
Rottweilers at the door!
Dobermans by the pool, Dimes by the furnace
Live life like Capone cause a muthafucka earned it
Paper planes with them hunnid dolla bills
Spent a couple mill but still, nigga
[Chorus: The Game]
I'm in all red like my brake lights
In the kitchen on the stove
Tryna get my cake right
I work late nights, graveyard shift
Nigga gotta keep it trill
I'm blessed like the angel on Rolls Phantom grill
Don’t make me hit my brake lights
It’s a cold world, but it don’t taste right
Gotta get it baked right
Eyes in the rear view
So I can see clear through the haters

[Verse 3: The Game]
One love to my niggas, two claps for my hoes
Buy a dime piece some clothes, well nigga, I suppose
I can get her Jimmy Choos, don’t mean that I'ma do it
Went light skinned 'cause my first baby mama blew it
Now I’m stuntin’ on dem hoes, what happened to the Buick?
Nigga turned rap star, God bless music
Now a nigga gettin’ head whenever I choose it
Blues Brother’s jewels covered in that new Goose n’
Grew up on that Snoop shit, Gin got me woozy
Got me feelin' sorry for my nigga Lil' Boosie
Turn up the fuckin’ radio, bang a lil' Gucci
Get high as a hummingbird, and touch a little coochie
Yeah, I’m a made man, bitch what you thought?
If I want an Aston, that fuckin’ bitch bought
Tell my nigga AR, 'Go open up the vault'
And fuck what it costs, money talk, nigga
[Chorus: The Game]
I'm in all red like my brake lights
In the kitchen on the stove
Tryna get my cake right
I work late nights, graveyard shift
Nigga gotta keep it trill
I'm blessed like the angel on Rolls Phantom grill
Don’t make me hit my brake lights
It’s a cold world, but it don’t taste right
Gotta get it baked right
Eyes in the rear view
So I could see clear through the haters
I paint the whole town, same color as my brake lights"

Whattup Thugga? Boss
It's ya boy Drumma
A-yeah boy! Life goes on

[Verse 1: 8Ball]
Now I've been up, I've been down, I've been in, I've been out
I was loved, I was hated, bitch niggas tried to cross me out
Nigga I've been on, I've been off
I've been a worker, I've been a boss
Out of all the shit I've ever been, I've never been soft
I've been broke, I've been rich
And a nigga ain't never been no snitch
I'm a fat black nigga but I never had a problem gettin' no bitch
But I've been stranded, I've been alone
Had my kids before I was grown
Shot that pistol that made them young niggas
Keep that dumb shit away from my door
I've been cheated and I've been robbed
Niggas don't give a fuck who you are
Niggas don't give a fuck 'bout your status
Niggas don't give a fuck if you a star
You got all the latest guns, you got 80 niggas with you
But if niggas wanna hit ya, best believe they'll get'cha

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
Thugga, Slim Thugga
I done seen it all, saw boys ball then fall down and crawl
One day knockin' down the mall, next day tryna sell it all
These streets so wild, just one call
Can have you locked down by them laws
One nigga snitch, make up some shit
Conspiracy have you behind them walls
Game so foul, not just crack
A nigga out here tryna sell y'all rap
Feel like I'm back up in that trap
I'm in that studio tryna stack my stacks
Radio only play shit that's wack
They ain't tryna hear a nigga spit these facts
So I guess I'll never get me no plaque
But shit, I'll quit 'fore a nigga to do that
Man I'm a hustler, I don't need rap
To move out the hood and live this good
I'll sell anything that a nigga buyin'
Boys better get that understood
Was born broke up in the hood but I refuse to move back
Life goes on, just stay strong, Pac told me that, huh

[Verse 3: MJG]
Some of our mothers and fathers are gone
Our sisters and brothers are gone
Our babies and children are gone, but life goes on!
And so you gotta be strong because hard times
Do not discriminate, they only intimidate
Bully and eliminate people without any faith
And if it wasn't for the pitfalls in my life
I never ever woulda learned how to climb out
Some things you can't be told or taught
Some things you just gotta find out
Some people go from millions to nothing
Some people go from nothing to mils
But what both them got in common?
Neither one of them is happy still
You can bring a preacher or practice still
Or whatever your tactics is
So many people out here so fake
They need to take a break and practice real
Pimp tight, MJ, tryna live life and do a little good
I played my part but I didn't write the book

Life goes on (Goes on)
And on, and on
Life goes on (Goes on)
And on, and on

Hope for a Higher Power,Tech N9ne,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: spoken by Jim Jones]
“The world- The Kingdom suffers violence, and the violent shall take it by force. If we can’t live in peace, then let’s die in peace. (Applause.)
We’ve been so betrayed. We have been so terribly betrayed
So my opinion is be kind to children and be kind to seniors and take the potion like they used to take in ancient Greece and step over quietly because we are not committing suicide; it’s a revolutionary act.”

[Hook: Girl & Krizz Kaliko]
If there is a final hour
Let's hope for a higher power
1 by 1 and 2 by 2
I have ammo, what about you?
If there is a final hour

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Grandma told me the good book said
In the last days get ready for the ten plagues
1st, the rivers will be ran with red
2, 3, and 4, dead frogs will 'cause lice and flies
Sick livestock is 5; the living they must fight for their lives
6, 7, and 8, a boil storms a fire and locusts
9 is darkness, so dark it's hard for you to focus
And 10 is death of the firstborn
If I said it was questionable the religions would make it a point
To get at me and battle me, maybe have this verse torn
How will this curse form?
Well, Creationism and Darwinism been at it forever
'Bout it and I got nothin' but hurt for 'em
'Cause really nobody knows when you live
Then you die where your body goes
If it's Hell or it's Heaven
6 or the 7, well I'll keep the nina for all the foes with a gamble
That's what life is, and it's hard to handle
When the bible says worship this but the scripture's written by man though
So when man destroys us, the word might not stand so
'Til that day I'm just gon' protect my fam with ammo
[Hook: Girl & Krizz Kaliko]

If there is a final hour

And at the height of their power
(God) will send an angel to destroy them

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I've been looking for something supernatural for a long time now
But I never got proof that a spiritual realm existed, wanted to find how
Everybody sure of a supreme being, are people just seeing things?
Wondering if we get wings, seems sick to believe in an extreme king
I know it sounds far-fetched, every night I put knees on the carpet
Then I pray to who's up with the star set
'Cause the Earth in its self is a target
For destruction, for combustion
'Cause there ain't too many you can trust in
Think of all the women losing their husbands
In Iraq a lot of killing and suffering
What I hope for, seemed folklore
When the enemy kills and gloat more
'Cause they killin' us off in this hoax war
Then I wake up yellin' and my throats sore
'Cause the fight's there, it's a nightmare
If it come to me, I'm in my snipe wear
If a bullet give my lung a slight tear
I wanna believe that the light's there
So all you Christians don't get mad at me
I just hope your mystical magical miracles work in catastrophes
And this ain't blasphemy, but artillery is my strategy
I hope for a higher power when I look at all these tragedies
[Hook: Girl & Krizz Kaliko]
If there is a final hour
Let's hope for a higher power
1 by 1 and 2 by 2
I have ammo, what about you?
If there is a final hour
Let's hope for a higher power
1 by 1 and 2 by 2
I have ammo, what about you?

I will never follow the beliefs of man, why?
Because man destroys everything in his path

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Oh what a miracle, angels and demons
But the only miracle is that people keep believin'
Right hand on the bible, left hand on my rifle
Keep that for my rivals and evil disciples
Expand your mission, man to women
When they attack do you plan to give in
Or do you do like I do and say praise the lord and pass the ammunition
People like us, piece and knife up
'Cause we got evil to sweep and wipe up
Devils and demons and humans, irrelevant
So if they lookin' deceiving I bust
I hope that the higher power is watching over me
'Cause we young people don't see faith like most the older see
If he or she is listenin', a mere sign can spark me
But if the laws in the bible are bogus, then prepare for anarchy
Worst case scenario is it never ever was a higher power
So in the midst of chaos now, the only real savior is fire power
[Hook: Girl & Krizz Kaliko]
If there is a final hour

“I, with respect, die with a degree of dignity. Lay down your life with dignity. Don’t lay down with tears and agony. There’s nothing to death. It’s like Mac said, it’s just stepping over to another plane. Don’t be this way. Stop this hysterics.”"

Old school when I ride, forever sky high

I’m just rotating my tires, rotating my tires, rotating my tires, rotating my tires

Candy coated pearl with the bowling ball swirl
I’m just rotating my tires, rotating my tires, rotating my tires, rotating my tires

Now this could be one of those days
I chop on my blades, leave my worries behind
Just pretend that I’m paid
Do it big, do it large, on the boulevard
Get a sense of success, pushin' candy cars
I did some thangs for that Chevy mayne
Restored the frame, blew the brains, out on everything

She never leave me lonely

College girl
I got me a college girl

College girl, I love to romance her
I remember when I went to pick her up from Savannah
She used to go to Georgia State, she used to be a Panther
Get her in the bed she scratched a nigga like a panther
And she takes shots with the homies
Her favorite food is pizza so she loves the pepperonis
AKA so she's a sexy tenderoni
Don’t fuck with other bitches cause them other hoes be phony
Got a good head on her shoulders
Together we'll grow older
She's a modest girl
But until she graduates, she's a college girl...

[Verse 2]
I got a college lady, born in the 80s
She's a Grady baby, graduate from Grady
But that’s in high school, she's at Howard now
And she's so far away, I'm sending flowers now
And every time she visits, you know we're hanging out
And when I'm not around, I'm who she thinks about
And that’s my Howard girl, check out my Spelman girl
Shawty freak me real good, you better tell them, girl
No overnight visitations, so I'm sneaking in
And when I'm beating it, her roommates keep on peeking in
Class at 8, so I can’t stay late
So at 6 in the morning I am gonna skate
Gone

College is where she wants to be
I got a college girl come stay with me

Fortune and fame, that don’t even matter
I made it to the top and put my baby on the ladder
Smoking and drinking, just me and my baby
When I'm on the road, I be thinking 'bout my baby
My distant lover, so many miles away
I wish she would've never ever moved away
I got a shorty at UGA, shorties at Georgia State
Shorty in Jamaica but no one can take her place
I love college and college girls
So shout out to my colleges all around the world"

Souls wither, like gold diggers we follow suit

In the end I'm hoping that I take less than I give
We go through stages, I ain't talking bout gigs
And I ain't talking 'bout famous when I talk about big
Pathetic poetics, connect my life to my words
Some cause play-back pain right to the nerves
For me it's hard to hear (that you're hard of hearing)
Didn't believe I was def till some checks started clearing
Now that's a different kind of clarity
And love for your brother, that's a different kind of charity
Ya I rap fearlessly, but I act carelessly
When I'm busy on my grizzly, I'm a quarter bi-polar bear with me
The rarest breed, naw, I'm just a parakeet
I talk what I hear, I do as they do and I hate what I fear you see
A simple animal sin is sincerity

If you don’t then let me go

[Tyga - verse 1]
The memories soon fade, why couldn’t they be erased
You hoping it’s just a phase, your heart’ll heal within days
Some people think it’s wrong, being single isn’t right
But you hurt the right person you’ll be wrong all your life
Inevitable to let you go, separate the sexual
Feelings when I’m close to you, fuckin' til’ the sky is blue
Morning time, home fries, cookin' with your t-shirt on
Panties, bra, damn I eat you good when you take it off
Ha, damn I’m nasty, I mean you make me nasty
Going the extra mile flyin' just to make me happy
Did it all, too much wasn’t enough
Now it’s gone but sometimes I sit and hope

[Adele]
I hoped you’d see my face and that you’d be reminded
I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it
I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it
I hoped you’d see my face and that you’d be reminded
I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it
I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it

[Tyga - verse 2]
Whatever ever happened to love and being happy
Infatuated with lust; I loved you and now I’m backwards
Time is of the essence, I broke it, took it for granted
Love is like art, heartbroken on the canvas
Painted the perfect picture, you seemed to never get it
Colors prevail and you turn into a fucking monster
Schizophrenic, nicknames Bonnie and Clyde
Now doctors calling us Mr. and Mrs. Hyde
How do you manage but still do you
Can’t compromise, we all equal opportunists
It’s when I’m level headed they aiming to take my head off
Birds flock together, tell bitches I’m throwing bread off
Cold, women fall in love gettin' splintered
Strictly platonic, only thing she want is dinner
I can’t fuck with her, get her some tonic, gin, liquor
She might let me lick her, now she miss me sayin

[Adele]
I hoped you’d see my face and that you’d be reminded
I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it
I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it
I hoped you’d see my face and that you’d be reminded
I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it
I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it

Girls in the p.m., excuses PMS

Hola, hola, what you got to say?

Now get your…
Or maybe if you’re ... some of us right here
Then none of these would matter
And...wouldn’t have to make a song with all these
Flutes, clarinets, trumpets and trombones
My drum shit is led by Louis Vuitton
Louis shoes, Louis drum sticks, and Gucci…
Who you think you’re fooling, you’re not fooling me son!
… favors, we ain’t doing you one!
Here some advice! ... an we’ll talk negotiations
If you’re hasting, we’re not pacing, we’re take it…
Understand, this corporation is more like a congregation
And come up with compilations that will have you make…
Chorus:

No you can’t…

No you can’t…

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
First rule in this thang: never let 'em see you sweat
Never let 'em be a threat
And your feelings you must protect 'em, as well as your rectum
Must keep self out of harm, out of danger's way
Let strangers play while you graduate and move on
True happiness is not acquired and you won't find it for sale
Unless you're in jail and trying to get a bail
Bondsman to go on and post that bail
You would be happy as hell
You thought you was happy until that court date came
Couldn't abort that case
Nobody to take your place, family members at stake
Too late to escape and get on the run

Once upon a rhyme, one time when I was a child
(Flip that smile upside down now!)
When I found out that Santa Claus was nothing more than Vanilli
It was silly, 'cause my mom and pop, they worked for every penny
Didn't have many but had enough to get by, enough to get fly
Only to start the New Year off in debt
Now you forget your happiness came and went
Like mom and dad's relationship
Take a trip, you bring potato chips, I'll bring the (hot sauce!)

1979, Dirty South, local lounge
(Flip that smile upside down now!)
I never thought that alcohol could ease the notion of the sadness
Now what done used to be a happy home done turned into some bad shit
Graphic, language, mild violence and the silence of the the fams
No members to remember but I know just who I am
I've grown into a man and like my nigga said
We executed the dungeon plan 'cause we got that (Hot sauce)

I don't miss you
I'mma dismiss you
I'mma kiss you, next time I see you
It's true

Give me all your lovin', give me all your war
I don't need much of that
No, no, I'mma be alright, I'mma be alright

[Verse 1: Shwayze]
Seventeen, hero beauty queen introduced to me
She in the Hollywood scene
Moved to Cali from NYC
It's been eight months and she ain't happy
A couple shots of Patron, she eased the pain
Chased it with some Jack just to smile again
The everyday routine
Of a broken teen who left her heart close to where she left her dreams:
Hidden, tucked away so far now they missing
I took her hand and said baby listen
For every moment you waste, there's another right behind it to take its place
Cause life goes on when it ain't so sweet
Don't give up on me
Get back on your feet
If you can take another breath you gon' be okay
Just smile, forget yesterday
[Chorus: Cisco]
Give me all your lovin', give me all your war
I don't need much of that
No, no, I'mma be alright, I'mma be alright
Cause all I need is a bag of weed
And a lazy Susan, so I can watch my TV

[Verse 2: Shwayze]
In the mall's where I met her
Wearing a brown sweater
She said she had a man
But I said I could do it better
My name is Shwayze, she responded with I'm Loretta
What a beautiful name, she said what beautiful game
One conversation lead to another
On to some drinks, now we fucking each other
Constant sex turn to constant text
Saying how much she missed me
Wishing she could be with me
Damn, I made her cheat on her man
What makes me think she won't be cheating again
I just said never mind, yeah I miss you too
Give me a sec and I roll on through
Days turn to week, now holding hands and kissing cheeks
Using nicknames, spittin' game is obsolete
Damn, don't do to me what you did before
I just kept my mouth shut and we fucked some more
Yeah

[Chorus: Cisco]
Give me all your lovin', give me all your war
I don't need much of that
No, no, I'mma be alright, I'mma be alright
Cause all I need is a bag of weed
And a lazy Susan, so I can watch my TV

[Verse 3: Shwayze]
I've given too many chances to exotic dancers
Asking too many questions and receiving no answers
Investing my finances on pills for enhancement
Even got some facial cream so they could think I was handsome
Now, tell me that ain't insecurrrre
Yeah, you're right baby but how am I gonna fuck her?
It seems nowadays that's our only motive
And we're going to the first date without a trojan

[Chorus & Outro: Cisco]
Give me all your lovin', give me all your war
I don't need much of that
No, no, I'mma be alright, I'mma be alright

Knowin I'm there father like my name is Darth Vader
I can get you hemmed up while I'm being tailored
Then I slide off to the side like a fader
Homey i'm the president, governor and mayor!
I control everything, like a dictator!
Get you biz marked up, turn you into vapors!
If you got a problem get you swallowed like a chaser!

Caught up in the rapture, like Anita Baker

I'm tryin to keep it cool, if you wanna, you can move, if you wanna
Tryin to have a little fun, maybe move a couple numbers but
When you movin numbers, all the haters start to wonder
Then they talk behind your back, in the breath they speakin under
Man I'm hot, like the sun, like the middle of the summer!!!
Strike down in a flash, nigga you can call me thunder!!!
Chicks call me phil drummond 'cause i give 'em different strokes!!!
Bahh, bahh, bahh, bahh, bahh, beat it up, like a drummer!!!
They can call it one-hit wonder, but I guess that means I'm one-up
Light a match, play with fire, that just means you goin get burned up
In the river, where you turn up, cause they see I'm on the come-up
But it's our, turn, now, if you want it, take it from us
I don't need no goons by me, if you want it come and try me!!!
We can do this broad day, in the middle of the lobby!!!

When they problems turn to prolly and they prolly turns to sorry!!!

Lookin' out my loft windows man my dreams became true
Lookin' at the mirror, wondering if it's the same dude
Lookin' at my closet wondering if it's all about clothes
Look right next to me, wondering if it's all about
Hop in the car and asked the OnStar where this life goes
And I drive so fast I blur the light post
They say Drive Slow, I say ""I know""
Then errrr, away I go
And the way I flew
In this year or two
I know this is what God put me here to do
But in this excitement
You just might miss
A shorty with a demo like ""Hey, you might like this""
And see
He
Remind me of me
Just a year ago
Now he
Tellin' me
I'm his her-ro-oh
I took his CD and asked him what he's lookin' for
He said, ""Man, I don't know. Maybe a miracle""
[Verse 2: Patti Labelle]
Time, they say (true story, [kanye west])
There ain't no way
Your dreams are gone see the light of day
Don't believe
That you can't achieve
Whatever you're after
You can't be swayed
By the simple minds
That wanna hold you down
And in His time
The pain you carry
Will be left far behind

[Pre-Hook: (Patti Labelle) and Mary Mary]
If you listen to the sermons
And ask the Lord for guidance
You will see the many blessings (blessings you have received)
When you give Him all the glory (glory)
Gonna talk to, don't ignore thee (ignore thee)
Listen to all the stories
Meant to sing Your name

Don't let no one stand in your light
Change the way you feel inside

Can tell you what your worth
Stand up, your the child of The King
And you can do anything

You try to please everyone
Time to live your life
Release those old illusions
Stop wasting time and
Start embracing
His light and let it shine

[Verse 4: Patti Labelle]
(Don't you listen) when they say
(You won't make it) oh it ain't no way
(Through the madness) never stop believing in yourself
In the morning you'll see
All the answers that free
You from chains that would seem
To keep you standing still

Don't let no one stand in your light
Change the way you feel inside

Can tell you what your worth
Stand up, your the child of The King
And you can do anything

[Verse 5: Consequence]
I got an angel on my shoulder and I know he been warning me
To stay out the clubs where the police and warrants be
Cause that will lead to prison where the inmates and wardens be
But a lot of times we follow them when we know we ought to leave
And stay up in the party when we know that we ought to leave
But the women be callin' me
The liquor be callin' me
And what's the sense in Cons tippin' strippers named Diamond?
If he gonna be conflicted no different than diamonds
And the Lord is the only one that he can confide in
So I don't know how you think that you could deny Him
I open up the Book and the message is clear
But I still be in the hood so the pressure is there
To grab at that fast money just to get out of Queens
To bag up the work that they give out to fiends
But that ain't gonna work if I say what I mean
Cause at the end of the day I'm trying to Get Out My Dreams
[Hook x2]
Don't let no one stand in your light
Change the way you feel inside
Nobody on this earth
Can tell you what your worth
Stand up, your a child of The King
And I can do anything

[Outro]
Oh yes I can
Yes I can
I can do all things [?]
Nobody on this earth can tell you what you're worth
You're a child of The King
Never stop believing in yourself
The way you feel inside
Nobody on this earth
Stand up, stand up
And you can do anything

Hundred dollar bills,ELI,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Hundred dollar bills, this hunt for the dollar kills
Running after my money, like suicide drills
Ama stop for a breather, with a lung full of refer
Got me thinking bout my past, like im meeting the repear

My chances getting slimmer,nigga fuck JeNNY craig
Thoughts sicker than hell, like a hospital bed
I wana get paid, sick of faillin 10th grade
I wana get fame, get money, get made

I swear to god all I need is a deal
Cause im pullin all the stops get your hands off the wheel
Its the root of all evil, and I wana be the villin
Sports car drivin with alot of plastic women

Champagne spillin , bently driven dreams
Ill get my deal soon,like the pick of the team
Speakin money in my tunes, fluent no accents
Jeans cemetary, pockets full of dead presidents

I need much more money but tell me who's countin
Every week rushmore, presidents like the mountin
Getting papper when I can, tell'em haters ima man
Got my heart in my hand, shadow long when I stand
Move along now, there's nothing to see
If its more than a penny, then its somehting to me
Goodfellas in the city, slap hands with the big man
Notorious artilary,you know I spit it sicker than

Six men, with the sixth sense
To stick letters together better than the dictionary can
Yall fictionary, man, get yo ass whooped from a can
Supply beef route to yo ass, deliver van

Im here for a while, more money to make
Getting money is good, becoming rich is great
Gettin doe for the cake, guess my birthday late
So ama be on my grind, guess rappers do skate

For them back stabin friends, dont even say wassup
Take the knife out they hand, they get nothin to put up
So they laughin at your dreams, pokin holes at your skeems
Takin shots at the lead, causin problems with the team

They can never tear me down, im air tight, bullet proof
High above the ground, fair hight, skilled booth
Any beat I runthrough,no heads up like one, tow
Keep a chin up for the public, like lost souls do

Bangin doors for my money like the rent's passed due
Mama tell me, your 18 but your life passed you
Gotta young man look, with an old man view
Every body judge man, like we all got sued
Im a fresh breath of air, flow so brand new
Death or billionare, took a choice in 92
So now its I get money, or its money I got
Till my bubbly do spill, when im chillin on a yacht"

Bought a bunch of shit that I thought I had to have
An irresponsible asshole, listen to dad, nope
Didn't think it was bad so I did it, an arrogant derelict
And didn't know cause I was onto better clothes
Then it went to more dough, then it went to better hoes
Then it went to bigger shows, waiting to achieve those still
Just kept telling myself that I will
But now, I've realized I had a problem back then
Waiting for lights, cameras, zeros, action
Rhymes written on paper with zero passion
All I really need is numbers, couple zeros after them

Third grade was fucked up, but fourth grade I lucked up
Found out that all the fat black girls were dumb sluts
Fifth grade was even worse, found my teacher had a purse
Stole her birth control and then she had her second and her first
Sixth grade came around, I was a punk on playing grounds
Until I threw a brick at Rick that cracked his skull and laid him out
So by the seventh grade I thought that I was hard as shit
Ran up on the little bus, punched all the retarded kids
Granny got mad because my teacher went and called the bitch
She threw away my 64 and broke all of the cartridges
Fucking cunt, now I can't do shit but watch the partridges
And shoot at unsuspecting dogs to fix my sloppy marksmanship
And don't be expecting me to get all your dirty laundry did
I'll finish that the second that you tell me who my father is
Grandma, what you doing with that fucking hockey stick?
Why you running towards me with that devil grin? Stop it, bitch!

If he'd seen how tight them pants is on your ass
You have no business touchin' the mic
And with pants that tight you should just wear tights
Since when is it cool to dress like a dude
That fucks another dude
Y'all To Wong Foo
I pray for a monsoon
To come this way
And wash away every rapper just like you
First there was the dumbed down lyrics and chants
Now it's autotune and thugs with tight pants
This ain't the '70s and rap ain't disco
That ain't rap shit, yo that's more like Sisqo
We need more Bishop Lamonts and Wales
We need more Saigons and more Freeways
And I could go on with emcees all day
But you'll never hear about 'em cause the radio's gay
Except for Sirius
And I can seriously say
Since Pac and Big died, shit just ain't the same
If I was you, I wouldn't release them records
Your pants so tight you got a yeast infection
Rappers all singin', but they ain't singers
Cheatin' on the game, hip-hop swingers
I could kick one rhyme and glow like sunshine
The shit get me hype like a Lloyd Banks punchline
I'm ghetto like the lunch line on park street
In Lawtown y'all candy rappers too sweet
You are not deep
You made your bed, now sleep
And I hope you burn in hell, wrapped up in the sheets
On the east
I get mad love in the streets
I'm a beast
I leave any rapper deceased
Like 50 did to Ja
I'm crispy and I'm fly
And the funny shit is, yo I still ain't signed
Just imagine when I get my first million dollars
I'mma diss every label nigga that ain't holla
These dudes that they signin' now, they ain't the problem
They probably would been better off in a condom
I seen this rap dude you know walkin' around
I thought he was a chick 'til he turned around
Then I seen his face
His look was outta place
So pussy that he coulda got mushed by mace
We need more cats that rap like Joell
Cause these new cats won't act for Sean Bell
All they wanna rap about is gay shit
Whatever happened to BET, the basement
You see the type of shit we bein' replaced with?
Face it, every rapper you love now ain't shit"
Riot,Diabolic,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Deadly Hunta]
It’s Diabolic and Deadly Hunta, you know who?  I told ya’.  We’re livin’ in a serious time.  I'mma do this for my dawgs.  I'mma look and tell em’ this.  Yo

[Hook: Deadly Hunta]
The way the system will become, you won’t feel relaxed (Riot)
The way the police that run me down that make me wanna collapse (Riot)
If you see my people in a struggle Diabolic won’t feel relaxed (Riot)
That make me won’t feel relaxed (Riot)
That makes me want to collapse (Riot)
They brainwash education yo that make want to collapse (Riot)
The guns and crack them distribute that make me want to collapse (Riot)
For what they done to Sean Bell that make me want to collapse (Riot)
That make me won’t feel relaxed (Riot)
That makes me want to collapse (Riot)
That make me won’t feel relaxed (Riot)

[Verse 1: Diabolic]
Yo, they say my arms are too short to box with God
But at least they’re long enough to slap a cop so hard he lands in Scotland Yard
So bring your riot squad 'cause I'mma bring some people starvin’
Marchin’ like an angry mob on the police department
“Calling all cars, radio for reinforcements
The city’s being taken over, so proceed with caution”
Freedoms lost and we don’t need an equal portion
And when Jesus walked in, his footsteps echoed over demons talkin’
Excuse me, officer.  It seems you took a wrong turn
Now you’re in my world, watchin’ Babylon burn
We don’t need no water—pass my team some gasoline
And let the muthafucka burn.  I don’t care—I have a dream
And in this dream, dirty cops get popped and locked in prison
And there’s a hollow tip in every corrupt politician
Here’s a proposition: up the ante—stakes is high
Pray to god for revolution and I ain’t afraid to die
'Cause people shouldn’t fear their government—that’s the issue
The government should fear to people’s right to pack a pistol
See, it’s our right to start a riot around here
And publicly decapitate the King right in town square
[Hook: Deadly Hunta]

[Verse 2: Diabolic]
I smell the corruption in the air, and yeah, it’s tasting tainted
So we marchin’, singin’ war chants, faces painted
Basic training’s over.  I became a soldier
’Cause city hall’s full of rats, rattlesnakes, and cobras
Police are trained to be the same and rape the culture
Plant coke and baking soda on you to make a quota
That’s why I’m like “Fuck all you pigs. Go to hell.”
“Drop that badge and gun and step inside this holding cell.”
So, lick a shot and give a round of applause
If you ready for war and you’re down for the cause
Make some noise.  Then go out and form a crowd of your boys
Now wile out and scream “Freedom” like you’re proud of your voice
It’s a choice that you make inside not to be another victim
And before the system fucks you, say “Fuck the System”
I wouldn’t be surprised if by the time we turn and look
Police are rounding up some religious group and burning books
While crook lobbyists party down at Ground Zero
Shoot to kill and make the supervillain town hero
Now it’s clear, though, so you can either just deny it
Or give the kids a future and start a fucking riot!

Yes, uh, yeah!
Professor Griff, Public Enemy Number One
The Minister of Information
Yeah, Canibus
It's Melatonin Magik, yo

[Verse 1: Canibus]
This is Melatonin Magik, Sumerian, Chinese, Egyptian, Latin
Nobody can match Canibus when I'm rappin' (What happened?)
Captain Cold Crush get it crackin'
Theres more than one person right now that's not laughin'
Squash microphones with unknown chromosomes
To discover the codes that controls the brain's frontal lobes
The pineal gland glows (Go, go, go, go, go!)
Don't look back, I got ya back bro
He's a high profile target, code name Sergeant Armpits
He was Rakim Allah's first artist
""Lemme bus' em; nah, I'mma punish em, Ra!""
I'mma show you how the mothafuckin' government lied
Got nothin' to do with pride, you must realize
Few of us will be alive by Solar Cycle Twenty-Five
I tried to look for solutions, that's not enough time
They won't be satisfied til every one of us die
Aight, calm the fuck down and listen to my rhymes
The only way that you can free yourself is your mind
First thing you gotta do is put the antagonism behind
Then you gotta put ya life on the line
The reward is great; the risk? Even greater
Fellowship can only make a Braveheart braver
Watch who you followin', watch who you praisin'
""Yes We Can"" backwards is ""Thank You Satan""
Yes, I'm Jamaican, Yes, I'm a patriot
No, I will not forsake you for a paycheck
YES this is victory, YES I can taste it
NO I'm not a Mason, I'm followin' my trainin'
They monitor my body functions from central London
My heart rate is thumpin', I suffer from numbness
A robot arm shoves the drugs in
My scrubs are disgustin' and sullen, I smell like cub skin
Funky, funky, funky odor; Bridgewater, South Dakota
My spit fizz like soda, I'm in a coma
In a pagoda, nurse McLovin'
Says she wouldn't fuck me if I was her husband, don't trust the bitch
I'm in a warehouse alone, I hear doors open and close
No phone, no Intercom controls
Wouldn't matter anyway I'm in a paranormal zone
Goose bumps grow, I could hear a few ghosts moan
I'm a mastermind
Tryna amplify the frequency of the rhyme
So I can learn to fly
So yeah, fuck a punchline
I'm past that prime, that's not a crime
So go find someone else to dick ride
Focus on the truth, it's long overdue
It woulda never happened if I told you what I wanted to do
The Inconvenient Truth is a convenient truth
2012 solar cycle 24 comin' soon
I promise you, Canibus achieved the impossible
It's only logical its time for the truth
Whether I'm gonna be around to witness it or not
I spit this shit for hip-hop
Twitter niggas type their hype they write Canibus smash the mic
'Cause you can't blackball the light
They know my hands always been tied
You call that a fight?
Give me the mic, I call in an airstrike
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
There's some things in this world that money can't buy
Respect, honor, fuck it, it's all corrupted
The media can not be trusted
You shouldn't need a budget to rep Hip Hop
You don't have to suck dick just to get your shot
Just work with what you got, don't be a robot, be human
Influenced by hip-hop music
It ain't nothin like, it ain't nothin like
It ain't nothin like hip-hop music
It ain't nothin like, it ain't nothin like
It ain't nothin like hip-hop music
50 plus bars is some new shit
Its called Melatonin Magik and music
Yeah, 50 plus bars is some new shit
Its called Melatonin Magik and music, no bullshit
Take it back to 1997 exclusive Clue shit
The most abusive MC in hip-hop music
Lyrically you can't do shit
[Outro: Professor Griff]
Uh!
Melatonin Magik allows no MC's energy to escape
I seal their fate
Canibus, the last MC at God's gate
Melatonin Magik, uh
Melatonin Magik, the perfect absorber of light and all energy frequencies
I eat light to maintain and expand, evolve matter frequently
Melatonin Magik, uh
Melatonin Magik, I'm the Energizer battery

The TV light fills my heart like a balloon
I hold it in as best I can
I know I'm just another fan
But I can't help feeling I could love this secret agent man
And I can't

Wait any more for him to discover me
I got it bad for David Duchovny
David Duchovny, why won't you love me?
Why won't you love me? Why won't you love me?

My friends all tell me
""Girl, you know it's just a show""
But deep within his eyes
I see me wrapped up like a bow
Watching the sky for a sign
The FBI is on my mind
I'm waiting for the day
When my lucky stars align
In the form of
David Duchovny floating above me
In the alien light of the spaceship of love, I need
David Duchovny hovering above me
American Heathcliff, brooding and comely
David Duchovny, why won't you love me?
Why won't you love me? Why won't you love me?

So smooth and so smart
He's abducted my heart
And I'm falling apart
From the looks I receive
From those eyes I can't leave
Well, you can say I'm naive
But he told me to believe
Ooh

My bags are packed, I am ready for my flight
Want to put an end to my daydream days and sleepless nights
Sitting like a mindless clone
Wishing he would tap my phone
Just to hear the breath of the man, the myth, the monotone
And I would say

David Duchovny, why won't you love me?
Why won't you love me? Why won't you love me?
David Duchovny, why won't you love me?
Why won't you love me? Why won't you love me?
David Duchovny, I want you to love me
Kiss and to hug me, debrief and debug me
David Duchovny, I know you could love me
I'm sweet and I'm cuddly, I'm gonna kill Scully

Why won't you love me? Why won't you love me?

Ay nigga I'm better than the rest you just rest, boy please

An ironic way to die

And two balls minus one

Well, that's a Nike worker's meal
And Santa clause multiplied by ""i?""
Well I guess that makes him real
And the square root of the NBA is Africa in a box

Ya give the pencil to Michael J. Fox

Alright, word problems, ready?

If there's a fat guy in a pastry shop with a twenty dollar bill and he's ready to buy
In order to predict his volume change you'll need to know the value of pie
And there's a metal train that's a mile long and at the very back end a lightning bolt struck her
How long till it reaches and kills the driver, provided that he's a good conductor
And if ten percent of men are gay
Twenty percent of men are Chinese
What are the odds that a man chosen at random spends his free time and mealtime while on his knees?
And if Kim is half as old as Bobby
Who is two years older than twelve-year-old Tori
For how many more 30 day months will their threesomes be considered statutory rape?

'Cause math can be sexy

'Cause having sex is like quadratic expansion
If it can't be split then its time to stop
And having sex is like doing fractions
It's improper for the larger one to be on top
And having sex is like math homework
I do it best when I'm alone in my bed
And squaring numbers are just like women
If they're under thirteen just do them in your head

You gotta keep your balance or you fall into the gap
It's a challenge, but I manage 'cause I'm cautious with the strap
Do damage to your cabbage? Damn, a thought that cannot pass
See, why you don't want no friction like the back of a matchbook?
Daddy Fat Sax will fold you and your MacBook
Close shows, shut you down before we go broke backwards
Act up, and whether we high or low, we gonna get back up

Speak out if you do, you're not easy to find (Right)
Incompatible (Ayo, Sledgren, lemme talk to 'em real quick)
It don't matter though (Ready?)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Uh, with all these expectations peakin'
They wonder what I'm 'bout to do ('Bout to do)
Sparked interest, music, I can count on you, right? (Right)
Or do I have it all twisted? (Twisted)
I went from popular to misfit in an instant
My friends forgot me 'cause they probably see me hardly (Damn)
Always in the lab when I should be out at a party (Truth)
It drive me crazy, and money is the fuel (Vroom)
Insomniac, awake, findin' somethin' I can do
To put the work in and I'm certain that I'm flirtin' with the fame
For failure gettin' jealous, throwin' dirt upon my name
It's burnin' up my brain but I'm workin' through the pain
'Cause life's hard 'til you learn it's just a game
Play your cards, use your letters on your Scrabble board (Play it right)
If you smart, put your heart into your rappin' more (Uh-huh)
No money? Why the fuck you countin' for? (I don't know)
A thousand chores, tryna get up my allowance more (Haha)
[Chorus: Mac Miller & Natasha Bedingfield]
Incompatible (But still they say)
It don't matter though
(I just tell 'em I'ma do me, ya know?)
'Cause someone's bound to hear my cry (Hater can hate)
Speak out if you do (But I'ma make music)
You're not easy to find (Period)
Incompatible (The High Life)
It don't matter though (What?)
'Cause someone's bound to hear my cry (Most Dope)

Yea-uh, here we go here we go here we go
Talk about that Word of Mouf baby
Yeuh, yeuh yeuh yeuh yeuh! Here we go, here we go
Ludacris, 4-Ize, D.E. what you want now now now now

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Check it! You see I live a life filled with chicken and malt liquor
And women that are real life scratch'n'sniff stickers
I shoot videos and get knobs slobbed in trailers
Then hit stage and break a leg like Lawrence Taylor
You pricks is all talk, and it's bad for your health
See I ain't gotta say shit, money speaks for itself
With all models I make I'm great like five lakes
You got rims on ya truck? Man I got rims in my skates
You rolling on dubs, I roll right into clubs
Dirty as home with more rings than ya tub
You think it's all practical jokes and big bloopers
But I smack bitches with no titties that work at Hooters
Just get a couple of girls that shaking they thangs
Then I put 'em on camera and cut two frames
With some gasoline drawers I'll be going to Hell
Ludacris, fuck like a nigga fresh out of jail
I got Junkyard Dogs, I'm rowdier than Rod Piper
And my baby's assed out, cause I rub my cars with her diapers
So you can pray for now if you sinned in the past
""Word of Mouf,"" time to wipe that silly grin off yo' ass
[Verse 2: 4-Ize]
These rap cats is soft like R&B singers
It's 4-Ize, I've worked for wings and chicken fingers
I reps mo' parts so Chi-Town could get seen
I'm a Dirty Bird now but I keep shit clean
I rip meanface niggas one by one
Or two by two, I'll take 'em however they come
Instead of a gun, I'll pull out a stick from woodworking
The black Hacksaw Jim Duggin stay lurking
Creepin, I'm in the shadows, the nightshade
You want the tail in the back or, a light fade?
Cause Tony Scissorhands is the barber, the butcher
I kill ya smoke a blunt and forget where I put ya
I'm Soopafly like Snuka, I smack hoes
The black rolls with the dozen attack flows
I rock Shaq's clothes when I Alter Beast
Power up, get big, it's Disturbin' Tha Peace"
Can I Watch?,Viktor Vaughn,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Viktor Vaughn]
Mmm... My cousin's friend's friend wanna meet me
Saw V on TV, said she need a sweetie
Heard he was the type to do her name in graffiti
And greet her with a kiss *mwah*, straight gentlemanly stee, a G
Whatever's meant to be is meant to be
She can slip a smile that make a nigga flip wild
Herringbone Name Chain, diamond chips, crips style
With the matching bracelet, sweats with the K-Swiss
Athletic chick who run track, ""Hey, miss
Pleasure's all mine, please call me Vik""

[Verse 2: Apani B Fly as Nikki]
Okay, I did a full inspection
Head-to-toe, he rocked black denim (Mmm)
Flashed the grin, sweet as sin
Said to him: ""Hey, my name's Nikki
You're twenty minutes late and almost missed me""
Turned off my CD, I was bumpin' vintage Biggie
(""... and bullshit, and party ..."")
Said: ""I love the way you smile, but your eyes look tricky
Yo, I gotta be home by 8:30 or my moms'll kill me
She spazzes out when I'm late
Plus she says that I'm too young to date
So overprotective, I wish she'd take a sedative and shit
Yeah, but that's whatever, what's your perspective?
Tell me more about you, Vik""
[Verse 3: Viktor Vaughn]
It's love at first sight, that's the proof
He wasn't out right too thirst, but in truth
Fresh as a mayflower, face like power
He had the green light, she asked him: ""What's the plan tonight?""
Flavor of the night, Samsara and Fahrenheit

[Verse 4: Apani B Fly as Nikki]
He talked, I listened
He listened, I spoke (True, true)
We walked arm-in-arm and split a Cherry Coke
Spit religion and politics, Sega and chess
Roots and culture, hip-hop, skunk and cess
I caught him sneekin' peeks at my breasts
While frontin', namedroppin' connects

[Verse 5: Viktor Vaughn & Apani B Fly]
First started out like she was just Vaughn's friend
Used to act grown for pretend, whisperin'
Speakin' on the phone, for hours on end
On the bone from just listenin', and then:
Call me back, my mother home, spoke to tone, again
Call back and do the same thing tomorrow
If somethin' don't give, I'll be forced to ignore her
Gettin' on my last nerves, forget it
All this talking shiddit and V ain't even hit it yet
It's uncharacteristic of the vet
[Verse 6: Apani B Fly as Nikki]
Hickies on my neck; the whole last night, I couldn't sleep
Practice the words I used to greet you the next time we meet
Think of you and feel heat, that make my cheeks blush
Close my eyes and feel your touch
Get chills when you slip me tongue, picture me with you
Could my fantasies of teen love come true?
Got me wonderin' how far I'll go
To prove my moms and everybody wrong
I miss you every time I hear a love song and whenever you're gone
Until I see you, then, I feel short of breath
I think maybe I'm ready, to take the next step... (Yes)

[Verse 7: Viktor Vaughn]
Bet, I got your cab fare, dinner and a movie
Bring a change of clothes just in case it's all groovy
Watch when I see you, I miss you a lot, yo
How about a nightcap, maybe a bottle of Mo'?
So V can bite your titties like a baby toddler, ho

[Verse 8: Apani B Fly as Nikki & Viktor Vaughn]
Oh no, you didn't! You called me a what?
Don't make me wig out
How you gonna let some shit like that slip out your mouth?
(Nah, I was just...)
If I was there, I'd smack you in your smirk (Ooh)
For actin' like a jerk, thought you was cool
But now I doubt the shit is gonna work
I'm not hurt, I'm pissed off, kiss off
Fuck this shit
[Verse 9: Viktor Vaughn]
Wait, I know I play too much
Hey, on the way, could you please pick up two Dutch?
Okay, peace, see you when you touch
I wonder if she ever had her cootie cat ate-ate
Vaughn can't wait to long-stroke it on the late-late

[Verse 10: Apani B Fly as Nikki]
Wait, first, let's get this shit straight-straight (Right now)
Don't call me out my name, I'm not the one to get played-played
Out... Niggas, go figure 'em out
They're all the same-same with a lame-lame story
Like my ex-man Mike
Got my best friend pregnant and he still tryin' to call me
Well, fuck Mike and fuck Vik, too
I wound up on Prozac from all the shit he put me through
Only been off my prescription three weeks
And you got me flippin', rippin' my hair out
Never thought you'd treat me like a pigeon, I'm out
It's over, I'm gone, so long

[Refrain: Apani & Viktor]
I'd rather masturbate than fuck with Vik Vaughn
I'd rather masturbate than fuck with Vik Vaughn
Let me watch
I'd rather masturbate than fuck with Vik Vaughn

[Outro: Viktor]
Still... so.. so-so what time you gonna be here, yo?
Aight?
You know I'm gonna be waitin', yo, just holla and ring the buzzer

Addicted to weed, bitches and big chains
Car so big Id crash if I switch lanes
Sayin' you the man nigga, quit playing
How you winning If I ain't switch teams
Bitch I had the same dream since I was sixteen
Rippin' life out of the plastic
Turnin' everything to platnuim
Got six rings do I look like Phil Jackson?
Meat Earl Mac and bunch of Tony Braxtons

I never lead a state where bags climb?
And this my city when Im in it nigga stand down

Money will turn you evil, and that weed will have you nervous
But them bitches get you cute, and the pussy more potent
But I dont give a fuck, im stating callin hoes over
Mr. weedman meet me at my shows if you holdin'
A lot of niggas want it, and a lot of niggas chase it
But a lot of niggas die before they make
So while im getting money im gonna blow it like my papers
Where the fuck my bottles, where my mother fucking waitress, sorry darling are we clear?
Im standin' as a man till' im ruined
The worst thing you could do to me is shit I should be doing
And if a niggas fronting I take two and put it through him

Celestial Clockwork,Illogic,"['hip hop', 'jazz', 'blues', 'r&b']","[Verse 1:]
I walked into a life of tainted dreams and gumball machines
Nestled between the window seat and the drain of the main stream
Watching chaotic daylight stand stern on horizon's table
Mock the moon with liquidated stars lapped from a ladle
Looking glass has limited view when you're trapped in a label
Still borns' turned action figures when they're stacked in a cradle
Thorough bred disorientated from running laps in a stable
Loss of direction sparks the search for a map in the fable
Leave me to hunt for scavengers with eye patches and peg legs
Use planks to punish perpetrators so the seas will stay fed
I taught that snake in the grass to roll over and play dead
When the seed of the righteous is planted in belly of hybrid companion
They fled with torn a silver spoon and lips grasped
Cherishing the John Hancock or some jock on your lips clasped
Find your own only path this is my territory to tell a story
Tailored in three pieces flag, oxygen and thesis
I'm nursed by the bosom of a Columbus compass
Since birth walking the line of life of rhyme to see which will die first
It took me awhile to realise the fact that I'm cursed
With the given gift of anointing so only the truth can be dispersed
[Hook:]
It disappoints that conjoint twins are more individuals than most
So I hunt the industry as a phantom until all my words become ghost
Celestial clockwork is an elixir
Simplifying in obscure picture
So sip the defiled mixture
Concocted by purity's twisted sister [x2]

Now the trees are more beautiful on this side of the mountain
Plush springs run in abundance I drink direct from the fountain
But the dream was opaque the stream was perfectly clear
That an acute disorder of paradise would exist if I die here
So lie down your pitch forks and raise your pins to the clouds
Till they're struck twice by lightning sparking styles to move crowds
Fish in the pond can't understand the concept of dry land
So they swim aimlessly unbeknown to the purpose of which I stand
Don't ask a question, if you don't want the answer given
Time is an illustrious liquor if the candle ceases to flicker
Driven to a life of constant death no choice but one
Children rise from the shine hide in the shade to evade the rays of the sun
Glaciers become oceans and boulders become bevels
Icons become gods and the birth of a spawn is the birth of a devil
Individual once realised is the birth of a rebel
When I've dug my own depth in your faith rest in a shovel
The pedestal is crowed over bearing with trinkets a silver lined sink
Which drown me in sounds of de-evolution and if it's not your calling to be enlaced with the evolving of hip-hop
Then stop is the inevitable solution
[Sample:]
I'll work harder, Amy I'll work harder
I promise I'll be better
Better isn't good enough
I don't think you'll ever be good enough
You don't have it
I know it's a hard thing to hear
And it's not a pleasant thing to say
But it's the truth
And I'm saving you a lot of time and pain by saying it to you now
I don't want to be the best"

The rose bottle, role model, blow hustler, gun buster
16 crusher, your flow need brush-up
I'm here to help you (why) my flow is Bellevue
Pound all the way down to dimes I can sell you
Even a line of wet, diamonds around your neck
I snatch that, that's why, I'm a maniac I
Run this crack rap strapped macs in a baby backpack
Strip before I let this bitch get spit

Left Brain is my Lex Luger, bitch I'm Waka Flocka
Over the stove, mixing music in a pot of rasta pasta
Swag me the fuck out, I stash my dirty money at Cassie's house
Put my gold teeth in a vulture's mouth, 120 degrees [?] pistol holster's pouch
Radness of warriors, jewlery store, gory whores
Bloody and lovely, Wolf Gang coyote ugly

Lick off a shot and act ill, parlay then chill
See I paid my dues, now you can't tell me nothing
This is dedicated to the ones who kept fronting
The ones who tried to diss and pose high? Oh no
Just 'cause you had 'lo, see now I got dough

But now I play the mic, that's why the whole world knows me
I'm sort of like a Chevy, heavy when I bumrush
You'd better bring your whole damn crew or get your head crushed
Sucker, 'cause I'ma set it off with one shot
One trigger, one nigga, 'nuff heads drop
Don't even try to play me out, cause static

Must take charge, bomb guard, I'm the man
Bust my plan, it feeds back on my fam
Once I cruise, pay dues, I never lose
When I break on fools, wake up, you don't snooze
Bust a move, I get smooth like Roadie
Kick it like the Four Horsemen, yeah you know me

Weep for yourself, my man
You'll never be what is in your heart
Weep Little Lion Man
You're not as brave as you were at the start
Rate yourself and rake yourself
Take all the courage you have left
And waste it on fixing all the problems
That you made in your own head

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I, my

Tremble for yourself, my man
You know that you have seen this all before
Tremble Little Lion Man
You'll never settle any of your scores
Your grace is wasted in your face
Your boldness stands alone among the wreck
Now learn from your mother
Or else spend your days biting your own neck

But it was not your fault but mine

I really fucked it up this time

The Game Has Changed,Pharrell Williams,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]

I know I disappeared

And popped up in Pérès making chairs with a beard

And those that love me probably thought that it was weird

While the haters was happy

They thought my destiny was cleared

And any artist that you love have veered

Especially when they hated the image that they mirrored



I got a text that said P please get up

So like tron im brightly outlining my shit up
The penthouses, the homes, the cars, the chains

The stones

The admirers, mini me's, and clones

Selling you niggas dreams that are boxes full of foam



In and out of dimensions I walk through walls

Just sayin' you can't put me in a box thas all

No Da Vinci codes or Twilight stubs

Dont take this wrong but I like the taste of blood



Yo



[Verse 2]
So fittin, the sound in my system

Makes me wanna squish them

King kong foot

The beast has awakened

The protools tapin'

My position blatant

You knew I was coming

Trace this you waitin'

Now look up and ask why you've been forsaten



I shall hover

With splendid colors

That alone makes me other
Plus the, return of the jedi

I study how the brooklyn machine works

Thats word to big and his dead eye

I rise to the top like the sun

I rise to the pocket like a gun

I fire drop your body and its done



They like what happened?

We trapped them

Hatred is obliterated when I imagine

Look at you drowning in your lungs, gaspin'

Blood on the dancefloor, he, he Michael Jackson

Bitches should stay home, they do some much comin'

Y'all should stand back cause you do so much frontin'

Take this sunblock you got too much sunnin'

Now lets examine what you thinkin', running

Run too hard you might tear your meniscus

And if you try to run up, youll only get your wig split

This campaign we runnin is vicious

I hate to eat and run but this was delicious"
They Don’t Give A F About Us,2Pac,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: 2Pac]
Y'all ain't never just tripped and pictured
And just looked at the whole situation
‘Cause once you look at it
You know, (really do)

[Hook: 2Pac]
They don't give a fuck about us
They don't give a fuck about us
They don't give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Some say niggas is hard-headed 'cause we love to trip
Equipped with game so we bang with this thuggish shit
I see you tryin' to hide, hopin' that nobody don't notice
You must always remember: you're still a member of the hopeless
See, you're black like me, so you snap like me
When these devils try to plot, trap our young black seeds
Look it, cops are just as crooked as the niggas they chasin'
Lookin' for role models, our father figures is basers
Some say expect Illuminati take my body to sleep
Niggas at the party with they shotties just as rowdy as me
Before I fear computer chips, I gotta deal with brothers flippin'
I don't see no devils bleedin', only black blood drippin'
We can change — what your mouth say?
I'm watchin' niggas work their lives out without pay
Whatever it takes to switch places with the busters on top
I'm bustin' shots, make the world stop
They don't give a fuck about us
[Hook: 2Pac]
Now If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us

[Verse 2: E.D.I. Mean]
It's the morning after and now all the laughter is gone
Time to reflect on what you did, ‘cause they sayin' you wrong
I'm sure you had your reasons, dawg, I don't doubt you
See, the simple fact of the matter is they don't give a fuck about you
Or them five mouths you forced to feed, not includin' yourself
All you want is wealth, they perceive it as greed
So as you loaded up that MAC and continue to bust
Your mind was on paper, thinkin' they don't give a fuck about us

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
I'm seein' it clearer, hatin' the picture in the mirror
They claim we inferior, so why the fuck these devils fear ya?
I'm watchin' my nation die, genocide the cause
Expect a blood bath, the aftermath is y'alls
I told you, last album, we need help 'cause we dyin'
Give us a chance, help us advance, ‘cause we tryin'
Ignored my whole plea, watchin' us in disgust
And then they beg when my guns bust
They don't give a fuck about us
[Hook: 2Pac]
Now If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us

[Verse 4: Kastro]
Now, all the homies got love for me
Down to catch a slug for me
Guaranteed to bleed deeply, now that's love
Shit, nobody else would give a fuck
If I'm tore down, from the floor down, six-feet deep in the cut
What the fuck done went wrong?
How long will I be mourned?
When I'm gone, same song, ain't give a fuck all along
And who am I to blame 'em?
Just do or die through the rainin'
Since they don't give a fuck, I don't; feel what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 5: Kadafi]
Now, thug niggas die but multiply in doubles
Wrapped in plastic or closed casket for our troubles
Pressed in times, we busted, like bubbles
With the police, this nation's peace sent here to run you
Now look at what this crooked world has come to
I grew up on the other side of perfect, a life of hurtin'
Man, I still hustle, so I'm dyin' certain
So why spent your time poor and workin', I see no reason
So I stay ballin' season to season
Why you stuck thinkin' that they give a fuck?
[Verse 6: Napoleon]
You tell me my world is in peace, but nigga, you're lyin'
‘Cause half of my niggas long gone
Buried in the dirt just for tryin'
Sometime I think my block is dyin' and that is awful
To wake up to another day, shit ain't changed that's awful
I wake up sweatin', dreamin', coughin'
Seein' me upside down backwards head twisted
While I'm layin' in the coffin
The shit comes around so often; so tell me somethin'
Before I take it out on the world, and get to dumpin'
Nigga, I'd be soft if I ain't go through the struggle
I'm doin' the same thing you did at my age, and that's hustlin'
On the edge of straight bustin'
Well, since you don't give a fuck, I be frontin'
I'ma drink my Hennessy like it ain't nothin'

[Hook: 2Pac]
If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
They don't gives a fuck about us
But while I'm kickin' rhymes
Kick it to they children's minds
Now they give a fuck about us
They wanna see us die
They kick us every time we try
‘Cause they don't give a fuck about us
So while I'm gettin' high
I'm watchin' as the world goes by
‘Cause they don't give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
They don't gives a fuck about us
But while I'm kickin' rhymes
Kick it to they children's minds
Now they give a fuck about us
They wanna see us die
They kick us every time we try
‘Cause they don't give a fuck about us
So while I'm gettin' high
I'm watchin' as the world goes by
‘Cause they don't give a fuck about us

I was probably on Molly the day you saw me
In Little Bricks gettin' piffed, grinnin' and shit
Cheesin' like dip that come with your chips
This bitch I was with wanted a clip
Running and shit, just spent a hundred and six
On sniff straight from the dip
And this a fifth trip
The whole strip know what I came to get
It's just how much and who got it
Dimes and nick's, gp twenties with blue caps
Pretty rock bottles of crack
Two for five, five for twenty, buy four, change back
She bought a bundle for her uncle that
Nods, scratches, and mumbles at her
She treated me good for some good weed
Just happy, runnin' with rappers
After she copped, back to the spot, I did me
And she did her, yes sir, and then she did me
Swallowed my gunk, gave me money for the blunt
Stood out front, lookin' like the first of the month
Yet I came, but I kept ma's change
She wasn't beat
Ran through another magnum family pack and hit the streets
Trickin' without a treat
Is like a chicken without a beak
You could eat, but don't make a difference
Cause all you want is the meat
I'm a man-whore, situation pimp
[Breeze Brewin]
Some girls goin' from former I wanna's
To becoming a bum and
To that never respectable
Hella a receptacle for somethin'
Sleazy little Molly, probably easier than Holly
Harvey maker of skate is coming
Now you gotta take a nut, and hey it's nothing
Hey it's nothing
As long as she get to take a puff and
Has a chaser cousin, Molly ain't for fussin'
But bust it
Really game sloppy yall
See, that dame is Molly Marl
Swimmin bout' how she used too
When she she gettin' abused dude
Maybe Molly plannin'
For something like Molly Shannon
Here she talkin' she a superstar
Be for real
That stupid broad just a ski bunny
Forever that ass too dusted
But best believe honey is ready
For bathroom bussin
Hardly Molly Ringwald on some pretty in pink
Are you kidding me?
Take another image like Molly's chin
Balls a good combination
And now we talkin' a winner
And that's off in the center
Of wild hood conversation
[Aesop Rock]
Molly took the leather and tail and the folded overcoat
Loves me, Loves me, not a toke to the motions of the game of dosey doe
I was in the stomach of the briar patch mystified
Firing on all cylinders
Highly of the miserables
Hazy shit of the ray on highly poisoned vegetables
Molly called the pest control
Said, ""It made me less alone""
That's how the mention go
It's every message pretzeled up, it's telephoned
To special pen the end result
Anyway, Molly, just keep your cabbage in the envelope
And I can show you god and every smoking, broken vestibule
Took me to the catacombs, spread me to the seance
Line and dine the tables with butcher paper and crayons
On some... Fuck shit with a kid it's a all gumshit hellabalu
Lunch and dinner, giddy up into the oven with you
That's Molly fucking with you
That's how the tables turn
She front that hubba hubba she just wanna make you squirm"

These warehouse wages kill the ends introduction
Man, I should've schooled it up when I was younger, should’ve stuck to plan
Always had the dreams of bein' more self-assertive
And my kid's a teenager now he needs the health insurance
So break my body, break break my soul down
Just another zombie walkin' blindly through your ghost town
Pull up to the bar to politic and tap the power
Ain't nobody really all that jolly at your happy hour
But I don't want to go home yet
So I'ma talk to my cigarette and that television set
It doesn't matter what brand or station
Anything that take away from the current situation
No overtime pay, no holiday
Months behind on everything but the lottery
Winter 'round the corner guaranteein' that my car dies
Wifey havin' trouble tryin' to juggle both the part-times
My cup ain't close to filled up
We tryin' to build up so we can have enough
And when I finally get the color won't be nothin' left to paint on
A friend of mine tried to kill himself to the same song

My tax bracket status got her questionin' my manhood
My shorty got caught smokin' weed at a concert
And if I smack him everybody treats me like a monster

And we makin' competition instead of stickin' together
Can't save no nest egg, in fact this nest is rented
In fact that rent is late, wait
The money ain't here, the raise ain't comin'
Just me and my son and that crazy woman
And those bartenders, this whole fuckin' country
Got everybody swallowin' that lunch meat
Well maybe we can speed up the process
Kill me in my thirties in the name of progress
Put me in the dirt and then change the topic
Sometimes seems like the only way to stop it
Contemplate my departure date
Doesn't take a lot to get a lot of us to talk this way
Take a shot at me that's all I'm obligated for
Apparently my only guarantee is a walk away

Yeah, Jugga the Bully in your hemisphere...Continuum...
Hey, yo, it's - it's kind of like this...

I keep it hot like jerked chicken, you jerk your chicken;
If I go platinum, then that's one million burned victims
I learned the system, stepped up, and earned a position;
Now I'm startin' the game, benchwarmers, I'm not concerned wit'em
They fake with booty raps;
I heard somebody say they label
Gets them niggas onstage with Scooby snacks
Where's Shaggy, though? Jugga wrecks songs, you do cameos
MC's run, plus they see-through like pantyhose
I couldn't hide the fact that I'm fat with baggy clothes;
Fatter than fat...Jenny Craig mastered my DATs
I'm the big bastard with gats who fractured your back;
Faster than track: photo finish, capture and snap
You slack, I got stocks, bonds and 401K;
You'll never be raw, unless you do a porno one day
OK, I can't really be touched now, you get it?
Fans got they hands up like they signalling touchdown
Like end zone, but what now?
The willy bruises mics so bad
You'd think my cordless had light skin tones
Or perhaps anemic JuggaKno(???), the bad genius
Spits rhymes so hard you'd think my lines had penises
I stand erect, MC's wake up thinkin'
'What bad dream this is, I demand respect!'
Even comin' off the head like Marie Antoinette
Flows run ridiculous
Enough to make nuns promiscuous
You better call your Moms to come pick you up
And tell her Jugga the Bully done kicked your butt
Nigga what? Hold up, I almost lost my calm;
Fuck it, I'm off the chain like I lost my charm...
Hook:
Folks say they on fire but they false alarms;
JuggaKno off the chain like I lost my charm
I can't even be seen with the Bausch & Lomb;
Skills, nigga, your whole city bought the farm

(Repeat)

Just pass me the blunt, I spit that shit
You couldn'tve thunk;
Puttin' on the hits, you just get put in the trunk
I'm off the chain crunk, you scared to show game;
I push so many wigs back they gave me shares of Rogaine
I'm sayin', we can fire rounds or fire prose;
You tell me, I don't give a fuck like retired hoes
Not the Feds, but I tap jaws like wired phones
Or draft beer...
Get up in your girl like Pap smears
Enough. None of you
Knew me last year, now you want Big Daddy gear
And Jugga Underoos too
It's funny how niggas switch
Since I'm gonna get money now
Dis the Altima for bigger whips
Sisters with thicker hips, bigger tits...
Tequila shots, frequent trips to the reefer spot
And you swear my tracks eat alot, they so fat
Show me the hardest cats
They get popped with they own gat
Don't act up when your spot get blown;
Drop the phone, and look at it - watch your tone
Cock the chrome, (????)
Pancakin' sweet niggas on plates, under syrup
Preferably Aunt Jemima...
Insignificat MC's get the dick, kinda, like their vagina
I'll put you where that can't find ya: Eric Rudolph
I got a Godzilla complex: I tear the roof off
Molotov bomb threat, dumpin' these punchlines;
Your parents even say, 'How the fuck is he unsigned?'
I dunno, I guess y'all got me on that;
My only answer is these A&R's is probably on crack
Actin' like sales sum up skills
But I'm still harder than it is for men
With no knees to run up hills
And I don't have a deal, just mass appeal
And raps that kill...Jugg's up in more cuts than Massengill...

Find something how to write about and white it out
It ain't too many things I ain't seen or done
Cream and guns, I'm feeling like our rap dreams have begun
The scene is upon us, the green is enormous
I'm god's law, you could read me in your tauris
You could call me, when it's a weed shortage
I breez through artists, It's funny and shit, they wanna
Alter a nigga, when my money's legit
I guess they must've thought that I was fucking with Knicks
Shit, they should've caught me when I was bringing bricks in
Right past customs,driving them to chicks in

And young jackers get immortalized forever at twenty-one

More twenty-two's than college, I drop jewels
Fools refuse to use the knowledge

When niggas is dead broke, hoes viewed as objects
Opps, I just contradicted myself, who the fuck am I to teach
I'm afflicted myself, at least I'm rich
You gonna get priced out if you try
Two point seven, I'm iced out in july
Sometimes, taking the right rout, you do right
Chuchu breaking the pipe out, my crew high

I can't do nothing for ya.""
I'm not the nigga to depend on
Because before I let you eat, I'm gonna have to put my friends on
I might rush you through the crowd, and write ten songs
Or air it out, I'm just trying to see the endzone
Or you can kind of say, I'm kind of like the goal post
I'm always up-right with it when I hold toast
Mr. Gold Coast, rocking a chain
I'm hot like flame, with no block to claim
Em know me, and Jin knows of me
One in a million like the great ten Moseley
Kan' Know me, Kanye Knows me

To all my underground niggas that I started with
You know the battle cat, I'll show you who the artist is
He grew up claiming BZT
When Rio was gettin bone-taste from Eazy-E
So nigga please, let me be me
Somewhere between fifty and BDP, lies me

At night I hear the shots ring, so I'm a light sleeper

While satanic man now hang in his dorm
I swing on you fake radio personalities
Who boost ya ratings with hypes behind casualties
And fire shots with low-pressure water gun play
But instantly slap ya five like it's Palm Sunday

And built it to a complex network of communications

I screen every vehicle from enemy observation
Swarming unpredictably, we spread terror
Increase the fog significantly, change the era
Check my wind pattern, it's heading west
Success is freedom but failure can mean death
Humans sweat and aim shovels, dig up the debris and rubble
Permanent damage caused by the W
Now who cowardlessly urge you to merge through
And think the workers will serve you?
The sonic marvel who just dropped the next novel
Worldwide, rapidly marred in marble
It's a countless amount of emcees I saved
And them same niggas wanna squander those gifts I gave
[Hook: RES sample]
Scratch underneath the surface, where does your purpose lie?
It seems our will is worthless, like we're pawns beneath the sky
Fate's erased by reason and passion's just a whim
Feel empty so I breath in, keep myself from giving in

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
Love and hatred, moments most sacred
Both species, they lay naked in the tombs of oasis
Think back on niggas I ate with, spent the day with
Guns we played with, niggas I relate with
We broke bread, I heard through a vine niggas worked for the Fed
Sent out secretly to take my head
I laid back and meditate to the words they said
Skipped town for a month and grew some dreads
Had a friend tell my family I was dead
Returned at the last fall of the autumn leaf
Operate the plan accordingly in case the Feds are recording me
Sign all documents using forgery cause just a mere thought of me
I'm like Solomon, spoke bluntly, told the world, ""I'm black and comely""
Howls from the grave haunt me, the smell of death's upon me
I dwell in the Hills like Gandhi
Been in the presence of mad peasants and old kings
Who sold everything on a quest for God's Divine
Slept in caves to get a clear mind
Who prayed three times, when the Moon lit and when the Sun rise
I met dwellers in the desert, talked to shepherds
Been in the mouth of many leopards
Felt the death kiss of Satan's mistress
Walk through vacant districts
Before religions I studied pagan scriptures
True philosophers and physicians on the cure missions
Who harden their hearts toward the weak, sick and inflicted
Candles lit, gamble with a bitch
Who made me love her when I touch her
Soft paws hide claws
Bees with sweet honey in they mouth
Have bitter stingers at they tail
Walk through the chambers of death, take a hole onto Hell
Embracing her was like embracing the third rail
[Hook: RES sample]
Scratch underneath the surface, where does your purpose lie?
It seems our will is worthless, like we're pawns beneath the sky
Fate's erased by reason and passion's just a whim
Feel empty so I breath in, keep myself from giving in

[Verse 1: Fatlip]
I must admit on some occasions
I went out like a punk and a chump
Or a sucka or something to that effect
Respect I used to never get
Cause all I got was upset
When niggas used to be like
(""What's up, fool?! Nigga, what's up?!"")
And tried to sweat a nigga like the Lip
For no reason at all I can recall niggas throwing Cs in my face
Down the hall I'm kickin' it in the back of the school eating chicken at three
Wondering, ""Why is everybody always pickin' on me?
I tried to talk and tell them, chill, I did nothin' to deserve this
But when it didn't work, I wasn't scared, just real nervous and unprepared
To deal with scrappin' no doubt
My pappy never told me how to knock a nigga out
But now in '95 I must survive as a man on my own
Fuck around with Fatlip, yes, ya get blown
I'm not tryin' to show, no macho is shown
But when it's on, if it's on, then it's on

One, two... so listen here...
There comes a time in every man's life
When he's gotta handle shit up on his own
Can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze
Please, they got problems of their own
Down for the count on seven chickenshits don't get to heaven
Til they faced these fears in these fear zones
Used to get jacked back up in high school, I played it cool
Just so some real shit won't get full blown bein' where I'm from
They let the smoke come quicker than an evil redneck
Could lynch a helpless colored figure and
As a victim I invented low-key
Till the keyhole itself got lower than me
So I stood up and let my free form form free
Said I'm gonna get some before they knockin' out me
I don't sweat it, I let the bullshit blow in the breeze
In other words, just debris

It's 1995
And now that I'm older, stress weighs on my shoulders
Heavy as boulders, but I told y'all
Until the day that I die I still
Will be a soldier and that's all I told ya
And that's all I showed ya
And that's all I sold ya
And all this calamity is rippin' my sanity
Can it be (that I'm a celebrity
Who's on the brink of insanity?)
Now don't be wishin' of switchin' any positions with me
Cause when you in my position, it ain't never easy
To do any type of maintainin'
Cause all this gamin' and famin' from entertainin'

Oh, what a feeling
The champagne is spilling
All this dirty money got me bathing in millions
Came out unscathed from the days of my dealing
The driver of that car wasn't made for a ceiling
Still up on my nino
Smelling like a kilo
But I'm downy fresh soft white like my Pinot
Feeling myself so if he know like we know
Cross that line and get shot like a free throw
Rather be on fire at the tables out in Vegas
Under bright lights
Middle finger to you haters
In a perfect world
Just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I'm feeling myself

More than my winnings
We can share opinions
Like baby steps
We can share beginnings
Walk before you run but she so independent
And I could see us fly
The sky is the limit
We so real
Got my own quarter mill
Counting money on the bed
Watching Deal Or No Deal

To every living kingpin smart enough to delegate their work to their wing
Man, keep a bad bitch on the arm of my bling and play my cards right
Now I'm looking at a dream hand
Yes, got you looking at my poker face
No joker see it
You can call me smoking ace

You know what I'm saying, you got these wack emcees out here, you
Know what I'm saying, they do three days in the county, you know what
I'm saying, and come home and write a rhyme about doin' bids, you know
What I'm saying, shankin', shankin' people, doin' time, they don't know
Nothing 'bout time. Man, I got people locked down, you know what I'm saying

[Verse 1: One Man Army]
We was handcuffed, in the back of the bus, forty of us
The road it was rough, plus nobody I could trust (trust)
Headed upstate, no chance for escape
Barbed wire and guards and the gun tower secured the gate
My uncle's fate, was life without parole
Thank God I was blessed with an out date
I can't wait, but I got to
You probably wouldn't have did what I did to catch a bid, but I'm not you
I got a crew still on the street, they don't write me letters
No time to visit a brotha, or bother to send me cheddar
Never did I sweat it, I know they got a life to live
My man J, had a wife and kid
And these are the consequences, my actions committed
Some cats that I used to visit, now I live with
Along with swillas, killas, drug dealas, some rich brothas
Crackheads, con artists, child molesters, dick suckers
All types of individuals
Sorta like a melting pot for criminals
The system is designed to stock it plentiful
This old cat from the hood
Told me, ""Out of every bad situation comes some good""
Its understood
Prison ain't good for my health
Lookin' in the mirror, introducing me to myself
I studied my thoughts, my ways, the routes I took
Though I read daily, it ain't all about the books
Its all about the lessons you learn, through your experience
Applying it in a positive way, period
All praise due to Allah, I used to scheme
'Til he showed me the straight way, Sirat al-Mustaqim
Now I'm on the V-I, telling Moms about Islam
She called me a blasphemous fool, I stayed calm
The world wasn't ready for the changes I made
They was waitin' for the nigga I was in twelfth grade
Everyday, the same old thing, I walked the yard
Set up in the chow hall, with Abdul Rahim
Cats waitin' in infirmary lines, for they medicines
Moorish Americans, walk around, with circle sevens
And older heads playin' horseshoes, sometimes chess
Trippin' when I first seen a faggot with breasts
In the shower with a cat, gettin' hit from the back
White dudes, on basketball courts, kickin' hacky-sacks
Board games, card games--face it
Everybody, time on they hands--most of it wasted
Anything to make the time fly, soon as possible
Some cats used to sleep all day, that's unacceptable
Heads getting cracked over unpaid debts
Either a shank or a lock in a sock would do the trick
Correction officers, devil's advocate
And when its time to go home, parole boards wasn't havin' it
Life was hell every day, the devil's tryin' me
But I paid my debt, to society
And after twenty-seven months, of my life, I'll tell you one thing
I know why the caged bird sings
Yo, yo, yo, yo
In jail, without the bail (repeat)

You know what I'm sayin', this goes out to all the caged birds
Everybody who know why the caged bird sings, you know what I'm sayin'

Here's that other shit that y'all ain't discovered yet
Yes, I'm running it, like the government
Hint, hint, Eric B. nominated me for President
And my pockets is holding treasury, every cent
These styles is unknown truth
Like where Clark Kent goes when Superman steps out the phone booth
Up, up and away goes the tape and show state
My mind and mouth should have came with a cape
And now Lois Lane wants a date
My fame rate's higher than my pulse, that's false
I'm so damn excited I made the Pointer Sisters silent
Make a pacifist get violent
The rhythm tyrant, Atilla the Hun
Hold mics hostage with a terrorist tongue
In exchange for a handsome sum
Going down like young guns in a blaze of glory before we're done
[Refrain]

[Senim Silla]
Rappers antagonists come to aggravate
Hip-hop herald of life, I actuate
My haikus increasingly broaden your IQs
I assess, so now I'mma test
Through the elimination process
Who can contest, working poetry in progress
Be it world tour or conquest
So I embark on this expedition
In Napoleon tradition I'm a small man with complex expositions
Marvel of exhibitions, can you stand the rain of this edition

[One Be Lo]
If you want to stay in the kitchen, quit bitching
Me and my henchmen, trigger fingers itching
Shoot the gift like Mitch Richmond
New inventions, my intention's
To take hip-hop to new dimensions

So all you Hip-hop heads probably need stitching
Tricky like Samantha Bewitching
MCs be wishing they could stop my flow
There's no prevention

[Sample]
Tilt your head back and look at the Stars

[One Be Lo]
We back on the scene like herpes, stronger than Hercules
Able to rock crowds from nurseries to Universities
My beats and rhymes perfectly configurate like figure-eights
You would think the mic was figure skates
My soul on ice, Tonya Harding couldn't touch it
Pop it in your Benz or your bucket
Walkman's or boombox from the suburbs to Boondocks
From skyscrapers to Green Acres, hear my tunes knock
You name it, we done it
Strike the mic and keep it rolling
Like we bowling three hundred
Three fifteen, sold to the highest bidder
I flow like the Tigris river, I just give you
More reasons to call us your favorite emcees
Like Binary Star riffing rhymes over these compositions
You would do the same if you was in our position
But you ain't, so stop and listen
Platinum sales is not the mission
I seek and destroy my opposition
Including anything that make me not want to listen
Wack Emcees with they weak-ass discussions
So-called producers with they cheap-ass productions
Labels need to chill with they Clark Gable deals
I get down like people in tornado drills
So while you blowed away with the bull-istic soldier
I lay low, waiting for the winds to blow over

Evolution of Man,Binary Star,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Intro
In the beginning man was created. Image perfection
And although he was perfect, still something was missing
He was incomplete, unwhole. Then woman was born
Together the creation of these two souls intertwined
And naturally, the two became one. Completion
When your soulmate is placed at your side
Hold on for dear life no matter the obstacles in your path
Destiny is not temporary and true love will always last
Just as first man evolved, and together you two
Shall fulfill destinies plan and together become one
Completion. The evolution of man

When he's on tour, keep your paws off his pumpkin dumpling
Town village nympho, now it's all his though
The way she got down was far from privileged info
Break up to make up, wake up and smell the indo
Just from how she liked to show her belly button window
Couldn't tell him nothing, 5200, Atari, or Sega
Test tube L's with the lid, Garcia y Vega
His tongue is like a sword that's mighty like the pen
And you ain't seen nothing like The Mighty Quinn
Alrighty then!
Seal the deal with the shaking of a hand
Peoples catching feelings like it's Making of the Band
Villain have your fake man quaking in his Vans
When he do a jam, fans break-dancing in the stands
Chances are you'll lose the battle and the war
Trying to go to shore with just a paddle and an oar
Ooh shucks, you should have known them two schmucks
Would have came through the game with lame ducks

I called DOOM he said meet him on Monsta Island
Where the girls look good and the MCs be whyling
You can catch me in velour suits, styling
With Lady J holding hands with the Baroness
Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes don't got nothing on this

First I'll unleash my rage on the stage
Off the top of the dome, fuck the written page
Then engage in telekinesis thesis

In the ice ages, my mission was to ice sages
In head to head mental combat
Three two one contact
Wheres the motherfuckin' combat?
Intellect slashes and leaves gashes
The rhyme smashes
This one in particular with no catches
After several mismatches
The comp had very few chances
The god advances to medieval times
To jig MC's with lances
In present time our eyes met on a few glances
And threw niggas into deep trances
Blew up R&B and Jojo's dancer
Santa and motherfuckin Prancer
In victory my flow found the answer to cancer

And bubble, society crumble

No survivor, sharp rhymes
Flip and clip the moral fiber
Who's liver, hostile takeover
My maneuver, Hans Gruber
Babylon terrorist, nemesis
Vocal apocalypse
A billion degrees of unbearable
Unescapable, revolution
Due to lack of mental evolution
Rugged solution
Kill like industrial pollution
Melt down mines and stagnate the confusion

All my peoples, all of my peoples
Everything's a-okay (It's all good)
Hey, we've been waitin' way too long
So tell the DJ can play my song (Put it on)
All my peoples, all of my peoples
Everything's a-okay (It's all good, baby)
Hey, we've been waitin' way too long
So tell the DJ can play my song (Put it on)"
The Dragon of Judah,Canibus,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Canibus]
Yeah, The Dragon of Judah
Melatonin Magik producer

Yeah
Mr. Magorium's metaphor emporium
Vanglorious warriors with deep space euporia
The Dragon of Judah executed the Lion from Narnia
I'm still trying to build God's army up
The pedagogy tried to call me a communist
And pacify my audience, sprinkle them with zombie dust
The icosahedron is a prison for a three headed demon, Hip Hop behemoth
Knowledge is needed to argue with the followers of Jesus
Rearranging impossible pieces, my quantum is increasing
I am sleeping in a Posturepedic, deeply breathing
Dreaming a chakra sight-seeing, philosophically speaking
I saw Gandhi weakening from not eating
I saw police brutality beatings
I saw the leaders getting into spaceships and leaving
I tried to search for possible meanings
But I couldn't see the logical reasoning
Said survival of the species, no Macbook no PCs
No electricity, no TV
No emcee battles, no Christmas carols
Just international tablets
Brown produce consumed by sick cattle
Bone thin mammals hooked up to intravenous vaccination panels
Collecting contaminated skin samples
This is not natural, God damn you!
Everybody on the planet don't deserve that, not even the animals
You are completely culpable for everything you're supposed to do
Even if it's not known to you
The weight of the language I spoke to you
The weight of the letters and the words in the rhymes that I wrote for you
Are so so emotional, I don't even know what to do
So I'mma leave the choice up to you
Dragon of Judah
I spit like a supernatural computer
Professor Bis, I'm with the Minister of Intelligence
Hold me down Professor Griff

[Professor Griff]
Minds that produce minds that produce minds like mines

[Canibus]
Now everyone want to talk about conspiracy
You should've took Channel Zero more seriously
Professor Bis got a ghetto Ph.D in Chemistry
Professor Griff taught me how to spit it lyrically
Now I'm part of the Ministry
Put my name on the blacklist
Cause I don't dickride nobody in the industry
Where's the fuckin' empathy? I've been through so much treachery
Most of the best emcees disrespected me and tried to get the best of me
Never tried to rescue me or help me with the recipe
What do they expect from me!?
Stressin' me, questionin' me to address the beef
I rep Hip Hop, Hip Hop don't rep me
I never got a penny off that Beef DVD
You mean all that money went to QD3?
I should have slammed the door in his face
If I was a different nigga, I'da been caught a criminal case
The best word to describe what you do to Hip Hop is 'rape'
Cause you don't care about Hip Hop's fate
You sit around your tables and say grace
Eatin' steak, while you live like kings and treat kings like apes
For Michael Jackson money, and still on the take
Even Tevin Campbell's money, the greed is so great
You probably dance around your mansion, like Cirque Du Soleil
Everything is paid for, you don't have to pro-rate
I ain't hatin', I'm not hatin', I'm just sayin'
You makin' money off the next man's struggle. Why you can't pay him?
They made millions off them Beef DVDs
But didn't pay K-Solo or Eazy E
It's called Blaxploitation
Another one of Canibus' paranoid statements that's why I'm famous
I'm just tryin' to tell niggas how the game is
Beef in Hip Hop is just aimless entertainment
If I shoot you, I'm blameless, but if you shoot me, you famous
Whats a nigga to do? Now ain't that the God damn truth
No matter what Hip Hop always lose!
Wake the fuck up"
Hood Love,"Royce da 5'9""","['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Come on.. (Preme)

It ain't nothing like love from the hood
Ain't no feeling like rolling through knowing you good
Cause you been keeping it real
When niggas see you, they salute you

[Bridge]
Love from the hood
Ain't no feeling like rolling through knowing you good
Cause you been keeping it true
When niggas see you, they salute

[Verse 1]
Royce da 5'9"" give ya ill verses
Ryan Montgomery is the real person
No makeup, that's why you couldn't touch me up
I remember being locked up
This nigga walked up, tryna battle, I went ahead and let 'em finish
Then I told 'em, ""Do that again, I'mma fuck you up""
Now take a journey through a nigga's psyche
The only snitch in my life is the chick tryna split up me and wifey
You think you like me, I'm aight with that
I don't even call my nigga Budden ""Mouse"", it sound too much like a rat
So may your steps be just like your stacks
High, afraid of death, having a life attack
It's I, got the soldiers for the coca price
Your poker face on, I'm a turn your channel to the Poltergeist
My outta town niggas know the business
When you land, I'll come get you, we gon' get it
[Hook]

[Bridge]
It ain't nothing like love from the hood
Ain't no feeling like rolling through and knowing you good
Cause you been keeping it trill
When niggas see you, they salute you

[Verse 2: Bun B]
It ain't nothing like walking your block
One deep on your city streets nigga, no hawk or no Glock
No blades in your mouth or box cutters in socks
Cause real niggas show love and bad bitches on your jock
Every corner got a homie you know well
Even if somebody see a deal, then they won't tell
Your man say he got the goods, so you trying him out
The ice cream truck roll through, you buying 'em out
The youngstas helping out the old folks, with something hard to do
The kids is playing, nobody beefing and it's a barbeque
And every backyard with the old school jams on
Sweet potato pie courtesy of your grandma
Already, everybody's home, nobody on the yard
We drinking and smoking the night away with no regard
Nobody arguing and everything's good
Man it ain't nothing like love from the hood, that's understood
[Hook]

[Bridge]
Come on, it ain't nothing like love from the hood
Ain't no feeling like coming through knowing you good
Cause you be keeping it G
When they see you, they salute you

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
Word, it ain't nothing like, what I do every other night
Pick up the liquor, send the fiends to go get the cups and ice
Sit on that project bench and have some of the funnest nice
We spend that wrong doing making money the summer right
The smell of somebody barbeque got my stomach hype
'tata salad, rice and some chicken, a little something light
A beast with the cards, they always ask me to shuffle twice
Swear that I be cheating, I'm just fucking nice, cut that
Rug rat, niggas that robbed, never tried your boy
Only just me, no security that I employ
I never need to wear iron toy, I ain't naive
I just hang with some killers and I'm their pride and joy
But nah, ain't about that right now
It's about the jokes, weed smoke and the cat fights, meow
It's about them New Year's on the roof, with your gat like bloaw
Outside the booth I'm the truth, give me dap like ""Yaowa"""
Price Tag,Jessie J,['pop'],"[Intro: Jessie J]
Okay, Coconut Man, Moonhead and Pea
You ready?

[Verse 1: Jessie J]
Seems like everybody's got a price
I wonder how they sleep at night
When the sale comes first and the truth comes second
Just stop for a minute and smile
Why is everybody so serious?
Acting so damn mysterious
Got shades on your eyes
And your heels so high that you can't even have a good time

[Pre-Chorus: Jessie J]
Everybody look to their left
Everybody look to their right
Can you feel that? Yeah
We're paying with love tonight

[Chorus: Jessie J]
It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the, uh, cha-ching, cha-ching
Ain't about the, yeah, ba-bling, ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
[Verse 2: Jessie J]
Okay
We need to take it back in time
When music made us all unite
And it wasn't low blows and video hoes
Am I the only one getting tired?
Why is everybody so obsessed?
Money can't buy us happiness
Can we all slow down and enjoy right now?
Guarantee we'll be feeling alright

Everybody look to their left (To their left)

Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
[Verse 3: B.o.B]
Yeah, yeah, well, keep the price tag and take the cash back
Just give me six strings (Six strings) and a half-stack (Half stack)
And you can, can keep the cars, leave me the garage
And all I, yes, all I need are keys and guitars
And guess what? In thirty seconds, I'm leaving to Mars
Yeah, we leaping across these undefeatable odds
It's like this, man, you can't put a price on a life
We do this for the love, so we fight and sacrifice every night
So we ain't gon' stumble and fall, never
Waiting to see this in the sign of defeat, uh-uh
So we gon' keep everyone moving their feet
So bring back the beat and then everyone sing
It's not about the money

It's not about the money, money, money

5 Star Generals,"Shabaam Sahdeeq, King Skam, Kwest Tha Madd Lad, A.L. & Eminem","['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Shabaam Shadeeq]
Of course, I rap 'til I'm hoarse
Add the sauce to them jive turkey MC's
Say what you like, I toss
Your theory, when you hear me like the guts of a dutch
Snap caught you in the act, like Vivitar AF
2-5-5 Autofocus, clear vision
Precision mics for people of all types
Call the calvary, mic brutality
Switch the pitch gradually
Aqua, turn-table knocka, fresh like Binaca
Jot the thoughts in my chronicles, remarkable styles
Made an exit to spark mine
Nuclear physics, mechanicals and phat rhymes
They know the time, like a sundial, I'm X-File

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Went to Bible class with a gun, blasted a nun
Fuck Hell, Satan sent my ass to the sun
I wasn't born, I was hatched, dumped in the trash
With a note attached sayin', ""Someone please whip this brat's ass!""
I never gave a rat's ass or a flyin' fuck
Drivin' drunk in a fire truck with the siren stuck
Slammin' the brakes, skiddin' out, ‘cause the tires suck
Went to pull you off my dick and got the pliers stuck
You better run, ‘cause I'm probably the only one
Crazy enough to shoot your ass with a knife and stab you with a gun
I like fire, you might see me start it
I'm slightly retarded, I miss my sanity since the night we departed
[Verse 3: Skam]
Yo, Old World Disorder on some outnumber shit
We'd rather go out of control than to be under it
Yo, how you gonna win against us
When we got nothin' to lose?
Must be confused, or prayin' to a God that don't exist
It wouldn't save your Bible-kissin' asses even if he did
We like to twist your mystic
Genetic dead-end, don't got friends
Skam and Shadowman, posting children for depression
Stress in any language, say my name in Spanish
That's ""Chupacabra"", suck the life out of you
There won't be enough of your brain left to fill a teaspoon
We two vanishing men that make the bad things blend
And probably go platinum on the day that the world ends

[Verse 4: A.L.]
When it comes to beef, I gets relief when I kill and breathe
Send a wreathe, get your family ready for the grief
I'll knock your teeth; take your seat, like a thief
Make you change your beliefs
Burn a leaf before you go beneath
Rappers, I kill 'em, down to Hell is where I send 'em
Feelin' my pen is illin' so much I need some penicillin
Jams I'm spillin', ‘cause I'm bound to it
Kicking shit that's solitaire
Your crown I rip, ‘cause rappers, you sound counterfeit
You get a round of clips, if you play hard
You stay scarred thinkin' you're braveheart
You're in a graveyard, one in a mil, son
I'm ill when it comes to skills
Wanna get killed or catch a dum-dum in your grill
Rappers diminishin', in scrimmage
I'm good to the finish, I'll speak in English
While your brothers are speakin' in gibberish
You touch the mic and I'm out to bury your fingers
You want some fame? I'll beat you up in front of Jerry Springer
So pay the price, say they nice, when they play the dice
I'll take your life, slay you twice, before you break your rights
[Verse 5: Kwest Tha Madd Lad]
Cats who rap are feminine
I'm sendin' this without the benefits
Of cinema scents of cinnamon
So submit it in your mental
Since you find it essential to stencil simple sentences
A sentence is simple, you banned from using writin' utensils
Whether Krylon, crayon, pen, or pencil
Observe verse packed with syntax
That causes skin cracks on impact
Send a rap-shot to jaw with a crack and thwack
Send them whack-men back
To the lab to add what most of them lack
I can hand you a manual
To make what I plan to do more tangible
You still wouldn't understand the full concept
It slips through your fingers like sand granules
Scan the land and the blue sea annually
And you will see which animals eat amphibians
From spittin' up that written stuff; it’s all the same
It’s the reason for cyphers prematurely spittin' up
Ironic, phonics show my flow is far from ambionic
To be honest, no hits of chronic in my bionic, I'm beyond it
The texture of my lecture is complex like a professor
Skeptics greet me exceptional when I bless sound receptacles
Much stretchin' through my vestibules
Turns crews to vegetables
They grab my testicles and cup 'em
Fuck 'em, bless 'em—Who? What?

Because mutiny on the Bounty's what we're all about
I'm gonna board your ship and turn it on out
No soft sucker with a parrot on his shoulder
'Cause I'm bad gettin' bolder - cold getting colder
Terrorizing suckers on the seven seas
And if you've got beef - you'll get capped in the knees
We got sixteen men on a dead man's chest
And I shot those suckers, and I'll shoot the rest

Most illingest b-boy - I got that feeling
'Cause I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'

Shhh-Snatching gold chains, nicking pieces of eight
I got your money and your honey and the fly name plate
We got wenches on the benches - and bitties with titties
Housing all girlies from city to city
One for all and all for one
Taking out emcees with a big shotgun
All for one and one for all
Because the Beastie Boys have gone AWOL
Friggin' in the riggin' and cuttin' your throat
Big biting suckers gettin' thrown in the moat
We got maidens and wenches - man, they're on the ace
Ah, Captain Bligh is gonna die when we break his face

Never cower, never shower - and I'm always stinking
Yo-ho-ho and a pint of Brass Monkey
And when my girlie shakes her hips, she sure gets funky
Skirt-chasin', free-basin' - killin' every village
We drink and rob and rhyme and pillage

Most illingest b-boy, well, I got that feeling
I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'

I was…
I've been drinking my rum - a def son of a gun
*I fought the law*, and I cold won
Blackbeard's weak - Moby Dick's on the chicks
'Cause I pull out the jammy, and I squeeze off six
My pistol is loaded - I shot Betty Crocker
Deliver Colonel Sanders down to Davey Jones' locker
Rhymin' and stealin' in a drunken state
And I'll be rockin' my rhymes all the way to Hell's gate

Sometimes my mind wanders away from me
I know
I light my dutchy up puff maybe one day I'll fly
Who knows? Who knows? Who knows? (I know)
Who Knows?(I know)

[Verse 1 - Big Sean]
I wish that I could be what I want to
I wish that I would do what I don't do
I need a miracle; I hope it come through
I'm trying to work it out; I need a jumpsuit (damn)
Cause I don' 'bout had me enough of not havin' enough, slackin' and stuff
Mama on the phone not braggin' or nothin'
Cause her son ain't really got shit happenin' much
Saw my bank account like where is all the ""O's"" at?
Hit the club like where is all the hoes at?
Get a little change you gonna see how shit change
You gon' be up in the crib like where is all her clothes at?
And ask your girl she know it easy to say no to a nigga that's broke
But somebody with dough that got a little more?
Shit...I don't know
[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Big Sean]
And I always had drive
Get's where I'm going if I ain't got a ride
And when they ask, ""Do you do what you love?""
I'mma say, ""I do"" if I ain't got a bride
And I always kept Faith like B.I.G
Tryna do it big until my crib on Cribs
Man my girl ain't got to worry about shit
Cause our world is going be the shit
So she can tell her mom I'm a keeper
I am a dreamer, I could of been a king, huh
I'mma put my hands together like an applaud
And look upward, like what up Lord
I know if you try to you can turn these gray skies back to sky blue
Was made for the give and go like a drive-thru
Give us opportunity and see what we do with it

Shoot Me A Fair One,Papoose,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
That's why I punched you in your face you fat motherfucker
Brooklyn
Papoose
Papoose

[Hook]
East coast tell Joe to shoot me a fair one
West coast tell Joe to shoot me a fair one
Down South tell Joe to shoot me a fair one
Beg for mercy it's controversial
When I say shoot Pap, ya'll say a fair one
Shoot Pap (A fair one)
Shoot Pap (A fair one)
Shoot Pap (A fair one)
Shoot Pap (A fair one)
Beg for mercy it's controversial

[Verse 1]
R.I.P. to Stack Bundles, I'm sad you had to go
Instead of you dying it should have been Fat Joe
Spit ridiculous sentences, realerlist, gimmicklist, images, infamous lyricist, and I deliver with emphasis
Scars and blemishes burn em at sizzling temperatures
Spitting this syphilis, ignorant, Joe you sensitive
A dick with impotents, prick with benefits
You quick to forget, remember this
I give head shots at high percentages
I invented this style, so now again at this, call it the genesis
Since you a victim and don't wanna get hit again
Put your hands up to the ceiling, then start surrendering
Killas adrenaline, gotta get rid of the middlemen
Once to the chin, with your mans in them timberlands, trembling
Sending them gremlins, finish em, minimum ten of them
Getting them dividends, spitting with Eminem, Fif and them
Niggas who sit with him, get what they get when I'm giving em
4 fifth in them, whole clip in them, tight gripping, ice picking him, stick it in him and enter like insulin
My answer this make them play instruments in your remembrance
Your mens and them hemraging, injure him over the benjamins
Duke your famine like womens son, Lil Kim and them
Killa was sending them, far from a friend of them
Not feeling him, ladies and gentlemen look how I'm killing him

[Verse 2]
I heard Fat Joe try to say he ain't get snuffed
Somebody put something in his mouth my zippers stuck
His fat fingers cover the mic when he rap
So when he onstage you hear a lot of feedback
Man I hit hard as a dick, believe that
Even Fat Joe was forced to lean back
This ain't Hatton & Floyd, this ain't the Giants vs. the Patriots
Hov & Nas, Beanie Sigel against Jadakiss
More like Obama versus Hillary, nothing
A intelligent black man against a woman
Baby your grandfather you bastard
You Lil Wayne's son, he should claim you in his taxes
Your manager macho is so arrogant and lame
You stupid ass scarecrow, he looking for some brains
Khaled can't DJ, he trash with his hands
All washed up, a rusty ass tin man
The new terror squad is too ugly for a photo
They two bitches, they like dorothy and toto
Punched you dead in your face, now you keep whining
Always act tough but you the cowardly lion
So tell me how you gonna try to front on a god
When you whole team straight off of the wizard of oz
Put em up, put em up, you lookin for some courage
You should'a had Geico Insurance
In Miami they shot your car up, poor little bizitch
I guess now you need the Geico Lizard
And you got robbed for you TS chain
You tried to buy it back, ain't that some BS man
He had your chain on the internet, yea I remember it
You was calling and begging, we heard the voice massages
When Remy Ma got cut, you ain't ride out partner
You went to Western Union and sent her 900 dollars
Talking bout your whole squad got a scar in they face
That means they were facing the person when they got scraped
Analyze where your scars at cousin
Your scars at the back of your neck, so that mean you was running
The jails don't respect you, they know you don't bang
Charlie Rock lost his eye defending your name
You ain't even hold him down, this nigga's a lame
No bails bond, no commissary, this shit is a shame
When the last time you visit somebody on Rikers
Call yourself god and eat pork with non-cipher
You don't look out for [Big] Pun kids, that's bananas
You a girl, your name should be Fat Joanna
You abandoned New York, why your chain say I-95 South instead of I-95 North
Screaming Yadamean and Dade County out your mouth
You ain't repping the South Bronx, you rep Dirty South
You don't talk like no Bronx nigga, you a ho
Shout to all my real Bronx dude, Wassup Mo
There don't call you crack cause you stashed crack
They call you crack cause your clothes young and they show your ass crack
Bitch how much change you got in your purse
Mad cause you got exposed when I lifted your skirt
Caught you with some good blows so your chin must hurt
I was always taught to hit the big ones first
Tried to put his lights out, let the drama get dark
Approaching Papoose I guess he was trying to get chopped
When he got close to me I was trying to depart
That nigga stinked, I wanted to ask him why did he fart
Trying to size me up, what are you some kind of retard
It ain't the size of the man, it's the size of his heart
You speaking in tongues, think he better stop that tongue play
Cause you don't want no gun play
I'm hood, hit your limousine up in a Hyundai
Your dudes can't even buy a sandwich on whole months pay
This niggas a chump slay, he scared to fly
I heard he be shitting on himself on the airplane runway
I just smoked a blunt, I'm hungry
I'm bout to eat this coward up, I got the munchies
Everyday of your life should be Big Pun day
Because before him your everyday was a bum day
And since you the biggest pig in the whole country
I'm a speak pig latin, you fat unkpay, you usspay
You give me a fair one Monday
I'll smack you into next week and whoop you ass on Sunday
Some take beef serious, some play
Homie I'm a hunter, I want pray
Your man wearing them Clark Kent glasses
He ain't never win no fight
So I ran up on him and soon as I sent that right
Turned to Superman on me, tried to get so hyped
I calmed em down, my left hook is kryptonite
When I stoved on you, you were shaking in your Nikes
All in my face, you stepped on my Timbo twice
You mad cause you called me and I spite so nice
So I had to whoop his ass like Kimbo Slice
Listen to your interview, you take so long to get to the point
You talk to the break of dawn
Put some bruises on your chin but they was gone
On youtube cause you had make up on
Rubbing your fat chin, talkin bout you look pretty
Then got the nerve to say you used to be skinny
You pillsbury doughboy, double neck, I've seen it
Sumo looking stup footage and not need it
Walk up one flight of stairs and ready to stop breathing
Squinting your eyes like your high, but not weeding
Keep talking bout that footage but that was irrelevant
Cause everyone can tell that footage was edited
Niggas tried to stunt on Pap
I went in my Cadillac and came back with a baseball bat
They ain't put that on the internet, I wore them out
Show me the video, I'll point them out
I hit him with the bat, I hit him with the bat
I hit him with the bat, I hit him with the bat
I hit him with the bat, that cat ran
They used to call me Papoose but you could call me Batman
You a ho, I'll smack you with my backhand
The beat Pap, you cats can't
Denzel Washington, Will Smith, Fat Joe the rapper
Macaulay Culkin, all of ya'll some good actors
Just take it like a man, you got beat up
Can't fight one on one, you goofy punk
The trey 8, the trey pound, what he want
Come on man, I got more treys then free lunch
Mad cause I got a street buzz
But I ain't the first rapper to snuff you, Cuban Link was
You far from a G, to me you just a joke
Real G's don't cut faces, they cut throats
You walk around with cops, I walk with wolves
I don't like no elephants in my room"

Psychopath, ride a tricycle in a biker’s club
Mike Tyson face tatted, addict like it rough
Hey scatterbrain, don’t get your grey matter punched up
Til you're hunched, tucked, talking like you punch drunk
One love, two maybe if I’m drunk enough
Naked watching three painted ladies do the bump and rub
Mean mugging Jean the Heebs call meshugenah
Booking her in the Catskills like, look at her rap skills
E-book in the backpack, the nerd in the Rat Pack
Jean Martin de Bergerac, you heard of her murder rap
Her murder rep, then learn it, confirm it and burn its audio
Music for your convertible, use it for burning cardio
Don’t use it with burners, they’ll find me in your stereo
And blame me for the murders, lock me up and get me carried off
I know I said murder before murder murder, fuck it, murder
Make it four, insert a learning curve
Mine is so high you get vertigo, assertive girl, infernal glow
Eternally superlative, blindfolded learn to drive
At night up on a girder bridge, hurt her no
Tyler Durden nerve in this, the boys are back
Oh yes the boys in black, the boy’s a {Black Star}, rap star
Jean a rock star, minus the Pharrell and all the cop cars
Rock soft, lock bars with the realest in the spot
Really y’all should get on your knees and pray us for our forgiveness, say

I’m a man of God who asked the Devil for some face time
The Shaitan, you never see him coming cause you're faith blind
The mainline, Bloods is waving flags like K’Naan
The Crips throwing gang signs
The Beast in the street bear they teeth like a canine
Get low like the bassline
Jean and Kwa think alike like great minds
The crown is on my head, what makes you think that you can take mine
They know they’ll never win but still they racist like a hate crime
Run the track like Tyra in Higher Learning
We bleeding gasoline so we keeping the fire burning
We speeding like Valvoline and we speak for a higher purpose
You believe in magazines, I deliver entire sermons
You need some Vaseline cause your shit is dryer than deserts
You never fired a weapon in your life so
Picturing yourself as a gangster the only way that you shooting
My intelligent design is a product of evolution
Psychotic, erotic catch phrases just to get at your girl
Create solutions for a digital world
So baby even when I’m spitting game I’m adding on
Rappers going hard, the G.O.A.T., I got an acronym for Capricorn
Centered And Prepared, Rigorous, Innovative
Captivating, Ordinary, Regular, Nigga just
Growing daily, your chick goin' crazy, yo
Handle her like Chelsea Lately
Rocking the fresh kicks like you felt the baby
We’ll wait til you done being whack
We got every hand up from the front to the back
If you wondering why dudes is dressing funny in rap
They need attention dog, there ain’t no more money in rap
So if you mixing with GarageBand, videos on the Flip cam
I’m a big fan, you got more heart than Bret The Hit Man
But shit damn, it’s the pinnacle, gets no better
I’m boasting, but still stay humble
Never cynical, I’m posting

Been a long time, shouldn’t have left you
Without a dope beat to step to
Say uhh, shouldn’t have left you
Without a dope beat to step to, say
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
C’mon, the word is back

[Verse 1: Trick-Trick]
We've been accused of everything from chest wets to death threats
The best yet and niggas gettin' they neck checked
Best check to protect, Detroit ain't only known
For the best threats, so bet, we got decks
And [?] collect debt and rest the goon squad
We wreck your whole set, we rep the Mid-West
You rappin' niggas get wrong, speak on us on your songs
We sendin' them home, stones thrown and broken bones
Better leave us the fuck alone, keep it runnin' thru niggas
Can't even stomach what the D got comin'
And waitin' until they frontin' and poppin' off at the chops, boy
We poppin' off shots and guaranteein' a spot at the top

I ain't kissin' you on the lips but I'll be glad to shake your hand
Now let's get blew out, let's start some shit tonight
Just let me pick the chick that I'ma leave here with tonight 'fore we get to fightin'
And threw out, this music makes me rowdy
How they gonna play that new Trick-Trick and expect no one to get their shit split?
It's just too wild, and one more shot of Hpnotiq
And I am not in control of my body, I go robotic
And blow a fuse out, homies is like, ""You're startin' to stagger""
And I'm like, ""Nah that's just my swagger"" and I'm dancin' with this fat girl
And gettin' loose now, I don't wanna fight, I feel like partyin'
'Til this idiot dumps his Bacardi on my cardigan
And knocks my screws out, it never fails, I know I'm goin' to jail
I might as well take the laces out my shoes now

It's Trick and them Goon Squad gangstas, you can't get to him
We down for the bang and the brawl but now we killin' 'em
See, ever since we started you might've had to pardon
Our heart is from the largest city, they sayin' that we retarded
And [?] on us, so stop, some of their artists got dropped
You think I'm playin'? Then bring it, come on let's see what you got
We make the club go bang *gunshot*, you got that light noise
See, ain't nobody fuckin' with this nigga and this white boy
Done been through the realest and the pros, treated their best like hoes
We put the thugs on and make 'em beat up out of they clothes
We don't give a fuck about nothin' you used to do
Your record is equivalent to a high school musical
No blamin' Jimmy Lovine, Paul or Dre
Blame me for everything I say, 'cause I got him nigga

Niggas on the sneak tip I see you clearly through these Ray-Bans
Wait, now my erections go ""pshh"" down the necks of hoes
Who next to go? The flexible bisexual, I’m thinkin’ so
What’s perplexin’, though, is that this adolescent's flow
Is hotter than a motherfuckin’ summer spent in Mexico
Cop me a mic, check and go, prepare for domination
I got more flavors than a calm doctor has patients
Cut to the race, I’ll come in first place
Respect me or catch a Nike SB to the face
Now, I whooped so many niggas that they callin’ me racist
I annihilate them, my flows amazing as grace is
Ask them motherfuckers locked up in my basement
I won’t give a shit, fuck, once your face hit’s the pavement
A hater only flatters me

Nobody passes me, Fantastic 3 plus 1
Leave catastrophes wherever we run, umm

We got money to make, and we don't trust anybody, anybody
Said we don't trust anybody, anybody

I said high school, 11th grade, CDs in my back pack
Who ever needed that, they got it, next day they come back, they on it
Most these chickens actin' on it, lovin' how I'm tappin' on it
Niggas hit me up, yeah they lovin' how I'm rappin' on it
Said I will attack a track, and this gone need a rappin' lawyer
Charged before assault, look at all this shit I bought
I'm always tryna floss, and when I get I'mma do it right
Straight shinin' on them lames, from the mornin' to the night
From the mornin' to the night, I take the air, takin' flight
Yeah that's that LA shit, young guys on they playlist
Jordans and the gold chain, Illmatic bumpin'
Nas did it first and now I'm 'bout to tell 'em somethin'

Hey girl, what's your name? Do you wanna suck a dick?
Who am I? Wolf Haley, yeah I'm known for punchin' bitches
In the fuckin' brain, do wanna give me some?
No you don't? Why you won't? Oh, you're a fuckin' nun
Didn't mean to offend, oh, you're a lesbian
So I'm guessin' you don't really like to put your trust in men?
Who do I trust? Um, heroine addicts and
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, yeah I can count on them
Who is him? Signed proof in a suit
Preme' six panel cap with the green brim
It's box logo this, box logo that
Usually a caucausian, big swallow on the cack, oh snap

Turn into some neck, gettin' snapped up properly

Wing$,Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I was seven years old when I got my first pair
And I stepped outside, and I was like ""Momma
This air bubble right here, it's gonna make me fly""
I hit that court, and when I jumped
I jumped, I swear I got so high
""I touched the net! Mom, I touched the net!
This is the best day of my life""
Air Max's were next, that air bubble, that mesh
The box, the smell, the stuffing, the tread
At school, I was so cool, I knew that I couldn't crease 'em
My friends couldn't afford 'em, four stripes on their Adidas
On the court, I wasn't the best, but my kicks were like the pros, yo
Stick out my tongue so everyone could see that logo
Nike Air Flight, book bag was so dope
And then my friend Carlos's brother got murdered for his Fours
Whoa

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
See he just wanted a jump shot
But they wanted his Starter coat, though
Didn't wanna get caught from Genesee Park to Othello
You'd get clowned for those Pro Wings, with the velcro, those were not tight
I was tryna fly, without leaving the ground
'Cause I wanted to be like Mike, right, wanted to be him
I wanted to be that guy, I wanted to touch the rim
I wanted to be cool, and I wanted to fit in
I wanted what he had, America, it begins
[Hook: Children Choir]
I wanna fly, can you take me far away?
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high, I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Just stitch my wings and pull the strings
I bought these dreams that all fall down

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We want what we can't have
The commodity makes us want it
So expensive, damn, I just got to flaunt it
Got to show 'em
So exclusive, this is that new shit
A hundred dollars for a pair of shoes, I would never hoop in
Look at me, look at me, I'm a cool kid
I'm an individual, yeah, but I'm part of a movement
My movement told me ""Be a consumer""
And I consumed it
They told me to just do it
I listened to what that swoosh said

[Verse 4: Macklemore]
Look at what that swoosh did
See it consumed my thoughts
""Are you stupid? Don’t crease 'em! Just leave 'em in that box!""
Strangled by these laces, laces I can barely talk
That's my air bubble and I'm lost, if it pops
We are what we wear, we wear what we are
But see I look inside the mirror and think Phil Knight tricked us all
Will I stand for change, or stay in my box?
These Nikes help me define me
But I'm trying to take mine off
[Hook: Children Choir]
I wanna fly, can you take me far away?
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high, I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Just stitch my wings and pull the strings
I bought these dreams that all fall down

[Outro: Macklemore]
They started out with what I wear to school
That first day
Like these are what make you cool
And this pair, this would be my parachute
So much more than just a pair of shoes
Nah, this is what I am
What I wore, this is the source of my youth
This dream that they sold to you
For a hundred dollars and some change
Consumption is in the veins
And now I see it's just another pair of shoes"
Express Yourself,N.W.A,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Dr. Dre & Ice Cube]
Yo, man, it's a lot of brothers out there flakin' and perpetratin' but scared to kick reality
Man, you've been doin' all this dope producing, you ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is
So what you want me to do? (Express yourself)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I'm expressing with my full capabilities
And now I'm living in correctional facilities
Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight, meditate like a Buddhist
I'm dropping flavor, my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube, because he says it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat and that'll make you think
Some suckers just tickle me pink
To my stomach, cause they don't flow like this one
You know what? I won't hesitate to dis one
Or two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this
Some drop science, well I'm dropping English
Even if Yella makes it a cappella
I still express, yo I don't smoke weed or sess
Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic don't manage nothing
But making a sucker and you equal, don't be another sequel
[Chorus]
Express yourself (Ah, ah, ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah)
Express yourself (Smoke, smoke)
Come on and do it (Yeah, kick it over here)
Express yourself (Do it, do it, [?])
Express yourself
Come on and do it

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Now, getting back to the PG
That's program, and it's easy
Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow
Expressing ain't their subject because they like to follow
The words, the style, the trend, the records I spin
Again and again and again, yo, you on the other end
Watch a brother saying dope rhymes with no help
There's no fessing and guessing while I'm expressing myself
It's crazy to see people be
What society wants them to be, but not me
Ruthless is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes that fail to be original
Or they kill where the hip-hop starts
Forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts
Some musicians cuss at home
But scared to use profanity when up on the microphone
Yeah, they want reality but you won't hear none
They rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs and take a stand
But after the show they go looking for the dopeman
Or they ban my group from the radio, hear N.W.A and say ""Hell no!""
But you know it ain't all about wealth as long as you make a note to...
[Chorus]
Express yourself (Yeah, yeah, yeah, [?])
Express yourself
Come on and do it (Yeah, yeah, do it)
Express yourself (Dr. Dre, Dr. Dre in full effect and N.W.A)
Express yourself
Come on and do it
Express yourself

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
From the heart cause if you wanna start to move up the chart
Then expression is a big part of it
You ain't efficient when you flow
You ain't swift, moving like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis
There's a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson, all of 'em expression
And if you start fessing, I got a Smith and Wesson for you
I might ignore your record because it has no bottom
I get loose in the summer, winter, spring and autumn
It's Dre on the mic, getting physical
Doing the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob
Yes, I'm macabre but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growing, just like a fetus
Or a tumor but here's the rumor
Dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good
When I start expressing myself, Yella slam it
Cause If I stay funky like this, I'm doing damage
Or I'mma be too hyped and need a straight jacket
I got knowledge and other suckers lack it
So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic
Ask what it's like, it's like we getting hype tonight
Cause if I strike, it ain't for your good health
But I won't strike if you just
[Outro]
Express yourself (Yeah, yeah, this record's almost over, almost over, gotta get hyped up)
Express yourself (Do it, do it)
Come on and do it (Do it, do it, do it)
Express yourself (Compton's full of fakes, Compton's full of fakes, yeah)
Express yourself
Come on and do it (Do it, do it, do it)
Express yourself
Come on and do it (That's what she said, what she said)
Come on and do it
Come on and do it"
The Drop,Viktor Vaughn,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Victor, a stranger to see you
Who that? Who that, who that?

[Verse: Viktor Vaughn]
If I'm not working or putting work in
I'm either wheeling and dealing, or probably jerkin my—
Yep—listening to nothing, taking no suggestions
Or destructive criticisms, that can't improve on perfection
Rock a crowd in sections on a good night, the hoes fight
Always get the dough first then everything else goes right
At least that's what they say and who the fuck is they?
Make a hick say ""what the hey?"" brought that chick from sick bay
Ensign, he shoulda asked his upperclassmen
Before he bust blast em, never trust no Cardassians
Captain's log supplemental
The Klingons are now aboard the Enterprise rental vessal
On my cue, photon torpedo
Oh and if I'm not on the block with Jorgito
And so on for the street though, smoke a pound of leek though
I'm jokin on the fact that hip-hop has gone freakshow
Don't let the drama get you
In the only genre of music where the fans shoot the messenger
Bitch niggas talk behind your back like a catcher
Either M-Y-O-B or B-Y-O-stretcher
In that order: man, woman, son, daughter
The beat sound like they underwater, make it fun to slaughter
Even if you hear some wack shit you never give a chance
Some shit sound like all you could do off it is river-dance
It's not a hobby, don't be sloppy
Doing deals with these labels is likened to a botched robbery
Nobody supposed to get bodied, golly!
This shit is like a folly 'bout to cold flip, probably
It's not me, he got ill spills knot in Brooknam
Where even though kids kill they still chill and look calm
While working on new developments for the book bomb
In one bad experiment, it blew and took a hooker arm (""Arm and leg"")
BOW! look mom, no hand
Studied black magic for years out in no man's land
It's like a barbecue, all-swine cookout
To fuck up they plans like a blind man lookout
Cram to overstand it, peep it and absorb it
The same way he keep all the planets in they proper orbit
Norbit, y'all better off going corporate
Nobody wanna hear that bullshit it's too morbid
There's no prints, he hold the mic with a mic glove
And rolls dolo from state to state like Ike Love
Like on top of the world loser keep it gully
Rap creeps seem they got too much juice in they belly
It's why they brung V he still hungry
And spit something thick on the mic like a lungy
Mind ya daughter she on line for the water
To get lucky like when she find a quarter kinda sorta
Remember me God, clean timbs with emery board?
He only came to save the game like a memory card
Ooh shrewd, a lot of crews is too rude
And it's way too many let's not and say we do dudes
He said 24-7 I be on call
He use his vacation days to watch Babylon fall
Numbskulls.. get to stepping they dumb dull
And how he rep the mic is like the weapon from Krull
Cats be like ""what's wrong with your man black?""
Biohazard suit and Van Grack for the anthrax
Jeez and can't get no peace
Form blazin sword for the police robeast
Cochise, write a rhyme like a book report
And sell it to a rookie you could tell by the hook he bought
You ain't know he sell hooks and choruses?
They couldn't bang the slang if they looked in thesauruses
It's like a friendly game of dodge ball
Oddball God y'all, who played the garage wall
With the Stan Smith's checkerboard lace
And the brand new INF they ain't check the boy waist
You saw his face? so who next to get they neck chopped
Or popped like a Beck's top, respect the drop
It's too much wreck hops
Who next to get they neck chopped
Or popped like a Beck's top, respect the drop
Woopdie-do flows do fifty like a hooptie do
Groupie crews try to figure out from what coop he flew
They out of place, beats sounds like outer space
With no time to waste he was Audi without a trace"
Saliva,Viktor Vaughn,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
You sold me dust
Get him!

[Verse]
Great balls of fire
Guess who just crawled out the muck and mire
That could make you trust a motherfuckin' liar
A real shuck and jiver
Vaughn never been a duck-and-diver
He spit on the mic, yuck, saliva
Hold it like a truck driver hold a CB on a sharp turn
Still clutchin' his chest from the heartburn
What's your handle? I need a Zantac, ahk
And thanks before I blank into anaphylactic shock
Rock or disco, chocolate on a Crisco ho
Cock diesel and still tell a joke like Joe Piscopo
Tell 'em the basics, basically, break the matrix
And just for kicks, make 'em gel like Asics
That's why they actin' standoffish
Eat the beat by hand like canned raw crawfish
Can you please pass the cocktail sauce?
You might as well know, Hell is hot as hell, boss
Tell my hoss, he said broads call me Vaughny
I make sure I throws 'em back if they's too scrawny
Or bony, phony MCs use a stand-in
Leave him hangin' like if I ain't know where his hands been
Hussy, how 'bout we bloody up you just for me?
Bust a knee, then go finish study, a plus degree
True victory, a new sick story
I never met a chick that was too thick for me
Holy Moses, my old earth know me closest
On how I played the back and stayed bent like scoliosis
It's no puzzle, you can ask Doc Zizmor
The slow guzzle got your nizzle crooked like Biz jaw
Drink like a fishy, she wish she was a Pisces
Live since back when twenty-five cents Icees
Used to turn your tongue the color red
Now they want to fill ya full of lead
What the fuck that young fella said?
What, kid? It's Vaughn, the red-blooded
Do yourself a favor or come on, get head-butted
Yoke him if he run, I'll be there in a jiffy, son
With the flame suppressor like off the 151
Quit your bitchin' or get blaow in your babble-box
Punishment for dry snitchin', now eat this Travel Fox
You'll be alright once it pass through your yellow belly
Only thing he said was, ""Can you please pass the jelly?""
Homo say what? Like a promo, play the cut
On the late night, before you touch the mic, get your weight right
A lot of crews like to act like a violent mob
They really need to just shut the fuck up like Silent Bob
Either that or get smoked like hickory
Should squash the beef and go wash their teeth quickly
Know the stee', write a rhyme like a mystery
And sign it on the bottom in calligraphy, ""Your nigga, V"""

V. Vaughn—the travelin' Vaudeville Villain
Who don't give a flyin' fuck who ain't not feelin' him
Watch what ya dealin' him: Ace, king, death card
Strong-arm the wrong man, pardon the left, god
Get money and earn it, that everything-you-touch-turn shit
Got much to learn, kid; write it up, burn shit
Light it up like the Dutch when the hash melt
Only time they see him when they meet him with the cash belt
Ay caramba, now that's my number
One dry summer, as far as I remember
Burnt-out, but gainin' every edgy penny
Then he hit him straight to the head like Reggie Denny
Call him back when you need some more yak, Horshack
Doin' 80 down the Van Wyck on horseback
Your man sick, but he wreck tracks, puto
Get back too, bro, exactamundo
Viktor the director flip a script like Rob Reiner
The way a lotta dudes rhyme their name should be ""knob shiner""
For a buck, they'd likely dance the Jig or do the Hucklebuck
To Vik it's no big deal, they're just a buncha knuckle-fucks
You wonder how well would they hold up in a holding cell
It sorta had the strange makings of a tale told in hell
Like ""Oh well,"" hold tall riches
If the feds is really after them they just kill all the snitches
On borrowed-time rhymes, gassed by the silver screen
They act like their monkey-ass can heal back like Wolverine
Mellow out what y'all bellow out ya yellow mouth
What happened to the typa spit that used to help a fellow out?
No doubt, leave a rapper in a body cast
And wonder what he was doing while we was in a karate class
Snotty ass, it's really like he was a white-belt
Right before he ""night-night"" ask him how the light felt
I wouldn't take their tape if they gave it free
Maybe it's me, baby it's V!
Throw down the key, y'all know how shit be
In the naked city, rappers is so giddy
That's no ditty, Vaughn so witty
The way he take no prisoners and show no pity
It's how son became a big man from a black boy
To name names, a really big fan of Dan Aykroyd
He feel they need to give him his own dance
This his only chance to shoot the gift like a lone glance
Or like a beef scene that leave the oo-ey smokin'
Or between Hokuto Shinken and Nanto Suichō Ken"
Never Dead,Viktor Vaughn,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro]
They will pay
All of mankind shall pay for this

[Verse 1: M. Sayyid]
Curt Strifer, the loon goon with the tunes in his tomb
Hotter than June
Since out a twisted crib into the fumes, kids trip on his broom
Press twills for schills, shag with the half moon
Cab to school, straight to the bathroom
To take a piss then help the teacher
With the creatures that inflated from the ethers
And it's waitin' in the beakers to bite on teen features
The preachers come with sermons and parents pack bleachers
Yo, it's done Mr. Kim, I shrunk 'em down to ticks
Just hit me at noon with $60 and two knicks
I gotta split, yo va, ah Ill kicks
What's the shit, black? yo, how you nukin'?

[Verse 2: Viktor Vaughn]
Reactin' with the core breach spewin', ya darn tootin'
Right after this rec you might expect lootin'
Nasty drop the rhyme like lime then tequilla
Flippin' like Optimus Prime to a ten-wheeler
V set the scheme on his own team like Starscream
Then go hit the bar scene all like 'na mean?'
Go to school every day, except for when he play hookey
That's the days he play bookey
If I don't study I'm a cheat off Peter Parker
Keep a liter of vodka inside my locker
Use it like a book on the Grey Goose scenario
Play you like a stereo hey you, where he go?
I'm bout to blow one of y'all monkeys out the frame
Whoever gypped my locker and took my Donkey Kong Game
Watch, don't even try to put it back so I can find it later
Word to Koch, it's Vaughn against the ninth graders
[Verse 3: M. Sayyid]
Haters, you fuckin' with cats who's heads are sharp as alligators
Pull out the ox cutter, nigga did I mutter or stutter what I uttered
Then check in your little cash flow or give my nigga back his Hasbro
Or catch a stab slow and that's woah
Shorty with the big talk, you gotta go
Swing on the drip to leave scars
Blood spattered on his fat laced Abdul Jabbars
Now we're gettin' chased through school with jars
Principal jumped up with his dick in the mouth of Ms. Mars
Picked up the tele, sweatin' for some squad cars
Cats tried to cut us off by the garage
But V pulled out the nicky yelled ""Life's chance is slim"" like Lionel Richie

[Verse 4: Viktor Vaughn]
There's no finer sound then when you let off a nine round
Before the slug find the ground V be in Chinatown
Uh, give me a slew of m-80's
A carton of those hick chasers, and two of them ladies
It's like the hood black market
Where you get goods from gats to pudding pack chocolate
To your health, we rock Chinese slippers
Me and King Gilizwe and two Guyanese strippers
On the radio, ""Mack the Knife""
I watched him freeze roaches and bring 'em straight back to life
He used a different approach than I ever read
The only thing he ever said was, ""The roach is never dead.""
We studied transfigurations
And different ways to break the trance off the nigga nations
It's even bigger with the Haitians, no time for litigations
[Verse 5: M. Sayyid + Viktor Vaughn]
And that was science for the head, so we did the knowledge and sped to the shed
Mixin' dog bone with egg
It says, ""Add body hair""?
The heart of a hen, a fig, lay it under the bed
Will turn back time' and that's just what we did
Next day walked in the school from the crib
Laughin', yo, limpin' like a cane

Only one of us can ride forever
So you and I can't ride together
Can't live or can't die together

So I skillfully apply the pressure
Won't stop until I'm forever one

Swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing
[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Low like sweet chariot
What I say make my voice deep as berries get
Carry it like a torch
Give birth to rhymes to meet beats and then I'll marry em off
Have a divorce if the track is wack
(Please) My rhymes a rolling stone
Home is where the high hatters at, its on this song
(it on this song) maybe one day it'll settle down
It ain't no good it all better now, come on let it now

[Chorus]
Mood Swing, changing the way we do things
Its a good thing, listen to the whole hood sing
As they go La, La, La, La, La...
Yeah as they go La, La, La, La, La...
No fear no doubt and no worry everything is on time there's no hurry
Mood swinging, swinging, Mood swing, swinging
Mood swinging, swinging, Mood swing, swinging, oooo oo

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
Me and baby in the rental
She talkin gentle hit the hotel to presidential
Sweet... kisses on the temple make her feel special
Light a candle scent got us in this sentimental
MOVE its right wit the light just so I could see
Begin to set the pace for what we gon get into
My fingers is lyrics its back is the instrumental...
Ancient Secrets, Indian, and Oriental
Blackin out doin shit that I can't rap about
Passin out, wakin up, not awake awake enough to take it up and not STOP
Love is a friends never know if we can love again
I said we gotta leave, she asked if she can come again (come again)
I had to meet Asheru at the studio
I'm runnin late, you know I hate to make a nigga wait
But damn baby ""You look good in the summer time
Gimme some of yours, I'm a give you some of mine.""
[Verse 4: Asheru]
Yo Kweli I remember being in the same dilemma
Hip-hop was number one my girl was number one contender
The great pretender wit a whole different agenda
Until I make it big ""Life is one long gig.""
Mood Swing like Ella of Cold Train its classic
Like Soul Train its timeless just like this rhyme is
So all of y'all that wagging they campaign
Grab a hold of that Mood Swing and do the damn thing

[Chorus]
Mood Swing, changing the way we do things
Its a good thing, listen to the whole hood sing
As they go La, La, La, La, La...
Yeah as they go La, La, La, La, La...
Uh You can run to every new thing under the sun
You be a jack of all trades and a master of none
Mood swinging, swinging, Mood swing, swinging
Mood swinging, swinging, Mood swing, swinging

[Verse 5: Asheru]
I'm an outlet
A front of which which you ain't figured out yet
A resource, I pivot your efforts on the right course
It seats ya, doin whatever it takes ta reach ya
All of its in me, no really its in me
A good brother, lovin son, a great lover
I'm a truth seeker, on a quest not a believer
I'm an Emcee for all of the world to see
Yea ya got my word on it, I'll put the Herd on it
That we rep shit, its the least to be expected
Fuck that prep shit, jump on stage like we connected
From the same minds saying the same things at the same time
Back stage rappin like gettin ready for game time
We a family, and ain't nothing goin to change that
For better or worse like somebody prearrange that
The way it is the way it always will be so I can still and still be
Soon come we will witness a shift in consciousness
And black music is one of our greatest accomplishments
(one now) our names will live on this monument
So that our kids can hold up they heads with confidence
That's when our nation will rise and realize that
[Kweli]
Life without knowledge is death in disguise

[Asheru]
The answer to my comprehension is just too complex
One minute from the next, go from happy ta vexed

[Singer]
Mood Swing, yea
See change is good sometimes
Mood Swing, yea
Its time for the essence to rhyme
Its time to Mood Swing
Take it on back

Then put my niggas on it just to say I was considerate
Race to success and Im like where the competition went?
The musics runnin' bitch and it never tore a ligament
Niggas comin up to me like Sean I beg your pardon

Runnin' up to me for they buzz like a barber
And all that weak shit just make mine sound harder

So Ima live life like fuck what you thought

Punk shit, all around, everybody been calling clown
The crawling town, get wicked
Rip this sickness is falling down
Over this basic gay shit, erase it, face it
Wake this hatred and make this place get apeshit!

Lot of us often is blocking this, optimist
Positive, hope for the future's loss of awesomeness

Some speaking that his fate's to be wack when he gets cake
Well, he gets cake and the critics they spit hate

That we can not end wars and bring peace

Caught in the middle of this common evil
I wish the world was a little bit fairer

Fear is the devil's policeman
Fear made good Germans side with Hitler so we can build the war of genocide and havoc was wreaking

Nobody care about the poor and the needy
Too busy sucking up to to the rich and the greedy

But chill

It's been a long time coming, had a long rhyme running
Through my head all morning since the early crack of dawning
Seeing omens as a warning, sticking out like an awning
In places they don't belong, my premonition is strong
This shit don't feel right when bammers know better
But do the opposite they're claiming they're go-getters
But what does profit get but mo' money, mo' problems
We break bread as if we have pockets with no bottoms
Can't be further from the truth like words spit in the booth
Mixed down, packaged and shipped then marketed to the youth
But the real disconnect is when shit goes unchecked
Words become acts and kids lack respect
Society points the finger, artists collect the check
Any attempts to balance things out, we reject
We celebrate death like we know the end is near
I can't tell if it's fear or if we truly don't care
But me, I'm for the living, live the art that I'm giving
Give my heart; that's a given, do my part cause I'm driven
From the start I been hittin' with anti-nonsense
And critics be so quick to label it conscious
OK, you got me, even though it's not me, completely
I see you want to box me neatly
Treat me as if what I'm saying ain't really real

[Verse 2: Asheru]
I wanna see hip-hop expand
I wanna show these little Black boys what it means to be a Black man
I wanna see us take pride in ourselves
And not be so goddamn quick to rely on somebody else
I wanna be able to turn on the TV
And not see caricatures of people that are supposed to be me
I wanna take full advantage of the things that I've made
And maintain multiple ways for me to get paid
I wanna put all my peoples on; who wouldn't?
If you had my head, you would see the roof is in the pudding
I wanna own my own, my master's, my home
My destiny, my peace of mind, my quiet time alone
For once, I wanna see the good guy get rewarded
And the masses afforded opportunities to support it
I'm recording with intentions of showing another side
At the end of the day, I wanna know who's gonna ride
Cause me, I'm for the livin'
Live the art that I'm givin', Give my heart, that's a given, do my part, cause I'm driven
From the start, I've been hitten with anti-whackness
[B-M-I G-A Racist/Races?] is pro-blackness

Struggle all my life to evade the misconceptions
To find a place to live between the negatives and positives
While trying to make money slanging synonyms and homonyms

Cut to the mall copped a brand new pair of Timberlands
Then dipped down a one way trying to scoop up Double K

Let the problems in yor mind become ancient artifacts
Perhaps these raps can help you alleviate
The things that's got yo trippin you watch me demonstrate
First you ignore the nonsense and clear your conscience
Let your pen touch the paper write verbs and consonants

I'm outro, call me if you want to blaze one up

[Camel MC] When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops
Mary Jane is the only thing that makes the pain stop
[Double K] I let the music take over my soul, body and mind
[Thes One] To kick back, relax one time, and you will find
[Camel MC] When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops
Mary Jane is the only thing that makes the pain stop

[Thes One] And kick back, relax one time, and you will find

[Verse 2: Double K]
I try to keep it stress free take every day at a time
Make sure the families in place and let the music unwind
I got plans to take charge like major outlets
Ride around the country chillin in my LA express
On every street corner
The importance of having fun
Empty bottles filled with tobacco don't nobody carry guns
We keep our minds on fun and let the drums do the bangin
On any given day like Mr. Cooper yo we hangin
Under the blue sky, the state laced in smog
Pollute your quarter inch cables with all the sound that we brought
Can't get enough so brother pass another cold one
Feel like a dad at a ball game lampin' with his son
Chuck D yo word up we buggin over time
From the light to the lime original star time
It's the Double Chris One
And Camel brought the ammo so we can shoot
Game like thugs on your sport channel
Take off the do-rag replace it with a thinkin cap
If you didn't know tell the bro he should have known that
We here for one thing and that's to remain
What's the name...name...name...nigga
[Hook]
When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops
Mary Jane is the only thing that makes my pain stop
I let the music take over my soul, body and mind
To kick back relax one time and you goin find
When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops
Mary Jane is the only thing that makes my pain stop
Just let the music take over my soul, body and mind
To kick back relax one time and you will find

[Verse 3: Thes One]
Yo, L.A., hit me one time, make it funky
Double down on my underground sound I'm feelin lucky
For this jackpot I jacks pot to fill in my crates
We lay back chillin and feelin the music relates
We on the to the two hangin with my crew
Bullshittin while we sittin down drinking on some brew
And to the afternoon turns to the moonlight
Funky tracks and nickel sacks freestylin all night
Doin it right knowing with time music make it better
My crew banging two blocks like shots from my Berretta
Snub nose to the hoes who pose I suppose
Honey you gotta understand your mans got flows
And I'm leavin you so by the time I get to Phoenix
Underground ground heads will fiend this musical genius
Transglobal by the books
Like Barnes with noble hooks
Armed with overlooked talented guests so God bless crooks
Who steal loops to keep this shit alive
Something for your troops to sit around and vibe by
From Camel, Double, and Thes, to ease stress
We brought the hip hop so have fun and God bless
[Hook]
When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops
Mary Jane is the only thing that makes the pain stop
I let the music take over my soul, body and mind
To kick back relax one time and you will find
When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops
Mary Jane is the only thing that makes the pain stop
Just let the music take over my soul, body and mind
To kick back relax one time and you gon' find

Pop collars to this
Wear ice to this
Drink crys to this
Yo is there somethin we missed
Pop collars to this
Wear ice to this
Drink crys to this
Is there somethin we missed?
Yeh like my two way
Throw bows and do the shoulder shake
We throwin boes up in here
Do the shoulder shake
Oh shit my two way
Oops my shoulder shake
I'm throwin bows

There was music, enjoying marijuana
It was flown up fresh this morning from the border"

Fall Back/Titty Fat,Viktor Vaughn,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Part I: Fall Back]

[Verse 1]
Emcees fall back
It's Vik' in your ear with the whole ball of wax
Call or fax for the freshest rhyme delivery
Or takeout, for the fake-you-out ballers in the industry
Boss with the Lee jeans, bad man, you know V
They say he's a cross between Adnan Khashoggi
And Sho Kosugi, he said your chain is sure dookie
The piece is like a mystery entity, eugh, spooky
What's its worth? A gun or a knife slice
Catch a bus once or twice or run for your life price
An arm and a leg, the lead is ghetto red hot
Calm 'til we fled the spot or leg arm head shot

[Verse 2]
He on the battlefield with lyrical militants
Know he's feelin' bent when he see little pink elephants
Never forget, re-memorize the elements
Keep the mic sterilized, terrorize with eloquence
And mellow eyelids, tell no lies, kids
These guys ask 'em what's their shelltoe size is
Shields up dum dum, where we come from
We thump it out for fun, and that's no conundrum
Pick a bone goon, it's V with the sicker known show tunes
On a full moon, lick your own wounds
Lighten up the stratosphere, shootin'
Slugs is nameless, aim caressin' Vladimir Putin
His matted hair was too thin to cut into a gumby
Nuttin' to V, he feel his bum knee
It's about to rain, there goes my two-way
Out of range, it's a strange new day, touche
It's all good like down home-cookin'
He left with the crown on his dome and kept bookin'
His men run Crooklyn
Keep 1 in 10 huns hookin', no offence, none tooken
It's more funner than lookin'
The pound of the war drum had your poor son shooken'
Sometimes he feel he need to stop juxin'
Then he say ""NAH"" with a real sly crook grin
Vik's style of rhyme will bug out Joe Sixpack
Slick while the time he dug out yo' chick's back
She wore a thong in her youth
These days she's a bit long in the tooth
Part II: Titty Fat

[Verse]
Just chewin' on the titty fat
Pursuin' the kitty cat, droolin' on her pretty hat
Playing pool and pitty-pat, stay in school
Kiddies, brats, instead of spraying tools and shitty gats
Layin' cool, where they at?
Same jewels as silly rats rulin' with gritty stacks
Coolin' where the cliques be at
It's no time for chitty chat, fool V pity that
Follow your instincts
I told her time and time again not to swallow pink drinks
I guess it's just how the hollow link clinks
V, the fink who made the chink in the mink wink
They say he need a shrink
On the brink to pipe it when her sink made his pinky stink
Instead, he asked her for some paper and some ink
Coulda flipped it longer 'cept the beat was rather rinky-dink
Still workin' out the kinks
Every time he thinks his third eye blinks
It must be in the blood like zinc
Glassy-eyed V put your CD on jinx"
Honest Expression,Binary Star,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Bruce Lee]
""Ultimately, martial art means honestly expressing yourself
I mean it is easy for me to put on a show and be cocky
Or I could show you some really fancy movement
But to express oneself honestly, not lying to oneself
And to express myself honestly
Now that, my friend, is very hard to do.""

Like sands through the hourglass, so are the days of our lives
And for that live moment we thrive
Awakenings, as we make the dead come alive
Rise and walk my son, come into the light
Inside the dark we illuminate mics
Give knowledge to mediocre, the wheel to neanderthal
Filter to the the smog, digital to analog
We steady advancing, rhyme enhancing
Simple minds can't keep up with this

{​Verse 1: Senim Silla}​
Dig - I'ma put it on the table
I ain't a thug nigga and playa, I ain't playful
I'm just Senim Silla, a man without label
Standing on my own two, you're trying to stay stable
Speaking what I know to only what I'm able
I ain't the kind of guy who carry on for dough
The material cat who walk around for show
I'm just your everyday, merry way, joe on the go
While others go with the flow
I ain't never been the one to follow trend, I do my own bit
Can't keep up with the Joneses, I'm on my own shit
I don't care what you drink, what you stress
How you dress, or where you got the link; I ain't impressed
These lames run around like mice in a maze
Trying to get up on cheese, it's just a rat race
One of Shaytan's schemes to make man worship things
Over The Supreme Being, or Astafullah
Should I join the hypocrites?
Or side with the suckers by choice It makes no difference
That y'all product of environment, it's just coincidence
The world's a violent place baby, there ain't no more innocence, or civil men or penitence
Just ignorance cats don't know right from wrong
They mimic shit they see on TV or hear in a song
What that tell you they on? A sucker act up every minute
The righteous live on but the the nigga's are infinite
[Verse 2: One Be Lo]
I ain't hardcore, I don't pack a 9 milli-meter
Most of y'all gangsta rappers ain't hardcore neither
Whoever get mad then I'm talkin' 'bout you
Claim you fear no man but never walk without crew
Where I'm from, your reputation don't mean jack
So what you pack gats and you sell fiend's crack?
You ain't big time
My man, you ain't no different from the next cat in my neighbourhood who did time
Rhyme after rhyme it's the same topic
What make you think you're hardcore cause you was raised in the projects
Broke ass finally got a hundred in your pocket
Now you on the mic spitting money's no object
What you say is bull-crap
If you wasn't with your crew and wasn't drunk off the brew
Would you still pull gats?
You need to stop frontin'
Or you're headed for self destruction
Yeah, today's topic is self-destruction
I ain't talkin' 'bout the KRS-One discussion
I'm talkin' 'bout the one too many ignorant suckers
Lying on the mic to my sisters and brothers
Every time you listen to the radio, all you hear is nonsense
They never play the bomb shit
Everything that glitters ain't gold
And every gold record don't glitter that's for damn sure
[Scratching Voices]
""Y'all need to be cool as shit""
""Time to kick shit from the heart""
""Y'all rambling on, and ain't sayin' nothing""
""Too busy in the limelight, can't rhyme tight""
""I won't dwell on that, I think I'll elevate my mental""
""When I talk, I know I’m talking for Hip Hoppers all around""

[Interlude]
Yo, see cats got confused somewhere man (confused)
About what hip-hop was, you know what I'm sayin'
Or what hip-hop is, (it's business yo) you know it
It's all business
(its big money, know what I'm sayin' that's all these cats about)
You know that's bullshit, right? But dig it though, dig
But if you want to make money yo, I got it broke down though
I got it broke down, (break it down yo)
You got hip-hop, then you got hip-pop
Hip-pop? (hip-pop)
Alright, (but a lot of cats want pop)
Yes, (know what I'm sayin')
It used to be real hip
You got the top 40 version of hip-hop
I still got something else, something else that I wanna get off my chest
What? (know what I'm sayin'?)
[Verse 3: One Be Lo]
How many cats you know speak the ill-legit rhyme after rhyme diligent?
85 percent represent ignorant
Either you innocent or guilty
Some of my favourite emcees fell off
It damn near killed me
Looking at the kids that was true hip-hop
Nowadays, them cats don't even do hip-hop
Rap got 'em brainwashed with cats that don't last
And five minutes of fame, that's when it's a shame
Seeing real emcees trying to imitate rappers
If you ask me they going out ass backwards
Trading in respect to push a fat Lex
Puff rhyming on the remix, what's next?
It hurts so bad I wanna smack 'em
My favourite crew members break up, turn around and join whack ones
This is dedicated to you hip-hop hypocrites
Driving whack songs like you don't give a shit
I ain't got nothing against nobody trying to make a decent living
It ain't the money that's the issue
Only if that's the reason why these cats are making decent music
That's when I got beef with you
And I'ma break it to you like never
Go ahead, call me player hater if it make you feel better
Try to jump my crew if you cats feel froggy
You need to wake up and smell the damn coffee"

I was chillin at the crib about 12 o clock
When Thes Love called up he knew a party we could rock
Sometime around 8 yo we can't be late

[Thes One]
So straight I'll pick you up at seven dig inside ya' crate
And find a fresh plate to rotate to make the b boys get aches
And me and you the super MC's to get the cake

[Double K]
Word up! I called the posse we can all roll out
Cause once we step up in the party, yo we make the ladies shout
People Under the Stairs, yeah, you know we got the clout
Packed up my records, rolled up the blunt

[Thes One]
I grabbed the black book,and tried to call up this stunt
She wasn't home, so I paged her, left the celly on roam
And we out to the night, right on Pico
Rolled down the street, stopped at the red light
[Double K]
Kept on going, made a right on Sierra Bonita
Yo Thes, where's your fake ID? Ya know we need a
Little bit of liquor for the night

[Thes One]
I was born in 1974!

[Double K]
Yeah, right!

[Thes One]
Word! Corona represent just enough to get me screamin
Like them other latin brothers whose intoxicated demon's
Tape bumps lovely, we keep it goin, ain't mine on deck
The backseat complete, goin and goin

[Double K]
Turned up the beats and hopped on the ten
Talkin lot about the pigeons that we bout to see again
Yo I'm tryin to stop drinkin, but nigga pass the cup!
This fool Thes is freestylin, almost passed the exit up

[Thes One]
Because the drinkin and drivin's a guaranteed no no
Cause with the bottle in my hand, it's fuckin up my rhyme flow
I went right, kinda slow, at the bottom of the ramp
Ten car caravan, undisputed champion
[Double K]
Pulled up to the place, had to find a parking space
This ugly bitch was looking at us so I give the gas face

[Thes One]
Hey yo, her friends was butt too but they jocked this big crew
Told the bitch to jump in the jeep, I'll take you to the zoo

[Double K]
Ha ha! Word
Her head was all big
They should've been at the zoo though

Got up to the line (five dollars please!)
Oh we're with the DJ (nope, five dollars please!)
Bitch, we're with the DJ (FIVE DOLLARS PLEASE!)
I'mma have to beat your ass
(alright just let me stamp your hand, get in there!)

I was the first one in and the crew was behind
So I kept on walkin, couldn't waste no time
Bumped into this white guy that I knew
He offered me a brew, I was like fuck it
Took it to the head, now I'm through
So he laughed, rolled another one up
This fool Thes is pushin it, pouring gin in my cup
Now I'm towed back, can't walk worth a shit
He lamp lit the J and I hit that shit
Took about a hundred pulls, at least that's how it felt
Chillin with my boy, at least that's how it felt
Realized I was buggin then I saw Mike's pops
When I decide to spark the beedi and relaxed at the spot
Yo, to the DJ, throw on 2Pac
I walked back in and showed the stamp, felt like I was shot
Oh my God! Saw this brown skinned cutie
With a big booty, titties big as hell, looked like Tootie
Hey girl, how you doin, oh shit I moved back
My nigga Thes is on the mic about to bust another rap
Yo, this fool Thes
Ay man you bout to rap huh
(Hey is that Thes?)
Do it do it!

[Thes One]
Mic Check one two, how do you do, I'm Thes!
The party honored guest cause the crew gets blessed
Never have I stressed, ask my man J Quest
I rock the mic possessed when the beat's compressed
I rotate grills or analogs at best
It's the true B-Boy and that always gets respect
Pass the Corona, keep two in the icechest
Pull a girl like a plug cause I'm finessed
Find me when I seem sexually repressed
I treat em really good til they get obsessed
They actin kinda funny and they get blood tests
If they actin ill I go and take the next best
You MC's be rappin' funny, I'm not impressed
Standin' like products of parental incest
But son, my tape's for sale so I hope you invest
Sunny up on skills, that's what I suggest
If you think you're fresh, you catch a litmus test
Drop some fresh rhymes, that is my request
You got no heart, let me lay you down to rest
I invoke the hip-hop citizen's arrest
My name is.... yo man

[Double K]
Hey that fool done kicked the cord out!

[Thes One]
Plug me back in yo!

[Double K]
Ay, what's up? What's up?
Man, fuck these motherfuckers

The Morning,The Weeknd,"['alternative', 'r&b', 'blues', 'jazz', 'hip hop', 'pop']","[Intro]
I'm fucking gone right now
I'm fucking gone right now
""Listen, listen""

[Verse 1]
From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north
Rockin' with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in'
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
Fast life gripping
Yeah, we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
Get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid
[Chorus]
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work

[Verse 2]
Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Always fucking testing
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Get shit popping
Zombies of the night (Zombies of the night)
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew
Get it in like pockets
Downtown loving
When the moon coming
Only place to find bassheads and hot women
[Chorus]
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work

[Verse 3]
Better slow down
She'll feel it in the morning
Ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning
Too damn raw, ain't no nigga with her rollin'
Ain't no nigga that she holding
Man, her love is too damn foreign
Look at all that money
The money is the motive (The money is the motive)
All that money
The money she be folding (The money she be folding)
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work

[Chorus]
All that money, the money is the motive

See you been running around my mind for some time
And it's the way I feel, for real

[Verse 1]
I'm the one the bad broads report to
So every time we leave the club my whole car full
Buncha bitches in the back; carpool
They all wet, so now I'm riding in the car pool
But I could never take 'em where I live
Gotta be my baby if you laying in the crib
But they all get the hotel presidential
But to make it there swear you gotta have potential
Face like a model, waist like a pencil
Treat my dick like an eating utensil
She said, ""I'm tryna do what you do""
I told her that I do me
She said, ""Well, let me do you""
Plus you know I'm rapping and all

She's in my pockets like she tryna get checked or something
And I'm just trying to hit her back like I left some
Smoke some, drink some, lemme spank some
And I don't mean the time when I say threesome
And bet I her make her walk with a limp

Rock Bathing Ape like a motherfuckin' chimp
And bet I cock tail like a motherfuckin' shrimp

I believe I've survived for a reason to tell my story to touch lives
All the people struggling down there
Storms only come for a while
Then after a while they'll be gone
Blessed, blessed

My father was working for the government as a police man
Few years later a hardy joined a rebel movement that was formed to fight for freedom
I didn't understand the politics behind all this cause I was only a child
After a while I saw the tension rising high between the Christian and the Muslim regime
We lost our possession
My mothers, my mothers mothers suffered depression
And because of this...I was forced to be a war child

I'm a war child
I'm a war child

I believe I've survived for a reason to tell my story to touch lives (touch lives, touch lives, touch lives, touch lives, touch lives, touch lives, touch lives)

I lost my father and mother in this battle
My brothers
All my life ive been hiding in the jungle

Whose there anyone to hear my cry"

Trying to imagine how it might sound

And I don't really care who knows it
Can we afford to be that open with all these emotions
If we were a secret how long could you keep it
Keep it to yourself don't tell nobody else
Something away

After bein' 25 you know just trying to survive in the world
About to have a little boy or baby girl. Who knows?
Anyway just when you start gettin' that little age and experience to you start thinking about stuff, trying to make the right moves
So bust it out this is what I was thinkin' check it

[Verse 1: Common]
Yo the education of the Lon chicka Lonnie Lynn
Began, began with time
Being my bloodline is one with the divine
In time brother, you will discover the light
Some say that God is Black and the devil's White
Well, the devil is wrong and God is what's right
I fight, with myself in the ring of doubt and fear
The rain ain't gone, but I can still see clear
As a child, given religion with no answer to why
Just told believe in Jesus cause for me he did die
Curiosity killed the catechism
Understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to
And became a slave to master self
A rich man is one with knowledge, happiness and his health
My mind had dealt with the books of Zen, Tao the lessons
Qur'an and the Bible, to me they all vital
And got truth within 'em, gotta read them boys
You just can't skim 'em, different branches of belief
But one root that stem 'em, but people of the venom try to trim 'em
And use religion as an emblem
When it should be a natural way of life
Who am I or they to say to whom you pray ain't right
That's who got you doing right and got you this far
Whether you say ""in Jesus name"" or ""Hum do Allah""
Long as you know it's a bein' that's supreme to you
You let that show towards others in the things you do
'Cause when the trumpets blowin', 24 elders surround the throne
Only 144,000 gon' get home
Only 144,000 gon' get home
Only 144,000 gon' get it, baby

I've lived and I've learned
I have taken and I've earned
I have laughed, I've cried
I have failed and I have tried
Sunshine, pouring rain
Found joy through all my pain
I just wanna be happy with being me

[Verse 2: Cee-Lo]
Let me voice my concern
So many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title that their actions didn't earn
Our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence
Subconciously, seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince
I've finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse place
'Cause it's hard to correct yourself when you don't know who you are in the first place
So I try to find the clue in you
But evidently, White folks know more Black history than we do
Why're we being lied to? I ain't know our history was purposely hidden
Damn, something in me wanna know who I am
So I began my search, my journey started in church
It gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief
Hustlin' was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets
Taught me survival from this evil I'm just gonna have to deal with
And I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school
It almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only science and math are universal
Takin' elder advice, read the Bible, the Koran
Searched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites
Hold on, this ain't right, Jesus wasn't White
Some leads were granted with insight
And it's all in the plan, but it took me some time to overstand
He still created with the imperfection of man
So, with following I disagree
By no means have I forgotten or forgiven what's been done to me but
I do know the Devil ain't no White man, the Devil's a spiritual mind
That's color blind, there's evil White folk and evil niggas
You gon surely find there's no positivity without negativity
But one side you gonna have to choose
Any chance to speak I refuse to misuse
So how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession
Become an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and can't follow your lesson
If a seed's sown, you make sure it's known, you make sure it's grown
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own
[Hook]
I've lived and I've learned
I have taken and I've earned
I have laughed, I've cried
I have failed and I have tried
Sunshine, pouring rain
Found joy through all my pain
I just wanna be happy with being me"

The Supreme tee is kinda dingy
Pass the fucking puffer, nigga stingy with the Usher, let it burn
Skate session with my niggas
On a cloud, where's my inhaler, I can't even breath
I don't smoke weed
But I'm on a cloud high enough to give me a nose bleed
Say farewell to the brain cells, neutrons can smell us
My niggas keep enough green to get a bush jealous
Roll tighty, the joint righty, go buy a label
And busters don't get the zimper in Chris Lighty, alrighty
Or maybe a swisher, I begin to kiss her
Keepin' all the arms and limbs in a large bin
My niggas keep mary jane like a fucking Tarzan
In the fuckin toilet where my bars been
They been the shit since Riley figured out she really likes Dark men
Domo hitting bowls, nuggets size of coals
Rolling a whole 'nother blunt the size of a troll
Davon on paroll, so if the highway patrol
Sees us strolling to 7-11 to get a Arizona
And some donuts, he'll be in a hole, but we're not gonna let it happen
Im not talking music when I say were the best at wrapping
The kush, coke, Ritalin, and mushroom caps in my system, um
[Verse 2: Hodgy]
I break number 2 pencils cause I write so strong
Tyler rolling up a stick so when it lights, so long
Brass monkey, clarinet, ten drop in the gong
Gas mask, vaporizer, tranquilize you with the bong
Imagine gas and 'laxing, puff passing past tense
Future kush, cool tour, poke your arms blue or
Dream, smoke white like vanilla bean ice cream
Besides OF, Mary Jane and me make a nice team
Pause, aw you getting too fat, bitch
Munchies, gaining weight is fucking automatic
Can't fit into the plus size of that sack's fifth
She get high, get down on hot dogs and pick up the cat bitch
The powder is packed in the straw, Sammy claim he like chowder
Nostrils are allowed to scream white power
Overdose in a quince then detox, she rocks
Got em sweating like they inhaling on she cops
And we the drug, and we the drug, and we the drug
Bitch I'm high as fuck, just let it sing to you

[Verse 3: Domo]
I stay in the sky so there's no way you can get fly as me
Niggas wish that some point in their life they'll get high as me
Never though, got a dorm room filled with hella smoke
With towels under the door hoping no one outside smell the dro
Fuck it, I'm blazing up, bad bitch craving dust
So I passed it to her last thing she’ll see before waking up
Strong dank leave your main bitches with throat aches
One of em half bakeing, half dressed cause her clothes stank
Rolling paper skills, it's the time I showcase
So rush down, bitches want a star beat like old Bapes
Where Davon at? cause he can Zieir too
Big Cam Lawrence kid, you can even call Lionel
Tyler dog, hit it once for the game
Give it to Hodgy Beats then dish it off to the Brain
My eyes heavy, someone give me a orange juice
Louie V shades so my thoughts don't support you
Thoughts decreases, hunger builds in my torso
Paper plane on paper plane, can I please aboard you
You, you, uh, ayo Vyron, light that one

Kush, coke, X, mushroom
I'm high as fuck

[Verse 4: Tyler]
I'm Atheist, so I let the blunt bless her
Higher then a fat nigga bitch blood pressure
On the dresser is the kush compressor
That four cents of bags of fluorescent flower pedals
Take a hit of this shit, inviting some
Bitches over to the crib, take a sniff, feeling numb
Baby girl, this is love, mixed with coke
And the eighty proof is in the pudding, so is a pint of cum
This is fun, don't you even try to run
Get you high, get you drunk, oh wait, you're not even real
This is fucking fake, snow white is in my nasal
I don't even think I'm able to shimmy passed the table
Without tripping on cables, me and Travis crying
Earl is probably dying, Cedric licking walls
And all of us tripping balls, heart beating in a trance
I'm in a submissive stance, I'm not fucking playing
When I say call the ambulance, shit

[Outro]
Call the fucking ambulance
I can't feel me, call the.. I can't fucking breathe
I'm not fucking.. this isn't.. What the fuck is this he..
Yo call the ambulance, my heart is beating too fast
I'm bout to.. Open a fucking window"
Shock the World,J. Cole & Kendrick Lamar,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Life make a nigga wanna yell out
Change for that fame, how some niggas turn sell out
Too old for my mama crib, I'm tryin to get the hell out
Stayin' out these cells but we working on that bailout
Help out, please. Sure is hard livin without cheese
Ain't shit in my pocket only these house keys
They pray for a nigga but yet they doubt me
That's why I'm out getting higher than balconies
But no I won't jump, being broke is childish and boy I'm grown up
My money runnin' late tho so boy I won't front
When my paper finally make you should know I'm gonna stunt
So, hard

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
My God, my life is such turmoil
Can't save me tonight cause times is hard now
I know you tell me don't let my guard down
I gotta get it my nigga

[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Never believe what they say
Man, I gotta get paid
Dawg it's so damn amazing
How I'mma shock the World
I'mma shock the World
Hell naw I ain't lying
Yea, I gotta get mine
Dawg it’s about time
So I'mma shock the world
So I'mma shock the world
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Stare inside of the soul of Kendrick
While I stare inside the solar, system hopin' I soak up
Enough game to play 3 systems with one controller and remain sane and remain unsober
Was closer to my dreams but reality actually told me hold up
No money in my jeans and my salary said you owe us
Can't pay them taxes, laid on that matress and feel colder than a polar bear
But this bear was in California
So I felt out a pocket and then a piece of lint fell out my pocket
A broke opportunist all in my optics
And you could see it even when I'm Sleep
My screw's loose, I hate when loose change fall in them seats
Because I need every dime like Magic Johnson
Or Hugh Hefner living in his prime
Prime example of youngin' on his grind
This the life of a Compton nigga
I know the vanities of the world like the promise niggas
That's why we crooked, in yo bushes where you find us nigga
You better scramble before you fold like an omelet nigga
This ain't insomnic nigga and that means I don't need Busters to front on me
A Bible in my pocket I'm walkin' like it's a gun on me
So when I catch a fade they know to put more than one on me
Fear no evil, I can still see Regals pullin' up
Niggas tuck like a baby in fetal, position
If you listen you can hear the city needs you
That's what my mind said
But my big head is tellin' me that I'm a black Beatle
Until my number is called and someone yell bingo
A shadow in the dark, park the coupe
Then recoup with the homeless in the park, Kendrick Lamar"
Faith,Kendrick Lamar,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk
I ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you want
But if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
To witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service
Embarrassed so I start questioning God, ""What is my purpose?""
He said to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday
I said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen
I opened my Bible in search to be a better Christian
And this from a person that never believed in religion
But shit, my life is so fucked up, man; I can't help but give in
I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met
Hopped on the pulpit and told them how I was truly blessed
Felt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over
Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
Then lost my faith again

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
What am I gonna do
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?
(Don't you give up dont you give in...)
Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Single black parent from Compton raising children of four
That's four innocent bastards 'cause, papa, they don't know
Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
Can't find no one to watch her kids, so she pay her sister
Her baby daddy ain't 'bout shit, that nigga ain't 'bout shit
Spilt his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
She pray to God every night, hoping that he'll mature
And maybe one day his kids something that he'll live for
Baby wanna go back to school, but she need some help
Because it's hard trying to pay the bills when you're by yourself
She thought about credit card scams, 'til she heard a voice
That said, ""The Devil is a lie, make a better choice""
And so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealing
With those crazy ass people at the county building
Looked to the heavens and asked Him to make a better way
Then got a letter in the mail, lost her Section 8
Then lost her faith again

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
What am I gonna do
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?
(Don't you give up dont you give in...)
Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed
[Verse 3: Punch]
I had dreams of holding a 9 milla to Ray's killa
Ask him why as my eyes fill up
Each day it gets more realer, orangutans bang like gorillas
It's jungle when the niggas in zoo
The rats lurking, vultures circling the serpents
Cats lying through they teeth, my nigga didn't deserve it
I flirted with the ideal of caressing the steel
To make karma come faster than she normally will
It's ill, to see my faith try and leave me
It's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy
I'm tryna reach Cloud 9, that's what my niggas 'bout
But it never rain in California unless the pistols out
Until then, my feet planted on the ground
Shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding
And if I get no answer, just know I tried
I should have never looked into his son's eyes
Rayshawn Boyce

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
What am I gonna do
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?
(Don't you give up dont you give in...)
Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed
[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
Your mind's slipping, wondering, ""Is there really a God?""
Knowing you shouldn't think that way and trying to freeze your brain
But whenever there's pain, that feeling forever remains
We can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer
Cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair
And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
At the tender age of 12, and you feel that no one cares
Searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong
Just know when you feeling that way His Spirit's in the room
I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost
And wonder why I ain't ever caught that feeling before
Maybe they know Him better, or I don't know no better
But what I do know, is that He's real and He lives forever
So the next time you feel like your world's about to end
I hope you studied because He's testing your faith again

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I'd rather not live like there isn't a God
Than die and find out there really is
Think about it"
Friday Night Alone,JJ Demon,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
Everyone, look into the television now
Hell has risen outta the elements in the ground
Fellowship of the sound
Always looking ahead with a final glance back
Before we put it to bed
It's as good as it gets
Wouldn't it get any better if you were my editor?
Oh you think you're so very clever? Well you're not
Robots roam the perimeter
Minister on the soapbox, so very sinister
Isn't it possible to feel better than alive?
There's only one way to find out, you better hide
Music has never been described as this before
Kiss your forever a goodbye, better be advised
Weather we decide to level everything or not
Everybody dies
Bombs away
Bombs away
Bombs away
[Chorus]
So, yes (yes), I'm pretty (Pretty)
Sure that this won't be pretty
And we can dance all night in the fiery glow
When they burn down this whole city
So yes (yes), I'm sure (sure)
That this is going to mean war (war)
When you're locked in the cellar with your loved ones fella
But someone's at the door
So, yes (yes), I'm pretty (Pretty)
Sure that this won't be pretty (Pretty)
And you can spend your Friday nights alone
When they burn down this whole city

[Verse 2]
Everyone, look into the television now (Now-now, now-now, now-now, now-now)
We need medicine, we need medicine
Put it on the front page and bold the lettering
The media's seen enough Leno and Dave Letterman
It's plans for the poor being lost and editing
Toss the prejudice out of this seventh story
Before we see hell on Earth, the presence of Heaven's glory
They don't give a fuck about us dying, it's a science
Of making money by taking it from somebody as broke as I am
Open up an eye and just look at all the disease
Crooked politicians are putting on a routine
They're talking about taxes when the fact is
When half the fucking country is still in the short cause if their tax bracket
Now we live in the old shell of a hospital
Cause you made health care impossible
People are dying in a war?
Well back home more people are dying cause they're poor
[Chorus]
So, yes (yes), I'm pretty (Pretty)
Sure that this won't be pretty
And we can dance all night in the fiery glow
When they burn down this whole city
So yes (yes), I'm sure (sure)
That this is going to mean war (war)
When you're locked in the cellar with your loved ones fella
But someone's at the door
So, yes (yes), I'm pretty (Pretty)
Sure that this won't be pretty (Pretty)
And you can spend your Friday nights alone
When they burn down this whole city

So, yes (yes), I'm pretty (Pretty)

Let Me Be Me,Kendrick Lamar,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Everybody, just clap your hands if you're real
Middle finger up, give a fuck how they feel
Be yourself, just show me you're real
Middle fingers up

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I just wanna be me
No disrespect, but motherfuck you
My education stopped at a high school degree
But I can outsmart any high IQ
Draped in some fly shit, call me Jeff Goldblum
Cold, my style making my nose run
Oh, I stare at the mirror then realize, that real lies within me
Some say I'm crazy cause I think like I need a shrink
Ask too many questions about the stars and Earth shit
Rather be in the studio than out buying drinks
So if I'm not clubbing, don't think I'm on some jerk shit
And California on that jerk shit
But I'd just rather 2-step, like my first steps
Jill Scott on my iPod, as my head rests
Yes
[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
And yeah I know I'm from Compton, Cali
But I don't lace up Chucks or rock tan khakis
And skinny jeans ain't quite the lick
I probably would wear 'em but my dick don't fit
Ha ha ha, I like to joke, got a sense of humor?
Still face, play me short like an oompa loompa
You ain't gotta screw up your face in front of the kids
Won't you lighten up like Michael did?
I grew up with killas man, people who killed men
But my character never could be like them, man
And they respect that, say that I'm real man
Not a fake person, that's the Sims man
Live my life through some film, man
I ain't acting out shit, I be packing out shows
Cause they know that they don't know Kendrick fo' sho
And oh
[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Almost lost my life to the industry
Had to look through a photobook to remember me
These label heads ain't nothing but bullshit
Have you with professional killas, chasing hits
Lying to yourself, all over an image
Making records they want, that was wrecking my brilliance
My Mama said, ""Boy, that don't sound like you.""
I said, ""This is the sound, though.""
My only excuse
Quite frankly, dusted off my shoes with my hankie
And kicked it like he skate, make these motherfuckers hate me
The reason why they hate, cause these motherfuckers ain't me
And you can underrate me, but I know what I'm worth
A diamond in God's dirt, a diamond in winter
Watch the Simpsons and eating some cereal for dinner
See I give you my life, to mix it up in a blender
To make sure that you feel me
[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down

Kendrick Lamar, What are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
I think that I finally reached the pinnacle
Of finding myself as an individual
The world is so typical
I just wanna be higher than that
I used to want to be the messiah of Rap
Infatuated with becoming a relevant star
Trying to say goodbye to the glamorous chains and cars
That I never had, but wrote it in my raps to make you mad
Vanity, they say that it can damage me
So do I really want it?
If I didn't, I guess I'm a cool cocaine connect
That means I'll be frontin'
Cooking in a laboratory, hoping I can tell a story
That the whole world can feel, like the ones that came before me
Knowing that I'm misunderstood
So I gotta get my point across like a snitch would
And I would never walk in the shadow that never was really there
Or try to fill the shoes of an invisible pair
And Dave said he proud of my newfound honesty
And all I could say is, ""Will the radio care?""
Yeah, or should I say no?
Or should I just stop and come with a whole new approach?
You heard my hip-hop when I was 16 years old
Well that was me then, now I'm an adult
22, like the smallest of guns that you know
Most determined, but with the smallest of funds to show
But I'm not worried
My talent should take me places I've never been
The world should turn as soon as my records spin
I wanna be the highest, on top of all the bullshit
The negative you bring, the stress, the violence
The capital punishment, the loud police sirens
Too focused, one word, righteous
And this is Kendrick Lamar, and soon ya'll know Cloud 9, ya'll
That means I wanna be the highest
Too focused, one word, righteous
That means I wanna be the highest
Too focused, one word

[Outro: Female Voice]
Too focused, too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word
Too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word"

How the fuck am I supposed to rock the show sober?
I need a drink tell a bitch to bring it over
I'm so gone boy, now I'm talking nonsense
You ain't bout money man, thats nonsense

No coins I need a dime please
I need a Williams and a Reeder, who do I see?
This is Mrs. Marry Jane, she really chill yo!
You may have seen her in ya favorite rappers video
She's really up there, you know first class
If you've ever get a shot you probably wanna work that
Is she a bad chick? College life, drinking Con
Above average, Vuitton - Luboton -
She needs a good Header, better yet good head
Someone like now, without using the tool shed
I'm Tryna Screw You, And Your Friends Too
Thats what the labels say, and then they sign you
Before they find you, they tryna guide you
Like this is mainstream nigga fuck the soul Inside you
Ok then Rock! Here you go!
Mainstream till your video stereo
So typical, how you even like that?
Lookin back now, why you even write that ..
Why you even write that..
[Verse 2]

I put my jealous in the air like a viking!
Heart so cold that my chest started icing
When I get the ice in the cards, will you like me?
I talk about the cries and my boys wanna fight me
Just because your hungry man that dont mean you can bite me
Make your own lane man do not try to Might me
Cuz everybody's Jordan nobody's ever Michael
If anybody's scoring and no body's an idol
And we dont need the points motherfucker just the ring
Drink a little more Gin for that tied extinct
'fore I write another verse I think about my message
Think about my life and how I should address it
How tha fuck am I supposed to be a real Kid
When they never even givin hell what real really is
I could never change me to see me blow
Can't be real if I ain't fake thats Pinocchio

[Hook]

If it ain't about the money then its the cars
If it ain't about the Whips then its prolly for the broads
Well I wanna make a toast to the Beast
For selling his Soul to Me
If it ain't about the money then its the cars
If it ain't about the Whips then its prolly for the broads
Well I wanna make a toast to the Beast
For selling his Soul to Me

When the moon Shine, wolfs cry I dont ever sleep man
They be keeping me up, early to the A.M
Rep for the Lions, food for the youngsters
I write a verse feed it to a far from them Monsters
I dont never get close, maybe I should change that
My Dark side is killin them they wish we never came back
Dark is so evil thats cause you dont even know me
To me they so Heavenly, to you they so phony
Club won't even play me, they say im not a Famie
Famous for the Rich I just dont think people change me
But you just got of stage, wha?
Baby can you really blame me?
Its Bitter Sweet success and this clime is so tangy
Suppose that I could taste it so much that I could face it
If Jordan never four-fived he probably be amazing

And money never stays, it just starts changing"

I tell em, Careless World probably gon’ make the world stop
Vibrate your soul, make your pussy pop

I speak a language of money, like casinos
Spitting my phlegm on pictures birds and eagles
I’m on a mission to Mars, Don Cheadle
I’m a legend to ya’ll ordinary people
From Hollywood to Cerritos

And living single, all my diamonds seem clear
Louie trunks in my living room bitches stare
Who is this young? how’d he manage to make it here
The future is ours, robotic sports car
Paid for, therefore, beach chair just chillin'
I don’t eat pork and I’ve never tried chitlins
It's hard living in hell, why should demons avail?
Turn into a human shell
Hate you cause they hate themselves
Hah, blood thinner, poppin’ pills to stay balanced
On or off the road, everyday's a challenge
I need a studio, book me room, a palace
I gotta go its gettin’ late and I ain't got my license
Cop pull me over and shit, asking why I was driving reckless

Still gave me a ticket though

[Verse 1: Erin Christine]
This morning, everything was quiet, staring at the ceiling
I knew I had been lying cause I let my ego keep me away
First you kept it to yourself, we both couldn't admit it
But you make my heart melt so eventually, we did it

[Hook]
When you tell me how you feel, I don't know how to take it
I don't know how to take it, I don't know how to take it
When I tell you this is real, it makes me feel naked
It makes me feel naked, it makes me feel naked

[Verse 2: Erin Christine]
Just last night, I wanted to call you, let the flame ignite
But some how all I could do was paint the picture in my mind
First you kept it to yourself, we both couldn't admit it
But you make my heart melt so eventually, we did it

[Hook]
[Verse 3: XV]
I hope I'm not just love drunk and I hope I'm not saying too much
But just for me to say this to your face, I was waiting two months
And if we break fast, I won't make it through lunch
But it was hard for me to hold off when you the thick type like the bold font
And dressing well, why would I want your clothes off?
And if you try stocks, don't ever buy into the girl talk
Monopolize the game and buy a boardwalk, I just hear about
How you never could, never would and never have
And how your man bounce like a check that wouldn't cash
But if you be my Harvey Dent, that's my better half
One day, I'll put you in a ring like Everlast

[Bridge: Erin Christine]
Now I know that I've been lying to myself
Underneath that's how I felt, now can you handle it?
Boy, can you get with it? I'm gonna need some help
If there's really no one else so tell me you're loving it

Feelin' blessed, performin' for sold-out shows
You rappers talkin' shit, what you know 'bout those?
What you know 'bout spittin' bars and the whole crowd goes? (Yeah)
It's unbelievable, these people say I made it
Throwin' down a little Henny, can't believe that I don't chase it

Goin' down in history for rippin' beats

You tune into my station, hope you listening
Turn it up and follow on my journey as I live my dream

Smokin' in the whip, chillin', duckin' from the po-lice

Niggas had their eye on Phonte form the outset
Cause I keep things simple and plain/plane like SouthWest
On to higher heights

Hands in the air and

Four years ago my girl made me a parent
Four years later Kev's beats we be sharin'
Goin' back in forth in the car straight illin'
And they say I'm raisin' hell, I just call him Dillon

Old school, sometimes I'm anti-social
And won't speak, stay cooler than Cochise
Drop poems over the beats to hold the streets

Under my cleats is where the comp is
Swarmin'

And crossin' my path is where you lose your fortune

See I'm programmed for business with no glitches
So I won't get frozen, hold position
With flows that'll go the distance

In a class of my own, like I'm slow, I'm kiddin'
But on some real shit
Oddisee means journey so when I rap y'all niggas on some field trips

JAH Rastafari, bredrin licking chalice right under the flight

King of kings steps alite to the door of the chariot
Waiving to the massive/ Mortimo Planno tells the crowd to relax
Let His Majesty pass Red Gold and Green flag
Waves on taken land blessed by his ancient plan
Just then a sistren named Rita saw it
The mark of the christ stigmata they call it
She told her man Bob that His Majesty is God
Later that day Jah gave the elders a nod
Held a reasoning session and blessed them with a lesson
Said Liberate yourselves then in Zion you step in
He said liberation here, in Zion you step in

A-hunga-hunga-hunga-hunga!

[Verse 2: Master Gee]
Like Kemosabe, of course it's me
I'm better known as the Master Gee
A firing squad, sensed the danger
When they're stung by the rapping ranger
Had a little talk with my medicine man
He said, ""Get them squaws, fast as you can""
To all you girls, that wanna join my Tribe
Just move to my rhythm, and feel my vibe
Put up a fuss, in the end you'll agree
When you come inside, my tee-pee
As I said before, you could sense the danger
When you're stung by the rapping ranger
When Silver and I, take a ride
All you suckers better step aside
I sting squaws, then I run away
Hi, yo, Silver, is what I say
[Bridge]
Ho! Ho!
Wolololololo!
Hit it, gang!

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Wolololololo!

[Chorus]
Tonto, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it
Kemosabe, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it
Custer, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it
Apache, jump on it, jump on it
Wolololololo!
A-hunga-hunga-hunga-hunga!

[Verse 3: Wonder Mike]
A pow-wow, just rock it out
Finger poppin' to the break of dawn
Keep it rockin' like the stuff that we call maize
(What's that?) Hot buttered popcorn
You just hippa-hoppa-dippa-boppa bang the boogie
Woogie betcha wanna boogie again
And you can put me to the test at your request
I rock you out of your mocassins
Kemosabe got down, took off his mask
He kicked off his shoes and did the Monster Mash
Tommy came along, saw what was happenin'
His head began to boppin' his foot start to clappin'
Go slam, dunk, do the jerk
And with the mic is how my smoke signals work
They were jammin' off a record that said it best:
""Now what you hear is not a test!""
[Bridge]
Wolololololo!
A-hunga-hunga-hunga-hunga!
A-hunga-hunga-hunga-hunga!

[Chorus]
Tonto, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it
Kemosabe, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it
Custer, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it
Apache, jump on it, jump on it
Wolololololo!"

Alone in Vegas,Pusha T,"['hip hop', 'dance', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
I let you into my diary to admire me
The make-up of this man, I let you see the higher me
The self-righteous drug dealer dichotomy
I'm drawing from both sides, I am Siamese
The tug of war opens the door, entrada
Rip me apart and see what's inside of this piñata
And rolling kilos in Gymstrada, that's one saga
One chapter of black magic, I'm Harold Potter
Feels like I'm doomed to dealing with women who
Relationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom
And blossom, I swear them Vegas nights was fucking awesome
But adiós, I blow my own dice before I toss 'em
Lost some niggas, some other niggas double crossed 'em
Tryna snatch my niggas back, I blew a small fortune
Wrestled with the work, we was like the four horsemen
Ric Flair with the flame, I'm motherfucking Gorgeous (Woo!)
As the gull wing doors lift
Karate Kid crane kick—no Jaden Smith
Whiter than that coke brush that they paint me with
Sunk leather seats softer than an angel's kiss
But they devil red, tires double tread
I post and parks up, that gets me double head
Tightrope walking, tryna keep a level head
But bright lights blind, look at what the devil did
[Hook]
She left the door open, gave a fuck if I'm famous
I write this alone in Vegas
Came off fly street money, partied nights with the A-list
I write this alone in Vegas
Remember nights when my team blew it all on the tables
I write this alone in Vegas
I'm the only one left and the memories fading
So I write this alone in Vegas

[Verse 2]
They'll do everything in their power
Stomp near the stove when you're rising like flour
Make your cake fall when you threatening their tower
It's 911, you're on your 25th hour
Hasta la vista, I'm steppin' out the bleachers
How the tide turns when the pupil's now the teacher
The game can't grow by just followin' the leaders
You gotta be better than the ones who precede ya, yuugh!
Upgrade them, upstage them
Change the whole body shape and just update them, Pagans
Reagan era, I ran contraband
Money caused turf wars through the promised land
First time being rich could be a common man
The Guy Fishers had the blueprints and diagrams
We just took what we needed and we built on it
Lord forgive me for the blood that I spilt on it
[Hook]
She left the door open, gave a fuck if I'm famous
I write this alone in Vegas
Came off fly street money, partied nights with the A-list
I write this alone in Vegas
'Member nights when my team blew it all on the tables
I write this alone in Vegas
I'm the only one left and the memories fading
So I write this alone in Vegas

[Outro]
Yeah, Fear of God niggas
Got me feelin' like Pac, this the realest shit I ever wrote
Who you know
Sit in New York for two days around Grammy winners
Come back home straight to the money getters?
'Bout fourteen thousand dollars worth of twenties
Brown paper bag money, yeah
I call that a good weekend, haha
Re-Up Gang forever
Long Live the Caine coming soon
Malice, my brother, I love you
Liva Don, 'til the end, nigga, yes
Emmanuel, hope I ain't get you in no trouble with that shit
That was a long time ago, you know? Haha
You know how we do
My nigga Nottz, is blacking out on this beat, my nigga
Yeah, come on, my nigga Watts, what up?
Young Young, what up, my nigga?
Talk that shit, my nigga
Hey 'Ye, is you ready?
Is you ready my nigga? I had to get this of my chest
Is you ready now though? Let's go then
G.O.O.D. Music, yes"
Who Killed Hip Hop?,Joe Budden,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Can anybody pinpoint the day it went wrong?
I mean, I used to blame Reggaeton, I can’t front
I thought all that was corny, was it Ja’s fault?
Lil Mo said she ain’t get paid for ""Put It On Me""
Look, you bring it up and dudes get on some coy shit
Was it T-Pain with that funny voice shit?
Or was it Lil Wayne with that funny voice shit?
The whole game dick rode that funny voice shit
I can’t tell when it happened
Was it when Lil Jon showed dudes you could sell without rapping?
Was it Laffy Taffy? I thought they was kiddin’
Shawty Lo said ‘Dey Know!’, I really didn’t
Dancin’ became cool again, then came ""Walk It Out""
But I ain’t know what the fuck niggas was talkin’ bout
Unit kicked Game out, they ain’t give a fuck
Then we see the same shit happen to Buck
It was a few years ago, but I remember the summer
50 made fans start looking at the numbers
A&R’s won’t take risks, they won’t sign niggas
The word ‘swag’ came out and started to blind niggas
Rap dudes want reality shows
And my dumbass was thinking that reality sold
Did it start with the iPod?
Or when rappers had to pay DJ’s for them to do their job?
Now all the content is the same, it don’t differ
Everybody sold some drugs or pulled triggers
The more you think about, you gonna just get sicker
I mean, why the fuck would Nas wanna call his shit ‘Nigga’? NIGGA!
Was it when the Wu broke up?
Pac, B.I.G., Pun went to sleep, never woke up
Lupe was doing a tribute and choked up
Some of these stupid ass fans was like, “So what?”
Some them they ain’t educated
Fuck blaming the south, we ain’t segregated
I mean, it was all good around the Kiss and Beans shit
Took a left turn around the Kiss and Green shit
Maybe it all started when Roc-A-Fella parted
Ways, it’s natural to shift toward fame
I watched every last one of dudes shit on Dame
Kind of got that in common, I can dig that pain
When they gave Jay a desk and suit
They finally gave a rapper a chance to come execute
But somethin’ told me the suits at the tables was hurtin’
They Fired everybody, labels started merging
Far as sales? The decline is strong
As the experts, they’ll say that the climate’s wrong
I mean, some niggas prime is gone
I peeped it when niggas started puttin’ fake diamonds on
You can tell a dude, “I spit better than you”
But then he’ll say, “I’m richer for whatever I do”
I seen all this coming, I knew what we was in for
Back when Erick Sermon had jumped out of the window
Was it when Ma$e retired? He couldn't hack it
Tip could, he just needed some more ratchets
DJ’s, Producers, the one’s who get us the farthest
Said, “Fuck rappers!”, and they became the artists
I gotta talk candid
Did we start having issues around the same time Jimmy and Cam did?
Or was it when Chingy thought he ain't need Ludacris?
His Next album, found out that that was ludicrous
Papoose and Clipse both survived
Inking with Jive, then getting jived
Your man Jae Hood repped that D-Block gang
Then I seen dude dragging his D-Block chain
Or did one-hit wonders change it all along?
They made labels only want to sign a dude’s song
And you really don’t know shit
If you think the fans pick the videos on 106
I’m just stating the truth
Did it start when Fox stayed in the news
More than she did the booth?
Or was it when Lil Kim stopped exploiting sex?
The fuck is up with DMX?
I hope dude’s straight
Have an opinion and they gonna say you hate
I can’t front, I’m missing the old Clue tapes
Next thing, the underground sunk further
The feds was on Irv so The Inc dropped Murder
I never blame Fab, Jeezy, Rick Ross
Did shit get lost when Shyne went up north?
I’ll never understand the hiphop police
When hiphop is what hiphop needs to police
These blatant-ass radio attempts sound so bland
Twista kept trying to recreate ‘Slow Jamz’
Then we send the wrong message with our slang
Broke niggas blowing they rent to make it rain
So you walk in and give a bitch a few $20′s
She’ll smerk her face up, looking at you funny
This chick told me she only take new money
Man, I snatched my shit back sooo fast
Or did it start when rappers said, ‘Fuck it’
Sacrificed music and started raping they budget
Nothing wrong with dude’s being candy or pop
Something was wrong when Joc did the Candy Shop
We buying our own records, maybe no one’s to blame
Are we a business that we can’t afford to maintain?
Second week show that boy numbers ain’t high
I hate to break it to you, numbers always lie
Or when Ortiz signed to Aftermath
And Now he’s feeling the aftermath
Was it Fight Klub fucking with them battle raps?
Not too many of them gettin’ signed after that
I mean, some can’t stay afloat
A million Busta albums he’s still not mentioned with the GOATs
Fuck looking for answers, time will tell
Was it when Def Jam didn’t want to resign L?
A 15-year old told me Cass was ass
Rather than spazz, all dude could do was laugh
Or was it when the whole East Coast fell off?
Or got comfortable, maybe dude’s was too well off
The more niggas said they didn’t write down lyrics
The more it started to sound like they didn’t
But, do whatever you can to keep the lights on
But Dumbin’ down just became the new “DYLAN!”
Honestly, I ain’t know what to think
A few years ago we had the young kids wearing pink
I can’t blame the fans for not knowing a damn thing
When We trained them to be this way
I mean showed ‘em whatever to sell with no limits
Since the early 90′s, sold ‘em a false image
So when some shit comes that don’t fit the mold
It’s like mole and nigga you won’t even do Gold
They watch the videos
See you on the corner with a whole bunch of people and think that you hood
They turn on the TV
See these video bitches and they think niggas girls really look that good
I mean They get so many free verses when the album drops, the shit’s more like a bonus
Why pay for it? Why take onus?
With one click of the mouse they could own it
I mean some of them are fooled so easily
By whatever we say or we show ‘em on TV
But that was all part of the plan
Or was it when Eminem made ‘Stan’?
I swear some of these fans, they put they whole life on the line
It’s like they can’t like more than one rapper at a time
Less about the product, more about the digits
It’s a business, we got less fans and more critics
Maybe we at a cross
Canibus made one of the dopest diss records but some still say he lost
And I ain’t believe my ears when niggas tried to tell me
That KRS-One had a rap beef with Nelly
If rap was alive, we’d be trying to be the best rappers ever
Not the best rapper alive
But you won’t get accepted at all if you ain’t street tough
Onyx was the hardest ’til Sticky got beat up
Now ‘I’m A Thug’ is how I gotta behave
If I wanna be paid, if I wanna see praise
You know something’s wrong when niggas are getting shot
And you gotta sit and wonder if the whole thing’s staged
It ain’t REAL no more
Or did we just expand on our audience, maybe we appeal to more
Or, do we think ya’ll are just getting dumber?
We tried to make gettin’ older getting younger
Did we lose our hunger? Something’s gotta give
Did we outgrow ourselves? Is hiphop for kids?
If it is, they turn on MTV Cribs
And think, “That’s where these motherfuckers really live!”
Or, was it when Lauryn Hill dropped a classic?
So did the Fugees, til Wyclef tapped it
Songs don’t do it no more, the shit’s shocking
Seen it when “Lean Back” had the whole world rocking
Now it’s “Fuck your bars!” if your hook is fly
So we look at Crooked I with a crooked eye
Dope ass rappers ain’t seeing no dough
If everything’s commercial, where the fuck is the show?
But anybody making a dime, see ima wish well
Still we took a big L losing Big L
Or was it when YouTube came in the game?
Now nobody’s from their living room can make a name
Or when Indies like Koch came and blew up
Niggas at the majors they literally threw up
To some, it ain’t fun no more
You know it’s fucked up when DMC don’t talk to Run no more
To many egos, like we ain’t one no more
Shit’s predictable, niggas ain't stunned no more
We startin’ to see shit we never seen before
At one point, we even had the magazines at war
OR, was it street DVD’s like Smack?
Showed you just how stupid your favorite rapper would act
This shit get lifeless
When MTV made a list of the hottest and ignored the nicest
Changed the whole steelo
I mean the averaged fan never heard of Goodie Mob or a Cee Lo
But they heard of Gnarls Barkley!
And Dr. Carter still say we got a heartbeat
I ain’t gonna lie, I was scared to death, straight up
I started to hear rumors of an Outkast breakup
I was like, “That ain’t true, it sounds desperate”
Then started to see Big Boi and 3K separate
We had periods where it was drier than a desert
Are we all killin’ this shit? Is it a group effort?
Are we alive and well or barely surviving?
Is it R&B’s fault? Them niggas is thriving
Then a lot of people go and blame LimeWire
I don’t think it’s downloadin’ dog, the line’s tired
Did the fans just get tired of the outcome?
One dope single and a bullshit album
So they share albums with each other
Was it Master P with them ugly ass album covers?
Or when we started appearing in the news?
Timberland said they didn’t want black niggas wearing they boots
I mean, I know it got foggy, at least blurry
When the label dude got knocked out by Keith Murray
Or was it when we became obsessed with the brand names?
Had the kids trying to buy shit they can’t name
And some think the evidence is ample
Did it start when Puff took advantage of the sample?
Is it all watered down with no fire?
If you had enough money you can buy a ghostwriter
Or the Diamond District, with Jacob the Jeweler
Had to buy his watch to be looked at as cooler
Fucking with them trends
Our stupid asses wasted a hundred grand on shit that ain’t even in
Look, is the game now as bad as it’s ever been?
It’s not ringtones, just the songs that they represent
I heard all of ‘em
The sad part I wouldn't recognize most these niggas if I saw ‘em
I can’t explain it, I don’t know what to tell ya
Now goin’ Gold is look at as a failure
Maybe old heads in charge just weren't able
DJ’s is spinning now with no turntable
Maybe the fans are just bored of us
Or maybe there ain't enough room for all of us
It’s like, even a friendship will stop at a point
Mike Jones went platinum off of Slim Thug’s joint
But there’s so many ways to get fuckin’ rich
Supahead caked off by just suckin’ dick
Did we sell out just to get in demand more?
Did we go against everything we used to stand for?
Both are likely
There’s two sides to a coin, who you rollin’ with: Souljah Boy or Ice-T?
Some niggas wanna sit around and complain about
I rather analyze, seek how it came about
If we could rewind the world
We wouldn’t have to watch Flava Flav try to find his girl
Look, today it’s all about marketing and promo
I remember VH1 was just for old folks
But no ma’am
If I ain’t know better, I would think that mix show is now programmed
We let the power of the dollar annihilate us
Now the size of our chain gonna validate us
It’s too simple, they can’t think we’re really deep
I just heard Chris Brown on the A Millie beat
Seen a video, it’s called Lookin’ Ass Niggas
Grabbed the remote, tired of lookin’ at niggas
But that let a nigga know if we ain’t dead
Then we just half alive, maybe brain dead
Did it start when Capone left Nore?
Nah, he went to jail, that’s a whole different story
Or, maybe somethings really wrong with our ears
Obie Trice got dropped, so much for Cheers
Female emcees, they don’t ever hit the target
Somebody said they saw Amil working in a Target
The sad part is we already lost Remy
Or did we go wrong when E-v-e got skinny?
What’s up with Jacki-O, Rah Digga, that I can’t figure
And Trina ain’t been the same since Nan Nigga
I know it had to do something to his heart beat
When Lady of Rage started doing Steve Harvey
I know we caught a lil’ trama
Somewhere between Yo Yo, Boss, and Lil Mama
Lot of females found another way to extort
Most of our video models have turned escort
Do anything to see dough
So they’ll exchange sex with an artist or director for a lead role
Or should we get back to basics?
Where’s the Rakim’s or the Master Ace’s?
The Big Daddy Kane’s, or did we never recover
From Dre not being on the side of Ed Lover
Or when rap dude started signin’ their friends?
Instead of going out and tryin’ to find niggas with skill
Seen it happen when D-12 put out Purple Pills
And while the whole hood laughed, them niggas sold a Mil’
Some of us ain’t prepared for something so lucrative
I just heard Yung Berg say some stupid shit
Like we almost caught one in the torso
When each Bone Thugs member took they own crossroads
Some disagree, some gotta see the same
Or maybe Hip Hop died on Aailyah’s plane
If it relocated where did it move to?
I still Love H.E.R. the way Common used to
Or did Bill O’ Reily come fuck up the spirit?
With negative remarks about everybody’s lyrics
Spend all this time dissin us
Nigga you 95 years old motherfucker shouldn’t be a listener
Lost Jam Master, who was tougher then leather
Or did it start when Treach started fuckin Pepa?
As our jeans got tighter and our tee’s got longer
I’m trying to figure which age group we belong to
Or did we all go astray, the second Dr. Dre left N.W.A.?
I mean in my opinion we was on easy street
When he was beefin’ with Eazy-E
Or did we get fucked up when producers found a way to cheat?
Signin unknown niggas to start making their beats
If you sell your own shit it gotta go for cheap
Put my name on it and the price increase
Or, is it cause everybody’s so self-centered?
Is that the reason Hip Hop itself ain’t centered?
Or have we already seen this shit with our own eyes?
Rico Suave, Hammer, and Vanilla Ice
Everybody want in the game so in return
You got label executives fuckin’ their interns
And anybody lookin’ at that new Vibe bracket
Should see that they don’t know a thing about this rap shit
Or maybe we shoulda stopped being proud
When there was no more Rawkus and no more Loud
Tried to get conscious around Vote or Die
So they made it look like all our votes was lies
As the years go on it’s like we keep gettin more voids
We got lost when we lost one of the Lost Boys
I knew we was impersonating a fraud
When Kay-Slay smacked my man at the awards
Regardless, it’s our fault as artists
Runnin’ with entourages who act like they ain’t never left the projects
Who do we wanna target
Will they put an Uncle Murda cd in a Wal-Mart or a Target
We got the nerve to not wanna hear Ras Kass
But fuck with V.I.C. “Get Silly” and that trash
I felt ashamed
When J-Kwon told me he ain’t like Raekwon cause he stole his name
Was back when everybody in the club got tipsy
Now every contract gotta be 360
So fuck eatin’ better scrape the plate
Now every beat gotta at least have an 808
Did the lights get dim when we first heard Mims?
And said “Another New York rapper on the South tip”
Is it overcrowded?
They keep sayin “If it’s so fucked up, then do something about it”
I doubt it, there’s just one thing they don’t understand
That job is way bigger then just one man
Or maybe all of these pleas that it’s deceased
Is false and it’s right where it needs to be?
Maybe we built on something that’ll last forever
See ‘Face and Geto Boys just got back together
Maybe no one can stop us, even other genre’s now jock us
We even doing songs with the rockers
How is that the feelin’?
Kanye’s amazin’, Wayne just sold a Million
We closer to a ceilin’
How are we in a coma?
When we the only business you can excel without a diploma
Technology changed, made everything simple
Myspace is now a dude’s bio slash demo
Aside from this rap we generatin’ more money
We took it global and penetrated other countries
So let’s celebrate, sip some Cris’
Some more shit we embrace just to end up dissed
Go and buy the bar out so we can all get bent
Let’s go and cop a bunch of cars just to still pay rent
Or here’s another bright idea to entertain
Let’s go and put our face on the bottom of a chain
Are some of us just nigga rich, with nigga money
While Jews keep laughin, “Look at these nigga dummies”
Should Hip Hop be a steppin’ stool
Till we find another role we can step into?
Some of us doin’ movies as a matter of fact
And some never stopped to plan life after rap
I mean, as a whole did we stop movin’ further
Around the time Snoop Dogg went on trial for murder?
Or was it Scarface creatin’ these clonies?
30 years later everybody’s still Tony
Maybe anybody complaining is deranged
Can you expect something to grow and not change?
We’re socially accepted, deviated our old route
To simplify the term we all sold out
I think I figured out who’s to blame
Started out Obama, ended up McCain
So we Kurt Cobain’d ourself and we’re defeated
So next time they ask “who killed it” tell em WE DID!!!"
Killing All,Latin Hustle,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Young E]

It's only a matter of time before I'm locked up
Cause I'm killin' beats, they getting rocked up
Fuckin' with me might get you socked up
Why you hatin', just because I left your bitch knocked up?
Dogging me, I'm pretty sure you gonna get shot up
It ain't my fault that I like to get a lot of
Green and girls screamin' like it's a fuckin' opera
1-800-Latin-Hustle, do not call us

I'm so lonely like a fuckin' unchosen road
Tearing apart pussy but I leave it sewed

Breakin' fragile hearts, no apologizing though
And with my fans, I get more and more
Your girl went with you cause I left her heart torn
Shit, I've had swagger since I was born
No one's fresher than me, Evaristo
I got lots of flavor, call me Cheetos
My creations are so damn magical, Yu-Gi-Oh
You dont even know what's left in store
Talkin' to a teacher, I will get bored
I hate class and school, but I'm on the honor roll
My dreams are darker than feathers from a crow
Young E's finished till the next verse, yo

Uneven paint splattered on these walls
Getting every body pissed the fuck off
Like repeatedly getting missed calls
Females love me like I'm the fuckin' mall
These little rappers makin' me feel tall
Can you please tell your girl to get of my balls
You pussy niggas be combin' hair from dolls
But ima take this game by the throat, I won't stall

Police State,dead prez,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Chairman Omali Yeshitela:]
You have the emergence in human society of this thing that's called the State. What is the State? The State is this organized bureaucracy: it is the police department. It is the Army, the Navy. It is the prison system, the courts, and what have you. This is the State; it is a repressive organization. But the state and gee well, you know, you've got to have the police because if there were no police, look at what you'd be doing to yourselves -- you'd be killing each other if there were no police! But the reality is the police become necessary in human society only at that juncture in human society where it is split between those who have and those who ain't got

[Verse 1: stic.man]
I throw a Molotov cocktail at the precinct
You know how we think:
Organize the hood under I Ching banners
Red, Black, and Green instead of gang bandanas
FBI spying on us through the radio antennas
And them hidden cameras in the streetlight watching society
With no respect for the people's right to privacy
I'll take a slug for the cause like Huey P
While all you fake niggas try to copy Master P
I want to be free to live, able to have what I need to live
Bring the power back to the street where the people live
We sick of working for crumbs and filling up the prisons
Dying over money and relying on religion
For help. We do for self like ants in a colony
Organize the wealth into a socialist economy
A way of life based off the common need
And all my comrades is ready, we're just spreading the seed
[Chorus: stic.man]
The average Black male
Live a third of his life in a jail cell
'Cause the world is controlled by the white male
And the people don't never get justice
And the women don't never get respected
And the problems don't never get solved
And the jobs don' never pay enough
So the rent always be late
Can you relate?
We living in a police state

[Verse 2: M-1]
No more bondage, no more political monsters
No more secret space launchers
Government departments started it in the projects
Material objects, thousands up in the closets
Could've been invested in a future for my comrades
Battle contacts, primitive weapons out in combat
Many never come back, pretty niggas be running with gats
Rather get shot in they back than fire back
We tired of that, corporations hiring Blacks
Denying the facts exploiting us all over the map
That's why I write the shit I write in my raps
It's documented, I'm in it, every day of the week I live in it
Breathing it, it's more than just fucking believing it
I'm holding M1's, rolling up my sleeves n' shit
It's Cee-lo for push-ups now
Many headed for one conclusion
Niggas ain't ready for revolution
[Chorus: stic.man]
The average Black male
Live a third of his life in a jail cell
'Cause the world is controlled by the white male
And the people don't never get justice
And the women don't never get respected
And the problems don't never get solved
And the jobs don' never pay enough
So the rent always be late
Can you relate?
We living in a police state

I am a revolutionary
And you’re gonna have to keep on sayin' that
You’re gonna have to say that ‘I am the proletariat’
‘I am the people’
‘I am not the pig’

You could man-make things better for us

Pissed on the motherfucking White House lawn
I threw a rock, then I ran
'Cause I couldn't stand anymore within the grips of the man
Y'all wanna ask me who's sane?
These biological gasses are eating my brain
It's a political grab bag to rape Mother Earth
Thirty seconds after they bagged Dad for what he's worth
Thousands'll die now so millions'll smile later
This ain't the Rockford Files, nigga, they stockpile data
From satellites, where you discuss whose style is greater
In this killing pool, you playing it cool like Cal Tjader
When y'all ready to rock like Led Zep then I'll cater
With weapons of mass destruction an hour later
What's your identity today?
You on some John F. Kennedy or Timothy McVeigh?
This Hennessy done left me with a remedy to spray
For my identity, your life is the penalty to pay, motherfucker

Just tryin' to win, just tryin' to win

It's not a Vietnam song
I know women from Desert Storm who came back deformed
Missin' limbs and disease in their legs and arms
Chemicals twice as strong as Agent Orange

War goin' off in your mind, no man is safe from
It's not a Game Boy, Xbox or PlayStation
It's Resident Evil when every president's a mason
Robbin y'all fools like Dick Grayson
And y'all inherited roots and you don't know how to retrace them
Place them back, face them facts
Disgraceful, faceless, tasteless acts
Pharoahe takes the authorities to court
Peep crime before it happens like Minority Report
And I will never be mentally defenseless
Catch me on the block, in the hood in the trenches, sayin'

So East side I’m a goddamn gang
Said you ain’t heard about my goddamn name
Better ask around here, I’m a goddamn king
Man I put my work in these goddamn streets
Earned my stripes like a goddamn beast
Tatted up no shirt still got sleeves
And I'm good from heights to 116th
Mother fucker this me, Kells
Fuck the fame!
Still roll through the blocks where they up them thangs
With the same hoes that tatted up my name
I’m still the little white boy out of Shaker, mane
I go hard, off, in, dumb
But you don’t wanna test my G
Because I got one thou', two thou', three thou', four thousand soldiers in EST
Baou, Baou

Yeah, yeah, yeah!
You know I put it down for (Cleveland)
I rep my state, my hood, my side of town in (Cleveland)
King of this shit, that’s why I wear my crown in (Cleveland)
So don’t come around Cleveland

Tatted it on my arm you know I’m reppin' (Cleveland)
This where I'm from you wanna hate, don't step in (Cleveland)
Laced Up I got to keep on running (Cleveland)

Getting money little nigga

Do I know you? Nope
I don’t know!
Do I know you?
East side, let’s go
I could show you
West side got tools, no pro tools
I know a couple niggas down the way
East High School, yeah, I went down the way
Aye
'98 I pulled in Cleveland
Ever since then I've been down to stay
I got adapted quick man, I'll snatch ya bitch
Bankroll, Pringle, have to stack my chips
Oh no, I ain’t play much
But E.S.T. be the team I play fo'
I got love for the niggas that fuck with me
No love for the niggas that don’t fuck with me
It don't matter if I’m out of town
Everywhere I go I let them know I'm Cleveland bound

Man I'm east side right here, did crime right here
Blood, sweat and tears I cried right here
Tatted my city and showed pride right here
Looking at it like 'this mine right here'
So what you talking about; I can’t ride right here?
You mother fuckers think I'm gonna hide right here?
Raised in this god damn city
No I wasn't born in it, but believe I'ma die right here
Cleveland bred, Cleveland fed
My Cleveland girl give me Cleveland head
And anybody saying that Cleveland's dead
Fuck y'all!
Tell them that’s what Cleveland said

Ropes,Invincible,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
It's hard to get a glimpse of hope
When you against the ropes
Try to penny pinch but after bills and rent ya broke
Life it always throws a wrench like Emp at Interscope
You in the aftermath succumb to numb it with a drink or smoke
To ease the pain I sleep all day
Relieves the hangover from the E and J
Looking for a tunnels end a light to lead the way
But the shame has been ingrained into my DNA
Cause pops was a failure
Mom was on lithium
Always settled for less than the best
No one to pity 'em
No one to drop a pretty gem
At seven tied a plastic bag over my head
Like, ""What's the point of getting older and dead?""
So innocent, searching for missing links
Surrounded by the carcasses of instruments
Of dreams departed hardened by the sentiments
Out of tune and sharpened by the artists who neglected it
I'm scarred by my resemblance
[Hook: Tiombe Lockhart]
Silly things
That I do to feel life
I realize
I drink and I smoke
Scrambling for a hint of hope
My tight rope

[Verse 2]
You know the one where a rabbi, imam and pastor walk in
To a bar to discuss what happens if the caskets drop in
The one inside committed suicide
Family spastic sobbin'
The answers come in more flavors than Baskin-Robbins
Will god forgive 'em for the sin
And will they ever make amends
Or was it the last option off of the path they walked in?
Depending on if they believed in hell or heaven
Or if there was a chemical imbalance in their cerebellum
Or if the pain was overwhelming full of self loathing
Feeling plagued by failure like the first males chosen
Or what if hell's frozen, and life was only this purgatory?
Full of greed, and murder, war
See I know you heard the story
What if they wait and have faith to reincarnate?
With luck they won't be stuck again between a rock and hard place
Running in a hamster wheel
We wondering what answer's real
And star gaze pray someone above to keep our heart safe
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I heard the barrels cry, wishing they could spare ya lives
Was feeling paralyzed but, no, I wasn't scared to die
Feared not livin' to the fullest so I pulled it
All or nothing
Now somebody wanna call my bluff when
I tried to flinch
Told them that the suicide attempt was cause I'd rather die
Than live and ride the bench
For every victory there's like 50 times the setbacks
For every revolution there's a death trap
And every time I see police attackin' with a TASER gun
A protester that's down already on the ground my face is stunned
I see people that's unaffected like ""that's just for safety, hon""
Turn around and tell myself: ""You're not the crazy one""
To all the unfazed and numb, hope that you hear
What I've spoken is clear
So you stop repressing choking the tears
We all walk the line between insanity and sanity
And hope and despair
Hope and despair

[Outro: Tiombe Lockhart]
I realize
I'm as big as the sun in the sky
Wild dreams and mild denies
Slow raw and numb outside
I dream in the snow
I drink and smoke
Hint of hope
Walking on the tight rope"
Steppin To The A.M.,3rd Bass,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","*sound of clocks ringing*

[Verse One: MC Serch]
Ready in the intro, cue up the Serch-lite
Point us to the center stage (I'll grab the first mic)
Projectin the voice with this mic that I'm cuffin
You ain't my nucka, SUCKER I'm snuffin
The word of the 3rd stands true, so no panickin
(Man verse man) you freeze up like a mannequin
Petrol, you let go, the wax for the new jacks
To dwell upon you're steppin on the trigger as the tune smacks
(Square in the butt) Pete gave me the cue
So I'mma put up or shut up until my jam is through
But for now I wanna freak em, so I'll embark
To spark your mission posse, til way past dark
(Don't park there's no standin) or I'll play the five-oh
You don't stop movin until the Serch says so
To keep the tribe open, shootin out to play em
Three the hard way'll keep you steppin' to the A.M

[Beastie Boys samples playing]
(At the sound of the tone, the time will be 1 A.M.)
[Verse Two: Pete Nice]
My mind has a question, I respond
To a silver domed microphone (one step beyond)
Straight to eighty-eight to the curves of the 90's
I'm universal, I set a line free
Behind me, the three the hard way, the jackpot
(Awaitin Satan's, tryin to take cheap shots)
We groove crowds, the three stand proud
The brothers round the way sit down and say
(How'd you do this?) Ludicrous rhythm of rhyme
Anticipate like a bottle of Heinz.. KETCHUP
(No catch up!) Cause you fell behind
I'm steppin to the A.M. -- dickin down swine
Pete Nice skims over lyrics, I pick em
Strong and long, you're wrong, I stick em
(He's the law with the sword) with my cable swingin
(Like _The Pit or the Pendulum_) Pete Nice bringin
The sunrise with no lies, legitimate (and you despise)
Envy this MC's magnitude (so realize)
The MC emceed (The DJ deejayed em)
Until the next time I keep you steppin' to the A.M

[Sample]

[Verse Three: MC Serch]
No weight on the felt plate, deep bass below rise
Needle torture groove, move the record til the wack stride
(Schoolin the swine on the strength of my vocab)
Bet you wonder you're a goner
(You're thinkin that you had)
Lyrics to the A.M. but the house needs a swinger
You st-st-st-st-stutter, but I'm a stinger
(My rhymes so potent, I wrote em and it's evident)
You're just a stunt, seekin a settlement
The lyrical line (The article original)
Afflict like a convict, I ain't no criminal
Schemin on a cable or slobbin the knob
You played me like a foul ball
(How you livin Hobbes?!?!!)
Now groove into the A.M., the master spoon feedin
Out a jumper, you're bumpin a freak while I'm G'n
Peter let the record spin (Serch'll get a second wind)
MOTIVATE THE CROWD, til it's steppin' to the A.M
[Sample]

[Verse Four: Pete Nice]
I slide swiftly, keep a brother steppin
(loungin, strength in my throat)
Sweatin as you get hit with the rhythm
My lines sustain like a crane, so uplift them
(slow and smooth) Flowin like fluid
The mass did worship the lyrics the three did
(amid all crisis) Drop it like a guillotine
(You're moist) fearing the voice of the rhyme fiend
Scene is zipped, Pete Nice is your worst dream
Fulfilled your illed I thrilled (I heard a LOUD scream)
My mind is cued, so I run down a menu
That downgrades the weak as my lyrics tend to
(the needs of a shaker, sweatin to the point of exhaust)
So listen to the mission horse
Blinded by the science, my mind starts flexin
Sexin down females to the A.M., perplexin
A complex reflex (you wonder if we slumber)
The three don't sleep (Aiyyo Pete Nice take em under!)
Steppin to the A.M., I'm steppin to the mic
To snatch up and smash up the club until daylight!"

And had breakfast, and er, had a couple of pieces of toast
You know, forced it down, then had a cup of coffee
It was pouring with rain and I thought oh God, you know, good old England

[Verse 1: Just Jack]
I get this writer's block; it comes as quite a shock
And now I'm stuck between a hard place and the biggest rock
In my own head consume, I sit back in my room
It's like the tapestries of life get tangled in the loom
I'm like a butterfly, caught in a hurricane
My pulse is quickening as my heart plays a new refrain

I'm lovin' Mary Jane, flyin' with Lois Lane
On board a bullet train
Don't know yet if I'm glad I came
Don't know yet if I'm glad I came
(Obviously this helps me I think)
Don't know yet if I'm glad I came
Don't know yet if I'm glad I came
(I always hoped that it would happen but I never though it really would)
Sometimes at night I think too much
About life and love and music and stuff
(I mustn't sort of build my hopes too high)

[Verse 2: Just Jack]
I'm livin' in the past
My clock is an hour fast
Should really go and make a coffee but I can't be arsed
I've lost my mobile phone
You'll have to call my home
On second thoughts just leave a message when you hear the tone
My grimy windows show, the early morning glow
Another day, another dollar in my one man show

I'm lovin' Mary Jane, flyin' with Lois Lane
On board a bullet train
Don't know yet if I'm glad I came
Don't know yet if I'm glad I came
(Obviously this helps me I think)
Don't know yet if I'm glad I came
Don't know yet if I'm glad I came
(I always hoped that it would happen but I never though it really would)

I fell out with Mary Jane, I don't speak to Lois Lane and I missed that bullet train
But now I know I'm glad I
Fell out with Mary Jane, I don't speak to Lois Lane and I missed that bullet train
But now I know I'm glad I
Fell out with Mary Jane, I don't speak to Lois Lane and I missed that bullet train
But now I know I'm glad I
Fell out with Mary Jane, I don't speak to Lois Lane and I missed that bullet train

Gas—past tense, made facially

Three blind mics on sight
Zev Lover, gave it the first light
A grin shows a trick up a sleeve (HUAHAH)
What a tangled web they weave
Deceivers, stupefied through fable
Say Let's Make a Deal at the dinner table
Put you on tour, put your record on wax (""Trust me!"")
Sign your life on the X
You exit, x-off, but what you really get:
A box of Newports, and Puma sweats (""Damn!"")

Black cat is bad luck, bad guys wear black
Musta been a white guy who started all that

My expression to the mountainous blue eyes
Then form a face, and shake my skull cap
Dismiss the myth, that evil is not black
But opposite spectrum, this done by red man
With horns on his head, laid down the ill plan
Got all his helpers, said, ""Make it snappy!
Tell all the people that their hair can't be nappy!""
Blonde and blue-eyed, or dark-skinned heffer, G
A disease, created by leprosy
Don't speak of bleach, bend them to right

Cash or credit for unleaded at Sunoco
KMD and 3rd Bass is just ace in the hole

Damn, if looks could kill
You look like your host was a ghost from your grill
But still, what's the new fad, to recollect
To our passing phase to facades to '80-deca
For my label reads Hood, street might have a tattoo
Don't pick any card or no rabbit from my hat
Never a magician if I ever tricked em

Stupid in love

Let me tell you something
Never, have I ever, been a size ten in my whole life
I left the engine running
I just came to see, what you would do if I
Gave you a chance to make things right
So I made it, even though Katy, told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time
And she was right, mmm
Don't understand it, blood on your hands
And still you insist on repeatedly trying to tell me lies
And I just don't know why, oh

[Chorus]
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid (Stupid in love)
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid

My new nickname is ""You Idiot"" (Such an idiot)
Mmm, that's what my friends are calling me when
They see me yelling into my phone
They're telling me, ""Let go, he is not the one""
I thought I saw your potential
Guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it, not like you want it
Scheming and cheating, oh girl, why do you waste your time?
You know he ain't right
You're telling me this, I don't wanna listen
But you insist on repeatedly tryna tell me lies
And I just don't know why

This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid (Stupid in love)
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid

Tryna make this work
But you act like a jerk
Silly of me to keep holding on (Oh)
But the dunce cap is off
You don't know what you've lost
And you won't realize
Till I'm gone, gone, gone
That I was the one
Which one of us is really dumb?
Oh, no, no, no
I'm not stupid in love

This is stupid (No, no), I'm not stupid (No, no, no)
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid (Like I'm stupid)

Everywhere we go
Every day on TV
They be talking about
Who you gonna vote for
You got a black man running
But I wonder if he get in
Who he gonna open up the door for?
I don't wanna to discourage my folk
I believe in hope
I just want us to want more
Politics is a game
How they keep us contained
There gotta be more that we could hope for
Democrats and Republicans
Just 2 sides of the same coin
Either way, it's still white power
It's the same system
Just changed form
You wanna vote? please do!
Cast your ballot, let your voice be heard
But what I do want to say is
After the election
You'll see
Mark my words

It's politic time again
It's politrick time again

It's politrick time again

Shoot the messenger!

This is the most important election of all time
The government's committing the biggest of all crimes
These bullshit politicians say they speaking for the people
Before they ran for office, they were shitting on the people
Billion dollar campaigns
Trillion dollar bailout
Anybody know the definition of a sell-out? huh?
And if Obama win, he wouldn't be the first black
Take your 2 dollar bill and turn it over to the back (you see? right there)
But with the TV on, you only hearing they voice
The system is broken, they trying to beat a dead horse
Go ahead and vote for the lesser of two evils
I plot, plan, and strategize with the poor people
The middle class will say this opinion is irresponsible
But if you ain't got no healthcare, they kickin' you out the hospital
McKinney, Clemente, off in the Green Party
No disrespect, we need a Red, Black, and Green Party
Like Marcus Garvey's

Even if Obama wins
Uncle Sam ain't my friend

The time is on the side of the oppressed today; it's against the oppressor
And truth is on the side of the oppressed today; it's against the oppressor

The Heart Pt. 2,Kendrick Lamar,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Intro: Dash Snow, Daniel Joseph & Kendrick Lamar]
""I’ll tell you what I don’t believe in, can I do that? All right, I don’t believe in laws, or the system by any means, whatsoever. I try not to obey them at anytime. That's what I believe in not believing in.""
""So what keeps you alive?""
""Four big bottles of water a day, two packs of Marlboro Reds. And, uh, I don’t - what keeps me alive, shit. Music, I have to listen to music all day long. I'd say that keeps me going. I’m a pretty dark person, I’ve thought about ending it a million times. And I have to say that music keeps me here, by far, the main thing.""
Thank you

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go
Right now, freestyle or write down, whatever
It still'll come up clever, I just need to free my thoughts
And Lord knows that I know better, but I ain't perfect
I ain't seen too many churches or know them testament verses
You should either hear me now or go deaf
Or end up dead, die trying and know death
Might end up dead, swallow blood, swallow my breath
Fuck a funeral, just make sure you pay my music respect, nigga
I mean that from the bottom of my heart
You see my art is all I have
And victory tastes sweet, even when the enemy can throw salt
Still knock them out the park like a fucking tow car
Let bygones be bygones, but where I'm from
We buy guns and more guns to give to the young
I'm living the life of a nigga trapped, nigga
Inside the system all you envision is trap niggas
My uncle doing life inside prison; he wasn't wrapped too tight
He told me ""Rap about life, not rap niggas""
That's why I'm shaking my head when you rap-dissin'
My stomach start turning, my nerves get to twitching
I start evaluating, then my final intuition
Is that you wishing a come up, would just come up
We used to beefing over turf, fuck beefing over a verse
Niggas dying, motherfuck a double entendre
And this is Comp-ton, lions in the land of the triumph
Wrap-Saran our defiance, ban our alliance
Put burners in the hands of the black man
One hood with 20 four-fours like a cloned Kobe Bryant
You probably heard I wanna be heard and wonder who I am
You probably even listened to ""Faith,"" and think I know Zion
But really I'm just caught in the loop, of understanding the truth
Because it seem like it's always clashing with science
I got a big fear of flying
My future so bright I'd probably go blind before I blink twice
I ain't lying
I swear to God, half of y'all just don't know Kendrick
The school of hard knocks, we was the first ones in attendance
You walking down the block, he got shot, you are no eye witness
You just mind your business
You just turn your head, kneel down and then tie your tennis
It's kind of scary, ain't it?
You can't act like no bitch, that only got Tyler Perry famous
Just let me explain this, why you pick up that stainless
'Cause your pops wasn't anxious to see you and you hate it
So much you probably had your burner tucked at graduation
So if you see him on 'em bleachers then you kill him
Facing 25 to life with a murder charge
Your enemies was the prey and now you pray to God
I pray these bars get farther than Compton
And if our record never break, I still won’t break my promise
I promise to keep it honest
Secret society, all we ask is trust
And all we lack is communication like service sucks
The people scared of annihilation when Kingdom Come
And I'm like, ""The Kendrick Lamar OD in less than a month, all right?""
Gotta keep it pushing
Can't let the government tell me how my future looking
I'm on Rosecrans and Central trying to duck the central bookins'
If the fucking pigs get behind me then you know I'm bookin'
Never will I surrender
I been a warrior when I came out my mom's placenta
In the gutter lane like I'm Master Splinter
How splendid, I guess my project had did it
Got all these niggas approaching they mixtapes different
They said seven tracks, I said 15
Called it an EP, they said I’m trippin'
But little did they know, I’m tryna' change the rules
That we’ve been confined to, so the corporate won’t make decisions
Uppity bitches handling business
Killing our dreams, stealing our vision
Out in Haiti, adolescents barely have a home
In LA everybody think they fucking on
Hop on Twitter, perpetrate we doing big shit
Who we hanging with and bragging about the iPhone
I swear to God most of y'all cats just don’t know Kendrick
You barely know yourself, so I guess most of y'all should be offended
Ain’t doing this for my health, I’m tryna' purchase my momma dem' Benzes
Occupying my time with riches, justifying my time ambitions
Just to coincide, just to go inside, plus we idolize why we living
Look, the mastermind took the master's mind
Just the perfect time, just to master mine
Just to match the grind with precision
Look, the mastermind took - (cough)
[Outro: Alori Joh]

So Low,Talib Kweli,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
I can go so low
I can feel the gravity that's in the world around me
I can go so low
I can feel the fire burning as it swirls around me
And I've been so low
I felt ice cold in hours at the bottom of the sea
Might have been so low
You might did low get low but you never been as low as me

[Verse 1]
I always speak for the struggle my people still hurting
I'm a name brand I'm a product but still a real person
I'm still flirting with death although I'm still certain
About my commitments in life although I'm still searching
I bet I find a way if not I bet I make a path
One thats seldom traveled by the masses
I never stuck in all the traffic I cut through all the plastic
Enemies of the enlightened like the government is fascist
I talk it how I live it yet I'm still considered a walking contradiction
Cause I'm breaking out of your artistic prison listen
I got my own demons what I'm supposed to do with yours
Times like this I gotta remind myself what I do It for
People I knew before celebrity swear they see the change in me
I tell em change is god you gotta let it be
How does it feel to come full circle
Still cursing still pursing my lips to pull purple but
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Witness it the building of a legacy
So let us just pray cause the journey thats ahead of us
Got us facing a task that just might get the best of us
Thats why we gotta clash with the Titans like Pegasus
No Oedipus but it's like the beat is my therapist
When I let it in it get up in the cracks and the crevices
Of my memories what kind of treasure are you buried with
You fight when you die are you a soldier or a terrorist
Remember this there's no one else to blame when you're solo
Establish your fan base local before you take it global
Don't be scared spend your own dough
You gotta speak up be vocal sometimes you feel so low
Ain't nowhere to go but up go with us
We just getting started why you slowing up
But know enough to know by a collective we
Even if my name is on the record sleeve I ain't into brevity
What the fuck is a celebrity

Follow Me,Kid Cudi,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Wake up and see just what, what could be
My life as, as good as it ever be, ever be
Close, close my mind, to the outside light

You can’t, can’t be, where I,I be
Follow me and you’ll see and you’ll see
You can’t, can’t see, what I, I see
Follow me and you’ll be free, you’ll be free

So hard to cope it hurt, hurt my hope
My pride deep inside is fading slow
Fall, fall asleep my brain runs at speeds
I’m lost, lost in dreams and reality, reality
Please save me Lord, my life is such a chore
But I, I need this to be ok, be ok

What, what they think of me it ain’t no thing
My heart, heart is broke completely

They Dont Care About Us,Michael Jackson,"['pop', 'dance']","[Intro]
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
Don't worry what people say, we know the truth
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
Enough is enough of this garbage
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
(Overlapping voices)

[Verse 1]
Skin head, dead head, everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Bang bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

Beat me, hate me, you can never break me
Will me, thrill me, you can never kill me

Kick me, kike me, don't you black or white me

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me, what has become of my life?
I have a wife and two children who love me
I am the victim of police brutality, now
I'm tired of being the victim of hate
You're ripping me of my pride, oh, for God's sake
I look to heaven to fulfill its prophecy, set me free

Tell me, what has become of my rights?
Am I invisible 'cause you ignore me?
Your proclamation promised me free liberty, now
I'm tired of being the victim of shame
They're throwing me in a class with a bad name
I can't believe this is the land from which I came
You know, I really do hate to say it
The government don't wanna see
But if Roosevelt was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

Skin head, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Situation, speculation, everybody, litigation
Beat me, bash me, you can never trash me

Nothin On You,Lupe Fiasco,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook: Bruno Mars]

I could be chasin' but my time would be wasted

They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing' on YOOOOOOOOOU, baby
Nothin' on YOOOOOOOOOU, baby

[Lupe Fiasco]
You already know where my heart be at
Tempo that my heart beat at, boom boom
That for you, for real, for truth
There's never been trivial pursuit
May look like a sedan man but I'm really just a coupe
Now that's two, so they can't fit, there's no room
And there's no roof, so there's no limitation
Limitless, since it's initiation
And to the crew, seed sown, then it grew
Was a pilot now we in syndication
And every time we show up this Pay-Per-View
Or the news, you're my satellite, that Youtube (tell 'er!)
[Hook]

[Lupe Fiasco]
On my microphone hustle, stay behind the bar
And I thought I could never be imprisoned
This the story of how you caught me slippin'
That's right, locked up abroad
You remain, they mirage, they collapse, we collage
We stick together like we starting fires
Thick as thieves, pick pockets at large
Kinda like lame miserab's
But we don't play, Broadway's for the stars
She's venus, and me's mars, so we like on a whole 'nother chart
Surreal, it's like a whole 'nother art
Hanging at the moment, and we got our names on the A-train cars
Like freedom meets cars, coming down banging knocking pictures off the walls

[Hook: Bruno Mars]

[Lupe Fiasco]
So what more? Further I could go into
But what for? We're already killing them
We're like Williams and Woods on tour
Now that's love above par, ooh
I just love to love ya'll, you're my power
My peace, my elegant flowers
No matter what the world is coming to
I take the rap, they got nothin' on…you
[Lupe Talking Over Hook]
Heh..you know what I'm sayin'?
I mean, temptation is a mother
But you're like none other
They can't compare

Yeah, the vibrations are very nice on this one

The Time Is Now,John Cena & Tha Trademarc,"['hip hop', 'dance', 'jazz', 'r&b']","[Intro]
Krrr, Amadou!

[Chorus: John Cena]
Your time is up, my time is now
You can't see me, my time is now
It's the franchise, boy I'm shining now
You can't see me, my time is now!

[Verse 1: John Cena]
In case you forgot or fell off, I'm still hot, knock your shell off
My money stack fat plus I can't turn the swell off
The franchise, doing big business, I live this
It's automatic I win this, oh, you hear those horns, you finished
A soldier, and I stay under you fighting
Plus I'm storming on you chumps like I'm thunder and lightning
Ain't no way you breaking me, kid, I'm harder than nails
Plus I keep it on lock like I'm part of the jail
I'm slaughtering stale competition, I got the whole block wishing
They could run with my division but they gone fishing
With no bait, kid, your boy hold weight
I got my soul straight, I brush your mouth like Colgate
In any weather, I'm never better, your boy's so hot
You'll never catch me in the next man's sweater
If they hate, let 'em hate, I drop ya whole clan
Lay yo' ass down for the three-second tan

Yeah, uh
It's gonna be what it's gon' be
Five pounds of courage buddy, tint pants with a gold T
Uh, it's a war dance and victory step
A raw stance is a gift when you insist it's my rep
John Cena, Trademarc, y'all are so-so and talk about
The bread you make but don't know the recipe for dough, though
Aimin guns in all your photos, that's a no-no
When this pop, you'll lip lock, your big talk's a blatant no-show
See what happens when the ice age melt
You see monetary status is not what matters, but it helps
I rock a timepiece by Benny, if any
The same reason y'all could love me is the same reason y'all condemn me
A man's measured by the way that he thinks
Not clothing lines, ice links, leather and minks
I spent twenty-plus years seeking knowledge of self
So, for now, Marc Predka's living live for wealth
(Krrr, Amadou!)

Your time is up, my time is now
You can't see me, my time is now

Its Too Late,The Streets,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Mike Skinner]
She said, ""Meet me at the gates at eight
Leave now, don't be late""
She said one day, she'd walk away 'cause I was always late
Thought things were okay
Didn't care though anyway
Say, ""Sorry, babe, I had to meet a mate,"" tempting our fate
We first met through a shared view, she loved me and I did too
It's now 7:50, getting ready, better be nifty
Do my hair quickly; step out, it's cloudy
Mate bells me to borrow money, I got two Henry's and a dealer to pay
Call up on geezers to rid these green trees of my reeking jeans
Got a ""You think I care?"" air, out-glaring geezers' stares
I'm here and I'm there
Couldn't see past the end of my beer
What was getting near all the silence after the cheers

[Chorus: Jackie Rawe & Mike Skinner, Mike Skinner]
I didn't know that it was over
'Til it was too late (Too late)
But if I ever needed you
Would you be there?
[Verse 2: Mike Skinner]
She said, ""Meet me at the gates, don't be late""
But pretty soon, the day came for change
And I was glad she never walked away
So I'm choosing what to wear
Doing my hair with an hour to spare
When my life went pear, she'd been there with a thick stare
Big wheel climbed to the top
Geezer stares bounced off
Standing at the top of this huge mountain
Smiling and shouting, spring flowers sprouting
Not one inch of doubt in my mind as I reached the gates
Came 'round the corner at a rate
Risked her love, but I was gonna set things straight
Never again am I gonna be late
Never again am I gonna be late
Never again am I gonna be late

[Chorus: Jackie Rawe & Mike Skinner, Mike Skinner]
I didn't know that it was over
'Til it was too late (Too late)
But if I ever needed you
Would you be there?

[Verse 3: Mike Skinner]
I said, ""Meet me at the gates
Leave now, don't be late""
I waited for a while listening to her voicemail, mind set sail
Then the facts turned me pale
Wind, rain, and hail
My fears unveiled for my fair female
She'd walked away; too little, too late
I step up the pace, walk past the gates, rain runs over my face
Spirit falls from grace
I purchase a hazy escape at the alcohol place in the Chase
Sat down, got a fat frown
Weeping and drowning my senses
For this love game's expensive
I walk in a trance
Got a wounded soldier's stance
And the everyday geezers' stares throw me off balance
Now nothing holds significance
And nothing holds relevance
'Cause the only thing I can see is her elegance
[Chorus: Jackie Rawe & Mike Skinner, Mike Skinner]
I didn't know that it was over
'Til it was too late (Too late)
But if I ever needed you
Would you be there?
I didn't know that it was over
'Til it was too late (Too late)
But if I ever needed you
Would you be there?"

The broke wonder, I ain't rapping about all the pesos
Rhymin' skills, kinda chill like a couch potato
I'm the noodles to your pasta if you all about Alfredo
I tell them do it if you want, but follow if Simon say so
And I'm the Simon of the game, baby follow me
These rappers trying ball out, no shopping spree
I ain't your property, this game ain't no Monopoly
I'm your highness, so you better get that on your knees (damn!)
The rap Napoleon, blowin' like a dynamite
A little cool, part sick, I guess I'm kinda tight
I left the game, came back and now I'm rhyming right
I'm like Peter Parker, after a spider bite
Climbing walls, swinging webs to all my enemies
Spicing up a record, I be blessing up a recipe
About to rock & roll like John Lennon sitting next to me
I'm yellow like mustard, ketchup, you better relish me

Looking weirder than your average rapper
Justin Bieber looking hair, with some glasses added
Little superstar swag going platinum, bastard

I'm scoring faster in here, balling above the rim (swish!)
The bass treble, we ain't on the same level
My buzz is just about as big as the chin on Jay Leno (haha)
You be causing your female stress, feeling me, don't blame it on the P.M.S (yeah!)
A rap pastor, I'm bashing these wack bastards
I'm backing, playing Havoc while slapping your ass backwards
Me fail, is never going to prevail
You're better of thinking you can keep your female
I'm kinda threatening but she be text messaging
I think shes filled with estrogen because I'm acting fresher than
You

A letter in reply, 7 days later after I wrote 'em
""Stay strong, keep your faith in God,"" what I told him
Hoping that he's listening
Said that they tried to give him like a hundred years
What a coincidence, I was bumping some Plies
I can taste the salt from my tears
As the water had start to flood on my eyes
I know it gotta be hard being 21
Doing time in the pen and your Gram's old
Your brother's getting older
And the streets is getting colder
And your hoping that he's focused to stay on the right road
Sleeping in a cell, it's been 30 weeks
Ain't recieved any mail
It's cold and the hole stinks
And you can't even blink without niggas testing your life
As I read every word that you write, I can only imagine
Jason Keaton, I can only imagine

It's in your hand and you got it
Just take control if you can
It's in your hand and you got it

Sitting on the couch, that was my Uncle Bobby
After he just got out, 15 years to count
Haven't seen the world in so long
Haven't seen a girl in so long
And before the sun came up, he was gone
Like a fiend off the best rock
Trying to get his life together, or what not
Typed his name in the system and they couldn't find his identity
Got it straight, got a place, found some serenity
Found a job, found his Mother's grave site, found a 40 ounce
Then he found God, then he bounced, then he found a new chick
Two kids, wide hips, found something in her we didn't see
Found this spot in Pasadena and shack with her, an investment
Then found guilty, somebody had yelled domestic
Violence on my Uncle, was working with two strikes
Only out a year, now facing life
I can only imagine
That's fucked up
I can only imagine, Uncle Bob

Life's about decisions man
It's in your hand and you got it
Just take control if you can
It's in your hand and you got it

Sitting on the couch, thinking about the ratio
Of blacks in prison as compact in prison
When blacks pack with minorities
System grab more of these 18 year olds
18 year sentence with no parole
The state won't oversee
They make the term severe, a conspiracy?
That's what I call it, it's full of shit
A toilet can help quick, the government help?
No, just put us on death row
Just give us some more guns, then give us some more coke
Then give us another chair, then give us some more rope
Then hang it like right there, yeah
It's justice for all but 90 percent unfair
Care? No
Alcatraz was purchased by a white man
For 5 grand, with intentions to expand
More prisons
So these correctionals ain't for rehabilitation
They for grossing a bigger business
Imagine
We're being used
Imagine
The truth shall be told

First and foremost, some rappers are sweet like fructose
When I cock back these lyrics, y'all punks best be ghost
I be the seven twenty-one, eighteen twenty-one
The illest one, I'm almost doper than anyone
Straight out the late nights of Bed-Stuy
Stepping up, y'all put your weapons up, I make heads fly
You're artificial like saccharin
You're crazy fake, it's more than skills you be lacking in
Concepts you bite, cause your identity ain't tight
Trying to be something you're not, like pulling a knife at a gunfight
I'm trooping on night air like flight number 106
And getting all up in your fucking mix
You get me upset, and I got you uptight
Cause my committee's in your city tonight, aight?
We got seventeen million of us plus, two million Indians
That makes 19 mil, lighting shit up like Wild Bill
I be the, supreme father plus the ill kid, with drama
My karma, creates the Teflon to pierce your body armor
And make sure you check the shit before you walk to me, or talk to me
Stepping to me improperly, you just may catch the weaponry
My specialty is tearing tracks out the frame
You know my fucking name, I rule all game
I'm universal on all planes, what's your claim?
[Verse 2: Guru]
Yo, I be your highness, in slickness, you chumps bear witness
Tremendous trooper, verbal nigga with the fitness
Drop you for your spot with the blazer then I blast you
Slice precise like Benihana's when I come to bring the dramas
Styles so swift, that you can't peep the god
As your lyrics get buried, six feet deep in my backyard
I laugh hard, while your mental I run through mazes
Dark stages of terror to shatter your dressing room mirror
Your whole error gets crushed, your whole show gets bumrushed
Too many dumb punks, want to enter this rap scene
Kicking Willie Bobo, but need to be slapped clean
Into oblivion, the true champion always rises
I bring surprises to the chief plus their advisers
Size me up, and you will find nothing's larger
Catch more wreck on your dome, than a deranged fucking barber
So what you made some dough, you best keep on scrambling
All your vanity, is instantly crushed, when I start handling
Demanding that you pay, for your weak rhyme display
Coast to coast, I break the fakes everyday

[Verse 3: Krumb Snatcha]
I see myself as the black rap messiah
Colossal spreading my gospel through electrical wires
Spit fire through speech, so I can reach each and every
Tom dick and jerry slippin like petroleum jelly
Too busy in the limelight, can't rhyme tight
I got divine right to bring y'all to light
Something ain't right, to be an MC, you gotta thug
Or to thug you gotta be an MC, this shit is bugged
Show love to few; deal with crew and crew only
And think universal like Sony
Phony pounds and fake hugs is usually avoided
Give a fuck like Pizza Hut I got to stay noyd-ed
Cause that same nigga you trust, could be that same cat
Behind that gat that bust, quiet ya, with the silencer
Keep it hush, ashes to dust, then dust to ashes
Nowadays it's who pull out the fastest, imagine this
Rap shit without this gat shit, or the phony cat
In black talking bout how much his mac spit
But this year, Gang Starr got changes being made
No wack shit being played no fake macks getting paid
No Versace mc's, with a mouth full of mo'
Soundin' like a ho spittin' at a fashion show flow
I bombshell that pastel Chanel rap through a maxwell
Ever since young Krumb, was taught to rap well
Going deep, process of thought, when my eyes closes
Awaken with turban, robe and sandals like Moses
Travelling high sands and eastern lands for the answers
Ignorance is spreading through the streets like it was cancer
Too many drinking not thinking, when behind that trigger
A .38 escalate the murder rate, for us niggas
It's like, microphone roulette cause nowadays MCs is getting wet
Over someone else's fake gangsta rep"
Panacea for the Poison,Flobots,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Hook]
In my mind, I hold the passion, panacea for the poison
My bruised and battered body washes up upon the shore
Sin flees from leaking wounds like rats from sinking ships
As I float off to forever with these words upon my lips

No, I never asked for nothing, and that's just what I got
As my pride dies before I do, as I fall, I'm also caught
I wasted many days chasing brightly gleaming streams
As I fold into your presence do I now know what it means

[Verse 1: Jonny 5]
We could get old and talk at the same time when we tell stories
If we let go, impossible names rhyme in elegant poetry
But I dabbled in everything; it inundates my small town
I refuse the offers extended, waiting for God now

I've never asked for nothing audible, so when the walls fall down
And spin like waterwheels, I'll pray for something logical
So when we all drown, I can cover bald spots with yarmulkes
Drawn from extra-dimensional sources like in comic books
Choose your own adventure; I'm obsessing like a drug fiend
Fantasies of actors clandestinely having sex in love scenes
But why not amateurs openly sharing joy in sex scenes?
Stand clear while I soak in this treasure trove of a wet dream

I can't tell what my problem is or even if there is one
Sail the celibacies much sooner than commitment
Escaping minor shake-ups but keep bracing for the big one
To make the choices obvious and save us from decisions

[Hook]
In my mind, I hold the passion, panacea for the poison
My bruised and battered body washes up upon the shore
Sin flees from leaking wounds like rats from sinking ships
As I float off to forever with these words upon my lips

No, I never asked for nothing, and that's just what I got
As my pride dies before I do, as I fall, I'm also caught
I wasted many days chasing brightly gleaming streams
As I fold into your presence do I now know what it means

[Verse 2: Brer Rabbit]
I juggled whimsy in a fire fight with the inner light of fire flies
Watched dusk go indigo and blush into a silent night
Birthed immaculate concepts from a pregnant pause
In the august of my righteousness, just waiting for the fall
The greater and the small, all for one and one for all
For all the S.O.S'ing, we will rise to the call
I've bitten the hand that feeds and found myself bleeding
Hereby, I'll only need what I need

But need'll get me out of my groove, so I move to different tunes
Sunning in the warm weather by the light of distant moons
Thirst statement inundation bring the monsoon
Seasoned with the spectacle of people finding tools

Appetite has grown fools; empires have sown rules
Let's throw out the cravings and things with no use
People dropping jewels; gems can't shine like our light
To err is human, so the sky is our birthright

[Hook]
In my mind, I hold the passion, panacea for the poison
My bruised and battered body washes up upon the shore
Sin flees from leaking wounds like rats from sinking ships
As I float off to forever with these words upon my lips

No, I never asked for nothing, and that's just what I got
As my pride dies before I do, as I fall, I'm also caught

Ayo, my dick don't work, that shit as soft as a pillow
My girly lookin' at me like, “You for real, dude?”

[Break: Jorma]
Ayo, hold up, hold up, we gotta come harder than that
Yo, tell 'em, Andy

[Verse 2: Andy]
I think there might be something wrong with my dick
It's like a melted stick of butter, so soft that it can't fill the rubber

[Break: Jorma]
Aye yo, come on man, this is Lonely Island
People are countin' on us
I gotta run all these motherfuckers myself, woo!
[Verse 3: Jorma]
Ayo, I think I broke my dick in the sink
It's so small and ugly, all smashed and flat, like it was playing rugby

[Break: Jorma]
Hold up, hold up, this is serious!
Kiv let 'em know!

[Verse 4: Akiva]
Yo, for real though, I suffer from stinky dick
Every time I take a piss, it smells just like shit

[Break: Jorma]
Haha, yeah, that's what I'm talking 'bout!
Andy show 'em, how it's done!

My dick looks like the fat that you cut off a steak
Smashed in like my balls went and stepped on a rake

[Break: Jorma]
Lonely Island! Grammy nominated!
Yeah! Hit 'em again

[Verse 6: Akiva]
Yo, straight out the box with my soggy little shrimp
I was an eight year old girl before the doctor found my dick
[Break: Jorma]
We make too much money for this shit
Murder music!

[Verse 7: Andy & Jorma]
I shit the bed 'cause my dick played a prank on my butt (Hit 'em!)
Straight crept when I slept and stuck a laxative up

[Break: Jorma]
Suppository music!
What y'all know about incontinence?

[Verse 8: Akiva & Jorma]
I got Hepatitis C from a horse, but no confusion (Yeah!)
It wasn't from the sex, it was a blood transfusion!

[Break: Jorma]
What?! Motherfucker got horse blood! What y'all got?!

[Verse 9: Andy & Jorma]
I write freaky fan fiction where cartoons fuck
Got CGI Garfield lickin' Marmaduke's nuts (woo!)

[Break: Jorma]
I would like to see that! This is that Garfield sex music!
Now y'all just showin' off, preach!
[Verse 10: Akiva]
I got a friend named Reggie who lives down at the dump
Every other week, I swing by and bring him some lunch

Oh, now that just sounds nice!
I'ma call it right there, game over, motherfuckers!

Grind For It,MB4,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Hook: [Ace]

Coming up pops told me (son always do your own thing)
Now I get attention (Like the house when the phone rings)
Because I grind for it
Give me water I'll make wine from it
Never had it too hard (But no your boy was never spoon fed)
Now it ain't gonna' stop (I slept in it and made my own bed)
Please believe Im gonna' grind for it
If you know me you know I grind for it

I know you see me out here grinding (X4)

Verse 1: [MB4]

Button-up new watch
Taylored pants due socks
Blue moc's
Two shots
Put me in your juke box
Now pour the champagne and let the goose pop
Take the party from the basement to the rooftop
Now why these rappers tryna' sound so hard
Sky-living space swag guess my sounds solnar
Got me thinking to myself ""why all these clouds so large?""
Im just thinking outloud for my fans no charge
Post cards to the haters ""Au revior""
Punchlines ride the whip in which my lyrics chauffeur
Im in a class of my own just like the slow kids
This the land of the fake welcome to show biz
A place where girls are getting nose jobs just to get noticed
And rappers lie about theyre own lives just to get quoted
Signing off ""MB"" catch me at the top
And they say time is money catch me in your watch
(Hook)

Verse 2: [Wyclef Jean]

My lifes an HBO series
Entourage, I confess me, cindy
Niki Minaj
Not the rapper, Im talking 'bout an actress
That I met in the show ""El Izee"" out in Paris, (yeah)
Brooklyn, call me Fabolous
You, desturbing the peace
Ludacris
Try to Kanye me for my cash
Singing ""Good Life"" by Mr. West
Where my 50 stacks?
Dont mistake my kindness for weakness brother
My RPG's will have you shaking dreads like Waka-Flaka
Trust me, we ain't' never scared
You ain't BMF you holding on to rick ross' beard
And when I bust ain't no holding me back
Boughatti's too slow so I just bought a corner sack
It feels good to see my stock go back up
If I run for president again Ima' get an armored truck
'Cuz every since baby dock hit the surface
Haiti been hot like a furnace
Wyclef AKA Toussaint St. Jean, When I spit
Saka Fih
(Hook)

Hey Clef they mad again
Its because when these rappers step on the courts the only time they traveling
Im in a yacht these rappers paddeling
Im MJ in the 4th
James Bond in the javelin
Excuse the flow but im going out of my mind
Purposely paiting pictures a young poet in his prime
And they Love me (yea, yea, yea, yea)
They loving my style
My style (Lets go)
I brought Clef back to rap
Threw Fred (The Godson) on a track
Get my beats from Vinny Idol
Show these youngins how to act
Im a hard guy to get along with
Get on a song with
Either way the boy's blowing up like a bong rip
So take a breath and be easy
My 16's having sex with the beat
My vocals come in 3-D
Im high Def without the TV
Beating me's like tryna' walk through hell with some sandals and a squee-gee

Good Luck! Button-up! Wyclef! Ace Whats good!?"

Verse:

I back up the magic like Duhon
Ballin' off the court bottle service in a Yukon
And we get asked about our logo
Thats word to the pony riding horses in my Polo
I give beats abortions
They had the chance to live until they let me get up on them
My inner thoughts, are like intercourse
They had a chance to live until they let the boy cum(come) across
Plus i got this in a bag
Only time I window shop is buying tints for the Jag
Were getting white boy wasted
If your sober and your not white, You probably shoudnt say shit
Im raps Clay Aiken
Beats chasing
The Idol in disguise and fucking wild caucasian
Game always front row
Vinny Where my drumroll!?
Im blocking all these haters raps Mutombo
Blacking out on every beat my lyrics bring the sun low
Im really something you ain't never seen
Its that audio, cardio, ""Sky-livin"" is the team
An author pick the movie I can write the plot
I own the real estate the words I spit writers block
And you should come pay us a visit
Girls around here made for head like a fitted
I kill these rappers with my state of mind
Heroine for ears everytime I fucking state a rhyme
And ""Jada laugh"" to the haters
Got me feeling like the greatest poolside in Las Vegas
Every bars worth a G call it cash flow
Do a show, hit a ball, Cheif (cheef)
Matt Cassel
Vinny, Drumroll please!!

Im the best the game soon gon' believe that
Pocket full of sticky green Hippies call it Tree Sap
My vocals live 10 times deadlier
Toss me in the desert come out 10 pounds heavier
Im Skylivin', rappers are skydiving
With no parachute out plane Yup Im flying
Announcement to all the passengers
Your boy signing off from the air this a massacre

""Vinny! MB4, Dblock, Takeover, Its just a warning shot man!...I had to do it to 'em."""
Bout To Blow,MB4,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","Verse 1:

Never say I didn't warn em
Got a classic feel while Im performing
The newest buzz around you should catch me while Im touring
Rappers stay in 2nd place, Mustve went to Oregon
Ive just been in 1st so long its starting to get boring man
Time traveling just me and my ""Delorean""
Beach houses court side before the story ends
And How Im getting it thats another story man....man

Im the one that all the fuss about
Fake promoters we cuss 'em out
Im on my Peyton Manning
Show 'em how to cut some routes
Out of space bars Mars got an open house
And im more homeward bound
""Chauffer please the closest route""
I warm up to a beat a couple bottles
Record labels hear my voice and think they hit the lotto
You ever been to Cabo?
Venice, Colorado
Hard work, family first and going hard remains the motto
Im staying on top like im allegic to the failure
My life is like a movie guess this song is just my trailor
Im lapping all these rappers all these dudes is pulling hamstrings
We going hard you woudlnt get it, its a H.A.M thing
Mirror mirror tell these data's who the best is
A couple years ago believe they never wouldve guessed this
I went from not being mentioned to on your guest list
To being wreckless
Mimosa's on planes for breakfast!
(Hook:)
Im 'bout to blow
Im 'bout to blow
Nobody believed me couple monthes ago
They say living gets harder but I dont Know
Cause ever since a kid I been on the road
You can tell Im on my way now
Yeah you can tell im on my way, now
I been all around the world boarding flights and chasing dreams
Really not much more to say, Now...

Verse 2:

Say my prayers before the plane lands
Never satisfied with the same plans
I put my heart in my music then watch it change hands
Never seeing my haters got on my Ray Bans
Doing that 'Ye dance
Its a shame that they can't
Understand the circumstances of my past
Like the game is getting foggy and dark
Guess Im the flashlight
Then watch me flash bright
My grind is past the half-pipe
They call me ""Button-up"" baby you know my swags right
You better act right cause I been on a chase
In the race against time its my watch that I would face
But before including time zones please understand my pace
Work my ass off to make it
And baby I found my place

(Hook)



Lifestyles of the young and talented
Leave it to blogs to say what talent is
They got no muscle involved just straight peralises
Lifes got some challenges but nothing that I can't beat
Sleep is the cousin of death dont mess with family
But they been sleeping on the kid for too long
Steady running in my dreams sleeping with my shoes on
Jordan 1's on my feet though my head is too gone
Got the bases loaded up yall steady asking ""whose on?""
Well that'd be me
See actually Im too strong
Batteries In back of me
Just Baffle me to move on
Had the faculty on half a ""G""
You tell me whose wrong
Stack my cheese on my bread someone pass me the poupon!

Thug life
When it's on it's on

One of these days I'll, learn
Don't fuck with trick ass niggas
Cause they, turn
Into bitch ass niggas
I'm sick of being stuck in the county jail
My niggas clown, bring a pound when they're postin' bail
Smokin' blunts in the driveway
My 4-5 screamin', ""fuck the police"" won't fly away
Thug 'til I die, you wonder why I'm made this way
I wasn't turned out, I was raised this way
I'm thinkin' these, are the dreams of a young teen
Scheme, and stack green over crack fiends
One time can't hold me
One of these days, we gotta bust back for the homies
Locked down in the penitentiary
I'll finally lose my mind if the pigs succeed
I'm stressed, smokin' weed and nicotine
But what a nigga really need is Thorazine
Right before I die, I'll be cursin' the law
Reincarnated bitch, even worse than before
My 4-4's givin' payback
My underhanded plan to get them niggas while they laid back
And Big Stretch hit the scene with the mini 14
Servin' suckas like dope fiends and lead the whole team

Never run, throw your gun in the air, oh yeah
Nigga bust ain't no time to spare
Causin' ruckus mothafucker and we fuck shit up
And with the stainless steel razors, boy, we cut shit up
Flash and blast a nigga with the quickness
Cock the 4-pound motherfucker when I spit this and rip this
Damn, my mind is in the depths of hell
But when I'm walkin' on the street kid my name rings bells
And I never fell, nigga, I stand too tall
I'm just a thug motherfucker who was born to brawl
Givin' my all, some niggas wanna bring it to me
So I'ma sell my cocaine, and lay their ass down, G

Runnin' wild, I never smiled as a juvenile
Even now, I keep a frown when I come around
Don't ask me about the past, it was all bad
Shots blasted, will I last in the wrong path?
In the dark is where my heart saw the most grief
Motherfuckas is gettin' shanked over gold teeth
Am I sick cause I'm addicted to get splifted?
Watchin' stupid ass tricks get lifted
Nothing's changed cause in the game it's a steady aim
Fuck friends, 'cause in the danger them niggas change
Puff weed and stuff G's in my sock, G
Car keys and Hennessy, where the Glock be?
Times passin', will I last here another day?
I put my gun away and grab my AK
It's gettin' hectic, I can't call it

[Verse 1: Del the Funky Homosapien as Deltron Zero]
Yo, Deltron thunderforce, ain't no other source
Of sunlight, two ton mic, leave you tongue-tied
Runnin' amok with technology with no apology
Shout it out to my colony with 3rd eye physiology
Millennium past apocalypse is all I spit
Make you swallow it, your weak style, I'll abolish it
With nuclear rockets stay glued to your optics with sci-fi
Unsettlin' man and metal blends
Underground chillin' with the mole man and his whole fam
Inhibit bacteria growth, material growth
Impenetrable, incontestable indigestible
Intelligence, never let a computer tell me shit
It's rapping innovation, penetrating
Artificial life forms, who bite songs
I'ma buy a Vex, lye is next, then I flip the bio-techs
Right into the wireless, your 3rd eye is hit with
Psoriasis, the mightiest, Deltron Zero
Traverse and purged, the travesties, that tempts your ear holes
The area of distribution, lifts the clueless
My flow is like, liquid oxygen, rip it often with
Specific impulse, increase the thrust, grease the cuts
Unleash a cluster of thoughts, I muster
I talk to touch ya', and rupture commercial communications
Convert solar-energy, into imagery
In the minds eye, blind side the contagious
With radioactive isotopes, to decay them
Atomic mass, they small as fragments
I magnetize the avid lies, my radiation shields
Reflect, rejects Decepticons
Who take the truth, and stretch it long, while I bless the song
Next level incredible, metal melding
Flexibility and my engine is never failing
[Chorus: Susan Jacks]
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do

[Verse 2: Del the Funky Homosapien as Deltron Zero]
All your rhyme histories combined couldn't violate
The prime Optimus operative, use my hydrometer
To see how warm you are, watch me form a star
Hydrogen turned to helium when I shine
Riding 'em revealing 'em leading 'em to the vacuum
Interact with tunes in my digital citadel
Critical pivotal with the mental shit on you
Spit infinity hidden energies too dope
For our planet, star spanning slamming hymns
With mechanical limbs, scanning your lens
With cosmic rays, you'll all get played, your brain's inferior
I hit the lateral and posterior
My science is eerier, ionic bonding
For your moronic pondering, meet the Armorines
My micro machines might throw your team into
Paralysis, they not talented, just a malady
Worry 'bout a salary, creative casualty
Couldn't defrag my power density intensity
Nonequivalence, nine hundred Newtons
Crush you like croutons, you plus you, son
Hiero's like dipoles inside a silo
Turbulence tenfold, never simple
Defies accepted methods development
Most unique, paralyze central nervous when you close to me
Interstellar void fills with color, appears to bubble
And split into four like amoeba
Inhabitin' planets with grandiose boasts
They coast like silver surfer, feel the purpose
High velocity verbal atrocities
Fire resistance, better hire assistance
My pistons glisten ultra high performance
Inside your private quarters where I fry your components
[Chorus: Susan Jacks]
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do"
50 Ways to Make a Record,Kid Cudi,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
You sit and think about how you can hit the scene
Take one look inside your mirror, clear to see
You need to find yourself as honest as can be
There must be fifty ways to make a record
Now don't get wrapped into the hype and what they think
This shit ain't rocket science and the scene changes with beats
And now you ask yourself, how you want to be seen?
There must be fifty ways to make a record
He's up inside the clubs, they like to lean and rock, oh
Stands around and looks intrigued by what he saw, now he asks me
How he can make hit songs to reach the top
There must be fifty ways to make a record
Fifty ways to make a record

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi & Paul Simon]
You got talent and your soul cannot be bought
He looked and smiled at me and told me ""Thanks a lot""
See, I could use your help
And would you please explain about the fifty ways?
It's kind of easy if you have a open mind
This game is more than spending money and fuckin' dimes
It's all within your words, some shit that outlives time
There must be fifty ways to make a record
Fifty ways to make a record"
Jungle,Andre Nickatina & Equipto,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Nickatina]
Pain from a rap cat
Man you didn't know that
3 AM, man, we bumping Bobby Womack
My homie keep all his bullets hollow
That's why I smell like Salvatore Ferragamo with the diamond sparrow
A rap cat with the BOSS apparel
I put my rhymes on your block then I run it just like little Darrell
Money and dope, man, don't come for free
Man, I don't have no competition, ho, all I got is enemies
I turn around like a tornado
Rock you like a baby grand
Call me Doctor J if you a baller and it's getting fatal
I make MC's do angel dust
Take 'em to the Bay Bridge, make 'em strip, tell 'em jump
I don't know why I get high
I'm so in love with money I keep spending 'til it runs dry
Hot like a kettle, when the pedal hit the metal
Pinocchio you know son of Gepetto, hello
Deep fried just like Friday fish
A lot a hot sauce, now we got it popping in this bitch
[Verse 2: Equipto]
Yeah, in anything I do I put my everything
Always feel it deep inside just like Mary J
Ha, I'm never panicing, I'm bored stiff as a mannequin
Grew up fast just like Anakin
Baby is gullible, as Alice in Wonderland
All the excuses in the world I can't understand
Cause I'm a man of these times, demand to get high
Blow big with my closest family ties
Ain't no way to intervene in my industry
Moving quicker then a centipede on enemies
One of a kind, once in a lifetime rhymes is written
It goes on, as long as time commences

[Chorus: Nickatina]
Shit, it's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
When they hit me with the thunder and lightning
Its trifling, enlightening, and frightening
Some might think that it's even exciting

[Verse 3: Nickatina]
I'm like a Harley Davidson motorcycle, born to ride
With the force that the courts call the last Jedi
I'm like a veteran, off Excedrins
Cause I be getting headaches from these Letterman's
I asked this little freak about my rap style
She said, ""It's so damn dope they might take you to trial.""
I hit the weed like I'm kamikaze next to the cosmos
Chopping up shit, yeah, with Quipto and Vago
Raps like a Tommy gun, watch how the body run
Raps from the Tommy gun will make anybody run
[Verse 4: Equipto]
I'm bout to go in like a movie, but no stunt double so parachute me
But somehow I feel I survived on a fluke, see
I have to hit the scene, livin' out my dreams
Then I said I was sorry to DJ's and MC's
Complete to everyone who kept their ear to the street
Then my homie came through with the Al Capone Suite
Got twice as deep, don't forget, you know how low they get
Intimidating so I pose a threat
Coming like a slider, right by ya
Known to drop a rhyme in on time, and prescribing accurate alignment
The center of attention, we'll bend a agenda
To enter this rap game the number one contender
The outta sight, and dope lyrical white, and watchin' tricks fightin'
Hyping up the crowd late night, and watching Tennessee Titans
Everybody just loving because we like and
I strike in first class light fast, just like lightning

[Pre-Chorus: Nickatina]
I force my rhymes in your veins like hot shot of heroin
You'll got cold turkey trying to work me
It's like a pad lock, when you in the headlock
Six in the morning and you didn't hear the Feds knock

[Chorus: Nickatina]
Shit, it's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
When they hit me with the thunder and lightning
Its trifling, enlightening, and frightening
Some might think that it's even exciting
[Verse 5: Equipto]
I'm consistent, adding on statistics
Why don't we cover the spread like the bitch never existed
Phonographic rotate the plastic spinning
Living like I'm knowing it's gonna be a drastic ending
Playing classics, meditating these tactics to overcome
The show is done, anticipating to roll a blunt
Baby, getting anxious, hitting and I can't miss the focal point
When locals say, ""He ain't shit.""
Man it's Equipto, put it all down for my homies
And rolling my weed right next to the police
Nothing but love for all my homeboys hustling drugs
Up in your program fucking it up

[Verse 6: Nickatina]
I'm in the fast lane, the cash lane, some think it's a bad thing
Hitting 'em off with the C&H pure cane
I get stuck in your membrane
I'm like a pimp at a party when you say ""Look at them rings.""
I use a Motorola, to move this baking soda
Whether it's in Denver, man, Houston, man, or North Dakota
With no apology, tech-tech-tech technology
Some brother disin' me, or even thinkin' he
I got the soul and the spirit of the wrath of Kahn
Kick back and write just like the holy Koran

[Chorus: Nickatina x2]
Shit, it's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
When they hit me with the thunder and lightning
Its trifling, enlightening, and frightening
Some might think that it's even exciting"

Staring at my finest pendents, will probably mess up your vision
Females payin' me visits, I'm tryna keep it explicit
Now Tell me who the hottest. Nigga, step in my closet
You might wanna change the topic, I'm the freshest without a stylist
Yes I'm just being honest, Just pass her I'll do the honors
Beat it, then I leave it. They call me Mr. Muhhammad

Yeah, I'm done with here. You can scratch that ho off my list

She say she flyer than a pidgeon, well I got a big ego
Never, Back down from Nothin'
No time for duckin', I can make something out of nothing
I'm a beast, who made the mistake of lettin me off the leash
Smashin the beat up, Now who washing the bedsheats

Please take a seat, watch me make it do just what it do
Don't suggest that you try me, you might end up on the news
I'm down the road to success, I suggest that you move
Shootin for the stars, My mistake if it hits you!

You need to know who you fucking with now
Now kill-a-kill again ain't nobody stopping this now
Now who want what we got
Real deal hip-hop, even with my shit chop
You need to know who you fucking with now
Now kill-a-kill again, ain't nobody stopping this now
When you listen to my shit you don't chew, you don't breathe
You don't miss a fucking line

[Verse 1] -- Reef the Lost Cauze
Motherfucking classic
I'm an animal, yeah a lot like a monkey
And my pride is too sick, dawg you not gonna chump me
And my squad is too thick, you not gonna jump me
I'll knock you over fucking wall like Humpty Dumpty
I'm the king of the castle, king of the battle
I'll dumb out like King when he gamble
And I'm classic like LL's Kangol
Overseas running the streets with Hells Angels
You at home, playing with Wii
Nintendo, negro stop playing with me
I am the best, c'mon say it with me
Fuck rappers, Reef is my favorite MC, word
I'm an only comp, you'll get stolen, stomped
You's a mama's boy, your bitch still folds your socks
You don't want beef and I'm so shocked
My niggas can't hold jobs, they just know to hold Glocks
It's not my fault I spaz a lot
What you expect? I came up under Paz and 'Mach
Came from behind, Taji, Tariq, and Koran
City of Philly, I am the evil of spine
Yeah, I'm bad news
Especially when you see me with the white boy with tattoos
We'll fucking smash you
It's Lost Cauze, illegal with the Snowgoons
You ain't know I'll be back, banging you so soon

This is where the fun stops
This is purple haze, drunk rock
This is knife wounds and gun shots
This shit here, vulgar and trife
The words that I write, the illest shit you heard in your life
This is where the fun stops
This is purple haze, drunk rock
This is knife wounds and gun shots
This shit here, vulgar and trife
The words that I write, the illest shit you heard in your life, word

[Reef the Lost Cauze:]
Well maybe not, but I'm crazy hot
And the world is mine, but the baby's not
Always lighting up drugs, wilding in the club
I'm not grown and sexy, I'm childish and smugs
Stay in ya lane stupid or drink brain fluid
Niggas in Philly trying to be the next Frank Lucas
We don't talk out our problems, we banging through it
And Crypt is my Blood, but we ain't gang-influenced
I'm in the Dodge with Plan', trying to dodge the man
Trying to get rich, what part of the plan don't you comprehend, Einstein?
Don't need to repeat, just say my name one time
And I will be there to spit your frame
I rock you stalagmites, crystal cave
I'll break ya arms, then start ordering shots like
Jägerbombs, Jägerbombs, Jägerbombs, Jägerbombs

[Outro] -- Reef the Lost Cauze
Yeah, Snowgoons, Reef the Lost Cauze
We like three for three right now, batting about a hundred
You motherfuckers suck
That's why you can't come over here and record shit
Nobody wants you; you don't need to get a fucking passport
There's no reason
Me? I'm worldwide bitch, I'm all over this motherfucker
I might pop up in motherfucking Sweden one day and motherfucking UK the next
Germany, Switzerland, and then be back in Philly on the block like I ain't got shit
Cause you niggas will not rob me
Call me what you will, just don't call me
And don't call Stress neither
Yeah, all of a sudden right you got love for us now right?
Take a number, just not mine
Lost Cauze, I'll see y'all in '08

Know what I'm saying? I'm bilingual... one!

Let It Rock,Kevin Rudolf,"['dance', 'rock', 'hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Kevin Rudolf]
I see your dirty face, hide behind your collar
What is done in vain, truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God to justify the way
You live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well, you made your bed
I made mine

[Chorus: Kevin Rudolf]
Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

[Verse 2: Kevin Rudolf]
Now the son's disgraced, he who knew his father
When he cursed his name, turned and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart, so he stuck his middle finger
To the world, to the world, to the world
And you take your time
And you stand in line
Well, you'll get what's yours
I got mine
[Chorus: Kevin Rudolf]
Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Yeoaw!
Wayne's World, Planet Rock
Panties drop, and the tops
And she gonna rock 'til the camera stop
And I sing about angels like Angela
(Rock!) And Pamela
(Rock!) And Samantha
(Rock!) And Amanda
And Tamara, ménage à moi
I'm in here like, ""Bitch, what's up?""
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can dick you up, I can dick you down
Shorty, we can go wherever, just pick a town
And my jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big-ass rocks like on the ground
Dirty like socks that's on the ground
Weezy

[Chorus: Kevin Rudolf]
Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Just let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Let it rock
Let it rock

I'm back like I forgot somethin', I'm somethin'
Ruling rock rubbin' rap running
Miles like I'm trying to get a flat stomach
Like Wayne the personal trainer
My aim is perfect, I'll bang ya
Period, like the reminder

And I wish I could say the things you do

Fuck Love,"Tyler, The Creator","['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1]
The only girl I ever loved
Fucked some nigga that I really hate
And the funny part about it that we didn't even date
But at the end she could still say she got her pussy ate
Yummy her in her tummy, pour out cause
Cummy in her bummy means that a little me being coming
So I let her blow my flute and start humming, bitch's brewin'
But that wasn't bubble gum that she was chewin'
Our relationship was like my music, chopped up, screwed up
Made her sick threw up, I gave her everything that wasn't enough
So I put two up, I'm hot, she cool, I call it a blue crush
We fucked, no kiss, that's it, fuck love
Snort drugs, make songs, go skate, daily life
Sarah or Dorothy, which one to make my wife
Or maybe I'll just marry both of them bitches, maybe twice

I was in love, but fuck it

Dorothy, my everything

Man, I know we had a lot of tragedies lately
I just wanna say rest in peace to Aaliyah
Rest in peace to Left Eye
Rest in peace to Jam Master Jay
And everybody lost in the Twin Towers
And everybody lost period
All we got is hope

[Verse 1: Twista]
I wish the way I was living could stop, serving rocks
Knowing the cops is hot when I'm on the block, And I
Wish my brother woulda made bail
So I won't have to travel 6 hours to see him in jail, And I
Wish that my grandmother wasn't sick
Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick, And I (I wish)
Wish my homies wouldn't have to suffer
When the streets get the upper hand on us and we lose a brother, And I
Wish I could go deep in a zone
And lift the spirits of the world with the words with in this song, And I (I wish)
Wish I could teach us all to fly
Take away the pain out cha hands and help you hold them high, And I
Wish God never gave the men power
To be able to hurt the people inside the Twin Towers, And I (I wish)
Wish God woulda turned they hearts righteous
When they started to take innocent lives and become snipers, But uh
We will never break, though they devastate, we shall motivate
And we gotta pray, all we got is faith
Instead of thinking about who gonna die to day
The Lord is gonna help you feel better, so you ain't gotta cry today
Sit at the light so long
And then we gotta move straight forward, cuz we fight so strong
So when right go wrong
Just say a little prayer, get ya money man, life goes on

I wish that you could show some love
Instead of hatin so much when you see some other people comin up (I wish)
I wish I could teach the world to sing
Watch the music and have 'em trippin off the joy I bring, (shiit)
I wish that we could hold hands
Listen instead of dissin lessons from a grown man, And I (I wish)
Wish the families that lack, but got love, get some stacks
Brand new shack and a lack that's on dubs, And I
Wish we could keep achieving wonders
See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder, (you feel me) (I wish)
And I hope all the kids eat
And don't nobody in my family see six feet, (ya dig)
I hope them mothers staying strong
You can make it whether you wit him or your man's gone, And I (I wish)
Wish I could give every celly some commissary
And the po po bring the heat on them priests like they did R. Kelly
And I wish that D.O.C. could scream again
And bullets could reverse so Pac and Biggie breath again, (shit) (I wish)
Then one day they could speak again
I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN
I wish that enemies could talk

Wish the earth wasn't so apocalyptic
I try to spread my message to the world the best way I can give it
We can make it always so optimistic
If you don't listen gotta live my life the best way I can live it
I pray for justice when we go to court
Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war
Why can't we kick it and just get em on
And in the famous words of Mr. King ""Why can't we all just get along""
Or we can find a better way to shop and please, And I
Hope we find a better way to cop a keys, And I
Wish everybody would just stop and freeze
And ask way are we fulfillin these downfalls and prophecies
You can be wrong if it's you doubting
With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains
And only the heavenly father and ease the hurt
Just let it go and keep prayin on your knees in church
And let's hope

And this is going up when you see me in my skirt
When they see me, I go urr, leave them bitches in the dirt
When they see me, they go “ohh, yeah, bitch there puts in work”
And I’m fucking with the P (?), so I make that pussy squirt
Squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt, I’mma make that pussy squirt
If you want it, come and get it, you can have it for dessert
You can eat it with some cherries like you eating Ben and Jerry’s

I'm the one you sent to the emergency
I'm the one who text you it's urgent please
Call back, and you reply ""Fall Back""
With a bunch of LOLs you typed in all caps
And I'm like ""Aww snap is this who I dealt with?
Such immaturity on this slim pelvis?""
You split, and shit I'm selfish?
You head to the next dude crib, he felt it
He paid 40 bucks to the dick she sells it
And now he's irritated like Hitch with the shellfish
Tell this to wife ""We will never get married""
Cause I was runnin' game like Larry to a Bird
Who can score alot of points
While she dribbles on my balls
But she go home with the green like Celtics
[Chorus]
(Oh, hey ho!)
Do you remember me? (Oh) Oh (Hey ho!)
I bet you don't don't (Oh, hey ho!)
It's just the pimp in me, (Oh) oh (Hey ho!)
A different me, for you

[Verse 3: 88-Keys]
They say sticks and stones will break some bones
But am I in the wrong? I piss ""come on""
I bitch and moan but I won't call you up bitch in this song
Cause you ain't feelin' that pain
You play a lot of games
So I call out your name like Paul Revere, for all to hear
But I had to chill on the curse so I (Love)
On this verse just so I could get the sample cleared

[Hook]
(Oh, hey ho!)
Do you remember me? (Oh) Oh (Hey ho!)
I bet you don't don't (Oh, hey ho!)
It's just the pimp in me (Oh) Oh (Hey ho!)
A different me, for you

[Outro]
So, you remember that girl that burnt Adam?
She shows up at his apartment about four weeks later
Talkin' about ""Feel my stomach!""
""I'm havin' your baby! We're gonna be a family! I love you!""
Adam's like: ""Love me? I'm not even sure if I like you"""

The NHS is not for sale you grey haired manky codger

[Verse 1]
So the budget of the PCTs
He wants to hand to the GP’s
Oh please. Dumb geeks are gonna buy from any willing provider
Get care from private companies
They saw the pie and they want a piece
Got their eyes on the P’s like mice for the cheese
I talk truth when I ride the beat
You talk shite when you speak
See money when you close your eyes to sleep. So fall back
Your face looks like a shrivelled up ball sack
The stuff that you chat is bull crap
I’m sure Andy Pandy snorts crack
Health minister, I mean sinister
You know your public will finish ya, is your brain really that miniature?
Give yourself an enema. Made filthy rich
By those who represent Walkers Crisps
Mars and Pizza Hut, proved your a health slutand your always talking shit
A hundred and thirty four pound an hour every week
That’s quite a lot of quids
And you came to the conclusion that
The food industry should be a little less strict
Scandal disclosed that you flipped your second home
You said your claims were within the rules
Filled your pockets, took us for jokes
So how would you cope when broke folk get ill
Injured and broke, but don’t have the dough
To get their life back on the road, so poor die slow, and the rich …"
Feel Love Drake Version,Sean Garrett,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","[Verse 1: Sean Garrett]
Junior high, played 'em
High school, played 'em
College, well, you know, played 'em
Me and my friends used to laugh about it, how we fade 'em
Now cupid’s aiming his arrow right there at me
No more nonchalance can I be, with you here starring at me
With the most beautiful eyes that a nigga ever seen
You pull an emotional vibe from my soul, look at me
You got my heart beating like my back is filled with batteries

[Chorus: Sean Garrett & Drake]
For the first time I’m in love
And I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody (what im feeling)
For the first time I feel love
And I wanna tell everybody
And I wanna tell everybody

All them men before me did shit I would never do
And I know you got your guards up, but they should let him through
Just keep fightin' for our lovin' baby, I'll defend it too
And if they try and tell me time is money I'd spend it with you
I spend it all
I spend it all
I charge forever, to my card
And pay it off, no interest lost
I be right here, and like your favorite wine girl
I'm worth trying, but take it easy on me
Cuz this my first time

For the first time I’m in love
And I wanna tell everybody

I ain’t never looked into a woman’s eye worth of fire
Bet I’m feelin' while you holdin’ me begging to take you higher
For so long I wasn’t faded, I couldn’t admitted before
But now I see what life’s about, and i’m never goin’ let you go
Girl I’m growin’ don’t wanna be selfish, I wanna be more accountable
I see us growing don’t wanna miss out on a feeling I never had before
I got to tell the world, somebody gotta know
What you'd have done to me, I gotta let ’em know

For the first time I’m in love
And I wanna tell everybody

Letter To Pun,Cuban Link,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","What up twin

Im just sittin back man thinking about all the good times we had
Theres a lot of things been going on since you been gone
I just thought it was time for me to sit down and write you a letter
You know what I am sayin, a letter from the heart

Yo, yo
Before I take a shot, I always make a toast to the sky
Blow somesmoke in the air so we both can get high
At night I hold my rosarys tight and hope to get by
Close my eyes and ask the lord why he chose you to die
Though, I believe in God, I chose my own road cause of pride
I dont abide to no bible cause most of them lie
Lifes like a roller coaster ride, just try to hold on and drive
Its all about surviving, one day we all gonna die
I tried to hide all these feelings I was holding inside
Cause they always told me thugs ain't suppose to cry
And show their emotional side
But, it soaked up my eyes
Cause I never had nobody really close to me die
Couldn't understand it at first, so how do this work
You were just here full of cheer, now I'm following your hearse
Its outta this earth, I felt like I was damned with a curse
Had to light candle in church to handle the hurt
In retrospect, I always respect the man that you were
A man of your word that always put his family first
With talent superb all you wanted was to be heard
And You got your chance all of your fans are proud of your work
You made it outta of the dirt and got on top of the world
But you still stood in the hood with your son and two little girls
You in iced out chains, your wife was rockin the pearls
You lived a ghetto fabulous life, the Bronx was your borough
And when the fame came you never changed. You kept it so thorough
We did the same thing, poppin champagne to we earled
You shocked the world, twin, every time you rapped on a track
You had cats like How this fat dude could flow like that?
Is he black? Is he packin the mack in the back of the acc?
The only Spanish rapper to snatch up a platinum plaque
Thats a fact. Its been written in stones, from here to Rome
When it comes to spittin them poems. You sit on the throne
I wish you was home. Life is so different alone
Spoke to Liza and the kids, little Chris is so grown
He's your own spitting image. It's just like you were cloned
You know I treasure Manda and Sesha, like they were my own
Lizas still tryin to get it together
She had your back through the stormy weather
For that, I will never forget her
Times are tougher then leather
As for me, things could be better
I needed to clear my head up
Thats why I had to write you this letter
Since you been gone, Joe's been stronger then ever, still with Lorena
How can he go to bed knowing hes stealin your cheddar?
About a mil or better. To me hes as real as pleather
We built this together. Still, in all he had me set up
I should of known better
I let it ride for too long
Let it slide for too long
Let it hide for too long
Now I am tryin to move on
Without tryin to do wrong
But my pride is too strong
Im a ride through the storm
With a hundred troops strong
No bullet-proofs on
Glocks cocked and locked and ready to shoot form
Im just tryin to put you on twin, to whats going on
A lot of back stabbin since you been gone
A lot of whack rappin comin from the so-called Don
A lot of black ballin happenin. No matter twin, I'm still going strong
Tonys still singin songs, tryin to swing it along
Hes no longer foundation, sayin Joe put him on
Hes dead wrong
Armeggedion still ain't on
Prospect- back in the projects, livin with moms
Words born
Remys the realist, she know what the deal is
Feelin like there is still a chance wishin you could come and heal us
But the thrill is gone, I'm no longer part of that
Im back where I started at
Thats where my heart is at
Cause God knows how hard I scrap
To try to keep it from this
I been a team player, he chose to play at his own risk
Sunkiss still comes around, we still get down
We puff a pound whenever Chuck and C come into town
Toom is illin, hes down in Orlando makin a killin
Buildin his own army with soldiers, ready and willin
Me and Seis still be chillin
Hes fine as well
Still rhymin, still grindin, only time will tell
Gillys stressed out, tryin to figure out his next route
Feelin left out
No more T.S, he checked out
Xed out his tattoos , but he still got you
B is still with me. Full A Clips our old school crew
He stayed true, always been the coolest nigga we knew
Boobys up in the videos with you know who
You was the glue to the puzzle, the key to the struggle
The reason I even chose to be in this hustle
Twin, I love you
No matter what or who tries to judge you
Theres nothing worst than family and friends tryin to fuck you
I stuck through it all, and this is what it all lead up to
Its the closest ones to you that will stick it in and cut you
So much for being humble. I'm comin through with the shovels
Tombstones and all, and turn the hard rocks to rubble
On the double, so you can be at peace with your troubles
Cause even after death, you stress from all these scuffles
Guzzle the liquor, snuffing walls till theres blood on my knuckles
Watchin the devil chuckle, hopin I break down and buckle
In this jungle, its all about survival of the fittest
Though you died, you never rid us
Twin your still alive in spirit. I can feel it
I know your up in heaven right now
Hangin out in thugs mansion. You and Pac, whilin out
Livin the kings lifestyle, with platinum wings iced out
Bet you and Biggie in the Angels lounge, poppin Crystal
Getting high with Freaky Tah, lightin up white owls
Thuggin it out with Big L, rollin dice on the clouds
Aaliyah, smilin down. Left Eye is still type wild
Buggin out, partyin, every bodys up in the house
You kickin freestyles while Master J hypes up the crowd
Ain't no fights breakin out, its all love right now
Im just writing down how I feel hopin you hear me
Puttin my heart and soul in it, so you can see it all clearly
I hold you dearly in my thoughts cause like you theres no other
Sincerely Yours, Cuban Link, your twin your brother
Baby I love you!
[Outro]
I still got your back twin
Your brothers here
You even got your own day up in the Bronx
We on top of the world
Yeah I'm a ride with you baby
Ill always ride with you til the day I die
Thats my word"

She told me to hit it and split it and get up off her
(Ease back) just a little softer
I'm the one that be drivin' them crazy, out of their brains
So give me a peak of your areola out of your Hanes
'Cause she got thighs on her, look at the size on her
Big ol' shake like she need fries on her
Wanna see ya in ya boustier (Swoop ya)
See ya in a group and say ""Hey!""

Don't know what I'm talkin' 'bout
That circle around the skittle

Seen her lookin' prettier than Vogue
Tooken over by an unadulterated player
Way to get up in the middle
'Til I pan up at them jugs
Now I'm thinkin' about the little bitty circles
Decorated all around the nipple
With that badonk, it come with those tig ol' big o's
You see your firm breasticles
I got a big ol' buddy inside of my skimmies, you need
Just thought that I would let you know
So if you want to

Just as long as you let me
Suck and touch on those titties, baby

Take the Vickie shit off
You know it popped off her
Now I know she ready to get it knocked off
Kissed the areola and she said that it's gon' cost ya
I ain't givin up the money, you know it
I'm a certified playa and I'm sumn' like a pimp
Ask ya mama
She could tell ya that Tecca Ninna's a bonafide layer
Get ya walkin with a limp
And you know it got tore owa-owa up
Tecca Ninna hit and it swole owa-owa up
Never owa dove for the owa-owa butt
Owa yo, don't you know I'm a owa-owa nut?
I made a song about your areola
Go on and let ya bra fall right off ya shoulders
If you ain't got no titties, baby
You better hold up

On This I Stand,Eyedea & Abilities,"['hip hop', 'r&b']","On this I stand
Two sets of footprints placed ahead of the dirt softened from tear drops
And overlooking the earth as the son of the moon
Protected by a forcefield of pure thought.. On this I stand
A rally of unemployed disgruntled words spawned from long journeys through somewhere
Somewhere that only causes me pain as I strain my soul crammin it with (light?)
So I could bring some there
I bleed the blood of a cold stone that roams without a shadow
I'm only deep enough to realize that I'm shallow
My head I keep it up but its hard to keep it straight
When you don't believe in love
And you just can't cope with hate
Metal rust, leaves turn into dust
As the difference between love and lust clarifies as trust
If you only had an hour to sum your whole life up
Would you spend that hour sayin that an hour ain't enough
I've escaped the shell that bound me to cowardice
Now I'm faithful to the wind but compared to it I'm powerless
The first step was made, and it was a fair accomplishment
The pond was sittin still, so I threw a rock in it
And as my reflection rippled it all became clear
The seasons always change so there's no reason for fear
We made an autobiography of our pivotal years
Its all I got and I'm giving it you because I care
See, a lot of the time humans as artists exist in a self-projected state of falsehood
We're either too close to our image to stay objective in our perception
Or too far away to be subjective in any matter
This only widens the void in social conformity
Introduced to our souls at birth, and so I write
I don't write without the intention of objectivity
Or attention on the image
But only as an omni-directional bridge
Between the several (floating, tunnel structured?)
Realities present in comparable space and time
See I don't write for the future
I write about the future, for the present
I write with my past, about the future, for the present
On this I stand
The oasis of a limbo adjacent to my generation, facing out the window
Waiting for some ventilation, patient while the wind blows
Graceful in its demonstration, overall innovation
On this I stand
A fountain of youth sovereignty, (found in?) 1000 syllables more than a pound of flesh
Deep breath of achievement, a dream and a wake up call
Another haul of the quest
On this I stand
A letter to civilization
On this I stand
The purity of creation
On this I stand
A paradigm for self
On this I stand
I thank you for your help
On this I stand
My first born child
On this I stand
Something for now
On this I stand
Life, love, death and hate
On this I stand
An album, glad you could relate
Peace..."
Facemelter,Aesop Rock,"['hip hop', 'alternative', 'r&b']","Blazin' with a facemelter
Go fish
Pigeon, itching for a pit to put the pig in
Scalped, bottom feeder, nose bleeder, cheap seats
To the meat eater sweeps sweet freak freaks
What up?
Grip clicker, smack the dummy box fix picture
Stickle over shit, cinema flicker in the plasma
The latch key degree was obtained in the savage years
Where he learned the binding of a wire hanger to rabbit ears
Every pixel that leaked dead over the carpet
Had to be spit shinned and hidden before the ford duster parketh
When mommy marched in, wrapped the broccoli in the napkin
For your electric paradisio after the parent crashes
And I'm high on ion jitters, call it a prime directive of the damned
Who grew to sleep easy to white noise
The humming of the machinery running towards them crawl
Social retardation larvey plugged into the wall
The little short circuit with the still born vibe
Till the villagers circled and determined ""it is alive""
Shipped to Bellevue eyes fuzzy talking funny
Like ""eagle one to grey squirrel whats your twenty dunny?""
I piss clumsy with electrode head pan (sorry)
Pitty the pretty internet gotta empty the bed pan
Left hand numb from the finger to the thumb (right!)
Right got tubes in it, irony is fun (yaaay!!)
At some point early when drunk on electric kisses
I'd apparently notarized forms excusing scalpel slippage (sign this)
The pain came on a makeshift main stage
And sentenced to in an inoperable eight bit frame rate
For that I made a game play, reborn torn
At the ministry of information trying to get informed
They'll duck it out and I will cease all wars
So if you babysit a Carroll Ann be fore warned
I be the ultimate (ultimate), multi polar
Mobile medicine cabinet stocked adequate
Pockets like maracas, that will shake when he stepped
Which explains the circle of rattlesnakes where he slept
Smarter then the average bear, barter parts and gadgets
With battery op enthusiast pardon the barking badgers
While you were parking daggers in kittens with snarling children
I was sharking classes with taggers for television (Click!)
Gattaca days, Attica paper scattered
Diagonal mahogany boggled the train savage
To boxed the botanically inclined child slave labor
Blades clipped the perfect petal now play later
Play never, if escaped raped treasure
That's a jewel freebie out a old geezer, no teether
Or even yesteryear scrapes fester, administer gauze
But cauterized wounds bleed if you ain't ethered the cause
King of applause (yay!) beats the garbage flood for ten(?)
Porn king of New York, alley punk perv scum
Waddle on the voyage of the voyeur
Six four sick king breezer sniff whores through brick
I am so dangerous evil and mercy heaven
Allergy to compassion he is the perfect weapon
Un- earth it and siphoned from Delorean doors swivel up
With aviator radar blip for most glorious titty fuck
Cool green over the frame under the clothes line
Whose crew choose fuel most, mine
Holy trinity, triple six, triple x, city barrack
Glutton for punishment super size me while you at it
He da:
Built hideous, silk of the milk litigant
Silly wicked finicky fidget the middle digit ish
Will he alter what he feel is illy to pick at every little smidgen of integrity
As your industry bitch? NO
Final answer, track the moniker
To the freight hot reaking of butter beans and harmonica
Dirty old man no tea cup thirst, peak up skirts
For slaps from that d-cup nurse
Cackle his old gums lewd (lewd), crass
Show the girl a trick like how he opens can food with the only tooth he has
She like THAT'S FUCKING DISGUSTING
They don't call him anabolic Aes for nothing, OK
Now current picture aside all anti-celebs remain aggro
Half mast the flag pole
Dead walk sturdy, but the day I greet the worms
I pull the daisies down with me as a fuck you to the norms
Generic's so unappealing and in my humble opinion
Defeats a rappers civic duty to the culture
Granted every topic has been covered but cookie cutter
Delivery of simpleton wit is the real culprit
So whether street, club, battle, conscious or other
I find that interesting style can often out weigh the subject
So when the disc changer goes from guns to space
It is not an attempt to fake credibility for the public
But fuck it it's ace rock six records of gibberish right?
He's trying too hard to be weird and different right? (riiiiight)
Or could it possibly just maybe be, his lessons
Can't be summed up in a linear set of pop culture references?
(WOW) yeah but why try, I'm so groggy
The mach nine Ballentine ain't for everybody
But I will say this to y'all that used your fifteen of fame
To mention my name, that sixteenth minute regret is fucking insane
And that's a longevity veteran peddling free medicine,(here)
Who the fouler howler (me) who the rabble rouser
What the happy hour starved the Peruvian aggy powder,(tight)
Trade up at the digital Jesus factory outlet (bout it, bout it)
Bout it bout it, fuck a fork tongue cutlery, the fuckery is famous
Never wild shook but a slang that maybe alienated a couple strangers
Held a mongoloid fanbase that is alien by nature
Robot wars, machines hit the floor
And the simians syncopated a gigantic ""encore""
