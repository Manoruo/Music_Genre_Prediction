Moon, a hole of light
Through the big top tent up high
Here before and after me
Shinin' down on me
Moon, tell me if I could
Send up my heart to you?
So, when I die, which I must do
Could it shine down here with you?

'Cause my love is mine, all mine
I love, my, my, mine
Nothing in the world belongs to me
But my love, mine, all mine, all mine

My baby here on earth
Showed me what my heart was worth
So, when it comes to be my turn
Could you shine it down here for her?

'Cause my love is mine, all mine
I love, my, my, mine
Nothing in the world belongs to me
But my love, mine, all mine
Nothing in the world is mine for free
But my love, mine, all mine, all mineSee Mitski LiveGet tickets as low as $26You might also like13Embed"

Yeah, yeah, um (Woo)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

That's the way every day goes
Every time we've no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
Still, I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Won't let you down when it's all ruin

Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love

If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it out when the sun is ruined

That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

Remember life, remember how it was
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, all ends here
Say what up to Matthew, to Shoob
Say what up to Danny
Say what up to life immortality

Running out of melpomene, nicotine
Stealing granny cigs (Take it easy)

Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh

No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine

Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy

His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone

I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
This text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I tried to ration with you, no murders or crime of passion, but damn

You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach

Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity

'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching?
(How do you lie? How do you lie? How do you lie?)
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will

But if you're too drunk to drive, and the music is right
She might let you stay, but just for the night
And if she grabs for your hand, and drags you along
She might want a kiss before the end of the song
Because love can burn like a cigarette
And leave you with nothin'

We were listenin' to Lover's Rock

She don't believe in shootin' stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's departments
You more like love to start shit
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancin' so sleazy
I get a call like, ""Where are you, Yeezy?""
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
'Til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than the Nazis
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know?

And if somebody would've told me a month ago
Frontin' though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody would've told me a year ago
It'll go get this difficult
Feelin' like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no Visa
First class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just sayin', ""Hey, Mona Lisa
Come home, you know you can't roam without Caesar""

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh, baby

If he will be, if he will be here

And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach, but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater, let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds, but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh

She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here and now
So let me hold both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one

But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite171Embed"

Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)

Uh, me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Hit the house lick: tell me, is you wit' it, ya bish? (Ya bish, ya bish)
Home invasion was persuasive (Was persuasive, was persuasive)
From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (Like rappers do, like rappers do)
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool (They wasn't cool, they wasn't cool)
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros (Tell my bros, tell my bros)
Then Usher Raymond ""Let It Burn"" came on (""Let Burn"" came on, ""Let Burn"" came on)

Park the car, then we start rhymin', ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
The only thing we had to free our mind (Free our mind, free our mind)
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs (See dollar signs, see dollar signs)
You lookin' like a easy come-up, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
A silver spoon, I know you come from, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew (We never knew, we never knew)
Go at a reverend for the revenue

It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all-day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's jus how I feel
Nah, nah

A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's jus' how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch

Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (Like rappers do, like rappers do)
Bump that new E-40 after school (Way after school, way after school)
You know, “Big Ballin' With My Homies” (My homies)

Back to reality, we poor, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Another casualty at war, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head (My Tony head, my Tony head)
He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
That Louis Burgers never be the same (Won't be the same, won't be the same)
A Louis belt that never ease that pain (Won't ease that pain, won't ease that pain)
But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin' (That day is jerkin', that day is jerkin')
Pull off at Church's, with Pirellis skirtin' (Pirellis skirtin', Pirellis skirtin')

You said you like my eyes and you like to make 'em roll
Treat me like a queen, now you got me feelin' thrown, oh

But I can't help myself when you get close to me
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like ""bleh-blah-blee""
I don't want no one else (No, no), baby, I'm in too deep
Here's a lil' song I wrote (A song I wrote), it's about you and me (Me)

I'll be honest
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
And when you got your arms around me
Oh, it feels so good
I had to jump the octave
I think I got an ex, but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill, I must've lost it
I don't even know, I'm talkin' nonsense
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (Ah-ah-ah-ah)

How do you do this to me?

But I can't help myself when you get close to me
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like ""bleh-blah-bleh-blee""

I'll be honest (Honest)
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense (Nonsense)
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in (When you walk in)

Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Man, it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought me some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbyeing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, and snow

How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really grab me tight

Get Him Back!,Olivia Rodrigo,"['rock', 'blues']","114 ContributorsTranslationsSvenskaTürkçeEspañolالعربيةFrançaisPortuguêsУкраїнськаDeutschItaliano​get him back! Lyrics
One, two, three
Wait, is this the song with the drums?

I met a guy in the summer, and I left him in the spring
He argued with me about everything
He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye
He said he's six-foot-two, and I'm like, ""Dude, nice try""
But he was so much fun, and he had such weird friends
And he would take us out to parties, and the night would never end
Another song, another club, another bar, another dance
And when hе said something wrong, he'd just fly me to Francе
So I miss him some nights when I'm feeling depressed
'Til I remember every time he made a pass on my friend
Do I love him? Do I hate him? I guess it's up and down
If I had to choose, I would say right now

I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge, and I want him again
I want to get him back, back, back

So I write him all these letters, and I throw them in the trash
'Cause I miss the way he kisses and the way he made me laugh
Yeah, I pour my little heart out, but as I'm hitting ""send""
I picture all the faces of my disappointed friends
Because everyone knew all of the shit that he'd do
He said I was the only girl, but that just wasn't the truth
And when I told him how he hurt me, he'd tell me I was trippin'
But I am my father's daughter, so maybe I could fix him

I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge, and I want him again
I want to get him back (And then? And then)
I want to get him back, back, back

I wanna key his car (I want to get him back)
I wanna make him lunch (But then I, I want to get him back; Woo)
I wanna break his heart (But then I, I want to get him back; Yeah, you got it)
Then be the one to stitch it up (But then I, I want to get him back; yeah)
Wanna kiss his face (But then I, I want to get him back)
With an uppercut (But then I, I want to get him back)
I wanna meet his mom (But then I, I want to get him back)
Just to tell her her son sucks (But then I, I want to get him back)

A job that slowly kills you

On the way home?

You got new icons
And from the outside
It looks like you're tryin' lives on
I miss the old ways
You didn't have to change
But I guess I don't have a say
Now that we don't talk

Or that I'd like to be on a mega yacht
