My Love Mine All Mine,Mitski,['rock'],"87 ContributorsTranslationsItalianoFrançaisPortuguêsEspañol日本語DeutschالعربيةTürkçeMy Love Mine All Mine Lyrics
Moon, a hole of light
Through the big top tent up high
Here before and after me
Shinin' down on me
Moon, tell me if I could
Send up my heart to you?
So, when I die, which I must do
Could it shine down here with you?

'Cause my love is mine, all mine
I love, my, my, mine
Nothing in the world belongs to me
But my love, mine, all mine, all mine

My baby here on earth
Showed me what my heart was worth
So, when it comes to be my turn
Could you shine it down here for her?

'Cause my love is mine, all mine
I love, my, my, mine
Nothing in the world belongs to me
But my love, mine, all mine
Nothing in the world is mine for free
But my love, mine, all mine, all mineSee Mitski LiveGet tickets as low as $26You might also like13Embed"

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

Yeah, yeah, um (Woo)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

That's the way every day goes
Every time we've no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
Still, I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Won't let you down when it's all ruin

Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above

If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it out when the sun is ruined

That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

Remember life, remember how it was
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, all ends here
Say what up to Matthew, to Shoob
Say what up to Danny
Say what up to life immortality

Running out of melpomene, nicotine
Stealing granny cigs (Take it easy)
Gimme something sweet

You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine

Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy

His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone

I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
This text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I tried to ration with you, no murders or crime of passion, but damn

You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach

Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity

'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching?
(How do you lie? How do you lie? How do you lie?)
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will

But if you're too drunk to drive, and the music is right
She might let you stay, but just for the night
And if she grabs for your hand, and drags you along
She might want a kiss before the end of the song
Because love can burn like a cigarette
And leave you with nothin'

We were listenin' to Lover's Rock

Flashing lights

She don't believe in shootin' stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's departments
You more like love to start shit
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancin' so sleazy
I get a call like, ""Where are you, Yeezy?""
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
'Til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than the Nazis
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know?

What do I know? Know

I know it's been a while, sweetheart
We hardly talk, I was doin' my thing
I know I was foul, baby
A-bay, lately, you've been all on my brain
And if somebody would've told me a month ago
Frontin' though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody would've told me a year ago
It'll go get this difficult
Feelin' like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no Visa
First class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just sayin', ""Hey, Mona Lisa
Come home, you know you can't roam without Caesar""

As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know?

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh, baby

If he will be, if he will be here
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
Oh, woah

Incapable of makin' alright decisions

And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach, but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater, let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds, but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh

She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here and now
So let me hold both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside, this place is warm
Outside, it starts to pour

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one

But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite171Embed"

And you don't seem to understand
A shame you seemed an honest man
And all the fears you hold so dear
Will turn to whisper in your ear
And you know what they say might hurt you

A shame that I can read your mind
And all the things that I read there

Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)

Now you suck
We wanna talk about sex but we're not allowed
Well, you may not like it but you better learn how 'cause it's your turn now
You're wasting your tongue with lame excuses and lies
Now, what's on your nasty old mind?

So how should I begin this?
I guess it started when you were with him
And how he never even took you out to dance
But did he fuck with any rhythm?
But now he's playing with your head
But did he ever make you cum?
Did he ever make you cry?
Do the wires in your mind get sewn together?
Rubbed and severed by the heat
You don't know how long I could stare into your picture
And wish that it was me
I guess it's different 'cause you love him
But I've got an interactive
Sick and twisted imagination
And that's gotta count for something

We wanna talk about sex but we're not allowed
Well, you may not like it but you'd better learn how 'cause it's your turn now
You're wasting your tongue with lame excuses and lies

Licking sweat off of your forehead
With your finger in my mouth
And the sound when leather jackets hit the ground
You should hear when you're not around
When it's just us horny poets
Who can't wait to write it down
And swear we were only being honest
Do you like these little sonnets?
'Cause I wrote them just for you
But how quickly they turn sour
So be careful who you screw
And never call
And I'm starting to suspect
You don't intend to do anything you say at all

Well, you may not like it but you'd better learn how 'cause it's your turn now
You're wasting your tongue with lame excuses and lies

From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)

Back to reality, we poor, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Another casualty at war, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head (My Tony head, my Tony head)
He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
That Louis Burgers never be the same (Won't be the same, won't be the same)
A Louis belt that never ease that pain (Won't ease that pain, won't ease that pain)
But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin' (That day is jerkin', that day is jerkin')
Pull off at Church's, with Pirellis skirtin' (Pirellis skirtin', Pirellis skirtin')

You've been hiding them in hollowed out pianos left in the dark

One, two, three
Wait, is this the song with the drums?

I met a guy in the summer, and I left him in the spring
He argued with me about everything
He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye
He said he's six-foot-two, and I'm like, ""Dude, nice try""
But he was so much fun, and he had such weird friends
And he would take us out to parties, and the night would never end
Another song, another club, another bar, another dance
And when hе said something wrong, he'd just fly me to Francе
So I miss him some nights when I'm feeling depressed
'Til I remember every time he made a pass on my friend
Do I love him? Do I hate him? I guess it's up and down
If I had to choose, I would say right now

I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge, and I want him again
I want to get him back, back, back

'Cause I miss the way he kisses and the way he made me laugh

Because everyone knew all of the shit that he'd do
He said I was the only girl, but that just wasn't the truth
And when I told him how he hurt me, he'd tell me I was trippin'
But I am my father's daughter, so maybe I could fix him

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Заберу тебе з дому за чверть до третьої
Питаю, чи не хочеш чогось перекусити
Катаємось, напиваємось, повторюєм знов
Буджу тебе ніччю за чверть до першої
Ніколи не можу спинитись, хочу розваг
Не поводься ти так, ніби я з тих дівчат, що в змозі заснути

Бо щоразу, як ти кажеш, що підеш
Я просто посміхаюсь, бо, милий, я вже знаю
Ти знаєш, під цим пальтом у мене нічого немає

У, впусти світло усередину
Кричу під твоїми задніми дверима, бо хочу ввійти
У, увімкни своє світло
Поглянь на нас, ти і я, знову за старе

Заїду за тобою десь за чверть до одинадцятої
Зазвичай нам нема чого робити
До біса, може, тобі слід піти записати парочку своїх пісень
Одягла обтислу сукню, бо ти знаєш, що я
Виблискую на світлі, так багато надій
На це життя і на те, як ми напишемо пісню про кохання

Take a look inside your heart, is there any room for me?
I won't have to hold my breath till you get down on one knee
Because you only want to hold me when I'm looking good enough
Did you ever feel me? Would you ever picture us?
Every time I pull my hair, well, it's only out of fear
That you'll find me ugly and one day you'll disappear because
What's the point of crying? It was never even love
Did you ever want me? Was I ever good enough?

Thе-the boy's a liar, the boy's a liar

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon, the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas

Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you

Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on Mother Nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the

Most of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do, I'll be right behind you

Find out how it feels to let go of everything, be free

I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's
Had the X6 back then, back then
No matter what I did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then, we were friends

I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'

And we started from nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now

You say, ""I don't understand,"" and I say, ""I know you don't""
We thought a cure would come through in time, now, I fear it won't
Remember lookin' at this room? We loved it 'cause of the light
Now, I just sit in the dark and wonder if it's time

Do I throw out everything we built or keep it?
I'm getting tired even for a phoenix
Always risin' from the ashes
Mendin' all her gashes
You might just have dealt the final blow

Stop, you're losin' me
Stop, you're losin' me
Stop, you're losin' me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore for you
'Cause you're losin' me

Every mornin', I glared at you with storms in my eyes
How can you say that you love someone you can't tell is dyin'?
I sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick
My face was gray, but you wouldn't admit that we were sick

'Til we were too far gone to bring back to life?

Got love-struck, went straight to my head
Got lovesick all over my bed
Love to think you’ll never forget
Handprints in wet cement
Adorned with smoke on my clothes
Lovelorn and nobody knows

And if they call me a slut
You know it might be worth it for once

Send the code, he's waitin' there
The sticks and stones they throw froze mid-air
Everyone wants him, that was my crime
The wrong place at the right time
And I break down, then he's pullin' me in

Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the tide

Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

But I don't know if you feel the same as I do

As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined
You must've had yourself a change of heart like halfway through the drive
Because your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign
Kept on drivin' straight and left our future to the right
Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face
And memories are somethin' even smoking weed does not replace
And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains
Doc told me to travel, but there's Covid on the planes

And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do

So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad
That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from Dad
No, I am no longer funny 'cause I miss the way you laugh

Cold as December but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care
Maybe I wasn't there (We saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there169Embed"

I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch

Big communication, tell me what you want
Translate your vibration, let your body talk to me
Baby love, if you wanna show me what
You've been schemin' up, if you wanna (Let go)
Trust the simulation, don't you let it break
Every stimulation, promise I can take
What you wanna give? Boy, you better show me what
You've been schemin' up

You got my heartbeat racin'
My body blazin'

I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush

Take me to the feeling, boy, you know the one
Kiss it when you're done, man, this shit is so much fun
Pocket rocket gun

You got my heartbeat (Heartbeat) racin' (Racin')

Fade Into You,Mazzy Star,"['alternative', 'dance']","87 ContributorsFade Into You Lyrics
I wanna hold the hand inside you
I wanna take the breath that's true
I look to you and I see nothing
I look to you to see the truth
You live your life, you go in shadows
You'll come apart and you'll go blind
Some kind of night into your darkness
Colored your eyes with what's not there

Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew


A stranger's light comes on slowly
A stranger's heart without a home
You put your hands into your head
And then its smiles cover your heart

Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew

First things first: rest in peace, Uncle Phil
For real
You the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville
Fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville, talk to a nigga

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

No role models, and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night, I was gettin' my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch
Not Trina, but I swear to God, this bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, ""Hey, what's good?
Sorry, I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good""
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, ""Nah, I was the same without it""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
'Fore I started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody, you wadn't sweatin' me

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

I want a real love, dark-skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do', nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt, 'fore she leave
""I'ma need my shirt back"" (Nigga, you know how it go)
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once... shame on... shame on you
Fool me—can't get fooled again

Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)
Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch prolly couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song

She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow
She shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow), yeah, ayy

She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow), haha

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

He said, ""Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds""
I thought, ""Heaven can't help me now""
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

I said, ""No one has to know what wе do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voicе is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request it is

Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ha, ha)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' (Burnin') it (It) down (Down)

Say you'll remember me

Even if it's just pretend
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your (Just pretend, just pretend)

City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
And you won't get out the county 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon, its ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they've got to kiss me 'cause I don't get to sleep, no
(Beep)

Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever, hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Laughin' gas, these hazmats, fast cats
Linin' 'em up like ass cracks
Play these ponies at the track
It's my chocolate attack
Shit, I'm steppin' in the heart of this here (Yeah)
Care Bear repping in harder this year (Yeah)
Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown
With yo' sound, you in the blink
Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
With yo' sound, you kill the Inc
So don't stop, get it, get it (Get it)
Until you're cheddar headed
And watch the way I navigate, hahahahaha
(Ha! Haha! Haha! Haha! Ha!)

nights,Frank Ocean,['alternative'],"405 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolPortuguêsFrançaisNights Lyrics

'Round your city, 'round the clock
Everybody needs you
No, you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody bein' honest with you
Breathe 'til I evaporated
My whole body see through
Transportation, handmade (G)
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some gushy, have a calm night
Shooters killin' left and right
Workin' through your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you (Bitch)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that
I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up?
Did you call me from a séance?
You are from my past life
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
I been out here head first
Always like the head first
Signal comin' in and out
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
Everybody needs you
Everybody needs you
Ooh, nani-nani
This feel like a Quaalude
No sleep in my body
Ain't no bitch in my body, ah
You might also like
New beginnings, ahh
New beginnings, wake up, akh
The sun's goin' down
Time to start your day, bruh
Can't keep bein' laid off
Know you need the money if you gon' survive
Every night shit, every day shit

Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na-na though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
That's every day shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every day shit, every night shit, every day shit
(Every night shit, night shit, night shit, night shit)

All my night, been ready for you all my night
Been waitin' on you all my night
I'll buzz you in, just let me know when you're outside
All my night, you been missin' all my night
Still got some good nights memorized
And the look back's gettin' me right

Every night fucks every day up
Every day patches the night up
On God, you should match it, it's that KO
No white lighters 'til I fuck my twenty-eighth up (Fire)
1998, my family had that Acura (Fire)
Oh, the Legend (Fire)
Kept at least six discs in the changer
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active (Massive)
Couple bishops in the city buildin' mansions (Massive)
All the reverends
Preachin' self-made millionaire status
When we could only eat at Shoney's on occasion
After 'Trina hit I had to transfer campus
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address
Fuckin' on you when I didn't own a mattress
Workin' on a way to make it outta Texas, every night

Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift, yeah
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Want to see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na-na though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down
See me bummed out, stressed out
That's just every day shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
Every day shit, every day shit
Every night shit, every day shit
Every day shit, every day shit
Every day shit, every night shit365Embed"
